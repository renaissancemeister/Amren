			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Simon Caldwell, Daily Mail (London), Dec. 1, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Muslim prayer rooms should be opened in every Roman Catholic school, church leaders have said. </p>
<p>The Catholic bishops of England and Wales also want facilities in schools for Islamic pre-prayer washing rituals. </p>
<p>The demands go way beyond legal requirements on catering for religious minorities. </p>
<p>But the bishops &mdash; who acknowledge 30 per cent of pupils at their schools hold a non-Christian faith &mdash; want to answer critics who say religious schools sow division. </p>
<p>The recommendations were made in a document, Catholic Schools, Children of Other Faiths and Community Cohesion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If practicable, a room (or rooms) might be made available for the use of pupils and staff from other faiths for prayer,&rsquo; the bishops said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Existing toilet facilities might be adapted to accommodate individual ritual cleansing which is sometimes part of religious lifestyle and worship.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If such space is not available on a permanent or regular basis, extra efforts might be made to address such need for major religious festivals.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Islamic cleansing ritual, called &lsquo;Wudhu&rsquo;, is carried out by Muslims before they pray.</p>
<p>Islam teaches that Muslims are unfit for prayer if they have not performed Wudhu after breaking wind or using the toilet. </p>
<p>Wudhu involves washing the face, hands, arms and feet three times each, gargling the mouth three times and washing the neck and inside the nose and ears. Some Muslims also wash their private parts.</p>
<p>Catholic schools would need to install bidets, foot spas and hoses to facilitate such extensive cleansing rituals, Muslims say.</p>
<p>Daphne McLeod, a former Catholic head teacher from south London, said it would be &lsquo;terribly expensive&rsquo; for the country&rsquo;s 2,300 Catholic primary and secondary schools to provide ritual cleansing facilities.</p>
<p>She said: &lsquo;If Muslim parents choose a Catholic school then they accept that it is going to be a Catholic school and there will not be facilities for ritual cleansing and prayer rooms.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They do their ritual cleansing before they go to a mosque, but they are not going to a mosque.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think the bishops should go looking for problems. Where will it stop?&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Majid Khatme, a Muslim who sent his children to a London Catholic school, said he was delighted by the gesture.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is very kind of the bishops if they give this facility for Muslims to pray,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would love to send a letter of thanks to the bishops, really. If they do this all Muslims in Britain will be thankful to the Catholic Church to have facilities to pray. It is very, very encouraging.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The recommendations have been approved by Vincent Nichols, Archbishop of Birmingham and the favourite to succeed Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O&rsquo;Connor as Catholic primate. </p>
<p>But it would be up to governing bodies of each school to decide whether to act on the guidance. <br>

		<p>I would not have been at all surprised to see this kind of lunacy from the Church of England, but for the Catholic Church to approve it absolutely astounds me.  Has anybody told Pope Benedict about this?  If Muslims are let into these schools, the goal should be to convert them, not accommodate their differences.  One might as well argue that a church should allow a Muslim imam to preach every fourth Sunday.</p>
<p>Just flabbergasting.</p>

		<p>This will also happen in the US, as their numbers here grow uncontrolled. Funny how Christians are constantly persecuted by American laws, while foreigners and illegals are allowed to run the show, by feminazis liberal nuts in our government, increasing their agenda of political correctness. </p>

		<p>How about opening some christian pray rooms in public schools? Or better yet, Christian prayer rooms at every Muslim school. Including a Christian prayer room at every local magistrate with a Muslim &#8216;equal opportunity&rsquo; counselor. There&rsquo;s no excuse not to. Any break room can be converted to a Christian prayer room. Muslims need to be educated about tolerance, and celebrate diversity too. </p>

		<p>  Moslems do not allow Christian worship in their schools.<br>
  Christians are often beaten as infidels.<br>
  The Bishops in England are not promoting the Catholic (worldwide) spreading of the Christian faith as required by Catholic Christian Doctrine.<br>
   In earlier times they would have been removed as Bishops for making special provisions in Catholic schools.  There were NO provisions for other religions when I was in Catholic schools and the Jews and Moslems who did attend Catholic Schools attended ALL services and learned the Catechism just like every one else.<br>
   One of my friends from that time was the son of a Diplomat from a Moslem country and is no a well known Moslem religious leader. He does understand Christians and uses his personal knowledge to correct errors about Christians but nothing changed his belief in Islam.<br>

		<p>Insanity! </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obvious the Islamic &#8216;faith&rsquo; is based on ritual and tradition. That is not FAITH.</p>
<p>Do they need the 30% Muslim students to help fund their schools? <br>
Maybe they should rethink the way things are done, what God really wants for them. Greed for money, materialism, status, and power is really going to do us all in.</p>

		<p>Just when I thought I&rsquo;d seen and heard it all, along comes even more insanity! Why bother even calling it a Catholic school at all??????</p>
<p>And why would Muslims even send their children to the schools of the infidel religion? It boggles the mind!</p>

		<p>Modern christianity is such a cowardly disgrace; no wonder, White Europeans (meaning all of us) have left the &#8216;church&rsquo; in droves over the last 40 years.</p>
<p>From churches promoting &#8216;amnesty&rsquo;, to supporting &#8216;homosexuals&rsquo;, it is quite understandable that this judaic religion has subverted almost all our original healthy instincts.</p>

		<p>When they say that 30% of the schools&rsquo; students are non christian-they probably mean sikh, hindu, jewish, and buddhist (presumably east asian) kids.  the indians (sikhs/hindus), jews, and east asians succeed economically in britain, so they would have the affluence to send their kids to good, private, catholic schools. <br>
On the other hand, Muslims (Pakistanis/Bangladeshis mostly) are at the bottom of British society economically, and thus not able to send their kids to private Catholic schools.  so the muslim population enrolled in catholic schools is probably negligible to begin with.</p>

Good heavens. How much worse can it get when Catholics are no longer defenders of the faith?</p>
<p>They should be outraged that non-Catholics are in their schools not transforming them to accommodate the heretics and infidels.</p>
<p>Are they going to reschedule classes for everyone to allow ritual prayers?</p>
<p>Madness. Absolute madness.</p>

		<p>This God sent opportunity must not be missed. In order to establish exactly what is required, just invite a couple of local imams to visit the school to give advice. Ensure local media is at hand to record the event and publish photo&rsquo;s with names etc suggesting muslims are visiting Christian schools with a view to conversion! Any muslim child currently attending school should be inundated with Christian songs, prayers, bible stories etc and asked if they wish to convert or leave, never to return. Have the entire Christian school student body ask to visit the local mosque to suggest how Christian values can be incorporated. The whole silly idea will collapse and I doubt if many muslim students will be permitted by their parents to continue their education at the school. Islam forbids muslims from consorting with non-muslims for fear of contamination. May even be adopted country-wide. God willing! </p>
