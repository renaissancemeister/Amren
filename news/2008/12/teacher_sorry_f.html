<h1><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/wires/2008Dec05/0,4670,SlaveLesson,00.html">Teacher Sorry for Binding Girls in Slavery Lesson</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jim Fitzgerald, AP, December 5, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A white social studies teacher attempted to enliven a seventh-grade discussion of slavery by binding the hands and feet of two black girls, prompting outrage from one girl&rsquo;s mother and the local chapter of the NAACP. After the mother complained to Haverstraw Middle School, the superintendent said he was having &#8220;conversations with our staff on how to deliver effective lessons.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The teacher apologized to the mother who complained and her 13-year-old daughter during a meeting Thursday that also included a representative of the local NAACP. But the mother, Christine Shand of Haverstraw, said Friday she thinks the teacher should be removed from the class.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Nov. 18, Bernstein was discussing the conditions under which African captives were taken to America in slave ships. She bound the two students&rsquo; hands and feet with tape and had them crawl under a desk to simulate the experience, Monahan and Shand said. Monahan said the girls were not the only blacks in the class.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wilbur Aldridge, director of the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said the history demonstration, first reported in The Journal News, &#8220;went wrong when she started to do that binding.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Aldridge said he feared that the teacher still &#8220;didn&rsquo;t get it&#8221; after their meeting. He said the teacher apologized &#8220;because Gabrielle was upset, not because she admitted she did something wrong.&#8221;</p>

								<h2>School Stages Mock Lynching With Little Kids; Noose Found in Police Locker Room</h2>
						<p>
							<i>USA Today, October 1, 2007</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Meanwhile, teachers at an elementary school on the campus of Grambling State University, a historically black college, are under fire for a lesson on racism that included a mock lynching of at least one student, according to The News Star.</p>
<p>The Gramblinite, a student newspaper, posted a story and photos of the incident last week. School officials later ordered the paper to remove these items from its website, according to The News Star.</p>
<p>That paper says the story reported: kindergarten and first-grade students at Alma J. Brown Elementary will always remember the day they marched for equality. The children marched in protest of the imprisonment of Mychal Bell, and the seemingly racial bias shown toward blacks in a small Louisiana town&hellip;&nbsp;. Before marching, the students were taught about racism. They also learned about the events surrounding the &lsquo;Jena Six&rsquo; and their arrest. &hellip; [teachers] had a replica noose and explained why it is such a symbol of racism. They also allowed the children to carry chains and shackles.</p>

		<p>School kids of all races do not want to discuss racial matters in school. Racial matters are like the subject of sex, kids are just not comfortable with it.This teacher must not have had any exposure to blacks before he became a teacher.</p>

		<p>Such a disgusting waste of time.  Too, it helps victimhood stay alive in the black community.</p>
<p>Schools are institutions of learning, and should not fritter away valuable time on incidents that are passe and have no bearing whatsoever on the world of today.</p>
<p>This is an excellent example of why the US is near the bottom in learning compared to the rest of the world.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m quite sure this teacher probably thought she was going to eradicate, &ldquo;all the injustices that whites have caused blacks&rdquo; in one fell swoop. She&rsquo;s probably still got that deer-in-the-heads look on her face.  Stupid demonstration? Sure! But, if some bleeding-heart-liberal insists on sacrificing themselves to demonstrate that it&rsquo;s not possible to appease blacks, then I say, so be it.</p>

		<p>While I think this story is most likely phony, something contrived by the NAACP and the teacher herself, we had something like this when I was in school nearly 30 years ago. Explaining the &#8216;poll-tax&rsquo; or &#8216;voter literacy&rsquo; that supposedly &#8216;disenfranchised&rsquo; blacks in the south, our teacher asked two white girls in our class, &#8220;who was the first president of the USA?&#8221;, then he asked two black girls in class, &#8220;explain the writ of habeas corpus?&#8221;. He didn&rsquo;t touch either physically so I suppose the abuse was much less extreme. I suppose it did explain the practice. Since we are all &#8216;one race&rsquo; perhaps he should have given the white girls the unanswerable question.  </p>
<p>The irony would be if &#8216;disenfranchisement&rsquo; wasn&rsquo;t real in the first place but only a story &#8216;covered&rsquo; to garner sympathy for blacks - or anger for whites as the case might be, in the first place. </p>

		<p>This is the standard liberal curriculm.  Devote everything to feelings and horror and repulsion at evil whites.  Continue through graduate school.</p>
<p>Then wonder why the average college graduate doesn&rsquo;t even know what century the revolution, civil war and WW1 and WW2 were fought in.</p>
<p>Glad to see another liberal white feminazi traitor gets what&rsquo;s coming to her from her beloved blacks.</p>
<p>I wonder if those 12 year olds know their times tables.  Probably not, third grade was too taken up with liberal propaganda there wasn&rsquo;t time for basic math.</p>
<p>The soviet union did a lot better job than we are doing.  Their curriculm was mostly liberal propaganda, but they managed to drill the basics into the students heads as well.</p>

		<p>This is all part of the intense hate-whitey propaganda we taxpayers pay for in the public schools. Notice the emphasis always on how something &#8220;feels&#8221;. Not simply teaching objective dispassionate history: They want these black kids to be inflamed with racial rage. And to identify themselves personally as victims of the evil white boogeyman. And in the case of the white kids forced to act out, for example, the Rosa Parks story (as is now done in almost all public schools), the purpose is to burden them personally with overwhelming white racial guilt so that they will not protest later on in life when they face relentless racial discrimination in the form of misnamed &#8220;affirmative action&#8221;.<br>
Of course, there&rsquo;s no acting lessons for white kids so they get a personal sense of how the white victims of black violence (over one million a year today in the U.S., 12 times the reverse) &#8220;feel&#8221; or &#8220;felt&#8221;. For example, no acting out simulations of the Zebra killings, the Yahweh Ben Yahweh killings, the Hi-Fi killings, the Crown Heights killing, the Long Island commuter train killings, the Wichita massacre killings, the Knoxville killings, and on and on, all black on white and something a little more relevant since it is the America of today, not the long dead past.<br>
Now of course these excesses sometimes backfire in the case of white leftist ding-a-ling teachers. They end up being consumed themselves by the very same fanaticism that they themselves are mindless frenzied agents of, having been thoroughly brainwashed in teacher&rsquo;s college: These white leftists themselves fall victim to the ideological fervor that so desperately wants to showcase the ever elusive &#8220;white racism&#8221; that it will even turn on its own white advocates to do so. Poetic justice. Like the Weatherman terrorists who blew themselves up with their own bomb.<br>

		<p>As I posted on a different thread I was watching the evening news and this story was introduced, as all stories with a hint of white racism (is there any other kind?)are, by the black female announcer. We live in such a sick time wherein the media looks for stories that support this myopic view of race, that is that whitey is the devil (I&rsquo;m only being slightly sarcastic here). The fire of black rage and white guilt has to be constantly stoked else how can we acquiesce to the humongous transfer of wealth that has occurred over the last forty years. Does Affirmative Action have a timetable? Do set asides and all the other racial nonsense documented here on AMREN and elsewhere?</p>
<p>In short this was not a news story where a loose cannon white supremacist teacher was on the loose in the northern suburbs of NYC. It was a story rooted in political correctness and multicultural education. The news story that I viewed pictured a young Afro-American female, kinda militant looking, identified as the principal of the school.</p>

		<p>If whites tied a rope around a girl&rsquo;s neck, whether to teach a lesson about the cruelties of &#8220;lynching&#8221; or for any other reason, the entire school would be shut down  &mdash;  permanently! Whites in the entire town would be beating their breasts and wearing hair shirts. This makes a schoolyard prank by a couple of high school boys pale in significance. No wonder pictures of the incident are becoming scarce  &mdash;  it shows the real hysteria about lynching is on the part of blacks. And because of this, count on the national media to willfully ignore this story.</p>

		<p> I hope the blacks eat this self hating White liberal alive. It&rsquo;s Whites like her that are OUR enemy and we need to confront them every chance we get. They&rsquo;re the ones who started and keep this &#8220;black victim&#8221; game going. Every time a White gets murdered, raped, assaulted etc., by a non-White, a White liberal is behind it some how,some way. THEY are the ones destroying this country. And after reading the original article, I got a big laugh when I read that the girls mother &#8220;hasn&rsquo;t decided whether or not to file a lawsuit.&#8221; When have you EVER seen a black turn down the &#8220;ghetto lottery?&#8221; Trust me, she&rsquo;s already at the Cadillac dealer ordering her new Escalade.</p>

The teacher is obviously an amateur in the world of white guilt, she wouldn&rsquo;t be in any trouble at all if she had hog-tied a couple white students.</p>
<p>2nd article:<br>
Honestly, is lynching really that big of a deal?  Last time I checked, the number of whites murdered by blacks in the past few years is greater than the number of blacks that have ever been lynched.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s just another attempt by the NAACP to get more money, attention, ect. Every Amrener has seen it dozens and dozens of times before. </p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean that the actions of the teacher in question was appropriate by any stretch of the immagination. It would be a great thing for the world if everyone was just given a big dose of common sense. </p>

		<p>Can ANYONE enlighten me as to what is being taught in today&rsquo;s schools with respect to history? I got into a bit of an argument on a local newscast blog site for pointing out White Europeans (and their descendants) gave us the foundation of modern civilization. One damned fool fell all over himself trying to deny it, yet could not produce an intelligent counter-argument.</p>
<p>Admittedly, I graduated a few years in advance of the p.c. slop being pumped into students. I am intellectually curious how deep the dryrot disseminated by the Revisionists has spread.</p>
<p>Amazing, how particularly the Afro-centrist cult (like some of their posters   &mdash;   Occam, Blackbuck, and others) claimed credit for virtually everything. If you consider the logistical exercise involved in getting those mythical Black African geniuses from South Central Africa through thousands of miles of jungle and desert lands&hellip; through Egypt west across Asia Minor, north into Asia, then east into Southern Europe, then South into Greece&hellip; to teach those magnificent intellectuals during the Golden Age of Greece&hellip; I can&rsquo;t stop laughing at that utter absurdity. Or conversely, having them traverse hundreds of miles of open ocean (the Med) in a hollowed out log canoe&hellip; which would capsize in even moderately high seas.</p>
<p>What kind of self-hating White fools have we produced. Like those utter lunatics of professors, spouting the garbage of &#8220;White Privilege,&#8221; for just one example.</p>
<p>Why even would schools have any reason constantly harp on the imagined evils of slavery. Damned few slave-owners were the coarse, unfeeling brutes, dear to the Hollywood fiction writers. They were about as numerous as the lunatic idiots maiming and destroying prize cattle, or thoroughbred horses for sheer sadistic fun,.</p>

She broke the unwritten rule: only blacks can discuss race and only on their terms.</p>
<p>It never ceases to amaze me how out of touch most whites are in regards to blacks. As others have noted, blacks can not be appeased. They can only be groveled to.</p>
<p>Yet another wide-eyed white woman trying to prove how much she cares about blacks and their history get caught by the people she&rsquo;s trying to show her love. She likely heard all the rhetoric from black &#8216;educators&rsquo; that what will close the learning gap is instruction in african American history.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to feel sympathy from such ignorance and foolishness. When it&rsquo;s all over, she still won&rsquo;t have a clue as to what went wrong and why she was attacked. What went wrong is that she listened to blacks and she was attacked because she&rsquo;s white.<br>

		<p>The teacher obviously watched too many movies about some idealistic white liberal going into the ghetto and connecting with her down and out minority students and opening their minds and ulitmately winning their respect blah blah blah.</p>
<p>Playing gotcha is blacks&rsquo; number 1 joy in life, even when the victim was obviously only trying to appease them. Whatever, live and learn maybe the experience will convince her to move to a real school.</p>

		<p>Maybe she could enact what the arab slave traders did to the slaves they marched north and sold to arabs and turks.</p>
<p>Strip them naked, shackle them at ankle and waist, chain them together and march them through a couple hundred miles of desert.<br>
When they arrive at the wholesale market, castrate with out any pain killer all the boys 14 and under.  Of course only about 25 or 30 percent will survive,the castration but the survivors can be sold for a very high price.</p>
<p>If history is reduced to classroom skits, at least be historically accurate.</p>

<p>I have a tenant, a 30 year old white woman who is getting her PHD. at a nearby university.  The university is one of the most prestigious in the country.  The PHD is in some insane liberal arts blither blather studies.</p>
<p>Here are some things she firmly believes.</p>
<p>During medieval and early modern times, the &#8220;Catholic church&#8221; every year burnt millions of gays to death. (if this happened Europe would have been depopulated)</p>
<p>There were gold mines in the Caribbean islands. Columbus looted the mines. (there was gold jewelry, but it came from Mexican gold mines)</p>
<p>Arab owners of black slaves treated them like family members and even allowed their daughters to marry their male slaves.  Whereas American slave owners were totally cruel and evil.</p>
<p>No women were allowed to vote in America before 1920. (Many states allowed women to vote before the 1920 amendment, especially the evil western mucho macho cowboy frontier states)</p>
<p>White men commit most of the rapes in this country. (black and hispanic men together commit almost all the rapes in this country.)</p>
<p>The Rosenbergs, Alger Hiss etc were totally and completely innocent.  She knows this is true because the Rosenberg sons came to her undergrad college and made a presentation proving their parent&rsquo;s innocence.(they wouldn&rsquo;t be biased would they?)</p>
<p>The ancient Egyptians were black africans and of course Cleopatra was black, not the Greek descendant of Phillip the great and Alexander the great&rsquo;s brother.</p>
<p>Ancient Greek and Roman civilization was developed by black Africans from Egypt.</p>
<p>The highest point of European civilization was the muslim occupation of Spain which was some sort of paradise of enlightenment, scientific research, prosperity, progress and tolerance.  The muslims never sold Spanish girls into sex slavery.</p>
<p>Muslim women actually had more rights than western women until around 1970 when the feminazi movement began.</p>
<p>The Republican party was the party of the Confederate states of America.  The Democrats were the party of the federal Union forces. After the war, it was the Republicans who created the segregation system.</p>
<p>Blacks were segregated in all the states prior to the 60&rsquo;s.  Blacks were forbidden to vote in every state until the Civil Rights Acts of the 60&rsquo;s.<br>
Blacks were sent to the back of the bus in all 50 states.  Blacks attended segregated schools in all the states.  <br>
Blacks were not allowed in public swimming pools in all the states until the civil rights acts.<br>
Blacks had to use separate public restrooms in all the states before the 60&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Stalin and Lenin never massacred their populations.  That was a falsehood spread by Senator McCarthy.</p>
<p>I try not to talk to her.  </p>
