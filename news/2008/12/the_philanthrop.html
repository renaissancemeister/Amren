			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Wall Street Journal, December 30, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In 2006, Publix Supermarket Charities donated almost $30 million to causes that included Habitat for Humanity, the March of Dimes and United Way. But Al Pi単a isn&rsquo;t satisfied. Mr. Pi単a, the chairman of the Florida Minority Community Reinvestment Coalition, believes Publix isn&rsquo;t giving enough to people of color who donate to other people of color. Welcome to the latest trend in racial extortion.</p>
<p>According to a study that Mr. Pi単a commissioned from the California-based activist group Greenlining, Publix gave only 2.81% of its grants in 2006 to &#8220;minority-led organizations.&#8221; Minority-led is defined as groups whose staff and board of directors are 50% racial minority and whose mission and programs &#8220;are aimed predominantly towards communities of color.&#8221; Overall, Florida&rsquo;s top 10 foundations (as measured by asset size) didn&rsquo;t fare much better, giving on average 5.48% of their grants to minority-led outfits.</p>
<p>But who cares? Doesn&rsquo;t it matter more what these groups accomplish rather than who runs them? Mr. Pi単a is outraged by the suggestion. &#8220;No one can convince me that United Way provides better service directly to minorities than a minority-led organization,&#8221; he told us recently. &#8220;We&rsquo;re in the trenches. There is no way that [nonminorities] can connect and have more traction and effect than organizations with leaders who live in those communities day in and day out.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>To accomplish this redistribution of charity, Greenlining says Florida foundations &#8220;should track diversity information for grantee organizations, either voluntarily or through legislative mandates.&#8221; Last year, Greenlining almost succeeded in getting such legislation passed in California. It was stopped only when California&rsquo;s largest foundations agreed to pay off California&rsquo;s minority-led organizations. This month the foundations announced the details and cost of that plan &mdash; to the tune of about $30 million. Greenlining&rsquo;s director, Orson Aguillar, told us &#8220;that&rsquo;s a good start&#8221; but the money isn&rsquo;t &#8220;a substitute for legislation.&#8221;</p>

		<p>For the Wall Street Journal, who has openly championed large-scale third-world(ie. cheap labor) immigration, legal or illegal, to take this position is laughable&hellip;but not really funny of course. Are we to believe that the WSJ didn&rsquo;t fully expect this type of identity-politics to unfold in the wake of a human tidal wave across the southern border of the US? Phoney hypocrites!!</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t feel sorry for most of these charities. They are run by white neo-Marxists who worship at the altar of diversity and are getting what they deserve. Diseases, conservation and animals are the only things I will consider. I&rsquo;d rather burn my money in a fire pit than give it to a major anti-white charity like United Way.</p>

		<p>  Non-anglos will never assimilate nor will they ever try to live in peace and harmony amongst anglos. They will always do their upmost to undermine all things anglo. Therefor, they must go. The United States has already slid way below other developed nations around the world due to our quest to bow down to minorities. Trillions of dollars were wasted over the past 50 years to raise up minorities to the level of whites. Our schools have been dumbed-down, our industries destroyed, and our scientific community obliterated to allow minorities to try and catch up. Minorities are a protected species, and they exploit it. Crime is way up and the cities are becoming war zones as we fill our country with even more minorities from the four corners of the globe. The Soviets were right, we will destroy ourselves, nobody need fire a single shot. The United States is commiting suicide. Assisted by our enemies at home.</p>

<p>I can voice similar sentiments regarding white schools, white neighborhoods, and white businesses. </p>
<p>I can connect to whites. I can&rsquo;t connect to blacks nor can they connect to me. It&rsquo;s frustrating and fatiguing to try. Why bother when all we have to both do is recognize each group knows what&rsquo;s best for their own and leave it at that.<br>

		<p>Like labor unions, racial extortionists rely on the government to provide the muscle behind their schemes.  The feds put the mafia out of business by taking over their business.  Overt force is rarely used because litigation is a much more efficient tool.  These hideous racial extortionists and sexual deviants are nothing more than a front for the white marxist.  Free White men must take back our country&rsquo;s government and repeal all anti-freedom and anti-White policies.</p>

		<p>Yet another reason to not donate to those charities.  We really need to have an organization that collects donations strictly for the benefit of whites in need.  I&rsquo;m sure somebody will reply to this post with the details of any such organization that may already exist.  Thanks!</p>

		<p>It really isn&rsquo;t &#8220;philanthropy.&#8221; Let&rsquo;s call it what it is&hellip; RACIAL EXTORTION! The non-Whites are never satisfied; can never get enough hand-outs from the White population. Nor will non-Whites ever be satisfied until all wealth has been transferrred to them and Whites are living in poverty.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much like that worthless excuse sociologists come up with to account for that disproportionate amount of crime committed by Blacks and Hispanics in America. Blaming poverty for causing crime! Let&rsquo;s look at that &#8216;cause&rsquo; for crime. If poverty were indeed responsible, hell, our White European immigrants arriving between 1865 and 1965 would have been responsible for just about all crime in America&hellip; given the bleak truth most of those WHITE immigrants arrived with empty pockets and little more than hope.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s GREED, JEALOUSY, ENVY of what Whites have&hellip; that breeds crime! Greed and envy! Because the minorities can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t understand we Whites WORKED to attain what perceived wealth we have! Just like raw greed is behind the flood of illegal immigrants streaming here from Mexico and Latin America. &#8220;Those Anglos are living too good. We deserve some of that good life. Let&rsquo;s head North and grab all the wellfare and taxpayer funded hand-outs we can get.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Years ago while working in law enforcement here in NYC we were solicited by our employer to sign up for payday deductions to go to the BUFNY. You ask what is this BUFNY? Answer, &#8220;Black United Fund of New York&#8221; We were given literature on all the good works they did. Of course each and every last red cent only went to blacks.I politely declined to sign up. You can only imagine the OUTRAGE if people were asked to give money that would only go to needy whites.</p>

		<p>We are constantly told by liberals that race doesn&rsquo;t matter and that race is a social construct&hellip; how is it that these same &#8220;race doesn&rsquo;t exist&#8221; or &#8220;race doesn&rsquo;t matter&#8221; people suddenly are able to recognize race when it comes to who to give the money out to!</p>
<p>Whites are the REAL minority. We are less than 14% of the world&rsquo;s population, and we have fallen below replacement levels. Whites are routinely vilified and insulted in the media, the public schools and in liberal colleges and universities. </p>
<p>As far as giving money to Blacks and Mexicans&hellip; in my mind that would be about as useful as having a bonfire and burning our money. The social problems that plague the black and mestizo communities are caused by their genetics, so in reality no amount of money will really change anything for them! </p>
<p>Even if we did have reparations for slavery, in a short time the blacks would spend their reparation money on booze, drugs, prostitutes, big screen TVs, and new cars. Please stop giving blacks money, it could be better spent helping to educate whites about race!<br>

		<p>Charles Drake you&rsquo;re right.  If every black in this country was given 50 thousand dollars, it would be spent within a few weeks.  40 thousand would go for a new Cadillac, 5 thousand for bling bling or clothes and the other 5 thousand on gambling and drugs.  Very few of them would use the money to better themselves or their families.  How many would invest it or put it to use getting a college education?</p>
