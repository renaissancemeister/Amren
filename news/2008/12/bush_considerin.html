<h1>Bush Considering Easing Rules on Foreign Farm Workers</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Doyle, McClatchy Newspapers, December 10, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Farmers would have an easier and cheaper time securing foreign guest workers under pending Bush administration rules.</p>
<p>The controversial changes to the so-called H-2A guest-worker program could cut wages and speed worker recruitment. They also would relax requirements for providing foreign workers with housing and transportation.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Department of Labor is going to weaken oversight and enforcement,&#8221; Bruce Goldstein, the executive director of the Farmworker Justice Fund, charged Wednesday.</p>
<p>A Labor Department spokesman said Wednesday night that the final rules would be made public Thursday and published in the Federal Register on Dec. 18, which means they&rsquo;d take effect two days before Barack Obama is sworn in as president Jan. 20.</p>
<p>Currently, about 75,000 foreign guest workers obtain visas annually under the H-2A program. The program is an agricultural cousin to the H-1B visa program favored by the high-tech industry, designed to aid employers who are unable to find U.S. workers for specialized tasks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>American farmers, though, consider the 50-year-old program slow and cumbersome, and it provides only a fraction of the U.S. farm work force. California, for example, uses only about 500 H-2A workers annually, while it has about 300,000 migrant farm workers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Labor Department announced in February that it would revise the program. The department subsequently received some 11,000 public comments, many duplicative. On Monday night, the final revisions, totaling 166 pages plus explanatory material totaling 393 pages, were posted quietly on the Labor Department&rsquo;s Web site.</p>
<p>The Labor Department dropped some initial proposals that had drawn fire, including one that would allow employers to provide housing vouchers instead of housing. However, many other changes survived.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The new rules would ease administrative burdens by allowing employers simply to &#8220;attest&#8221; that they&rsquo;re meeting various program requirements. The Labor Department said this would trim unnecessary paperwork; critics fear it will invite abuse.</p>
<p>The new rules also would add logging to the type of work eligible for H-2A workers, though the Labor Department declined to add several other occupation fields, including dairy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Agricultural employer representatives stressed Wednesday that the H-2A streamlining and cost savings won&rsquo;t fill the labor shortfall that drives U.S. farmers to rely on illegal immigrants.</p>

		<p>A young man friend of my Daughter&rsquo;s has gotten into trouble in Mexico. He was going down to Rocky Point for a weekend of relaxation and was stopped at the border. </p>
<p>Very stupidly, he had in his possession, a small amount of marijauna (3-4 cigarettes worth). He has been in jail since September and yesterday was sentenced to 10-TEN years in a Mexican Prison. </p>
<p>Now, I am a retired criminal defense attorney and fully agree and admit he was both guilty of a crime and stupid. I am aware of the old, &#8220;you do the crime, you do the time!&#8221; This is nonsense. </p>
<p>BUT, his cell mate was caught with a loaded AK47 and ammunition. He got 4 years. </p>
<p>This young man tells us that he can buy, from his cell, ANY drug he wants, MJ, cocaine, crack, heroine, meth, whatever including the services of a whore, male or female. All at &#8216;reasonable&rsquo; prices. Place your order in the morning and get afternoon service. </p>
<p>We are appealing, of course. </p>
<p>My point is that we should, as a people, avoid going to Mexico or in any way assisting their corrupt government. </p>

		<p>This president single-handedly destroyed the Republicans by pushing for amnesty, starting an unnecessary war that killed hundreds of thousands of people and devastated two entire countries, and is losing right now in one of them, and he&rsquo;s on the verge of attacking Iran, which will just about bring the entire West down in one huge economic collapse, because the Strait of Hormuz will be blocked and the Fifth Fleet will suffer unimagineable losses in the Persian Gulf.  Oil will skyrocket to $300 per barrel if it can be purchased at any price.</p>
<p>Instead of taking care of domestic business and protecting our southern border and our ports of entry he has the majority of our military thousands of miles away.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s responsible for pushing these free-trade agreements that are causing corporations to outsource their labor or move overseas, and the policy has reduced our manufacturing ability to about zero.</p>
<p>He advocated giving sub-prime loans to people who couldn&rsquo;t pay for them and instead of assigning oversight to the problem after many pointed out to him the economy was going to implode he ignored the warnings in favor of his utopian agenda.</p>
<p>He emphasized that the country would collapse if the sub-prime mortgages weren&rsquo;t bought with 700 billion in bailout money, then afterwards changed his mind about who the money should go to and we still don&rsquo;t know where a trillion dollars has been channeled to, because he provided no oversight.</p>
<p>Now, he wants to bring in foreign workers after we lost over a million jobs in the last two months, with predictions of up to a million losses per month in 2009.</p>
<p>Not only does he want more foreign workers, he just brought in 60,000 more recently on top of millions of third world refugees already awarded a path to citizenship with all the welfare that goes with it.</p>
<p>The man has been a curse for this country.  Now with this pro-black scam artist in charge beginning next year all those who are hoping for a complete destruction of this country are not going to be disappointed.</p>

		<p>There are more than enough farm workers in the USA.  They just live in the inner cities.  If we stop subsidizing their existence in the cities, and stop importing little brown foreign models, we&rsquo;d having plenty of farm workers and nice cities.</p>

		<p>Duh. Maybe someone needs to tell those hundreds of illegals hanging out on street corners and parking lots, hoping for a short-term hire, about this crying need Lying George tells us about. Mexicans supposedly are leaving in drovees, due to lack of work. GWB claims the growers can&rsquo;t get enough help. Throw the damned illegals and their broods out of our country. Put Americans to work. No more welfare checks, no more free rides. </p>

		<p>The farm workers work on the farm for a couple of years until they are eligible for welfare, then the farmers need endless numbers of replacement workers to do the work that machines could do if the farmers were willing to spend the money for equipment.</p>

		<p>I guess this is Bush&rsquo;s last manuever to show us, as he has done time and time again, how he prefers illegal aliens to American tax-paying, law-abiding citizens. Let his legacy be - &#8220;The best friend Mexico ever had.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Yes, and with the recent food scarcity and resulting rising prices, we definitely need more partially-employed Mexicans to harvest the crops that don&rsquo;t exist anymore.  Take a look at the country of origin of many of your fruits and vegetables  &mdash;  South America, Australia, Asia, Europe  &mdash;  anywhere but here, what used to be the breadbasket of the entire world.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it ironic that even with the &#8216;low-cost&rsquo; labor that these Mexicans provide, that we still can&rsquo;t undercut and compete with the overseas markets?  I smell a rat.</p>

		<p>This guy Bush has shown that the Christian Right, which supported him through thick and thin, has some very serious issues. </p>
<p>The downfall of this ignorant moron could quite possibly be the further downfall of the Christian Right. Or rather, it could cause people to see them as terribly flawed, and politicians will no longer make an effort to lead them around by the nose. </p>
<p>This is as it should be. Wrong actions, adding links to the chain of causation, lead to unintended results.</p>
<p>Being a man of faith does not mean that you have wisdom, or the ability to lead, or the craftiness to do so.</p>
<p>God save us from such as Bush. </p>

		<p>Ok, I don&rsquo;t have any problem with immigrates working on the farm. But how do you ensure they stay there? Armed guards? Dogs? Fences? Maybe Bush thinks that if we flood the country with immigrates, the wages in the cities will drop so low that they will have to go to the farms and work.</p>

		<p>They arrive a farm workers.  They they run to the nearest city or town and work for the food processing,  restaurant, hotels, gardeners, janitors, security guards and other industries that specialize in illegal alien labor.</p>

		<p>Flamethrower, you are absolutely right.  Britain has the same problem where those on welfare refuse to work on such &#8220;menial&#8221; tasks.  Why should they when they get paid anyway.  The State is crazy and needs to exercise discipline and get these young people working.  We have foreign workers from paces such as Poland (generally nice people but thay are reported to drink vodka like Coca Cola) flooding in, working hard when there are plenty of young unemployed &#8220;hands&#8221; in Britain already.  </p>

		<p>Bush has been probably the worst president in history. By allowing illegal invaders to come here by the millions, he has  destroyed this country forever, selling the country out for his corporate buddies and the presidents of Mexico. And now, right before he leaves office, he wants to make it easier for more to come in. He just doesn&rsquo;t get it.</p>
