<h1>Pro-Amnesty Activist Joins Obama White House Staff</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Penny Starr, Cybercast News Service (CNS), December 3, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An 18-year veteran of the National Council of La Raza (NCLR), who advocated for federal legislation to give the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in the United States a path to citizenship, has been tapped for President-elect Barack Obama&rsquo;s White House staff.</p>
<p>Cecilia Muñoz, who currently serves as senior vice president for the office of research, advocacy and legislation at the NCLR, will serve as director for intergovernmental affairs in the Obama administration.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In her new post, Muñoz will be responsible for managing relations between the Obama administration and state and local governments. She is a first-generation American whose parents came to the United States from Bolivia.</p>
<p>Muñoz, 46, said in an essay aired on National Public Radio on Sept. 26, 2005, that the anger sparked by what she considered a racist remark about Latinos made by a friend when she was 17 shaped her successful career as an immigration activist.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bob Dane, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), told CNSNews.com that the director of intergovernmental affairs will play a critical role in the next administration, but it is a role that may be difficult for Muñoz to fulfill, given her background.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her affiliation with La Raza taints her ability to represent the broader national interest,&#8221; Dane said. &#8220;La Raza exists as a way to systematically dismantle enforcement and any semblance of discipline in the immigration system. Are we to believe that she is going to distance herself in her new role to represent the broader national interest?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At a speech at the University of Michigan&rsquo;s Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy in March 2007, Muñoz spoke about how the public, including the media, did not understand the NCLR&rsquo;s goal of economic equity and social justice for immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She said previous attempts at immigration reform in the United States failed because legislation took a &#8220;hostile&rsquo; approach to solving what Muñoz said is &#8220;one of the most important domestic policies of our time.&#8221;</p>
<p>She cited legislation passed in Hazelton, Pa., for example, which made renting property to illegal aliens against the law, and road blocks on Georgia highways &#8220;because local police had gotten into the business of immigration enforcement.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Muñoz said she supported comprehensive immigration reform that required people who are in the United States illegally to come forward, prove they have no criminal record and are paying taxes, pay a fine, start to learn English, and then be put on a path to citizenship that would take about 10 years to complete.</p>

		<p>Better still&hellip;..Vicente Fox (former president of Mexico) needs a job now&hellip;..maybe Obamba can find a spot in his cabinet for him too. Perhaps he would be good for Interior Secretary, since so many Mexicans use the National Parks and public lands to cross the border.</p>

		<p>Had she remained in Mexico this metizo would not have graduated from 8th grade.  Nor would she have been allowed to enter many restaurants, hotels, or even theaters.  If by chance she had enough money for taxi fare, no cab would pick her us. Such is the Mexican discrimination against Indians and Metizos.</p>
<p>But she comes here and the fact that she is non white elevates her to the highest rank.</p>
<p>What a country!!</p>

This is supposed to be a suprise???</p>
<p>Anybody that analyzes this black drip knows full well that his big thing is to create a diversion by appointing honkeies to the high profile positiions, but the secondary ones and below will go to the bruthas and sistahs.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just like the blacks we have on here who come across as reasonable and ready to agree about the need to clean up the black population just in order to get established enough they can pursue their real agendas, which always involved trying to fool whitey someway, hoping to change things to their liking.</p>
<p>The presidential bro will be unknowingly revealing his true stripes very quickly after inaugeration.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t blame Obama, or the blacks for that matter.  This is the doing of White marxists.  Obama is their front man and poster boy.  If you critisize him you are a racist.</p>
<p>Blacks are very wary of the spanish invaders because they are in competition with them for quotas and handouts from the government, and territory in the criminal world, (or rather the non-government criminal world).  White marxists want both groups as clients.  I think they will find that plan will be very, very expensive.</p>

		<p>My guess is that &#8220;managing relationships&#8221; between the Obama administration and state and local governments will include at a high level of priority, among other things, dismantling the hard fought 287(g) programs that have been established in numerous locales througout the country.</p>

<p>You could say the same about most mainstream politicians from Hillary and Obama to Bush and McCain.  It may not be their number one priority, but when they address the issue, their positions are virtually indistinguishable from those of Ms. Munoz.</p>

		<p>Agree with ice &amp; Dave.  Let them have it all.  Let them figure out HOW TO pay/fund the entire mess.  These folks need to realize what it costs US and now that we are BK let them figure out what to do.   We no longer have anything to lose: the country is gone( borders, language &amp; culture), the money/housing/retirements &amp; individual freedoms are gone. All is lost to those we tried to help.  Now it is their turn to work it out.  They may kill US but it is not the first time beasts have killed the goose that lies the golden egg. Credit will be given where it is due.   We all tried our best to sound the alarms but there is no one listening.  TV addiction!      V</p>

Well, the reality is La Raza is a hispanic supremacist organization that exists for the sole purpose of pushing hispanic imperialism and power in the US through the use of shear numbers of hispanic people. Cut down on the numbers of hispanics and their goals get harder to achieve, that is why they demand to have more of say in an Obama administration or any administration that panders to them. Of course, once they achieve their goals they have no use for Obama or anyone that rolled over for them if they aren&rsquo;t hispanic. People like Obama are just tools to be used to further the hispanic supremacist agenda.</p>

Please note that the above article says Muñoz is &#8220;a first-generation American whose parents came to the United States from Bolivia.&#8221; </p>
<p>Not that it&rsquo;s likely to make much difference. Although there are white, pro-American Bolivians, Muñoz is not one of them. She&rsquo;s not Mexican, but if she&rsquo;s in La Raza, she might as well be. She clearly sympathizes with Mexicans far more than with white Americans. </p>
<p>Just like Obama, the man she&rsquo;ll now be calling &#8220;El Jefe.&#8221;  </p>

		<p>6:02 PM Dec. 5 poster  &mdash;  Muñoz is of Bolivian extraction, not Mexican and appears rather white to me. Let&rsquo;s guess that had her parents stayed in Bolivia, she might well be a white activist there in the Santa Cruz region fomenting rebellion against the Evo Morales regime of expropriation.</p>

		<p>So she remembers a remark made by one of her &#8220;friends&#8221; that was racist, and that is why she has become a Mexupremacist.I can remember many, many racist remarks made by a Mexican that I mistakenly thought was my &#8220;friend&#8221; when I was a teenager.Because of one remark, she is helping to hold the door open for more millions of Mexicans to come in and displace us.That is the way they are. They just cant have enough revenge.</p>

		<p>Munoz is the woman I have heard many times say &#8220;We did not cross the border, the border crossed us.&#8221;  She has no respect for U.S. sovereignty, so I can&rsquo;t understand how she could be appointed to such an important post, let alone take the oath with a straight face.</p>

Liberals voice concerns about Obama<br>
By CAROL E. LEE &amp; NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON  AP</p>
<p>Liberals are growing increasingly nervous that President-elect Barack Obama seems to be stiffing them on Cabinet jobs and policy choices.  <br>
 <br>
Liberals are growing increasingly nervous – and some just flat-out angry – that President-elect Barack Obama seems to be stiffing them on Cabinet jobs and policy choices.</p>
<p>Obama has reversed pledges to immediately repeal tax cuts for the wealthy and take on Big Oil. He&rsquo;s hedged his call for a quick drawdown in Iraq. And he&rsquo;s stocking his White House with anything but stalwarts of the left.</p>
<p>Now some are shedding a reluctance to puncture the liberal euphoria at being rid of President George W. Bush to say, in effect, that the new boss looks like the old boss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has confirmed what our suspicions were by surrounding himself with a centrist to right cabinet. But we do hope that before it&rsquo;s all over we can get at least one authentic progressive appointment,&rdquo; said Tim Carpenter, national director of the Progressive Democrats of America.</p>
<p>OpenLeft blogger Chris Bowers went so far as to issue this plaintive plea: &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there ever a point when we can get an actual Democratic administration?&rdquo; </p>
<p>Even supporters make clear they&rsquo;re on the lookout for backsliding. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a concern that he keep his basic promises and people are going to watch him,&rdquo; said Roger Hickey, a co-founder of Campaign for America&rsquo;s Future. <br>

It only works one way, they benefit, we lose&hellip;that&rsquo;s just how it is when you have traitors in power here in the States!!</p>
