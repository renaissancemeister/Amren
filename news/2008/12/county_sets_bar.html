<h1><a href="http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D94RBG180&amp;show_article=1">County Sets &lsquo;Barack Obama Day&rsquo; As New Holiday</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, December 3, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A small central Alabama county whose mainly black residents gave Barack Obama more than 70 percent of the vote on Election Day has created an annual holiday in honor of the president-elect.</p>
<p>The Perry County Commission voted 4 to 1 to observe the second Monday in November as &#8220;The Barack Obama Day.&#8221; County offices will close and its roughly 40 workers will get a paid holiday.</p>
<p>The sponsoring commissioner, Albert Turner Jr., said the holiday is meant to highlight the Democratic president-elect&rsquo;s victory as a way to give people faith that difficult goals can be achieved.</p>
<p>The majority of the county&rsquo;s 12,000 residents are black.</p>
<p>The county commission&rsquo;s three black members and one of its two white members voted for the resolution.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>An Associated Press exit poll found black voters in Alabama almost universally supported Obama while more than eight in 10 whites backed Republican John McCain. McCain carried the state with 60 percent of the vote.<br>

		<p>St. Louis City is considering renaming Delmar Boulevard for Obama.  The major boulevard two places up from it is Martin Luther King Blvd., formerly Easton Blvd.  The major boulevard between them is Page, so if this happens, you&rsquo;ll have boulevards named after two black men surrounding one with a pedestrian name.  For whom will they name it?</p>

		<p>This is only the shape of things to come.  In the South, expect counties and then states to toss Lee-Jackson Day, Jefferson Davis Day and Confederate Memorial Day into the dustbin of history.  We already have Martin Luther King Day and thousands of Martin Luther King Boulevards, Streets, Avenues and Highways.  Why not a Barack Obama Day along with the Obama Freeways, Roads and Avenues?  As the late Sam Francis used to explain, the American Left along with American blacks want to annihilate the historic American nation that they despise so wholeheartedly.</p>

<p>Big deal!</p>
<p>I say let the black fools and their deranged white lickspittles have their wretched little holiday; after all, they are the ones paying for it. The county is majority nonwhite and add the white sycophants into the equation, and I think that few are untouched that do not deserve it here.  </p>
<p>Far more ominous to me is this:</p>
<p>&#8220;An Associated Press exit poll found black voters in Alabama almost universally supported Obama while more than eight in 10 whites backed Republican John McCain. McCain carried the state with 60 percent of the vote.&#8221;</p>
<p>How long will it be, until any election requires 80% of the white vote just to elect the most disgustingly weak and cravenly stupid whites to power?</p>
<p>If things do not change soon, we are doomed!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all?!?<br>

		<p>You know, I understand why blacks would rejoice at having Obama in office, after all it is historic to have a black president of the &#8216;free world&rsquo;. I would rejoice too if  someone who looked like me was elected for the first time. </p>
<p>I would rejoice if a white man was elected to office in S. Africa. The difference that these people don&rsquo;t seem to grasp is that electing a mulatto man through AA isn&rsquo;t that significant and since we are still majority white population with some other races thrown and not majority black like Zimbabwe or S. Africa, he can&rsquo;t do that much damage to our country. There are still checks and balances because of other people so that the black savagery can&rsquo;t undo our civilization,as in Africa, built through millenia of western intelligence and hard work.</p>
<p>The blacks don&rsquo;t want to or are not able to grasp the idea that they themselves as a race have failed to run their own cities and countries. They commit the most crimes, use the most illegal drugs, have the most out of wedlock children, and have the highest rate of AIDS. They are also the poorest and the unhealthiest in any population. They score the lowest in academic tests, IQ tests, and civil service tests. I could go on and on about their problems and failings. The blacks don&rsquo;t understand that they have to mourn their situation, not be arrogant and have high &#8216;self esteem&rsquo; just because a mulatto raised by white people was elected as a president.</p>

		<p>The second Monday in November is usually around Veteran&rsquo;s or Armistice day which is November 11th.  Could this be a way to focus attention on a &#8216;wonderful&rsquo;Black man and get it away from past war&rsquo;s of the  &#8216;evil&rsquo; White man?</p>
<p>By the way did you see the photo, I think it was in the NY Times of Hillary Clinton shaking St. Obama&rsquo;s hand? They were so close to each other that if you didn&rsquo;t know who they were and one looked at them from the waist up, you&rsquo;d think he was about to kiss her.  It was incredible.  These are the subliminal techniques that the media uses to implant the idea of miscegenation in the minds of impressionable White girls.  Now that Obama is going to be President we&rsquo;ll probably see a noticeable increase in White girls and women with Black or dark-skinned men.</p>

<p>My guess would have to be &#8216;Rosa Parks Blvd.&rsquo;. Quite frankly I&rsquo;m surprised we haven&rsquo;t given up Veteran&rsquo;s Day for Rosa Parks Day yet.</p>

		<p>Good. Soon there will be another street name I&rsquo;m sure to avoid if I&rsquo;m lost. When someone tells you, &#8220;Make a left at Martin Luther King Boulevard, then turn right at Malcom X Drive, and then take the turn off to Barack Obama Avenue,&#8221; you need to head in the opposite direction.</p>

		<p>The madness continues.  He isn&rsquo;t even president yet, his incompetency has yet to have had a chance to blossom, and already people are treating him like the second coming.  Obama has apparently selected Janet Napolitano as head of homeland security.  Napolitano is very much against enforcing immigration law so this will be an utter disaster.  </p>

		<p>I find it very strange that there is a rush to change street and school names to Obama when no other Presidents have their own day now. No more Washington or Lincoln holidays, it&rsquo;s all just lumped under &#8220;President&rsquo;s Day.&#8221; Surely, Obama can be in that group or perhaps we can substitute his name for one of the MLK avenues, boulevards, streets, roads, drive, courts or lanes.</p>

		<p>Yea in Charlotte NC in 2006 the downtown 4 lane street named for Stonewall Jackson over 100 yrs ago was changed to Dr.(make sure you always use Dr. in front) Martin Luther King Blvd and just conveniently the public school system main office is on this major street in the inner city.<br>
They also discovered a black female on the school board for ages was fixing her address district and didnt live there and she also called herself Dr. Velma Leak but it was discovered she never went to grad school much less had her PHD so she had to drop that. <br>
They also discovered the new black police chief Rodney Monroe had some black pals at VCU fix his degree and he had lied about it but some Va state legislators were trying to get it erased from existence although ex-Va gov. and Richmond mayor Doug Wilder was supporting Monroe every step of the way.<br>
Seems the chief had a matchnbook cover degree from Phoenix and failed to complete the 30 hr requirement his senior year a couple years ago and only had a total of 9 hrs from VCU but some insiders fixed it to 30 hrs.<br>
This has been caught by the city now but nothing will change because they are scared to fire him for lying.<br>
Monroe still sticks to his lie and says VCU gave him a degree so he didnt question why or how.</p>

<p>Ha ha, that is the truth, I have probably been &#8220;corrected&#8221; about a dozen times by blacks in my life for not paying their man-god the proper respect by referring to him by his proper title.  I think the next time someone corrects me, I am going to get indignant and demand, that if having a PhD in theology merits the title &#8220;Doctor&#8221; than I also demand to be called &#8220;Doctor&#8221; because I have actually do have a Juris Doctorate (law degree).</p>
<p>My whole childhood I had a running joke with my dad, who has a Phd in Physics that whenever somebody would call for him asking for him referring to him as &#8220;Doctor&#8221; he would chuckle and tell me to hang up the phone because it was always the Alumni Association trying to squeeze another contribution from him.<br>

Yep, and I predict that we are going to be seeing a whole rash of name changes in the future.    (Is this the &#8220;Change&#8221; that he promised us?)</p>

<p>Actually I hope they name a lot of things after Obama. I can&rsquo;t wait to see how many of those place names will be changed by the time he&rsquo; been in office a year.</p>

<p>I refuse to use the prefix &#8220;Dr.&#8221; for Martin Luther King for the simple reason that his PhD was obtained by fraud.  He plagiarized substantial portions of his thesis.<br>

		<p>All the PhDs that I know find it arrogant to use &#8220;Dr.&#8221; in front of their name.  I too have a law degree, but I would never use the title &#8220;Dr.&#8221;   However, unlike MLK, I actually did the work to earn my degree.  I am also convinced that a Phd in theology is a relatively easy doctorate to get.  I mean, the work has got to be quite subjective.  </p>

		<p>Here in Cleveland, the mostly black city council is already salivating over changing the names of schools, roads and whatnot to &#8220;Obama&#8221;.  The funny thing is, no matter what these people do, how many holidays, name changes and other forms of worship they bestow upon their &#8220;redeemer&#8221;, when they wake up the next day, their lives will be the same miserable, self-created messes that they were the day before!  The crime rate will keep growing, the roads will keep decaying and the city government will still be corrupt.  Cleveland should be an example to the rest of America of what happens when you let blacks rule a major American city for two decades.  Utter chaos, no money, crumbling infrastructure, high crime and destitution are what we have to show for our &#8220;diversity.&#8221;</p>
