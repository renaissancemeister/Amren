<h1><a href="https://www.worldnetdaily.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=84873">Illegal Baby Boom Hits Big Easy</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chelsea Schilling, WorldNetDaily, December 29, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The New Orleans Economic Development office estimates the city&rsquo;s Hispanic population has more than tripled since Hurricane Katrina devastated the city. It has risen from 15,000, or 3.3 percent of pre-Katrina residents, to 50,000, or 15 percent of today&rsquo;s population.</p>
<p>Tulane University and the University of California, Berkeley, released a 2006 study revealing that almost half of the city&rsquo;s construction labor force was Hispanic. At least 54 percent were found to be illegal aliens, and 90 percent had lived elsewhere in the U.S. before migrating to New Orleans.</p>
<p>As WND reported earlier, News reports indicate a flood of illegal aliens is moving South from states such as Arizona and Oklahoma &mdash; where immigration crackdowns have made life more difficult for them, and the slow housing market has made jobs scarce. In New Orleans, families are multiplying faster than hospitals and schools can accommodate them.</p>
<p><b>Overcrowded hospitals and schools</b></p>
<p>The Associated Press interviewed Kevin Work, a doctor who opened new prenatal offices and hired bilingual employees so he could make a living delivering New Orleans&rsquo; Hispanic babies.</p>
<p>He performs &#8220;thirty to forty deliveries a month,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Work told the AP he has helped illegal alien mothers give birth to at least 1,000 babies since the storm hit in August 2005. He said he provides payment plans to help the families afford the births, or they are covered by government programs such as Medicaid.</p>
<p>In 2004, Emergency Medicaid cost taxpayers $1.7 million in Metro New Orleans, according to the report. Now the government program covers five times as many people, and the cost is more than 4.5 times what it used to be &mdash; at $7.8 million.</p>
<p>Likewise, schools are having trouble keeping up.</p>
<p>Director Melinda Martinez of a Esperanza Charter School, a taxpayer-funded English-immersion institution in New Orleans, told the AP her elementary school doesn&rsquo;t ask about immigration status.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Soaring crime statistics</b></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the city&rsquo;s streets have reportedly become some of the most dangerous places in the nation. A study conducted by Congressional Quarterly recently labeled New Orleans the most violent city in the U.S. Likewise, Foreign Policylisted it as third among its top five &#8220;murder capitals&#8221; of the world &mdash; behind only Caracas, Venezuela and Cape Town, South Africa.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Even during the city&rsquo;s legendary Mardi Gras celebration this year, four people were murdered and a dozen were wounded by gunshots, according to EMS Responder. Foreign Policy reports there has also been a surge of drug-related violence since Hurricane Katrina.</p>

		<p>Okay, only three quick points on this and I will have said my piece.</p>
<p>First, regarding:</p>
<p>&#8220;In 2004, Emergency Medicaid cost taxpayers $1.7 million in Metro New Orleans, according to the report. Now the government program covers five times as many people, and the cost is more than 4.5 times what it used to be &mdash; at $7.8 million.&#8221;</p>
<p>How can this be?</p>
<p>If Metro New Orleans is being &#8220;enriched&#8221; by these &#8220;undocumented migrants,&#8221; how can costs in these areas be going up? If anything, they should be lowering as if by an unquestioned and logical axiom. </p>
<p>If &#8220;diversity is our strength&#8221; and we are &#8220;enriched&#8221; by it, then it must only bring reduced negatives in both public and private expenses. If anything, profits and surpluses should be just bursting out all over the place, like water through a sieve or their levees in Metro New Orleans.</p>
<p>Second, regarding: </p>
<p>&#8220;Meanwhile, the city&rsquo;s streets have reportedly become some of the most dangerous places in the nation. A study conducted by Congressional Quarterly recently labeled New Orleans the most violent city in the U.S.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again, how can this be?</p>
<p>With their ever so superior &#8220;Hispanic family values&#8221; being infused there so rapidly, should not Metro New Orleans be experiencing something so wholesome and genteel, that June Cleaver or Queen Victoria might be ashamed of their own wantonness? I am honestly perplexed here; why is not this city the safest on the face of the earth?</p>
<p>Well, you know me, I come from Detroit and really do have unrealistically utopian expectations at times!</p>
<p>Third and last, is in regards to this:</p>
<p>&#8220;Work told the AP he has helped illegal alien mothers give birth to at least 1,000 babies since the storm hit in August 2005. He said he provides payment plans to help the families afford the births, or they are covered by government programs such as Medicaid.&#8221;</p>
<p>How soothingly &#8220;humanitarian&#8221; of Dr. Work?</p>
<p>Enough said on that point!!!</p>

		<p>Hispanics REALLY crank out the babies, don&rsquo;t they?  They are weird, weird people.  The ones we get here all look, dress, and act alike.  I don&rsquo;t see any of the individuality that we whites enjoy, with our plethora of personality types.</p>

A great deal of the housing was claimed to have been affected by the hurricane. As a result, a large percentage of the affected population was forced to move.</p>
<p>Where did they find housing for hispanic workers? How were these hispanic workers found and relocated? Who was behind this relocation? Was anything done to find non-hispanic workers?</p>

		<p>Doncha love it? That endless line of propaganda that immigrants actually are GOOD for the economy. Then why, pray tell, is every city (or state) receiving a large influx of illegal immigrants suddenly overwhelmed with demands for welfare, free healthcare, in addition to having their public school systems overburdened and dumbed down by Hispanics?</p>
<p>California&rsquo;s financial woes were in the news recently&hellip; with Arnold pleading for a federal bailout for California. Care to speculate how much the vast number of illegals and their anchor babies infest California and thus contribute to California&rsquo;s status of near-bankruptcy?</p>

		<p>One of the first babies born in Dallas on New Year&rsquo;s Day was to a 15 year old, unmarried Hispanic girl. Her boyfriend and father of the baby is 20. I think there is some law that could apply to this scenario. She is in middle school, and will be home-schooled (?) until she can go back while her mother and another relative care for the baby. </p>
<p>By the way, many blame the outstanding Hispanic birth rate is due to the fact of Hispanics being Catholic. Forget it. It&rsquo;s mostly the &#8220;macho&#8221; image the men want to preserve. </p>

		<p>Some additional &#8216;food for thought.&rsquo; Next time you visit an business office, count the Hispanic faces you see. Then reflect these often are the adult &#8220;anchor babies&#8221; of illegals. That these adult anchor babies are competing with and STEALING jobs that rightfully should go to Americans&hellip; NOT to the offspring of illegal aliens!</p>

		<p>Predictably, the pro-immigration activists will crawl out from under their rocks and decry the claim: &#8220;Illegal immigration HURTS Americans!&#8221;</p>
<p>The hard, inarguable truth being that immigration DOES HURT Americans in a variety of ways. The least of which being the stupendous DOLLAR COST to American citizens/taxpayers. Damned few illegal immigrants have health care insurance; few still the money to PAY for pre- and post-birthing medical costs. Result is the hospitals get stuck&hellip; and ultimately the hospitals get subsidized by our Taxpayers! </p>
<p>Also, all too often, the now adult anchor babies of illegals, compete head-on with legitimate Americans in the ever shrinking job market! But don&rsquo;t hold your breath waiting for immigration activists or our corrupt politiicans to acknowledge this inconvenient little truth.</p>
<p>Crimes, of every kind, can also be attributed to illegal immigrants, as well as to their offspring. California&rsquo;s notorious crime problem&hellip; a good testimony to this claim. That ready propensity of illegal aliens to also do crimes explains WHY our federal government is so anxious to categorize Latino criminals as White or Caucausian when compiling crime stats for public consumption. (That Clintonesque &#8220;mother knows best&#8221; philosphy&hellip; why make our citzens aware of how bad the illegal immigrant crime picture REALLY is.)</p>
<p>Finally, we can&rsquo;t overlook the social problems caused by our immigration policy gone haywire. I mean who wouldn&rsquo;t LOVE to live next door to a rental house&hellip; occupied by four (4) Mexican families and their broods&hellip; or worse yet, 18 or 20 Latino males&hellip; with their nightly drunken racket, traffic, and strange characters eyeing the Anglo neighbors&hellip; as if casing the scene for their next burglary or robbery.</p>

		<p>When employers are fined for employing illegal aliens [and it is enforced] the river will become dry. Mexicans [and Central Americans] are in New Orleans to do the work that whites and blacks either can&rsquo;t, or at least, won&rsquo;t do. Wala! When the economy continues to tank, which it will for at least the next year,the Mexicans will be voluntarily returning to Mexico!</p>
<p>And yes, New Orleans has crime! A lot of crime! The last time I was in New Orleans [about a month ago] I was walking down the quarter at night with my wife when I were approached by three young black males who crossed the street to come at us from behind. They eyed me expectantly when I turned around; and then, after the customary: &#8220;Hey Man whats happening?&#8221; I responded that it made me nervous to have people cross the street in order to come at me from behind late at night. It was a tense moment! It was obvious! If I had shown fear I would have attacked. Apparently they felt that it would have taken more than three black kids to take on this old white guy [and at least for once, they were right]. They decided to keep on walking. Within in ten minutes we ran into a black cop and explained to what had happened. He responded: &#8220;well, you all weren&rsquo;t hurt were you what makes you think that they were going to rob you?&#8221; Hmmmm. </p>
<p>New Orleans is a cess pool which acts as a Southern exemplar for all other major cities in which blacks play a significant role. New Orleans is a harbinger of things to come. Bad things! Irrespective of how much politically correct bilge is water boarded down Joe Six Pack&rsquo;s throat, he, along with anyone else who has ever dealt with the average black or brown person on a regular basis knows that they will never be white or even act white. In my view every person certainly has the right to progress as far as he or she is able but not at the unfair expense of someone else.</p>
<p>The difference between the reader here and the public as a whole is that this site deals in reality not fiction. For that, all of us can be rightly criticized as being politically incorrect. But as philosopher Pierce once said: &#8220;in an insane world the sane are considered insane&#8221;.</p>

I would like to know this too.  How come the Mexicans can live where the blacks can&rsquo;t?  </p>
