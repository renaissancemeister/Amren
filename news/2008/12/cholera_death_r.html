			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dan Roodt, praag.co.uk (United Kingdom), December 4, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Just yesterday the European Union announced 9 million euros of aid money destined for Zimbabwe. Since 2002 the EU had actually donated 500 million euros (about $600 million or R6,5 billion) to Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>Since the year 2000 the ruling party in Zimbabwe has been ethnically cleansing whites and especially white farmers from that country. Whites were vilified and physically attacked. Their houses were ransacked or burnt down and their property confiscated without compensation. Some of them, at least twenty, were murdered by black mobs known as &#8220;war veterans&#8221;.</p>
<p>I have yet to come across a single announcement by a Western diplomat or government official denouncing the specific actions taken by the Mugabe government or its supporters against the white Zimbabweans. Although the Zimbabwean strongman has been criticised on various other counts, for rigging elections, not allowing a free press in his country, economic mismanagement and hyperinflation, and so on, no-one has dared to speak out against his treatment of the white minority in his country.</p>
<p>And during all this time, a steady avalanche of euros rivalling the Victoria Waterfall in the north of the country have been inundating Zimbabwe, courtesy of the European Union.</p>
<p>Here in South Africa, European diplomats are something of a joke, especially their cultural representatives such as the German Goethe Institute. That august body recently awarded a prize of 10 000 euros to a South African Indian who proposed an art project in which he would document stolen supermarket trolleys being used to ferry goods between African minibus taxis in central Johannesburg.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I was recently told that holding a lecture near the Goethe Institute on the subject of relations between Bismarck and the old Boer republic of the Transvaal at the end of the nineteenth century was offensive. A friend who moves in diplomatic circles in Pretoria was of the opinion that &#8220;it would have reminded the Germans that their history had not actually started in 1945&#8221;.</p>
<p>Nietzsche wrote about the slave morality of the West and I must say, looking at the dapper, debonair Mugabe strutting about in front of the cameras, he cuts a masterly figure compared to his European slaves. No matter what Mugabe does, both the US and the EU will always respect his country&rsquo;s sovereignty and keep on doling out aid money to prop up his regime.</p>
<p>Zimbabwe is hardly the picture of so-called &#8220;good governance&#8221;, with inflation running at several 100 million percent and a cholera epidemic killing several hundred people. However, such conditions in Zimbabwe have not dissuaded either the US or the EU from aggressively promoting so-called &#8220;land reform&#8221; in South Africa.</p>
<p>Although farm murders have already claimed 3000 victims in South Africa and plunged many rural areas into fear and paralysis, both European embassies and church groups are funding anti-white hate groups with slogans like &#8220;Africa for the Africans&#8221; (in a racial sense) and &#8220;kill a Boer, kill a farmer&#8221;. When farmers and agricultural experts voice their misgivings over South Africa&rsquo;s land-reform policy that has already laid waste thousands of formerly productive farms as documented by Dr. Philip du Toit in his book The Great South African Land Scandal, they are routinely accused of &#8220;racism&#8221; by left-wing organisations such as Nkuzi Development and PLAAS (Programme for Land and Agrarian Studies).</p>
<p>Both Nkuzi and PLAAS are funded by European embassies and church groups, with the Ford Foundation providing an American source of money for promoting animus against South African farmers.</p>
<p>The ultimate reason why Mugabe looks so confident in front of the TV cameras is that he knows that the US and EU are on his side in taking over formerly white-owned farms, even if it meant transforming his country into a famine- and disease-ridden hell-hole. Despite being criticised for his recent actions against the MDC opposition, he is normally commended by both American and European diplomats and media commentators for his anti-white land-reform policy.</p>
<p>It is almost comical to read about Mugabe on the BBC&rsquo;s homepage or in the New York Times where he is routinely described as &#8220;an African liberation hero&#8221; or a &#8220;hero of the anti-colonial struggle&#8221;.</p>
<p>Mugabe knows he is the master of every Bob Geldof-imitating do-gooder liberal white in Europe or North America. Not only do they continue to shower him and his regime with money, but the spectacle of their guilt-ridden handwringing over the &#8220;tragic&#8221; situation in Zimbabwe must provide him with no end of private mirth.</p>
<p>Every time Mugabe in his latest Savile Row suit and bespoke shirt smiles at the media, he must be thinking: &#8220;Just keep on sending those aid dollars, you white idiots, so that we can fill up the tanks of our armoured black Mercedeses.&#8221;</p>
<p>One has to hand it to the Germans. Apart from considering stolen supermarket trolleys as prize-winning art (as long as they get stolen by blacks), Daimler Benz AG has been pandering to the motoring desires of African dictators for such a long time now that the S-class Mercedes has become the ultimate African icon.</p>
<p>To paraphrase a South American novelist: in a time of cholera you can still love your Merc.<br>

						<p>
							<i>Richard Lapper, Financial Times, December 2, 2008</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>A sharp rise in the death toll from cholera has added new urgency to the humanitarian disaster in Zimbabwe, amid fresh signs that the provision of transport and public services is close to collapse.</p>
<p>Relief workers said yesterday that with hyperinflation, many nurses, doctors and health workers could no longer afford to pay for the bus or taxi to reach cholera treatment centres. More than four times as many people were dying from this outbreak of cholera than was typically the case, said relief workers.</p>
<p>In a sign that the economic crisis may be starting to affect the props of President Robert Mugabe&rsquo;s repressive regime, about 50 soldiers are reported to have looted shops, attacked traders and clashed with police after queuing to withdraw virtually worthless Zimbabwean dollars from banks on Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;They had to vent their anger in some way,&#8221; said Itai Zimunya, of the Open Society&rsquo;s Zimbabwe project in Johannesburg. &#8220;The state has begun to fail. There is no government.&#8221;</p>
<p>The numbers released yesterday by the World Health Organisation indicated that the cholera epidemic was spreading rapidly, with nearly 11,000 people contracting the illness in the past three weeks. During the same period 400 people died, bringing the total death toll to 484 and indicating that Zimbabwean cholera sufferers are losing their lives at four times the standard rate in a cholera epidemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Cholera] is accelerating at an alarming pace,&#8221; said Tsitsi Singizi, information officer at the United Nations Children&rsquo;s Fund (Unicef), which is co-ordinating relief work on water and sanitation. Relief workers said the near breakdown of urban water systems in Harare and other cities was another important factor contributing to the scale and intensity of the disaster.</p>
<p>&#8220;Water infrastructure has deteriorated significantly,&#8221; said Oxfam, the UK agency. &#8220;Sewage pipes are now leaking directly into drinking water. The infrastructure has been crippled.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shortages of chemicals needed to treat water have also hit services. The managers of Harare&rsquo;s Morton Jaffray water works stopped pumping on Monday, mainly &mdash; according to the progovernment newspaper, The Herald &mdash; because of shortages of aluminium sulphate, one of four chemicals used to treat water. There were reports yesterday that the service had been resumed, at least partially.</p>
<p>The cholera outbreak comes as Zimbabwe remains no closer to forming a government, with the opposition Movement for Democratic Change refusing to share the crucial home affairs ministry that controls the police. The MDC reached broad agreement on a coalition government more than two months ago. The party won a narrow majority in elections in March but withdrew from the second round of a presidential contest after widespread violence against its supporters.</p>
<p>Supporters of the governing Zanu-PF, who blame the MDC for the paralysis, have been preparing to attend their scheduled annual conference next week, the first to take place following the defection of party members formerly loyal to Zapu, a rival liberation movement that merged with Zanu-PF in 1987. Zapu&rsquo;s principal strength is in the eastern Matabeleland.</p>
<p>In a surreal twist, The Herald yesterday reported that Zanu-PF militants from Mashonaland East had pledged 500 quintillion Zimbabwe dollars so that the event could be held.</p>
<p>Relief agencies are concerned that disease could spread as the rainy season gets under way this month. More rain is likely to increase the extent to which drinking water supplies become contaminated.</p>
<p>Charles Abani, regional director for Oxfam in southern Africa, warned last week that &#8220;with the rainy season looming&#8221; the government needed to &#8220;recognise fully the extent of the crisis&#8221; and &#8220;mobilise all available resources&#8221;. Oxfam increased its estimate of those likely to catch the disease before the end of March from 20,000 to 60,000.<br>

		<p>I could not be more delighted to learn that Dan Roodt is now offering an English language website! Regular AR readers will remember, of course, that he spoke at the 2006 conference, and will know that his Afrikaans website www.praag.co.za/ has long been linked to by AR. While I sympathize with Dr. Roodt&rsquo;s campaign on behalf of his threatened language Afrikaans, the events taking place in Southern Africa now are too important not to be publicized in English as well. I expect this will be a site worth frequent visiting.</p>

		<p>Patience, my friends.  The whole damned liberal chimera is going to vanish in a maelstrom of hate and violence.  It is only a matter of time.  I feel sorry for the whites who are going to die in this thing, but it would appear that total collapse of both white and black society on both continents is the only way out.  The cream will rise to the top.</p>

		<p>I think we should create a 12-step program for white do-gooders. I&rsquo;m positive it&rsquo;s an addiction, just like alcohol or drug addiction.  Even though the rational mind knows it&rsquo;s not good, you have to keep getting that high.  I have no other explanation for there crazy behavior other then when they vote for Obama, urge the government to more and more African aid, affirmative action and of course endlessly talk about there do-gooder deeds, it releases endorphins in the brain so they have to keep doing it to get there high.   </p>
<p>What is truly horrible about this is more aid equals more babies born into this morass.  A well known correlation.  Which makes these do-gooders truly evil as they solve nothing and actually bring more misery and death into the world.  </p>
<p>However this is also an opening for us, as the depression deepens we needed to aggressively hold every  politician he wants keep sending foreign aid feet to the fire.   How can you keep sending aid when we have ever increasing unemployment rate here etc?</p>

<p>When I was a child, my mother told me how after the fall of Rome the Visigoths would build open fires in the middle of the beautiful decorated floors, staining them for us to see 2000 years later, because they did not understand how to operate the central heating systems the Roman architects had built into the floor, common in Late Roman homes. The idea of heat passing through copper ducts to warm the floor was too much for the Visigoths to understand. She told me how the aqueducts gradually fell into disrepair stopping the clean cold mountain water that flowed into the city so that thirst, unknown for generations, became common. Water wells were dug by the dwindling population but they turned foul and use of waterskins would spread disease.</p>
<p>Here we have the modern parallel, Electric power is irregular as the generators are not maintained and the lines are either corroded or stolen, stripped for their copper by the population. A fresh water system that requires basic skills to maintain and aluminum sulfate to septic; yet is too complex for the modern equivalent of the Visigoths to run, let alone build. All basic services we take for granted, are fast disappearing in Rhodesia, with South Africa about 5 years behind, but following a similar path.</p>

		<p>Great article by Dan Roodt - he actually says Mugabe is playing Western whites for suckers, This article also explains how Mugabe is able to keep his grip on power.</p>
<p>More of American taxpayer dollars flushed down the latrine known as Zimbabwe. And meanwhgile, they debate whether to help out our economy.</p>
<p>Let a hundred flowers bloom over Zimbabwe&rsquo;s grave. Let a hundred jackals contest over her remains. </p>

		<p>Gun Runner   &mdash;   excellent point about ancient Rome.  I visited the ruined port city of Ostia (Rome&rsquo;s ancient seaport) a couple years ago and remember hearing much the same story: a city of 50,000, with aqueducts piping in fresh water, an advanced sewer system, theaters, libraries, baths, commerce, industry, and an educated population with many lawyers, doctors and businessmen.  </p>
<p>First the grain ships from Egypt stopped coming; then, one day, the aqueduct stopped working after 500 years of operation and was never repaired; earthquakes knocked down most of the great apartment buildings, and inhabitants started living in the half-ruined second stories, the roads being covered in rubble up to the second floor.  The sewers became blocked and diseases, long dormant, reappeared.  By the time Saracen pirates showed up in the 700s, the remaining residents had converted the theater, where the plays of Sophocles and Euripides were once performed, into a fortress by filling in the graceful arches with crude masonry. </p>
<p>The few living descendants of those proud Romans who had imported shiploads of Egyptian wheat to feed the million inhabitants of Rome ended up as illiterate peasants, clinging to a mean existence in the ruins of a once-mighty city.  The last were carried off into slavery by Muslim raiders sailing from what had once been the Roman, and Christian, provinces of Africa and Numidia.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fitting story to remember in the context of Zimbabwe and other African nations.  We have learned to accept progress as a norm, as an inevitable fact of life, but history often tells us otherwise.</p>

		<p>  The U.S. will always back tyranny in Zimbabwe and South Africa. And this is why I have lost all patriotism for this country. The United States is not the red, white, and blue, apple pie, mom, and Chevrolet. It is a conglomerate of big businesses owned by foreign nationals. We, the people, are the cannon fodder. This country is steeped in greed. The U.S. will always back tyranny, as it has always done. It set up puppet regimes all around the world. We have troops scattered around the globe in harms way for no reason, yet we cannot protect our own borders. We are &#8220;liberating&#8221; the middle east, and yet we have millions homeless, some by choice, most are not by choice. We have hungry people in this country, some you hear about, other like the white people in Appalachia, you don&rsquo;t hear about. We must stop sending our young to fight foreign wars that should be fought by their own people. I really don&rsquo;t believe that obama was elected by the people. I think it was given to him because he will fulfill the needs of the business people and the power brokers. And to Hell with we, the people. That, my friends, is America today. I will not send my young to fight for this country. I fought for it, and got a good education about the reasons for wars. If you are attacked,then fight. Don&rsquo;t go looking for someplace to test your latest weaponry. None of these countries we are &#8220;liberating&#8221; will not appreciate us for the sacrifices we made.  </p>

		<p>At first, I thought it was simple narcissism motivating western politicians and &#8216;religious leaders&rsquo; to work against the interests of their white constituents and the white world within which they live.  But after reading this, I can only conclude that these &#8216;leaders&rsquo; are full-blown PSYCHOPATHS.  </p>
<p>Needing to hurt one&rsquo;s own so badly, and needing to destroy the very world one lives in: that&rsquo;s just plain insanity.  Hitler and Pol Pot were only the tip of the iceberg.  Apparently, politics and religion are rife with people just as crazy.</p>
<p>Our only hope is to expose these deranged individuals, one by one, for what they are.  There are surely psychologists here on our side who can analyze these individuals.  We have spin-doctors who can frame the analyses with winning words.  Let us expose each psycho-politico, as an individual. </p>

<p>Thank you for phrasing and explaining so succinctly.  I was unable to reduce the situation into a soundbyte-sized concept.  You&rsquo;re entirely right, and most important, you&rsquo;ve given me something I can use to persuade others.  I knew all the parts, but you put the puzzle parts together brilliantly.</p>
<p>To Ed in Indianapolis:  When my Volvo was totaled in August, I was forced to replace it.  After reading that the big three automakers had acted as &#8216;friends of the court&rsquo; and supported the extension of affirmative action&hellip;actually intervened to preserve something so vile, I felt no need to show them any loyalty.</p>
<p>Previously, I&rsquo;d avoided buying a car from a third-axis nation, but with Volvo and Saab now owned by Detroit, my options were slim.  Detroit has never shown any loyalty to the American People, so why show loyalty to them?  Since then, I&rsquo;ve felt guilt over buying a Lexus.  Thanks for highlighting that Ford supports PLAAS and Nkuzzi.  Now, I feel no guilt at all.  The Irony of Ford using giant, ultra-white Toby Keith as an icon of big-truck-manliness, while supporting groups intent upon murdering people who look like him. Oy!</p>
<p>Now, every time I see big, strapping Toby, I&rsquo;ll recall the image of a young, white South African farmer, hung over his bathtub (by &#8216;revolutionaries&rsquo;) with a strand of barbed wire.  how many white farmers have helped finance their own eventual murder by buying into the big-truck-manhood mythos?<br>
