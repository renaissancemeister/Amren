<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Like Americans of all other nationalities, we need a flag in addition to &lsquo;Old Glory.&rsquo; This flag represents African Americans and America with dignity. It stifles debate about where we fit and presents an opportunity for unity and cooperative ventures.</p>
<p><b><big>Middle Passage Flag</big></b><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="left">  <tr>    <td align="center"><img src="/news/2008/12/22/flags1.jpg" alt="UFOlogo"><img src="/illustrativeArticles/images/spacer.gif" width="12" height="125" valign="bottom"></td></tr></table>Dominated by green and black, the Middle Passage flag honors those ancestors who rebelled, were tortured, brutalized and died in the crossing. These prisoners on slave ships were in their youth as individuals and as blood lines. Green is a color which, among other things often symbolizes youth in African cultures. In this flag, green also reflects the energy of the captive and portrays a resiliently stubborn yearning for the native land. Those who died in the Middle Passage were never to be transformed. They remained African in every sense and this is represented by the dominance of black in the Middle Passage flag. The red stars remind us that we must be guided by the light of their blood buried and mingled in the deep dark depths of the ocean.</p>
<p>The Middle Passage flag is sometimes used for funeral ceremonies to honor ancestors in their final passage as it honors those of the Middle Passage.</p>
<p>The Middle Passage flag has a black field (union) on which there are red stars. This union represents that which most unites us around the world-our Africaness. The red stars represent the blood of the best of people which has been spilled in our centuries long struggle for survival and independence.</p>
<p>In the tradition of Marcus Garvey, red stands for the blood of the people shed in struggle, black for the people themselves and green for the youth and new ideas.</p>
<p>In addition to the &#8220;Middle Passage&#8221; flag, there are two other flags in the &#8220;All American&#8221; series. They are the Mainlander and the Islander flags. If possible, possess and display each flag from time to time to deepen our consciousness and expression of unity.</p>

<p>And it stands for hustlers and con-artists who thus spend a little bit of time as a guest of Uncle Sam.  I can&rsquo;t understand why America&rsquo;s black population thinks they need another flag, when Haiti has a perfectly good one.  It, too, like this flag they are proposing, is a symbol of racial jealousy, revolution and retribution.  But it&rsquo;s also the symbol of the poorest nation in the western hemisphere.  Coincidence, methinks not.</p>

		<p>As always, I fully applaud such activities by Blacks. The more they continue to separate themselves, always pointing out how different, how unique their &#8220;experiences&#8221; are and were, the better! It all just reinforces the fact that racially mixed society will always be a tense and seperate one - Blacks miss no opportunity to show themselves unlike us&hellip;so we should encourage this!</p>

More than once I have written to white organizations recommending that we create a flag that represents the idea of racial loyalty; one that is not a representation of any one particular organization, location, religion or policy.  Only one ideal, white racial loyalty that can be used in all nations by all white people.  </p>
<p>So where is it?  We can&rsquo;t even do this?  Maybe I should get one of these black flags, I might as well be on the winning side.  <br>

Since before the election, I&rsquo;ve heard blacks increasing question why the White House is called the White House.</p>
<p>Although most AR readers can see the obvious, blacks see it as a statement that the White House has the name because it was only meant to be occupied by whites.</p>
<p>The word on black talk radio is to refer to it as The Peoples House.<br>

		<p>Red, white and blue would be appropriate colors for Africans.  Red:  For all the bloodshed and violence they commit around the world.  White:  If they had the civility, manners and intelligence of whites, they would be much more successful as a people.  And Blue:  which is how I feel from all their constant whining and complaining.</p>

<p>You know, normally before I comment on articles here at AR, I read them thoroughly; more often than not, hitting the unedited originals. With this one, I didn&rsquo;t need to or feel the urge to dignify it by doing so.</p>
<p>The title of this &#8220;publication,&#8221; pretty much sums this up for me:</p>
<p>&#8220;Us for Once&#8221;</p>
<p>But why not, &#8220;Yes We Can?&#8221;</p>
<p>I have had enough of this kind of garbage; this &#8220;idea,&#8221; that blacks must somehow find yet another &#8220;American&#8221; identity that makes them ever so special because they: &#8220;were tortured, brutalized and died in the crossing,&#8221; into their natural slave status here in the USA. They are not &#8220;special&#8221; and once freed from &#8220;bondage,&#8221; have basically proved themselves to be utterly worthless and an ever growing financial strain on this country. Deep down they know this, straight to the marrow of their bones.</p>
<p>Why else do they become so desperately truculent, when it is suggested that along with &#8220;reparations,&#8221; they also should be repatriated back to &#8220;Mother Africa,&#8221; as their secondary prize?</p>
<p>We all know why; it is because instead of having nonsense such as these &#8220;flags&#8221; being their primary concern, along with sticking it to whitey, they might actually have to fend for themselves or be mauled by their African &#8220;brothers and sisters.&#8221; </p>
<p>What would they call that and what kind of &#8220;flag&#8221; would represent such?</p>
<p>The Flag of Mother Africa&rsquo;s Passage?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!<br>

<p>I&rsquo;m loving the Orwellian double talk:<br>
How would the &#8220;Middle Passage&#8221; flag, based on events entirely specific to a single race, &#8220;unify&#8221; European/&#8221;Hispanic&#8221;/Asian etc Americans? What about a &#8220;Pioneering&#8221; flag, for all those European-Americans that perished pushing the frontiers of the United States, settling land, ploughing farms, building cities?</p>
<p>Oh, right: &#8220;Racist!&#8221; etc etc.</p>

		<p>Blacks, generally, are so caught up in a separatist agenda they want no part of any other group, which I think is fine, because I certainly agree that they should remain separate, with their own flag, their own motto, their own government, their own territory, right along with their silly national anthem.</p>
<p>They should change their motto, however, from &#8220;It&rsquo;s us for once,&#8221; to &#8220;It&rsquo;s us as usual,&#8221; or UAU.</p>
<p>Most of the Hispanics want to fly the Mex flag in their front yards and hang it on the wall at work, denoting their separatism and rejection of our culture, flag, language, and traditions.</p>
<p>All in all we have a nation of tribes that want to change everything to reflect everything about themselves, which is perfectly in line with human nature and exactly why this country is going to implode into a mass of racial conflicts.</p>
<p>Diversity is not a strength it&rsquo;s a very dangerous weakness.</p>

<p>Hmmm, I seem to be detecting quite a bit of bitterness towards the U.S. and its history. Perhaps they should add one more element to their flag: arrows, denoting the mass return of blacks to their original homeland.  Would this not be the ultimate vindication for blacks who were so cruelly snatched away? </p>
<p>No I think not, as denoted by this passage:</p>
<p><i>that which most unites us around the world-our Africaness.</i></p>
<p>From this, it sounds to me like their ultimate goal is to turn the entire world into what could only be called &#8220;Greater Africa.&#8221; Sweet revenge indeed against the White man, is it not?</p>

		<p>I call for another &#8220;middle passage&#8221;. This time also free of cost, but on nice cruise ships. Disembark the passengers at the very same, historic spots where their many, many times removed great grandparents once debarked for the western world. Remind them this is a one-way-only trip, and let them go their merry way, doing whatever it is they do in Africa. Repeat as many times as it takes to de-populate Americas ghettoes. DO NOT send any aid to Africa, or all anyone, except persecuted whites, to emmigrate from Africa, also.</p>

		<p>Funny how blacks always talk about the &#8220;passage&#8221; but they never choose to go back to Africa. They are free to correct the injustice of slavery by taking the &#8220;passage&#8221; back to Africa anytime they want to, but choose not to do so. Likewise blacks choose to immigrate to White countries like Canada and Britain instead of Africa.</p>

<p>There is one. It&rsquo;s green, white and blue. A Northwest passage flag of some kind. So this one represents the Pacific Northwest and some preservationists idea of an all white country there.

		<p>Blacks are the most racially-aware people on the planet. Every waking moment is spent by some exploring so-called grievances and how evil the white man is. If whites are so evil, why do millions of black Africans, year upon year, continue to do almost anything to gain entry to white countries? </p>
<p>For years now in Sudan, black Janjaween Islamic militia have been committing an ongoing ethnic cleansing against black Christians and pagans in the south of the country, including the taking of thousands of slaves and child-brides etc. All this under the auspices of a black Islamic government which has turned a blind eye on the behaviour of their Muslim brethren while the Hollywood celebrity dummies look the other way instead of condemning the guilty, i.e., the black Muslim militia.</p>
<p>Below is a short video narrated by a black African about the historically much more long-lasting and much-crueler black-on-black slavery and Muslim-on-black slavery. The European time in the African slave trade was much shorter and eventually Europeans abolished slavery worldwide, something every white person should be immensely proud of. Perhaps if these ill-informed blacks were to confront the truth, instead of repeating parrot-fashion the ravings of black demagogues then they might learn what the truth is and be more at peace with themselves and the world.  </p>

<p>Like Kwanzaa? what a laugh! Or Nation of Islam and Yakub and the Mothership?  OH NO! You are not going to start calling yourselves &#8220;Egyptians&#8221; again, are you?!<br>

		<p>&#8220;Better yet, they can also be used to reconnect our children with our rich history and heritage, and lift up their self-esteem and self-identity &#8220;</p>
<p>You want to connect your children with the rich heritage of failure to evolve? When the Rhodesians settled in Africa, there was no African tribe using the wheel, the simplest machine in the world. Africa is just a short plane ride away. Why aren&rsquo;t any of you moving there to live in all-black cultures, governed by nothing but blacks, it should be paradise, shouldn&rsquo;t it? You want your colors, go live under them. I suspect the only color that matters here is green, the White man&rsquo;s dollar. </p>
<p>As a racial separatist, I applaud your efforts. Please continue to disconnect yourselves from White Civilization. I must say, though that if there were All-White nations, in which only Whites could govern, and all other races were disadvantaged, but the soil was good for farming, and there was good weather, I would be off with my family like a shot. A chance to live with only my own brothers, reap the benefits of my own culture and heritage, and live in the peace and security of a high-IQ culture, I would renounce my US Citizenship in an instant. </p>
<p>You have this great oportunity, courtesy of the UN and the former Soviet Union, why have none of your people packed up and headed for the promised land? Live as men, not parasites! If you want black culture and heritage, it is right there in Zimbabwe and the Congo. Whites are leaving South Africa in droves, millions have gone in the last 14 years. In a decade there won&rsquo;t be any whites at all. (Of course they can&rsquo;t find engineers to run the power plants) Why are you still in this racist country if you hate it and 75% of the people?</p>

		<p>The reason the African American Flag has come into existence is because African Americans are striving for two homelands.  African Americans will change America first the will change Africa.  The flag is what will mentally connect African Americans to Africa. The Olmecs in America is a forgotten history of the presence of Africans in America, maybe the flag will be reason for research of the Olmecs.  By the way, before there were Egyptian (mixed race) they were all Nubian people.</p>

<p>Brilliant thinking. Now just how many WEEKS would it take for the Blacks in their own &#8220;territory&#8221; to come screaming White America needs to help them. Blacks in Africa couldn&rsquo;t survive without handouts from White nations. So how could a Black territory in America survive without endless help from WHITE AMERICA?</p>

		<p>Look, I&rsquo;m not a WN, but strategy games are fun.  What you folks should do is co-opt all their symbols   &mdash;   buy these flags and fly them, buy the t-shirts and wear them, etc.  Don&rsquo;t change your philosophy or world-view one bit   &mdash;   just take the symbols as your own and re-interpret them using YOUR ideas.  That&rsquo;ll really put some bees in their collective bonnet.</p>
<p>Also, that&rsquo;s what they do, right?  Take traditional symbols and demonize them or pervert them.  Your doing this is not capitulation, it&rsquo;s psychological and political warfare.  Not to mention the publicity angle&hellip;</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s willful ignorance with design.</p>
<p>The truth is that slavery was not a construct of white people but of cultural attitudes of earlier times, especially amongst the rich, in most societies including Arabic, Black, Chinese, and Indian societies most long before the United States was ever a nation.</p>
<p>Slavery was an institution of the times practiced by all races and it was European nations, beginning with the Quaker inspired abolition movement (e.g. Christians) that took the sacrificial determined steps to stop slavery in their countries and eventually expand the scope to stamping out slavery worldwide.</p>
<p>The truth is that whites slaves were America&rsquo;s first slaves, were slaves for life, and their slavery was hereditary (their children were born into slavery). Whites were auctioned on the block with children sold and separated from their parents and wives sold and separated from their husbands where they were worked to death in the sugar mills of Barbados and Jamaica and the plantations of Virginia.</p>
<p>As Michael A. Hoffman explains in &#8216;They Were White and They Were Slaves: The Untold History of the Enslavement of Whites in Early America and Industrial Britain&rsquo;, &#8220;Bound Whites in early America called themselves slaves and nine-tenths of the White slavery in America was conducted without indentures of any kind but according to the so-called &#8220;custom of the country,&#8221; as it was known, which was lifetime slavery administered by the White slave merchants themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>In George Sandys laws for Virginia, Whites were enslaved &#8220;forever.&#8221; The service of Whites bound to Berkeley&rsquo;s Hundred was deemed &#8220;perpetual.&#8221; These accounts have been simply left out of many &#8220;standard reference works&#8221; because this authentic history no longer is politically correct in today&rsquo;s modern liberal social construct. </p>
<p>Yet white slavery was an extensive operation and only around the start of the 18th century do we begin to encounter more &#8220;servitude&#8221; on the basis of a contract of indenture. But even in that period there was kidnapping of Anglo-Saxons into slavery and the numbers may surprise you. North Africans alone are estimated to have enslaved a million white Europeans who were cruelly treated. And we haven&rsquo;t even broached the subject of convict slavery.</p>
<p>So we see how modern liberalism rewrites history based on social or cultural edict to fit their social ideological construct rather than rely on accuracy, reason, rationality, and logic. They should not filter out truth. It is unfortunate that an institution that led to a Civil War were not solved, as they should have been, in reconstruction eventually requiring the Civil Rights movement to bring the necessary changes about. But what we are addressing here is how liberals simply change or omit truth to get what they want basing policy decisions on a lack of honesty and reasoning.<br>

		<p>I am 48 years old and for 48 years the only group I have seen constantly trying to identify themselves are blacks! The only group constantly complaining about everything is blacks! The only group totally reliant on welfare is blacks! The only group always wanting to change something or everything is blacks! The only group expressing desire for special treatment is blacks! Has anyone besides me started to see a pattern here?</p>

		<p>Any American born black who calls himself an &#8220;African-American&#8221; is not an American.  He is an African by his own admission.  Is it any wonder then that blacks will never be accepted as  Americans by whites?  Teddy Roosevelt was ten times the man Obama is and his wisdom and insight eclipses Obama&rsquo;s by light years&hellip;   </p>

		<p>Good grief!  We have people on here puffing up their chests about being an &#8220;American.&#8221; </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no such thing as an &#8220;American&#8221; anymore. Once, American meant white European descended person on these shores. No more.  </p>
<p>Now the nation looks like the Star Wars Bar. If you find your identity in being an &#8220;American,&#8221; then you just don&rsquo;t understand the nature of existence. You are born with your true identity everything else is artificial.</p>
<p>You have to learn to find your identity in your genotype.  That&rsquo;s what is genuine. </p>

<p>I dissagree.  Those of us who call ourselves &#8220;Americans&#8221; are predominatly white.  We know who founded and built this white nation.  Those who define themselves with a hyphenated descriptive are not Americans.  Teddy Roosevelt pointed this out long ago.</p>

<p>Teddy Roosevelt died. So did America. Go ahead and find your identity with blacks and Asians who, presumbly like you, also don&rsquo;t use hyphens and just call themselves Americans, if you think that is your authentic identity. Of course, you&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>Your genuine identity is in your genes.  It is what you are without even having to think about it. </p>
