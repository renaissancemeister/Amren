				<a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/sports-general/20081219/NASCAR-Harassment.Lawsuit/">NASCAR Settles $225 Million Suit With Ex-Official</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>AP, December 18, 2008</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				NASCAR has settled a $225 million lawsuit filed by a former official who said she was subjected to racial discrimination and sexual harassment during her two-plus years working for the stock-car organization.
			</p>
			<p>
				The suit was settled during a Dec. 3 mediation held in New York between Mauricia Grant and NASCAR. Settlement terms were confidential. Neither side admitted liability or wrongdoing, according to NASCAR.
			</p>
			<p>
				{snip}
			</p>
			<p>
				Grant, who is black, worked as a technical inspector responsible for certifying cars in NASCAR&rsquo;s second-tier Nationwide Series from January 2005 until her October 2007 termination. In the lawsuit filed in June in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Grant alleged 23 specific incidents of alleged sexual harassment and 34 specific incidents of alleged racial and gender discrimination during her employment.
			</p>
			<p>
				Among Grant&rsquo;s claims, she said she was referred to as &#8220;Nappy Headed Mo&#8221; and &#8220;Queen Sheba,&#8221; by co-workers, was often told she worked on &#8220;colored people time,&#8221; and was frightened by one official who routinely made Ku Klux Klan references.
			</p>
			<p>
				Grant also said she was subjected to sexual advances from male co-workers, two of whom allegedly exposed themselves to her, and graphic and lewd jokes.
			</p>
			<p>
				{snip}
			</p>
			<p>
				Grant claimed she ultimately was fired for that complaint to Balash [series director Joe Balash]. But in NASCAR&rsquo;s response, it claims Grant was reprimanded with a warning of termination for an altercation with a track security guard at Michigan International Speedway who had asked to see Grant&rsquo;s credentials as she passed through a gate.
			</p>
			<p>
				NASCAR officials have refused to disclose why Grant was fired. But the response claimed a pattern of tardiness for which she was routinely reprimanded.
			</p>

					So she gets fired for getting into an altercation with security (Cynthia McKinney, anyone?) and then she files a lawsuit for harassment. Sounds like par for the course.

					I have seen this kind of sham firsthand. I knew someone who worked at a meat counter in a very nice grocery store, and was a terrrible worker and was written up numerous times for very legitemate violations. H e was a terrible worker and his co workers did not like working with him. Later on he decides to attempt to file a discrimination suit hoping the store would simply settle. Well it didnt go well from the beginning so he later decided to start feigning illnes to claim an on the job injury that was after he was terminated. Well that didnt go well either. We all know the sort of sham this black woman is most likely perpetrating.

					INSANE! I have worked where I saw first hand the laziness and tardiness to an extreme by Black employees. THEY never got reprimanded!!! That lying woman deserves not one red cent! She was an affirmative action hire because our corrupt government demands it, so NASCAR needs to sue the government for all damages! It is just out and out extortion and Whitey has to pay for it all. When are White people going to start protesting all of these asinine lawsuits?

					Yeah, blacks seem to not be timely people. They have a major problem with being on time for work, or for anything else for that matter. They also have a problem with leaving work early and take entirely too many days off. Not to mention that they aren&rsquo;t usually good workers. I don&rsquo;t know why this is, but it seems universal to the race.

					<br />
					As I&rsquo;ve said, interaction with blacks is like handling a ticking time bomb. You won&rsquo;t know when or why but it&rsquo;s going to go off. Your best bet is to avoid being around blacks. No interaction, no chance of a racial &#8216;misunderstanding&rsquo;.
				</p>
				<p>
					BTW, our local angry-black-man radio talk show host is forever bitching that his black guests show up late. He uses the phrase &#8216;black mans time&rsquo; all the time. Also, his white guests don&rsquo;t seem to have any problem showing up when they&rsquo;re supposed to&hellip; Go figure.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another BTW which is relevant to job performance issues. Yesterday, on my bus ride home from work, a young black male was proudly stating that he was fired. Apparently he wanted off on his birthday but he didn&rsquo;t give any or enough notice. He decided to just not to show up. He was fired for &#8216;no call, no show&rsquo;. He said he didn&rsquo;t care because they&rsquo;re going to miss him because of all the work he did. See, it&rsquo;s their loss, not his.
				</p>
				<p>
					I wonder if his former employer is going to think twice about hiring another young black male. Is it any wonder employers who get burned by blacks don&rsquo;t hire blacks?

					I worked with a black guy who constantly told me because of &#8220;racism&#8221; black people always had to work harder and be better on the job then whites. Yet, he was absolutely the laziest, dumbest person I have ever worked around and I have been around awhile. And of course if anyone called him on his laziness, he immediately chocked it up to that person not liking him because he was black.

					Without fail, when Whites bring Blacks and other types into their midsts, to live, work, and socialize with, the interaction goes awry and backfires to the detriment of Whites and civilization in general.
				</p>

					Blacks belong in the jungles of Africa, not civilization. Whites who invite Blacks into their midsts should expect these predictable repercussions.<br />

					Affirmative Action is one of the reasons the Big 3 Auto Companies are so dysfunctional and have a demoralized work force. According to the Detroit Free Press:
				</p>
				<p>
					Chrysler is 52% black, Ford is 38% black, and GM is 28% black. Add in other minorities and you can see the problem. Chrysler has around a 70% minority work force if you include the Indian, Chinese, Arabs, etc. These minorities are always pressuring the UAW for more and more benefits and handouts.
				</p>
				<p>
					One scam at the Big 3 was for a black to get past the 90 day requirement to become unionized then they&rsquo;d fake an injury and go on disability. GM supports 650,000 retirees and &#8220;disabled&#8221; workers. Some estimate that 60,0000 of these are on fake disability claims.
				</p>
				<p>
					Imagine companies with this many lazy and incompetent employees. It&rsquo;s no wonder these companies are going under. I just read that Boeing has 4,000 black employees out of a work force of 52,000 (scary). Boeing has been pushing diversity for the last 10 years and will follow in the footsteps of the Big 3 in no time. No company can survive these numbers.
				</p>
				<p>
					Any company that hires this many quota hires is doomed. Boeing will be bankrupt in 10 years.

					This is one of the last white only businesses that blacks have been chomping at the bit to get a piece of and obviously the whole thing was nothing but a rig as they whined about no minorities in NASCAR and then when they hire one for an important job they win millions in a fraudulent lawsuit settled where else but lawyer capital of the world NYC that has nothing to do with stock car racing.<br />
					This wont be the last time either as NASCAR is being pressured to hire blacks on every level so you can expect more of this since all other major corps and endices have been extorted for many decades with welfare moocher Jesse Jackson Al Sharpton and the rest of the usual suspects leading the way.<br />
					So typical.

					At my work, blacks have not created nor added anything to improve our place of business. I&rsquo;m serious, not one creative idea of their own. This ongoing observation is as real as the sun rising. Sure they repeat the company line verbatem but not one idea of their own. They don&rsquo;t conceptualize nor think in the future tense. <br />
					I don&rsquo;t hate blacks, I have been exposed to them way more than I now choose. When I was younger I really thought we were all created equal. As you get older you see the truth. I actually feel sorry for them. And I feel sorry for this great Nation of the USA which is crumbling down. But line is, it has only been a great Nation because of European Whites. Before anyone gets mad, study your history and see what&rsquo;s going on around the world and you too will see the past, present and future. There is a clear and present danger looming.

					For those of you who enjoy NASCAR: Enjoy it while you still can, because it won&rsquo;t be around for much longer.
				</p>
				<p>
					Why? Because their &#8220;settlement&#8221; means that they have communicated the message that they are weak and vulnerable, and the civil rights establishment can use NASCAR as essentially an ATM machine. And that they will do, killing the goose that lays the golden ghetto lotteries.

					Does anyone actually believe this womans lies? Two male co-workers exposed themselves to her? Sexually intimidated her? Come on! White males &#8220;exposing&#8221; themselves to some Black chick? Do they have any PROOF of her allegations? This seems so far fetched to me that I think they settled because of threats and intimidation from the Jesse and Al gang of thugs.

All you have to do is open your eyes and you will see Even black Males seem to want them only on the rebound. Govt. Rape Figures back up this statement.

					Face it, blacks on average have faster reaction times than whites and would therefore make better drivers. I do question their ability to have empathy with something, even a machine. As far as this story goes, blacks and whites both make the same type of jokes about white folks, except when you&rsquo;re making fun of white folks, it&rsquo;s seen as groundbreaking and hip. Trendy. Blacks seem MORE likely to use these jokes around the office. And is it more acceptable if they are simply doing it among themselves? In fact I would say this is often it&rsquo;s own kind of exclusion. Even talking about you&hellip; as if you are not there. They are just less likely to be fired or sued. Even in instances where they themselves begin the taunts or harassment. Whites and blacks both do this however. For instance, to me there seems little difference between using the term &#8216;red-neck&rsquo; and using the &#8216;N&rsquo; word, yet in our progressive times we use the term &#8216;red-neck&rsquo;, a racial slur, in order to prove to everyone else how enlightened we are. When I bring this up, I&rsquo;ve even seen them argue that this is not a racial slur. Or that the person &#8216;really is red-neck&rsquo;.
				</p>
				<p>
					Where I work, one white guy was overheard, saying to another WHITE guy, &#8220;get your black-ass over here&#8221;. That&rsquo;s alledgely how the incident went. He could have said &#8216;get your white-ass over here&rsquo;. All I remember is what was said, said to be said, and it to another white guy in a private conversation. Keep in mind the whites usually go around as if afraid to even speak, especially regarding racial or sexual issues. The exact words used to describe the incident where, &#8220;That red-neck needs to be fired&#8221;.
				</p>
				<p>
					He was.
				</p>
				<p>
					I wonder if a lawyer is going to file suit on his behalf?
				</p>
				<p>
					Or if instead he&rsquo;s just going to be barred from another good paying job?

				<p>
					If true, GM could employ an entire an entire investigative department to recoup their loses. Now that would be money well spent.
				</p>
				<p>
					It reminds me of the public safety employees working at the World Trade Towers site who were demanding that the government recognize their respiratory ailments as being caused by environmental conditions they worked in. Yes, nothing is too low when it comes to trying to get the Cat&rsquo;s Meow of welfare: Long Term Disability.

					Some of the posters here are bang on. If you have ever had the misfortune to have to work with blacks you know what they are like. Tardiness, laziness and a general all-around surliness are the rule as well as a ridiculously over-inflated image of themselves as &#8220;great&#8221; workers who are constantly being &#8220;assailed&#8221; because they are black. Of all the races, cultures and ethnicities I have ever worked with, blacks are BY FAR the worst and least productive. Their creativity potential is zero. Interacting with them has been the most UNREWARDING experience of my professional career.

				</p>
				<p>
					You lost me. While it may be true that blacks have more &#8216;fast twitch&rsquo; muscle used in running, this clearly doesn&rsquo;t translate into being the best drivers. If NASCAR driving was largely about reaction time, your statement might be a reasonable argument and we would see the circuit filled with top-notch black drivers. The implication from you statement is that since blacks react faster they should be NASCAR drivers. What then is preventing them from taking the winners cup? Racism?
				</p>
				<p>
					While I don&rsquo;t follow NASCAR, I can see there is far more to professional racing than reaction time. Whatever the winning combination of traits and skills are needed to be NASCAR winners, there are few black (are there any?) that have qualified. <br />

				<p>
					That&rsquo;s why I have not flown in seven years and I will never fly again. Flying is dangerous enough without facing the increased potential of a Black turning the wrong dial or pressing the wrong button. Why risk it? The fact is that Black pilots, mechanics, or engineers were probably given their jobs because of the color of their skin, rather than actually passing a legitimate test and becoming legitimately qualified, as we routinely observe.
				</p>
				<p>
					Playing along with the pretense of affirmative action is not something I care to bet my life on. If a business, such as an airline, cannot see clear to hire the best people for the job, they will not earn my patronage. The same holds true for a pharmacy. If I walk in and the pharmacists are Black, I take my business elsewhere. Why face the increased risk of a Black foulup when he/she probably was not properly vetted for the position and is probably unqualified?
				</p>
				<p>
					Also, when I call for a service man to come out to my home, I ask to speak to the manager first and state that I prefer a White person be dispatched because of a previous bad experience. I have only encountered resistance when saying this one time. Of course, if the manager is Black, Hispanic, or Middle Eastern, I just say I&rsquo;ve reached a wrong number, hang up, and call someone else.

					It&rsquo;s one thing to trust a Black man to clean a urinal. It&rsquo;s a different matter when his improper decisions can cause the loss of life, limb, or property.
				</p>
				<p>
					None of this is to say that Whites are perfect, but we&rsquo;re talking about exercising good judgement in risk management. One should not play with the odds. Whites are far more capable in almost all walks of life and by every measure.

					Face it, blacks on average have faster reaction times than whites and would therefore make better drivers..
				</p>
				<p>
					<br />
					Blacks are faster at nothing. Whites let blacks take over their white invented created sports like football and basketball because they simply didnt want to be in such close quarters with them. Same with track and field events or boxing. <br />
					Blacks have had the luxury to have all white training. Check out Africa. Native African blacks have a few long distance runners but nothing else. <br />
					Matter fact up until the Soviet bloc nations dissolved where the purest of whites live, the Olympics were always dominated by these white athletes in track and field and boxing etc. <br />
					Whites moved on to other things in America and there is no way blacks would risk their necks driving 200mph without a million contract in advance.<br />
					In racing at least you do have to win before you get paid unlike todays prepaid pro sports they took over only because whites got out of them.

					Whites are less than 9% of the world population, yet win 90% of medals in the Winter Olympics and 70% of the Summer Olympics. Tell again how blacks are the &#8220;superior&#8221; athletes?

					To poster at 7:52 AM on December 21: &#8220;Blacks are faster at nothing&#8221; Unfortunately they are at some things. Mainly in areas requiring bursts of violent activity. I observed it numerous times and even was on receiving end of it. The speed of their perception and movements during such activities are higher than that of average white. Athletes of former Eastern block countries were more successful in the Olimpics of the past because they were subsidized by their governments since childhood and a lot of them were using steroids. I am not saying that they weren&rsquo;t great athletes but help from the government and doping had more to do with the number of medals they won in the past than them being white.

					Nappy-headed Mo? With an &#8216;M&rsquo;?

					Gimme a break! That creature can&rsquo;t even copy someone else&rsquo;s insult correctly. Obviously, she was trying to glom onto that s radio creep who called the black girls on a basketball team &#8220;nappy-headed hos&#8221;.
				</p>
				<p>
					It reminds me of when the black kids were saying &#8220;break yourself&#8221; prior to committing violent acts upon each other (initiations, gang retributions, etc.). I assume it&rsquo;s a corruption of &#8220;brace yourself&#8221;. Maybe they can&rsquo;t even understand each other. One of them heard it on tv, I guess, and repeated it not very well. I think that&rsquo;s where all the incomprehensible baby names come from, too. Who knows what it is that all those eleven-year-old moms are trying to spell&hellip;
				</p>
				<p>
					&#8220;&hellip;male coworkers&hellip;exposed themselves&hellip;&#8221; Oh, honey, you WISH! Reminds me of that female trainer who sued over the &#8216;trauma&rsquo; of seeing Peyton Manning mooning somebody. I know women who would PAY to see that. Heck! I probably know MEN who would, to&hellip;if nobody knew&hellip;
				</p>
				<p>
					As to blacks having faster reflexes, and therefore being better drivers&hellip; I guess that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re constantly running redlights and hitting people (ok, and trees, and school buses, and trains&hellip;). North Louisiana, where I live, has relatively few blacks, and reasonable insurance rates. South Louisiana has MANY blacks, and ionospheric insurance rates.
				</p>
				<p>
					But the bottom line is that this woman is suing because she&rsquo;s greedy and has concocted an excuse&hellip;&hellip;.and because our disintegrating and corrupt society is allowing her to.

					This article is completely depressing as well as dissappointing.
				</p>
				<p>
					When will companies learn?!
				</p>
				<p>
					Blacks play the lawsuit lottery, and have no problem with lying to achieve their desired financial result. No matter who or what it destroys, they will go for the bucks on imaginary slights. All it takes is a timid and otherwise weak organization to make the big payday manifest.
				</p>
				<p>
					Someday, a company will stand up for itself and fight these corrupt people no matter the cost. All that NASCAR did was embolden vicious and lazy black people, and strengthen their game.

					This black racist witch PLANNED this from the minute she got hired by NASCAR, don&rsquo;t kid yourselves. That&rsquo;s why she kept such good records of all the &#8220;injustices&#8221; she had to endure. Most blacks don&rsquo;t really want to work and are just looking to trap Whitey for a large ghetto lottery payoff. That&rsquo;s why EVERY TIME I see blacks in an expensive car, home etc., I NEVER think that they EARNED it. I always wonder what hustle they pulled to get it.

					If North American whites were to form their own nation, then it would be a task to create the type of society that would re-take the world in technology of all kinds &hellip; across the board. <br />

					I drive GM, but Saturns are made in right-to-work states. The 1995 SL-2 I rolled two weeks ago was the best car I&rsquo;ve ever owned, and still runs and drives, though I got a 2002 SL-2 to replace it. Unfortunately, it looks like the idiot management at GM is going to eliminate the Saturn division. That the division lost focus by producing overweight sedans and minivans at ever-increasing prices didn&rsquo;t help.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Big Three want taxpayer-funded bailouts because they wasted too much time and lost too much money producing and promoting large SUVs and minivans at a time when gas was running almost $4 a gallon. Think a minute; when was the last time any of you saw a TV advertisement for a small, economical US sedan or hatchback?

					I thought the ghetto lottery was the actual lottery. I live on the edge of the ghetto and people seem to have near inexhaustible funds for their lottery tickets. They have to use these food stamp benefits cards to pay for the actual necessities of course, but they seem to have no problem slapping down a twenty for a cornucopia of scratch offs on a daily basis.

					It&rsquo;s not just blacks who continually play the Race Card. I know of a mexican woman (a school librarian) who recently won a settlement from a school board, after telling them they were discriminating against her. Her excuse was that she had a son with &#8220;special needs&#8221;, i.e., criminally insane. Therefore, she couldn&rsquo;t help missing half the term. She told me she hated her fng job &amp; wished she could quit. Had she been Anglo, she&rsquo;d have been thrown out on her White ass, without so much as severence pay!!! When will White Folk get their brains and commonsense back and stop acting like guilty imbecilic wimps????

					Affirmative Action hiring laws in the US do not apply to businesses with a sufficiently small number of employees. I believe this number is 15 persons, but I am not certain. The obvious way for a small business owner to protect himself is to simply refuse to hire members of the nation&rsquo;s Race Card Lawsuit Community. The alternative appears to be risking the loss of everything he or she has worked to create to someone who never really wanted to work for a living at all.
				</p>
				<p>
					Fair housing laws also do not apply to landlords who are renting out a sufficiently small number of units. I am not certain what the cutoff number is.
				</p>
				<p>
					Protect yourself.

					lol! Whites have to do the opposite at &#8216;diversified&rsquo; workplaces. Keep intricate records in an attempt to keep from getting fired.
