<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-national/20081206/Slaughterhouse.Economics/">Raids Could Force Meatpackers to Raise Worker Pay</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, December 6, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The kosher slaughterhouse whose work force was depleted by a mass immigration raid in May has struggled to remain open because of a problem that few companies in this economy have: It can&rsquo;t find enough workers.</p>
<p>Since 389 of its 1,000 employees were arrested in the immigration raid, Agriprocessors Inc. has tried multiple recruitment tactics to replenish staff at its plant in Postville. It hired employment firms, recruited homeless people from Texas and even brought in workers from the tiny island nation of Palau.</p>
<p>But the plant hasn&rsquo;t been able to bring its staffing to more than half of pre-raid levels, causing Agriprocessors to cut its production drastically and then suspend it completely. After filing for bankruptcy protection, the company last week managed to restart its poultry line with a skeleton crew.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Meatpackers across the country face staffing shortages if immigration agents continue to conduct such mass raids. Unless the administration of President-elect Barack Obama intervenes, companies could be left to choose between two risky alternatives: hire illegal workers and chance a raid or increase salaries to attract and retain legal workers at a cost of higher consumer prices.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The action at Agriprocessors followed December 2006 immigration raids at Swift &amp; Co. plants in Iowa and six other states that resulted in nearly 1,300 arrests. Swift said those raids cost as much as $50 million because of delays in returning to full production and ultimately led to the selling of the company, based in Greeley, Colo., to the Brazilian meat company JBS S.A.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Industry officials downplay the size and significance of the illegal immigrant work force. They said companies were obligated to hire eligible employees. Janet Riley, a spokeswoman for the American Meat Institute, called the practice of hiring legal workers &#8220;good business sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>But others in the industry acknowledge that it takes hard work and more money to retain a legal work force.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The meatpacking industry has long relied heavily on immigrant labor, as people new to the country filled jobs that required almost no education, minimal language skills and little training. But some blame wage reductions and a decline in union membership for changing the industry in the past several decades.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The market sets the wages,&#8221; she [Janet Riley] said. &#8220;Like all employers, meat industry employers pay what is required to attract workers.&#8221;</p>

		<p>These jobs used to pay $10-$12 an hour during the 80&rsquo;s.   Now in 2008 they pay around $8-$10 an hour or even less.   The price of meat sure hasn&rsquo;t dropped since then.    Packing plants used to provide anyone who was willing to work the chance to have a decent standard of living but not anymore.   </p>

		<p>40 years ago meatpackers and chicken processors had absolutely no problem retaining workers.  Meat was cheaper then in relation to the cost of living and wages.</p>
<p>The workers were unionized well paid skilled workers who supported themselves and their families in a middle class lifestyle.</p>
<p>The difference is between less than minimum wage and dangerous working conditions and good wages and strict enforcement of safety regulations.</p>
<p>But if they paid decent wages and obeyed the safety regs, meatpackers would just make a moderate profit instead of the enormous profits they make now with their low wages and disregard of safety regulations.<br>

		<p>I had friends that left home in 1982 and moved to I think Montana to work in these meat packing plants. They went because they could make pretty good money as a high school grad.They stayed for a few years but were forced to leave with the rest of the white people when the plant began cutting wages and replacing the workforce with illegals. It&rsquo;s funny I dont remember any e-coli problems etc. before our food supply became the responsibility of illegals. Do you think that may be linked to different standards of sanitation in the new workers home countries? Think open air food markets and open or non existant sewer systems. I work construction and anyone who has been forced to share toilet facilities with these illegals can tell you that they have very different ideas on sanitation. As for these companies going bankrupt I say too bad &hellip;the greed finaly caught up with you!</p>

		<p>&#8220;Removing illegals from the workplace means higher wages for Americans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Absolutely, and that&rsquo;s exactly why the corporate greed merchants don&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>Maintaining such low wages means the community around these corrupt corporations will always be one of abject poverty which is hurtful to the community as a whole.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s criminal for these politicians in power to give employers a pass in hiring illegals when they know full well the people they hire are illegal, and it&rsquo;s even more of an outrage for these greedy corporate types to underpay.</p>

		<p>Throw the illegal employers in jail.  If the illegals can&rsquo;t find work they will leave voluntarily.  The meatpackers hire illegals because they don&rsquo;t have to pay a living wage, they don&rsquo;t have to pay workers compensation, and they don&rsquo;t have to worry about being sued when a worker loses life or limb.  Where does all the profit go from the reduced labor costs?  Right into the pockets of the plant owners.  Tyson and Luter who own chicken and pork processing plants, respectively, are billionaires.  They would&rsquo;ve been millionaires if they had done it the morally and legally right way by hiring legal workers but that wasn&rsquo;t enough for these greedy guys.</p>

		<p>Everybody who would be willing to pay 20% more for meat so that legal American citizens who do the dirty work in the slaughterhouses can get decent wages and benefits, raise your hand.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But Obama, Kennedy, and the other Democrats will continue to take the side of cheap labor and illegal immigration, as their corporate contributors want them to.  They abandoned the working class long, long ago.  The SPLC, sitting on its hundreds of millions of dollars, also doesn&rsquo;t give a damn about the American working class.</p>

		<p>there is no shortage of workers willing to work for a decent wage. the shortage is for workers willing to work for nothing. i would suggest that if meatpackers are unwilling or unable to pay a wage to attract good workers then perhaps there are too many meatpackers.</p>

		<p>The main problem is NOT the migrants but the greedy White Americans who want  cheap migrant labor and our politicians who want potential migrant votes in order to keep their power. Without these traitors and their greed, this problem would not exist.</p>

<p>Not necessary.  The cost of slaughterhouse labor is only a very small fraction of the price of the meat you eat.  doubling the wages of these workers wouldn&rsquo;t raise the cost of meat anywhere near 20%.  </p>

<p>The above statement is correct.  But it is also correct for produce, restaurants, hotels, carpet mills, construction, lawn care, etc.  Replacing cheap illegal workers with higher-paid American citizens will slightly raise the cost of everything.  However, it will DRAMATICALLY lower governmental spending while increasing tax receipts, thus lowering the need to increase your taxes.  The costs for education, health care, welfare, housing, policing, incarceration, will fall as millions of illegals return home.  It will save Social Security and Medicare, because your children will not have to support the invaders and their millions of anchor children in their old age.  Also, as wages are spent in the community (instead of being sent back to Mexico), that money will stimulate the local economy.  An American worker who uses his salary to buy furniture or build a new room, provides jobs for other Americans.  When an illegal sends his salary back to Mexico, that money cannot be used to hire American workers: that new room is not built and that furniture is not purchased.  The result is lower income for the local hardware and furniture store workers.  Their lower earnings mean lower tax income, at a time of greater governmental spending on the &#8220;poor&#8221; immigrants.  It is a vicious cycle, leading to economic disaster.  JOBS FOR AMERICANS   &mdash;   SEND THE JOB THIEVES HOME </p>

<p>Absolutely true.</p>
<p>In fact the increase per pound wouldn&rsquo;t be any greater than what meat flucuates right now due to market conditions.</p>
<p>Adequate pay in the field also would mean only about 5 or 6 cents per head of lettuce.</p>

		<p>What if the cost of meat did go up?  We saw eggs go from a dollar a dozen here in Colorado Springs to twice that last year.  Not one cent of that increase went home in the pockets of the workers at the chicken ranches.</p>
