<h1>Court Upholds $40,000 Web Defamation Award</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Globe and Mail (Toronto)</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Human-rights crusader Richard Warman has dealt a serious financial blow to one of the best-known figures on the far right, Paul Fromm, with a $40,000 defamation judgment from the Ontario Court of Appeal.</p>
<p>In a ruling released yesterday, the court upheld a trial award of $30,000 and added $10,000 in legal costs. Mr. Fromm, a self-styled free-speech advocate, immediately sought help from his supporters to pay the award and to finance a potential appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are $17,500 behind in our legal bills &mdash; to say nothing of the possible $40,000 debt, if this judgment stands,&#8221; Mr. Fromm said in a posting on his Canadian Association for Free Expression website.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Warman said that his victory, &#8220;sends the message that those who try to use the cloak of free speech to poison other people&rsquo;s reputations through lies and defamation do so at their own peril.</p>
<p>Ottawa lawyer Richard Warman is on a one-man crusade to to eradicade racists and neo-Nazis from cyberspace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hate propaganda and defaming people are both illegal on the Internet, just the same as they are in real life,&#8221; he said in an interview.</p>
<p>In her trial ruling, Madam Justice Monique MÃ©tivier of Ontario Superior Court had said that Mr. Fromm exhibited malice in a series of Internet postings that belittled Mr. Warman. &#8220;The steady diet of diatribe and insults, couched in half-truths and omissions, all lead up to the finding of malice such that the defamatory statements are not protected by the defence of fair comment,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the appeal court endorsed her conclusions: &#8220;In our view, the statements complained of are clearly capable of being defamatory of the respondent,&#8221; said Chief Justice Warren Winkler, Mr. Justice Michael Moldaver and Mr. Justice Stephen Goudge.</p>
<p>Mr. Warman, a lawyer for the federal government, has enjoyed remarkable success in a flurry of lawsuits and complaints to the Canadian Human Rights Commission.</p>
<p>In the statements that led Mr. Warman to sue him, Mr. Fromm disparaged him for using legal mechanisms to try to chill free speech and shut down individuals who had allegedly spread hate.</p>
<p>Mr. Fromm referred to Mr. Warman as &#8220;a hatchet man&#8221; and a &#8220;high priest of censorship,&#8221; and accused him of exploiting his former position as an investigator with the Human Rights Commission to benefit financially.</p>
<p>Lawyer Douglas Christie, who acted for Mr. Fromm during the trial, argued that Mr. Fromm was commenting on a matter of public interest and that he genuinely believed Mr. Warman to be an enemy of free speech.</p>
<p>&#8220;The actions of a public employee, acting in a manner that might bring the fair administration of the CHRC into question, is clearly a matter of public interest &mdash; as was the use of taxpayer&rsquo;s money in the prosecution of these cases,&#8221; Mr. Fromm&rsquo;s defence said in a written argument.</p>
<p>In his statement on the CAFE website, Mr. Fromm &mdash; a former teacher who was fired in 1998 for making racist comments in public &mdash; remarked that the appeal court judges were &#8220;snapping and confrontational&#8221; during his hearing last week.<br>

		<p>&#8220;Freedom of speech suffers a another defeat in Canada.&#8221;</p>
<p>Canada was taken over slowly but surely by the PC crowd for years until it has reached the state it is in right now, which is abysmal extreme pluralism on a lunatic level.  That is no exaggeration.  Not one iota of exaggeration.</p>
<p>My post on another site criticizing multiculturalism and giving valid reasons as to why it&rsquo;s not going to work was answered by someone named Evelyn, a Canadian, who informed me that her one main goal in life, from the time she arises until she retires at night, is to fight tooth and nail against racism.</p>
<p>I responded by saying the only time I was aware of attitudes like hers was when I read books on Fascism, and communism promoted by Maoists, and that those people involved were regarded by objective professional medical people as having mental disorders, just like many of the people caught up in various cults do.  She didn&rsquo;t respond, but I&rsquo;ve no doubt I wasted my time.</p>
<p>Remember the journalists who contributed to this site when the AA professor in Canada backed down out of fear when Jared Taylor flew up to debate him?</p>
<p>Well, they were some of the lesser examples of the mindless acceptance of multiculturalism as bad as they were.  As one admitted to me in a private email, the general public is even more fixated than the journalists are on PC.</p>
<p>This totalitarian state to our immediate north will be brought back to the real world, if our economy completes its collapse by the year 2012 as forecast by so many experts on the subject, who have no vested interests in taking that view, because they will be taken down with us.</p>

		<p>That Warman guy is a menace and needs to beinvestigated for hate crimes. Here is a link about Warman. We can all see what his agenda is. Another walking ADL in Canada.</p>

		<p>Now that communism has been exposed for the farce that it is, liberal lefties desperately need another ideology to wreak havoc on people&rsquo;s, preferably white people&rsquo;s, lives. And the preferred &#8216;ism&rsquo; of the day is ostensibly human rights protection. Just as communism promised to spread wealth about evenly, but in reality resulted in hardship for all, so does human rights protection promise fairness for everyone, but ends up ruthlessly punishing those who do not agree with the prevailing ideology. In Canada, we need real human rights commissions, to protect our human rights from the existing human rights commissions!</p>

		<p>How can the media refer to Orwellian government censor Richard Warman as a &#8220;human rights crusader&#8221; when he&rsquo;s helping destroy what&rsquo;s left of the right to free speech in Canada?</p>
<p>Mr. Fromm and his lawyer Doug Christie are the real crusaders for freedom and human rights. In fact it seems that every time someone is censored in Canada Mr. Christie is there to defend them.</p>
<p>How long before he&rsquo;s disbarred?</p>

		<p>And this supposed to be a free and democratic nation?<br>
This cultural-marxism is on its way to the U.S.A. The<br>
powers-that-be have been working on conditioning our <br>
people for years to just sit back and accept this kind<br>
of nonsense as some sort of justice or fairness, and it&rsquo;s<br>
only a matter of time before &#8216;they&rsquo; will feel the time<br>
is right, just as they have apparently done in Canada.</p>

		<p>As a person born in Canada, who now lives legally in the U.S., I have something important to say to any Canadian AmRen readers out there: Wake Up!  You live under a repressive Soviet-style bureaucracy that is slowly choking you to death.  Your &#8216;tolerance&rsquo; is being used against you to the point where your own citizens are being jailed and fined for having politically incorrect thoughts in cyber-space.</p>
<p>Warman&rsquo;s KGB thug tactics are taken right out of the Communist playbook.  When the Bolsheviks took over Russia, the first legislation they passed criminalized &#8216;hate speech&rsquo;, which sent tens of millions to their deaths and the gulags.  Read Solzhenitsyn.  What happened to him is happening to you.  As Aldous Huxley predicted, these Marxists have created a prison for you that you can&rsquo;t even see as a prison, and you&rsquo;ll learn to love it.</p>
<p>Thousands of Canadians should be protesting in the streets right now over this farcical, kangaroo court judgment against professor Fromm.  In the words of Dylan Thomas, &#8216;do not go gently into that good night.&rsquo;<br>

		<p>MG, you beat me to it. How this guy qualifies as a &#8220;human-rights crusader&#8221; is beyond me. And it&rsquo;s especially notable that the reporter would cheer on this master censor. I realize reporters are left-wing, but does Kirk Makin even have a clue here? If someone tried to take away his keyboard or shut down his newspaper, would he call them a &#8220;human rights crusdader&#8221;?</p>
<p>&#8220;Human rights&#8221;   &mdash;   RIGHT. Whenever you hear this, you can be damn sure the &#8220;rights&#8221; don&rsquo;t include free speech, and you can be damn sure the &#8220;human&#8221; does not include white people.</p>

		<p>     Get ready.  This could well be happening in the U.S. soon.<br>
Start speaking up to everyone you know now.  Persons such as Evelyn who was mentioned on a post on this topic have been brainwashed since birth to &#8220;fight against&#8221; non-existent racism.</p>

		<p>Robert Kelly great post.  These zombies would put chips in our brain or use brain scanners to root out racism, which is by whites only in their definition.  In fact, what would be racism if by whites but in non-whites they take as evidence of white racism that provoked it.</p>

		<p>Free speech? I suspect this is about right vs wrong. I&rsquo;m often suspect of those on the far right, myself, however I suspect Mr Fromm is probably right and those who oppose him are wrong. That&rsquo;s the way it usually seems to work. The way it seems intended to work, if I may be cynical about it. I suspect this is why they&rsquo;ve moved against Mr Fromm so quickly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one thing to use terror (such as they mean for Mr. Fromm - losing his job, his paycheck, and his reputation, and I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s in an implied physical threat to his person)&hellip; it&rsquo;s one thing to use terror as an unpleasant means to an end&hellip; It&rsquo;s quite another thing to use terror as a normal day to day part of doing business. To even justify and exalt terror. It&rsquo;s a very nazi-like way of going about ones business. The multiculturalists embrace and promote it at every opportunity. </p>
