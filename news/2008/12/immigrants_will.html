			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tamara Cohen, Daily Mail (London), December 8, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Immigrants will have wait up to 10 years for the right to claim UK benefits and council housing in the toughest crackdown seen for decades, it emerged last night.</p>
<p>All legal migrants will have to serve a five year &lsquo;probationary citzienship&rsquo; before being considered for a passport, immigration minister Phil Woolas said.</p>
<p>Those who work hard, are law-abiding and do voluntary work will be eligible for benefits one or two years afterwards.</p>
<p>But others will have to wait another five years before they can claim any benefits at all, in order to deter migrants who see Britain as a soft touch for benefit claimants.</p>
<p>Mr Woolas said: &lsquo;Entitlement to benefits should be for citizens of our country, not other people. If you are a citizen you have earned the right to benefits. People must show they are here to work.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The measures which will help to safeguard jobs for British workers during the recession, will be unveiled in a new Borders, Immigration and Citizenship bill to be published in January.</p>
<p>It follows the news that Afghan mother-of-seven Toorpakai Saeidi was living in a £1.2 million mansion in West London and claiminig £175,000 per year in benefits at the taxpayer&rsquo;s expense.</p>
<p>The minister also conceded that the Government was partly to blame for lax immigration rules.</p>
<p>Last October Home Secretary Jacqui Smith was forced to make the embarrassing admission that the number of foreign workers entering Britain since 1997 was 1.1 million &mdash; a staggering 300,000 more than official figures recorded.</p>
<p>Mr Woolas said: &lsquo;It has been too easy for illegal immigrants to stay in this country. We have not counted them in and out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In his previous role as communities minister, Mr Woolas revealed he had received death threats.</p>
<p>He added that the Government was to blame for letting ethnic communities become ghettos where no one had to learn English.</p>
<p>He said: &lsquo;Why is it my little boy&rsquo;s school has &lsquo;Welcome&rsquo; in 20 different languages? Immigrants must learn English.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The minister pledged to keep Britain&rsquo;s population which is currently 61 million, at below 70 million, and to stand up to the Prime Minister on immigration issues.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I lose my job, I lose my job&rsquo;, he said.</p>
<p>He has courted controversy for his direct approach since he being appointed to the immigration post just three months ago.</p>
<p>Last month Mr Woolas told reporters that most asylum seekers were economic migrants rather than refugees and accused lawyers and charities working for asylum seekers of &lsquo;playing the system&rsquo;.<br>

<p>I&rsquo;ll believe it when it happens. There will probably be so many exceptions and exemptions that things will go on as they are with the native British excluded from council housing because of immigrants.</p>
<p>A typical scam is for newly arrived immigrants to stay with their numerous relatives.  The day after arrival they go to the local council office and say they are homeless.  They are not really homeless, just staying with relatives.</p>
<p>So they go to the top of the list and are soon esconced in a cozy council house with a lawn and garden. All repairs and maintaince done by the council. And a seperate bed room for each child don&rsquo;t forget.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the native British whose greatgrandfathers actually built the council housing and voted in the labor governmnents that created the concept of council housing are on an 18year waiting list.</p>
<p>This is just a campaign promise.  An election is coming in a year or so.</p>

<p>Good for him telling the truth for once.  But how long will he be able to keep his job?  The rest of the ministers, Prime minister and many MPs want enough third world immigrants to destroy Britian.</p>

		<p>But for thoe of us who live in the real world with much experience of it, a politician&rsquo;s utterances are just words to get voted in again, and then to do nothing.   These people are stealing the British National Party&rsquo;s agenda, and it is heartening to note that some in opposing main parties are resigning from them and joining the BNP.   There is hope for the future after all.</p>

		<p>The ruling elites in Britain must be getting really worried about the BNP.  It is looking like these upcoming elections could be the year that the BNP finally has a big breakthrough.  I expect to see both the Tories and Labour in all out retreat from multiculturalism and a few dirty tricks played against the BNP to keep this from happening.  <br>
Oh well, I&rsquo;ll take good news where I can find it.  This is just another example of how nationalists don&rsquo;t have to win at the ballot box in order to still have an impact.  If their feet are held to the fire, the &#8220;mainstream&#8221; parties will move as far to the right as possible on immigration to keep nationalists out of power.</p>

		<p>How have European elites gotten away for so long with opening the floodgates to immigrants under the pretense that they are needed workers when they import from the most backward countries and cultures people who lack the work ethic, the drive or ability for education, who bring with them serious drug use and other social problems? </p>
<p>Net costs of such dysfunctional immigrants to the Dutch and other Western economies must be huge when one factors in Welfare, ESL, drug rehab and other health care for TB, AIDS etc. and a growing bureaucracy to psychoanalyze their unsurprising &#8220;alienation&#8221; on the one hand and prescribe remodeling the entire host society to make all failed cultures of the world feel welcome! </p>
<p>The leftist idiocy it takes to ferry illiterate African nomads into highly technologic western cities:</p>
<p>What could possibly go wrong? They won&rsquo;t even empty bedpans in nursing homes. That honest labor is &#8220;beneath&#8221; people who lived ten to a hovel with dirt floors before they hit the Western jackpot. If they&rsquo;re Muslim, then they believe that they are entitled to run the adopted states they will not work for and create the same hellholes they left. They didn&rsquo;t come to escape the Muslim made hellholes, but to spread them.</p>
<p>Why do Europeans not keep throwing out the leaders who have attacked them in this way with hostile immigration and keep throwing them out until they politicians who aren&rsquo;t sadomasochistic? The secret ballot still exists in Europe. Sven can still outvote Ahmed (though not for long) so why doesn&rsquo;t he do it? How sick do you have to be not to vote against your own destruction?</p>

Copenhagen: 300 Muslims riot outside mall<br>
Not just plain, ol&rsquo; &#8220;youth&#8221;   &mdash;   but Muslim youth! &#8220;Copenhagen: Muslims riot on Eid al-Adha,&#8221; from the Copenhagen Post, December 9:</p>
<p>Police used pepper spray Monday night to dispel up to 300 Muslim young people who caused disturbances outside Fisketorvet mall in downtown Copenhagen.</p>
<p>The youths had gathered at the shopping centre in connection with the celebration of the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Adha.</p>
<p>But several of those present got out of hand, according to police. Bicycles were thrown onto the nearby S-train tracks, shoppers at the mall were harassed and rocks were thrown at police who arrived on the scene.</p>
<p>Officers managed to split the group in two and drive them away from the mall. Five youths were eventually arrested as a result of the fracas.<br>

<p>Rather than let these Labour types off the hook by attributing such occurrences to &#8220;lax enforcement&#8221; and &#8220;embarrassing revelations,&#8221; is it not more likely that this is actually reflective of deliberate Labour policy   &mdash;   subsidizing the birth of new Labour voters, living in government housing with their government babies, all at the expense of the working English?  How else do Muslims with seven children get awarded mansions at taxpayer expense?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure even these small glimmers of common sense are only taking place because of the facts and arguments brought forth by Britain&rsquo;s only real opposition party, the BNP.  The defection of the working class from Labour to the BNP is still only a trickle, but you can be sure they want to nip this in the bud.<br>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t you believe it.<br>
The leopard does not change it spots.<br>
as others have mentioned this is purely playing to the gallery &#8216;letting the peasants hear what they want to hear&rsquo;.New labour is runnuning scared - and its desperation shows.<br>
Everything in Phil Woolas&rsquo;s background ( a hard left organizer for the &#8216;National Union of Students&rsquo;) points to his real sympathies.</p>

		<p>The salary of the Prime Minister of England is 187,611 pounds per year, just 12 thousand pounds per year more than this welfare Mother with 7 children.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s been in England less than 10 years.  His Family has probably been in England for 10,000 years.</p>

<p>These measures, as usual for the UK Lib/Lab/Con criminal politicians, are riddled with loopholes, and they know it. Every opinion poll has tipped New Labour to be decimated at the next General Election in 12-18 months time so this is aimed at halting the steady rise of the BNP, the only part in the UK who have the policies to save the nation from disaster. But New Labour only pretend to adopt strict BNP-like policies such as  halting mass immigration from the third-world and cutting down on the amount of people using social security as a way of life rather than a safety net, for such people are New Labour&rsquo;s core voters and they will never risk losing them. </p>
<p>For proof that this initiative is nothing but hollow words from hollow men one only has to look at another article in today&rsquo;s UK newspapers, &#8216;Amnesty for Asylum Seekers Who Slipped Through the Net&rsquo; which declares that 180,000 of the 400,000 backlog of failed asylum seekers (yes, failed asylum seekers) who should have been deported, are to be granted a &#8216;back door&rsquo; amnesty to live in the UK. Of course, they don&rsquo;t inform the public that the 220,00 other failed asylum seekers will remain in the UK illegally anyway.</p>
<p>We are being run by a New Labour criminal cabal who have their own EU/NWO agenda and like to import their own third-world voters. Like all Red Totalitarians these neo-Marxist criminals only pay lip service to democracy. And the opposition ain&rsquo;t nothing to write home about either. I&rsquo;m sure you folks in the USA can sympathise with our situation.</p>

		<p>Hopefully they&rsquo;ll go further than this idea they&rsquo;re posing.  Currently, I have a hard time even watching movies (period Chick flicks with the wife) that take place in England because it reminds me of the destruction of that once, beautiful and proud land.</p>

		<p>All of Western Civilization will go down the tubes if the people don&rsquo;t stand up to their governments!</p>
<p>Our collective governments have been lying to the people of most Western nations for decades, and it&rsquo;s just now reaching a boiling point as more and more of us become aware of this worldwide deceit.  Of course, all of this treachery is leading us towards a New World Order.  Great for the very rich at the very top but a total disaster for the rest of us at the bottom!</p>
<p>The more of the Third World we import, the more like a Third World we become&hellip;</p>

		<p>After over a decade of the present government&rsquo;s masterplan to increase the number of Labour voters by means of an open door policy (immigrants tend to vote for the people who let them in), Gordon the Moron has suddenly realised that  he might have overcooked the Golden Egg. <br>
I don&rsquo;t know why I am posting this e-pistle - Britain as a nation is now dead in the water - financially, industrially, spiritually, morally, and I don&rsquo;t see a way out of the situation.<br>
However, picking over the bones of what went wrong, &#8216;drastic&rsquo; sticking plasters such as the above are an indication of the problem&hellip;.<br>
&#8216;too little, too late&rsquo;.<br>
The post-war days of wine and roses are over - time to riddle the clinkers (again).<br>
Team GB (we weren&rsquo;t even allowed to call ourselves Great Britain during the last Olympics) - RIP</p>
