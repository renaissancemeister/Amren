<h1>Party Seeks New Mosque Ban</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AFP, December 4, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>THE party of Italian Interior Minister Roberto Maroni wants a moratorium on the building of mosques, citing fears of terrorist attacks, the Turin daily La Stampa reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>The anti-immigration Northern League, the main ally of conservative Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, made the demand after two men were arrested Tuesday on suspicion of planning attacks in and near Milan, Italy&rsquo;s northern economic hub.</p>
<p>&lsquo;These arrests show that Islamist terrorism is entrenched in Italy, and that we must be vigilant,&rsquo; Mr Maroni told the paper. &lsquo;Unfortunately it is not easy to distinguish between places of worship and those that recruit terrorists and finance the planning of attacks,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>The Northern League has lodged a motion in the lower house of parliament for a ban on the building of Muslim places of worship and cultural centres in Italy until parliament passes a law to oversee their construction, La Stampa said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mosques are springing up like mushrooms, and mayors can do nothing about it because there is no law,&rsquo; said Mr Roberto Cota, the head of the Northern League&rsquo;s group in the Chamber of Deputies.</p>
<p>Mr Izzedin Elzir, the head of Italy&rsquo;s main Muslim association UCOII, reacted immediately to the proposal, telling the ANSA news agency: &lsquo;Mosques are meeting places and places of peace that facilitate the work of security forces.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Italy is home to some 1.2 million Muslims and counts 258 mosques and 628 Islamic associations, according to the Italian press.</p>
<p>The two men arrested in Milan on Tuesday, reportedly Moroccan, are accused of planning attacks on a supermarket in Seregno, north of Milan, and a police barracks and an immigration office in Milan.</p>
<p>About 10 people implicated in the investigation whose telephones were tapped revealed Al-Qaeda sympathies during their conversations, ANSA said, adding that the two Moroccans are the first to face charges of planning attacks on Italian soil.</p>
<p>Others have been arrested on suspicion of belonging to a logistical cell or having recruited suicide bombers to carry out attacks in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Berlusconi&rsquo;s People of Freedoms party allied with the Northern League to win general elections in April, largely on a security platform, and they enjoy comfortable majorities in both houses of parliament.</p>
<p>They moved quickly to toughen immigration policy, drawing fire for a plan to fingerprint Roma, or gypsies. &mdash; AFP<br>

That&rsquo;s because they ARE recruiting centers for jihadis.</p>

		<p>I wonder if the Sicilians allow this kind of abuse by muslims on their island, how many mosques are on Sicily?. I&rsquo;m glad to see the Italians are finally getting serious about the muslim threat.</p>

		<p>It certainly is easier to address the problem without that pesky First Amendment getting in the way!  That said, the best solution is simply to not let them in the first place.  </p>

		<p>What would happen if Christians build churches in Saudi Arabia, Iran and other Muslim countries? </p>
<p>From Wikipedia:<br>
&#8220;Foreign Christians in Saudi Arabia are not hanged or stoned to death. However, the practising of Christianity is still banned in Saudi Arabia&#8221;.<br>
&#8220;Saudi Arabia allows Christians to enter the country as temporary workers, but DOES NOT allow them to practice their faith. Foreign Christians generally only worship in secret within private homes. Items and articles belonging to religions other than Islam are prohibited. These may include Bibles, crucifixes, statues, carvings, items with religious symbols such as the Star of David, and others&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Why do Muslim&rsquo;s feel the need to emmigrate to countries where they are in reality, not wanted and where they apparently disagree with the secular lifestyle? Why can they not enjoy the company of their own in their native homelands? Why must Muslims criss cross the world seeking out hosts that they are religiously unsympathetic to and as mentioned unwanted by?</p>

<p>Because they want to expand their faith to the Western world. Muslims always wanted a Muslim Europe since the Middle Ages, but in those times Europeans knew how to defend their homeland.</p>

<p>Within the past year or so a catholic priest was arrested here in Kuwait for preaching Catholicism. He was tried, convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison (the going rate for preaching here in Kuwait) It took the POPE, the influence of the VATICAN and the Italian Embassy to get him released. He was released under the condition that he never again enter muslim lands or the penalty would be imposed without appeal. What is he going to do if the muslims take over Italy??</p>

<p>Sicilians regard Muslims as infidels and heathen Moors. That&rsquo;s because they have a deep hatred of Muslims going back to Sicily&rsquo;s conquest by the Arabs and Saracens. If Muslims tried to build a mosque on Sicily, it would be destroyed, under the direction of the Friends of the Friends.</p>

		<p>Muslim extremists immigrate to the West under the cover of so called &#8220;moderate&#8221; Muslims. I.e., because we in the West are constantly told that most Muslims are &#8220;moderate&#8221;, no matter how horrid the stuff they&rsquo;re supposed to believe (read Robert Spencer), the sellout politicians keep letting them in.</p>

If Muslims tried to build a mosque on Sicily, it would be destroyed, under the direction of the Friends of the Friends.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
It is true that quite a few Sicilians really do not think very highly of Islam because of what occurred during the Middle Ages.  Some ignorantly believe that today&rsquo;s Sicilians are primarily descendants of Muslim Arabs and Berbers, but take it from someone of Sicilian descent, this really is a rather big exaggeration and distortion of history.  Sicilians are predominantly descended from the Greek-speaking Orthodox Christian population that was living on the island when the Moors/Saracens conquered it.  Prior to this Muslim conquest, Sicily had been ruled by the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire.  </p>
<p>Additionally, when the Normans wrested control of Sicily from the Arabs a few centuries after the Arab conquest, they were initially tolerant of all of the cultures present in Sicily, be they Greek Christian, Arab Muslim, Jewish (there was a small Jewish community that was concentrated in cities), or Latin Catholics.  Following the Norman conquest however, immigration from the Italian mainland and France increased substantially, and many parts of Sicily were repopulated by these new settlers as many Muslims voluntarily left the island, killed by pogroms launched against them by the new settlers, or later expelled under the reign of Frederick II during the Swabian era. </p>
<p>One study shows that Sicilians only have roughly 7% genetic admixture from the medieval North African invaders (themselves Mediterranean Caucasoid Arabs and Berbers) as compared with about 37% Greek ancestry.  Keep in mind that the Greek-speaking population was not exclusively Greek in ancestry as the ancient and Byzantine Greek settlers in Sicily would have intermarried with the indigenous Sicilians, who were primarily of mainland Italian stock as one might expect.  Furthermore, the Normans, French, Spaniards, and other rulers of and immigrants to Sicily also added their genes to the mix.  </p>
<p>But anyway, the medieval Moorish invasion is probably why to this day, many of the Tunisian and other North African immigrants in Sicily are fiercely resented by the natives.  This probably explains why Italy and Spain both have far more restrictive immigration policies in place than does France or the UK.  </p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s a link regarding the study.  I&rsquo;m not sure if these are average figures or if they were just based on a particular sample or samples but I&rsquo;m fairly certain that they represent roughly average figures for genetic admixture.  I know that the Greek language lasted well into early modern times in a few areas in eastern Sicily, where Greeks settled most heavily.  As for the Arabic language and Islam, both were probably completely wiped out by the late Middle Ages as Romance speech and Catholicism that was largely introduced by Norman, Lombard, mainland Italian, and other conquerors/settlers, began to supplant the Arabic and Greek cultures present in Sicily.       </p>
