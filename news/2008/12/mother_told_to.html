			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), December 16, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A woman has spoken of how she was told to remove her Christmas lights by a housing association worker &mdash; in case they offended her non-Christian neighbours.</p>
<p>Dorothy Glenn decorates her home in South Shields with hundreds of festive lights every year, including a giant tree and a 4ft Santa Claus.</p>
<p>But she was left stunned this year when a South Tyneside Homes worker called at her house to inform her that the decorations she was displaying might be offending her neighbours.</p>
<p>The association last night apologised to Mrs Glenn and insisted that removing Christmas lights was not part of their policy.</p>
<p>The 41-year-old mother-of-three said: &lsquo;I put the lights up in the first week of November and then recently a uniformed housing worker was outside, and it looked like he was counting my decorations.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When I went outside he said that the lights were &#8220;offensive to the community&#8221;. If I was offending anyone I could understand why he was telling me, but nobody has complained.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My neighbours are Bengali and Chinese and I know that they love the lights &mdash; the children will always point them out when they walk past.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Glenn, who has lived at the property for four years with son Owen, 19, and daughters Samira, 21, and Chelsea, 15, said she had a close relationship with her neighbours and enjoyed living in a community with people from different backgrounds.</p>
<p>She said: &lsquo;I told him that I am far from a racist and that I wouldn&rsquo;t be taking the lights down. I&rsquo;m shocked, annoyed and upset. At the end of the day, it&rsquo;s the festive season and they&rsquo;re staying.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Independent councillor Ahmed Khan, who represents Mrs Glenn&rsquo;s ward, condemned the over-zealous employee&rsquo;s actions.</p>
<p>He said: &lsquo;Every year this woman puts her Christmas lights up and I know how popular they are. It&rsquo;s great when people make an effort to decorate their houses.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s this kind of nonsense that sets race relations back 20 years. That woman did nothing more than decorate her house to celebrate Christmas.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A spokesman for South Tyneside Council said: &lsquo;We would like to make it clear that South Tyneside Homes is happy for residents to put up Christmas lights to decorate their homes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Christmas lights bring a bit of festive cheer to everybody and we are delighted to see examples of tenants and leaseholders across the borough taking so much pride in the appearance of their homes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have received no complaint about this alleged incident, but are investigating the matter and apologise for any upset this may have caused.<br>

		<p>It seems quite certain that England&rsquo;s absolute hatred of its own native sons and daughters is rivaled by NO ONE on earth! These articles are breathtaking in their stupidity, audacity and insanity. Of course all of the western world is apparently in competition to see who can outpace the other land in displacing and destroying their people, so it&rsquo;s really a toss up who is furthest down the tubes at this point.    </p>

		<p>In twenty years, if things continue on this path, the mere presence of indigenous British people will be deemed &#8220;offensive.&#8221;</p>
<p>In America, political-correctness is an annoyance.  In the UK it is a religion, and besides Islam, it&rsquo;s the only religion that is celebrated.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Housing Association&#8221; might more accurately be called &#8220;Housing Soviet&#8221;.  These do-evilers are straining at the leash, eagerly awaiting the opportunity to impose multicultural collectivism.  This time, the little Red ferret got ahead of schedule, so his master had to pull him back and pretend that it didn&rsquo;t portend anything.</p>

		<p>All of us Western Countries are on the same slippery slope, but I am sure I can say that we in Australia are not quite where Britain is yet.<br>
But then I read lots of outrageous locally based stories in this overwhelming sea of information that we have available but that&rsquo;s besides the point.<br>
My neighbourhood is blue collar white (trades people mainly), with a huge always growing Middle Eastern neighbourhood next to it.<br>
But the other night my wife and my two children(one and two years old) went for a walk, we were directed to go to one house in particular because of all the elaborate Christmas decorations.<br>
And I have to say I was blown away by the generous spirit of these people, there was at least 20 people there mums, dads and kids with people constantly comming and going. And these big hearted people had 12 Christmas trees in one room alone with various snow blowing devices, a model train, numerous animatronic santas and snowmen etc with Christmas music contantly playing. <br>
It was really, really nice and odviousily infectious because we ended up having to walk around the whole block because numerous neighbours having dedicated front rooms to similar displays gave us lots to look at.<br>
And there were lots of proud displayers welcoming and inviting everyone and lots of excited kids running back and forth. And all us adults were smiling it was nice.<br>
And my kids were buzzing for hours.<br>
I thought to myself this is Christmas.</p>

		<p>Militant white atheists seem to think that they can count on nonwhites to help them fight the Christian white majority, but by and large, it is not so.  I&rsquo;m glad to see that this likely Muslim councilman is on our side in this conflict.  </p>

		<p>Oddly, having been in Kuwait and Iraq for some time, I have seen many places of residence and business decorated with Christmas lights and such. These Brit muslims (oxymoron?) are just testing their strength.</p>

		<p>Nowadays I am often ashamed to have been born British.     The country is going down rapidly both morally amd financially.  At age 71 and retired with our life savings an paid for Stte pension having lost 30% in value when it is transferred into Euros because we live in Spain and it is in sterling, I may now like a million others have to start &#8220;robbing banks&#8221; in the future to just survive, after all the banks are partly responsible for the financial mess we are all in now.</p>

		<p>Please note that it was not an ethnic minority that complained about the Christmas lights.  It was a White marxist bureaucrat.  </p>

		<p>I think Mrs. Glenn is part of the problem.  She appears to me to be willing to accommodate her neighbors IF there were offended.  Again, the &#8220;I am not a racist&#8221; apology is part of her defense.</p>
<p>Foolish British.  They ignored Enoch Powell and now their children and grandchildren are left with one helluva mess.<br>

		<p>         Yes, she&rsquo;s was over zealous, but her anti-idealism is<br>
exactly in line with the vision of Britain&rsquo;s Elite. Incremental-<br>
ism is the way, not outright repression. Christmas wont be ban-<br>
ned for another couple of decades. In fact, it may never be-just<br>
merged into Eid, Hannakah etc. Santa&rsquo;s ok after all. Christ is<br>
not.</p>

		<p>Is this the same England that gave us Charles Dickens&rsquo; &#8220;The Chistmas Carol&#8221; many years ago and until just recently with the influx of non-Whites and non-Christians, now finds it offensive?</p>
<p>There will, at some point, be a backlash of cultures if this keeps up. Christians will put up with intolerance of others just so long.</p>

<p>we amy reasonably conclude, then, that the only person who was &#8220;offended&#8221; was the local housing association representative. And just who in the H3LL gave <i>him</i> that much power over his neighbors, anyway?</p>

		<p>Please don&rsquo;t be too hard when criticizing the indigenous Brits!  The U.S.A. is only 20 years behind them at the rate we&rsquo;re going.  </p>
<p>More and more our politicians will want to appease non-Western immigrants and finally will say to Americans, &#8220;If you want to celebrate Christmas you have to do it behind closed doors.  We are now a completely multicultural country and we don&rsquo;t want you offending people.&#8221; </p>
