<h1><a href="https://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/ireland/article5404390.ece">Ireland Too Grey for the Burqa</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Colin Gleeson, Times of London, December 28, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>MUSLIM women who wear the burqa in Ireland are at increased risk of pelvic fractures during childbirth because of vitamin D deficiency due to a lack of sunlight, a consultant warns.</p>
<p>Babies born to women with vitamin D deficiency are also more prone to seizures in their first week of life, according to Dr Miriam Casey, of the Osteoporosis Unit in St James&rsquo;s hospital in Dublin.</p>
<p>A burqa is an enveloping outer garment worn by some Muslim women. In hot countries, enough sunlight gets through to give them sufficient vitamin D, but this may not happen in countries where there is limited sunshine, such as Ireland and Britain.</p>
<p>Casey said she was aware of cases involving pelvic fractures, and warned that these could become more frequent as Ireland&rsquo;s Muslim population increased. &#8220;Ireland&rsquo;s temperate climate doesn&rsquo;t have the intense sunlight that keeps burqa-clad women from becoming vitamin D-deficient in their own countries,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Vitamin D helps the body to absorb calcium and is crucial for making bones strong. The greatest source is sunlight.</p>
<p>Casey said the fractures occur at sites of particular weakness which develop in under-mineralised pelvic bones. In these women&rsquo;s babies, low calcium can cause &#8220;serious complications such as seizures, growth retardation, muscle weakness and fractures&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a toddler, carrying the weight of the torso can force the development of a bow-legged appearance and a waddling gait,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Later, there can be rickets, which is caused by vitamin D deficiency, with swollen wrists and bones that fail to fuse in adolescence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Darker skins can produce as little as 1% of the vitamin D that fair skins produce. Moreover, studies have found that the rate of many diseases rises the further north one moves, leading researchers to suspect that vitamin D may play a greater role in health than previously thought.</p>
<p>Casey said: &#8220;As we see a rise in the number of Muslims in Ireland, it&rsquo;s going to become a massive problem. It&rsquo;s worse in England whose Muslim community is older. There are already problems in the Rotunda [a maternity hospital in Dublin] and the paediatric hospitals.&#8221;</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the Islamic community in Ireland said she was unaware of health problems suffered by women wearing burqas.</p>
<p>Last year, Muslim women in the UK were warned that wearing the hijab could cause poor health for them and their babies. A UK government spokesman said: &#8220;We are not interfering in a Muslim woman&rsquo;s right to wear the hijab, but we are stressing that we all need sunlight on our skins.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Vitamin D from the sun prevents cancer and other diseases, which is why Scandinavians and Canadians have higher cancer rates than Mediterraneans.</p>
<p> Also, blacks have higher cancer rates than whites because their melanin limits vitamin D absorption.  </p>

		<p>This is another reason why Europe should be populated by white-skinned Europeans. The darker hued people need exposure to more sunlight. Let them return to sunny Africa. This time for their own health and that of their newborn offspring.</p>

		<p>Ireland and other northern countries are too grey for dark-skinned people period, regardless of whether or not they are Muslims or wear burqas. Such a shame that Ireland has invited in the third-world hordes. I had thought that Ireland might be a place for white Brits to escape to. Guess not.</p>

		<p>There is a correlation between skin color and sunlight levels:<br>
 <br>
&#8220;People in the tropics have developed dark skin to block out the sun and protect their body&rsquo;s folate reserves. People far from the equator have developed fair skin to drink in the sun and produce adequate amounts of vitamin D during the long winter months.&#8221;<br>
There is also a map that shows how the skin color of indigenous people across the globe should be based on how much ultraviolet light different areas receive.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/07/3/text_pop/l_073_04.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/07/3/text_pop/l_073_04.html</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Under darker skies, pale skin absorbs more sunlight than dark skin, allowing ultraviolet rays to produce more vitamin D for bone growth and calcium absorption.&#8221; </p>

		<p>It has been known for years that the Irish have some of the whitest skin tones of all Europeans, and that this is linked with the reality of the Irish climate - a land on which the sun seldom shines.<br>
 Furthermore the scientific fact that vitamin D synthesis in the human body is liked with the absorbtion of sunlight on the skin has been known for years.<br>
  Perhaps this is a case of nature fighting back when the politicians refuse to do so.</p>

		<p>The real story here is that the indigenous peoples of Europe mutated away (you may prefer &#8220;diverged&#8221; or &#8220;evolved&#8221;)from other humans with our white skin and thousands of other genetic changes as we adapted to a different environment. This made us a distinct and different people on the way to being a new species.</p>
<p>Now, we&rsquo;re being pulled back to Africa by having darker peoples swamp our gene pool.  Call it what it is: genocide of the white genotype.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to have to burst your bubble, but cold weather is not a deterrent to black Africans migrating to colder climes. I live in Canada, in a city that is much colder in the winter than anywhere in Ireland, and Somalis have flocked here, much as they have arrived en masse in chilly American cities such as Minneapolis and Lewiston, Maine. Apparently, the Somalis love the frigid winter temperatures, or so they say. They claim they much prefer it to the torrid conditions of their beloved African homeland. Assuming they&rsquo;re telling the truth, cold weather is a draw - not a deterrent - to where black Africans end up migrating to. </p>

<p>Well, I do know one reason; the factions in Ireland who once proclaimed &#8220;Ireland for the Irish&#8221; have now bought into the multicultural insanity and now Ireland is open to the world in their eyes.  How they can reconcile their previous position to their current one is beyond belief.  </p>
<p>It just demonstrates again the very high correlation between a left wing political orientation and disdain for Western Civilization and the white race.</p>

<p>  Matt, I suspect it is the whites and their welfare that they really prefer. I think they like Norway and Sweden for the same reason. </p>

<p>Nope. Becoming a separate species should not be a scary thought at all for whites.  It&rsquo;d be good for evolution and for whites to not be able to breed with other humans. Evolution is about diverging;not blending back in to the mass.</p>

		<p>Not just the cloth head coverings, but their darker complexions would put them at a disadvantage.  Human skin evolved to let in enough sunlight that adequate Vitamin-D production would occur.  This is a different hue in different parts of the world, due to the different levels of available sunlight.  The catch is pregnant women.  Too much sunlight allows UV to destroy the folic acid in a woman&rsquo;s system, which results in a child born with spina bifida if the woman becomes pregnant.<br>

		<p>The regional garb of every country and climate has evolved over the course of many centuries to reflect the conditions of that particular place. There is a reason why Arabs cover themselves as thoroughly as they do. The wrappings of white cloth not only keep out the scorching desert sun, they also help retain precious moisture around the body and protect it from drying desert winds.  </p>
<p>But When you see someone walking around in London or Stockholm  or Dublin,  wearing clothing that was evolved to cope with the tropical desert conditions of Arabia or Somalia,  the sight is so out of place that it is ludicrous.</p>
