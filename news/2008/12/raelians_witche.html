<h1>Raelians, Witches and Christians &mdash; In Quebec There Is No Difference</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Barbara Kay, National Post (Toronto), December 17, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An often-quoted Jesuit maxim boasts, &#8220;Give me a child until he is seven and I will give you the man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Only seven? Amateurs! Since September all Quebec students from primary school entry to high school graduation, whether enrolled in public or non-funded private schools, must attend Quebec&rsquo;s new Ethics and Religious Culture course (ERC). And teachers, regardless of their beliefs, must teach it.</p>
<p>Jonathan Gagné, a courageous teenager at the Joseph-Hermas-Leclerc secondary school in Granby, Que., has just been suspended, and will likely be expelled, for boycotting ERC. He is a hero to thousands of angry, mainly Catholic, Quebecers who consider compulsory submission to ERC a violation of their human rights.</p>
<p>The ERC curricula are mandated to introduce students to Quebec&rsquo;s rich diversity of religious tenets and &#8220;facilitate the spiritual development of students so as to promote self-fulfilment.&#8221; Since when does the state &#8220;facilitate&#8221; spiritual self-fulfilment? To parents who take religion seriously, this is a chilling intrusion into what all democratically inspired charters of rights designate as a parental realm of authority.</p>
<p>ERC was adopted by virtual fiat, its mission to instill &#8220;normative pluralism&#8221; in students. &#8220;Normative pluralism&#8221; is gussied-up moral relativism, the ideology asserting there is no absolute right or wrong and that there are as many &#8220;truths&#8221; as there are whims. There were no public consultations.</p>
<p>The program is predicated on the worst possible educational model for young children: the philosopher Hegel&rsquo;s &#8220;pedagogy of conflict.&#8221; As one of the founders of the ECR course, put it, students &#8220;must learn to shake up a too-solid identity&#8221; and experience &#8220;divergence and dissonance&#8221; through &#8220;le questionnement.&#8221;</p>
<p>ERC is to the grasp of authentic religion and spirituality as Esperanto to the comprehension of Spanish and English &mdash; both are useless adornments, artificial rather than organic constructs. Worse, they may deflect forever the desire to acquire meaningful knowledge.</p>
<p>Reading ERC manuals and activity books, one finds a superficial mishmash of trendy theoretical platitudes whose cumulative effect will be to convince children that belief is fungible, and that all religions &mdash; including pagan animism and cults &mdash; are equally &#8220;true.&#8221; The curriculum is strewn with politically correct material that openly subverts Judeo-Christian values. In many of the manuals, ideology and religion are conflated. Social engineering is revealed as the heart of the ECR program; in the most recently published activity book, for example, Christianity is given 12 pages, feminism gets 27 pages.</p>
<p>No religious leaders are solicited for their views in this text, but Françoise David, the radical-feminist leader of the Marxist party Québec Solidaire is &#8220;interviewed.&#8221; Beside a large picture of Mme. David, benignly smiling, face upwardly tilted in the old Sovietic mode, the question is posed: &#8220;What would you say to those adolescents who don&rsquo;t feel concerned about feminism?&#8221; David replies: &#8220;[Adolescents] need a feminist analysis in their life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Paganism and cults are offered equal status with Christianity. Witches &#8220;are women like any other in daily life;&#8221; &#8220;Technologically [the Raelians] are 25,000 years in advance of us.&#8221; And considering that of the 80,000 ethnic aboriginals in Quebec only 700 self-identify with aboriginal spirituality (the vast majority of ethnic aboriginals are Christian), aboriginal spirituality (falsely equated with environmentalism) is accorded hugely disproportionate space and reverence.</p>
<p>In this ERC monoculture, only similarities between religions are permitted, to further the jolly illusion that all religions are merely variations on a single theme of brotherly love.</p>
<p>Take for a subtle example ERC&rsquo;s gloss on the Golden Rule &mdash; Christianity&rsquo;s &#8220;Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,&#8221; Judaism&rsquo;s &#8220;Love thy neighbour as thyself&#8221; and Islam&rsquo;s &#8220;None of you is really a believer if he does not wish for his brother what he wishes for himself.&#8221; All are posited in the ERC text as the same acknowledgement of the common humanity of all God&rsquo;s children.</p>
<p>But in fact, there is a deep interpretive chasm between Christianity&rsquo;s &#8220;others&#8221; and Judaism&rsquo;s &#8220;neighbour&#8221; &mdash; both of which refer to all people &mdash; and Islam&rsquo;s &#8220;brother,&#8221; which refers only to fellow Muslims. Here is &#8220;divergence and dissonance&#8221; truly worthy of &#8220;le questionnement.&#8221; But encouraging real critical thinking is precisely what the ERC course employs duplicity to avoid.</p>
<p>On the surface, the ERC curricula present an innocent, even uplifting multicultural picture. But their subliminal agenda is pernicious: to short-circuit authentic spiritual development by banalizing normative religions in order to bind children&rsquo;s loyalty to Quebec&rsquo;s state religion of left-wing, heritage-averse ideology.</p>
<p>Quebec is veering into creepy Orwellian political territory here. I wish Jonathan Gagné and his family the moral sustenance &mdash; and the public support &mdash; to peacefully resist the state&rsquo;s coercion to the bitter end. They should know that they are fighting not only for themselves, but for all Quebec citizens&rsquo; freedom of conscience. Which is to say democracy itself, and nothing less.<br>

		<p>   Leave religion and/or the lack of, to the parents of children to teach them. It is none of the state&rsquo;s business what beliefs these people have to live by. Religion is a very personal thing between a person and the deity that they believe in. The state needs to feck off.</p>

<p>Give me a nation that has such a philosophy, and I will give it back to you immediately, because it will never escape implosion and total annihilation from within.</p>
<p>Fools who live in their own sub-standard heads are ill-equipped to concoct any kind of ideology, because, like Karl Marx, they live in a fantasy world where they cannont temper their ideologies with practical experience and a true knowledge of what the real world and real people are all about, analyzing experiences from the past with common sense, and detemining what might be best for the long term and what might make the best society in which people treat each other with the utmost respect.</p>
<p>Running amuk, doing one&rsquo;s &#8220;thing,&#8221; with the idea that &#8220;if it feels good, do it,&#8221; is pure and simple chaos.</p>
<p>These kinds of people take works like the Authoritarian Personality (Adorno) as gospel instead of gleaning out the points that might be useful in recognizing totalitarian personalities, as one would do in many different subjects in order to arrive at what might be best for society as a whole.</p>
<p>These same types go on to advocate kooky ideologies that are completely at odds with human nature and natural instinct and come up with something like political correctness that cannot exist unless absolute untruths are promoted constantly, just like a fantasy world.  The morally compassless crowd are advocates of so much nonsense it&rsquo;s difficult for sane people to understand just what kind of fools can be taken in by it all.</p>
<p>Most all of us have endured the programming, indoctrination, and brainwashing, and can easily see it for what it is, because it&rsquo;s so obvious.  Why others can&rsquo;t has always been a mystery to me.</p>

		<p>The biggest threat to the world, humanity, and the White race, are not the dysfunctional races and ethnic groups, but the White marxist.  Some of them speak French.  I hope Quebec can purge itself of these monsters and become a free and independent French country.</p>
<p>Cultural marxists exult non Christian religions and weird cults for the sole purpose of destroying Christianity, both religiously and culturally.  I wonder if the witches know what is in store for them once Christianity is dead.</p>

		<p>White liberals in governments like this are unwittingly undermining their own legitimacy, and perhaps, political power.  Raelians and witches are not going to repay the Quebec government&rsquo;s solicitude with gratitude, support, or legitimacy, any more than non-whites will do so in return for &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; measures.  Instead, they will demand more and more, with an ever increasing sense of entitlement, and never be satisfied.  <p>Meanwhile, in the eyes of the dwindling original founding ethnic community of Quebec, the government will be steadily delegitimized, and ultimately be left without a viable base of support.  It will then be reduced to ruling arbitrarily and by force, as to some extent it does already, in a haphazard way which the late Samuel Francis memorably identified as &#8220;anarcho-tyranny.&#8221;  But eventually and inevitably, the choice really will be either tyranny or anarchy: there will no longer be a recognizable Western political tradition.</p></p>

<p>&gt; If you had written &#8220;Outspoken&#8221; instead of militant, you might have some credibility.  Militant specifically means that atheists have taken up weapons or are performing terrorist acts to make a point.  I can&rsquo;t think of one solitary case where that is true.  Yet, I can think of nearly two thousand years of militant Christianity, and I can also think of gunmen who have assassinated/murdered doctors here in the U.S. because they perform abortions.  Justified, you might argue, but is it?  My father used to say to me and my sisters growing up, &#8220;Two wrongs don&rsquo;t make a right.&#8221; Murdering to make a political point as a Christian believer is not supported anywhere in the NT.</p>

<p>I am a little surprised at Jewamongyou.  A real study of the matter reveals that before the advent of Christianity in Europe, there was no concept of Satan.  Satan is a Middle-Eastern anti-deity that is necessary for those beliefs&rsquo; dogmas.  In pre-Christian Europe, there was this issue of right or wrong and people were responsible for their acts as individuals.  Tell me Plato or Socrates had no concept of right or wrong.  The Nordics were strict about an individuals acts and individuals had no excuse or forgiveness for evil acts.  Some of you chronic posters here could learn an awful lot about your real European roots if you could get over your Christian brainwashing.</p>

<p>I agree that the most common form of Christianity practiced today supports the mixing of all races, but this form of Christianity wasn&rsquo;t practiced forever.  We are talking about the people who have stopped Moslem invasions and expelled the Moors from the Iberian peninsula.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are militant atheists who wish for the national religion to solely be the religion of multiculturalism.  There are a good number of pro-white atheists out there, but there are also a lot of atheist race mixers.</p>
<p>So I guess we have those who wish to use Christianity to further their intentions of destroying the white race, and those who wish to be more &#8220;out in the open&#8221; while destroying the white race.  Take your pick. </p>

<p>I agree.  Much of what is considered Christian ideals were adopted from Roman/Greek polytheism. Cato had a list of 44 virtues or commands he aspired to, there are only 10 commandments in the Bible.  Whites need to read about pagan Europe before they condemn non-Christians.  Christianity had nothing to do with Westernism which evolved during pagan Europe. The Renaissance, another extremely productive European period, co-incided with renewed interest in Roman/Greek mythology. </p>

		<p>The only tangible difference between Socialism and Communism is that Socialists claim to believe in God while Communist atheists worship their political masters as Gods.  </p>
<p>Progressive Socialism leads straight to Communism and it is the nature of the young to reject the old and embrace what they perceive to be newer and better than the status quo.  </p>

<p>Posted by jewamongyou at 8:01 AM on December 18 </p>
<p>Good post.</p>
<p>Actually, in my humble opinion, religious upbringing is strictly a matter of parental authority. Children are too young to digest all the complex strands of religious thoughts. Heck, most adults can&rsquo;t straighten it all out!</p>
<p>Religion being a matter of faith, this forced study of all religions (at any age) muddles the mind and more often than not destroys any faith   &mdash;   which I believe to be the real goal of the multiculturalists. They thrive on confusion.</p>
<p>Rudyard Kipling said that each faith has merit only in its own country (see the novel KIM). </p>
<p>The freedom to raise one&rsquo;s children in one&rsquo;s faith is the most important and most basic freedom of all. Multiculturalism is the death of freedom.</p>
