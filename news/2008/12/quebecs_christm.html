<h1>Quebec&rsquo;s Christmas Tree Becomes Holiday Tree. Then Back to Christmas Tree.</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Graeme Hamilton, National Post (Toronto), December 10, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Fresh off Monday&rsquo;s election victory, Quebec Premier Jean Charest has a new cabinet to craft and an &#8220;economic storm&#8221; to be tamed. So it is not surprising that his schedule might be subject to last-minute changes.</p>
<p>But late Tuesday, his office issued a puzzling correction to his agenda of public events for today. &#8220;Please note that some modifications have been made,&#8221; the notice said. But in fact there was only one change to the previous agenda, which had been issued half-an-hour earlier.</p>
<p>He would no longer be attending the lighting of the &#8220;sapin de Noël,&#8221; or Christmas tree, outside the National Assembly at 5 p.m. Instead he would attend the lighting of the &#8220;grand sapin des Fêtes&#8221; &mdash; the big Holiday tree. Same time, same location.</p>
<p>It is not the first time that Christmas has tied Mr. Charest in knots. In December, 2006, Mario Dumont, leader of the ADQ, jumped on Mr. Charest&rsquo;s reluctance to say the words &#8220;Merry Christmas&#8221; as the legislative session closed. The Premier had offered &#8220;best wishes&#8221; instead.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will be allowed even a reasonable accommodation to wish Quebecers, in due form, a Merry Christmas,&#8221; Mr. Dumont said. At the time, a spokesman for Mr. Charest assured Le Devoir: &#8220;There&rsquo;s a tree at the entrance to the Premier&rsquo;s office, and it&rsquo;s called a &lsquo;Christmas tree.&rsquo;&#8221; Last year, Mr. Charest made sure to wish people a Merry Christmas in the cards he sent out.</p>
<p>Mr. Charest earlier this year insisted that the crucifix will remain above the speaker&rsquo;s chair in the legislature, responding to a commission report suggesting the religious symbol sends the wrong signal in a secular state. So a crucifix is fine, but a Christmas tree is going too far. No wonder new arrivals to Quebec are sometimes confused about the society they are joining.</p>

		<p>Any western politician who is afraid or refuses to call Christmas should be forced to resign in shame.</p>
<p>Yes it may be a holiday tradition, but it is Christmas.</p>
<p>I am offended by those that wish me happy holidays!</p>
<p>And I always let them know by saying &#8220;Merry Christmas&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Even though I am of Quebecois ancestry, I have to admit that the ones I meet today, but not just them, but non-Quebecois Canadians I meet seem hard-headed and stubborn.  They have this idea about liberalism and they can&rsquo;t see how much it is harming their own community and how hypocritical it makes them.</p>

		<p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree more with the poster who is offended by people saying &#8220;Happy Holidays&#8221; instead of Merry Christmas. My answer is to ask them what holiday they&rsquo;re referring to. That usually makes think twice even if they don&rsquo;t have a canned retort. I recently got into a discussion with a woman I work with who labels Christmas movies we offer for lending &#8220;Holiday Movies&#8221; (this from a school founded by Catholic nuns). Her initial response was &#8220;she didn&rsquo;t want to offend anyone&#8221;. When I explained the illogical stance she was taken, she agreed with me completely. As of this writing, she hasn&rsquo;t changed the sign, but I will insist on it when I return on Monday. I will also offer her 100 dollars if anyone so much as questions the sign.  Any  victory, not matter how small, is significant. </p>

		<p>A Christmas tree is an object that CHRISTIANS, by historical agreement, have decided to display during a certain time of year to honor THEIR CUSTOMS,RELIGION and BELIEFS. All the confusion and complaints should be irrelevant to Christians. That&rsquo;s my  opinion.</p>

		<p>As and Anglo Quebecer I am very proud to say that 99% of this garbage falls dead-center in the French community. The last 40 years of Trudeauism (creeping european socialism) and hard-core socialist P.Q. (&#8216;anything from france is superb&rsquo;), have brought about this sort of garbage. A rift is starting between the socialist here and the more traditional french. More and more of them are beginning to realize they have thrown the baby out with the bath water&hellip;as socialist always do. The majority of the English in Quebec are still fairly conservative in preserving our traditions. I say, let the french starve in the dark until thley howl on the streets&hellip;.</p>

<p>&gt; Well, that wouldn&rsquo;t be so strange, after all, it is just what the new British occupiers did (and more) to the Quebecois in the 18th century.  Perhaps continued reasoning with them is a better course?</p>

		<p>I have mixed feelings about all of this. I am glad the Franco-Quebecers are having nothing to do with such P.C. nonsense. On the other hand Quebec through its zealous support of the Liberal party was heavily responsible for the flooding of Canada with non-Whites. Immigration to Canada since the late 1960&rsquo;s has basically been nothing other than a non-White voter importation system for the federal Liberal party. Now Quebec which has cursed Canada with politicians like Trudeau is finally getting a taste of its own medicine which the rest of Canada has had to endure for forty years. The Quebecers fatal mistake was to choose language over race. They could have had a quiet, law-abiding, prosperous, English-speaking Anglo community in Montreal. Instead they chose French-speaking Haitians and Arabs. They will regret this decison.</p>

<p>Actually the British went out of their way to ensure that the conquered French in New France could kept their language, religion and culture. Time for some readin&rsquo; I&rsquo;d think mate.</p>
