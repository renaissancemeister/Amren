<h1>Immigrants Reshape Post-Disaster New Orleans</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Moreno Gonzales, AP, Dec. 23, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On Friday nights, day laborers form two lines at a bustling liquor store in the French Quarter: one is to dutifully wire money to their homelands, the other is to buy $2.17 beers that medicate their lives in New Orleans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life is hard here, harder than any place I&rsquo;ve been in the U.S.,&rdquo; said Jose Campos, 37, who came here from El Salvador, by way of Florida. He pedaled his bicycle to Unique Grocery, a cavernous establishment off Bourbon Street that offers the wire service through bulletproof glass and tall-boy beers from icy bins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a dangerous place, a bad place,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But when you can find work, it&rsquo;s all worth it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the three years since Hurricane Katrina, immigrant laborers drawn to the construction and service industry jobs created by the storm have transformed this rebuilding city. In an accelerated version of the already rapid Latino migration to the South, they are forging their own support networks, establishing businesses, packing churches and starting families &mdash; a process that usually takes a decade or more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no place in the world like New Orleans in terms of how rapid the population change has been,&rdquo; said Margie McHugh, co-director of immigration integration policy at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think-tank in Washington D.C.</p>
<p>But in a city whose infrastructure already lacked public services to support its pre-Katrina population, let alone a Spanish-speaking pilgrimage, they have also become preferred victims of the city&rsquo;s infamous crime rate. And, far from wives and children, many have wrestled with the Big Easy temptations of alcohol and drugs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always difficult to be a trailblazer, particularly at a time when New Orleans is still struggling to rebuild from an awful blow,&rdquo; said McHugh.</p>
<p>Since Katrina, the Hispanic population of New Orleans has risen from 15,000, or 3.3 percent of the pre-storm population, to 50,000, 15.2 percent of the current population, according to the New Orleans Economic Development office.</p>
<p>A 2006 study by Tulane University and the University of California, Berkeley, found that nearly half the rebuilding work force was Latino. Fifty-four percent were working illegally in the United States, and nearly 90 percent of illegal workers lived in the U.S. before coming to town.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But for every hopeful family, there are others who feel imprisoned by the city.</p>
<p>One is a gaunt, 32-year-old man from Oaxaca, Mexico who spends his days on a dingy mattress, recovering from a bullet wound.</p>
<p>The man, who asked that his name be withheld because he is in the country illegally, was walking from a nearby discount store at the end of a work week. It was an opening for armed robbers who target immigrants because they are known to be paid in cash and are reluctant to report crimes.</p>
<p>After the man fled with his pay, the robbers chased him down his block, into his apartment, and fired three rounds. Two found the living room wall, one, a narrow torso now covered by bandages and scars.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A November study found New Orleans to be the most violent city in America, and the department will be adding a need for more Spanish-speaking officers to a list of needs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One answer to the language barrier has been an investment in a school that immerses immigrant children in English instruction.</p>
<p>At Esperanza Charter School, no questions are asked about the immigration status of families. The school teaches from kindergarten to 8th grade. The director is lobbying for the district to start a high school and extend the specialized academic path all the way to college.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This school would not have even been possible before Katrina,&rdquo; Director Melinda Martinez said.</p>
<p>With 60 percent of its students Latino, 30 percent African American and 10 percent white, the school has a waiting list about 15-students deep in each grade. Some never enroll because of the transient lives of their parents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes, a child is never seen or heard from again,&rdquo; said Martinez, who believes the parents were either deported, or packed up for a less-difficult places.</p>
<p>For those who remain in New Orleans, straddling a troubled city and a troubled homeland has led to disillusionment, sometimes dependency.</p>
<p>The director of the Council on Alcohol and Drug Abuse for greater New Orleans said the nonprofit had about a half dozen Spanish-speaking clients before Katrina. In the last year, the number increased to 50.</p>

		<p>In a related factor, Steve Sailer had a map of counties where the Republicans did better in 2008 than in 2004, for President.  Needless to say, there weren&rsquo;t many, and it mainly centered in a WV-KY-TN-AR belt.  But a lot of southern Louisiana was also this way, and I attribute it to the black population that will never return.  That made Texas marginally less Republican, though.</p>

Yet another in an endless series of &#8216;pity the poor hispanic worker&rsquo;. Do they hand out templates of these stories to journalist at graduation?</p>
<p>Beer is now considered medicinal and can be freely used to medicate our unhappy lives? We&rsquo;ve come a long way from alcoholism to medical therapy.</p>
<p>A word to both the journalist and the worker: no one forced you to come here and no one is forcing you to stay. This is a choice you made. Don&rsquo;t ask me or expect me to feel sorry for you.</p>
<p>On a similar topic,</p>
<p>There are a couple talking points we need to get out.</p>
<p>1) As a result of the Reagan &#8220;one-time-only&#8221; amnesty, a provision was set up whereby potential employees would be required to present two forms of identification verifying they are legal US citizens. If that single rule had been followed, we wouldn&rsquo;t be overrun by illegal workers.</p>
<p>2) Obama has proposed a massive program to rebuild American infrastructure. Whenever this program is discussed, we need to remind the government and the employers of the law requiring two proofs of US citizenship. We need to ask the new administration, at every turn, are they going to enforce this law. If employers are found to be using illegal workers, what will be the penalties for illegal workers and employers.</p>
<p>If this program is funded, I can see this being used by supporters of illegal aliens to bring in more illegals to fill the quotes of workers.</p>
<p>Watch for it &#8216;cause it&rsquo;s gonna happen.</p>

		<p>How does one destroy America&rsquo;s economy?  By destroying America&rsquo;s middle-class.  How does one destroy America&rsquo;s middle-class?  It&rsquo;s simple:</p>
<p>·	Move America&rsquo;s manufacturing base and the jobs that go with it to communist China and the third world.</p>
<p>·	Import legal and illegal aliens to displace Americans in the few remaining jobs in America&rsquo;s diminishing job base.</p>
<p>·	Export back office jobs from America to India and other third world countries.</p>
<p>·	Encourage American college students to not major in the fields being dominated by imported alien labor.</p>
<p>And who is responsible for turning the world&rsquo;s top manufacturer into a third world service based economy and filling it with Hispanic illegals?  Your smiling members of congress bribed by America&rsquo;s universities, corporations and small businesses.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;the other is to buy $2.17 beers that medicate their lives in New Orleans&#8221;</p>
<p>Right, medicating their lives, or as the media says of Whites, alcoholism.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;It was an opening for armed robbers who target immigrants because they are known to be paid in cash and are reluctant to report crimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Which would have been a hate crime against mestizo immigrants had it been perpetrated by Whites.  In this case, the assailants are nameless (Blacks we can safely assume), who are merely acting out against an unjust society that marginalizes them&hellip;</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;And, far from wives and children, many have wrestled with the Big Easy temptations of alcohol and drugs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, its the inanimate city of New Orleans&rsquo; fault.  Drug and alcohol abuse cannot be the fault of the immigrants, they were dutiful, law abiding, good Catholics before coming to this corrupt land&hellip;</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;A November study found New Orleans to be the most violent city in America, and the department will be adding a need for more Spanish-speaking officers to a list of needs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because a bi-lingual police force has always been the answer to reducing crime in violent cities, that&rsquo;s why its been placed in the same sentence.  Los Angeles and Phoenix are wonderful examples&hellip;</p>
<p><br>
Thanks for the unbiased and critical work of journalism John Moreno Gonzales.</p>

		<p>Funny, a illegal, most likely uneducated person can come to one of the poorest areas of this country, WORK HARD, and make a living.  Didn&rsquo;t the dis-honorable Mayor Nagin proclaim New Orleans a &#8220;chocolate city&#8221;?  </p>

		<p>I understand that Comrade, J. Moreno Gonzales is amazed at the hard life of &#8220;immigrants&#8221;, but then, life has become hard for &#8220;JUST ORDINARY AMERICAN&rsquo;S also, hasn&rsquo;t it? These articles continue to amaze me to no end. I&rsquo;m speaking of the tone of most them, that seems to imply that &#8220;the American taxpayers have got to do everything they can to stop making &#8220;immigrants&#8221; so darn uncomfortable in this nation they&rsquo;ve broken into. Sure, we&rsquo;ll try.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that only Hispanics can be termed &#8220;poor.&#8221; When you see pictures of starving babies in some of the African countries or read a story of people who live on a dollar a day, ignore them. Only those who break into our country are poor. But&hellip;something miraculous occurs. When they get to El Norte, they overnight gain forty pounds, have new tennis shoes and a cell phone plastered to their ears. Ah, the joys of stealing the American Dream!</p>

		<p>If those &#8220;poor Latinos&#8221; are being preyed on in New Orleans&hellip; let them skedaddle back to Mexico&hellip; where they BELONG! Considering the illegal immigrants have been crowding Black Americans out of the job market for a couple of decades now, I am hard put to find a even a drop of sympathy for the illegal immigrants. s&rsquo;funny, but writer Gonzalez manages to &#8220;overlook&#8221; the harm illegal immigration is doing to American Blacks in the job market. But then maybe Gonzalez just could care less about the adverse impact of illegal immigration on American Blacks.</p>
