<h1>Activists Working on Solidifying Latino Bloc</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Hiram Soto, San Diego Union-Tribune, December 15, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In the past two years, community organizations across the United States mobilized like never before to help Latinos become citizens, register to vote and go to the polls.</p>
<p>Now, many of these organizations plan to use that structure to advance the interests of Latinos on issues such as the economy, education and immigration.</p>
<p>&#8220;The work has just begun,&#8221; said David Valladolid, who headed regional efforts to establish Viva Obama clubs and form a coalition with San Diego County&rsquo;s African-American population.</p>
<p>The National Association of Latino Elected Officials worked with Spanish-language media and community groups in a get-out-the-vote effort, and it is shifting its focus to the 2010 U.S. census and a more accurate count of the Latino population.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;If we don&rsquo;t know how many Latinos there are, then we can&rsquo;t know how many resources are needed for schools, highways, health care and state and federal benefits,&#8221; Bernal said.</p>
<p>Valladolid said President-elect Barack Obama &#8220;needed us during his campaign, and he&rsquo;s going to need us even more as the new administration begins to tackle the important issues.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Since &#8220;Latinos&#8221; represent a wide variety of nationalities, cultures,and economic situations, it is hard to believe they have any issues in common.  What commonality is there between a Cuban exile, a Mexican millionaire, a Puerto Rican welfare queen, an Argentine businessman and a Salvadoran peasant?</p>
<p>Oh!  I forgot!  Racial solidarity is only a crime when practiced by Whites!</p>
<p>Sorry!  Never mind!  </p>

		<p>  It won&rsquo;t be long now . Soon it will not even matter if whites vote or not because they will not be electing anyone to office . We will be strangers in our own land . We have lost our country . But I can&rsquo;t help but wonder how all of the Ted Kennedys, Hillary Clintons, Bill Clintons, Harry Reids and John Edwards will feel when they finally realize that no white will ever again be elected to any position of any real consequence in this country .I hope they all live to be very, very old because I want them to see the result of their idiotic egalitarianism . Even then they will probably be in denial . Hillary and Edwards have already been consumed by it and yet they both refuse to see what really happened to them . </p>

		<p>It enrages me that mainstream media report matter-of-factly on efforts to &#8220;advance the interests of Latinos&#8221; yet are completely aghast at any attempt by whites to do the same. Of course, there aren&rsquo;t many whites trying to do that any way. Most whites fit into one or more of the following categories: There are the naive ones who don&rsquo;t have the faintest clue about how the position of whites in this society is rapidly deteriorating. There is also the cluelessly altruistic, upper middle class to wealthy crowd, who are on the constant lookout for &#8220;racism&#8221; (which is practiced exclusively by whites, of course) and are found strenuously working for the advancement of other racial groups. There are the apolitical, apathetic types who are consumed by pro sports, reality TV, video games, celebrity gossip, and various other kinds of pop culture buffoonery. There are some who do have some notion that something is rotten in the state of Denmark, but have been so thoroughly conditioned to keep their thinking inside certain politically correct parameters that they have a very difficult time penetrating to the crux of many issues. For example, these are the types who realize that our public education system has declined markedly in the last 45 years but can&rsquo;t bring themselves to consider that just maybe a huge factor is the racial composition of the student body. Another category is those who understand many of the issues but are taxed to the max in terms of time, energy, and resources due to their obligations to raise their families and pay taxes to keep the government welfare and affirmative action gravy train chugging along. There are those who are angry as hornets about the way whites are being given short shrift in college admissions, employment, and immigration policy, but who are scared to voice their opinions for fear of being called names or/and suffering repercussions. You&rsquo;ve all seen the scenario play out. The white person who is merely requesting fair treatment is denounced as a &#8220;racist&#8221; while the &#8220;diversity&#8221; demanding special privileges is only looking for &#8220;equality.&#8221; There is also a group that understands what is happening quite well but is depressed and discouraged because it doesn&rsquo;t believe anything will or can be changed. I confess that I have often been in this state of mind but I encourage you to strive to be in the most positive category, which is that group which stays engaged in the process by remaining informed and making your voice heard in as many ways as possible. Keep your mind sharp, your body fit, and your resolve strong. </p>

		<p>Here in San Diego we have a downtown trolley line that runs from the mexican boarder thur downtown and off into Mission Valley. It makes a circular route through East County and then back again. There are 3 trolley cars per train. The line opened about 1981 and had 3  fire engine red cars. Lately, the cars have taken different colors. Red White and Green seem to be the current colors. These are also the colors of the mexican flag. </p>
<p>I guess the San Diego city council has made their intentions clear.</p>

		<p>Hispanics are already way over represented because both parties practically carry them around on their backs, so fawning and obsequious have they been to them, even, and especially it seems,illegal aliens. More political clout compared to what they have now would mean what  &mdash;  complete rule in this nation?</p>

		<p>These &#8220;activists&#8221; might be better advised to help cut down the stupendous amount of CRIME by Hispanics. The Hispanic crime problem is comparable to the tip of the iceberg. What you see (or hear) in the news&hellip; is FAR LESS THAN THE TOTAL AMOUNT! Look at California, or any of the border states, for example.</p>

<p>This foretells the future. The United States will end the way of the Tower of Babel, with men going off in their own directions (the dissolution of the union, and the partition of the U.S.A.).</p>

		<p>It would almost be a pleasure to fight illegals and their corrupt government from taking over our country, but the fact is, we must fight our own government first. With the pro-illegal panel gathered by Obama, we don&rsquo;t have a level playing field. it<br>
was sickning to hear Bill Richardson accept his post and speak in Spanish. He was spitting in our faces and letting us know that this administration plans to replace us with poor Hispanics who won&rsquo;t argue, will work for slave wages and keep on electing these traitors to run the country.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s happening to the US now is very similar to what happened to South Africa. Once a white majority settlement, SA&rsquo;s industrial driven prosperity attracted a huge in migration of unskilled black labor. Apartheid was an attempt to preserve the power of Afrikaners over their own destiny, but in the end they were forced through international pressure to submit to the corrupt black majority. Now, Afrikaners are abandoning in droves the nation their ancestors built, which black rule has turned into a crime infested, AIDS afflicted, impoverished mess. A similar fate awaits our country. Soon Mainstreet USA will look like a ruined version of Beaver Cleaver&rsquo;s neighborhood with sixteen barristas shuffling around in a typical three bedroom house. Sound far fetched? Take a little ghetto holiday to Plainfield NJ. Once a prosperous commercial center at the beginning of the 20th century, it was block busted by the NAACP in the 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s. Lovely Victorian mansions were turned into shabby duplexes for welfare families almost over night. Now things are so bad even the blacks are fleeing, and guess who lives on the ruins of the ruins? Yup. Mexicans. No matter how bad you think things are, they can always get worse. But Hispanics never seem to mind.</p>

		<p>This and every future Holiday season let us not forget that the director (and his son) of the classic movie &#8220;A Christmas Story&#8221; was killed in a head on collision by an unlicensed drunken Mexican illegal.  He was one of the nearly five thousand Americans killed every year on our highways by unlicensed drunken Mexican illegals.    </p>
