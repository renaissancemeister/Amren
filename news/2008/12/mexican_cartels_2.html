<h1><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28045145/">Mexican Cartels Send Messages of Death</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>William Booth, Washington Post, December 4, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The death squads of the drug cartels are killing in spectacularly gruesome ways, using the violence as a language to deliver a message to society.</p>
<p>Increasingly, bodies show unmistakable signs of torture. Videos of executions are posted on the Internet, as taunts, as warnings. Corpses are dumped on playgrounds, with neatly printed notes beside them. And very often, the heads have been removed.</p>
<p>When someone rolled five heads onto the dance floor in a cantina in Michoacan state two years ago, even the most hardened Mexicans were shocked. Now ritual mutilations are routine. In the border city of Tijuana, 37 people were slain over the weekend, including four children. Nine of the adults were decapitated, including three police officers whose badges were stuffed in their mouths.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As competing drug cartels and their fragmented cells fight the police, the Mexican army and one another for control of billion-dollar smuggling corridors into the U.S. drug market, the violence unleashed by President Felipe Calderón&rsquo;s war against the traffickers grows more sensational.</p>
<p>An estimated 4,500 people have been killed in drug-related violence since 2007, when Calderón flooded the border and other drug hot zones with 20,000 Mexican troops and thousands of federal agents. November was the bloodiest month so far, with at least 700 killings, according to tallies kept by Mexican newspapers. Some victims had no connection to the drug trade, police say.</p>
<p><b>Twisted version of &lsquo;shock and awe&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Experts say the cartels and their enforcers are attempting their own twisted version of &#8220;shock and awe,&#8221; broadcasting via traditional media, rumor mill and the Internet a willingness to fight to the end. Authorities also say the cartels are killing so graphically in order to sap public confidence in the government, perhaps hoping Calderón will allow the cartels to return to business as usual, when the smuggling organizations operated with the tacit support of corrupt officials.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Violence grows more grotesque</b></p>
<p>As the war drags on, the violence grows bolder and more grotesque. Last week in Juarez, the corpses of seven men, each shot multiple times, strangled and tortured, were lined up against a garden hedge at a primary school. The killers left poster-size signs. Soon after the bodies were discovered, the local police frequency was commandeered and songs in praise of cartels were broadcast on police radios.</p>
<p>In Tijuana last month, a man was executed inside a church. Bystanders, including children, have been killed in daylight gun battles. Five journalists have been assassinated this year, while the hotel where federal police stay in Ciudad Juarez has been assaulted by passing gunmen.</p>
<p>Law enforcement officials in Mexico and the United States say the spasm of violence is born of overlapping struggles. The cartels, and the cells within them, are fighting each other, dealing with traitors inside the organization and competitors outside, which in many cases may include crooked cops who work for the cartels. The traffickers are also fighting the police and military.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Messages left on dead bodies</b></p>
<p>The cartel killers communicate to one another and to society not only by murder but also message. In October, eight bodies were dumped facedown in an empty lot near a day-care center in Tijuana. Their hands were tied and a message read: &#8220;Here are your people.&#8221;</p>
<p>State prosecutors in the western state of Michoacan, where the small drug cartel La Familia is based, discovered a head in an ice chest in the port city of Lazaro Cardenas. Tape covered the eyes and an attached message read: &#8220;From the Gulf Cartel.&#8221; Two weeks ago, someone left funeral wreaths along the streets in the northern city of Hermosillo. State police say six of the wreaths included hand-lettered posters signed by the Gulf drug cartel. One of the signs read: &#8220;This is a message for the entire state police force, if you mess with us we are going to kill you and your entire family.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Lou Dobbs had a report on this very subject tonight, with guests who have investigated the situation, writing an article on it which appears in Newsweek Magazine.</p>
<p>Both reporters sounded super negative about the situation, even projecting a feeling of hopelessness about the chances for reversing the crime and chaos.</p>
<p>Both also pointed out what we already know, which is that almost all the police and military are on cartel payroll.</p>
<p>Drug crime is the only crime that brings in so much wealth it&rsquo;s necessary for the drug kingpins to start banks in order to have someplace to put their money, after various methods of money laundering.</p>
<p>With criminal organizations that have enough cash flow to pay standing armies and who have so many in the government and police on their payroll right now, it&rsquo;s just a matter of time before Calderon&rsquo;s government is going to be taken over by some sort of coup, rigged to look like one that involves politics rather than drug influence.</p>
<p>Dobbs asked why the US side was spared these thousands of killings and violence, and it was alleged that it was not in the interests of the cartels to pursue that kind of violence in the US right now, but neither reporter made any remarks about drug money influencing politicians and businesses on the US side, which has been reported numerous times by others in the recent past.</p>
<p>From all the information contributed to the situation so far, it appears as if the crime and violence will only increase.</p>
<p>If the neo-cons like unilateral attacks against nations that are endangering our national security or intend to do just that so much, and the importation of drugs is causing us definite national security problems, I&rsquo;m wondering why the US has never taken over Mexico and installed a true democracy there instead of doing the same thing to countries who couldn&rsquo;t harm us if they wanted to nor did they represent a threat to our national security as Mexico has for the last several years.</p>

		<p>To Ranger:</p>
<p>I think I might answer your question. If the United States invaded and bombed Mexico, trying to install a &#8220;democratic&#8221; regime there, do you realize how many Mexicans would migrate north? Perhaps some 20-30 million. I know, it&rsquo;s paradoxical, but the United States is the only country to have engaged n war, where the people of the opposing country flock to, after the shooting is over. Vietnam, Iraq, Somalia and Haiti are examples of this.</p>
<p>The USA tried to capture Pancho Villa, after he led border raids in 1916, without success. This left Mexicans resenting the USA- but they still kept migrating here.<br>
Besides, the USA doesn&rsquo;t want to cut off a cheap labor supply. There are lawns to be cut, dishes to be washed, beds to be made, especially among among Hollywood liberals. Do you think they&rsquo;d hire Puerto Ricans to do the jobs done by Mexicans?</p>

		<p>When can we expect some of the bailout money to be funneled to mexico to be given to corrupt govt officials spending it on whores and villa&rsquo;s ? Seems like the first cash infusion that we sent them wasnt enough to pay anyone off. With the money that was already sent a secure border fence could have been constructed all along the border. Im not saying that we would use american workers that so desperatly need jobs across america but it would be a nice jesture to use a few of them and fill the other postions with illegals that now find themselves in financial stress because of our economy. </p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s see&hellip;when Bush took office some of his comments about Mexicans were:<br>
&#8220;They are only coming for jobs.&#8221; (And education, medication and all the perks they can get).<br>
&#8220;If they can cross the Davis Mountains, we want &#8216;em.&#8221; (WE? Do you have a mouse in your pocket, Mr. President)&#8221;<br>

		<p>Coming soon to a neighborhood near you! (especially if you live in the Southwest). Just some more diversity, I suppose. A different, non-Western way of interacting with those one disagrees with; and who are we to judge?</p>
<p>When BHO and his bipartisan allies, such as John McCain, open the borders, de facto or de jure, there will be nothing to stop the narco-cartels&rsquo; war against the forces of order from spreading across the former southern border of the US.</p>
<p>This is rapidly rising from the level of simple criminal violence to protect shares of a black market, to what William Lind et al would call 4th generation warfare. The cartels are becoming very powerful and wealthy non-state actors, and one wonders which other non-state actors (i.e., terrorist groups), or sponsoring states, they have been networking with, or will in the future, and what types of weaponry and training they may thereby acquire. The possibilities for mayhem on this side of the former US border are almost endless once the border is completely undefended (as it likely will be under the new regime in the US), especially given the corrupt and inept Mexican government&rsquo;s loss of control over its own supposed territory. Asking Mexico to do something about narco-cartel violence is like asking Karzai to stop the Taliban. </p>
<p>Although I acknowledge and agree with the other arguments for closing the southern border (economic, cultural etc.)the argument about security is primary, and is also the one most likely to sway the ignorant or undecided. The mush headed who have not given a great deal of thought to the National Question (or any other question); or to the economic issues, are far more quickly and easily brought sharply to reality by using this line of argument than even the economic one, in my experience at least. Even people so thick headed that they can&rsquo;t grasp the economic argument, simple as it is; or who are emotionally attached to the myth of the noble savage here to save the evil white man by bringing the ineffable gift of diversity, can sometimes be brought to understand that they and their families could be in literal danger from the uncontrolled influx of violent Third Worlders into this country.  </p>
<p>This story describes one ugly facet of what it is like to live (or die) in a lawless, brutal, and violent Third World society whose more dangerous elements have been empowered by black market wealth and access to Western technology. This could be our future if something is not done. Not a pretty picture, as we apparently have such a society directly south of us, and our ruling elites desire, for whatever reason, to tear down whatever barriers currently exist between us and them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I might answer your question. If the United States invaded and bombed Mexico, trying to install a &ldquo;democratic&rdquo; regime there, do you realize how many Mexicans would migrate north? Perhaps some 20-30 million.&#8221;</p>
<p>I raised the issue in a rhetorical way to show that the greatest need for reinforcing national security is right next to our country and not several thousand miles away. </p>
<p>We all know a unilateral war with Mexico could never happen, because the political will just doesn&rsquo;t exist. </p>
<p>However, if unilateral war with Mexico were possible, I could answer your points by telling you first of all, from a military standpoint, contingency plans are flexible and could be designed to prevent just such an occurence you pointed out. No big deal. (And, &#8220;no&#8221; the US does not need peon workers, including Peurto Ricans.)  It&rsquo;s a farce perpetrated by the open borders crowd to fool people into believing that&rsquo;s the case.)  </p>
<p>Secondly, the US occupied Germany, Italy, and Japan after WWII, and they set up military governments in Germany and Japan in which the they utilized some of the elites from the existing political infrastructure in order to rebuild each country.  Japan had very, very few refugees fleeing.  Germany, not only had few fleeing, but many who had fled before the end of the war returned. </p>
<p>Although a unilateral attack is out of the question, certainly within the realm of possibility is an insurgency by the Mexicans here which could develop into a full scale war with Mexico, as a result of social upheaval due to an economic collapse.</p>
<p>If that were to occur all the things you mentioned wouldn&rsquo;t matter one iota.  Hard times make hard people.  Read Casper Weinberger&rsquo;s book putting forth points as to why he thinks war with Mexico is a very real possibility.  It&rsquo;s entitled, &#8220;The Next War.&#8221;  </p>

<p>&#8220;But there is urgent concern north of the border about a potential strategic threat. &#8220;We&rsquo;re fixated on Iraq and Afghanistan, but from a homeland security perspective, right here on our border, isn&rsquo;t this more important?&#8221; asks Fred Burton, a former State Department counterterrorism official, now a vice president at Stratfor in Austin, Tex.&#8221;<br>

<p>I agree completely.  If there were not illegal drug users, there would not be illegal drug suppliers.  It&rsquo;s really quite simple.</p>
