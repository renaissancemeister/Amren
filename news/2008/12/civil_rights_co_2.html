<h1>Civil Rights Complaint Targets Wall Street Rating Firms</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kenneth R. Harney, Los Angeles Times, November 30, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In what is apparently the first legal action of its kind, an association of community-based organizations has filed a federal civil rights complaint against two of the three largest Wall Street rating firms, charging that their inflated ratings on subprime mortgage bonds disproportionately caused financial harm to African American and Latino home buyers across the country.</p>
<p>The complaint, filed by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, alleges that Moody&rsquo;s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings enriched themselves by assigning high ratings to bonds backed by mortgages &#8220;that were designed to fail&#8221; because of &#8220;unfair payment terms and insufficient borrower income levels.&#8221;</p>
<p>The firms &#8220;knew or should have known&#8221; that subprime loans disproportionately were marketed to minority consumers &mdash; a process known as &#8220;reverse redlining&#8221; &mdash; and that those borrowers would ultimately default and go into foreclosure at high rates, according to the coalition&rsquo;s complaint.</p>
<p>Fitch Managing Director David Weinfurter said the NCRC&rsquo;s filing &#8220;is fully without merit, and Fitch intends to defend itself vigorously.&#8221; Moody&rsquo;s had no immediate comment.</p>
<p>The filing cites multiple studies that found that African Americans and Latinos received a disproportionate share of subprime loans during the housing boom years. A Federal Reserve study in 2006 estimated that 45% of mortgages extended to Latinos and 55% of loans to African Americans were subprime &mdash; a utilization rate &#8220;three to four times that of non-Hispanic whites.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because the loans themselves often came with terms that increased borrowers&rsquo; probability of default &mdash; upfront teaser rates followed by unaffordable reset payment adjustments, no required documentation of applicants&rsquo; incomes or assets, plus hefty prepayment penalties &mdash; African Americans with subprime mortgages are projected to lose $71 billion to $92 billion through foreclosures, while Latinos are projected to lose $75 billion to $98 billion, according to one study cited in the complaint.</p>
<p>&#8220;Had subprime loans been distributed equitably,&#8221; the complaint estimates, &#8220;losses for whites would be 44.5% higher and losses for people of color would be about 24% lower.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The civil rights complaint is the latest in a series of lawsuits, regulatory investigations and congressional criticism of the rating firms&rsquo; roles and conduct during the mortgage bond heyday years of 2003-05. In dollar terms, subprime and so-called Alt-A no-documentation loans accounted for 32% of all mortgage originations in 2005. Their share had been 10% two years before. Virtually all of those high-risk loans were sold to Wall Street firms for inclusion in complex bond structures that were resold, often in bits and pieces, to pension funds and financial institutions.</p>

		<p>And what if the ratings services had given low ratings to securities backed by subprime affirmative action mortgages?  (As they should have.)  Then these &#8220;civil rights&#8221; groups would have sued, alleging that their low ratings were scaring banks away from writing subprime mortgages, having the disparate impact of keeping blacks and Hispanics out of home ownership.</p>

		<p>I hope the case gets a full airing and the force that was used to give these people loans is highlighted.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re given something they don&rsquo;t deserve, and it turns out badly they go straight to the courts acting like victims, instead of whiners who complain about not being able to do or get something, then suing afterwards if the result is bad.</p>
<p>I am FULLY aware of how underhanded some of these banks and mortgage companies can be, and I wish they had been allowed to crash, but their culpability wasn&rsquo;t at its worst until the process had been ongoing for quite a while.  It was the rainbow crowd that is to blame basically.</p>
<p>It could well be that these mortgage companies are going to go bust anyway if things keep going downhill, bailout or no bailout.</p>

		<p>Look no futher than this to fully understand why a multiracial society will never work - you are literally damned if you do, damned if you don&rsquo;t! This is, of course, a charge so utterly absurd and laced with hypocrisy one almost cannot process the absolute gall necessary to level it. But then, we must remember about whom we speak! </p>
<p>On the other hand, I doubt this will hold a lot of water legally. Since the likes of the Congressional Black Caucus and a who&rsquo;s who of elected officials were fully behind all this foolishness, it seems highly unlikely there is a case here. But then, this is America 2008&hellip;and anything is possible.</p>

		<p>This is why it is impossible to deal with African-Americans.  If you don&rsquo;t give them loans it&rsquo;s &#8220;red-lining.&#8221;  If you do give them loans it&rsquo;s &#8220;reverse red-lining.&#8221;  If you don&rsquo;t strongly police their communities, it&rsquo;s &#8220;abandoning the Black community.&#8221;  If you police their neighborhoods it&rsquo;s profiling and police harassment.  <br>
These people are impossible to live with and where ever they go anywhere in the world, they destroy society. </p>

		<p>I am sure that whomever ends up behing the black-in-charge of the Justice Department (Obama selection), he/she will prosecute this lawsuit vigorously and venemously.  Pay up now Moody&rsquo;s and Fitch and save yourselves millions in legal fees.  It is a no-win situation for you regardless of how frivolous this lawsuit may be.</p>

		<p>What these blacks are saying is that they should never have been given a mortgage, that we should all know they could never have repaid it. We all agree with them, unfortunately the government said: give them a mortgage or we will sue you for racism. So they got a mortgage, it is racism to deny them a mortgage, it is even more racism to give them one.</p>

		<p>The white American&rsquo;s predicament: damned if you do, damned if you don&rsquo;t. Either way you will be blamed for black and hispanic shortcomings.</p>
<p>If the subprime loans had not been granted, you would have been accused of racism and attempting to monopolise the economy.</p>
<p>Now the whole world has to bear the brunt for the result of this dumb leftist idiocy.</p>
<p>Example: Here in South Africa hardworking honest people are losing their homes and things they worked hard for, through no fault of their own, but because of a credit crunch effectively caused by a bunch of corrupt and greedy idiots half a world away.</p>

Now the moan is &#8216;predatory&rsquo; White mortgage lenders &#8216;targetted&rsquo; the poor innocent lambs with mortgages they couldn&rsquo;t pay.<br>

		<p>The Puppetmasters&rsquo; programme to portray blacks as victims is as relentless as it is dishonest.  The individuals who undertook these sub-prime loans voluntarily contacted the mortgage companies, met with the lending agents, read through all the paperwork, were given a balloon figure as to what the total payout would be over the life of the loan, and - after all that - voluntarily picked up a blue pen and signed the loan papers.  They are victims only of their own greed, ignorance, and irresponsibility.  But they got a great return for their efforts, in that they were afforded the chance to live in houses and neighborhoods (at least for a few years) far nicer than their economic standing would otherwise allow.  In this respect, they are recipients of a windfall rather than victims.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s the non-whites and the government versus the whites today in America!  <br>
85% of non-whites voted for the black candidate, yet we still talk about &#8220;white racism,&#8221;  as 45% of whites voted for the white man!  This MAKES NO SENSE!<br>
It&rsquo;s RIGHT to pre-judge most whites to be somewhat &#8220;racist,&#8221; although the term has NO REAL DEFINITION!<br>
But it&rsquo;s WRONG to pre-judge most blacks as criminal, even though the term DOES have an actual definition, and crime stats back-it up!  The whole concept of &#8220;racism&#8221; today is SEVERELY FLAWED, and actually biased against white people!  <br>
(Who pay over 90% of ALL TAXES collected!)<br>
Our civility and kindness are being used-against us!<br>
White Americans suffer from an over-developed tolerance for those that have NO SUCH TOLERANCE for US!</p>

		<p>Actually, foreclosures in lilly-white McMansion subdevelopments, often financed with Alt-A liar loans claiming incomes of sometimes $10-20k per month (Can anyone say Joe the Plumber?) (for homes 10 to 50 times the price of homes in minority neighborhoods), and among wannabee Trumps buying (and ultimately being unable to flip or refinance) 5th, 6th, and 12th houses like hotcakes account for most of the credit discombobulation on Wall Street, who based trillions in credit default swaps on their supposedly &#8220;credit-worthy&#8221; class of people.<br>

		<p>There is no better incident to use as an example why no society can survive for very long if it contains large numbers of blacks.</p>
<p>They just can&rsquo;t compete on a level playing field with any other race, not just whites, and none of them have any business really outside a village environment in Africa.</p>
<p>Where they are in civilizations around the world they are the root causes of most problems and constant chaos.</p>
<p>In this country, besides those mentally ill and/or mentally disturbed, the majority have a tendency to tolerate whatever is necessary to keep them from rioting and burning down their communities, and the Jesses and Als hold that over the head of every politician and corporate greed merchant.  The elites go along so their wealth, position, and peace isn&rsquo;t disturbed by constant upheavals.  And, of course, they lack the courage to confront the issue head on.</p>
<p>As a result, the black problem will never be solved.  NEVER!  If they were each given a quarter million dollars, it wouldn&rsquo;t change their behaviors or attitudes much at all, and it very likely would make them even worse and more demanding.  And, I&rsquo;ve no doubt in hardly no time at all they would be over extended or broke, causing even more problems than before.</p>
<p>There are many difficulties to overcome in any white society, but where blacks are involved the problems are insurmountable.</p>
<p>Without the black elements in a white society, there would be no agents of discontent for the etnicities, who are rabid haters of freedom and white Anglo power, to use to cause chaos and destruction.</p>
<p>Our time is over.  We are in the beginning of the end, and thank God for that. It&rsquo;s now time to square accounts and rebuild on a smaller basis via secession.  2009 will be the year that will wipe the smile from the faces of those who love to scoff.</p>

		<p>This shows the hypocrisy and stupidity of blacks and their lovers. The National Community Reinvestment Coalition supported the Community Reinvestment Act;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncrc.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogcategory&amp;id=34&amp;Itemid=80" rel="nofollow">https://www.ncrc.org/index.php?option=com_content&task;=blogcategory&id;=34&Itemid;=80</a></p>
<p>According to a link on the above page, the Community Reinvestment act did NOT force lenders into irresponsible lending;</p>
<p><a href="https://mediamatters.org/items/printable/200810100022" rel="nofollow">https://mediamatters.org/items/printable/200810100022</a></p>
<p>Form the mediamatters link;</p>
<p>&#8220;MYTH: The 1977 Community Reinvestment Act forced lenders into irresponsible lending</p>
<p>But the suggestion that the financial crisis was caused by banks lending irresponsibly to comply with the CRA is widely discredited. According to housing experts, a large number of subprime loans were not made under the CRA, which applies only to depository institutions. A study released earlier this year by a law firm specializing in CRA compliance estimated that in the 15 most populous metropolitan areas, 84.3 percent of subprime loans in 2006 were made by financial institutions not governed by the CRA. Moreover, Janet Yellen, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, stated in a March 2008 speech that &#8220;studies have shown that the CRA has increased the volume of responsible lending to low- and moderate-income households&#8221; [emphasis added].&#8221;</p>
<p>Pay attention to the last line; &#8220;Moreover, Janet Yellen, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, stated in a March 2008 speech that &#8220;studies have shown that the CRA has increased the volume of responsible lending to low- and moderate-income households&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet, the Amren article above states &#8220;The firms &ldquo;knew or should have known&rdquo; that subprime loans disproportionately were marketed to minority consumers &mdash; a process known as &ldquo;reverse redlining&rdquo; &mdash; and that those borrowers would ultimately default and go into foreclosure at high rates, according to the coalition&rsquo;s complaint.&#8221;</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s look at this logically.</p>
<p>1. The National Community Reinvestment Coalition supported the CRA (Community Reinvestment Act). <br>
2. The CRA actually increased the volume of responsible lending to low- and moderate-income households. (according to the link on the National Community Reinvestment Coalition&rsquo;s web site)<br>
3.  The National Community Reinvestment Coalition is now saying that lenders gave mortgages that were designed to fail to blacks and latinos. </p>
<p>Does anyone else see a contradiction here, or am I missing something?<br>

		<p>&gt;&gt;African Americans with subprime mortgages are projected to lose $71 billion to $92 billion through foreclosures, while Latinos are projected to lose $75 billion to $98 billion, according to one study cited in the complaint.</p>
<p>hmmm</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do the math here.</p>
<p>You &#8220;buy&#8221; a house with no money down, you make no payments, how is is that you lose money in foreclosure when all you really did was get free rent for awhile? The taxpayer is losing the money by propping up the banks that made these crazy loans.</p>

		<p>A few years ago I was watching one of those shows, &#8220;Flip This House.&#8221; The guy who bought the house to flip was an &#8220;Hispanic.&#8221; Not sure of his origin, but he was obviously born here, spoke English like a native. </p>
<p>Anyway, they were in LA in the Watts neighborhood, no less. The house was a rundown small 2 bedroom. When they finished the remodel it looked pretty good, but what the guy said at the end almost floored me. He said that he could he could get $400,000 for it and it would make a good home for some woman with a couple of children! </p>
<p>When this mortgage mess started I remembered that show and suddenly understood.    </p>

		<p>&#8220;and among wannabee Trumps buying (and ultimately being unable to flip or refinance) 5th, 6th, and 12th houses like hotcakes account for most of the credit discombobulation on Wall Street, who based trillions in credit default swaps on their supposedly &ldquo;credit-worthy&rdquo; class of people.&#8221;<br>

<p>&#8220;Trillions?&#8221;   Heh, heh, heh.  Hardly.  There were some &#8220;fliping&#8221; going on for certain, but the &#8220;flipers&#8221; amounted to just a tiny few.  </p>
<p>The greatest number of defaults were in the millions of houses bought by people who just aren&rsquo;t bright enough to understand adjusted rate mortgages.  Many people made substantial sums of money, and blacks could have done it even easier than whites because the government MANDATED that they be given loans, but they didn&rsquo;t do so, because they don&rsquo;t have the intelligence to understand the concept.  An average I.Q. of 85 doesn&rsquo;t allow for a lot of expertise in anything, unfortunately.</p>
<p>As long as this country has politicians that promote rainbow utopian schemes and force private enterprise to give non-whites what they really haven&rsquo;t earned, then these catastrophes will occur.  It has absolutely nothing to do with people who bought third and fourth homes and sold them for a profit.</p>
<p>Every body in the country is now fully aware that the sub-prime people created this mess, then defaulted causing a domino effect on lending investments that were sold all the way around the world, and when the sub-primers defaulted on their mortgages the entire system collapsed.  That isn&rsquo;t even a debatable issue any more.  Only those who aren&rsquo;t able to comprehend the analysis are the ones who are still trying to deflect the blame from non-white sub-primers.  The whole world is now aware of that.</p>
<p>This is the great danger of having people in a first world society who have third world mentalities.  It&rsquo;s a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>The economic collapse looks like it&rsquo;s going to allow many areas to split up and secede.  It&rsquo;s a dream come true for millions of white Americans.  When we migrate to our areas and secede, blacks will be on their own to fight amongst themselves, instead of using whites as scapegoats.</p>
<p>That should make blacks really happy since they always claim whites are at fault in all black failure.  <br>

		<p>Disproportionately caused financial harm to African American &amp; Hispanics?  Well, our liberal president and the congress deliberately passed laws and hammered lending institutions to make huge amounts of subprime loans specifically to high risk (poor) blacks &amp; Hispanics in order to get them into homes, which they thought would be a nice vote buying thing to do. The blacks &amp; Hispanics thought it was great and about time they were helped into homes. Now they are suing because they claim they were unfairly targeted! Like children they want special treatment and if they lose somehow they want someone else to pay.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t win with these minorities - benign neglect is the only way to deal with them.  Never try to help them with special taxpayer backed schemes - it always loses for everyone.<br>

		<p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree more with poster #4. Everywhere on the whole planet it&rsquo;s the same story with those people. They play on white liberal mentality, whine their way into a state of equality and then set about destroying everything around them. I saw in the news this morning that zimbabwe (formerly Rhodesia) was appealing for international aid to combat a cholera epidemic. Their Minister of Health said the hospitals there were totally dysfunctional. Under white rule, the citizens, both black &amp; white enjoyed exceptional hospitals and medical treatment. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but didn&rsquo;t the Feds force banks to give loans to unqualified minority applicants? &#8220;</p>
<p>You are absolutely right.  The one individual most responsible for this is Janet Reno affirmative action attorney general who in 1994 informed banks that unless they could show a sufficient number of defaulting loans to blacks and hispanics the &#8220;Civil Rights for all but Whites&#8221; division of her justice department would sue the banks into bankruptcy.</p>
<p>She also threatened criminal as well as civil penalties for the bankers.  </p>
<p>So they obeyed her dictatorial orders.  </p>

		<p>Land-flippers did amount to relatively few; people who understand enough about money to have plenty to invest in real-estate also usually know that investing everything they own in one thing, whether it be real-estate, stocks, bonds or commodities futures is an excellent way to get taken to the cleaners.  Not diversifying investments makes one very vulnerable to market fluctuations, especially during what is obviously a speculative boom.</p>
<p>I watched a TV interview with a dingbat in Albequerque, NM.  She had cashed out her entire 401(k) and sunk it all into real-estate, hoping to flip the condos she&rsquo;d bought at a tidy profit.  Instead, she got skinned alive.  </p>
<p>The difference between whites like this floon and blacks who &#8220;bought&#8221; places they knew they couldn&rsquo;t really afford is that a noisy, obnoxious alphabet soup of advocacy groups are not making excuses for the stupid whites.</p>
