<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-politics/20081218/Immigrant.Workers/">Labor Department to Make H2-B Changes Permanent</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, December 17, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The government will make permanent its changes to a visa program that brings foreign workers to the U.S. for temporary nonagricultural work.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The visa program is capped at 66,000 workers per year, and places workers mostly in landscaping, hospitality and other industries.</p>
<p>The changes include eliminating duplicative applications at the state and federal levels, requiring employers to attest &mdash; under the threat of fines and disbarment &mdash; that they are following all rules, and letting the government decide what workers should earn.</p>
<p>Employers will be prohibited from passing along the cost of the new proposals to their workers, and the Labor Department, for the first time, will be able to enforce terms and conditions of temporary foreigner employment and fine violators.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The final changes will be in the Federal Register on Friday and go into effect mid-January.</p>
<p>The Labor Department first made public its plans to change the H2-B visa rules in May.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Regulatory changes in the waning days of the Bush administration will make it harder for President-elect Barack Obama to change course on some policies favored by Republicans and businesses.</p>

		<p>By the end of 2009, we will have 20% unemployment, no matter what the phony Department of Labor Statistics would like us to believe.  The fact that we are being inundated with foreign workers despite the high unemployment rate proves an obvious point: the immigration policies have nothing to do with the insufficient labor force.</p>
<p>The immigration policies neutralize the biggest threat to the socialist agenda  &mdash;  destroy the cohesiveness and solidarity of the White race that is the backbone of this country.  Anyone that thinks this problem is about incompetence or political infighting is naive.  Both Obama and McCain support amnesty and unrestricted Third World immigration.  As the Masons say, &#8216;It&rsquo;s a must be&hellip;.&rsquo;  </p>

<p>I agree with you.  Lew Rockwell&rsquo;s analysis is that our current rate is 16.5%, so we&rsquo;re close to 20 right now.</p>

		<p>Note that official unemployment rates do not include persons who have given up and are not looking for regular work, so the statistics published by the Department of Labor are simply nonsense.</p>

		<p>The unemployment rates also do not include those who are underemployed or those, who because of their age, have been forced to retire whether they can afford to or not.</p>
<p>Unemployment will easily approach or surpass the Great Depression and remember.. we&rsquo;re not in Kansas anymore.<br>
How our current national demographic will affect civil stability is uncertain. <br>
That is why they are bringing troops in, no doubt.  </p>
