			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Edmund Sanders, Los Angeles Times, December 31, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>He&rsquo;s from the same family that produced President-elect Barack Obama. He shares many of the same hopes and dreams. He&rsquo;s even got the same name.</p>
<p>This Barack Obama, 26, a cousin who was named after the president-elect&rsquo;s Kenyan father, was elated when someone with African roots rose to the world&rsquo;s most powerful job.</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt I could do anything,&#8221; said the lanky student, whose buddies now call him &#8220;the President&#8221; after his famous U.S. relative. &#8220;I felt anything is possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is no question the U.S. president-elect&rsquo;s victory has encouraged countless Africans to reach for new heights. But as the euphoria over his election begins to fade here, young Africans are beginning to see his inspirational story as bittersweet.</p>
<p>As the American Obama&rsquo;s success is institutionalized in pictures hanging in schools and buses and in speeches in parliament promoting change, many are coming to see his against-the-odds accomplishment as something that was really only possible in the United States.</p>
<p>In Africa, money, ethnicity and family connections still count more toward success than does hard work. Bribes usually trump talent; corruption tops integrity. Young Africans hoping to follow in Obama&rsquo;s footsteps &mdash; even those with the same name &mdash; may face disappointment and disillusionment.</p>
<p>&#8220;The hope might be false,&#8221; said youth activist Joshua Nyamori. &#8220;Today Obama&rsquo;s story is not possible in Kenya. If Barack ran in Kenya, he would have failed.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Yet all around him is Obama-inspired hype. The mythology surrounding the presidential campaign is already as deeply rooted as the mango trees around Lake Victoria.</p>
<p>From the campus of Sen. Barack Obama Secondary School to Obama&rsquo;s ancestral homestead, teachers, parents and elders wag their fingers at the young, repeating the mantra: See what can happen if you work hard?</p>
<p>At Obama Secondary School, in rural western Kenya, officials say students were so electrified by the U.S. election that teachers are expecting to see an improvement in year-end test scores.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} On average, only two graduates a year from the school&rsquo;s senior class of about 40 students make it to university.</p>
<p>Nationwide, the odds aren&rsquo;t much better. Despite free basic education, fewer than half of Kenyan children make it to high school. Fewer than 5% go to college.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ogweno is already modeling much of his life on the president-elect. A straight-A student, he is prime minister in Kenya&rsquo;s mock Children&rsquo;s Parliament. He&rsquo;s appeared on television defending campus protests and writes a newspaper column for teens.</p>
<p>Though he too is a distant cousin of the president-elect, his family isn&rsquo;t rich or well connected. He&rsquo;s a member of the Luo ethnic group, which has long been at odds with the politically dominant Kikuyus. Obama&rsquo;s father ran into the same ethnic roadblock when he returned to Kenya from the U.S. and entered politics.</p>
<p>Inspired by Obama, Ogweno took a year off after high school last year to work as a youth organizer, setting up nonprofit money-raising ventures to help students earn cash for school fees.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But asked to name someone who has achieved the same success and overcome the same obstacles here that Obama did in the U.S., Ogweno is stumped. He could think only of a Kenyan minister who was assassinated.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s a tricky question,&#8221; he said after a long pause. Even in his own family, unemployment is rampant and success stories are rare.</p>
<p>&#8220;My uncle has a master&rsquo;s degree in engineering and now he&rsquo;s sweeping floors,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The story of the other Barack Obama, the young electrical engineering student, shows how the best-laid plans can come up against the harsh realities of Africa.</p>
<p>He entered the world with high expectations, named for the president-elect&rsquo;s successful father, an economist who died in a car crash the day after the young man was born.</p>
<p>He dreamed of becoming a doctor and thrived academically. But his father died of malaria when he was a young boy. Then in high school, he lost his mother to cancer.</p>
<p>An uncle made sure the young man finished his studies, and he applied for medical school. But a Nairobi-based college twice rejected him.</p>
<p>The family blames tribalism and nepotism &mdash; they&rsquo;re from the wrong tribe and refused to pay a bribe. He ended up in a less prestigious polytechnic school.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As the optimism he felt after the U.S. election begins to fade, he&rsquo;s looking at his situation a bit more practically and, perhaps, cynically. He said he plans to ask relatives close to the president-elect if they&rsquo;ll help him get a visa to study in the U.S.</p>

<p>Translation:  &#8220;It doesn&rsquo;t look like we&rsquo;re going to get anything out of him and that disappoints us no end.&#8221;</p>
<p>As their group I.Q. of 70 indicates, these people have little connection with reality.</p>
<p>Jared Taylor wrote a piece some time back that had to do with some Africans wanting to build airport runways.  Their reasoning?  People from other countries that bring them money land on the runway, so it logically follows, to them,  that if they build a runway for airplanes, people will come with money.</p>
<p>Expecting a half black with Kenyan ancestry to somehow benefit them for being elected president is along those same lines, although, obviously, it&rsquo;s not quite an exact parallel.  But both instances reveal a group of people that do not live in the real world, mostly because they don&rsquo;t understand it.  It&rsquo;s no wonder witchcraft is a thriving business throughout sub-Sahara Africa.</p>
<p>There are many blacks in this country who think in the same terms.</p>

African roots?  Yes, the sperm donor and bigamist who impregnated Barack Obama&rsquo;s mother was a Kenyan.  Obama was raised in the White world by White relatives.  Had be been raised in Kenya, or in the American ghetto, his life would have been radically different, most certainly in the negative sense.  <br>

This analysis is correct.  It also leads to one solution that White America must fight:  Third world immigration.</p>

		<p>This piece says it all about black Africa.  Everything is based on tribally-based corruption, and the hopelessly low average intelligence of black Africans precludes any possibility of progress or the advancement of their &#8220;civilization.&#8221;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re a people mired in the primitive origins of the human race, and nothing other races can do by way of example will improve their condition.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m very confused. How could inspiring &#8220;against-the-odds accomplishments&#8221; be possible only in the United States when we are constantly assured that this country is so terribly, oppressively, horribly racist? And yet in this African nation where blacks run things and are vastly in the majority, without racists hiding behind every tree like you have in the U.S., you have nothing but failure, corruption, nepotism? Something doesn&rsquo;t quite add up here&hellip;</p>

<p>Just because crowd mentality comes up with a new standard that black is good, that doesn&rsquo;t make it true. Duh!</p>

<p>&#8220;Learning from Americans?&#8221;  How?  They can&rsquo;t even learn basic education in school above a VERY elementary level.   How can you conclude that they&rsquo;re learning something from a culture thousands of miles away?</p>
<p>Kenyan &#8220;learning&#8221; has been going on for thousands of years, yet they&rsquo;re still a society that will never be able to advance their country to any significant degree.</p>
<p>As the above poster points out, they&rsquo;ll be in the same mental mode that prompts them to build airports in order to get the white man to land his plane there with money for them for the next 500 years, if they survive the aids epidemic.</p>

What does that mean? How and what do they learn OCCAM?  Can you be more specific?  <br>
 It can be tiresome reading these stock responses from the Left, but it&rsquo;s also a diversion- so a bit of fun.  Let&rsquo;s just point one major difference to OCCAM.  While there may well be instances nepotism, bribery and &#8216;tribalism&rsquo; going on in the United States, there is a world of difference in our attitude towards this behavior; it is not considered an acceptable method of conducting matters.  We(bar Chicago thug politicians) do not find corruption acceptable, whereas in Africa it is, it&rsquo;s a way of life, if you can get away with swindling and crime, you are admired.  Our system of justice, our culture, our morality does not approve of corrupt behavior; this is the difference between all the &#8216;thems&rsquo; and us here in the West.  If you believe that Africans are learning corruption from us, do you believe that they are learning morality and fair play from us too?  Or does it only work one way – the way that censures America.</p>

		<p>A few nights ago, I was watching a BBC program on aid to Africa. It was made by a man from Sierra Leone who says that although life was very difficult there when he was a child, it is much worse now. He took us to visit the run-down elementary school which he attended as a boy. He mentioned that in order to get good grades, no matter how good their work, pupils had to pay the teacher a bribe!</p>
<p>I was shocked to hear that.  I never heard of such a thing.  I knew that Africa was bad, but I didn&rsquo;t know it was THAT bad.  The custom of bribe-paying is ingrained in them since childhood. Even schoolkids have to bribe the teacher to get a passing mark!</p>
<p>[PS to Occam: These people don&rsquo;t need to take lessons from America, or anyone, when it comes to corruption.]</p>
