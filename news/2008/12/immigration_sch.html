<h1>Immigration Scheme Gets Chief 5 Years in Prison</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, December 12, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The leader of a group that claims to be an American Indian tribe was sentenced today in federal court to five years in prison for defrauding immigrants.</p>
<p>Malcolm Webber also must serve three years of probation after he is released and must forfeit more than $377,000.</p>
<p>Webber was convicted in August on six felony charges arising from the Kaweah Indian Nation&rsquo;s false claims that tribal membership gave them U.S. citizenship. The jury acquitted him on a conspiracy count.</p>

		<p>This is just more proof that Native Americans are not, nor ever were, the noble, peace-loving, morally-sound people that the new history books portray them as.  In reality, long before the White &#8216;immigrants&rsquo; showed up in the &#8220;1600s&#8221;, the natives were constantly at war with each other, brutally murdering, raping, and stealing whenever it seemed necessary to them.  </p>
<p>And no, they weren&rsquo;t even ecologically-friendly to the Earth  &mdash;  archeological digs show massive garbage dumps.  They would squat in an area, use up the resources around it, and when they&rsquo;d depleted the area, they&rsquo;d just move on to another pristine place.</p>
<p>If the Natives had had bigger guns, more warriors, and a more organized fighting strategy, they would have ruthlessly decimated the white man without blinking an eye.</p>

		<p>No more of this tribe nonsense. No more sovereign nation nonsense. All are Americans. They should have the same privileges and rights as all Americans.<br>

		<p>The myth of the noble American savage is just that&hellip; a myth. Murdering members of other tribes being a national sport. As was brutally torturing captives to death. But Indians prefer we don&rsquo;t think about that side of their culture. We&rsquo;re expected to feel sorry for them, since the evil White Man drove them from their land. Kiling them at will&hellip; etc., etc., as the tear-jerker stories go.</p>
<p>Habitual drunkenness, thievery was what &#8216;peaceful&rsquo; Indians were noted for throughout the 19th Century. Call the conquest of America what it really was: Darwin&rsquo;s Survival of the Fittest. In this case, the people best equipped to make something worthwhile out of our country. </p>

  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -<br>
About twenty or more years ago (before the new version of history became established dogma in academia) there was an article in one of the scientific magazines - maybe Smithsonian or Natural History - in which it some scientist stated that the Indians were actually  found to be extremely destructive to the landscape and the ecology, causing massive soil erosion and the extinction of species (referring especially to those in Central America), and that the only thing which restricted them from being even more destructive was their primitive technology and thus a limited ability to do greater damage. Contrary to the fashionable modern fashionable myth, they had no repect for Nature at all.</p>
<p>Of course, all of this white-hating revisionism is necessary in order to &#8220;prove&#8221; that non-whites when left to themselves are wise and wonderful, and that whites are indeed (to quote Susan Sontag) the &#8220;cancer of history.&#8221;  Just more of the inexorable <i>March Through The Instituations!</i><br>

		<p>Because this was a federal case, Webber will have to serve a minimum of 52.5 months, up to six months of which can be in a halfway house.<br>
