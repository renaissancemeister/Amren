<p>Blonde women, both natural and contrived, are disproportionately represented in film, fashion, advertising, and television. Blonde women are generally thought of as the most beautiful, not only in northern Europe and North America where many natural blondes live, but also in those parts of the world where blondes are rare. Tens of millions of women &mdash; and not just in America and Europe &mdash; lighten their hair, while only a few darken it.</p>
<p>Many would dismiss this almost universal passion for blondeness as a recent fashion, or as a consequence of the ubiquity and power of American culture, but Joanna Pitman&rsquo;s new book <cite>On Blondes</cite.>
<p>Mrs. Pitman, who is the photography critic for the <cite>Times</cite> of London, reports that brunettes have wanted to be blondes since at least Classical times. The ancient Greeks, for example, clearly thought blonde women were the most beautiful. The poet Homer described the goddess Athena as having gray eyes and Aphrodite, the goddess of love, as having blonde hair. One of the most famous and most visited sculptures of the ancient world was the Aphrodite of Knidos, sculpted by Praxiteles in 360 B.C. She had blonde hair &mdash; the Greeks painted their statues, so there was no mistake about this &mdash; as did the myriad copies of this statue that decorated the temples, gardens, and villas of the Greek city-states. Pliny the Elder wrote that people traveled great distances to marvel at this beautiful and even erotic sculpture. One man was so overcome with desire for the blonde Aphrodite, that late one night he sneaked into the temple to be alone with the statue: &#8220;He embraced it intimately; and a stain bears witness to his lust.&#8221;</p>
<p>Praxiteles is said to have modeled Aphrodite after his mistress Phryne, who was said to be the most beautiful woman in Greece. She had long, flowing blonde hair, and she was the star attraction at the festival of Poseidon in which she emerged from the sea god&rsquo;s temple, disrobed, and waded into the ocean to offer a sacrifice.</p>
<p>The Greek&rsquo;s longing for blondeness is revealed in <cite>Aethiopica,</cite> a tale about a royal Ethiopian couple who gave birth to a blonde girl, Charicleia, because they conceived under a painting of the naked blonde goddess Andromeda. This tale represents what may be the near-universal desire of parents to have children with lighter complexions than their own. How many parents, of any race, hope for darker children?</p>
<p>Mrs. Pitman reports that the Romans were no less enamored of blonde hair than the Greeks. They, too, portrayed their goddess of love, Venus, with light skin and blonde hair. The Romans had long known of the fair-haired Celts, and military conquests in Gaul and Britain brought them in contact with even more Celtic and Germanic tribes. The result was a wave of blonde envy among the aristocratic ladies of Rome, an envy no doubt prompted by the admiration Roman men showed for the fair-haired women of the north. Roman women took to wearing blonde wigs, made from the hair of captured or slain northern European women, or dyed their own hair blonde with expensive saffron dyes. Other bleaching agents included such things as <i>sapo</i> (goat&rsquo;s fat mixed with beechwood ashes), Batavian pomade (a dying soap), lees (sediment of wine or vinegar), and pigeon dung.</p>
<p>This passion for blondes offended the pride and patriotism of some Roman men. Mrs. Pitman quotes the poet Ovid, who castigated Roman women for &#8220;using rinses&#8221; and dangerous &#8220;concoctions&#8221; in their quest for blondeness. There were safer ways to seek beauty: &#8220;[A]fter our German conquests a wig is easily come by &mdash; a captive <i>Mädchen&rsquo;s</i> tresses will see you through, &hellip; eliciting admiration galore.&#8221; However, he warns women to remember, &#8220;The praise (like the hair) has been bought. Once you really deserved it. Now each compliment belongs to some Rhine maiden, not to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The epigrammatist Martial wrote of a Roman lady: &#8220;Her toilet table contained a hundred lies, and while she was in Rome, her hair was blushing by the Rhine.&#8221; Tertullian, a Carthaginian Christian theologian, complained that Roman women &#8220;are even ashamed of their country, sorry that they were not born in Germany or in Gaul. Thus, as far as their hair is concerned, they give up their country.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is understandable that women might want to look more like rulers or conquerors, but the women of Rome wanted to look like enemies who had been defeated and enslaved. Surely, only blondes have been envied and imitated even in defeat. Southern belles had no desire to resemble their African slaves, nor did English lasses imitate the features of the subject races of the British empire. Nor did American girls during the 1960s try to look Vietnamese. The Roman preference for blondes seems to have been more than a matter of fashion or a passing desire for the exotic.</p>
<p>During the Middle Ages women continued to dye their hair blonde, despite exhortations to the contrary by clerics, who pointed to the blonde tresses of the temptress Eve (perhaps thereby making blonde hair even more attractive). For the Europeans of this period, blonde hair represented dangerous eroticism, sexual temptation, and beauty, but also sexual purity, moral goodness, and spirituality. In Christian art, angels were usually blonde, as were the chaste heroines of chivalric romance. The French court poet Chrétien de Troyes of the twelfth century filled his Arthurian legends with beautiful blondes like Guinevere and Soredamor, who had flowing hair and blue or green eyes. Likewise, the blonde Iseult from the twelfth-century tale, <cite>Tristan and Iseult,</cite> was described as &#8220;the most beautiful woman from here to the Spanish Marches.&#8221; In <cite>Roman de la Rose,</cite> a thirteenth-century French poem, the hero encounters a bewitching beauty with grey-blue eyes, a straight nose, snowy breasts, and blonde hair &mdash; features that represented the pinnacle of female beauty in the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pitman has found that if European men of the Middle Ages had a passion for fair-haired women, so did the Arabs who were their principal foreign foe. During the Crusades, the twelfth-century Arab historian Imad ad-Din records the arrival of &#8220;three hundred lovely Frankish women, full of youth and beauty, &hellip; loving and passionate, pink-faced and unblushing &hellip; blue-eyed and grey-eyed,&#8221; who had come to offer comfort and companionship to their male countrymen. Mrs. Pitman also cites the account of Ibrahim ibn Jaqub, a tenth-century Spanish Jew who converted to Islam, and traveled in northeastern Europe. He wrote that one of the purposes of his journeys was to purchase blonde prisoners for Turkish and Arab customers. By contrast, European knights did not bring home dark-skinned Middle Eastern brides.</p>
<p>Renaissance Italy and England continued to admire blonde hair. When Italian painters depicted what they conceived to be the highest female beauty, they chose blondes, as in Botticelli&rsquo;s &#8220;Venus&#8221; (1486), Carpaccio&rsquo;s &#8220;The Two Courtesans&#8221; (1495), and Titian&rsquo;s &#8220;Venus of Urbino&#8221; (1538). Venetian ladies devoted their Saturday afternoons to blonding their hair (they could choose from at least 36 recipes for bleach), and a contemporary noted that just as &#8220;the women of old time did most love yellow hair &hellip; the Venetian women at this day, and the Paduan, and those of Verona, and other parts of Italy practice the same vanity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Pitman writes that the next 200 years were an anomaly in an otherwise blonde millennium, as dark hair came into fashion, at least among the upper classes. This may have reflected the rise of France as the preeminent power. The ideal beauty now had dark brown or black hair with a fair complexion. During this period, natural blondes actually sought to conceal their true color by wearing wigs or dying their hair. Women from poor families could not afford these artifices, and the aristocracy and upper bourgeoisie associated blondness with lower-class promiscuity.</p>
<p>During the Romantic age of the nineteenth century, blonde hair began to win back its ascendancy, helped in part by the publication of fairy tales. In France, the Baroness d&rsquo;Aulnoy and, in Germany, the Grimm brothers crafted stories based on the ancient folklore of the common people, in which the heroines were blue-eyed blondes with rosy cheeks and milky-white complexions. The growing prestige throughout Europe of German culture also encouraged a greater appreciation of the Nordic look.</p>
<p>More encouragement for blondness came from the poetic and artistic fascination with the early Middle Ages. Artists and authors revived the Arthurian romances, Germanic mythology, Scandinavian epic poetry, and the history of the ancient Germans and Celts. Sir Walter Scott wrote Ivanhoe (1819) to celebrate the virtues of the ancient Saxons. His hero and heroine, <cite>Ivanhoe</cite> and Rowena, both have blue eyes and fair hair. In <cite>Coningsby</cite> (1844), Benjamin Disraeli, who later became Prime Minister, praised the Saxons for their pure Nordic features: &#8220;You come from the shores of the Northern Sea, land of the blue eye, and the golden hair.&#8221; In his next novel, <cite>Tancred</cite> (1847), he ascribed England&rsquo;s greatness to its predominant &#8220;Saxon race.&#8221; &#8220;All is race,&#8221; Disraeli wrote; &#8220;there is no other truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the twentieth century, blonde hair has reigned supreme as the pinnacle of beauty. During the Second World War, even Germany&rsquo;s enemies shared certain Nazi ideals. As Mrs. Pitman notes, &#8220;The top wartime box office female film stars in all three [belligerent] countries were blonde&#8221; &mdash; Kristina Soderbaum in Germany, Lyubov Orolova in Russia, and Betty Grable in America. Soviet art, both before and during the war, uniformly portrayed Soviet citizens as blonde and Aryan-looking. &#8220;Stalin&rsquo;s ideal [Soviet] citizen was definitely an Aryan,&#8221; writes Mrs. Pitman. American soldiers decorated their Quonset huts and B-29s with posters of Betty Grable and other Hollywood blondes, as well as with Varga girls (known later in <cite>Playboy</cite> magazine as Vargas girls), most of whom were blondes. (Alberto Vargas painted stylized watercolors of beautiful women for calendars and posters).</p>
<p>Regrettably, Mrs. Pitman devotes little space to the last several decades. The triumph of multiculturalism and anti-white ideologies has failed to displace blondes from their pre-eminence in fashion, film, and even pornography. The blonde continues to be sought after by men worldwide. In Brazil, for example, the two provinces in the southeast that have large German ethnic populations supply the vast majority of models for the local fashion industry.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pitman notes that even in so successful a country as Japan, light skin and Caucasian features are at a high premium. In the streets of Tokyo every fourth or fifth woman seems to lighten her hair &mdash; some going all the way to full blonde &mdash; and even men are beginning to dye their hair. As one blonde Japanese 20-year-old explains, &#8220;It&rsquo;s a form of rebellion, rejecting my Japaneseness in order to look more Western, to look better.&#8221; It is fashionable for Japanese women to have their epicanthic folds removed surgically, to take the &#8220;slant&#8221; out of their eyes and make them look rounder and more Caucasian.</p>
<p>Although Mrs. Pitman does not mention this, Africa and the Caribbean are large markets for hair dyes and skin bleaches, even for crude, caustic products that harm users. Likewise, most of the women who appear on Mexican television could almost be mistaken for Norwegians.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pitman, herself an attractive English blonde, draws few lessons from her illuminating study but she does ask a few tantalizing questions. She notes that many whites who are not natural blondes dye their hair in the hope of &#8220;passing,&#8221; and wonders: &#8220;Are those who blonde themselves still subconsciously seeking to distinguish themselves from darker and less powerful ethnic groups?&#8221; Mrs. Pitman concedes that non-white women have often turned themselves blonde but never permits herself to wonder whether at some level they may wish they were white.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pitman disapproves of the &#8220;racialist &hellip; belief that the blonde and fair-skinned should not marry a member of a darker race.&#8221; Yet how else are Nordics, whose hair color ranges from red and brown to blonde, whose physical traits are generally recessive, and who make up only a small percentage of the world population, to survive in a world of mass migrations? Mrs. Pitman&rsquo;s book suggests that blonde women will continue to be sought after as wives by successful men of all races. Without strong sanctions against miscegenation, the natural blonde will disappear.</p>
<p>We would do well to remember the wisdom of the English racialist G. P. Mudge who wrote in the aftermath of the terrible European Civil War of 1914&#150;18: &#8220;England still contains a large percentage of the tall, well-built, blond, blue- or grey-eyed type&hellip;&nbsp;. This is the type that must at all costs not only preserve itself against extinction, but must multiply until all the needs of the Empire are met.&#8221; We might not today wish to define our target population quite so narrowly, but if we substitute the term <i>racial reawakening</i> for &#8220;Empire&#8221; we find an almost perfect expression of the pressing duty of our age.<br>

		<p>The question posed in the by-line of this article &#8220;are Nordics the most beautiful race?&#8221; is indirectly answered in a couple of ways.</p>
<p>1. The similarity of this article with the &#8220;albino Africans hunted for body parts&#8221; article published today is that light-colored people are held in fascination where ever they occur.<br>
2. I recall there was a study that found infants spent more time looking at a light colored face than dark. Can&rsquo;t recall the specifics of that study at the moment, such as name of authors and publication details.</p>
<p>There are many racial physical characteristics from overall body shape to odor. But considering just color, there does seem to be a genetic basis of attractivness for lightness. Perhaps it boils down to an attraction to light, or day over night. Whites just happen to have a pigmentation level that corresponds to this human attraction to light.</p>
<p>That has implcations. Is it &#8216;evil and racist&rsquo; to prefer Whites or is it because of an impersonally innate attraction to light and lightness?</p>

		<p>This is an interesting history of the blonde beauty ideal.  However, here in the US, I notice our own blonds are usually dark blond with dark blue eyes or brown eyes.  I believe this comes from the mixing of ethnicities, the melting pot.  Most of the blond women I know prefer dark men and most of the blond men I know preferred dark women.  Such a shame that today marriage is based on lust and money rather than race or ethnicity.  Europe still has many  natural blonds with light eyes but for how long?  </p>

		<p>I personally have always found it depressing that in the popular culture&rsquo;s promotion of blondes mating and dating dark skinned people. That there is no value or apprecaition put into the fact that blondes are a result of generations upon generations of breding within specific northern European groups (sun bleaching aside).<br>
I always thought that if something is rare, it is valuable.<br>
But instead the loss of that physical evolution is celebrated.<br>
Heidi Klum and Seal are a perfect example of that, how many generations of breding exclusively with blonde Nordic people will it take for Heidi Klum&rsquo;s children to look like her again, if ever. <br>
Makes you wonder why our genes are considered so cheap.<br>
And in the case of her children, no doubt they will be more beautiful than the average Africanised children (being 50 percent German super model mixed with anyone will give you beautiful offspring).<br>
But her kids will still have low brows, broad noses, large nostrils, protruding jaw bones, thick bones, coarse hair etc.<br>
 <br>
Reminds me of a story I saw recently on Australian television where a couple of do-gooders had adopted a couple of African orphans from some war torn hell hole.<br>
And the parents with big smug smiles were saying proudly after having the kids in Oz for about a year, that they love Australia life, sports etc. And that they are fascinated by blonde hair  and they have blonde girlfriends (both boys of course who were about eigth years old &#8216;ish).<br>
I just thought &#8216;great&rsquo;. Another couple of white girls gone.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s so true.  Look at any fashion magazine. 90 or more percent of the models are blondes.  Even black actresses and singers like Beyonce wear golden brown and blonde wigs, even at black entertainment events.</p>
<p>Read any college newspaper.  You will find numerous ads for egg donors. A medium height brown eyed black haired girl can sell her eggs for about $5,000.</p>
<p>5ft 6 and over natural blondes with blue eyes are offered $80,000 for their eggs.  </p>
<p>Somebody likes blonde college students,even if their marxist racist feminazi profs hate them.</p>

		<p>Look at the photos of Angelina Jolie&rsquo;s rainbow family. Ever since her daughter by Brad Pitt, the pale blonde Shiloh has been able to walk, magazine editors have featured her, not her dark haired adopted siblings.</p>
<p>No sector of society harbors more hatred of whites than the publishing and entertainment sector.  But the editors have to sell their magazines, and Shiloh out sells the rest of the family.</p>
<p>A blonde on the cover will sell a magazine.  Brunette&rsquo;s, even the most beautiful and famous sell fewer magazines.  It&rsquo;s true even with royal girl friends in the English press.  </p>
<p>Prince William&rsquo;s girl friend is a beautiful, elegantly dressed vogue model type brunette. Prince Harry&rsquo;s girl friend is a beautiful, casually dressed out door girl type blonde.</p>
<p>Guess who sells the most magazines?  The windblown blonde in her windbreaker and jeans, rather than the brunette in her designer dresses.</p>
<p>I have blue eyes, very white skin and naturally black hair, the classic Irish type.  As soon as I got out of college, I colored my hair strawberry blonde.  I had to do the roots every week, but it was definitely worth it.  The men swarmed amd I did get a good job and some promotions in spite of all the affirmative action disadvantages suffered by whites.</p>
<p>My husband is a natural blonde.  Our daughter inherited his blonde hair (helped by clairol). Our son inherited my natural black hair. They are in their thirties now.  I&rsquo;ve noticed that my daughter has had an easier time both in school, socially and at work than my son.</p>
<p>It could be the difference between blonde and black hair.  I know it made a difference to me.</p>
<p>I advise any white woman who wants to get married to get out the bleach bottle.  No matter how artificial and dried out your hair looks, the men will swarm.  The more the men swarm, the greater chance one of the swarm will want marriage.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also noticed that in those numerous advertisements featuring a white woman and a black man, the white woman is always a blonde.  Has anyone seen an advertisement featuring a white man and a white woman together in the last 20 years?  I haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The advertisers probably learned that ads showing non white couples got no response.  So they may be using blonde white woman in those ads more to sell their products than to destroy the white race.  They probably noticed that ads need at least one blonde woman to be effective.</p>

		<p>Coming from a dark-haired female:</p>
<p>I do think there is more contrast in a person that has dark hair.<br>
If a lady with dark hair is naturally pretty in the face, good bone structure, the dark hair makes the lady very striking. I guess this is why I&rsquo;ve always been more attracted to men with dark hair. Maybe their good features stand out more.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get in debates of who is more beautiful, smarter, etc, blondes or brunettes; but this is just one observation.</p>

		<p>I am always disappointed when I see these articles about White women being more beautiful than women from other races. Since they say, in effect, &#8216;we&rsquo;re better than others&rsquo;, they always start endless arguments and attract low level comments. I think some go on online for years. How childish. </p>
<p>If indeed White people just want to be left alone to live their lives unmolested and unencumbered by other races, what on earth is the point of these discussions? </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to see more attention paid to inventions and discoveries by Whites, and stories about the often interesting people who made them. In Europe I watched a weekly tv show about modern inventions, they&rsquo;d have two per episode. They were fascinating, and guess what, all the inventors were White. I remember particularly the man who invented contact lenses. </p>

		<p>In ancient Mediterranic world, blondes are praised because are uncommon. Look all the thousands of Roman paitings and mosaics. There is (almost) no blondes. And almost allways they represent slaves. Blond was connected with sex and lust with slaves of Celtic or Germanic origin(after Slavs, also). To the ancient &#8220;intellectuals&#8221; blondes &#8220;races&#8221; are inferior but beautifull. Contrary to the suggestion of Hollywood movies, Romans don´t look Anglo and their slaves are not Blacks. They look modern Italians or Spaniards and their slaves look English or Germans. In Islamic world, a White (female) slave could cost ten times more than a Black one. Specially if was blonde.<br>
In modern world, get a White female became a simbol of status to non-whites. Even more if is blonde&hellip;<br>

		<p>Hollywood and the advertising industry has tried mightily the past few decades to find women (not blonde or redhead) that would have anything like the impact of the real article. They have failed mostly. They have found a few dark-haired exotics, mostly Latino, that have been overpaid to entertain their own ethnic populations. There are so few black women that have bubbled to the top of the food chain, but still they are overrepresented on stage and screen.</p>

		<p>My wife has blonde hair, whereas I do not.  We have two daughters, one being blonde, yet we hold them to be equally beautiful. If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, blondism is a relatively recent development in humans.</p>

		<p>My mother used to investigate sexual harrassment as part of her mandate at work. And a defense Pacific Islanders etc. would use when accussed for anything from inappropriate touching to full blown rape. Was that the only entertainment they got on the Islands (this was in the late eighties/early ninties )was Western television, Hollywood movies and porn on video.<br>
With blonde woman featuring especially. <br>
And that all of these Western woman were depicted as being sexually inviting and aggressive and/or sexually manipulative. <br>
And these attacks were of course almost always on white woman.</p>
<p>So when we complain that blonde woman for instances are the most beautiful (eye of the holder?) and that too many ethnicities are over represented in popular entertainment, I can&rsquo;t help but think that once these other groups are in our countries that it preferable that they drool over their own woman rather than having these blonde Goddesses displayed with the message that they are the alpha female that you need to &#8216;obtain&rsquo; to be successful.<br>
I know it is annoying and the more racial variety both sexes are shown, the harder it will be to encourage homogeneous pairing.</p>
<p>What would be preferable would be to have white specific entertainment without a big outcry. For some reason whites can not have anything seperate and we have to share everything and be inclusive with everyone.<br>
Once the barbarians are in the gates it seems like more and more concessions have to be made.<br>
PS pardon me miss spelling breeding in my prior post, hard to claim it as a typo twice.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The writer has forgotten the pictures of Charlize Theron, etc., which should have illustrated this article!<br>
Posted by dchamil at 5:49 PM on December 12&#8221;</p>
<p>Ms. Theron is currently starring opposite Will Smith in the latest &#8220;Hancock&#8221; movie. As many have already pointed out, the black man and blond woman is greatly overrepresented. That is of course not by random chance in the media (and reflected in real life).</p>
<p>What seems to have happened in the media since some time in the 1990s is the ideal he-man has changed but the ideal woman has remained the same. Why that is I&rsquo;d like to hear your theories.</p>

		<p>I have noticed a disappearance of the blond in the media. Most commercials seem to feature ethnic women. White characters on tv shows are being replaced by blacks, like beautiful blond A.J. of &#8220;Criminal Minds&#8221;. What&rsquo;s just as disturbing (if not more so) to me is the replacement of the white male. It seems that those in charge are either women or blacks. If life does in fact imitate art, then we are in big trouble in America, indeed the whole West. In our traditional world of a large pool of smart competent white men, the best  would rise to the top. In our nightmare universe of Affirmative Action, the least can an do rise to the top. </p>

		<p>And the Marxist social engineers would claim that this near universal attraction to blondes is merely the result of social programing and indoctrination.  People from primitive cultures who have had no contact with Europeans, have been given tests to identify what faces they thought were the most beautiful.  Guess what?  Even they chose the blonde-haired, blue-eyed symmetrical faces.</p>
<p>As far as I know, no women from any culture are trying to look more african, through beauty products and cosmetic surgery.  One of the keys to beauty is refinement  &mdash;  you start with the rough human specimen, then you refine and perfect it over centuries, through conscious and selective breeding.  Blacks are clearly far too indiscriminate in their breeding patterns to improve much in physical beauty.</p>
<p>Their only hope is to jump a couple hundred thousand years of evolution by breeding with a beautiful white woman with those traits, like Seal did.  Call it &#8216;genetic affirmative action,&rsquo; if you will.  The results are hardly impressive.  </p>

		<p>The media is much more interested in hyping non-white women these days, or racially mixed hybrids. But I don&rsquo;t think the Beyonce&rsquo;s, Alicia Key&rsquo;s or Jlo&rsquo;s of today, have anything over yesterday&rsquo;s classic white Hollywood beauties, be they blondes, redheads or brunettes. And regardless of whether their hair color was natural or not. How could any of them compare to the likes of Marilyn Monroe, Maureen O&rsquo;Hara, Vivien Leigh, Grace Kelly, Natalie Wood, Sharon Tate, Ann Margret, Ursula Andress and so on? I am almost repulsed by the women the media fixates on today. These urbanized, ghettoized females are all far from feminine, and far from appealing.<br>

		<p>&#8220;In ancient Mediterranic world, blondes are praised because are uncommon. Look all the thousands of Roman paitings and mosaics. There is (almost) no blondes. And almost allways they represent slaves. Blond was connected with sex and lust with slaves of Celtic or Germanic origin(after Slavs, also). To the ancient &ldquo;intellectuals&rdquo; blondes &ldquo;races&rdquo; are inferior but beautifull. Contrary to the suggestion of Hollywood movies, Romans don´t look Anglo and their slaves are not Blacks. They look modern Italians or Spaniards and their slaves look English or Germans. In Islamic world, a White (female) slave could cost ten times more than a Black one. Specially if was blonde.<br>
In modern world, get a White female became a simbol of status to non-whites. Even more if is blonde&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
You mean mosaics like this and slaves like him?<br>

		<p>For a while we lived in Louisiana&rsquo;s St. Tammany Parish.  At that time it was a white flight destination exurb across Lake Ponchartrain from New Orleans.  The natives, and the first wave of newcomers, were largely blond.  But soon, distinctly non-blond families were moving across the lake, too. </p>
<p>After a while, sitting in restaurants, we were able to accurately predict who would be loud and disruptive, and who would not be, based entirely on coloring.  Blond families were invariably quiet as mice&hellip;totally well-behaved&hellip;children absolutely under control.  Black-haired, olive-skinned families were frequently (it varied with ethnicity, IQ and income) so loud we would have to leave.  But loudness (within white European/Mediterranean stock) seemed to increase in direct proportion to coloring.</p>
<p>By the time Katrina had dumped New Orleans&rsquo; black elite in St. Tammany, we had fled.  But I&rsquo;m told they seem to prefer to be seated next to blond families.  They, too, seem to know who will be best behaved.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that my own relatives who (by some miracle) were born blond have far a far better sense of smell than I do.  Their color sense seems more acute, too.  And they seem to have more pleasing personalities than the rest of us. </p>
<p>My framer is a blond Slovak&hellip;100% indigenous European, as far as I know.  My Latin mind grasps the geometry of the frames more easily (I tend to specify mystifyingly complex frame assemblies), but I am humbled by his innately superior Slavic color perception. </p>
<p>My favorite builder is a stocky, ultra-blond Highland Scot (presumably pre-Aryan).  Again, I have to lead him, initially, on geometry and concept.  But after that, he and his white-boy crew take a project beyond any level of quality I could even conceive.  One has to wonder how much of western civilization was built this way; cooperative synthesis between the concept-adept Semitic mind and the quality-adept Norse mind.  </p>
<p>There is more to blondness than hair color.  Has anyone ever indexed scores for narcissism, ALTRUISM, foresight, IMPULSE CONTROL, etc. with coloring&hellip;controlled for race?  Surely there is some outlaw behavioral scientist out there who could venture into that forbidden realm&hellip;</p>

<p>Very true! The dumb blonde myth, was a stereotype manufacured in Hollywood because of stars like Judy Holliday, Mami Van Doren, Jayne Mansfield and the like. The fact that their lines were scripted, and almost none of them were natural blondes is almost always ignored.</p>
<p>In any case I remember when they were attemting to cast the female lead in Silence of the lambs, the producer and casting director were searching out intelligent actresses who would be convincing in the role. They narrowed in down to two women, Jodie Foster, and Sharon Stone, two natural blondes who were known in the industry as being very bright, and intelligent. Only problem was both were blonde, and they worried the audience would find their blonde hair made them come across as too glamourus, too dumb, and not serious enough. The part of course went to Foster, and her hair was darkend for it. Ironic, Hollywood is afraid to break the very stereotypes it created in the first place.</p>

		<p>This is perfect&hellip;</p>
<p>  Just today I took a final exam for my sociology class at WSU.  The professor is a young black man, who taught me all about racism.  That seemed to be the focus of every lecture that I attended (two out of about a dozen).  Here are some questions from the final, word for word:</p>
<p>-True or false: there is biological proof that race exists.</p>
<p>-Which statement comes closest to explaining why race came into existence in the U.S. and around the world?</p>
<p>A.	It was historically used to justify exploitation and to distinguish the social-economic opportunities (i.e. jobs, housing, education) available for the dominant group from everyone else  </p>
<p>B.	It is proof of the superiority of whites and the inferiority of all other races </p>
<p>-True or False, one reason that Asian Americans have eyelid surgeries and black women straighten their hair is to blend in to the image of beauty established by the dominant group  (whites) through magazines, commercials, movies, sitcoms, the news, billboards etc. in this country. <br>
  <br>
-T/F: If Asians colonized the world, owned the major media markets in the world, and established the dominant image of beauty as Asian women through magazines, commercials, movies, sitcoms, the news, billboards, etc. Asians would still get eyelid surgery</p>
<p>-T/F: If Africans colonized the world, owned the major media markets in the world, and established the dominant image of beauty as African women through magazines, commercials, movies, sitcoms, the news, billboards, etc. non-Africans would try to look like Africans</p>
<p>-Which statement comes closest to reflecting why blacks and Hispanics tend to do worse in school than do whites? <br>
A.	Blacks and Hispanic parents care less about school <br>
B.	Black and Hispanic parents are less highly educated and their children tend to go to poor schools <br>
C.	Black Students care less about School</p>
<p>  I do not think he could possibly make the correct answer more obvious.  By &#8220;correct&#8221; I mean the one that gives you points.  </p>
<p>Now you know why I only attended two of his lectures.  </p>

		<p>I personally have always preferred brunettes to blondes.</p>
<p><br>
They are smarter, sweeter, and more physically attractive in my opinion.  Dark hair and some big round brown eyes are irresistible to me. (I have very light hair and green-blue eyes).</p>
<p><br>
All you folks saying that Whites with brown hair or eyes are from ancient &#8216;ethnic&rsquo; or &#8216;race&rsquo; mixing are plain wrong.  I know plenty of White people with fair skin, and extreme intelligence and composure with dark hair.  Likewise there are plenty of brunettes with blue eyes.</p>
<p>Blonde hair is a relatively recent mutation and is not linked to the same genes as our pale skin.  White skin is caused by the top few layers of our skin being transparent.</p>
<p>My family&rsquo;s genealogy is well researched on both sides, and my father even participated in a surname DNA collection project, and all of his genes were Northern and Western European in origin.  And that side of the family has just as many blondes as brunettes as blue eyes as brown.</p>

		<p>The reason that British lawyers and judges still wear blonde wigs is that people tend to trust blondes over brunettes. <br>
A blonde lawyer will be more trusted by a jury than a darker haired lawyer. <br>
People of all races trust fair skinned/haired people over others.<br>

		<p>Just a mild note,in general agreeing with the gist of this article and the reasonable comments, but in specific (the comment at 6:25 pm) The idea of the potential symbiosis of Mediteranian and Nordic confluence of energies in creating the Europe we know of old and recent,paralels my view. I&rsquo;m sure their are students of male/female ratio&rsquo;s on this web site concerning the chemical ingredients of the darker and lighter Europeans and other races as well . For instance in lions the males with darker maines have higher testosterone and again the increasing testosterone in maturing human adolescents often turns earlier blonde hair darker. In short findings would suprise me that would argue against this organic synthesis of European types,&hellip; The Mediteranean darker, more creative emotional intuitive type being starters and the more dispassionate distilled Nordics taking these ideas and bringing them to a more formal completeness in paralel to the variance in genetic underpinnings. To return once more to the article.. Of course not all blondes are the robust symetrical ideal but fairness in a woman is heavenly, as well in children and indeed there seems a quality that goes deeper than superficial as many would propogandize. As well I doubt I&rsquo;ll see the day when attractive blonde and blue women who make up a True minority in the human population will need legislated assistence as other so called minority&rsquo;s recieve&hellip;</p>

		<p>  Blond cannot possibly be a recent trait in humans . The Icelanders are almost pure Norwegian Vikings .There are a lot of blonds there .Someone mentioned a while back about DNA test .Oxford Ancestors of England does that .It&rsquo;s not cheap,especially with the dollar sagging against the pound . I was going to do it,there are so many different test though, plus I was not sure about the price since it was in pounds . I asked to be guided through it but they were not conducive to that(which I do not blame them) . So I shelved it for the time being, but one day I want that test, it would be interesting to see just how true all of the genealogy theories are.</p>

		<p>I first read this article more than four years ago, when I first started reading AR; it&rsquo;s nice to return to it.</p>
<p>This is yet another example of a way in which Europeans as a group are very gifted (and, it must be said, envied), and yet are unaware of the true extent of this until they actually come into contact with people from different races and cultures. As my sister and her friends can attest, blonde hair is VERY prized in the Near East: the attention they got from Turkish men when holidaying there bordered on sexual harrassment! I am also reminded of Maya Angelou&rsquo;s comments that as a child she often wished that her knotted black hair would turn sleek and golden.</p>
<p>Similarly, in North African countries where a few residual genetic strains still linger from the Europeans who lived there in classical times, fair hair and light skin are proudly-held status symbols. Mr. Trask&rsquo;s comment about &#8216;&hellip;the near-universal desire of parents to have children with lighter complexions than their own&rsquo; certainly strikes a chord: from Ancient Egypt to Ancient India, via Ethiopia, Persia and the Arab world, light skin has always been a symbol of class, intelligence, beauty and - in the true sense of the word Aryan - nobility. I also find 6.57&rsquo;s comment that &#8216;Perhaps it boils down to an attraction to light, or day over night&rsquo; very thought-provoking. Either way, the peoples of all the civilisations I have just mentioned were ruled by people who generally had complexions and hair lighter than their own.</p>
<p>I think Mrs. Pitman is too intelligent not to comprehend that continuing miscegenation will lead to the extinction of blonde hair: I imagine her disapproval of this &#8216;racialist&rsquo; notion is more of an unspoken obligation than a genuine belief.</p>
<p>On a similar note, over the past few years I have taken a liking to fiery-haired ladies, and there is an obvious parallel between redheads and blondes: both are something of a rarity (relatively speaking), and both are excellent indicators of Nordic racial purity. The Nineteenth-Century Romantic era which brough blonde back into fashion also seems to have been the golden age of red-haired women being depicted as the essence of femeninity. The paintings of the pre-Raphaelite brotherhood are a particularly good example (Waterhouse&rsquo;s &#8216;The Lady of Shallot&rsquo;, Millais&rsquo;s &#8216;Ophelia&rsquo; and Leighton&rsquo;s &#8216;Accolade&rsquo; are some of the most famous).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Europe still has many natural blonds with light eyes but for how long&rdquo;?</p>
<p>The Portuguese don&rsquo;t! God bless them &hellip; the Portuguese really did make a big mistake importing all those African slaves.</p>
<p>Thanks for posting this article again; it has reminded me of how incredibly lucky I am to be white. Speaking as a man who counts two blondes amongst his ex-girlfriends, I am pleased to see how prized a uniquely European image of beauty is throughout the World. The fact that this will be lost if race-mixing continues has also reminded me to dedicate myself to the &#8216;racial reawakening&rsquo; that Mr. Trask speaks of.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;If indeed White people just want to be left alone to live their lives unmolested and unencumbered by other races, what on earth is the point of these discussions?&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I think these discussions are a small but important facet in the larger pictures:  That the media, schools, government, are doing everything they can to eradicate and eliminate Whites, particularly blondes and red-heads. It must be working because Whites are not reproducing themselves at replacement levels.</p>
<p>Funny, isn&rsquo;t it, that so many races would love to wipe us off the face of the earth  &mdash;  portraying us as blood thirsty, genocidal Nazis and colonists, disparaging, mocking and impugning our history, our culture, our appearance, our heroes, our holidays, our pastimes.  </p>
<p>Yet&hellip;other races fall all over themselves and risk their lives to join the functioning cultures Whites created, then demand to live next to us in the peaceful, quiet, safe communities and neighborhoods WE created.  They use our technology, medicine, science  &mdash;  but forcefully suppress Whites who invented these wonderful things, even going so far as to claim Whites stole these creations from other races.  Hell, they even strive to look like us, dying their hair, skin, and making their faces more White-looking through surgery if necessary (Michael Jackson).</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The Mediterranean darker, more creative emotional intuitive type being starters and the more dispassionate distilled Nordics taking these ideas and bringing them to a more formal completeness&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Nonsense.</p>
<p>May we have an example of something created or started by Mediterraneans and then &#8216;brought to a more formal completeness&rsquo; by those dispassionate Nordics? Or better yet, how about listing a few modern Mediterranean innovations (after Galileo, that is)?</p>
<p>Do you know where the Industrial Revolution started?<br>
Are our laws and economic system not based on British Common Law?</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;I personally have always preferred brunettes to blondes. They are smarter, sweeter&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>You are, of course, are entitled to prefer whomsoever you&rsquo;d like.  However, to state that brunettes are &#8216;smarter&rsquo; is ridiculous  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s the old dumb blond Marilyn Monroe stereotype put forth by Hollywood as others have mentioned.</p>
<p>I wonder how the people of the British Isles, Northern Germany, and their descendants in the US, (known for their blondes and red-heads) came to invent, accomplish, and innovate so many wonderful things gifted to the world  &mdash;  vaccines, anti-biotics, jet propulsion, electrical grids, clean water, germ theory, and sanitary sewage systems (to state only a few).</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t have had anything to do with those dumb blondes, could it?</p>

		<p>Sorry but it&rsquo;s so untrue. Please come to Germany or Scandinavia and ask German men what they find attractive on women. Go to Italy and you quickly realize with whom are Italian women hanging.</p>
<p>There is plenty of dark haired women who have been sex symbols. Yet, most of Victoria&rsquo;s Secrets models are not blond (Adriana Lima, Serena Williams, Alessandro Ambrosio, Ana Beatriz Barros, etc.. So are recent actresses (Catherine Zeta Jones, Monica Bellucci,etc..) or actors.<br>
Male actors have been -however- always white, whatever his hair color is.<br>
Beauty is an extremely subjective issue. I personally don&rsquo;t find blond women attractive, southern European or dark haired British / Irish girls seems to be more preferred over blonds. The media decides who is beautiful, though.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;What seems to have happened in the media since some time in the 1990s is the ideal he-man has changed but the ideal woman has remained the same. Why that is I&rsquo;d like to hear your theories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have no theories I am confused myself.<br>
We have a cable show being promoted at the moment called &#8216;AN AUSSIE GOES CALYPSO&rsquo;. It is a travel log show of the Australian cricket team in the West Indies (majority Black African ancestory country) and this the third in this series.<br>
The first was about the English team touring here, the second was about Australia touring in India (see promo video below) and this is the third in this concept with Australia touring the West Indies.<br>
And some reason in the promotion Advertisements (sorry I couldn&rsquo;t find the video online) insist on having three very beautiful blonde women in the video in bikini&rsquo;s dancing amoung lots of blacks and I don&rsquo;t know why?<br>
Here is the promo video for the Indian tour, note the recent comments are asking for the other video to be uploaded because of the presence of these blondes, I guess could answer my question re why.<br>
<a href="http://au.youtube.com/watch?v=lL8j8vXRVMQ" rel="nofollow">http://au.youtube.com/watch?v=lL8j8vXRVMQ</a></p>
<p>Are blondes in bikini&rsquo;s simply there to add interest? But why place them just with the blacks? Is it the W.I. beach culture? Maybe.<br>
Did the advertisers get an email asking for their presence from the NWO, world bank, W.I. government or the U.N., I doubt it.<br>
I do not know why the ripest fruits of our people are placed along side these more primitive people, who are marketed to us down here as a relaxing and fun lifestyle choice. <br>
It makes no sense to me.<br>
I can only say that it is a popular image. <br>
Black men must be pinching themselves, prossibilly revenge for slavery and our chauvinistic past. Either that or something more base and animal &#8216;alpha male meets alpha female&rsquo;(Nearly every black male I&rsquo;ve been around seemed to only be comfortable as long as they are the only black male present, as soon as a second was introduced conflict with arise. And most beautiful woman I could say the same for in terms of competition in the world of superficial socialising at least). </p>
<p>PS For what it is worth Miss World 2008 is another blonde &#8216;Miss Russia&rsquo;. <br>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;If indeed White people just want to be left alone to live their lives unmolested and unencumbered by other races, what on earth is the point of these discussions?&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I think these discussions are a small but important facet in the larger pictures:  That the media, schools, government, are doing everything they can to eradicate and eliminate Whites, particularly blondes and red-heads. It must be working because Whites are not reproducing themselves at replacement levels.</p>
<p>Funny, isn&rsquo;t it, that so many races would love to wipe us off the face of the earth  &mdash;  portraying us as blood thirsty, genocidal Nazis and colonists, disparaging, mocking and impugning our history, our culture, our appearance, our heroes, our holidays, our pastimes.  </p>
<p>Yet&hellip;other races fall all over themselves and risk their lives to join the functioning cultures Whites created, then demand to live next to us in the peaceful, quiet, safe communities and neighborhoods WE created.  They use our technology, medicine, science  &mdash;  but forcefully suppress Whites who invented these wonderful things, even going so far as to claim Whites stole these creations from other races.  Hell, they even strive to look like us, dying their hair, skin, and making their faces more White-looking through surgery if necessary (Michael Jackson).</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The Mediterranean darker, more creative emotional intuitive type being starters and the more dispassionate distilled Nordics taking these ideas and bringing them to a more formal completeness&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Nonsense.</p>
<p>May we have an example of something created or started by Mediterraneans and then &#8216;brought to a more formal completeness&rsquo; by those dispassionate Nordics? Or better yet, how about listing a few modern Mediterranean innovations (after Galileo, that is)?</p>
<p>Do you know where the Industrial Revolution started?<br>
Are our laws and economic system not based on British Common Law?</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;I personally have always preferred brunettes to blondes. They are smarter, sweeter&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>You are, of course, are entitled to prefer whomsoever you&rsquo;d like.  However, to state that brunettes are &#8216;smarter&rsquo; is ridiculous  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s the old dumb blond Marilyn Monroe stereotype put forth by Hollywood as others have mentioned.</p>
<p>I wonder how the people of the British Isles, Northern Germany, and their descendants in the US, (known for their blondes and red-heads) came to invent, accomplish, and innovate so many wonderful things gifted to the world  &mdash;  vaccines, anti-biotics, jet propulsion, electrical grids, clean water, germ theory, and sanitary sewage systems (to state only a few).</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t have had anything to do with those dumb blondes, could it?</p>

		<p> Blond, brunette, redhead,everything in between, if they are white then they are beautiful . But don&rsquo;t think blonds are dumb,they are I think, different  . Ever seen a forties era Saab or Volvo training film ? You&rsquo;ve never seen so many blonds in your life . Volvos are decent cars and a Saab JAS-39 is a decent fighter jet . And I am not disparaging non-whites . I just happen to love my own people . And these days I consider my own people to be all whites . From the Greeks,to the Romans,the Vikings, the Celts,the Germanic tribes, the Gauls&hellip; they are all my people .</p>

		<p>&#8220;Similarly, in North African countries where a few residual genetic strains still linger from the Europeans who lived there in classical times, fair hair and light skin are proudly-held status symbols. Mr. Trask&rsquo;s comment about &lsquo;&hellip;the near-universal desire of parents to have children with lighter complexions than their own&rsquo; certainly strikes a chord: from Ancient Egypt to Ancient India, via Ethiopia, Persia and the Arab world, light skin has always been a symbol of class, intelligence, beauty and - in the true sense of the word Aryan - nobility.&#8221;</p>

<p>Icelanders are a homogeneous mix of Norwegians and the Irish - British. The first permanent settler was Ingolfur Arnarson in 874.<br>
Iceland is however darker than Scandinavia, Finland or Germany, due to their Irish genes (dark hair, very fair skin with blue-green eyes).</p>

		<p>Well if you are interested in a Korean guy&rsquo;s perspective on which hair he thinks is more beautiful, blond or brunette, </p>
<p>It is a tie.  Both brunette and blond hair are beautiful.  There are a lot more things that guys look at than just the color of her hair when assessing the beauty of a woman.  If there is a difference, the brunette hair gives the signal of &#8220;I am a strong, sexy woman&#8221;  and the blond hair gives &#8220;I am a picture perfect, fairy-tale woman&#8221; As long as the woman takes great care of her hair, both brunette hair and blond hair are very beautiful and equally beautiful.  </p>
<p>Both superman and wonderwoman are brunettes.  </p>

They are smarter, sweeter, and more physically attractive in my opinion. Dark hair and some big round brown eyes are irresistible to me. </p>

<p>There are numerous beautiful brunette women in this world, and there is nothing wrong with appreciating them. Catherine Zeta Jones is just such an example. However, beauty is an objective thing, and in the eye of the beholder. </p>
<p>I certainly do not agree that brunettes are always sweeter and smarter. Most Nordic countries have the most natural blondes, and have always been quite productive, and were known for their low crime rates, before their darker haired, darker eyed, darker skinned immigrant population began to over-take the region, and bring a huge crime-wave with them. </p>
<p>Also, given the fact that almost all non-whites have dark hair and dark eyes, I would not want to see a world where lighter haired, lighter eyed humans vanished from the scene, how utterly boring! Only whites bring with them the natural variety of eye and hair colors they do. Black hair, brown hair, auburn hair and red hair, all in various shades. Not to mention brown eyes, hazel eyes, green eyes, blue eyes and gray eyes. <br>
All this natural variety is glorious. And it can only continue with white people. </p>
<p>As for which group is the most beautiful? As I said earlier, that is an objective thing. I have seen beautiful people with all colors of hair. But usually I notice the whole package, like when it is combined with a beautiful face, and a fit body. </p>
<p>As someone stated here already, Charlize Theron is certainly no slouch, and would stand out in any third world country, not just because of her tall blondeness, but also because of her beauty. And yes, I do think she probably trumps the average white brunette. Since nothing about her is average.</p>

<p>&gt; Celts have always been understood to be blonde and red headed.  I have spent time in Ireland, read an awful lot on the Irish and Celtic histories and archeology.  I still do not claim to be THE expert, but my impression has always been that the dark haired Irish were due to the long political and military connections to Spain.  In Galway there is an arch near the docks called &#8220;The Spanish Arch&#8221; because of all the Spanish emmisaries that landed there over centuries of conflict with England.  Ireland was always considered the back door to England.  There&rsquo;s even an old drinking song called &#8220;The Spanish Lady.&#8221;  But I am not trying to give full evidence here but only to say, the Spanish connection is an old and well known item there.  Also, after the Norwegian settling in Iceland and the failed colonies in Greenland, Eskimos settled in Iceland.  It hasn&rsquo;t helped that the U.S. has had an airbase nearby in Greenland for decades either. I have always thought that this is why some Icelanders are darker.  But hey, I could be wrong!</p>
<p>In any event, they are all about to become a lot darker.  Iceland has an increasing Black and Muslim population and we all know about Ireland&rsquo;s 10,000 plus Nigerians along with a growning population of Muslims, Chinese and Indians.  </p>

<p>Seriously, when did Serena Williams become a Victoria&rsquo;s Secret model? Much less, a sex symbol? She may well be a remarkable athlete, but if it just came down to physical attributes, then the far less athletically gifted, and yes (blonde) Anna Kournikova would seem a much more fitting lingerie model. </p>
<p>This blonde looks far more feminine in her gown </p>

		<p>Although many minorities love pointing out the amount of non white sex symbols today. Halle Berry, Beyonce, Jessica Alba, Tyra Banks, Rihanna etc.. </p>
<p>It is interesting to note, that although they are often praised as &#8220;non-white sex symbols&#8221;, most of them are half white or have a significant amount of white ancestry in them.</p>
<p> Halle half-black half-white, Beyonce the product of a light skinned Creole Mother. Jessica Alba half Mexican half white. Tyra Banks Her green eyes and light skin almost assures that there is significant white ancestry in her family. And Rihanna black father- white mother. </p>
<p>Also almost all the black sex symbols utilize wigs and weaves of a more caucasian texture, and it&rsquo;s also not in the least bit uncommon for many of them to wear those weaves and wigs in blondish tones, such as with Beyonce or Tyra, to further whitewash their appearance. And the most recent pictures of Jessica Alba show her with blonde streaks added to her hair. </p>
<p>Does this mean blondeness if favored? Maybe not, but it does show that white genes and a whiter appearance, still figure in our idea of beauty, even if it is rarely talked about.<br>

		<p>Icelanders are the nation or ethnic group of Iceland descended primarily from Norsemen of Scandinavia. In comparison to other European populations, the genetics of Icelanders is considered highly homogeneous.  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;   William this is from Wikipedia . Obviously with our new found ability to map DNA everything becomes more complicated .And Iceland has been a complicated story from the beginning,first under Norway then both Iceland and Norway falling under Danish control. The article goes on to say that recent DNA evidence suggest it is at least 60% Scottish . Never the less, when I watch a documentary on Iceland, I see almost blonds exclusively . I think what we may have here is a situation like ancient Denmark, a blond, fair people who were a Viking culture and physically resembled the Vikings but whose DNA is closer to Anglo-Saxon as opposed to the Norwegians and Swedes . Something else too, I was very blond in my youth and my NCOIC in the GAANG who was married to an Icelander kept insisting I was either Icelandic or Swedish . I thought at the time he didn&rsquo;t know what he was talking about, my great, great &hellip;grandfather had come to America in the early 1700s from London . Now come to find out 30 years later, supposedly our name is Anglicized Danish and there was a Danish kingdom in that part of England ? So maybe old sarge was on to something .Two more questions, my wife is Welsh and 1/64 Cherokee, a brunette and relatively dark (her sister was a very fair complected brunette) both of our kids are very blond my daughter being much fairer complected than my son .When I was in school we were always told that blond is a dominant gene, I am assuming that has changed ? And wasn&rsquo;t Ireland heavily colonized by the Vikings ?  </p>

		<p>Freud said it best: There&rsquo;s a narcissm in SMALL differences; hence all the, mostly subtle, racial mixing. I m a blond/green eyed male but seem most attracted to the darker Irish type girls. </p>
<p>That said, biologically, certain features dominate and double-recessive blue eyes certainly do not qualify, so, yeah, they need to be the real protected class. </p>
<p>I mean I have a brother who had two kids with a half-Jewish woman and the Semitic feautures definitely predominate on his now-grown children, who looked more Aryan before &#8220;growing into their face.&#8221;  Every one notices it, sadly. </p>
<p>Think of most of our best friends growing up.  Don&rsquo;t they tend to be like us&hellip;but not too much. That&rsquo;s the truest form of friendship:  Groucho Marx: I wouldn&rsquo;t want to belong to a club w/anyone like me as a member.</p>
<p>Ever notice in Hollywood movies (Back to School, Better Off Dead, to name but a few) the blond children are always the bullies, whereas wasn&rsquo;t there a study recently about how the lowest melanin-producing folks are actually the most shy, the more likely to bullied themselves  &mdash;  from darker kids usually.</p>

<p>Fair enough, although I feel long dark hair does not always equal beautiful, without factoring in other physical components. Dark or light hair, is just not enough to make a woman appear beautiful</p>
<p>For example, few would find this woman</p>

		<p>Mr.Bonbon - Civilization don´t started with Industrial Revolution(maybe the opposite). Civilization started in Middle East more than 6000 years ago. Until XVIII century, World History was basically Mediterranic History: Sumerians, Persians, Greeks, Romans, Judaism, Cristianism, Islamism, the Portuguese and Spanish Empire, the Ottoman Empire, France with Luis XIV or Napoleon(a &#8220;dark&#8221; mediterranic), etc&hellip;None of this was Nordic.<br>
The first &#8220;blonde&#8221; power was Holland in XVII century. Since then, nations on wich Nordics are predomminant, became  World Powers(Great Britain, Germany,USA). And they deserve it, certainly, but remmenber that Jews play a great role in the achievements in all this countrys; and they came from Mediterranium&hellip;<br>
About Aryans: the blondest people on Earth are the Finns and Estonians, and they are culturally Finno-Ugrians and racially Baltics, not Nordics and even less Aryans&hellip; <br>
About Purity: Finns also have the biggest % of non caucasian ancestry in Europe, something that don´t destroy their IQ or the beauty of their girls&hellip;<br>
About Portuguese (Mr.James Y): Blondes makes 5% to 25%(depending on the region)of the people. Similar to any other country in Mediterranium, from France to Lebanon. And Black ancestry(slaves) is less important than in southern Whites of USA&hellip; <br>
But I have to confess, many of my ex-girl friends were blondes(most Portuguese, some Spaniards, one Estonian), but since my mother is also blonde, I think that Freud(another Med) will explain&hellip;<br>
P.S. Both my grandfathers, three uncles, one aunt, two nephews,&hellip;all blondes! And Portuguese. <br>

<p>The classic Southern belle has dark hair and fair skin-it is a very attractive combination. What is most striking is fair skin, blue eyes, and black hair. I had a childhood friend who was half Japanese. She was extremely fair with a few freckles and had blue-black hair. She was stunning.</p>

		<p>      All you Nordo-Philes, read Arthur Kemp&rsquo;s &#8220;March<br>
of the Titans&#8221; for a delightful, highly biased romp<br>
though our history. We did it all! Even Easter Island,<br>
and the Central American Civilizations. One interesting<br>
point made: the original Romans were mostly Nordic with<br>
an Alpine admixture. The old busts confirm it. Now the <br>
Italian tribes were meditteranean, so things get much <br>
more mixed as time went on. Our tragedy: we always ruled<br>
over restive, dark skinned natives. We always mixed with<br>
them. And we always dissapeared into them. </p>

I apologize.</p>
<p>@4.58:<br>
Finns are very slightly darker than the Swedes, however lighter than Norwegians or Danes (especially Karelian tribe and Finns with Swedish admixture).<br>
Iceland is however -as I said already- contains Paleo-Atlantid (or Tydal) and Bruenn stock, both of them are (in anthropological sense) of British and Irish origin, hence not as light haired as continental Scandinavians or Germans.</p>

		<p>As with most Nordic countries, not everyone in Iceland is blonde, but natural blondes are still far more represented there than in most countries around the world. Blonde hair is not in the least bit uncommon in Iceland.<br>

<p>Furthermore, &#8220;blond&#8221; means light haired (every shade between light brown and platinum).</p>
<p>Of course, Iceland is predominantly blond, I only said, it&rsquo;s a bit darker than continental Scnandinavians, Finns or Germans.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be the only poster on this page but I think I&rsquo;m quite good at the issue:</p>
<p>&gt; Celts have always been understood to be blonde and red headed. I have spent time in Ireland, read an awful lot on the Irish and Celtic histories and archeology. I still do not claim to be THE expert, but my impression has always been that the dark haired Irish were due to the long political and military connections to Spain. <br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  <br>
That&rsquo;s right. Celts have always been red or blond haired. The Dying Gaul (search on google) is a good example of Keltic type. <br>
BUT: Ireland, especially the west coast has a lot of PRE-KELTIC blood, large headed, brown haired (still tend to be rufous) but very fair skinned Upper Paleolithic stock. This type is prevalent in Britain, but appears also in Canary Islands (Spain) as well as Iceland and western Norway (around Bergen, darkest part of Norway without Lappish influence).<br>

		<p>  Jamie if you were old enough you would remember a time when Hollywood heavies were almost always dark complected, dark eyed, caucasians- Black Bart etc&hellip;? Enter the sixties, non-whites complained incessantly, not about the predominance of whites in TV,Hollywood, media etc, but about the predominance of blond hair and blue eyes in those outlets . Now you are absolutely right, the villians are almost always blond, blue eyed . The real tragedy is that our young whites, thoroughly brainwashed by Hollywood, the media,etc have bought whole hog into the white-hating nonsense and despise their own kind .</p>

Infinitesimal at first, then over decades an avalanche and a civilization collapses .If indeed this is just &#8220;our time,&#8221; as I have heard some say, then how do we survive and keep from being persecuted and bred out of existence while we are trying to regenerate ?  </p>

		<p>I always had to stay out of the &ldquo;blond vs. brunette&rdquo; discussions, As a true redhead of the most vibrant red you can imagine neither side was &ldquo;my side&rdquo; However having 3 chidren, one with red hair, one with blonde hair and one with dark brown hair, I can proudly say all 7 of my grandchildren are blue-eyed blondes and I think they are the lovliest looking children on the planet! Long live white people, and the more of them that are blue eyed and/or blonde, the better.</p>

<p>Nice post! Blonde vs brunette debate aside, the interesting thing about white people, is no matter what their hair color, it is often possible for them to produce children with any hair color. My dark haired grandfather, and red haired grandmother produced my blonde father. They also had 5 other children, 3 of whom were dark haired, and another blonde besides my father. And with the many grandchildren that have followed, there have been many with dark brown hair, light brown hair, and some blondes as well. But finally the much anticipated redheaded grandbaby has recently arrived. When so much diveristy in terms of hair color can crop up in one family, it is pointless for whites to argue among themselves over which hair color is best. I often find that it is non-whites who like to get involved in the blonde vs brunette debate more than anyone. Of course it is no surprise when black women for example, will say dark haired women are more desirable, when virtually all of them have black hair. But it is amusing when they start to place themselves in the company of dark haired whites, such as Meds, and then try and compare them to blonde Nordic types. I imagine the heart of the issue is a form of divide and conquer tatics, but it is rather pathetic. </p>
<p>BTW I am sure all 7 of your grandchildren are just gorgeous!</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;Mr.Bonbon - Civilization didn&rsquo;t start with the Industrial Revolution (maybe the opposite). Civilization started in Middle East more than 6000 years ago&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Depends on what you consider &#8216;civilization.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tired of people writing or stating that Whites either stole or borrowed their accomplishments, inventions, creations and achievements from others  &mdash;  non-Whites in particular. I&rsquo;m tired of PC doctrine that re-writes White history  &mdash;  there is a concerted effort in the US to deny us our history, heroes, holidays and traditions (read a high school textbook lately?). <br>
 <br>
I&rsquo;ve even heard supposedly educated people say that the Founding Fathers stole the idea for the Constitution from the Iroquois Nation. I will challenge this each and every time I hear it.</p>
<p>And BTW, it&rsquo;s Ms. Bonbon. There are many females on this board  &mdash;  yours truly, GetBackJack, Jackers, Courtney, margaret (all fine writers, BTW).</p>
<p>If you read my post, I never stated that &#8216;civilization&rsquo; did or did not start in the Mediterranean areas.</p>
<p>My contention is that the specific civilization created and crafted by WHITES in Britain in general and the US in particular  &mdash;  you know, the most advanced, freest, richest civilization EVER created by any peoples anywhere on earth  &mdash;  the civilization that billions of people are willing to risk their lives to enter  &mdash;  was not created in the Mediterranean, nor based on Mediterranean civilizations.</p>
<p>In fact, the Founding Fathers of the US (you know, those Dead White Men that NAMs disparage, disdain, mock and impugn) roundly rejected the so-called classical civilizations.</p>
<p>The Founders studied the democracies of ancient Greece and other nations before they created the Constitution.  In Federalist #10, James Madison wrote:</p>
<p>&#8216;&hellip;Such democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths&hellip;&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Founding Fathers of the US were dedicated to the principles of the old British common law  &mdash;  a scientific legal system based on their religious principles (yes, arising from Judeo-Christian tradition). What follows (when the laws are obeyed, that is) is free markets that effectively create abundance and lift people out of poverty (as explained by Adam Smith in Wealth of Nations in 1776).</p>
<p>Remember:  Economics Follows Law.  These laws allowed the innovative White people of the British Isles the freedom to create the Industrial Revolution, which in turn has given rise to our modern First World Technological Civilization  &mdash;   all created by White people.</p>
<p>Let me ask you this:  Which civilization would you rather live in?  One where the Rule of Law is enforced, private property respected, individuals are able to advance based on their own merits, focus, drive and hard work?  Where people are allowed to open businesses and &#8216;profits&rsquo; is not a dirty word?  In other words, the civilization CREATED by Whites?  </p>
<p>Or a civilization where chaos and anarchy reign supreme, where human rights mean nothing?  Where the government does whatever it deems to be necessary  &mdash;  including mass murder?</p>
<p>Whites have created the freest, most abundant, most prosperous civilization ever seen on this earth.  Such a shame that it is being dismantled, the Constitution not followed, by an out of control government  &mdash;  the very thing the Founding Fathers warned against.</p>

		<p> This is all interesting but complicated .I had always thought true Teutons were dark, kind of like Hitler . And the blond Germans had come from their nation&rsquo;s proximity to the Nordic nations .A quick excursion into the net tells me I have been wrong all of these years . Is there a book that breaks down the characteristics and origins of the various white ethnicities and puts it all in terms simple enough to be easily understood ? </p>

		<p>Ms. Bon&hellip;Rock the house! Who would have known Bon Bon was a ferocious vixen defending her Anglo heritage? Excellent! I hope your as beautiful as you are determined&hellip; There was a rumored correspondence between I believe Senaca and Apostle Paul&hellip; Seneca&rsquo;s thought&rsquo;s That Excellent retoric ought to deliver the divine message where as Paul believed simple words more appropriate so as not to confuse, which merrits more, substance or form.. this is paralel to my hope of your form matching your substance. Condemn me I&rsquo;m a Latin. Concerning laws respecting individuality&hellip; To each his own or &#8220;Give to each man what is his own&#8221; was a Roman maxim&hellip; So was &#8220;Dux Vitae Ratio&#8221; Reason is the guide of life. I value your just defense in the particulars of virtue that the Anglo&rsquo;s enhanced (they Do Matter) however they did not appear in a vacuum. In my reading of a condemned war leader of ancient Greece (Polybius) on entering the near east for survival (I forget his name) in any event he was told that in order to survive in the east he would need to worship leader as in the east this was the highest precept contrary the man went on, as is done in Greece where freedom is worshiped. In Sir ??? Creasy&rsquo;s &#8220;fifteen decisive battles&#8221; he makes a strong point that the battle of Marathon (Greek/Persian) and the battle of Zama (Punic) decided the fate of Europe evolving under the guidence of its own people and social constructs. As to The March of the Titans verifying that the Romans were Nordic or with Alpine mix According to (Eric the Red) I haven&rsquo;t read the book But In reading Tacitus writings on the Germans I don&rsquo;t remember seeing  reasons to believe he saw it that way, from what I remember, Ceasar in his commentary&rsquo;s Doesn&rsquo;t seem to display this either. Individuality, Republicanism and Democracy were strong currents of the classical world however unrefined they were compared to Europe eighteen hundred years later. As well As (Tuga) pointed out we also owe to the Hebrew their effort to  or their place in articulating the loving and just mind (God) of the universe. The Galilean for all the interpretations and surrounding madness, has delivered to the world an Idea of divine love that is embraced by some two thirds the world. Beauty comes in many forms. Sempre Europa! P.S. &#8220;Iron John&#8221; by Robert Blye is a good book concerning the industrial revolution.</p>

		<p>What I believe &#8216;BonBon&rsquo; is not considering is that people of Mediterranean descent have been in Northern Europe for thousands of years.  During those millennia, there was surely a great deal of collaborative effort involving Nordics and Mediterraneans.  </p>

		<p>The media can turn on and off any preferred type at will. It can make any type fashionable if it wants to. There was a time when greasy hairy chested males like Burt reynolds were fashionable.<br>
People should not allow the media, especially TV, to determine what is the preferred type. People should cancel their cable TV and use free TV only and avoid paying the networks that promote mixed pairings which reduce the number of whites and especially blondes from the gene pool.</p>

<p>This above statement really sums it up.  It is SO very true! They (the powers who control the media) can make certain types fashionable or unfashionable &hellip; at their whim.</p>
<p>Just look at the recent changes in advertising characters like Aunt Jemima and Uncle Ben. They have changed over the years. Even Betty Crocker has gotten more vague and updated to a newer type.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read articles in recent years which have stated that there is a concerted attempt to find and promote new stars who reflect the darkening complexion of America and represent a more racially ambiguous type.  Just look (for example) at Keanu Reeves, Jimmy Smits, Jennifer Lopez, Mariah Carey, Beyonce, etc.  These mixed-breed types would NEVER have had a chance at stardom back in Hollywood&rsquo;s golden years, when the male and female ideals were Cary Grant and Grace Kelly.   </p>
<p>But that was another time, another America, long gone.</p>

I also have fair skin, but I can tan better than most other white people I know&hellip;burning little. I have been dyeing my hair a dark auburn shade since college and I love it because I no longer have to deal with idiots who assume that because I am blonde I must be stupid! I am very intelligent and it irritates me that some people really do believe that blondes are dumb! In my own circle of friends I have noticed that the NATURAL blondes, are the most intelligent, while the bleach blondes and brunettes are the ditziest! I also find it very interesting that people think that blondes are &#8220;better&#8221;. I am married to a Polish/Russian man and have one son who has bright red hair, freckled skin, and eyes like mine, another son who has nearly white hair, very pale skin, and dark blue eyes, and a daughter who has dark blonde/light brown hair, grey eyes, and olive skin. To me, ALL of my children are absolutley gorgeous, but whenever we are all out in public, people seem to crowd around my red headed son. People just love his red hair and blue eyes! Maybe red heads are even more revered than blondes!</p>
