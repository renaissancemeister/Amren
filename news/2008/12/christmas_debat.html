			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Masanauskas, Herald Sun (Melbourne), December 9, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A PRIMARY school has dumped its traditional Christmas carols concert in favour of a musical event for multicultural families.</p>
<p>Pinewood Primary School, in Mt Waverley, has been accused of acting like the Grinch who stole Christmas, despite Premier John Brumby&rsquo;s warning that schools should not play down the Christmas spirit for the sake of political correctness.</p>
<p>Angry parents and Liberal MPs slammed the decision.</p>
<p>Parents Victoria executive officer Gail McHardy said it appeared the school community was not consulted about the change.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;d like to think that tradition is not thrown out the window like this. It&rsquo;s bah, humbug,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Liberal education spokesman Martin Dixon said the majority of Australians, whether from Anglo-Saxon or ethnic backgrounds, celebrated the Christmas tradition. &#8220;And it&rsquo;s obviously been part of that school&rsquo;s tradition, and there&rsquo;s no need to change that,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Principal Maurice Baker said it was decided to replace Thursday&rsquo;s carols event with an entertainer. &#8220;We thought we&rsquo;d like to present this sort of thing to our parents, and we thought the only way we could do it was in place of our carols night this year,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And we thought that was probably not a bad idea either because it gave people from other cultures the chance to celebrate with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked if non-Christian students and parents usually attended the carols night, Mr Baker said: &#8220;They can, but they choose not to because it&rsquo;s not their religion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last month, Mr Brumby urged schools and kindergartens to let children enjoy Christmas no matter what their religion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Christmas holds a significant place in Australian society and it is important schoolchildren .&nbps;.&nbsp;. gain an understanding of its historical and cultural importance to our country,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Mr Baker said Pinewood still celebrated Christmas in different ways and the carols might be back next year.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not as if the Grinch has come here and stolen Christmas,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>At Canterbury Primary School, students and teachers are getting into the yuletide spirit in a big way.</p>
<p>Principal Anne Tonkin said students had taken part in various community Christmas functions, including carol singing and helping out with a Christmas stall.</p>
<p>&#8220;It provides an opportunity for students to showcase their talents,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Canterbury parent Vicki Vrazas said her children looked forward to Christmas events. &#8220;They love it, it&rsquo;s part of tradition and respecting Christmas values,&#8221; she said.<br>

		<p>Asked if non-Christian students and parents usually attended the carols night, Mr Baker said: &ldquo;They can, but they choose not to because it&rsquo;s not their religion.&rdquo;     A good enough reason not to just as Christians need not attend Muslim, etc events.  It is not their chosen religion, so what?</p>
<p>What have the parent teacher organisations to say about this bad move?    I would be &#8220;ballistic&#8221;.   The West is threatened and in the main the people are too stupid to see the terrible trends.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Christmas Debate on Again As Another School Goes PC&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course this could be looked at from so many perspectives. Here&rsquo;s one that isn&rsquo;t mentioned much in the Western nations  where this &#8220;debate&#8221; is going on  &mdash;  -Christ said, &#8220;those who are ashamed of me are not mine and are not worthy of me.&#8221; </p>
<p>As Muslims continue to honor their religion and support it every way they can, (unlike Christians do with theirs), they will reap the fruits of their faith, while formerly Christian nations will reap bitter fruits.</p>

		<p>The War on Christmas continues.  I&rsquo;m not even a Christian, yet I find the attacks on Christmas to be more than a little annoying, and part of a broader attack on our European culture generally.  Go to any public place in America today   &mdash;   a grocery store, a mall, an airport   &mdash;   and what Christmas music do they play?  Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, Jingle Bell Rock, and worse.  No Silent Night, Joy to the World, or Hark the Herald Angels Sing.  No, everybody&rsquo;s afraid they&rsquo;ll be sued if they dare imply that Christ Mass is about the birth of Jesus.  But the media is still diligent about letting us know when Ramadan is on, and makes no pretense that it&rsquo;s a secular holiday.</p>
<p>To be fair, so far as I can see it&rsquo;s not the immigrant Muslims or Hindus, and certainly not the Mexicans, who are busy suppressing any public celebration of Christmas.  It&rsquo;s the white elites who imagine, incorrectly in my view, that those other people will be offended if the Christian majority celebrates its favorite holiday.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m actually not sorry to see this happen more and more since I feel that Christianity has done little to help white people anyway. I think we need to explore our earthly religions which were much more culturally and racially centric. Westernism was born during pagan Europe, not Christian Europe. Even the Renaissance occurred during the revival of European mythology.  </p>

		<p>As I&rsquo;ve said before, the problem is spineless Whites who eschew their own culture and pander to every other religion as well as Whites that sit back and do nothing about it. THAT is the problem.</p>

		<p>I was in Singapore a couple of weeks ago, and was amazed again at the extent that Asian cities will celebrate Christmas.  Now, granted that it is secular to most of them, and a big shopping promotion (Well, kind of like the US), but they all say Merry Christmas, and one large building on Orchard Road had a huge lit up sign with a bible verse.  Can&rsquo;t remember it offhand.  But my point is, they are not offended, because there is no liberal media telling them that they should be offended.</p>

<p>Same thing in Japan.  They love Christmas.  The stores love it even more.</p>

		<p>For all those who observe Christmas, here is my advice.</p>
<p>Cellebrate is openly and unapologetically. Refuse to give in to pressure to make Christmas cellebration a private, personal (and, perhaps, shyly) matter. Actually, the more they want to discourage you from doing so them more you may wish to do it.</p>
<p>And watch and remember those who don&rsquo;t like what you are doing (like the &#8220;PC&#8221; schools). They may be plotting something behind your back.<br>

<p>No, I&rsquo;m not a JW, I&rsquo;m a fundamentalist, King James Bible-believing Christian.  Look up Jeremiah 10.</p>

<p>Alxeandra, I have heard that point of view before and it is sad that some preachers preach this. Who was it that adorned trees with religious symbols to honor the birth of Christ? Muslims? Hindus? Buddhists? Jews? Who placed a Manger with with characters depicting the gospel story of the birth of Christ near the tree? Christmas is a Christian holiday because that is what Christians decided to make it. It honors the birth of Christ. Now Santa Claus and the other stuff isn&rsquo;t Christian per se, but again, Christians created these traditions as well, not the people who honor the religions I cited above.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not Christian either. In fact, I am Jewish. I say: let the Christmas celebrations go on, and let the choral groups at schools sing all the carols, both modern and traditional, that they want.  Do I feel left out?  Yes, I do.  </p>
<p>But you know what?  I get out of bed the next morning, see the same man I always have been, and go on with my life. The caroling and the programs have not harmed me in any way. Some of the school plays I sat through were BORING, but they did me no harm.</p>
<p>This constant knuckling under to the whiners disturbs me.  And no, it does not matter what religion or lack of it the whiners have. They remain whiners.</p>
<p>As for the &#8220;war on Christmas&#8221;, I say this: if a store wants to make me feel welcome, more power to them. If it disturbs the Disciples of Hannity when they see &#8220;Happy Holidays&#8221;, then they are whiners every bit as much as those who protest the school programs.</p>
