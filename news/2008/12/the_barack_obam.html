								<h2>Lincoln-Obama Presidential Dollars!</h2>
						<p>History was made on November 4, 2008 as American elected its first African American President, Barack Obama. President Obama will be inaugurated in 2009, which is the 200th anniversary of the birth of another great American President, Abraham Linbcoln<br>
Fittingly, it was President Abraham Lincoln&rsquo;s Emancipation Proclamation which ended the practice of slavery in the United States making it possible for an African American to become our President.</p>
<p>In a solemn tribute to this proud moment in history, National Collectors Mint is releasing the legal tender Lincoln-Obama Presidential Dollar. This magnificent silver clad coin features the well known portrait of President Lincoln on the obverse, along with the dates 1809 for his birth, 1909 for his appearance on the first Lincoln penny and 2009, the 200th anniversary of his birth.<br>
On the reverse, over the familiar eagle, in full color is a portrait of President-elect Barack Obama, with the legend President of the United States, January 20th, 2009.</p>
<p>Each non-circulating Liberian dollar is clad in 71 milligrams .999 pure silver and then enhanced with full photo-realistic color by the National Collectors Mint. Each coin also comes complete with a Certificate of Authenticity. </p>
<p>Due to high demand there is a limit of 5 coins per order.<br>

		<p>&#8220;Due to high demand there is a limit of 5 coins per order.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nothing more than a ploy to try and get the gulible who may be interested in buying ONE coin to buy more. And 5 per order? The selers are hoping their customers arent too incompetent to place 2 orders of 5 coins each if they wanted 10. </p>

&#8220;This magnificent silver clad coin features&hellip;.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Each non-circulating Liberian dollar is clad in 71 milligrams .999 pure silver&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Silver clad? 71 milligrams of fine silver? And this is a selling point? Plating a coin in silver leaves the coin holder with a minute amount of .999 silver. 71 milligrams is less than 1/10th of one gram of silver. Considering it takes just over 31 grams to make one troy ounce, it is apparent that each coin contains far less than 1/300th of an ounce of silver. The spot price for sliver is currently less than $10 an ounce. So each coin sold for $20 has less than 3 cents worth of silver in it. </p>
<p>I guess these folks are counting on Barnum&rsquo;s famous quote. There is a sucker born every minute. </p>

This bleached out brotha has run his mouth for a year over all of the change he will bring. On O&rsquo;Reilley Report, he was forced to state that his tax changes will not even go into effect until 2011. What&rsquo;s the point ? <br>
He&rsquo;s a Bilderberg Group member now, thanks to the Clintons. Everybody ready for four more years of Bush regime and agenda ?<br>
That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll get- along with a generous shot of socialist reform.</p>

		<p><i> This first collectors issue plate celebrates with the inscription &ldquo;Change Has Come&rdquo; </i></p>
<p>&#8220;Change has come?&#8221; But he hasn&rsquo;t even entered office yet! Oh, I get it! Change of <i>skin color</i>! &#8220;Change&#8221;  &mdash;  that&rsquo;s one of those racist &#8220;code words,&#8221; you see. Sarah Palin was lambasted for her supposed code words &#8220;Joe Six Pack&#8221; and &#8220;Middle America&#8221; but this blatant racial reference is perfectly OK! Obama&rsquo;s rallying cry of &#8220;change&#8221; was &#8220;code&#8221; for skin color all along. Now it&rsquo;s only becoming more blatant. And as far as that Linclon coin, I wonder if it will include some of Lincoln&rsquo;s less-than-flattering quotes about blacks?</p>

		<p>In other Obama plate ads, I&rsquo;ve seen a picture of a white family gathered around a dinner table, practically in rapture over these useless geegaws. </p>
<p>It is pretty obvious what race of customer the manufacturers had in mind when producing this junk, despite the misleading ads.</p>
<p>When I was a kid and asked my mother why one of our neighbors had pictures of John F. Kennedy on his wall, she replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;It is hero worship and it is just plain stupid! You don&rsquo;t think JFK ever had a photo of (our neighbor) on HIS wall, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>This made sense and still does.</p>

As I heard one writer put it on Obamas so called experience concerning solutions to the economy, &#8220;the guy has never even managed a Dairy Queen.</p>

When the economy has collapsed, and people are having to stand in bread lines, these plates will be a great symbol of where all of the wealth and good times went.</p>

		<p>Well, this is just peaches and cream here:</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you can own a piece of history! Celebrate the victorious election of our 44th President of the United States, America&rsquo;s first African American Commander, with the commemorative plate from the American Historic Society™. &#8220;</p>
<p>Perhaps, the &#8220;American Historic Society™,&#8221; should rename itself the &#8216;American Histrionics Society™.&rsquo;</p>
<p>For starters, this mulatto buffoon is only the newly elected and yet to be seated US President and Commander-in-Chief; he is not our first &#8220;African American Commander.&#8221; He commands little right now, not even the respect of about 58 million Americans who voted against him, nor the &#8220;African Americans&#8221; as a group who did vote for him, by about 97%. He isn&rsquo;t even the Commander-in-Chief yet, so the US Armed Services need not listen to him at the moment; let alone, his ever being our collective big pimp daddy, &#8220;African American Commander.&#8221;</p>
<p>Second, he is hardly &#8220;triumphant&#8221; beyond the election just yet, nor is this piece of crockery that is being paraded about here, a &#8220;priceless work of art .&#8221; </p>
<p>These vile plates, like the newly elected &#8220;African American Commander,&#8221; are unproven and questionable investments in a time where politics and economics are intersecting toward highly uncertain outcomes and &#8220;rewards.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think, I will invest my money elsewhere in such times and circumstances, and others would be wise to do the same!<br>

<p>  Mr. Lincoln must be rolling over in his grave right now at all the revisionism that liberals are engaged in. It was Lincoln himself who said and I quote, &#8220;there is a physical difference between the white and black races (preventing them) from living together on terms of social and political equality. And inasmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any other man, am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race.&#8221; Given this quote, I highly doubt he ever intended to make &#8220;it possible for an African American to become our President&#8221; as this pathetic article postulates. Trying to create parallels between the presidencies of Lincoln and Obama requires one to be ignorant of the facts.<br>

<p>I heard that there was an Obama cookie in Iowa. I thought they meant they had put his face on a darn cookie. It turns out that he and his family loved the cookies at some little restaurant where he spent a lot of time while campaining. That restaurant if cleaning up!</p>

		<p>The plate commercial is really a piece of work. &#8220;First African-American President Elect Barack Obama&rsquo;s confident smile and kind eyes are an inspiration to us all, so why not commemorate his historic achievement on a &#8220;priceless work of art,&#8221; in the form of a collectible plate?&#8221; Saturday Night Live couldn&rsquo;t do better than this. I&rsquo;m going to go ahead and buy one only because of the big yucks it will get whenever anyone sees it on display in my home.</p>

Alabama County Passes Obama Holiday<br>
Gov&rsquo;t Workers Will Get Day Off In November &#8216;09</p>
<p>MARION, Ala.   &mdash;   Next year, there will already be a holiday in honor of President-elect Barack Obama.</p>
<p>At least, in Perry County in central Alabama.</p>
<p>The 40 or so government workers in the county will be getting a day off on the second Monday in November, now that county commissioners have passed a measure recognizing the holiday.</p>
<p>The rural county, which is mostly black, overwhelmingly voted for Obama last month.</p>
<p>The sponsor of the Obama holiday measure said it&rsquo;s meant to give people faith that difficult goals can be achieved.</p>
<p>But one Democratic commissioner who voted against the resolution said the cost of shutting down the county offices for a day can&rsquo;t be justified   &mdash;   even though he said &#8220;the recognition is certainly well-founded.&#8221;<br>
Looks like plate-buyers are not the only fools. More pandering to the dark side.</p>

<p>The Obama &#8220;personality cult&#8221; is kicking off into high gear, and he&rsquo;s not been inaugurated yet.</p>
<p>At least with Lenin, Stalin, Mao, Castro, Kim Il Sung and Pol Pot, their personality cults began after they were in power, and did something, no matter how evil it was.  I guess Obama&rsquo;s sheeple are trying to jump the gun on these other guys.</p>

		<p>I just heard a phone interview with an Alabama school district superintendent who has declared a holiday every Nov.2 (not sure of the exact date). This is done in honor of Barack Obama&rsquo;s being the first black president chosen. When asked if it will continue after he&rsquo;s out of office, the super assured Fox and Friends that it would. This is one of the poorest school districts in the state. The superintended? Black, of course. The rest of our presidents have been relegated to one &#8220;lumped together&#8221; holiday, but President-Elect Obama will have a day all to himself - at least in Alabama. Can other states be far behind in this hero worship?</p>

<p>Not really.  The proclamation only applied to states that had left the union.  Slaves in slave states that remained with the union were not emancipated until the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment.</p>

		<p>You know, these Lincoln-Obama comparisons are starting to creep me out.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the 200 year anniversary thing.  Everyone says that Obama is modeling his cabinet after Lincoln&rsquo;s &#8220;team of rivals&#8221; approach. Both are/were lawyers, both were relatively inexperienced politicians when elected, both are/were great orators, both were Illinois legislators but born elsewhere (ahem!), both are/were tall and skinny&hellip;(Dare I add that both have/had crazy wives?)</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s not take this comparison TOO far.  Let&rsquo;s hope that they BOTH don&rsquo;t preside over a long &amp; bloody civil war&hellip;</p>
