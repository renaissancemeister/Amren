</div>
<p>The great virtue of a book like <cite>The Debt,</cite> by black &#8220;activist&#8221; Randall Robinson, is that you don&rsquo;t have to read it to know what it says. You can be sure it will blame all black problems on whites, living or long dead, and demand unlimited reparations. In addition &mdash; despite Ivy League credentials the author brags of &mdash; the writing will be wretched: disorganized, prolix, shot through with garbled metaphors and big words wrongly used. Indeed, <cite>The Debt</cite> is a sadly representative sample of the thought processes of the black intellectual elite.</p>
<p>Robinson starts with the obvious: &#8220;African Americans lag the American mainstream in virtually every area of statistical measure.&#8221; The reason for this, of course, is &#8220;American slavery and the vicious climate that followed it.&#8221; And because of &#8220;the staggering breadth of America&rsquo;s crime against us .&nbsp;.&nbsp.; a fortune is owed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Robinson particularly emphasizes &#8220;the cost of [an] obstructed view of ourselves.&#8221; &#8220;We hate ourselves. [W]e don&rsquo;t know what has happened to us and no one will tell us. Thus we have concluded that the fault must be ours.&#8221; Ignorance of their glorious African ancestors holds back black children: &#8220;[A]chievement gaps cannot be fully closed until Americans &mdash; <em>all Americans</em> &mdash; are repaired in their views of Africa&rsquo;s role in history &hellip; blacks need to know the land of their forebears when its civilizations were verifiably equal to any in the world&#8221; &mdash; as if American children were not already overburdened with exaggerations and lies about black achievement.</p>
<p>Mr. Robinson&rsquo;s main argument for reparations is therefore psychological. As he explains, reparations would tell blacks: &#8220;You are owed. You were caused to endure terrible things. The fault is not yours. There is nothing wrong with you.&#8221; Reparations will &#8220;heal our psyches.&#8221; Not that Mr. Robinson would turn his back on tangible compensation. He admits, as if conceding nothing: &#8220;Oh, we often like its [America&rsquo;s] wealth, its abundance of commodities, its markets of endless stuff,&#8221; and insists that blacks be made whole economically. Although he coyly declines to name a sum, he asks whites to fork over the riches unjustly extracted from black labor, not only from slavery but sharecropping and capitalism itself, which &#8220;starts each child where its parents left off.&#8221; He claims that the mean net worth of college-educated whites exceeds that of college-educated blacks by $50,000, and puts the difference for blue-collar blacks and whites at $12,000. He also claims discrimination in mortgage lending costs each generation of blacks $93 billion in lost equity (<cite>The Debt</cite> has a few pages of &#8220;sources&#8221; but no footnotes, so there is no telling where these figures come from).</p>
<p>Because he insists that &#8220;achievement differences that correlate with race must never be tolerated,&#8221; it would cost trillions of dollars to close the gaps he complains about. On top of that, Robinson wants special (white) taxpayer-funded schools for black children and free college tuition for all poor blacks &#8220;for at least two generations.&#8221; Finally, America &#8220;must dramatically reconfigure its symbolized picture of itself, to itself. Its national parks, museums, monuments, statues, artworks must be recast in a way to include &hellip; African Americans.&#8221; The US must also cancel all debts to African countries and offer &#8220;significant monetary compensation&#8221; for having stolen &#8220;tens of millions&#8221; of their young men.</p>
<p>When will white liability end? Never. &#8220;Social rights, wrongs, obligations, and responsibilities flow eternal.&#8221; And what will happen if whites don&rsquo;t come across? &#8220;Those others, who fifty years from now will form the majority of America&rsquo;s citizens, will be inspired to punish them for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>As in many similar tirades, a striking feature of <cite>The Debt</cite> is Holocaust envy. Robinson is bursting with resentment that Germany compensated Jews for a mere twelve years of suffering, while blacks endured 246 years (sometimes he says 234 years) of slavery without a penny to show for it. And Jews got to keep their culture, while blacks &#8220;had never been allowed to glimpse the complex whole of the ancient self.&#8221; Lucky, lucky Jews. He apes Jewish grievances so far as to demand the return of &#8220;Africa&rsquo;s looted art treasures&#8221; &mdash; an irony, given the huge but so far unsuccessful effort by American cultural institutions to interest whites in African art.</p>
<p>The weaknesses of Mr. Robinson&rsquo;s case are obvious. Even if whites had caused black failure, they are already paying restitution in the form of racial preferences. For 35 years blacks have gotten jobs, scholarships and college admissions they did not deserve, but Mr. Robinson hurries past affirmative action in a few sentences and then pretends it does not exist. Nor does he acknowledge the enormous transfer of resources from whites to blacks through welfare and public education &mdash; nor the white wealth destroyed by black crime. A proper balancing of the books would have blacks owing whites.</p>
<p>In any case, blacks do poorly economically and academically because of their impulsiveness, low IQ and high illegitimacy rates, traits almost certainly due to genetic factors, not white misdeeds. At one point Mr. Robinson himself has a glimpse of this hard truth. Recounting a trip to Cuba &mdash; he greatly admires Fidel Castro &mdash; he notes: &#8220;White Cubans still appear very much to have the better of things. They dominate political power. They are generally better off economically.&#8221; Robinson explains the persistence of inequality despite 40 years of totalitarian efforts to end it as &#8220;a bequest of the Moors,&#8221; whatever that may mean. A simpler answer is that not even dictators can suppress nature.</p>
<p>Mr. Robinson&rsquo;s nervy demands should not goad us to the other extreme of absolving whites completely. Slavery was wrong, and while blacks may have fared better as slaves in America than as slaves in Africa, a wrong that accidentally helps its victim is still a wrong. Slave owners did owe something. Still, slavery was legal in its day, and compensation could only have been extracted by unjust, ex post facto laws. Moreover, there was slavery in Africa long before it came to America, and virtually every black who crossed the Atlantic was captured and sold to whites by fellow blacks. Why not send their descendants a bill, too? However unjust slavery may have been, it ended a century and a half ago and has no current significance. It is time to bury the past.</p>
<p>It is worth emphasizing the full awfulness of Mr. Robinson&rsquo;s writing. On poverty: &#8220;We are virtually numb now to our global position of economic bottomness. In the refuge of our subculture, we have disguised enfeebled self-images in the escapist behaviors of people who would angrily deny the massive loss of self-confidence.&#8221; On politics: &#8220;The intramural tango of bitsy Democratic palliatives and itsy-bitsy Republican palliatives does little more than divert attention and siphon energy as a recondite rot steals up inexorably from the underside, narrowing our practical freedoms and troubling our tenuous contentment. A tangle of nameless, nebulous thoughts clamor for description, while I struggle even to hear myself think in the face of the public career types with their heads vised in a thoroughly disproved orthodoxy, their voices claiming variety but in fact chiming in a tedium of pointless concern, their eyes all blinkered, and their feet long set upon the easy path.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are a few excellent black writers, but jumbles like this are all too typical of black intellectuals. What sort of disordered mind produces them? More urgently, how can whites &mdash; accustomed to language that communicates rather than wears down &mdash; deal with such minds? At the very least, whites must recognize that they face something fundamentally alien.<br>

		<p>MOST black couldn&rsquo;t even spell the word, and few if any know what it means, but as usual when blacks pick up the smell of Something for Nothing they can&rsquo;t HEP themselves, they start to salivate. My guess is if this were ever approved which is not totally impossible the Auto Makers would have to put their workers on overtime just to keep up with the orders for new Escalades.</p>

		<p>I have said it many times here and so I will repeat it again&hellip;.</p>
<p>I will gladly agree to their claims for reparations (for the decendents of slaves) the same day they agree to reparations to (the decendents of) former slave owners, for their loss of property&hellip;.a much stronger legal claim actually.</p>
<p>On that same day, I require them to agree to pay the claims for reparations for casualty and loss of property visited on the eleven former Confederate states and their citizens&hellip;.payable to their living decendents. These claims include the hostilities by Federal and non-Confederate state military forces during the Civil War, the Federal Occupation of the South, the so-called Reconstruction Era, and discrimination/prejudice against Southern citizens in every decade since.</p>
<p>In the end, when reparations are actually paid, the people who will actually pay the bill will be those in non-Confederate states, east of the Rocky Mountains. The South will be the wealthiest part of the nation.</p>

		<p>People like Mr. Robinson have a personally vested interest in reparations.  The plans they advance would send the reparations to &#8220;academics&#8221; and &#8220;intellectuals&#8221; like himself, so they can spend the money for &#8220;nation building&#8221; (i.e spreading it between themselves.)  They explicitly do not want the money to go to every American black, because they think that the legacy of slavery (more like the realities of impulsiveness and IQ) is that if blacks get a reparations check for tens of thousands of dollars, white racism will make them spend it on bling.</p>

		<p><i>The US must also cancel all debts to African countries and offer &ldquo;significant monetary compensation&rdquo; for having stolen &ldquo;tens of millions&rdquo; of their young men.</i></p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t we just give them back?  Please?</p>
<p>Amren&rsquo;s concern over reparations always strikes me as a bit odd.  It almost seems to legitimize the issue.  Which brings me to my point: there is absolutely no legitimate argument to be made for reparations.</p>
<p>The debt, if it exists, has been paid!  The transfer of wealth from white pockets to black via tax and welfare to date exceeds common figures from the reparations goons.</p>
<p>The debt does not exist!  Blacks in America (overwhelming majority are the descendants of slaves) are many times wealthier (think 50ish) than their racial kin in sub-Saharan Africa.  Ergo, the &#8220;debt&#8221; in question, to the extent it exists, is owed to whites by blacks (to be added to the tab from the preceding paragraph).</p>
<p>Collective judgment and punishment are illiberal; no one in the American political establishment is willing to enunciate the logic behind reparations: today&rsquo;s children, identified and labeled by skin color, are guilty and must pay for the crimes of people of the same color who have been dead for centuries.  Are whites who immigrated from Poland in the 20th century really guilty for slavery and segregation?</p>
<p>(Mightn&rsquo;t reparations legislation, if it makes it through the courts, set a precedent Amreners could appreciate more than liberals*?)</p>
<p>Like any race-hustling for money for blacks from whites, this reparations nonsense depends on the ipso facto blame for &#8220;black failure&#8221; liberals* place on whites, and is a moral duty for every man of character (of any color) to denounce it as unjust.  (I suppose an exception can be made for the &#8220;worse is better&#8221; crowd, since robbing white pockets to pay blacks in such a vulgar and explicit way could only serve to backfire against liberals* in the long run).</p>
<p>It gets old pointing out these simple facts but I&rsquo;ll persist since the topic keeps coming up at Amren and (in my experience) the commentariat still doesn&rsquo;t repeat the points above frequently enough for my tastes.</p>
<p>*(Conservatives, Liberals, Democrats, Republicans, etc.)</p>

		<p>Were there ever any black African tribes as advanced as those of the European world? Teaching black children they were, would simply be another lie. Black children are typically fed lies daily from birth. It reminds me of an old lady in Selma Alabama. Everyday, she and her husband set out on there front porch as the black school children passed by on their way home from school. One young boy would always stop by and chat with them. They often gave him a little treat, since he was so kind to stop by and visit. One day the lady told him how poor she was growing up. He told her that wasn&rsquo;t true. He said all white people have always been rich according to his mother. </p>
<p>Yes, slave ownership was wrong. Despite my family being from the south for many generations none never owned a slave. One Great Great grandfather fought briefly for the confederates before being injured and sent home. I highly condemn those who imported the blacks to this country. Could you imagine how much easier our plight would be simply fighting against all the illegals. Imagine no inner city problems. Imagine cities like Selma Alabama and New Orleans still livable.</p>
<p>We have poured billions down the waste whole of Africa, we not benefit. We pour millions daily into the waste wholes of the inner cities. What benefits have we seen? If we paid all blacks a few thousand each, would we see a turn around in behavior and education? If I could get that guaranteed in writing, I think I might vote for it.</p>

		<p>When are we going to put a stop to this never ending tripe? As the article states in a few short years Whites will be the minority in their own country and the Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, etc will be at liberty to punish them even further. Are we going to defend our progeny NOW and take back what is rightfully theirs or do we just sit back and do nothing and let them suffer the rest of their lives? If we don&rsquo;t do anything now, then we will deserve damnation and our graves spat on by our own children and grandchildren. </p>

		<p>European-Caucasians built the first Civilization that refuse Slavery. White Americans even kill each other to stop that. And we only have Black slaves from XV to XIX centurys. Caucasians from North-Africa and Midle East, practice Black slavery since 1000 years. In certain places, like Egypt or Yemen, for more than 2000. Saudi-Arabia only forbid this in 1970. Mauritania in 1980!&hellip; But, Europeans also invented the sentiment of Guilt. I would like to see Blacks ask for reparations to Iran, Algeria,Libia,&hellip;</p>

		<p>Hell we owe them nothing&hellip;I figure they owe me big time for having taken my hard earned tax dollars to support their kids, not only on welfare but for all the freebies the government hands out to these creatures.  They play, we pay.  No one pays my bills or supports my kids, only blacks, illegals, browns, other hispanics, indians, asians, get help, while we white people carry all the burden. Let them go to work and PAY US BACK!! I certainly didn&rsquo;t have any slaves, but WE ARE SLAVES paying day in and day out for THEM!! I for one, am sick of it!!</p>

		<p>To compare the Holocaust with any supposed wrongs committed against blacks, is incomprehensible and disgusting.  Anybody with an ounce of sense knows that slave owners would not have abused their property.  By no means condoning the institution of slavery, I find it very hard to believe that a plantation owner would pay thousands of dollars for a slave or slaves and then whip them until they were bloody and unable to work.  </p>
<p>The Jews and Gypies and Poles were slaughtered - numbering close to 12 million when it was all over.  </p>
<p>It makes me sick to my stomach when blacks compare their &#8220;struggle&#8221; for justice to what happen in Germany and Poland.  </p>

		<p>If there&rsquo;s one thing good about the present financial downturn  (temporary or permanent?), there&rsquo;s going to be no &#8220;bailout&#8221; to pay blacks for past white shortcomings; even tax and spend pandering white liberals know we can&rsquo;t afford it, and what&rsquo;s more are free to say so. Well, it&rsquo;s an ill wind that blows no good.</p>
<p>Maybe the segregation of races will come again through this issue. Kind of like the separation of India and Pakistan: those that wanted to practice Islam went to one country, and those wanting to practice Hinduism went to the other country. It was voluntary, and to a large degree it was successful. This was organized by the British, but in our day people would just vote with their feet.</p>
<p>Demographics with the accompanying political leanings are never the same, even in the most multicultural world, so people drift to their own, not only to their race, but to laws, financial arrangements and policies that effect them in an important way.</p>
<p>Whites that want to pay reparations and other forms of political blackmail could stay in one area; that, in practice, would be few, whatever front was put up. Blacks and others would stay away from other areas because of few gratuities.</p>
<p>Of course the areas dominated by Blacks and Latinos would turn into Africa and Mexico. But would they migrate to White lands without Welfare? If they did anyway, would whites flee somewhere else. That, of course, could get ridiculous. It would be difficult to maintain a haze of self-delusion. We&rsquo;d follow the example of the Chinese dominated areas of America and turn a cold shoulder to those demanding welfare.</p>
<p>Turning down payment to other races is the key to regaining our independence. The comfortable Whites like Multiculturism as long as they don&rsquo;t have to pay. When the cost of living with Blacks is high enough, they&rsquo;ll become as restless as Daniel Boone to &#8216;move on&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>Good post there tuga&hellip;.right on the money.  But then, I want blacks to apoligize to me for picking my pocket, via, my tax money, to pay for their illegit kids and all the freebies they get with my hard earned money.  I WANT ALL MY MONEY BACK!! After all, I had nothing to do with slavery but I am a slave to blacks, hispanics, white trash, illegals, ect, because my money supports them all.  They owe ME!</p>

Excellent article, Mr. Levin. I have never thought there was any sort of case for reparations, but this article states the anti-reparations argument as forcefully as any I&rsquo;ve read. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also like to extend my sympathies to Mr. Levin for the pain he must have endured in reading this Randall person&rsquo;s ridiculous and racist manifesto. The book is obviously noxious in content; Levin&rsquo;s quotes of Randall&rsquo;s wretchedly awful writing indicate that it&rsquo;s noxious in form, too. It is nothing short of painful to read such &#8220;sentences&#8221; as this 62-word monstrosity: </p>
<p><br>
&#8220;A tangle of nameless, nebulous thoughts clamor for description, while I struggle even to hear myself think in the face of the public career types with their heads vised in a thoroughly disproved orthodoxy, their voices claiming variety but in fact chiming in a tedium of pointless concern, their eyes all blinkered, and their feet long set upon the easy path.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
Mr. Levin suffered through hundreds of pages of such claptrap so that we don&rsquo;t have to   &mdash;   and for that we owe him thanks. </p>

		<p>The reparations argument just doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.  Thier argument is that slavery made the U. S. better, but descendents of slaves LIVE IN THE U. S..  They are already living in the place that they claim was made better by slavery.  So basically, the fact that they live here, is the reparations.</p>
<p>Also, why are reparations a one-way street?  If a higher percentage of blacks than whites are on welfare, then welfare would basically be foreward payments of reparations.  What about the fact that blacks kill whites 15 times more often than the other way around, rape whites 40 (at least) times more often than the other way around, and mug whites 200 times more often than the other way around (per capita)?  What about the fact that blacks turn our neighborhoods into no-go zones?</p>
<p>Does anybody actually think that when all those, and others, are added up, that whites will be the ones owing blacks money, rather than the other way around?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll have to say that black culture is very interesting. I cannot find anything of significant value it has produced to date. Of course to them they would argue that hip hop &amp; rap music are if some merit. Possibly they would also include the driveby as being noteworthy. I have however noticed that professional blacks quickly move far away from their brothas and sistas in the ghetto. No qualms about taking their money, they just don&rsquo;t want to be dirtied by the association with them. Truely a remarkable people. White guilt is for those truely of a weak mind and historically &amp; culturally ignorant of white vs black culture.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s one simple thing blacks don&rsquo;t take into account when they irritatingly blame whites for everything.  India was colonized for 200 years by the british (quite brutally), now india has a booming economy and indians are successful in most countries-WITHOUT RECEIVING a cent in compensation from Britain.  China was colonized by the Europeans (in the 1800&rsquo;s) and then by the Japanese (in the 30&rsquo;s and 40&rsquo;s): Despite getting NO money in compensation, China AND the Chinese are doing very well.  Ditto for Vietnam, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, etc. (my hands are getting tired).  Perhaps Blacks would be well advised to keep these ideas in mind the next time they whine about slavery and demand reparations.</p>

<p>When it suits them the blacks sure love this &#8220;people of color&#8221; ideology  &mdash;  that all non white races are inherently pure and noble and will one day rise up against the hated white oppressors&hellip; </p>
<p>However, until that day of ultimate victory arrives, they seem to have no problem robbing and shooting Middle Eastern store clerks, feuding with &#8220;latin&#8221; gang-bangers, attacking Asians etc., but yet they think for some reason, that all will be forgotten, and that all other races share the same pathological hatred for whites as they do. </p>

		<p>To compare the Holocaust with any supposed wrongs committed against blacks, is incomprehensible and disgusting. Anybody with an ounce of sense knows that slave owners would not have abused their property. By no means condoning the institution of slavery, I find it very hard to believe that a plantation owner would pay thousands of dollars for a slave or slaves and then whip them until they were bloody and unable to work. </p>
<p>The Jews and Gypies and Poles were slaughtered - numbering close to 12 million when it was all over. </p>
<p>It makes me sick to my stomach when blacks compare their &ldquo;struggle&rdquo; for justice to what happen in Germany and Poland. </p>
<p>Absolutely correct. There are so many blacks working in the contracting world now because the companies are FORCED to hire them to remain eligible for government contracts. Companies that bring them aboard are stuck with them because they dare not fire them. Applications/resumes do not ask/cannot ask race questions so recruiters have to keep hiring until they get a white that can and will do the job. While sitting in Al Asad air base in Iraq outside the PX, I was watching KBR people come in enmasse and of a hundred (I counted) 3 (three) were white. I have met only a few that seemed to be capable people and they were looking for other companies to come to work for.</p>

		<p>Gayle, you said:  &gt;&gt;&gt;Anybody with an ounce of sense knows that slave owners would not have abused their property
 Right up until last night I would have agreed with you 100%, as I have only ever seen one image of a whipped and scarred black slave &amp; I assumed mistreatment was not commonplace, but it seems that this is not the case and its as well that we are informed with some facts about the situation. It appears that cruel punishments of slaves may have been more commonplace than I (or you)thought. Last night I took an ancient copy of Dicken&rsquo;s American Notes of the shelf in my Aunt&rsquo;s house.(I&rsquo;m in Ireland presently. Flipping through I found a section on slavery in Chapter XVI where Dickens lists about 50 advertisments in US papers that appalled him; the advertisements concern runaway slaves and the identifying descriptions include; &#8216;Pompey,branded on left jaw&rsquo;,&rsquo;Henry,much scarred with a whip&rsquo; &#8216;girl branded on cheek and forehead&rsquo;,&rsquo;boy- one ear cropped&rsquo; the list goes on in this vein. Of course we don&rsquo;t know why they were punished in this fashion, they may well have been guilty of some heinous crime, tho&rsquo; there are quite a few &#8216;girls&rsquo; included which makes me doubt they were all punishments for true crimes. Anyway, just thought I&rsquo;d inform you and others that there are records of what to the modern mind would certainly be appalling mistreatment. <br>
This in no way justifies today&rsquo;s blacks demanding reparations of course and lets not forget that there were plenty of white folks, esp. Irish in indentured slavery. Also,records exist revealing that freed Blacks were slave owners too.  <br>
Arc. </p>

		<p>&#8220;On that same day, I require them to agree to pay the claims for reparations for casualty and loss of property visited on the eleven former Confederate states and their citizens&hellip;.payable to their living decendents. These claims include the hostilities by Federal and non-Confederate state military forces during the Civil War, the Federal Occupation of the South, the so-called Reconstruction Era, and discrimination/prejudice against Southern citizens in every decade since.</p>
<p>In the end, when reparations are actually paid, the people who will actually pay the bill will be those in non-Confederate states, east of the Rocky Mountains. The South will be the wealthiest part of the nation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Posted by Memphomaniac at 6:14 PM on December 5 </p>
<p>&gt; Even though I sympathize in many ways with the South and many longtime posters will have read my mail where I &#8220;admit&#8221; to being a distant cousin to Robert E. Lee, I have to remind you that it was the Southerners who provoked hostilities and began the war by firing on a certain federal fort in Charleston Harbor.  Let&rsquo;s not pile absurdity on with absurdity.</p>

		<p>The guilt thing will not go away. It is not fixable . Rationality is not applicable .<br>
Seperation is the only answer. </p>
<p>It would be very positive and constructive to finally cast off the whiney and disfunctional albatross.</p>

		<p>The whole issue of reparations is a good illustration<br>
of just how wide the gap really is between the thinking<br>
of your typical black person, most of whom agrees with the<br>
idea of reparationsm, and whites who overwhelmingly oppose<br>
the issue. Just one more reason for racial separation.</p>

		<p>More urgently, how can whites &mdash; accustomed to language that communicates rather than wears down &mdash; deal with such minds? At the very least, whites must recognize that they face something fundamentally alien.<br>

		<p>African slaves in America lived better than their African ancestors in Africa do today.  If anyone should feel guilt and shame it is the blacks who continue to live parasitically off of we whites in our white nation the likes of which is not to be found anywhere in Africa&hellip;</p>
