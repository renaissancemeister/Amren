<h1>Suspect in Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts Robberies Barks Like a Dog at Judge</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rafael A. Olmeda, Robert Nolin and Sofia Santana, South Florida Sun-Sentinel, December 5, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The man accused of being the shotgun-wielding robber in a two-county string of Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts robberies repeatedly barked like a dog at a county judge this afternoon during a court hearing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would suggest you take this more seriously,&#8221; Judge John Hurley told James Herard, 19, who replied &#8220;ruff&#8221; several times. Herard barked again after Hurley explained his rights as a criminal defendant. &#8220;I&rsquo;m going to consider your bark as an acknowledgment of what I just told you,&#8221; the judge said.</p>

			<p>Part of the reason is that it has become de facto acceptable in the black community to affix the moniker &#8220;dog&#8221; or &#8220;dawg&#8221; to one&rsquo;s self.  A few of them evidently take it too seriously.  If you, on the other hand, would equivocate one of them with animals, you would never hear the end of it.</p>

			<p>Ya know, in a sane society, this &#8220;dog&#8221; would simply be taken outside and shot. But instead, in our &#8220;just&#8221; society, the taxpayers will be charged thousands of dollars to feed, house and supply a lawyer for this animal. And God only knows how many Hollywood liberals will come rushing to his defence. Just watching the video of him [original article] made me sick. And what&rsquo;s so frightening is that there are THOUSANDS more of them just like him or worse out on the streets right now.</p>

			<p>A rather appropriate response considering the nature of the defendant, wouldn&rsquo;t you say?</p>

			<p>Well that&rsquo;s just a fitting way to dislay your contempt for the law of the land. Probably thinks he will be pardoned by Obama.</p>

			<p>Ordinarily robbery, even a string of robberies would not lead me to think of capital punishment. However this defendant insists on acting like a dog, well this society disposes of incorrigable stray dogs by putting them down, hopefully before they kill someone. Give him the same treatment.</p>

<p>One fine day in the far, far future   &mdash;   when people who think like us have finally retaken control of the universities and fired all the multiculti indoctrinators and anti-white racists   &mdash;   some bright white Doctoral candidate will do his/her thesis on &#8220;Nothin&rsquo; But the Dawg in Me, Yo: The Bizarre Phenomenon of African-American Self-Identification with Canines, from &#8216;Atomic Dog&rsquo; to Snoop Doggy Dogg.&#8221; </p>

<p>Wimpy judges like this are one of many reasons crime is out of control in this brave, new, &#8220;politically correct&#8221; society of ours.</p>

			<p>Typical black criminal behavior, and if I was that judge, I would have said, &#8220;you are one sick dog, time for you to be put down&#8221; see if that would have stopped the barking, and if not, add 10 more years for contempt of court. </p>

			<p>Now will someone please explain to me why we in the civilized segment of society must be forced to live with, work with and our children forced to go to school with these sub-humans. <br>
And another thing, why was this judge addressing him as<br>
 &#8221; Sir&#8221;; as if to suggest humanity? <br>
He should have sent him to a kennel preferably sharing a cage with a very hungry Bull Mastiff. <br>
This vicious bastard gives reaffirms the word Untermensch. </p>

<p>I am not quite sure where you are coming from? Are you saying that Whites commit crmes? Of course they do, but not at the same rate as Blacks.</p>

<p>Yeah, and he&rsquo;s the same race as the guys who commit over half of the murders in this country.</p>

			<p>Another classic case of too much sugar. A government grant to an Ivy League University is in order to study the consequences of whether or not donuts made this politically correct man regress to his sub human state. </p>
<p>Maybe he WAS actually a dog in a previous life on a plantation in the South? Reparations are in order; and of course, its Whitey&rsquo;s fault! </p>
<p>Maybe he had an affectation for morbidly obese policemen who are known to frequent donut shops and &#8220;to walk like Egyptians&#8221;? If so, he needs in depth psychological analysis and hypnotic regression therapy treatment; also at taxpayer&rsquo;s expense.   </p>
<p>Maybe if he were robbing Popeye&rsquo;s Chicken it would have been more believable. I didn&rsquo;t think that our dark skin counterparts were as addicted to donuts as they are to Popeye&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Maybe he is dyslexic and can neither speak nor find his way to the proper victim. Could this be Whitey&rsquo;s fault also? Perhaps he needs rehabilitation treatment; also at taxpayers expense.  </p>
<p>The Judge must have told him that anything that he said could have been used against him? Does Miranda apply to dogs? What if dogs could speak? Would Miranda then apply to them?    </p>
<p>Before this is over there will be countless individuals coming forward with the argument that any black man who barks can not possibly form the criminal intent necessary to be convicted of a criminal act. He will walk! </p>

			<p>According to the DOJ, 4/5 of all US black babies are now born out of wedlock and live with single mothers. 85% of all violent crime in the US is done by black males between 13 and 29  &mdash;  3% of the US population. This is simply cultural suicide. But it&rsquo;s &ldquo;racist&rdquo; to even mention it.</p>
<p>Q. When will Foxman, Dees, Potok and the white feminazis indict the DOJ for racism and hate crimes for reporting the facts of racial crime? </p>
<p>A. January 21, 2008 the first day of the obama adminstration.</p>

			<p>He will never contribute ANYTHING to society. And there are legions of black males just like him. Blacks are a completely dysfunctional pathological failed race.</p>
