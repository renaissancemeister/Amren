			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bild.com (Berlin), December 12, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The jungles of Papua New Guinea are a different world &mdash; the land of headhunters and cannibals.</p>
<p>Brave Italian photographer Iago Corazza travelled the country, the island at the end of the world, and took photos of its fascinating inhabitants, who still live a Stone Age existence.</p>
<p>&#8220;You find people here who can describe the taste of human flesh,&#8221; the photographer said of his travels.</p>
<p>Anthropologist Olga Ammann describes it more succinctly in the book. She quotes people who have eaten other humans: &#8220;The meat of white people smells too strongly and is too salty.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Japanese are meant to taste the best, according to her study &mdash; the only thing that beats it is the meat of their own women.</p>
<p>But is cannibalism just a myth, or does it still exist on the island? It has been banned there for over 50 years &mdash; but it is reported that some tribes still eat the flesh of people who have died.</p>
<p>Evidence of this is the current prevalence of the Kuru illness in tribe members, which is associated with cannibalism.<br>

		<p>In the 1980s I was taking sailing lessons in Sausilito, CA from a rated sailing captain who had picked up and delivered big sail boats to New Guinea and back.  He said that everyone knew that you must not wander too far into the bush, especially women and children.  He spoke with the sort of conviction - and horror of one who had seen it, I knew him well enough to know that he was no liar.</p>

		<p>Two years ago we had a little journalistic scandal involving a 6 year old Papua New Guinean boy &#8216;Wawa&rsquo;. Who was allegidly breed to be eaten in some weird tribal ritual.</p>
<p>All these expects and political Papua New Guineans came out and said that cannibalism no longer happens in the islands.</p>
<p>The scandal was over two rival news outlets fighting over the story, moreso than being concerned for the boy. After all the fallout I can&rsquo;t remember what the outcome was for Wawa<br>
Maybe served his purpose, inbetween the entree and dessert.</p>

		<p>      This is Anthropology at it&rsquo;s best: the beating heart of<br>
applied science providing a menu of knowledge we need. As readers know, I have a great affection for the people of that<br>
magnificient island continent. Under their beetle brows and IQ&rsquo;s<br>
of 60, they yearn to be free. They yearn to come to America and<br>
taste our freedom and to prove themselves worth their salt. We<br>
brought the Hmong here and that has certainly worked out well. Why not the Papuans as well? Think of the dances, cuisine, handi-<br>
crafts they could bring us. The real question is how we have got-<br>
ten along without them all this time! Thank you Jean Raspail for<br>
that last line.</p>

		<p>Reading this article it is abundantly clear that the citizens of Papua New Guinea need to be airlifted to America for the opportunity of a better life!  After all, the people there are soooo hungry they are forced against their wills to commit the unspeakable.</p>
<p>To partially fulfill the State Department mandate of importing 90,000 non-Western people a year to our shores, we could start with about 30,000 Papua people in 2009!  Be sure to put them as one large group in a predominantly White area, because boring Whites must NEVER be allowed to live in peace by themselves.  Whites need diversity to truly enjoy life!</p>

		<p>&ldquo;The meat of white people smells too strongly and is too salty&hellip;the best&hellip;is the meat of their own women.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that if their women had adequate educational and economic opportunities, they would taste the same as white people.</p>

<p>Well, I did some searching on the census website, and I noticed that Pittsburgh seems to be one of the whitest large US cities remaining, so I&rsquo;d suggest sending them there.  What&rsquo;s that?  The State Department is already sending the Bhutanese there?  Darn.</p>
<p>How about Rutland, VT?  They&rsquo;d love it there.  Or maybe Great Falls, Montana?  I also hear that Bangor, Maine, is suffering from a severe excess of white people, too.  Let&rsquo;s get thinking here!</p>

		<p>This story is certainly a fabrication.  New Guineans are no more backward than Minnesotans or Venetians or Germans or Lillipudlians.  Had it not been for white racism, perhaps a New Guinean would have invented trigonometry, the printing press, the airplane, the crock pot or the nuclear bomb.  The IQs of the all the people of all the world are the same- Haiti, Jamaica, Zimbabwe, Chad, the USA, Japan, Canada, Australia and  New Guinea.  No, this alleged cannibalism is a racist attack on the people of New Guinea, who are among the most gentle and civilized in all the world.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s an eye-opener. CANNIBALISM is still far from uncommon in Africa also! We read of the pygmie tribes&hellip; Appealing to the U.N. for protection. Seems rebel soldiers were capturing and cooking them. We read in the newspapers the occasional article about cannibalism, like rape, being used by warring tribal factions to terrorize and intimidate other people. Hell, even some Afro-Americans, that sicko in Texas, for example&hellip; killed his girlfriend and cooked parts of her on his barbecue grill. But, so sorry. I forgot. We&rsquo;re not supposed to mention the disgusting side of the third-worlders. That just would not be politically correct, I am told.</p>

		<p>Does this mean that the taste of human flesh is not a &#8220;social construct&#8221;?</p>
<p>These cannibals were doubtless eating Japanese soldiers during World War Two; the fighting in New Guinea was pretty gruesome.  Japanese today each much less red meat than Western whites, and during the war, they ate far less than that; this would help explain the difference in taste (as well as smell).</p>
<p>One New Guinea word for human meat translates literally as &#8220;long pig&#8221;.  The taste is said to closely resemble pork.</p>
<p>The Dyaks of Borneo did much the same thing to their Japanese occupiers during the war, and when the government of Indonesia tried confiscating Dyak land about a decade ago, for resettlement of Madurese, the Dyaks got those old habits &#8220;cooking&#8221; again.</p>
<p>On my last flight home from Australia, I flew over New Guinea: Sydney-to-Tokyo-Los Angeles.  I had hoped to see it from the air, but it was clouded over.  That&rsquo;s about as close as I wanted to get.  Horror stories about Port Moresby - the only relatively &#8220;civilized&#8221; place in PNG - were common in Australia.  </p>

		<p>Jeffrey Dahmer would agree.  He preferred Asian meat to White meat.  Perhaps this is the reason that White people were able to get out of Africa and build civilizations.  Cannibals didn&rsquo;t like the way they tasted.  </p>
<p>Blacks finally have a new excuse for failure, now that with Obama&rsquo;s election the race card has evaporated  &mdash;  they were too busy running away from cannibals to invent a wheel, a written language, or a benevolent God.  They taste just too good.</p>

<p>I have a dear friend from Scotland who told me when he first moved to the US he rented a small apartment in New York where the &#8216;wonderful smell of BBQ&rsquo; continually permeated the air.</p>
<p>He said he couldn&rsquo;t wait to go out and find this BBQ restaurant as the smell was heavenly and the food cooking there seemed to be unlike anything he&rsquo;d ever smelled in Scotland or England.</p>
<p>To his horror, he discovered that the wonderful smell was coming from a nearby crematory that was burning bodies.</p>

		<p>         Jared Diamond is a true Christ figure. When he was<br>
down there, a Papuan (I forget his name, but let&rsquo;s call him<br>
Ooga Booga), asked &#8220;Why do your people have more cargo than we<br>
do&#8221;? Jared put his metaphorical arm around Ooga, and said, &#8220;It&rsquo;s<br>
because your people were all by yourselves&#8221;. Of course. And now<br>
that they&rsquo;re not all by themselves, they can have our cargo.<br>
As the chant says, Kick it in Joe. Jared makes things so simple.<br>
That&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s a liberal Christ figure. And of course, he wants<br>
to give things to Non-Whites, our things. That&rsquo;s reparations for<br>
leaving them all alone.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a certain irony to this story, since it has been reported that Japanese soldiers (at the behest of their commanders) ate White POWs on the island of New Guinea during World War II.

		<p>I once read, many years ago, a very fascinating book written  (anonymously) by a French naval physician who had served in the Caribbean and the South Pacific, in the late 1800&rsquo;s.  [I see it is now selling as a collector&rsquo;s item on alibris.com ]  This extremely frank and honest  book of his would drive any modern Marxist nuts! It makes no pretense of being egalitarian, regarding all cultures as equal, and is undoubtedly banned in France today. He told, without the restriction of modern inhibitions,  the side of things that was not politically correct   &mdash;    even then.  I recall that he mentioned that the Australian aborigines (and Papuans and others) preferred the flesh of Chinamen to Caucasians because it was considered more tender   &mdash;    this apparently due to the lack of salt in their diet, and perhaps also because of  the toughening effect of liquor.  Whites were tougher and hence less tasty.  He noted that Chinese coolies working in the mines of Austrialia (and also in the nickel mines of  New Caledonia, a French  island) were  known to occasionally  &#8220;disappear&#8221;. The Chinese were in terror of the natives.  <i> [Untrodden Fields of Anthropology,  by Doctor Jacobus X. : €156,70,  $200.00US;  Librarie De Medecine, Folklore, et Anthropologie, Paris, France,  1898.] </i></p>

		<p>If a dark skinned group likes to eat people, then, it is racist to say that eating people is wrong.</p>
<p><br>
If it looks bad to the general population that some dark skinned people have the nasty habit of eating other people, then, it is important that an instance of white people eating other people must be found and exagerated, if not totally fabricated .</p>

		<p>George Bush I narrowly escaped a similar fate.</p>
<p>During World War Two, he served as a navy pilot.  Flying a Grumman Avenger bomber off the carrier San Jacinto, he was shot down in an air raid on Chichi Jima island.  He was able to fly the damaged airplane some distance from the island before ditching it in the water.</p>
<p>Fortunate for him that he did; the Japanese army commander on Chich Jima was in the habit of having downed US airmen executed and then fed to himself and the officers under him.</p>
<p>At the end of the war, some of the Japanese enlisted men testified against their former commander for the war crimes investigators, with the predictable result that this commander was taken back to Chichi Jima and hanged in civilian clothes (shooting a professional soldier in uniform is supposed to be a less insulting form of execution.)</p>
<p>Some of the cannibalism practiced in New Guinea by Japanese soldiers was simply &#8220;survival cannibalism&#8221;, like the case of the Uruguyan rugby players who survived the famous plane crash in the Andes.  They were more apt to eat each other, in fact.  An Australian unit in New Guinea reported capturing an &#8220;absolutely terrified&#8221; Japanese who was told to report to the cookhouse without his miss kit, and who then wisely deserted.</p>
<p>The Japanese army frequently got itself into positions where it could not be adequately supplied.</p>
