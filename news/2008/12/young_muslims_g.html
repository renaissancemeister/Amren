<h1><a href="http://www.cphpost.dk/get/110149.html">Young Muslims Go Amok at Mall</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Copenhagen Post, December 9, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Police used pepper spray Monday night to dispel up to 300 Muslim young people who caused disturbances outside Fisketorvet mall in downtown Copenhagen.</p>
<p>The youths had gathered at the shopping centre in connection with the celebration of the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Adha.</p>
<p>But several of those present got out of hand, according to police. Bicycles were thrown onto the nearby S-train tracks, shoppers at the mall were harassed and rocks were thrown at police who arrived on the scene.</p>
<p>Officers managed to split the group in two and drive them away from the mall. Five youths were eventually arrested as a result of the fracas.<br>

		<p>So, they say Muslim &#8220;yoots&#8221; were celebrating Eid, but it got &#8220;out of hand&#8221; with the bike throwing and the rock throwing and the harassment?  My take on it is that the latter happened BECAUSE of the former, especially because the former was held in a white country, and these &#8220;yoots&#8221; could display their racial jealousy.</p>

		<p>Years ago, when I was in the military, we were sent to face down some rioters.  We were told that the ordinary rules of guarding a post were in effect.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Halt.  Halt.  Do not move or I will shoot.&#8221;  </p>
<p>The mob knew we were serious, maybe because so many of us were smiling.  They limited themselves to yelling, to my dismay.  I was reminded of a WW2 photo I saw of a single German soldier with a 9mm submachine gun facing a large crowd of Italian civilians.  The soldier stood casually, weight on one foot, weapon dangling from a strap over his shoulder.  He made no fierce gesture, no finger on trigger, but  the Italians knew he meant business.  Mobs are easy to stop, if anyone cares to.<br>
     If I, as a citizen, have a right to use deadly force to defend myself from &#8220;great bodily harm&#8221;, why are cops expected to hold their fire when attacked by a rock throwing mob?<br>
     And lastly, I&rsquo;ve never been to Denmark, but I kind of doubt that the streets are unpaved.  Where do these Moslems get the rocks?  Surely they don&rsquo;t just find them laying around on the sidewalks?  I suspect that they arm themselves before they head out for an evenings sport.</p>

		<p>Small price to pay for all enrichment these joys of diversity are bringing to Denmark. </p>
<p>Be careful with the pepper spray. Injuring (or worse)a minority can cause spontaneous rioting as Greece just learned. </p>

		<p>Danes have been in Denmark since prehistoric times.  They evolved there.  It is their country.  No entity has a right to impose alien people or alien cultures upon the Danes.  </p>
<p>The people of Denmark, and Danish society, are already as close to perfect as any rational person could wish.  They stand to gain nothing, culturally or genetically, from the introduction of foreigners into their society.  Instead, there is much that they stand to lose.</p>
<p>I doubt that Danish mothers will be able, for much longer, to leave their babies in strollers outside shops (to be cared for by the community at large) as they do now.  What a pity that these beautiful, angelic people will soon cease to exist.</p>

		<p>I was surprised at the headline. The fact that they were so forthright in identifying the the perpetrators as muslims says a lot. The Danes don&rsquo;t coddle muslims as much as other european peoples do.</p>

<p>In the scandinavion countries, cobblestones are very popular, because they look very nice.<br>
Unfortunately, they also make a good &#8220;armory&#8221; for rioters&hellip;.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;The Danes don&rsquo;t coddle muslims as much as other european peoples do.&#8221;<br>
The danish peoples party, a party known as &#8220;rightwing extremists&#8221; by various leftists, has had a lot of influence over danish politics the last couple of years, and they have a much more realistic view of the problems with immigration, and have also helped influence the danish media, so problems are being talked about openly.</p>

		<p>I was going to make the comment posted at 5.42. Had this happened in England the Guardian headline would have read &#8221; Police brutality<br>
cancels youths celebrations&#8221;. It seems there is hope for Denmark.</p>

<p>Yes, I think you&rsquo;re spot on about having a supply of rocks for sport.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re not stoning a woman to death for getting raped, because she allowed herself to be alone with a man, then they&rsquo;re stoning someone to death for converting to another religion, or refusing to pray five times per day or a woman wearing lipstick, or for being a slut for showing some part of her body that the burka ordinarily hides, or some such other infraction that would call for far less concern by anybody else.</p>
<p>Being a radical Muslim, which most of them are, means keeping a good supply of stones in case they&rsquo;re called upon to do the will of Allah.</p>
<p>The only good thing about it all is that these are the people the warped secular progressives all over the world are busting their butts to bring in, too dense to understand that if they get control of the areas where these PC advocates live, they&rsquo;ll make life more miserable for them than even the Christians they despise could ever succeed in doing.</p>

		<p>Denmark has had trouble for years with these &#8220;people&#8221;, their best course of action would of course be to deport the lot of them. </p>
<p>I saw some of this when I was there in 2002. Liquid pig waste got sprayed on the main square in Copenhagen the night before some big &#8220;pray on rugs,&#8221; thing. I was promptly cleaned up for them. </p>
<p>Public opinion was divided, some wanted to prosecute the leaders for making the women sit in back, some didn&rsquo;t care. Most people just shook their head.</p>
<p>The problem is the Muslem&rsquo;s expect the Danes to bend over backwards for them, whether it&rsquo;s removing pork from school lunches or forcing the danes to adhere to their stone age religious customs.</p>
<p>You can of course simply substite U.S. in the above paragraph and have it ring just as true.</p>
<p>Until Muslem populations figure out that they are living in a secular society not governed by their religious laws and customs and behave accordingly, a nations best hope is to keep them the hell out.</p>

		<p>The law of the jungle states that the strong shall prey upon the weak.  As long as Danish men continue to act emasculated in the face of these culturally incompatible medieval Islamic lunatics they can expect more of the same and it will intensify as the Muslims become more and more emboldened by Danish cowardice&hellip;           </p>
