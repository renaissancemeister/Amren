<h1><a href="https://www.asahi.com/english/Herald-asahi/TKY200812120064.html">Japan Moves Carefully Toward Islamic Finance</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Manabu Hara, Asahi (Japan) Shimbun, December 12, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Japanese government has taken a small but important step toward introducing Islamic finance here amid the global financial crisis triggered by unsustainable subprime loans in the United States.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the Financial Services Agency (FSA) amended financial regulations to let bank subsidiaries handle Islamic finance operations.</p>
<p>The Islamic finance market has become increasingly attractive for Japanese, having already grown to about $1 trillion with a potential to reach an estimated $4 trillion.</p>
<p>Obviously, &#8220;oil money&#8221; has been undermined by the global financial crisis. Yet the latest push forward by the FSA strongly suggests that Japan has a growing interest in Islamic finance as a competitive way to attract huge amounts of petro-funds.</p>
<p>Last year, the Japanese government revealed its Asia Gateway Initiative, which includes the promotion of Islamic finance as a method to develop the Asian bond market.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry also touched upon Islamic finance in last year&rsquo;s White Paper on Trade.</p>
<p>Other countries, like Britain and Singapore, are way ahead of Japan in the field, having made moves to use Islamic finance to enhance their own financial markets.</p>
<p>Bringing in oil money</p>
<p>Yoshihiro Watanabe, managing director of the Institute for International Monetary Affairs, said the significance of Islamic finance is &#8220;to bring in oil money to Japan and stimulate the Japanese economy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Etsuaki Yoshida, deputy division chief at the Policy and Strategy Department for Financial Operations at the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), is known as one of the few specialists in Japan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although this is my personal view, the current (global) situation actually heightens the relative significance of getting involved (in Islamic finance),&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Although only a few books on Islamic finance have been published in Japan, Yoshida has already written two of them.</p>
<p>Experts acknowledge that Islamic finance is also important for starting projects in the Middle East and can serve to enhance the Asian bond market.</p>
<p>Despite the various barriers remaining in Japan, the private sector has been participating in a number of overseas projects through Islamic financing methods. This year, a Mizuho Corporate Bank subsidiary in the Netherlands became a lead manager of a syndicated loan for a Saudi Arabian project to mine and refine phosphate ore. Part of the loan was made through Islamic financing.</p>
<p>In Malaysia, a subsidiary of Aeon Credit Service Co. and Toyota Capital Malaysia Sdn. Bhd now extends car loans through Islamic financing plans, while the Tokio Marine Group sells Takaful Insurance, a type of Islamic insurance.</p>
<p>Islamic finance has also spread to bourses. The Tokyo Stock Exchange and Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s jointly developed an index for Shariah-compliant companies. Daiwa Asset Management Co., meanwhile, created Shariah-compliant exchange-tradable funds that are now a feature on the Singapore Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>JBIC has taken the leading role in dealing with Islamic finance in Japan, participating in syndicated loan investment projects partly funded through Islamic financing in Bahrain in 2005 and Saudi Arabia in 2006.</p>
<p>One of JBIC&rsquo;s goals was to accumulate know-how and experience regarding Islamic finance. But the JBIC&rsquo;s role in those projects was limited to financial assistance through conventional methods.</p>
<p>In 2006, JBIC established the Shariah Advisory Group within its headquarters to learn from Muslim scholars well-versed in the tenets of Islam and Islamic finance. The organization has since been hosting study groups with three major Japanese banks: Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd; Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp Ltd.; and Mizuho Corporate Bank.</p>
<p>Furthermore, JBIC became the first Japanese organization to join the Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB), an international organization based in Malaysia whose goal is to promote and enhance the Islamic financial services industry. JBIC also has business ties with the Central Bank of Malaysia concerning Islamic financial services.</p>
<p>Overcoming barriers</p>
<p>However, in the face of the &#8220;worst global financial crisis in 100 years&#8221; and watching crude oil prices drop sharply, skeptics doubt if oil money can really weather this financial storm. In fact, the rapid growth of Islamic finance in the Middle East has been showing signs of a slowdown since last year. Some say Islamic finance has actually started to shrink.</p>
<p>Watanabe, however, remains optimistic.</p>
<p>&#8220;A revaluation loss on oil money should have occurred, but the money (as compared to the West) is not gained through debt-based investments but rather profits from oil sales,&#8221; Watanabe said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Crude oil prices have gone down, but (oil) funds will continue to accumulate. (Middle East countries) are facing the major issue of where to look for safe, high-return investments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although bank subsidiaries in Japan can now participate in Islamic financial transactions, the environment has not reached a point where one can expect a surge in banking institutions specializing in Islamic finance.</p>
<p>Specialists like Watanabe and Yoshida both point to complications in the Japanese tax and legal systems that have hampered the spread of Islamic finance.</p>
<p>Watanabe said transactions involving commodity trade are subject to value-added tax, which makes the financial transaction too expensive.</p>
<p>Yoshida said it is necessary to define the nature of sukuk, or Islamic bonds. According to Yoshida, if sukuk are indeed corporate bonds, they should not be taxed. But if they are considered trust beneficiary rights, they become subject to withholding tax at the source.</p>
<p>Yoshida also cited the difficulty of networking. The crux lies in finding investors and matching them with suitable investment choices, he said.</p>
<p>Watanabe added, &#8220;If the main body (company headquarters) cannot handle Islamic finance, it will probably become an overwhelming burden.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under the ongoing global financial crisis, money that arrived here via banking institutions in Europe and the United States is already being channeled back to the United States. And that is what is causing serious damage to stock and real estate prices.</p>
<p>If Japanese financial institutions could channel oil money directly to Japan, it may help to mitigate the crisis here. That is precisely why some say Japan needs to overcome the hurdles and promote Islamic finance.</p>
<p>Fact File: A system based on Shariah principles</p>
<p>Islamic finance differs in various ways from conventional financial services that have developed in the West.</p>
<p>The basis of all Islamic finance lies in the principles of Shariah, or Islamic Law. Thus, the Islamic form of finance is sometimes called Shariah-Compliant Finance.</p>
<p>Central to Islamic finance is the fact that interest, known as riba, is prohibited. All gains and risks must be shared between the person providing the capital and the business proprietor or owner. And the transactions must basically involve trade backed by assets.</p>
<p>Speculation (Maisir) is also forbidden, as are transactions with businesses dealing with pigs, alcohol, gambling and other items that are not Shariah-compliant.</p>
<p>One popular form of transaction used by banks is Murabahah financing, which is said to account for as much as 70 percent of all Islamic finance deals.</p>
<p>Murabahah financing involves markups on goods, such as cars and houses, mostly for personal use. A bank plays go-between for the supplier and the purchaser by buying the desired commodity from the supplier.</p>
<p>The bank then resells the commodity with a markup price to the client, who pays for it in installments, including the markup amount.</p>
<p>Conventional Japanese regulations have prevented banks from buying or selling commodities as part of their business operations. But a recent measure adopted by the Financial Services Agency allows subsidiaries of banks to take part in such transactions.<br>

		<p>Hey, this is what happens when our society bases itself on false premises. Everything crashes, and the fiscally responsible nations will take their money elsewhere. If the Islamic World can best suit the economic needs of Japan, then that&rsquo;s where Japan should look. America became the world economic leader by having a better financial system than anyone else. The last few decades have seen our country destroy the basic structure that any large and self-sufficient economy needs to survive. (i.e. Domestic Production) We have squandered all of our savings, and our international political capital has pretty much run dry. From the middle part of the 20th Century on, we&rsquo;ve been living off of the good credit that our forebearers built. That is almost all gone now. The rest of the world sees our weakness. Today, the stock market rose after the Fed. slashed interest rates to 0.25%, but what will the stock market do tomorrow or in the weeks to come? What&rsquo;s the Fed. going to do when the market resumes it&rsquo;s decline? Are they going to cut rates to 0%? If they do that, what&rsquo;s their next step? Can they drop the interest rate below zero? LOL. That would mean they&rsquo;d be paying people to borrow money. That would be like a bank paying you interest to take a loan from them. Zero is as far as it goes. What weapons do they have left in their arsenal? Nothing the government does seems to have any long-term effect. I think the slime in Washington knows that the system is fixing to crash, and they&rsquo;re just trying to buy enough time to get their affairs in order, and to ready us for the unavoidable police state that would be required to hold this country together during an economic depression. Although, I really don&rsquo;t think marshall law could keep this multiracial hell-hole together once it finally starts to unravel. The government wont have the resources or manpower to police the entire country. It takes money to fuel a military, and that&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;re running out of. The Soviet Union fell because in went bankrupt. I think we might be fixing to see the same thing.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about Japan; they know the score over there.  You don&rsquo;t see the Japanese replacing themselves, despite the fact that their fertility is low.  This is just a cynical move to bring in oil money, not the preemptive surrender it would be in the West.</p>

		<p>The Japanese have very intelligent economic policy  &mdash;  they have complete control of their culture and are quite comfortable doing what they can to make foriegners with money comfortable. To act as though Japan, a country uncomfortable with letting half japanese half koreans immigrate or become citizens is rushing to open mosques and convert to Islam and welcome arabs into the country is absurd, and anyone who thinks so is either trying to pull one over on you or are themselves an idiot.</p>

		<p>I only wonder, if the Islamic system might be in the long run less prone to &#8220;bubbles&#8221; than ours, that is based on interest and debt. </p>

		<p>yeah, what the guy at 4:03 AM on December 17 said</p>
<p>Or to put it another way:<br>
Pakistanis in Japan: 10,912 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistanis_in_Japan)<br>
Pakistanis in Britain: 900,000 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Pakistanis)</p>
<p>Also a quote from Wikipedia: &#8220;The number of Pakistanis illegally residing in Japan is believed to have peaked in 1992 at 8,056 individuals&#8221;   &mdash;  - i.e. after that, the Japanese woke up, realised they didn&rsquo;t need cheap alien labor, and very politely arrested them and shipped them back to Pakistan.<br>

		<p>There is nothing wrong with doing business with muslims. Not immigration, just business. Actually Muslims always break the spirit, if not the rule of Sharia finance laws. For a good account of this check out the book WHY I AN NOT A MUSLIM.</p>

		<p>There is nothing wrong with attracting finance from Muslim countries. And the rules of Islamic finance are not at all objectionable.<br>
The Muslim countries seem to be taking their money out of the USA and investing elsewhere. Japan is a much safer bet than the USA.</p>
