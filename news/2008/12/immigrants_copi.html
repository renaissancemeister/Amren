			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Shannon Proudfoot, Canwest News Service, Dec. 22, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For many immigrants and refugees, the first Christmas in Canada means first snows, dazzling light displays and weaving their own traditions in with those of their new home.</p>
<p>But the festive excess of North America can also be difficult for those fleeing extreme deprivation and for newcomers grappling with poverty and unemployment.</p>
<p>&#8220;The whole concept of Christmas is both exciting and overwhelming for these families,&#8221; said Chris Friesen, the Vancouver-based director of settlement services for the Immigrant Services Society of British Columbia.</p>
<p>Many are dealing with culture shock, he says, and those whose families aren&rsquo;t intact feel that more acutely at a time when everyone is focused on family. Even Santa Claus is a hard-to-grasp notion for children who have lived through upheaval in their homelands, he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;For many of the refugee children who have been in these camps for years and years, the whole concept of this person who dresses up and you&rsquo;re supposed to tell him your wishes for Christmas is absolutely foreign,&#8221; Friesen said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s daunting and a little bit scary on the one hand, but also exciting.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Edmonton Mennonite Centre for Newcomers was &#8220;buzzing&#8221; with excitement last week over the annual end-of-term holiday party for the adult language students, says executive director Jim Gurnett.</p>
<p>The party typically includes a potluck lunch overflowing with ethnic dishes, decorations and gift exchanges, while students practice their English skills in a show that&rsquo;s earned big laughs in the past for riffing on the frustrations of shopping as a newcomer.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a real excitement about discovering how Canada celebrates this major holiday and figuring out how to be part of it,&#8221; Gurnett said.</p>
<p>He estimates about one-third of the 10,000 people who access the centre each year come from predominantly Christian countries where Christmas is celebrated, though they&rsquo;re curious about the North American version of the holiday. Another third has no strong faith background and is intrigued by the celebration, he says, while the rest come from other faiths.</p>
<p>Like other multicultural agencies, Gurnett says the centre takes pains to make its holiday celebrations inclusive and respectful of other traditions and beliefs.</p>
<p>However, he believes the commercialization of Christmas is more stressful for newcomers than any religious issues. Immigrants face the same difficulties as Canadian-born families with little money around the holidays, he says   &mdash;   especially when their children begin to acclimate to Canada and want to celebrate like their classmates.</p>
<p>Maya Rajeev Jonathan, 27, moved to Canada from Sri Lanka just three weeks ago and her husband was fortunate to land a customer service position almost immediately.</p>
<p>Rajeev Jonathan is still looking for a job, but they have an extensive network of family and friends in Toronto and she&rsquo;s been thoroughly delighted by the snow, decorations and lights accompanying what she says is only a minor holiday in her homeland.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even though Christmas is not our festival, we are quite enjoying Christmas by going shopping and going to Christmas parties,&#8221; she said.</p>

		<p>So, these &#8220;immigrants&#8221; cant handle Xmas because it reminds them too much of the poverty from whence they came.  But isn&rsquo;t that why they &#8220;moved&#8221; to Canada to begin with, for the prosperity and away from the deprivation?</p>

Now Christmas lights have become harmful to immigrants. It never ends. Yet another problem that wouldn&rsquo;t exist if these people didn&rsquo;t make the CHOICE to come the west.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t they try mixing cultures. Maybe, by a nativity scene, they can have immigrants throwing rocks at Satan. Services with female mutilation. How about convincing people to give up their office Christmas ham.</p>

It&rsquo;s not the immigrants who are suffering from Christmas shock, it&rsquo;s the marxist.  The newcomers seem to be enjoying themselves.</p>

		<p>Well by gosh if it is upsetting these new people, many of whom are not even here on a legal basis then we must act. The police need to start going into private homes and start seizing those Christmas tree&rsquo;s, gifts, and any other decoration that makes these newcomers uncomfortable. If they don&rsquo;t our new guest won&rsquo;t feel loved and wanted and you can rest assured if you were in their country they would do everything and anything it took to make you feel at home. Forget your religion and the religions that built America, these guests don&rsquo;t like them so in the interest of peace and love we surely must give them up and accept their ways. They want to come here, grab any freebie they can, then tell us how to live in our own country. THE WORST PART IS THEY IN A BIG WAY ARE ACTUALLY GETTING AWAY WITH JUST THAT.</p>

<p>Duh. If you are not European, not Christian, YOU ARE foreign.</p>

		<p>I will bet most Canadians are the ones who feel like a foreigner in their own country. I know I do, in the America of today. Different races and cultures do NOT bring unity, they bring strife and chaos.</p>

Canada is 85% White, which exists in stark contrast to America which is about 69%. The country is like a smaller version of the UK but with heavy American influence. It does feel noticeably more European in atmosphere and temperament. The largest visible minority is now South Asians (Indians). It used to be the Chinese, but they are no longer emigrating in the numbers they once did given China&rsquo;s recent modernization.<br>

		<p>Reply to 4:27 PM;  &#8220;Canada is 85% White&#8221;,,,</p>
<p> As recently as the late 1960&rsquo;s Canada was almost 99% White. That&rsquo;s a very fast change, still continuing and which no one in Canada was ever asked if they wanted.</p>

		<p>This Christmas eve and day there was literaly NO traditional Christmas programming on Canadian television. Nothing, not even the old cartoons like Rudolph or the Granch ect. The erasing of Christmas from the mainstream meadia is one symptom of the MSM de-Christmasing Christmas because it might make some &#8220;minority&#8221; group upset (even if all they had to do was tunr off the t.v. If European descended Christians want to hand on to their culture and traditions, including Christmas, we will have to become like the Jews, insofar as they exist with a group identity within a larger culture that does not share their traditions of beliefs- or even the Amish and disconnect from the insane and culture destroying elites and their MSM tools and the whole sick apparatus of what used to be Canada. </p>

		<p>White Canadian, I think you&rsquo;re right, up to a point. Canadians as well as Americans have to &#8220;disconnect&#8221; from the MSM culture or there will not be a trace of their traditional culture or customs or even religion left. But if their not allowed to &#8220;disconnect&#8221;,then, as I&rsquo;ve said so often on so many posts, I disgree with those Caucasians, whatever Western Nation they may live in, who forever bellyache about how their heritage  &mdash;  their religion, culture and even their most basic rights are being attacked by the MSM. Too bad. The solution isn&rsquo;t rocket science. </p>
<p>Remember grade school and the class bully? Who were those he finally stopped attacking? Answer: those kids who punched him right in the face, or got together and ganged up on him. Both methods worked beautifully.They would work on a larger scale also. Conversely,what happened when he was allowed to continue his abuse. Answer: he became even more abusive. When I once punched a guy in the face and split his lip, causing it to bleed, he suddently wanted to be my good friend. It was almost embarrasing. </p>

		<p>The Muslim man I know at work doesn&rsquo;t have a problem with Christmas.  My Jewish friends don&rsquo;t celebrate Christmas but don&rsquo;t let it bother them   &mdash;   they have their own holidays.  The person who seems to be most miserable around Christmas time is Abe Foxman.  That just increases my enjoyment of the season.</p>

		<p>Canada has been accepting immigrants to appease the bankers, developers, and land speculators who influence elected representatives.  The growth of population floats their wealth upwards, in a Ponzi scheme that is sold by the media as a great benevolence by &#8216;Canada&rsquo;.</p>
<p>As the African population of its urban centers grows (700,000), so does the African crime statistics, far beyond the national average.  Asians are keeping up their own schemes to accumulate wealth and opportunities and develop their own communities at the expense of whites, are are denied a voice.  </p>

<p><br>
Not necessarily true. Canada may be 85% white in the north or the more rural parts of the nation, but in urban areas white people are fast becoming a minority. In my part of Canada, Vancouver, there are areas like Richmond (a nearby city, home to the international airport)that have a 85% Chinese population with the remaining 15% comprised of whites and every other race and nationality. Surrey another city near Vancouver has populations of East Indians, which far exceed those of whites. No, I disagree with your figures. Whites as a minority is fast becoming a fact.<br>
<p><br>
Canada is a nation on its own. We are not a smaller version of the UK since you could place 10 UK&rsquo;s inside just one of our provinces, just the same way you could place 3 or 4 states in one province. And, the whole world has a heavy American influence, not just Canada. </p></p></p>
