<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Prosecutors allege Jie Hua Zhou of Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., arranged dozens of fake marriages to help foreign nationals live in the United States.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Zhou&rsquo;s alleged sham marriages were discovered during &#8220;Operation Newlywed Game,&#8221; run by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency in Orange County in 2005, said federal immigration officials.</p>
<p>Zhou allegedly offered money, sometimes as much as $10,000, to U.S. citizens if they would marry Chinese citizens who wanted to live in the United States, the Register reported.</p>
<p>Immigrants were charged between $20,000 and $50,000 for Zhou&rsquo;s alleged services, which included arranging for fake wedding photos, opening joint bank accounts and filing joint tax returns, the indictment said.</p>

		<p>The chinese are here to milk the system, pure &amp; simple.  Being intelligent just makes it all the easier for them to figure things out.</p>

		<p>This marriage scam has been going on for at least 30 yrs, so what&rsquo;s new under the sun? When I was 19, there was this 26-year-old Chinese student I befriended. Once we were close, she made it clear to me that she wanted to live in America, and offered me $10,000 to marry her. I might have been young at the time, but I politely declined the offer. The sex was free.   </p>

Your relationship with her would still draw the ire of hardcore WN. Contrary to popular belief, those Asian women do NOT consider Whites to be more likeable than their own Asian male counterparts. They see White males as walking dollar signs and/or walking green cards, and sadly there are thousands upon thousands of insecure White men in America tripping over themselves to have one. So even though you ultimately rejected her (assuming your story is even true), there is for sure another who said YES and got duped.</p>

		<p>Fluxkpacitor is right.  Let me tell you something.  If you want to get into relationships with foreigners, why not sponsor a white person from South Africa or Zimbabwe for a green card?  Someone who saw his or her family murdered for their farm maybe?  How about a health care professional tired of dealing with the extremely high rate of A.I.D.S in Africa and constant civil wars and stuff?  Maybe he or she would appreciate a nice racially conscious spouse.   </p>

		<p>My wife was actually a bit leery of coming to the US.  Blacks, crime and learning to drive on the right were not things she found appealing.</p>
<p>If someone had offered me $10 K for a green card marriage, I&rsquo;d have held out for half right away and half after the marriage, and then taken the $5 K and run.  Dishonest folks are the easiest to cheat, and what would she do?  Complain to the INS?</p>

		<p>Another typical Chinese and scam is fake birth certificates.  This means that a legal Chinese immigrant citizen can bring over all sorts of non relatives under the family unification scheme.</p>
<p>They will claim a complete stranger is their child, parent, sibling whatever.  There is also pressure applied by the smuggling gangsters on legal immigrants who have become citizens to sponsor bogus relatives.</p>
<p>But due to racial soladarity, a Chinese US citizen forced to sponsor a bogus relative will never go to the evil whitey authorities.</p>
