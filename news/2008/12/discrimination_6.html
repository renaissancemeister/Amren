			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Susie O&rsquo;Brien, Herald Sun (Melbourne), December 9, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>DISCRIMINATION against dominant white males will soon be encouraged in a bid to boost the status of women, the disabled and cultural and religious minorities.</p>
<p>Such positive discrimination &mdash; treating people differently in order to obtain equality for marginalised groups &mdash; is set to be legalised under planned changes to the Equal Opportunity Act foreshadowed last week by state Attorney-General Rob Hulls.</p>
<p>The laws are also expected to protect the rights of people with criminal records to get a job, as long as their past misdeeds are irrelevant to work being sought.</p>
<p>Equal Opportunity Commission CEO Dr Helen Szoke said males had &#8220;been the big success story in business and goods and services&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clearly, they will have their position changed because they will be competing in a different way with these people who have been traditionally marginalised,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&rsquo;s open it up so everyone can have a fair go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Victoria&rsquo;s peak business body expressed concern yesterday about the need for the proposed laws, and questioned if they would undermine the right of companies to make legitimate business decisions.</p>
<p>At present, individuals or bodies wanting to single out any race or gender for special treatment must gain an exemption from VCAT.</p>
<p>Companies and public bodies accused of discrimination can only be held to account after a complaint has been made.</p>
<p>But the proposed changes go much further, allowing the commission to inquire into discrimination, seize documents and search and enter premises after attempts to bring about change have failed.</p>
<p>Businesses and individuals would be required to change their ways even if a complaint had not been received.</p>
<p>Action could be taken where an unlawful act was &#8220;likely to occur&#8221;, not just in cases where discrimination has taken place.</p>
<p>The commission would also have real teeth to enforce its rulings via VCAT and, as a last resort, in the courts.</p>
<p>The changes, shown in a Department of Justice report by former public advocate Julian Gardner, would also:</p>
<p>EDUCATE people so they know their rights.</p>
<p>GIVE more protection to people with disabilities, requiring companies and public entities to reasonably accommodate their needs.</p>
<p>GRANT the homeless and people who act as volunteers better protection from discrimination.</p>
<p>Victorian Employers&rsquo; Chamber of Commerce and Industry workplace general manager David Gregory said business supported the objectives of equal opportunity legislation.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I am concerned and curious about whether these changes mean the commission can second-guess the legitimate business decisions of individual businesses,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The first raft of changes to the Equal Opportunity Act were introduced into Parliament last week.<br>

<p>Read how she cheers on the incipient discrimination against native White Australian men, the &#8220;VOMITS&#8221;, as she so wittily calls them.</p>
<p>What are we, the native White men of the West, are to do now that it is abundantly clear that White women, not all, but more than enough, have gone over to the, er, dark side?</p>

		<p>The witch should be told that in America &#8220;women and minorities encouraged to apply&#8221;  means only minority women will be hired.</p>
<p>Hope she loses her job to some burkha clad african women who knows only 100 words of English.</p>
<p>Australians should spend a year in America looking at Los Angeles, New Orleans, Detroit, Atlanta, DC, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Columbus and Cincinatti before they decide to go full steam ahead with affirmative actin aka hire only the unfit and incapable.</p>

		<p>I am a white Australian male who came into the workforce 35 years ago, when the onslaught of feminism and affirmative action  was at its most vicious inception. </p>
<p>Though I lead a comfortable life, I have had to work outside the system, as a self-employed teacher, because of the entrenched bias already in existence against white males. I have six universities. I have published articles and poetry and writte large tomes. But if I compete against some tattooed woman loving woman or Papuan with a bone through his nose in a large firm or in the government, or if such people arbitrarily take offence at an observation of mine, there is no doubt as to who will be favoured in the outcome. </p>
<p>The only reason white males are still dominant is because they are indispensable, because no one else can do what they do-we survive because we are essential to the rest of the so-called progressive freeloaders. When we are gone their house of cards will collapse around their ears.  </p>

		<p>My only thought on this is that if white males, the descendants of those Austrailians who fought, shed blood, built up the nation and paid taxes, allow themselves to be put last  &mdash;  they richly deserve it. Same goes for any citizens of any nation in the world who were the founding population or descendants there of. What else can one say?</p>

		<p>Hell this has been going on since the 1960&rsquo;s.  This is nothing new, but it will increase, no doubt about it.  This country hates white males and females.  Look at our colleges, who gets the aid, blacks (who can&rsquo;t even read) hispanics, muslims and asians.  Our white males have to struggle as they get no help now a days.  So those in washington, who do you think you are kidding it&rsquo;s been going on for decades, how dumb do you think we are??? </p>

<p>Is that before or after the economy collapses like the rest of the West and the non-whites are hacking at the elites&rsquo; doors with their machetes.</p>
<p>When it happens&hellip;and it will&hellip;.I would ask all the Aussie white males to try to keep from laughing out loud, rolling around on the floor, but don&rsquo;t lift even the smallest finger to help them.</p>

		<p>My neighbor&rsquo;s mother is a war bride from Australia.  He told me that she was disgusted with her motherland when she returned in mid 80&rsquo;s for a visit.  Back then, there was just a lot of Chinese.  She hasn&rsquo;t returned since.  When my neighbor&rsquo;s brothers went to Australia, he said his relatives had it made because the Chinese did all the work.  Even though I don&rsquo;t consider Chinese third world people(Hong Kong, Taiwan, etc.), at least they&rsquo;re not as much as a burden, unlike the Africans and muslims.</p>

&ldquo;Clearly, they will have their position changed because they will be competing in a different way with these people who have been traditionally marginalised,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s open it up so everyone can have a fair go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&gt; This is where the beginning of the fall of a culture begins.  The people who set up the businesses and ran them successfully for a long time have a way of doing business that has brought success without government intervention.  The White men who support their families and raise their children.  Now, with fewer jobs families will destabalize because the men will still be required to support them after their women - who will take their jobs - more so than racial minorities - and will divorce the men who cannot get those jobs - but will still require them to support the family after the divorce.  It has literally wrecked America and now it will Australia.</p>
<p>The fact is that &#8220;opening up (opportunities) should not and does not mean taking them from those who created them in the first place and giving them to others who either went along for the ride, or just arrived and are demanding a piece of the pie - that White men baked.</p>
<p>Who would care if more people got jobs because there were jobs?  It is taking them from some to give them to others out of a sort of institutionalized system of revenge on the successful that really is wrong.</p>
<p>But those pushing for it only see the money they can get for themselves and their selfish little groups.  They will deal with the social fallout later.</p>

		<p>How I wish that all of Australia&rsquo;s gainfully employed white males would go on a one week strike to protest the discrimination being lodged against them.  Such a strike would be a shot heard &#8216;round the world and would be a stunning response to those who hate and envy white men for their accomplishments.  Let the &#8220;equally capable&#8221; women and non-white males take up the slack and &#8220;show how well the world can get along without white men.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Such a strike won&rsquo;t happen, of course.  White men have been so browbeaten and intimidated by political correctness that they&rsquo;re afraid of the response if they assert themselves and demand fair treatment and respect.  What a pity!   </p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s a quote from a 19th Century French Psychologist named Gustave Le Bon. Some of you may have heard of him. </p>
<p>  &#8220;The conception of the irreducible differences which <br>
separate human beings is entirely contrary to the <br>
ideas of modern socialists, but it is not the teachings <br>
of science that could induce the apostles of a new <br>
dogma to renounce their illusory doctrines. Their <br>
efforts are a new phase of the eternal crusade of <br>
humanity in quest of happiness, that treasure of <br>
Hesperides for which the peoples have been searching <br>
from the dawn of history onwards. The dream of <br>
equality would perhaps avail as much as the old <br>
illusions which cradled us in the past, were it not that <br>
it is destined to be shattered at an early date on the <br>
immovable rock of natural inequalities. Together <br>
with old age and death, these inequalities are a part of <br>
those apparent iniquities of which nature is full arid <br>
to which man must submit.&#8221;</p>
<p>I forget who it was that said, &#8220;that which cannot continue, won&rsquo;t.&#8221; We have built our modern societies on lies. Our society is doomed to failure the same way that a buisness which does not understand simple economics is destined to go bankrupt.</p>
<p>I strongly urge all of you to read Gustave Le Bon if you haven&rsquo;t already. You can find two of his works online for free at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/" rel="nofollow">https://www.gutenberg.org</a>  </p>

		<p>No White supporter of affirmative action is ever willing to give up anything themselves.  One reason I have no respect for the mental health &#8220;professions&#8221; is that they do not address the mental illness that is liberalism.  Why is slicing your arm a sign of clinical depression or whatever, but giving your future and your country away is not?  </p>

		<p>Live in Melbourne&hellip;.Just picked up the children  from school<br>
 after spending  half an hour in the neighborhood of Footscray<br>
where their school is located&hellip;</p>
<p>Noticed nunerous Africans wandering aimlessly around or ominously lurking on street corners at 3.30pm&hellip;hmmm no job?<br>
no study?&hellip;reminded of my travels  in the US over 20 years ago<br>
same scene..different time&hellip;different city,,different country</p>
<p>well at least with this equal opportunity iniative we might get some of them off the streets and into our offices and workplace and boost<br>
our efficiency and productivity </p>
<p>we might even get one of them elected PM one day!<br>

<p>Australia is said to be a socialist paradise. At least, in the early 90&rsquo;s I knew this friend who idealized moving there because of that. Why can&rsquo;t whites be allowed to enjoy the fruits of socialism - if that&rsquo;s the way one is so inclined? </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m beginning to think these &#8216;elites&rsquo; are really afraid of socialism and communism, and not the other way around. They are certainly making their progressive society an ugly one for whites. </p>

		<p>   Let&rsquo;s be honest, what they are proposing is anything but  &#8220;a fair go.&#8221; It is nothing short of institutionalized discrimination against white males . I submit that this type of federally mandated discrimination had been in force in the U.S. since the late sixties.But your chances of incurring it are significantly less if you live in a 80 to 95% white area .That is why I try to tell any young Southerner who will listen, &#8221; get out of the South, most especially the black belt,&#8221; I believe more and more are figuring it out for themselves and polarization is beginning to occur on a small scale .The future of the South ? We&rsquo;ll just have to wait and see . Objectively, I believe Thomas Chittum&rsquo;s and David Duke&rsquo;s predictions will prove to be surprisingly accurate .  </p>

<p>I disagree with this statement completely.  Whites are like a big dog being cornered and continually poked with a stick.  Sooner or later, Whites will grow angry and fight back.  Like the AmRenners, others too will awaken.  The White spirit may be dormant, but not dead.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t believe it is a coincidence that the exact same &#8216;fair go&rsquo; law which discriminates against white males is being implemented in the UK at the same time by New Labour Minister Harriet Harman. The neo-Marxist EU/NWO creeps are being squeezed by Nationalists in every European country and are hurriedly implementing further draconian measures to step up their increasingly totalitarian control of the people they are supposed to be serving.</p>
<p>As well as the neo-Marxists in charge of the EU(SSR), the NWO man, Aussie Labour PM Kevin Rudd, is implementing the South Asian plank of their One-world government plan by calling for a Union of South Asian nations. And of course once in office Obama will be pushing for the USA/Canada/Mexico &#8216;trade deal&rsquo; to be concluded. I believe the Internet education of ordinary people worldwide has forced the NWO elitists to push forward the plans for the implementation of their One-world government. Any skeptics about such a cabal might be interested in viewing the following web site:</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what irritates me the most with this self-righteous white &#8220;liberals&#8221;.  They want equality and for other whites to sacrifice their race, their money, their children, their privileges, yet these white liberals live far away from minorities, they send their kids to nice private schools, and they look for lots of loopholes too.

		<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s pretty safe to say the West has had its day, and is now in a state of complete de-evolution and decline. The party is over&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I disagree with this statement completely. Whites are like a big dog being cornered and continually poked with a stick. Sooner or later, Whites will grow angry and fight back. Like the AmRenners, others too will awaken. The White spirit may be dormant, but not dead.</p>

<p>Buddy, we&rsquo;ve been saying that for over 40 years.  Every time a pro-white movement gets off the ground, it&rsquo;s stoped or ridiculed to no avail.  If whites were awakening, they&rsquo;d not elected Obama.  If whites were awakening, there would be no non-white immigration, and you wouldn&rsquo;t see black guys and white girls together.  </p>

		<p>Positive discrimination? What is positive discrimination? Oh, of course: &#8220;Crush &#8216;dem whities.&#8221; I do not understand why majority white nations worldwide   &mdash;   and particularly those of the British Commonwealth (UK, Canada, Australia)   &mdash;   are in such a rush to commit national suicide. </p>

		<p>How does this sort of thinking square with the situation in Zimbabwe where a black population is destroying itself? As an experiment in black self-rule it is without compare.The nascent world leaders in China (who are racist and unapologetic about it) must be chuckling.</p>

		<p>Notice how 100% of the burden of such government mandated racial discrimination falls only upon young white males just entering the job market. They don&rsquo;t go and fire older white males in the who already have jobs to make room for the new preferred racial groups (mostly recent immigrants, many not even citizens) so that it&rsquo;s not just young whites who must suffer.</p>
