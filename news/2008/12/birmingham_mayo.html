			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Val Walton, Birmingham News, December 01, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Birmingham Mayor Larry Langford was arrested this morning on federal charges and is being held at the federal courthouse, the FBI and other federal officials confirm.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A special grand jury for several months has been investigating county bond deals and Langford&rsquo;s financial dealings. Langford was Jefferson County Commission president 2002-06.</p>
<p>Al LaPierre, a close friend of Langford&rsquo;s who also was part of the federal investigation, will be surrendering today, said his attorney, Tommy Spina.</p>
<p>David McKnight, Montgomery banker Bill Blount&rsquo;s attorney, said Blount is on his way to Birmingham from Montgomery to surrender.</p>
<p>The Langford, LaPierre and Blount indictments are under seal, so details of the charges are not available.</p>
<p>Langford, LaPierre and Montgomery investment banker Bill Blount are accused in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit of not disclosing $156,000 in payments to Langford. The SEC has accused Blount of paying Langford through LaPierre as part of a plan to secure Jefferson County financial business when Langford was Jefferson County Commission president.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This statement was released from the mayor&rsquo;s chief of staff, Deborah Vance-Bowie.:</p>
<p> &#8220;As you know, the Mayor was detained this morning by federal authorities. We do not know the details of his detention at this time. City business will go on as usual as we are all here to do a job and we&rsquo;ll continue to do our jobs to ensure we deliver the best services to the taxpayers of Birmingham. This is certainly no surprise to us &mdash; we anticipated something happening soon especially knowing Alice Martin&rsquo;s days in office are numbered with the swearing in of a new president in late January &mdash; just a little over a month from now. We are glad the mayor will finally have his day in court. As members of his team, we stand behind him and look forward to the day when we can return the focus to the important issues before the city.&#8221;</p>

		<p>He&rsquo;s black! You have to be kidding! As a daily reader of my local liberal rag, The Cleveland Plain Dealer, I thought only white guys were crooks. Blacks are only famous scientists, athletes, statesman, and constant victims of white racism.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a link in the original article that will yield a compendium of Birmingham News stories over a one plus year time span of Larry Langford &#8220;TNB&#8221; corruption proclivities. The link I&rsquo;ve supplied is to an article about a problem he had with a $50K debt at a haberdashery. Sort of like Oprah&rsquo;s mama. </p>
<p>How do these people run so long and so blatant before it all comes tumbling down? It&rsquo;s as if they were in a full blown campaign to test the limits of impunity. I wonder if Morris and Heidi are going to weigh in on this.</p>

		<p>Another Black politician commits a series of felonies. Film at 11.</p>
<p>Consider the facts&hellip; Blacks consistently receive every benefit of the doubt, free pass, and affirmative-action-nod imaginable. Our society revolves around looking the other way whenever the actions of Blacks are considered &#8220;negative&#8221; by normal standards. Crimes committed by Blacks are often excused, overlooked, dismissed, or apologized for by the Marxists and Egalitarians in our society. Consequently, I am doubtful of the possibility of justice being served in this case.</p>
<p>Look for charges of racism against Mayor Langford&rsquo;s White political opponents to surface within a day or so. You can almost set your watch by it.<br>

		<p>Word is here in Birmingham that Langford spent the bribes on clothing and bling.  This is the guy who recently asserted that God could and would stop crime in the city.  I&rsquo;ve often thought that I would like to be &#8220;left behind&#8221; at the Rapture so I could watch some of those three hundred pound fundamentalists fly up into the air.  But if God is going to stop black crime in this city, He had better lay off the booze and start joggin&rsquo;.  (It would mortify the mayor to wear that orange prison garb.  I mean, tacky tacky.)</p>

		<p>I read this in the Birmingham news online. The people commenting were definately against him. They of course were mostly educated people inferred from the fact that they were reading the article.</p>
<p>I visited with my uncle who lives just outside of Selma over the Thanksgiving Holiday. He told me how bad it is shopping in the local Wal-Mart. He said blacks will actually bump into him on purpose seeing if they can cause a confrontation. He said they will also come and stand in front of you while you are trying to find something on the shelf. If you ask for him with something, you had better be prepared for rude behavior. They resent his presence. </p>
<p>I experienced this while in St. Louis. I was on a business trip with a co-worker, who happens to be half white and black. We went into an Arbys. The employees just stared at us and took orders from people around us. They would not talk to us. We had to leave. Everywhere I went, the service was horrible. That&rsquo;s one place I will not visit again for anything.</p>

		<p>As usual for dems, this politicians political affiliation is nowhere to be found in this stroy. The cnn version of this story also declined to mention that Langford was a dem. Strange how the media has no problem mentiong that republicans are republicans when accused of wrongdoing. </p>

		<p>So hizzoner IS black.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t tell from the picture of him in the Yahoo news story yesterday.  Somehow the trick lighting they used made him look so washed-out and his hair so blurry, it was not possible to tell just by looking.  </p>
<p>I have to come to Amren to find out these things, every time.</p>
<p>Do you think &#8220;they&#8221; (the Cultural Marxists and their media enablers) are onto us, that us Amren readers always check the photos when they describe the (black) perp as &#8220;a man&#8221; or &#8220;people&#8221; or &#8220;shoppers&#8221; or Birmingham mayor, and now &#8220;they&#8221; are doctoring photos?</p>

Isn&rsquo;t that just like the black millionaire and Dartmouth graduate who posted here a couple of months ago?   The one who  bragged about spending $400. at Macy&rsquo;s on cuff links and cologne and thought the saleslady wasn&rsquo;t sufficiently deferential to him?</p>

		<p>There are an immense amount of crooked white politicians.</p>
<p>But black politicians, percentagewise, per their share of the population, are so much greater it is only the stupidist of whites who vote for them.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t fool anybody but the mentally challenged.  I wonder if this guy, like Kirkpatrick in Detroit, is going to refuse to leave office.</p>
<p>I also wonder how much cash he has stashed away in his freezer.</p>

		<p>We live just outside of Birmingham, but shop and work in the city.  The mayor is fair to the city workers, which is a good thing.   The voters that elected him knew he was under investigation before the election.  By Birmingham being majority black, they didn&rsquo;t want to elect the half black, half white man running against him.  I believe our local news last night reported that about thirty-eight people associated with the county commission, have either been indicted, convicted, or investigated on corruption charges.  It really is a darn shame, and they have not been all black, so you can see the corruption runs deep down south.:(</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s brutha Kwame Kirkpatrick of Detroit who is now serving time in jail due to his inability to control his sexual impulses, and inability to tell the truth.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the black congressman who stores bribe money in his freezer.</p>
<p>Now here comes another black city potentate who just can&rsquo;t handle personal responsibility and power.  Just too much fun to be had and money to score on the side.</p>
<p>All these blacks had just one simple job to do and that was to run their cities and districts. They were elected to clean up their communities and districts, to make sure trash was picked up on time, to keep street lights on, to make their districts safe from crime, and to keep them clean.  These offices are what they asked for in the name of black power and achievement, but they were just too corrupt and incompetent to pull it off. </p>
<p>The comdedy of black political &#8220;leadership&#8221; continues, and you can bet your last buck that their sheeple will continue to vote the same characters or types of characters in time and again.    </p>
