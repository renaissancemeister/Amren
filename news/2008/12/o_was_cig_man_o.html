			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Cynthia R. Fagen, New York Post, December 18, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Taken during a 1980 photo shoot by Occidental College pal Lisa Jack, the snapshots show that the freshman was already showing off the quiet confidence of a future president.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was very charismatic even then,&#8221; Jack recalled of the brief encounter at her off-campus Los Angeles apartment.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was really cute. What else does a 20-year-old girl remember?&#8221; she told Time, which published the rare shots in its year-end issue that names the president-elect 2008&rsquo;s Person of the Year. &#8220;He was a little nervous,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You can see he&rsquo;s just posing, initially, and as the shoot goes on, he starts to come out.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In some of the black and white film frames, Obama, who called himself &#8220;Barry,&#8221; sports a straw fedora at a rakish angle and takes a deep drag off a cigarette.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>During the campaign, Obama admitted he still liked to sneak a smoke every now and then. But he has since sworn off the habit, promising to keep the White House a smoke-free zone.</p>

		<p>What I don&rsquo;t get is that Obama has been on-again off-again with the smoking habit, yet his party is viciously against tobacco cigarettes (but not Mary Jane).  Are the Democrats in Congress going to push to force their own President to pay more for cigs?</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re mistaking &#8220;quiet confidence&#8221; for an attitude formed by having everything given to him, with few frustrations.</p>
<p>Mark my words.  When the frustrations start to come as pres, see how long it takes for him to constantly lose his &#8220;cool.&#8221;<br>

		<p>This is bad, very bad.</p>
<p>It sounds like the typical black &#8220;performance.&#8221; I hope it is just youthful being-full-of-oneself, but it still seems to point to an abiding arrogance, when put with some of Barry&rsquo;s other stuff.</p>
<p>I wonder if &#8220;Barry&#8221; had one of those special walks that blacks do, you know  &mdash;  where they get into some funky rhythm, with all these jerking motions, and walk past females trying to impress them?</p>
<p>Politics should not be theatre (but it is), and Barry Obama is not Barry Gibb, who also was a cool heart-throb who took his other Brothers Gibb from fading popularity to newfound glory when they stormed, indeed created, the disco music scene.</p>
<p>Disco was the rage, just like Obama. But yet, a few years later, a &#8220;disco sucks&#8221; movement by former dis-illusioned syncophants swept it all away, with the Bee Gees albums literally being burned in bonfires. </p>
<p>Will there be an anti-Obama movement, among his staunchest followers? </p>
<p>I think so, I think so.   </p>

		<p>Apologists will no doubt draw parallels between this and the Advertisements Ronald Reagan did during his movie career for cigarette companies like Winston and Lucky Strike. However, at the time Reagan did the ads, cigarettes were &#8220;mainstream&#8221; and smoking was not frowned upon for its ill health effects as it was by the 1980s. By that time, smoking was definitely a &#8220;rebel&#8221; and a &#8220;forbidden&#8221; thing, and doing so was a way of showing a certain amount of contempt for society and societal norms. Perhaps just another way Obama has shown less than stellar judgment during his lifetime.</p>

He&rsquo;s a smoker to this day but because cigarettes have been certified evil, he&rsquo;s been forced to &#8216;quit&rsquo;. I say &#8216;quit&rsquo; because apparently he smokes on the down-low and away from the view of the media. Can&rsquo;t have the perfect black role model smoking in front of impressionable kids. It would make for a good SNL skit of Obama dealing with a public crisis but unable to light up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s likely to be a big prize to get a photo of Obama smoking. </p>

		<p>Wow, the revisionism is already starting. Yeah sure, even in 1980 he was showing &#8220;the future confidence of a president&#8221;. Right. Probably more like arrogance and the mindless vapidness of most young black males. That cigarette looks pretty funny to me too.</p>

		<p>The cigarette looks hand rolled which could mean it is a &#8220;spiff&#8221; (marijuana&#8221;. Typical of a rebellious young undergrad.   At least he know the dangers of taking drugs and hopefuly wil do much to eliminate the curse on modern society.   The &#8220;Singapore solution&#8221; perhaps.  It works there.</p>

		<p>What I&rsquo;d like to know is, how come we never heard about Obama smoking before he got elected??  It seems fishy to me that it was hush-hush.  Why didn&rsquo;t some right-wing journalist get published a picture of him smoking?  Then this idea about him being a &#8220;messiah&#8221; would have been tainted.  How did they pull that one off??  Hmm&hellip;</p>

		<p>This picture only confirms what I think of Obama - he&rsquo;s simply a poser.  I don&rsquo;t know why americans ever found urban black style cool.  Our entire culture became trashy and dumbed down when they adopted it.  I think Obama is revolting when he talks with his urban accent and tries to fool everyone into thinking he is black and urban.  </p>

		<p>Style and no substance. Nothing has changed since 1980. Why haven&rsquo;t  his undergraduate and law school trnascripts been released? If he so brilliant, why was Bill O&rsquo;Rielly-another  average non-entity type- able to throw Barack Obama-a Harvard Law school grad- all over the debating mate during those two big interviews on FOX.<br>

<p>Now that you mention it&hellip; it really does look like a joint.    &#8220;&hellip;takes a deep drag off a cigarette&hellip;&#8221; must be code, because normally people don&rsquo;t.  Deep drags are for weed.  Guess we&rsquo;ll have a C-in-C who really did inhale.</p>

<p><br>
Agree on both counts, Flamethrower. What the smitten MSM calls &#8220;the quiet confidence of a future president&#8221; may more closely resemble the unwarranted arrogance of a future despot. </p>
<p>As for Barry&rsquo;s brand of smokes, well, I can&rsquo;t be certain. Sometimes a cigarette is just a cigarette   &mdash;   and sometimes it&rsquo;s the wacky tobacky. I don&rsquo;t want to smear the Biracial Wonderboy without evidence   &mdash;   although he HAS admitted to using both weed AND cocaine in the past   &mdash;   but I will say this much: the only times I&rsquo;ve ever seen somebody holding a &#8220;cigarette&#8221; that way, the cigarette was NOT the legal kind. </p>
<p>Regardless of what&rsquo;s rolled up in that paper tube, I still hate that stupid hat he&rsquo;s wearing. He looks less like a future president than a member of The Black &amp; White Minstrels Revue getting ready to do the ol&rsquo; soft-shoe to a Stephen Foster number. </p>

		<p>He looks just like an arrogant, &#8220;got it made&#8221; pimp - and he smooth talked his way into the oval office just the way pimps talk pretty, young naive white girls into first, dating them, and then &#8220;dating&#8221; their friends to help out their relationship - financially.  Then, the big surprise when she finds out that he has similar relationships with many similar girls.</p>
<p>Here is a guy who admits doing drugs, and I don&rsquo;t know what else - who whisked past scrutiny and got into the highest office in the land.  I hope he is smart enought to help more than hurt, but it looks just like a big build up.  How long can a man bluff his way through a very serious situation?</p>

		<p>Not that this has anything to do with the subject at hand, but the Bee Gees came along at the tail end of the disco era, which started, according to who you believe, in 1974 or 1975. The Bee Gees disco music came out in 1978, and a year or two later, disco had run its course, which was unfortunate, because I liked disco.</p>

		<p>Smoking was a &#8221; &#8220;rebel&#8221; and a &#8220;forbiden&#8221; thing&#8221;  ????</p>
<p>No, in 1980 it was a behind-the-times, self-hating loser thing.  Mostly it was for alcoholics, drug addicts, and white trash (not that these categories don&rsquo;t overlap).  Then (and now) only the very lowest stratum of black society smoked.</p>
<p>He was typical of the kind of kid who smokes cigarettes, but he (having been bouyed up by his white mother, white grandparents, whites who indirectly paid for his scholarships, and white professors&hellip;oh, and let&rsquo;s not forget affirmative action) accidentally found his niche in &#8216;activism&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Hitler was a loser who found his niche by accident and became, almost inexplicably, the most powerful man in the world.  And look how great THAT turned out!</p>
<p>I thought nothing could be worse than Clinton, until Bush got into office.  Then, I made the mistake of thinking that nothing could be worse than Bush.  If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, a common thread between Clinton, Bush, and Obama, is a history of substance use as youngsters.  And if I drew a graph to illustrate who used the most unwise substances, it looks like the line will be leading upward in a steep parabolic curve.  The future does not look good.</p>
<p>The most powerful man in the world should be one of the most prudent.  Substance use (cigs, booze, or drugs), regardless of age, is not prudent.  </p>

<p>The Bee Gees began their professional recording career in 1967, trying to imitate the Beatles somewhat.  However, they&rsquo;re most notorious for the Disco   &mdash;   once again, whites are at the top of a medium generally dominated by blacks, Eminem anyone?.  However, their 1967-75 work is rather underappreciated, IMHO, and drowned out by the disco.</p>

		<p>Eminem made his money and now he&rsquo;s fat and happy, literally. I liked the chorus to some of his songs. It&rsquo;s hilarious that blacks liked him so much. Simon off of American Idol said he was a &#8216;genius&rsquo;. I don&rsquo;t get rap. I&rsquo;ve heard other &#8216;wiggers&rsquo; talk of how &#8216;sick&rsquo; some rapper&rsquo;s on-the-spot rhymes are. ??????<br>
I can speak sentences to a beat and make their endings rhyme sometimes. Would I be rapping?</p>

<p>I never heard of disco music before the BG&rsquo;s record, Main Course, which came out in 1975.</p>

		<p>to Mai Opinion 7:01.  I&rsquo;m not sure what news or information sources you generally view, but Obama&rsquo;s smoking was known of, and shown in photos taken very recently. It was no big plot to keep people from knowing it. There is plenty about this man which is suspect, or worse. But getting one&rsquo;s shorts in a bunch over something that is baseless is a waste of time.</p>
<p>The pictures displayed with this article brought to mind this phrase: &#8220;Jamaican beach hustler&#8221;, or replace &#8220;hustler&#8221; with &#8220;pimp&#8221;.</p>
<p>Unlike many on AmRen, I do not feel contempt for, or dislike of, all who are black. In Obama&rsquo;s case, I&rsquo;d be just as suspicious of him if he were white, given the out-of-nowhere this man came from.</p>
