<h1>Is Black Culture the Problem with Education?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Luke Visconti, Diversity, Inc., Dec. 19, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p><strong>Q: Why should public schools receive equal funding? If some communities choose to pay higher property taxes, why shouldn&rsquo;t they be entitled to a more well-funded education if they so choose? Why must the state ENFORCE a faux equality? We all know the D.C. public schools and the California public schools receive some of the highest funding in the country, yet perform miserably. Yet when you look at the states that succeed the most academically, you&rsquo;ll note that while Wisconsin and Minnesota pour money into their public schools, Wyoming and Montana don&rsquo;t. Yet all four states perform in the top 10 in the country. The one common denominator? They all have predominantly white populations.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest: This is a cultural thing, if we&rsquo;re going to throw the genetic component out (and I think for sanity&rsquo;s sake, we should). Name for me a single Black community that outscores the state average for white students. I&rsquo;ll be waiting awhile.<br>
 <br>
The problem isn&rsquo;t an uneven playing field. The problem is that Blacks are simply not even playing the same game as Asians and whites. Until a cultural emphasis is placed on success in the Black community (and it&rsquo;s decidedly not), things simply will not change.</strong></p>
<p>A: It&rsquo;s not intellectually honest to discuss Black educational underperformance as if it is something that arrived on the current scene fully formed. The state isn&rsquo;t trying to force &ldquo;faux equality.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s (ineffectively) dealing with centuries of oppression. Equality in opportunity has never been part of the American experience. We can&rsquo;t run away from that reality because it is responsible for the disparities in outcome by race in the facts you cite.<br>
 <br>
The good news is that getting to a solution for the disparities in education is not difficult when you accept that we are genetically all one human race.<br>
 <br>
This doesn&rsquo;t mean everyone is of equal talent, but it does mean that every group of people has an equal percentage of talented people. Therefore, if education is managed correctly, every town &mdash; Black or white &mdash; SHOULD have the same outcome if the process assumes equal outcome as the only acceptable result. <br>
 <br>
So let&rsquo;s not worry about the past &mdash; let&rsquo;s worry about the future. If our country is going to be sustainable in this global economy, we need to develop ALL of our talent. It doesn&rsquo;t make economic sense to under-educate talented people.<br>
 <br>
If we believe that all people are created equally (and that&rsquo;s a genetic fact), then the only sensible thing for us to do is make sure that all students graduate from public schools with the same qualifications (within the statistical spread that accounts for all individual performance, measured not by group but by the entire United States).<br>
 <br>
If we accept equity in outcome, then we will be forced to reverse our thinking about education. Instead of applying the same failed solutions to the same problems and hoping for the best (or in your case, blaming the victim), we would have to impose conditions on the end result (percent graduating with the same skills, verified by testing).<br>
 <br>
What I think we&rsquo;ll quickly find is that we IMMEDIATELY have to keep schools in low-income areas open 24/7/365 and serve hot meals three times a day &mdash; for the parents too, if they&rsquo;re hungry. And while they&rsquo;re there, let&rsquo;s give skill assessments to the parents and give them education if they need it.<br>
 <br>
Studies show that people who are malnourished have behavior problems &mdash; and I&rsquo;m sure even you would admit that you can&rsquo;t learn if you&rsquo;re hungry. And please, let&rsquo;s not have talk about the responsibility of parents when it comes to hungry children. Let&rsquo;s just feed the kids.<br>
 <br>
To get to equity in outcome, we&rsquo;ll have to come to grips with the fact that the typical school schedule is simply inappropriate for most places in the country &mdash; especially underperforming districts. There are no cows to milk in the inner cities, so there&rsquo;s no reason for students to go home at 3 p.m. In most cities, there are no crops to tend to in the summer &mdash; so the students can stay in school all year long. Further, a recent New Yorker article presented research that demonstrated that poor teachers have a higher impact than poor schools. Let&rsquo;s get to a place where we pay teachers for accomplishment, not just the amount of time on the job.<br>
 <br>
You didn&rsquo;t mention immigrants in your e-mail, but let me add that studies show that learning English is more important than learning the coursework. If we&rsquo;re going to have secure borders and a coherent society, then we need a common language and it&rsquo;s the obligation of &ldquo;we the people&rdquo; to provide that education up front.<br>
 <br>
Is this going to cost money? You bet it will, but not over the long run. Imposing the condition of equitable outcome would create the greatest economic development boom ever seen in our country. The government conducted a study and found that the GI Bill (which gave returning World War II and Korean War veterans free higher education) had a SEVEN to ONE return on investment when you consider tax revenue from better-educated people.**<br>
 <br>
In this time of economic crisis, is there a better way to spend federal and state funds?<br>
 <br>
In closing, I agree with you about a shift in &ldquo;cultural emphasis,&rdquo; but not in the way you framed it. The burden isn&rsquo;t on just Black people &mdash; it&rsquo;s on all Americans. The change in &ldquo;cultural emphasis&rdquo; needs to be that we no longer accept differences in outcome that are based on race. Equity in outcome is the only way to build a sustainable country in a global economic environment.<br>

		<p>&#8220;If we believe that all people are created equally (and that&rsquo;s a genetic fact)&#8221;</p>
<p>The above statement is the main fallacy in this article based on bogus thinking. All people are NOT created equally. Genetics comfirms the fact that people and races of people are NOT EQUAL.<br>
There are many books that support this, such as &#8220;The Bell Curve&#8221; and the works of Dr. Cavalli-Sforza on &#8220;The History of Human Genes.&#8221;</p>
<p>This author is wrapped around the false axle of egalitarianism. He, along with many other deranged liberals maintains that &#8220;we accept equity in outcome.&#8221; In order to pursue excellence, you have to allow exceptional individuals to reach the full extent of their potential. Egalitarianism in education does not allow this. At best, a large number of mediocre students might emerge from a school system under this philosophy.</p>
<p>The best thing for white people is to reject this philosophy of egalitarianism, and allow the top students to strive for the achievement that matches their best abilities. Then there will be no one to blame for the failures of a particular racial group.   </p>

		<p> Not America&rsquo;s responsibilty to feed blacks 24/7. If all are created equal then we also needn&rsquo;t low the bar any further.<br>
 Let the blacks pull themselves up or admit that they cannot function without the white man. </p>

		<p>This article is much bromide filled and nonsense aplenty, because the author admits that racial equality is to be assumed.  In that, he contradicts himself   &mdash;   he says everyone is equal, but admits that the black districts get a lot more money.  And, if you&rsquo;re going to assume racial equality, you&rsquo;re going to have to propose and do a lot of crazy things, in lieu of admitting the truth.</p>
<p>He admits that not every human being is equal, but lectures us that the races are equal.  (How does that work?)  And he is wrong about the genetic proof of racial equality.</p>
<p>Also, I don&rsquo;t get this bit about an 8-to-3 school day.  Most white students have that kind of school day, and they&rsquo;re doing better than blacks on average.  If the races are equal, then why do other races seem to need a different school schedule?  And, if you push the end of classes back further, that takes time away from their precious sports.</p>

		<p>Tell me again why Africans never developed cars, airplanes, agricultural engineering, rockets, indoor plumbing, air conditioning, computers, or a written language. </p>
<p>Remind me why Blacks are always first, by far, on the FBI&rsquo;s annual uniform crime report, in every category, and why they are always first in HIV/AIDS and other STDs. Then, refresh my memory as to why Detroit (a city that is ~90 percent Black) is not permitted to have a Wal-mart or national chain grocery store, and why Harlem must have a prison watch-guard tower in the middle of town.</p>
<p>Whether the subject is failing grades, illegitimate births, welfare, defaulting on loads, joblessness, crime, disease, the prison population, or shear helplessness, Blacks always leave their indelible mark on the world around them. The only way Blacks ever succeed at anything is when Whites spend an enormous amount of effort intervening on their behalf, supervising them, steering them along, and padding the outcome when they fail.<br>

<p>This is a great point. Although - arguably - the Government may be able to turn White people into &#8220;Blacks&#8221;, it is unlikely it will be able to turn &#8220;Blacks&#8221; into White people, no matter how much money it steals from the White people in its attempt to produce that outcome.</p>

		<p>Many people have bought the lie that white schools receive more per-pupil funding than urban schools dominated by blacks and Hispanics; due to federal Title I and II programs, however, it isn&rsquo;t so.  Anytime a liberal argues that we need to equalize funding, just point them to statistics showing that consistently low-performing schools in big cities receive double or more the amount of money per student as do schools in poor but high-performing white rural areas and see if they still believe in promoting equality.</p>

		<p>The &#8220;egalitarian lie&#8221; is not the only false premise for this attempt at an argument.  There is also this howler: &#8220;The state isn&rsquo;t trying to force &ldquo;faux equality.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s (ineffectively) dealing with centuries of oppression.&#8221;  Why is it that many other races which experienced just as many or more &#8220;centuries of oppression&#8221; have done very well in America?  The fact that such groups have in fact thrived in the US is clear, irrefutable evidence of the falsehood of this black apologist&rsquo;s premise.  If it is not the &#8220;centuries of oppression&#8221; used so easily to &#8220;explain&#8221; systematic black failure that is at the root of such failure, then what is it?  It is not just that blacks are not equal to whites and asians, it is that they are decidedly different in every major area which is significant for effectively functioning in any advanced society, viz. deficient in IQ, emotionally, with distorted time preferences and a general outlook which is a perfect script for failure.  How does centuries of &#8220;oppression&#8221; increase one&rsquo;s racial cognitive ability by some 15 points?  These pathetic black apologists had better come up with some new facts before carrying on as if we have learnt nothing during the last century about the nature of racial differences in all of these areas.  This is perfectly characteristic of the typical liberal argument.  Begin with a series of counterfactual propositions and you can &#8220;deduce&#8221; just about anything you like.  In formal logic, if P then Q is always true whenever P is false.  The falsity of P is one of the truth conditions of the propositional entailment.  While the typical liberal is ignorant of formal logic, he is quite good at this particular type of fallacy.</p>

		<p>Good grief! I cannot believe we are still having this conversation. A Black man rose to become the President of the United States; supposedly the apex position in the world. He enjoyed very healthy support among Whites. Enough with victimization and pretense!</p>
<p>Obama, love him or hate him, proves once and for all that Whites should no longer be forced to coddle Blacks. All Affirmative Action laws, policies, and gestures should be banned immediately. All EEO and preferential treatment for Blacks should end now.</p>
<p>Enough with the apologizing and excusing Blacks. It&rsquo;s time for them to stand and succeed or fail on their own merits, just like Whites have to do each and every day.</p>

When you write off the only sensible, the only truthful explanation as a matter of course, there isn&rsquo;t much left to do but make things up, deny, deny, deny, and simply lie. After decades of this, it is astonishing that they can still get away with it&hellip;but denial and deceit, with the aide of willing dupes to play along is fantastically successful!  </p>

<p>Once one starts off with a fallacy like this, no solution will effect a change of any kind.  The Black IQ bell curve is significantly to the left of the White Bell Curve.  However, when Whites were in control many years ago, and Blacks were forced to identify with White standards instead of vice-versa as today, naturally Blacks performed better.  Now Blacks are left to their own devices.  Their culture is a direct result of them being left to their own devices.  We no longer have any power over them; on the contrary they have power over us.  We are sinking to their level.  Our White children are listening to their rap music, speaking like Blacks, dressing like Blacks, walking like Blacks, and overall acting like Blacks.  It is so absurd as to be laughable.  And if I wrote that the media was largely to blame it would be very redundant.</p>

<p>No, just wrong, at least from my viewpoint. What are you, the parents, doing about guiding and correcting your children when such things take place? You brought them into this world, now take the time to raise them properly. When I was about 13 or so, I was starting to pick up some forms of talk that were Not Us. My mother corrected me, gently but firmly, about this.  I not only amended these speech changes, but eventually drifted away from the types who practiced them.</p>
<p>To those of you on here who are parents and who do not provide guidance for your children in what is right, what is good (music, literature, etc), and what is proper, you are in your own way every bit as irresponsible as those who bring kids into the world every 10-12 months and depend on society at large to raise them. In the end, all the rest of us have to put up with the ghetto behavior and attitude regardless the skin color from which it comes.</p>

<p>Equal output requires equal input. You can go on and on forever about how the former is the only &#8220;acceptable result,&#8221; but until you have the latter, it ain&rsquo;t gonna happen. The student who is  not interested in his lessons will never learn as much as the student who is. Enough said.</p>
<p><i>If we believe that all people are created equally (and that&rsquo;s a genetic fact)&hellip;</i></p>
<p>If that were the case, this whole talk of the races would be moot: we wouldn&rsquo;t have any.</p>
<p><i>And please, let&rsquo;s not have talk about the responsibility of parents when it comes to hungry children. Let&rsquo;s just feed the kids.</i></p>
<p>Great way to deflect the most important point in the issue. It&rsquo;s a parent&rsquo;s job to feed his/her children, and if they don&rsquo;t then someone else has to, all of course while also feeding their own families, and all of this is concrete undeniable fact, but let&rsquo;s not talk about it. My whole argument will fall apart if we do.</p>
<p><i>Further, a recent New Yorker article presented research that demonstrated that poor teachers have a higher impact than poor schools. Let&rsquo;s get to a place where we pay teachers for accomplishment, not just the amount of time on the job.</i></p>
<p>Here the author and I finally find a spot of some agreement. But have you ever noticed that poor teachers and poor schools seem to always go hand in hand? Do you think maybe one might be the result of the other? Hmm&hellip;</p>
<p>Not stating anything that hasn&rsquo;t been stated here before. Still, the willful ignorance and stupidity of some people manages to keep on amazing me.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Is Black Culture the Problem with Education?&#8221;</p>
<p>Absolutely not.  Black intelligence is the main problem, with their bad attitudes coming in at a close second.</p>
<p>&#8220;Name for me a single Black community that outscores the state average for white students. I&rsquo;ll be waiting awhile.&#8221;</p>
<p>Name me one black community that outscores any race other than whites?  This is a diverse country.  Let&rsquo;s include everybody.</p>
<p>&#8220;The problem is that Blacks are simply not even playing the same game as Asians and whites.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Hispanics, and American Indians, and eskimos, and Middle Easterners.  How about everybody?  Let&rsquo;s talk about that instead of always pointing out that blacks are behind whites, when they&rsquo;re behind everybody.</p>
<p>It would go a long way to help decrease the jealousy, resentment and hostility, by blacks against whites and give blacks a chance to direct their hatred elsewhere, as they should if we want to continue to be &#8220;diverse.&#8221; <br>

		<p>You can always tell a hopelessly unintelligent person by they way they discuss education, intellectual, and professional acheivement as if it were something that can be given to them or witheld from them like cash or food.  They blame others for their own unwillingness to partake in the task of learning and working.</p>
<p>There are plenty of blacks who leverage their educational opportunities and do just fine in life.  But the blacks who just sit around and whine are either lazy, emotionally undisciplined, or just plain stupid.  And many of them hamstring themselve with Ebonics, which is without a doubt the most pathetic excuse for a communications mechanism in existence.  People who speak it literally sound like retards.  There is no hope for them no matter what their innate intelligence may be.<br>

		<p>AS a police officer who has worked in a black community for 25 years, I can tell you that the violence, vice and pathology I have seen is stunning.  I grew up in a white neighborhood, and the contrast is eye opening.  Of the thousands of blacks I have dealt with over those years, many of them had the intellect, maturity and disposition of a 12 year old child.  <br>

<p>The entire purpose of the educational-industrial complex is to force &#8216;faux equality.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Billions, if not trillions of dollars have been spent chasing this impossible, unattainable dream.  When is enough, enough?  What has been tried over the past 40 years that has narrowed the achievement gap?  </p>
<p>The gap is intractable but idiotic ideas such as the following are what drive the educational system:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Therefore, if education is managed correctly, every town &mdash; Black or white &mdash; SHOULD have the same outcome&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>When insanity such as &#8216;equal outcomes&rsquo; is believed and indeed becomes the prevailing wisdom, and authors such as Charles Murray are dismissed out right as &#8216;racist&rsquo;, it must be a sign of end times.</p>
<p>As Ian Jobling writes in &#8216;Fantasy and Fraud&rsquo;:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;In the past 29 years, neither minority group has ever scored higher than the 30th percentile of the white distribution in reading, math or science&hellip;In math and science, the racial gap has scarcely changed at all since 1975&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obscene that the disproved theories of Stephen Jay Gould, Franz Boas and the Frankfurter School have become the driving forces of educational practices.</p>
<p>When will the notion of &#8216;equal outcomes&rsquo; as something attainable<br>
be finally dismissed, mocked, scorned and buried for the failed premise that it is?</p>
<p>Insanity.  Insanity.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The cultural battle is the political battle at its deepest level.&#8221; This quote from T.S. Eliot is pertinent to what has been taking place in the Western world over the past several decades, and we are now at a point where those who intend to destroy Western culture are involved in a mopping up operation.</p>
<p>Once a culture is degraded and destroyed, there is no compass for society, and all of the youth are affected in negative ways, with black and hispanic youngsters being no exception to this.</p>
<p>While the average I.Q. differences among different racial groups is obviously a key factor in educational success, without the proper cultural world view all are affected. As has been previously pointed out, when there was legal segregation in the South there was actually a higher percentage of black youth graduating from high school with a traditional work ethic, just as was the case for hispanic and whites back in the 1950&rsquo;s and 1960&rsquo;s when there was still a sense of the predominance of Western Civilization among all U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>At this point, I doubt much can be done to bring that back. However history has a way of providing plenty of surprise endings to stories that appeared to be heading to an &#8220;inevitable&#8221; one, and as we appear to be moving into a full blown worldwide depression there could be some important political shifts which might also eventually change the negative cultural realities that have become so prevalent.</p>

		<p>One reason I like watching professional football is because, except perhaps for the coaching staff, the blacks you see are there because they are good at what they do.  There is an absence of politics, affirmative action, and political correctness, with refs calling plays as they see them (for the most part, correctly, but sometimes not) and the game ending with lawsuits, accusations of racism, etc.  It may hurt like hell to lose, especially by a point or two, but the loser goes home and tries to figure out a way to do better next time.  I know the NFL covers up for the bad behavior of many of the atheletes to give it its clean image that appeals to families and women, but I still like it for its overall emphasis on true talent, hard work, and acceptance of losing in a fair competition.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s a bitter pill for half-way intelligent blacks to realize that, as a race, they are life&rsquo;s losers when it comes to IQ, which manifests itself in civilizational abilities, scientific inventiveness, and just about every other categoroy of human endeavor that has advanced us as a species.  But, as has been said by others, they may not be interested in the truth, but the truth is greatly interested in them.  The smartest and most emotionally mature thing blacks could do would be to acknowledge certain unequivocal facts and make the best of it, with a little more humility and gratefulness toward those who have more talents and intelligence but who are willing to help them along.  </p>

		<p>What a nutty article! I had the misfortune to attend a school that was considered only 50% black but had been an all black school at one time. The blacks ruled the roost and chaos, garbage and general disorder filled the halls. One girl I knew from church was raped and became pregnant as a result. She was one of the unfortunate blacks to be considered &#8220;acting white&#8221; and had to be taught a lesson. Unfortunately she could not ID her attackers and did not disclose what had happened until her baby was born. She kept and raised him and has been a general success story. Her parents sued the school for failure to protect her against this sort of attack but I dont know what happened with the suit. Bottom line, keep your kids away from schools that are more than about 5% black. </p>

<p>Like Chinese-American and Korean-Americans, Japanese-Americans are also over-represented in Math and the hard sciences.</p>
<p>Additionally, I think I&rsquo;m right in thinking that Jews and Armenians outperform Anglo-whites in the school systems in the U.S.A. Higher I.Q. or just a more disciplined study ethic?</p>
<p>Hispanics do badly in the L.A. school system but there are always SOME very well-educated Hispanics visible in U.S. public life.</p>
<p>Anyway, what does the term &#8216;Hispanic&rsquo; mean? Is the King of Spain Hispanic? Or the equally-white Fidel Castro? Is Alberto Fujimori Hispanic? Or those Cubans who are wholly of Chinese descent but who are now monoglot Spanish-speakers?</p>

<p>Nope.  The only child I am responsible for feeding is my own.  Moreover, the problem with government giveaway programs is that as the cost to the user(s) of something like this approaches zero, the demand for it asymptotically approaches infinity.</p>
<p>Finally, we are, when last I checked, in a recession.  With the productive segments of society being forced to accept pay cuts just in order to keep their jobs, I think the only appropriate measures where government is concerned is to cut government jobs, cut salaries and benefits to remaining government employees, and cut tax-funded giveaways.</p>

<p> Yes indeed. Is there ANYPLACE that has been improved by an influx of blacks? Is there any spot where the black arrival has LOWERED crime and improved education and social development? The city of Toronto for instance averaged four homicides a year in the 1950&rsquo;s when it was all-White. Now the Jamaican gangbangers often do that in one weekend. Is there anyplace where blacks are that has crime below the national average and wealth and prosperity above it? I would REALLY like to know.

		<p>We need to employ the word culturist to save our school system.  Currently, our school system sees differences in achievement and searches for answers and skips the cultural explanation you highlight.</p>
<p>First it looks for racial differences and finds none.  This, I believe, is good.  If such differences were found it would benefit no one.   But, then it shines its multicultural light and says all cultures are equally wonderful.  This means that none could explain differences.  The only conclusion left is that the system is racist. </p>
<p>Culturism is the opposite of multiculturalism.  Culturists actually take diversity seriously.  Homework rates explain differences in achievement.  But the inaccuracy is not the only problem.  </p>
<p>Multiculturalism&rsquo;s denial of cultural importance and leading to conclusions of racism teaches students that the system is racist.   This leads to despair and anger.  It leads to students saying homework is for whites.  The whole leftist mindset makes students against school.  This is a formula for disaster.</p>
<p>If education schools are going to have any relevance they must stop skipping cultural analysis.  Instead of searching for hidden racism, they better become culturists.  They must ditch multiculturalism for culturism.</p>

		<p>NO - black CULTURE is NOT the problem. In my opinion it is the LACK Of black Culture that is the problem, and the way non blacks alllow these people to infest and infect Decent Things, Idea&rsquo;s, Area&rsquo;s, with their ignorant ways and idea&rsquo;s, ALWAYS trying to raise Them Up. Something that hasn&rsquo;t happened in the last 200 years and won&rsquo;t happen in the next 200. They have No Desire to become part of any Non black nation and black nations have little to offer them or humanity if we consider what they do and have done up to this point.</p>

		<p>The problem is black genetics and intellect.  They just dont&rsquo; have the intelligence to compete on the same level as others.  </p>
<p>Someone earlier mentioned Barack Obama in the comments section.  Yes, he&rsquo;s half white, thus he&rsquo;s more intelligent than the rest.  Like Colin Powell, they&rsquo;re lighter and have more white blood in them.  That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re smarter and more capable. </p>

		<p>&ldquo;Our White children are listening to their rap music, speaking like Blacks, dressing like Blacks, walking like Blacks, and overall acting like Blacks. It is so absurd as to be laughable. And if I wrote that the media was largely to blame it would be very redundant&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t seen the movie &#8220;Gran Torino&#8221; I highly recommend it. The scene where the hapless white boy attempts to &#8220;connect&#8221; with three Detroit blacks is priceless! Walt Kowalski(Clint Eastwood)observes the brothers about to gang-rape the Hmong girl accompanying the cowering white boy and swings his Ford pickup onto the scene with a very loud &#8220;What are you SPOOKS doing?&#8221; The reaction from the jam-packed theater was GREAT, the crowd erupted with CLAPPING and shouts of YEAAAAAA!!! </p>
<p>The blacks immediately threaten the 72 year old Kowalski who then pulls his government-model 1911, points that huge muzzle at the would-be rapists and says &#8220;sometimes people just fxxx with the wrong person&#8221;. Upon exiting, Kowalski derides the &#8220;wimp&#8221; white boy who wets his pants and runs down the street. </p>
<p>Need more Walt Kowalski&rsquo;s to ask what the SPOOKS are doing, then use the required force to get their point across.</p>

<p>The most noticable characteristic of the liberal community in our midst is their signature avoidance of any form of correct reasoning in their statements or beliefs - because it would threaten their laboriously and fallaciously constructed selfhood.</p>
<p>On and on the looney liberal juggernaut goes. It is the first case in modern history wherein a group of fanatical political idealists broaden their blindness to reality to a liklihood of destroying the entire society they were ostensively trying to &#8220;improve.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. John Press wrote: &#8220;We need to employ the word culturist [sic] to save our school system.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Press, I sense you are new at this  &mdash;  at least on this sort of topic in this sort of forum.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be happy to use the word &#8216;culturist&rsquo; if it actually has a definition. Does it? My suggestion for a definition: the belief that all cultures are not equal when measured by some very specific and simple objective standards. To put it more simply, and really get our cards on the table, how about this?: </p>
<p><i>Some cultures are better than others.</i> Is that what you are saying, Mr. Press? If so, you&rsquo;re braver than most.</p>
<p>You also say, to paraphrase: &#8220;Currently, our school system&hellip;looks for racial differences and finds none.&#8221; Are you serious? It does nothing of the kind. Our educational Establishment explicitly rejects the question of racial differences.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I think I hear from you: a simplistic &#8220;either-or&#8221; view that race is irrelevant and &#8220;culture&#8221; is all that matters. I reject that, because it seems obvious to me that race and culture are dynamically, <i>inextricably</i> linked in driving the success  &mdash;  or lack of it  &mdash;  in ethnic groups. </p>
<p>I infer from you that, for example, US descendants of the Atlantic slave trade could and would all be responsible, law-abiding, financially successful, and good parents, if somehow &#8220;we&#8221; (although I personally prefer to sit this one out) could magically change their &#8220;culture&#8221;. Can&rsquo;t happen  &mdash;  because, as some comedian says, &#8220;You can&rsquo;t fix stupid&#8221;. The sky is still blue, and &#8220;culture&#8221; starts and ends with the innate, collective limitations of its members. Think &#8220;bell curve&#8221;.</p>
<p>And as George Carlin used to say: Get a bigger shovel.</p>

Look folks,there are some wicked people who have an inordinate amount of control of this nation and they wish to radically change it to something that isn&rsquo;t close to what the constitution outlined,primarily by flooding it with people who are naturally dependent on government.<br>
Look for more attempts at outlawing guns,speech and property rights.<br>

<p>I too saw the comments by Mr. Press but as I have been ill this past week, I was not able to immediately jump on his fallacies.  I&rsquo;m still not 100% better so my response may be a little weak but here goes:</p>
<p>I found Mr.Press&rsquo;s post a little difficult to follow (even though I was a little dazed from cold medicine) but was most struck by his premise that if we just paid attention to &#8216;culture&rsquo; and quit ignoring it, the entire educational system would finally fall into line and that THIS would be the answer to problems such as NAMs refusing to do homework, viewing educational achievement as &#8216;acting White&rsquo; and could possibly even close the 200 point achievement gap between NAMs and blacks/hispanics.</p>
<p>The so called &#8216;elephant in the room&rsquo; is IQ, IQ, IQ (did I mention IQ?) and the fact that those who point out IQ differences between the races (Murray, Lynn and Rushton) are axiomatically called Nazis and racists, dismissed, scorned, attacked physically, shouted down  &mdash;  when it is with them that the answer lies.  Until IQ differences are respected as the FACT that they are, there will be no &#8216;fixing&rsquo; government education.  </p>
<p>No amount of money will &#8216;fix&rsquo; or raise IQ scores.</p>
<p>Ruston reports:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;There are large inequalities in average IQ scores between groups. Herrnstein and Murray&rsquo;s (1994) The Bell Curve reported that the average IQ for &#8216;African&rsquo; Americans is lower than those for &#8216;Latino&rsquo;, &#8216;White&rsquo;, &#8216;East Asian&rsquo;, and &#8216;Jewish&rsquo; Americans (IQs = 85, 89, 103, 106, and 115, respectively, pp. 273-278)&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>https://www.vdare.com/rushton/070926_indians.htm</p>
<p>Tell me, Mr. Press, what is the best way to educate those with  average IQs of 85 or even 90?  </p>
<p>I have been inside the government educational system for over two decades now  &mdash;  I have witnessed every single new, improved theory  &mdash;   ever year there is  a new &#8216;One that will Once And For All&rsquo; erase the achievement gap between NAMs and blacks/hispanics.  The newest proposals claim to be &#8216;brain-based&rsquo; with VERY little empirical evidence to support them.  And what on earth does &#8216;brain-based&rsquo; mean?</p>
<p>Each and every theory. Let Me Repeat:  EACH AND EVERY educational theory that has been implemented over the past 40 years (at the cost of trillions of dollars) has been tried and failed miserably because the &#8216;researchers&rsquo; utterly refuse to recognize that there are intractable IQ differences between the races.</p>
<p>Until the findings of Murray, Lynn, Rushton are recognized as the facts they are, the insanity will continue ad infinitum.</p>
<p>Murray writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; The schools try to teach everyone, but some kids can&rsquo;t handle the material. That&rsquo;s just the way the things are; it is not a problem that can be fixed&hellip;No Child Left Behind has been not just a failure for educational romanticism, but its repudiation&hellip;.the [achievement] gaps have stayed the same or even grown larger since 2002&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>If anything, it is the high achieving White/Asian  &mdash;  hell ANY White/Asian kid  &mdash;  students who are losing as the educational theorists twist themselves into pretzels trying to work around IQ differences, dumbing down the curriculum and achievement tests as a result, and aiming always to placate the leftist government and black activists.</p>
<p>Why do you think I keep telling people on this board to get their kids out of the &#8216;system&rsquo;, do it now and do not look back?</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>Five More Years and I will be off of the insane, endless mobius strip.</p>

		<p>I noticed this man before, for some stupid article. It led to that sill website, Diversity inc. What a goofy man  &mdash;  and I don&rsquo;t use that word lightly. He was counseling a white woman who come with tales of being unhappy about some blacks in the workplace. Haven&rsquo;t we all? I mean, is the Pope Catholic? She wasn&rsquo;t using epithets just explaing some situation that sounded pretty credible and something I&rsquo;ve often experienced myself. Know what Visconti said, something to the effect that she was lucky he wasn&rsquo;t going to report her. Report her to whom, I forget. The thought police? The PC squad? I think he was going to make her plaints public and thus expose her to the torment that blacks in the workplace do so well. Yet there were many accounts of blacks complaining about whites, and they seemed to be allowed to do it.<br>
 This was so demented that I realized it is true  &mdash;  extreme and persistant advocacy for another race than your own will lead to idiocy and mental illness. It works too much against the survival instinct. It is one thing to try and be fair and see both points of view. But that was not the message. This man is seriously wrong. He just sounds so wrong.</p>

<p>Of course!  Their basic premise is flawed, so they will  NEVER get the &#8220;right&#8221; answer.  </p>
<p>This is pathetic, but also risible. In many ways this wrangling reminds one of theologians in the Middle Ages when the Church controlled (and defined) all acceptable debate.   Certain basic tenets   &mdash;    the Virgin Birth, the Holy Trinity, for examples   &mdash;   simply could not be doubted.  They were beyond questioning.   Thus, you would have conclaves of scholars  debating theological fine points and they, somehow, had to avoid these theological non sequiturs.  This necessitated all sorts of philosophical contortions in order to avoid the awkward spots and MAKE things fit    &mdash;   as they were theoretically supposed to fit.   If they still didn&rsquo;t fit, then something must be wrong with your logic, said the Church, so go back and try over.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not all that much different today. Instead of arguing about transubstantiation and angels, we&rsquo;re arguing about  test scores and pupils. Instead of placating Rome or the Inquisition, we&rsquo;re placating  black  activists and Washington.   But the  basic assumptions  (the tenets of the creed)  still cannot be questioned.  To do so risks excommunication and official ruin.   </p>
<p>So, you have to MAKE the answers fit.  It&rsquo;s like having to make  five and five equal twelve.    (What an awful job to have!)</p>
