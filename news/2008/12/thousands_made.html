			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, December 17, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Strong evidence has emerged of children and adults being used as slaves in Sudan&rsquo;s Darfur region, a study says.</p>
<p>Kidnapped men have been forced to work on farmland controlled by Janjaweed militias, a coalition of African charities says.</p>
<p>Eyewitnesses also say the Sudanese army has been involved in abducting women and children to be sex slaves and domestic staff for troops in Khartoum.</p>
<p>But Khartoum said the report was &#8220;very naive&#8221; and called the authors ignorant.</p>
<p>&#8220;The government does not condone abductions and it is not government policy,&#8221; a government spokesman told the BBC.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are working hard to stop such violations. The rebel factions are mostly to blame for abductions in Darfur.&#8221;</p>
<p>Up to 300,000 people have died since conflict began in Darfur in 2003 and at least 2.7 million people have fled their homes.</p>
<p>Thousands of people from non-Arabic speaking ethnic groups in Darfur have been targeted, says the report, published by the Darfur Consortium on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The group of 50 charities says it has around 100 eyewitness accounts from former abductees.</p>
<p>Victims have been rounded up during joint attacks on villages by the Arabic-speaking Janjaweed and the Sudanese Armed Forces, according to the study.</p>
<p>Civilians are also tortured and killed while their villages are razed to ethnically cleanse areas, which are then repopulated with Arabic-speaking people, including nomads from Chad, Niger, Mali and Cameroon, it says.</p>
<p>Most of the abductees are women and girls, but there is new evidence in Darfur of kidnappers targeting men and boys for forced agricultural labour, says the report.</p>
<p>The abducted women and girls, meanwhile, are raped and forced to marry their captors as well as carry out household chores and sometimes cultivate crops, according to the study.</p>
<p><b>&lsquo;Regular beatings&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>The report includes the testimony of children forced to become domestic workers.</p>
<p>One boy said he had suffered regular beatings from his Janjaweed abductors.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were treating me and the other boys very badly, they kept telling us that we are not human beings and we are here to serve them, I also worked on their farms,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>A woman said she was kidnapped from a refugee camp and her captors &#8220;used us like their wives in the night and during the day we worked all the time.</p>
<p>&#8220;The men they abducted with us were used to look after their livestock. We worked all day, all week with no rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sudan&rsquo;s government has always denied the existence of slavery in the country, although Khartoum has previously admitted abductions occurred in the north-south civil war of 1983-2005, when up to 14,000 people were kidnapped.</p>
<p>But a senior Sudanese politician who did not wanted to be named said kidnappings had also occurred more recently in Darfur.</p>
<p>&#8220;The army captured many children and women hiding in the bush outside burnt villages,&#8221; he told the report&rsquo;s authors.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were transported by plane to Khartoum at night and divided up among soldiers as domestic workers and, in some cases, wives.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Call to action</b></p>
<p>The report urged Sudan&rsquo;s government to disband the Janjaweed and other militia and to fully co-operate with the United Nations and the African Union.</p>
<p>Dismas Nkunda, co-chair of the Darfur Consortium, said: &#8220;Urgent action is clearly required to prevent further abductions and associated human rights violations, and to release and assist those who are still being held.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study also calls for the mandate of the joint United Nations-African Union peacekeeping force in Darfur (Unamid) to be beefed up so it can use force to protect civilians.</p>
<p>The Darfur Consortium also wants Khartoum to prosecute all those responsible for abductions and ban them from holding public office. It notes that no-one has ever been arrested over the wave of kidnappings.<br>

		<p>Does anyone seriously expect the United Nations or the African Union to do anything about Darfur? The African Union does not interfere in the internal affairs of one of its member states, and the United Nations has shown itself to be impotent in places like Haiti, Congo and Somalia.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad the Darfur bongo party is finally being shown as a Bantu on Bantu conflict - the Crips Sudan vs. the Bloods Sudan - instead of the erroneous Bantu vs. Arab conflict. Bantus blame the Arabs and/or the Chinese for the Darfur bongo party; indeed, everyone but themselves.</p>
<p>No aid to Sudan. Let the country stew in its own juice.  </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad someone else has noticed the blatant lie, often pushed by Big Media, that the Darfur Conflict is &#8220;Sudanese Arabs versus Sudanese Blacks&#8221;:<br>
Claiming the arabised/arabic-speaking north Sudanese as &#8220;Arabs&#8221; is as foolish as claiming that a tribe of Britons in Roman Britannia warring on a tribe of Caledonians would be &#8220;Romans versus Caledonians&#8221;.</p>
<p>On the positive side, I&rsquo;m quite happy that the Darfur Conflict cannot be blamed on &#8220;the effects of European colonialism/racism&#8221;, or &#8220;driven by &#8216;Western&rsquo; (i.e. white) greed for resource X&#8221;.</p>

		<p>As much as African Americans still love to talk about slavery that ended over 140 years ago in America, they remain indifferent about what is going on in Africa today, or of the fact that blacks are still keeping other blacks as slaves. When they do discuss the matter, nearly all of them try and insist the victims are black Sudanese people, while insisting the Janjaweed are Arabs. The Janjaweed have coal black skin, no different from any other Sudanese people. Yet AA&rsquo;s refuse to acknowledge they are black, and will often state that Arabs are raping and killing the black people of Sudan. They do not want to own up to the fact that their own people are guilty of such deeds. Most want to make slavery out to be a white sin, or an Arab sin, never ever a black sin. Often they remind me of ostriches with their heads in the sand.</p>

		<p>This has being going on for centuries. It&rsquo;s just that we, as outsiders, were not around to record it, worry about it or pretend we could overcome this long standing islamic slave trade. In any case, what possible action could the West take? Everyone involved, except the victims, are complicit no matter what they say publicly. Men are uniformed government troops one day roaring around in 4x4 &#8216;technicals&rsquo; and arab garbed horse mounted janjaweed the next. There is a noticable silence on the part of the usual noisy black-african self-interest political groups in UK/USA, but lets be honest, they have no axe to grind regarding these events in africa, miles away from the comfortable welfare cushion they rest on in the West. Perhaps an influential group would like to organise themselves (LOL) and visit dafur to talk to their &#8216;brothers&rsquo; there and advise them to desist. After all, they are continually banging on about slavery. No White need be in attendance, there are sufficient black activists to make up quite a party. Mayhaps some may even return unscathed. Betcha none go, thats a million zim bucks to a good old English penny.</p>

		<p>Slavery was a horrendous wrong in our country&rsquo;s history, but at least when America had slavery, abolitionists, both Southerners and Northerners, actively spoke out against and opposed it.  White people even helped slaves to escape and obtain their freedom in other ways.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no abolitionst movement in Sudan, or any other part of Africa.</p>
<p>If the African-American community were to truly honor the memory of Frederick Douglas, Harriett Tubman, John Brown, and other American abolitionists, the best thing to do would be to stop complaining about slavery in  America&rsquo;s past and openly protest against the slavery taking place today in Darfur, Sudan, and throughout the rest of Africa.</p>
<p>Ironically, hate mongers like Louis Farrakahn are often best buddies with the leaders of these same Muslim and African countries that still enslave native African blacks today, in even worse conditions, than what American blacks had to endure in the the slavery our country&rsquo;s past!</p>

		<p>The whole thing with the Sudan was always about slavery, The Arab portion of the population has enslaved the black animist/Christian segment of the population for years. That was the whole thing with Gordon during the time of the Mahdi. Gordon wanted the Arabs to give up the slave trade and the Arabs weren&rsquo;t having any of it.</p>
<p>Just leave these peple alone to go about their business in peace, or anyother way they want. It&rsquo;s not our affair.</p>

		<p>I note the article mentions &#8220;Arabic-speaking ethnic tribes&#8221; are selling the Darfur Bantus into slavery. That&rsquo;s quite a difference from the way the conflict has heretofor been portrayed. The way they talked about the troubles, one could picture Arab horsemen wielding swords and hacking men, women and children cowering in their dusty villages. It was always Arabs (with the Chinese lurking in the background) committing the atrocities against helpless coal-black Bantus.</p>
<p>Now, a different picture emerges. It&rsquo;s Bantu against Bantu - and it seems to depend on the language spoken by the attackers. An &#8220;Arabic-speaking&#8221; Sudanese tribe is no more Arab, than a Portuguese-speaking Angolan Bantu is Portuguese. The Arabs and/or Chinese are not responsible for this bongo party.</p>
<p>To flyingtiger:</p>
<p>George Clooney should take Susan Sarandon with him. To hear her tell it, on those late-night PSA&rsquo;s regarding Darfur designed toi stir up white guilt; it&rsquo;s a matter of Bantu women being raped in Darfur, and nothing more.</p>
<p>No aid to Sudan. Let Sudan stew in its own juice. <br>

		<p>The Arab / black African ethnic fault line has seen racial tensions and enslavement for many centuries. &#8220;Slave&#8221; is the common term in Arab countries for blacks. Osama Bin Laden for example, uses the term frequently in his announcements. Saudi Arabia didn&rsquo;t even officially outlaw black slavery until 1962. Arabs have a deep disdain for black Africans. Makes you wonder why so many black Americans convert to Islam - essentialy a 7th century Arab desert religion that borrows heavily on Judaism and Christianity (I guess they think Islam is an &#8220;African&#8221; religion.) In any case the West would be wise to stay out of this mess altogether.</p>

<p>This is true, real Arab muslims really do dislike blacks in general, black Africans even more and American blacks worst of all. So I too, am bemused by the overall attraction of the muslim faith by the blacks in America. I think it is just another way to get at whites.</p>

<p>Real Muslims also dislike Black American muslims, since most are a part of of NOI, which is really more about black supremacy, and teaches them that Mohammad was in fact a black man. On the other hand, it is true, that many blacks are extremely attracted to Arabs. And not just black men, but black women as well. Not long ago, I was on another site reading a incredibly long thread, where black women were just swooning over Arab men, and discussing the idea of marriage between black women and Arab men. Saying they viewed them as good looking, wealthy, and strong, take charge types. Some how they have it in their heads, that because Islam is open to all races, that most of it&rsquo;s followers are also open to marrying outside their race. Never mind the fact that, you almost never see an Arab paired up with a black person. It&rsquo;s a fantasy most of them enjoy. And most of them also like to believe that Arabs have a deep hatred for white westerners, so you are right, that a part of it is about getting back at whites.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Slavery was a horrendous wrong in our country&rsquo;s history&hellip;&#8221;<br>
Posted by Ross</p>
<p>Slavery was not illegal, and it was not recognized as anything &#8220;WRONG&#8221; at that time   &mdash;   not even by most of the world&rsquo;s major religions.(I can only think of Quakers who opposed it.)  It was very commonly practiced in many parts of the world, by many peoples, just as it had been for thousands of years. It is even recognized, and not denounced or condemned, by the Bible and the Koran.</p>
<p>However, I will heartily agree that it was a horrendous MISTAKE.  A mistake for which we are still paying and paying, with no end anywhere in sight.</p>

		<p>Funny, when Blacks and muslims are enslaving other Blacks or non-muslims, you don&rsquo;t hear a word from the media. Imagine if Whites were enslaving Blacks or christians enslaving muslims, the american news media would be reporting it night and day, people would be going over their to help etc. etc.</p>
