			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Valerie Richardson, Washington Times, December 27, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A [University of Denver] committee gave the final axing in October to &#8220;Denver Boone,&#8221; better known as Boone, a portly, chubby-cheeked cartoon character in a coonskin cap who represented the University of Denver Pioneers from 1968 to 1998.</p>
<p>&#8220;The old Boone figure is one that does not reflect the broad diversity of the DU community and is not an image that many of today&rsquo;s women, persons of color, international students and faculty and others can easily relate to as defining the pioneering spirit,&#8221; Chancellor Robert Coombe said.</p>
<p>Boone, drawn by Walt Disney in 1968, was shelved in 1998 for his &#8220;lack of gender inclusiveness and the changing image of the university,&#8221; according to the student newspaper, the Clarion.</p>
<p>Students and alumni have lobbied to bring back Boone ever since. A university survey taken earlier this year in response to a resurgent &#8220;bring back Boone&#8221; movement showed that 87 percent of student and alumni respondents held a favorable opinion of the pudgy pioneer and wanted to see his return.</p>
<p>The university put the mascot question last year before its History and Traditions Task Force, which decided to shelve Boone permanently after critics argued that he represented an era of Western imperialism and was offensive to women and minority groups.</p>

<p>Was the era Denver Boone represents the era where the United States enforced the Monroe Doctrine, and where it was the main inspiration for freedom and independence movements across the globe? Just like crime, sounds like the History and Traditions Task Force has been coloring their history lessons. At least, if the very members of the History task force of all people have such a skewed and dare I say backward view of history. I wonder what the true value of a degree at the University of Denver is really worth?</p>

<p>Take heart my friends here at AR, because such desperate actions only indicate to me that the other side has come to the understanding that they have lost. The understanding that not only have they lost, but also that when the day of reckoning comes, their lives will be reduced to less than that of the mascot Boone&rsquo;s current gulag status. </p>
<p>They have everything they could possibly want now, a mulatto General Secretary-elect of the Utopian States of America, so why not allow a small concession to others here?</p>
<p>Why indeed?</p>
<p>Because they can&rsquo;t; forever are they trapped in a fantasy of persecution that allows them to murder Czars and whole civilizations alike, and with impunity.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t just about &#8220;doing the right thing,&#8221; it is about justifying their own irrationality to a maximum; never forget this, that is the enemy we face. </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>The school should adopt a triple mascot: a butch-looking, angry white feminist standing next to an affirmative-action type black woman with a scowl on her face along with a meek looking submissive white guy in the background.  That would, in fact,  represent the University as it is today.</p>

<p>Who says multiculturalism and democracy go hand-in-hand? They don&rsquo;t at Denver U.</p>
<p>To Honest to Goodness race mixer:</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that the U. of Denver is all that prestigious. They&rsquo;re noted for having a decent ice hockey program, but that&rsquo;s about all. Students who can&rsquo;t get into Colorado, or Colorado State, go to U. of Denver.</p>

<p>Apparently these people don&rsquo;t even know what democracy is. Apparently, to the modern liberal mind, democracy, freedom, independence, humans rights and the very real sacrifices Americans made to bring these then unknowns into being - not just in the Western Hemisphere but all across the globe, these are all things Americans should now apologize for. Or, if the subject must be discussed (as an unavoidable necessity), these sacrifices should be down played or obscured, even ignored.</p>

		<p>This is a trend in America that will only get worse as the demographics change.  We will get to the point where even corporate logos won&rsquo;t be immune.  Brawny Paper Towels replaced their blue eyed blond haired lumberjack with a dark hispanized looking man.  Eventually, the Colonel Sanders face will either disappear altogether or the facial features and skin tone will be altered to reflect a different ethnicity.  Same with the Wendy&rsquo;s girl, black skin, corn rows and big brown bug eyes.</p>

<p>I agree. My wallet has been closed to my college and grad school for over a decade due to their diversity kick. It will not reopen. Let them collect their funds from Blacks and others.</p>
<p>The Liberal academian Robert Putnam nailed it last year when he wrote about how society closes down in the presence of multiculturalism. Consider me and my wife closed.</p>
<p>I also stopped tipping about a year ago. Many foreign cultures do not tip and in others, tipping is considered offensive. Since he U.S. has become a multicultural mecca, with foreigners constantly offended by everything, why risk it? Consider my behavior part of our devolving society. Why should I stand alone and hold up our customs? Ergo, no more tips.</p>
<p>BTW, my wife and I were donating old clothes and items from our home to a local Christian ministry, with a 100 percent White congregation and a Conservative pastor. The place is registered as an authorized IRS tax writeoff location. We also thought it was a pretty safe bet for keeping our donations in the hands of other Whites. Then, we learned that the pastor&rsquo;s teenage daughter disgraced her family by dating a much older Black man and carrying his illegitimate baby. We turned off our donations immediately and permanantly in disgust.</p>
<p>Who can be trusted these days? Very few and I do not have time to seek them out.<br>

		<p>This reminds me of the cystic fibrosis story from that school up in Kanada. A tiny faction (largely self loathing whites no doubt) at a 3rd rate &#8220;university&#8221; tries to impose an extreme PC decree on the rest of the campus. </p>
<p>If 87% do indeed wish to retain good ol&rsquo; Denver Boone, then this should be protested and overturned.</p>

Now stop sending any money to these schools.  Vote against anyone who supports any funding for this so-called university.  Send you kids to school elsewhere.  Consider sending them overseas.

		<p>I saw people on here say the american experiment has failed. The experiment worked as long as it was majority white and christian. The reason why it is failing is because they changed the experiment in 1965. The constitution was written for the most part by white english speaking  christians for white english speaking christians. I agree with all the comments here and hope i don,t start too many arguments but thats my opinion.</p>

<p>Actually, the University of California at Santa Cruz found the perfect mascot guaranteed to offend no one.</p>
<p>Their mascot is the banana slug.  </p>
<p>This is a slug indigenous to rainy, damp, chilly Northern California.  It&rsquo;s color is bright yellow.  It is slightly curved like a banana.  It is about the size of a banana.  During rainy season, they grow longer and thicker because they absorb water like a sponge. </p>
<p>If you catch one during the summer and put it on a black asphalt driveway it will shrivel, shrink and die in a few hours. It&rsquo;s kind of a vampire as it cannot survive in sun and heat. If you cut one in half, both halves will live. They are wonderful play things.</p>
<p>The University picked the banana slug because it is transgendered. It has both male and female parts and can reproduce without a partner. I believe the Lesbian, gay, transgendered, confused, bisexuals and lunatic fringe groups picked this mascot.</p>
<p>This is also the &#8220;University&#8221; where Angela Davis recently retired as vice president.  Angela Davis is the communist party member, raised by communist members of the Quaker religion who was the terririst who purchased the guns used to murder 11 people at the infamous Marin County Courthouse shoot out in the late sixties.</p>
<p>Even before she got out of jail she was inundated with offers of well paid professorships and administrative jobs at many universities. The perfect affirmative action pick, black, female, communist, terrorist.  Were she lesbian, the liberals would have made her governor of California.</p>

		<p>As an alumni of the University of Denver this sickens me beyond belief. I attended while Boone was the mascot and you certainly never heard any complaining, in fact he was well liked.  They then removed Boone and came up with a silly eagle mascot (which lasted about 9 years), which had nothing to do with a Pioneer which is what ironically DU&rsquo;s name is!  This, again, is probably the case of 1 or 2 people &#8216;complaining&rsquo; in a school of 10,000 students. There certainly wasn&rsquo;t a vote or anything mentioned in the alumni news, as usual this is done subversively by the hands of a few liberal elites. I used to be an active $$ supporter of the school, but not any longer. </p>
