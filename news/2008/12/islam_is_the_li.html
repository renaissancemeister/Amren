<h1>&#8220;Islam Is the Light&#8221; May Be Woman&rsquo;s Voice</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Moms Ask Mattel for Accountability, December 2, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More audio research keeps coming in &mdash; this just arrived this afternoon from Randall Rathbun, who describes his experiment below in his email. Rathbun write that he is an aerospace engineer with a focus on software development. He sent this audio file which slows down the audio file posted at Mattel&rsquo;s corporate website, and it certainly sounds like a woman&rsquo;s voice was recorded for the audio, and this corroborates Fred Taub&rsquo;s findings here. Randall describes his experiment with the audio in his emails:<blockquote>I slowed the whole recording down to the following 3 ranges: a man&rsquo;s voice, a woman&rsquo;s voice and a child&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>I then listened carefully, playing each several times for subtle nuances. The child&rsquo;s voice wasn&rsquo;t quite right, there was too much articulation for a normal child to master. The man&rsquo;s voice didn&rsquo;t sound right, the timbre quality or resonances did not fit or sound right, but when I played the woman&rsquo;s voice the first time, it was an uncanny match.</p>
<p>I would like to urge you to please listen to my whole version of this, if you have the time, and possibly post it so others can hear and decide for themselves.</p>
<p>&hellip; It was from a recording titled &#8220;Lil_Mommie_Coo_Original_10K.mp3Ã†&#8221;and I used the Windows version of Audacity Sound Editor to slow the speed from 44.1K to 31K and convert the file from mp3 to a wav file&hellip;&nbsp;.</blockquote>Randall just sent a slowed down version of the audio recorded by Scott Grayban from an actual doll: You can hear that here for comparison: https://www.labelthatdoll.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/scott_grayban_my-sound_slowed_by_rathbun.wav</p>

		<p>Hmmm, yeah, it sounds like &#8220;Islam is the light&#8221; but I would have to hear the whole thing to come to a conclusion. I remember the whole &#8220;backward masking&#8221; craze of the past, e.g. &#8220;Another one Bites the Dust&#8221; was supposed to contain the phrase &#8220;decide to smoke marijuana&#8221; (and it did sound like it). If you look hard enough you can find sinister things almost anywhere.</p>

		<p>If I told a Muslim that I was interested in Islam and what did &#8216;Islam is the light&rsquo; actually mean to them, I wonder what they would say. I doubt it would be very convincing with anything to back up their explanation. </p>
<p>We need to teach children to play a good offense/defense to refute all that will be thrown their way. </p>

		<p>That this was accidental is absurd. The first thing that came to my mind was &#8220;Islam is the light&#8221;; the first thing that came to the minds of the people in the YouTube video linked to in the article was &#8220;Islam is the light&#8221;; anybody with ears will hear &#8220;Islam is the light&#8221;. And someone would expect me to believe that there was no quality control, no subjection of the doll to someone before it was produced, that would have, had the phrase truly been an accident, instantly prompted its correction?</p>
<p>What does this mean? Are the corporations in on the mess of this age to such a degree? Or is it something petty, like a mad coworker deciding to sink the job of a superior, or a rival company getting someone hired at Mattel to damage them?</p>

<p>A quick skim of some of the comments on the video, too:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;ITS A BABY DOLL. Thank goodness the little girl is using her head unlike her mom.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;What a awful news story. She reports that the doll is spreading hate? Saying something about Islam is now considered hateful?&#8221;</i></p>
<p>If we had smilelys, and we had the roll eye smiley, I&rsquo;d be using it here.<br>

		<p>The founder of Mattel, Ruth Handler, was Jewish. They also came out with a Hasidic Barbie in 2004. I find it a bit hard to believe Mattel now has a &#8220;secret Muslim agenda&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t kid yourselves that mattel wouldn&rsquo;t make such a doll. Those business whores will do anything for a buck!! But they will probably only make them in china!</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t like Muslims any better than anyone else,  I also have remarkably good hearing for my age.  If I FORCE myself to wrap my mind around that phrase, I can almost, kinda sorta hear it.  To my ear, it is some baby-talk gibberish that ends with a hard pronunciation of the &#8220;T&#8221; sound.</p>
<p>Someone mentioned backward masking. Limbaugh&rsquo;s stunt with a Slim Whitman record shows how gullible people can be.  In another instance, a man &#8220;ear-banged&#8221; a crowd into hearing a satanic message in some sounds he kept playing backwards over and over again.  When he finally played the recording the right way around, it turned out to be Bing Crosby singing &#8220;White Christmas&#8221;.</p>
<p>I may be wrong. I repeat, I may be wrong, but&hellip; I think you&rsquo;ve been had.</p>
