			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Boston Globe and AP, December 4, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Bill Richardson, announced yesterday as the nation&rsquo;s next commerce secretary, became the first Latino nominated for President-elect Barack Obama&rsquo;s Cabinet.</p>
<p>Hispanic lawmakers are serving notice to Obama that they don&rsquo;t want Richardson to be the last.</p>
<p>The Congressional Hispanic Caucus delivered a letter Tuesday to Obama&rsquo;s transition office recommending a slate of 14 Hispanics for the remaining eight Cabinet slots. &#8220;We understand that the incoming administration will have a vast pool of talent from which to choose,&#8221; the letter said. &#8220;The individuals we have endorsed constitute the best talent while reflecting the diversity that is so valued by President-elect Obama.&#8221;</p>
<p>The group&rsquo;s chairman, Representative Joe Baca of California, warned that Obama&rsquo;s agenda could be jeopardized if he doesn&rsquo;t nominate more Latinos. &#8220;If it&rsquo;s just one, he&rsquo;s going to have to answer to a lot of the issues that come before us,&#8221; Baca told Bloomberg.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There were reports yesterday that Representative Xavier Becerra, a California Democrat, has emerged as a leading contender to become US trade representative. Becerra, a proponent of labor protections in free trade pacts, has been in Congress since 1993 and is on the House Ways and Means Committee.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Richardson, 61, the governor of New Mexico, served in the Clinton administration as energy secretary and ambassador to the United Nations. But after he dropped out of the Democratic nomination fight, he endorsed Obama.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Speaking in Spanish to thank Latinos for supporting him and Obama, Richardson noted that he is the third former competitor for the Democratic nomination &mdash; after Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton &mdash; to join Obama&rsquo;s administration.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Congressional Hispanic Caucus wants Obama to pick more Hispanics.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then out of the other side of their mouths they said we should look at the US population without regard to race, because we should be a colorblind society.</p>
<p>Are these liberal whites so foolish or so dense they can&rsquo;t see the hypocrisy of all non-whites?</p>

<p>Laughing out loud in utter abject disgust!</p>
<p>Has anyone informed Comrade Baca(even General Secretary-elect BO himself)that those 14 Cabinet slots do not include and never have, US Departments of: Lettuce Picking, Drunk Driving Homicides, Reconquista, or Lawn Care? </p>
<p>Apparently not!</p>
<p>Here we have yet another example of why General Secretary-elect BO is doomed to failure; he just can&rsquo;t deliver all the &#8220;hope&#8221; and &#8220;change&#8221; he promised, and survive. That &#8220;hope&#8221; and &#8220;change&#8221; was never articulated beyond nebulous gibberish in the campaign and all it really meant to him was winning and kicking the Republicans out of the White House. Now that he has done this, he must &#8220;govern&#8221; the country, end of story.</p>
<p>He knows, deep down, that he isn&rsquo;t fit to sit behind the desk he will soon occupy in the Oval Office; he knows that only so many &#8220;special&#8221; interests can be appeased with appointments, or else he will find his &#8220;presidency&#8221; in a shambles. Unfortunately for him, his party is nothing but a cacophony of such &#8220;special&#8221; interests. That is his greatest problem.</p>
<p>Too bad for him, that he can never really trust the Clintons; I am sure they would tell him how to deal with such problems.</p>
<p>Find the dirt and Barackmail or Obamaliterate them with it, you fool; you are now the president and are enjoying a honeymoon with the press. Do not let these &#8220;Latino&#8221; invaders or any of the other &#8220;aligned&#8221; misfits do to you, what they do best, destroy things.</p>
<p>The main things here being, you and your &#8220;presidency&#8221; specifically General Secretary-elect BO!</p>
<p>Or as the Little Rock Hamlet might put it, &#8220;to be or not to be, it is all a question of bamboozling and beguiling the media and appeasing Hillary.&#8221; </p>
<p>Nothing else matters</p>

<p>John, I&rsquo;m glad you brought up the issue of the Clintons presence in the Obama administration. These two snakes were in blitzkreig mode against Obama,while Hillary was still trying to win. Yet, now, according to Hillary, he is the man. I remember Bill Clintons comment on how Obama will have to kiss his ass, if he expects any help from him. One can only imagine the constant backstabbing of Obama, as the Clintons seek to accumulate little advantages until the time is ripe for a run by Hillary. What a circus the next four years is going to be, unless these geniuses get us all blown up .</p>

		<p>Obama&rsquo;s situation is starting to look like Robert Redford&rsquo;s, in the movie &#8220;The Candidate (1972).&#8221;  Redford portrayed a naive, idealistic type named Bill McKay, who, from out of nowhere wins a California  U.S. Senate seat. On election night, when the results come in, and he&rsquo;s declared the winner, he turns to his campaign manager (played by Peter Boyle) and says, &#8220;What do we do now&#8221;? </p>

		<p>And this is just the beginning. In 2100, Hispanics will be more than 50% of the U.S. population. The U.S. will be officially considered a Latin American country.</p>

		<p>You can bet Obama will grant amnesty to the millions of &#8220;undocumented citizens&#8221; in coming days.  This will destroy white conservatism in America and turn Texas into a blue state immediately.  It doesn&rsquo;t look like we will see a white presidential candidate in either party ever again in America.</p>

		<p>I certainly got a chuckle out of this article. Just wondering, when, if ever, the average unskilled, under-educated Blacks will catch on to the idea the Hispanic illegals are forcing them all out of the low-end job market. Then again, maybe those Blacks are also too dull-minded to care. Figuring Saint Obama will ensure each and everyone will get a fat welfare check, courtesy of the American taxpayers.</p>

<p>At least if Obama appoints hhispanics things have a fairly good chance of functioning smoothly. What would be the chances of that if he appointed only blacks?</p>

<p>He put Hillary right where he need to put her to keep her from causing him trouble in the senate. As Secretary of State she is answerable and accountable to him and he controls where she goes and what she does and **GASP** what she says.</p>

		<p>Regarding the comment about blacks being forced from the low end job market: You bet it&rsquo;s happening. Many black business owners I know hire mostly Latinos. They say about the only problem regarding Latinos is to get them to quit working after 12 hrs. Now this is funny, blacks refusing to hire blacks for reasons we all know.</p>

<p>A lot of those blacks have already dropped out of the low-end job market to become habitual &#8220;clients&#8221; of our criminal justice system.  Maybe that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re not particularly concerned with the wave of Mexicans entering the work force.</p>

		<p>2:00PM on December6,  &#8220;They say the only problem regarding Lationos is to get them to quit working after 12 hrs.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was a load crew boss for a large warehouse for a number of years as well as having worked in my younger days in meatpacking. While there are latinos who work diligently on the job, I have worked with an equal amount of them that tried to slack off every chance they got. I&rsquo;d find them in the restroom for a half hour, overstaying the lunch break,etc. </p>
<p>Another aspect to the famed latino work ethic is that the longer they are on a job, the more the tend to goof off. I&rsquo;ve always been amused by those people who get all wide eyed when they talk about how hard Mexicans, for example work. Huh! Mowing lawns? Painting? Trimming hedges? Roofing? I remember a time not that long ago, that seventy year old Japanese people, in the area I grew at,did the gardening and lawn work. Not only was their work infinitely superior to the work of illegal aliens, but they really weren&rsquo;t that expensive to employ.</p>
<p>In the same way whites did roofing in Southern California, not that long ago, and they did it well. I can vouch that prices have NOT GONE DOWN, because illegal aliens now do roofing. I have concluded that those whites for example,or others, who are convinced about how hard Mexicans, etc. work, have never done an honest days worth of labor in their lives to even know what hard work really is. <br>
P.S. One thing I will agree on, stoop labor on farms, IS hard work. I&rsquo;ve done some on my uncles farm in Lancaster.</p>

		<p>To Bobby, regarding:</p>
<p>&#8220;One can only imagine the constant backstabbing of Obama, as the Clintons seek to accumulate little advantages until the time is ripe for a run by Hillary. What a circus the next four years is going to be, unless these geniuses get us all blown up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, I could not agree with you more sir. I despise the Clintons, but one thing that I do grudgingly respect about them, is their ability to calculate politically for their own long term strategic advantages. There is much chatter about her taking the Secretary of State job, simply to buttress her chances in 2016; I think that is a load of horse droppings and it is 2012, that she is really after. </p>
<p>Please see my next set of comments to Skip, to understand just how deeply I agree with you. </p>
<p>To Skip, regarding:</p>
<p>1.) &#8220;At least if Obama appoints hhispanics things have a fairly good chance of functioning smoothly. What would be the chances of that if he appointed only blacks?&#8221;</p>
<p>2.) &#8220;He put Hillary right where he need to put her to keep her from causing him trouble in the senate. As Secretary of State she is answerable and accountable to him and he controls where she goes and what she does and **GASP** what she says.&#8221;</p>
<p>Skip, I am just shaking my head at your two responses to my above comments; they clearly were intended to contradict/refute the points that I was making in my original post in general, but to what end? These points being that Comrade BO is beholden to &#8220;special&#8221; interests, the Clintons and &#8220;Latinos&#8221; among them, and that in the end, these will likely be his undoing.</p>
<p>Do you not understand, that we are in a sociopolitical and economic crisis for which Comrade BO is utterly unprepared to deal with? </p>
<p>Do you not understand, that the vast majority of these &#8220;undocumented&#8221;  migratory &#8220;Latinos&#8221; are not only contributing to these problems, but exacerbating them?</p>
<p>Do you not understand, that Comrade Hillary took that job as Secretary of State, simply because it will allow her considerable room to inflict a lot damage upon him and bisect the cornucopia of &#8220;special&#8221; interests that are the Democratic party, should she be fired or feel &#8220;compelled&#8221; to resign?</p>
<p>Think of the interesting scenario for 2012 that might make?</p>
<p>Just something to think about and the best to you both,</p>
<p>John PM!</p>
