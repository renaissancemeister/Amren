<h1><a href="https://www.thelocal.se/16560/20081224/">Christmas Unrest in Stockholm Suburb</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The Local (Sweden), Dec. 24, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For the second night running unrest broke out in the Stockholm suburb of Tensta. A massive police presence managed to gain control of the situation in the early hours of Christmas Eve.</p>
<p>The Local reported on Tuesday that the fire service had come under attack from stone-throwing youths in the predominantly immigrant-occupied area of Tensta in north west Stockholm on Monday evening. </p>
<p>When police units arrived at the scene youngsters were found to have set fire to car tyres, rubbish bins and a skip.</p>
<p>Jannes Hedlund at Stockholm county police described Tuesday&rsquo;s rioting as in principle a repeat of the events of the night before. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Among other things they had set fire to a skip and thrown a Molotov cocktail at a police vehicle,&rdquo; Hedlund said.</p>
<p>The police were prepared for the possibility of renewed unrest and had deployed eight specially trained units to the area. Hedlund said that he believed that similar preparations were in force for any potential trouble on Christmas Eve. </p>
<p>Several cars were also set alight in VÃ¥rberg in southern Stockholm, although local police were not connecting the incidents to the unrest in Tensta.<br>

								<h2><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7791553.stm">Swedish City Hit by Youth Riots</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>BBC News, Dec. 19, 2008</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Dozens of youths have rioted in the southern Swedish city of Malmo for a second consecutive night, setting cars on fire and clashing with police. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had a very difficult evening,&rdquo; a police spokeswoman told the AFP news agency late on Thursday. </p>
<p>&ldquo;There have been fires burning since this afternoon &hellip;  extensive damage to public property, and &hellip;  stone-throwing and bomb threats against police.&rdquo; </p>
<p>She said the trouble was linked to the closure of an Islamic centre. </p>
<p>The owner of the building, in an immigrant neighbourhood, had decided not to renew the centre&rsquo;s lease. The centre, which included a mosque, had to move out. </p>
<p>But some youths squatted in the premises, until they were evicted by police earlier this week. </p>
<p>Once police left the premises, the youths returned, setting fires in the area. They then clashed with police. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The origin of the riots is the occupation of the building. But that&rsquo;s not really the reason now, now other troublemakers have just joined in, taking advantage of the situation,&rdquo; police spokeswoman Ewa-Gun Westford told AFP. <br>

<p>Sweden is even more suicidally stupid wrt 3ird world (esp. Muslim) immigration than Britain.  The Muslim world must marvel at the sucker hearted idiocy of the foolish EU. Countries like Latvia evidently are not so stupid.  </p>

		<p>The French riots were declared over when car burning dropped below 100 a day.  I suspect the same is true with Malmo.  I came to europe to get away from PC anti-white insanity in the US only to find it is even worse over here.</p>

		<p>At the expense of beating the subject to death, I&rsquo;m going to point out that I think we&rsquo;re in the beginning stages of the violent unrest portion of the collapse of the West, and we have been now for awhile, beginning with the riots in France and other European countries earlier.</p>
<p>I hate to be redundant, but if I&rsquo;m right, or even close to right, meaning that the West might not collapse but will seriously weaken to the point of no return, then there is no subject, no event, no situation that has any meaning, because everything is null and void if the West no longer exists in its present form.  I mean of what consequence is it if the Big 3 automakers are bailed out if the country can&rsquo;t provide jobs and rioting is the order of the day, as a prelude to a worse situation?</p>
<p>Note the following headline in the UK Telegraph: </p>
<p>&#8220;Protectionist dominoes are beginning to tumble across the world&#8221;<br>
 <br>
&#8220;The riots have begun. Civil protest is breaking out in cities across Russia, China, and beyond.&#8221; <br>

<p>So far we haven&rsquo;t had the same in this country, and granted the main rioters in Europe are the blacks and Muslims, but obviously that won&rsquo;t hold if the economic situation gets worse.</p>
<p>I think the next 3 to 9 months will give us enough information to know what to expect.  That should be long enough for the messiah&rsquo;s programs to make an initial positive effect, then go downhill and create an even worse situation or pick us up to where we might be able to make a long, long recovery, but when has social spending ever improved a country that has a dwindling tax base, a falling currency, and so much foreign debt it is almost insolvent?</p>
<p> Too, we have to keep in mind that credit card defaults will be the next thing coming, plus millions of other mortgages will be slipping up into their higher adjustable rates about March.</p>
<p>Also, it has to be taken into consideration that if unemployment continues at its present rate for another six months, we&rsquo;ll be too far down to come up out of this consumer driven society in our present form as the &#8220;United&#8221; States.</p>
<p>Who is going to be prepared to feed and defend themselves if necessary?</p>
<p>Better to be prepared, even if the end result makes us look like fools, than to be unprepared and wind up as dead fools.  </p>

		<p>I finished looking over a Youtube thread about the riots in Malmo and found my blood pressure rising as one poster went on to say that Sweden today, is a dark country, and mock the fact that blue eyed blondes are becoming extinct. While also mocking the fact that Muslims are now replacing Lutherans in Nordic countries. Meantime, whites are being murdered and driven out of South Africa for not being Native to the region. Isn&rsquo;t it interesting how blacks are swarming Europe, and expecting to be welcomed with open arms, and open pocketbooks, while they practice ethnic cleansing in Africa?</p>

		<p>How sad&hellip;</p>
<p>Christmas eve in a lovely North European country and a bunch of &#8220;youths&#8221; rioting and attacking firetrucks.</p>
<p>If this is not proof that Third Worlders cannot assimilate into Western societies I do not know what is.  I recall one time while on business in Johannesburg, South Africa seeing EMTs and ambulance drivers wearing bullet-proof vests.  I asked our counterpart there why so?  To find out that they frequently get fired upon while trying to save people&rsquo;s lives in the Black townships.  How civilized&hellip;  attack the one extension of government that actually helps people in need.</p>
<p>The United States, I am sorry to say, is beyond hope.  This will become a White-minority nation within our lifetimes and will only get worse.</p>
<p>Europe, with postmodernism and millennia of ethnic squabbles, coupled with relatively small minority populations compared to the US, still has some chance.  Even if they are more ideologically &#8216;NY Times&rsquo; than Whites in the US.</p>

		<p>So high-birthrate Somalis and Kurds are turning the historic Swedish city of Malmo into a Third World hell? Good!</p>
<p>For decades the Swedish political class bankrolled the A.N.C. and the Sandanistas and the P.L.O. with Swedish taxpayers&rsquo; money.</p>
<p>The Swedish political class delighted in scolding the Americans and British and French about segregation in Dixie, white rule in Rhodesia and colonialism in Algeria - and many others sins, too - for decades.</p>
<p>Incomprehensibly, they chose to welcome the influx of the Third World with eager squeals of self-righteous and self-congratulatory delight.</p>
<p>So now - having embraced a suicidal immigration and asylum policy - the Swedes are reaping what they chose to sow and I, for one, can enjoy the spectacle with absolute equanimity and guilt-free smug satisfaction. </p>
<p>Being quietly delighted at another&rsquo;s discomfiture and distress is an ignoble pleasure but in this instance it is wholly justified.</p>

		<p>The rioters are Somali in Sweden.  The peak concentration for Somalis in the US is Minneapolis, where they commit murders at a high rate.  When Minneapolis was white, the crime rate was low.  The cause of the high crime rate now?  It&rsquo;s a mystery but clearly more outreach workers are needed.  See  the news story.    The mayor &#8220;&hellip;doesn&rsquo;t want the rash of homicides to overshadow the incredible accomplishments Somalis have achieved in Minneapolis.&#8221;   </p>
<p>No accomplishments were named.<br>

		<p>The only reason they didn&rsquo;t blame the Rodney King riots on &#8220;youths&#8221; was that they had video of the whole thing.  If somebody made a meticulous video of the entire Muslim riot mentioned in the article, they would fold and admit it was the fault of Muslims.</p>

__________</p>
<p>Yes.  Exactly.   But as you say, it was the <i> &#8220;Swedish political class&#8221; </i> that engineered this.  They have committed these  genocidal crimes <b> against their own people!   </b> They and they alone  should be held responsible. The people are victims.  I can understand your annoyance, but why rejoice in seeing the destruction of the entire Swedish nation?  They have been allowed little access to information, and no real freedom of opinion.  In effect, they have been held hostage by their own  fanatical government. Haven&rsquo;t they been victimized enough?</p>

It is the fault of the non blacks 100%, they allow it, they even encourage it.

		<p>These people are mostly Arabs and I think Iranians and Kurds, anyway, hardly any Somalis. So calling them Blacks is really way off. Just Arab Muslims rioting in White Christian Europe like they always do. Yawn.</p>
