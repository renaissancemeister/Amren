<h1>Refugees From Bhutan Settle in Pittsburgh</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ramit Plushnick-Masti, AP, November 30, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Chitra Prassad Gautam and his family watch in awe as water comes out of the shower head in the bathroom of their new apartment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a question,&#8221; Gautam says, holding up a bottle of shampoo. &#8220;Do I put this in my hair before going in the shower or after?&#8221;</p>
<p>Gautam, 19, his parents and his two siblings are among the first of about 5,300 ethnic Nepalese refugees from the tiny south Asian country of Bhutan who this year started leaving refugee camps to resettle in the United States. The U.S. has agreed to take in 60,000 of them.</p>
<p>Unlike other, high-profile refugee groups such as Iraqis and Burmese, the ethnic Nepalese have gone largely unnoticed. Since there are no Bhutanese communities in the United States, most are being resettled near cities like Pittsburgh, where housing is affordable and officials hope diverse populations will reinvigorate urban areas hurt by deindustrialization.</p>
<p>Charitable organizations responsible for resettlement get the families apartments, food, Social Security cards and English classes, and help them find jobs. After three months, the families will have to provide for themselves, usually working minimum wage jobs.</p>
<p>Bhutan is a predominantly Buddhist constitutional monarchy bordered by China and India. In the early 1990s, the monarchy instituted sweeping legislation that effectively stripped the ethnic Nepalese, a Hindu minority also known as the Lhotsampas, of their citizenship, their right to own property and their ability to get government jobs.</p>
<p>Since then, an estimated 100,000 ethnic Nepalis have fled to refugee camps.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve never seen a house like this,&#8221; Gautam said when caseworker Molly Ferra took them through the three-bedroom unit, showing them the small kitchen already furnished with bags of rice, tea, hot pepper sauce and a box of pots and pans.</p>
<p>She explained the use of the refrigerator and freezer to Gautam, the only member of the family who speaks English. &#8220;Very cold,&#8221; Gautam noted of the freezer.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of us want to return to Bhutan because we love our country and our roots,&#8221; D.P. Kafle, a resident of one of the [Nepalese refugee] camps, said in an interview in Nepal. &#8220;We are patriotic Bhutanese and there is no way we will go anywhere else.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, Larry Yungk, a senior resettlement officer with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, said 55,000 refugees from Bhutan have already signed up for relocation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;A computer, will we get a computer?&#8221; [Gautaum] asked the caseworker. &#8220;I need the Internet to send e-mail to my teacher.&#8221; &mdash; his U.N.-run school had Internet access.</p>
<p>Ferra told him the family will receive a TV but they will have to purchase their own computer. At the library, she explained, they can access the Internet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, the library,&#8221; Gautam says grinning. &#8220;My teacher told me I can get a card and use for free.&#8221;<br>

<p>This has to be the dumbest thing I have ever heard. How can people who don&rsquo;t know how to use shampoo or refrigerators reinvigorate anything?</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s time that we relocated those officials to some impoverished third world countries to invigorate THEIR communities.</p>

<p>This is PC for &#8220;officials hope immigrants desparate for affordable housing and ignorant of the criminal behavior of american blacks will move in and drive the blacks out of their ghettoes, start businesses and develop a liveable neighborhood.&#8221;</p>
<p>It worked in Los Angeles.  Whatever the faults of hispanics, they have vastly improved the old black ghetto southern sections of the city.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the marauding blacks invade and destroy crime free white suburbs with good schools when the immigrants drive them out of their city ghettoes.  Then the surburban whites move even farther out and the suburbs turn into crime ridden black ghettoes.<br>

<p>Department of State makes the decision and the arrangements. </p>
<p>There are camps in Africa where state department employees teach them such concepts as &#8220;door&#8221; that can be opened and closed rather than just an opening in a thatch hut, &#8220;latrine&#8221; rather than the back yard or wall of the hut.</p>
<p>After a month of assimilation workshops they are shipped to America, welfare payments and housing are arranged and they are here to stay.</p>
<p>The ostensible reason for all this is that once we take their unwanted populations in, the 4th and 5th world countries of the world will love and admire us and support us in the UN.</p>
<p>Hasn&rsquo;t quite worked with the Somalians.  Whoever said that the State Department civil service exam was difficult.  State department personnel are as gullible as a 6 year old with Down&rsquo;s Syndrome.  They will believe anything as long as it is anti american, anti white and politically correct.</p>

		<p>The main stream media will continue to propose that they are indeed doing you a favor while they sell out our country, community by community. The main motive of the left is to destabilize the communities to make them impotent to the ever increasing power of the left wing of the government. Pittsburgh is just too &#8220;white&#8221; is the real reason for the imposition of third world foreign unassimilatable cultures.</p>

		<p> Bhutan realizes its not a good idea to have a multicultural country and stripped the ethnic nepalese of their citizenship. First if the u.n. is involved why don,t they put them back in their own country Bhutan. This was in essence humane ethnic cleansing. Second if they are Nepalese why don,t they stay in Nepal? Third if they are Hindu why don,t they put them in India? Quote &#8220;officials hope diverse populations will invigorate urban areas hurt by deindustrialization&#8221;. Our gubmint signs free trade and sends all the jobs overseas and we are in a recession and their idea of fixing it is to bring more people into our overcrowded jobless cities. How? Why is easy, because murtha called western Pa. a redneck area so their idea is to bring the multiculturalism to this country they don,t want in Bhutan. Guess they will all get gubmint jobs in this country they can,t get in Bhutan and americans can,t get here. This story is so wrong in so many different ways but guess i,ve used up enough space. Next time you go there you can say i thought this was Pittsburgh but i can,t believe its not bhutan.</p>

		<p>&#8220;US to take in 60,000 Nepalese refugees from Bhutan.&#8221;</p>
<p>The numbers of these non-whites coming into the country are huge.  Every time this occurs, we are one step closer to complete disintegration, and contrary to what the rainbow fools believe, this is a recipe for disaster, assuring our break up along lines of race. </p>
<p>Where are all these peons going to work?  I mean, we&rsquo;re in the beginning of a severe recession that will turn into the worst depression this country has ever seen  Right now we&rsquo;re losing over a million jobs every month.  That will increase CONSIDERABLY.  Our true unemployment figures right now are about 12 to 14%, if we count those working part-time, because they can&rsquo;t find full time work. That will more than double by the end of 2009 or perhaps a bit longer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as if the people responsible for these kinds of immigration disasters think we&rsquo;re still in boom times, instead of facing what could be ten years of a general scarcity of many things, and food shortages, which will without doubt turn violent.</p>
<p>Every time we take in another large group of third worlders we pass a milestone that says we are getting closer to coming apart.</p>
<p>Anyone who doesn&rsquo;t know this is either economically naive or in a state of denial.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too late for the messiah&rsquo;s clumsy attempts to do anything but offer a temporary patch on an inner tube that is destined to explode at several different points.</p>
<p>We have to let this disaster play itself out.  It&rsquo;s beyond repair.</p>

		<p>Meanwhile, USA unemployment is soaring and expected to go even higher.  Taxes for those USA citizens who do manage to keep a job will rise as the government will need to increase spending to educate, house, feed, coddle, transport, cure, police, incarcerate, and bury our 60,000 new clueless, non-English speaking guests.  </p>
<p>They could have reduced YOUR taxes or helped YOUR family.  Instead they prefer to help foreigners over Americans.   </p>

		<p>60,000 is a lot! This is bigger than many medium-sized cities; and from a population almost unknown about. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really a wonder why we have to immigrate every non-White category possible. And then these numbers have to be as big as possible. I think this is frequently more of a self-righteous move by White &#8220;anti-racists,&#8221; than a real act of humanitarianism. </p>
<p>I am also angry that our tax dollars are being used, to provide them with free goodies, when we are in a recession (likely pre-Depression).</p>
<p>This is not the America I know. People&rsquo;s immigration desires were fairly represented; and one had to really want to be an American out of patriotism, not out of pure convenience and free rides. </p>
<p>This is our country&rsquo;s downfall; when it works to get immigrants, instead of immigrants working to (legally) get into it. :(</p>

		<p>There are only 600,000 people in the entire nation of Bhutan.  We have apparently just taken in about half of the Hindus that used to live there.  Some of the others are going to Canada.  Not all the refugees are happy, though; one aid worker remembers being asked &#8220;Is it true that Canada is so cold that you can&rsquo;t have children there, and that&rsquo;s why they want us to go there?&#8221;</p>

		<p>The insanity just never ends, another third world area of the world the idiotic US government has decided to de-populate. Why is the minute people in some part of the world meet some hardship the answer is to pack them up and ship them to the US?How is the situations in these countries ever going to change when we just gather up the population and relocate them here? And not matter what they say they are never going to go home, they will just become &#8220;proud&#8221; and &#8220;nationalistic&#8221; here. I live in Las Vegas, Nevada and I was at the DMV the other day to get a copy of my MVR and I swear besides the whites that worked there I must have one of only a handful of whites there. While waiting in line I must have heard at least three to four different languages being spoken there and I was thinking how much trouble this country is going to be in in the future. Because all these people are clanish and have nothing in common with each other.</p>

<p>They are here to work as slave labor, doing menial jobs that Blacks, Hispanics, and uneducated Whites used to perform before they became spoiled and discovered that they can avoid work, collect welfare, and claim bankruptcy at the expense of responsible people, thus never having to work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe it&rsquo;s time that we relocated those officials to some impoverished third world countries to invigorate THEIR communities.&#8221;</p>
<p>It would be better if the traitors strayed into a high-crime urban area one night and met the &#8220;enriched diversity&#8221; of a crack-crazed Black gang looking for immediate reparations and revenge.</p>

		<p>The Bhutanese Nepalis had been living in Bhutan for 100 years or more. They were as Bhutanese as your average Italian, Czech or Jew in the US. How&rsquo;s about we Anglo-Saxons strip those funny East European and Mediterranean Whites of US citizenship and send them back to where they came from.</p>
<p>The ethnic cleansing of the ethnic Nepalese was cruel and wrong. Furthermore, there was little objective basis for it, since it was carried out by a minority - the ethnic Bhutanese (whatever that is - more of an Asiatic type). Bhutan had been a multicultural country for as long as America had been a country of many types of Whites. If you&rsquo;re going to say that the minority Bhutanese had a right to kick out the majority people of the land, then the minority Anglo-Saxons need to throw the South and East Europeans out of the US.</p>
<p>What the Bhutanese did was fascism, plain and simple. Of course the Nepalese want to go back to Bhutan. Why not? Bhutan is their home, not Nepal. Like the US is the home of US Italians, not Italy. Why can&rsquo;t the Nepalese go back to Bhutan? Bhutanese won&rsquo;t let them back. </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a growing Maoist movement in those camps and they have started to wage one of their &#8220;people&rsquo;s wars&#8221; in Bhutan. It&rsquo;s only barely gotten off the ground yet, but it may just grow. They don&rsquo;t want Maoism so much as getting rid of the stupid monarchy and being allowed to go back to their homeland. You all can scoff all you want, but these same characters just more or less won in Nepal after tearing the country to shreds for a decade and leaving 13,000 dead. Bhutan excludes its own citizens at its own peril.</p>

Tribesmen. They might be prove useful as a buffer against our<br>
African Tribesmen/Gangsters. The New Guineans could fashion stone<br>
axes and spears. What&rsquo;s that funny meat they&rsquo;re barbecuing-it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be prepackaged! It would all be very amusing, at<br>
least until they started putting us in the pot. As William Blake<br>
said, &#8220;The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom.&#8221; We need<br>
to get crazier. We&rsquo;ll get to the palace eventually, assuming we<br>
survive at all, of course.</p>

<p>If the white men in Pittsburgh are like the white friends with whom I grew up here in NYC, they will soon be finding Nepalese girlfriends. It&rsquo;s appalling how many white men are willing to marry outside of their race, have nonwhite kids, and contribute to the ultimate extinction of whites. Right off the top of my head, I can rattle off eleven or twelve of my white male childhood and adolescent friends who have married nonwhites. In almost all cases they married latinas. One married a black, the other an Indian, and another a Filipina.</p>

		<p>Our government is deliberately flooding us with Third World immigrants so that we may all eventually become Third Worlders and completely dependent on our ever-increasing government.</p>
<p>This opening of borders and out-of-control Third World &#8220;immigration&#8221; (legal and illegal) is infecting most of Western society and ultimately, leading us towards a New World Order.  </p>

		<p>In poll after poll after poll, Americans say they want to reduce immigration.  Yet, our government leaders believe that they know better than our citizens.  They simply ignore the will of the MAJORITY OF THE CITIZENS, and do as they please, primarily for the greedy purpose of getting cheap labor (Republicans)or cheap votes (Democrats).  These B  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;   don&rsquo;t give a d  &mdash;  - about the suffering of the common Citizen.  They care more about foreigners than Americans.</p>
<p>Our ancestors knew that it was not only their right, but their duty to fight tyranny.  The USA is supposed to be a democracy, and it is the solemn duty of every American to assure that democracy is maintained.  Those who thwart democracy and the will of the people are traitors to the ideals of this nation.  </p>

<p>&ldquo;officials hope diverse populations will reinvigorate urban areas hurt by deindustrialization.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is PC for &ldquo;officials hope immigrants desperate for affordable housing and ignorant of the criminal behavior of American blacks will move in and drive the blacks out of their ghettos, start businesses and develop a livable neighborhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It worked in Los Angeles. Whatever the faults of Hispanics, they have vastly improved the old black ghetto southern sections of the city.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the marauding blacks invade and destroy crime free white suburbs with good schools when the immigrants drive them out of their city ghettos. Then the suburban whites move even farther out and the suburbs turn into crime ridden black ghettos.&#8221;</p>
<p> Perfectly stated&hellip; Unfortunately, I am starting to see these &#8220;marauding blacks&#8221; in my area. They have been displaced in their traditional areas by Hispanics, and are now starting to trickle into White suburbs. History has shown wherever Blacks go, the area is destroyed&hellip; it is a well known, yet well hidden fact.</p>

		<p>The Bhutanese Nepalis had been living in Bhutan for 100 years or more. They were as Bhutanese as your average Italian, Czech or Jew in the US. How&rsquo;s about we Anglo-Saxons strip those funny East European and Mediterranean Whites of US citizenship and send them back to where they came from.</p>
<p>The ethnic cleansing of the ethnic Nepalese was cruel and wrong. Furthermore, there was little objective basis for it, since it was carried out by a minority - the ethnic Bhutanese (whatever that is - more of an Asiatic type). Bhutan had been a multicultural country for as long as America had been a country of many types of Whites. If you&rsquo;re going to say that the minority Bhutanese had a right to kick out the majority people of the land, then the minority Anglo-Saxons need to throw the South and East Europeans out of the US.</p>
<p>What the Bhutanese did was fascism, plain and simple. Of course the Nepalese want to go back to Bhutan. Why not? Bhutan is their home, not Nepal. Like the US is the home of US Italians, not Italy. Why can&rsquo;t the Nepalese go back to Bhutan? Bhutanese won&rsquo;t let them back. </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a growing Maoist movement in those camps and they have started to wage one of their &#8220;people&rsquo;s wars&#8221; in Bhutan. It&rsquo;s only barely gotten off the ground yet, but it may just grow. They don&rsquo;t want Maoism so much as getting rid of the stupid monarchy and being allowed to go back to their homeland. You all can scoff all you want, but these same characters just more or less won in Nepal after tearing the country to shreds for a decade and leaving 13,000 dead. Bhutan excludes its own citizens at its own peril.</p>

		<p>I live in Sheboygan,Wi.,a city of 50,000 set on Lake Michigan. Thirty years ago this community was predominantly white european with few black or hispanic residents. In 1979 the government resettled thousands of Hmong from Laos without any input from anyone. Since then thousands more have been settled here. There has been no real assimilation whatsoever. With the exception of some of the younger generations who seem to have been &#8220;americanized&#8221; they are basically isolationists,keeping to themselves,speaking only Hmong. Along with the thousands of illegal mexicans that have come here during the last twenty five years we have gone from a united community based on race and common ancestry to a city divided into three camps. We now have over fifty gangs here,mostly mexican and Hmong,where just ten to fifteen years ago there were none. It is getting more and more dangerous with each passing year. Sheboygan is quickly going to hell. Too bad,this used to be a great place to live and raise a family. Just another gift fron Uncle Sam.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&ldquo;A computer, will we get a computer?&rdquo; [Gautaum] asked the caseworker. &ldquo;I need the Internet to send e-mail to my teacher.&rdquo; &mdash; his U.N.-run school had Internet access.</p>
<p>Ferra told him the family will receive a TV but they will have to purchase their own computer. At the library, she explained, they can access the Internet.&#8221;</p>
<p>This says it all.  They get not only free food and kitchen equipment but free TVs.  If they get free TVs they must get furntiture as well.  </p>
<p>When I worked for the welfare department years ago the receipients were given some free furniture if they had none.  But they could only buy second hand furniture.  They were allowed a bed for each person, a dining table, bureaus and dining chairs.  Couches, arm chairs TVs, stereos, and other furnture were not considered necissities.  So they had to pay for those items out of their welfare checks.</p>
<p>Think how much taxpayers money would be saved if all these free loaders were sent home and the borders were closed.<br>

<p>According to the excellent site Refugee Resettlement Watch:</p>
<p> &#8220;&hellip;It is a tangled web involving the UN, the State Department and 10 major non-profit group federal contractors and nearly 400 subcontractors.   It is a system that is frankly a morass &mdash; unfair to refugees and to the citizens of the resettlement towns and cities&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>What is the purpose of settling so many dirt-poor Third World people groups here  &mdash;  especially with rising unemployment and inflation?</p>
<p>Again, from Refugee Resettlement Watch:</p>
<p>&#8221;..In order to bring about &#8216;change&rsquo; in our form of government one needs to destabilize communities and what better way than to bring in large numbers of angry and demanding immigrants&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The site, while depressing to read, reports on the damage these refugees are causing to the US, Canada and Britain  &mdash;  reports that you&rsquo;ll never see in the MSM.</p>

		<p>The first generation of non-white immigrants to our country is often initially excited and grateful to be here and is reasonably content with a low income lifestyle, hoping that their children will grow up and achieve more.  </p>
<p>Then, when their American-born children become youths, they are filled with rage that they don&rsquo;t fit well into our (formerly) European-based culture.  They join racial gangs to feel a part of a group.  </p>
<p>When adults, being filled with racial/tribal pride for their ancestry, they will form special interest organizations to overcome white American society and to mold our culture more to their liking.  </p>
<p>By 2050 they will be indignant that there hasn&rsquo;t been a Nepalese-American president yet!  The evil white man must be holding them down!  After all, they will say, isn&rsquo;t it our turn to make history?</p>

		<p>America as it used to be is over.  A large country filled with so many incompatible ethnic groups from every part of the globe has nothing to bind it together as one people.  Each ethnic group will just go off and create its own neighborhood or even city.  </p>
<p>All we need now is to go into a Great Depression II and everything will implode.  It is really shocking that our politicians never even ask their constituents in a referendum what they think about our importing hundreds of thousands of non-Western foreigners into our cities where they will create their own ethnic enclaves forevermore.   </p>
<p>I read on another forum a post from a lady who was a young girl during the Great Depression.  She remembers seeing men in suits and white shirts looking through city trash cans for something to eat.  This was so sad, but our people were able to pull together because we were a nation with a common identity and we could trust and understand each other.   </p>
<p>Our government needs to begin immediately to address the problems the U.S. is facing rather than inviting every tribe, ethnic group and nation to come live with us.  Is this how our government tries to make the world like us?  If so, it isn&rsquo;t working!</p>

		<p><b>Furthermore, there was little objective basis for it, since it was carried out by a minority - the ethnic Bhutanese</b><br>
So they are totally primitive and partake of ethnic cleansing. Sounds like a safe group that you&rsquo;d want in your cities.</p>
<p><b>&ldquo;Most of us want to return to Bhutan because we love our country and our roots,&rdquo; D.P. Kafle, a resident of one of the [Nepalese refugee] camps, said in an interview in Nepal. &ldquo;We are patriotic Bhutanese and there is no way we will go anywhere else.&rdquo;</b><br>
This confirms what I suspected. The people do not want to leave their home. They are rounded up like bounty because the <i>volags</i> get paid by U.S. government per head. It is no different than indenturism.</p>
<p>Here is the list of the individual agencies:<br>

<p>The CEOs can make up to 200k a year.</p>
<p>This is refugee resettlement. It is a totally different animal than immigration.<br>
This year&rsquo;s quota, increased by Bush, is 90,000. <br>
Disease-ridden, illiterate and totally unsuited for this life-style we have here. It is a trauma for them as well as the communities they are dropped into.</p>
<p>It could happen in your neighborhood. The whole racket is conducted by stealth.</p>
