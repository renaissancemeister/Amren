			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chris Johnson, Daily Mail (London), December 4, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A primary school infuriated parents after cancelling the traditional Christmas nativity play to make way for the Muslim festival of Eid.</p>
<p>Parents at the Nottingham school were told that the planned performance had to be pulled because some of the pupils wanted to celebrate Eid at home with their families.</p>
<p>In a letter, sent by the staff at Greenwood Junior School, mothers and fathers were told: &lsquo;It is with much regret that we have had to cancel this year&rsquo;s Christmas performances.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is due to the Eid celebrations that take place next week and its effect on our performers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>However, following a barrage of complaints, a second letter was issued saying the show had &lsquo;not been cancelled outright&rsquo; but has been postponed until the New Year.</p>
<p>The follow-up letter, sent by headteacher Amber Latif and chair of governors Yvonne Wright, apologised for the &lsquo;misunderstanding&rsquo; caused by the first correspondence.</p>
<p>It read: &lsquo;We are a very inclusive school and fully respect the cultures and religions of all the children.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are upset to know that some of our parents/carers have been offended by the letter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Christmas performance has not been cancelled outright but has been postponed until the New Year.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mum Janette Lynch, whose seven-year-old son Keanu attends the school, said she was angered that the performance had been moved until after Christmas.</p>
<p>She said: &lsquo;The head has a whole year to plan for Eid and so she should be able to plan for both religious festivals.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have never heard of this at a school. It is the first year my son has been there and a lot of the mums like me were really looking forward to seeing the children in the nativity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think it&rsquo;s wrong it has been moved to after Christmas.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The school has also sent out a timetable of events to mark Eid ul-Adha, or &lsquo;greater Eid&rsquo;, which is the second of the two Eid festivals.</p>
<p>It lasts for two or three days and starts on Monday or Tuesday next week.</p>
<p>Muslim children will be off school for the religious holiday.</p>
<p>Sajad Hussain, 35, of who has two children at the school said: &lsquo;My children will be off for the two days next week to see their family.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s not that complicated; they could have one event on one day and another on another day, they should have both celebrations at the school.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you do not have both it becomes a racist thing and that&rsquo;s why you have to be careful if an issue is made out of it it could become nasty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Yesterday, a statement issued by the school said: &lsquo;We  would like to apologise for any confusion caused as a result of [the original]  letter we sent out and would like to reassure parents and the community that  Christmas has not been cancelled at Greenwood Junior School.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As a multi-faith school, like many schools in Nottingham City, we represent a wide variety of faiths and due respect is given to each one appropriately.</p>
<p>&lsquo;For very practical reasons we have taken the difficult decision to re-arrange some significant events on the school calendar to ensure maximum pupil and staff attendance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The next two weeks are brimming with festivities for both Eid and Christmas that the children are really looking forward to.<br>

		<p>The same thing is happening in the USA. My wife has been in charge of setting up the Christmas tree and all the decorations for the last ten years for her school until last year one Muslim woman, complete with burqua, claimed she was offended by the decorations and the school administrators completely caved into her and disallowed any Christmas decorations. It&rsquo;s a madhouse.</p>

		<p>Can we now write off England as a country gone too far down the road to islamic domination? </p>
<p>You folks over there better wake up while there still may be a slim chance. I was encouraged by some of the recent news. There seems to be a glimmer of hope.</p>

		<p>Just cancel Christmas altogether, get your prayer rug and join the muslim fraternity.</p>
<p>It will be much easier for you if you assimilate into their religion.</p>
<p>Or you can fire the headmaster and his staff and get things back on track and make Christmas a priority and those other foreigners can celebrate their own traditions in the privacy of their own home.</p>

		<p>When two or more beliefs are integrated into the same area, it seems to me that all the effort exerted in so doing is merely towards creating isolation of beliefs in less area than optimal. The beliefs, put in an area large enough for only one belief to exist happily, do not mix into one and have then enough area for happiness   &mdash;   they remain distinct, instead dividing that area into ones each too small for its inhabitants to be happy.</p>
<p>In this case, for instance, it seems that they are trying to run two schools, without <i>actually having</i> two schools. It is as though there were a previous arrangment in which two schools existed, one Muslim and permitting Muslims to do whatever, and one Christian permitting Christians to do whatever, and someone thought, &#8220;hey, let&rsquo;s move these under one roof, that&rsquo;d be great! I&rsquo;m sure they won&rsquo;t mind rearranging their religions to fit!&#8221;</p>

		<p>I remember learning that the day of rest did not necessarily have to be Sunday. God just wants us to take one day off for Him. </p>
<p>Also, Jesus said if one did not acknowledge Him on earth, then Jesus would not acknowledge him/her in Heaven before His Father.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if we know the exact date of Jesus&rsquo; birth. We&rsquo;re talking about a play here. But, taking a back seat to Islam in any sense; not a good direction.</p>
<p>Give &#8216;em an inch; they&rsquo;ll take a mile. </p>

		<p>Be careful when assigning blame.  Is it the Muslims insisting upon this, or the White Marxists?  The Marxists would like to erase Christianity from the culture, and they will use the Muslims to do it.  The Muslims may very well grab Britain in 75 years time, when the White population has been reduced to a weak and deracinated mob, but for now it is White Marxists who have essentially already destroyed Britain.</p>

		<p>Why don&rsquo;t the schools go ahead and have their Christmas festival? If Muslim students want to take off that day to celebrate their Eid, then so be it.</p>
<p>Jeez, how hard is it to mark a student absent from school in Britain, anyway? You open up the roster book and put an X or / by the absent student&rsquo;s name. Are the teachers in Britain that blithering stupid?</p>

		<p>Sajad Hussain said, &#8220;If you do not have both it becomes a racist thing&#8221;.  Actually Sajad, they do have both.  One is observed in the Christian countries like Britain while the other is observed in the Muslim countries.  That&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s supposed to be anyway.  Can Mr. Hussain name one Majority Muslim country that closes its schools on Christian holidays in deference to Christians?</p>

<p>Because if the muslims don&rsquo;t get their way, they become &#8220;outraged&#8221; and tend to loot, rob, rape, burn cars and pillage and also VOTE against you in the elections.</p>

		<p>Get used to it. We all enjoy the multicultural paradise of the UK where you can enjoy more restaurant diversity than anywhere else on earth. As you eat your Tikka Masala perhaps afterwards toddle down to your local mosque and join in there the worship of Allah; I am sure you will be warmly received by the adherents of our religion of peace. For Gordon loves it as his Eid message indicates so go for it I say and join in! England is dead. Killed by Nulabour. So join the Umma! Up the Prophet I say! We are now not England anymore as that is racially coded but now should be called the the Community of Communities according to Lady Gavron and the Runnymede Trust; she is UK establishment, not thee and me. So just give up the England project because nobody cares anymore.</p>

		<p>Why is the Seventh day, the Sabbath, on Saturday? A day, a life, time for God is not the same for humans on earth. So, since my day of rest has suppossedly been every Sunday that I ever went to church, did I not take a day of rest because Sunday was designated as the day of rest for political reasons? (Not many in today&rsquo;s hectic lifestyles could take a day of rest as it was set up in the Old Testament. Old Testament/New Testament-this is where we differ.)</p>
<p>My point was that I belive that God doesn&rsquo;t require us to be so technical with respect to tradition and rituals to be accepted into Heaven to be with Him for eternity. I believe this is a point that those who believe that Jesus is the Son of God, Jesus is Lord; and different sects of Judism disagree on. </p>
<p>I took a Judism course in college. It rattled my brain. I did not know that much about the Old Testament or Jewish history. I&rsquo;m sure you still know more than I. I always like to hear from different perspectives. </p>

<p>Certainly the latter there Flamethrower&hellip;<br>
Where I live here in Downunderland, every year you get a white malcontent (probably some sort of half-arsed &#8216;pagan&rsquo;) with a leftist slant complaining about Christmas and Christianity&rsquo;s awful influence on history. Christmassy things get banned and then they say, &#8220;It&rsquo;s also offensive to Muslims and everyone from anyother minority group&#8221;.<br>
I remember a hoo-hah about Christmas a few years ago, with the usual cavalcade of multi-coloured-hair-do tolerants telling everyone that Christmas offends minority groups. The television show took the trouble to contact a local Muslim leader in order to ask him about these issues - he didn&rsquo;t even know about it. He even stated that he was pleased to be here in a country that allowed people to practise the etc etc etc&hellip;<br>
The funny thing about this was that the Muslim leader was the only sensible bloke involved.<br>
Ah well&hellip;.</p>

		<p>   When you immigrate to the West, you assimilate into the  West . Or whichever country, not vice-versa . This is not complicated, the Muslims need to accept that fact or return to the realm of the Muslim .We have become such weak-kneed wimps . Our great, great grand-fathers would be preparing for a Boston Tea Party or like action right about now .  </p>

		<p>Yes, the time-frame is all wrong. 75 years until the Muslims grab Britain? It&rsquo;ll be more like 15-20 years until they dominate it on present trends, and there&rsquo;s no need for them to grab it: it&rsquo;s already in the process (started about 35 years ago) of being given to them piece by ever-growing piece by our treacherous elites.</p>
