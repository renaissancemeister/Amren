<h1>Morris Brown College&rsquo;s Options Dry Up</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alan Judd, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, December 21, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Without loans to cover $1.5 million in critical bills, the 127-year-old historically black college won&rsquo;t reopen next month for the spring semester, school officials said Saturday. Morris Brown lacks money to pay faculty and staff salaries, utilities and other operating expenses, acting president Stanley Pritchett said.</p>
<p>The school&rsquo;s longstanding financial troubles intensified last week, when the city of Atlanta shut off water service to the campus off Martin Luther King Jr. Drive in the Atlanta University Center.</p>
<p>The city said Morris Brown owes about $380,000 in water bills, some dating to 2004. When the school fell behind on a payment plan to reduce the debt, the city cut off the water &mdash; and, perhaps, Morris Brown&rsquo;s future.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It would be an ignominious end to a school that boasts of being the only Georgia higher-education institution created by African-Americans. The college&rsquo;s alumni include military officers, actors, authors and civil rights leaders such as the late Hosea Williams.</p>
<p>Morris Brown&rsquo;s reputation was tarnished earlier this decade when a federal investigation led to criminal charges against former President Dolores Cross and former financial aid director Parvesh Singh.</p>
<p>Both pleaded guilty in 2006, admitting they acquired millions of dollars in federal loans and grants in the names of students who did not exist. The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools had revoked Morris Brown&rsquo;s accreditation in 2002.</p>
<p><b>Short-term loan sought</b></p>
<p>School officials are scheduled to meet with bankers on Monday, hoping to secure a short-term loan, said Rhonda Copenny, a Morris Brown trustee. The college continues to work on a long-term restructuring of its $32 million debt.</p>
<p>Without &#8220;bridge financing,&#8221; Copenny said, the school is no more than three weeks away from closing permanently.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The city, too, filed liens to prevent Morris Brown from selling property before making good on its water bills. But the school fell behind on its payment plan when its cash flow dried up, Pritchett said.</p>
<p>On Dec. 12, the last day of the fall semester, city officials told the school to pay the full $380,000 immediately or they would terminate water service, Pritchett said. City workers turned off the spigots Dec. 15.</p>
<p><b>Appeal made to city</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>City officials say they gave Morris Brown plenty of chances. Once a customer defaults on a payment plan, though, the account becomes due in full.</p>

		<p>Huh? A college for blacks, run by blacks-plagued by corruption and insolvency? But how can this be? Surely its sterling reputation for turning out high achievers would insure its viability through corporate and alumni contributions! But it appears that the state and federal governments are actually going to let a black institution go under! Who&rsquo;da thunk it?</p>

		<p>$380,000 water bill and only 400 students.  Sounds like this bill hasn&rsquo;t been paid on for many months.  If my water bill is late they turn it off the next month.  Sounds like the water company kept adding the charges on every month rather than terminate service for fear of being called racist.</p>

		<p>On one level this is a shame. Th students are not going to be able to return to class and whatever efforts they&rsquo;ve put forth are for nothing.</p>
<p>Of course, at another level, it&rsquo;s just more of the same from blacks. It seems that whatever they put their hands to, turns out badly. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s running a car wash or running a cllege. The end result is very nearly always the same with blacks, total failure. It&rsquo;s all very disheatening and I&rsquo;m no liberal.</p>

		<p>NPR was shopping for donations the other morning as they ran this story.<br>
We had a Black collage not far from me go under in similar fashion a few years back IIRC. </p>
<p>Clearly these places have outlived their usefulness as times have changed. <br>
Any Black who applies him/herself can find ample good-name collages<br>
to get a quality education at.</p>
<p>Without knowing any facts, I can only surmise the level of standards this place was running at. Probably taking any flunky to get their enrollment up and then adjusting course level to reflect student ability.</p>

		<p>  So the books were cooked and a couple of administrators end up in the slammer. Sounds about right. Here in Ohio historically black Central State University almost met the academic grim reaper until the color caucus started whining and the legislature raided the state treasury to bail the school out. But what I want to know is, with its accredidation gone, what was the quality of Morris Brown&rsquo;s education. Just guessing, but it probably wasn&rsquo;t going to make anyone forget Yale. So let corrupt and ineffective colleges fail regardless of the color of kids&rsquo; skin. Antioch College, just a few miles from Central State, recently closed its doors and its&rsquo; enrollment was overwhelmingly white&hellip;&hellip;.</p>

		<p>I worked for a black run business. We didn&rsquo;t pay any bills. We were late with phone bills, salespeople were cheated out of commissions, we didn&rsquo;t pay hotels, professional services, all kinds of vendors. Phone bills were often unpaid. The lawsuits stacked up, and went uncontested. The business was ultimately evicted. Is this some kind of pattern? </p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s interesting is that for 127 years, blacks were able to more or less keep the college a going concern.  It&rsquo;s only with the advent of the hip hop, ghetto blacks that things have really fallen apart for them. </p>

		<p>This is a sign of what&rsquo;s to come. First of all, as White Nationalists, we shouldn&rsquo;t gloat when Black Institutions go under. All of the students who attended this college will now be demanding entry into predominitely White Colleges, and many of them will get in because of affirmative action. As long as we&rsquo;re forced to share the same country with other races, we should try our best to make sure that there&rsquo;s as much racial separation as possible. Second of all, while I do agree that Black run buisnesses and institutions usually suffer from poor management, we can&rsquo;t blame this entirely on Black Deficiency. The economy is in terrible shape, and this type of sitution is going to start playing out in institutions of higher learning across America, regardless of race. </p>
<p>I firmly believe that colleges and universities will be one of the next sectors to collapse. While the wealthiest Americans don&rsquo;t have a problem paying for their children&rsquo;s education, the vast majority of Americans (of all races) have to utilize goverment grants and student loans (some subsidized by the government, others not) to pay for school. The government is heading for bankruptcy. While Obama continues to pledge increased government spending, most people with common sense know that this isn&rsquo;t possible. The government is out of money, our international credit is virtually wiped out, and we&rsquo;re drastically inflating the dollar by blindly printing as much of it as we can. The goverment will not be able to continue giving grants or subsidizing student loans. The consumer credit market is virtually dried up, which means that students loans will be next to impossible to come by. Our system of higher learning is fixing to collapse.</p>
<p>A guy I&rsquo;ve been listening to lately named Gerald Celente has predicted that 2009 will see America plundge into an economic depression greater than the Great Depression. To give everyone a little perspective on this guy, he correctly predicted the fall of the Soviet Union, the stock market crash of 87, the Asian Stock Market Crash of the 90&rsquo;s, the burst of the dot com bubble (down to the exact quarter), the burst of the housing bubble, and as early as 2007, he said that 08 would see an economic 9/11 that would leave that year known as &#8220;The Panic of 08&#8221;. Fairly accurate if I do say so myself, and I do. He&rsquo;s now claiming that 2009 will go down in history as &#8220;The Collapse of 09&#8221;. I highly recommend listening to this guy. Here&rsquo;s a link to one of his audios on youtube.</p>

<i>&#8220;The city said Morris Brown owes about $380,000 in water bills, some dating to 2004.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>The same thing happens here with black community centers. The bills never seem to get paid. The crisis makes the news when the bills are well into the $1000s range. The community is always shocked and surprised that their beloved center is under threat of being closed and they demand the city do something. I ask myself, &#8216;how could it have gotten this bad? Does no one understand that bills need to be paid on a regular bases so you can keep getting heat, electricity, and water?&rsquo;</p>
<p>These people only believe in juju. Money is supposed to just be there, rain down when needed, or be provided by the city. No one takes responsibility and no one is held accountable.</p>

		<p>Here is what will transpire next in the case&hellip;</p>
<p>1. Civil rights activists will converge on Morris Brown College and level charges of racism. </p>
<p>2. They will hold multiple press conferences declaring that the act of withholding clean water from students harkens back to the days of slavery when the evil White masters often withheld such basic necessities of life to punish errant slaves.</p>
<p>3. The media will escalate the &#8220;civil rights crisis&#8221; to a national level.</p>
<p>4. The &#8220;students&#8221; will riot and destroy portions of Morris Brown College, as well businesses located on the campus in the nearby community (yes, the same business that exist soley to serve the students&rsquo; commerce needs).</p>
<p>5. The local water authority will capitulate and forgive the debt before additional civil rights marches (riots) erupt.</p>
<p>6. Blacks will enjoy water that White taxpayers pay for.</p>
<p>7. Socialism takes another step forward on our backs.</p>

		<p>Similar things happened down here in Houston with the historically-black Texas Southern University.  Corruption, mismanagement, indictments, etc.  The prosecution of TSU President Priscilla Slade ended in mistrial after an African American on the jury refused to convict.  The state had to offer Slade a plea bargain in which she paid back a pittance of the missing money and avoided all jail time.  </p>

		<p>What is it about blacks and refusing to pay bills?<br>
A minor irritation in the greater scheme of things, one might think, perhaps some of us secretly wish &#8216;good on them&rsquo; for their feisty attitude,but there is a drawback as there always is a drawback.<br>
  Many leading pundits have opined that the current financial meltdown that has engulfed the USA - and unforyunately seems to have taken the rest of the world down with it was engendered by the mass refusal of millions of blacks to pay mortgage payments.<br>
  As the great man said &#8220;There&rsquo;s no such thing as a free-lunch&#8221;.</p>

		<p>As my fellow metro Atlantans can testify, Hosea Williams was no credit to any institution, no matter how many homeless people he fed at Thanksgiving(something he was known for, and the ministry continues now, 8 yrs. after his death). He was a drunk who was arrested many times for DUI and always snivelled &#8220;racism!&#8221; His buddy Andrew Young (mayor for 2 terms in the &#8216;80&rsquo;s)sided with him. I suppose Young did not realize or care that Williams could have killed innocent blacks as well as whites. Also, as many times as Williams was arrested, I bet some of the cops were black.</p>
<p>Even the AJC, liberal rag though it is, condemned Williams&rsquo; defensive attitude in its tribute to him after he died. I was surprised.</p>

<p>Well, one of their listed achievements listed on their website is the reduction of majors from 48 to 2 as a cost-saving measure.</p>
<p>However, one major is for undergrads (Management, Entrepreneurship, and Technology Program) and the other is for adult students (Organizational Management and Leadership Program), so you don&rsquo;t even get to choose between the two!</p>
<p>The &#8220;College Departments&#8221; page is empty, so there are apparently no specialized departments.</p>

		<p>Winston Smith has made the most relevant point here: These Blacks will transfer to nearby majority White schools.  Just like any other formerly segregated institutions, such as public restrooms or drinking fountains, when you take their special places from them, the Blacks will join you and your children at your place.  As long as there are Blacks to be dealt with, it will be cheaper and far healthier to provide them with their own, well-supported separate world, than to allow them to enter ours.</p>

<p>This is what I think, too.  </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a tactic us race realists should try.  Anytime a debate comes up, we need to turn the debate to putting it on the prosperous blacks who&rsquo;ve already benefitted from Affirmative Action, to return to the ghetto, invest their money in the ghetto by starting businesses there and buying a house and living there, donating to black colleges, and use their own natural authority to be substitute fathers to the young black males being raised by single mothers and discipline them into shaping up.</p>
<p>When the attempts to instill white guilt on us start, we need to shrug and say, we whites can do nothing.  Everything we&rsquo;ve tried has resulted in the ghetto troubles getting worse.  YOU, Prosperous Black Men, need to go back there and fix things. YOU do it.</p>

		<p>Two things puzzle me about this story:</p>
<p>1.) $380,000 in water bills, dating back four years.</p>
<p>Huh?  $95,000 a year in water bills, at minimum?  What were they running?  A college, or a water-park?  Perhaps they were referring to the combined utility bill.  Wouldn&rsquo;t be the first time a journalist wrote any old stupid figure.</p>
<p>2.) They&rsquo;ve been unaccredited since 2002.  A degree from an unaccredited college is worth about as much as a completion certificate from a multi-level marketing seminar.  Why did this college have any students at all? <br>

		<p>I went to college at a well-known private college in New England and for two years, worked in the Financial Aid office.  I saw the abuses of financial aid counselors for black students and athletes.</p>
<p>One day, a prominant black financial aid counselor who had been at the school for 15+ years was suddenly fired.  It was discovered that he was falsifying Federal financial aid forms for black students to enable them to qualify for Pell Grants and other State and University money.  It was rumored that he had a Federal charges filed against him.  The college paper had no story and the local newspaper somehow didn&rsquo;t get wind of the crime(s).  It was one of the first times I realized how political correctness worked, first hand, and the complicit press.</p>
<p>In addition, two black women (from a rough minority area near the campus) who were hired as adminstrators were also fired a few months later for physically threatening students and one actually pushed a small white co-ed (the offending female was over 250 lbs. with 4&#8221; nails and fake hair).  The school also buried that story and it was rumored to pay for the girl&rsquo;s entire tuitition in exchange for her silence.  Just like the offending school official, it didn&rsquo;t make the news or even the college&rsquo;s miserable weekly paper.</p>
<p>My last story was my last semester when I worked for the basketball team for my workstudy job 20 hours a week.  By week 7 of the semester, 8 of the 12 scholarship players (100% black) had not even picked up the books that the school had purchased for them.  I was really shocked as that was one of my 3 jobs plus loans I took to get my degree.</p>

		<p>We have a state sponsored HBC in my hometown. About 25-30 years ago and still to this day there was/is a push on to get white students to attend the university, I assume to get more federal funds for the university under some diversity program, or that is what the rumor has always been, and makes sense. One of my very best freinds from high school ( and this was about 30 years ago) who was never a &#8220;brain&#8221;, in fact was dumb as heck, was having trouble getting into the other colleges ended up going there out of default because they would accept him and gave him free everything and if memory serves I even beleive he was paid to attend. He barely got thru high school but he became an honor student at this university along with as far as I know all the other whites. He graduated with honors and went on to become a teacher and has done well. They cant flunk all the blacks so they grade so much on the curve that anyone with even half a brain can get a degree. So much for quality edukashun&hellip;..   KF      </p>

		<p>Here is what goes through the typical black-mind when they read the above article:</p>
<p>This is obviously yet another racist plot by the white-man to keeps blacks down. Everyone knows water is supposed to be free, right? But the greedy white-man charges blacks confiscatory rates for the sole purpose of bankrupting a black college. Damned racist whites!<br>

<p>Why assume this person is lying? Maybe he now visits and posts here <i>because</i> of that unfortunate experience. Many AR denizens (myself included) only became racially aware after seeing black social pathology firsthand.</p>

		<p>A guy I&rsquo;ve been listening to lately named Gerald Celente has predicted that 2009 will see America plundge into an economic depression greater than the Great Depression. To give everyone a little perspective on this guy, he correctly predicted the fall of the Soviet Union, the stock market crash of 87, the Asian Stock Market Crash of the 90&rsquo;s, the burst of the dot com bubble </p>
<p>  Yes, he has made these predictions, but what ones has he missed on? Do you really think that one person is Nostradamus over everything? Alot of people predicted this collapse because we are overextended as a nation and our  lax mortgage standards. It is not mysticism. Alot of this recession/depression is psychological reaction to high fuel costs and the recent financial institution fallouts. We still have the highest GDP, by far. We still are the best place to invest in because of our political stability. We are not even close to what the Great Depression was. Money is international and instant now. What will happpen is foreign money will demand big pieces of companies and equity positions for this money. If China wants access to U.S. markets, they will not stop the credit flow. It would kill their industry even more. We are their best customer. </p>
<p>As for Black college institutions, most will die. Alot of Private Liberal Arts Colleges will also fail. Private funding,  diminishing returns of today&rsquo;s degrees, and the coming shrinkage of available college loans will kill them. They cannot survive without Sallie Mae anymore than the car companies can without auto financing. Economics will change all of this PC agenda quickly. When middle-class whites keep losing, the survival instinct, that is in all of us,regardless of race, will emerge. Just look at history. Some of us just need a blade at our throat first.</p>

<p>Look up this school using the list to the right of this page. Notice, no data listed. OK, now try clicking on Similar Institutions Comparison tab. Look at the &#8220;similar institutions&#8221; - mostly black institutions. Check out their SAT or ACT scores! WOW! </p>
<p>Have fun with this link; check out other &#8220;black colleges&#8221;.</p>

		<p>I used to work at a bank for several years.  Dealing with blacks you see their true colors.  Most loans that defaulted were mostly blacks.  Even the few black employess that has loans with the same bank they worked for&hellip;..defaulted the own loans, etc.  The bank never said anything to those employees!!  If it was a White person, we were ran through thru the ringer!!  My husband was late one time on a loan &amp; I got the phone call from main office.  It is such a double standard.  <br>
Most blacks would cry racist if you asked for their ID when you cashed their check.  We even had two black women call the NAACP when they were turned down for a loan due their creadit was horrible.  <br>
I say close the black college campus.  Blacks only get hired thanks to affirmative action, so why waste the time &amp; money to go to college?  </p>

<p>Wow indeed.  How about that 9.1 percent graduation rate for fully-accredited Concordia College, which, according to its website, has a math department that does not offer classes in calculus   &mdash;   and only one in pre-calculus!  Most are basic algebra, which I remember taking in 6th and 7th grade.  And I was not in the fast-track class either.</p>

<p>Making up stories does not help our cause.</p>
<p>Posted by Hal at 10:25 PM on December 31&#8221;</p>
<p>You are wrong about &#8220;making up stories&#8221;. I work for an African CEO. Affirmative Action has replaces thousands of Caucasian CEO&rsquo;s with Africans. The African CEO has been here for ten years, and I could tell you stories that would curl you hair. However, I cannot because I want to keep my job.</p>
<p>Just a sample: most Caucasian males have been replace with African males. White females are hired, and if they are &#8220;cooperative&#8221;, they can keep their jobs. &#8220;Parties&#8221; are held at company expense, where the African males and the Caucasian females mingle. Any Caucasian females that don&rsquo;t &#8220;cooperate&#8221; are deemed &#8220;racist&#8221;. The business has declined precipitously, and many good people are losing their jobs. I believe this is going on all across the country. </p>

		<p>Can anyone in here explain to me how incompetent or near-incompetent Blacks have such advantages in this country?  How can a country survive if its mindset is in such a warped view of reality?  Don&rsquo;t people want quality employees -in spite of the communistic pressure to hire those who don&rsquo;t even qualify for a position?  Past discrimination against Blacks seems more rational to me because in probably 99% of the cases, Whites certainly brought more to a company than Blacks.  This favoritism toward Blacks in every spere of society is to me a nonpareil evil that must be rectified or a future generation of Whites will take matters into their own hands&hellip;. All it will take to spark this fire is a charismatic White leader who isn&rsquo;t afraid of death and fed up with this egregious double standard trained against the progeny of our White forefathers&hellip;. Can anyone in here see a different outcome?</p>

<p>@Hal. No, I&rsquo;m not lying. Why do you think I&rsquo;m here? Strider has it right. </p>

		<p>  Intelligence and imagination are the only true barriers people face regardless of race. You can not blame others for your failures and blacks can not blame you all for their failures. Once you put the blame on someone else you strip the power from yourself to change the situation you are in. Once you accept responsibility for your life, you can then press forward through all your obstacles. In the game of life you only have yourself to blame for your disappointments.</p>
