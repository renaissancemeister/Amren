<h1>Racial Tensions Flare Over School&rsquo;s Name</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, December 21, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Racial tensions may be the subplot in Carson as elected officials and community activists haggle between naming a new high school after a slain African-American Los Angeles police officer or labor/civil rights icon Cesar Chavez, it was reported Sunday.</p>
<p>In October, the City Council unanimously voted to recommend naming the school after LAPD SWAT Officer Randal Simmons, who died in a shootout earlier this year. But, since then, two council members, Mayor Jim Dear and Councilman Harold Williams, have had second thoughts, the Daily Breeze reported.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Unified School District is building the school at Santa Fe Avenue and Carson Street, just over the Long Beach side of the city limits with Carson. Despite the tussle in Carson, the power to name the school rests with the school district.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Simmons was black, and much of the support for naming the school in his honor comes from his church, Glory Christian International Fellowship, a predominately black congregation &mdash; in spite of the new high school which will be located in largely Latino community, the paper reported.</p>
<p>The issue may also play a role in the upcoming council election, as Julie Ruiz Raber, a Latina and former councilwoman is campaigning to get her seat back, the Daily Breeze reported, and has taken the lead in calling for the school-naming decision to be re-examined.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Councilman Mike Gipson, who led the effort to name the school for Simmons, told the Daily Breeze that the school district already has a school named after Chavez.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll give the blacks credit here for this one thing   &mdash;   they&rsquo;re showing a little bit of originality when it comes to finding someone to name a school after.  With Chicano Hispanics, it seems to be all Cesar Chavez, all the time.</p>

		<p>There are certain groups that just don&rsquo;t get along in any manner.  The Greeks and the Turks (I am not blaming the Greeks on that one), the Arabs and Jews, Chinese and Japanese, Punjabi Muslims and Indian Hindus.  The same is true of native-born &#8220;African-Americans&#8221; and Mexicans.  They truly hate each other.  I have been to D.C. for business innumerable times in recent years and with my own eyes seen, in broad daylight, knife fighting and worse.  Several were killed. If people would wake up from their dreary slumbers, this is the most explosive racial tension.  Sure the whites will have to get involved somehow, with the idiotic liberals, but I want to stay away from the el barrios and the ghettos, let alone the cities.  I am sympathetic for those whites caught in the middle.</p>

		<p>Hispanics are going to push blacks aside. They will be the ones to benefit from America&rsquo;s racial-spoils system. Look to see more of this kind of thing in the years to come.</p>

		<p>Since when did naming a government building depend on race or the race of people using it?  Naming it in honor of a fallen police officer is a great idea; noble and respectful. I hope the people do not allow this other &#8220;idea&#8221; to progress and win. When is the silly stuff going to stop?</p>

		<p>Blacks are going to find out that Hispanics have no problem playing the race card and even less of a problem pushing their racial agenda. Unfortunately for them, there is no such thing as &#8220;brown guilt&#8221; or &#8220;brown man&rsquo;s burden&#8221;.  </p>

		<p>It should be named after a White Christian American, the culture that created the public school system in America, such as &#8221; Horace Mann&#8221;; but according to anti-White, anti-Christians, that would be too logical.</p>

		<p>Name it after the dead cop I say. </p>
<p>Those &#8220;Latinos&#8221; (meaning almost all Mexicans) where it is located don&rsquo;t have a lot of common sense in this matter.</p>
<p>A cursory look at the record of Cesar Chavez will show that he was vehemently anti illegal immigrant, most of whom are Mexicans. So why would they even consider him a hero, if he went up against what they agitate for the most: allowing unrestricted immigration from Mexico? </p>

		<p>Can anyone imagine that the name of this school matters one whit? Who cares under what banner thousands of children fail to learn a single thing of importance? Name the child-warehouse anything at all. The students will still never learn to read or write proper English, and will never be able to compete against the knowledge workers of Japan, India, Korea, or China. Call it J-Lo High. Call it Chris Rock High. The students will always know much more about those two people then they ever will know about Algebra or Chemistry.</p>
<p>I know, I know. Shut up, Whitey. Send in your tax money to fund these frauds and don&rsquo;t dare point out that we are wasting it.</p>

		<p>Viva Cesar Chavez! AR once reported (I think it was the mid 1990s) that blacks in LA rioted over a school being named after Cesar Chavez. They actually thought it was being named after Mexican boxer Julio Cesar Chavez.</p>
<p>But seriously, it is hard not to have schaudenfraude at blacks getting done to them what they usually do to whitey.</p>

		<p>SWAT Officer Randal Simmons was shot by a Hispanic man, Edwin Rivera, in San Fernando Valley.  Maybe this is a way for the Black community to put it to the Hispanics.  Either way, it&rsquo;s only going to fan the flames of the on-going racial tension between the two races.  They will continue to battle it out to decide who is on the lowest rung of American society, and no doubt, the Blacks will lose.</p>

		<p>Whites should evacuate out all of their children, and the White teachers, administrators, and citizens should leave the area. Allow the Blacks and Hispanics to work out their own problems. </p>
<p>Now, what do you think will happen when all of the Whites are gone? Will Blacks and Hispanics engage in a civilized process, or will it become a third-world, savage, uncivilized process?</p>
<p>You only get one guess&hellip;<br>

		<p>Believe it or not, in Mexico Whiteness is honored.  I went there in the eighties and late nineties and the Criollos or pure Spanish get to be on T.V., in commercials&hellip;.. They honor The Spaniards who founded Mexico.  Whites are on the top.  I like that too.  If Whites founded it, they should be rewarded and their families.  Not to mention, they have the highest I.Q.&rsquo;s, so naturally they will aspire to higher positions anyway&hellip;</p>

		<p>Whatever they name the school, the kids will either be truant or drop out.  </p>
<p>Maybe the issue should be decided by a competition, test scores, or just whichever group has the fewest illegitimate births or crimes.  Should being an illegal alien be a crime?  Well it isn&rsquo;t anywhere else in the country, so why should it be here?</p>

		<p>Tom S at 8:15 on the 22nd: I have an even better idea!  Name the school Isadore Rabinowitz School.  Then both the Black Muslims and the MeCha crowd can have a common complaint, given how full of Jew-haters each of those groups are.  </p>
<p>Or, more realistically, Albert Einstein School.  Not just a Jew, but a darn intelligent one.  That way the school board could really rub it in.</p>

<p> The Greeks from Greece and Turks from Turkey get along just fine. It&rsquo;s the Greek-Americans<br>
, and I am blaming the Greek Orthodox Church in America on that one, who always try to stir up trouble between the two people. As if war were to erupt between these two countries, Greek-Americans would enroll en masse ın the Greek army. Fat chance!</p>
<p> Let me give you some examples to debunk your assertion:</p>
<p> - A while back, I had dinner at a Greek restaurant in Germany. When the Greek owner (from Greece) learned I was Turkish, he opened a complementary bottle of champagne for me, and he made it plain he wouldn&rsquo;t do this for a German.</p>
<p>- A Turkish friend who attended high school in Athens, was riding in a bus one day with his classmates when a group of Albanians riding in the bus began cursing Greeks and Greece. He immediately cursed back at the Albanians and warned them not to mess with his Greek friends. This Turkish friend dated a number of Greek girls and came close to marrying one.</p>
<p>- This same Turkish friend took me to dinner at a Greek restaurant in the US where we spent hours after the restaurant was almost empty, talking with the Greek owner (from Greece) about how to prepare calamari and how to pick the best olive oil. </p>
<p>- Another Greek restaurant owner (from Greece) in the US sold his restaurant to a Turkish chef and told him to keep the food the same bland, tasteless way because that&rsquo;s the way Americans liked their food. Now, the Turkish owner is raking in the dough selling Meditteranean food to Americans no Greek or Turk would touch with a ten foot pole.</p>
<p>- Lots of Greek Aegean islanders ferry over to the Turkish side to shop for virtually everything, from foodstuffs to tvs etc.. and they are treated very warmly.</p>
<p>I could go on and on about how well Greeks are treated in Turkey and vice versa but I think you got the point.</p>

<p>I live in S. California where there are a lot of spanish TV channels.  They have a lot of not exactly soap operas, but ongoing family sagas with lots of drama and intrigue.  I like to watch those shows.  </p>
<p>I have noticed that just about every person on Spanish TV is very white skinned with very anglo features such as thin up turned noses.  Almost all the women have blonde hair.  It&rsquo;s amazing. The villians tend to be dark haired. </p>
<p>Mainstream American TV has a lot more non whites and hispanic lookling actors and news readers than Spanish TV.</p>
