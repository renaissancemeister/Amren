<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A woman in the San Francisco Bay area was jumped by four men, taunted for being a lesbian, repeatedly raped and left naked outside an abandoned apartment building, authorities said Monday.</p>
<p>Detectives say the 28-year-old victim was attacked Dec. 13 after she got out of her car, which bore a rainbow gay pride sticker. The men, who ranged from their late teens to their 30s, made comments indicating they knew her sexual orientation, said Richmond police Lt. Mark Gagan.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Authorities are characterizing the attack as a hate crime but declined to reveal why they think the woman was singled out because of her sexual orientation. Gagan would say only that the victim lived openly with a female partner and had a rainbow flag sticker on her car.</p>
<p>The 45-minute attack began when one of the men approached the woman as she crossed the street, struck her with a blunt object, ordered her to disrobe and sexually assaulted her with the help of the other men.</p>
<p>When the group saw another person approaching, they forced the victim back into her car and took her to a burned-out apartment building, where she was raped again inside and outside the vehicle. The assailants took her wallet and drove off in her car. Officers found the car abandoned two days later.</p>
<p>The woman sought help from a nearby resident, and she was examined at a hospital. Although the victim said she did not know her attackers, detectives hope someone in the community knows them. One of the men went by the nickname &ldquo;Blue&rdquo; and another was called &ldquo;Pato,&rdquo; according to authorities.</p>

								<h2>Richmond Police Investigate Rape as Hate Crime</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Karl Fischer, West County Times (San Jose), Dec. 19, 2008</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Four men beat and raped a woman and left her naked on a central Richmond street last weekend, punctuating their 45-minute attack with comments that made clear why they chose her as their victim &mdash; she is a lesbian, police said.</p>
<p>The crime, while equaled in violence by others in the city&rsquo;s recent past, differs in that it also bore the unmistakable stamp of prejudice against the victim, police said Friday.</p>
<p>For that reason, detectives will investigate the case as a hate crime as well as a sexual assault, and the Richmond Police Department offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to arrests and prosecution in the case.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police said the victim described the ringleader as a Latino man in his 30s, about 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighing about 180 pounds, with black hair and brown eyes. He had a mustache and his breath smelled of alcohol. He primarily spoke Spanish.</p>
<p>His main accomplice was a black man in his early 20s, about 5-foot-10 and 170 pounds with black hair and brown eyes, who was called &ldquo;Blue&rdquo; by his colleagues, police said.</p>
<p>Two other Latino men also participated. Both were in their late teens or early 20s, and one was called &ldquo;Pato,&rdquo; police said.<br>

		<p> If I know the AP, and as a retired newspaper reporter I think I do, I&rsquo;d guess that the woman was White, and her assailants black. Whenever the AP is careful not to identify the race of a perpetrator of a crime, you can bet that the person/persons are black.</p>
<p> The AP is especially hesitant to identify black perps by race when their victim was White, and the crime fits what the nabobs of the AP view as &#8220;racial stereotypes.&#8221; </p>

		<p>Of course there will be no outrage by the usual suspects because the black and spanic trees do not drop cash when they are shaken.  Only the white tree dumps cash.  Don&rsquo;t expect any cries. However, confuse the minds of the dummy masses and point this out.</p>

		<p>Some day blacks and Hispanics will have concentration camps for whites - and, even then, the mainstream media will ignore it.  This is their motto when it comes to anti-white violence: &#8220;ignore it ignore it ignore it&#8221;.</p>

		<p>This is an example of what I was talking about on this medium last week.  These &#8220;homophobic&#8221; hate crimes are really anti-white hate crimes, but will somewhat be misinterpreted, and the media, in no mood to tell the truth, will blame the &#8220;religious right.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The crime, described in this article, is very serious, and those convicted of it deserve serious punishment. But why are the victim&rsquo;s sexual and/or political preferences relevant?* If the victim were a heterosexual Libertarian, would a rational society impose less punishment on the perpetrators?<br>
In the amendments to the U.S. constitution, Article XIV, Sec. 1. it states: nor shall any state &hellip; deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the law.<br>
Note it states equal protection. By applying harsher penalties for crimes against one class of people than another, the state is denying equal protection. Thus Hate Crime laws are a Liberal device for trashing the Constitutional guarantee of equal protection for all citizens, and allowing the Liberals to protect the groups that Liberals want to protect. By selective enforcement, Liberals can also persecute the groups that Liberals want to persecute.</p>

		<p>It is curious that the AP story left out so many details, yet is still as long as the West County Times story. Is it because AP values persiflage more than pertinence? Or is the Agency a self-appointed censor? We still don&rsquo;t know the lesbian&rsquo;s race from either source. How curious.</p>

		<p>The AP is so consistent in the absence of race-related information in its articles, that I think it is their editorial policy to remove it.</p>
<p>The AP has a consistently leftist slant to its articles. Amren&rsquo;s selection from them has more or less proven this. Occasionally I see an exception elsewhere, but only very rarely.</p>

		<p>As a rape victim, I feel for this lady. A negative interaction with a male/s in her past possibly could have brought her eventually to be a lesbian. Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t think her point of view would improve very much after this. If anything good could come of this, if she could stand the press, she could use this crime to fight bigger fights that need attention.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s a suggestion:</p>
<p>Google &#8220;black male&#8221; and select the NEWS option.</p>
<p>Then, google &#8220;white male,&#8221; again searching news. </p>
<p>Note the difference.</p>
<p>News stories about black males are usually about crime. News stories about white males are not. </p>
<p>This is either&hellip;</p>
<p>•  racial biased by a white-supremacist liberal media (imagine), or  </p>
<p>• overwhelming evidence that not even the politically-correct liberal media can hide the domination of crime in the black male culture. </p>

		<p>There are two possible reasons for the partial silence on an event that allegedly occurred 12/13/08.</p>
<p>First, there is a tremendous pressure to avoid categorizing any kind of rape as a hate crime. (Remember the recent Texas rapes of young white men?) To open the way for the public, the media, and the cops to consider rape as a hate crime would be to overwhelm the system with lots of rape crimes as hate crimes. Since the beginning of hate crimes ideology, rape has been carefully set apart from the kinds of crime that can provide the underpinning for a hate crime charge, and to open up rape crimes is to begin to topple the hate crime ideology.  The perps would come from only one or two demographics and hate crime statistics would never be the same again.</p>
<p>Second, the cops may suspect it is a hate crime hoax and want to mute it, although that is unlikely. (Remember the Berkeley lesbian and her carefully constructed hoax, being beaten with a shovel?) But consider that it matches the three key requirements. It is without witnesses even though it allegedly took place at three different relatively public places.  It is only the word of the victim that the assailants called her a lesbian, and her claims may not be matched by the evidence inscribed on her body. </p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know what a hoax payoff might be, but it could be connected with Proposition 8 in California. The AP story refers to &#8220;Avy Skolnik, a coordinator with the New York-based National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs&#8221; who flogged the story so Skolnik may be the one getting the payoff. &#8220;Skolnik said the group plans to analyze hate crime data to see whether fluctuations may be related to the gay marriage bans that appeared on ballots this year in California, Arizona and Florida.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The victim is white, the perps black and/or hispanic. If I am right, do I win a prize? Minorities hate gays because they are the whites that will first move into &#8220;their&#8221; neighborhood, because the real estate prices are low.  </p>

		<p>The Associated Press is national and provides their stories to most major newspapers, whereas the West County Times is merely a local rag.  When a vicious crime such as this occurs, the locals may read or hear detailed descriptions of the suspects involved, but will rarely get detail descriptors from crimes occurring outside their local area involving minority on white.  On the other hand, any crime committed by a white against a minority receives not only local but national attention as well.  And not only from newspapers, but from local and nationally broadcast news programs also. This results in people getting a distorted view of the true statistics regarding interracial crimes.  While they may agree that minorities commit crimes against whites occasionally (based on the few stories they hear about locally), they honestly believe that white on minority crime is much more common (based on local AND national news sources), and thus deserving of special protection via hate crime laws.  They have swallowed this media-generated racial propaganda hook, line, and sinker.<br>
The AP omitting the descriptors of the suspects while the local San Jose paper &#8216;West County Times&rsquo; included them perfectly illustrates this.</p>

		<p>This stuff happens every day in San Fran and most barely makes the news.  &#8220;Tolerance&#8221; to the PC mafia means ignoring everyday violence inflicted on (high) tax paying citizens and coddling criminals in the name of diversity.  I lived there for about 1 year and my conclusion was that it is just a matter of time before something like this happens to you.</p>

<p>We need our own media then. There&rsquo;s a golden opportunity to start our own media chain right now. Newspapers around the country are going out of business or looking for buyers now that the economy is falling apart. The White Nationalist Movement should buy them up and we should start covering the news ourselves.</p>
<p>Wait, I forgot. There is no White Nationalist Movement in this country. We don&rsquo;t even have an American equivalent of the British National Party and nobody has any money. We&rsquo;re doing good to buy internet access, let alone a small-town newspaper.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s an excellent example of a multicultural area that is displaying what is a common occurrence, besides other crimes of course.</p>
<p>Areas like these are becoming more numerous throughout the country, and they&rsquo;re not just limited to the Southwest, the West, and large urban areas.  They&rsquo;re creeping into the suburbs in the heartland and have been migrating for several years now.</p>
<p>The blacks are giving us all the urban crime we can handle, while mestizos, Somalis, Hmong, etc., are doing all they can to cause the degeneration to third world levels of the outlying areas in many instances.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m beginning to wonder now, for the first time, if these people will really go home after all when we get to the point where jobs are going to be extremely hard to come by, especially peon work, and instead stay here where the pickings are more rewarding for burglary, robbery, and scamming the system.</p>
<p>I read the American Patrol web site a while back, which claimed we were still getting about 60% of the average inflow of illegals across the southern border in spite of less work available.</p>
<p>The hot shot politicos and the corporate greed mongers have been so extremely enthusiastic about encouraging the importation of cheap workers, consumers, and tax units, in order to increase their wealth and power, I don&rsquo;t think they still understand what having tens of millions of unemployed, unskilled workers in this country is going to mean to the safety and security to themselves and to their god, the almighty dollar.</p>
<p>Cetainly, the out-of-touch PC crowd is unaware of anything unfavorable happening and are doing what they always do, which is to fantasize about everybody hugging each other as one big happy family, not needing food or jobs, because they expect them to live off love and tolerance.</p>
<p>America will implode because of the bottom tiers in the last analysis, but it was the top tier, so-called elites, who brought it all about, of course, which everybody here is aware of.</p>
<p>I wonder if they still expect a North American Union on the way to a One World government now that they are witnessing the ongoing economic catastrophe?</p>

		<p><i>This is their motto when it comes to anti-white violence: &ldquo;ignore it, ignore it, ignore it&rdquo;.</i></p>
<p>It goes against Leftist theology that anti-white violence, racism, or prejudice can even exist. It&rsquo;s impossible.  After all, only whites can be guilty of racism.  </p>
<p>These oppressed and persecuted &#8220;minorities&#8221; (even when the majority!) are only lashing out after enduring a lifetime of discrimination and abuse.  The poor things!  What else can they do?  They just couldn&rsquo;t help it.  And the white woman doubtless deserved what she got. Served her right! </p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be at all surprised if these three Hispanics and a Black would argue that they were &#8220;converting&#8221; her and were doing her a favor   &mdash;   showing her what &#8220;a real man&#8221; can do.  That&rsquo;s EXACTLY their mentality.  They all imagine that every woman secretly craves them, if she could just get over her shyness or inhibitions.</p>
<p>Speaking of converts, I hope there&rsquo;s at least one new convert to the racial right.  Maybe she&rsquo;ll find her way to Amren.<br>

Very true. And, as a person living in Europe at present, let me add that many of these (relatively rare) white-on-black crimes receive INTERNATIONAL attention as well (and generate  much outrage).  But you will never hear the reverse story about crime in America. That story doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>

		<p>The media is out to report shock, fear, devastation, and any type of emotional uprising. That&rsquo;s how they remain on the air with their competition. It&rsquo;s always about outdoing the next. Well, the whites are being outdone. I guess the whites who&rsquo;d rather play it straight are just too boring. But all that shock, fear, devastation, and uprising is the downfall of what a white, seemingly boring, normal life started which was valued over all at one time; always for me. </p>

<p>Maybe, maybe not.  Was Gary Trzaska beaten to death by five black teens on a Buffalo street because he was queer, or because he was white?  Who knows?  If you weren&rsquo;t in Buffalo, or an <i>AR</i> subscriber, you wouldn&rsquo;t have heard of this.

<p>However, this bias can be turned to our advantage.  When some white man&rsquo;s crime is overemphasized, simply point out that it is, only because white crime is so rare.  &#8220;Man bites dog.&#8221;  </p>

		<p>&#8220;The hate crime concept is indeed per se unconstitutional reference the equal protection clause. It is also punishment for thought. It is a steppeing stone towards punishing speech.&#8221;<br>
- 1984</p>
<p>Fist, motive has always been a consideration in the law. It makes a big difference why a crime was committed, whether or not it was intentional, etc. These, of course, are thoughts.</p>
<p>Second, you miss the point of a hate crime. A hate crime is an attack on all members of a particular group. For example, if someone is targeting gays. These crimes are designed to instill fear into the whole group and not just the victim. Hence the more serious nature of the crime.</p>

<p>Exactly.  One idea is that if you are ever attacked by nonwhites in any fashion, whether rape, battery, robbery, or mere hurled insults, claim to the police that you&rsquo;re gay.  No, you will not be asked to prove it!  The whole politically-correct &#8220;hate crime&#8221; media industry can not only be conveniently put to work for us in this fashion, but violent criminals who are &#8220;merely&#8221; anti-white bigots will face sterner prosecution.</p>

<p>I explain risk management to people with a fictitious game of chance:</p>
<p>There are two containers with an equal number of marbles of different colors. Both include the dreaded &#8220;orange marbles&#8221; (a.k.a. &#8220;the death marbles&#8221;). Pick a single marble from either container while blindfolded. If you draw an orange marble (the death marble), you will lose your life. One of the containers holds nine times as many death marbles. Now pick a marble, but you may ask me one question first. What is your question?</p>
<p>Any rational, sane person would ask, &#8220;Which container has nine times as many death marbles,&#8221; so that he may avoid that container.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the game of life. Yes, all races have good and bad people, but one race has a far higher percentage of high risk, deadly people. Every metric in existence verifies that fact.<br>

		<p>As my university days were spent at Santa Cruz, I know two things are equally certain in this case: 1. This woman, as a California lesbian is a liberal who reserves a special hatred for white men, and 2. She will find some way to blame white men for the ordeal she was subjected to, probably centering on Marxist babble jargon like &#8220;racism&#8221;, &#8220;marginalization&#8221; and &#8220;dehumanization&#8221;.</p>
<p>Interesting, is it not, that four rapist/kidnapper/carjackers who were still at large when the AP article went to press, were not described as anything other than &#8220;men&#8221;, with no actual physical description given, despite the obvious ongoing danger these violent criminals pose to the public.  If the newspapers in the United States are dying off, it is because they deserve to, with their willful refusal to provide the reading public the simple information it needs to keep safe and possibly identify fugitive rapists.

***************<br>
How do you know what they believe?  Let&rsquo;s not jump at conclusions too hastily.  I lived in a dangerous, minority neighborhood for some years, and lived to tell of it, though barely. You would have assumed I was raving liberal too, I&rsquo;m sure. </p>
<p>I was not consumed with self-hate; I did not idolize &#8220;minorities&#8221;; and I did not think we were &#8220;all in this together&#8221;.  Nor was I a &#8220;liberal&#8221;.  Anything but.  I was there simply because it was affordable.  That&rsquo;s all!  And, as a matter of fact, so were nearly all of the other white people who were stuck living there too.  Most of them were far from liberal. When you&rsquo;re elderly, have heavy debts, not well educated, or poor, you don&rsquo;t have much choice as to where you&rsquo;d like to live.  I got out, but most of them didn&rsquo;t.  It all boiled town to economics, not ideology.</p>

It is made even more tragic by the fact that crimes likes this   &mdash;   that is, blacks and hispanics raping, assaulting, robbing, stealing from and murdering whites   &mdash;   is an everyday occurrence in our society, and our press is complicit in purposefully obfuscating the truth about the racial aspects of such crimes.</p>

		<p>I doubt it is a hoax.  If the incident had been a politically-motivated fabrication, the woman would have blamed white university fraternity members or lacrosse players.</p>

		<p>The Race Card trumps the Gay Card or the Woman Card.  For that matter, it trumps the wildlife conservation and environment cards,too.  </p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly how certain powerful forces have set things up to be.  Our western civilization&rsquo;s current respect for gays and women and the planet we live on is a product of the Scandinavian mind.  That&rsquo;s why big corporations and big religions (I include Marxism) are doing everything possible to destroy the world&rsquo;s scandic peoples.</p>
<p>The big corporations and the world&rsquo;s &#8216;great&rsquo; religions are like giant tumors.  All they want is to get bigger. That they might destroy their hosts seems not to be a concern.  They want women to be baby factories, and want men to do nothing but toil, in order to support those babies, give money to their religions, and buy from the corporations.  Bigger! Bigger! Bigger!  Never mind that we&rsquo;ve pretty much run out of room, already.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the new, relentlessly promoted, orthodoxy is diversity.  Diversity will swamp and degrade white western nations.  Once true whites are a minority in the world&rsquo;s most powerful nations, the values of non-whites will predominate.  </p>
<p>Lesbians were taught that their suppression was a product of evil white Western traditions, when in truth, it was Middle Eastern traditions that had suppressed women and gays.  I get no pleasure in knowing how horrible it will be for Lesbians to discover, one by one, how much worse things will be for them under non-whites.</p>
<p>Gays are already wishing they had not backed Obama.  They will have been only the first group to regret their support of the man with three Muslim names.</p>

		<p>I am a lesbian.  I am also a white person for white people.  I know that I wouldn&rsquo;t date black men if I were heterosexual, which I have tried very hard to be and failed.  I know this because I do not date black women.  I don&rsquo;t think that they are all the same; but I don&rsquo;t want to date them, or live with them, or be the wife of them.  They are different in ways that make me uncomfortable.  </p>
<p>Fr. John, my love for white men is that I see you as my brothers in a way that black women can never be my sisters.  I have made my piece with God, and I am speaking as an ex-Sunday school teacher who sang in the church choir.  It has been my experience that the women wanting to date me are romantic and selective.  My experiences with men were quite the opposite.  I wish that I was lying when I said that, but it is very much the truth.  Men really made me feel like dating them was like dating the Discovery Chanel.  I bet that you can guess why.  Where is the morality of that?    </p>
<p>I am not trying to be offensive here; but, yes, sir, I do support same-sex marriage, which I do not think is bad for children.  Lesbian couples are almost as likely to have children as heterosexual couples.  I have seen many a girlfriend step up and take responsibility after fathers just wouldn&rsquo;t and had left children before the mothers started lesbian relationships.  Women with no biological relationship to the children often do more to ensure the children&rsquo;s well-being than the biological father.  Sadly, I am still speaking the truth 100%.  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to live under my father&rsquo;s &#8220;protection&#8221; to be safe.  I just need to avoid the company of men who relate to women in only one way.  I have never felt unsafe around gay men.  Think about that.  I am not a violent person by nature, but I have all of the protection that a woman needs.  You can&rsquo;t rape a .38.       </p>

		<p>The agenda here seems to be that homosexuals are innocent victims of society (in the good vs bad write up), when the reality is they&rsquo;ve been some of the most notorious criminals on record. I also find it hard to believe lesbians are less likely to steal, maim and murder than are straight women. In modern Ameria however, some citizens are judged to be more equal than others.</p>

Has anyone claimed they were?   I don&rsquo;t remember reading anything like that.</p>
<p>So, basically, they are just people.  I think that is all they want to be.</p>
