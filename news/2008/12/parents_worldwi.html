<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-world-europe/20081211/EU.Barack.Babies/">Parents Worldwide Inspired to Name Kids for Obama</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, December 11, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>By his own admission, Barack Obama was &#8220;a skinny kid with a funny name,&#8221; but that isn&rsquo;t stopping proud parents from Romania to Indonesia from naming their newborns after the U.S. president-elect.</p>
<p>Romania&rsquo;s downtrodden Gypsies &mdash; once enslaved, like African-Americans, yet still struggling to overcome deep-seated prejudice &mdash; seem particularly inspired.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I saw Obama on TV, my heart swelled with joy. I thought he was one of us Gypsies because of his skin color,&#8221; said Maria Savu, whose infant grandson &mdash; Obama Sorin Ilie Scoica &mdash; was born in the central Romania village of Rusciori.</p>
<p>Little Obama is the third child of a poor family that barely gets by on 200 lei ($66) a month in welfare benefits.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s victory also moved Sugiarto, a 36-year-old security guard in Jakarta, Indonesia, and his wife, Sularsih, to name their new son after him.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;He&rsquo;s great, isn&rsquo;t it?&#8221; said Sularsih, 34, rubbing the cheek of their sleeping 1-month-old, Husein Obama. &#8220;I think it&rsquo;s a beautiful name for him. And who knows? Maybe one day he&rsquo;ll be president of Indonesia.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Americans also have been naming children for Obama. Patrick and Sasha Hall Fisher of Hollywood, Florida, are credited as being the first: Sanjae Obama Fisher was born a few hours before news outlets declared Obama to be the new president-elect.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And in Brazil, at least eight black candidates took advantage of a quirk in electoral laws and opted to have their names appear as &#8220;Barack Obama&#8221; in October elections.</p>
<p>In Romania, Banel Nicolita, a member of Romania&rsquo;s national soccer team, is a Gypsy who comes from a family of eight who once lived in a house made of mud. His accomplishments, against all odds, have earned him the nickname &#8220;the Obama of Romanian football.&#8221;</p>

		<p>What a gem this article is!</p>
<p>&#8220;Romania&rsquo;s downtrodden Gypsies &mdash; once enslaved, like African-Americans, yet still struggling to overcome deep-seated prejudice &mdash; seem particularly inspired.&#8221;</p>
<p>When did they ever have time to be &#8220;enslaved?&#8221; Was it in between migrating to Europe from India, or stealing white Christian babies? </p>
<p>Give me a break!</p>
<p>One wonders, do the Gypsies also name all their first born daughters Cher, because of this song:</p>

		<p>Hey, all things considered, particularly if you have read some of his &#8220;writings,&#8221; maybe General Secretary-elect Obama should change his name to Cher? He is all about &#8220;change after all.</p>
<p>Enjoy:</p>

		<p>So what is new?  France is &#8220;inspired&#8221; to cheat their procliamed &#8220;beauty&#8221; pageant in order to have a Black American Miss France.  And have you noticed CNN newscasts lately, they are moving in more and more mulatto male newscasters to match with their usual beautiful White female newscasters.  I have seen them joke and briefly hold hands on the air.  Anything for increasing viewership.  But even Fox News has a couple token mulatto males now.  Are humans really this simple, really this blind to the overt racism of these moves even as they claim to be fighting &#8220;racism?&#8221;</p>

		<p>They&rsquo;re &#8220;still struggling to overcome deep-seated prejudice&#8221; so they give their kid a funny name? Does that follow? Does that even make sense? It seems to me they&rsquo;re rubbing people&rsquo;s faces in their &#8220;differentness.&#8221; Maybe others might judge them for a reason.</p>
<p>And, in spite of all this Obama worship, I wonder if he might become the first single term president in 16 years? There are an awful lot of expectations &mdash; very high ones &mdash; being placed on him, in a very tough economy. Of course the media would be horrified at the thought of him becoming a single-termer. I can see the headlines now: &#8220;The return of racism!&#8221; Nevertheless, a strong campaign could unseat him if he puts in a lackluster performance.</p>

Even Romanian Gypsies? Obama must be mighty proud. Getting jealous here.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought he was one of us Gypsies because of his skin color&#8221; </p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve been told so many times before: &#8220;It&rsquo;s not about race&#8221;</p>
<p>Does anyone (other than deluded whites) REALLY want a colorblind society? Or isn&rsquo;t it rather that whites only are discouraged from pursuing their common interests as a group?</p>

		<p>   I&rsquo;m from Romania and let me tell you: Gypsies are like naming their children from all kind of crazy thing . In the seventies there were a series of Three Musketeers movies and it left us with a lot of d&rsquo;Artagnan and Aramis running around. Now in fashion are South American soap operas with names like  Edmundo, Esmeralda and other stuff. </p>

		<p>This is not surprising considering the fact that third world throwbacks also commonly name their spawn &#8220;Kalatch&#8221; after the AK-47.  And the Gypsies can thank their criminal behaviour for being the reason all societies have despised them throughout history&hellip; </p>

		<p>Foreigners naming kids after american presidents is not new,, just that this pres is different is new. In a latin country I once met Richard Nixon   &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  . His mom named him after the then pres. I have also heard that there were some hispanic kids with Roosevelt name in past times. But personally,,, if I were a kid with a choice,,,, I had rather be Nixon, Roosevelt,, Bush,, even Clinton than BO..  Kingfish</p>

		<p>&#8220;&ldquo;Romania&rsquo;s downtrodden Gypsies &mdash; once enslaved, &#8220;</p>
<p>Gypsies were never enslaved.  In fact, during the 17th and 18th centuries, British gypsies made a good living kidnapping British children to sell to ship captains from sale as indentured servants in the American colonies.</p>
<p>This is not a myth or a canard.  It is the truth.  The famous economist Adam Smith was one of those children kidnapped by Gypsies. destined to be shipped to the colonies as an indentured servant.  His parents hired a bounty hunter who tracked him down and rescued him.</p>
<p>The fact that there were someone made a living rescuing children kidnapped by Gypsies for the colonial slave market shows the practice was widespread.</p>

		<p>I recently had a conversation with a man who just returned from Hungary after living there for 3 years.</p>
<p>He tells me that the Gypsies are exploiting and mistreating each other.  The Gypsies live on welfare.  On the day the welfare checks come, the alpha gypsy gangsters take the money from the other gypsies leaving them nothing to live on.  So the majority of gypsies are starving if they can&rsquo;t steal.</p>
<p>He also told me that the gypsies have established no-go areas for Hungarians.  These areas are rural.  Only Gypsies live there. These are not government created areas.  The gypsies established these areas.  He tells me that the poverty in these rural gypsy ghettoes is more like India than anything in Europe.</p>
<p>The poverty is due to the gangster gypsies taking the welfare money from the rest of the gypsies leaving them unhoused, unfed and wretched.</p>
<p>Sometimes stereotypes are true.</p>

		<p>Gypsies are criminals, plain and simple. I was in Naples this year when one of them was caught stealing a baby.  People retaliated and burned down their settlement.  In Rome, one was caught shoplifting and the police were called in amid a fight.  Gypsies are the most ungrateful people. Italy was kind enough to allow them in and the Gypsies have reciprocated by committing crimes against the Italians. I hope all of them are deported to Siberia.</p>

		<p>I am living (well I am a native) in Hungary, which has a boarder with Romania, so I think I am quite familiar with the situation here in eastern europe.</p>
<p>It is a lie that the gypsies were one enslaved by evil whites. They were never, not even in Romania. gypsies are a nomadic folk, they have no homeland, they were always traveling in small groups from one community from they were cast out to the other and so on. They were cast out because they whole culture was based on the body of the community like a tapeworm. They commited many rapes homicides robbery etc for the time tere have been here. Things havent changed in hundreads of years. Its really the same. Two days ago a US citizen girl was raped in the center of our capitol (Budapest) by 5 gipsy.</p>

		<p>Gypsies - who were never enslaved - have been nothing but a curse upon Europe since they first intruded on that continent. Europe would be a million times better off without them. How many Gypsy scientists, artists or great writers can you think of?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve just had my very liberal mother staying with me for a couple of days and of course she is excited about Obama and has  brought into the mass marketing hype. Where all of his short commings are positives etc. And she says things like &#8220;he is a great leader&#8221;(with no future tense), but has nothing to validate statements like that with.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not my point.<br>
This is a game you can play at home with the liberals you know.</p>
<p>I noticed that in the heat of battle that if you through in a couple of Osama Bin Laden&rsquo;s in when talking about Obama/Osama/Obama. That you end up getting statements thrown back at you like &#8220;I am glad that we voted in Obama bin Laden&#8221; or &#8220;Osama is a fresh start&#8221; &hellip;..(he sure is)! <br>
It made me smile.<br>
&#8220;Yes we must hunt down and punish that Obama for 9/11&#8221;.</p>
<p>Ted Kennedy odviousily has the same problem with those Muslim words rolling off the tongue.</p>

<p>Posted by Concerned European at 11:26 PM on December 11 </p>
<p>&gt; The deeper problem of a &#8220;colorblind society&#8221; is that one must become blind to many other no-brainer, common sense survival mechanisms and socialization skills.</p>
