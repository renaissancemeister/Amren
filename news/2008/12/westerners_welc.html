			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daniel Pipes, Washington Times, December 7, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The case involved a Muslim male who drove 64 miles per hour in a 30 mph zone &mdash; usually grounds for an automatic loss of one&rsquo;s driving license. The defendant&rsquo;s lawyer explained his client&rsquo;s need to speed: &#8220;He has one wife in Motherwell and another in Glasgow and sleeps with one one night and stays with the other the next on an alternate basis. Without his driving license he would be unable to do this on a regular basis.&#8221; Sympathetic to the polygamist&rsquo;s plight, the judge permitted him to retain his license.</p>
<p>Monogamy, this ruling suggests, long a foundation of Western civilization, is silently eroding under the challenge of Islamic law. Should current trends continue, polygamy could soon be commonplace.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some imams openly acknowledge conducting polygamous marriage ceremonies: Khalil Chami reports he is asked almost weekly to conduct such ceremonies in Sydney. Aly Hindy reports having &#8220;blessed&#8221; more than 30 such nuptials in Toronto.</p>
<p>Social acceptance is also growing. Academics justify it, while politicians blithely meet with polygamists or declare Westerners should &#8220;find a way to live with it&#8221; and journalists describe polygamy with empathy, sympathy and compassion. Islamists argue polygamy&rsquo;s virtues and call for its official recognition.</p>
<p>Polygamy has made key legal advances in 2008. (For fuller details, see my blog, &#8220;Harems Accepted in the West.&#8221;) At least six Western jurisdictions now permit harems on the condition that these were contracted in jurisdictions where polygamy is legal, including India and Muslim-majority countries from Indonesia to Saudi Arabia to Morocco.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At a time when Western marriage norms are already under challenge, Muslims are testing legal loopholes and even seeking taxpayer support for multiple brides. This development has vast significance: Just as the concept of one man, one woman marriage has shaped the West&rsquo;s economic, cultural and political development, the advance of Islamic law (Shariah) will profoundly change life as we know it.</p>

<p>Of course, once you read the story, you find he&rsquo;s only talking about white, Mormon polygamists.  Muslim polygamists, who unlike the Mormons, have high rates of spousal abuse and mutilate the genitalia of their daughters, are not only to be tolerated, but to be encouraged through immigration.</p>

		<p>Polygamy can lead to a higher White birthrate and should be encouraged.</p>
<p>Those who think it&rsquo;s just about sex, don&rsquo;t have a clue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about survival.  Dream about a heaven if you want, but there&rsquo;s never been one iota of proof that you will surive your death except through sending your genes into the next generation.</p>

<p>I will agree with Howard and will do him one better in saying that neither the marriage laws of Islam or the FLDS are rooted in lust.  Our own culture, on the other hand, is strongly influenced by lust and overt sexuality.  Compare the dress of the FLDS women and the women of Iran with that of the average American teenager, then make the same accusation.  </p>
<p>Today, we lack the capacity to understand the origin of such arrangements outside of a rather paranoid notion of &#8220;pedophilia&#8221;   &mdash;   which happens to be a convenient and bulletproof excuse for governments to monitor parents and regulate the internet.  The answer lies in a study of history and culture   &mdash;   fit for a whole anthropology course   &mdash;   not behavioral psychology.  </p>

		<p>Both of the commentors that oppossed my stance were men. You don&rsquo;t know how these women are treated or the long term effects made. It doesn&rsquo;t matter to you as long as they&rsquo;re baby-making machines. But, these new-born whites in large numbers are not the type of whites that you want. Whites of the FLDS don&rsquo;t want anything to do with you. The leaders of most cults claim celibacy for all except for themselves. </p>

		<p>I saw this coming when I noticed the decline of marriage, the state sponsorship of women/babies w/o husbands, the forced adoption of PC sexuality in schools, and now the requirement US relinquishes our Christian foundations for &#8216;other&rsquo; social norms.<br>
US already has over 50 years of rapidly growing state sponsored children. Government has relieved men of their responsibility and they have welcomed it.  Agree with 24/7.<br>

		<p>It amuses me to read comments from men who are so in favor of polygamy - it makes my spidey-sense tingle. That tells me that such posters probably: have a personality disorder, live with Mom, or are addicted to internet dating/foreign bride sites. Any one of those is a major strike in the eyes of a woman; all three is the trifecta from dating Hell.</p>
<p>People today have no idea how to be good husbands or wives; I once thought that I needed to get married NOW or I was a failure as a human being. A few close calls later, I am fine being single because I realize that I am not ready to be married, and in fact may simply not be marriage material. I resent being told what to do, and being expected to be a reticent, graceful home ornament.</p>
<p>And of course no one ever askes the woman if she&rsquo;d like to share; it&rsquo;s assumed that she has no choice but to obey. The one time I found myself in such a situation, that guy quickly found himself on the receiving end of a hearty &#8220;F.U.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The FLDS women are just as bad. Just b/c they aren&rsquo;t plotting to blow up a federal building doesn&rsquo;t make them &#8216;better&rsquo;. The women and girls are brain-washed and abused. They have multiple babies with these men, who then encourage them to get on welfare and make the taxpayers pay for everything from food stamps to healthcare. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the girls don&rsquo;t put the father&rsquo;s name on the birth certificates - so the state can&rsquo;t collect child support from the father. Plus, so the father can keep having sex with minors and have them producing babies. </p>
<p>The problem, I think, is encouraged by the gay marriage issue. People who are for it (gay marriage) say &#8220;Why should we judge? What&rsquo;s so wrong with it?&#8221; Well, that&rsquo;s what the polygamists say. And you can&rsquo;t tell 3 people they can&rsquo;t marry if you&rsquo;re letting 2 men marry each other. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking for these Muslim women to wise up to the fact they&rsquo;ve been duped for thousands of years, and really become acquainted with feminism.</p>
<p>It would be a big surprise to a dedicated male Muslim to walk by a nude bar, look in the window and see his wife bumping and grinding in front of a bunch of lustfilled males, wouldn&rsquo;t it?</p>

		<p>I have a hard time believing that monogamy was a universal Western custom prior to Christianity.  I&rsquo;m no expert but certainly some European peoples practiced polygamy in ancient times and were later forced away from it by Christianity.  </p>

<p>I disagree. Polygamy isn&rsquo;t necessarily the cause of a high birth rate per se, as religiousness in general is. Orthodox Jews, Muslims, and devout Christians all have high birth rates.</p>
<p>The problem I have with polygamy is where it is practiced you invariably have brainwashing of young girls into becoming childbrides and otherwise the general abuse of women. With regards to men, in Mormon areas a big problem is since the available women are monopolized by a few lucky men, the young males are often banished as teenagers and become homeless. It is a sick practice and is alien to the western world. We should not encourge it.<br>

<p>Well, this is an interesting point.  If you say that marriage is discriminatory because it only permits people of the opposite sex to marry, why is it not also discriminatory when it only permits two people to marry?  Charles Krauthammer has a good article on this:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/16/AR2006031601312.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/16/AR2006031601312.html</a></p>
<p>&#8220;What is historically odd is that as gay marriage is gaining acceptance, the resistance to polygamy is much more powerful. Yet until this generation, gay marriage had been sanctioned by no society that we know of, anywhere at any time in history. On the other hand, polygamy was sanctioned, indeed common, in large parts of the world through large swaths of history, most notably the biblical Middle East and through much of the Islamic world.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Lots of American men are what we can call common law polygamists.</p>
<p>They have several long term women with whom they have children who are supported on welfare.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the difference between a British muslim polygamist family with several women and numerous children on welfare and an American polygamist family with several women and numerous children on welfare?</p>
<p>Answer a short, not legally recognized ritual by an Iman.</p>
<p>As far as the FLDS it is true that they are a welfare scam.  The women and children are all supported by welfare and so are the cult leaders indirectly.</p>
<p>The worst thing about the FLDS is what they do to the boys.  </p>
<p>The girls are at least taken care of. The cult leaders don&rsquo;t want to compete with the boys for the girls.  So the boys are generally dumped on the side of a freeway 50 miles away at age 13 or 14.  The children are supposedly home schooled, but they are really uneducated.  They can barely read and know only 2nd grade math.</p>
<p>Social services places the boys in foster homes, but they are completely alone in the world, dumped by their Mothers and the community in which they grew up and too little educated to succeed in high school.</p>
<p>At age 18 when Social Services lets them go, many end up homeless.  If they tried to return to the FLDS community they would be driven away or perhaps even killed by the cult leaders.</p>

<p>Posted by 24/7 at 12:23 AM on December 11 </p>
<p>&gt; I&rsquo;m a man and I agree with you.  Except that I do not quite understand the above sentence.  Natural survival instinct tells us to &#8220;keep the world turning&#8221; by any means, but civilization gives us rules of conduct for the benefit of all - theoretically.  </p>
<p>Although the scenario is different in some aspects with FDLS, the net affect on women and children is certainly abusive.  And some here are forgetting the teen boys who are banished from the &#8220;colonies&#8221; so that elderly perverts can have more young, nubile sex partners.  Tell me how that is any different than an animal in the wild.</p>
<p>Many will quote the Bible for their reasons in discussions such as this one.  I would like to remind them that Lot had children by his own daughters - if we are to believe the text literally.  But today archeologists are proving that big parts of the Bible and especially the Old Testament were completely fabricated as an elaborate foundation myth.  In the end, we must do what makes common sense, not in service to trumpted up belief systems - which are so often twisted into excuses for other-abuse.</p>

<p>I think you are completely wrong.  The gay marriage issue is hardly impacting this problem but is the whipping boy for our own heterosexual failure with marriage.  Straight people have done eons of more damage to the institution of marriage than gays ever could.  Typically, gays provide a scapegoat for all those evangelists who so often get caught with a prostitute, or with another of their own sex, or with their hands deep in the till of their church funds.</p>
<p>The only issue we ought to have with gays is the right to raise children.  How can the State allow such unions to raise a child?  I am a defender for adults choosing their life styles, but I AM against foisting that lifestyle, especially one that extreme onto children.  If you can&rsquo;t produce a child because your partner is the sam sex as you, perhaps you shouldn&rsquo;t fool yourselves into believing that you are the equivilent to a heterosexual couple in regards to child production and rearing.  Sperm access ought to be controlled a little better.</p>
<p>People ought to have to get licences to have children, not get married, for as we have seen for decades, any healthy woman can birth a baby, and many men - far too many father children with multiple partners.  Polygamy? - it is going on unofficially everywhere.</p>

		<p>My family can be traced back to the 1200s but only 8 people remain alive, 2 of them are my children.  My wife&rsquo;s family has only 3 living members and can be traced back to the 1400s.  We wanted more children, at least 6, but nature won&rsquo;t allow my wife to have any more.  And we make fine looking white children, both in advanced classes and both understanding how they rank above the rabble around here.  </p>
<p>People preach to us about adopting and other medical experiments, but I&rsquo;m not going to risk my wife&rsquo;s life when we have 2 healthy children to raise.  And I really don&rsquo;t want disconnected blood lines.  Our only option is polygamy and in America that is complicated, but not impossible.  In legal terms it takes some work, but it can be done and involves the tense issue of divorcing your first wife.  </p>
<p>While you would still toe a legal line, as long as you weren&rsquo;t reaching for government handouts they would likely never notice you.  And if you&rsquo;re raising white children with government handouts, you need to get it in gear before they grow up knowing you did it.  Used to be there was a dividing line.  Now I see white people getting into nicer cars than me after loading up on government groceries.  We are a warrior race, but where is the warrior without his pride?<br>
Grob</p>
<p>While we need more white people on this planet, they need to be of quality.  We have already seen what happens to a race that reproduces for the sheer hell of it and doesn&rsquo;t raise the offspring right.  They become a societal burden, nothing more.  The name  withers and dies.</p>

<p>And of course no one ever askes the woman if she&rsquo;d like to share; it&rsquo;s assumed that she has no choice but to obey. The one time I found myself in such a situation, that guy quickly found himself on the receiving end of a hearty &ldquo;F.U.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hmmm. Maybe you and I should get together and have our own household of women, since all the men out there are either 1)normal and married 2) wimps 3) fat and lazy, obsessed and distracted with sports, porn and the non-existent, &#8220;perfect&#8221; woman 4)have no interest in being a good Christian, settling down, having children, but want to travel to Thailand and chase after immoral sluts for the rest of their lives. </p>

		<p>Sure.  Polygamy should be legal because &#8220;guys&#8221; say it&rsquo;s a good thing.  Does it occur to you &#8220;guys&#8221; that legal polygamy is just another step toward Islamification of the US?  Duh?</p>
<p>The sexes are divided pretty evenly, roughly 50/50, right?  What invariably happens when men &#8220;have&#8221; multiple wives?  Other men go without. Men are very picky about sharing their harems, you know, and more is better. The rich and powerful get all the wives. The reality is that most of you &#8220;guys&#8221; who are for polygamy are the same ones who would be going without. </p>
<p>There is NO advanced culture that practices polygamy.  None.  </p>
<p>And isn&rsquo;t American Renaissance about supporting Traditional American Culture?</p>

		<p>Anything that will increase the white birthrate is good.  Anything that will drop it is bad. I hear some whites talking about breeding for &#8220;quality.&#8221;  Forget it.  We don&rsquo;t need eugenics in any form right now; we just need raw numbers of us. The quality will come with the numbers.</p>
<p>Until we start breeding as we once did, we&rsquo;re going to be a contracting people instead of an expanding people and we&rsquo;re going to just keep whining about &#8220;them&#8221; taking over our lands.  You bet they are, and that&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re out breeding us.</p>
<p>I even hear some whites saying they&rsquo;re not ready for marriage or they haven&rsquo;t found the right one or they don&rsquo;t want to have large families that will be a burden on society.  I say, &#8220;Are you nuts?&#8221;  You better quickly learn the lessons of nature or you&rsquo;re going to be extinct.</p>
<p>We no longer have the luxury of being geographically and reproductively isolated from &#8220;them.&#8221;  We can&rsquo;t go back to the two family 1950&rsquo;s white family norm.  We&rsquo;re in a new world and in a new reality and the one who dies with the most kids wins.</p>

<p>In the case of the muslim world things work themselves out. The sheiks and religious leaders have 10 or 20 wives and live out every man&rsquo;s fantasy, while on the other hand huge droves of homicidal male virgins are driven to bitter sex-deprived despair, making them easily persuaded to blow up buses and fire rocket propelled grenades at US Army convoys just so they can finally get laid in that great harem in the sky.  Its win win for Muslim extremists.</p>

I do not believe that this world was meant to last forever. We humans were given a chance to try things our way and look what we&rsquo;ve created. We chose a human king and that has gotten us nowhere. Things are too far gone. I&rsquo;m not saying roll over and die. I stand up for myself. I speak and do what I think should be said and done. I&rsquo;m not meek. I don&rsquo;t believe wants me to be meek in all situations. </p>
<p>I believe there is a Heaven. I believe that Jesus(New Testament) is the Son of God, God in flesh on earth to be a sacrifice to save us for our sins, if one believes this. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m no Bible-beater. I can&rsquo;t quote much of the Bible. The use of &#8216;turn the other cheek&rsquo; will forever be misconstrued. I believe there will always be something greater than any philosophy, theory, or human point of view; God (as described above). </p>
<p>There comes a point where I can no longer argue with one on this website. There is something more powerful than one&rsquo;s mind; a Spirit, a Presence, a conscience from God, a true heart for God. </p>

<p>I have heard this argument before and it is simply not right. The marriage rate in the USA has never been lower   &mdash;   it fell below 50 percent in 2006, from a NY Times story I found.  The proportion of single adults has never been higher.  Even were there a severe shortage of marriageable people, those men who &#8220;would be going without,&#8221; as you said, could just send for a mail-order bride, as thousands of lonely men already do. </p>
<p>I am personally against legal recognition for polygamy in the US for the practical reason that it would be exploited overwhelmingly by Muslims   &mdash;   not because I think it&rsquo;s inherently a bad idea.  Same-sex marriage is far more objectionable to me, since homosexuals would claim the benefits of marriage without the responsibility of child-rearing (in most cases).   </p>
<p>But &hellip; if you accept the same-sex argument that marriage is about love and the freedom to marry whomever you want, I cannot see the rationale for preventing a woman from marrying the man of her choice, simply because that man already happens to be married to another women, and all three consent to the arrangement.  </p>

<p>Does this statistic refer to just White Americans or all Americans?  And if it&rsquo;s from the NYT, you better check the data for yourself.</p>
<p>I was being a bit tongue-in-cheek about the harems, but just do some studying on what actually happens in polygamous societies.  Greed and territorial instincts kick in big-time. Depending on the culture, rape becomes rampant and/or women become hyper-controlled commodities- wearing burquas and being stoned to death.  Honor killings. Etc.  </p>
<p>I will stand by my point, but concede you this in part:  MORE men will be ordering mail-order brides, which further degrades American culture.  Would they be Filipino, or Asian?  &#8220;Russian,&#8221; you say.  How lovely:  </p>
<p>&#8220;Mom, how did you and Daddy meet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He chose me out of a catalogue, sweetheart.  It&rsquo;s taken me six years to learn to like him, but he&rsquo;s ok.  At least he doesn&rsquo;t beat me!&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps you would attack this problem by fixing the number of legal wives at a particular figure.  Say four.  That sounds reasonable.  How Muslim of you!</p>
<p>In general, polygamy is NOT European.  JUST SAY NO TO ISLAMIFICATION OF AMERICA.</p>

		<p>Thanks for the link, Schoolteacher.  I am familiar with Professor McDonald&rsquo;s work, but the ultimate lesson   &mdash;   from a 21st century perspective   &mdash;   seems to be that Europeans sacrificed themselves demographically to attain the material comforts and legal rights they have today.  The problem being of course, that these comforts are attractive to non-European groups, while the universalization of rights denied Europeans the moral authority to exclude these groups.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of the &#8220;free rider&#8221; problem on a global scale, and with a timeline of millenia.  The question I&rsquo;d wonder about is whether it would be possible to attain the comforts through demographic control <i>without</i> the catastrophic expansion of &#8220;rights.&#8221;  Maybe China is an example of how this may in the end be a plausible and more successful (successful in a Darwinian sense!) model.</p>

		<p> Um, I really don&rsquo;t get the argument that polygamy produces more children.  So one man has 5 wives, and each wife has four children.  20 children total.  How is that different from 5 men having one wife each and each wife producing four children?  When one man has 5 wives, that means that 4 men have no wives.  </p>
<p>Polygamy is just an excuse for a few powerful men to control everyone else. They control not only the women and girls, but also the majority of the men.  By definition, polygamous societies have to throw out the vast majority of the males.  </p>
<p>Polygamy is bad for every single person except for a select few males.  If it truly were an arrangement among consenting adults, then I wouldn&rsquo;t care.  But the reality is, the way its practiced today, it absolutely is not like that.</p>
<p>And if you have every wondered how all those FDLS men support their 25 children working construction, it&rsquo;s because they don&rsquo;t.  We, the taxpayer, pay for every single last &#8220;wife&#8221; and child, with perhaps the exception of one legal wife and her children.  </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let polygamists fool you.  They are not replenishing the earth or keeping the white race alive.  They are the absolute lowest of the low.</p>
<p>And if the white race will only live on through these people and their &#8220;values,&#8221; they god help me, but I would rather it didn&rsquo;t live on at all. </p>

<p>Sheesh!  From what little non-biased information I can glean about the FLDS it at least seems that 1) they value hard, manual work   &mdash;   a rare trait among whites these days (at least they ARE working, as you admit), 2) they value childbearing (lots of kids, as you admit), and 3) they are conservative in dress and manners in a way that is reminiscent of other conservative religious groups such as the Amish, Hutterites and Hasidic Jews.  Their society seems to have been very successful at both reproduction and material gain.  </p>
<p>If they are on public assistance   &mdash;   so what?  Either the marriage is recognized, in which case they get certain benefits, or they are not married, in which case the women are legally single mothers.  Otherwise they&rsquo;d be denied the benefits of both marriage and single motherhood.  And to be totally honest, if the state is going to be supporting single mothers at all, I&rsquo;d much prefer to have my tax dollars going to help out white kids rather than blacks in the projects.  </p>

<p>But today archeologists are proving that big parts of the Bible and especially the Old Testament were completely fabricated as an elaborate foundation myth.

<p>I agree with the second part of your post. I can&rsquo;t prove or disprove the old testament. What I CAN do is remember that it reflects beliefs, customes and cultures as they were 3000 years ago. Some of those ideas/beliefs were extraordinary then and are relevant to human life even now, others are irrelevant.</p>

<p>Well actually in most Muslim countries the wives have the men sign marriage contracts, which designates them as the only wife (which is why it is not all that common to have multiple wives in countries like Iran). Islamic scholars suspect Mohammed&rsquo;s first wife, Kadesha (a smart older businesswoman) had him sign such a contract, so apparently it was going on even back then.</p>
<p>Maybe I am not romantic enough, but I could see the benefits of it. Some women find their children are the greatest loves of their life, Muslim polygamy means the husband must provide each wife with a separate house and support her and their children. <br>
I could see it working well for some people. Sort of like eternal &ldquo;dating&rdquo; if the husband is only around a couple nights a week. I would think in many cases the wives prepare in advance and look forward to it. If they don&rsquo;t like their husband that much, then he is not around that much, if they do like him then they can look forward to anticipating their nights together. Though I do feel bad for Osama Bin Laden&rsquo;s wives, no doubt they are taken care of but having the husband live in a cave for 8 years cannot be easy.</p>
<p>I am sure ancient humans practiced polygamy all the time, it fits in with survival of the fittest. The alpha males can support more mates and produce the most children in those environments. </p>
<p>On that subject though, the Mormon cults that practice polygamy are often totally different. They truly are cults and because the leading males want multiple wives, they apparently can shun the younger males and cast them out onto the street. In a closed environment like a relatively small cult, polygamy can be a huge problem.<br>

		<p>I got a hearty laugh from some of the women on this thread talking about how men are either &#8220;normal and married&#8221;, &#8220;wimps&#8221;, &#8220;into porn&#8221;, &#8220;fat and lazy&rsquo; etc. Did it ever occur to these luscious ladies that the reason they&rsquo;re single might be because they&rsquo;re just not that desirable- either physically or tempermentally? It&rsquo;s easy to castigate the opposite sex for their flaws but often we find the cause of our &#8220;problem&#8221; by simply looking into the mirror - in both the literal and metaphorical sense. Btw, I also think men engage in this type of behavior when judging women.</p>

		<p>Baboons practice polygamy, too.  And all other manner of violent and stupid beasts do.  Most of those animals are on the verge of extinction&hellip;.threatened by primarily monogamous humans.  The most monogamous are the Asians, who seem to be out-breeding us all.  As Dr. Philippe Rushton has pointed out, the Asian strategy (monogamy, intelligence, diligence, and prudence) is the most successful for population increase.  But there&rsquo;s only so much room on this rock, and too much &#8216;increase&rsquo; is maybe not such a great idea.</p>
<p>We whites would not need to increase our numbers (and we could go on enjoying our nice roomy country and our high standard of living) if we were not being overrun with people who breed irresponsibly.</p>
<p>FINALLY there may be a positive use for those new state laws defining marriage as between a(one) man and a(one) woman.  Then again, as other posters have pointed out, anti-polygamy legislation seems only to apply to white Christians.  In fact, all laws now seem to apply just to whites.</p>
