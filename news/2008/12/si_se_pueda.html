			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Adam Lynch, Jackson (Mississippi) Free Press, December 10, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Protestors, some of them children, marched on the state Capitol last Thursday, holding signs reading &#8220;Working should not be a crime,&#8221; &#8220;Raids tear families apart,&#8221; and &#8220;Si se pueda&#8221; (&#8220;Yes we can&#8221;). About 50 immigrants and immigrant-rights advocates protested recent raids on undocumented workers at a factory in Laurel and the passage of Senate Bill 2988, a new law making it illegal for undocumented workers to be employed in the state.</p>
<p>Mississippi Immigrants Rights Alliance Executive Director Bill Chandler called the law, known as the Mississippi Employment Protection Act, the &#8220;ethnic cleansing act.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sen. Giles Ward, R-Louisville, said he supported the bill not for any philosophical reason, such as preserving jobs for Mississippians over immigrants. Instead, he said he needed no reason beyond the vehement demand of his constituents.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Chandler called upon the &#8220;new federal government,&#8221; under President-elect Barack Obama &mdash; who drew tremendous applause at the mention of his name &mdash; to end the raids and repeal SB 2988.</p>
<p>Frank Curiel, vice-president of the Laborers International Union, summed up both the raids and the Mississippi law as products of racial discrimination.</p>
<p>&#8220;It discriminates because we don&rsquo;t look like the governor; we don&rsquo;t look like most of the Republicans who voted for this bill, but I tell you this much: I&rsquo;m a veteran; my brothers are veterans. I grew up in a house full of veterans,&#8221; Curiel said. &#8220;We served this country. We pay more than our due, yet when times get hard, what do they do? They give us the raids.&#8221;</p>
<p>Curiel said whites in the Senate feared making way for the influence of a new race: &#8220;You know why they have the raids? Because they don&rsquo;t want to see people like us take over this house.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>During the special session, Sen. Robert Jackson, D-Marks, offered an amendment to SB 2005 to eliminate the criminal penalties for workers, but the Senate voted down the amendment and passed SB 2005 in the slanted form that died in a House committee.</p>

&ldquo;We served this country. We pay more than our due&hellip;&#8221; <br>
The government aid immigrants receive and the costs of their crimes vastly outweigh the little contribution they make through taxes (for the small amount of immigrants that actually pay taxes). So what if a few serve in th armed forces. My ancestors have served in America&rsquo;s armed forces since the revolution. America&rsquo;s true veterans and patriots are turning in their graves&hellip;</p>

		<p>Mississippi is 37 percent black, 59 percent white.  I hope the black 37 percent is grateful that their jobs will not be stolen by illegals.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sen. Giles Ward, R-Louisville, said he supported the bill not for any philosophical reason, such as preserving jobs for Mississippians over immigrants. Instead, he said he needed no reason beyond the vehement demand of his constituents.&#8221;</p>
<p>This means that constant pressure on legislators about immigration has some good effects.  Enforcement is another issue, but this is a good start.</p>
<p>&#8220;Frank Curiel, vice-president of the Laborers International Union, summed up both the raids and the Mississippi law as products of racial discrimination.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the earlier part of the 20th century the labor unions were active in pushing for the 1924 immigration restriction bill.  During the depression, labor unions put a lot of pressure on congress to enforce and uphold immigration restrictions.</p>
<p>Times have changed.  In the past, unions looked out for the best interests of their members.  This included blocking the floods of cheap labor employers wanted to bring in.  Even Chavez&rsquo; United Farm Worker&rsquo;s wanted to keep mexican farm laborers out.</p>
<p>Times have changed.  Union leaders have now the joined the employers in their efforts to drive wages down to the lowest level of subsistence.</p>
<p>Good for the legislature of Mississippi.  They listened to the people they were elected to serve, not the Ford Foundation.</p>
<p>How soon before Morris Dees, Mark Potik and Abe Foxman put every legislator who voted against the hiring of illegals on their list of evil doers of hate crime?</p>
<p>I imagine one of the Ford Foundation racist hispanic groups has already filed a lawsuit to overturn this law.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s a link to more (Sept. 8, 2008) information about Bill Chandler and the MIRA (Mississippi Immigrants Rights Alliance). Apparently they are a &#8220;grantee&#8221; of an organization called JFSJ.</p>
<p>https://www.jspot.org/showDiary.do?diaryId=1984</p>
<p> From the website:</p>
<p>     &#8220;I am one of the two new Grantmaking Fellows at JFSJ, and in response to Hurricane Gustav, I got in touch with two of our grantees in the region: Bill Chandler at the Mississippi Immigrants&rsquo; Rights Alliance (MIRA)&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>   At one point, Bill Chandler who is discussing Hurricane Gustav, writes:</p>
<p>-In terms of the hurricane, they dealt with the failure of the state of Mississippi to notify people in Spanish and Vietnamese, which was a big problem.  Mississippi public radio, which is their NPR affiliate, is supposed to be the source for this, but it draws mostly a white audience and programs exclusively in English.  They had serious problems getting emergency announcements on the radio in Spanish, and no success at all in Vietnamese.&#8221;</p>
<p>   Are there that many people from Vietnam in Mississippi????</p>

<p>Sounds like a bait and switch to me. If Mississippi is 59% white and 37% black, the state must only be around 4% &#8216;other&rsquo;. Thanks for taking a stand against racial dispossession Mr. Ward. All you need now is a place for your &#8216;Mission Accomplished&rsquo; sign. </p>

		<p>Even the Mexican-American labor leader, Caesar Chevez, was opposed to illegal aliens flooding the labor market and destroying wages and working conditions.</p>
<p>The modern &#8220;labor leaders&#8221; do not have a problem with cheap, coolie labor flooding the workplace and destroying the jobs, incomes, housing, and futures of union members. What a queer world we have created in my lifetime. Too many of the modern &#8220;labor leaders&#8221; are not interested in promoting the interests of union members, they are communists, advocating for international labor, and globalists. That is why they have no problem with big business sending jobs to cheap-labor countries.</p>

		<p>Agree with RHG.  I am very sure the blacks and hispanics and anyother groups trying to usurp American power would not give whites the time of day let alone equality.  Equality was a white invention. The USA was happy and secure until all this wacko diversity, civil rights (minority preferences) and mass immigrations moved into US to take all they can get.  I do not feel safe with radical/immigrants who make racists remarks about white people.  I have already been robbed and cheated out of my heritage because violent racists extort, burn, kill and threaten whites if we do not give them what they want.  This is not freedom this is tyranny!     Vickie</p>

		<p>People like comrade Chandler need to seriously be ignored by American citizens. These supporters of illegal immigration, are literally criminals as defined by existing immigration law, Title 8, section 1325 of the United States Immigration Law Code. Furthermore, the comrade Chandler types know they are violating the law, they just don&rsquo;t care.</p>

		<p>The modern trade union movement (at least in Britain) has very, very little to do with fighting the workers&rsquo; corner.<br>
Apart from trade unionists not esconced in cushy jobs in the non-productive public sector (it is actually debatable whether to call such salaried employees &#8216;workers&rsquo; at all), the modern British trade union movement represents only a very small fraction of the actual blue-collar workforce - and due to Maggie Thatcher&rsquo;s legislation, they have essentially been emasculated as aserious force in British politics.<br>
 But somehow union bureaucracies still exist (staffed in the main by people who have never done a day&rsquo;s graft in their lives), and like all bureaucracies there main concern is self-preservation and self-preservation.So to this end, the unions have largel explicitly abandone policies that would help their dues payers (ie restricting immigration and the labor supply), but fight out silly liitle sub-university Marxist ideas with their members money (most union leaders joined the union bureaucracy straight out of university and never left the debating chamber behind).<br>
 Hence we have the hypocrisy and absurdity of Britain&rsquo;s union leaders being the loudest voices in support of an illegal immigrant &#8216;amnesty&rsquo; - policy in direct contravention of their members&rsquo; interests and in direct support of &#8216;rapacious capitalistic fat-cats&rsquo;.</p>

		<p><i>&#8220;Mississippi Immigrants Rights Alliance Executive Director Bill Chandler called the law, known as the Mississippi Employment Protection Act, the &ldquo;ethnic cleansing act.&rdquo;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>So, not allowing people into your country qualifies as &#8220;ethnic cleansing&#8221;? Damn, let&rsquo;s examine the world using that definition and see how much &#8220;ethnic cleansing&#8221; there is going on about that supports the arguments against the current anti-whiteness! We white nations let in anybody. Everybody else? Not so much.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this ridiculous definition is considered, but those who suggest as ethnic cleansing the mass immigration of non-whites into the United States and the resultant white displacement and eventual extinction, <i>actually crowed about by a president</i>, are considered racist nutcases or somesuch?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to find what Clinton said verbatim, but could only find people saying what he said. &#8220;I welcome the day the US becomes majority non-white,&#8221; or something to the same effect.</p>
<p>Not ethnic cleansing, that?</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&ldquo;It discriminates because we don&rsquo;t look like the governor; we don&rsquo;t look like most of the Republicans who voted for this bill, but I tell you this much: I&rsquo;m a veteran; my brothers are veterans. I grew up in a house full of veterans,&rdquo; Curiel said. &ldquo;We served this country. We pay more than our due, yet when times get hard, what do they do? They give us the raids.&rdquo;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t give him, his veteran brothers and veteran household raids, we give the <i>illegal immigrants</i> raids. Somehow, the two parties happen to get confused. Do you suppose it could be because of the <i>flagrant attempt at disinformation</i> he made?</p>
<p>And in the article generally, there is the usual insinuation that whites refusing to compromise the conditions they desire, refusing to compromise their culture, is immoral, while it goes unmentioned that prompting the demands for compromise are minorities refusing to compromise their own, which is by going unmentioned suggested free of the immorality it has when whites do the same. I got news for you, blacks and hispanics and whoever: if it is immoral for whites to demand their preferred conditions of others, then it is just as immoral for those others to demand their preferred conditions of whites.<br>

		<p>Mr Chandler, I think your statement about &#8220;ethnic cleansing&#8221; could well be turned around. I would say it applies to the replacement of law-abiding, tax-paying, loyal Americans by criminal illegal aliens. Now, that&rsquo;s ethnic cleansing!</p>

<p>   In my opinion, this is just another example of the police state that is now emerging in this country. First it&rsquo;s drunk driving checkpoints, then it&rsquo;s seatbelt checkpoints, then it&rsquo;s insurance and license checkpoints then it&rsquo;s what any other reason they can come up with. </p>
<p>    Of course, all of these sound nice and reasonable but what they are really doing is stopping Americans who aren&rsquo;t doing anything wrong and interfering with their right to travel along a street without being stopped and questioned.</p>
<p>    This is the sort of thing that happens in third-world countries with dictatorships and corrupt governments. Having it happen in the United States is not a good sign of things to come.</p>
<p>    As a side note, the border patrol checkpoints on major freeways in California always make me angry also because they stop Americans who aren&rsquo;t doing anything wrong for the supposed purpose of stopping illegal aliens. What a joke. As if anything even happens to those illegal aliens anything other than they are released back into the population.</p>
<p>   Furthermore, why should American drivers be inconvenienced by these checkpoints in the first place? Just shut the border down entirely and that solves the problem. Of course, we know that will never happen but the whole thing is just so unfair.</p>

		<p>&#8221;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A few months ago I was driving on a two lane highway in Mississippi and hit a police roadblock, checking ID&rsquo;s. At first I was upset about the inconvenience, but after some thought agreed this is a very good thing, keep out rabble.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this is just another example of the police state that is now emerging in this country. First it&rsquo;s drunk driving checkpoints, then it&rsquo;s seatbelt checkpoints, then it&rsquo;s insurance and license checkpoints then it&rsquo;s what any other reason they can come up with.</p>
<p>Of course, all of these sound nice and reasonable but what they are really doing is stopping Americans who aren&rsquo;t doing anything wrong and interfering with their right to travel along a street without being stopped and questioned.</p>

<p>Those DUI/seatbelt/whatever checkpoints are blatantly unconstitutional - it is a presumption of guilt and an unreasonable search.  You are right that this is the sign of a creeping police-state.</p>

<p>So is importing them in the first place.</p>
