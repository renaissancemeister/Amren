<h1>D.C. Cops Accused of Stealing From Toys for Tots</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>William C. Flook, DC Examiner, December 24, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Four D.C. police officers are suspected of stealing toys donated to the Marine Corps&rsquo; Toys for Tots program, police said Wednesday.</p>
<p>No arrests have been made in the incident, which is still under an internal investigation, according to Metropolitan Police Department spokeswoman Traci Hughes. The four officers were operating out of the Sixth District Station in Southeast. They have been taken off the street and put on &#8220;non-contact status.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Metropolitan Police Department has come under fire from community leaders in the crime-ridden sixth district for closing a substation on Pennsylvania Avenue, even as violent crimes are on the rise in the district. The 6th District, which encompasses the area east of the Anacostia River between Good Hope Road and Eastern Avenue, is one of the city&rsquo;s most dangerous.</p>

<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t be dangerous if the area was all white.</p>
<p>Condions like these in all the urban areas of large cities are getting worse no matter what is done.  Nothing works.</p>
<p>Just wait until the economy slides further south, then observe what the recap of these situations tell us.</p>

		<p>The Marines should &#8220;deal with&#8221; those monsters (if those four officers are guilty). Marines are good at destroying the enemy. How can anyone bring themselves to steal from children -especially during the Christmas season?</p>

		<p>And what are the attitudes on the part of parents of Children who aren&rsquo;t getting any toys?  It&rsquo;s probably the usual paranoid D.C. radical black tripe about how evil the white police are, and how more black cops would make everything better.</p>

		<p>Considering the majority of DC cops to be Blacks&hellip; why the surprise? Then again, is this thievery any different from those Black NOLA policemen&hellip; stealing 28 Cadillacs right after Katrina&hellip; supposedly to patrol the city. I am not aware the thieves, I mean police officers, ever returned these stolen cars to the dealership.</p>

		<p>Just enough information for people to feel outraged and self-righteous. Don&rsquo;t expect to hear any more about this, except-of course- if the perps turn out to be white. </p>

		<p>When I was stationed at Fort Leavenworth as Military Police from 2001-2003, we had some Army Reserves come in to man the gates for us since we were only a company sized element. The first group was from Washington D.C and almost all blacks and Military Police as well, with most of them being civilian police officers. During the one year they were there, they committed almost every single offense you could think of except murder (yes there was a rape). Lets just say when they left EVERYONE made sure they all left. The next group was Field Artillery, all white and trust me when I say, they did not commit a single offense(not even minor ones). They were thrown a HUGE PARTY when it was time for them to leave.</p>

		<p>Many posters here are not sure if these cops are white or black.  The way the left wing propaganda machine operates is to continually portray all blacks as innocent little cutie pie victims of white hatred and racism.  So therefore when they never mention the race of the perpetrators you can bet they are black because if they were white they would be sure to say so in BOLD CAPITALIZED PRINT OVER AND OVER AGAIN until the minds of the weak have been totally saturated with their hate whitey agenda. I have seen this over and over and over and it&rsquo;s true without a doubt.    </p>

		<p>They were BLACK police officers&hellip; so why act shocked. Black police officers in NOLA stole some 28 Cadillacs right after Katrina. Ostensibly to patroll New Orleans&rsquo; waterlogged, debris strewn streets. So far, I am unaware these vehicles had ever been returned to the dealership they were stolen from.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;D.C. police officers are suspected of stealing&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police_Department_of_the_District_of_Columbia#Demographics" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police_Department_of_the_District_of_Columbia#Demographics</a></p>
<p>&#8220;The department currently has one of the highest percentages of African American officers amongst United States Police Departments, at 66%. The department is also 28% White, 5% Hispanic, and 1% Asian.&#8221;</p>
<p>It looks like the critical mass of undesirables on the D.C. &#8220;police force&#8221; was breeched long ago. I doubt stealing toys is the worst of the offense that transpires there. </p>
<p>Lest we forget&hellip; D.C. is the murder capital and Black capital of the U.S. It is also the future of America&hellip; just like Africa.<br>

<p>Well, it helps if you&rsquo;re Black. But then Blacks and their anti-social behavior are hardly ever far from the news. Blacks, after all, are responsible for the rapes, killings, genocide, starvation and misery we keep hearing about in far-off Africa.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t lose any sleep over this.  Christmas morning, there was a DC policewoman in a Santa hat on the local news begging po&rsquo; people to come to her Georgia Avenue station and take all the leftover toys off their hands!</p>
<p>According to another heart-warming local TV news story, if you were po&rsquo; but too lazy/stupid to go pick up free toys for your kids in advance, then the DC Post Office delivered them to your door on Christmas Day!</p>
<p>Every Thanksgiving, turkey dinners go to waste because there are not enough po&rsquo; people in DC to eat them all. </p>
<p>I will bet you that many po&rsquo; kids had more toys under their Christmas trees than working class kids did this year.  The &#8220;professionally poor&#8221; have handed down generations of skill and lore in how to milk the system.  The newly laid-off workers don&rsquo;t have the knowledge (and lack of shame) to work the system for all it&rsquo;s worth!</p>

		<p>Why should this be surprising, really? Blacks have been known to steal rings off of dying people&rsquo;s fingers, especially those involved in traffic accidents.</p>

		<p>In many parts of the US prior to the 1950&rsquo;s, the local funeral homes served as ambulance companies. (I don&rsquo;t see a conflict of interest here - do you). Whenever blacks were involved in auto accidents that required a run to the hospital, they would BEG the cops to call a white funeral home. It was known that the black funeral homes would drive these people around until they bled to death. Since funeral home owners were better off than most of the population, generally there was no recourse. Prior to marrying, my mother worked in a hospital in the Atlanta area and told me some stories about the idiocy that would occur on payday/weekends/etc. </p>
<p>I doubt you would ever hear stories like this about the Fargo, ND police department. </p>
