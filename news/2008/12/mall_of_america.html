<h1>Mall of America Moves to Accommodate Minnesota Muslims</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mohamed Hassan, Mshale (Minneapolis), December 13, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Every year, as Muslims in America are compelled to engage in business, work and shopping during the holidays, many find themselves away from mosques and other places where they can hold prayers without interruption. They are forced to seek privacy in corners and alleyways, places that often subject them to unwanted attention. Some Muslims also worry that their repetitive calls of &#8220;Allah akbar!&#8221; (God is great!) during prayers could be misconstrued as calls for Jihad.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This year Muslim leaders from the Twin Cities area were able to persuade MOA, the largest enclosed mall in the United States, to set aside a room for prayers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Mohamed [Fatuma Mohamed, a muslim woman] and other Muslims did not know there was a prayer room, even though MOA and Muslim volunteers had intended to have eight posters in three languages, (English, Somali and Arabic) to be displayed at all entrances to the mall.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Regardless of the glitch, many Muslims appeared excited that the MOA reserved prayer space for them and promised to continue doing so in the future.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sheikh Neelain Muhammad, an imam at the St.Paul-based Da&rsquo;wa Islamic Center, and five other volunteers from the center were among the many volunteers who were at the mall to make sure that day went on without incidents, especially from teenagers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The presence of culturally competent volunteers at the mall avoided the law enforcement solution that often leads to the arrest of Muslim youths.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mahmood Kanyare, one of the community volunteers, said the volunteers reminded the youth about good manners in Islam.</p>

<p>Muslims in America couldn&rsquo;t seem to get away quickly enough from the very kinds of places where they could have done their thing to come to such a restrictive (supposedly) place.</p>
<p>If tens of thousands of Christians moved to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, would their malls be in a hurry to accommodate them?</p>

		<p>So&hellip;a mall that would scacely dream of setting up a Christmas manger scene in this hyper-sensitive age, is perfectly willing to create entire &#8220;prayer rooms&#8221; for Muslims??? </p>
<p>As an aside, I can&rsquo;t even stand Christians who insist upon wearing their faith on their sleeve - I find it positively intolerable in these obnoxious Muslim &#8220;immigrants&#8221; who have been in this country for about a year or two!!   </p>

<p>This has become such a clich√©: young Muslims rioting and violently lashing out just because they feel like it. We can&rsquo;t accommodate these people. They&rsquo;re a hazard.<br>

<p>That&rsquo;s not true at all.  I wouldn&rsquo;t think they were calling for jihad if I heard it.  I&rsquo;d just think they were nuts.  </p>
<p>Like the Hare Krishnas in their peach colored robes, bare feet, shaved heads with pigtails in the center, beating their tambourines, and stopping people on the street asking them to join.</p>
<p>Actually, they would fit right in publicly in L.A., and they wouldn&rsquo;t have to have rooms off to the side.</p>
<p>In L.A. the only people who need private rooms are sane, mainline Christians who might want to sit and quietly contemplate their religion in a civil manner, because they&rsquo;re ridiculed as being weird, but don&rsquo;t count on them being given accomodations like that.</p>

<p>I have said this before and I will say it again now: the West will never be safe until Islam, that cult of &#8220;peace,&#8221; is totally eradicated. They are all double dealing and totally worthless murdering interlopers. </p>

		<p>I live in Minnesota. The experience I have had with Muslims is primarily with schoolchildren; one clearly comes to mind. She is a middle-eastern looking girl of age approx. 10 years. When asked if she was an American ( this during the early weeks of school when songs like &#8220;This land is your land &#8221; were being sung as part of an orientation ) and she said cheekily : &#8220;I am not an American I am a Muslim&hellip;&#8221; and scowled. So, there you go.<br>
 We are in a funnybone spot in this country&rsquo;s history. We import people who don&rsquo;t want to be like us, who self-segregate. An uncomfortable feeling to say the least. Yet, you have to wonder if this self-separation could be turned into a good thing for whites. Possibly; I observe less and less the &#8220;reaching across the aisle&#8221; impulse being acted upon, even at young ages. So maybe this discomfort at the Muslim&rsquo;s separation from us may act as a catalyst for our psychological separation from them and all those we deem the other. Not a bad thing because it is a normal thing; people naturally self-segregate. <br>
American liberal thinking has a central tenet that America is exceptional.The loss of credibilty  of liberal thinking is ocurring because the theory is not predicting how people act when they get here. The immigrants are not &#8220;melting&#8221;; they are not acting exceptionally; rather they are exploding with racial and ethnic pride, or rage, as if the prospect of  American Citizenship weren&rsquo;t really there, as if were an illusion. They want to be hyphenated Americans, at most. They want to be left alone, really. Socialization? Forget it. <br>
 I have said before: citizenship is like a ticket, and it must have a price. If it is valuable the price (loyalty, subservience to the new ethic of the host country, respect for the symbols of the nation, etc.) will be willingly paid; if the citizenship is not valuable the price is low. The object cannot be both valuable and not so at the same time. This dissonance is what is driving the country apart intellectually and should someday drive it apart politically because PEOPLE HAVE TO FEEL VALUABLE.</p>

<p>These are the PERFECT opportunities to exercise your perogative for social ostricism: &#8220;Well, why don&rsquo;t you and your parents leave to a Muslim country, since apparently you have no interest in the welfare of the people who sustain your lifestyle and freedoms.&#8221;</p>

		<p>No, they didn&rsquo;t and they haven&rsquo;t, and what&rsquo;s more, they probably WON&rsquo;T. Even if I go up to them and demand it, in full priestly regalia. (Long black robes, gold crucifix on chain on chest, etc.)</p>
<p>But I will tell you what I DO know. MOA now has stabbings, beatings, muggings, etc. because they linked the &#8216;light rail&rsquo; system to the worst (read, darkest) areas of So Mpls. near Lake St. and Hiawatha. What were these people thinking?</p>
<p>Secondly, we have many other places to shop in the Twin Cities, so, apart from one or two specialty stores this Christmas [!!] season, I never shop there. May the MOA (I call it &#8216;Le Mal D&rsquo;Amerique&rsquo; - which means &#8216;the American Sickness&rsquo;) fall into the sinkhole it has become. NO patronizing that shrine of conspicuous consumption for THIS Minnesotan!</p>

		<p>The Money, The Money, The Money, don&rsquo;t you get it yet? It&rsquo;s ALWAYS about THE MONEY. The mall people could care less about the muslim or any other religion, Christmas is so far from being a Religious Holiday it&rsquo;s unreal. Now we all know the problem but what is THE ANSWER? Write a letter to the owners of the Mall Of America, telling them this. I resent the fact that you bow down to the whims of invaders to our country. I resent the fact that my religious beliefs have No Value, but theirs Must Be Observed. So here is what I plan to do. I will not shop in the Mall of America until you go back to serving the people who built this country. Remove the religious hangouts and until you do, don&rsquo;t blame the economy for your lack of customers, blame yourself for turning your backs on us while bowing down to the whims of the outsider and intruder. THEN DO IT! DON&rsquo;T STEP ONE FOOT INSIDE THEIR MALL OR SPEND ONE PENNY THEIRE. They Will get the message if YOU just have the guts to act insread of just whining..</p>

		<p>Wait until multiculturalism gets past the point of critical mass.  It&rsquo;s good-bye USA folks.  Violence against Whites will become the rule.  What&rsquo;s amazing about the people in Minnesota is the fact that they are the quintessential White Nordics AND they&rsquo;re the most seemingly eager to please in the sense that they are willingly giving up their rights, their identity and their country.  Because they&rsquo;re so White they probably feel the most guilty if they don&rsquo;t fall in line with the diversity lunacy that&rsquo;s taking over elsewhere.  They are probably the least likely to be able to put up any kind of resistance to multiculturalism.  Minnesota has one advantage in the fact that many non-Whites do not like the North simply because of the cold.  But it&rsquo;s not going to keep non-Whites out of places like Minnesota forever.<br>

		<p>So sorry to hear that the Mall of America has hit the skids.  The rail line to the slums is the dumbest idea ever.  Ever.  EVER!   But I hear that MOA is owned by a consortium of Canadians.  Racial suicide seems the new specialty of the Canadian &#8216;elites&rsquo;, so we shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised.</p>
<p>Here in the Deep South, we have very few real blonds. It was such a treat to go to the MOA and see skads of six-foot-tall women with hair that was blonde down to the roots.  Mirabile dictu!  Well, that was the entertainment for my husband and sons.  I was ogling the men: each one bigger and more v-shaped than the last.  </p>
<p>That was a decade back.  I guess that the influx of Garrison Keillor&rsquo;s beloved Somalis and Hmong has changed things a tad.  Even when we were there, we noticed downtown areas being overrun.  These were still visually perfect Minneapolis areas, houses still immaculate, shrubbery still intact&hellip;.but with nonwhites plopped down on the lawns, just a watchin&rsquo; the world go by.  I imagine that by now every bush has been chopped down.  </p>
<p>We spent a lot at MOA, several hundred in the Scandinavian shop, alone.  But having just read about the MOA&rsquo;s &#8216;diversity&rsquo; influx, I doubt we&rsquo;ll return.  It was a treat being around those huge, sweet, GORGEOUS Minnesotans&hellip;enough so to make the trip up there worthwhile.  But no more Mall of America.   I doubt we&rsquo;ll be the only whites never to venture there, again.  Whites: you know, the ones who don&rsquo;t go to the mall to shoot, mug, stab and steal.  I hope the Mall owners like their new demographic.</p>
<p>Funny thing about accomodating other people&rsquo;s religions.  In  Louisiana, there have always been a lot of Orthodox Jews. They have a lot of lifestyle restrictions and inconvenient observance requirements, just like the Muslims.  But never, not even once, have I ever heard of them asking for any sort of special facilities or anything else.  Mostly, I hear about what they&rsquo;ve GIVEN to our communities (schools, hospitals, crisis hotlines).  Why can&rsquo;t the muslims be a model minority, too?  That wasn&rsquo;t really a question.  We all know the answer.</p>

		<p>They should have been told, politely but very firmly:  &#8220;No. Sorry.  We are a shopping mall, and that&rsquo;s all we claim to be. We are NOT a religious institution. We do not provide religious facilities. There are churches, synagogues, mosques, and temples for that purpose.  If you want to pray, go there. That&rsquo;s what they are for. But we are only a commercial center for shopping. You don&rsquo;t demand to go shopping in your mosque;  why would you want to pray in our mall?&#8221;</p>

		<p>Name one positive thing Muslims have contributed to the Western societies they are infesting today.  You can&rsquo;t.  Now contrast this with their endless acts of terrorism and Islamic cultural imperialism.  </p>
<p>The Western politicians who allow these interlopers into their countries are the absolute worst kind of traitors, because they are providing aid and comfort to an enemy that not only strives to posses our nations, but intends to obliterate our religions as well.  These inbred clinically insane Medieval throwbacks want to destroy all non-Muslim secular and sectarian values and replace them with Islam.</p>
<p>Allah is their name for Satan.  Allah is not God.  Allah&rsquo;s messenger Mohammed was a child raping pedophile who married his favorite bride when she turned six and consummated their marriage when she turned nine.  Islam is not a religion of peace.  The Koran is not a holy book.  The Koran is the Book of Satan that ensues conquest, murder, rape and the total acquiescence of ones soul to evil incarnate.</p>
<p>These are the people our politicians are selling their political influence to in exchange for oil money.  These are the people our local politicians and bureaucrats go out of their way to please.  These are the people we must drive from our lands as our ancestors have done repeatedly throughout history.  These are the children of Satan&hellip; <br>
