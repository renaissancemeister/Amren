<h1>Rastafarian Can Sue Over Jiffy Lube Hair Policy</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Denise Lavoie, AP, Dec. 2, 2008  </i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Rastafarian man who refused to shave off his beard or cut his hair to comply with a Jiffy Lube employee grooming policy can take his religious discrimination case to trial, Massachusetts&rsquo; highest court ruled Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Supreme Judicial Court reversed a decision by a Superior Court judge who had dismissed Bobby T. Brown&rsquo;s lawsuit against a Jiffy Lube franchisee before a trial.</p>
<p>Brown worked as a technician at a Hadley Jiffy Lube business owned by F.L. Roberts &amp; Co. Inc.</p>
<p>In 2002, after a new grooming policy was put in place requiring employees who worked with customers to be clean-shaven, Brown told management that his religion does not permit him to shave or cut his hair. Managers then said Brown could work only in lower bays where he did not have contact with customers.</p>
<p>Brown filed a discrimination lawsuit in state court in 2006. A Superior Court judge agreed with the company that it had the right to control its public image and found that it would be an undue hardship on the company to grant Brown an exemption from the grooming policy.</p>
<p>But the Supreme Judicial Court disagreed, saying the company had not proven that no other accommodation was possible for Brown without imposing an undue hardship on the company.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Rastafarian faith urges followers to let their hair grow unbridled. Many grow their hair into long, matted strands called dreadlocks to express a oneness with nature.<br>

I&rsquo;ll be blunt. Blacks are unsuited for civilized white society because they don&rsquo;t believe in standards and they believe no rule should apply to them.</p>
<p>Black nations and black communities are as they are because black cannot follow basic rules of law and rules of community (written and unwritten). That&rsquo;s why black neighborhoods are dysfunctional and why when they move to majority white communities and insist on bringing their &#8216;rules-don&rsquo;t-and-shouldn&rsquo;t-apply-to-me&rsquo; mentality with them, whites are justifiably appalled and move out.</p>
<p>In Chicago a few years back, they started moving blacks into a mixed community and they had to give them instruction about what was acceptable and not acceptable. One of the behaviors they were told was unacceptable was to sit on the steps of a building and block people from coming in an out (something sure to cause anger, resentment, and fights). As a white person, this sounds like common sense. And for whites, it is common sense. No one has to tell adult whites not to block entrances.</p>
<p>Common sense and the consideration of others seems to be something missing from the mind of blacks.<br>

		<p>I wonder if we could say our &#8216;white-power&rsquo; religion prevents us from speaking or associating with black folks, outside of our job requirements, I wonder if that would have religious protection? I&rsquo;m guessing no. The physical and mental safety of white folks is never an issue in modern society.</p>

		<p>Of all the stupid and mercilessly abused ideas in America, this nonsense about &#8220;religious discrimination&#8221; surely tops the list. Away with this half-baked, stone-age silliness. </p>
<p>On your own time, in your own way you may freely worship whomever, or whatever you wish - that is religious freedom. It should end there. Wearing costumes at work, growing your beard to your navel or wearing turbins as a cop, smoking illegal sunstances, sacrificing goats and chickens in your suburban backyard, etc., should NOT be foisted upon the American people under the guise of religious protection!</p>
<p>Ridiculous&hellip;<br>

		<p>I really didn&rsquo;t know Rastafarianism was a religion.  This country is a freakin mess starting with the judicial system.  Which, if you think about it, started the whole mess to begin with.  A company can&rsquo;t have a grooming policy without the approval of the courts.  This is becoming a very slow and painful death&hellip;</p>

		<p>I think about 85 percent of blacks&rsquo; annoying behavior is their passive-aggressive attempt to get back at Whites.  I&rsquo;m referring to their habit of walking slowly in front of cars, blocking sidewalks and apartment stoops, talking loudly in public places, and their myriad of other odd proclivities.  What is about to change, I believe, with the advent of the Obama era, is that their various behaviors are going to less passive and more aggressive.</p>

		<p>Is Rastafarianism actually a religion. By that I mean has anyone actually ever seen a Rasta Church? Do they actually have structured religious organizations?  Seems to me it is more of an excuse to abandon all pretense of hygiene and live a life of sloth and idleness. </p>

		<p>Since when is smoking pot and doing voodoo incantations a religion that should be protected by our constitution?  It&rsquo;s amazing that some people are so unsuitable for employment that they actually have to sue to keep their job as a car washer.</p>

		<p>These quick lube/oil change shops deal with dangerous, flammable and explosive materials, perhaps these sort of people can be kept out (legally) by requiring drug testing. Or better, DON&rsquo;T hire them to start with.</p>

Agreed. Except about Rastafarianism being &#8220;half-baked&#8221; and &#8220;stone-age.&#8221; This nonsensical, simple-minded, black-supremacist movement only goes back as far as the 1930s, not the stone age. And with all the ganja these guys smoke, Dreadheads are FULLY-baked. </p>
<p>Take a moment to learn about YET ANOTHER 3rd World gang that hates you, and who wishes that every white person would just stop breathing: </p>

Many Rastas also don&rsquo;t bathe or wash like civilized Whites, I guess that&rsquo;s also against their religion. All they want to do is smoke spliffs and listen to reggae all day.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve said this before and I repeat:</p>
<p>Do not hire non-whites period.  Only the owner of the business should do the hiring.  </p>
<p>Non-whites do not have to adhere to policy or Law and if you hire them, bet on trouble at some point down the road.</p>

		<p>For those who think that Rastafarianism is a fad will now realize that it is a very serious religion. Jiffy Lube still maintains that their policy was not aimed at an individual&rsquo;s religion, but if you must have customer contact, one must be clean-shaven and have neatly trimmed hair. I must say that there are many well-groomed Rastas around and like any normal person, you have the exception to the rule. Spoken in the Jamaican dialect, patios, I must end by saying &#8220;blood fire, de rasta dem score another touchdung</p>
