			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lynn Elber, AP, December 18, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Nearly a decade after the NAACP condemned a &#8220;virtual whiteout&#8221; in broadcast TV, the civil rights group said major networks have stalled in their efforts to further ethnic diversity on-screen and off.</p>
<p>Television shows of the future could be even less inclusive because of a failure to cultivate young minority stars and to bring minorities into decision-making positions, NAACP President and CEO Benjamin Todd Jealous said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A &#8220;critical lack of programming by, for or about people of color&#8221; can be traced in part to the lack of minorities who have the power to approve new series or make final creative decisions, said Vicangelo Bulluck, executive director of NAACP&rsquo;s Hollywood bureau.</p>
<p>In a report due to be released Thursday, the NAACP calls on networks to revisit a 2000 agreement to diversify the ranks of actors, writers, directors and executives. It also seeks to establish a task force with network executives, the NAACP and other civil rights groups.</p>
<p>The report raises the possibility of political action if progress is lacking, including a boycott against an unspecified network and its major advertisers or class-action litigation against the networks and parent companies.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>CW declined comment on the report, as did ABC, NBC and Fox. CBS received a request for comment late Wednesday and did not immediately respond.</p>
<p>On the heels of the 1999-2000 fall lineup of new shows that lacked any minority actors in lead roles &mdash; then-NAACP head Kweisi Mfume called it a &#8220;virtual whiteout&#8221; &mdash; the NAACP and Asian-American, Hispanic and Indian civil rights groups formed a coalition to lobby networks.</p>
<p>Broadcasters agreed to create minority recruitment and training programs and to chart minority hiring among actors, writers, directors and managers.</p>
<p>The coalition groups have charted their progress with annual reports, although the NAACP has not always participated, often finding sharp underrepresentation of minorities in front of and behind the camera.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Reality programming has dampened employment prospects for minority actors and writers, as it has for whites, but shows like &#8220;Survivor&#8221; and &#8220;American Idol&#8221; do offer a benefit: They are likely to be more diverse in casting than most scripted series, the NAACP noted, providing a truer national portrait.<br>

		<p>NAACP President Ben Jealous is quoted in another article on the subject as saying that &#8220;the effect on the country could be profound.&#8221;  I agree, it would be profound in that TV would be watchable again.  All I need to know is which networks the NAACP will boycott, then program those into my remote.</p>

		<p>What is this guy talking about. Every show today seems to have a disproportional number of Blacks(usually in management characters). Even the local news could be renamed &#8220;Blacktion News&#8221; with nearly a clean sweep from anchor, sports and weather.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Still not enough non-whites in front of and behind cameras to satisfy NAACP.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s a T.V. show or a movie, I won&rsquo;t watch it if it has a black as a main character, and I know several other people who refuse to do so also, so I&rsquo;m far from alone on that score.</p>
<p>I also refuse to watch spectator sports of all kinds, especially football and basketball.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to see a movement by whites catch on boycotting in exactly the same way.  Just five million people who abstain would make a fairly good dent in their sales figures.</p>

		<p>They&rsquo;ve got to be kidding.  Television programming is saturated with &#8220;blackness&#8221;.  There are multitudes of black shows on TV not to mention that much of &#8220;White&#8221; programming is littered with black supporting actors, interracial affairs and even the extras in the background are heavily blackenized.  Even the commercials have heavy doses of ethnicity in them.  This is not some affirmative action government program, this is about profit.  There is only so much diversity you can push in peoples faces before the viewers turn it off. I no longer watch any of the networks and confine my viewing to the History Channel or classic movies.  The most I&rsquo;ll see there is a 30 second cameo of Hattie McDaniel answering the door.  I will be glad when the cable and satellite companies get regulated to where they have to offer only the channels you want to see.  That way I can flush BET, BLKSTARS, Telemundo and Univision right down the kamode.     </p>

		<p>If I might be allowed to day dream, I propose the following solution:<br>
Since blacks make up about 13% of the population, and there are 24 hours in a day, let them have 13% of the day or 3.12 hours of television programing all for themselves. Heck, let them have prime time - I stopped watching network television many years ago. Let&rsquo;s just take it a step further and seperate ourselves completely; there are 50 states so let them have 13% or 6.4 states. They can move to the areas of their choosing, fences can be built, and no migration will be allowed. I would even be so gracious as to sell my land and move to another area if they so choose to move into my state.<br>
Obviously, these things will never happen so we must plan for the worst in the coming years. I pity the poor fools that have their heads stuck in the sand.</p>

		<p>TV is driven by profit and its chief aim is to attract viewers,i.e. potential customers for advertisers. If any given TV &#8220;talent&#8221; could attract viewers I&rsquo;m sure television execs wouldn&rsquo;t care what color that talent was. People like to enjoy what they see on TV. So face it, most blacks just aren&rsquo;t attractive. I seldom if ever watch TV where blacks are featured, yet I have enjoyed many movies starring Sidney Poiter or Halle Berry. </p>

		<p>I use a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) and only watch the programs I&rsquo;ve pre-recorded, skipping over the adverts.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s almost no diversity on TV for me.</p>
<p>If in future, there are less whites-only programs for me to watch, then I&rsquo;ll just watch less television; which is a good thing.</p>
<p>I stopped buying local &#8220;newspapers&#8221; a couple of years back as there are none here in SF Bay area that are not full of sob stories about the &#8220;poor undocumented&#8221;.</p>

		<p>It seems to me that blacks are way over represented on TV, everytime you turn it on there are blacks.  I see far more blacks on TV than I do in real life.  In almost every show there are black cops, judges, scholars, teachers, lawyers, scientists, experts of every kind, but amazingly enough, few black criminals on the crime dramas.</p>

		<p> Maybe Whites just want to &#8220;see people that look like them&#8221; on t.v.. Or maybe &#8220;it&rsquo;s a White thang, you wouldn&rsquo;t understand.&#8221; But really, the main reason I don&rsquo;t watch ANY shows that have blacks in them, is that they ALWAYS manage to make some racial dig on Whites during the show [with the exception of &#8220;The Cosby Show&#8221; and &#8220;Family Matters&#8221; which I enjoyed watching].</p>

		<p>I honestly have to say that at least 40% of the programming on television has black people in it. That&rsquo;s quite alot for people who make up only 13% of the population.  The NAACP is always ranting about how things don&rsquo;t represent the population and in this case I agree with them.  Cut way down on the number of black actors and stop using so many mulattos to replace the pure product.  It&rsquo;s offensive to me whether it&rsquo;s watered down or not plus I won&rsquo;t watch it anyhow.  About 70% of black women are obese so let&rsquo;s start seeing a little less Vanessa Williams lookalikes and more Esther Rolle types.  When&rsquo;s the last time you saw a big ole hippopatumus flop around on the screen?  I&rsquo;m tired of seeing most blacks cast as lawyers, brain surgeons, corporate CEOs, etc.  Let&rsquo;s see some real blacks in cornrows and rag-doos selling crack and killing cops or some big mama selling her stanky stank on the corner.  What they&rsquo;re pushing now borders on science fiction.   </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t watch much TV but diversity in casting is a total deal killer. Diversity makes TV much less believable because the reality is inverted. Someone above hit it on the head - black judges, investigators, surgeons, etc. It&rsquo;s absurd. I&rsquo;m closing in on middle age and I&rsquo;ve seen one black M.D. in my entire life - and I live in a metropolitan area of nearly three million people.</p>

<p>Television is about propaganda, making people feel better, and about having citizens have the &#8216;correct&rsquo; viewpoint. That&rsquo;s why ratings are so important. The best propaganda in the world is useless if no one wants to watch. As far as Sidney Poitier is concerned&hellip; that&rsquo;s one ugly dude.  </p>

		<p>Fascist black monsters trying to shove their blackness down our throats in the nation we conceived and built. Sorry NAACP I&rsquo;m not your slave and if anyone has taught whites to hate blacks &hellip;its blacks like these would be masters. Its becoming unnavoidable to see that blacks want to dominate whites, their not satisfied with black tv, black colleges, black month, the blacks won&rsquo;t be satisfied till they have the white women and the white man is a foot note in history. What can you say of a group that clams to love themself ..yet never ceases pushing themself on others? Arrogance is no stranger to these delluded extortionists. FREEDOM is a cherished precept in the white way of life and I&rsquo;m afraid there are strangers among us who would deprive us of this principle in our own homeland.</p>

		<p>Here in Australia, it seems every programme is dominated by black actors, who, as one poster has already observed, are in management positions. A case in point was NCIS, which was the most popular television for a few years. Then, all the main characters were white. Since then, they put a white woman in charge, now there is a black man as Director. The starring character could contradict the female Director easily enough, but that is of course totally inappropriate when dealing with a black male Director. Another programme that could be quite good is The Unit, save that the black Master Sergeant knows better and more than anyone else in the world, save perhaps Obama and Mugabe. His wife is even more unbearable as the domineering first wife in the encampment. The only programme that doesn&rsquo;t suffer excruciatingly from these fantastic stereotypes is Prison Break-but give the social engineers time and they will either reform it or remove it.  The number of black geniuses on Television programmes and in films also beggars belief, except perhaps for those people who believe the Polar Express will take them to Santa Claus-another sickly sweet film where a little black girl proved to be the guiding light for two little white boys.</p>
<p>Given the rates of black crime and incarceration not only in the US, but here in Australia, but in UK and the rest of Europe, it is mind-boggling that audiences can stomach the nonsensical propaganda that has made otherwise fundamentally sound dramatic concepts intolerable viewing to any aware person. <br>

		<p>I go over to my sister and brother-in-law&rsquo;s house and they watch TV drama NIGHTLY. They have a set of dramas they always watch. <br>
They have watched this change in casting(more and more Blacks in commanding roles) and even in average roles through the years and seem oblivious to it - even though it contradcits reality.<br>
 <br>
I was watching an episode of &#8220;House&#8221; the other night and one of the Blacks which was figuring in on a diagnosis was offering an inordinate amount of advice, superceding everyone else. Not being familiar with the series(which is a medical crime drama), I asked my sister: &#8220;Who is he supposed to be&#8221;? She said: &#8220;Oh, he&rsquo;s the lead neurologist&#8221;, without batting an eye. <br>
I am an R.N. and have witnessed only a VERY few Black M.D.&rsquo;s in my day, in spite of Affirmative Action programs, which work overtime to increase Black enrollment of medical schools for the coveted seats - over better qualified Whites. Other than the saturation of Blacks on network TV in authoritative roles(around 2-3X that found in the general public), few appear in menial roles such as waitresses, maids or janitors. Heaven borbid they portray a Black as a criminal, who in real life make up the majority of crime in most cities.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also noticed that in commericials, if there are 3 or more people pictured, at least one must be a Black. I doubt if it&rsquo;s voluntary, but I suspect there are &#8220;diversity police&#8221; that monitor programming and oversee the casting of such things. Only a theory. It doesn&rsquo;t happen by accident.</p>
<p>I only go to my sister&rsquo;s to visit. NOT do watch their diversified dramas. I could go along with 13% of the cast, but 25-33%! My prediction is that if the NAACP pushes the diversity thing much further, they&rsquo;ll loose viewers. Whites(the majority of viewers) will only tolerate so much.  </p>

<p>We need white only tv channels.</p>
<p>When are the blacks going to wake up to the fact that we whites do not want to see them or listen to them.</p>
<p>Professional sports is saturated with blacks now and the commentators are getting the same way.  Not interested anymore.</p>

		<p>Its all fantasy tv. Blacks portrayed as top management or high intelligence. Gone are the true portrayals of a non working class of people riddled with crime and no family structure. Every show the sacrificer and hero turns out to be the black. Where in the whites are once again the villian to the black man. Every commercial a new car, new house, great job, as i see it they are doing fine. President, highest paid women in tv, secretary of state, why all the whinning ? A quick drive thru the inner city will bring you back to your sences. Stolen cars, drug dealers, ramshakle houses that no one has pride in, unguided children running up and down the streets, a culture that wants nothing to do with improving itself. Its white guilt bringing you a false portrayal of the blacks on tv. What is there to be guilty of i ask. </p>

		<p>Since blacks already have their own cable movie channels why not give them their own news channel?</p>
<p>Have you noticed that Hollywood is frantically rewriting history by casting blacks in movies about medieval Europe?  They cast blacks as leaders of whites.  They also cast more and more blacks, Hispanics, Muslims and East Indians as the boyfriends and husbands of white women.  </p>
<p>Nickelodeon is covering the Inauguration for the first time in its history.  There is nothing the communists won&rsquo;t politicize including children&rsquo;s programming and Saturday morning cartoons.  This is going on right under our noses.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is time to start documenting the names of those responsible for this Marxist diversity indoctrination of America&rsquo;s children.  Those names appear in the credits.                <br>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t you guys get it.  The NAACP doesn&rsquo;t want more minorities in front of and behind the camera on TV.  They want all of TV to be minorities.  As with everything else, they don&rsquo;t want a part of the pie they want the whole pie and your&rsquo;s too.</p>

		<p>Blacks are in almost every commercial and they are always portrayed as smart, hip, or incredibly competent. The white guys, of course, are usually portrayed as ignoramuses and dweebs. </p>
<p>   In fact, I&rsquo;ve reached the point where if I&rsquo;m watching TV and a commercial comes on, I will actually wait for the black character to show up and they almost always do. In fact, even cartoon commercials for things like cereal will have a black cartoon character. Once you&rsquo;re aware of this, you can see it&rsquo;s being done deliberately. </p>
<p>   Looking at commercials, you would think blacks make up 70% of our population. </p>

		<p>The answer for us is simple. Get rid of the TV&rsquo;s altogether. I got rid of mine about five years ago and never looked back. Who needs the stupid thing anyway? I always hear people complaining about there being nothng good to watch and yet very few people get rid of it. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, blacks can run the whole show. Doesn&rsquo;t mean anything to me.</p>

		<p>This is a rather strange assertion for the NAACP to make.  If one drew conclusions on the racial composition of the US from watching TV, one would assume that the country is 40% black and that the professional class is 85% black.  Further, one would conclude that all blacks are clearly brilliant and all whites are slack-jawed dolts.</p>
<p>I wonder how the NAACP would react if Kool cigarettes, Colt .45 Malt Liquor, and Nightrain pop wine were advertised with all black actors and models.  At least the representations would be dead accurate.</p>

		<p>I watch little TV for many of the reasons listed in the above posts.  I&rsquo;ll record &#8220;Fringe&#8221;, which is an X-Files type show with pretty good plots.  Of course, the main character is a tough female and the FBI director is a smart, sophisticated, well-heeled black man.  The supporting characters are a young aimless white man and his mentally-ill, scientist father.  And this is one of the least diverse shows out there!</p>

&#8220;Pretty soon I will cancel my cable and stick to old movies that I will purchase so I can live in the past!&#8221;</p>
<p>I agree 100%. It&rsquo;s a sad state of affairs that we have to turn to old movies and TV shows for solace. Most of the good TV shows from the 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s are available on DVD. I would much rather watch an episode of Leave It To Beaver for the 100th time than most of the garbage that passes for entertainment today. </p>
<p>For those of you who are fed up with modern TV programs, cancel your cable subscription and rent some good old fashioned entertainment from the rental store of your choice. When blacks where portrayed in early movies or TV shows, they were for the most part, shining shoes, operating elevators, or punching tickets on trains.</p>
<p>Those really were the good old days!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m honestly not sure what most of the comments are speaking of when they say that TV is dominated by Blacks. It&rsquo;s simply not true. Most of the popular shows on television are all White or majority White. There are a lot of Blacks on commercials and a surprising number of Asians on adverts, but most TV shows that I watch have very little Blacks on them. Then again, I mainly watch the Discovery group of networks, like Science Channel, History Channel, TLC, IQ, and Military Channel which are targeted towards intelligent people so I guess they find little need to put Black people on.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know if anyone has noticed, but there is one program that presents a bit of hope for its reflection of reality as it is.  How they have gotten away with it up until know, I don&rsquo;t know, and I can&rsquo;t imagine it being able to last under the scutiny of the PC programing controlers, but if you haven&rsquo;t been able to check it out, do so before it disappears.</p>
<p>The show is the First 48 on A&E;, which is a reality show of true crime being investigated by police during the first 48 hours after discovery.  I can estimate that I have probably seen 20 different episodes, and to date, I haven&rsquo;t seen even one perp that is white, only 2 latinos, and the rest are black, and all the crimes are complete confirmations of the behavior of that community as a whole that is testified about on amren.  Completely impulsive, senseless, witnesses from that community that are completely incoherent, drug infested, rage filled, the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>If there is a reason that the show is allowed to continue under the vigilance of the diversity police, besides the fact that it may have just gone under the radar, it would have to be from the angle of the behavior of the detectives that investigate the crimes.  I can&rsquo;t be too hard on them, for I&rsquo;m sure for many of them their lives are hell, trying to investigate and enforce laws in this &#8220;protected class&#8221; hell, but likewise, I&rsquo;m sure that many of them have bought the &#8220;victim class&#8221; propaganda all the way and feel very important taking care of this infant class for the betterment of society.  At least that is what they will tell themselves.  Anyway, almost every esposide has several scenes of detectives sharing their personal thoughts as to how &#8220;unfortunate&#8221; the crime is, how families have been &#8220;torn apart&#8221;, how we&rsquo;re losing a &#8220;whole generation&#8221;. There isn&rsquo;t the attitude, which I think should be the correct one, of &#8220;we have seen thousands of crimes like this over several decades, all concentrated amongst a certain people and culture, when are we going to take the steps necessary to either remove this culture from our society, or seriously confront it to erradicate this poision among us?&#8221;  Maybe the point of the show for the diversity programers is to use the police as propogandists to pull at our heart strings on the issue, being that the criminality is now so brazen that it can&rsquo;t be ignored anymore by the populus as a whole, so it must be manipulated for their agenda. If that is the case, they have probably greatly miscalculated.   After seeing the 20 episodes that I have, my reaction to the crimes already is &#8220;more blacks doing what they do&#8221;.  In the vast majority of the cases, I don&rsquo;t feel bad for the perps or the victims.  These are the fruits of wanting to &#8220;keep it real&#8221; be a &#8220;thug&#8221; and embrace a massively destructive gangster culture based on ego and aggression.  For me, it makes a rock solid case for segregation.</p>
<p>Finally, I find the show encouraging on another level, and that is that the constant windows that it gives you into the state of the black culture as a whole in real time.  This culture is so sick, perverted and divided, that I can&rsquo;t see it being able to form any real organized ruling class as many on this website fear.  Sure, there is an elite that is portrayed in the media, but they are far, far from indicitve as a whole as to the strength of these people.  They are very, very weak.  Unfortunately, so are the majority of whites, but in a different culturaly paradigm.</p>
<p>So the NAACP should be very happy with shows like this one, for probably 80% of the leading roles are occupied by blacks.</p>
<p>I would be interested in any thoughts on this show and its portrayal of the current state of the issues from any posters here.</p>

		<p>The other night I was trying to broaden my horizons a little albeit via the video format. And of course it is invigorating to remind oneself of Western innovation.<br>
And I was watching something on &#8216;Einstein&rsquo;s Relativity&rsquo;(I&rsquo;m not trying to be pretentious, I&rsquo;m just a blue collar guy trying to watch a video).<br>
<a href="http://au.youtube.com/watch?v=tpbGuuGosAY" rel="nofollow">http://au.youtube.com/watch?v=tpbGuuGosAY</a><br>
And low and behold 4:14 into the video an African descended &#8216;expert&rsquo; just had to pop up and taint the whole thing. I couldn&rsquo;t help but think &#8216;this guy must be in the minority in his field&rsquo;, why choose him over lots of over qualified inviduals? &#8216;Window dressing&rsquo; and inspiration to the young brutha&rsquo;s out there &#8220;yes you can&#8221;. <br>
But not so good if you&rsquo;re one of those &#8216;other qualified individuals&rsquo;, &#8220;sorry buddy you&rsquo;re the wrong skin colour&#8221;.<br>
It seems there is no escape.</p>
<p>And Nickelodeon is covering the Inauguration for the first time in its history. What is that about? Don&rsquo;t answer that.<br>
It&rsquo;s like Oprah saying she just had to give Obama her first<br>
endorsement for a political candidate in her 20 years+ of broadcasting, and saying &#8220;I&rsquo;m not sure why, there&rsquo;s just something about the guy&#8221;? Gee I wonder what it was, hmmm?<br>
At home we watch almost exclusively American television, except for childens programming, because there&rsquo;s too much &#8216;monsters are just misunderstood potential friends&rsquo; type messages. <br>
And strangely in all kids programs pirates are now good role models (they leave out the raping and pillaging part). </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten to the point where I&rsquo;m just not interested in watching TV at all. The whole diversity thing and the agendas, etc., I&rsquo;m tired of it all. The quality of today&rsquo;s entertainment for the most part in of itself is not even worth watching. Nowadays it seems lame to me how people will arrange their schedules so they can sit in front of that box to watch some stupid CSI/drama for an hour that was written according to some stranger&rsquo;s point of view on life. </p>

		<p>Last White Man Standing:</p>
<p>I have Netflix, and most Leave it to Beaver episodes are online for instant viewing.  This is 1957-63 show, and I have only seen two black faces, one as an extra in a background crowd scene, and one as a house servant for a rich guy, she actually had a few lines.  Meaning that in six years of LITB, there was only one black who had lines.</p>
<p>Reality Check:</p>
<p>Another problem with people&rsquo;s obsession with shows like CSI and L&O; is this:  There is a sub rosa attempt by the writers of these shows, the networks, and governments, that shows like CSI and L&O; are good propaganda, in that it promulgates the false notion that the cops always get their man, so it&rsquo;s no use trying to commit a crime.  However, the reverse side of that coin is that real world jurors expect the real world cops to do it as well as they do it on TV, so if the procedural conduct of the real world cops in the real world trial doesn&rsquo;t match up to the quality of CSI, then the real jurors consider not beyond a reasonable doubt, and acquit.  Prosecutions are getting somewhat harder and harder to come by at trial, because of these shows.</p>

		<p>Have you noticed that Hollywood is frantically rewriting history by casting blacks in movies about medieval Europe?  They also cast more and more blacks, Hispanics, Muslims and East Indians as the boyfriends and husbands of white women.  This is intended to indoctrinate young white girls and give bottom feeders the impression that our white daughters are up for grabs.     </p>
<p>Nickelodeon is covering the Inauguration for the first time in its history.  There is nothing the communists won&rsquo;t politicize including children&rsquo;s programming and Saturday morning cartoons.  This is going on right under our noses.  Perhaps it is time to start documenting the names of those responsible for this Marxist diversity indoctrination of America&rsquo;s children.  Those names appear in the credits.<br>

I noticed he doesn&rsquo;t say anything that a high school science student wouldn&rsquo;t already know and most of what he says is philosophical.  Let&rsquo;s not forget the Japanese Professor at New York University.  Take a good look, both of these characters are recycled on way too many shows on that channel.  I was watching a show on the inner workings of NASA one time and they were in the control room.  Of all the places in there, the host had to stand in front of a black woman with her back to him sitting at her workstation.  While he&rsquo;s narrating I focus my attention on her and she&rsquo;s just staring off into space doing nothing. She didn&rsquo;t look like somebody who belonged there.  What did they do, grap the cleaning lady out of the bathroom and put her in front of the camera?     <br>

		<p>Tom Iron hit the nail on the head&hellip;.  I&rsquo;ve been a stranger to TV for about 10 years now, and life is wonderful.  This, coming from someone who was literally  raised on TV in the 70&rsquo;s and early 80&rsquo;s.  I was addicted (as was my familily).  College, work, The Marine Corps, the Sherrif&rsquo;s Office, and then the Police Department took up so much of my time that I woke up one day and realized I was wasting $50.00 a month for Cable that I rarely if ever watched.  So, I cancelled the subscription in 1998.  The TV I used to watch is sitting in the basement covered with dust.</p>
<p>Advertisers figured out in the early 60&rsquo;s that they could control people&rsquo;s behavior with the television.  Programmers (READ Cultural Marxists) figured it out a few years later.  TV is brainwashing, and nothing is on there by accident.  </p>
<p>Cancel the cable, put the box in the basement (or use it for target practice), read books and play board/card/logic/memory games.  Pull out some tools and build something with your children.  Cook and can food together (Go all the way, grow a small garden).  Exercise together.  Teach the dog a new trick (or two).  Have a CONVERSATION.  Go for a walk.  Throw the baseball or football.  Play charades.  Make Candles.  Buy a chemistry or electronics  set.  Make beer, wine, or whiskey (I do all three plus Meade, so I guess I&rsquo;m really depraved).  Build a bat box or bird feeder, then buy a pellet gun and practice your shooting skills.  Buy a bow and some arrows and practice shooting with them.  Bake your own bread.  Read stories to your children (hell, make up stories to tell your children).  Learn to play an instrument (or two).  Learn another language (or two).  Take up meditation.  Give your wife a two hour back rub.  Take up reloading or fly tying.  Go visit a nursing home.  Buy a lawn mower that does not work, and fix it by taking advice from someone who knows engines.  Learn a couple of magic tricks.  Learn a Martial Art.  Have your children draw pictures, and take them to the local Police/Fire Station or Military Base.  Go see a play.  Go to a concert.  Put on a Play or concert.  Play hide and seek or kick the can.  Or, just go to bed early&hellip;</p>
<p>There are a million better ways to spend your time than sitting back with your mouth agape staring at some hot white girl in bed with a coal black field hand on the electric Jew.  </p>
<p>From this perspective, when I do chance to see a TV either at a friend or relative&rsquo;s house or in a public setting, ten years on, it is amazing to me that anyone watches TV at all.  The propoganda is so in your face and over the top&hellip;.</p>

		<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working in the television broadcasting industry since 1963.</p>
<p>Just a few of my thoughts. A Caucasian woman has been working at one TV station for years, being paid about $80,000/year to watch this TV station all day with the &#8220;mute&#8221; button on. She watches for the &#8220;correct&#8221; visual messages in the video. For instance, the producers and directors of TV shows are told that the staging should be set up in such a way that the African Male is always near an attractive Caucasian woman. When the African Male speaks, the Caucasian woman looks longingly and attentatively at the African Male. When a Caucasian Male is in the scene, he should be disheveled and slouching. The Caucasian male should drop things and show that he is feeble and clumsy. The African Male is dressed nicely, stands upright in a masterful position. These visual messages are important because visual messages enter the eyes and go directly to a part of the brain that believes everything that it sees (remember; &#8220;seeing is believing&#8221;). Audio messages are passed through the ears to a part of the brain that questions the messages. </p>
<p>These visual messages have been going on for thirty years. Maybe understanding this will help some of the folks on this site to understand why the Caucasians around them seem not to act in their own best interests. </p>
<p>Mr. Putin, from Russia, stated recently that the United States has the best propaganda system that he has ever seen. And I have been a part of that propaganda system. But it pays well, and if I didn&rsquo;t do it, someone else would. </p>
<p>My question is: who is behind this? My thoughts keep leading me to the same conclusion: Washington DC has been taken over by people who are at war with the Caucasians in the United States.</p>
<p>God help us all.</p>
<p>Just my thoughts,<br>
Bill</p>

<p>Well, IIRC back in the early &rsquo;90s some programming wonk at CBS seriously proposed giving the overnight hours over to black-oriented programs, since &#8220;it&rsquo;s not like they have to get up early in the morning and go to work.&#8221;</p>

<p>Actually, IMHO that&rsquo;s a good thing. A lot of innocent people have been the victims of shoddy police work, fabricated evidence and outright prosecutor corruption. (Duke rape hoax, anyone?) Educated, skeptical jurors are an essential line of defense against these abuses of power. Otherwise the presumption of innocence exists in name only.</p>
<p>The real travesty of these shows is the false demographics of the bad guys (and gals). It&rsquo;s truly amazing how the vast majority of perps on <i>CSI: Miami</i> can be white when there are virtually no whites left in Miami. And I&rsquo;m no longer watching the original <i>CSI</i> now that Laurence Fishburne has replaced William Petersen in the lead role.</p>

I&rsquo;ll watch a movie I&rsquo;ve seen dozens of times over many years and then I&rsquo;ll notice a black character appearing that I don&rsquo;t ever remember seeing before.  Granted, these are just minor bit parts but I&rsquo;m sure the technology exists to digitize diversity into classic movies and they may already be doing that bit by bit.  My kids and I were watching &#8220;Bednobs and Broomsticks&#8221; on TV and this is a movie I saw 5 times as a kid when it came out in the theatres (I thought it was that good).  I&rsquo;ve seen it a few times as an adult, one time being about 6 years ago.  There were no black people in this movie.  I saw it again two years ago and remember it had a black woman and black soldier dancing in one scene at the marketplace.  Watching it with my kids, besides the black soldier and woman dancing it had a troupe of Carribbean performers in it.  After another 30 years it might not be recognizable and even the title might have to be changed to &#8220;Big Booties and Boomboxes&#8221;.    </p>

		<p>What kills me about TV are those crime shows, like all the CSI ones. Invariably they always have some brilliant black scientist solving the crime of some invariably White criminal. Yeah, right! How many black scientists do you know?</p>

		<p>Well said Tom Iron, Mic, and Bill!  I&rsquo;m 77, and I&rsquo;ve never watched TV since it started back in the fifties. (Except involuntarily, when I visit a friend&rsquo;s house). Never cared for the medium, and could never understand how people can be so taken in by it.<br>

		<p>Why I watch less and less TV&hellip;..I understand blacks wanting to see more blacks on TV, it&rsquo;s the same reason I want to see more whites on TV. Also I have noticed the extreme juxtaposition of black characters as only managers, doctors, lawyers, heroes and whites playing minor or criminal roles. Why is this brand of racism permitted?</p>
