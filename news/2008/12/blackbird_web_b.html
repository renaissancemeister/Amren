			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Adrian Covert, Gizmodo, December 9 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Wait, why do I need a special web browser? I mean, I get there&rsquo;s been a long standing digital divide between black America and the technological world (controlled by The Man). But do I really need a repackaged piece of software whose name evokes the Jim Crow era?</p>
<p>Last time I checked, I don&rsquo;t physically browse the internet any different than anyone else &mdash; evidenced by the fact that Blackbird UI looks exactly like Firefox (both are based around Mozilla), except, you know, with a black color scheme. And great, it comes preloaded with a bunch of bookmarks that might be of interest to the black community. But I&rsquo;m pretty sure the same thing can be accomplished with an effectively marketed website (black people DO know how to use Google, after all. Shocker!).</p>
<p>Maybe 40A, Inc. meant well with Blackbird, but it comes off as a lazy marketing ploy that plays on the emotions of people who are (admittedly) still marginalized when it comes to the online world. And playing along with the notion that blacks and whites (or anyone, for that matter) can&rsquo;t enjoy any of the same things, is the same retarded line of antiquated, ethno-centric thinking that the internet is supposed to destroy. Blah.</p>

		<p>I looked at Blackbird&rsquo;s webpage, and just for kicks, I downloaded it and tried it, within a virtual machine.  All it is is Firefox 3.0.x with a black chrome instead of white, (or maybe it&rsquo;s nothing more than defaulting to a custom-built theme), and a default bookmark set for a lot of black-oriented webpages, and a few addons and widgets.</p>
<p>What I don&rsquo;t understand is that Blackbird&rsquo;s official webpage stated that Blackbird was in alpha and eventually beta stages.  For what?  Addons and a theme?  It&rsquo;s not like Blackbird had to do any of the serious coding for the rendering engine, or extensibility, or Javascript.  That was all the responsibility of the Mozilla Corporation and others that participate in the open source project.  </p>
<p>So, probably 99.9% of the source code for Blackbird is Firefox, and the rest is for the custom default theme, the bookmarks and the widgets.  Not that there&rsquo;s anything wrong with that, as Firefox is open source, so they were within their rights to do what they did, but the flip side of that coin is that if you modify an open source codebase for another purpose, you have to release the source code for those modifications (GNU GPL).  Strangely, I don&rsquo;t see anything on the blackbird webpage to indicate that they have done that, though it&rsquo;s not as if very many people will have use for it.  It&rsquo;s the principle of the matter. </p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;it comes off as a lazy marketing ploy that plays on the emotions of people who are (admittedly) still marginalized when it comes to the online world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Marginalized?&#8221; Is this guy serious? How can anyone use language like this and keep a straight face?</p>
<p>&#8220;Marginalized&#8221; means &#8220;to relegate to an unimportant or powerless position within a society or group.&#8221;</p>
<p>Saying that blacks are &#8220;marginalized&#8221; when it comes to the internet implies that they are somehow the victims of a conspiracy  &mdash;  organized by evil whites, no doubt  &mdash;  to keep them off the web somehow.</p>
<p>But how could anybody keep them off the web? Is there a secret pact between access providers  &mdash;  some kind of covenant agreement to deny service to blacks or restrict them to, say, dial-up access only? </p>
<p>Maybe what we need is a reparations bill designed to give every black in the world free broadband access. That still wouldn&rsquo;t satisfy them, though. The next thing you know, they&rsquo;d start whining about how they&rsquo;d been &#8220;marginalized&#8221; from various porn and Hip Hop download sites.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to rant about this, but I&rsquo;m getting sick of hearing all this meaningless victimization jargon. When blacks and white liberals start using words like &#8220;marginalized,&#8221; you better check your wallet.</p>
<p>Having said all that, however, I completely support the idea of a web browser aimed at blacks. Anything that leads to more separation and segregation can only be good for us.</p>

		<p>Adrian Covert has missed the point. Its not about &#8220;surfers&#8221;. Its about &#8220;customers&#8221;. This is nothing more than targeted advertising. I dont know how long it will last, but ill bet the owners make a fortune. Theyll probably sell it to Google in a couple of years.</p>

<p>This review implies that &#8220;marginalization&#8221; is something that has been done <i>to</i> blacks, rather than something they have done to themselves through sheer lack of interest or lack of aptitude in technological matters. Once again, the act of shunting blame for one group&rsquo;s problems onto another group.</p>

<p>Every other group CREATES its own web content. If blacks are marginalized on the web, it is due to their own ineptitude and nothing else.</p>

I support their right to separate and segregate themselves (a right I want for myself). They have my blessing to &#8216;do for themselves&rsquo; (instead of asking me to kowtow and accommodate them).</p>
<p>By all means, they can have their own web browsers, schools, neighborhoods, businesses etc. Every such initiative adds to precedent.<br>

		<p>Fred 8 pm dec 10th suggests this will target advertising to be sold to &#8216;google&rsquo; but I doubt if there are sufficient &#8216;african-american&rsquo; products to be of more than a passing interest, especially to blacks. Actually, apart from racist rhetoric and threatening law suits, I can&rsquo;t think of any.</p>

		<p>Re: blacks and google</p>
<p>Go to google and search on &#8220;Jew.&#8221; At the top of the results page you&rsquo;ll see a note from google about &#8220;offensive web results.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now try searching the n-word. No disclaimer. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if this means anything&hellip; maybe google just figures that the n-word is already offensive, so the &#8220;offensive results&#8221; are expected and need no explanation. </p>
<p>But I bet someone somewhere makes a conspiracy theory about this.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a nastiness sometimes on the Internet. Some of it must be do to testosterone and frustration, but I wonder how much of the confusion and gossip is do to African Americans and their ongoing verbal warfare schemes, and with an ability to act with even greater &#8216;cover&rsquo;.</p>

<p>I would support the web browser too. I think one of the first big websites was Blackplanet. I would disagree with part of your statement, however. The last 50 years have been about people of color segregating, singling out, celebrating, and uplifting their cultures at every opportunity. It hasn&rsquo;t exactly been good for us. Whites have been afforded the exact opposite reality during this time.  <br>

		<p>Blackbird is just a &#8220;skin&#8221; on Firefox/Mozilla.  The great majority of the hackers how did the hard technical work of creating that open source web browser are white, and nearly all of the hackers who aren&rsquo;t white are Asian.  (They&rsquo;re at least 90% male, too.)</p>
<p>So black people can thank geeky white guys who can&rsquo;t get a date for their Afro-centric browser.  But just you wait   &mdash;   thanks to Blackbird, soon most blacks and eventually the mass media will believe that the web browser was invented by a black man.<br>

		<p>Well, I think Blackbird is the internet equivalent of &#8216;Curb Feelers&rsquo;, $10,000.00 &#8216;rims&rsquo;, and gluing indoor-outdoor carpet to the outside of your car. Why does it have to make sense?  When has anything marketed to blacks ever made sense?  Did SNAKES ON A PLANE make sense?</p>
<p>But at least the poor, &#8216;marginalized&rsquo;, afro-victims should get free blackface bobble-head thingies to add to their writings, for when they go blogging&hellip;.as a substitute for those racist yellow smiley-face things the feeble-minded white kids use.</p>
<p>And I always thought that filling the back window of your Deville with pillows and stuffed animals was a great pre-airbag ploy for sending cushioning missiles flying through the car at the moment of impact.  What better way to protect the nine grandchildren jumping up and down on the back seat of the car?</p>
<p>Now, as to the Lincoln &#8216;BLACKWOOD&rsquo;; well that&rsquo;s just plain NASTY: a totally suggestive compound word; particularly when you consider the seats folding down and all.  I hope Lincoln realizes that its obvious marketing of black orgy cribs on wheels may be why Mississippi &#8216;Mamaws&rsquo; like me have defected to Lexus and BMW.</p>

		<p>Now that the &#8220;African-American&#8221; community has its own web browser, I think they need their own special operating system.  Windows, Unix, Linux, MAC, etc. are all too white.  Perhaps they also need their own electricity; 115 volt AC or even 230 V AC are also too white.  Direct current would probably be the best fit for their special, marginalized needs.</p>
<p>With enough tax money, I could study the problem.</p>
