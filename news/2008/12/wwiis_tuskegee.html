<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-politics/20081210/Obama.Tuskegee.Airmen/">WWII&rsquo;s Tuskegee Airmen Invited to Inauguration</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, December 10, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Tuskegee Airmen, who made history during World War II as the country&rsquo;s first black military pilots only to return home to discrimination and exclusion from victory parades, have been invited to Barack Obama&rsquo;s inauguration.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to come hopping, skipping and jumping!&#8221; said 92-year-old Spann Watson, an airman from Westbury, N.Y. who flew above Pennsylvania Avenue for President Truman&rsquo;s inauguration. &#8220;We had a part in changing these United States.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It makes us very very proud,&#8221; said Harrison, of Philadelphia. &#8220;And it sort of compensates for a lot of the things that we had to endure in the early days.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., sent the invitation Tuesday to Tuskegee Airmen Inc. The Arlington, Va.-based organization represents 330 of the original pilots, whose ranks were once about 1,000.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After fighting the Nazis, they returned home to face discrimination. Watson, the New York airman, said blacks weren&rsquo;t allowed to participate in victory parades with other troops returning from Europe during World War II.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were excluded out of everything and hidden from everything,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Now this time is our time, and to have a black man as the elected president, this is indeed a turn in history.&#8221;</p>
<p>Each member will receive two tickets to the Jan. 20 inauguration, and they have 10 days to decide if they will attend.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rose, speaking from his home in Bellevue, Neb., said his local chapters are contacting airmen. Most are in their late 80s and early 90s, making travel difficult. The logistics involved, such as finding increasingly expensive and scarce hotel rooms, also may prevent some from showing up.<br>

		<p>Actually, I do find it deplorable that these men (and those during the Korean &amp; Vietnam conflicts) were asked to serve and then mistreated.  Unless voluntary, I completely believe that they should have been exempt from service prior to Desert Storm.<br>

		<p>I hope everyone at Obama&rsquo;s inaguration, these airmen included enjoy themselves. I could imagine it being the happiest day in a lot of their lives. However, rather than focusing on that happiness, the article is all about how the airmen faced discrimination. It seems that this reporter is one of those people who just needs to get with the times. </p>

		<p>&#8220;We had a part in changing these United States.&#8221; Sadly, they did indeed. In fact they are ninety-five percent of the reason why we&rsquo;ve declined so severely. They&rsquo;ve changed our public schools, public housing, public transportation, our cities, our streets, our neighborhoods, and our culture, and we will never recover as long as they remain on our shores.</p>

		<p>There has been a claim going around that no bombers were ever lost to the Germans while being escorted by the &#8220;Redtails&#8221;, the Black 332nd (?) Fighter Group, but according to Wikipedia, about 25 American planes were downed while under the protection of the Tuskegee airmen.  As always, even when Blacks do accomplish something, it&rsquo;s exaggerated.  Given an average IQ of 85, and a standard deviation of 10, about 2% of blacks will have a IQ of 115, smart enough to have been WW2 fighter pilots.  Is that really so surprising, does it really warrant such jubilation?  </p>

		<p>Actually, with all things hovering around &#8216;Multi-Culturalism&rsquo; the truth always gets muddled. The truth about the Tuskegee Airmen is they weren&rsquo;t that great.  In fact, when you read their war record you quickly find out they were pretty much AVERAGE, NOT the &#8216;Great Heroes&rsquo; the Cultural Marxists want us to believe.</p>

		<p>I wonder if the members of the 4th fighter group will get tickets?  It is there time also. All they did was to lead the bombers over Berlin. The same with the AVG- the Flying Tigers. It is their time also. In the early days of WW II, while we were<br>
retreating and surrendering, they were our only hope.<br>
   The T-men legend is exaggerated. They were given twice the number of hours before being sent into battle. The more flying hours, the better chance you have of surviving. They claim that this was racism. The T-men were not given the dangerous strafing missions. This kept their casualties down. They escorted the bombers in the early part of the mission where they were less likely to meet the enemy. The white squadrons got the hard jobs.</p>

		<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_Airmen" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_Airmen</a><br>
A few excerpts:<br>
&#8220;&hellip;<br>
The claim that no bomber escorted by the Tuskegee Airmen had ever been lost to enemy fire first appeared on 24 March 1945, in the Chicago Defender, under the headline &#8220;332nd Flies Its 200th Mission Without Loss.&#8221; According to the 28 March 2007 Air Force report, however, some bombers under 332nd Fighter Group escort protection were shot down on the very day the Chicago Defender article was published.[12][13][14][15] The subsequent report, based on after-mission reports filed by both the bomber units and Tuskegee fighter groups as well as missing air crew records and witness testimony, was released in March 2007 and documented 25 bombers shot down by enemy fighter aircraft while being escorted by the Tuskegee Airmen.</p>
<p>The controversy continued to attract news media attention in 2008. A St. Petersburg Times article quoted a historian at the Air Force Historical Research Agency as confirming the loss of up to 25 bombers. Disputing this, a professor at the National Defense University in Washington said he researched more than 200 Tuskegee Airmen mission reports and found no bombers were lost to enemy fighters. Bill Holloman, a Tuskegee airman who taught black studies at the University of Washington and now chairs the Airmen&rsquo;s history committee, was reported by the Times as saying his review of records did confirm lost bombers, but &#8220;the Tuskegee story is about pilots who rose above adversity and discrimination and opened a door once closed to black America  &mdash;  not about whether their record is perfect&#8221;.<br>
&hellip;<br>
Far from failing as originally expected, a combination of pre-war experience and the personal drive of those accepted for training had resulted in some of the best pilots in the U.S. Army Air Corps. Nevertheless, the Tuskegee Airmen continued to have to fight racism. Their combat record did much to quiet those directly involved with the group (notably bomber crews who often requested them for escort), but other units were less than interested and continued to harass the Airmen.<br>
All of these events appear to have simply stiffened the Airmen&rsquo;s resolve to fight for their own rights in the US. After the war, the Tuskegee Airmen once again found themselves isolated. In 1949, the 332nd entered the annual All Air Force Gunnery Meet in Las Vegas, Nevada and won. After segregation in the military was ended in 1948 by President Harry S. Truman with Executive Order 9981, the Tuskegee Airmen now found themselves in high demand throughout the newly formed United States Air Force. Some taught in civilian flight schools, such as the black-owned Columbia Air Center in Maryland<br>
&hellip;<br>
In 2005, four Tuskegee Airmen (Lt. Col. Lee Archer, Lt. Col. Robert Ashby, MSgt. James Sheppard, and TechSgt. George Watson) flew to Balad, Iraq, to speak to active duty airmen serving in the current incarnation of the 332nd, reactivated as first the 332nd Air Expeditionary Group in 1998 and made part of the 332nd Air Expeditionary Wing. &#8220;This group represents the linkage between the &#8216;greatest generation&rsquo; of airmen and the &#8216;latest generation&rsquo; of airmen,&#8221; said Lt. Gen. Walter E. Buchanan III, commander of the Ninth Air Force and US Central Command Air Forces, in an e-mail to the Associated Press.<br>

<p>Sounds like this man doesnt care when people are excluded from an event based soley on race. However it appears that only black airmen from WWII are invited to obama&rsquo;s inauguration. I wonder if this man or obama, or anyone else is concerned that white airmen ARE BEING EXCLUDED from obama&rsquo;s inauguration based soley on race? Or is that different? </p>
<p>Strange how minorities and white liberals call for discrimination against whites (affirmative action, etc)to &#8220;rectify&#8221; past discrimination against minorities and yet dont see their anti white views as racist or discriminatory.</p>

		<p> Everyone knows that the world was liberated by Blacks, such as the Tuskegee Airmen, and other minorities that rose up gallantly against the White Nazis. The minorities used their technology, moral supremacy, and superior intelligence to thwart White conquest around the World.</p>
<p> The above will soon be taught to all children, especially in the US.</p>
<p> As I drive by daily an old military cemetery, I wonder how many of those White men would have fought for what this Country has now become. They are the real Heroes that are now unappreciated and considered by many in the new America to be the enemy</p>

		<p>I watched a documentary on the history channel that interviewed one of these pilots. He never mentioned any contact with the enemy. All he talked about was how the aircraft would operate. Like climbing and diving. Not once did the program show any combat footage of these airmen. Years earlier. I had read about the missions these pilots went on. According to the article. A crop duster could have escorted the bombers, due to the German air force was practically non-existent. Unlike the all black ground units deployed in combat. When the enemy engaged the black regiments. The blacks ran away from the fight. thus filling the brigs with soldiers charged with cowardice. Entire units were relieved in the field due to the black cowards, when facing a real enemy. Until there is evidence or records of killing the enemy in combat. The black units should be stripped of any recognition that honors combat veterans.</p>

		<p>Ahh Yes, the famous Tuskeegee Airmen, whom the motion picture about claimed  NEVER lost a single plane they were giving fighter cover to. The same film made a big deal about a congressman investigating them for various sorts of misconduct and morale problems which the movie made out to be a racist scheme. I wonder how much of what was being investigated was in fact some real problems that were typical of black military units in WW2?</p>

		<p>I know nothing about the Tuskegee Airmen, but to those of you posting Wikipedia articles to support your arguments: compare the wikipedia article on the Jena 6 and Jared Taylor&rsquo;s article on the same. You will find that the Wikipedia article puts the blacks involved in as positive a light as possible without outright lying. I have no doubt that this policy extends to other articles as well.</p>

<p>What you say is doubly true for Canadian and especially British veterans. Did those British soldiers in the Eighth Army, sweltering in that desert heat, ever imagine just three years after the war ended that the Labour party would betray them with open-door third world immigration? Was the promise of non-White immigration to Britain used as a rallying cry to rouse the British populace during the blitz?</p>

		<p> With all due respect to their service, as a whole&hellip; African-Americans have lied to us about the Redtails for sixty years . And had the truth not been brought to the forefront recently, they would still be lying .And if they lost 25 bombers during a one week period, isn&rsquo;t it safe to assume that more bombers were lost during the war ? A point of interest,in the movie October Sky, the Redtail veteran/ machinist was largely fictional .He was a composite of the black storekeeper and the caucasian engineer .In actuality the veteran, a fighter pilot from the Korean War was the engineer and he was white .That is from the book .What I want to ask is, why would such a fabrication even be necessary ? And it is so unfair to the man who actually served in combat, a real man, not a composite of characters . I just don&rsquo;t get it . How can anyone doubt that there is indeed a conspiracy against whites in this nation ? </p>

  After arriving as a replacement around Christmas of &#8216;44 during &#8220;the Bulge&#8221;, he and his platoon were loaded on to trucks and immediately driven to the front. As they neared the frontline action and the bombs and artillery became deafening, the truck, suddenly, lurched to a stop. The black driver got out and was replaced by a White driver, who drove them the rest of the way to the fighting.<br>
   I suspect it was much the same for the Tuskeegee airmen.</p>

		<p>If these same great airmen were the ones flying the spitfires over England that summer, when the German Messerschmidt was in its prime, we would all be speaking German now and the noble Africans would have long ago been exterminated!</p>
<p>Get real!There is a difference between somehow learning to fly a plane and being a fighter pilot in combat against at least equal if not superior foes. </p>

		<p>Some thoughts on the Tuskegee Airmen:</p>
<p>1.  The Tuskegee Airmen were a demonstration of the amazing effectiveness of the USAF pilot selection and training program.  It worked for blacks as well as white because there was no compromise of standards, so it just took more black applicants to sift through in order to get the same number of qualified pilots.  The USAF was equally effective at selecting and training ground crews.  The system even worked for Chinese, who entered training believing that demons made the engines go.</p>
<p>2.  Even among figher pilots, there was a lot of chaff.  Statistics show that 90% of aerial victories were attained by only 10% of the figher pilots.  The overwhelming majority, regardless of race, were capable of little more than flying the mission and returning (a task not to be diminished).  </p>
<p>3.  As for the &#8220;no bombers lost&#8221; claim, it is very difficult to refute or back up such a claim.  Fighters and bombers flew from different airfields, and were assigned a time and place to rendezvous on the way to the target.  Very frequently, these rendezvous were not met.  Fighter pilots very often joined up on whatever bomber formation they could find, which meant their assigned bombers might go without escort.  The fighters did not have the fuel to hang around the RP in the hope their assigned bombers would show up.  So, did they claim to never lose a bomber they were assigned to escort, or does this apply only to the bombers they actually did escort?  This is never clarified.  </p>
<p>4.  As for the Luftwaffe being wiped out by the time the TA arrived, just not so.  German fighter production increased through 1943 and 1944.  The quality of pilots declined, and fuel shortages curtailed essential training, but very few bombing missions met no opposition.</p>

		<p>The Tuskegee Airmen are as frauds the same as Obama.  What does one do when their race ranks dead last in human accomplishments?  One lies about their non-existent exploits at very opportunity&hellip; <br>

		<p>   Old Soldier, with all due respect to your service, the Chinese have come a long way from rickshaws and sampans in sixty years haven&rsquo;t they ? They are now comtemplating sending men to the moon on rockets they built, we should all be afraid of the Kings of the East . They are a people, we are a slumgullion stew .On the subject of the TAs . It&rsquo;s been researched and verified by surviving bomber crews .No malice was involved, it is now known that during a 7 day period ( I think ) they lost some 25 bombers . Technology being what it was then, if bombers went in the air, they were shot down .It was a just a cold hard fact of war in the air .The TAs no loss record was a lie first propagated by a black Chicago newspaper .They knew better and we should have too .Thank Heaven for the historian that uncovered it . And if they lost 25 bombers during that short period of time, technology being what it was, you know that other bombers went down that were under their protection during the war .The shame is not in losing the bombers- a heartbreaking fact of life in WW2, but that they have lied about it for sixty years . Have no fear, I am certain a PC excuse will soon be in the offing as to how they were able to achieve such a remarkable record, but some of us will know that it is just another lie . </p>
