<h1>The Reverse Brain Drain</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Doug Saunders, Globe and Mail(Toronto), December 11, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Five months ago, Pankaj Dinodia was on top of the Wall Street boom: At age 25, the Indian immigrant had made it through one of the top U.S. business schools and held an important investment banking position with Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p>Then, in the middle of the summer, he felt the calling. The future didn&rsquo;t look so good in the big Western markets, he decided. Those calls from his family in New Delhi, urging him to come back and help out with the family accounting business, sounded more sensible. So he gave up his huge bonus and got on a plane.</p>
<p>At the time, his move from the world&rsquo;s most successful investment bank to the poky New Delhi offices of S.R. Dinodia &amp; Co., Chartered Accountants, bewildered his friends and colleagues: It was as if he had abandoned his future.</p>
<p>Now they&rsquo;re all phoning him.</p>
<p>People like Mr. Dinodia are pioneers in the &#8220;reverse brain drain,&#8221; a huge shift of knowledge and skills out of New York and London and back into the developing world. In one of the surprising consequences of the global financial meltdown, the collapse of the Western banking and finance industries has sent thousands of highly skilled professionals from immigrant backgrounds back to their homelands, where they are taking on key roles in emerging economies.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have ridden the bubble to the top and got out when things started looking shaky, but a lot of my colleagues have lost their jobs &hellip; the Lehman Brothers of the world, the Bear Stearns of the world are no longer sucking up talent from India but instead sending it back,&#8221; Mr. Dinodia said from New Delhi the other day.</p>
<p>&#8220;So companies here can now hire bankers with the kind of experience we never could have dreamed of employing before the crunch.&#8221;</p>
<p>Precise figures of professionals returning home aren&rsquo;t available, but reverse migration has become a major issue in a number of countries. The financial sectors in India and China are being bolstered by a reverse exodus of highly trained but suddenly jobless bankers and analysts. Brazil and Turkey have observed the same effect. The trend is also visible in smaller developed countries, such as Israel and Australia, that have avoided the worst of the crash.</p>
<p>And Malaysia may have gone the furthest in exploiting the phenomenon: Its higher-education minister announced recently that his country&rsquo;s institutions should launch an international program &#8220;to identify Malaysian professionals who lost their jobs abroad to return and work.&#8221;</p>
<p>The reversal is particularly dramatic in India, where human resource managers for finance firms are reporting hundreds of résumés from New York and London arriving on their desks each week.</p>
<p>Mr. Dinodia has found himself at the centre of this phenomenon. After he arrived in India, he set up an online community for Indian-born graduates of the Wharton School &mdash; the acclaimed University of Pennsylvania business college where he&rsquo;d earned his degree &mdash; to help them find positions in India&rsquo;s thriving financial sector if they wanted to move back.</p>
<p>He thought he would end up helping out maybe a couple of dozen people. Then the markets collapsed. In the past six weeks, his network has helped 350 Wharton grads move back to India, using its circle of 50 India-based mentors and &#8220;industry captains&#8221; to place them in high-level positions in an economy that looks more promising, if a lot smaller, to many of them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s become a second job for him, even as he struggles to bring structured financing and other tools of investment banking to his fast-growing family firm.</p>
<p>As he spoke, he read a new e-mail from a former classmate: &#8220;I have nine years of hedge fund experience on the public and private side; I&rsquo;m happy to come in anywhere, from analyst to vice-president, in any role, I&rsquo;m desperate; my kids go to a private school; I have a big mortgage; I&rsquo;m looking for any job in India in investing.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to a large-scale study of 1,200 Indian and Chinese returnees to be published next month by Vivek Wadhwa, a U.S. immigration scholar and consultant, the majority of people joining the reverse brain drain are under 40, most have masters or doctorate degrees, and they&rsquo;re generally leaving because they believe prospects look better in the world&rsquo;s poorer half.</p>
<p>&#8220;These people seem to be doing better back home than they would have done in the U.S.,&#8221; Mr. Wadhwa said. &#8220;More than 60 per cent of Indian returnees and more than 80 per cent of Chinese returnees believe their home countries offer better career and professional opportunities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Wadhwa worries that U.S. immigration policies are pushing the best minds out of the country&rsquo;s economy: Because the Green Card system only gives residency status to immigrants who have permanent jobs, and does not allow them to stay through a downturn, he believes the system is destroying the competitive advantage of the United States. He estimates that one million skilled foreign workers awaiting permanent residency visas in the U.S. are likely to leave.</p>
<p>(Canada&rsquo;s immigration system is more flexible for workers in this position, but the Canadian banking system has not faced the collapse and bailout that the U.S. and Britain have endured, so a mass departure of foreign talent is less likely, experts say).</p>
<p>But a substantial number of the Indian and Chinese Americans headed eastward hold U.S. or British citizenship: It appears that many of these homeward-bound professionals aren&rsquo;t simply victims of the crash, but entrepreneurs hoping to use their accumulated savings from the boom years to launch a wave of innovation in their home countries.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how Mr. Dinodia saw it: &#8220;The plan was always to learn from the best and the brightest, the Whartons and the Goldman Sachs of he world, and then come back to the family business so that never again would a client leave us for a fancy name tag,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even though it&rsquo;s a domestic firm, I wanted people to realize that we have the best and the brightest brains within the firm itself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Something similar happened after the dot-com boom collapsed in 2000. Tens of thousands of Indian software engineers, who had formed the intellectual backbone of Silicon Valley&rsquo;s period of vast growth and innovation, decided to move back home en masse. They turned to entrepreneurship, and their software companies ended up launching the great outsourcing boom of recent years, sending millions of jobs back to India.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s good reason to return eastward these days. While India&rsquo;s economy is also hurting, some of its fundamentals appear stronger. Indian companies, large and small, have avoided heavily leveraged loan finance, and tend to be rich in cash.</p>
<p>Growth may have slowed, but it hasn&rsquo;t stalled or gone negative.</p>
<p>Some returnees, like Mr. Dinodia, are realizing the dreams of parents who never thought they&rsquo;d be able to match the six-figure bonuses of Wall Street and win their prodigal children back.</p>
<p>But for many others, the precise opposite is true.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I got on the plane and left the U.S. for India, my dad said, &lsquo;I worked my whole life to give you the opportunity to be educated and work in the U.S., and the first thing you do after a few years of work is fly right back to India,&rsquo; &#8221; said Samvir Sidhu, also 25, who recently left behind a Wall Street job &mdash; and his American citizenship &mdash; to join a private equity firm in New Delhi.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was quite an ironic revelation.&#8221;<br>

		<p>&#8220;&#8216;I have ridden the bubble to the top and got out when things started looking shaky, but a lot of my colleagues have lost their jobs &hellip; the Lehman Brothers of the world, the Bear Stearns of the world are no longer sucking up talent from India but instead sending it back,&rsquo; Mr. Dinodia said from New Delhi the other day.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two most accurate phrases in that arrogant Indian&rsquo;s diatribe are: &#8220;ridden the bubble,&#8221; and &#8220;sucking up.&#8221;</p>
<p>1.)&#8221;Ridden the bubble,&#8221; translates into: &#8216;I have parasitically stolen a job and as much money as I can from some more deserving white man because of multiculturalism, but now the party is over. I better not stick around, because when they figure this out, I&rsquo;ll be dog food&hellip;&rsquo;</p>
<p>2.) &#8220;Sucking up,&#8221; need not be translated, but simply must be put into context. The Bear Stearns of the world, are no longer going to be able to afford &#8220;sucking up&#8221; to such wonderfully decorative and abjectly useless people as Mr. Dinodia; after all, if he were so good at what he does, wouldn&rsquo;t they have kept him on and doubled his bonus? </p>
<p>It is simply amazing, that an article such as this, could be written in such a hand wringing style over a &#8220;brain drain,&#8221; that is centered on bean counters and speculators. These are the fools who got us into this mess. What &#8220;horrors&#8221; next will have to be endured?</p>
<p>A return home of all the Third Worlders employed in the tolerance terrorism and diversity debauchery rackets?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t throw me in the briar patch!!!</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t mind competing economically with Japanese or Chinese or Indians or Mexicans or anyone else in the international marketplace.  Bring `em on!  That&rsquo;s how the free market works.</p>

		<p>Good luck to them. But will these now booming developing economies now invite millions of white workers to immigrate to their countries and give in to the immigrant&rsquo;s demands that they now become multicultural societies? I won&rsquo;t hold my breath.</p>

		<p>If this were true it will be a great leap forward for India and it&rsquo;s billion or so poor people who will be lifted out of poverty and into the middle class. China also has many extremely poor people who will benefit from these &#8220;great minds&#8221; coming back to their mother countries. Somehow I think Canada and the USA will survive losing all these great minds and somehow we will muddle through the 21st century. As a non-Indian and Non-Chinese I think I also will survive the &#8220;catastrophe&#8221;.</p>

		<p>One thing is missing from this article.</p>
<p>During the 1930&rsquo;s, jobs were a scarce resource which had to be rationalized.  Heads of families were given preference over married women and single men.  </p>
<p>In the new depression, whites will be hiring their own kind first, and the foreigner living abroad knows it.</p>

		<p>I am really getting tired of these articles that indirectly hint at the fact that the West is helpless without Third World immigrants (even in intelligence).  The likes of Teddy Roosevelt probably never imagined this day coming.  Today whatever is false is proclaimed as true, and whatever was once considered &#8220;bottom&#8221; is now considered &#8220;top&#8221;.  </p>
<p>The whole notion of the &#8220;brain drain&#8221;, whether it is in the usual context, or in the reverse, as it is refered to in this article, degrades and insults white people in itself.  The cliche &#8220;brain drain&#8221; commands us to already assume that people in the Third World are smarter than people in the white, Western world.  The &#8220;brain&#8221; in &#8220;brain drain&#8221; is always refering to people of the Third World, whether they are coming into the West (and enriching us) or leaving the West (and hurting us). </p>
<p>As a white person, I am getting sick and tired of this garbage.  Don&rsquo;t try and tell me that my people who invented the computer, went to the moon first, and cured many diseases, are somehow less capable than these &#8220;gifted&#8221; inhabitants from Third World countries.  The key words here are &#8220;Third World&#8221;.  </p>
<p>I am sick of it!  Why do white people put up with this?  Our race has accomplished so much for the world and yet we sit here constantly putting ourselves down to make other races feel better.  I am sick of it.  I am not going to put up with this anymore. </p>

		<p>I wonder if India and China will be willing to let in educated whites from western countries? And if their economies are doing better than ours&rsquo;, will they be willing to import illiterate Somalis et al to do the work that &#8216;Indians and Chinese won&rsquo;t do&rsquo;?</p>
<p>Do pigs fly? In other words, I already know the answer.</p>

		<p>As for me, I am not sure if I am going back to Korea or not.  </p>
<p>When it all comes down to getting paid, it would be about same.  </p>
<p>Korea has pros and cons.</p>
<p>I can never get enough of the Tim Hortons double double extra large coffee and donuts.  </p>
<p>Korea has exceptional sea foods.  </p>
<p>Canada offers exceptional health care, Korea is not necessarily far behind but it COSTS A TON</p>
<p>Canada is a very beautiful country indeed.  </p>
<p>Tax is much lower in Korea.  I am not sure about other parts of the world, but the professors and doctors in Canada pay 50% of all their salaries as taxes.  In Korea, the doctors usually pay 30% of their salary as taxes.</p>
<p>If I may list a few more things&hellip; there are very few tennis courts in Korea, but there are public tennis courts everywhere in Canada, and it is very expensive to play golf in Korea.</p>
<p>There indeed is a possibility I will go back to Korea.  Regardless of where I am, I will try to live hard and be happy.  </p>
<p>When I first came to Canada, I was, for a while, confused with &#8220;celery&#8221; and &#8220;salary&#8221;  Whenever I saw on TV, &#8220;he will get paid this much celery to play for the team!!&#8221; I thought to myself, &#8220;they give him celery to play for this team?  he must get paid a lot of celery&hellip;&#8221;  and whenever I went to a dinner party and someone said to me, &#8220;here we go, have some salary&#8221; I thought to myself, &#8220;isn&rsquo;t that what they said on TV they will give the players in return for playing for the team?&#8221;  &#8220;So this is what they said they will give the players on TV&hellip;.&#8221;</p>

		<p>no doubt there are many intelligent people living in the developing world. and no doubt some of them would be considered very much above average in the developed world. however, those brains dont immigrate to enrich the developed world but to enrich themselves. by bringing so many of those brains to the developed world, educating them and hiring them we have given them experience that they could have never achieved elsewhere. and no doubt they were paid very well for the privilege. now, it appears they will take what theyve learned and use it against us. its not difficult to see who got the better of that deal.</p>

If there is so much talent in India why it waits to be sucked up by western companies in the first place?  Shouldn&rsquo;t such &#8220;great minds&#8221; of india create their own companies into which whites should be eager to be sucked up?  <br>

		<p>I have little sympathy for financial speculators in general, of whatever race. However I can testify from first hand that American science has been largely driven by first-generation immigrants for the last 30 years at least.  This is mainly because there is, gladly,  demand in this country for high-level innovation whereas American kids have mostly chosen to study other subjects at school and college. Without these immigrants (of whom I am one, from Britain), American science would have died a long while ago. My advice to you guys is don&rsquo;t concentrate your efforts railing against the legals, many of whom are still integral to the future of the country. </p>

<p>The readers on this board have no problem with white British and other Europeans legally immigrating to the US. It&rsquo;s the non-white and /or non-legal immigrants we object to. Even if all immigrants were brilliant Chinese who excelled in the sciences, most of us would object because 1) their very presence changes our culture and 2) if we need something done, we can do it ourselves. (and by the way, American science would NOT have died if we had good leadership)</p>
<p>If you really pay attention, you&rsquo;ll see that the core of this website is not about science, or the economy or even competing with other nations. It&rsquo;s about home and hearth, about living in a culture created and sustained by your own people. That&rsquo;s what we are fighting for.</p>

		<p>Courtney,,, nicely said,, I agree with everything you said.  I just cant understand why Goldman Sachs and Lehman and the other companies put so much emphasis on hiring 3rd worlders in the first place. Are no americans available or do they work cheaper?? I dont think they are cheaper in the US,, Certainly they are cheaper in an offshore complex/calling center ect, but not in the US. In a industry as important as finance,, the medium of exchange for all industry, should have americans in the first place.  Why not?????   KF </p>

		<p>That all sounds very nice, but there is one massive fly in this ointment. The majority of those who are now leaving have taken up citizenship and you can bet your last dollar that they will hang on to it for dear life. Things are bound to change and the west has a solid infrastructure and middle class that is essential for an economy to succeed, India, China and all those developing countries do not, they are successful now because they exploit the peasant class. So when things do change, they will be the first on the plane &#8220;back home&#8221;. Remember, when the war broke out in Lebanon, there were 50,000 &#8220;Canadian citizens&#8221; demanding repatriation.</p>

<p>Sorry, old boy, but that&rsquo;s not true.  We created this country, plus so many advancements it would take quite a bit of space to list them all.</p>
<p>But it won&rsquo;t matter whether you&rsquo;re in Britain or the US the entire West is going to implode into about the biggest contentious mess in recent times.</p>
<p>It just isn&rsquo;t possible to create a rainbow utopia with all the various races and ethnicities holding hands and smiling in harmonious unity.  Every tribe in the West is fighting over something.  The blacks will never be able to compete on a level playing field, so their criminality will continue on and will increase as the world economy plummets.  There are so many militant, murderous Muslims, especially in Britain and France, the possibility of murderous, large scale attacks are a reality of life.  They too will increase in hostility.</p>
<p>Can you point out even one single extremely pluralistic society in the history of the world that didn&rsquo;t erupt into divisiveness, with most fighting bloody civil wars?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t, of course, because there haven&rsquo;t been any.  The Western Empire, especially the US, like Rome and Britain will fall due to multiracialism and a departure from homogeniety.</p>
<p>So this debate about losing foreigners shouldn&rsquo;t even be an issue, because as soon as this economic whirlwind has blasted its way around the world much havoc will lay in its path.  </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because every employer, including those who employ research scientists and every university admissions officer is ferociously monitored by the federal government and non white advocacy groups  to hire and admit only non white immigrants. Employers who hire whites are subject to enormous fines and years of expensive litigation and court awards by non white advocacy organizations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an administrative assistant at a major university.  I have worked in many departments, including engineering, chemistry, physics, the medical school research department, computer programming and other hard science departments.</p>
<p>I can tell you that the admission process is extremely biased against white americans. White americans with the highest qualifications are routinely turned away in favor of non whites with lesser qualifications.</p>
<p>Almost every researcher in the medical school is a mainland Chinese in America under some sort of indentured servant visa.  Many have worked there for decades.</p>
<p>What is really bad is the hiring process when the students have completed their expensive and ardous studies.</p>
<p>This is the racial/immigration preference method the companies use in hiring science graduates.It is mandated by the federal government affirmative action policies.</p>
<p>First preference is non white foreigners on student visas.  They are hired in October and November of their last year.</p>
<p>Next is non white foreign immigrants who are not yet citizens. They get hired in January through March.</p>
<p>Next is non white foreigners who are citizens.  They are hired April through August.</p>
<p>Last is native born white Americans whose families have been in this country for hundreds of years and built this country.</p>
<p>By the time all the non white foreigners are hired, there are no jobs left for the white americans.</p>
<p>I have seen this for years.  The white americans often end up with temporary jobs TESTING VIDEO GAMES.  These jobs start in August and end December 1st because the new video games go on sale for the Christmas shopping season.</p>
<p>The other 2 options for white american science grads are the military and high school math teaching.  </p>
<p>The military is happy to take any and all science and engineering graduates.  So they can get a job. But of course promotions in the military are strictly based on race and gender.  Supervisors who wish to promote a white male american officer to a higher rank are forced to justify via lenghy memos, evidence and proofs that the white male officer should be promoted in stead of a female or non white male. So it&rsquo;s a lot easier for a commander to reccomend a not white female for the promotion.</p>
<p>The military is under orders to discriminate against white male americans as much as the private sector and government agencies. So the young science grad does get a job as a military officer, but he is forced to retire after 20 years because he cannot be promoted above major.</p>
<p>The real brain drain in America is the fact that the best and the brightest, white men have been forced out of medicine, science, government, university teaching and just about every job but financial speculation and law.</p>
<p>I get so angry when I read all those editorials about young americans taking easy liberal arts courses and not going into science and engineering.  </p>
<p>The hard truth is, young americans don&rsquo;t go into engineering and science because they know they won&rsquo;t get jobs when they graduate.</p>
<p>I believe microsoft, google and the other big IT companies have stopped hiring white americans altogether and have fired those who were working for those companies.</p>
<p>College isn&rsquo;t free in america scientist.  It can cost $200,000 just for undergraduate work at a private university.  Non whites, even those from very wealthy families are offered complete scholarships. White americans, even those from poor families must take out student loans and pay them back.</p>
<p>So why should white americans spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to prepare for a job when our own federal government forbids companies from hiring white americans?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why whites americans don&rsquo;t take the science and engineering courses any more. They can&rsquo;t get jobs in those fields.</p>
<p>The other option for white american science and engineering graduates is teaching high and middle school math.  Of course non white females are the prefered teachers, but they generally can&rsquo;t pass the math test for the math teacher&rsquo;s certificate.  So white male americans can get those jobs.</p>
<p>The white male american teachers are loathed and hated by the non white females who run the schools.  The white male teachers are constantly harassed and abused.  They have to be on their guard at all times against false accusations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a nightmare to be a white teacher in the public schools because of the discrimination and hatred directed against whites.  Just ask amren poster Bon.</p>
<p>One of the Chinese immigrant students and I became very friendly, we still keep in touch.  His Father is a very smart guy.  The student came to America with his family legally when he was 11 years old.  The parents became citizens when he was about 15.  The clever Father however, delayed his son&rsquo;s citizenship process until a few months after the student graduated from college.</p>
<p>By the time the son entered college, the Father realized that his son&rsquo;s chances of being hired would be better if could check legal resident non citizen on his applications.  That&rsquo;s why they delayed citizenship until the son graduated and was hired.</p>
<p>The real brian drain in this country is the fact that our own government has banned the best and the brightest, our own native born white american men from so many jobs and occupations, including, medicine, engineering, IT, math and science.<br>

		<p>Hey scientist, contrary to your opinion that American white men are too dumb and lazy to work as scientists, read this story.</p>
<p>It is quite common here in America to find a white male American PHD scientist doing this kind of work because of discrimination against white men.</p>
<p>Silicon valley in California is full of middle-aged white American men who invented and developed the computer industry who are now lucky to be delivering pizzas or working as telemarketers.</p>
<p>There are no young white men working in Silicon valley or for Microsoft because of the discrimination against white men.</p>
<p>HUNTSVILLE, Ala.  &mdash;   </p>
<p>A scientist-turned-van driver in Alabama whose work helped two other men win this year&rsquo;s chemistry Nobel Prize is headed to Sweden to watch them collect the award.</p>
<p>Douglas Prasher told The Huntsville Times he was flying to Stockholm on Thursday at the invitation of winners Martin Chalfie and Roger Tsien.</p>
<p>Prasher was a researcher in the 1980s when he isolated and copied a gene that makes some jellyfish glow green. His grant money ran out and he gave a copy of the gene to Chalfie and Tsien.</p>
<p>Chalfie and Tsien won the $1.4 million prize for figuring out how to use the glow to study cells. A third scientist shared the award for discovering the protein in the 1960s.</p>
<p>The 57-year-old Prasher has struggled to find work as a biochemist and now drives a courtesy van for a Toyota dealership in Huntsville.</p>
<p>Information from: The Huntsville Times, http://www.al.com/hsvtimes/hsv.html</p>
<p>What a country, a man who discovered a gene that led to a Nobel Prize can&rsquo;t get any sort of job in his field due to our viciously racist government&rsquo;s affirmative action laws is making $10.00 per hour driving a van.</p>
<p>Had Prasher been anything other than a white male, he would have been showered with grant money from all directions. He&rsquo;d still be a researcher and he would have been awarded the Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>But as the most discriminated against demographic in the country, he has been reduced to doing what any 16 year old middle school dropout can do, driving a car dealership van.  </p>
<p>He&rsquo;s lucky to have that job.  If the EEOC feminazis read the article, the dealership will probably be ordered to fire him and hire an illegal immigrant non white female.</p>
<p>Note one of the names of the nominees, Tsien.<br>

<p>   Mr. Scientist, I believe you miss the point. Most of our legal immigration is from the chain migration of relatives of  poorly educated Latin American immigrants, Third World refugees, and social engineering style &#8220;diversity&#8221; Lotteries. The number of scientists and engineers as a percentage of our overall large immigration total is relatively small.  I have no objection to highly educated immigrants as long as they don&rsquo;t displace native workers.</p>

		<p>I am curious about something. Why is it that all of the elites in the West insist that all Western nations must perennially flood their nations with immigrants. Did not the East Asian NIC&rsquo;s and Western Europe rise to the top of the world&rsquo;s economic heap without flooding their nations with all of these brainy professional types? Did Japan need to flood its nation with immigrants in order to be successful? Japan flooded its nation neither with brainy cream of the crop immigrants, nor with bottom of the barrel dregs cheap labor immigrants. They did it all with their own people, who are called the Japanese. </p>
<p>This whole steaming pile of manure called &#8220;we need floods of immigrants or the economy will collapse&#8221; needs to be called out as the pile that it is.</p>
<p>A clue is in the article. According to this corporate hack, the success of the US dot com was created by having a labor force made up of 90% cheap labor, can&rsquo;t code to save their lives immigrants from India. These same immigrants produced a Mount Everest of garbage code all through the 1990&rsquo;s, almost all of which had to be recoded by the few American coders who were not forced to train their replacements and then fired. These same immigrants destroyed the entire US IT industry and took millions of highly skilled IT workers with them. Decades worth of intellectual knowledge built up in the minds of millions of our best and brightest workers was MOAB&rsquo;ed at the altar of cheap labor.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these same Hindu 1-B job thieves were never even immigrants in the first place. Instead, they are &#8220;non-immigrant guest workers&#8221;.</p>
<p>Someone run this by me one more time. The Hindu 1-B American Skilled Worker Destroying Device was necessary in what way now?</p>

		<p>A few years back Joseph Sobran predicted that our children would go to Asia in search of menial jobs.</p>
<p>I suspected he was right.  At that time the world&rsquo;s manufacturing power centers had already shifted to Asia.  Shortly the world&rsquo;s financial power centers will have shifted to Asia.  And shortly thereafter, the world R&D; power centers will have move to Asia.  Anybody who doubts this latter assertion hasn&rsquo;t noted all the East Asian and Indian scientists who constitute so much of the intellectual capital in American R&D; today.</p>
<p>Sobran was right, and the downfall will accelerate as the bottom is reached with stunning speed.  </p>

<p>Any Westerner knows that America opens it&rsquo;s arms to our European brothers and sisters so I suspect you aren&rsquo;t a real Britain but one of those hyphenated euphemisms they invented to make you feel better about yourself.  If your not, I apologize.  I used to work in computer science back in the early 90s but saw the writing on the wall when they replaced well payed American workers with $5.00 an hour imports to write lines of code.  </p>

<p>This is an important point. My father was a mechanical engineer who held a couple of patents and a design award. Increasingly in the 1970s and 80s he worked for firms which did considerable business with the Feds. The government took strict count of &#8220;minorities&#8221; employed by these firms and, because blacks and mestizos were obviously thin on the ground in high tech work, Asians were the clear answer. The notion that these people are in and of themselves indispensable in simply absurd.</p>

<p>Your story kept me awake last night. </p>
<p>Things are much worse than I thought  &mdash;  although working in the government schools as I do, I know every word of what you wrote is true.  I&rsquo;ve heard similar stories in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>I worry about my children and grandchildren  &mdash;  my son (age 15) aspires to be either a laproscopic surgeon or a medical researcher specializing in virology. </p>
<p>How will I explain to him that these professions are not open to him, because of his blond hair and blue eyes, despite his drive, focus, intelligence, hard work and sacrifice?  How do you think he will feel when he sees others with lesser abilities being &#8216;awarded&rsquo; undeserved, unearned college admissions, job placements and advancements?</p>
<p>Will this be the end of White creativity, innovation and achievement?  Which racial group will come forward to match White achievements in technology, law, economics, medicine and science?</p>
<p>This is what will be lost by suppressing Whites:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The great ideas of the West &mdash; rationalism, self-criticism, the disinterested search for truth, the separation of church and state, the rule of law and equality under the law, freedom of thought and expression, human rights, and liberal democracy &mdash; are superior to any others devised by humankind&hellip;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Can&rsquo;t wait to see what great inventions come out of India  &mdash;  after all didn&rsquo;t they land a man on the moon, send probes into outer space, invent computers, televisions and the IT industry with all of their innovative technical knowledge?  Didn&rsquo;t they gift  the world with clean water, antibiotics, vaccinations, jet propulsion, refrigeration, electrical grids and the discovery of germ theory  &mdash;  saving untold billions of lives? Didn&rsquo;t they create modern First World cities with abundant power, advanced transportation systems, and sanitary sewage systems? Other countries look to India, don&rsquo;t they, to copy the financial and economic systems they created?  Financial and economic systems that have lifted billions out of poverty?</p>

		<p>Mr. Robert Lindsey I agree.  The only reason India has an active IT industry going in there is because of outsourcing.  In Canada, United States and England, there are countless brilliant IT experts and software developers.  The opinion &#8220;India has a very active IT industry because Indians are smart&#8221; is nothing more than a statement caused by ignorance and political correctness.  The IT experts in North America and Europe are extremely talented.   </p>
<p>Just like the man who first designed the basic formula for what turned out to be a Nobel-prize winning research&hellip;.</p>
<p>I am not sure if other AmRen members are familiar with the Linux kernel, but the Linux kernel was first developed by a Finnish software developer.  A lot of IT designers agree that it is one of the hardest codes in the world to work with.  You must be very familiar with the CPU cycles and the assembly language.  I browsed through the code change log and most of the latest code modifications were done by people in North America, Europe and East Asia.  I saw multiple modifications done by people from U Penn.  </p>
<p>I have a friend named Andy who was born in Canada, has Chinese parents, and holds a degree in computer science.  He told me a couple of weeks ago that he was going to submit his resume to Wal-Mart, and it broke my heart.  And then a few days later, he told me he will attend a local community college for a semester in order to take some courses in order to become a financial analyst.  He told me he is trying to catch two birds with one stone&hellip;. work as a financial analyst, and use his finance knowledge and skills in order to be successful in the stock market.  A lot of people in my undergraduate program are seriously considering starting their own businesses because it is too challenging to be hired in the IT industry in North America nowadays.  </p>

<p>    To Korean Guy, </p>
<p>    China&rsquo;s manufacturing revolution took off only because<br>
    of Western industrial and technological outsourcing to<br>
    China.  China never created those technologies that it uses<br>
    to manufacture products it exports.  Where would China be<br>
    without Western technological inputs?</p>
<p>    Why would it be different in India&rsquo;s case with respect to<br>
    IT offshoring??</p>
<p>    In both cases, its Cheap Labor that attracts Western <br>
    Companies, be it in manufacturing or service sector.</p>

<p>I noticed some amren readers seemed to have fallen for the comment posted by scientist.After sensitively reading his comment  I can bet my last dollar that the british scientist is not british in the sense we normally would understand. Britain has been for the last 50 years swamped with south asians to such extent that those &#8220;new british&#8221; have now penetrated all fabrics of british society. And now these  &#8220;passport british&#8221; are coming to america masquerading as british scientists.<br>
We all know the score.<br>
1. The genuine british scientists do not emigrate from britain, at most they cooperate with american or other western scientists on joint projects.Really rarely there is a western scientist these days who needs to emigrate.Now, by scientists I do not mean zombie-heads filled with book knowledge and spouted out from the conveyor belts of our universities.<br>
2. The scientist&rsquo;s admiration for first generation /meaning third world/ immigrants betrays where his tribal allegiance lies. Stats prove that these first-generation immigrants fullfil only supportive and mechanical work they labouriously memorized in our universities.Not a single one of them came up with any breakthrough ideas. How strange.<br>
3.He derives his perverted pride from consoling himself that american science would have died without the likes of him. What an arrogant lie! Such haughtiness is anything but british. Such pattern of reasoning is all too typical of deluded self-importance of third world &#8220;talent&#8221;.<br>
No offence, but there is nooo way the guy is genuine british.</p>

<p>Thank you for posting that informative link on India&rsquo;s future.  This article here on Amren has been really getting me down lately, and after I read the article you placed a link to, my spirits were lifted.  I haven&rsquo;t read the stuff over on Vdare in a while, and I am glad to see that such an article was posted over there. </p>
<p>I posted that article over on a website called &#8220;Liberty Post&#8221;.  I encourage more people from here to get involved over there.  LP is a website where a great deal of people post who are fed up with both political parties.  A large minority of people over there agree with what is said on here, but a lot of people still refuse to, even though they seem quite convertable. They seem to be pretty rational on issues of immigration even if they don&rsquo;t agree with all the IQ stuff. I feel that if we have more people over there posting articles and getting involved in discussions maybe we could make a huge impact.</p>

Wow. A lot of comments on my last post.</p>
<p>First off, I am a white-as-white can be Englishman with not a trace of anything in his genes other than Angle, Saxon and Jute, I would suspect (unless an ancestor of mine had fun with those naughty Normans a thousand years ago).</p>
<p>Second, I think Affirmative Action has failed and would repeal that kind of measure, at the higher education  level at least.</p>
<p>Thirdly, I direct a research group of 30 people of whom ALL BUT ONE are non-US citizens. (15 are Chinese/Indians, no Latinos). Why so many foreigners? Not due to any official bias, as was claimed above - there simply are proportionally few competitive US applicants, that&rsquo;s all. </p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m quite happy working with Asians, when I can actually understand what they are saying to me, but I do lament that there is not a larger proportion of Americans in my operation. <br>
Certainly, it would be more fun socializing.  I have run research operations of similar sizes in other countries and the &#8216;natives&rsquo; always outnumbered the foreigners there.</p>
<p>Again contrary to one statement above, I don&rsquo;t think European American kids are too lazy or dumb to become scientists. I&rsquo;m not sure where the problem lies in fact. But it&rsquo;s clearly at a level below, meaning at the level of school, societal and parental influences, and it&rsquo;s also a question of what value society places on scientific achievement relative to, say, banking/lawyering.  If European American kids are encouraged  to get more interested in the sciences, then there is every reason to hope for a bright future for them in this regard. </p>

<p>Thanks for the wonderful post.  Anyways I am glad you are thinking of considering Liberty Post.  I think registering is very easy and doesn&rsquo;t require that much information.  It has been a while since I signed up so I have forgotten.  But I don&rsquo;t think it really takes that much.</p>

         Bon, </p>
<p>         Actually the Indians just recently sent a space-craft<br>
         to the moon, if I remember correctly, Chandrayaan 1. </p>
<p>         From what I&rsquo;ve read, they are apparently planning <br>
         more space expeditions like sending a spacecraft to <br>
         orbit the sun, even a manned moon mission in the next <br>
         decade.<br>

<p>Yes, and good for them!</p>
<p>Only 39 years after Whites first set foot on the moon.</p>
<p>Seems they&rsquo;re a little behind us wouldn&rsquo;t you say?</p>
<p>I fear, what with the current economic situation such as it is in the US, our glory days exploring outer space are probably over. </p>
<p>Nice while it lasted.</p>
<p>Looks like the East Indians and Chinese will take our innovations, creations, and the ground work we Whites set down and run with them.</p>
<p>Bon</p>

<p>             You are mistaken.  Its not possible to sell such<br>
             advanced technology.  Space technology is part of<br>
             what is classified as &#8220;Dual-Use&#8221;  technology.  <br>
             There are international technology denial regimes<br>
             in place that prevent such sales.  Russia is part<br>
             of this regime, so no it didn&rsquo;t sell any technology<br>
             like this.  </p>
<p>             Also no country will give such advanced technology<br>
             like this to another.  <br>

<p>Okay so then how did the Indians get the technology?  You can&rsquo;t say they did it on their own if somebody else did it first.  I will tell you that before you even answer.  And European countries are giving Asian countries technology all the time.  Either that or the Asians steal it by spying on us.</p>

So you are implying in this sentence that you not only have such advanced technology but also it is indigenous. To kindly lead you out of your delusion i send some links to get you in touch.<br>

         Courtney, </p>
<p>         Your reasoning is wrong.  Just because the Indians<br>
         didn&rsquo;t do it first doesn&rsquo;t mean that they couldn&rsquo;t <br>
         have figured it out eventually on their own.   </p>
<p>         You apparently didn&rsquo;t understand the type of <br>
         technology that is being dealt with here.  Space tech<br>
         also has strategic importance.  European countries <br>
         have not sold such advanced tech like this to other <br>
         countries.   If such a thing was happening, then we<br>
         would have seen many, many more countries with space<br>
         capabilities and assets.  </p>
<p>         Basically, there is only a limited number of countries<br>
         with such capability.  So you are wrong, my dear.   <br>
           </p>

         To 7:36 AM on December 20, </p>
<p>         The links that you posted above do not prove that the<br>
         Indian moon mission was accomplished through pilfering<br>
         Russian technology.  Nowhere does it say that the <br>
         Indians purchased or indulged in espionage to get such<br>
         technology.   The links simply talk about some low-key<br>
         defence deals.  </p>
<p>         The nuclear energy deal is simply about legitimizing<br>
         civil nuclear trade with India by the rest of the <br>
         world.  Has nothing to do with space.  </p>
<p> <br>
         The Nuclear submarines are being LEASED, not sold nor<br>
         even the technology either.  The Indians are building<br>
         their own Nuke Sub.  Trials are expected by mid-2009.<br>
         The reason they are leasing in the first place is to<br>
         plug any gaps in the present operational readiness if<br>
         need be.      </p>
<p><br>
         As for the manned moon mission, if you read the <br>
         link carefully, the Indians are designing a space-<br>
         craft based on their own parametres.  Had they <br>
         been sourcing Russian technology as you claim,<br>
         that would not be the case.      </p>
