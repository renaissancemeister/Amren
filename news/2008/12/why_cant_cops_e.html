			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jack Dunphy, Pajamas Media, December 8, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In Los Angeles, we will soon learn the results of a petition drive aimed at placing [1] Jamiel&rsquo;s Law on ballots for the city&rsquo;s May 2009 municipal election. The proposed law, written by upstart mayoral candidate [2] Walter Moore, would give Los Angeles Police Department officers a more active role in identifying and apprehending illegal alien street gang members. Currently, LAPD officers are for the most part prohibited from taking action against illegal aliens under the terms of [3] Special Order 40, a 1979 revision to the department&rsquo;s regulations. The &#8220;Jamiel&#8221; of the law&rsquo;s title refers to Jamiel Shaw, a 17-year-old Los Angeles resident who was shot and killed last March. That a young man should meet such a fate is, sadly, not all that uncommon in some parts of Los Angeles, but what made Jamiel&rsquo;s murder all the more tragic is the manifest failure of his government, both local and federal, to prevent it from happening.</p>
<p>The man accused of murdering Jamiel and now awaiting trial is Pedro Espinoza, a 19-year-old illegal alien from Mexico. News reports have chronicled Espinoza&rsquo;s [4] lengthy criminal history as well as his membership in the 18th Street gang, which taken together might be expected to have attracted the attention of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agents. Alas, only a day before he allegedly murdered Jamiel Shaw, Espinoza was released from Los Angeles County Jail after serving a sentence for brandishing a handgun at a public park. Systems already in place at the jail should have identified Espinoza as a deportable alien and landed him in the clutches of ICE agents. How exactly those systems failed in this case has yet to be satisfactorily explained.</p>
<p>The effort to enact Jamiel&rsquo;s Law is merely the latest effort to rescind or modify Special Order 40, which was intended to allay non-citizens&rsquo; fear of the police and secure their cooperation in reporting crimes to the police. {snip}</p>
<p>But any attempts to further involve LAPD officers in immigration enforcement must sail into strong political headwinds. Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa (who was shameless enough to attend Jamiel Shaw&rsquo;s funeral) is a former president of the L.A. chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, and he still embraces that organization&rsquo;s views on [8] immigrants&rsquo; rights. {snip}</p>
<p>Matters will no doubt be made worse &mdash; far, far worse &mdash; with the installation of the Obama administration in January. Anyone who thinks Eric Holder, Obama&rsquo;s nominee for attorney general, will be a vigilant defender of the borders is sadly deluded, and there is little chance Holder will facilitate the type of local-federal cooperation envisioned in Jamiel&rsquo;s Law. {snip}</p>
<p>If the illegal alien problem has not yet arrived in your community, you won&rsquo;t have long to wait. Some will call it progress, and they won&rsquo;t mind a bit if a few people get killed &mdash; or raped or robbed or what have you &mdash; as a cost of it.</p>

		<p>If the victim had been white, none of this would have happened.In San Francisco, a few monthes ago the exact same thing happened, but the victim killed was hispanic.Employees of the city of San Francisco are prohibited from identifying illegal aliens, if they do then they will lose their job. Pinko mayor Newsom supports this.</p>

		<p>Without question, the world will have to collapse into total anarchy for the issues of sovereignty to be settled correctly. Hopefully, our fellow Whites have learned the correct lessons regarding what *not* to do when the time for revolution emerges.<br>

		<p>Oh, now the officers will be given more active roles in helping society. This is just one example proving that our government is not for us. There was no preparation for the worst that could possibly occur in opening the floodgates for illegals. Knee-jerk reactions don&rsquo;t cut it. </p>
<p>Seinfeld joked about the cops standing around could pick up a broom and help keep the city clean. I wish we could trust the reverse, county sanitation workers to proceed as cops in identifying and apprehending illegals. Hell, we can&rsquo;t even trust the cops working for us. Not bashing on cops. Trust is hard to earn.</p>

		<p>     The politicians don&rsquo;t want the immigration laws enforced. They want more cheap labor, more people to vote for them, and finally, they want to destroy out country so they can have complete control over what is left. &#8216;Nuff said ?</p>

		<p>So this Jamiel must have been a black huh??? Because they sure didn&rsquo;t mind it when the illegals were killing whites. Maybe if they kill enough blacks or maybe a few muslims, then washington might take some action???? Throw a few indians into that mix and look out&hellip;.ole barak will deal with them so severly&hellip;.he will cut a few bucks from their welfare checks!</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;The proposed law, written by upstart mayoral candidate [2] Walter Moore&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The ballot measure received the required number of signature necessary to place it on the March 2009 regional ballot  &mdash;  no thanks to the local yellow press (LA Times, LA Daily Kos) which did not much publicize this sad case.  I hope Walter Moore is keeping a close eye on the city clerk as the signatures are verified  &mdash;  I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if the petitions were thrown out due to a &#8216;high number of unverifiable signatures.&rsquo;</p>
<p>If it weren&rsquo;t for local Talk Radio in LA, particularly Doug McIntyre and John &amp; Ken, no one around here would know Walter Moore exists or that Jamiel Shaw was murdered by an illegal alien gang member with a long criminal history. Both rags ignore Walter Moore completely and have dismissed the Jamiel Shaw murder.</p>
<p>Walter Moore writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Right now, L.A. Mayor Villaraigosa&rsquo;s &#8216;sanctuary city&rsquo; policy prevents our police from enforcing our immigration laws against any illegal aliens&hellip;The Mayor could end &#8216;sanctuary city&rsquo; protection for gang members with the stroke of a pen.  But he refuses to do so.  The City Council is just as bad.  They refuse even to vote on the matter&hellip;.We, the people, therefore need to put law on the ballot&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>What I find so strange is that the usual black &#8216;leaders&rsquo; and politicians aren&rsquo;t all over this screaming to the media and mustering up agitators for loud demonstrations demanding the repeal of Special Order 40 and sanctuary city policies  &mdash;  blacks have been ethnically cleansed, often through intimidation and murder, by hispanics in many parts of LA. Former black areas such as Compton and Watts are now majority hispanic. </p>
<p>Few of those black politicians will be around for very much longer as their districts continue to change color, not in their favor.  Once the hispanics take control politically, there will be no turning back (for blacks or Whites).</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m puzzled. The drinking age, the smoking age, and all drug laws are federal laws. Using the logic the federal government and others are using for immigration, why can local police enforce those laws? Shouldn&rsquo;t federal police be required to bust sixteen year olds when they smoke? When a liquor store owner takes a look at &#8220;McLovin&rsquo;s&#8221; fake id, they should say &#8220;Get outta here before I call the ATFE!&#8221; Any traffic stop where marijuana is found should immediately require DEA attention. Why the inconsistancies? </p>

		<p>L.A. is a unique city, it has a population of citizens whom would be at home in the worst of 3rd world countries, but it has the financial backing of the richest government in the world, it is a liberal utopia, controlled politically by socialist, I&rsquo;m afraid there is no hope and it will only get worse under our current political leadership.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not so strange Bon. The black leadership is paid very well by the Democrats to be part of the black/hispanic/asian/white feminazi coalition against whites.</p>
<p>Have you ever heard of a black &#8220;leader&#8221; who has a normal job, even a government affirmative action job?  No way.  They all work for federally and state funded non profits organized by the democrats.  They will not risk their $100,000 plus salaries, free cars and credit cards, and other benefits including no show jobs for relatives by going against their marxist liberal masters.  They will do exactly what they are told.</p>

		<p>&#8220;L.A. is a unique city, it has a population of citizens whom would be at home in the worst of 3rd world countries,&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working an extra holiday job as a bartender in a Santa Monica hotel very popular with European and Australian tourists and American business and professional organizations. Santa Monica is a small town on the ocean surrounded by Los Angeles. It&rsquo;s a big hotel and does a lot of convention business.  The hotel has the big function roooms so the conventioneers stay and go to the events in the same hotel.</p>
<p>I started the middle of November.</p>
<p>I have been hearing from these tourists and convention goers that they don&rsquo;t even want to go through Los Angeles on the airport shuttle, that the city deteriorates every time they come through.  &#8220;It&rsquo;s getting more and more like Calcutta every year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of the convention organizers pick this hotel specifically because it is not within the city limits of Los Angeles.  The tourists no longer stay 2 weeks like they did 20 years ago I have been told by the beverage manager.  They just stay a couple days, do the tourist attractions in white, safe west Los Angeles and then move on to other parts of the country.</p>
<p>The tourists move on because although the tourist attractions are still in and around Los Angeles, going through our third world city is just too disgusting. </p>
<p>The ride from the airport to Santa Monica runs along a street that I consider perfectly normal. But of course I am used to the third world appearance and inhabitants of Los Angeles. The tourists think it goes through a horrible slum with traffic crawling along at 5 miles per hour.</p>
<p>I have also, very discreetly of course, asked several foreign tourists what their country thinks of Obama&rsquo;s election.  It seems that the rest of the world is not in the state of euphoria and rapture about Obama that our marxist media claims.</p>
<p>Even the liberal Australians and Europeans think Obama will be a bad President. They also think his election was a conspiracy by powerful elites. The Asians and Eastern European reaction to Obama would constitute hate speech so I won&rsquo;t repeat it.</p>
