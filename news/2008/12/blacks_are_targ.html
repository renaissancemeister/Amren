			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Timisha Dixon, NY African American Community Examiner, December 17, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It is evident that the posters of the extremely anti-African American and minority comments from the previous blog post have strong opinions about whom they believe are committing crimes.  I like to deal in the factual, and according to Human Rights First, African American&rsquo;s are still among the highest levels of victims of violent crime&hellip; check out the facts and statistics here [https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/pdf/fd/08/fd-080924-usa-web.pdf].</p>
<p>There is no way to deny something when the statistical research is right in front of your face. Often, the problem is that although this report from Human Rights first gives an enumeration of incidents in which African Americans and other minorities were victims of hate, many of these crimes are unreported because minorities, mainly African American&rsquo;s feel like they don&rsquo;t have the LUXURY of complaining, afraid of what might happen to their families and friends heaven forbid it gets media attention- which it RARELY does. Working ourselves into an emotional frenzy when we are mistreated or misrepresented to some is interpreted as us &#8220;asking for yet another apology for slavery, or reparations&#8221;. Yet when racist people so vehemently hate, there is no doubt in my mind that most of this is hate is driven by emotion!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s evident that Hal Turner is extremely emotionally disturbed about his failure in his radio career, and uses an experience he had at 14 for justifying his failures- which fuels more hate! Rather hypocritical don&rsquo;t you think? Yes, he has the right to hate any one he wants- but there is one thing I&rsquo;ll commit my LIFE to, if you are going to hate, then learn to hate THE TRUTH!</p>
<p>Here is a small excerpt from the report, detailing the crimes reported against African Americans:</p>
<p>&#8220;Monitors in the United States generally categorize incidents of racist and xenophobic violence by victim&rsquo;s race, ethnicity, or national origin, although there is often considerable overlap of these categories. Attacks motivated by racism and xenophobia are also often fueled by religious antipathy, gender bias, or other forms of prejudice.</p>
<p>The highest levels of violent hate crime continue to be directed toward members of the African-American community and others of African origin. In the latest report, covering 2006, the FBI found that over a third of the total victims of hate crime violence were targeted because of anti black bias. A high incidence of racist attacks on black Americans is also reported by municipal and county hate crimes monitors.</p>
<p>In other racist and xenophobic attacks, hate crimes targeting people of Hispanic or Latino origin rose nationwide by one third since 2003.</p>
<p>Racist violence also targeted people of Asian origin. These included attacks on persons of South Asian origin, who were sometimes targeted in the belief they were Muslims and from the Middle East.</p>
<p>A. Hate Crimes Targeting Black Americans</p>
<p>A review of the record of antiblack hate crimes in 2007 and the first half of 2008 reveals a pattern of both serious crimes &mdash; including murder, sexual assaults, and beatings &mdash; and of everyday violence affecting daily lives of ordinary people, often at the hands of neighbors, coworkers, or fellow students; in their homes, schools, churches, and elsewhere in their own communities. In many cases, hate crimes against black Americans echoed past policies, practices, and societal norms of racial segregation. Black families faced harassment and violence expressly intended to drive them out of particular neighborhoods; black workers were made unwelcome in predominantly white workplaces, black students faced harassment and violence at schools, and black churches were targeted for racist graffiti and arson.</p>
<p>The FBI&rsquo;s hate crime report for 2006 recorded 3,332 victims of antiblack bias crimes, in 2,640 incidents. This represented 66.4 percent of the victims of racial bias crimes, and 34.5 percent of the 9,652 victims of hate crimes overall.3 Of 2,042 total offenses, 65 percent were crimes against persons (in contrast to 56.5 percent of such crimes among hate crime offenses overall). Higher rates were reported only in anti-Hispanic crimes (72.8 percent) and sexual orientation bias crimes (71 percent). The FBI breakdown identified one antiblack bias homicide and three cases of forcible rape. There were 395 cases of aggravated assault, 564 of simple assault, and 1,079 of intimidation. Crimes against property totaled 1,088, including 9 cases of arson and 980 cases of &#8220;destruction/damage/vandalism.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Murder and Attempted Murder</b></p>
<p>Frequently reported hate crimes against black Americans took the form of physical assaults on individuals, including beatings, shootings, and stabbings. A number of these incidents led to arrests and prosecutions.</p>
<p>In Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 2007, three men were charged with a hate crime and attempted murder for shouting racial epithets and allegedly firing a shotgun at two black Department of Public Works employees.</p>
<p><b>2008 Hate Crime Survey &mdash; A Human Rights First Report</b></p>
<p>On June 11, 2008, in Marshfield, Massachusetts, an estimated dozen assailants shouted racial epithets at an African-American man, chased him, and then &#8220;kicked, stabbed and hit until he was nearly unconscious,&#8221; according to police. Four suspects were detained and faced hate crime and attempted murder charges.</p>
<p>On January 20, 2008, in Omaha, Nebraska, Brittany Williams, a 21-year-old African American college student, was shot to death at a local drivein. Prosecutors noted that the murderer&rsquo;s &#8220;own words &mdash; and the circumstances of the shooting &mdash; point to the [murder] as being race-based.&#8221;</p>
<p>In June 2008, in Eugene, Oregon, three young white men attacked a 59-year-old African-American man, beating him with a baseball bat. According to police reports, the victim suffered &#8220;facial, jaw and skull injuries&#8221; requiring extensive surgeries. The incident was investigated as a hate crime.</p>
<p>In Seattle, Washington, in March 2008, two white men yelling racial slurs attacked a 24-year-old black man at a bus stop. Police announced two arrests on charges of second-degree assault, firstdegree robbery, and malicious harassment (the latter is based on Washington&rsquo;s hate crime law).</p>
<p><b>Hangman&rsquo;s Nooses and Burning Crosses</b></p>
<p>Rope nooses and cross burnings are potent symbols of racist terror and intimidation and a reminder of the lynchings of African Americans that took place in the United States prior to the 1960&rsquo;s civil rights movement. Regretably, these symbols are still employed to send messages of racial hatred, and figure in crimes of violence against persons and property motivated by racial bias. On September 1, 2006, two nooses were hung from a tree in a schoolyard in Jena, Louisiana, that set in motion protests and further noose-hanging incidents that continued throughout 2007.</p>
<p>A demonstration involving participants from across the United States was held in Jena on September 20, 2007, protesting the failure to address the noose incident as a hate crime and the disproportionate response by law enforcement authorities to offences attributed to black youths following the initial incident. The Southern Poverty Law Center documented as many as 50 incidents involving nooses in a &#8220;racist backlash&#8221; to the demonstration over the following months.</p>
<p>The intimidating use of the hangman&rsquo;s noose, along with threatening graffiti and anonymous notes threatening violence, were increasingly reported at schools and colleges in the wake the Jena events. Incidents were recorded on campuses in Mobile, Alabama, Los Angeles, California, New London, Connecticut, Henniker, Vermont, Mount Pleasant, Michigan, and other cities.</p>
<p>In April 2007, the Federal Bureau of Investigation&rsquo;s Hate Crime website said twenty cross burnings, which are defined as a hate crime in most U.S. states, had been reported nationwide since October 2005. Special Agent Carlton L. Peeples, the acting chief of the Civil Rights Unit at the FBI Headquarters, declared that although the incidents were not common, &#8220;when they do take place, they have a huge impact &mdash; not just on the victim but on the entire community.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Threats and Violence at Home and in the Workplace</b></p>
<p>Black and interracial families frequently suffered vandalism, arson, threatening graffiti, verbal threats, and harassment in many parts of the United States. In some cases, racist harassment of neighbors escalated to personal assaults. Many cases of assaults and harassment also occurred in the workplace environment.</p>
<p>The victims included county and municipal workers, medical professionals, clergy, and a wide range of other white and blue collar workers. Some of the most vicious attacks targeted individuals for their close relationship with black Americans, including interracial.</p>
<p><b>The United States &mdash; A Human Rights First Report couples and their children.</b></p>
<p>The hangman&rsquo;s noose or the buring cross were sometimes used to deliever the message of racial hatred in the incidence of violence and property damage targeting black families.</p>
<p>In Brentwood, California, in August 2007, attackers spray-painted and set alight the home of a black family. A vehicle stolen from the family at the same time was found partially &#8220;stripped and burned.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Aurora, Colorado, in December 2007, police charged a 51-year-old man with harassment of another person because &#8220;of that person&rsquo;s actual or perceived race, color, religion, ancestry or national origin.&#8221; The man was allegedly responsible for hanging nooses and inserting razor blades in a black employee&rsquo;s work belt at Arapahoe County Weatherization Department.</p>
<p>On July 19, 2008, a cross was set up and burned in the yard of an interracial couple with four children in Dudley, North Carolina. Police subsequently arrested a neighbor of the victimized family, Dixon Steward, who was charged with ethnic intimidation and a misdemeanor.</p>
<p>In Nashville, Tennessee, in January 2008, an unknown person set fire to a pile of newspapers on a man&rsquo;s doorstep and placed a noose and cross atop the blaze.</p>
<p>In Arlington, Texas on December 19, 2007, a woman attacked a black neighbor, Silk Littlejohn, striking her on the head with a piece of wood while hurling racial epithets. Racist graffiti &mdash; expressing dissatisfaction with Littlejohn&rsquo;s presence in the neighborhood &mdash; was sprayed on the victim&rsquo;s house after the incident. Police charged the 66-year-old woman with a hate crime assault.</p>
<p>In Virginia Beach, in August 2007, vandals painted racist epithets on a car that was then set on fire at the home of &#8220;a white woman who has biracial children.&#8221;</p>
<p>In regards to affirmative action, here is an interesting piece that suggests that affirmative action has benefited the white community as well.</p>
<p>Check this out: A Time/CNN poll found that 80% of the public felt &#8220;affirmative action programs for minorities and women should be continued at some level&#8221; (Roper Center for Public Opinion, 1995a).</p>

		<p>Well, first of all the assertion that blacks are the victims of more &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; than whites is absolutely laughable.  Of course when every crime, no matter how heinous, that is committed against a white person is classified as, &#8220;robbery gone bad&#8221; example: Eve Carson or &#8220;robbery was the motive&#8221; example: Anne Pressly.  We of course know that anti-white rage was absolutely present in both of these cases, not to mention thousands of others, but these will never be called &#8220;hate crimes.&#8221;  </p>

		<p>There are two reasons why hate crimes against whites don&rsquo;t seem as high in the official statistics than they actually are:</p>
<p>(1)  The lassitude of law enforcement in certain jurisdictions to press for hate crime riders against minorities when there is evidence of enmity</p>
<p>(2)  Certain hate crimes committed by minorities (especially blacks) against Jews or homosexuals get put on the books as an anti-Semitic or homophobic hate crime, thereby giving the media the opportunity to smear right-wing anti-Semites and the religious right, but these hate crimes are really anti-white hate crimes misunderstood (probably deliberately so), they really are motivated by race.</p>

		<p>One can speak from now until the end of time about individual hate crimes because they literally happen faster than they can be talked about, but the fact remains that there are far more SERIUOUS hate crimes done against whites than are done against blacks.The majority of interracial incidents of violence are not called hate crimes because there is not a preponderence of evidence to support it in most cases.Does a cross burning count as much as killing someone?It looks like it does, according to the way these statistics are compiled. </p>

		<p>These numbers would be astronomically higher if they were black on white crimes. Note the small numbers of incidents, the reporter was able to point out. Plus there was to begin with,little proof of the race of the perps.  </p>

		<p>In Paul&rsquo;s first letter to the Corinthians he uses a &#8220;what if&#8221; arguement to assure them that their faith is not in vain. If I might paraphrase; &#8220;If Christ is not risen then your faith is in vain and we of all men are most misreable.&#8221; If you apply that same logic here we conclude that our belief in the facts which contradict the writer of the above article - that whites are victims of hate crimes at a far higher rate than minorities - would make us a most miserable people to believe such a falsehood. <br>
My friends, we don&rsquo;t have to despair for a moment! The truth is a constant and though it may be overshadowed at the moment by those who seek to promote their own self interests, in the end their lies and distortions will only bring about their greater ruin!<br>

		<p>As many as half all &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; in the USA are hoaxes.  Don&rsquo;t think that members of the diverse white American peoples are innocent of doing this.  </p>
<p>During the 2008 presidential campaign, a young woman claimed to have been attacked for her McCain bumper strip, but one look at her picture convinced my friends and me that it was a hoax because what was lightly scratched on her cheek was the mirror image of what she was attempting to convey.  </p>
<p>However, fully 98% of all hate crime hoaxes are perpetrated by members of so-called minority groups.  Here is list of clues to determine hate crime hoaxes.</p>
<p>=========================</p>
<p>Generally speaking, any alleged hate crime that meets these three criteria is frequently a hate crime hoax:</p>
<p>(1) There is no witness.</p>
<p>(2) There is a political or academic pay-off in terms of public recognition, pending criminal legislation, financial gain, or canceled tests.</p>
<p>(3) The criminal act is limited to writing, whether on the body of the alleged victim or on property.</p>

		<p>Human Rights First, not to be confused with Human Rights Watch, is a leftist hate whitey outfit. The &#8220;hate crime&#8221; categories they listed included most major races and religions in America, except whites. Out of mind, out of sight.</p>

		<p>If a white person cited various incidents of black-on-white crimes as evidence that such crimes are rampant, this very author would call it &#8220;over-generalizing&#8221; or &#8220;painting an entire race based on the actions of a few,&#8221; yet this is exactly what this writer has done in this article. Notice no actual statistics are used or anything cited other than isolated incidents. For a real treatment of inter-racial crime, one only need read &#8220;The Color of Crime&#8221; here on this site. </p>

		<p>I must say that, while I find this article by Ms. Dixon to be reprehensible race-baiting, I also find some of the comments left on the source article to be equally appalling. If only all race realists could conduct themselves as we do on Amren, without all the name-calling and insults. Fence-sitters must look at this kind of thing and conclude that all race realists are mean spirited hicks. Pity. If you want to know why our message is being rejected by so many whites, you need only look at the crass behavior of many so-called race realists.</p>

		<p>Preliminarily, I feel it is juvenile for AR to publish articles written by someone with a fourth grade education. Please do not let this site degenerate into a freak show, mocking the various &#8220;tamisha&#8221;s of the world.</p>
<p>Secondly, the simplest explanation for the disparity of hate crimes between black&rsquo;s and whites, is that the typical black criminal will always take the victim&rsquo;s wallet no matter what the circumstances. That simple act of thieving greed always provides the justification that the crime was caused by &#8220;economic disparities&#8221; or whatnot and certainly was not caused by &#8220;hate&#8221;</p>

		<p>How these reporters and university researchers get away with portraying themselves as, &#8216;getting to the real, suppressed, truth&rsquo; and busting stereotypes is beyond me. This is the stereotype. One that&rsquo;s well enforced as nearly law. It is the law, actually. It&rsquo;s also an inaccurate stereotype that couldn&rsquo;t possibly be farther from the truth.  </p>

		<p>Figures don&rsquo;t lie, but liars can figure. Why should anyone trust &#8220;Human Rights First?&#8221; Blacks assault whites at a rate many times higher than the reverse; that is a brute fact. </p>
<p>In Tim Wise fashion, this illiterate columnist (&#8220;African American&rsquo;s&#8221; as a plural) attempts to skew crime statistics by redefining what a crime is. Blacks are irremediably obsessed with nooses, burning crosses, and graffiti. Leaving aside the fact that  most of these incidents are hoaxes (see &#8220;Madonna Constantine&#8221;), what person in his right mind would conflate this sort of thing with an actual physical attack?</p>

		<p><a href="https://inductivist.blogspot.com/2008/04/blacks-are-13-times-more-likely-to.html" rel="nofollow">Blacks are 13 times more likely to commit a hate crime</a> by <a href="https://inductivist.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">Inductivist</a></p>
<p><i>Law enforcement statistics show that blacks commit hate crimes at higher rates than whites, but the difference is not huge. The problem with this kind of data is that criminal justice officials must decide whether an incident should be categorized as racially motivated, and hate crime laws were simply not made with the intention of protecting white victims.</i></p>
<p>Another limitation is that Hispanic offenders are lumped together with whites under the &#8220;white&#8221; category.</p>
<p>One way around this problem is to ask victims of crimes themselves if the event was racially motivated, and give them an opportunity to separate whites from Hispanics.</p>
<p>The 2004 National Crime Victimization Survey asked respondents if they had been victims of a racially motivated crime in the past 6 months, and they were also asked the race of the offender with the option of &#8220;other&#8221; in addition to white and black. One hundred and five cases were identified. Here is the percent distribution of the race of offender:</p>
<p><br>
Percent of all racial hate crime offenders</p>
<p>White 21.0<br>
Black 53.3<br>
Other 13.3<br>
Don&rsquo;t know 1.9<br>
Residue 10.5</p>
<p>So, the majority of crimes committed out of racial hatred are perpetrated by blacks, but even this does not show the magnitude of the difference since the U.S. population is only 13% black. Doing the calculations, a black person is 13.3 times more likely than a white to commit this type of crime.</p>
<p>Blacks have a much greater problem with hatred than whites do. That goes all the way up to Reverend Wright and all the way down to the street thug.</p>

		<p>&#8216;A review of the record of antiblack hate crimes in 2007 and the first half of 2008 reveals a pattern of both serious crimes &mdash; including murder, sexual assaults, and beatings &mdash; and of everyday violence affecting daily lives of ordinary people, often at the hands of neighbors, coworkers, or fellow students; in their homes, schools, churches, and elsewhere in their own communities. In many cases, hate crimes against black Americans echoed past policies, practices, and societal norms of racial segregation. Black families faced harassment and violence expressly intended to drive them out of particular neighborhoods; black workers were made unwelcome in predominantly white workplaces, black students faced harassment and violence at schools, and black churches were targeted for racist graffiti and arson.&#8221;</p>
<p>This woman needs to get herself some psychological evaluation. Even a layman can diagnose severe deslusional psychosis with Timisha.<br>
Tamisha, for every &#8220;crime&#8221; you mentioned, I personally can cite five the other way and that is a conservative statement. I can&rsquo;t believe that you really think that anyone is going to buy that nonsense. You brethren have MORE than &#8220;evened the score&#8221; for what happened more than a century ago. In fact the reality is that you are in far more danger of rape and/or murder from one of your own males than you would ever be from one of us.</p>
<p>IF you&rsquo;re out for an even walk some night, I suggest for your own safety, that you do it in a white neighborhood.</p>

		<p>The notion of a hate crime is such a silly concept. <br>
Where is the positivity in any assault, rape, murder etc.<br>
Could you not argue that all trans-racial crime is a hate crime. Or is it only if you express your prejudice symbolically or verbally.<br>
Most of the incidents listed are tantamount to the old burning poop on the doorstep gag with either a name or pressing a historical racial button thrown in to antagonise.</p>
<p>&#8220;charged with ethnic intimidation and a misdemeanor&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;while hurling racial epithets&#8221;</p>
<p>&hellip;.Isn&rsquo;t that just name calling, and that is a crime? <br>
So is anti-white graffiti, the word &#8216;cracker&rsquo;(which I must admit I had to google for it&rsquo;s meaning, a while back), not being able to walk in various  neighbourhoods because of your skin colour a hate crime?<br>
Sounds silly.<br>
Charging people with hate crimes sounds like a Machiavelian way of collecting deceptive, biased statistical data to help paint the victim picture. <br>
Pretty nifty if you are the beneficiary.</p>
<p>As JustSaying at 6:57 PM pointed out regarding the comments on the original article, that sites moderator must be alot looser than here.<br>
It&rsquo;s refreshing to see that most other people think about this fantastical, anti-white profiling tool along similar lines.<br>

<p>I just followed this link and what it says about various ethnic groups only being in the &#8220;victim category&#8221; and &#8220;white Americans being the perpetrator category&#8221;, isn&rsquo;t silly it&rsquo;s downright scary. I assumed the ratios would be 70/30 or 80/20 etc. not 100/0. How is this legal? It&rsquo;s not fair to say the least(understatement of the year).</p>

		<p>This story and the NAACP &#8220;report&#8221; that we need more blacks on tv is enough to convince me that we are in big big trouble now. Flat-out lies are accepted as statistic, and public and private sectors actually make decisions with these lies as criteria.</p>
<p>I can clearly see how blacks take over. It seems very simple, which is confusing. I have been around enough whites to know they are discerning creatures, micro managers of detail. Especially the liberal types. Why do they swallow this nonsense, without a single.. &#8220;um, excuse me, but &hellip;&#8221;?</p>
<p>Our Fannie/Freddie mess is a direct result of a &#8220;report&#8221; that stated racism exists in our lending practices. That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s all. This report mobilized an entire political party to FORCE Fannie/Freddie to give loans to thousands of blacks that couldn&rsquo;t tie their shoe or read the large print if their lives depended on it.</p>

		<p>Obviously biased article on two counts&hellip;first of all, sounds like statistics are being slanted to make her case, and secondly, she almost consistently refers to blacks as &#8220;African Americans&#8221;, but not once does the author refer to whites as &#8220;European Americans&#8221;.  This above all else, shows her bias, and as a result, she loses all credibility.</p>

		<p>Could it just possibly be that Dison&rsquo;s TRUTH is a fabrication. That the majority of these claimed hate crimes were either non-existent or simple insults or incidents blown grossly out of proportion? As a White man, I find it hard to understand how the most trivial racial slight or slur gets categorized as a HATE CRIME</p>

		<p>Question to MS. DIXON: How do you turn a fairly innoccuous incident (displaying a noose, for example) into a HATE CRIME? What magical alchemy is required? Why is calling a Black the &#8220;n-word&#8221; a hate crime; yet Blacks calling Whites &#8220;honkies&#8221; fully acceptable? Why are Whites held to a higher standard, respective to mis-conduct than Blacks?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d urge someone to pose these questions to Dixon, but am certain-sure she&rsquo;d refuse to answer them TRUTHFULLY! Give it another year or two, and should a White woman REFUSE a Black&rsquo;s sexual advances, that too, will be classified &#8220;a hate crime.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d love to hear Dixon&rsquo;s excuses as to WHY when a Black rapes a White woman, it is NEVER, could never be considered a hate crime. Or WHY the horrific gang-rape, subsequent torture and mutilation of Shannon Christian and Christian Newsome, in Knoxville, TN in 2006 could not possibly have bene racially motivated.</p>

		<p>MARSHALL, Texas – A school janitor was fired after a picture of a black man hanging by a noose was found on a Christmas tree in a district building, a Marshall school board member said. </p>
<p>The picture was hanging from an ornament on a tree at the school district&rsquo;s maintenance building, said the school board member, identified in the Marshall News Messenger as &#8220;Mrs. Charles Wilson.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;These things happen,&#8221; Mrs. Wilson told the newspaper. &#8220;They call them pranks or whatever, but they&rsquo;re not really pranks. They really are hate crimes.&#8221; </p>
<p>Readers might find this interesting. Strongly supporting MY contention that a simple insult to Blacks is blown into a hate crime&hellip; while a Black (or Blacks) raping a White woman is &#8220;nothing newsworthy.&#8221;</p>

		<p>If whites are so racist and violent towards blacks, then why do so many of them leave black neighborhoods at the first opportunity and move into white areas along with putting their kids in white schools.  It&rsquo;s a fact that more blacks are murdered in one year by their own kind than all the blacks that were hung in this country&rsquo;s history.</p>

		<p>How long will it take for this nation to accept the fact that blacks will never feel at home in a white country?  Every time a black looks at a white it makes them feel ugly.  Every time a black tries to come up with a significant contribution blacks have made to science, technology, medicine or politics they come up empty handed.  </p>
<p>Blacks eternal feelings of inferiority will always fuel their endless hatred of whites and there can never be peace between the races.  The kindest thing we can do is ship them back to Africa where they can be among their own people.  After all, they complain incessantly about their ancestors forcibly being brought to this nation against their will.  Returning them to their ancestral homelands will right that ancient wrong&hellip;       <br>

		<p>This is a no brainier.  It makes me worry that people on this site don&rsquo;t do this.</p>
<p>In 2007 the FBI crime stats reports 9006 Hate crimes, 3802 (or 42%) of which were committed by whites and 1042 (or 11.6%) of which were committed by blacks.  Of those 1771 (or 19.7%) were white on black and 394 (4.3%) were back on white.  </p>
<p>Now compare this to the 2008 census bureau demographics of non-Hispanic whites (66%) and blacks (12%). </p>
<p>There are 5.5 x as many whites as blacks and we would expect an equal proportion of crime.  Do the math.  </p>
<p>Anyways, a few comments.</p>
<p>1) the difference is not that large.  If blacks and whites equally made up 50% of the population you would have 1362 white on black and 1641 black on white crimes.  You can calculate for statistical significance yourself.  </p>
<p>2)  It is interesting to note that 1,438 (or 38%) of white crimes were crimes of intimidation.  No comment.</p>
<p>3) I say it makes me worry because it took me 5 minutes to look up these stats and add them up;  yet in the above comments people are either posting outdated or irrelevant stats or trying to explain away the issue.  The data is out there.  (And if it isn&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s time to change our ideas) </p>
<p>4)  In general, a lot of contentions on this site would be easy to support or reject based on doable data analysis.  For those interested, if you believe what you are saying is true, but the time in and do the research.    </p>

<p>Labeling something a &#8216;hate crime&rsquo; is a bit arbitrary. Blacks are 100 times more likely to rob whites, than the other way around, 32 times more likely to assault whites, and around 20 times? more likely to murder whites&hellip; and yet they are only 2 1/2 times more likely to be charged with an officially designated hate crime.</p>
<p>I would think any examination of &#8216;injustice&rsquo; would have to begin right there.</p>
