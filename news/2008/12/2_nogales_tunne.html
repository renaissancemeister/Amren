<h1>2 Nogales Tunnels Found; Group of 17 Bolivians Halted</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stephen Ceasar, Arizona Daily Star (Tucson), December 16, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two tunnels were discovered in Nogales over the weekend by Nogales police officers, making a four-day total of three tunnels found in the border city.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers stopped 17 people from entering the United States using fraudulent Canadian citizenship cards at the Douglas port of entry.</p>
<p>Officers patrolling an area near downtown Nogales discovered a tunnel east of the Dennis DeConcini Port of Entry about 6 p.m. Friday, said Mario Escalante, U.S. Border Patrol Tucson Sector spokes-man. Its opening was about 8 feet north of the border fence and hidden by weeds and a piece of plywood, Escalante said.</p>
<p>Agents sent a remote-controlled robot into the tunnel and determined that it was about 10 feet long and originated about 2 feet south of the border.</p>
<p>The second tunnel was found by Nogales police working under Operation Stonegarden, a government-funded program to combat illegal immigration, said Escalante. {snip}</p>
<p>The excavation was inside the Grand Avenue drainageway, a 20-foot-wide tunnel built to divert floodwater but used by smugglers as an avenue into the United States.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There have been eight tunnels found in the Tucson Sector in the current fiscal year, which began in October. In fiscal year 2008, authorities found 14 tunnels.</p>
<p>From October 2002 through September 2008 a total of 34 tunnels were found, the agency says.</p>

		<p>Why wouldn&rsquo;t they be? Our jails are more comfortable than the homes they left and our Ignorant Welfare System is The Money Tree they dreamed of. They get more FREEBIES than the people who are here legally. There are too many FREEBIES period in the USA. The USA is broke, if your bank account looked like theirs you would be filing for bankruptcy. Of course all they have to do is Turn On the Printing Press and out rolls our depeciating money..</p>

		<p>Every border city should be mandated to drive concrete trucks around and every tunnel found be filled with cement. What is the matter with the people of this nation? Have we become what the old west cowboys called &#8220;lily-livered cowards?&#8221; The first thing to be done, if we had a President who was a true American, would be for him to go on world-wide TV and tell the offending countries who urge their people to break our laws that - &#8220;the US is no longer a dumping ground. You have thirty days to recall your people, or they have that much time to leave on their own. After that - the will be arrested and put to work building a fence that will be manned by US armed military. And, until they&rsquo;re gone, no more diplomatic relations, funding or any recognition.&#8221; Boy - I&rsquo;d like to be President for a day!</p>

		<p>Didn&rsquo;t Bolivia just elect a populist gringo-hating Hugo Chavez-clone?  Shouldn&rsquo;t this have instantly turned Bolivia into a paradise that nobody would ever want to leave?  I am shocked - simply shocked - that Bolivians are coming here!</p>
