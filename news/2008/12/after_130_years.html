			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paul Harris, Daily Mail (London), December 15, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For 130 years they have been part of Christmas, filling the air in towns across the land with music and carols.</p>
<p>But one thing is missing from the repertoire of Salvation Army bands this year &mdash; the percussion of rattling tins.</p>
<p>Members have been forbidden to shake their charity tins &mdash; even if it&rsquo;s done in time to the music &mdash; in case it harasses or intimidates people. One said she had been told it might also offend other religions.</p>
<p>Tin man: Salvation Army collectors have been told not to rattle their tins as it could be construed as religious harassment</p>
<p>Guidelines for branches organising public collections say tinholders should simply keep the tin still.</p>
<p>It means that when the brass bands start up they can rock and roll all they want &mdash; but if they shake and rattle, it could put them in conflict with the law.</p>
<p>Councils and police can enforce the no-rattle rule and have powers to prosecute or ban offenders. The restriction was branded &lsquo;bonkers&rsquo; yesterday both by donors and long-serving Salvation Army volunteers.</p>
<p>One collector told the Daily Mail: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been doing this for more than 40 years and I fail to see how rattling a tin could cause offence. If I was shaking a tambourine I could do it all day &mdash; if I shake my tin, I could end up in court.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Silent Night&rsquo; rattle ban manifested itself at the weekend in Uxbridge, West London, when musicians from two local branches performed outside a shopping mall.</p>
<p>(They were outside because traders complained last year they were too loud to play inside).</p>
<p>Tony Keywood, shopping with his wife Sheila, was among a crowd enjoying the carols and stepped forward to make a donation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I jokingly told them off for not shaking their tins,&rsquo; said Mr Keywood, 78, a retired telecoms executive. &lsquo;They said they weren&rsquo;t allowed to do that in case it caused offence to other religions. They said they&rsquo;d been told rattling a tin was considered to be intimidating.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know who makes up these rules but I suspect it will have something to do with human rights. I do feel Britain has lost its way on things like this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Laws on public collections are long-established, but until the recent proliferation of so-called &lsquo;charity muggers&rsquo; were not widely utilised.</p>
<p>Fundraisers have to be licensed, usually by the local authority, police or landowner. Councils and police can decide whom to license and how the rules are enforced.</p>
<p>The Salvation Army relies heavily on public generosity and believes street collections help to foster good relations.</p>
<p>Guidance now, however, is that members should not shake their tins. A Salvation Army source said: &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t have a formal policy of &#8220;You Shall Not Rattle&#8221; but we always act within the law.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some authorities specifically ask us not to shake our tins. It is seen as harassment, or making people feel uncomfortable. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s to do with other religions. But it can make people feel we&rsquo;re putting them under pressure to give.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A spokesman added: &lsquo;We want people to donate from the best of motives, so we advise collectors to avoid rattling their tins or asking people directly for money when stood on the high street.&rsquo;<br>

		<p>     One of our local foodstores banned the Salvation Army from its front doors last year. The people began a letter writing campaign and threatened a boycott. It worked. The Army is back at work here this year. I would rather give to the Army than the Red Cross. The Red Cross is too political and not very efficient at distributing aid.</p>

		<p>Another straw on the camels back, it&rsquo;s like watching someone shake a uncorked champagne bottle.<br>
Or watching the school yard bully back the mousey quiet kid into a corner, with his back against the wall.<br>
What will it take?<br>
&#8220;Lets change the Union Jack because it offends Muslims&#8221;.<br>
Something has got to give soon.<br>

		<p>I bet the people who spearheaded this ban have no idea how much the salvation army does to help their communities.  It is sad to hear this.</p>

		<p>As mentioned, &#8220;the recent proliferation of so-called &lsquo;charity muggers&rsquo;&#8221; has led to this enforcement. It seems the legislators need to better target offending parties rather make blanket laws that destroy popular tradition and undermine genuine charitable works. So far as offending other religions goes, it would be interesting to know how much Islamic mosques, madrassahs and the like wheedle out of public coffers in the western world. The bombs they throw around are more intimidating than rattled money boxes. </p>

		<p>I am astounded by this, and other recent similar, reports from the U.K. I find it unfathomable.Is it REALLY possible in the U.K. of today that the local Councils and local Police are allowed by the English, Welsh, and Scottish peoples to simply make up the laws they go along? <br>
This is not Marxism, something foreign to all the British peoples. It is something native: we have seen it before. It is the return of Cromwell and the Roundheads.  </p>

		<p>I wonder if they think that kind of talk will prevent those fanatics to stop preaching hate in their mosques against the UK and its whites, and make it more unlikely they will blow up more buses and kill more innocent civilians.</p>
<p>I wonder why they can&rsquo;t understand that appeasement only encourages more violence from these people.</p>

		<p>Does Islam really have a restriction against rattling tins? I mean, I know Islam has a lot of strange rules and regulations, but I never heard of rattling tins being one of them. Nowhere either does the article explain how rattling tins could be construed as &#8220;religious harassment.&#8221;  I wonder if this is not simply a case of miscommunication and a rule that will be rescinded next year. This seems a little ridiculous even for addle-brained Britain.</p>

		<p>Islam, Muslim-activists, and their money must be in people&rsquo;s beds all over the world, a new take on polygamy. </p>
<p>More and more senseless. No argument, defense, or rebuttal is good enough because it&rsquo;s an obvious choice for one over the other. Our words already mean nothing. Our laws are used against us. Who can be trusted?</p>

		<p>I am again astounded by the Brits&rsquo; apparently sudden onset of sensitivity to religious belief, when they have so proudly moved in an ever more secular direction as a society for decades. Indeed, nearly all of Europe seems afflicted with this same phenomenon, but no one rivals the UK. To my Anglo brothers and sisters, I don&rsquo;t envy your situation, and implore you to fight this madness tooth and claw!</p>

<p>Neither is the Salvation Army, go and take a look at one of their Colonels house in Charlotte, N.C. it is in fact a fairly corrupt organization too.</p>

		<p>No wonder real Britons are fleeing &#8216;Great&rsquo;Britain by the millions, each year.  Remember the Englishman (Tony Martin?)who was convicted of murder for shooting three men who had broken into his house in the middle of the night?  When he was denied parole because he had been judged &#8216;a threat to burglars&rsquo;, I thought things couldn&rsquo;t get any more crazy over there.  I was wrong.</p>

		<p>George Orwell was a prophet.  Everything his book 1984 said would happen to Britain (and the West generally) is happening.  The only thing he didn&rsquo;t predict was that the primary force behind totalitarianism would be the worship of multiculturalism.<br>

<p>I do notice how ridiculous the political correctness disease is spreading in England&hellip;  Well a while ago a woman was asked to remove her Christmas decoration.  The islam does not have restriction against Christmas trees, but she was asked to remove them simply because anything Christian is deemed inappropriate in England nowadays?  Because anything Christian can possibly &#8220;offend&#8221; muslim immigrants? </p>

		<p>Human Rights = rights for all except White People (and here I am thinking we&rsquo;re human, too)</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if the Muslims are offended.  I find their carryings on offensive, too, but then I&rsquo;m a white male in the USA, so my feelings don&rsquo;t count.</p>
<p>William Booth&rsquo;s homeland has turned on the organization he founded so many years ago.  The Salvation Army&rsquo;s collectors should rattle the tins all the more loudly - call it &#8220;civil disobedience.&#8221; </p>
