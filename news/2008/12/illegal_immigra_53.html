<h1>Illegal Immigrants Going Home, and Local Labor Market at Risk</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alfonso Chardy, Miami Herald, November 30, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Malaquías] Gaspar is among millions of undocumented immigrants facing new challenges brought on by slim prospects for legalization, more aggressive federal enforcement and a worsening economy. Now, fewer immigrants are caught while trekking through the dangerous Sonoran Desert or risking their lives aboard makeshift boats in the Caribbean, indicating that fewer are trying. Those who make it through can find themselves on one of several daily federal charter flights that return deportees.</p>
<p>The ripple effects are already being felt. Communities in Latin America and the Caribbean report a reduction in remittances &mdash; money sent home from the United States. That money is critical to the survival of families and the success of local civic projects. Border communities that once thrived as way stations for those heading north are now little more than ghost towns.</p>
<p>SMUGGLING RECEDES</p>
<p>Even on the tiny Bahamian island of Bimini, long a hotbed of eager smugglers willing to transport human cargo to South Florida, the mood is grim.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Illegal immigrants not leaving the country are traveling to any city, town or region where jobs might be more plentiful. Businesses that depend on foreign labor are already seeing an impact.</p>
<p>PRESSURE ON FARMERS</p>
<p>John Alger, of Alger Farms in Homestead, said South Miami-Dade farmers are not hiring as many migrant workers because the economy is forcing them to reduce the size of the fields they plant.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last year, at the height of the immigration reform debate, Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez warned that without enough foreign workers, landscaping, farms and healthcare companies would suffer.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will see rotting fruit,&#8221; Gutierrez said in June 2007. &#8220;We will see lawns that don&rsquo;t get cared for. We will see patients who don&rsquo;t get cared for.&#8221;</p>
<p>IMMIGRANTS&rsquo; STORIES</p>
<p>From Homestead to Fort Lauderdale to West Palm Beach, the stories of undocumented immigrants confirm the findings of immigration experts that an increasing number of illegal workers are leaving and a decreasing number are arriving.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So was Lázaro Rodríguez, of the Mexican border town of Matamoros, across from Brownsville, Texas.</p>
<p>&#8220;I used to send about $500 every two weeks home when work was good, but now I send $50 here or $100 there,&#8221; said Rodríguez, 46, who stands at a laborer pickup site in West Miami-Dade, on Bird Road near Florida&rsquo;s Turnpike.</p>
<p>LIMITED INCOME</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jobs started to vanish six months ago.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>INCOME DOUBLED</p>
<p>Life was hard at first. But problems in adapting to South Florida were outweighed by an increase in family income.</p>
<p>&#8220;Back then, there was a lot of work,&#8221; Gaspar recalled. &#8220;When I was by myself, I earned about $300 per week, and when my wife arrived, we doubled our income.&#8221;</p>
<p>Residential developments, part of a hot real-estate market, began to swallow farmland.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first to disappear were the lemons,&#8221; Gaspar said. &#8220;Then other vegetables vanished. Now, we barely make $150, or less than $300 a week between the two of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>By October, Gaspar was back in Zimatlán de Alvarez, taking care of his mother &mdash; and scouting the local job market in case the situation in the United States does not improve.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we can no longer make ends meet, we&rsquo;ll come back,&#8221; Gaspar said. &#8220;The idea would be to have a plot of land and plant corn, beans or flowers to sell, while my children, who speak English well, work in the tourist hotels.&#8221;<br>

<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve seen with our own eyes that thos jobs haven&rsquo;t suffered a shortage of workers does that mean Carlos the secretary is going to announce a retraction of his absurd statement?</p>
<p>In fact, people can&rsquo;t find work in any of those fields, and how about the fact that even more jobs are going to go?  How many illegal aliens will we need to fill positions that don&rsquo;t exist?</p>
<p>Will another 15 million be enough?</p>
<p>Incidentally, Carlos, have you ever addressed the problem of why Mexicans are leaving their family and homes?  I mean, if whites inhabited Mexico we would have an abundance of jobs available and the country would be extremely prosperous.</p>

		<p>Gee, what a heart-wrencher of a tale. Let the damned illegals stay home where they belong! Americans are plain fed up with the high maintenance cost   &mdash;   welfare, food stamps, health care and educational benefits collected by the illegals and their families. Yeah, illegals can&rsquo;t get welfare. Just like they can&rsquo;t get jobs. But which they do, using the fraudulent documents for both purposes. Besides, should Mammasita wander to the local welfare office, her well-reheared tale of woe how Juan Valdez ran off with Juanita Lopez&hellip; leaving Mammasita stuck with six kids and an empty cupboard&hellip; you know damned well she&rsquo;ll get the hand-outs, courtesy of the American taxpayers.</p>
<p>I keep hearing how hard the illegal Mexicans work. I also see ample evidence how hard they also work at petty thefts, shoplifting, car break-ins and burglaries. Yet the Mexicans can&rsquo;t understand WHY we feel as we do about them.</p>

<p>If we don&rsquo;t allow illegals, we&rsquo;re all going to starve to death or something dire like that. So says the Miami Herald. This is how the MSM plants one-sided ideas in the publics minds. The solution might be to TRY to hire others to replace them maybe at a higher rate (which would be passed on). But really, does anyone believe the food production in the US will come to an end without illegal labor?</p>
<p>However, if true, this just shows that in the race to the bottom, you eventually get there. What happens when you hire the next wave of illegals at lower wages and the next wave at still lower wages. And on and on. This is where the reality of the global economy is going to implode. At some point, you reach the lowest level of wages possible and nobody can afford to buy anything. The modern economic system reaches it&rsquo;s inevitable dead end.<br>

		<p>What difference does it make?  They&rsquo;ll be replaced by Obama&rsquo;s African immigrants which will start piling in here right after Obama takes office if not sooner. </p>

		<p>Is there anyone in DC with any sense? Plan ahead, people. Most of us are against illegal immigration, so the answer is to send them home. This, of course, will be against the President-Elect&rsquo;s policy. I heard him say in a speech, &#8220;it wouldn&rsquo;t be fair.&#8221; Fair to whom, Mr. Obama? If you really want change, how about sending teams to the countries who urge their people to break our laws? The teams, made up of experts in all fields who would lay out plans for these countries to help themselves. Instead, they give up and depend on us to take their people. We cannot sustain the millions who flow into this country day by day. Make this contingent on them recalling their people or losing funding, aid, trade - anything until they cooperate. Then, lay out plans to improve their economy. Have the teams oversee the operation until the countries can stand on their own two feet, then leave. If their people still continue to come, let it be known they will be jailed. Let the build the fence, then put them on the other side! Stop all funds until they comply. It&rsquo;s not our job to support other coutries, especially in the financial shape we&rsquo;re in now. And&hellip;this might be a learning tool for the leaders of this country. Obama has a website that has a space to offer comments. Write him and tell him this country would probably be in the black without illegal aliens an all the people that are taken in for various reasons.</p>

<p>Seeing as how agriculture has been one of our strongest industries since the founding of our nation, and how allowing in hordes of third worlders is relatively new to us, I&rsquo;m going to say this is false.  It&rsquo;s hilarious how brainwashed people are in that they actually believe the farming industry will go belly up if it was actually forced to hire white workers and pay them fair wages.</p>
<p>Also, people tend to forget that our working class has shrunk simply because you don&rsquo;t need 500 laborers to pick a field when 5 of them can do it with tractors.  Mechanization is why we don&rsquo;t have much &#8220;cheap labor&#8221; anymore.</p>

		<p>Well it just breaks my heart that some of these illegals are not sending as much money back as they used to. John Alger, and every one else in this country who hire illegal immigrants should be arrested for aiding and abetting these people who broke the law,and should be ashamed of themselves for selling out their country for the almighty buck.</p>

		<p>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Florida&rsquo;s unemployment rate was 7.0% in October   &mdash;   above the national average.  That&rsquo;s 654,993 people looking for work (more or less!!)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m stunned that the globalists still are trying to play the sympathy card for ilegals when so many Americans are out of work.  </p>
<p>But, then again, I&rsquo;m stunned that the Supreme Court of the United States is considering taking on the Berg case, and the mainstream media is giving what could be the biggest political story of the century absolutely zero coverage!  I mean, a teenager goes mssing in Aruba and we hear about it for years! </p>

		<p>The local labor market is not a risk. What a bunch of baloney. What this really means is that the local labor market may actually have to hire Americans at a fair wage.</p>
