<h1>What&rsquo;s Worse for Wal-Mart: Lawsuit or Jesse?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bob Parks, Black &amp; Right, December 4, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Family members of the fatally trampled Wal-Mart worker are suing the corporation for not protecting their employees from potential harm from their own customers. Is a lawsuit preferable?</p>
<p>The family of a worker trampled to death in a &#8220;Black Friday&#8221; crush of bargain hunters at a Long Island Wal-Mart store filed a wrongful-death lawsuit on Wednesday, claiming store ads offering deep discounts &#8220;created an atmosphere of competition and anxiety&#8221; that led to &#8220;crowd craze.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lawsuit claims that besides failing to provide adequate security for a pre-dawn crowd estimated at 2,000, Wal-Mart &#8220;engaged in specific marketing and advertising techniques to specifically attract a large crowd and create an environment of frenzy and mayhem and was otherwise careless, reckless and negligent.&#8221;</p>
<p>In monitoring the coverage of this tragic event, there has been yet another aspect ignored by the PC-handcuffed mainstream media&hellip;&nbsp;.</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m going to be accused by the black blogs of being a &#8220;self-hating Negro&#8221; for saying this but the pictures speak for themselves.</p>
<p>The basis of this lawsuit is that Wal-Mart didn&rsquo;t properly prepare for the bumrush they should have anticipated.</p>
<p>Nassau County Police Commissioner Lawrence Mulvey said it was apparent to him that the Wal-Mart store about 20 miles east of Manhattan lacked adequate security to handle the crowds. He said police representatives met with retailers throughout the county two weeks before Thanksgiving and made it clear that security and crowd control for the sales was the merchants&rsquo; responsibility.</p>
<p>There are Wal-Marts all over the country. There were Wal-Marts that offered the same discounts and had the same crowd issues. Out of all of those Wal-Marts nationally, how many had the doors pushed off the hinges by their customers, trampling employees and customers alike?</p>
<p>This was obviously an unfortunate anomaly.</p>
<p>BUT if Wal-Mart turned their parking lot into a police state that Thursday night/Friday morning, just what do you think people like Jesse Jackson would be saying? The majority of the people in the pictures rushing the Wal-Mart doors were black. A pre-assumption they would behave unruly would have been seized on by civil rights ambulance chasers as racism.</p>
<p>If you think that&rsquo;s off the mark, watch what happens the next time there is a similar sale opportunity in the future. Wal-Mart may opt to increase security nationally, but watch what happens should that happen in certain neighborhoods, and listen to who does the most bitching.</p>
<p>If Wal-Mart has the choice of paying a grieving family or a Jesse Jackson money/adverse publicity shakedown, just what direction do you think a Wal-Mart would take?</p>

		<p>Although too lazy to research it, I&rsquo;m almost certain this stampede thing has happened before at mostly-white stores.  Really low prices can make any people crazy, even us pales ones. The store is to blame for not controlling the crowd.  They could pass out tokens, &amp; let in only a certain number at a time.  People would go along with that, as long as they knew about it in advance.  </p>
<p>As a short person, I have a special horror of any crowd, regardless of its color. </p>

		<p>If they have the trial in the Bronx it will be a slam dunk win for the plaintiff. </p>
<p>While we&rsquo;re on the topic of absurd racial realities and how with blacks its damned if you do damned if you don&rsquo;t here is a link to a story I just stumbled upon on the nightly news:<br>
https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081205/ap_on_re_us/slave_lesson</p>
<p>If you just glanced at this story you would believe that white supremacy is alive and well in the northern suburbs of New York. However the principal appeared and she was a young (sort of militant looking) black female. This was an example of multicuralism gone wild. The class &#8220;lesson&#8221; was to instill guilt in white students and rage in black students. It is sick and getting sicker everyday. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s always the same thing with these cognitively challenged : Always blame your bad behavior on someone or something else.  Never take responsibility for anything you do.  I was once talking to a Black guy about his recent car wreck (he missed a curve and rolled his car).  He said, &#8220;That d*** road curves!&#8221;  And sure enough, as I looked at the road, I could see a definite curve.  According to his thinking, it was the curve that caused him to roll, not the fact that he was going too fast or not paying attention or was a poor driver.  In his mind, it was the road&rsquo;s fault, and probably also the fault of the White guys who had designed the road.  </p>
<p>This is why it is impossible to maintain a civilization whenever there are more than 20% Africans.  Such illogical thinking and bad behaviors are like a disease that destroys all positive aspects of society.</p>

		<p>I know it is a rhetorical question, but as far as economics goes, better to take a chance with the wrongful death lawsuit then get hit by a class action lawsuit by angry black shoppers wrongfully denied the fundamental constitutional  right to purchase discounted bling&hellip; </p>
<p>&#8220;Civil rights&#8221; laws generally have a mechanism in which the attorneys can get astronomical  legal fees, which often vastly dwarves the actual judgment for the Plaintiffs. A big class action law suit plus having to pay both plaintiff and defedndant&rsquo;s legal fees is probably gonna cost you more at the end of the day.  <br>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t have said it better myself.  Like I have said before in this space, nobody knows blacks better than other blacks.  Given the chance, blacks in power will wind up implementing much the same system against other blacks that they implored whites to get rid of.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s not an &#8220;unfortunate anomaly.&#8221;  It&rsquo;s a racial difference.</p>
<p>As an aside, I have never participated in early morning Black Fridays.  I don&rsquo;t want to perpetuate a system that forces store employees to get to work at 3 AM.  Plus, you can find just as good or better bargains in early-mid December.</p>

<p>If Wal-Mart is smart, they&rsquo;ll pause and reflect about the &#8220;future&#8221; and close some hood stores up like this one.  It&rsquo;s hard for me to believe that this store ever came close to meeting corporate standards of anything even approaching profitabilty to begin with.   </p>

		<p>Interesting and surprisingly honest coming from a black. In a way you could argue the Je$$e Jackson &#8220;civil rights&#8221; crowd is inadvertently responsible for the worker&rsquo;s death. They have created a climate that made it impossible for companies like Wal-Mart to take effective measure for fear of being called &#8220;anti-black&#8221;. Because of this, a black died.</p>

		<p>How is it that after Katrina that Wal-Mart doesn&rsquo;t know what to expect from a &#8216;black community&rsquo;?  It took the army down there to keep things in order, what did they expect would be the case here?  After 40 years of civil riiiii  &mdash;  ots, haven&rsquo;t we learned anything?

Posted by SeenItHappen at 6:10 PM on December 5</p>
<p>Well, I ran two search engine checks and, although there are white mobs inundating a store for sales when the doors swing open, I didn&rsquo;t find a single incident where anyone was trampled, nor did I find any situation where the mobs went wild and tore the dooirs off their hinges.  There have been stadium incidents where mobs have fled from fires, bulls, animals, and other dangers and somebody was killed, but nothing like this in what would be considered a serene setting.</p>
<p>In this case, as in many things, it&rsquo;s a matter of degree, and trying to give parity to a group for black gross misbehavior is always inaccurate every time it is attempted.  Keep in mind that there are literally thousands of incidents revealing a lack of impulse control in blacks.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a short person, I have a special horror of any crowd, regardless of its color.&#8221;</p>
<p>What you have is called a phobia, an unreasonable fear of large groups of people.  Every group isn&rsquo;t a stampeding mob, but even if they were a large man is no more a match for dozens of people pushing their way into and across him. </p>

		<p><i>Roughly 2,000 people gathered outside the Wal-Mart&rsquo;s doors in the predawn darkness. Chanting &#8220;push the doors in,&#8221; the crowd pressed against the glass as the clock ticked down to the 5 a.m. opening. </i></p>
<p><b>Sensing catastrophe, nervous employees formed a human chain inside the entrance to slow down the mass of shoppers. </b></p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t work. The mob barreled in and overwhelmed workers.<br>
The Black Friday stampede plunged the Valley Stream outlet into chaos, knocking several employees to the ground and sending others scurrying atop vending machines to avoid the horde. </p>
<p>What strikes me as amazing is that NONE of the employees involved in this had the sense to tell their fellow workers &ldquo;MOVE! This is dangerous! We need to get out of the way!&rdquo;. </p>
<p>I know many places like Walmart often employ individuals with low iq&rsquo;s, but how is that not ONE of them was smart enough to realize &ldquo;forming a human chain&rdquo; to block the rampaging mob already committing criminal acts (by breaking down the doors) was dangerous? <br>

		<p>I remember crazed crowds at stores when the &#8220;Cabbage Patch Kids&#8221; toys were new, back in the 1980s.  There weren&rsquo;t any fatalities.  Moreover, Wal Mart is able to offer the same discounts at their stores near white suburbs without mob violence.</p>
<p>On &#8220;Black Friday&#8221; we went to a movie.  The theater was almost empty.  The only shopping we did all weekend was at Costco, where we got groceries and I bought a pair of &#8220;Field &amp; Stream&#8221; shirts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been out of the house only four times this week; on three of those occasions it was to go take the finals in my welding classes.  I dislike crowds and long lines enough that I try to avoid as much of the Christmas shopping season as possible.</p>

		<p>This wasn&rsquo;t brought up but I asked myself, how many of the stampeders were on drugs??? If a lot of them were, it made things all the worse.  I noticed too, all the patrons of said walmart, were black as night&hellip;.wonder if that had anything to do with it????  After all, you have to get out of their way, as they are special people!! Just as one poster, mentioned Oprah trying to bardge her way into a closed store, after all she is a queen, but I am not sure queen of what??? Just cause she has billions, well, maybe that&rsquo;s it??? Don&rsquo;t know, cause I struggle to make ends meet, and I am white. <br>

		<p>This is very much like the double bind banks were put it.  Under the Clinton administration they were threatened with law suits and even criminal penalties if they didn&rsquo;t make enough mortgages with black people.  Now they&rsquo;re being accused of racism for having snookered too many black people into taking out loans they couldn&rsquo;t afford.  Obama tells us it&rsquo;s the banks that are at fault for the mortgage crisis, because they told people they could afford the loans they were getting.  Apparently he sees Americans as children who can&rsquo;t be expected to ask what the worst case payments are and then figure out for themselves if they can afford them.  It&rsquo;s not that I hold the banks blameless, but the people who took out the loans are equally to blame and the politicians who twisted the arms of banks to make bad loans, like Barney Frank and Obama, are in no position to prescribe a cure.<br>

		<p>&#8220;This is why it is impossible to maintain a civilization whenever there are more than 20% Africans.&#8221; In our classrooms the figure is 12-15%.</p>
<p>I studied the effects of forced busing from 1972-1978 while a student at UCLA. When black students were introduced to a school that had been nearly all white the dynamic completely changed. Up to 10% black and the new black students would largely try to fit into the academic routine. Many had trouble catching up with the white students. But most blacks tried. When the percentage of blacks reached a critical tipping point, 12-15% black students, everything changed for the white students. There are now enough black students that they are able to form cliques, mini-gangs, and they set the program for everyone else. The blacks decide where they will sit on campus and what part of the lunchroom will forever more be little Nairobi. White students are terrorized at will if the school administrators are weak. </p>

		<p>You can&rsquo;t win with blacks. Bob Parks is right: had enough security been in place to prevent this sort of thing black shakedown &#8220;leaders&#8221; would have emerged screaming about how it sent the insulting racist message that such a mini police state is necessary to keep blacks from acting like a dangerous rampant mob just for a sale. Wal-Mart would have been sued for the &#8220;racist&#8221; insult. </p>
<p>Had Wal-Mart forgone such a sell (for safety reasons) they would have been sued for discrimination and the racist insult of not having a sale for local blacks. </p>

		<p>What is being overlooked in this tragi-comedy is that the power of advertising is back! Imagine! A simple newspaper ad can create &#8220;an environment of frenzy and mayhem.&#8221; Hell, we haven&rsquo;t seen such effective advertising since the &#8220;Chicago School&#8221; of advertising created those Volkswagon and Hathaway shirt ads. What recession? What depression? Crank up those ad agencies and let loose the admen and let&rsquo;s start pulling dollars out of the pockets of those cowering nabobs in our society who are cutting back on spending.   </p>

		<p>As one poster put it, even Whites have been known to act crazy in mobs. But with Blacks, it is not just &#8220;probably&#8221;, it&rsquo;s a guaranteed certainty. One Black by himself might be fine; get three or more together, the pack mentality kicks in and they go wild.</p>
<p>Can anyone recall that infamous New York city Blackout back in the 1980s (1970s?)? When a power failure was an excuse for large-scale looting, theft, and rioting by Blacks in the Big Apple. It only take the slightest incident to get Blacks looting for all they&rsquo;re worth. Of which we&rsquo;ve had numerous examples to substantiate my claim.</p>

Lose-lose. No win. Damned if you do, damned if you don&rsquo;t. They get you coming and going&hellip;</p>
<p>I repeatedly make the point that it&rsquo;s pointless trying to help blacks. Try to prevent this with a visible security force and you&rsquo;re racists. Minimise security presence and let the black mob be a black mob and you&rsquo;re racist. Let blacks run the security force and you&rsquo;re blamed for not adequate training.</p>
<p>Your best defense is to avoid blacks as much as possible. If you can&rsquo;t avoid them, be polite but not outgoing. I look at every black as a ticking bomb and I keep my distance. No interaction, no confrontation.</p>

		<p>If this is what blacks do with a sale, imagine what they will do when bread and water are scarce.  I think Amreners know what to expect and how to respond.<br>

		<p>&#8220;When the percentage of blacks reached a critical tipping point, 12-15% black students, everything changed for the white students. There are now enough black students that they are able to form cliques, mini-gangs, and they set the program for everyone else. The blacks decide where they will sit on campus and what part of the lunchroom will forever more be little Nairobi. White students are terrorized at will if the school administrators are weak.&#8221;</p>
<p>I observed this during the 1970&rsquo;s when the civil service system was replaced by the racial spoils system for my government employeer.  8 to 10 percent black is managable, although it is those 8 to 10 percent who cause almost all the trouble.  </p>
<p>At about 12 percent the dynamic changes.  It is mostly because administrators are so intimadated by threats of discrimination lawsuits if they try to enforce rules of punctuality, work lunch times (1 hour, not 3 hour lunches) and minimal productivity for the black employees.</p>
<p>Every mention that work starts at 8:30 am, not 9:15 am runs the risk of a lawsuit.  Asking blacks to actually get off their personal phone calls and turn off the mini TVs they bring to work runs the risk of a lawsuit.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that 10 percent is the tipping point.  Some amreners who have been in the military have posted that no more than 10 percent black is the military rule.  The military has found out over the last horrible 60 years that more than 10 percent blacks destroys a unit.  So the military takes great care to prevent this.</p>
<p>I would never join the navy.  I would do everything in my power to prevent my children from joining the navy.  Imagine being on a ship at sea with a thousand or more blacks.  They could do anything to white shipmates.  And they do.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s some catch, that catch 22.</p>
<p>There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one&rsquo;s own safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. If  Orr was crazy he could be grounded.  All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions.  Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn&rsquo;t, but if he was sane he had to fly them.  If he flew them he was crazy and didn&rsquo;t have to; but if he didn&rsquo;t want to he was sane and had to.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Although too lazy to research it, I&rsquo;m almost certain this stampede thing has happened before at mostly-white stores.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not &#8220;Lazy&#8221; and NO, it has NOT happened in any store where the majority shoppers were White. Nice try. The Leftist blogs are on another site. Did you get lost and wander into this one on your way there? </p>

		<p>&#8220;Never take responsibility for anything you do&#8221;</p>
<p>May I remind you that these folks were brought here against their will?  And, if it&rsquo;s genetic, how can they be responsible?  They can think like Whites by an act of will, or an act on congress?</p>

		<p>Wal Mart probably won&rsquo;t have to pay if they fight the case out.  The guy who was trampled to death was on the clock, and therefore Worker&rsquo;s Comp picks up the bill, which means everyone who pays into Worker&rsquo;s Comp pays the bill.</p>
<p>If there were no &#8220;Black Friday&#8221; post-Thanksgiving sales in black areas, the Usual Suspects would shriek &#8220;racism&#8221;.  If extra security was hired to control incoherent &#8220;shoppers&#8221;, the Usual Suspects would shriek &#8220;racism&#8221;.  If some guy just trying to make a living gets trampled to death by a greed-grazed mob, the Usual Suspects shriek &#8220;racism&#8221;.  When chain stores pull out of black neighborhoods because of the extra costs and trouble associated with doing business there, the Usual Suspects shriek &#8220;racism&#8221;.</p>
<p>Has anyone noticed a trend here?</p>
