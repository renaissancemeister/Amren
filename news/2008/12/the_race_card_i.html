			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Toby Harnden, Telegraph (London), December 30, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Taking to the podium at the end of a bizarre, shambolic press conference in which Governor Rod Blagojevich sought to appoint Roland Burris to the US Senate, Congressman Bobby Rush dared white Democratic senators to block a black man from joining their ranks.</p>
<p>He urged people &#8220;not to hang or lynch the appointee as you try to castigate the appointer&#8221; and, after saying repeatedly that Burris would be the only African-American in the Senate, said that he believed no senator would want &#8220;to go on record to deny one African-American from being seated in the US Senate&#8221;.</p>
<p>Rush is a former Black Panther who trounced Barack Obama in the 2000 Democratic primary when the then state senator challenged him for his House of Representatives seat.</p>
<p>The grinning Burris was told by Blagojevich &mdash; who policed the press conference &mdash; that &#8220;you&rsquo;re the senator&#8221;. He appeared clueless about the money he&rsquo;d donated to the governor, which will only add to the taint of the appointment.</p>
<p>As he left the room, Blagojevich echoed Rush, saying: &#8220;Feel free to castigate the appointer but don&rsquo;t lynch the appointee.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harry Reid, the Senate Majority Leader, has already said that Burris &#8220;cannot be an effective representatives of the people of Illinois&#8221; and &#8220;will not be seated by the Democratic caucus&#8221;. But the blatant injection of race into the equation will make life very uncomfortable indeed for Obama and his party.<br>

		<p>This is the lynch pin in the philosophy of multiculturalism. One group holding another hostage to charges of &#8220;racism&#8221;. Multiculturalism, cannot, in any way, be good for ANY nation, but only cause endless, unremitting social strife.</p>

		<p>Poetic justice indeed! I&rsquo;ve been laughing since the very momentI saw Blagojevich introduce Burris at the press conference. What a phenomenal joke on the whole lot of them! </p>
<p>Burris was an underdog in Blagojevich&rsquo;s eyes until the wily governor realized he could tie the whole process up in a hilarious racial comedy by putting forward a black appointee. How does the DNC bow to the &#8220;glories&#8221; of afro-centrism and &#8220;diversity,&#8221; yet crush Blagojevich at the same time? </p>
<p>Unfortunately, as happy as I am to see everyone fumbling around for a way to brush aside the appointing of a black man to the Senate, it pains me to realize that the public discourse finds no problem discussing Burris solely on the grounds of skin color - i.e. the Senate &#8220;needs&#8221; a black man, as opposed to the best man.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that what &#8220;Reverend&#8221; King was &#8220;dreaming&#8221; about? Doesn&rsquo;t the Civil &#8220;Rights&#8221; act of 1964 forbid us to take account of race?</p>

		<p>(1)  I think it&rsquo;s brilliant strategery on Blago&rsquo;s part.  One of two things will happen:  The most likely thing that will happen is that, while there will be talk of the Senate not seating him, they&rsquo;ll easily back down when the NAACP starts screaming racism.  For most sitting U.S. Senators of both parties, there is no greater fear than being called a racist, worse than death.  At that time, Blago will have had his way.  If the Senate indeed does not seat him, then Blago and Co. will push the issue in the Federal courts, and eventually we will have a precedent that will probably solidify Governors&rsquo; near-absolute rights to fill vacant U.S. Senate seats, in which case Blago will win.  Blago can&rsquo;t lose either way.</p>
<p>(2)  Some Republicans are licking their chops because they think a Blago-appointed replacement (or any replacement) will be vulnerable when the seat is up for election in 2010.  I&rsquo;ve had political friends tell me that they hope Blago appoints the most radical black possible, to ensure a Republican win in two years.  My answer is this:  Don&rsquo;t count your chickens before they hatch, this is Illinois we&rsquo;re talking about here.  If not for the fact that Illinois is a solidly blue state, the Illinois Republican Party makes matters worse  &mdash;  if you are like the late great Dr. Samuel T. Francis, and call the Republican Party in general &ldquo;The Stupid Party,&rdquo; then the Illinois Republican Party qualifies as the Retarded Party.  (Alan Keyes, anyone?)  For a liberal PC Republican, especially of the DuPage County Plutocrats&rsquo; Club, there is no greater fear in life than being called a racist, worse than death.  Look for Mr. Burris to be unopposed for all intents and purposes in 2010, and 2016, and for as long as he wants to be in the Senate.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Harry Reid, the Senate Majority Leader, has already said that Burris &#8216;cannot be an effective representatives of the people of Illinois&rsquo; and &#8216;will not be seated by the Democratic caucus&rsquo;. But the blatant injection of race into the equation will make life very uncomfortable indeed for Obama and his party.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oddly, I found that to be one of the saddest and sickest comments on these multicultural times, that I have ever read. What have we come to, when even a yet to be seated mulatto General Secretary and his party must worry about the absurdly racially charged rantings of: a discredited governor, a former Black Panther, and the &#8220;appointed&#8221; black political hack they back for the US Senate? </p>
<p>This is what I mean about Comrade General Secretary Obama being hamstrung, before he even gets into the White House; the Red: criminals, cowards, and maniacs took over that party a long time ago, and they have metastasized considerably over the years. This arrogance on the part of the Chicago Gang of Three, only confirms this; they have become so used to using charges of &#8220;racism&#8221; effectively against their opposition for so long, that now they have begun to use it on themselves. </p>
<p>How utterly and abjectly laughable!</p>
<p>Logically, this could be dealt with; however, logic has long been absent with the Democrats. Only overemotional sophistry and vitriol are their current vernacular. </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

<p>Blacks as a group cannot get ahead on their own merit.  The intelligence and ability just isn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>But they have no real pride or shame, because it bothers them not one iota that they&rsquo;re given jobs and are accepted to colleges on the basis of affirmative action to keep them from rioting.  </p>
<p>Now, this black congressman is giving out the same kind of warning they use to get other AA gimmes. &#8220;Give a black the job, or else.&#8221;  Too, his statements reveal his third world mentality, because he&rsquo;s placing race above the need to avoid making a blatant farce of the law by a governor who is about as corrupt as they get, black or white.</p>
<p>True, few will regard the congressional body in total as anything but incompetent and corrupt if this man isn&rsquo;t seated, but we reach a new low when a blatant disregard for the law is given little or no consideration at all.  </p>
<p>I know this black&rsquo;s intent is to try to squeeze a fellow black in another high profile position he couldn&rsquo;t earn himself, and like all things AA they are awarded he shows no shame for it.<br>
But, at the same time, I seriously doubt that he even  understands what a shadow this places over the entire Congress to have to accept the appointment of someone by a corrupt governor who is simply utilizing a ploy to try to divert attention from himself by creating a crisis.</p>
<p>We have reached a new societal low with this incident.  The FBI and prosecutor could have avoided the situation by allowing cash to change hands before making an arrest.  Saying they were trying to stop a crime wave is the same as saying they were certain a large number of politicians would be indicted, which means, of course, that by not waiting they have left a sizeable number of corrupt politicos in position to conduct business as usual.</p>

		<p>This reminds me of the scene in Blazing Saddles where the sheriff threatens to shoot himself to ward off the mob.  Perhaps Bush should have tried this when he got into office.  He could have told all the liberals that everytime he was criticised that they were lynching a white man.  Come to think of it, it probably would have made things worse.    </p>

		<p>       I love Blago. He has done what we need to learn to do:<br>
put the liberals and multiculturalists on the hot seat by using<br>
their idiocy against them. That he uses his cunning for merely<br>
personal gain is obvious, but that must not deter us. We must<br>
develop the same cunning ruthlessness and use it for our Race.<br>
Blagovitch is greedy for money-we must just as greedy for the<br>
survival of our People.</p>

<p>Timing is everything. </p>
<p>Blagojevich arrest - Completed at half-time: right after Obama is elected but before he takes office. </p>
<p>Rev. Wright reporting - Completed at half-time: right after Obama cinched the primaries but well before the national election. </p>
<p>Mormon raids - Completed when it looked like Mitt Romney was gaining ground.</p>

		<p>I think that Blago is appointing a black because he will end up in front of a jury, and it will in all probability be a mostly BLACK jury. What black jury would convict him after appointing a black back into the senate and sticking it to whitey?</p>

		<p>Since we are under emergency continuity of government rules, the house and senate are only ceremonial positions anyway.  They do not make any laws of significance. </p>
<p>Why make such a big deal out of it?  </p>

		<p>To Ranger:</p>
<p>Excellent point about how the Senate would look were it to accept the appointee of a shamed political hustler. I hadn&rsquo;t considered that, and it would indeed be a disgrace. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t put much weight behind the &#8220;character&#8221; of any Congressman, but Burris&rsquo;s appointment would indeed make it very difficult to continue pretending they have even a shred of honor to their names.</p>
<p>As for moving on Blagojevich before money changed hands, I offer this: doing so was a way for the FBI to pursue the case without getting too close to the biggest of players. </p>
<p>I believe the FBI knew, and federal prosecutors agreed, that had they let events run a longer course they&rsquo;d have come uncomfortably close to catching Barry Obama in the same snare. How then would the Messiah ascend to his throne on Inauguration Day? </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my opinion that a number of paths discovered during the investigation lead in some way or another straight to Barry Obama, and to avoid dealing with that they simply moved early before any truly damning, and therefore impossible-to-hide, evidence was found. </p>

		<p>Self-respect is no longer taught in government schools.  For the last decade or so government schools have taught bottom feeders to embrace &#8220;self-esteem&#8221; at the expense of &#8220;self-respect&#8221;.  Self-respect is the child of self-discipline and self-discipline is born of personal effort.  Hence we have millions of blacks and Hispanics who believe they are &#8220;special&#8221; when in fact nothing could be further from the truth&hellip;</p>

<p>All good points.  I agree 100%.  </p>
<p>Too, I might add that the prosecutor and investigators were fearful they might have a case that involved such a high number of officials the courts would be clogged, and the electorate&rsquo;s loss of confidence for those in power could possibly have created a crisis of legitimacy.</p>
<p>As it stands, Illinois has a large criminal segment of its political faction still doing business as usual.</p>
<p>This was an excellent opportunity to clean house, and reveal this new president for what he really is.</p>

		<p>I think like some of you others, that Blogo was arrested when he was in order to shut things down before Obama got his hands dirty.  What a mess that would have been.  It would have been something like finding out Obama isn&rsquo;t technically a citizen. Unseating the Messiah for lack of qualification or wrongdoing, would result in riots like we haven&rsquo;t seen since the sixties.  Interesting times indeed.</p>

As a poster noted above, the Senate Democrats are useful idiots for Bobby Rush. Blagojevich is Obama&rsquo;s useful idiot - he&rsquo;ll fall on the sword for Obama, so as not to taint him in this scandal.</p>

		<p> Blacks love to fight blacks&hellip;it&rsquo;s what they do&hellip;it&rsquo;s ALL they do. The sooner our younger people learn this&hellip;the better. Blacks don&rsquo;t &#8220;unite&#8221; like the public thinks they do. They will literally kill each other the first chance they get. This is rule of thumb&hellip;not racism. It&rsquo;s bad enough many whites still do it.<br>
 <br>
 But in this Country blacks are learning the art of &#8220;blame someone else&#8221;. Common knowledge that they&rsquo;ve been doing this for decades. And every time one gets elected to ANY kind of public office, it just legitimizes it that much more.<br>
 <br>
 Many whites, including many on this site, keep spouting off about our Government and how evil it is. Wrong tactic people. C&rsquo;mon&hellip;don&rsquo;t be a liberal.<br>
 <br>
 When I leave my house every day, I don&rsquo;t worry about men in black jumping out of the bushes and making me disappear. Ain&rsquo;t gonna happen. The Government may want me to be scared and worried, but I&rsquo;m too much of a grown up for that. But you know who DOES what you to be afraid? That&rsquo;s right&hellip;blacks. Fortunately, I live in state where blacks are still afraid of whites. And for good reason.<br>
 <br>
 But I see this changing in the near future. They&rsquo;re adapting their criminal ideals to mainstrean America. It&rsquo;s becoming easy. Especially now that they&rsquo;ve learned how to turn us against each other. The media and the entire weight of the entertainment industry supports this very tactic.<br>
 <br>
 Yeah, keep using terms such as Evil Bush and McCrazy&hellip;Keep doing what these lowlife minorities what us to do. Turn on each other over everything&hellip;.and anything.<br>
 <br>
 And when your done being paranoid about G-men in your trees looking in your house with binoculars, you can start worrying about the black man in the car next to you at the stop light whose got a gun under his seat&hellip;just waiting for you to disrespect him.</p>

<p>With all due respect, this entire post comes across as confused nonsense.  It&rsquo;s like others we&rsquo;ve received on this site from blacks, inanely thinking they&rsquo;re cleverly tricking someone into a particular mind-set, but, instead, come across as nothing but illogical nonsense.</p>
<p>&#8220;And when you&rsquo;re done being paranoid about G-men in your trees, looking in your house with binoculars&#8221;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.Where on this forum have you ever read anything even remotely similar to that?</p>
<p>And &#8220;a black man at the stop light with a gun under his seat&#8221; is<br>
a very REAL possibility, as arrest records indicate.  Sorry, it&rsquo;s not on a par with &#8220;G-men in the trees.&#8221;</p>
<p>Can you give us more information as to just what point you are trying to make?</p>

		<p> In response to q per above by Sonny!&hellip;</p>
<p> The point should be clear&hellip;but I&rsquo;ll try again anyway. Many of the posts I read are very thoughtful and constructive. By individuals who genuinely want to make our Country what it once was. A nation of fighters and not snivelers.</p>
<p> Well, as anyone can plainly see, there must be more money to be made in the later. If the &#8220;G-men&#8221; comment struck a nerve with you, it should. I personally get frustrated preaching to the choir. And I&rsquo;m always looking for better ways to to find out what real Americans think of our future.</p>
<p> It just seems that no sooner do I read some great, constructive posts, than I start to come across people discussing how evil America is. Or how we&rsquo;re &#8220;doomed&#8221;. Or how the Government is out to get us. It&rsquo;s the Government&rsquo;s fault and we should just continue to hide behind our keypads and curse it&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p> Yeah, I know, I can&rsquo;t stand politicians either. They&rsquo;re Class-A botards who don&rsquo;t work for a living. I, personally speaking, cannot just sit around and blame the Govt &amp; minorities like they&rsquo;re some sort of untouchable &#8220;boogeyman&#8221;.</p>
<p> While minorities and their liberal doghandlers are the problem, I would just like to see some newer ideas for change. And voting blacks into the Whitehouse wasn&rsquo;t one of them.<br>
 No clever Blacks here&hellip;I don&rsquo;t believe in them myself. Like I said, and yeah it may have seemed non-sensical to the post, G-men aren&rsquo;t watching you, your liberal neighbor might be, though!</p>
<p> I just try to ad an xtra 2 cents worth when I can&hellip;no matter what post. But I thank you for the inquiry. Good to hear from you!<br>
Keep up the fight&hellip;and I&rsquo;ll try to keep on my toes! Oh yeah, don&rsquo;t let my grammar scare you&hellip;it scares ME enough&hellip;especially when it&rsquo;s 3:00 in the morning:)</p>
<p>     Sonny!</p>
