			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Liz Hazelton, Daily Mail (London), December 10, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Muslim lawyer has launched an extraordinary rant against Christmas, branding the celebration &lsquo;evil&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Hate preacher Anjem Choudary claimed the festival was the &lsquo;pathway to hell&rsquo; and urged his followers to boycott it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the world today many Muslims, especially those residing in Western countries, are exposed to the evil celebration Christmas,&rsquo; he raged in a sermon broadcast on the internet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Many take part in the festival celebrations by having Christmas turkey dinners.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Decorating the house, purchasing Christmas trees or having Christmas turkey meals are completely prohibited by Allah.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Many still practise this corrupt celebration as a remembrance of the birth of Jesus.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How can a Muslim possibly approve or participate in such a practice that bases itself on the notion Allah has an offspring?</p>
<p>&lsquo;The very concept of Christmas contradicts and conflicts with the foundation of Islam.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Every Muslim has a responsibility to protect his family from the misguidance of Christmas, because its observance will lead to hellfire.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Protect your Paradise from being taken away &mdash; protect yourself and your family from Christmas.&rsquo;</p>
<p>His comments were condemned by Robin Tilbrook, chairman of the English Democrats, who branded them &lsquo;nonsense&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You really start to wonder why the people behind this want to be in Britain in the first place,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why live here if that&rsquo;s how you feel?</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s an extremely narrow-minded, jihadist, anti-Western viewpoint. It&rsquo;s such a backwards take on things.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The ironic thing is Islam recognises Jesus as a leading prophet, and Christmas is based around him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m happy for these people to spout nonsense like this because it just shows them up for what they really are.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Fanatic Choudhary, 41, who is chairman of the Society of Muslim Lawyers, is the right-hand man of exiled preacher Omar Bakri Mohammed.</p>
<p>His family lives on £25,000-a-year benefit handout while he has gained notoriety as a firebrand speaker lauded by extremist groups.</p>
<p>In the past he has demanded the execution of the Pope, organised mass demonstrations against the publication of cartoons which allegedly insulted Mohammed and urged Muslims to have more babies to take over the UK.</p>
<p>Choudary&rsquo;s comments about Christmas come as councils were told by ministers to focus more strongly on tackling violent extremists</p>
<p>In speeches in London, both Communities Secretary Hazel Blears and Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said there needed to be a greater emphasis on &lsquo;confronting&rsquo; the &lsquo;sharper end&rsquo; of militant ideology, including directly targeting extremist leaders.</p>
<p>They said that it was no longer sufficient for councils to focus on promoting improved community cohesion while radicals were allowed to operate unhindered.</p>
<p>The ministers added that inaction risked allowing extremists to target the young and other vulnerable individuals and warned that some local authorities could lose funding if they failed to adopt a more robust approach to tackling radicalism.</p>
<p>Neither minister criticised any local authority directly,</p>
<p>But recent cases such as the revelation by the London Evening Standard that a speech by Omar Bakri Mohammed was broadcast during a meeting in a hall hired from Tower Hamlets council, have highlighted concerns.</p>
<p>In her speech, Ms Blears said that many councils had already engaged in positive work, such as training imams in English.<br>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see: to celebrate the birth of a baby at Christmas is &#8220;evil&#8221; and the &#8220;pathway to hell&#8221;. Yes it all makes sense now. </p>

		<p>Sounds like People for the American Way, Americans United for Separation of Church and State and all the other anti Christian, anti western civilization anti Christmas tree crowd in the United States.</p>
<p>In N. Carolina a Mother objected to the singing &#8220;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&#8221; at a public school because it contains the word Christmas.  </p>
<p>Athiests, muslims, communists and the ADL/SPLC ACLU prove that politics and religious bigotry make strange bedfellows.  They are all against Christmas, even the very word.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re really against western civilization and white Christians.</p>

		<p>  Why do people who hate British culture want to be in Britain  ?<br>
  To take the prosperity built by the British and to take Britain away from the tolerant British. Change the culture and change the results to what the immigrants left behind in their own countries.<br>
  This is one reason that only those of the same culture should be admitted.</p>

		<p>Islam is a pellucid example why multiculturalism is not viable, and why multiculturalism aka &#8220;diversity&#8221; is inherently skewed against Western, European, white culture.  All the contemporary <i>de rigueur</i> pabulum about &#8220;tolerance&#8221; and &#8220;coexistence&#8221; to the contrary, the human products of a culture (and Islam is as much a culture as it is a religion) seek predominance and preeminence for the culture they most strongly identify with.  A society which attempts to nag its individual members into identifying with several competing cultures simultaneously, as the leftist Western ruling classes do their native populations,  is indulging in an experiment that is absolutely doomed to failure: one indeed which prepares the ascendancy of the culture with the strongest group identification and loyalty.  In the case of England and other nations of Europe, that culture appears to be Islam.</p>

		<p> Something I&rsquo;ve noticed, be it in Europe or here, is that a large % of these &#8220;activists&#8221; live off the taxpayer. That&rsquo;s probably why they have the free time be activists, while the rest of us have to go to work to support them. Kinda like going out and buying a gun, and then giving it to someone so they can shoot you.</p>

		<p>AR asks the question,</p>
<p><i>Why do people who hate British culture want to be in Britain in the first place?</i></p>
<p>I ask this same question all the time.</p>
<p>I was riding home from work one day and a hispanic woman and a black teen were talking very loudly that their new homes in my white neighborhood wasn&rsquo;t like the neighborhood they left.</p>
<p>These people never seem to grasp the fact that they&rsquo;re escaping their own people to live in better communities but then complain their new communities are nothing like the communities they escaped. These people want all the benefits of living in a white community but they want to then live by their own non-white standards.</p>
<p>As for muslims, they have many muslim nations they can live in and live by muslim standards and yet they want to live in non-muslims nations. The reason is obvious. They want to turn non-muslim nations into muslim nations and they exploit our kindness, openness, tolerance, and laws against us; and we let them.</p>

		<p>The AmRen editor asks, &#8220;Why do people who hate British culture want to be in Britain in the first place?&#8221;.   That is not the right question but is easy to answer.  They do it for money.  The real question is: Why is this permitted and even encouraged by the British?  </p>
<p>Why has Christendom succumbed to the suicidal cult of marxism?  Is the White world destined to be Jonestown writ large?  It seems so, with a remnant left over to be consultants to the Chinese.</p>

<p>Exactly. Most Westerners are so unaware of Islam&rsquo;s true beliefs and intentions. I don&rsquo;t mind if he tells on his people. But, we need strong representatives who will not give in to their tirades and not let these types of opportunities go to waste. <br>

		<p>The British remind me of the protagonist in the Peckinpah movie &#8220;Straw Dogs&#8221;.</p>
<p>They keep turning the other cheek when the foreigners belittle them, insult them, use their women, take everything and actually want them to stand up and respond in a manly manner.  Yet they keep bowing to the punishment, and their meekness stimulates the adversary to even more extremes of abusiveness.</p>

<p>No, my white, self-hating friend.  They don&rsquo;t want the land.  They want the advanced improvements we built on it.</p>
<p>And when you say that &#8220;We&#8221; did something to the Indians, please just include your guilt-ridden self, because no one I know did anything at all to the Indians, but the Indians&rsquo; ancestors did kill, torture, and murder my ancestors in order to steal their assets and take in slaves, and they got their butts whipped real bad in the process.</p>

		<p>Interesting that choudary notes that christmas trees, turkey and house decorations are prohibited by allah. Well, the trees were introduced into England during Queen Victoria&rsquo;s time and we certainly did not eat turkey at christmas in those days, more like roast goose. Charles Dickens is testament to that! House decorations have been used during the winter solstice for thousands of years (long before moh&rsquo;d) especially holly and mistletoe. If choudary wants to be a typical miserable muslim over Christmas, so be it. But lets not forget he has insisted that UK schools be &#8216;all-inclusive&rsquo; and that Christian students celebrate islamic festivals. The muslim kids stay at home for these events and do not involve their Christian schoolmates. That&rsquo;s OK, just as long as we can have our Christmas Trees (NOT winter trees) and decorate our schools to suit. How he equates his own interpretation of allah&rsquo;s thoughts on Christmas is a bit of a mystery, since allah has never mentioned it and I very much doubt if choudary himself knows very much about it, in spite of obviously studying the topic, which, by his own teachings, is un-islamic. I bet his client list makes fascinating reading as he is Chairman of the Society of Muslim Lawyers. Indeed? I wonder how many females are members! Tower Hamlets is very nu-labour, which explains why he gets to use the hall for his tirades. He should talk to our prime minister, who is saving the world, and tell him to remove the offensive tree from outside number 10 as such a symbol is not permitted by islam and may cause passers-by to feel jolly and seasonally happy. No doubt choudary prefers the sight of blood-stained muslim children whipping themselves with knives, a far better way of celebrating a religious event.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know much about the history of the Indians in the U.S. This is not payback for us. Two wrongs don&rsquo;t make a right. </p>
<p>Islam does want our land, not just the land for their use; but it&rsquo;s people that go along with it. They believe all land should be Islamic. Convert or die. I&rsquo;d take death if were ever to come to that. As we continually see, they will stop at nothing to get what they want. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read many books on Islam, it&rsquo;s people, their prophet; books from a former Islamic terorist. They are very misguided.</p>

		<p>It amazes me how minorities seem to be the only folks who can become downright outraged at being offended and do it with impunity.  In other words, I rarely (never?) have read of whites going on car-burning sprees as insulted, angry muslims often do.  At one point, I actually was worried that most of the citizens of some European countries would find themselves without their cars. Naturally, for whites to be insulted or outraged would be simply racist, pure 100% unadulterated racism and nothing else.</p>
<p>Having said that, I am deeply offended by this lunatic&rsquo;s rantings.  I&rsquo;ve never been the best Christian in the world, nor have I often heeded the great admonition of my Church to hate the sin and not the sinner.  This guy is the limit.  Christians never have said or implied that allah has offspring.  The Holy Trinity has nothing at all to do with allah.  The crazy philosophies and celebrations of islam directly conflict with the foundations of Christianity. As far as who&rsquo;s going to hell, we&rsquo;ll see about that.  I hope they have a special eighth level of hell for these zealots.   </p>

		<p>Anybody who wants to get an insight into the true nature and purposes of Islam should read two books by Ibn Warraq (a necessary nom-de-plume meaning &#8220;son of the maker of books&#8221;), an ex-Muslim (therefore an apostate under sentence of death) who had the clarity of intellect combined with the immense moral courage to reject the faith-cum-ideology into which he had been born and to rail against its manifold failings and wickednesses:</p>
<p>1) &#8220;Why I Am Not A Muslim&#8221; (Prometheus Books, 1995);</p>
<p>2) &#8220;Defending The West&#8221; (Prometheus Books, 2007).</p>
<p>The latter is a salutary counterblast to the fashionable lunacy of the late Edward Said (especially his widely-read book &#8220;Orientalism&#8221;). Ibn Warraq has also edited a valuable volume of scholarly essays and Koranic commentaries, &#8220;What The Koran Really Says&#8221; (Prometheus Books, 2002). </p>

		<p>My gift and promise to God is to work to exterminate the hate that is in Islam and of course to keep those devilish people out of our lands.</p>

		<p>The Western politicians who allow these interlopers into their countries are the absolute worst kind of traitors, because they are providing aid and comfort to an enemy that not only strives to possess our nations, but intends to obliterate our religions as well.  These inbred clinically insane Medieval throwbacks want to destroy all non-Muslim secular and sectarian values and replace them with Islam.</p>
<p>Allah is their name for Satan.  Allah is not God.  Allah&rsquo;s messenger Mohammed was a child raping pedophile who married his favorite bride when she turned six and consummated their marriage when she turned nine.  Islam is not a religion of peace.  Islam is not a religion at all.  The Koran is not a holy book.  The Koran is the Book of Satan that ensues conquest, murder, rape and the total acquiescence of ones soul to evil incarnate.</p>
<p>These are the people our politicians are selling their political influence to in exchange for oil money.  These are the people our local politicians and bureaucrats go out of their way to please.  These are the people we must drive from our lands as our ancestors have done repeatedly throughout history.  These are the children of Satan&hellip;<br>
