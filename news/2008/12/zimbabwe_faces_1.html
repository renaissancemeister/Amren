<h1><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-12-02-zimbabwe-cholera_N.htm">Zimbabwe Faces Water and Cholera Crisis</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, December 2, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This week, authorities turned off the taps in Zimbabwe&rsquo;s capital after the National Water Authority said it ran out of purifying chemicals and feared contaminated water would spread a cholera epidemic that has claimed hundreds of lives since August.</p>
<p>The crisis is the latest chapter in the collapse of this once-vibrant nation under President Robert Mugabe, who has ruled for 28 years and refuses to leave office even though he and his party lost elections in March.</p>
<p>An agreement to form a unity government with the opposition has been deadlocked for weeks over how to share Cabinet posts.</p>
<p>In Mabvuku, a suburb where residents have dug shallow wells in open ground, people say they know unboiled water can make them ill, but that they have no choice.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are afraid but there is no solution, most of the time the electricity is not available so we just use the water,&#8221; resident Naison Chakwicha told AP Television News.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Harare is the epicenter of the cholera epidemic, which has spread across the country and spilled over its borders.</p>
<p>The government has reported 473 deaths since August and a total of 11,700 people infected by Monday, according to Paul Garwood, spokesman for Health Action and Crises, the humanitarian arm of the U.N. World Health Organization.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Doctors say the toll is nearer 1,000 dead, or 10% of victims, but nobody can count those dying at home and in the countryside without medical care. All the country&rsquo;s main hospitals have closed.</p>
<p>Those continuing to operate can offer little care with no medicines and a shortage of staff whose monthly salary does not cover one day&rsquo;s bus fare to get to work.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The collapse of all services, including refuse collection, has turned the city into a playground for rats that threaten to spread other, more deadly, diseases.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Those without foreign currency must turn to &#8220;water Samaritans&#8221; &mdash; suburban residents who have wells or boreholes and are allowing people to fill buckets and jerry cans for free. Some residents are charging for the privilege.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The crisis is the latest chapter in the collapse of this once-vibrant nation&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>This is only one further example that black nations cannot operate in any rational manner. When whites ruled this country, it had a semblance of order and services that functioned almost a the level of a Western country. However, when a black majority takes over, the technology-based infrastructure must be maintained properly in order to operate. Blacks do not have, and have never had such technical capabilities as installing or maintaining water and electrical systems. So the labor of generations of whites will eventually dissolve into an ancient ruin. It makes me wonder what will happen in the future in America, with the continual influx of non-white hoardes. Where will they get clean water in ever-increasing quantities in California in the future? Or elsehwere in America? </p>

<p>Now the four-legged rats have joined the two-legged rats of Mugabe, in making Zimbabwe their playground. But, the four-legged rats won&rsquo;t spread nearly the disease and misery that Mugabe&rsquo;s cronies have done.</p>
<p>Led a hundred flowers bloom over Zimbabwe&rsquo;s grave. Let a hundred jackals contest over her remains.</p>

		<p>Normally, all the labor necessary to provide clean water iwas done by white people.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for them, the blacks murdered them all.</p>
<p>One thing I absolutely do not want is for white nations like the US to intervene in this.  These monsters are going to pay for what they have done.  Pay via the consequences of their own evil behavior.  The international community sat back and did NOTHING while they were committing the crime of genocide against whites. It would be treasonous and despicable to step in now, at the eleventh hour as they reap the consequences of their own foulness.</p>

		<p>African logic: Blame the whites for everything wrong in your country -  then run the whites out of your country - then when things fall apart flee to the country built by whites (South Africa), run to white countries for donor aid, and simultaneously receive billions of dollars in food aid from white countries.</p>
<p>All the while blaming whites for your predicament, and continuing to vote for black rule.</p>
<p>And raping and killing the very people that have done more for blacks than any other nation, i e the Afrikaners.</p>
<p>It may sound harsh to the western mind, but Africa should be given some tough love and be forced to start looking after themselves. Africa contributes absolutely nothing of value to the world, so why should they be treated like children of a higher god ?</p>
<p>What Africa urgently requires is some adult supervision. </p>

		<p>  Gee, is this what we have to look forward to in the future? Rampant inflation will be part of our vocabulary pretty soon. The dollar isn&rsquo;t worth anything. As long as I have my farm, I guess I&rsquo;ll have water considering I do have a well and a large creek. That is, as long as the government allows me to keep it. All the headaches and heartaches of Zimbabwe and South Africa could be a prelude to future.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s very common in Africa: epidemics, famines, civil wars, criminality. Blacks are unable to build prosperous countries despite all the natural resources they have. Did you know that Robert Mugabe, the eternal president of Zimbabwe, murders his political opponents, ignores unfavorable court decisions, terrorizes the population and siphons off millions from the state treasury for himself, his family and his friends?<br>
Zimbabwe, once the thriving and stable Rhodesia under the white rule, looted the people (the white men) who feed the nation and then force them to leave the country. </p>
<p>&#8220;Yet whites do not admit that the same kind of savagery could come to America and Europe when enough immigrants of the right type assert themselves. Those Western politicians now have a similar problem looming on their own doorsteps: the demand for power and treasure from the non-white peoples inside their countries.&#8221;</p>

		<p>China will &#8220;save&#8221; Africa from itself (at least until all their oil, minerals and other resources run out). They will make sure that African miners have at least a minimum level of nutrition to work 14 hours a day. Zimbabwe will be a defacto province of China in ten years or less. Recent visitors to Africa (such as Peter Hitchens) have observed how the Chinese are taking over and how they are treating their African brothers and sisters. They have no guilt plaguing them and an inbred sense of superiority. Almost all the money Starbucks sends to Africa today ends up in a Swiss bank account. When the Chinese are running things, at least the money will buy some grub for the slave laborers. </p>

<p>https://www.davidbenariel.org/africa/warning-america-south-africa.htm</p>
<p>Posted by Ed at 9:51 AM on December 3 </p>
<p>&gt; Thanks, Ed - I read this article and would like to point out several things to Amren readers;</p>
<p>1.  The North American White population is much higher than SA&rsquo;s ever was, this puts us in a better position in many ways, IF we wake up and begin to demand some rights ourselves.  </p>
<p>2.  Having a minority race president will put us into a positon where have a White Coalition Party or organizaiton will be more difficult to argue down.</p>
<p>3.  Self defense is considered a right in this country - most states - and the right to bear arms is a fiercely defended Second Amendment right that only a dictator could reverse.</p>
<p>4.  I would finally like to point out that the writer of the article is Jewish.  Those of you who always see a Jew behind every White suppressive movement have a lot to learn (I see more Christians than Jews).  In fact, Isael trains and arms its citizens as a citizen-militia better than we do.</p>

		<p>For over a hundred years the Black man was kept down by the White man in Zimbabwe.  Now, finally, the Blacks have seized total control of that bountiful, natural-resource-rich country,  and are free to create a Black paradise to the best of their genetic and behavioral capabilities.   I say, cheers to you Zimbabwe: Free at last!  Free at last!  </p>

		<p>There has been a series on the History Channel that deals with what would happen  if humans were gone from the earth, I think it&rsquo;s called After People. Maybe they got the inspiration from what&rsquo;s going on in Africa. </p>
<p>In fact, they could send a documentary team to Zimbabwe or South Africa and make a film called After White People. </p>
<p>Bring your own drinking water though.</p>

But, I warn you, if you&rsquo;re an animal lover as I am, this film contains lots of footage of senceless animal slaughter and will break your heart as it did mine. I went to bed last night with those visions in my mind and had to get up and take a sleeping pill to go to sleep. But this is something that HAS to be seen by us to understand what happens when 3rd worlders take over. Not only do people suffer, but also countless innocent animals are also brutalized and slaughtered.</p>

		<p>Do you ever wonder if the mixing of European-based cultures with lower cultures has slowed the advancement of Whites?  Where would we be as whites if we lived in an all white land and didn&rsquo;t need to spend billions of dollars on welfare and prisons and crime control and failing schools?  Would we be exploring planet Venus now?  What sort of beautiful country could we hand to our children?    </p>
<p>People are all at different levels of enlightenment.  Since ethnic groups and races are large extended families, ethnic groups create cultures based upon their group consciousness and I.Q.  Enlightenment is a combination of intelligence, virtue, emotional control, lust control, and a spiritual connection to a good and kind God.  Most blacks are just not cut from the same cloth as most whites.  Of course there are wonderful blacks out there, but most of them are just not like us.  They are earthier and less abstract.  They are often more emotional, more physical, less intelligent, and less inventive.  In other words, they are not as evolved.   </p>
<p>We whites are currently in a bad situation, because we live in Western countries that are actually opposed to us.  Our leaders are trying to prove a point, and that point is:  All people and races are exactly the same, and the only reason there could possibly be for any difference in achievement and behavior is because of evil white oppression.  Therefore, if it means spending taxpayers&rsquo; money on social programs and expensive yet failing schools to prove this, they will do so for as long as it takes, because the equality of the races is a religion to these people.  If whites are hurt by this social experiment, as in South Africa, they don&rsquo;t care, they never really liked us anyway.</p>

		<p>The problem is of course not strictly limited to the shallow wells they&rsquo;re digging.  Cholera depends not just on unfiltered, unboiled water, but on its continued contamination with body wastes.  It accomplishes this by causing diarrhea.  What this means is that in post-civilization Zimbabwe, the blacks have not only forgotten about the natural filtration advantages of deep wells (in which rainwater must penetrate many feet of sand and clay before entering the well) and the sterilizing effects of heat on drinking water, but that they have also somehow forgotten how to dig privies, something every boy scout knows in the United States.  Other diseases that rely on fecal-oral contact can thus be expected shortly, and some of these, like typhus and typhoid are real killers.  The same flies that land on exposed human waste will also happily land on food.</p>
<p>If basic sanitation has collapsed so completely in Zimbabwe, another safe bet is that rodents will be attracted to the food waste and trash around human habitation there.  African rodents are known to act as reservoirs for Lassa, a deadly viral hemmorhagic fever related to the Hantaviruses found in Eurasia and the Americas and bubonic plague, among others.  Moreover, people suffering from malnutrition typically have weakened autoimmune systems, making them more succeptable to invection.</p>
<p>The departure of whites from Zimbabwe and Mugabe&rsquo;s utterly incompetant rule will expose the country to an epidemic of epidemics.</p>

		<p>To paraphrase Bessie Smith,  &#8220;Oooooooh, you&rsquo;ll miss us when we&rsquo;re gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>What will the world do, once they&rsquo;ve run out of white people to fix things.  But then, after the final white has expired, like the last temple virgin of Maccu Piccu, will anyone even remember?  Will anyone even know that there were once televisions and cell phones?  Will anyone mourn the loss of due process or free speech?  Will the genome recover, eventually, that there might once again be archaeologists and historians to study the long-perished white culture?  I doubt it.</p>
<p>Discovering and studying ancient cultures is entirely a phenomenon arising from Western Civilization.  Once we&rsquo;re gone, the world will be too stupid to know what it has lost.</p>
