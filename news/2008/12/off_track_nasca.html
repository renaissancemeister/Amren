<h1>Off Track, NASCAR Ensured Racial Pioneer Couldn&rsquo;t Win</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brian Donovan, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, December 21, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On Tuesday, 18 years will have passed since the death of a remarkable racial pioneer: Wendell Scott, NASCAR&rsquo;s first black driver. {snip}</p>
<p>Scott&rsquo;s dream of becoming a competitive national-level racer depended on support from NASCAR&rsquo;s celebrated founder and czar, the late Bill France Sr. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As the growing civil rights struggle inflamed racial tensions in the 1960s, France reneged on his promise, and a pattern of unfair treatment by NASCAR followed. France denied Scott the Rookie of the Year Award for his first major-league season, even though Scott was the top rookie in the standings.</p>
<p>When Scott won his only national race, NASCAR officials, fearing he&rsquo;d kiss the white trophy queen, declared another driver the victor. Long after the crowd and the queen had left, NASCAR grudgingly admitted that Scott had won.</p>
<p>For years South Carolina&rsquo;s major track, Darlington Raceway, banned Scott because he was black. This cost him any chance for sponsorship. France addressed the problem with inaction and silence. When Scott finally asked for help, he said France told him that Darlington was important to NASCAR&rsquo;s success and Scott should just be patient.</p>
<p>When senior NASCAR officials and major promoters mistreated Scott, France continued his hands-off neutrality. One official abused his authority and excluded Scott from an important race at Charlotte. Others did the same thing at the speedways in Daytona Beach, Fla., and Martinsville, Va. &mdash; facilities in which France owned major financial interests. Repeatedly, officials harassed Scott over trivial issues: his son&rsquo;s beards, minor blemishes in his car&rsquo;s paint.</p>
<p>At one prestigious NASCAR event, Scott was exploited in a bogus promotional scheme. A record crowd packed Charlotte&rsquo;s speedway after the promoter announced he&rsquo;d give Scott his first chance to drive a competitive car. But the car was a phony; its weak performance embarrassed Scott in front of 81,000 spectators.</p>
<p>France helped other drivers obtain sponsorship for competitive cars, but not Scott. This pattern of unfairness persisted, insiders say, largely because France and other influential executives in the NASCAR world believed that a competitive black driver would be bad for business. At the time France was cultivating alliances with leading segregationist politicians such as Alabama Gov. George Wallace, and those relationships helped NASCAR to grow into today&rsquo;s multibillion-dollar enterprise.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When we cling to the comfort of denying what we&rsquo;ve done wrong in the past, we hobble our ability to understand the unfair situations we should be trying to correct today.</p>
<p>Even if NASCAR can&rsquo;t figure out how to put another Wendell Scott on its speedways, it should at least find some way to express regret for its shabby treatment of an American integration pioneer, one of the many whose struggles helped to open doors for African-Americans to all sectors of our society, including the door to the Oval Office.<br>

		<p>What a biased article.  </p>
<p>He uses the phrase &#8220;some say&hellip;&#8221;,  &#8220;Others say&hellip;&#8221;,  &#8220;Some feel&hellip;&#8221; as though quoting opinions of anonymous sources is tantamount to presenting a fact.  </p>
<p>And then there is this gem: &#8220;Others believe an apology would be quite unlikely, since NASCAR, still owned by the France family, has never honestly acknowledged its role in robbing Scott of his dream.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Well maybe the France family is right.  Maybe he wasn&rsquo;t robbed.<br>
&#8220;Others believe he wasn&rsquo;t robbed, but instead lost fair and square.&#8221;  See how easy it is to quote anonymous sources. <br>

		<p>That the MSM are upset that there is something white people like that has very few non-whites is not surprising.  But what I&rsquo;m more interested in is NASCAR&rsquo;s reaction.  It is an industry that has made a lot of money with very very few minorities to thank, nearly all whites.  Therefore it&rsquo;s not broke, are they going to &#8220;fix&#8221; it?  They&rsquo;re trying enough, AFAIC.</p>

		<p>Ah, how terrible another injustice to blacks.  Will it never end?</p>
<p>Or is it just exaggerated blather that is blown out of proportion and full of lies, because citing black injustices nowadays is the chic thing to do.</p>

		<p>I grew up listening to country music, real country music, and hearing about NASCAR. I never got into car racing much. I thought it was too red-neck. I&rsquo;ve been to a dirt track race. It&rsquo;s pretty fun when you know what to look for. I&rsquo;m back listening to more country music because of the more conservative white point-of-view. Although, I was glad to see Darius Rucker (black singer from Hootie and the Blowfish) singing his country song that I like rather than seeing another white blonde that hadn&rsquo;t paid her dues. </p>
<p>The drinking and hanging out with a bunch of white people that enjoy the same things as you is what many whites choose to do for fun. Leave well enough alone!</p>

<p>Yes it does work Brett.  It is working right now   &mdash;   but only for non-Whites.  The non-Whites coming here do want a place to call their own   &mdash;  - OUR PLACE.  They&rsquo;re taking our country away from us and will call it their own eventually after they displace we Whites.  Not a very nice thing to look forward to.</p>

		<p>This article is utter nonsense.  Wendell Scott was simply one of many NASCAR journeymen drivers who soldiered on for years without major sponsorship and without notable success.  He undeniably was a good, honest competitor who earned the respect of his fellow drivers, but whether he had the talent to be top tier driver probably will never be known.  </p>
<p>But the notion that NASCAR and its many sponsors, unlike other professional sports, would overlook black talent in favor of whites, is ridiculous on its face.</p>

		<p>Here it comes. They dig up lies because they have nothing else. Revisionism to draw sympathy. In the old days racing was brand new and a rugged tough sport that involved whites trying to wreck each other and fighting was common. Competition was fierce and whites hated whites in the stands and fought each other also. This was the same for anything. Beofre integration ruined it all whites commonly fought each other in everything from high school football to pro football. Whites had no love for each other and still dont. Blacks also had every alternative to create their own black racing tracks just like they invented their own black baseball but they know they cant sustain businesses or anything so they much integrate with whites who fully sustain themselves. This is the same for anything in western society. Its always blacks trying to get into white instititutions and white events and never the reverse. </p>
<p>It all started with the horrid mistake of slavery and later the creation of marxism and then immediately came the hero of Bush and Limbaugh and the elite northern Republican party &hellip;<br>
What a con. What a mistake. </p>

		<p>I see an opportunity for another movie,the Wendall Scott story.They will need a nice black actor who in the opening scene  can be holding kittens.Then the mean over weight balding white man can kick poor Wendall in the head and drown the kittens.Also the mean white man has a tattoo of a confederate flag on his arm.Wendall will be the church going black man who reads to the blind part time.Of course we need the whites that control NASCAR to be drunk hillbillies who beat their wives.One abused white woman works secretly in the movie with Wendell which brings the whole corrupt white system down.Once they have planted these falsehood images  in the minds of the general public,then they can sit back and allow white guilt to take over. </p>

		<p>Given the historical time and place that the accounts of these events are set in, (Jim Crow South  &mdash;  a time and place in which most Whites were obsessed with humiliating and keeping Blackie down) it seems odd that rational profit motivated businessmen (who ostensibly knew and understood the mentality of their market) in charge of a multi-million dollar a year sports enterprise would act to quietly and conspiratorially undermine an anomaly of the times such as Wendell Scott.  </p>
<p>An astute businessman of those times would have promoted <br>
Scott and a contest to see which white NASCAR driver could do him in on the track.</p>

		<p>Wendell Scott won one race and writer Donovan is ready to annoint him as the &#8216;Black Richard Petty&#8221;. He was at best, a backmarker and mediocre driver.</p>
<p>They DID make a movie about him, several years ago. It starred Richard Pryor.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t doubt that Wendell Scott had some ability. However, as has been said here, I doubt he was in Richard Petty&rsquo;s class. As has also been said above, blacks could have set up their own version of NASCAR, but didn&rsquo;t/haven&rsquo;t. This leads us to question whether or not they have the drivers, pit crews, money men, etc., to pull off such a venture? If, not, why after all this time are they still at square one in this venue? Why don&rsquo;t blacks ever move beyond yelling about what a bum deal they&rsquo;ve had throughout history? People find the constant bleating of blacks tiresome to say the least. This isn&rsquo;t just White people either. It includes people of all the other races that inhabit this planet as well. you should here what Oriental people have to say about black people. Not very nice. I furvently wish blacks could move beyond their constant complaing, but if they ever did, I think their reason for existing would evaporate completely. They&rsquo;re just stuck in this society that has outgrown them years ago and they have no other recourse other than what they&rsquo;re about. I sure would hate to get up each morning and have nothing else on my mind but the fact that I&rsquo;m black and don&rsquo;t belong. Very sad situation.</p>

		<p>The writer makes it sound like NASCAR grew in popularity because of Bill France Sr.&rsquo;s ties to segregationist politicians. He goes on to say that Talladega Superspeedway was built with state money.</p>
<p>WRONG! Talladega was built with private money. France Sr. bought the land himself, and built the speedway with his own money, and, I think with some help from corporate money.</p>
<p>As far as NASCAR gaining in popularity because of France Sr.&rsquo;s &#8220;ties&#8221;, the author is way off base. NASCAR gaines by a split in the open wheel racing ranks, and also by people being fed up with the antics of athletes in the stick and ball sports, like baseball, basketball and football.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say it again -Wndell Scott was at best, a mediocre driver who won one race in his career. The ONLY reason some people thought he was a big deal is because of his being black - a lump of coal in a snowfield; a freakazoid.</p>
