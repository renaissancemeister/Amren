<h1>Rich World Needs More Foreign Workers: Report</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Eliane Engeler, AP, Dec. 2, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An international migration organization appealed Tuesday to countries to keep open their doors to immigrant workers despite the global economic crises.</p>
<p>The International Organization for Migration said that, despite the current downturn, rich nations will continue to need foreign workers to fill jobs their shrinking work forces cannot or will not do.</p>
<p>In its 4th World Migration Report, the Geneva-based intergovernmental body said there are more than 200 million migrants around the world today.</p>
<p>Developed nations compete for highly skilled immigrants, but there is also a growing need for low-skilled workers in rich countries, the report said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Appave said the Asian financial crisis in the 1990s demonstrated that the need for immigrant workers continues, even during times of economic hardship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s always jobs that the host population don&rsquo;t want to do,&rdquo; said IOM spokeswoman Jemini Pandya. She said that, in many countries, the demand for workers in health care, domestic care and service industries will continue to grow.</p>
<p>Europe hosted the largest number of immigrants, with 70.6 million people in 2005, the latest year for which figures are available, the report said.</p>
<p>North American, with over 45.1 million immigrants, is second, followed by Asia, which hosts nearly 25.3 million.</p>
<p>Most of today&rsquo;s migrant workers come from Asia, and demographic data suggest that by 2030, China and India will provide 40 percent of the global work force, the report said.</p>

<p>Good heavens. These people lie to you with a straight face and expect you to believe their dire predictions.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face facts: Low skilled immigrants are reproducing low skilled workers by the hospital full. There&rsquo;s no reason to bring in more when you have a self-sustaining and growing population of low skilled workers (or truthfully, non-workers).</p>
<p>Modern economic theory is nothing more than a Ponzi Scheme:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_scheme" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_scheme</a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a rush to the bottom to find the lowest wages. The problem is that you eventually get there. As each successive work force agrees (or is forced) to work for lower wages, wages keep falling until you reach the bottom and no one can afford to buy anything.</p>
<p>Henry Ford said he wanted to pay his workers good wages so they could afford to buy his cars. That idea has long since been abandoned for finding the lowest paid workers.</p>
<p>If modern economic theory was sound, then what&rsquo;s happening in California shouldn&rsquo;t be happening because they have more than enough migrant workers flooding their streets:</p>

		<p>Note that Asia&rsquo;s 25.3 million figure is a much lower percentage of its overall population than either Europe or North America.</p>
<p>In China alone, there are 300 million migratory workers.  That means that there are as many Chinese in China roaming around from place to place looking for work that won&rsquo;t last long as there are people in the whole USA.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve never liked the middle-class being I&rsquo;m working class and they are usually my boss. Bosses who only have time for women and colored folks. I have to wonder, though, if all this talk about the importance of &#8216;saving the middle class&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t some kind of racial plan. Between the importation of doctors and technicians and unskilled laborers, the middle class is liable to end up being &#8216;the white class&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>This doesn&rsquo;t really get specific though.  In Europe, the majority of &#8220;migrants&#8221; come from neighboring European countries.  </p>

		<p>Unemployment in most European countries hovers at around 10 per cent. Wages in the US have been stagnant for over 30 years. Neither of these facts bespeaks a labor shortage of any kind.</p>

		<p>Undeveloped countries are already overpopulated but continue growing at faster rates. Women in many African countries have 6 or 7 children. Where will they work? This is unsustainable. Instead of encouraging mass migrations, our world needs very strict birth control in poor countries and higher fertility rates in European countries (2 or 3 children per woman for generational replacement). Education in values is the key, European teenagers must understand the importance of forming a family and raising children.</p>

		<p>You&rsquo;d think that the nations of the world do nothing but pick cotton, harvest grains, or cut sugar cane, the way they talk about labor shortages. The health care and service industries aren&rsquo;t all that labor-intensive, the way agriculture is.</p>
<p>If so many workers are needed where there are perceived labor shortages, then how do these nations expect to keep their environments &#8220;green&#8221;? How do they expect their energy needs to be met? It&rsquo;s a fact of life - the more people there are, the more living space is needed, as well as everything else..</p>
<p>Notice that the same people who champion diversity and multiculturalism also champion the planet going &#8220;green&#8221; and sound the clarion call about global warming. The world will eventually be pulled apart like taffy. I hope I&rsquo;m not around to see it.</p>

		<p>The global economic crisis is CAUSED because money and wealth are being siphoned off by greedy foreigners.</p>
<p>If all welfare was suspended.  If all aid to foreign countries was suspended.  If all immigrants were deported.  The economic crisis would vanish within hours&hellip;not weeks, months or years&hellip;..hours.</p>
<p>And the worst part about it, nothing would be any worse for it.</p>

		<p>So, the way to allieviate a famine is to import more hungry mouths into the famine stricken region.<br>

<p>Blame it on unions and &#8220;heart bleeding&#8221; liberals.</p>
<p>They keep artificially inflate the wages of the workers while decreasing the average workload (shorter work week, increased disability and sick time) and employment (more and more workers get on some kind of social dole so that they don&rsquo;t have to work at all). As much as it looks just and noble, it&rsquo;s being abused by many to the point that there is not enough blue collar workforce available, and those who still are available tend to be too expensive to make an enterprise a profitable one.</p>
<p>So, they need imported &#8220;cheap&#8221; labor. And here the vicious circle closes: the imported proletariat is quickly coached how to get the same benefits as the domestic one, and becomes equally expensive and apprehensive about working 40 hours a week as the natives.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s like the unionized workforce needed someone to actually work for them and their social perks, just like oligarchies in ancient civilizations needed slaves to do something. And this antiquated model is about as sustainable as a letter-chain scam is.</p>
