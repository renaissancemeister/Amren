			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Teresa Watanabe, Los Angeles Times, December 15, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For two decades, Anaheim businessman Erkan Aydin has taken on a task unimaginable for most immigrants like himself: trying to convince the U.S. government that he was here illegally.</p>
<p>Aydin, 50, arrived in the United States from his native Turkey with a valid student visa in 1981, but fell out of legal status when he failed to enroll in school, he said.</p>
<p>The customer service representative has a powerful reason why he wants to be considered an illegal immigrant. It would make him eligible for the amnesty offered to 2.7 million illegal immigrants under the 1986 immigration reform law.</p>
<p>Thanks to a recent legal settlement, the chance to apply for amnesty is finally open to Aydin and tens of thousands of others who entered the country on a valid visa but fell out of legal status between 1982 and 1988. The settlement, approved this fall by a U.S. district court in Washington state, stems from a class-action lawsuit filed by attorney Peter Schey originally on behalf of an immigrant assistance program of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The landmark reform law offered a one-time amnesty to immigrants who were in the United States unlawfully from before 1982 to about 1988.</p>
<p>But Congress was concerned that those who entered the country with a valid visa would argue that they fell out of legal status during that time simply to qualify for amnesty. As a result, Schey said, Congress created a rule requiring immigrants to show that their shift from legal to illegal status was &#8220;known to the government.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>U.S. immigration officials accepted both arguments in the settlement. They have announced that immigrants whose cases involve violations known to the government may apply for amnesty between Feb. 1, 2009, and Jan. 31, 2010.</p>
<p>Although the settlement was announced in September, many immigrants are just learning about it. Sofuluke, now a Maryland administrator, just found out about it last week.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The settlement marks Schey&rsquo;s third and final class-action lawsuit over the 1986 amnesty law. The previous lawsuits, both settled in 2003, resulted in more than 150,000 immigrants being allowed to apply for amnesty.</p>
<p>In the first lawsuit, Schey successfully challenged U.S. policy that effectively barred from amnesty applicants who traveled outside the United States roughly between 1986 and 1988. Although Congress specifically allowed a &#8220;brief, innocent and casual absence&#8221; during that period for, say, holiday visits, immigration authorities at the time essentially declared that anyone who left and reentered illegally was not &#8220;innocent&#8221; and therefore became ineligible for amnesty.</p>
<p>In the second lawsuit, Schey argued against the rejection of amnesty applicants who had returned home and reentered with a valid visa. Immigration officials at the time held that the reentry was legal, breaking the continued illegal residency required for amnesty. Schey argued, however, that the reentry was illegal because the immigrants would have to have lied about themselves when they applied for the visa to return.</p>

		<p>About a year ago, I got one of those chain e-mails, jokingly suggesting that one should become an illegal alien, and it listed the benefits, welfare and otherwise, that one would receive by doing so.  I thought it was an untenable joke, but here&rsquo;s someone actually wanting to do it, for almost the same reason.</p>

		<p>This is insane!  The government will reward you, but ONLY if you broke the law.  It is almost as if our government is trying to say, &#8220;You can ignore our laws.  In fact, we want you to break the law. We will even reward you if you break the law.&#8221;  </p>

		<p>Americans better face one very obvious fact  &mdash;  no one in Washington cares to look out for them, so they had better be prepared to look out for themselves. Nothing, absolutely nothing of any substance that would affect the lives of Americans, in a positive way,is even considered by the worthless traitors in Washington. Only fools would believe that Obama and the Democrats are going to do anything positive for them.</p>
<p>We need to wake up and become acquainted and associated with folks who are living in reality right within our local environment. There are many, many, intelligent Americans who know the present political parties in power are totally useless to them and are doing something about it outside of relying on the system. Supporting the big stores and the big companies any longer is useless. They will never change in a way that benefits Americans.</p>
<p>Get off the reservation and try to live your life in a way you know you can, but have never tried because of fear. I have changed many things in my life that I thought I could never do without and it has done nothing but benefit me. For example, junk food, junk sports, junk television, junk movies  &mdash;  all gone. My health has improved, my expenses have decreased, my skills in old hobbies have increased and therefore, I&rsquo;ve enjoyed them more than ever. We cannot let the &#8220;Failures&#8221; who run our nation, put us into a state of inertia and desperation.</p>

		<p>Anon 6:09:  That&rsquo;s exactly the message they want to send.  That way our betters get the serfs they want, but no particular politician has to make an unpopular choice.</p>

		<p>I find it a bitter pill to swallow - the overthrow of our nation by a third world country. It seems that the criminal mindset of Mexicans could be put to far better use by improving their own government rather than overtaking a country that they immediately want to turn into a replica of the hellhole they left. What&rsquo;s more they are aided and abetted by our own government. Do our leaders not care that when the minority becomes the majority that they will be out and that we will be Mexico North? Just check the border states and see what the rest of the country is in for. Is this what you want for your children and grandchildren? If not, let your representatives know - loudly and often. </p>

   wouldn&rsquo;t each USA citizen of generations<br>
   have liked to have had AMNESTY to be with their families&hellip;.<br>
   INSTEAD they choose to fight for the FREEDOMS not being given away by those who systematically sacrificed our own ancestry for CRIMINAL ILLEGAL ALIEN INVADERS.<br>
