<h1>Police: &lsquo;Jena Six&rsquo; Teen Shoots Self, Is Treated</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, December 30, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A teen convicted in the &#8220;Jena Six&#8221; beating case shot himself in the chest and was taken to the hospital Monday, days after his arrest on a shoplifting charge, police said.</p>
<p>Mychal Bell&rsquo;s wound isn&rsquo;t life threatening, said Monroe Police Sgt. Cassandra Wooten. The 18-year-old used a .22-caliber firearm in the shooting around 7:40 p.m., she said.</p>
<p>Wooten believes Bell was upset over media coverage of the arrest last week.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bell was one of a group of black teenagers who once faced attempted murder charges in the 2006 beating of a white classmate at Jena High School. The charges for all of the defendants were reduced.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bell was in the news again after he was arrested on Dec. 24 and booked on charges of shoplifting, resisting arrest and simple assault, police said.</p>
<p>Police said Bell tried to steal several shirts and a pair of jeans from a department store and fled when a security guard and off-duty police officer tried to detain him. After they found him hiding under a car, Bell &#8220;swung his arms wildly&#8221; and one of his elbows struck the security guard with a glancing blow, according to a police report. He was freed on $1,300 bond.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bell, the only one of the six who has been tried, has been living in a foster home in Monroe and attending school.<br>

<p>Why wasnt this person living in a jail somewhere? He leads a pack of 6 (minimum) thugs in a hatecrime assault on one lone boy and he isnt in jail? An attack so severe that he is originally charged with attempted murder? And he is walking around freely. Then he shoplifts and assaults an officer and then is released after posting a SMALL bail? Looks like this thug is going to be a future lifetime inmate. IF some judge doesnt decide he needs 10 or 20 more chances before he is locked away. Lets hope he doesnt kill someone before that happens. <br>

		<p>I knew that when this young man was subjected to pernicious White racism that it would end up with him not being able to take it, being driven to shoplifting, and possibly even shooting himself.</p>
<p>Seriously though, Mychal, you aimed about a foot too low! </p>

		<p>Darn, I was hoping Mr. Bell passed from this earth.  He&rsquo;ll probably recover and live to assault and rape more white men and women throughout his life.  This kid is a total waste of space and the sooner he&rsquo;s placed in prison the better. </p>

		<p>Why is he stealing? Surely all that money raised for those boys  should cover his clothing needs&hellip;. or is there more to this? Where did he get a gun? Note the passive voice to the report. As if he has no control over his thefts, and the security guard got hit by a random elbow&hellip;. geez&hellip; </p>

As with OJ and Rodney King, Mychal(sic) Bell was given a &#8216;get out of jail&rsquo; pass. All he had to do was stay out of trouble.</p>
<p>Apparently this troubled teen who only needed the help and guidance of a caring and nurturing black community to straighten out his life, after his savage attack of a white student, didn&rsquo;t get the help and guidance the black community assured us was the heart of the problem.</p>
<p>Regular reads of AR aren&rsquo;t surprised in the least. Neither is the black community thought they feign shock and disbelief.</p>
<p>I wonder what it would really take to keep Mychal (sic) Bell out of trouble. Maybe he needs 24 hour care. The kind of 24 hour care he would get if he was sent to jail in the first place.</p>
<p>One reason the black community is in such a mess is that they refuse to admit that too many of their own people are born criminals. Instead of removing these criminals from their community as white people do, their criminals become &#8216;civil rights&rsquo; heroes and are let loose and emboldened to continue their life of crime.</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t this the poor victim of racism who sucker punched a lone white kid, then kicked him repeatedly, along with five other brave blacks, trying to kill him?</p>
<p>Obviously his attempt at suicide was due to the extreme guilt he felt over committing so many crimes over such a short period of time.</p>
<p>The news report doesn&rsquo;t say so, but it appears that the in-between-the-lines reporting is telling us that the suicide attempt was a half-hearted effort with no intention of making an actual attempt.</p>
<p>Just like the guy who said he tried to shoot himself to end it all, but he missed.</p>

		<p>The number of crimes committed by this guy are numerous, yet Sharpton wanted to make him the poster boy for unjust charges against blacks, going so far as to say he was innocent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to believe thousands of blacks were brazen enough to march on the area whining about injustices against blacks.</p>

David Bowie, who gave $10,000 of his money, said, &#8220;There is clearly a separate and unequal judicial process going on in the town of Jena.

		<p>The CNN newsarticle I read online today said that his mother claimed that he wasn&rsquo;t the one stealing clothing, his friend was - he was only trying to return an article of clothing and had a receipt.</p>
<p>This is a common ploy; take an article off the shelf and use an old receipt to get cash by asking to return it.  It never, hardly ever works.  When my wife worked at a Bed, Bath and Beyond in California, two Black women who were refused a return of items workers had seen them remove from store shelves, they became accused the workers of racism.  Then, they went into the restroom and smeared their feces on the walls.  No kidding.  In another case, a small clothing store owner in Vancouver, WA refused the same ploy.  The Black woman and her kids waited for her to leave the store and then physically attacked her in broad daylight while lots of cowardly White people watched.  Someone did use their cell phone to call the police - there was a Verizon store right next to the clothing store.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading the articles regarding this incident. The spin the media has been putting on this is unbelievable. I googled it and read the first 5 articles. Here are a couple of quotes from those first 5 articles. Just read them and you can see what we&rsquo;re dealing with&hellip;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would be very surprised if he was shoplifting,&#8221; Scott said. &#8220;I had seen him working out every day even though he knew he wasn&rsquo;t going to be able to play high school football.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Louis Scott who has represented Bell in the past said that preconceived notions on the part of Dillard&rsquo;s employees may have played a role in Bell&rsquo;s arrest. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Dillard&rsquo;s has a tradition of being overly suspicious of young black males,&rdquo; Scott said.</p>
<p><br>
Because he was a juvenile when he pleaded guilty to the previous crimes, Scott said Bell is not considered to have a criminal record.</p>
<p>Scott said he believed the arrest likely resulted from a misunderstanding.</p>

<p>&#8220;They found him on his bed, wounded in the chest. It was not clear Tuesday who owned the gun.&#8221;<br>

		<p> This was predicted by many when he evaded justice the first time. In truth though, I gain no satisfaction from his plight. The sad thing is how this hostility that so many black youths have is actually the product of leftist cryers teaching new generations how they&rsquo;ve been cheated by the white man and by fate etc&hellip;How much their OWED etc.. thus dissabling them from maximizing their potential in an environment far better than anything their own race ever afforded them. I think more white women are violently violated by black men in a single year then all the recorded suspect lynchings in all American history (correct me if wrong). </p>

		<p>An early report cited an accidental discharge of the weapon as he was cleaning it.  I found that a bit questionable, but now I find the claim of attempted suicide even more suspect.  Is this a cry for more attention by a &#8220;poor misunderstood black teenager&#8221; who most likely accidentally shot himself and puts a &#8220;woe is me&#8221; victim stamp on his idiocy?  Who knows.  &hellip;and to be honest and this point after the Jena 6 fiasco, who cares?  </p>

		<p>He&rsquo;s living in a foster home? I remember a video the media touted up showing Bell at home, ironing clothes while he talked about the problems he&rsquo;s had with racism. Very folksy touch interviewing him while he stood over an ironing board, which I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;d never done before. Now he&rsquo;s in foster care because his mother can&rsquo;t put up with his behaviour? (Bell&rsquo;s father lived out of state and came running to Jena to be with his son when the news media was all over the place, very concerned over the son he abandoned years earlier. One would think that all the money in donations Bell&rsquo;s mother recieved would have been sufficient to keep the little darling at home.</p>

		<p>Come on, liberal idiots.  I know there is a recession, but you still need to send money to these &#8220;troubled&#8221; youths, or they will end up shoplifting.  Open up those wallets.  You&rsquo;ll assuage your White guilt for a while.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that Mr. Bell possesses that much shame in order to do what they claim he did to himself. I think there is something more foul here that they&rsquo;re not telling us.</p>
<p>BTW, 18 years old and still living in foster care?</p>

<p>I think it is pretty obvious this was just a temper tantrum. Most likely he is getting too old for foster care and is panicking after squandering all of his ill gotten gains from his brief stint as the the most blameless and noble victim of white oppression.</p>
<p>The media seems to be conditioning white america to accept that you must overlook minor transgressions on the part of blacks, and ourtrying to hold them to account for their petty (and not so petty crimes) is just deplorable. If you get your head stomped by a gang of blacks then just ignore it, that is just their way of venting their frustration against an oppressive society  &mdash;  to charge them for such crimes would be the height of racism. </p>
<p>If one of those perps then steals from a store, then it is the height of racism for the store to arrest the poor shopper who was just ecomonically disadvantaged, and probably needed the clothes for job interviews and church and such. The store has lots of money anyway and to just force black people to pay for every little thing is just white greed.</p>

		<p>Interesting Note:  </p>
<p>I read this article on cnn.com when it first came out.  There was no mention of the shoplifting,resisting arrest, and assault charges.  The article said that he accidentally shot himself.  It gave no explanation why, but did spent the rest of the article recapping the Jena 6 case.  Great journalism.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Have you seen the articles blaming Dillards for &ldquo;racial profiling&rdquo; in this case&#8221;?</p>
<p>Dillards may end up being the shoplifters first choice for new apparel. They are so racist. I believe Old Navy was a frequent haunt of pilferers up till recently. They have been running a number of pro &#8216;diversity&rsquo; ads on TV the last several years however. A clothing store I worked at was burglarized. The suspect broke the glass and took a shirt displayed in the front window. There was some blood on the glass. He was caught. Pulled over in his car early in the morning. Apparently he hit a number of places during the night. We were almost never shoplifted from inside the store. Maybe because it was a small store.</p>

		<p>Compare the Jena article on wikipedia to Jared Taylor&rsquo;s article on the same.  The wikipedia uses various dirty tricks, such as minimizing the extent of injuries to the white victim.  </p>
<p>How even blacks, let alone whites, would dare to rally behind a group of young men who kicked and stomped a lone rival in the head as he cowered on the ground is incomprehensible to me, but maybe at age 30 I&rsquo;m old fashioned.</p>
<p>Whites&rsquo; near-universal sense of guilt for black failure is a bit discouraging sometimes.  Like it still is going to have to get a lot worse before people start to reconsider their beliefs.</p>

		<p>I think that since his lawyer is so supportive of this thug, HE should allow &#8220;Mr.&#8221; Bell into HIS home, to live with HIS family. What about it Mr. Scott, go ahead and let him move in and then go to work and leave him alone with your wife and kids. You and the wife go out to dinner and let him watch your house and kids while you&rsquo;re out. You and the kids go on a nice vacation and let him stay in your home alone to &#8220;watch over&#8221; things while you&rsquo;re gone. Show us all that you don&rsquo;t have any &#8220;preconceived notions of young black males.&#8221; Okay?</p>

<p>Paul,<br>
If you&rsquo;re talking about the Ruger .22-45 you&rsquo;re right! I have one which I rarely shoot because it&rsquo;s just two difficult to reassemble after cleaning.  I noticed recently that Ruger doesn&rsquo;t make that model any more. Give me a revolver any time.<br>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s a video of Mychal Bell giving an interview that must be seen to be believed. His english and diction are so poor it&rsquo;s almost impossible to understand him.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Bell, the only one of the six who has been tried, has been living in a foster home in Monroe and attending school.&rdquo; Let me guess, they omited the part &ldquo;He was an Honor Student and just getting his life back together after the abuse he suffered in 2006 after being falsely accused of beating a White youth&rdquo;</p>
<p>Posted by Bandmo at 7:20 PM on December 30&#8221;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget: &#8220;&hellip;.he was an aspiring rapper and planned to soon marry the mother of his child.&#8221;</p>
<p>It would be interesting to start a &#8220;Jena 6 Project&#8221;, following the six &#8220;youths&#8221; in question throughout their subsequent lives (and subsequent involvement with the criminal justice system).  I&rsquo;d be interested to see what became of them all in 20 or 30 years.</p>

		<p>For those readers who wonder where all the money donated by Celebs and assorted other idiots went, you&rsquo;ll be pleased to know that it went to a good cause.</p>
<p>If I remember correctly, one Jena 6 mom bought a Jaguar, and another bought a BMW.  </p>
<p>I was car-shopping at the time, and reading about those purchases definitely factored into my decision to go with Lexus.</p>
