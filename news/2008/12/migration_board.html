<h1>Migration Board &lsquo;Putting Pressure on Deportees&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The Local (Färögatan, Sweden), December 23, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Sweden&rsquo;s Migration Board has come under fire for allegedly pressuring candidates for deportation to sign agreements obliging them to leave the country rather than appeal their cases.</p>
<p>Around 1,000 people have signed so-called &#8220;satisfaction notices&#8221; so far this year, which is twice the figure for the whole of 2007, Sveriges Radio reports.</p>
<p>Morud Habied from Uzbekistan said his case coordinator at the board gave him no option but to sign.</p>
<p>&#8220;She said that even if I appealed their decision, the court would go down the same route,&#8221; he told Sveriges Radio.</p>
<p>Habied&rsquo;s legal representative, Mattias Skarerlius, said the pressure from the board to sign satisfaction notices had intensified during the autumn.</p>
<p>He said people who were told they could not stay in the country were informed &#8220;in a very aggressive manner that it is easier for the them go home on their own and there is simply no use in appealing&#8221;.</p>
<p>But the Migration Board&rsquo;s legal chief Mikael Ribbenvik insisted each individual was entitled to decide how to proceed with their case.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s no incentive to put pressure on anyone,&#8221; he told Sveriges Radio.<br>

		<p>  First off, let me say Happy New Year to all AmRen readers and contributors. Secondly, let us all pray that 2009 will be the year that whites around the world will begin to fight back and reclaim their countries from all the invading immigrants. Let&rsquo;s throw all the crooked politicians out on their collective butt. 2009 may be the last chance for the west to reclaim their birthrights.</p>

<p>Higher birth rates among Sweden&rsquo;s foreign-born   3 Nov 08 <br>

 <br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..&#8221;foreign-born women had a fertility rate of 2.21 children per woman, <br>
while Swedish-born women reproduced at a rate of 1.82 children per woman&#8221;.</p>
<p>I wonder how many of those liberal Swedish-born women are reproducing with (native)Swedish born men also? <br>
Whatever the number is, I bet it will only decrease over time.<br>
As Virtualous as it is to be color-blind among the left, you are still blind.<br>

		<p>On the subject of media, I caught two movie previews played on television today played in quick secession to each other on the same channel.<br>
1. &#8216;Doubt&rsquo; <br>
Basic plot through quick visuals: Heroic white woman (Meryl Streep), brings to justice evil child-molesting white man(Philip Seymour Hoffman) who abused young black boy(*who cares).<br>
*about name of course</p>
<p>2. &#8216;Seven pounds&rsquo;<br>
Basic plot through quick visuals: Smiling black man (Will Smith the scientologist) goes around and saves seven strangers &#8216;of all races&rsquo; with his amazingly generous gift of life through donating seven of his organs, and teaches us a wise lesson about living along the way.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know I should write reviews professionally.<br>
I won&rsquo;t bother with posting links to the trailers.</p>
<p>But seriousily, I often think to myself that I&rsquo;m taking this stuff too seriousily, and that&rsquo;s not much that I can do. Then I passively watch some television, or just read the news with an clear mind. <br>
And it doesn&rsquo;t take long to get angry(and perplexed) and back on board.</p>

You&rsquo;re so right.  It&rsquo;s truly amazing, when you open your eyes and really start to notice these things which most people just  passively take for granted.</p>
<p>The other day, I noticed a new variant of this.  A newspaper ad, or notice, for &#8220;A Conference for Board Directors only&#8221;, conducted by The Financial Times and the Columbia Business School, portrays the meeting of a hypothetical Board of Directors,  It shows a line of dignified, powerful persons representing all sexes and races. But (for those who know something about photography here), the camera lens was focused in such a way that it centered on just two individuals - a black man and a white woman (the man is very black) - who were shown in sharp focus, while the rest of the line was out of focus.   Yes, there were white men in this picture, admittedly, but they were a blurry fuzz, as if to imply that they were irrelevant, while the black male/white female were what unavoidably caught your eye.  It was very subtle, and somebody not knowledgeable about photography wouldn&rsquo;t even notice it or understand that this was a matter of selective focusing.   No accident!   The deviousness of such ads is amazing.</p>
<p>[This is in the &#8220;Financial Times&#8221;, Jan. 2, p.18,  which, I might also mention, features a picture of Obama on its cover page.]</p>
