			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Troy Graham, Philadelphia Inquirer, December 2, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In 2006, Besnik Bakalli was jailed on an immigration charge and facing deportation when the FBI asked him to help with an investigation.</p>
<p>At the behest of the agents, Bakalli befriended Dritan, Eljvir and Shain Duka, who, like him, spoke Albanian as their first language.</p>
<p>Bakalli said yesterday that the FBI agents did not tell him why they were interested in the Dukas.</p>
<p>But Bakalli said he started to piece it together during a fishing trip he took with the Dukas and their friend Mohamad Shnewer.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Eventually, Bakalli learned that the Dukas, Shnewer, and other foreign-born Muslim men were under investigation for plotting an attack on Fort Dix, inspired by radical Islamic dogma.</p>
<p>Bakalli, 31, from Albania, became one of two paid FBI informants to infiltrate the group. The other informant, Mahmoud Omar, befriended Shnewer, a fellow Arabic speaker.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bakalli, also an illegal immigrant, said he agreed to help the FBI because &#8220;I was hoping I would stay here.&#8221; Prosecutors have acknowledged that Bakalli and his family will receive consideration in their immigration cases.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can have a better life here,&#8221; Bakalli said yesterday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He said all that the Dukas ever talked about was &#8220;Islam, jihad, war, guns.&#8221; Prosecutors played several hours of those conversations for jurors yesterday.</p>
<p>On the tapes, the men repeatedly discussed what they perceived as the oppression of Muslims around the globe &mdash; in Bosnia, Chechnya, Kashmir, the Palestinian territories and other locations. They talked about their own duties as Muslims to wage jihad and help their &#8220;brothers.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Prosecutors said the five defendants were planning to use a pizza-delivery pass to get on the base and open fire. Dritan and Shain Duka were arrested while trying to buy seven rifles from Omar, the informant.</p>
<p>The Dukas, Shnewer and Serdar Tatar have been jailed since their coordinated arrests in May 2007. They face life in prison if convicted of plotting to kill U.S. soldiers.</p>

		<p>Most Muslims are the same anywhere. Low IQ brown people who don&rsquo;t know how to improve their life through hard work and smarts. Backwards, primitive, superstitious, and illiterate. Therefore they have to blame anyone else, sound familiar? So they resort to violence and civilian killings to air out their dissatisfaction. Ban muslims from the West! Don&rsquo;t care if you are good or bad, we shouldn&rsquo;t be taking the chances with muslims.</p>

		<p>The whites and Britans, who are not oppressing Muslims, are the ones that they&rsquo;re out to kill. </p>
<p>Those targeted to be killed are not in &#8220;Bosnia, Chechnya, Kashmire, and Palestinian territories&#8221; in any significant numbers to affect Muslims. </p>
<p>These killers are young puppets who are too scared to think for themselves with nothing better to do.</p>

		<p>     We need more of these people in this country. Let&rsquo;s take the next boatload and send them to the Kennedy Compound or the Crawford Ranch. When does the revolution start ?</p>

		<p>Life in prison?  Send them to be tried in an Iraqi court.  They actually hang terrorists in that country.  </p>

<p>A guy that was in the military over in Iraq or Saudi Arabia, years before the whole 9/11 debacle, told me of a public killing that he witnessed at a football field. The person killed was on his knees with a bag over his head and shot in the back of the head. trial or no trial? I&rsquo;d think No in this instance. </p>
<p>Skip:</p>
<p>Maybe you can enlighten me with some knowledge or experience of this in these regions of the world. I&rsquo;ve read a lot on Islam. I might go back to graduate school to study more. College is so swayed; personal experience holds more weight. Thanks  </p>
