<h1>Latinos&rsquo; Deaths Prompt Calls for Hate Crimes Law</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, December 17, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Lawmakers and Hispanic groups on Tuesday denounced the beating death of an Ecuadorean immigrant, saying his and other recent slayings of Latino immigrants lend new urgency to the need for a federal hate crimes law.</p>
<p>During a news conference, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., named three immigrants he said were killed &#8220;simply because of who they were.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Latino leaders said considering what appeared to be rising anti-Latino sentiment, Congress should pass legislation to expand the federal hate crimes law. The bill, known as the Matthew Shepard Act, would add protections for bias crimes motivated by gender, sexual orientation and disabilities, and expand Justice Department&rsquo;s investigative powers.</p>
<p>Current law limits federal investigation of hate crimes to when a federally protected activity is occurring, such as voting. But that restriction would be lifted under the proposal.</p>
<p>The bill also would give local officials resources to investigate hate crimes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We have seen that a culture of fear, hate and xenophobia, ultimately leads to a crime of violence,&#8221; said Schumer, who helped sponsor the law that required the government to keep hate crime statistics.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the most important things the hate crimes bill would do would be to bring out the power of the Department of Justice to this effort. Currently most of these crimes are treated as local crimes,&#8221; Trasvina [John Trasvina, chairman of the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda] said.</p>
<p>Schumer said he would join Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., to push for passage of the bill in the next Congress. President-elect Barack Obama also is likely to support passage of the bill.<br>

		<p>Hispanics do not help their cause when they march by the tens of thousands in the streets screaming as loud as they can that they have a God given right to break any and all of our laws regarding immigration,while in their home countries they enforce their own laws against illegals in their own countries.Hispanic on white violent crime happens, I personally know of a few cases of it.</p>

		<p>Most Hispanics are killed by other Hispanics. Yet when they do it, it&rsquo;s counted as a White on Hispanic crime because of the insane manner in which crime statistics are collected. Hispanic criminals are counted as White, but Hispanic victims are counted as Hispanic. </p>

<p>That does not sound like equal justice to me, but that is where we are heading.<br>

		<p>Right, a rare white on hispanic crime is a national outrage, but Hispanic groups (getting big money backings, I might add) advocating taking by the southwest and having hispanic gangs plague our cities and towns is certainly not that big of a threat.</p>

		<p>I would like for once in my life to see American politicans like Shumer get as worked up about the death of an American citizen at the hands of an illegal as they do about the death of an immigrant at the hands of an American. Of course it&rsquo;s &#8220;racist&#8221; though to complain about illegals killing American citizens.</p>

		<p>Once again, the small group of Whites who are largely responsible for the demise of the USA, are offering misleading facts based on faulty logic.</p>
<p>Instead of &#8220;Latins are victimized based on race&#8221;, the truth is that many Latinos are in the USA illegally and commit far more interracial/interethnic crimes than Whites, according to the FBI&rsquo;s UCR.</p>
<p>Instead of &#8220;AIDS victimizes Blacks&#8221;, the truth is that Blacks behave irresponsibly and carelessly, despite the fact that Whites continuously attempt to intervene and educate them to correct their sexual behaviors and avoid STDs.</p>
<p>Instead of &#8220;Blacks and Hispanics are at a disadvantage in schools because of racist teachers, administrators, and peers,&#8221; the truth is that Blacks and Hispanics have lower intelligence are unable to conform to the standards of a civilized, White society, even when the standards are greatly lowered.</p>
<p>Instead of &#8220;Blacks were economically targeted for sub-prime loans as a function of their race,&#8221; the truth is that government bureaucrats forced lending institutions to loan money to irresponsible people (namely Blacks and Hispanics) who were unworthy of credit.</p>
<p>Instead of &#8220;the USA is the greatest country of all time and it will get through this financial, moral, and social crisis,&#8221; the truth is that undesirables have passed the point of critical mass in the nation, which is increasingly morphing into a third-world sewer with each passing day. It now reflects the homelands of Blacks, Latinos, and people from other uncivilized places around the world that no sane person would chose to live.</p>
<p>The truth is neither pleasant nor unpleasant. It is simply factual.</p>

		<p>This Ecuadorian immigrant, Jose O. Sucuzhanay, was viciously attacked and beaten to death with a baseball bat in Brooklyn NY by 4 black strangers who had piled out of a passing car screaming racial slurs:</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll notice that almost all news accounts censor the race of the attackers in this case.<br>
However just a few weeks before when another Ecuadorian immigrant was attacked and murdered in Long Island NY the news media immediately LIED and LOUDLY characterized the attackers as a gang of &#8220;white youths&#8221;. The media continues this lie. The gang included a black and two Hispanics, as well as whites. The media has even gone so far in that case to crop the photo showing the suspects in such a way to cut out the view of the black.<br>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;rising anti-Latino sentiment&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>First, explain this to me - what(or who)exactly is a &#8220;Latino?&#8221; This is how the Left always operates. Create impossibly broad, euphamistic definitions, categories, etc., into which they can neatly fit virtually anyone as it becomes convenient or expedient to do so. &#8220;Latino,&#8221; at this point could mean almost ANYONE who hails from either a Spanish-speaking nation, and/or from Central and South America, which covers an astonishingly broad range of enthicities and racial-types. Thus, the fully Caucasian Argentine or the Afro-Dominican, or the dark-skinned Mezo-Indian can all fit into the &#8220;Latino&#8221; category, depending upon who wishes to place them there. </p>
<p>&#8220;Anti-Latino&#8221; sentiment indeed&hellip;hogwash!!</p>

<p>Shumer must live in a sick, twisted, Quisling reality if he believes he can accurately define our culture as one of &#8220;fear, hate and xenophobia&#8221;.  There is nothing &#8220;unknown&#8221; about the agenda of these invading Hispanics.  One does not &#8220;fear&#8221; those that aren&rsquo;t man enough to repair their own failed states.  And most people do not love alien invaders and if that means we &#8220;hate&#8221; them then so be it.<br>

<p>Diversity = Division, and we are now the Divided States of America thanks to decades of traitors in the White House!  </p>
<p>The more divided we become, the worse things will get.  The more Third World poverty we import, the sooner we&rsquo;ll become a Third World nation.  It&rsquo;s all quickly coming to a head.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Internet, we&rsquo;re learning that our so-called &#8220;representatives&#8221; in the White House stopped representing we the people a long time ago.  We no longer have American patriots taking care of America.  We have open-border, free-trading, globalist traitors taking care of their bottom line at the expense of America!</p>

		<p>Typical of the MSM to blast an immigrant-as-victim story  &mdash;  were any White families of immigrant-based crime comforted by the governor?  </p>
<p>For those who still rely on the MSM (what Brimlowe calls Dead Tree-Based Journalism) as their main news source (Why, I ask), there&rsquo;s this hopeful sign from the New York Daily News:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Sucuzhanay&hellip;was badly bludgeoned by three black men who shouted anti-gay and anti-Hispanic slurs, witnesses said&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2008/12/18/2008-12-18_gov_paterson_visits_family_of_hate_crime.html</p>
<p>For me, the MSM is beyond redemption  &mdash;  I refuse to support an institution that either covers up or will not report black-on- White or immigrant-on-White crime and, in fact blares immigrant sob stories daily on the front pages (especially here in LA).  Why would any White support (let alone pay for) &#8216;news&rsquo; stories that are openly hostile towards Whites and favor immigrants over US citizens?</p>
<p>The Internet is putting the MSM out of business and although business failures are generally not good news, I am happy to see the demise of &#8216;news sources&rsquo; that have done everything in its power to spread, anti-White, false Marxist lies to the masses via highly biased one-sided reporting.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one more good sign of a return to sanity (From an AOL report on &#8216;Companies that will Disappear in 2009.&rsquo;):</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The New York Times has to repay $400 million in debt in the first half of 2009. It plans to mortgage its headquarters, but what that will bring in an uncertain real estate market is unknown. The firm&rsquo;s &#8216;Boston Globe&rsquo; and regional newspaper operations lose money, so they will be hard to sell&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Again let it be stated that the Internet is the most important (White) invention since the printing press, it must be kept free and open at all costs to do the job the MSM refuse to do.</p>

		<p>Consider what is happening in California&hellip;</p>
<p>- minorities are far beyond critical mass<br>
- many Whites have sold and moved to other states<br>
- property values in CA have plummeted<br>
- we have read reports of Black-run hospitals completely failing due to incompetent admin and &#8220;health care&#8221;<br>
- we have read reports of social and educational services strained far past the limit<br>
- we have read reports of growing debt<br>
- we have read reports of LaRaza bearing down<br>
- non-Hispanic Whites in California are no longer the majority<br>
- California is facing a $42B budget deficit <br>
- Schwarzenegger is forcing all state employees to take two unpaid holidays each month until at least June of 2010, representing an immediate 10 percent reduction in their pay (meanwhile, the US Congress voted itself a healthy pay raise yesterday)<br>
- Schwarzenegger ordered $3.8B of public works projects to stop</p>
<p>Consider where this is leading for California. The most capable state-employed Whites will assuredly move to states that pay full salaries. The Whites who are unable to move will become disgruntled and resentful and perform lower quality work as self-compensation the pay reductions. Services will systematically degrade. Consequently more Whites will move away in the years ahead. More undesirables will move in. The cycle will repeat. California&rsquo;s budget problems will grow far worse. California will ultimately become *exactly* like Mexico; a place where no White person would want to live in. </p>
<p>The same thing is happening at many select places around the USA; Detroit, New York City, Chicago. Did you see the sky-high taxes New York is implementing on everything? Do you think the most capable Whites will willingly stay and tolerate that or move away?</p>
<p>Anyone who thinks the nation&rsquo;s problems will improve in the future is sadly mistaken.</p>
<p>Does anyone expect Africa, Mexico, the Afro-Caribbean countries, or Muslim countries to improve and become desirable places to live? No? Well, guess what happens to the USA when the people who live in those countries, and make them the third-world places that they are, come here to live. There is a reason they are called &#8220;undesirables&#8221;.</p>
<p>Whites need to stop pretending, face the truth, and act to protect our future.</p>

		<p>Murder is already illegal in every state of the Union.  So just how would a &#8220;hate law&#8221; have prevented a crime that laws agaist murder could not?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a safe bet that any time A kills B it&rsquo;s because A hates B.  The purpose of &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; laws is to make certain types of hate more special than others.<br>

		<p>This kind of anti-white bias in the name of &#8220;multi-culturalism&#8221; and &#8220;diversity&#8221; has become, in effect, the state religion. People are, and have been for decades, innundated by propaganda driven to this end.</p>
<p>My question is: what do we do about it? So far it looks unlikely that America will be able to save itself from this massive cult that has taken over the minds of millions.  </p>
<p>As an example of how far out of hand OUR government has gotten, consider this little example of constitutional disregard:<br>
The new president elect has thus far refused to actually release his birth certificate or university records. In fact, he has hired THREE law firms to ensure that the birth certificate is not opened.</p>
<p>Citizen attorney Phillip Berg&rsquo;s law suit was dismissed by the supreme court because, they said, Mr. Berg &#8220;lacked the standing to present the case&#8221;.</p>
<p>Imagine a government &#8220;of the people, by the people, for the people&#8221; denying a case over a fundamental constitutional issue because it was only brought by a citizem!</p>

<p>Good idea. Make laws that punish whites even more than they do now for the rare instance that a white actually does commit a hatecrime. That should keep blacks from targeting and killing latinos. </p>
<p><br>
During a news conference, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., named three immigrants he said were killed &ldquo;simply because of who they were.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Chunky Shumer can name three latinos who were recently murdered? I wonder if he knows who Channon or Chris are?</p>

		<p>Why are Schumer and Kennedy conspiring to enact a &ldquo;hate law&rdquo; to punish white people?  What is their goal?</p>
<p>Their goal is to destroy the American middle class, most effectively through the destruction of the institution of the family.  Examine every law proposed and every deed these two have done.  One thing is common; the effect is to impoverishment the American middle class.  High taxes, destruction of savings through Central Bank inflation, banning guns, forcing women to work outside the home and laws weakening patriarchy, increasing the expense of staples such as cars, fuel, and food, forced integration to end affordable education and housing in safe neighborhoods. </p>
<p>The wealthy elites and the non-productive poor do not suffer.   Schumer and Kennedy are both Bolsheviks, both hate Christian America.  Some American Renaissance people don&rsquo;t see that Christianity is the sine qua non for a Middle Class.  It allows men and women to work hard and enjoy their family, children and grand children with hope for eternal happiness.  It gives meaning to life.</p>
<p>Christians aren&rsquo;t Woody Allen zombies going though a maze of psychological cures for their angst, anxiety, and dread of nothingness that lies at the core of one&rsquo;s being.   They avoid the searching for and finding their true self and avoid the years of therapy promising self fulfillment and self actualizing.  Also their productive hours aren&rsquo;t taken up with dreams about end of the rainbow sexual satisfaction obtainable only after years of psychoanalysis.</p>
<p>These two want to turn America into the Soviet Union of 1920&rsquo;s.   If you don&rsquo;t think this is so, find me one thing that they want for America that Lenin would oppose. </p>
<p>A good example of how alike to Lenin they are is the phony war on terror.  Both Schumer and Kennedy made token objections to Bush&rsquo;s invasion in the Middle East.   Now they are safely on board with America&rsquo;s battle to democratize the world.  A war that mirrors Lenin&rsquo;s goal of world wide Communism.</p>
<p>A real defense against terrorists would demand that the borders of America be secured.  <br>
The last thing in the world that these two want.<br>

		<p>Since more law-abiding legal Americans have been murdered by illegal aliens than the number of American military in Iraq, when will those crimes be newspaper headlines? Any bets?</p>

		<p>&#8220;So far it looks unlikely that America will be able to save itself from this massive cult that has taken over the minds of millions&#8221;.</p>
<p>Some people have said that was an underlying theme of the 50&rsquo;s movie &#8216;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&rsquo;. People minds were being taken over. They looked the same, but thought differently. That Kevin McCarthy, the actor in the movie, stood for Sen Joe McCarthy, warning America, trying to warn America, their minds were being taken over. Regardless, it&rsquo;s a very, very scary movie, even to this day. One of those movies where the hero, or the local kids, know there is some kind of danger to the town or to everyone, but they can&rsquo;t convince everyone else of the danger. The re-make of the movie made in the 80&rsquo;s was good too. I watched a re-make that was done just a few years ago tho and it low budget and pretty bad. </p>

		<p>A couple years ago Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa researched how many Americans die annually at the hands of Hispanic illegal aliens:</p>
<p>Twelve Americans are murdered every day by illegal aliens and it translates to 4,380 Americans murdered annually by illegal aliens.</p>
<p>While King reports 12 Americans are murdered daily by illegal aliens, he says 13 are killed daily by drunken Hispanic illegal alien drivers for another annual death toll of 4,745.  This doesn&rsquo;t take into account the tens of thousands of American men, women and children they maim, cripple and burn.  </p>
<p>Not one Iraqi or Afghani has murdered or killed a single American on American soil, yet Washington invaded and occupied their countries.  Over nine thousand American men, women and children die annually on American soil at the hands of invading and occupying Hispanic illegal aliens and Washington does nothing.</p>
<p>Let these facts sink in real good and share them with everyone you know.  The White House and the congress is the fifth-column holding the gates of America open to these colonizing illegal Hispanic invaders.  Washington intends for them to displace us, because groveling, uneducated, unsophisticated, illiterate, and dependant Hispanics (mostly Mexicans) are much easier to govern than the white descendants of the Minutemen.  </p>
<p>Contemporary Washington is the greatest enemy this nation has faced since its inception and it is our task to deal with it.  Like it or not boys and girls it is our turn to make Thomas Jefferson and his friends proud&hellip;          <br>

		<p>The perpetrator(s) is/are most likely other non-whites or else good time Charlie would have mounted his hobby horse to lecture the world on how white racism must be checked by draconian legislation.  Notice how when a violent crime is non-white on non-white only the race of the victim is reported leaving naive observers to conclude the perp must be a white racist.  </p>
<p>The few times whites are guilty their mug shots are widely circulated in all newspapers and nightly news segments. Not so, when blacks and other non-whites behave badly.  Also, hate crime legislation is arguably unconstitutional and is not warranted based solely upon this case.  If senate republicans were doing their jobs they would sternly rebuke Chucky over his comments.  </p>

		<p>No, people being angry about Latinos doesn&rsquo;t call for Hate Crime Laws, what it calls for is promptly deporting people who sneaked across a border to get here and don&rsquo;t belong here.  Not only will Government fail to do this, but they&rsquo;ll give them the right to vote in our elections and then penalize people who object to it.</p>
<p>A sixty year old White person living in this country could potentially lose everything in his or her bank account if he or she ever has a major medical emergency.  Meanwhile one of these illegal immigrants can walk into a hospital and get everything for nothing, and call me a gringo on the way out.  And guess who&rsquo;s paying for it?  That same sixty year old person.  <br>
  <br>
Obviously it&rsquo;s not our Government anymore.  The only question is how long will it take all of us to get up to speed, and whether there will be enough of us left to fix the mess by the time we do.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;California is facing a $42B budget deficit&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Excellent post 3:53 PM.</p>
<p>What is never mentioned in Sacramento is the cost to California taxpayers (well, the ones that are left, that is) of illegal immigrants and their anchor children. Rep. Tom McClintock estimates a low-ball figure of 10 billion a year.</p>
<p>But, even more infuriating that than, is the Socialists&rsquo; leaders proposal of $9.3 billion in tax increases – including an income tax surcharge, an oil severance tax and a huge &#8220;fee&#8221; on gasoline – and insisting that the increases were &#8216;revenue neutral&rsquo; and required simple majority votes, rather than the two-thirds votes specified by the state constitution.</p>
<p>In an effort to skirt the state constitution, over-ride anti-tax Republicans, and especially the tenants of Prop 13, the socialists attempted to raise 9.3 billion in taxes by calling obvious taxes &#8216;fees&rsquo; and &#8216;levies.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The response from the governor? The one sworn to uphold the Constitution and Laws of the state of California?</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.the governor did not voice objection to the strategy. &#8216;I don&rsquo;t get into those kinds of debates (over vote requirements and the difference between taxes and fees),&rsquo; he said&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>http://www.caltax.org/CaltaxReports/2008/121908_democrats_pass_huge_tax_increase.htm</p>
<p>Is it any wonder White taxpayers, entrepreneurs and businesses are fleeing the state?</p>
<p>Where is Howard Jarvis when we need him? (although at this point, I strongly believe California is past the point of no return  &mdash;  would the last productive Californian turn off the electrical grid please).</p>

		<p>Why should America be responsible for Mexico&rsquo;s surplus population or its poverty? This is OUR country. Time to get tough and DRIVE the invaders out! We have the Army, the National Guard, and the WILL of the American people. We can deputize civilian volunteer groups like the Minutemen of a few years ago. Provide training and place the groups under command of regular army officers and start rounding up these illegals. Meeting force with force, should that be a requirement!</p>

		<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help but notice that while white people are often killed simply for being white, Chuck Schumer elected to remain silent on this issue for years.</p>
<p>The law, if enacted will simply be a feel-good piece of fluff, enabling legislators to congratulate themselves on how morally superior they are to us lumpenproletariat, but the sort of goons who would beat a complete stranger to death and possibly face capital punishment for the crime will not care one iota whether a &#8220;hate crime&#8221; enhancement is added to their prosecution.</p>

		<p>Actually, some articles began to almost immediately mention the race of the suspects, but this is a departure from the usual &#8220;if they&rsquo;re black, make no mention of the race&#8221; attitude of the media.<br>
****************<br>
&#8220;Sucuzhañay was walking arm and arm with his brother Romel Sunday morning near their home on Kossuth Place, officials said.</p>
<p>An SUV drove past packed with thugs. One passenger yelled anti-gay remarks, officials said. The driver yelled, &#8220;f-ing Spanish,&#8221; said a police source.</p>
<p>The men in the SUV, described as African-American, then chased the pair. One clubbed Romel with a beer bottle while the others beat Jose with a bat. &#8220;</p>

<p>*****************<br>
Guess this story was too big to ignore the details.  One has to question-if the victims had been white, would it have gotten anywhere near the media attention this has garnered?  I doubt it.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Growing Anti-Latino Sentiment requires Federal Action&#8221;</p>
<p>As Mr. Taylor points out, ethnic interest groups will use the law against anyone who they feel threatens the invasion. That may not be in the intention of the average illegal alien, but it is most certainly the intention of the LA RAZA&rsquo;S,LULAC&rsquo;S, and MALDEF&rsquo;S,etc., who are allowed to use them against the citizenry. Thus, we see the slow, corrosive, slide, into a Soviet Communist type state. Everyone, regardless of their heritage, interests, etc. must be a comrade to everyone else  &mdash;  OR ELSE!!!</p>
