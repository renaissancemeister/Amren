<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Nov. 4 crash of a Learjet in an upper-class Mexico City neighborhood caused a disproportionate amount of destruction. All eight passengers were killed &mdash; including Interior Minister Juan Camilo Mouriño, President Felipe Calderón&rsquo;s right-hand man, and José Luis Santiago Vasconcelos, a leading prosecutor against the powerful drug cartels; seven people on the ground died, too.</p>
<p>snip} Still, says Larry N. Holifield, former head of the Mexico City office of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, &#8220;people won&rsquo;t believe it was an accident. They think everything down there is a conspiracy because half the time it really is.&#8221; One witness to the crash believes the worst. &#8220;A plane just doesn&rsquo;t fall out of the sky,&#8221; says Guadalupe Rodríguez, 42, a law firm assistant. &#8220;The narcos are saying, &lsquo;Here we are &mdash; and nobody&rsquo;s going to get rid of us.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>You can forgive Rodríguez for thinking so. This year, through mid-November, there have been 4,300-plus drug-related deaths in Mexico, compared with 2,500 in 2007. Edgar Millán Gómez, who oversaw the joint efforts of the army and federal police, was assassinated in May in his home in Mexico City. Roberto Velasco Bravo, a federal chief of criminal investigations, was shot in the head a week earlier. The narcotraficantes have infiltrated the highest levels of law enforcement, including, allegedly, Mexico&rsquo;s principal link to Interpol and its former senior drug czar. Mexico, once again, is battling the ever powerful gangs. &#8220;It has been a fierce bloodbath,&#8221; says Felipe González González, president of the Senate public security commission and former governor of the central state of Aguascalientes. &#8220;We have more dead than you have in Iraq.&#8221;</p>
<p>Is Mexico descending into criminal and economic chaos? &#8220;Failed state? That is a very irresponsible remark,&#8221; bristles Arturo Sarukhan, Mexico&rsquo;s ambassador to the U.S. &#8220;The challenge of corruption is being taken on. We are rooting out people who have been infiltrated. Look at the role of the Mexican private sector and civil society. Nowhere can you see signs of anything akin to a failed state.&#8221;</p>
<p>But there is urgent concern north of the border about a potential strategic threat. &#8220;We&rsquo;re fixated on Iraq and Afghanistan, but from a homeland security perspective, right here on our border, isn&rsquo;t this more important?&#8221; asks Fred Burton, a former State Department counterterrorism official, now a vice president at Stratfor in Austin, Tex.</p>
<p>Washington, D.C. is fretting, too. &#8220;The consequences for both our countries in the near future and the not-so-near future could not be greater,&#8221; says John Walters, director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, a.k.a. the drug czar. &#8220;The consequences if President Calderón fails and the institutions of government, at least in the northern part of his country, become controlled by terrorist mafias &mdash; well, we worry about ungoverned spaces far away from the U.S., and this is right next door.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} After expanding by 3.2% in 2007 to $900 billion, Mexico&rsquo;s GDP growth will slow to 1.5% this year and tumble to somewhere between zero and 0.7% in 2009, predicts Raúl Feliz, an economist at CIDE, a Mexico City think tank that specializes in economics and politics. While some of that meager expansion will come from government stimulus spending, its hands are tightly tied because state-owned oil monopoly Pemex (Petróleos Mexicanos) contributes 37% &mdash; $80 billion in 2008 &mdash; of federal revenue. Next year analysts expect a plunge in petrodollars. Unemployment will jump from its current 4.1%. Throw in part-time workers, who account for roughly one-third of GDP, and the jobless figure soars to 10%. Feliz expects that number to reach 12% next year.</p>
<p>Credit-rating agencies are taking notice. In November Fitch put Mexican government foreign and local currency debt on &#8220;negative outlook&#8221; (though the ratings are still investment grade). It said that Mexico&rsquo;s ability to absorb global shocks was limited.</p>
<p>To say nothing of internal shocks. Eighty percent of Mexican exports &mdash; $240 billion this year, up 10% from 2007 &mdash; go to the U.S., where shoppers aren&rsquo;t spending. {snip}</p>
<p>Drug-related violence pervades all segments of life in Mexico. &#8220;The cartels have an extraordinary capacity for corrupting and intimidating,&#8221; says U.S. Ambassador Garza. The drug lords operate through most of the country (see map). In Ciudad Juárez the body count is 1,100 this year &mdash; 200 or more of those deaths in August.</p>
<p>The cartels are also taking a big toll on business. &#8220;U.S. companies are worried about the safety of their workers,&#8221; says Maria Luisa O&rsquo;Connell, president of the Border Trade Alliance in Phoenix, Ariz. &#8220;Drugs have become such a big problem.&#8221; As they have for the business community throughout Mexico. As a result of many high-profile kidnappings and murders, one of the most vibrant businesses in the nation is security &mdash; bodyguards and armored vehicles. An executive can shell out as much as $500,000 a year to protect himself and his family, reports Stratfor.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On the economic front Mexicans like to point out how they are in better shape to weather tough times than they were 14 years ago, when the U.S. and others had to intervene to save the peso. Some of that is true. The federal deficit is down to 0.2% of GDP. Short-term interest rates on government debt, while still high, are 8.3%; inflation is at a manageable 5.8%. Solid companies like Wal-Mart de México (68% owned by the Bentonville, Ark. giant) and América Móvil, the wireless services provider, are still forging ahead with precrisis capital expenditures. There&rsquo;s still hiring going on at the factories in Guadalajara, Chihuahua and Reynosa operated by contract manufacturer Jabil Circuit. PepsiCo recently decided to spend up to $3 billion to expand its snack and drink business.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But these investments hardly make a dent in Mexico&rsquo;s economy. There is plenty of grim news to darken the bright spots. The three leading sectors of the economy &mdash; services, industrial and agriculture &mdash; are slowing; manufacturing is expected to contract next year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Default rates will rise in a degrading economy. Already there are bleak signs in the $85-billion-a-year auto industry. While Toyota North America insists it&rsquo;s sticking to its schedule next year, Ford of Mexico says it will &#8220;adjust our plans accordingly.&#8221; Nissan Mexicana recently halted production for six days at its Aguascalientes plant and canceled a planned third shift in Civac. General Motors has cut 660 of its 13,000 workers, discontinued its line of GMC Kodiak medium-duty trucks in Toluca and slowed production of SUVs and pickups in Guanajuato. &#8220;Everyone is worried about the future,&#8221; says a spokesman. Chrysler Mexico laid off 400 of 6,000 people in October and is culling 20% of its 1,200 white-collar employees. Delphi has 55,000 workers at 48 Mexican plants, down from 65,000 at 54 factories two years ago. The auto parts maker is asking some employees to take a voluntary reduced workweek at 50% pay.</p>
<p>On the other side of the border look for a large drop in remittances from Mexicans living in the U.S. For 2008 they will be down roughly 10% to $21.6 billion. In 2009, predicts Roberto Newell, chief executive of the Mexican Institute of Competitiveness, total remittances may be off by as much as 25% from last year. Of the 11 million Mexicans in the U.S., 60% of them send money home. Perhaps as many as 150,000 will be unemployed by June, says Manuel Orozco, an analyst at the Inter-American Dialogue in Washington. Many more have already been forced out of high-paying construction jobs into jobs paying a lot less. After interviewing migrants, Orozco concludes that 3% to 7% of them will go home next year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It may be a lot harder to forget next year, when some government subsidies disappear. Hit by the double whammy of sinking oil prices and lower production, Pemex&rsquo;s contribution to state coffers could drop 20% or more to $65 billion in 2009. This despite only $18-per-barrel production costs, a $22 discount on today&rsquo;s spot price in Mexico.</p>
<p>Pemex is in sorry shape. From a peak of 3.3 million barrels a day in 2004, output is down to 2.8 million barrels. Unless someone figures out how to halt the decline, Mexico may become a net oil importer by 2015, says Allyson Benton, analyst at Eurasia Group, a political-risk consultancy in Manhattan. Pemex vigorously contests the prediction.</p>
<p>The problem isn&rsquo;t a lack of resources. Exploration and production chief Carlos Morales Gil says Pemex has 14 billion barrels of proved reserves, 30 billion barrels of probable and possible oil and another 54 billion barrels yet to be found. The culprit is Mexico&rsquo;s constitution, which stipulates that all oil and gas reserves are the sole property of the people of Mexico. That bars Pemex from selling stakes in oilfields to foreign companies &mdash; depriving Mexico of the risk capital and the talent that Western oil companies are instead sending to colder climates and deeper waters.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A new law passed by the legislature will help to a degree. While the wording of new contracts must still be painstakingly matched to the constitution, the reforms permit Pemex to develop the technology of foreign oil services companies &mdash; finally opening Mexico to deepwater exploration of the Gulf &mdash; and to pay them incentives based on Pemex&rsquo;s success. Morales Gil can envision a nonequity partnership to produce Mexico&rsquo;s oil via platforms on the U.S. side of the maritime border, where Royal Dutch Shell, bp and Chevron are installing an estimated $6.7 billion spar platform that will be linked to fields as far as 10,000 feet below sea level. &#8220;Perhaps in these reservoirs it makes sense to get together with the other guys and plan a joint investment,&#8221; he muses, but &#8220;keep the reserves separate.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But what foreign investor would be eager to buy that debt when the Mexican public markets themselves are pretty spooked these days? &#8220;People don&rsquo;t want to put their surnames on a share listing,&#8221; Mexican stock exchange president, Guillermo Prieto, recently said. &#8220;At least six or seven companies have said crime is a reason [for not floating an issue].&#8221; {snip} On Nov. 3 there were 58 drug-related deaths, including four men burned to death in the beach town of Sinaloa de Leyva. On that same day surgeons in a Ciudad Juárez hospital were ordered out of an operating room as hooded men executed a patient who had shown up with a gunshot wound. With so little faith in his own men, Juárez&rsquo;s mayor fired 400 police officers for failing lie detectors and other tests to root out corruption and started to recruit federal troops to the force.</p>
<p>Chronic fear of kidnapping, or worse, is driving more and more Mexicans north to the U.S. {snip}.</p>
<p>The narcotraficantes have found opportunity in the U.S., too. If the late Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar had Miami, then Joaquín Guzmán has Atlanta, which has become the East Coast distribution center of cocaine and other drugs for the Mexican cartels. Atlanta&rsquo;s accessibility to key interstates like I-95 and I-85 make it a perfect hub for moving cocaine and marijuana and taking bulk cash back to Mexico. Atlanta&rsquo;s fast-growing Mexican population, lured largely by the region&rsquo;s building boom, has provided excellent cover and resources for the cartel&rsquo;s U.S. emissaries.</p>
<p>Northwestern Georgia is dotted with drug warehouses and money-counting houses, often set up in empty suburban homes furnished with a few tables and laptops. From there cocaine is moved to New York, Pittsburgh, Washington, D.C., Miami and Chicago. The cash can be counted and inserted within 24 hours in sophisticated hydraulic traps built into tractor trailers for the trip to Texas and the southwestern border. No need for cages or safes &mdash; the cash at the money-counting houses is kept in closets, and one Gulf cartel moneyman made it clear that the lives of families in Mexico of anyone messing with the efficiency of his money-moving operation were at stake. {snip}</p>
<p>The Gulf cartel has dug its claws into the Atlanta area, as shown by a federal indictment in September of 34 of its members who authorities say were organized into distribution and transportation cells. The feds say the leader, 20-year-old Edgar Rodríguez-Alejandro, was taking orders from the highest levels of the Gulf cartel in Mexico until he was arrested in May with 12 kilos of cocaine and $7.7 million, a slim fraction of the 16,000 kilos of cocaine and 116 weapons recently seized in the U.S. Two cells of Shorty Guzmán&rsquo;s cartel in Atlanta were tracked and 20 indicted in December 2007.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see how it is possible for only 11 million Mexicans to send 21 billion to Mexico in one year.  That comes to about 1 billion 900 million dollars sent to Mexico by every Mexican in the United states.</p>
<p>Either they are a lot richer than is commonly supposed or there are a lot more of them than 11 million.  Maybe 100 million.  </p>
<p>And just think.  That money is their salaries.  And us whites get to pay for their government housing, schooling, day care, WIC coupons, free school and daycare breakfast, lunch and snack, welfare, incarceration, drunk driving victims and insurance payments, and all the other costs assoicated with the population of Mexico in America.</p>

<p>The situation was even worse 100 years ago.  That Civil war or bandito anarchy whatever it was called started the first influx of the Mexican invasion of the United States.  Things simmered down for a while but Mexico has never been a civilized country since the Spanish left.  Just one dictator, civil war, economic problems, exploitation and other mess after another.</p>
<p>Some of the Indian tribes in remote areas were still at war with the Mexican government as late as 1900. </p>

<p>It is within the realm of possibility that we might one day  wake up and learn that a coup has taken place in Mexico. It will be orchestrated and controlled by the drug cartels, and although it will probably first be reported as a military or political coup, information that the cartels are in complete control will eventually surface.</p>
<p>At that time the US will be confronted with the decision to close the border or invade Mexico as it did Panama and Grenada.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, this is good news.  The collapse of corrupt and failing institutions will compel a reshuffling of the deck.  Our enemies have always tried to control the rate of social and economic decay so as to not frighten White sheeple.  A tripling of the flood of Mexicans into our country, fleeing civil war or famine, will not be concealed by yet more stories about &#8220;vibrant communities.&#8221;  It will, however, be necessary to ensure that as many people as possible know who to blame.  When it comes to blaming Whites for the failings of others, our media has no equal.  We have no real access to the airwaves, but we can speak the truth, one on one.  Once a White has been alerted to the aims of the multiculturalists, the scales fall from their eyes and they can begin to see everything through the lens of racial reality.  </p>

		<p>Another example of how we need to LEGALIZE drugs.  With legalization all this nonsense goes away like prohibition.  There are well armed well trained and ready paramilitary groups in this country called GANGS.  Believe me these people are a lot better organized than you may think.  I saw a special on these gangs and they had military grade weapons, an intelligence network and covert tactics.  You may think they&rsquo;re rabble, but they are content to just sell their drugs on a street corner FOR NOW until the first signs of social breakdown (like the LA riots) then they coalesce into an organized fighting force.</p>
<p>Thats the problem with this &#8220;war&#8221; on drugs.  It makes a super network of criminals with an extensive organization that caters to all the drug lords needs BUT also can be used by terrorists,covert government actions, gun runners and any manner of hooligans for nefarious purposes.  Before there was a lot of money in drugs, these gangs used to fight with base ball bats. knives and chains now Mexico is in their grips, Columbia has narrowly avoided a collapse.  </p>
<p>Why people care what they do to themselves as long as it doesn&rsquo;t affect them is beyond my ken, but if you legalize this stuff, regulate it, tax it and keep people responsible for their actions on it (like alchohol) then I don&rsquo;t see any reason not to legalize it, and the benefits of focusing on real violent criminals instead of these drug schmucks is beyond argument.</p>

		<p>I agree with legalizing drugs.  The war on drugs has not only been a failure for decades now, the problem has increased ten to twenty fold, and presently increases every year.</p>
<p>As long as there are billions to be made in any illegal activity, even the punishment of death, if the perpetrators are caught, is no deterrent.</p>
<p>At some point the US government is going to have to legalize or the narco organizations will own and control huge portions of the Southwest and be just as great a threat here as they are in Mexico.  The cartels already are firmly established in many communities along the border and some control local governments via their economic power.</p>
<p>Drugs are like liquor, which spawned a huge criminal empire during prohibition, which has taken this country until the present time to reduce their influence, and yet much of it still exists today.</p>
<p>Offering substantially greater profits, drug cartels and their billions of dollars are powerful enough to destroy countries if something isn&rsquo;t done soon.</p>

<p>  There are no jobs Americans won&rsquo;t do for a living wage. Mexicans are cheap labor in an industry that has become more unsanitary and dangerous over the years as giant corporations reap huge profits. I&rsquo;ve predicted the economic meltdown of Mexico for some time. It&rsquo;s only the huge illegal migration of Mexicans to the United States that has prevented another revolution and the corrupt Mexican politicans and their American counterparts know it.</p>

<p>That is the mantra of the media and it&rsquo;s true but the little lie they won&rsquo;t tell you is that natives would do the job if it paid more.

		<p>Mexico should be first on the list of countries who abuse human rights (as well as their neighbor&rsquo;s human rights). It is as bad as Iraq was under Sadam or any violent dictator. Everyday there are murders, kidnappings and beheadings. What more do our elected idiots need to cut off all relations with this corrupt place? No money (the drug dealers are now enjoying the first payment under the Merida Initative). No more funds, trade or diplomatic business with this hell hole. And until all their people are gone from here, no nothing!</p>

		<p>With so many &#8220;American&#8221; companies in Mexico, I suspect that our next government (i.e. U.S. taxpayer) bailout will be that of the Mexican government. Who knows, maybe we will have to bailout the drug lords too!</p>

		<p>&#8220;Some of the Indian tribes in remote areas were still at war with the Mexican government as late as 1900. &#8220;</p>
<p>Posted by at 9:33 PM on December 8</p>
<p>&gt; Check again, we were also still fighting some dispersed Indian groups.  But there are a couple Indian tribes fighting the Mexican government in the South last I knew.  The other thing to keep in mind is that Mexico is essential a nation of Indian tribes.  Very few have Spanish blood.  There have been high numbers of Germans that settled in Vera Cruz and Mexico City in the early 20th century - that is why you see the occassional Spanish speaking blonde on Mexican television - but Mexico is largely an Indian nation full of indigenous natives who were nominally converted to Catholicism and given Spanish names.</p>

		<p>Are these the family values that George Bush didn&rsquo;t mind importing when he said that family values didn&rsquo;t stop at the border.  By the way has anyone noticed that the Bushes will be moving into a nice secluded neighborhood in Dallas as far away from these family values as he can get?</p>

		<p>&#8220;&ldquo;There are a lot of Hispanics in north Georgia in the meat slaughter/packing industry. They&rsquo;re here illegally, so they&rsquo;ll do the jobs that no one else wants to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I grew up in Omaha Nebraska in the 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s.  My dad didn&rsquo;t work in a slaughterhouse, but a lot of the neighbors did.  It was a nasty job, but it paid those union workers extremely well.  The could afford a house, non working wife and 3 kids all supported in a nice middle class style. They had vacations, new cars every few years and had a good life.</p>
<p>They were paid better than police officers and school teachers.</p>
<p>The job was not so nasty then, because of all the union and government regulations that were strictly enforced.</p>
<p>Then the Union work force, Omaha stockyards and slaughterhouses closed down.  The plants re-opened in N. Dakota using vietnamese refugee labor.  The Vietnamese had their needs taken care for by welfare, their wages were just extra.  So they were paid less than minimum wage and working conditions deteriorated to before FDA levels. Now the workforce is 4ft8 tall tribes people from Central American rain forest villages.</p>

		<p>EA steve asks &#8220;Would you support the legalization of Crystal-Meth?&#8221;</p>
<p>Meth was perfectly legal when I was a kid.  If you wanted Meth, all you had to do was stroll down to your local drug store and buy it.  You would know the exact dosage you&rsquo;re getting and you would know that it was safe if taken as directed (so I&rsquo;ve heard).  Back then there were no Meth-labs because there was no demand for them.  The problems with Meth only started in earnest when the government decided to make it illegal.  There will always be people who abuse drugs and who are irresponsible but making them illegal only exacerbates the problem.  So our government created the demand for Meth-labs.  Then the government cracked down hard on domestic Meth-labs and drove them to Mexico and - presto! - now the Mexican drug lords are making even more money because our government gave them the Meth market.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t use drugs but am in favor of legalizing them.  All of the ills of illegal drug use would eventually take care of themselves.  Addicts would either get cured or die.  If the government controlled and distributed them like alcohol the cartels would no longer be in business.  Probably half of the money spent on prisons would no longer be needed.  Most of the violence committed by drug users is done to get the money to buy drugs.  I think violent crime rates would go down considerably.</p>

		<p>In response to jewamongyou:</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t have any concern for tiny, legal doses of methamphetimine with prescriptions. However, I do think the use of Chrystal-Meth for recreatoional purposes should most definitely be illegal, with the current circumstances. Yes, enforcement frequently entails an underground; but that is sometimes the point. Better in the back alley than in the mainstream. And the enforcement apparently worked, if it sent much of the production out of the country. </p>
<p>When times were safer and a higher  percentage of people knew how to behave, you are probably right, on Meth. However, Crystal-Meth will not disappear with its blanket legalization. With the current settings, Meth-labs can blow up buildings (including apartments of those who didn&rsquo;t even know what Crystal-Meth was). I know the numbers would probably be statistically low, in reports. However, there is the threat that teens in social situations will be pressured by their peers, and negligent &amp; unfit parents will give some to their kids. </p>
<p>Keeping it away from children is more important than even the right to use it.</p>
<p>In another (previous) time, you would be correct. However, I believe we have already passed the Meth Rubicon. Methamphetamines should not be used for recreational purposes, and I think at least heavy doses &amp; (non-pharmacy) dealers&rsquo; selling of Crystal Meth should be illegal. </p>

		<p>Gee, I wish I could attract this much attention on other articles. I didn&rsquo;t even read the article. I just saw Georgia when I scrolled down. </p>
<p>Because of the low-waged nasty work, this line of work is easy for Hispanics to get into, pushing the white man out. I don&rsquo;t know how many of you have actually worked low paying jobs amongst a majority of Hispanics. It&rsquo;s not fun and I&rsquo;m a female. I got a Peruvian manager fired for what he revealed to me, his dealings with a female in the office. He only hired Hispanics. He had been with the company for 15 years and he wasn&rsquo;t even a U.S. citizen. They never expected a female of my caliber, articulate and educated, to be working that type of physical job. They were all impressed. I could hold my own. </p>
<p>I heard a lot of Hispaics are also in the carpet industry: Dalton West Carpets out of Dalton, GA.</p>

		<p>Funny how American geopologists are so worried about countries around the world like South Korea, Georgia, Japan, etc, but ignore the ticking time bomb right on their doorstep. Nor does it help matters that Mexico is emotionally and culturally hostile to the U.S. and has irredentist views on its territory.</p>

		<p>I can only reiterate what I&rsquo;ve posted before. I worked in meatpacking in my younger days, in Lost Angeles,California. The pay was decent when you&rsquo;re just 18 and not yet interested in continuing school. The more Mexicans that entered California illegally, the more our pay went down. It got to the point where they(the company)created a two-tier wage scale. One pay scale for the illegal aliens they hired,(yes they did) and a higher one for the rest of the workers. Finally, a Mexican became the local union boss, and he was often seen with one of the company owners two sons. He so screwed up the wages and raises that employees deserved, (meatpacking is hard work) that it got to the point where we were making half of what packing houses in Chicago paid their employees. Illegal immigration is a disaster for ALL KINDS OF BUSINESSES, and it ruins the tax base as well. There isn&rsquo;t one benefit to it for the vast majority of American citizens. Those politicians who keep supporting it are corrupt to the core, and I only hope they get theirs soon.</p>
