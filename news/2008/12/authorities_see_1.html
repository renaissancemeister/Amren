<h1>Authorities See Rise in Fake Passports on Border</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, December 16, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Federal officials say there has been an increase in the number of arrests of people trying to use fake passports and visas as they cross the U.S.-Mexico border in California.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The increase has come since the start of a requirement that travelers carry passports, birth certificates or other documents to prove citizenship at border crossings.<br/>

		<p>One more reason we need to go biometrics.  Once someone gives over a finger print it anchors their identity.  That person can no longer rename him or her self.  Of course, a fake passport means that we do not know who that fingerprint really is in the first place but if we get too many bogus travelers from a particular place we can always apply more scrutiny where it is due. </p>

		<p>The Feds and the agencies that are charged with enforcement of laws have failed to do so at all levels.  The SEC, all immigration authorities, the cooperating state, county &amp; city govs all aid and abbet the foreign born invasion that is rapidly leading US to the global facists socialist new world order. Both parties have laid the foundations.  The unexplainable cooperation is in direct conflict with USA Constitution.  The Congress/Senate &amp; Presidents have signed off on numerous legislations which deconstructed the distribution of power in US gov.  Now, bankrupted by unsustainable policies, the next regime will complete the treason against Americas heritage for global communism.  Those who hate US have successfully completed its destruction from within.  Expect all security interests to fail.<br/>
God has blessed US when no one else will.  The invasion and deliberate orchestration of US economic collapse, with timeline legislation, deomonstrates the complicit actions of conspiracy.  The People and God have yet to be defeated by the media/poverty program imposed upon US. Money/legislation is not all.   V</p>

		<p>I can only laugh at how absurdly obvious a fake mexican-made passport looks to INS officials.  A five foot mexican presenting a &#8216;U.S. passport&rsquo; made with crayons and a ten year old laser printer.  No brainer&hellip;.</p>

		<p>When one has a fake passport, one is no longer an illegal immigrant. You are a spy. You must be tried as a spy/</p>

		<p>Use of false ID documents to perpetrate a crime is generally considered &#8220;criminal impersonation&#8221; here if a US citizen does it.  How many prosecutions of illegal aliens will we see over this issue?</p>
<p>My bet is &#8220;not even one.&#8221;</p>
