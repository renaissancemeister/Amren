<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Magnet schools in Los Angeles won a significant court victory Friday when a state appellate panel rejected a lawsuit charging that they violated California&rsquo;s Proposition 209, which outlawed affirmative action in the state.</p>
<p>In strong, clear language, the three-judge panel said an organization affiliated with Proposition 209 author Ward Connerly was wrong to claim that the Los Angeles Unified School District could no longer use the race of students as a factor in magnet school admissions. Race-based admissions were mandated in a 1981 court order that remains in effect despite Proposition 209, the appeals court said.</p>
<p>Although Connerly&rsquo;s organization could still appeal to the state Supreme Court, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who took part in the case on behalf of the district said she thought the challenge was effectively over.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Because the ruling was based on largely technical grounds, Connerly said it was not a serious setback to his campaign against affirmative action. &#8220;This isn&rsquo;t something that challenges 209,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But I think it&rsquo;s just the wrong way for us to be going with regard to the issue of race, at a time when we just elected a self-identified black man as president and we&rsquo;re trying to get beyond race.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Proposition 209, passed by voters in 1996, prohibited state and local governments in California from discriminating against or granting preferential treatment to anyone based on race. It made exceptions for preexisting court-ordered desegregation programs. The case against Los Angeles Unified was based on the theory that a judge in 1981 had ended his court&rsquo;s jurisdiction in the desegregation case against the district, leaving it defenseless against Proposition 209.</p>
<p>The appeals court said that was not the case. &#8220;We begin our analysis,&#8221; wrote 2nd District Appellate Court Judge Sandy R. Kriegler, &#8220;with the undisputed material fact that the Superior Court&rsquo;s 1981 final order has never been reversed, overruled, vacated, revoked, modified or withdrawn.&#8221;<br/>

		<p>Quite honestly, most magnet schools aren&rsquo;t that much better than the regular schools in their district.  In St. Louis City, there was a trend to classify more and more schools (as a percentage of the whole) as &#8220;magnet&#8221; schools, merely to trick white students into coming from the suburbs.</p>

<p>I noticed the same thing here in Ohio.  Even the so-called &#8220;gifted&#8221; classes have students, minorities exclusively, who are borderline retarded.  I have taught here for a couple of years but when I was substitute teaching, in each and every class there were about 15-20% of the &#8220;students&#8221; for whom we were basically providing daycare, as they did zero work and were completely undisciplined and unbelievably disruptive.</p>
<p>Public school is no place for any decent white student.</p>

		<p>I was speaking with an elementary school teacher a couple of days ago. She told me, to my astonishment, that she has a child in her class who was placed in the so called &#8220;gifted&#8221; program (needed I.Q., I believe, is 130 or so). This child had I.Q. of 90!<br/>
I mentioned this to my wife who is a school administrator, and she was not surprised at all. </p>

		<p>I went to one of these so called Magnet schools for my freshman year of high school. What a joke. It had been created out of the blackest school in the district and of course the blacks resented the whites (and the few asians) and cut them out of any social activities like sports and dances. Not that many whites wanted to go anyway since the activities were all black oriented. I had 3 jacket, 1 necklace and 1 purse stolen in the school year that I attended not to mention the harassment and abuse suffered by black students. The white and asian students tended to stick together and dominated the academic classes. The year after I left they elected a white homecomming queen and near riots broke out among students AND parents. I would save every penny for a private high school or home school your child  &mdash;   they will get the better education. </p>

		<p>Prop 209 does not affect anything at all.  It has been a dead letter law from the beginning because no enforcement provisions were built in.</p>
<p>Prop 209 cannot be enforced.  Civil service jobs, medical jobs, and other government jobs are now entirely held down by non whites, mostly immigrants.  Colleges still discriminate against whites and are very proud of this.</p>
<p>Prop 209 was never enforced.  It was never intended to be enforced.  It will never be enforced.</p>
