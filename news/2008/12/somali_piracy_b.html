<h1>Somali Piracy Backed by International Network</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mohamed Olad Hassan and Elizabeth A. Kennedy, AP, December 10, 2008 </i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Ahmed Dahir Suleyman is cagey as he talks about the global network that funds and supports piracy off the coast of Somalia.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have negotiators, translators and agents in many areas &hellip; let me say across the world,&#8221; said Suleyman, a pirate in the harbor town of Eyl, where scores of hijacked ships are docked.</p>
<p>&#8220;These people help us during exchanges of ransom and finding out the exact person to negotiate with,&#8221; he told The Associated Press. Before cutting off the cell phone call, Suleyman snapped: &#8220;It is not possible to ask anymore about our secrets.&#8221;</p>
<p>The dramatic spike in piracy in African waters this year is backed by an international network mostly of Somali expatriates from the Horn of Africa to as far as North America, who offer funds, equipment and information in exchange for a cut of the ransoms, according to researchers, officials and members of the racket. With help from the network, Somali pirates have brought in at least $30 million in ransom so far this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Somali diaspora all around the world now have taken to this business enterprise,&#8221; said Michael Weinstein, a Somalia expert at Purdue University in Indiana. He likened the racket to &#8220;syndicates where you buy shares, so to speak, and you get a cut of the ransom.&#8221;</p>
<p>Weinstein said his interviews with ransom negotiators and Somalis indicate the piracy phenomenon has reached Canada, which is home to 200,000 Somalis.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The pirates acknowledge using foreign help.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Aden Yusuf, another pirate in Eyl, told The AP that foreigners in Dubai, Nairobi, Djibouti and elsewhere help pirates get sophisticated equipment, such as money-counting machines seen at foreign exchange bureaus, in exchange for a cut of the ransom.</p>
<p>Roger Middleton, an expert on East Africa at Chatham House think tank in London, said ransoms in the past have been &#8220;channeled to expatriate Somalis around the world.&#8221; But pirates appear to be opting for direct cash payouts more often now &mdash; bypassing even the hawala tranfer system &mdash; because of concerns about scrutiny by governments, he said. In one instance at the beginning of this year, he said, the pirates wanted the money delivered through the Gulf but nobody was prepared to take it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Somali pirates also rely on a local network of corrupt officials and villagers eager for money in a region with no real economy. Somali pirates generally dock hijacked vessels near the coast in the northern Somali region of Puntland as they negotiate ransoms. Rogue security and government officials there allow the pirates to use ports and move freely around towns while they restock ships, said Abdullahi Said Aw-Yusuf, a district commissioner in Eyl.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The pirates have attacked more than 90 vessels this year and successfully seized more than 36.<br/>

		<p>This doesn&rsquo;t bode well for Somalia.  What this article means is that the Somalians can&rsquo;t hijack oil tankers that pass right by their own coast and have for decades, without help from others. </p>

		<p>In an earlier post on this subject, many readers suggested bringing back the Convoy system. It`s now gone beyond even that to needing secret sailing times, not revealing the cargo manifest and perhaps even disclosing  destination only after being at sea.  Hard to believe guys in skiffs with RPG`s are the new surface raiders. </p>

		<p>I certainly believe this. I read a book on the trail of connections that link different people around the world and so many enemies (Osama bin Laden&rsquo;s son worked on Bush Sr&rsquo;s oil field, or something to that effect).</p>

		<p>Wasn&rsquo;t it the Somalians in Maine that had to be shown how to flush a toilet when they got here.</p>
<p>It must be super easy to hijack a ship, because these people are not real swift when it comes to thinking things out.</p>
<p>How is it the joke goes?  &#8220;On a pirate ship, how do you tell which one is the Somali pirate?</p>
<p>Answer:  &#8220;He&rsquo;s the one with the patch over each eye.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Who is more pathetic ? Whites who can&rsquo;t work for their own common good or Somalis who do ?(even if it&rsquo;s illegal) <br/>
I say whites are more pathetic.</p>

		<p>The pirates in Somalia don&rsquo;t bother me nearly as much - and haven&rsquo;t stolen a fraction as much - as the pirates on Wall Street, K Street, Capitol Hill and the Chamber of Commerce. Seriously: $30 million? Chump change. How much did the CEO of WaMu make last year? How much did the Sandlers make from unloading their rotting business onto the idiots at WaMu?</p>
<p>I hope the piracy keeps up. Perhaps the economic boom it causes will keep more Somalis home, and cause a few to return, as well.</p>

		<p>I haven&rsquo;t figured out why they don&rsquo;t simply arm the merchant ships (although I know that some countries forbid ships registered in their country from doing so). I thought that, in the old days, when trouble arose the captain would unlock the gun locker and hand out rifles to trusted sailors.</p>

		<p>We MUST NOT do anything about this. Remember, we have a global economic slowdown. The number of boats going past Somalia must have lessened in frequency. Those poor pirates must already be in dire straits and may have to take up menial labour jobs to support their 7 wives and 29 hungry children.</p>

		<p>I bet if you investigated deep and long enough, you will find some sort of American support through some silly program where it ends up American tax payers supporting the pirates! I hate to judge before all the facts are in, but from experience&hellip;&hellip;</p>

		<p>I see in Friday&rsquo;s Intl. Herald Tribune that the Chinese navy has deployed warships to the coastal region of Somalia. I believe the Chinese have had 6 ships hijacked so far this year. This should get very interesting, as the Chinese don&rsquo;t play. They won&rsquo;t be deterred by the same Christian, humanitarian inhibitions of the West. It&rsquo;ll be good to see them blast these pirate ships out of the water   &mdash;   doing what we should have done, if we only had the resolution.</p>
<p>This is also a very significant move too, in that this marks the first time in modern history that Chinese warships have been deployed outside of Chinese waters.  It was only a brief article, deceptively small,  but could mark what may be a momentous change in the world&rsquo;s power politics. China is beginning to flex its muscle.</p>

		<p>The Indian navy has already sunk one of the mother ships the pirates were using as a seagoing base for the skiffs they use.  It matters relatively little that the naval forces of the developed West have emasculated themselves and adopted a &#8220;catch and release&#8221; policy for pirates; the fact that SOMEONE is willing to kill pirates is going to help contain the problem.  Enough of these thieves disappearing at sea will help convince the rest to look for honest work.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Look to Egypt to get involved as well.  If shipping is routed around the Cape of Good Hope instead of passing through the Suez Canal, the Egyptian government will be out the substantian fees it collects for the use of the waterway.</p>

<p>That is a VERY good point!  Obviously, Egypt  (if it&rsquo;s able to do so) is not going to stand for that. </p>
