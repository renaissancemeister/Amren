<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Note to criminals: Do not lie to police about your name when your surname is tattooed on your neck.</p>
<p>Darnell L. Frazier, 25, did just that  &hellip; uh, well, he tried to do just that early Thursday on St. Paul&rsquo;s East Side.</p>
<p>According to the police report, an officer stopped two men walking in the street at Forest Street and Minnehaha Avenue. One was &#8220;evasive&#8221; about his identification, telling the officer he had never had a photo ID. He said his name was Darnell Lewis, spokesman Peter Panos said.</p>
<p>The officer, however, noticed that the man had &#8220;Frazier&#8221; tattooed on his neck.</p>
<p>Frazier was arrested on four misdemeanor warrants, including driving after license revocation, driving after suspension and no proof of insurance.</p>
<p>He also had at least two felony warrants for his arrest: a probation violation in Jackson County for bringing a stolen vehicle into Minnesota and a failure to appear in Hennepin County on a drug charge.</p>

		<p>What about another criminal count of presenting false identity to a law enforcement officer?  I don&rsquo;t know about other places, but blacks in St. Louis are bad about assuming multiple identities, mainly to hide out from warrants.</p>
<p>Even though my last name is on my mailbox, I often get somebody else&rsquo;s mail.  I once asked the manager of a Post Office why the letter carriers put the wrong mail in my box despite my last name being on it.  She told me that the P.O. instructs its letter carriers to disregard names on mailboxes and residential mail slots, and put the mail where they think it should best go, because names on mailboxes and door mail slots are often fakes, because the residents&rsquo; real names have warrants out.</p>

		<p>Also, if you&rsquo;re going to be a criminal, don&rsquo;t have your name tattooed on your neck!</p>
<p>One shouldn&rsquo;t generalize, but it is interesting to note the prognathism of his profile. It looks like the facial angle is no more than seventy degrees. I point this out only because this is discussed in the book reviewed in the current issue of American Renaissance, <i>Erectus Walks Among Us.</i> Certainly prognathism does not directly correlate to intelligence  &mdash;  otherwise IQ tests would not be necessary  &mdash;  but it does give an indication as to his racial makeup.</p>

		<p>I saw a &#8220;with-it&#8221; fashion model a while back railing against tattoos for women. God, I wanted to jump through the screen and hug the girl. Being an AMRen reader, I also knew it was in essence a revolutionary denuciation of the whole MTV regime. Wish I could remember who it was. She was half my age, but apparently grew up with the same sort of mother. The type that thinks tattoos belong only on convicts and sailors, much less women. </p>

		<p>Maybe he could have gotten away with his name tatooed on his calf. Oh, that&rsquo;s where black females have their names tatooed. </p>
<p>Oh, well, what to do? not commit offenses, not lie&hellip;Nah!</p>

		<p>I guess, it won&rsquo;t be long before ACLU targets discrimination against people with tattoos. If they have their way as they have had, an activist liberal judge will rule in their favor that police must not notice or take into account what person&rsquo;s tattoos are saying or depicting.</p>
<p>Just like police in LA and other &#8220;sanctuary&#8221; cities cannot enquire about the immigration status of lawbreakers that look as if they hopped the Amercan-Mexican border yesterday.<br>

		<p>A Washington State Trooper friend of mine just told me a story about one of his colleagues who recently made a routine traffic stop.  The Black man in the car had done a legal name change and his name on his license read, &#8220;Almighty Pimp Master.&#8221;</p>

		<p>When I was locked up, one of the gangsta &#8220;bro&rsquo;s&#8221; had his federal Bureau of Prisons ID number tattooed on his neck.  A decent sort, actually, but not the sharpest tool in the shed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still betting that in about 20 years, tattoo removal will be one of the biggest industries in the US.  Think about it; Angelina Jolie might look like an idiot now, but in a few decades when the ink has faded and started to spread, she&rsquo;ll wish she&rsquo;d gone in for something more expensive but less disfiguring, like $cientology.</p>

<p>I feel the same way, Tim. </p>
<p> When I saw &#8220;No Country for an Old Man,&#8221;  I just kept thinking, &#8220;No country for a White man.&#8221;  And when the Sherrif was in that coffee shop talking with an old colleague and he said, &#8220;If you had told me 20 years ago that kids would be walking down the street with pink hair and a bone in their nose, I wouldn&rsquo;t have believed you.&#8221;  &#8220;Signs and wonders,&#8221; the Sherrif replied.</p>
<p>Now look at the border war.  And it is all about bringing in drugs for liberals who typically have nose and lip rings - and tatoos.  They don&rsquo;t want wars but don&rsquo;t mind if it is getting their play things to them.</p>

		<p>I agree with most of you on most issues, but tattoos on women are sexy. And if you&rsquo;re creative enough, tats can be a discreet display of white ethnic pride. Plus women love them.</p>
<p>Politics stops at the water&rsquo;s edge of sexuality. Tattoos trump conservatism in this regard.</p>
