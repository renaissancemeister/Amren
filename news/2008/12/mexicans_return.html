<h1><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28427284/">Mexicans Return Home for Truck Competition</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, December 29, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Organizers of central Mexico&rsquo;s annual competition for the most tricked-out &#8220;troca,&#8221; or truck, say more migrants are returning to their homeland, and many are planning to stay for a while.</p>
<p>The U.S. economic downturn didn&rsquo;t hurt the 9th annual &#8220;Paisano Day&#8221; competition on Sunday, when 94 pickups and SUVs turned out &mdash; more than double the average number of contestants in past years.</p>
<p>In fact the meltdown is precisely the reason more migrants have come back, and some are thinking of staying in their hometown while they wait out the tough times north of the border, said event organizer Iber Silva.</p>
<p>&#8220;The turnout increased because of the crisis, a lot of migrants are returning,&#8221; he said after the top prize of $1,000 was awarded to Daniel Gutierrez, who has spent the last 18 years working as a plumber in Miami.</p>
<p>The annual competition celebrates the large, custom-modified &#8220;trocas&#8221; migrants acquire in the United States &mdash; some with gull-wing doors, pneumatic lifters and statues of the Virgin of Guadalupe. Contestants parade the vehicles down Jalpan&rsquo;s main road, music at full blast.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Bringing a vehicle back from up there is a symbol that you&rsquo;re earning good money, you&rsquo;re doing well,&#8221; said Gregorio Mar, an immigrant who spent 10 years in Atlanta.</p>
<p>Silva said that for young people in Jalpan, &#8220;ever since grade school, they want to go to the United States. Why? To bring back a truck with a full sound system.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of these trucks have 200,000 peso ($14,500) sound systems,&#8221; he noted. By contrast, daily wages in the region average $7 to $10 per day.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot are thinking of staying here. They say, &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s wait and see if things get better, if this crisis ends,&#8221; Silva said. &#8220;Unfortunately, the remittances they send back are what keeps this state afloat, and if they don&rsquo;t go back, there will be less access to goods, more austerity and crisis.&#8221;<br>

<p>Yes, but what good does going back due if they can&rsquo;t get a job when they get here.</p>
<p>Of course, Pedro never thought of that, so he&rsquo;s going to make a long trek through the desert so he can sleep under a bridge.</p>

		<p>Perhaps the destitute in Mexico can pilfer these &#8220;trocas&rsquo; and part them out for bean, corn, and tortilla pesos!</p>

		<p>The one good thing about our economic downturn is a lessening of pressure on us here in the Northwest by Mexican immigration and other Hispanic groups.  But many are still arriving from other places via the political refugee programs.</p>

		<p>This also reminds me my last Fourth of July in Santa Rosa, CA.  The main street was jammed with Hispanics and their outlandishly outfitted autos with battery run hydrolics.  As they cruised around, their machines hopped up and down.  There had long been a cruising ban, but the city police took a powder on this &#8220;all-American&#8221; holiday.  But the results were laughable; the batteries soon ran down and all the tow trucks in the area were on Mendocino Avenue towing away the cars with dead batteries.</p>

		<p>Mexico hasn&rsquo;t a clue on supporting itself. It is a parasitic nation that will always depend on migration and crime. After decades of criminal governments and the sense of entitlement the loons in Washington have encouraged, we will forever have the lowest elements of society pouring across our borders. And, as our new President-elect says, &#8220;It would be UNFAIR to deport them. I hope before he leaves office, he&rsquo;ll explain that one!</p>

		<p>Mexicans love tacky festivals  &mdash;   in graveyards, on main streets, it doesn&rsquo;t matter, the tackier the better. It&rsquo;s too bad that their government, sitting on enough natural resources to build a healthy society, will never be able to contain the pervasive corruption and violence to really give them something to celebrate. </p>
