						<p>About four in 10 new Canadians wired money back to family or friends, with much of the funds flowing to the Philippines and Haiti, new government data show.</p>
<p>Among immigrants who arrived in Canada during 2000 or 2001, 41 per cent sent money at least once in their first four years, Statistics Canada said Wednesday. Of those, the average amount was $2,500 within the first two years of landing and $2,900 within two to four years.</p>
<p>Wednesday&rsquo;s report, one of the first to measure such economic activity in Canada, comes as remittances are booming worldwide. In countries such as Haiti, Lesotho and Jordan, they comprise almost one-third of the gross domestic product. They&rsquo;re also a significant part of the economy in Jamaica, the Philippines and the Dominican Republic among others, Statscan said, citing 2004 World Bank figures.</p>
<p>Such money flows across borders are swelling as people leave their home countries in search of work. Global remittances &mdash; money transferred between individuals across borders &mdash; worldwide zoomed to $369-billion last year, or double the amount spent on foreign aid to developing countries.</p>
<p>In Canada, where one in five people are born outside the country, about $5-billion is sent in remittances a year, according to Western Union, one of the world&rsquo;s largest money transfer firms.</p>
<p>The likelihood of immigrants wiring money to their home countries depends on three factors, Statscan said: their income, family obligations in Canada and abroad, along with demographics.</p>
<p>The poorer the country of origin, the more likely the newcomer is to send money home. &#8220;The incidence of remitting was highest among those from countries with lower GDP per capita,&#8221; the report said.</p>
<p>For example, 60 per cent of immigrants from the Philippines and Haiti sent remittances two to four years after landing. Roughly half of newcomers from Jamaica, Nigeria, Romania, Guyana and Ukraine sent money. Less than 10 per cent, however, of immigrants from industrialized countries such as France, the United Kingdom and South Korea did so.</p>
<p>More than half of immigrants from Southeast Asia and the Caribbean and Guyana sent remittances home two to four years after landing, while about 40 per cent of those from sub-Saharan Africa and Eastern Europe did so.</p>
<p>Immigrants from East Asia sent, on average, $3,900 back home within two to four years after landing while immigrants from the Caribbean and Guyana sent $1,600.</p>
<p>Economic immigrants tend to send more money to their home countries than family class immigrants and refugees, the report said.<br>

			<p>So much for immigration being necessary to maintain Canada&rsquo;s economy! I wonder how much of this money should have gone to the federal gov&rsquo;t in taxes? And as the most money is sent back to the poorest nations, it goes to show how those countries are using Canada as a source of welfare per se.</p>

			<p>What is the net insight of this article? Nothing, really. People send money to their families. If Mom &amp; Dad need money, the money gets sent. If Canada doesn&rsquo;t like outflows, then Canada ought not to be so fatuous as to allow everybody and his or her siblings, parents and cousins into the country. Canada is far more naive in practice, immigration-wise, than is the U.S. Apart from all that, however, money moves where it moves precisely because that&rsquo;s what people and economies cause it to do. It&rsquo;s not rocket science, and we need not try to make it so. By the way, since when did Western Union get a pass on pipelining cash out of a country?</p>

			<p>If statistics such as these are only gleaned from money transfer institutions, it is missing the BIG picture totally. I work with Philippine crews here in Iraq (all of them good people I would add) and all of them have EFT to home banks on payday. I would think it is the same thing in Canada. I also have employees from Nepal and Sri Lanka and they also have EFT to banks in their home counties. My employees also have a set amount of money taken here on camp, as do employees of all contractors, and they in turn use Western Union to send even some of that money home. I think these statistics in the above article needs to be redone.</p>

<p>Yes and I&rsquo;ll bet many of these &#8220;new Canadians&#8221; are also getting some form of welfare while at the same time sending their money back home.</p>

			<p>A Somali immigrant woman in Ottawa can have five children and be getting welfare, subsidized housing, and child benefits. There&rsquo;s always something left over to send to the clan leaders in Mogadishu.</p>

			<p>Yet another non story. According to Western Union. They are far from the only or biggest player in the field. My neighbourhood has slowly been turning &#8220;ethnic&#8221; with it has come the opening of 6 - in walking distance - money remittance shops.  The Muslim ones never deal with banks, all goes via the hawala system, word of mouth only, no paper trail which is why the terrorism funding is next to impossible to trace.<br>
If Western Union says $5 billion it means $30.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s interesting how the politicians, bureaucrats, and welfare state dependents, who are always so desperate for additional revenue going into the maw of the state, never think of taxing this colossal flow of funds.</p>
<p>Doing it would have a host of benefits, including punishing these companies which, vulture like, prosper at our decline; raising money to offset the cost of immigration enforcement and the rest of the heavy buden nonwhites impose on us; and finally, encouraging nonwhites to leave.</p>
