						<p>The family that planted corn in the front yard of their $500,000 home is gone from Carrie Oliver&rsquo;s street. So are the neighbors who drilled holes into the trees to string up a hammock.</p>
<p>Oliver&rsquo;s list goes on: The loud music. The beer bottles. The littered diapers. All gone. When she and her husband, Ron, went for walks in their Manassas area neighborhood, she would take a trash bag and he would carry a handgun. No more. &#8220;So much has changed,&#8221; she said in a gush of relief, standing with her husband on a warm summer evening recently outside a Costco store.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Since the day one year ago when Prince William County supervisors launched their crackdown on illegal immigration, the gulf between the Olivers&rsquo; relief and Gonzalez&rsquo;s dejection has narrowed little, and possibly widened.</p>
<p>At least there is one thing partisans on both sides agree on: Hispanic immigrants are leaving Prince William. Whether their departure has improved the county&rsquo;s quality of life, or pushed its already strained economy further downward, is the new topic of contention driven largely by views of whether the presence of immigrants was a good thing in the first place.</p>
<p>Anecdotes of the trend outstrip hard statistical evidence, yet there are clear signs that the county&rsquo;s Latino population has reversed its pace of rapid growth. County officials said there are 4,000 to 7,000 vacant homes in the county. Trustee notices fill the classified section of area newspapers, chronicling the steady, staggering forfeiture of properties by homeowners with Hispanic surnames such as Mendez, Lozano, Medina and Rodriguez.</p>
<p>Last month, there were 776 foreclosure recordings in the Prince William County, Manassas, Manassas Park area, court records show, up from 244 in June 2007 and 19 in June 2006.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&rsquo;t attribute all of what might be negative about the economy in Prince William County to the crackdown,&#8221; said economist Stephen Fuller, director of George Mason University&rsquo;s Center for Regional Analysis. &#8220;But it certainly hasn&rsquo;t helped. Neighborhoods that have been weakened because of migration of the Hispanic community out of the county have economic consequences that show up as decreases in retail spending, rental income and potential decreases in the valuation of some housing.&#8221;</p>
<p>That decrease &mdash; home prices in some areas have fallen by half &mdash; is well worth the improvement in quality of life, according to the most ardent supporters of the county&rsquo;s get-tough approach.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;With an empty house, there&rsquo;s hope that the house is going to have somebody move into it that&rsquo;s going to be a good neighbor, rather than an overcrowded house that is a neighbor from hell,&#8221; Letiecq said [said Greg Letiecq, a blogger and president of Help Save Manassas], adding that his Manassas area home has dropped $100,000 in value in the past year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Catching illegal immigrants has made Prince William safer, said Corey A. Stewart (R-At-Large), chairman of the board of county supervisors said. Stewart also said the county&rsquo;s policies have led to &#8220;a plummeting of the crime rate.&#8221; Police statistics show that the county&rsquo;s crime rate has been declining since 2004, even as the population increased.</p>
<p>More importantly, Stewart said, Prince William has become a model for other jurisdictions hoping to act against illegal immigration. &#8220;We&rsquo;ve started a wildfire in terms of other localities and states adopting similar tactics,&#8221; said Stewart, who discussed the county&rsquo;s immigration enforcement success Tuesday with the House Republican Policy Committee on Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Paying for the crackdown has been an ongoing source of tension, and supporters have long maintained that the county would save money through a decreased need for English classes for students who speak another language at home. After years of steady increases, the percentage of students enrolled in English as a Second Language classes appears to have peaked.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Then there are the many smaller, symbolic signs that the county has changed in the past year. Rodeo-themed Latino festivals at the county fairgrounds, once a summer staple, have been canceled without explanation by organizers. The El Primero Mercado supermarket on Centreville Road is now a Shoppers International store. And several county services, including drug-treatment programs and in-home care for seniors, now require proof of citizenship.</p>

<p>Wow, housing gets more affordable and the economists complain. Too bad litter and noise and general idiocy don&rsquo;t show up on the balance books (right away).</p>

			<p>If what is meant by &#8220;quality of life is improved&#8221; when the illegal aliens left, as being a return to normalacy as far as language, customs and behavior, or a certain state of being that formerly existed, if you will, then how can anyone argue? If this is what the residents feel, then it&rsquo;s what they feel. To those who ask for proof of the assertion that quality of life has gone up, one needs to cite the Supreme Court Justice who decided that even though he couldn&rsquo;t define a certain subject, he said everyone kind of knew what it was when they were exposed to it. What else can one really say about these things. Labeling them as racist, prejudiced, narrow minded, etc. really isn&rsquo;t the subject of the conversation, and if it were, then we would need to talk of things like failure to assimilate, etc.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The Littered Diapers&#8221; I  used to live across from a four plex with forty  five  Lutheran Services refugees crammed in it we called &#8220;Little Cambodia.&#8221;  Their dog would every day take soiled diapers out of their  trash can and come into my yard to shred them. This went on for about six months. And  all the while they would watch me police my yard of THEIR  excrement stained trash with  dull uncomprehending eyes.  Cue the slow building rage response. The day of the explosion, I picked up diapers while gagging at 9:00am and then  again at 4:00pm before walking out the door to work. I finally  said to myself, &#8220;If there are more diapers in the yard when I get home at 3:00am &hellip;&#8221; Well, there were. <br>
 I started screaming bloody murder while trying to throw a trash can through their front  French glass door. The entire tribe watched me in the pre-dawn  dark. My rage was unquenchable. After about ten minutes of screaming an Army Officer yelled out his window for me to shut up. &#8220;Yeah! I`ll shut up! YOU  come out here and clean this s&*% up! His light went right back off. Then my phone started to ring. It was a friend on the next block. He told me, &#8220;We hear you loud and clear one street over and lights are coming on three streets over.&#8221; That sent me inside for the night. <br>
  The next morning I was feeling more than a little sheepish. I sat in the house missing going out for breakfast and lunch. Finally around dinner, pure hunger forced me to go out the front door and face the imagined  wrath of about ninety sleepless neighbors. The first one I saw was an elderly lady that lived next to their complex. She had  been nursing a  longstanding grudge against me for painting my house an ugly shade of electric blue. When our eyes met it was like love at first sight. She sent me a look of Christ like  empathy that said, &#8220;I`m not mad. I`m proud! You said every thing I wanted to for five years!&#8221; <br>
 I moved out shortly thereafter, letting the house go into forclosure but recouping my down payment while ruining my credit  by withholding the tenants rent from the mortgage company. As a postscript I ended up ten years later with the wife of the friend that had called to try and calm me down that night . Funny thing is, it took another twelve years to piece together the correlation between my anger and the polices that are discussed on AMRen every day. So know you know the answer to how Tim Mc Hugh came to post on here every day. </p>

			<p>I stopped into a Wal-Mart in a neighboring town just this afternoon. It was horrible! Everywhere I looked, brown and darker brown faces - alien, unfriendly, unpleasant faces. All around me I heard people rambling in foreign tongues, mostly Spanish to be sure, but I&rsquo;m not sure that was all. I could look in no direction anywhere in the store and not view brown and black people in great numbers. There were whites as well, but no more than perhaps a third of the mix. <br>
This is in an area of New York I grew up in. Twenty years ago, unless you went into the &#8220;downtown&#8221; area, you hardly saw a black face in this place and Hispanics, other than light-skinned Puerto Ricans and such were virtually unknown in these parts. Even ten years ago, the demographics were still nowhere near as generally brown as all this! </p>
<p>It was all so depressing. I truly felt like a stranger - uncomfortable, unwelcome, and basically unlike most anyone around me. It was dreadful. I can only imagine the relief those folks in Virgina feel&hellip;God bless them!!! </p>

<p>Personally, I think this paragraph says it all; when you have to carry a gun to walk in your own neighborhood to feel safe, then your quality of life has dropped off into the abyss. And while this article makes some valid points of economic concern for the county, (along with some rather absurdly stupid ones, like the loss of  &ldquo;Rodeo-themed Latino festivals&rdquo;) such as the decline in housing values, these are problems that can improve over time. Unlike, being murdered by some marauding banditos while getting gas or groceries, which is of course an unalterable state of being.</p>
<p>It is often speculated on this website by regulars (myself included,) just what might happen if a given geographical area was to be purged of &ldquo;diversity,&rdquo; be it illegal or otherwise. Here we have a partial answer, which is an economy in transition, but also an overall improvement in daily living conditions and a substantial reduction of crime. In time, this should have a positive effect on the economy; thus, if this occurs we shall have our answer and the diversity-mongers theirs, as well. </p>
<p>Then, maybe the experiment can be tried with an entire state?</p>
<p>What more to say, other than, God let it be so!</p>

Last summer, my neighborhood peaked with blacks and hispanics. Open drug dealing, trash strewn apartment buildings, groups of blacks and hispanics sitting on stoops and storefronts most of the day&hellip; the list goes on.</p>
<p>In early spring, the police had a massive sweep of the neighborhood and they locked up or drove off the worst of the worst.</p>
<p>Things are definitely better but they&rsquo;re far from ideal.</p>
<p>Fewer blacks and hispanics has definitely improved our quality of life.</p>

Nobody likes to see the value of their home drop   &mdash;   but if it means getting la raza out of his neighborhood, it&rsquo;s the best hundred grand this guy will ever spend. <br>

			<p>There is a lot of trepidation about the declining cost of real estate.  It&rsquo;s just a correction from the false boom caused by subprime mortgages.  Now, housing and renting are becoming more affordable overall.  It shouldn&rsquo;t have been that high to begin with.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;Whether their departure has improved the county&rsquo;s quality of life&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Only a typical, leftist, dumb publication of the MSM would wonder whether &#8216;[Hispanic] departure has improved the&hellip;quality of life&hellip;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Yes, loud music, empty beer bottles, littered diapers and having to carry a hand gun in one&rsquo;s neighborhood certainly adds to the quality of life  &mdash;  aren&rsquo;t those the very things people seek out when looking for a neighborhood in which to raise their children?  Wonder if the neighbors think the presence of &#8216;overcrowded houses and neighbors from hell&rsquo; is a &#8216;good thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Of course, the pointy-headed elites from the local university believe:  &#8220;&hellip;migration of the Hispanic community out of the county have economic consequences that show up as&hellip; potential decreases in the valuation of some housing&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m very sure the devaluation of the housing stock is due to &#8216;Hispanics leaving the area.&rsquo;  How could it not be?</p>
<p>I live outside of LA where the local yellow rag reports that the schools in my community are hemorrhaging enrollment, especially of their &#8216;Spanish-speaking students&rsquo; because of still-high housing costs and so-called &#8216;exotic&rsquo; mortgages taking their toll (on those who shouldn&rsquo;t have qualified in the first place.) Lately, it seems there are more Whites and Asians moving into bank-forclosed homes around here  &mdash;  fixing them up and moving their families in.  Do you think that will help the value of our homes?</p>
<p>My house has lost a tremendous amount of its value over the past year  &mdash;  I willingly accept that loss (which I believe is temporary) over living in an un-safe, loud, filthy, area around &#8216;neighbors from hell.&rsquo;  </p>
<p>Good Riddance.</p>

			<p>Tim McHugh:</p>
<p>What a heartfelt story!  Your letter points not only to the frustration we feel, but to the inability to effectively address the problem.</p>
<p>Everyone ought to read &#8220;Rules for Radicals&#8221;, a book by Saul Alinsky, a Jewish agitator who helped teach leftist organizing and agitation to generations of leftists in the USA.</p>
<p>The truth is that his techniques are extremely effective for ANYONE to use, and particularly for intelligent folks.  Obama worked for three year buffing his resume for Harvard and teaching the techniques in Chicago to extort money out of the city. He left because the people were just too stupid and unmotivated.</p>
<p>But the techniques can and will work very well for smart folks like us, too.  </p>
<p>For example, Tim, imagine picketing a Lutheran Church in your town during Sunday Services asking them to spend some of their rich Lutheran white folks&rsquo; time and money cleaning up after the people they brought in to the country and dumped on the community.  </p>
<p>I guarantee you that they would do something after one or two Sundays of quiet peaceful protests.  And it would certainly include telling the Lutheran leadership not to dump any more pig-ignorant refugees on their town!</p>
<p>We are not alone. Every one of our communities has people just like us that are willing to get out and do something collectively to make things better.  Prince Georges County is just one example of what we can do.  We can use the same approach to change the minds and policies of any one of our county boards across the  naation.  Alinsky in his books teaches how peaceful protests before things like boards of directors, town councils, and county boards can be organized and executed.</p>

			<p>Check out what&rsquo;s going on in San Francisco. A guy and his two sons murdered in their car.<br>
That so called Mayor Newsom is an idiot who should be institutionalized for life. Listen to his remarks about the NRA. He is an incompetent and should be recalled. A sure sign of what this society has become when we elect a moron like that as Mayor of a major city. When are San Franciscans going to wise up. MS13 is as much of a danger as Al Qaeda ever was. Meanwhile our &#8220;leaders&#8221; sit back and let it happen. Does anyone else think that maybe they WANT to see this society destroyed? They have home bred and imported hundreds of thousands of  entities who are literally dismantling this country.<br>
Right below the linked video there are others all showcasing MS13 strutting their stuff on YouTube.</p>

			<p>Saul Alinsky&rsquo;s &#8220;Rules for Radicals gives some wonderful pointers on how to organize to organize and psychologically attack town, city, atate governments and agencies to et them to do your will (in our case, to obey the law, identify and expel illegals).  </p>
<p>Here is a good primer of his tactics:</p>
<p>https://www.geocities.com/WallStreet/8925/alinsky.htm</p>
<p>Alinsky is the father of leftist agitation techniques across America.  Please read them. They are just a start, but they work just as well for us as for lefties.  </p>

			<p>Okay, maybe the pro-immigration types lurking on this site will now explain to us HOW QUALITY OF LIFE COULD NOT HELP BUT IMPROVE&hellip; THANKS TO THE DEPARTURE OF THE HISPANICS!</p>
<p>A bitter but inarguable truth! Immigrant bring nothing but social problems, crime, and an insatiable demand for hand-outs with them. While contributing almost nothing of real value to the residents of our cities and towns. A sentiment not necessarily politically correct, but right on the mark in all respects! Then again, we&rsquo;ve had any number of posts supporting my contention by other Americans who&rsquo;ve had the same unpleasant experiences, thanks to Hispanic immigrants living in THEIR midst.</p>

<p>I hate to break it to you, but when Gavin Newsom first won Mayor of SF in 2003, he was the more conservative of two major candidates running.  The other one was an out-and-outright communist, who had a Hispanic surname, whose main platform was more compassion for the city&rsquo;s homeless.</p>
<p>Newsom won, but not by a big margin.</p>

<p>It was I who expressed the frustration. It&rsquo;s really sad. My wife and I were there last year for the first time. SF has got to be one of the most beautiful cities in the US. What a pity that it has been run by such a collection of, as Curtis Sliwa would say, &#8220;Chromosome damaged freakazoids&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Tim&rsquo;s McHugh&rsquo;s story above is entertaining, and aspects of it along with those of the article dovetail perfectly with my own present situation in neighboring Fairfax County, Virginia.  </p>
<p>Readers will find that it is a story of real progress.</p>
<p>My wife is originally from Cambodia, and when I first met her three years ago, she was living in Prince William County, the focus of the article.</p>
<p>She tells me tales of an entire neighborhood of her fellow Cambodian immigrant families in Philadelphia, virtually all living on welfare and defrauding the social services agencies in various ways while breeding young murdering gangsters and cranking out illegitimate babies so as to get more money from welfare, etc.</p>
<p>She has luckily avoided that whole scene, having arrived here twelve years ago and learned English while working at a full-time job in downtown D.C&hellip;understandably she&rsquo;d already grown very wary of blacks having dealt with them in D.C., and my influence has further brought her attitude completely in line with the AmRen way of seeing things!      </p>
<p>Four months ago we gave birth to our first child, a baby boy, and we diligently place the dirty diapers into plastic trash bags to be taken out to our condominium&rsquo;s dumpster.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been following the developments in Prince William County with great interest, because of the intense drama and regional controversy that the Board of Supervisors meetings and accompanying anti-illegal immigrant protests/demonstrations has generated&hellip;and also, because to live as a conservative Republican Anglo-Saxon white male in my area is to feel a continual and overwhelming sense of being under seige by swarthy and shifty-eyed foreign invaders (not to mention the steady gang-swarming of increasing saturation by idiotic Democrats), and I&rsquo;ve been on the edge of my seat to find out if perhaps the Board of Supervisors&rsquo; &amp; Help Save Manassas&rsquo; efforts would actually bear fruit.</p>
<p>Today, my wife and I are trying to figure out a way to move out of our one-bedroom condo and into a townhouse more suitable for a small family, and I&rsquo;m excited that Prince William County now may offer us the opportunity to afford that step on my modest income.  </p>
<p>And do I need to mention that Prince William now appears to also hold out the prospect of some degree of haven for GOP honkies with fully assimilated, non-littering, Cambodian-American wives?   </p>

			<p>Walmart has welcomed illegals with open arms. spanish subtitles all over the place there anymore. Home Depot even has enter and exit signs on their doors in spanish as well as Engish. Many churches embrace these people because they fill empty pews and collection plates. Elected officials do nothing for fear of loosing their support at election times. It&rsquo;s time for true Americans to clear out our current political stable and start anew with leaders that will protect legalized Americans.</p>

<p>Mark Steyn (on Rush, Friday) asked why any society would voluntarily want to be bilingual. IF you are here, be here legally (and we should be cutting back on that, too, from certain sectors) and SPEAK English. Respect civilized norms and customs. What&rsquo;s so hard about that?</p>

			<p>We have this cute little picturesque island off our shore called Catalina Island. Used to be a little haven for SoCal whitebread growing up in the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, and even the 90&rsquo;s. </p>
<p>Best of times were had there. Family time. Beach time, fishing, snorkeling, dinners together. </p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s invaded by a gang called the Brown Pride Locos who claim the island as their gang haven. They walk around with shaved heads, tatoos, and chicano garb selling drugs, tagging up places, bullying tourists, partying madly, and &#8220;holding it down&#8221;.</p>
<p>Tragic. Everywhere these latinos go they set up a gang. Everywhere.</p>

			<p>  I only wish these illegals would clear out of the Chicago area. What depressing neighborhoods. We have too many pandering politicians who need to get the boot. I could only imagine the breath of fresh air in Prince William County. I&rsquo;m jealous.</p>

<p>The IRONY here being the illegals are STEALING WAL-MART BLIND! The wife was at our local W-M last week. Aghast at seeing three or four Mexicans stuffing merchandise under their loose shirts. Natch, the security guys no where in sight (either taking a siesta or a coffee break). I read an article on MSN MONEY some time back. W-M crying the blues about the fierce shoplifting/shrinkage they&rsquo;re suffering. Yet the stupid incompetent management team at W-M can&rsquo;t make the obvious connection between illegal immigrants and theft.</p>
<p>Like the neighbor who watched a thieving Mexican cashier charge her Mexican friend for one can of coffee while the woman bought four large cans. Or the Mexican door guard. Oh, so carefully scrutinizing White people&rsquo;s purchases while appearing deaf dumb and blind as Mexicans are packing out electronics and other high priced items. Like the man syas&hellip; GO FIGURE!</p></p>

			<p>I was in Prince William County a couple years ago. I met another white man who was a golf course supervisor. Sure as shooting the talk turned to crime. He said, &#8220;It&rsquo;s always the some kind of people doing it &hellip;. &#8220;</p>
<p>He did not need to mention what kind he was talking about. </p>

<p>   These brown locos could be rounded up easy enough. Problem is nobody wants to do it. The politicians sure aren&rsquo;t protecting us against invasion, as stated in the Constitution. Just look at SoCal. Where was the protection from invasion for these white  people?</p>

			<p>I lived in Northern VA for years before moving out a few years back. It was obvious that a HUGE number of houses in the PWC area were being sold to either (1) people who could only afford to buy them by combining the incomes of several people and taking in renters or (2) speculators who bought the houses with zero or little down and rented them to NUMEROUS people, thus making a good profit. Both situations led to massive neighborhood deteroriation, especially since the buyers couldn&rsquo;t afford to keep up the property nor could they afford the increase in mortgage payments as rates increased on ARMs. </p>
<p>In most cases, the foreclosed and abandoned houses tend to be these over-crowded houses from a few months back. What has happened is that PWC has FINALLY cracked down on the illegal aliens that contributed so heavily to this problem. PWC is in a position to make a decent come-back provided these cheaper houses don&rsquo;t get bought by another group of speculators who will start to rent to the same groups that have already caused so many problems. Many of these houses have been stripped of appliances, etc and are in bad shape.</p>
<p>My only problem with PWC&rsquo;s tactics is that they should have started YEARS ago. Naturally the folks in McLean, Great Falls, etc are sooooo appalled by PWC&rsquo;s xenophobic racism. That&rsquo;s because they live in upscale, often gated communities with protected or private schools for their children and no neighborhood deterioration. The housing foreclosure problems followed the illegal alien and over-crowded housing problems. I watched it happen.  </p>
<p>Good for PWC!  </p>

			<p>Fed up, here in California at the Home Depots and dozens of other departmenet stores, theft by Mexicans/Latinos is so common it is just audited as shrinkage,etc. I have examples of this stuff so gross that people wouldn&rsquo;t believe it. Yet, once again, the policy of so many of these businesses is a pro-minority hiring policy,and Spanish required. Who cares if all of these businesses go under. I have become so jaded to this stuff, that, I for one, couldn&rsquo;t care less.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s that Mexican THIEF culture&hellip; the Mexican mentality that stealing not only is OK as long as you don&rsquo;t get caught&hellip; but the ONLY (and certainly socially acceptable) way to get ahead. It goes hand-in-hand with that other Latino mind-set. That a woman does not have the right to say &#8220;NO&#8221;, that rape is ok if you intend to marry her. Winked at if not.</p>
