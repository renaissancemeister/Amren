<h1><a href="https://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,23929017-661,00.html">Almost a Million Melburnians Have Upped Stakes</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Masanauskas, Herald Sun (Melbourne), June 27, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>MELBURNIANS are moving house in huge numbers &mdash; with up to one-third shifting to other parts of the city and regional Victoria in the past five years, according to census data.</p>
<p>More than 900,000 city dwellers changed address between 2001 and 2006, as pressure from overseas migration pushed many locals towards the fringes.</p>
<p>About 500,000 people moved outside their local government area, while some 400,000 shifted to nearby homes.</p>
<p>The biggest single transfer saw 10,125 residents leave western suburbs such as Sunshine and St Albans for booming Melton.</p>
<p>There was a similar exodus from the Dandenong region to the southeast housing estates of Narre Warren and Berwick.</p>
<p>Dandenong has seen a major transformation, with the arrival of refugees and other immigrants, in recent years.</p>
<p>Daniel Willis, 22, said he and his partner, Rebecca Parry, moved from Dandenong to Narre Warren to escape rising crime and cultural change.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are going to have a family soon,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&rsquo;t want to bring up a family in that sort of area.&#8221;</p>
<p>City of Greater Dandenong councillor Jim Memeti said the area&rsquo;s cultural diversity was an asset and people moved because housing was cheaper further out.</p>
<p>Other areas with large outflows included neighbouring Clayton, which also has high immigrant settlement, and suburbs such as Box Hill, Pascoe Vale and Coburg.</p>
<p>Some areas with high outflows also recorded big intakes.</p>
<p>Boroondara lost 25,806 residents, but gained 23,237 from other areas.</p>
<p>Record high immigration and a rising birth rate saw the population rise across all council areas.</p>
<p>The data, prepared for the Herald Sun by the state Department of Planning and Community Development, revealed city fringe areas had the most internal movement.</p>
<p>More than 30,000 residents in the City of Casey, which includes Narre Warren and Berwick, moved within the area in the five-year period.</p>
<p>Other suburbs with high internal migration included Roxburgh Park, Sunbury, Frankston, Belgrave and Lilydale.</p>
<p>Planning department senior demographer Jeremy Reynolds said the trend to move small distances was common.</p>
<p>&#8220;The comparatively low numbers of moves across the Yarra in Melbourne, the harbour in Sydney or the Thames in London are indicative of this sectoral bias in migration,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Head of Monash University&rsquo;s Centre for Population and Urban Research, Dr Bob Birrell, said poorer immigrants tended to settle in outer suburbia.</p>
<p>&#8220;Local residents in areas like Dandenong and Sunshine are tending to move out if they can afford to,&#8221; he said.<br>

			<p>I take it white Australians are not supposed to move across town away from immigrants who&rsquo;ve taken all that trouble to move half a world away to Australia, eh?  Which prompts the question: If Sudanese etc. were that desirable as neighbors, why aren&rsquo;t white Australians emigrating to the Sudan and other countries of origin for immigrants?  Just too &#8220;prejudiced,&#8221; I guess&hellip; [/sarcasm]</p>

			<p>White flight is the same the world over. If we could afford to fight without being arrested, thrown in jail, and of course, called names such as &#8216;racist&rsquo; and &#8216;bigot&rsquo; (thereby destroying our careers and our reputations), then I suppose we white people might stand a chance of defending our home turf, rather than constantly retreating. But as our governments have rendered us powerless in the face of third world invasion, what choice do we have? Depressing, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

			<p>John Masanauskas is an unrepentant immigration booster, periodically producing puff pieces about how &#8220;wonderful&#8221; Melbourne&rsquo;s &#8220;demographic transformation&#8221; is.  But peer beneath the gloss, read between the lines, and you can piece together what is occurring, with the influx of alien looking and unpleasant Somalis and pleasant enough but alien looking Indians.</p>

			<p>Consider this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than 900,000 city dwellers changed address between 2001 and 2006, as pressure from overseas migration pushed many locals towards the fringes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In conjunction with this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;City of Greater Dandenong councillor Jim Memeti said the area&rsquo;s cultural diversity was an asset and people moved because housing was cheaper further out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, when any country that sees a &ldquo;migration&rdquo; of 900,000 citizens in reaction to an assumed &ldquo;asset&rdquo; such as forced &ldquo;cultural diversity,&rdquo; it had better brace itself for a coming tsunami of social problems. Australia has a population of about 17 million, so 900,000 real Australians (5.2%) &ldquo;migrating&rdquo; for any reason, should be a cause for alarm; it is a painfully obvious sign that something is dreadfully wrong, and needs to be dealt with quickly. If not, if the problem is ignored, or worse deliberately equivocated into a pretzel of maudlin irrationality, there will be social ramifications that will cease to be &ldquo;controllable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Or put another way, it is a highly foolish investor that sees the displacement of currently stable and profitable assets, by untested or even historically unstable &ldquo;capital,&rdquo; as a &ldquo;positive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!<br>

<p>Oh, yes, diversity is an asset all right.  That&rsquo;s why whites move out when third world rabble move in, as this man did who said, &#8220;We didn&rsquo;t want to bring up a family in that sort of area.&rdquo;  Whites the world over do the same.  </p>
<p>Somehow I doubt that anybody really believes diversity is an asset unless they&rsquo;ve been instructed to take that party line or face dismissal.</p>
<p>What these white criminals like Memetri do deserves a long stint in a small cell.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s liars like this who are the greatest enemies of whites worldwide.  </p>

			<p>Just note where our politicians live. If diversity was such an asset then they would live there too, but in reality they live in large compounds with their fellow Chardonnay sipping Socialists, with a nice high concrete fence to keep the non-Whites out.</p>

			<p><i>Australia</i> should have kept their &#8220;white only&#8221; policy from the 1970s. </p>
<p>About 90% of the world&rsquo;s inhabitants classed as non-white are slowly encroaching and closing in on the remaining 10% Whites who are are now moving away from neighbourhoods today, states tomorrow and then countries next decade. </p>
<p>Should we give advance notice to <i>Iceland</i> now, to expect the world&rsquo;s remaining white stragglers to begin squeezing into that small country by 2050? </p>

Most Aussies are race conscious but given the fact Australias media is all smoke and mirrors it will take another Cronulla riot to demonstrate how tough Aussies feel about crime and immigration.</p>

			<p>As a local I have a better  insight on this than other posters.<br>
Recently many African ` refugees` have settled in Dandneong<br>
and Sunshine/St Alban areas of Melbourne leading to some whites fleeing to nearby `whiter` areas.<br>
The lines <br>
    `escape rising crime and cultural change.`<br>
&ldquo;We are going to have a family soon,&rdquo; he said.<br>
&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t want to bring up a family in that sort of area.&rdquo;<br>
say it all,no need reading between the lines there.</p>
<p>The govts insistence and monumental stupidity  in  allowing over 100000 African refugees into this country over the past 15 years and growing is already<br>
causing social problems as this article is alluding to.<br>
Rest assured as white flight increases there will be more `no go` areas in the future and more crime and other assorted problems  and issues to deal with.Of course lack of crosscultural  understanding and even ` racism`  but  not race and genetics will be seen as the main culprit and we face going<br>
down the same road as the USA and UK to a lesser extent.  <br>
      <br>

			<p>Reminds me of the &#8220;REAL DEFINITION OF MULTICULTURAL DIVERSITY&#8221; I once heard:</p>
<p>Diversity is what you endure in the universities so that you can graduate and get a job good enough to enable you can live as damn far away from it as you can!</p>

<p>You could say that the kids may not care but sadly the more racial and ethnic diversity a society has, the less unity and more discord there is because you have various races and groups fighting against each other and resenting the majority.  State it as a fact, which it is, not as your opinion.</p>

			<p>I will elaborate. Most of these refugees are Sudanese and they are a total disaster for Australia. Australia has stopped admitting new ones and the refugee lovers are all freaked out. Sudanese refugees need to go to other African countries, not Australia. When they come to Australia, they are incredibly crime-prone. Their crime rate is about 12X the normal rate. They are not working out.</p>

<p>Are these the black Sudanese who are suffering ethnic cleansing at the hands of the Muslim majority?  I thought they were Christians so why are they crime prone?  Maybe they are cultural Christians and not committed ones.  Help me out here.</p>

			<p>I believe that at the moment, most of them are from Darfur, but I am not sure.</p>
<p>Thing is, if you go to Black Africa, you will find florid Christians all over the place. Nigeria, which is probably the most evil and criminal society on Earth, is wildly Christian. Most of the Nigerian criminals and Internet scammers are devoted Christians. Their pastors are criminals too, and they give blessings to the criminals to go out and commit crimes and they tell the criminals that God wants them to rip off Westerners and steal lots of money. In parts of Africa, wild criminality and violence go hand in hand with passionate Christianity. Don&rsquo;t ask me to explain it. You have to understand Africa.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, the Muslim North is relatively crime-free and the passionately Christian South is a nightmare of liars, thieves, con artists and thugs. In Muslim Black Africa, there is much less crime than in the Christian Black Africa.</p>

			<p>To Robert Lindsay:</p>
<p>Then why is it always portrayed as &#8220;Bantu Christians&#8221; being steamrolled by Bantu Muslims, whether in Nigeria, Sudan, or Uganda? I have no love for Muslims mind you, since some of the most murderous regimes on Earth are controlled by Muslims. The Nigerian civil war of 1968-70 was promulgated by the Muslim regime against Biafrans.</p>
<p>The term &#8220;black Christian&#8221; is an oxymoron to me, but it&rsquo;s known that Muslim regimes tend to be the instigators.</p>

<p> That may just be do to the severity of Islam. Thus giving blacks a form of discipline they would otherwise lack to help control their poor impulse controls and desire for immediate gratification. Blacks aside, Islamic societies as a rule are corrupt, undemocratic, intolerant, violent, backward and crime-ridden. Muslims are also remarkably unproductive workers and the wealth-creating nature of their countries is about nil.</p>
