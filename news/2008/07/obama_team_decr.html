<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Barack Obama&rsquo;s team has decried The New Yorker magazine for a cartoon cover depicting him in traditional Muslim garb and his wife as a terrorist.</p>
<p>The magazine says the cartoon is intended as a satirical comment about some of the distorted right-wing attacks on the Democratic senator.</p>
<p>An Obama campaign spokesman said the cartoon was &#8220;tasteless and offensive&#8221;.</p>
<p>A spokesman for John McCain, Mr Obama&rsquo;s Republican rival in the presidential election, also criticised the cartoon.</p>
<p>The image, drawn by Barry Blitt and featured on the front cover of this week&rsquo;s New Yorker, shows Mr Obama wearing traditional Muslim dress, while his wife, Michelle, is dressed in combat trousers and carrying a machine-gun.</p>
<p>The couple are shown standing in the Oval Office, greeting one another with a &#8220;fist bump&#8221;, with an American flag burning in the fireplace, and a portrait of Osama Bin Laden on the wall.</p>
<p><b>&lsquo;Mirror to prejudice&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>In a statement, The New Yorker magazine said the cartoon &#8220;combines a number of fantastical images about the Obamas and shows them for the obvious distortions they are.&#8221;</p>
<p>The New Yorker said the cover, called &#8220;The Politics of Fear&#8221;, was a critique of unfounded allegations that have tried to portray Mr Obama, a Christian, as a closet radical Muslim.</p>
<p>&#8220;The burning flag, the nationalist-radical and Islamic outfits, the fist-bump, the portrait on the wall? All of them echo one attack or another. Satire is part of what we do, and it is meant to bring things out into the open, to hold up a mirror to prejudice, the hateful, and the absurd. And that&rsquo;s the spirit of this cover,&#8221; the statement said.</p>
<p>The portrayal of the Obamas &#8220;fist-bumping&#8221; one another was a reference to a campaign rally in St Paul, Minnesota, back in June, at which the couple were seen to &#8220;fist-bump&#8221;, an action described by one Fox News commentator as a &#8220;terrorist fist-jab&#8221;.</p>
<p>The presenter &mdash; E D Hill who subsequently lost her Fox News show &mdash; later apologised for the comments, and insisted that they had not been meant seriously.</p>
<p>The New Yorker said that this week&rsquo;s edition carried two &#8220;very serious&#8221; articles about Mr Obama.</p>
<p>But Obama spokesman Bill Burton dismissed the cartoon, saying: &#8220;&#8221;The New Yorker may think .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that their cover is a satirical lampoon of the caricature Senator Obama&rsquo;s right-wing critics have tried to create, but most readers will see it as tasteless and offensive. And we agree.&#8221;</p>

			<p>With all of his intents and promises to one day negotiate with Muslim terrorists, Obama should be flattered by this portrayal. </p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine what all the hubbub concerning a political satirical cartoon is about anyway.  In the 18th and 19th centuries, the famous &#8220;Punch&#8221; magazine lampooned the British monarchy constantly (and much more ruthlessly), and far more readers were entertained than offended by it. The liberals appear to have no sense of humor, or pehaps this particular lampoon hits just a little too close to home?      </p>

I haven&rsquo;t read the article but from the buzz, it appears to be pro-Obama. The cover is supposed to reflected how Obama-haters view Obama.</p>
<p>The cover was chosen to create an artificial controversy to garner free advertising and increase newsstand revenues.</p>

			<p>As this cover was just criticism of supposed right wing accusations of lack of loyalty, Muslim ties, and such, one needs to wonder how Late Night talk shows, protesters, and comedians will survive when he is elected. No criticism of the Messiah, even in a joking context is allowed.</p>

			<p>Obama&rsquo;s portrayal of a muslim (seriously or otherwise) is one of the most regrettable aspects of this election. When you talk about what he ISN&rsquo;T, you miss a big opportunity to talk about what he IS: A follower of black theology:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_theology" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_theology</a></p>
<p>Please  &mdash;  anytime someone mentions that Obama is a muslim, point him to the above link (or similar).</p>

			<p>What&rsquo;s particularly hillarious about this is that the New Yorker did it!  I smell a Clinton practical joke and I love it.  Which reminds me?  Where ARE the Clintons??  What are Obama&rsquo;s chances without them?  Pander-fest 2008 is going to continue to be more entertaining than the Carter family!</p>

			<p>Once again, mere jokes about the half-Black &#8220;superman&#8221; are like kryptonite to his self esteem.  What is he going to do when the guys who did the chimp/Bush pictures start putting Obama&rsquo;s likeness up next to the chimp pictures?  Cry?  President is a high stress job with strings attached.  A president who can&rsquo;t take harsh satire is nowhere close to fit for the job.</p>
<p>If the picture was so ovbiously off target, no one would be upset over it.</p>

			<p>If Obama and his mate can&rsquo;t stand the heat, they need to get out of the fire. Any idiot knows that when you step into the political spotlight that you, your family, and everyone you know and everything you have done is fare game and subject to be looked at from all sides and turned inside out by people who want to know who you really are.</p>
<p>Frankly I think the cartoon was dead on and much too mild in attacking who these people are and what they really stand for! </p>

<p>I recently heard on the news that Clinton supporters are demanding a floor vote at the Deomcratic Convention.  That coupled with this tidbit from the New Yorker just proves that the Clinton Hit Squad is very much alive and breathing.  I agree this cartoon might be meant as a joke but it only solidifies what people are already thinking about Obama.  Rather than making fun of the right it only draws attention to the controversy surrounding him.  Kudos to Bill and Hillary and their rich powerful friends in NY.  </p>

			<p>As it turns out, the left-wing &#8220;NEW YORKER&#8221; was trying to poke fun of us right-wingers and our theories about Obama.  Seems like that nobody can make fun of Obama or satire him.  We&rsquo;ve gone a long way from Nixon saying &#8220;Sock it to me on Laugh-In&#8221; to the cold fish BHO.</p>

<p>If you remember, Obama wore that same outfit in a real life picture that was released by the Clinton campaign three months ago.  </p>

			<p>The bottom line here is that you can&rsquo;t portray minorities as they really are because what they really are they themselves are ashamed of.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t draw pictures of American Indians with feathers on their heads even though this is how they used to dress.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t associate Asian Indians with curry even though they really eat it.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t call B.O. by his middle name even though that really is his middle name.</p>
<p>If minorities are ashamed of what they are, how do they expect whites to have any respect or admiration for them?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t ever see any white people being ashamed of the stereotypes they are associated with.  The Italians and Irish for instance, are quite proud of all their jokes about themselves.</p>

<p>You know, besides the obvious ethnic double standard and other issues, this is another part that gets me.  These &#8220;offending&#8221; people lose their jobs, their livelihood, their professional reputation, and no one ever says &#8220;See, whites aren&rsquo;t racist.  They summarily sacked her/him without any recourse whatsoever.&#8221;  Instead, they use it as just another &#8220;fact&#8221; that the White Privilege system is alive and well.</p>

			<p>Of course the real injured party is the Wahabi Muslims who can now be expected to huff and puff once again since their &#8220;religion&#8221; has been collaterally ridiculed and scorned! </p>
<p>So now we have the ultra sensitive, affirmative active, politically correct, multi cultural, one world order crowd once again genuflecting before the risen Messiah and begging the Senator and his bride for forgiveness!    </p>
<p>Suppose it was reversed and Senator McCain had been made the subject of derision for say: being a harmless old buffoon! The drive by media would then be &#8220;demanding&#8221; that McCain immediately fire the person who complained about the New Yorker expressing its right to freedom of speech in a satirical way.  </p>
<p>McCain himself would come out and throw his supporter under the bus with something like &#8220;my friends this great American magazine clearly has the right to portray me as a gerontological, incontinent, drooling imbecile, who is suffering from an advanced case of Alzheimer senility! My friends in this great country we can all laugh at ourselves together. My friends &hellip;.&#8221; </p>
<p>So what is Senator Obama going to do if he actually does get the whole enchilada ( and he will too since Senator McCain would never want to give the impression that he has any testosterone left) and those mean old Muslims start reminding the world that he was once a Muslim who has now turned his back on the one true religion. Remember that Rushdie fellow?</p>
<p>Senator Obama = The King with no clothes.</p>

			<p>Hmmmmmmm.  I don&rsquo;t know about this one.  I mean.  If I ran a Magazine I would be well aware that my product would be on display at newstands everywhere, especially in the major cities.  I would also be aware of the fact that most people will only SEE the cover and NOT read the article. <br>
I would also be aware that since most people would not read the article they would not respond with irony. <br>
I find it hard to believe the people at New Yorker didn&rsquo;t know what they were doing.  Even if the article turned out to be Pro-Obama, this is not how I would campaign for him if I was running that Publication.<br>
To me, it&rsquo;s clearly damaging to Obama.</p>
<p>GOOD! </p>

			<p>America&rsquo;s problems are not directly related to Obama or Blacks. America&rsquo;s problems stem from the fact that many Whites are voting for, supporting, and in love with people like Barak Hussein Obama. Obama has been in the proverbial bed with Louis Farrakhan, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake, yet Whites are still lining up to vote for the radical. They cannot get enough of him. *THAT* is what&rsquo;s wrong with America and *THAT* is why we&rsquo;re doomed.</p>

			<p>The only reason that this Mr. &amp; Mrs. Obama satire DOES have impact  &mdash;  and may very likely spread  &mdash;  is because like all good satire, or good humor for that matter, there&rsquo;s more than a germ of truth in it. Otherwise, the satire would utterly roll off the Obamoids&rsquo; backs, having no impact.</p>

			<p>I had to laugh when I discovered this story on another site. On it, someone was literally ranting and raving, at how outrageous, unfair, and untrue the cover was. Then he went on to call Obama a Black Messiah, and said racist need to be prepared because a powerful Brotha was about to lead the most powerful nation now. He then signed off with a Muslim name. </p>

			<p>A surefire way for the Republicans to win the White House? Simple. Get McCain to drop out on health or age related reasons. Put Romney in the front spot. The Republicans wouldn&rsquo;t even have to TRY HARD to beat Obama in November.</p>
<p>Slavishly embracing GWB&rsquo;s two foolish wars is the albatros hanging from McCain&rsquo;s neck. Other than our hopelessly brainwashed YOUNG liberals only the media want Obama. (The media having their own vested interests   &mdash;   dictated by the OWNERS of the various newspapers and TV stations.) If for no more solid reason than that alone, I&rsquo;d want Obama to lose the election big-time.</p>

			<p>Isn&rsquo;t it astounding that the very words that Obama spoke are conveyed in this picture, yet those are the very things he has said of himself!</p>
<p>&#8220;Here are the Obamanation&rsquo;s VERY WORDS:</p>
<p>&ldquo;During a speech given in 2007, Obama stated that &ldquo;Whatever we once were, we&rsquo;re no longer a Christian nation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, consider the following quote from Obama&rsquo;s first little book, Dreams of My Father:  </p>
<p>&ldquo;I will stand with the Muslims should the political winds shift in an ugly direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s very real Muslim upbringing and adult influences should give pause to the most forgiving of Christians.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>Meanwhile, Newsweek had just featured Obama on the cover (in a pose which remarkably looks like a JFK mimic) with an article discussing his religious views.  Also in the magazine is a picture and mention of a book which details supposed post-civil war slavery.  I cannot but interpret this as more media promotion of the man who will finally destroy White America.</p>

			<p>Once again, we also see that a black image is lightened up to appease the black community. This has become so commonplace that you never hear about it, and possibly, people don&rsquo;t even notice it. Its especially common when a black has done something wrong, a criminal for instance, or in this case, making him and his wife look like criminals, they do it. People whined when OJ was shown as dark as he actually was. Just part of the Liberal Thoughtpolice agenda. Bad blacks should be depicted as white; Whites should be depicted as the criminals in movies, newspapers, etc. Blacks as heroic, wise demigods. Up is down, Left is Right, Black is White. Long live Oceana!</p>

			<p>The person who drew that picture is either a genius or a total idiot, because it is the greatest and most accurate depiction of the civil rights movement that I have ever seen. Obama and his wife clearly symbolize the culmination of the reign of egalitarian terror that has been forced on America by its political, cultural, academic and economic elites.</p>

			<p>Indeed, a few folks have mentioned that the piece is meant to be pro-Obama.  PrObama, if you will.</p>
<p>The funniest part is that it was meant to mock Obama&rsquo;s detractors, who claim that the &#8220;fist pump&#8221; was a Muslim extremist &#8220;signal&#8221; to terrorists that &#8220;he&rsquo;s on their side.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, as wildly ridiculous as that claim is, Obama&rsquo;s massively socialist positions are no secret - he would certainly bend over backwards to allow more Muslims, hispanics, and general foreigners into this country.  So, no, he might not be an Al Qaeda operative, but he is most certainly a left-wing nutjob.</p>
<p>And Michelle&rsquo;s Sister Souljah look suits her.</p>

			<p>I find it hard to believe the people at New Yorker didn&rsquo;t know what they were doing. Even if the article turned out to be Pro-Obama, this is not how I would campaign for him if I was running that Publication.</p>
<p>Posted by Johnny B. Gone at 1:07 AM on July 15 </p>
<p>Good post.  I agree.</p>
<p>The problem with this cover is that it&rsquo;s not at all clear WHO is being satirized. </p>
<p>For this reason it&rsquo;s the kind of satire indistinguishable from parody, and like all parody in an age of absurdity it so closely resembles reality as to become unrecognizable as parody.</p>
<p>THIS, I think, is what Obama&rsquo;s camp is responding to, ie; NOT that the New Yorker has insulted them, but that the New Yorker has inadvertantly let the cat out of the bag. </p>

			<p>The fact that Obama and his bloviating wife have associations with some very anti-white, anti-American radicals makes this &#8220;tasteless&#8221; cover mirror reality.  Whites are supposed to feel ashamed of ascribing sinister motives to the Obama&rsquo;s but blacks can race bait and resort to fear mongering tactics without being rebuked by the mainstream media dorks. </p>
<p>Not surprisingly, McCain is playing Mr. nice guy supporting the Obama camp.  McCain and Obama&rsquo;s policies are so similar, except for tax rates, they should stop the charade and run as co-presidents in the upcoming election.  The Republicans and Democrats could follow up with an official announcement of a merger.       </p>

The talking heads on the TV all seem to be saying &ldquo;Of course, *I* get the joke&hellip; but we&rsquo;re worried about all the stupid rednecks out there who will take it seriously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In other words, the New Yorker&rsquo;s audience is afraid that people outside of New York are too stupid to understand satire.</p>

<p>I just spent a couple of hours in a wine bar in a liberal East Coast city surrounded by four Obama supporters saying EXACTLY the same thing. All of them, practically in unison, confirmed that although they LOVE the New Yorker, they feel the venerable periodical made a BIG mistake with this cover. </p>
<p>They&rsquo;re afraid   &mdash;   VERY afraid   &mdash;   that ignorant whites clear across America who DON&rsquo;T live in liberal East Coast cities, will &#8220;misinterpret&#8221; the &#8220;sophisticated satire&#8221; and will have their bigotries confirmed. In short, they fear the mag will cost the Magic Mulatto A LOT of potential votes. That this cover cartoon   &mdash;   whatever its intentions may have been   &mdash;   will result in net damage for the Obama campaign. </p>
<p>I hope their fears are well-founded. <br>

			<p>This brings two questions to mind.  First, how many people would have ever seen this magazine cover anyway?  There must be thousands of different monthlies in this country, and very few, like Time, Newsweek, and the show biz gossip rags are found at the supermarket checkout.  They might as well make a stink over the cover of Tomato Grower&rsquo;s Monthly.  Second, I thought that the New Yorker was a publication for sophisticates.  Why do they need the editor to explain a cartoon to them?  </p>

<p>I&rsquo;d bet they&rsquo;re more afraid that INTELLIGENT WHITES see it for what it is&hellip; a pretty accurate portrayal of a man who listened to anti-White harrangues for two decades. Who claims to be Christian but leaves a lot open to suspicion; a wife who barely hides her hatred of and anger toward Whites.</p>
<p>NO, I didn&rsquo;t need the satire to reject Obama&rsquo;s candicacy. His empty rhetoric, his waffling and prior lies did a good enough job. I said it before&hellip; but were a decent, HONORABLE Afro-American like Colin Powell running; he&rsquo;d have MY VOTE in a New York(er) minute!</p>

			<p>Given the popularity of Barack Obama, it&rsquo;s not surprising that sooner or later those fearful of his ascendancy to the highest office in the land would come up with a cartoon of this nature.<br>
And now that race has finally become an election &#8220;Issue&#8221; it was just a matter of time before the so-called liberals at the New Yorker would come up with something as ham-handed as this. It&rsquo;s bigotry at its most pathetic, so blatant that even John McCain was &#8220;upset&#8221; about it.</p>
<p>Race is something that Americans, until now, were reluctant, and fearful of discussing. Yet, the very future of American society is hinging on how far and how long it is kept in the public forum. If Obama does lose the presidency, he can take comfort in his very candidacy peeling the Band-Aid from the scabby sore of discussing race openly and honestly in the United States. </p>

			<p>The New Yorker magazine is the Norman Lear of our times.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, Norman Lear produced a CBS show, All in the Family.  In it, Carroll O&rsquo;Connor played a semi-lovable but cantankerous bigot, Archie Bunker, whose tirades against anyone non-WASP were designed to be a fictional and comedic satire against the prejudices of &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; America.  However, the white working middle class wasn&rsquo;t laughing at AITF  &mdash;  they weren&rsquo;t laughing at Archie Bunker, and not laughing at their very own selves whom Lear was parodying.  You see, Norman Lear was, as the Brits would say, too clever by half.  His satire was so ridiculous that most white people took the show as a serious political treatise.  &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with that?  I agree with everything he&rsquo;s saying,&rdquo; was a common retort to the TV set.</p>
<p>Some liberals of the time were mad at Lear, because while they understood the satirical nature of the show, they knew that it was backfiring, and in some instances was doing more to spread the conservative racial cause than even George Wallace.</p>
<p>This New Yorker magazine cover is like Archie Bunker, and the mag&rsquo;s editors who decided to run with it are like the Norman Lear that was too clever by half.  The editors wanted to make fun of the American right-wing&rsquo;s theories about Obama, his wife, and their past and perhaps present.  What they wound up doing is endorsing those feelings among those people who have these feelings, and making Obama and much of the left wing mad in the process that they were promulgating these Obamaite myths.</p>

Is a burning American flag associated with Islam?  Is it the genie clothing?  Why would making fun of Osama Bin Laden&rsquo;s picture be offensive to Muslims?  Is he revered?  Why?  Why is it offensive to muslims and not African-Americans?  </p>
