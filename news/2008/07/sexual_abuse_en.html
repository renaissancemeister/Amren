				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Reuters, July 30, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>By 18 years old two in five schoolboys report being forced to have sex</p>
<p>Two out of five male South African students say they have been raped, according to a study published on Tuesday suggesting sexual abuse of boys is endemic in the country&rsquo;s schools.</p>
<p>The survey published in BioMed Central&rsquo;s International Journal for Equity in Health showed that boys were most frequently assaulted by adult women, followed closely by other schoolchildren.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The survey carried out in 1,200 schools across the country asked 127,000 boys aged between 10 and 19 if they had ever been sexually abused and, if so, by whom.</p>
<p>Forty-four percent of the 18-year-olds said they had been forced to have sex in their lives and half reported consensual sex.</p>
<p>About a third said they had been abused by males, 41 percent by females and 27 percent said they had been raped by both males and females. The study did not look at the number of girls who were raped.</p>
<p>Abuse by fellow males was more common in rural areas while attacks by women happened mainly in cities, the study found. There was also a big disparity between provinces with Limpopo &mdash; among the poorest &mdash; showing the highest abuse rates and Western Cape the lowest.</p>
<p>This type of study, based entirely on the response of participants, has limitations because there are no ways to verify whether people exaggerate or withhold information, the researchers acknowledged.<br>

			<p>Check my numbers for me. If one third are raped by men and 27% by both men and women, you are talking about 60% of these people raped by men.</p>
<p>No wonder their AIDS rate is so high.</p>
<p>Many have commented that Africans behave everywhere the same as in Africa. This would imply that here in the U.S. we must have a huge problem of black males raping young male blacks. </p>

			<p>I remember back in the 80&rsquo;s, all you heard was about South Africa and apartheid. It&rsquo;s funny, but now that S.Africa is going to hell under black rule, the media is stangely silent. Well, actually it&rsquo;s no surprise. The american media doesn&rsquo;t report the facts on black crime in the US, why should it be expected to do it anywhere else. Under white rule, the blacks were far better off.</p>

			<p>I hope the United States and Europe are as welcoming to the great Afrikaans people as they are to all the third world that is part of the great invasion by invitation.  </p>
<p>There is no hope for South Africa.  They will get what they&rsquo;ve always wanted:  a black country.  It will degenerate into a stone age society controlled by a few warlords financed by the Chinese.  My concern is not for them but for the remaining Whites. Eventually they will either emigrate or be killed.  Or work for the Chinese, which I suspect, some of them will.  </p>
<p>I think the Afrikaans would make great Americans, maybe even better Americans than the Hmong!  Although I would guess they would have to be considered African-Americans.  Does that mean that affirmative action would apply?  Would that mean I could complain that actresses who look like Charlize Theron are not in enough movies and still get to feel self righteous?  Let&rsquo;s hope so.</p>

			<p>To Gun Runner,  </p>
<p>I think you are right. 59% of them had been raped by males. 41% were raped by females (27% by both male and females) That was a bit misleading the way it was written. We can take comfort in knowing they attended journalism school in the USA. </p>
<p>I have to wonder if 50% of the boys responded this way, saying they&rsquo;d been raped, in some kind of weird effort to get sex for real with their female classmates.</p>

			<p>In reaction to previous posts:</p>
<p>As a white SA Arikaner myself I&rsquo;d risk the opinion that very few of those raped are white boys.</p>
<p>The only news forthcoming from SA is government sanctioned. Whites have no voice and are not allowed an honest opinion, as any criticism of the gov is immediately classed as racist.<br>
Apart from the internet we would not be able to set our side of the story to the outside world. The ANC gov is busy with legislation to control the internet, as well as creating their own newspaper/s. All this of course unerpinned by the Whites&rsquo; tax money, without which the gov would fall within days.</p>
<p>The Western Cape has the lowest rate of rape purely because it has the smallest black populatiion of all the provinces, and also the only province NOT under ANC rule.</p>
<p>Yes, Afrikaners would make great Americans but the would be better South Africans if given the chance to be so by the ruling black criminal elite. Those that do go through the official channels of becoming US citizens all complain about the costs, the time, etc etc, i.e. it is virtually impossible for Afrikaners to become citizens of either the US or EU. Australia and New Zeeland have very recently realised the value of these enterprising, hardworking and honest Christian people.</p>
<p>Please pray for us, as it is our daughters and wives that are being raped in their thousands - some in front of their hapless husbands/fathers/boyfriends. And in our own homes. <br>

			<p>&#8220;Some would say it is impossible for a woman to rape a man.&#8221;</p>
<p>When I was an undergrad at UC Santa Cruz in the late 1980s, the only rape reported on campus was a group of women who raped a male student.  They pulled a pistol on him and told him &#8220;Get it up.&#8221;  Yes, UCSC was pretty weird.  The incident made it clear that the point to rape isn&rsquo;t the enjoyment of sex - the point is dominating and terrifying someone.  In a similar situation, I would try to get it over with as quickly as possible, rather than really taking my time, even though it is the fellow who takes a lot of time and knows what he&rsquo;s doing who pleases women.  At least the guy didn&rsquo;t have to worry about becoming pregnant.</p>
<p>Why anyone would trade a few minutes of really bad sex for potential long-term imprisonment is something I&rsquo;ll never understand.  As for hurting kids, yes, they can be aggravating at times, but my thinking on living in a townhouse is to make as little noise as possible, while tolerating the noise the neighborhood kids make.  My best friend in the neighborhood is a Dutch gal with a 9 year-old boy.  That kid is amazingly nice.  When he broke his wooden sword, I was the one who glued it back together with hot glue and heavy clamps.  It&rsquo;ll never break in that area again, as the glue is srtonger than the surrounding wood.  His mother and I renamed it &#8220;Anduril&#8221; because it was broken and reforged.</p>
<p>Hurting kids makes no sense, but African blacks never were good at planning ahead.  Kids who&rsquo;ve been hurt, like me - I&rsquo;m thankful it was only physically and emotionally - turn into messed-up adults.  Exactly who do South Africa&rsquo;s blacks think will be working as policemen, driving ambulances and taxis, and working as secretaries and cooks and construction workers when they are old and gray?  The kids they&rsquo;ve been abusing, that&rsquo;s who.</p>

<p>This is why blacks rape so much in prison.  It&rsquo;s part of their &#8220;culture&#8221; for men to rape other men to establish dominance.  </p>

			<p>It is astonishing to see incidences of sexual abuse of males so high, althhough I condemn it in the strongest possible way sexual abuse is something usually perpetrated by men on women.<br>
   The explanation is that with black Africans we are dealing with a hyper-sexual people.</p>

<p>Who cares what S Africa &#8216;turns into&rsquo;? They do say they want to be left alone. </p>
<p>I could not care either if S Africa turns into a &#8216;stone age society&rsquo;. In fact, I hope they do turn into a &#8216;depraved&rsquo;, &#8216;sickening&rsquo;, &#8216;grotesque&rsquo;, &#8216;stone age society&rsquo;, &#8216;controlled by warlords financed by the Japanese&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m the biggest racist I know. I really think I do think/hope that.</p>
<p>At the same time I&rsquo;m not an idiot either. There&rsquo;s a difference between being a racist, and just an idiot. Often they exist together, but being a racist and being a stone cold idiot are two different things. I swear.  </p>
<p>My only concern is for the whites there also. Whites who must be suffering, the way I suffered, when I had to work with blacks, and when I lived in a black neighborhood. And suffering now the way I feel I&rsquo;m suffering simply because I live in a multiracial society. The media can&rsquo;t fool me. They can keep me &#8216;silent&rsquo; for all intents and purposes but they can&rsquo;t fool me. Well, not all the time.   </p>

			<p>High AIDS rates among black Africans and Haitians are NOT due to AIDS being more easily trasnmitted heterosexually by blacks. It is because male sodomy, especially rape, is endemic in black cultures.</p>
<p>The &#8216;down low&rsquo; phenomenon is an example. That is the matter of black men who ostensibly live heterosexual lioves - married, even promiscuously carrying on affairs with otehr women - who also often have homosexual activities. Blacks in America live such lives at 4 or 5 times the rate per capita of whites. The current obsession with the rates of black AIDs in America fails to address the issue: black men in huge percentages engage, multiple times with multiple partners, in homosexual intercourse. They then pass on AIDS contracted that way to the women they bed.</p>
<p>Anyone who thinks that black homosexual rape is largely resticted to prisons is naive at best. Homosexual rape is a key part of black gang activity, just as it is in black African military activity. </p>
<p>Show me 10 macho blacks (whether in criminal gangs or formal militaries or sports), and I will show you at least 6 men who are natural born rapists. Further, I will show at least two who prefer to rape males than females and another three who will rape males. </p>

<p>In my traveling days I was on a plane and sat next to a young White man who was originally from Rhodesia. A friend of his, also a White Rhodesian, had immigrated to the U.S. and become a U.S. citizen. When he applied to college he put on the application that he was African American. (This, of course, would qualify him for all sorts of goodies.) The administration tried to fight him, but in the end he won!     </p>

			<p>Nobody who is racially aware would be surprised by this. Naive Europeans who only know blacks from U.S. television, - that&rsquo;s a different story. I feel sorry for the Boers. They got a bad rap. What would America do if it was 80+% black? The whole country as Detroit? The Boers should have hived off a coastal corner of the country for themselves and just declared independence leaving the rest as a black-ruled wasteland. Now its too late. I only wish more could be done to help them immigrate to Western countries.</p>

			<p>I still wonder why whites in Rhodesia and SA didn&rsquo;t hire mercenaries to keep themselves from being run off and/or murdered. I&rsquo;m sure there must be some available and unemployed.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what they tried to do believe it or not.  Essentially, they left pockets of South Africa to be black homelands.  The problem with their approach, however, was that these pockets were ultimately ruled by the Boers and so they were not as &#8220;independent&#8221; as the Boers tried to make them out to be.  This structure did not fit into the international law concept of self-determination, and so SA was forced to end the program.  Sadly, it probably would have worked out better in the end.  Just the Western Cape for the Boers, and the rest of SA for everyone else.</p>
<p>Back to the topic - no wonder these people are so angry.  They were all sexually abused as children.  It&rsquo;s not an excuse for the rampant violence and crime, but it certainly does explain quite a lot.  As much as I think that people need to get their act together and stop whining, NO child should have to suffer through this.  This is one of the saddest things I have ever read on this site.  </p>

			<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>I cannot believe the amount of rubbish that has been written on this page in response to the quoted article. I am disgusted to read the responses above by people who know nothing about actually living in South Africa or Africa. A lot of the comment has nothing to do with the quoted article.</p>
<p>The study has important relevance for the development of more stringent legislation that will help protect young South Africans against sexual abuse. Please refer to the original webpage for the study where a complete download is available:<br>
<a href="http://www.equityhealthj.com/content/7/1/20" rel="nofollow">http://www.equityhealthj.com/content/7/1/20</a></p>
<p>You will note that the article above has in fact quoted the article found at: <a href="http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politicsweb/view/politicsweb/en/page71627?oid=95393&amp;sn=Detail" rel="nofollow">http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politicsweb/view/politicsweb/en/page71627?oid=95393&sn;=Detail</a><br>

<p>South Africa is a beautiful country; diverse in its nature, races, languages and development. Yes, like every country in the world, we have many problems and issues that are being worked on every day of our lives and we accept this and work together to get through it all. Growing up in post-apartheid South Africa I accept every man, woman or child for who they are, without prejudice.</p>
<p>I think just about all of the people who have responded with negative, racist and unacceptable comments above need to have a very good hard look at themselves and consider a pro-longed visit to South Africa before spouting such drivel on a public forum.</p>

			<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>I cannot believe the amount of rubbish that has been written on this page in response to the quoted article. I am disgusted to read the responses above by people who know nothing about actually living in South Africa or Africa. A lot of the comment has nothing to do with the quoted article.</p>
<p>The study has important relevance for the development of more stringent legislation that will help protect young South Africans against sexual abuse. Please refer to the original webpage for the study where a complete download is available:<br>

Intelligent debate on why 44% of all boys have been raped by the time they are 18 years old? Please, begin the debate.</p>
<p>Will you be beginning that by discussing the unique diversity of the people or the complexity of the current political situation?</p>

			<p>There is no &#8220;intelligent debate&#8221; about child rape.  Someone explain to me how we&rsquo;re all &#8220;ignorant about South Africa&#8221; to express that we think that child rape is disgusting and sick.  Child rape has nothing to do with apartheid, politics, culture - it&rsquo;s just sick, sick abuse of someone too little to defend themselves.  </p>
<p>I pointed it out earlier, and I will say it again - this would explain why so many adults over there are pissed off and violent.  Unless you know someone who was horrifically sexual abused as a child who is perfectly well-adjusted, then I am going to stand by that statement.</p>
<p>And civilized people will at least recognize that a child in that situation needs to be taken out of the home where it&rsquo;s occurring and receive tons of psychological help.  All this article did was say that almost half of all children were being abused.  It never said what kind of help they are getting, so I can only assume that means they are getting none at all. </p>

			<p>To Angus MacArthur:</p>
<p>Your posts are at variance to most of what I read about SA. I&rsquo;ve read posts by people touting Zimbabwe too, but there again, such posts are very much in the minority.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing you&rsquo;re actually some kind of communist, and that your website is just propaganda.</p>
<p>The white South Africans that I have met, are typically very glad to have escaped South Africa. Do you have anything against whites leaving SA?</p>

			<p>&#8220;I cannot believe the amount of rubbish that has been written on this page in response to the quoted article. I am disgusted to read the responses above by people who know nothing about actually living in South Africa or Africa&hellip; You will note that the article above&hellip; does not correctly quote the real numbers of people that responded in the original study&#8221;</p>
<p>The whole point of a survey like this is to provide a statistical representation of SA. While they didn&rsquo;t poll every single youth 18 years of age, they did survey 13,900 youths representative of 290,000 SA youths. I read the articles. If I&rsquo;m misinformed as to the methodology, who can be blamed other than the SA social scientists and SA reporters who &#8216;covered&rsquo; this news story? Social workers whose very purported aim is to enlighten us on the subject. </p>
<p>Furthermore, if I understand your criticism correctly&hellip; you are saying don&rsquo;t criticize SAfricans unfairly (and in a disgusting manner) - don&rsquo;t criticize the morality of SAfricans&hellip; and your reasoning is&hellip; 44% of SAfrican youth are willing to lie on something as inconsequential as an anonymous survey. </p>
<p>I think there is more to worry about here than negative, racist and &#8216;unacceptable&rsquo; comments, though I do agree with you many of the comments here are just that. I just don&rsquo;t believe that avoiding the real issue, in such a manner, will continue to be of much help to you once there are no more whites left to blame. </p>
