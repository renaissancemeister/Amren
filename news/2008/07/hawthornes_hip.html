						<p>Students at Hip Hop High know all about adversity. For many, life has been a minefield of gangs, violence and family chaos. They were academic failures, most of them, kicked out of school after school, allowed to fail their way from one grade to the next.</p>
<p>At their charter school in Hawthorne, they say, they found a home &mdash; a place that is quirky and rough-hewn, but one where students are given the motivation to learn.</p>
<p>Now, they fear, a bureaucratic breakdown will cause the school, formally known as the Media Arts Academy Charter School, to close.</p>
<p>The Centinela Valley Union High School District, which charters the school, delivered notice on July 1 that its charter had lapsed and that Media Arts would not be allowed to apply for renewal.</p>
<p>Principal Jennifer Murphy said the decision was the result of a misunderstanding about the terms of the charter, which she thought was valid until 2009. She said she was convinced that the district, intent on closing her school, deliberately failed to warn her that the charter was about to expire.</p>
<p>&#8220;They literally have been lying in wait to do this,&#8221; she said Tuesday night, after dozens of Media Arts students and parents appeared before the Centinela school board to plead for reconsideration. Murphy said she believes the district used a technicality to avoid a potentially contentious renewal process, which requires a public vote and can be appealed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Fernandez said the issue was simple. &#8220;Their application expired. They basically ran the clock out,&#8221; he said. Asked why he hadn&rsquo;t given Murphy any warning, Fernandez said, &#8220;I think she should know her renewal date better than myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>Media Arts has a mixed academic record, as might be expected from a school whose students have typically failed in traditional public schools. Still, after a rocky start, its Academic Performance Index shot up by more than 150 points in 2007, from 386 to 537, and teachers and parents have said the school improved further this year under Murphy&rsquo;s direction.</p>
<p>Parents and students say they are grateful to the school for providing an alternative to Centinela Valley&rsquo;s regular high schools. The district has struggled both academically and fiscally and has an overall API that declined slightly last year to 598. Although one of its schools, Lawndale High, does well academically, the two other comprehensive high schools, Hawthorne and Leuzinger, compare poorly even with schools that serve similarly disadvantaged students. Media Arts does far better academically than the district&rsquo;s continuation school, which serves similarly at-risk students.</p>
<p>At Tuesday&rsquo;s school board meeting, district officials outlined plans to open an alternative school this fall that would offer independent study to at-risk students much like those served by Media Arts.</p>
<p>According to the plan, students would attend school for only two hours a week and be on their own to complete their course work the rest of the time. It was presented at the meeting largely as a way for the district to recoup money that is lost when students have poor attendance records, because schools receive state funding based on attendance.<br>

			<p>I went to Inglewood High in the 1960&rsquo;s, I remember Hawthorne High and Luezinger as being our chief rivals in football, no problems of academic performance were an issue at any of the schools then.  From Inglewood to Palos Verdes, Hawthorne Blvd was a bright, broad avenue of shops and restaurants, clean and safe at any time of day or night. Not so today, it looks like something out of Mexico. Some day all of America, Canada, and Europe will resemble the third world because of our suicidal immigration and integration policies, and when that happens there will be no turning back.</p>

			<p>Same old news. They didn&rsquo;t know. Like the Mr. Fernandez said, they should have known better than him. </p>
<p>As far as the article itself goes, I get the feeling there&rsquo;s a lot went unsaid.</p>
<p>Life is cruel.</p>

&#8220;&ldquo;They literally have been lying in wait to do this,&rdquo; she said&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p><br>
No, they have been FIGURATIVELY lying in wait. </p>
<p>Unless, of course, the authorities who (also figuratively) pulled the plug on this playskool had been staking out the joint in the bushes on their stomachs, which I doubt. When a principal doesn&rsquo;t appreciate the difference between the literal and the figurative, what chance do the students have? </p>
<p>But then, anything called a &#8220;Hip Hop High&#8221; undoubtedly bears more resemblence to a holding pen for delinquents than to an academic institute anyhow&hellip; <br>

			<p>The truth is that Fernandez wants to take HIPHOPACADEMY and turn it into a MARICACHI Vocational High School for his mexican constituents. Lets sit back and enjoy the multicultural show!</p>

<p>Ye gads, this makes my teeth hurt.  They think unmotivated students from &#8220;disadvantaged homes&#8221; (who won&rsquo;t even do regular homework) are going to STUDY ON THEIR OWN?  They&rsquo;ll just be out on the streets even more than they are, which could be a good thing for other students, but not for the general public.  It also lets parents completely off the hook for any responsibility in getting and keeping their &#8220;kids&#8221; in school.  No more inconvenient truancy laws.</p>
<p>I can see the next step so clearly:  the district will be forced to supply a tax-paid tutor to each of these students to work with them in their disadvantaged, quirky and rough-hewn homes, because their parents sure aren&rsquo;t able to do it.  Of course, that will fail, too, but it will certainly succeed in throwing more money at the problem, which seems to be the main goal of these programs.  </p>
<p>It is beyond stupid.  The lack of logic behind these ideas is downright chilling.</p>

			<p>&#8220;They were academic failures, most of them, kicked out of school after school, allowed to fail their way from one grade to the next.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Allowed to fail their way from one grade to the next,&#8221; is the black experience in America today.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no such thing as a black having to earn grade advancement, or diplomas, or degrees, or jobs, or housing.  </p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the most privileged race on the face of they earth, because of two important things: 1) They can&rsquo;t take care of themselves; 2) And if they&rsquo;re not taken care of and given privileges they&rsquo;ll riot.</p>
<p>And today&rsquo;s white fat cats would be appalled to see their economic status place in jeopardy by a riot. </p>
<p>If these white sell outs had a quote they would like to be known for, it would be something like, &#8220;I have just begun to placate.&#8221; <br>

			<p>Isn&rsquo;t Hawthorne the home of Brian Wilson, who wrote architypal American songs of fun and innocence like California Girls, Fun Fun Fun, Little Deuce Coup, All Summer Long, and Good Vibrations?  Can anyone seriously say that Hawthorne 2008 is an improvement over Hawthorne 1966?   </p>

			<p>Oh well I guess now they&rsquo;ll have to go somewhere else to get a fake education.  </p>
<p>This last bit is pretty funny too:</p>
<p>&#8220;According to the plan, students would attend school for only two hours a week and be on their own to complete their course work the rest of the time. It was presented at the meeting largely as a way for the district to recoup money that is lost when students have poor attendance records, because schools receive state funding based on attendance.&#8221;</p>
<p>They finally figured out the perfect scam. </p>
<p>Tell your illiterate, criminally prone students to just stop coming to school but pass them anyway so can still bilk the federal government out of billions. </p>
<p>Its win-win, you lower the school&rsquo;s horrendous drop out rate, school administrators get to keep their six figure salaries and the federal government can just print more money! </p>

<p>How really sad.  And disappointing.  They probably had the next graduation ceremonies planned to include taking hostages.</p>

			<p>Two hours of school a week?  This is a correspondance school!  If they&rsquo;re going to do this, they should shut the building down, lay off all the staff and administrators, and have the faculty run the correspondance classes out of a small office somewhere.</p>
<p>A very minimal education would involve English, mathematics, a different science class each year, and some humanities classes: history, civics, what have-you.  That&rsquo;s four subjects per semester.  Two contact hours with a teacher a week for four subjects is simply insane.  </p>
<p>My junior year, I was taking chemistry, computer programming, calculus, English, German and US history.  That wound up being about 30 hours a week for six subjects.  My senior year, I took physics, advanced chemistry, calculus, AP English and German, or about 24 hours a week for five subjects.  Two hours a week will educate these students approximately well enough to understand the average TV commercial.</p>
