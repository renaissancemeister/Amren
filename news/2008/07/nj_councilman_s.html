						<p>Instead of &#8220;stick &rsquo;em up,&#8221; it will be more like &#8220;pull &rsquo;em up&#8221; now that fashion police in New Jersey have started a crackdown on baggy pants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bart Johnson says wearing his pants low in a fashion statement, but one [Peterson] councilman is saying pull it up. He&rsquo;s even crafted a proposal to ban &#8220;baggy pants.&#8221;</p>
<p>Teenagers and even little ones and women are sporting the fashion. The &#8220;saggy&#8221; or &#8220;baggy&#8221; look, where pants are pulled down and boxers are exposed seems to be all the rage these days.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Councilman Anthony Davis tells teenagers to pull it up every day, and soon he&rsquo;ll be introducing a proposal that would make walking around like this in Paterson subject to fine under the city&rsquo;s indecency law.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re tired of seeing your behind,&#8221; Davis said. &#8220;We don&rsquo;t want to see your back side. We don&rsquo;t need to see your underwear. We don&rsquo;t need to see your drawers. Wear your pants.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But others fear a dress code in an urban area could lead to profiling by police and that government shouldn&rsquo;t be telling people what to wear.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cities have had a difficult time pushing through the baggy pants pans. In Irvington, N.J., a councilwoman recently had to pull her proposal after facing legal questions.</p>

			<p>Sorry, but this&rsquo;ll go nowhere. Even if the ordanance is enacted, it&rsquo;s unenforceable. Waste of time and energy, and of course, the Jersey taxpayers money of course. There is nothing done in Jersey without wastage of taxpayer money. Nothing!!! Wasting taxpayer money is a religion here in Jersey.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;could lead to profiling by police&#8221;. Profiling? The only people arrested are the ones actually wearing the sagging pants. There&rsquo;s no &#8220;profiling&#8221;. They&rsquo;re confusing  &#8220;profiling&#8221; with &#8220;observation&#8221;. Two different animals.</p>

			<p>The origin of baggy pants is from prisons where black inmates, in order to advertize themselves for sex, wore oversized drawers below their behinds.  They did it for money or sometimes, just for pleasure.</p>
<p>The baggy jackets and shirts also originated in prisons.  Oversized jacket and shirts made it much easier to hide weapons.  </p>
<p>Prison chic, as I call it, and some parents just don&rsquo;t care who their children emulate.  </p>

<p>Totally agreed. This is clearly in violation of civil rights, and an absolutely arbitrary law. This is typical of a nanny state.</p>

<p>THESE days? They&rsquo;ve been wearing this same &#8220;fashion&#8221; since the early 90s - none of the ghetto wear has changed at all in nearly 20 years.  Like rap, it&rsquo;s stuck in the time warp of stagnant non-creativity and promoted by people who contribute nothing worthwhile to society.  </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m not in favor of government enforced dress codes in general, this one included. I figure as much as it pains me to have to view a saggy sixty-something mowing his lawn shirtless or booty shorts on a 250 lb. sow, it&rsquo;s still better than letting the government make yet another decision for me.</p>
<p>That said, people with drooping pants tick me off. Had one sit down next to me at a truck stop a while back. No lie, his belt was literally six inches below his butt. The bottom of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bad enough that worthless slobs are and always will be among us. I wish they didn&rsquo;t feel the need to advertise it, too.</p>

			<p>I can understand Davis&rsquo;s frustration, but he has focused on a symptom, rather than the disease.  Perhaps Davis should propose legislation requiring that anyone wearing sagging pants accessorize properly by also wearing clown shoes.</p>

			<p>To the biologist, saggy pants are not public indecency but intimidation. They are intended as such and perceived as such and should therefore be treated as such. Oh, and regardless of the colour of the crack. (I mean, I cannot burn my own cross in peace, either (g))<br>
So, I´m on board with Randall and Councilman Davis.</p>

			<p>Often I just gape and marvel at how they manage to keep those baggy pants pants up. Safety pins?  Hidden suspenders?  There seems to be nothing  at all holding them in place. Once, in the library, I actually saw the pants fall off a &#8220;youth&#8221; who was coming down the stairs. He was lucky he didn&rsquo;t trip and fall. Most of the time it seems to be nothing more than a miracle holding them precariously in place.</p>

			<p>I understand the &#8220;sagging pants&#8221; nonsense has its origins in the penal institution and relates to sodomy. Only blacks would make a fashion statement out of behaviour and circumstances any other community would find disgusting, abhorrent and shameful. </p>

<p>Seth, you are a &#8220;thirtysomething,&#8221; and you have the poor judgement, stunted masculitity, maturity and taste to spout that drivel? &#8220;I have a great body&hellip;&#8221; Well, congratulations for being fit. I am a forty-three year-old, and where I grew up, when I grew up, physical fittness among most young men-hell, most women as well, was a given, and not too much to boast about. I guess the standards for your generation have dropped considerably, such that a man who is due for maturity and relaxed, unstrained masculinity, feels the need for the reinforcement of parading around like a retardate who had to have his mommy dress him (but who&rsquo;s mommy was not in that morning). <br>
Seriously, if you are in your thirties, it is time to be a MAN. <br>
I&rsquo;m 43, and being very fit, responsible, honest, outgoing, decent and masculine in an unpretentious way, gets me more attention from attractive women in their eearly thirties ant even mid twenties than I could have imagined. Why? <br>
For a start, I dont act, or dress like an idiot with such fragile self-esteem or questionable taste. The best and most desireable women-of any age, including younger women than I&rsquo;d get involved with- seek MEN, not boys. (My apologies to boys who yet have sense and self-esteem. <br>
Seth, sounds like you need a wake-up. Bedding a bunch of  degraded sluts isn&rsquo;t success. You want a real woman? Act like a real man.</p>

			<p>Why can&rsquo;t laws like this be enforced?  Indecent exposure is indecent exposure.  I don&rsquo;t want to see any ones butt, I don&rsquo;t care if its a white guy who can&rsquo;t figure out how to wear a belt or a black kid that thinks he is ghetto fabulous.  Standards have to be drawn somewhere.  Its bad enough that men go around without shirts on.  I don&rsquo;t care how great you think your body is, I do not want to see it. </p>

			<p>I DO NOT agree with the posters who don&rsquo;t see this as a big deal.  You don&rsquo;t want the government interfering in our lives?  Okay, is that what you are going to be saying once we have young people exposing their genitals as a fashion statement?  Seriously, a lot of the people in many third world countries are more civilized in this manner when it comes to modesty and decency than we are in the West.  At least the arabs know how to keep their behinds covered in public (no pun intended).  </p>
<p>Seriously, this shouldn&rsquo;t even be an issue.  And it is not just men with baggy pants; it is also women with tight low-rider jeans. We shouldn&rsquo;t be seeing the cracks of total strangers in public.  I personally don&rsquo;t see anything wrong with policemen walking around malls and telling both men and women to pull their pants up. If you think this exposure of intimate body parts is okay, then you are uncivilized.  Go live with the naked people in the Amazon if you want to see bare bottoms in public.  </p>

			<p>A &#8220;thirtysomething&#8221; who still sags his pants?  If I wanted a date with a 13 year-old single mother named Laquisha, sagging my pants would be the very FIRST thing I would do.  I&rsquo;d also start wearing balcaps - backwards of course - and get a few tattoos: probably some meaningless &#8220;tribal&#8221; designs or scribbles meant to look like Kanji characters.  The peurile image-obsession accidentaly touched on by Seth is a large part of why the US divorce rate is so high.</p>
<p>This may be &#8220;part of the culture&#8221; for thirtysomethings, but apparently so is spending thousands of dollars on wheel rims, car stereos and modified exhausts while living in one&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s basement.  Move out, sell the skateboard, and buy some polo shirts and Teva sandals.</p>

<p>Did I say anything about bedding sluts? I am a happily married man with three children 9, 7, 6. My wife is also a beautiful woman in geat shape. We take pride in our bodies.</p>
<p>However, I will say it again. Too many of you are making much adu about nothing here. The human body is not something to be ashamed of.</p>
<p>As I said, here in Venice, California it is part of the culture. Many people are in good shape and some in not so good of shape, but so what?  The human body is to be celebrated.</p>

			<p>Oh, come on.  Seeing a great big guy who walks like he&rsquo;s got poopy diapers is hilarious!  Better than anything that passes for comedy these days.   Especially since he thinks he looks &#8220;macho&#8221;.  Hahahahahaha!</p>
<p>How can you be angry at something that makes a guy look like a clown?  And the flat-billed baseball cap barely propped on the side of the head completes the clown image.  If it&rsquo;s a white guy, he looks even more ridiculous!</p>
<p>Back in the late 60s-early 70s the black guys in my town used to wear bluejeans, leave the top button on their pants open and their belt unbuckled with the ends hanging down their legs.  I think they wanted to look like they&rsquo;re ready for sex at any time. </p>
<p>Remember the backwards clothes fashion that didn&rsquo;t last too long?  The next fashion statement will probably be no pants at all or pants pulled way up into their cracks.  Whatever it is, it will be different and no doubt entertaining.<br>

			<p>Sure it&rsquo;s disgusting.  The solution is not more laws.  The solution is to just laugh at them and walk away.  Left on its own, such fads fade away.  With laws being proposed/passed to ban such behavior - it will not fade away because, in the shallow minds of youth, being outside the law only makes it more desirable.  You&rsquo;d think people would have learned by now that passing laws is about as effective in getting rid of bad behavior as passing gas is effective in getting rid of bad odor.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t know how we got Seth&rsquo;s body into this. The article is supposed to be about sloppy ghetto fashions, not physical culture and body builders. These are TOTALLY different things. Bulging biceps and exposed behinds are not the same! There is nothing wrong with a well-built man or woman; they have a right to be proud of their bodies, but we don&rsquo;t have to see someone&rsquo;s pants sliding off his bottom. (And most of these ghetto people are anything but well built anyway.)</p>
<p>PS. I agree with Jewaongyou that laughter is the best treatment. For ghetto youth, being placed outside the law only makes it seem more desirable.</p>

<p>The problem is we&rsquo;re talking about two different cultures here, flauting the body in two different ways within different environmental situations.</p>
<p>It sounds like you&rsquo;ve been pumping too much iron to notice what&rsquo;s going on in other parts of the country. You wouldn&rsquo;t want your kids around this. </p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t Gold&rsquo;s Gym start in Venice, CA? If this is correct, working out/weightlifting is a huge part of the resident&rsquo;s lifestyle,workforce, and interests. </p>
<p>-I also look good and I enjoy working out moderately. </p>

			<p>Yes. Gold&rsquo;s Gym was started in Venice, CA in 1965, quickly becoming known as &#8220;The Mecca of Bodybuilding&#8221;.</p>

			<p>I agree with those posters who feel that shunning and ignoring the wearers of such garb is the best way to go.</p>
<p>Having said that, those Bantus who say they&rsquo;re free to wear what they want, shouldn&rsquo;t foam at the mouth, if a Caucasian wants to wear a T-Shirt with the Confederate flag, a picture of Robert E. Lee or a picture of Albert Einstein with his e=mc(2) equation on it, along with the caption, &#8220;It&rsquo;s a White Thing - You Wouldn&rsquo;t Understand&#8221;.</p>

<p>It figures you were one of those left liberal leaning people with your advocacy for public nudity, dating or marrying people of different races, supporting open drug use, etc&hellip;</p>
<p>I guess George and others like me have their answer!</p>
<p>Trust me, you have no credibility on this website!</p>

<p>Seth, I do not think it was appropriate for him to have asked you. You owe him no answer.  Despite the notion of some, this is not a right-wing political site.   There is room here for everyone.</p>

<p>Obviously, you understand the freedoms and the constitution of our nation better than some of the other supposedly &#8220;American conscious&#8221; posters on this board.</p>

<p>The fact is that this is a website for racially conscious Whites and judging by his previous comments, Seth and some others do not represent such values!</p>

			<p>When I was a teenager in the 1950s we didn&rsquo;t need laws to keep our pants up, or to not put our shoes on backwards. It was a white world, and if I&rsquo;d walked around showing my underpants then, a good number of adults I passed would have told me to pull my pants up, in the certain belief that my parents would have supported their admonition. (Actually, if I&rsquo;d done anything so strange as walk around with my underpants showing, I don&rsquo;t know what people would have done. But you get the point  &mdash;  If a kid was behaving extremely improperly anywhere, and the kid&rsquo;s parent wasn&rsquo;t present, any adult might correct him.)</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s America, what adult would tell a teenager she doesn&rsquo;t know to pull his pants up? The adult might be sued by the teenager&rsquo;s mother, or cursed by the teenager or his mother, especially if the mother were black and the criticizing adult was white (even if the mother felt the same way about the pants!) </p>
<p>In the 1950s we didn&rsquo;t live in a society fractured into hostile groups. We lived in a homogeneous white society (the blacks were under control) with shared white standards of behavior, and everyone supported each other in maintaining those shared standards. Law didn&rsquo;t have to intrude into every human action and interaction  &mdash;  the common custom of a cohesive society sufficed.</p>
<p>Chase the immigrants out and get the blacks back under control, and we won&rsquo;t need laws for people to keep their pants up. (In the meantime, white kids of course shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to wear belts, because they could be used as nooses).</p>

			<p>not &#8220;appropriate for him to have asked&#8221; <br>
(What a girlie comment, and I&rsquo;m a girl!)</p>
<p>Conservatives don&rsquo;t have to be sensitive or afraid of what they believe. I can back up anything I say, always. I draw from examples and experience in my short time on this earth. </p>
<p>Liberals make things up as they go, so they will always face oppositon. They have no basis for the decisions they make, except that it benefits their way of thinking. </p>
