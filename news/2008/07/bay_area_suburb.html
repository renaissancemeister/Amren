						<p>Civil rights groups alleged in a federal lawsuit Wednesday that Antioch police have created a special unit to harass the rising number of black renters there who receive federal housing assistant.</p>
<p>The lawsuit originally was filed in San Francisco federal court in May by five renters, and was expanded Wednesday to seek class-action status for all past and present black recipients of federal vouchers in the East Bay suburb.</p>
<p>City officials are accused of creating a special police unit called the Community Action Team to run the new renters out of town by pressuring landlords and housing authority officials to evict black tenants receiving vouchers. The lawsuit also accused Antioch police of illegally searching tenants&rsquo; homes without search warrants.</p>
<p>Antioch officials released an unsigned statement Wednesday denying the allegations and defending the special police unit, which it said was created in July 2006 &#8220;in response to neighborhood demands for help in dealing with growing crime rates and persistent neighborhood problems.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Antioch, which is about 37 miles east of San Francisco, has been among the Bay Area communities hardest hit by the housing crisis, with home prices plummeting and foreclosures soaring.</p>
<p>Civil rights lawyers representing the tenants alleged in the lawsuit that more homeowners and speculators in Antioch are choosing to rent their houses to recipients of federal housing vouchers to help cover their mortgage payments.</p>
<p>In 2003, 1,049 families in Antioch received the vouchers, and last year that number swelled to 1,582, according to statistics cited in the lawsuit. A little more than half the voucher recipients are black and the city&rsquo;s black population has grown to roughly 15 percent of the city&rsquo;s 101,000 residents, the lawsuit said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The city has reacted with alarm and hostility to the newcomers, choosing to scapegoat them as the cause of economic downturn because they allegedly bring blight and crime into the community,&#8221; the ACLU alleged in the lawsuit.</p>

			<p>     I don&rsquo;t live far from Antioch and Blacks here in Stockton do bring blight and crime!  One day a teacher who I thought was liberal shocked me when he said that he was one of the lucky ones who moved out of Weston Ranch (Stockton suburb) before the &#8220;Dark ones messed up the whole area and brought car thefts&#8221; after bay area transplants from Oakland moved in.  We spoke in code for a while, but I was suprised at his admission -which had a concomitant disclaimer that &#8220;He didn&rsquo;t have anything against anyone, whether they were Black, Brown, Pink or whatever&#8221;.  <br>
     He said the final straw came when his house was finally broke into, to which he immediately moved to Manteca, which is more uniformly White in comparison.  <br>
     When it comes to their homes, Whites eschew politically correct indoctrination and vote with their feet.  It&rsquo;s a matter of survival&hellip;.</p>

			<p>Well,well, well&hellip; look at this! The so-called White liberals of the bay area who want to lecture the restof us aobut our supposed &#8220;bigotry and racism&#8221; when we want to keep our neighborhood middle class and safe are now choosing to target the &#8220;poor Black people&#8221; they supposedly champion and protect from us mean, hostile nasty White &#8220;bigots.&#8221;</p>
<p>These White liberals have shown themselves to be the hypocrites they have always been. </p>
<p>They make me sick!!!!</p>

			<p>Good for the cops.  I harrass subsidized renters in my area, too.  One group of them was using an inoperable, rusted-out van, parked in a public spot in our complex as a self-store shed.  I had that sucker towed.  Since they wouldn&rsquo;t pay the towing company, they didn&rsquo;t get it back.  They were also storing stuff that looked like trash on their patio.  I got them fined by the HOA for this breach of covenants, which their landlord had to pay to avoid having a lein placed on the unit.  They spent nearly every waking moment smoking cigarettes and talking on mobile phones on their front porch, probably making drug deals.  They and their friends used to speed through the neighborhood, going about 40 in a 15 mph zone.  I complained to the HOA after writing down license plate numbers.  Their landlord received another fine.  Their kids dug up some of the plants on the common grounds, so I planted poison oak after rooting cuttings in a bucket of water.  They had a series of loud parties, so I signed a noise complaint with the police.  They parked one of their vehicles in front of my garage, in an area marked &#8220;fire lane, no parking&#8221;.  The police towed that.  </p>
<p>The last time I saw the landlord, I told her that I did not pay $120,000 for a townhouse just so subsidized renters could turn the area into a slum.</p>
<p>The other homeowners like me here.  The renters think I&rsquo;m a nazi.  Good.  I would like to live in an area where renting is illegal.</p>

			<p>I just love how everything always comes down to white racism with them. If they were truthful with themselves they would acknowledge the fact that their well earned reputations for crime and violence is not without cause. This would also force them to face the fact that distrust for them goes well beyond the white community. Visit the Chinatown district any time, and see what I mean. Watch the faces of Chinese American shopkeepers when a couple of blacks walk in. They eye them the whole time they are there. Their feelings of discomfort can be detected in a glance. Notice also, how Indian Americans also, show the same look of distrust when they walk in their shops. Or how Middle Eastern cab drivers will keep driving when one of them is waiting on the curb. Is all this because white Americans have turned them against blacks? Or could it be a case of personal experience? Blacks refuse to take personal responsibility for their own bad reputations. They can try and shame us all for behaving the way we do around them, but those of us who are wise will never let our guard down around them.</p>

			<p>I find it very strange that whites would let the government destruct this country from neighorhoods, jobs, to education by catering to inferiority.  Can a white majority be ever again in this country?  If not then it will be a third world country  &mdash;  a nightmare.    </p>

			<p>What can you expect from the ACLU?  The organization is composed almost entirely of white(male)-bashing, hypocritical Leftist gasbags who&rsquo;ve got their heads up their behinds.  </p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t be satisfied until Western civilization is down the toilet&hellip; they&rsquo;ll smile smugly as their own houses are razed to the ground by gangbanger thugs.  &#8220;This is terrible,&#8221; they&rsquo;ll say, &#8220;but our privileged white racist society has had it coming forever.  Maybe NOW the whites (who survive) will realize that race REALLY IS only skin deep, and will interbreed with their beautiful brown brothers and sisters, thereby wiping the evil, ugly white gene from the face of the earth, curing all the ills of humanity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many Liberals REALLY think like that.  I&rsquo;ve heard them talk, and it&rsquo;s not much of an exaggeration.</p>

			<p>San Franciso is one of the most beautiful cities I have seen in America, between the rolling hills, the pacific ocean, and the gorgeous Golden gate bridge, and cable cars, it almost competes with many famous European cities. I am glad to hear it&rsquo;s citizens are trying to protect their beautiful city from crime an unrest. Too bad most cities don&rsquo;t operate in the same manner.</p>

			<p>I really must compliment Michael Scott for his very strong activism. This is what works, taking person to person action in the local area, front lines. Michael didn&rsquo;t whine or show fear or resort to stockpiling guns or waste his time trying to elect some 80 year libertarian a President of the United States. Instead he fought and has won battles in his own life/world.</p>
<p>Here are some other suggestions.</p>
<p>Mess with the low life non Whites by pretending to help them.<br>
 <br>
Sponsor Classical music education programs to expose the non Whites to spiritually  uplifting classical music.</p>
<p>Feature loud Classical music at sunset over loudspeakers. Set up chairs and notepads for the non Whites to come to hear, review the music. Make it look like a test and the worst non Whites fear, hate tests which they always fail.</p>
<p>Pass petitions to implement voluntary cress codes. The low life non Whites, hate dress codes and can&rsquo;t keep themselves clean.</p>
<p>With some time and persistence, your classical music education program will drive away the worst non Whites. They don&rsquo;t like to be improved, forced to change</p>

			<p>I believe that section 8 landlords are not allowed to rent to whites.  Renting a section 8 house to whites is &#8220;clear and present evidence of discrimination&#8221; as the vicious evil spawn of satan anti white Judges say.</p>
<p>Speaking of Chinese attitudes towards blacks.  </p>
<p>I had a neighbor, Chinese, who had a little day care center in her home.  She loved it.  It meant she could stay home with her toddler son and still bring in a decent income. She loved the kids and they loved her.  Years after she closed the center she still sent them christmas cards and presents.</p>
<p>She had an opening and advertised in the paper.  When she checked to see if her ad was there and correct, she noticed the little notice by DSS &#8220;It is against the law to baby sit in your home for money without a day care license.  To obtain a license call this number or come to this address.&#8221;</p>
<p>So she decided to make it legal and get the license.  The fire department inspection went fine, she and her husband and son got a negative TB test, no one had a criminal record.  So a social worker came talked her and gave her the forms.  Just fill them in and you&rsquo;ll get your license within a week.</p>
<p>So she read the forms.  She kept coming across the &#8220;no discrimination because of race, religion ethnicity etc.  She talked to her husband.  Then she came over and asked me &#8220;does this mean that if a black woman wants me to baby sit her kid I have to take the kid&#8221;?  </p>
<p>Well yeah </p>
<p>She decided to end the little day care center.  Her son was old enought for 1st grade.  She went to work in the family store which she really didn&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>At the time I really didn&rsquo;t see what harm a black toddler would do.  But now I know the blacks penchant for suing everyone and anyone, I would not baby sit a black child either; because one of those bogus lawsuits would bankrupt me, even if I won the legal fees would be disastrous.</p>

			<p>Whenever blacks are treated like everyone else, they squeal &#8216;racism&rsquo; like a pig. They have been trained to believe they deserve special rights.  They haven&rsquo;t learned that life isn&rsquo;t fair.  Maybe instead of teaching them Marxism, the system should teach them person responsiblity&hellip;.but I guess that would be &#8220;violating their rights&#8221;.</p>

			<p>It truly is awful to be disciplined for behavior most society finds disagreeable.  First, you are handed reduced rent.  You stuff as many relatives and friends that you can into a single family dwelling.  You park all your beat up, non operable vehicles up and down the street, you act foolish in public where other neighbors have to tolerate you, and no one should say a thing.  Not only should they tolerate you, they should then give you even more because they had the nerve to complain.  I wonder if this care will go before the extremely liberal Federal Court in San Francisco.  If so, its a done deal.  Personally, if I was white, and lived in this area, I would fly me a Confederate Flag.</p>

			<p>One has to wonder what goes thru the heads of these left-wing White liberals who have pushed the black sickos into our neighborhoods.  Cannot they see the havoc and horror these monsters create?  Burgularies, robberies, rapes, murders have become the norm for so many of these perpetual malcontents and now it&rsquo;s as though Whites are going to wait until they have us outnumbered to do anything about it  &mdash;  and then it will be too late! Critical mass is a heartbeat away.<br>

			<p>Black African criminality and destructiveness is so universal and so routine that one wonders why it would be considered newsworthy.</p>
<p>This is their behavioral pattern wherever they&rsquo;re found in substantial numbers, in every country, every continent, every city, every principality, and every village.</p>
<p>There are no exceptions to this universal pattern of failure and social and cultural destruction.  But of course there remains only one acceptable sociological explanation for this immutable pattern of black African failure, and that is white racism.  Of course, nobody, even the most strident and vocal proponents of this theory, really believe this any longer.  Even blacks don&rsquo;t truly believe it, though they&rsquo;ve become well-schooled in exploiting this fantasy.</p>
<p>It will interesting to how this all plays out when the white race is supplanted economically and militarily by more pragmatic and less &#8220;sensitive&#8221; great powers.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t want to be a sub-Saharan black African when the Chinese decide that they&rsquo;re inconvenient, annoying and superfluous.</p>

			<p>If you read the original article in the SF Chronicle (Sfgate.com) look at the comments.  You&rsquo;d think that they would be outraged by this supposed racism.  In fact, by a margin exceeding 10 to 1, the comments support the police and the citizens of Antioch.</p>

			<p>A few years ago China had an outreach program for blacks, mostly Africans, to attend free college along with room and board.  These were colleges located in Beijing.  Over the years the increasing crime and violence was tolerated by the government in return for the opportunity to plant the seeds of Marxism.  Finally even the government had enough.  Thousands of Chinese had been targets of crime, violence, rape, etc.  One day crowds of chinese men with pipes, nails through boards, knives, etc literally drove all the blacks through the streets towards the airport.  Chinese police prevented bloodshed by keeping the two groups apart but did not stop the blacks from being marched to the airport.  The African program was shut down and never reopened.</p>

<p>This is a totally racist and insensitive remark and would lead one to believe that we in the west are responsible for the setting of the sun, and thereby shrouding the world in darkness. I am outraged!!! I will riot, I will make demands.</p>

More than 9 out of 10 comments are from people who are absolutely fed up with blacks and the crime, blight, they bring with them. FANTASTIC!</p>

			<p>&#8220;the city&rsquo;s black population has grown to roughly 15 percent of the city&rsquo;s 101,000 residents, the lawsuit said.&#8221;</p>
<p>Time to flee Antioch.  The tipping point is 10 per cent black.  5-7 percent black, whether in the workplace, a school or a neighborhood is sustainable, although that 5-7 percent black cause 90 percent of the problems.</p>
<p>But it is best to flee before 10 percent is reached.  Antioch will soon be just another high crime dump lile Oakland and Richmond.</p>
<p>I was a Probation Officer in San Francisco for many years.  When I started, the black population was 8 percent.  The highest point the blacks ever reached in San Francisco was 11 percent in the 1970 census.  It has been declining ever since.</p>
<p>But even at 8 percent, blacks committed about 90 percent of the crime.  And blacks committed about 99 percent of the rapes in San FRancisco.<br>

			<p>One of those anti-black riots happened in Nanjing, China while I was there in 1987.  I got lost at night returning from a dance, a few evenings before, and the locals were nothing but helpful to me.  Boiled down, the problem the locals had with the African &#8220;students&#8221; - really just thugs with the right family connections - was rape.  Guys who are limited by law to one child tend to be a bit protective of their daughters.  Funny, that.</p>
<p>Mainland Chinese seem to like white Americans well enough, though as has been mentioned by other posters, they&rsquo;re not the biggest fans of US foreign policy.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I was a Probation Officer in San Francisco for many years. ..even at 8 percent, blacks committed about 90 percent of the crime. And blacks committed about 99 percent of the rapes in San FRancisco.<br>

Same on the East Coast.  I can no longer cite statistics but when I was in the NYPD it was about the same thing.  Almost ALL of the wanted posters were of blacks, the rest  being (dark) Hispanics  [ie. not Caucasian, although stastically counted as such].  </p>
<p>What few whites were rarely on posters, were almost always wanted for non-violent crimes like forgery or embezzlement, or sometimes child abduction    &mdash;   [of their own child &hellip;&#8221;custodian interference&#8221;].  Not always   &mdash;     but almost always.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The lawsuit noted that the Housing Authority for Contra Costa County, which manages the federal voucher program in Antioch, refused police-recommended evictions in 60 percent of the cases forwarded to them.&#8221; (from original article).</p>
<p>That means the Housing Authority evicted 40% of the persons recommended for eviction by the police. (To me the glass looks half-full, rather than half-empty).</p>

			<p>&#8220;This is a class issue.&#8221; (Posted by Gordon at 3:28 PM on July 18).</p>
<p>Okay. And a much higher proportion of blacks than of whites are &#8220;low-class,&#8221; and a much higher proportion of high-class blacks than of high-class whites have low-class relatives who will visit their high-class black relatives in your mixed neighborhood and rob you, and high-class blacks in mixed neighborhoods provide camouflage for other low-class blacks who will wander in and rob you. Unlike in Segregation days, when ANY blacks in white neighborhoods received close inspection. </p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>&#8220;Class&#8221; dismissed.</p>
<p>(P.S. Just because Marx said it doesn&rsquo;t make it true).</p>

			<p>P.P.S. Sorry, Gordon, I shouldn&rsquo;t have been so snitty  &mdash;  your post was informative. </p>
<p>But I wish those white elitists would take a larger view of the matter. If you can tell me that they feel perfectly safe from black criminals while taking evening walks in their mixed neighborhood, then perhaps my own views need some adjustment.</p>
