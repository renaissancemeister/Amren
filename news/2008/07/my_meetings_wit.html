				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Foster Friess, Foster Friess Blog, July 16, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I spent a long weekend in London meeting with a handful of prominent Iraqis, including two leading Shiite clerics. The group&rsquo;s mission is to memorialize the brutality that existed under Saddam Hussein and to create a museum akin to the Holocaust Museum.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On a visit to Hyde Park&rsquo;s Speaker&rsquo;s Corner, I engaged a British Imam. Here are a few highlights of our exchange:</p>
<p> * Should leaving the Islamic faith be punishable by death? His response, &#8220;In Britain, no, but in an Islamic state, yes.&#8221; In an Isalmic state, conversion to a different religion is considered synonymous with treason.</p>
<p> * Some people are concerned about Muslim immigrants not assimilating into the British culture. The Imam&rsquo;s response &mdash; &#8221;As Muslims we have fully integrated into British society, but we have no desire to assimilate to an inferior culture.&#8221; Ironically, Britain today has &#8220;reverse assimilation&#8221; as exemplified by the fact that British police sniffer dogs wear &#8220;booties&#8221; with rubber soles so as not to offend Muslims.</p>
<p> * On the Muslim who was found not guilty of beating his wife in a German secular court because it did not violate Shari&rsquo;a law, his response was, &#8220;Just as we punish our children to reprimand them, so too sometimes it is justifiable to reprimand our wives. It is our duty.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dining at the House of Lords, graciously hosted by Baroness Caroline Cox and Lord Malcolm Pearson, joined by my friend Gerard Batten, who ran for Mayor of London, we discussed the impact of political correctness on British culture. A UK judge recently said that Shari&rsquo;a law is permissible in domestic relationships, distressing women&rsquo;s rights advocates. Adding to this, the recent resolution passed by the United Nations, banning criticism of Islam and Mohammed, essentially making it akin to &lsquo;hate speech&rsquo;, drives all of us to discern what we can do, as private citizens on both sides of the pond, to maintain the free speech traditions we&rsquo;ve enjoyed in western civilization, and for which so many have died.</p>

			<a id="c475842"></a> 
			<p><br>
Our enemies could say openly, &#8216;our intention is to overwhelm you by numbers, slit your throats, and take possession of all you own&rsquo; and most white people would politely nod, thank them for their comments, and walk away without registering what they just heard.</p>
<p>As an example, this Imams described Briton as an &#8216;inferior culture&rsquo;. The next logical question to ask is why would you want to move here? And as a follow up, what are your future intention about dealing with this &#8216;inferior&rsquo; culture?</p>
<p>As I said, they tell us openly what their motives and intention are and our leaders press on with non-western immigration, tell us we&rsquo;re the problem, and assure us we can look forward to a  bright and peaceful future if we just learn to tolerate, celebrate, and embrace our petty differences.</p>
<p>The white man has gone mad.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Muslims have no desire to assimilate into Britain&rsquo;s &ldquo;inferior culture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, the multicults asked for it and they got it.  I hope they enjoy the violence and fighting set to continue on until they break apart into tribal entities just like the US.</p>

Absolutely right. The white man&rsquo;s gone mad   &mdash;   AND he&rsquo;s shrinking. </p>

			<p>I can&rsquo;t remember if it was Mark Steyn or Pat Buchanan who said that instead of outright attacking England via Blitzkreig, Hitler should have sent Nazi immigrants into England.  They could have refused to assimilate, spoken German, demanded German schools, preach the Nazi philosophy, and gradually infiltrate the government.  With enough Germans in England, Hitler or a subsequent leader could have demanded annexation like Austria or Danzig.  Sometimes I wonder if England would be better off&hellip;.oh never mind. </p>

			<p>Well said sbuffalonative.  Probably the reason the ruling elite doesn&rsquo;t care is that they plan on living in exclusive gated communities forever.  They figure neither they, nor their descendants, will actually suffer the consequences of their treasonous decisions.  Instead it&rsquo;s the rank and file working whites who will suffer and they&rsquo;ve made it abundantly clear they have no concern for the welfare of &#8220;those people&#8221;.</p>

			<p>The Mayan calendar predicts the world will end in 2012.  I&rsquo;m beginning to believe this might come to pass.  How can you hold off over a billion islamics when they are entrenched in Western countries everywhere, and these said countries capitulate to their every whim. I have a two year old beautiful, blond haired blue eyed son.  I cannot sleep. I&rsquo;m so concerned for his future.  I used to have nightmares about the USSR blowing us up with nukes when I was a kid in the 1970&rsquo;s.  These nightmares have now returned with the economy in its present state, and the fact that Obama will most likely be our next president.  God, I miss Reagan.  Some comforting words would be welcomed.</p>

			<p>If they consider Britain to have an inferior culture, then the only explanation for their presence here are that they are acting as shock troops in an invasion.</p>

			<p>I hope the Brits wake up soon. It seems like in the US whites have become so used to what minorities have done they don&rsquo;t care anymore. All our politicans have lied and stole from the American public and do continually. If Obama wins the election it will be a disaster for white America. If he looses the blacks will almost certainly be a source of trouble for quite awhile. Either way, hopefully white America will wake up to see what is happening around them and realize all these people want to do is destroy us from within. Liberals? They are the biggest traitors of all and sell out their own country.</p>

			<p>I am usually somewhat scornful of alarmists crying &#8220;The end is near!&#8221; but not this time. Everyone is worried about what will happen when Obama is elected, they had better be worried about what will happen if he is NOT. If by some rare chance Obama doesn&rsquo;t win the election this year, we, as Whites, had better all be armed and prepared for pandemic rioting, looting, murder, rape and mayhem in the streets of every American city. The black politicians and their white accomplices will start it and the politically unconcerned will join in for the sheer fun of rampaging unfettered and uncontrolled. </p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s obvious, or should be, what Freedom of Speech does. First and foremost it keeps the group that practices it Biologically Adaptive (This assumes that we as a species are biologically adaptive. It is probably not a wise assumption. After all, we&rsquo;ve never been biologically tested. Interestingly we are the only species that can conduct such testing, and yet, oddly, we the only species that has yet to be tested.  Why is that? Probably because we don&rsquo;t want to know the results of the test. What othe explanation could there be for this odd and never discussed fact?).</p>
<p>In any event, if those who practice Free Speech are or are not adaptive, the culture that refuses to update its relationship with itself and the world around it will render itself dependent on a culture that does, thereby making both mal-adaptive. And that is indeed the case.  This is exactly what is happening to the West. <br>
As long as this is tolerated we are in the position of the man who shoots himself in the foot before running a race and then, because he can&rsquo;t blame himself, blames the winner.  Only now, there IS no winner.</p>
<p>The other advantage of Freedom of Speech is the tremendous emotinoal, psychological and intellectual, ie; Spiritual satisfaction that comes from engaging in the quest for knowledge. Eliminating Free Speech so that one can live in a static lubberland, is to bar further inquiry and deprive Mankind of a viable and inspiring Intellectual and Spiritual life.</p>
<p>It is to kill the Soul of Man so that he &#8220;devote&#8221; himself to primitive cultures based on Blind Obedience to Authority.</p>

			<p>The pessimism that I constantly see on this website is uncalled for and it doesn&rsquo;t do us any good.  Start focusing on the positive and then go from there.  The far right is gaining ground in many European countries.  As things get worse, they will get more and more of the vote.  </p>
<p>In America we don&rsquo;t see the results as easily because we are a two party system. The fact of the matter is that there are thousands of white people who go to websites like Amren (and many others that are similar) every day.  I know, because some websites actually post the stats of their membership and traffic publicly.  As whites, we aren&rsquo;t given a political voice but we are given a voice on the internet. Let me ask you?  With the internet at your convenience to remain anonymous are you doing anything to spread the word or are you just whining?</p>
<p>And if Obama becomes president, it IS NOT the end of our race as some of you claim ( which is a ridiculous assertion).  No, things will only start to get better.  We need things like this to happen for more and more whites to wake up.</p>
<p>I think the future is positive.  Don&rsquo;t just stick to Amren.  There are many many many other websites out there giving the same message, and many of them go on and on about how traffic keeps increasing to their websites.  The one thing I don&rsquo;t like about Amren is that it DOES NOT inform us on its progress enough.</p>
<p>I can tell you one thing; keeping these pessimistic attitudes won&rsquo;t do any of us an iota of good.</p>

<p>This is as good an illustration of what I&rsquo;ve often refered to, here and elsewhere, about Family Systems. In an extraordinarily confusing time with so many points of view in circulation, Family Systems offers a very reliable model to help us understand Society.  Mostly I am thinking about the Sacred Cow/Scapegoat Dynamic.  In this case the Sacred Cow would be the Power Elite in the Gated Communities jewamongyou mentioned, as well as those groups they enable, of course.<br>
And for the Scapegoat we have &#8220;those people&#8221; which would be us.</p>
<p>Quite literally the ONLY solution is to understand what is happening, develop the appropriate defenses, and refuse to play the role, ever.  <br>
Admittedly easier said then done, especially since they are quite obviously forcing our hand, presumably so they can justify what they intend to do with us.  But I see no other alternative.  </p>

			<p>The best defense against extremist Islamic immigration is a good offense.</p>
<p>GIve offense. Offend them.</p>
<p>Try to do so in humorous, imaginative ways.</p>
<p>Just as Islamic nations have no women&rsquo;s rights, gay rights, rights for non Muslims, Islamic nations, violent, backward Muslims have no sense of humor. It is completely foreign to them. They don&rsquo;t know what to make of it, how to handle it. So, we must use humor to our advantage.</p>
<p>Make fun of these vile, ugly, backward barbarians. Do it with style and you will get a solid following from Whites who don&rsquo;t want to be a part of any hate, but will enjoy a good hearty laugh.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m a Jew, yet I raise my screaming voice, against discrimination of Shiites in the English world.</p>
<p>The case: The inventors of the English language, to name the stuff occasionally leaving their bodies through one of the lower apertures (Shiites never do it, of course), used a code-word, which sounds suspiciously close to Shiite. Consequently, too many Englishmen don&rsquo;t even bother neither differentiate their pronunciation or even make any practical difference between an actual Shiite and the actual sh&hellip; I mean, the stuff I&rsquo;m talking about. Too bad.</p>
<p>The solution. We, the honorable English spoken persons, MUST voluntarily: a) stop using the word sh&hellip; I mean, the code-word completely; and to succeed b) cease the shameful act itself, completely as well. </p>
<p>P.S. In case, some Englishmen have problem to keep the stuff safely in their inner compartments, they can relief themselves by becoming the actual sh&hellip; I mean, by converting into Shiitism (this is a scientific term for a lot of Shiite). </p>
<p>Please, accept this Amendment to The Bill of Rights as my contribution gratis.<br>

<p>If anyone has seen Sean Connery&rsquo;s movie &#8220;Zardoz&#8221; that is how things may look in the future or read the book titled &#8220;Farnham&rsquo;s Freehold&#8221; I forgot the author but it is a Sci-Fi book which would appear to be about to come true.</p>

			<p>So what?  Who wants them to assimilate?  Who cares what they think of British culture?  There is but one issue:  get out of lands in which you do not belong.  I&rsquo;d give this as advice to George Bush and to the Londonistan Imam.</p>

			<p>&#8220;As an example, this Imams described Briton as an &lsquo;inferior culture&rsquo;. The next logical question to ask is why would you want to move here?&#8221;</p>
<p>They move there for economic reasons only, because they can make more money, either that or get welfare and have a higher standard of living. They are just using the &#8220;infidel&#8221; for what they can get out of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;And as a follow up, what are your future intention about dealing with this &lsquo;inferior&rsquo; culture?&#8221;</p>
<p>Their future intentions are to suppress and eliminate this &#8220;inferior&#8221; culture and replace it with their own.<br>

			<p>British society is now fractured.</p>
<p>There are the liberal multiculturalists - and the rest of us.</p>
<p>Increasingly we are leaving the cities or emigrating. The support for the BNP grows at a pace - the British are being radicalised. People are refusing to sign up to the arnmed forces (they are now having to recruit from Jamaica!) because we no longer know what their is to fight for when our troops die in Iraq and Afghanistan (protecting the poppy crop that is killing a generation at home) whilst our streets are overun by muslims, blacks and gypsies - while the Politically Correct Policeforce looks on.</p>
<p>Its like a pressure cooker - and we all know what happens when the pressure gets too much!</p>
<p>Then the time for civilised discussion will be past - action will be the name of the game.</p>
<p>Bloodshed and mass deportations from the UK and Europe will happen - it will all be the fault of the marxists in Labour and the idiots in the media. </p>
<p>And not before time.</p>
<p>We want Europa back in the hands of Euopeans.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Muslims have no desire to assimilate into Britain&rsquo;s &ldquo;inferior culture.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is typical of the mass media, now that they are completely, unabashedly organized around evil. &#8216;Western values are under attack&rsquo;. They are just trying to get us to defend the undefensible: their sick, drug induced sex crazed moral-free multicultural (racist) society. </p>
