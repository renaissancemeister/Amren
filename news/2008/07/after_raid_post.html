<h1><a href="/articles/2008/07/29/news/local/doc488f087b0808e054400879.txt">After Raid, Postville Deals With Somali Immigrants</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, July 29, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Scores of Somali immigrants are taking jobs at the nation&rsquo;s largest kosher meatpacking plant, replacing Hispanic workers arrested in a huge immigration raid and forcing a remote Iowa town to make another cultural shift.</p>
<p>Before the May 12 raid at Agriprocessors, hundreds of Mexican and Guatemalan immigrants maintained a vibrant community in Postville, a largely white community of 2,200 people in northeast Iowa.</p>
<p>Now the stoops and haunts once occupied by Hispanics are being filled by about 150 Somali men.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He said he also appreciates the city&rsquo;s small-town charms.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not like Minneapolis &mdash; too many people, too many cars,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I like small towns. I am small town guy, so this is nice place. Maybe I can raise family here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The influx of Somalis has been met with some surprise in a community still bewildered by the Agriprocessors raid, the largest raid of its kind in the United States. Federal agents arrested 389 people, mostly Guatemalans and Mexicans who had established roots and become part of the community.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the first cultural change in Postville. The slaughterhouse attracted eastern Europeans in the 1990s, including immigrants from Bosnia, Poland, Russia and former Soviet Republics. Hispanics became the majority in the last decade.</p>
<p>The result is that a town that barely covers two square miles is home to people from 24 nationalities speaking 17 languages.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>That runs counter to stories told by workers at the plant who described pay before the raid as $10 an hour or lower with no extra for overtime. Some also claimed the plant hired underage employees and forced its workers to endure unsafe conditions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Regardless of previous claims, Hassam Jilmale said he left work at a Tyson plant in Nebraska because he heard he could make more money with better conditions at Agriprocessors.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many of the Somalis who have come to Postville are legal immigrants with roots in Minneapolis, which has one of the nation&rsquo;s largest concentrations of Somali immigrants.</p>
<p>Hassan Mohamud, a Somali native who works as a legal advocate at The Legal Aid Society in Minneapolis, said the young men leave because low-skilled factory jobs are scarce in the Twin Cities and they need to provide for their families.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>No new businesses or mosques have opened in Postville to support the new community, but residents said they are leery about adjusting to another foreign culture even as the outcry over the May raid lingers.</p>
<p>The raid made Postville an unlikely flashpoint in the immigration debate. On Sunday, about 1,000 people, including many Postville residents, marched through the city&rsquo;s streets to protest the immigration raid and Agriprocessors&rsquo; treatment of employees.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The new Somali residents seem fine, but he fears there is only so much upheaval the town can take.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re just always adjusting and it&rsquo;s scary, it&rsquo;s hard,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We get all these new people and we don&rsquo;t know who they are.&#8221;<br>

			<p>Be afraid, very afraid.  </p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know anything about Somalis, do your research.  They come from a clan culture which prizes large male-dominated families. In Britain, Somali families are notorious for use of social services for their 5 - 7 children, as well as unemployment.  The second-generation boys are drawn to gangs, knives, and drug-dealing.</p>
<p>They currently have established themselves in many Western countries, but all maintain ties through the clans to the inter-Somali conflicts in the homeland. </p>

			<p>If Postville enjoyed Agriproccesors&rsquo; illegals, they&rsquo;re gonna love their muslims.</p>
<p>Won&rsquo;t be long until the humility disappears and the demands begin.</p>
<p>Hope they enjoy the prayer calls. The mosques. CAIR. The ACLU. The media circus and most of all, the lawsuits.   </p>

			<p>There are a number of Somalis in my part of town in Southern Cal, and they are one of the less troublesome minority or immigrant groups. African Americans didn&rsquo;t like or get along with them  &mdash;  African Americans don&rsquo;t like or get along with ANYONE afterall  &mdash;  and were suprised to find they fought back in large numbers when provoked.</p>
<p>Once that settled down, the Somalis fit in pretty well. They seem to carry a certain amount of self control that comes from the knowledge that they&rsquo;re living in a much better place than the one they came from. The women are quiet and ladylike as blacks go. Some of the guys could use a lesson in deodorant application, but still I&rsquo;d rather have them around than African Americans anyday!</p>

<p>All efforts should be expended doing whatever is necessary to uproot that evil business out of their area.  Besides being a point of horrendous cruelty to animals, it is a draw for all the riff raff this country brings to its shores.</p>

			<p>There is truly no such thing as a legal Somali.  Deport those racist africans.  They don&rsquo;t belong in America.  Mexicans have indigenous roots in this hemisphere.  Somalis are foreign invaders who steal America&rsquo;s resources.  Out!</p>

<p>Another &#8220;vibrant community&#8221;?   Oh, no!   It seems that every wretched, run-down, non-white community is considered &#8220;vibrant&#8221; when ther&rsquo;s nothing else left to say for it.</p>
<p>And, btw, I wonder how those Somalis (Moslems all) like working for their Jewish bosses. (Nothing said about that.) Strange alliances indeed!</p>
<p> <i>&#8220;The [tiny] town that barely covers two square miles is home to people from 24 nationalities speaking 17 languages.&#8221; </i></p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s  &#8220;Diversity&#8221;  for you!   The bosses finally got what they wanted.  Hope they like it.</p>

<p>  The cheap labor crowd will do anything to keep from paying a living wage. This is 1900 sweatshop labor all over again. I&rsquo;d rather not have either group, but forced to choice, I&rsquo;d rather have the Hispanics.  </p>

			<p>Why is it that minority communities are always referred to as &#8220;vibrant&#8221; in the mainstream media?  Every minority community, other than Asian Chinatowns, that I have seen has been a dump.</p>

			<p>Preferably, I would want neither illegal Hispanics nor legal Somalis in the country, though given the choice I&rsquo;d pick the Hispanics over clannish, warring black Muslims. Sad how when these Americans try to clear out there immigrant problem they just get hit with something worse. Out of the frying pan and into the fire, so to speak. The nation-dismantlers control everything, you just can&rsquo;t win against them, seems. &#8220;General quagmeyer&#8221; needs to go check the statistics on Somali immigrants. They are about the worst of all groups in the United States. They are worse than the native African-Americans, not better, as he claims. They are certainly not &#8220;one of the less troublesome immigrant groups&#8221;.</p>

			<p>It isn&rsquo;t a matter of either/or.  It is a matter of Washington driving whites into the minority and flooding the country with malable third world slaves who are much easier to control.  Our enemies are these alien imports and the politicians who allow them in.  If we continue to act like this we will lose this nation forever&hellip; </p>

			<p>  Why prefer one over the other. Both are undesirable. How about paying Americans a decent wage. Also get blacks off welfare and make them take the jobs at a desirable wage. </p>

			<p>If you look carefully at the problem of illegal aliens and their massive influx into the US, you&rsquo;ll often find corporate interests solidly behind it all.  Why should corporations pay wages acceptable to working class Americans, when they can exploit the millions of illegals in the country, and lobby Congress to continue ensuring that our immigration enforcement is sufficiently lax to allow them to minimize wages and maximize their own profit?  If we want to tackle the problem of illegal immigration, we have to focus on the corporations which are causing the problem through their exploitation of cheap Third World labor, both here and abroad.  We have to both staunch the flow of the illegal labor pool, lessen the legal immigration of enormous numbers of Third World poor and uneducated people, and work against corporate interests in exploiting people in such a manner as undermines our economy and our nation.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;Mexicans have indigenous roots in this hemisphere.&#8221;</p>
<p>If that were the deciding factor we wouldn&rsquo;t be here.</p>
<p>&#8220;The cheap labor crowd will do anything to keep from paying a living wage.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aint&rsquo; that the truth.  The Mexicans started asking for wayyyy to much money, probably 6-7 dollars and hour so that had to bring over poorer more backward people.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Many of the Somalis who have come to Postville are legal immigrants&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes&hellip;and as for the others, who aren&rsquo;t legal immigrants???? Get them the heck out of here. </p>
<p>A town with an area of 2 square miles and a population of only 2000, has 150 Somalis?????? Holy smokes. God help the people of Postville.   </p>

			<p>So many of the comments already posted seem to have the assumption that many of the residents of Postville actually wanted all of these immigrants. The meatpacking plant Agriprocessors is owned by Hasidic Jews from elsewhere. You can read Stephen Bloom&rsquo;s book &#8220;Clash of Cultures&#8221; about Postville to get a good picture. And try to find the local newspapers online or read KCRG.com for news or the Cedar Rapids Gazette or the Waterloo Courier.</p>

<p>&gt; One might think that it ought not to be an either/or choice.  We have plenty Americans with no jobs and no place to live.  Pay a decent wage and Americans will come.  The Fed would save money if they rounded up jobless Americans and required these businesses to hire (native born) Americans first.  </p>

			<p> If working conditions are worse at the Tyson plant from what I&rsquo;ve read the Tyson plant must be hell on Earth!<br>
 Why does America have to shelter all these refugees anyway?<br>
Doesn&rsquo;t it make more sense to leave them in their home countries so they can change some of the worse regiems in the world if we take in all dissadents of tyrants the tyrants have no need to respond to the peoples demands and how long until we&rsquo;re over-run by the hordes of desperate people?<br>
 Doesn&rsquo;t this seem to be the core reason for the exodus of people from all parts of the third world and when will the American people finally scream enough?</p>

			<p>Here in Tucson we have a large number of Somalians brought here under refugee status. I can&rsquo;t mention my job, but I have close contact with them. They are dreadful people with a stone-age mentality.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what I thought when I read this. The first thing that popped into my mind was &ldquo;out of the frying pan and into the fire.&rdquo;<br>

<p>And I agree too.    <br>
Ah, but the plant bosses must be VERY pleased with this development.  After all, this only increases the DIVERSITY even more.  And by their standards, the more diversity, the better.   A diverse America is a safe America.   <br>
Well, we&rsquo;ll see anyway.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;Once that settled down, the Somalis fit in pretty well. They seem to carry a certain amount of self control that comes from the knowledge that they&rsquo;re living in a much better place than the one they came from&hellip;.&#8221;</p>

<p>General:</p>
<p>Yes, the first-generation hispanics often start out the same way as well  &mdash;  humble, grateful, quiet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the second, third (and so on) generation that become the problem.  Once they are steeped for several decades in their free government-sponsored anti-White education they become angry, bitter, anti-White and demand &#8216;their fair share of the pie!&rsquo; that racist Whites have kept from them.</p>
<p>After all, they&rsquo;ve been taught repeatedly, economics is a zero-sum game, designed by Whites to keep them down, and, the US was &#8216;built on the backs of immigrants.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This is the case in California where I live, the second and third generation of hispanics sinking even further below the first  &mdash;  of course, there is a race-based government-funded grievance group to meet their every need, file law suits against Whites and organize voter drives to &#8216;take over the government&rsquo; as they&rsquo;re doing in California.  They will vote themselves services, of course.</p>
<p>I think Pottsville will rue the day these Somalis set foot in their formerly White city  &mdash;  in 20 years, and on into the future, when Somalis&rsquo; extremely low IQs of 70 do not allow them or their seven children to progress or &#8216;get their fair share&rsquo; there is going to be Hell To Pay.</p>

<p>Zero sum means that there is a fixed (limited) amount of wealth, like on a lifeboat.  Imagine ten in a lifeboat.  One evil one waits till others are asleep, then steals and hides food.  This leads to starvation of one or two others.  The bad guy represents capitalism, or USA, or self-interest.  This guy must be destroyed, in order to free the rest.</p>
<p>Now, it is true, ON A LIFEBOAT, there is only so much to go around.  What the bad guy did is evil, and murder.</p>
<p>Socialists, all of them I presume, believe the world is like a lifeboat, with only so much to go around.  (It may have been, almost, up until the industrial revolution).  Many folks &#8220;think&#8221; (being generous here) that the colonists tripped over this &#8220;wealth warehouse&#8221;, housing all the Corvettes and Cadillacs, and sequestered these goodies (and all the others), AND HELD THEM BACK FROM THE PEOPLE OF COLOR.  Now is getting even time&hellip;</p>

<p>US forces were ordered by bill clinton to intervene in somalia, ostensibly to relieve famine, and look what we get?</p>
<p>The US intervened in iraq and can now expect 100s of thousands, if not millions of iraqis to make their way to the US.</p>
<p>The moral of the story is;</p>
<p>Avoid &#8220;blowback&#8221;, cease foreign intervention!</p>

Yes, and on the backs of of blacks also!(And Somalis are both.)</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re  entirely right. I too have noticed that. The first comers are just glad to be here; they want no trouble. The second generation just takes it all for granted; they want &#8220;their share of the pie&#8221;. And they intend to get it By Any Means Necessary.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..<br>
Mme. Smythe, you put it extremely well.  It probably was so, pre-industrially. </p>
<p>Not only socialists think that way either.  I have found in Third World countries (and among Third World peoples &hellip; eg. certain groups living right here) that this is the prevailing point of view.  They have  no concept of wealth as something which is CREATED by human labor and ingenuity. They view wealth as something which is just THERE &hellip;  like a gold vein or an oil field.   No one created it.  To them, if you possess any wealth, it is only because you TOOK it from someone else.  And rich countries are those that stole their wealth from poor countries.  It&rsquo;s all a matter of the strong bullying the weak. Or cheating them. Hence Mexico&rsquo;s resentment of the US: everything we have, we  <i>stole </i> from them!   We are rich because we made them  poor. Their poverty is all our fault. This is all so simplistic!  But it appeals to the simple, childlike minds of these unsophisticated peoples.  And it is very easy for radicals of all stripes to play upon such naivety for their own purposes.</p>
<p>In short, they see no connection between work and wealth.   In fact, in their countries, the rich do no work while the poor do all the work. This is how it is in Africa, Arabia,  much of Latin America, etc.  They can&rsquo;t understand  anything otherwise.  Marxists fan this resentment.</p>

<p>Yes, exactly my point!  This is what high school and college students believe because this is what is explicitly taught by  Marxist teachers directly from socialist-written textbooks (the only ones available)  &mdash;  if it is taught at all. Zero-sum as been the main theme in history and economic textbooks for three decades now.</p>
<p>Non-Whites have absolutely no idea about the meaning of private property, limited government, how businesses work, how wealth is created  &mdash;  they believe the rich became that way at the expense of non-Whites, cheating and stealing their way to the top.  </p>
<p>Worse, they believe the government is there to even the playing field, tax the rich out of their ill-gotten gains, and punish the producers  &mdash;  in other words, Government is God.  And the more government, the more force the better.  Especially if it is used to punish Whites, take their property, redistribute their land.</p>
<p>Low IQs only allow for limited understanding of how economics and financial systems work  &mdash;  low IQ types respond to slogans, anecdotes, simplistic explanations as to why they&rsquo;re poor and miserable  &mdash;  is it not easier to blame someone else, especially if that someone else is White? </p>
<p>That belief combined with a fiat currency is pointing toward doom for the US economy.  How long before our dollars become worthless pieces of paper?</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Socialists, all of them I presume, believe the world is like a lifeboat, with only so much to go around&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the prevailing wisdom in the educational-industrial complex today-and government force is to be used to settle the score.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal is to achieve power over Whites, of course. Little do they realize that by destroying Whites, they are destroying themselves as well.</p>
<p>This is also why I keep posting:  Get your kids out of the government-is-good schools, get them out now, and don&rsquo;t look back.</p>
<p>I did.</p>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
 Isn&rsquo;t that remarkably like the &#8220;cargo cults&#8221; of some primitive New Guinea tribes!   They haven&rsquo;t the vaguest idea of where all these  white people&rsquo;s things come from or how the white people got them, so they think  it must be brought by a big metal bird from the sky. So they pray  and wait for a big bird to come and bring  some goodies to them. </p>
<p> Here, our primitive-minded  ghetto types, just as unsophisticated about economics and production, residing not in New Guinea jungles but in big city  jungles (called projects) have much the same attitudes.  Food comes from the supermarket. Wealth comes thru the mail in the form of a check from the Welfare Department.  Their minds remain as simple as those of four-year olds. Why are they poor? Because the White Man is keeping them down.  He&rsquo;s greedy and refuses to share the country&rsquo;s wealth.    Obama, the Messiah, is going to correct that.  He will take from the White Man and make him share.</p>
<p>Just look at those typical examples in New Orleans during Katrina, passively waiting for days while making no effort to help themselves:   &#8220;Why doesn&rsquo;t the god-damn government come and  do something for us?  When is somebody going to come and save us?&#8221;</p>
