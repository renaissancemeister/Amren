						<p>With oil prices at record highs, government coffers in the world&rsquo;s eighth biggest oil exporter are swollen to unprecedented levels.</p>
<p>Yet the vast majority of Nigeria&rsquo;s 140 million people live in no better conditions than their neighbours in West Africa, the least developed region of the world&rsquo;s poorest continent.</p>
<p>The same is true of many of Africa&rsquo;s major oil producers &mdash; including Angola, Sudan, Equatorial Guinea and Chad &mdash; but Nigeria&rsquo;s sheer size and 2-million-barrel-per-day output make the poverty-wealth contrasts more striking.</p>
<p>Nigeria has earned the equivalent in today&rsquo;s terms of nearly $1.2 trillion from oil production over the past four decades, the sort of money that enabled oil-producing Gulf states like Qatar to develop some of the strongest economies in the Arab world.</p>
<p>But its four state-owned refineries are not fully operational, largely due to mismanagement and vandalism, its distribution network is chaotic, and it relies heavily on fuel imports, which cost around $4 billion each year.</p>
<p>In Lagos, a mega-city of more than 10 million people, the elite sip champagne on exclusive islands &mdash; albeit to the incessant drone of diesel generators &mdash; while the masses live in mainland slums without water or electricity.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Healthcare is virtually non-existent, the roads are potholed, unemployment and crime are on the rise, and Nigeria is suffering from spiralling food prices.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The government has frozen the price of fuel but retailers have taken advantage of short supplies to more than double the price of diesel in some parts of Nigeria in the last few months.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nigeria&rsquo;s generation capacity has plunged to less than 1,000 megawatts from 3,000 MW a year ago, largely due to lack of maintenance at power stations. South Africa, with a third of Nigeria&rsquo;s population, has over 10 times that capacity.</p>
<p>Much of Nigeria goes without power for weeks at a time. The crisis has closed hundreds of factories and slashed millions of jobs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A committee he set up to review the sector said last month Nigeria needs $85 billion to meet its domestic power demand, estimated at roughly 20,000 MW.</p>
<p>That dwarfs the $10 billion former President Olusegun Obasanjo spent on the sector during his eight-year tenure, an amount which failed to deliver on his pledge to raise capacity to 10,000 MW by the end of 2007.</p>
<p>A parliamentary probe showed more than $50 million of that money had been paid to non-existent companies.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lagos state governor Babatunde Fashola has acknowledged the problems and said the state must spend more than $700 million over the next five years to improve the road network alone.</p>
<p>Nine out of 10 Nigerians live on less than $2 a day, their lives blighted by poor infrastructure and a lack of public services resulting from decades of endemic corruption.</p>

			<p>Another failed African state that has wealth beyond the dreams of people the world over, yet as time goes by they become poorer and a larger division grows between the rich and poor.  Just like Mexico.</p>
<p>South Africa and Rhodesia, two of the most prosperous countries on earth under white rule have become hell holes of crime, poverty, aids, and out-of-control violence, as well.</p>
<p>Africa likely will become a colony for China, since the Chinese will be forced to acquire available resources there.  It won&rsquo;t be possible to feed their billions on the depleted resources of their country.  A population as large as China will eat up millions of square miles of food and will drink entire rivers dry, and their land will not be able to sustain their growing population much longer.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking for China to gradually move into Africa where they will easily gain control from the incompetent, corrupt black governments and finally reach a point where the blacks will all be living in slums, while the Chinese population lives in gated communities.  And any insurrection will be handled with no non-nonsense ruthlessness.  </p>
<p>There might even be a mysterious drop in the black population, leaving the rest of the world wondering what happened to cause the near extinction of an entire people.</p>

			<p>Yeah&hellip;basically, they are screwed.  If you are the type of person who tracks such things, oil has been preparing itself for a crash.  Last week, it showed very strong signs that crash is about to begin.  With Congress poised to vote in flexfuel, I suspect that oil will eventually drop to about $50 a barrel and stay there&hellip;permanently.  From there, it will slowly decrease in value as fossil fuels are phased out in favor of better sources of energy.</p>

			<p>Obama has already stated that he wants to increase immigration from Africa.  Just what we need, uneducated people coming en masse, going directly on the welfare rolls.  The bottom 45 per cent of taxpayers already pay zero federal income tax.  A taxpayer voting for Obama will probably be as likely as chickens voting for Colonel Sanders.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Nigeria&rsquo;s generation capacity has plunged to less than 1,000 megawatts from 3,000 MW a year ago, largely due to lack of maintenance at power stations. South Africa, with a third of Nigeria&rsquo;s population, has over 10 times that capacity.&#8221;</p>
<p>The dirty little secret is that South Africa&rsquo;s power production has also decreased steadily since black rule and continues to do so. Why? When the ANC took power they began AA and BEE (affirmative action and black economic empowerment). These corrupt and destructive programs pushed tremendously skilled white technicians and field maintenance engineers out of their jobs to be replaced by mainly incompetent blacks. For the record, the entire SA economy, in all sectors public and private, is and was subjected to coercive black takeover irrespective of competence levels. Result? Nearly a quarter of skilled white South Africans have fled to Australia, New Zealand, the UK, etc. etc. South Africa&rsquo;s power monopoly, Eksom, not only cannot keep up with electricity demands they cannot even keep up with maintenance.</p>
<p>In 1994, the ANC was handed a bright shining diamond in the form of a 1st world infrastructure and economy and all they have proven since is that black stewarship can even crush a diamond into worthless dust. Destruction is the only skill black Africans where have shown true professionalism. They should all be in the demolition business. It comes naturally to them.</p>

			<p>With arguably Nigeria being the MOST CORRUPT country on this planet&hellip; where&rsquo;s the surprise? Nigeria, after all, gives us all these wonderful Internet scams. It figures the oil money will be stolen from the Nigerian people by its corrupt government &#8220;officials.&#8221;</p>

			<p> There are examples of blacks squandering the industrial projects built by whites. There was a huge sugar processing plant in Uganda built by the French. The french stayed a couple of years to &#8220;train&#8221;the natives to run it. Six months after the french left the plant shut down because a motor on one of the pumping lines failed. ONE FREAKING MOTOR! The plant stayed closed for over a year until a french guy&hellip;.ON VACATION&hellip; saw what was wrong, made a phone call and had a new motor fedexed in a couple of days. Of course by this time many other pieces of equipment had rusted and many other pieces were looted. Im not sure what the outcome of the plant eventually was, but I bet there are some nice trees and plants growing out the middle of it by now.<br>
  Its just laughable. Africans are completely unable to maintain a western type civilization. No surprise that Zimbabwe and South Africa are slowly rusting away because the blacks cant be bothered to change the oil<br>
  A friend of mine works as a mechanic at a dealership, he just laughs at grown black men bringing in a smoking car that he ruined because there was no oil. Dumba$$es thinking the &#8220;check engine&#8221; light means open the hood and see if the motor is still there.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Squandered Oil Wealth Leaves Nigeria in Dark Age&#8221;</p>
<p>I disagree with that. Not about them being in a &#8216;Dark Age&rsquo; I suppose&hellip; I do believe whites can be proud of the advances that have been picked up by Africa. I do know Africa is having a terrible time with all the wars there now. In my opinion oil revenue is not being squandered. In my opinion, these nations, with the silly &#8216;internet scams&rsquo;, and stories like these, are willing participants in a real scam, which is the propagation of a kind of soft white supremacy idea. Why, I&rsquo;m not sure. It probably is a good thing large numbers of people are not wastefully using too many resources.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure. Whites have enough social problems of our own and I don&rsquo;t think we should be ignoring them or allow ourselves to be distracted from fixing them.  </p>

&hellip;And as if all that isn&rsquo;t bad enough, consider that the formerly Christian nation of Nigeria now also faces massive Muslim population growth and aggressive Islamic expansionism. </p>

<p>    The Nigerians may not have a long term horizon in economics but (unlike the Norwegians) sure do in ethno-racial interests (where it matters the most).  Norway is inviting hordes of third world refugees to share the fruits of the hard work and planning of their ancestors, Nigerians simply kidnap and kill foreigners. Norwegians hardly have two children; the average Nigerian has about five. If you ask me it is the Nigerians who are winning the Darwinian struggle.</p>

			<p>I was in nigeria working the &#8216;oil patch&rsquo; in the early sixties during the biafran &#8216;war&rsquo; (genocide) time. I, and other xpats, witnessed first hand the incompetence, corruption, laziness, pollution, waste (gas was simply flared off to facilitate oil extraction), lack of schools, clinics, roads, sewage plants, good drinking water and 24 hour/day electricity supply. Gowan was in power at the time making all the usual promises of what he was doing with all the oil revenue and we thought things could only get better. Well, I&rsquo;ve been wrong many times, but to see that nigeria has steadily got worse every single year since I was there just beggars belief. I really can&rsquo;t understand how the White farmers thrown out of zimbabwe are making a living in nigeria. Perhaps the generals are just waiting for them to do all the hard work setting up before doing a &#8216;mugabe&rsquo; on them. </p>

			<p>Nigeria is a country who&rsquo;s oil wealth leaves it no reason to be poor, except that it is the most corrupt country on the planet, according to Transparency International.</p>
<p>And Western whites are endlessly accused of &#8220;stealing&#8221; from Africa.  Would any of the regular black posters who sling accusations of &#8220;theft frm Africa&#8221; care to comment about corrupt Nigerian businessmen and politicians socking billions of oil dollars away in Swiss bank accounts?</p>
