<h1>No Power to the People</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Roger Clegg, National Review Online, July 29, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Ward Connerly, Jennifer Gratz, and the state leaders in Colorado, Arizona, and Nebraska have collected enough signatures to put civil-rights ballot initiatives before the voters there this November. These initiatives will ban preferences based on race, ethnicity, and sex &mdash; a.k.a., affirmative action &mdash; in public contracting, education, and employment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Accordingly, the opponents [e.g., the group By Any Means Necessary, or BAMN] have done their best to torpedo the signature-gathering process by, well, any means necessary. Step one is to send its &#8220;blockers&#8221; to wherever petitions are being distributed. Additionally, a hotline is helpfully provided so that tips about people circulating petitions can be forwarded and the blockers dispatched.</p>
<p>Then the real fun begins. Shouting at the people distributing the petitions, lying about what the measure would do, and abusing and defaming everyone who disagrees with them is old hat for the blockers by now. Petty and not so petty assaults follow. [Even] the state&rsquo;s liberal media &mdash; no friend of the initiatives themselves &mdash; have condemned it.</p>
<p>The latest twist is that BAMN has now been caught on tape trying to bribe the signature-gatherers into turning the collected signatures over to BAMN, presumably so that they can be destroyed. BAMN has also tried secretly to submit bogus signatures itself, so that it can then point to them and challenge the whole effort as defective.</p>
<p>The initiative opponents include both white-collar and blue-collar thugs. The former are, in Colorado, attempting to derail the process by putting on the ballot a counterfeit measure, which looks just like the real thing, except it includes a sentence buried at the end that negates the rest of it.</p>
<p>And the white-collar allies sometimes include government officials. In one state, the petition itself was distorted in its official description (overturned by a court ruling), and later petition circulators were arrested for picketing on public property (such as in front of a public library and on public sidewalks).</p>
<p>Who are these people, and who is behind them? Well, in addition to BAMN itself (hard left, with Marxist roots), there is the infamous Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN), the Soros-funded Ballot Initiative Strategy Center, union organizers, wealthy minority contractors, the NAACP, and the ACLU.</p>

			<p>&#8220;These initiatives will ban preferences based on race&#8221;</p>
<p>This is a bit deceiving in that private companies will be allowed to practice &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo;, for non-whites, as much as they want. Which they will. Other&rsquo;s have pointed out that many of these goverment agencies will continue AA because they are under federal guidelines to do so. </p>

			<p>Ironic that NR is still printing things like this, as their slow drift to the left means that eventually, they&rsquo;ll be for affirmative action.  I have heard that they have broached that line already.</p>

			<p>The liberal media (entertainment, MSM, et al) have gone to great pains to convince of the merits of equality and the evils of discrimination. And a fine job they have done. </p>
<p>But their original efforts fell short of finding their intended target. </p>
<p>How short?</p>
<p>Well image, the funeral of William Tell, Jr. Closed casket. Mortician couldn&rsquo;t extract the arrow from the youngster&rsquo;s forehead.</p>
<p>The original blue print [Don&rsquo;t ask for a copy. I can&rsquo;t recall where I stashed it.] interprets discrimination thusly: &#8220;White men get pushed to the end of the line.&#8221; You can find it in article 8 paragraph 3 of the the &#8220;Social Justice&#8221; section.</p>
<p>Now the folks in Arizona are drawing their bows; taking aim at discrimination. It&rsquo;s on the ballot there. If passed, discrimination against white males will be a thing of the politically correct passed. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re calling the initiative. But I&rsquo;m fairly sure they didn&rsquo;t label it &#8220;affirmative action.&#8221; </p>
<p><b><i>Twang.</i></b></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to the funeral.<br>

			<p>If they truly believed in the rightness and the righteousness of their cause, these people would not be so afraid of an adverse message getting out. Why are they afraid to let anyone hear a different viewpoint? The truth must really hurt. I&rsquo;ve observed that most groups who have something to hide beat the drum loudly when other music tries to play! This is typical of communists, Marxists, Stalinists. Unfortunately they are gaining ground in their drive to control the U.S. and the world. We are going to have to learn, once again, that these vicious monsters must be fought against with equal savagery.</p>

			<p>There is no need for affirmatice action. It is pure racism, sponsered by racist groups. </p>
<p>Blacks do not need affirmative action or other special treatment. Its been 50 years nothing has changed their problems. Actually sense the end of affirmative action, and the beganing of affirmative action. Blacks have actually done worse, then before the end of segregation. Poverty actually rose after segregation ended in the black community. Murder even though always high, rose greatly. </p>
<p>Rape, robery, murder, poverty, umemployment has actually increased sense the end of segregation. I do not understand how they can see (&#8220;racist anti-white&#8221;)affirmative action as a good thing. Not only is it racist but it has not helped, the end of segregation has not helped. Every thing bad with the black community from its rap culture to its racism. Even its always high crime rate has only became worse sense the end of segregation. </p>
<p>So I do not see how so called segregation which has nothing to do with racism was bad. And I do not see by looking at the increase in problems in the black community. That so called white racism, or holding blacks down during segregation. Has actually been the real reason for black problems. No, because if white racism was the problem. Would not the black community be doing better sense the end of segregation, instead of doing much worse?</p>

			<p>These organizations are showing their true colors. The have lost all credibility. They are now doing the very things they accuse the evil white man of doing to keep blacks, women, etc, etc, down. This is no longer about &#8220;civil rights&#8221;, it&rsquo;s about keeping whites subjugated. Any one who disagrees is a fool or just a damn liar. </p>

The core beliefs of the left are lies so it&rsquo;s not surprising that BAMN and everyone else uses these tactics while simultaneously crying &#8216;victim&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The lies are being exposed and the left is becoming increasingly desperate, brazen, and sloppy. </p>
<p>May they hang themselves with their own rope.<br>

			<p>The dirty, dishonest and criminal tactics of the Marxists fly in the face of our basic liberty and founding principles.</p>
<p>The reason that the multiculturalists are desperate in their sleazy gambits to stop the ballot initiatives are because they know that the free public generally abhors affirmative action, and they know that Marxism cannot prevail on any merits. </p>

			<p>Affirmative Action and EEOC are UNConsititutional. They were put in place to rob honest working Americans of jobs and give their jobs to immigrants/minorities. Huge Gov agencies/workers were legislated to employ many to take away our American jobs and give them to favored others. The deceit &amp; fraud put upon USA whites has taken away our middle class and continues to increase poverty among all.  The marxcist need high poverty rates &amp; imported ignorant illiterates to make the case for BIG GOV to rescue. Always giving jobs to loyal party members while denying US.   At last we are figthing back. What is being done to obstruct freedom is revealing. Media is part of the operation. V</p>

			<p>In 2004, I think, a Connerly-supported Civil Rights Initiative was kept of the ballot in Michigan due to court decisions.  It was at that point that I gave up my generally &#8220;citizenist&#8221; orientation and became explicitly pro-white.  (The &#8220;citizenists&#8221; did win round two in 2006.  God bless &#8216;em, I say.)  Anyway, when these kinds of measures are kept off ballots by court decisions,  thuggery, etc., we have an excellent point to make to fellow white people:  If we can&rsquo;t end official discrimination against us through reasonable, democratic political efforts, then we absolutely must organize politically <i>as white people</i>.  We have no other choice.</p>

			<p>I strongly believe that the liberal and left wing have no monopoly on using intimidating and dishonest tactics: these are things humans of all political persuasions are tempted towards, and historically they have been used by those on both the right and the left. Nevertheless, what we have in the USA today is a power structure that is preferentially blind towards the use of such tactics by those in any way viewed as &#8220;the disenfranchised&#8221; or the dispossessed or oppressed, such that various ethically questionable, morally bankrupt, or outright racist approaches taken by the liberal left are too often left uncriticized.  I believe that this is due in great extent to our nation&rsquo;s cultural shift away from looking at and critiquing BEHAVIORS, toward presumptuous guessing at MOTIVATIONS.  What has happened is that if we (collectively) believe that someone has a &#8220;bad&#8221; motivation, such as is attributed to those opposing affirmative action, then any manner of illegal or unethical behavior is now deemed justified by those possessed of the supposedly &#8220;purer&#8221; motivation of preserving preferential treatment for those groups deemed oppressed or downtrodden.  Those engaging in these antics, while often fervidly supporting &#8220;diversity&#8221;, have (with what great irony!) lost all ability to allow for a true &#8220;diversity&#8221; of opinion or belief on subjects pertaining to race.  They represent a rather pure fascism in that they cannot allow for the possibility of divergent opinions, and seek through the most ruthless of means to stifle dissent.  Mussolini, Stalin, Hitler, would have greatly welcomed these fellow fascists into their ranks.  </p>

<p>Notice how quiet George Soros is these days?  But he backs Obama.  Someday, Obama&rsquo;s main source of funds will be revealed.  Anyone wish to hazzard a guess?  He believes our economic system is a racial and white phenomena, so he wants to destroy the white race.</p>
<p>George Soros is dedicated to destroying the very system that rescued him and allowed him to become a billionaire. </p>

			<p>With all the racist, anti-white, anti-Christian, unconstitutional laws, so called &#8221; civil rights laws &#8221; since 1954 Brown vs Topeka; original-Americans ( Euro-stock people )have had no power or voice in all three levels of our corrupted federal government. Marxism at its worse. Sen Joseph Mc Carthy of Wisconsin is still lied about and vilified by the &#8221; lefties &#8221; inspite of their victory over him and our former &#8221; representative democracy, aka, The Republic.</p>

			<p>Affirmative action is the last bastion of the left.  If it crumbles, the whole rickety structure will go with it.  Once you remove AA, then the focus on the real reasons for failure in non-European races will become razor sharp.  There will be nowhere to run, no more excuses.  I predict that rather than face this excruciating reality, the leftists and their liberal lap dogs will resort to violence.  After all, if AA fails, their world is gone.  They know this.</p>

			<p> &#8220;opponents have done their best to torpedo the signature-gathering process by, well, any means necessary. Step one is to send its &ldquo;blockers&rdquo; to wherever petitions are being distributed.  Then the real fun begins.&#8221;<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br>
These eager totalitarians of the Left  who are always chanting about &#8220;power to the people&#8221; actually show how much contempt they have for the people by distrusting them to make judgements for themselves.  They  refer to themselves  as&#8221;anti-facists&#8221;.  But they are essentially anti-democratic.   </p>
<p>Surely a society that is supposedly dedicated to  a free and open political process should not have to tolerate this  kind of sabotage.   Cannot a law be passed prohibiting interference with political assemblages, speeches, petitions, etc?    <i>Everyone  </i>should be entitled to be heard.  But no one should be entitled to silence someone else.  If some speakers are fools who are babbling garbage (as will occasionally be inevitable), then that fact will be apparent to all intelligent people; the speakers will be recognized for the fools that they are and they will be ignored. That is how it should be.  But no one, and no ideas, should be suppressed.  <br>

No one has to pass a law mandating that 2 plus 2 make 4, and forbidding you to disagree with it.  But if some Orwellian government decided to make 2 plus 2 equal 5, then they would have to pass a  draconian law requiring it, and enforcing it with the prohibition of  any dissent or even discussion, because otherwise no one would agree with it.</p>
<p>When ideas have to be enforced through the power of law, and disagreement has to be forbidden, then  <b><i>something is wrong with those ideas. </i></b></p>
