						<p>Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama shrugged off a crude comment aimed at him by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, accepting an apology for a remark Jackson made as he contended that Obama wasn&rsquo;t speaking to issues important to the black community.</p>
<p>The Rev. Jesse Jackson issued an apology to Barack Obama Wednesday after comments he made about the presidential candidate were picked up on an open microphone. After a Fox News interview on Sunday, Jackson said, &#8220;Barack, he&rsquo;s talking down to black people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unaware that his microphone was on during a break for a Fox News program last Sunday, Jackson used a slang reference to wanting to cut off Obama&rsquo;s testicles. When he learned Wednesday that the Fox News program &#8220;The O&rsquo;Reilly Factor&#8221; would air his comments that night, Jackson apologized for &#8220;hurtful and wrong&#8221; remarks.</p>
<p>In an interview Thursday on CNN&rsquo;s &#8220;American Morning,&#8221; Jackson disputed suggestions that his comment stemmed from envy. &#8220;That&rsquo;s kind of ridiculous. He&rsquo;s running the last lap of a 54-year marathon. He is running that race. I am a part of that race,&#8221; Jackson said, referring to the modern civil rights struggle. Jackson ran for president on the Democratic ticket in 1984 and 1988.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;For any harm or hurt that this hot mic private conversation may have caused, I apologize,&#8221; [Jackson] said in a written apology released Wednesday. &#8220;My support for Sen. Obama&rsquo;s campaign is wide, deep and unequivocal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jackson said he called Obama&rsquo;s campaign to apologize.</p>
<p>Though Jackson supports Obama, the two are not close.</p>
<p>In September, The State newspaper in South Carolina reported that Jackson had said Obama was &#8220;acting like he&rsquo;s white&#8221; in his response to the arrest of six black juveniles in Jena, La. Jackson disputed the quote.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

Jessie Jackson is well deserving of the contempt most people have for him. Having said that, he could also serve as a positive role model for cowardly Whites who try to curry favor with the &#8220;Blacks&#8221; by &#8220;talking down&#8221; those of their own kind. If only they had Jackson&rsquo;s intestinal fortitude in that venue perhaps their children would have a little more respect for them. </p>

			<p>Last March, Geraldine Ferraro said that Obama was the leader in the Democrat race because he was black.  She said, &ldquo;If Obama was a white man, he would not be in this position.&rdquo;   And she said, &ldquo;He happens to be very lucky to be who he is. And the country is caught up in the concept.&#8221;   <br>
As a result of the furor of her telling the truth, (for example (<a>&#8220;&gt;http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/alex_spillius/blog/2008/03/12/geraldine_ferraro_old_white_woman&gt;</a> &ldquo;old white woman unable to shake off the unthinking, racial profiling of her generation.,&rdquo;)  she was removed from the Hillary campaign.  </p>
<p>Then Ms. Ferraro said, &ldquo;They are attacking me because I am white.&rdquo;   <a> She said:<br>
</a><br>
&ldquo;Any time anybody does anything that in any way pulls this campaign down and says, &#8216;Let&rsquo;s address reality and the problems we&rsquo;re facing in this world,&rsquo; you&rsquo;re accused of being racist, so you have to shut up,&#8221; she told the Daily Breeze of Torrance, California. &#8220;Racism works in two different directions. I really think they&rsquo;re attacking me because I&rsquo;m white.  How&rsquo;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Could there be different standards for Ms. Ferraro&rsquo;s comments and Rev. Jackson&rsquo;s, based on the speaker&rsquo;s race?<br>

<p>Wait a American minute here. It was Jessee the whoremonger who insisted years ago that we properly address coloreds as African-Americans, not &#8220;Black&#8221; Americans. Did he forget the scam?<br>
Isn&rsquo;t he a racist for referring to coloreds as &#8220;blacks?&#8221;<br>

			<p>Yes he is jealous of Obama.  Obama is becoming what JJ thinks he should have been, and is quickly not becoming   &mdash;   that is, the media-ordained civil rights divinity.  And there&rsquo;s the matter of all that money.  A dollar sent to Obama is a dollar not sent to RainbowPush.</p>

			<p>I really wonder if Jackson is getting a little senile.  Even if his mic had been turned off, that is a bizarre thing to say about a person, especially a person you purport to support.  But to say that just moments before a nationaly TV interview it just too bizarre, even the other black guy gave him a look of shock and bewilderment.</p>

			<p>We&rsquo;ve seen this before:</p>
<p>1. Person makes statement that is recorded without the person&rsquo;s permission.<br>
2. Media stab him in back by releasing statement, proving the absence of integrity we have in our media.<br>
3. Person is forced to apologize.<br>
4. No one believes the obviously insincere apology.</p>
<p>Hey Jesse, looks like the network cut off a part of <i>your</i> anatomy this time.</p>

Rev. Jackson is upset that Senator Obama told blacks to take some responsibility for their actions. Rev. Jackson believes this is &#8216;speaking down&rsquo; to blacks; blaming blacks for their own life choices instead of blaming the government or &#8216;society&rsquo;.</p>

			<p>If a white had made those remarks about another white, they would have been played back in their entirety.  None of this, &#8220;We&rsquo;re not releasing the worst of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fox is as protective of blacks as the rest of the media.  If they ever had any spine, it isn&rsquo;t there now.</p>

			<p>Jesse knew the mic was on.  He hasn&rsquo;t had much air time, so,<br>
let me say something into the mic. Hint, hint, wink, wink.<br>
He&rsquo;ll be on the news airwaves as much as Obama.  He&rsquo;ll probably<br>
be near enough to Barry to spit his poison in Barry&rsquo;s ear.</p>

			<p>This is a sista Soljah moment.  Jackson&rsquo;s mental lapse will help Obama, just as Jackson&rsquo;s rebuke of Bill Clinton in &#8216;92 over Sista Soljah helped Clinton.  Jackson is the gift that just keeps giving.</p>

			<p>And now many blacks are claiming Fox News is racist.  </p>
<p>Anytime these race panderers are caught saying what they really think (or acting like a typical black), their supporters start slinging accusations of racism to deflect attention away from the topic at hand.</p>
<p>I find Jesse&rsquo;s groveling to be absolutely delightful!!</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m a bit skeptical of this, that is it was probably a set up to prop up Obamalamadingdong with certain fence sitters (non-black fence sitters).</p>
<p>Blacks are still going to vote 97% Obama-does anyone really think Obama would lose black support because of what Jesse Jerkson said?</p>
<p>It was to send a message to nonblack voters that OK- Obama ain&rsquo;t too bad he pissed off that race huckster Jesse Jackal so we can forget our concerns over his anti-white preacher, his bitter, anti-white wife, etc..</p>

			<p>I heard all about this yesterday  &mdash;  and saw the transcript on TV at work. No surprise of course: it makes perfect sense that Jackson should resent the upstart new kid, BHO.</p>
<p>What was really noteworthy was last nite&rsquo;s O&rsquo;Reilly show  &mdash;  I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s interesting enough to watch regularly, but this was different.</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s schtick is, of course, the &#8216;No Spin Zone&#8221;. Well, it was nothing *but* spin, aided and abetted by the host. The two guests on the segment were a black talk show host and a black Washington columnist. As they verbally pirouetted about &#8216;faith-based organizations&rsquo; and &#8216;being black in America&rsquo;, all I could think was &#8216;Wow  &mdash;  sure can dance!&rsquo;  &mdash;  as they studiously avoided the whole meaning of the news, while talking their mouths off. You never heard such blather.</p>
<p>And to his discredit, Mr. No-Spin-Zone played right along, never confronting them on the real &#8216;news&rsquo; here  &mdash;  not merely that Jackson despises Obama, which anyone could guess, but that he explicitly confirmed it, to the whole world. </p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s public knowledge, but the talking heads  &mdash;  even the &#8216;rebel&rsquo;  &mdash;  just won&rsquo;t face it: What Jackson said was dripping with hostility. It was not political, it was intensely personal.</p>
<p>The real story is just this: Jesse Jackson *hates* Barack Obama, bitterly, and *now we all know it*. That&rsquo;s what the talking heads should be discussing right now  &mdash;  but I guess they&rsquo;re chicken. </p>
<p>But they can&rsquo;t hide it from me, or you.</p>

			<p>Jackson, Sharpton and other race-mongers of their ilk have built empires on the blaming of whitey for absolutely everything. Obama&rsquo;s chastising of irresponsible blacks and their behavior is a threat to the very existence of these phony whiners. Seeing Jackson quaking in his boots is very amusing to me. Under an Obama presidency, there&rsquo;ll be no more excuses. Jackson will have to find another line of work. </p>

<p>Perhaps you&rsquo;re right.  I do think that the Wesley Clark affair from two weeks ago was a contrived hat dance.  You know, Obama tells Wesley Clark to say something stupid so that Obama can repudiate it and look moderate.  Also, this Phil Gramm affair vis-a-vis McCain today is also a hat dance, I think.</p>

<p>Whoever suggested the comments stemmed from &#8220;envy&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t understand the black mindset. The Obama  comments that Jackson was taking exception to were ones that were suggesting that blacks might actually bear some responsibility for their own problems. This message is a big &#8220;no-no&#8221; as far as Jackson is concerned. All the problems of blacks must be laid at the feet of whites. That&rsquo;s the station the money train comes out of. I&rsquo;m sure if Obama gets elected, Jackson will give him a good talking to.</p>

			<p>The liberals know that Obama will be a political dud this election year.  Maybe they could get a few more White votes by making Obama appear as some kind of black conservative.  This whole affair is nothing but a collaberation between Obama, Jackson and the media.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m only an armchair psychiatrist so I invite those with real shrink training to weigh in on Jackson&rsquo;s very odd choice of words re: wishing to &#8220;cut off [Obama&rsquo;s] nuts&#8221;. It doesn&rsquo;t really follow from his complaint that Obama was talking down to black people, in which case JJ might have said he&rsquo;d like to shut Obama&rsquo;s pie hole or put a sock in it. Instead, he offered a castration image. Weird, weird. Since everything eventually turns out to be whitey&rsquo;s fault, perhaps, JJ was merely internalizing the emasculation of black men by the dominant white culture or some such blather. But,in future, Obama&rsquo;s security needs to pat down JJ and remove any sharp objects.</p>

<p>Well, at least he apologized!</p>
<p>However, good old Comrade Jesse can claim he isn&rsquo;t jealous all he wants, we all know the truth; if he wasn&rsquo;t so black, he would turn as green as Kermit the Frog. This is after all a egotistical clown, who has campaigned to have Washington DC made a state for 20 years, just so he could get elected as a US Senator; and run unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination twice. </p>
<p>Keep rubbing on that spot, Comrade Jesse. </p>
<p>Enough said!</p>

			<p>The real story: This was all a ploy to move Hussein slightly more to the center, to hopefully gain him some more white votes. Put these two racists in a sack and shake them, and see who comes out first. They are joined at the waist.   </p>

			<p>No.  This was no setup.  Jackson would never hurt himself and deliberately embarrass himself to help anyone.  This was real anger.  Jackson was seething because he sees whites as the cause of black problems and he sees big government programs as the remedy.  That has been Jackson&rsquo;s bread and butter for the past forty years.  Obama crossed Jackson when he said blacks need to take more responsibility for themselve, their own actions, parenting, etc.</p>
<p>That is not the message Jesse wants to hear.  It&rsquo;s not a message he can make money off of.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t know which is funnier about this incident.  The fact that Obama is alienating blacks, particularly black leaders to such an extent.  Or how the image of Jackson as a violent thug washed away that carefully cultivated mask he wears of an educated [self]-important black man.</p>
<p>This is big trouble for Obama.  Obama is only like 1/4 black and has no african AMERICAN blood in him.  His claim as the first african American President is a lie.  All it would take for Jackson, Sharpton etc. to do him in, would be to start criticizing Obama on this.  Before Obama became a major player in the election, Sharpton was doing exactly that.  Obviously, someone took him aside and made him cut it out.</p>
<p>However, things have changed.  Obama, in his attempt to fool centrists, is stepping on alot of toes on the radical left.  Now, emperor Jackson, the grand high poobah of the race card has been humiliated and forced to eat crow in a highly public national spectacle.  I think it likely that resentment will fester and grow and Jackson is likely to sabotage Obama&rsquo;s campaign at some random moment.  But that pales in comparison to what could happen if Obama seeks to marginalize Jackson, out of revenge and the two start trading blows.  These people have skin that is paper thin.</p>

			<p>I can understand how Jackson was incensed, Obama has been knocking black dead beat dads who foster illegitimate &#8220;dads&#8221; who produce litters of illegitimate babies pretty hard these last few weeks, and Jackson is well, known to have produced an illegitimate child or two with his female staff members.</p>
<p>I guess some of Obama&rsquo;s rhetoric struck a little close to home, I wonder if Jackson&rsquo;s comments mean that he feels on some deep subconscious level that the less desirable black males should be castrated to reduce the swelling ranks of fatherless black children who are doomed to do poorly in life reflecting badly on bourgeois blacks like Jackson. </p>

			<p>Jackson knew exactly what he was doing and exactly what he was saying and did it with full knowledge that the mike was on all to bring attention to him as a bitter jealous black only idiot who hates the fact that Obama has stole the thunder from him. <br>
Jackson would vote for Clinton before Obama and it was Bill Clinton who mentioned Jackson as winning SC in 84 and 88 that Jackson appreciated.<br>
Jackson proves the gap between blacks even within their own race and obviously both himself and Sharpton are not Obama fans since they are out of the old school and never catered to whites as half white Obama has been doing all along.<br>
Ditching Rev Wright in the mold of Jackson or Sharpton was something abhorred by these oldtimers who hateed whites with a passion as Jackson and his ilk do. </p>

			<p>Of course Jesse is offended by talk of keeping your zipper up and staying home&hellip;he has been a player for his entire life; remember his love child?  and in the late sixties early seventies he was a player in Haight Ashbury, (I know people who were there and part of this ilk).  </p>
<p>Jackson is a phony and an adulterer, he is a bigot and an extortionist, other than that, he is a great guy.</p>
<p>What a disgrace he is to all decent black people; trouble is, they won&rsquo;t judge each other and differentiate right from wrong.</p>
<p>Blacks will vote for Obama because OJ isn&rsquo;t running.<br>

			<p>Obama is attempting to play the old Bill Clinton game and appear as a moderate; notice the immediate flip-flop on handgun control after the recent US Supreme Court decision.  A public spat with a radical as loathed by mainstream white America the way Jesse Jackson is can only help the Obamanation.  Of course this was contrived - a dog and pony show.</p>

<p>During Obama&rsquo;s campaign for the 2008 presidential election, he portrayed his mother as a conservative girl from Kansas; however in reality she was a radical leftist and cultural Marxist. She lived in the Seattle area; spending her teenage years in Seattle coffee shops with other young radical leftist. Obama claims his mother&rsquo;s family were conservative Methodists or Baptists from Kansas. However his mother&rsquo;s parents were members of a left-wing Unitarian church near Seattle. The church located in Bellevue, Washington was nicknamed &lsquo;the little red church,&rsquo; because of its communist leanings.</p>
<p>The school Ann attended, Mercer Island High School, was a hotbed of pro-Marxist radical teachers. John Stenhouse, board member, told the House Un-American Activities Subcommittee that he had been a member of the Communist Party USA and this school has a number of Marxists on its staff. Two teachers at this school, Val Foubert and Jim Wichterman, both Frankfurt School style Marxists, taught a critical theory curriculum to students which included; rejection of societal norms, attacks on Christianity, the traditional family, and assigned readings by Karl Marx. The hallway between Foubert&rsquo;s and Wichterman classrooms was some times called &lsquo;anarchy ally.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Dunham has been described by her friends as &lsquo;a fellow traveler&rsquo; meaning &lsquo;a communist sympathizer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Before she died, Ann Dunham wanted to adopt a mixed-race Korean baby fathered by a Black American stationed in South Korea.</p>
<p>Stanley Ann Dunham died in Hawaii November 7, 1995 of ovarian cancer and uterine cancer.<br>

<p>No. Obama is 1/2 Black. His father is from the Luo tribe of Kenya. His mother was White albeit reluctantly given her choice of mates.<br>

<p>That is not the message Jesse wants to hear. It&rsquo;s not a message he can make money off of.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.  Jackson is the kind of guy who will do anything for money as demonstrated by his actions in the past.  Why would Jackson get angry?  Other blacks have been telling their own communities for years to shape up and they didn&rsquo;t listen.  Why would Obama get any different result?  A little &#8220;contribution&#8221; from the Obama campaign to the &#8220;Reverend&#8221; and the stage is set along with help from the media and the DNC.  They&rsquo;re trying to play us like a fiddle.  </p>

			<p>Well, they jumped on Bill Cosby for his message of the need for black responsibility, didn&rsquo;t they?  Jesse was just doing the same routine on Obama and probably expected that the black interviewer agreed with him.  Notice his conspiratorial tone?  No doubt he also expected the black mob to follow suit.  Except Obama&rsquo;s the current media-made god, Cosby isn&rsquo;t (any more).  Seems Jesse just doesn&rsquo;t have his finger on the black pulse these days.  Old dog, new tricks&hellip;etc.</p>

<p>I agree, but&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually even simplier than any threat to Jacksons lifelong approach to Race Politics.  Have any of you been up close and personal with Blacks?  I&rsquo;m many here at AR have.  Well, then we all know just how incredibly childish they are and how that manifests itself in certain ways, like out of control jealousy, for example.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got that stupid, immature, out of control, Black jealousy thing going.</p>
<p>Oh, another feature of Black culture that I&rsquo;ve had a front row seat to is - Black women in ANY position of power.  I will never forget a Puerto Rican co-worker, who was 57 at the time and 25 years with the company we were working for, threatening to quit when he found out our new boss was going to be a black woman.  Not even the other black workers were happy about it. <br>
I subtly suggested, &#8220;Well guys, maybe she won&rsquo;t work out.&#8221;<br>
They got it immediately; though all thinking at that point was internalized, covert, verbal behavior, ie (&#8220;of course, our white co-worker is right.&#8221; Daaamn. Dead on the nail right.  She&rsquo;ll never last. But we&rsquo;re not gonna say it out loud&#8221;).</p>
<p>She was fired after three months. Which means, of course, that she demonstrated her incompetence on the first day and they did everything they could to keep her.  She was replaced by a black man.  Same thing.  Personally, I think they both demonstrated irreversible incompetence during their interviews.</p>

			<p>The internal conflict Jessie must be going through.. I can only imagine. I mean he wanted to be Obama. To see another get so easily everything he lusted after.. I suppose he&rsquo;ll have to do a personal inventory and list his resentments and regrets and 12 step his way to recovery.</p>

			<p>Within one month expect to see the Very Most Reverend Jackson and Senator Obama, along with Senator Clinton (and maybe even Spike Lee) on the same stage together, hands locked together in an obvious presentation of apparent solidarity. </p>
<p>Expect to see the Reverend Jackson&rsquo;s little indiscretion blamed on the white racist press which is out to get him for standing up for blacks in the struggle. The comment will be rationalized by the politically correct, multi cultural, black is beautiful, talking heads as follows:  </p>
<p>(1) This was a comment obviously taken out of context in a moment when the Very Most Reverend Jessie Jackson was temporally upset over what he (Jackson) viewed as Senator Obama&rsquo;s lack of appropriate focus over chronic black issues. And one shouldn&rsquo;t stereotype this one incident into suggesting that the two men do not have the utmost love and mutual respect for one another. It was more like two brothers (excuse the pun) fighting.</p>
<p>(2) This comment was made by one black man to another black man and consequently it is a &#8220;black thang&#8221; that whites can not understand. It&rsquo;s kind of like pit bull fighting! It is one thing for a black man to comment on another black man but it is quite another for a white man to comment on a black man or a black female basketball player for that matter. </p>
<p>(3) In this country whites are never allowed to criticize a black for anything; only blacks have the license to criticize any white for anything. Remember that blacks were held in bondage only one hundred and forty three years ago so they are entitled!    </p>
<p>(4) Merely because the Very Most Reverend Jessie Jackson, who some refer to a God&rsquo;s own quarterback, had a fumble does not mean you can stereotype this one slip into smearing his entire life&rsquo;s work. Remember even King David had his moments but he always was seeking God&rsquo;s will.      </p>
<p>(5) And, when all else fails, remember it was Jessie who was first there beside Dr. King at the end. Therefore, Jessie is the now the Godfather of the struggle, the throne (allegedly) passed to him by the King himself. When Jessie was in the middle of the struggle, Senator Obama was still praying to Mecca. </p>

			<p>Jesse &#8220;whoremonger&#8221; Jackson is really upset about the secret service protection that our marxist candidate is provided.  There is no way anyone could even attempt this castration without a few Secret Service bullets winding up in their head and the whoremonger knows this.  I hope jesse can find a little solace in Jesus, God knows the fool&rsquo;s game is up anyway.    obama &#8216;08/universal bankruptcy &#8216;09</p>

			<p>Probably true in general. I work in D.C., and two contract jobs I&rsquo;ve had were nearly destroyed, largely though not entirely, by black incompetence and irresponsibility.<br>
  However, I have to say I am now on a job and work with a couple very competent black ladies, professional non-ego centered attitudes (their backgrounds are admittedly unusual), and the contract also has a black, female COTR who functions pretty well, and is OK to deal with (she does work with an older, European man who lived in Africa for a while.)<br>
  I&rsquo;ve heard this &#8220;no female boss&#8221; stuff for years, and, well, I&rsquo;ve had great female bosses. I have one now (white.) So I try and give blacks in higher positions the benefit of a doubt. A small percentage work fine. It&rsquo;s just that it&rsquo;s never more than a small percentage.</p>

In the end,Jackson will never rise above being a race hustling pimp of poverty.</p>
