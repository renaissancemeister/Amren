<p>Over the years I&rsquo;ve made honest attempts to understand. I went to two forums on race this year but left the first one angry.</p>
<p>We sat in a big circle at a local college talking about &#8220;white privilege.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After I shared my story, a black woman pointed out how much harder that same life would have been had my parents been black.</p>
<p>Her comment bothered me, but she was right.</p>
<p>Rarely am I conscious of my whiteness. I never claim my race as my identity. I see myself as a woman, not a white woman.</p>
<p>I grew up on &#8220;The Little Rascals&#8221; and thought it was cool that Spanky, Alfalfa and Darla had friends like Buckwheat, Stymie and Farina. I didn&rsquo;t have any black friends to explain some of the racial overtones.</p>
<p>I grew up in a white world. There was only one black family in my grade school and none in any of my classes for eight years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been barred from joining a country club, renting an apartment or getting a job because of my skin color. I&rsquo;ve never been pulled over by police because I&rsquo;m white.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel guilty being white. My ancestors had nothing to do with slavery. My poor Irish and Slovak grandparents hadn&rsquo;t yet arrived in this country.</p>
<p>But a four-week forum at the Cleveland Ecumenical Institute for Religious Studies opened my eyes to my own skin. Beth Robenalt, a diversity specialist and a friend of mine, ran the classes. If she had handed out grades, I would have flunked.</p>
<p>I discovered I&rsquo;m in racial awareness kindergarten. Maybe even pre-K. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While I don&rsquo;t see myself as racist, I&rsquo;ve benefited from racism by default &mdash; through education, justice, political and health care systems that for decades have favored white people.</p>
<p>The class challenged me to challenge those systems, to walk the other way on the conveyor belt of life. Too often I let the conveyor carry me along. I&rsquo;ve been oblivious to the black people struggling to get on or pointing out when we white folks are heading the wrong way.</p>
<p>To be honest, I want to live in a colorblind world. I want race to simply not matter anymore.</p>
<p>But as one black woman in class pointed out, &#8220;If you don&rsquo;t see that I&rsquo;m black, you don&rsquo;t see me.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But she sees me as a white person. Can I see myself that way? What would it mean if I did?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still trying to figure out what it means to be white.<br>

			<p>Amren runs a story like this from a silly white woman about once a month, but it seems like interval is getting smaller.  </p>
<p>This column actually contains some useful information.  This woman   &mdash;   like a lot of us   &mdash;   including early civil rights advocates like Martin Luther King and Hubert Humphrey   &mdash;   wants a colorblind world where race doesn&rsquo;t matter and people are judged not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.  (At least that&rsquo;s what King said he wanted.  His fellow travelers who around today don&rsquo;t say the same.)  But she runs up against a black woman who wants to be specifically recognized as a black woman.</p>
<p>This is why there can be no &#8220;post-racial&#8221; America.  Whites have wanted to be post-racial for a long time.  It is blacks who keep putting race at the forefront.</p>
<p>And Regina, whiteness is goodness.  Whiteness is beauty.  Whiteness is science.  Whiteness is people solving their own problems.  Whiteness is schools where children can learn and streets where women can walk in safety even after dark.  Whiteness is where rape and murder and genocide are crimes and where people who do them are put do death, not lionized.</p>

			<p>How precious; a special awareness class for the white race to make sure they get the incessant and obnoxious message that being white means you are an S.O.B., and a privileged one at that, whether you know it or not. <br>

*************<br>
That would be nice, but it simply isn&rsquo;t possible in a nation that is approaching 35% non-White population.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;But as one black woman in class pointed out, &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t see that I&rsquo;m black, you don&rsquo;t see me.&rdquo;<br>
****************<br>
And she and every other non-white in this country is going to make darn sure you see their color and special-ness and kow-tow to them and their &#8216;vibrant diversity&rsquo;.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;But she sees me as a white person. Can I see myself that way? What would it mean if I did?&#8221;<br>
******************<br>
Hopefully you will learn how to be a white woman and proud of your white heritage. Not &#8216;better than&rsquo; any others, but certainly not worse than either, and NOT GUILTY!</p>

			<p>Anyone remember the 1990s attire of the Black type labeled:<br>
&#8216;F.U.B.U.&rsquo;-For Us, By Us? It was meant to convey an urban style of clothing designed, crafted and worn by Blacks/Hip Hop groupies.</p>
<p>And likewise, a white majority exists solely for the benefit of a white majority.</p>
<p>People prefer faces that look similar to their own.</p>
<p>If race was meant to be a personal inflection, than there wouldn&rsquo;t be anything known as race.</p>
<p>Would the author of this article feel compelled to rough-it-out in Africa to see if her chances were any better at establishing a sense equality?</p>
<p>This is funny.<br>

			<p>This woman&rsquo;s dream to live a colorblind life will cause her great harm someday.  She&rsquo;s not in &#8220;pre-K racial awareness&#8221;; she&rsquo;s a babe in the woods.</p>
<p>How can anyone live in a major metropolitan area (such as Cleveland) and not notice the ravages brought by so-called integration in the last 50 years?</p>
<p>She claims she&rsquo;s been the unwitting recipient of white privilege at the expense of more deserving Africans.  Conversely I&rsquo;m a 58 year-old guy who&rsquo;s repeatedly seen how governmental actions and African misbehavior have impacted my life and those of my family in many ways:<br>
1) My high school education was severely curtailed by riots and demonstrations in my Chicago area town.<br>
2) My college was shut down two weeks before the end of the school year due to African misbehavior.<br>
3) My old neighborhood quickly became unliveable soon after the first few African &#8220;families&#8221; moved in.<br>
4) All three of my children have been denied scholarships that were reserved for minorities who scored far lower than my kids on standardized tests.<br>
5) Since retirement I lost out on two part-time jobs that were given to - you guessed it - Africans. </p>
<p>White privilege?  I don&rsquo;t think so.  Anti-White bias is more like it. </p>

			<p>This is pure insanity. I&rsquo;m not sure what Regina Brett, former columnist for Akron Beacon Journal, is up to here. Liberal Regina Brett has made a fair share of &#8216;racist&rsquo; comments working for the Beacon Journal, so when she claims &#8220;I&rsquo;m still trying to figure out what it means to be white&#8221; I&rsquo;m really not sure what she&rsquo;s up to here. I don&rsquo;t have the time now to read the full unsnipped article. </p>
<p>I imagine she&rsquo;s trying to appease the heavily angry and black population of Cleveland. For that, it would have to be insanity. </p>
<p>Perhaps Regina is simply being honest however. When she writes, &#8220;After I shared my story, a black woman pointed out how much harder that same life would have been had my parents been black&#8221;. I have to think that Regina is even luckier that, whatever he hard luck story was, it didn&rsquo;t turn her, into one of us racists. See, some of &#8216;us&rsquo; have had genuine tragedy in our lives or even a life of tragedy. It&rsquo;s a little harder to work this, non-whites are all victims/whites are all privileged, routine on us. Some of us may have suffered, in part, Because, we are white. The reality we experience, coupled with vision we read about in the media and learn in school, have helped turn us into &#8216;racists&rsquo;. Some of us &#8216;racists&rsquo; can&rsquo;t be won over by the constant drum beatin into us, literally or figuratively, of white-guilt. We&rsquo;ll never be convinced. We can only be held down, away from polite discourse - especially something like a &#8216;diversity&rsquo; discussion, and kept silent. Interestingly, isn&rsquo;t that what the lady was trying to do to Regina Brett? Keep her silent? I was thinking, that was needed at the &#8216;circle&rsquo; was for someone to speak up for Regina, and was thinking of posting that as my comment. You can bet your bottom dollar, that had someone spoke up, or if Regina had, we&rsquo;d see just how much they really value &#8216;diversity&rsquo; and just how tolerant the totalitarians of tolerance really are. If you&rsquo;re white, the impetus is towards silence. I guess in this case it worked on Regina. If they&rsquo;re lucky, Regina never will figure out what it means to be white.  </p>

			<p>I find it really annoying for people to talk of white privilege. First of all if a white person is having a wonderful life there is nothing wrong with that. Second of all this notion of white privilege contains within it the idea that all white people are having the same experience. There are many white people who have had a life of greater suffering as compared to black people. There are many white people who get harassed by the authorities simply for how they look. This idea of white privilege is childish in that it assumes all white people have the same experience. In portraying all white people as having the perfect life it reinforces the idea among blacks that white people all have lives like those portrayed on TV. This causes black people to resent whites. Another thing it does is it makes it so that rich white people are oblivious to the struggles and sufferings of poor white people. It convinces rich white people that all white people have perfect lives thus blinding them to the reality that many whites face. Notions of white privilege serve to convince rich white people to pursue economic policies that impoverish other white people because those rich whites are deluded into thinking that everything is just peachy for whites no matter what. It&rsquo;s so ridiculous that it&rsquo;s impossible to express how ridiculous this situation is without being vulgar.</p>

			<p>Local college&hellip;my money is on Case Western Reserve University. I once had that school on my list, should I be able to move back to Cleveland; I emailed a history professor and addressed her as &#8220;Ms&#8221; because there was no indication of another title. Her reply informed me that she hadn&rsquo;t been a &#8220;Ms&#8221; since she got her doctorate. That snide condescention combined with a crushingly anti-Occidental history curriculum quickly knocked CWRU off the list.</p>

			<p>I too am of Irish and Slovak descent. I can assure you we are not all brain dead and ashamed of our heritage or race. I am ashamed of distant kin turning on their own! Not once have I been given anything because of my color. The level playing field is not enough for blacks, I must have an inward desire to be black and hate all that is white.</p>

			<p>One class in diversity and white hating and she adopted all this guilt.This woman has no strong convictions or any fortitude at all.She justs alows herself to be led to and fro by any ideology the wind blows by.The inability to think for herself.I really don&rsquo;t know how she functions on a daily basis without being led around.She once wrote an article about how hard it was to live in her all white neighborhood.She needs to live in the inner city of Cleveland for at least a year so she can experience the rich cultural life Cleveland has to offer.I promise after this visit she will move in a New York minute back to the all white suburb and get on her knees and thank God she is out of the diverse situation.All white people who have not experienced black people before should be required to take a bus trip to the black neighborhoods .Then they will appreciate the sacrifices their parents made so they could enjoy a nice place to live.By the way like most white people we had to work very hard to sacrifice for our children.So if you call working two jobs white privilage or going without so your children can have it better go ahead and take the sword of propaganda and drive it through your poor fathers heart.Why do whites have to work so hard because we have the privilage of not only paying for our own children but by our taxes we have to pay for the children of the black fathers who won&rsquo;t take any responsibilty.The black fathers run around the village making babies that all the whites have the privilage to support .I have paid enough and I don&rsquo;t owe anything to the black man HE OWES ME!RISE UP WHITE NATION<br>

<p>WHAT?  Since when are blacks an all-knowing source of guidance and wisdom for ANYTHING?!  And they have never been shy, hollering about all the &#8216;racism&rsquo; whitey burden dem wif.  And they aren&rsquo;t shy about demanding mo&rsquo; from the gub&rsquo;ment.<br>

&#8220;But as one black woman in class pointed out, &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t see that I&rsquo;m black, you don&rsquo;t see me.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Once again, here we go.  Don&rsquo;t notice that I&rsquo;m black that makes you a racist-and if you don&rsquo;t notice my blackness you&rsquo;re a racist too-but only notice my blackness when it is to my advantage for you to notice my blackness-blah-blah-blah.</p>

<p>No Comrade Brett you are a racial special ed case, and not for the reasons you think!</p>
<p>You are a &#8220;colorblind&#8221; twitching freak, in multicultural diapers that you fill regularly with your vile Red ooze, and you have been doing this your entire life. Now you go to some anti-white brainwashing session, and you suddenly have an epiphany thanks to an angle &#8220;of color&#8221; who has &#8220;opened&#8221; your eyes; there are different races, irregardless of your desire for &#8220;race to simply not matter anymore.&#8221; And of course she couldn&rsquo;t be wrong, despite your imbecilic whimsies, since if there is one thing your decades long preconditioning by Oprah has &#8220;taught&#8221; you, it is that overbearing black women are always &#8220;right.&#8221; So on you go to spew all of your very &#8220;original&#8221; and &#8220;insightful&#8221; ideas about so-called &#8220;white privilege&#8221; across the pages of The Cleveland Plain Dealer.</p>
<p>Bravo for Comrade Brett, she gets a little Red star for her tolerance cap!</p>
<p>Personally, I think this article is nothing but a puddle of dishonest pig&rsquo;s droppings; this little Red is simply spinning a fantasy for the more gullible of her readers, so they will buy into this nonsense of hers. I highly doubt she is &#8220;newly converted&#8221; with wide dewy eyes and mouth agape in wonder. More likely, she is a &#8220;stealthy&#8221; prophet of white self-hate in good and long standing.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

			<p>More blah blah blah from a stupid white woman.  She&rsquo;s probably single (notice she didn&rsquo;t mention a husband or boyfriend, she&rsquo;s about my age, maybe a little older, since she says she grew up on The Little Rascals) and lonely and this was her only way to meet people.  If she hasn&rsquo;t figured by now what it means to be white, then she never will.  </p>

			<p>How ironic.  This woman&rsquo;s total lack of racial awareness blinds her to the fact that she is steeped deeply in racism.  But, it&rsquo;s not the racism of whites.  It&rsquo;s the intense hatred of anti-white racism.  Likely, she won&rsquo;t wake up to the reality until the day she is raped, robbed, murdered or beaten by the people she identifies as the victims.  It never occurs to her that they are, in fact, villains.</p>
<p>And they mean her harm.</p>

			<p>&#8220;After I shared my story, a black woman pointed out how much harder that same life would have been had my parents been black.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why?  That doesn&rsquo;t make sense.  Blacks have preferences over whites via many programs besides AA.</p>
<p>And how can the black justify this woman&rsquo;s situation as being privileged because she&rsquo;s white?  Where&rsquo;s the privilege?  Saying she would have it worse if she were black doesn&rsquo;t mean her and her family were privileged.</p>
<p>And why talk of white privilege when all races succeed where blacks fail?  Personally, I&rsquo;ve never read of any other race in this country speak of white privilege, except some mentally ill mestizo here and there.  Why are whites privileged compared to blacks, but not to everybody else?</p>
<p>&#8220;The class challenged me to challenge those systems, to walk the other way on the conveyor belt of life. Too often I let the conveyor carry me along. I&rsquo;ve been oblivious to the black people struggling to get on or pointing out when we white folks are heading the wrong way.</p>
<p>My god, what a pitiful, brainless wimp this woman is.  She seems to be unable to challenge one single nonsensical utterance by blacks, yet almost everything they whine about amounts to nothing more than their own incompetence that holds them back.</p>
<p>All races are making a niche for themselves in the US but blacks, and blacks cannot, because they&rsquo;re less intelligent, less capable, with fewer abilities that every other group has, not just whites.</p>
<p>Whites have noting to do with black failure.  Black failure is the result of black ineptitude and a propensity for crime and violence, and because they&rsquo;re lazy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing else to consider.  It just confuses the issue.</p>
<p>Case closed.  </p>

			<p>What some people will do for money.</p>
<p>I live in the Plain Dealer area, and these are the big headline news stories last week.  A black man, Ashford Thompson, shot a white cop in the head, four times; the cop&rsquo;s gun was in his holster.  A couple days later a black lady was shot dead while sitting on her front porch, in a black neighborhood, by an unknown black.   </p>
<p><br>
Instead of having the editors explore the nature of black violence, the PD charged its editorial staff to come out with something good about the blacks, and of course bad about the whites.  I think Regina earned her money.<br>

			<p>Black woman:  &#8220;How much harder your life would have been had your parents been Black!&#8221; </p>
<p>Guilt-ridden White woman: &#8220;That depends on how much they would have loved me and sacrificed for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Black woman: &#8220;That don&rsquo;t matter! Society is stacked against you if you are Black!&#8221;</p>
<p>Guilt-ridden White woman: &#8220;Have you ever read about how the first White settlers to this continent faced insurmountable odds  &mdash;   death, famine, torture, back-breaking work  &mdash;   and yet persevered? Have you ever read about how the first White settlers to South Africa faced insurmountable odds, and yet persevered? Society was stacked against them wherever they turned.&#8221;</p>
<p>Black woman: &#8220;But they wasn&rsquo;t forced into slavery, like Black folk!&#8221;</p>
<p>Guilt-ridden White woman: &#8220;More Whites have been slaves, far more than Blacks. But the Whites always seem to recover.&#8221;   </p>
<p>(At this point, the Guilt-ridden White woman should get ready to grab her Rossi .45 out of her purse, because the Blacks are almost literally boiling with hate.)    </p>
<p>I know, I know. It&rsquo;s hard to think on your feet, and hindsight is 20/20. But there is a playbook, a Marxist playbook,and Blacks use it. Whites must also learn from it, to counteract it. And even if you are not a fast talker, you can still see through their arguments, and remain unconvinced.</p>
<p>And as far as religion goes  &mdash;  forget it. The Christian religion is just one mass march into the Kali Yuga, and has been taken over by those who believe that everyone is equal, and all advantages come from immoral acts of one&rsquo;s ancestors.<br>

			<p>I can&rsquo;t believe I just spent my time reading this article. Civilization is a privilege. To be born onto a higher evolutionary plane than a dung beetle is a privilege. Even so, life is often hard and unfair. Instead of starting with the perspective that the-beautiful-life is a birthright, the childlike author of the above letter should consider that everyone has a story.</p>
<p>So often, white women whose lives have been easy believe that the gravy train that they rode to their present station is universal for all whites. They can see sunburned white men in their sixties, limping from lumbago while laying asphalt, and feel nothing. They can see the coffins of white boys in late adolescence and early adulthood coming home from strange wars overseas and feel bad, but let them see the see the living peers of the dead and the same observers think them spoiled and advantaged.</p>
<p>How much pain and work is required of white men before the author of this article feels indebted to them?</p>
<p>If I knew this woman, and if she were hurt or otherwise in peril, I would let her alone, and leave her to wait hopelessly for the people that she&rsquo;s thrown-in-with to come an save her.</p>

			<p>Lady, your little &#8220;white privilege&#8221; class led you to ponder the wrong question.  THe question isn&rsquo;t whether your life is easier or better because you are white.  The question you should be asking yourself is, do you benefit from being around blacks or from being around whites?  Do blacks make your life easier?  Do whites make your life easier?  The answer of course is you benefit from being around whites, and ironically so do blacks.  They know this, that&rsquo;s why for all their posturing and complaining about whites, they want no part of segregation; they want to be integrated with whites.  </p>
<p>Some of the most wretched, deprived places on earth are the places with black populations and few or no whites.  Haiti, Somolia, Zimbabwe, Sudan, Ethiopia, etc., are examples.  Who do you blame for such misery?  Year after year whites have sent billions of dollars to help those countries.  </p>
<p>The fact is that black woman sitting next to you in class has benefitted immensely from living in a white majority society.  You should have pointed that out to her.  </p>
<p>Another example is Detroit.  Detroit was once a thriving city.  It was once one of the largest and wealthiest cities in the country.  Now it is falling apart. It has a high crime rate and high unemployment rate. Detroit now runs a deficit and must be bailed out year after year by the state and federal government.  Do you know what happened to Detroit?  It went from 90% white to almost 90% black.  That is what happened to Detoit.  If that black lady moves to a predominantly black city like Detroit, will her life turn into a paradise?  Of course not; it will likely be worse.  She knows that and so do you.  She will not be moving to Detroit, Haiti, or Zimbabwe any time soon. </p>

			<p>&#8220;But a four-week forum at the Cleveland Ecumenical Institute for Religious Studies opened my eyes to my own skin. Beth Robenalt, a diversity specialist and a friend of mine, ran the classes</p>
<p>While I don&rsquo;t see myself as racist, I&rsquo;ve benefited from racism by default &mdash; through education, justice, political and health care systems that for decades have favored white people.</p>
<p>The class challenged me to challenge those systems&#8221;</p>

Seems to me she, like so many other people, needs to attend a different kind of forum to understand what are the real institutional racial preferences.</p>

<p>Get real.  How many country clubs have you tried to join.  As for me, it&rsquo;s zero.</p>
<p><br>
<i>renting an apartment</i></p>
<p>Oh, but there are plenty of apartments that are now uninhabitable for whites.  They are many parts of the city that are de facto off limits to whites.  And there are many landlords that have had their property destroyed by being forced to rent to anyone against their better judgment.  Maybe if you owned a property and rented it out you would see the other side of the coid.  You would realize why some landlords are picky about who they rent to.</p>
<p><br>
<i>or getting a job because of my skin color</i></p>
<p>As a white male, I can tell you countless jobs that favor blacks and sometimes women over better qualified white males.  The federal government is the biggest employer and the greatest offender at discriminating against white males.</p>
<p><i>I&rsquo;ve never been pulled over by police because I&rsquo;m white.</i></p>
<p>And blacks don&rsquo;t get pulled over because they are black.  Quite being so gullible, geez.  They get pulled over for speeding, expired tags, broken headlight, etc.  They then whine about it and fight with the officer in hopes of creating a winnable lawsuit.</p>

They came here to make a life for themselves and you, they taught you their  beliefs, hard work,and education, is a way to your dreams.Look&rsquo;s like it worked.   It does not work for blacks. They are their own enemy, they only have blame on their side, blame white people for all of their problems.  </p>

			<p>I feel inspired to share my own story. I grew up with almost no contact with blacks.   My dad, whose experience with blacks was extensive, had nothing but contempt for them as a group.   I didn&rsquo;t argue with him, I simply waited for Life to prove him wrong.  It didn&rsquo;t.  The opposite happened.  Every day I am confronted with fresh proof that the old man had racial matters all figured out.   </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not aware of hating any group of people, but I bitterly hate being lied to; and this woman&rsquo;s article, especially the &ldquo;white privilege&rdquo; part, is just more despicable &amp; infuriating lies.  <br>

			<p>Life is a series of sucesses and defeats. Sometimes you have an easy path and sometines you have hurdles.  You are supposed to overcome the hurdles and difficulties in life and grow as a person. People are discriminated against every day and not because of race or ethnicity. </p>
<p>How about being too short, or too fat, or too thin, or too ugly? Should we therfore whine and speak of tall privilege, thin privilege or beauty privilege?</p>
<p>I think most people would dislike anyone who was violent, vulgar, brash, ignornant, whining, lazy and acted ignorant.</p>
<p>Using race, culture or ethnicity as a crutch or excuse is nothing more than a scam and everyone pandering to these idiots are taking advantage of these ignorant masses for their votes.</p>

			<p>What an insult this whole idea of white privilege is.  What kind of moron would attend such a stupid class and allow themselves to be degraded because of the color of their skin.  What kind of privilege is it being a taxpayer and having money taken out of your pocket and transfered into the pockets of welfare chiselers.  What kind of privilege is it when your children in public schools are afraid to go into a bathroom for fear of being either extorted for their lunch money or subjected to insult and physical violence.  How about when you make the highest grades along with having the highest test scores, and you are refused admission to graduate school while a less qualified black is admitted because you are told that you won&rsquo;t improve campus diversity. I NEVER allow anybody to preach to me about white privilege.  I always say privilege is measured by achievement not by your birthright.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t speak English when I came to this country from Korea when I was a child.  Neither could my mother, father, my two sisters and my brother, yet we have prospered in the greatest country the world has ever known.</p>
<p>We worked hard, respected our new countrymen, and we were grateful to be in such a prosperous, opportunity rich environment.</p>
<p>You should be ashamed of the many advantages all black people have yet most all of you do nothing but complain.</p>
<p>If you were in Korea since you were born, instead of the US, you would do no better there than you do here, because your group is held back by a lack of intelligence.  You would be complaining there like you do here, but the Korean people would tell you to your face that you have nobody to blame but yourselves.  And, like here, when you heard the truth you would probably riot.</p>

<p>You probably have never been raped, assaulted, or robbed because of this.  Your house has never been broken into, there weren&rsquo;t drugs being sold on your street, and no prostitution being hustled in the neighborhood you grew up in.

<p>Which &#8220;White&#8221; world is that?</p>
<p>This ought to be enough of an indictment against this kind of nonsense argument. It ought to be enough to show how Middle Class intellectual shallowness is reflected perfectly in its morals - which are platitudinously self-righteous.  It ought to be enough to dismiss them outright. But it isn&rsquo;t, because they just keep coming back. <br>
It spreads like a virus, but it functions exactly like an addiction.  With reason.  It IS an addiction.</p>
<p>I know that this has happened throughout the world and not just in the West, but I am concerned about the West.  Espeically since the West has, for good or bad, become THE model of the World. <br>
What I am refering to are the cycles of fanaticism that the West has been consumed by throughout its History.  <br>
The last really big one was the French Revolution when people thought that Man was Naturally Social (he isn&rsquo;t, obviously). So, the thinking went, if we just line up Man - Nature - Society, all will be well and we can have something close to Heaven on Earth, if not the actualy thing.  It must never be forgotten that people actually did believe that at the time.  And, as everyone knows the Revolution went from a Social Utopia to a Bloody Dictatorship without ever once changing its mind; without once stopping to reflect on the carnage. It never stopped to say, &#8220;Hey, maybe the way we think is responsible for all of the blood we&rsquo;re swimming in.&#8221;<br>
Now it is true that some good things did come out of the French Revolution.  But it&rsquo;s also true that those opertating at the highest levels of Culture who pointed out our tendency to convert beliefs into truths and then truths into hysterical fanaticisms and fanaticisms into tyranny and violence, were all ignored by the Right and the Left.  Of course, the Right and the Left are two parts of the same thing.  And it&rsquo;s &#8220;the thing&#8221; that has to go.  <br>
In one important respect, the next group of Cultural Heroes to come around will have a distinct advantage over their brothers from the past.  They will be in possession of more precise knowledge of human behavior, and from so many different perspectives, than ever before.<br>
But this also means that the fanatics will have their defenses as high as possible in order to shield themselves from reality.  Which is what fanaticism is, ie; the most intense, the most violent, defense man has against an unyeilding, and to them, unbearable, Reality. And, as we all know by now, fanatics are more than willing to end it all rather than face Reality.<br>
It very well may be.<br>

<p>I might add that she seems to believe that somehow these other racial groups, will supply her with answers she is looking for on the question of her own value and identity. She doesn&rsquo;t understand that their values are a product of their own unique set of neurons, and are tainted with their own subjective value judgements, no superior, perhaps inferior, then her own. Afterall, don&rsquo;t these people she seeks answers from about her own identity or tendencies belong to cultures/races that lie, steal, cheat, murder, rape, etc. etc., as everyone else does? </p>

Check out her website: <a href="https://www.reginabrett.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.reginabrett.com/</a> . She is a politically-correct hireling. The question is not that what she says is hateful, ignorant, pathetic, and racist! But rather: HOW do we outmaneuver her? HOW do we present OUR case so at least a strong minority of White Men will hear, believe and act? HOW do we feed our fellow White Man&rsquo;s passions to further our cause secure the future for OUR children?<br>

			<p>Sometimes I feel sorry for these poor, deluded white writers who share their stories, at least if they show signs of having some glimmer of white racial consciousness or if they learn a hard-won lesson, but not this woman. I have nothing but contempt for her. She expects us to feel sorry for her because she had no black friends while she was growing up to educate her about her inherent white wickedness and white narrow-mindedness. She laments the paucity of blacks in her life and wants to live in a colorblind society. But notice she says nothing about the racial makeup of her neighborhood. Is she going to move to Detroit tomorrow to show her solidarity with blacks? No, she wants to give up &#8220;white privilege&#8221; only to the degree that it gives her a holier-than-thou attitude over others. Sheer contemptible hypocrisy.</p>
<p>From the full article: </p>
<p><i>While I don&rsquo;t see myself as racist, I&rsquo;ve benefited from racism by default - through education, justice, political and health care systems that for decades have favored white people.</i></p>
<p>This is always the way it is with white &ldquo;anti-racists&rdquo; &mdash; they never see <i>themselves</i> as racist, it&rsquo;s always <i>other</i> whites  and white society in general. This is how they can say that &ldquo;whites are racist,&rdquo; yet somehow always exclude themselves from that description. But again, where does she live?</p>

			<p>  Please, for the sake of your family, and the rest of the white community; if you are so ashamed of your whiteness, if you are so confused, then do the honorable thing. Please, kill yourself and quit using precious air that the rest of us could use. You are obviously incapable of intelligent thought and need to die. I don&rsquo;t mean this to be mean spirited. I&rsquo;m just being honest. If your life is such a waste, then don&rsquo;t drag anybody else down with you. Don&rsquo;t be a burden on the rest of the white race. Do the honorable thing. If you are of such weak character, then don&rsquo;t expect others to carry you. Do the right thing. Maybe you could have one of your minority friends perform an &#8220;exorcism&#8221; on you. You are lost to the rest of us. Please go away, and do the right thing. Just check out of this world. </p>

			<p>Make no mistake folks - this woman thinks EXACTLY as she has been carefully conditioned to think since childhood. This vile message is reinforced from every quarter. Notice how she makes a point to say she doesn&rsquo;t self-identify by race&hellip;she self-identifies only as a woman. Of course she does, the cult of magical &#8220;womanhood&#8221; is yet another victim group in American identity politics - and she is dutifully playing her part. <br>
Of course one must ask - why is being a woman important to you, yet your racial family is not? Well, because that&rsquo;s how you have been taught to think, of course. </p>
<p>This type of thinking is religion to the modern herd - it&rsquo;s that simple. The fact that it is only logical that Whites would benefit, even uniquely so, from a society that THEY founded/created, nurtured, developed and maintained for centuries, never even occurs to the brainwashed. But when one accepts lies on &#8220;faith,&#8221; logic no longer has any application.   <br>

			<p>Approximately every month or two, <b>AmRen</b> runs an almost identical article from a delusional, guilt-ridden for no reason, white woman. The story is the same - only the name is changed. Some of us email the poor soul with <b>AmRen&rsquo;s</b> link and/or leave a comment on the brainwashed victim&rsquo;s site if they have one (which almost immediately get gets deleted).</p>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;m sorry I never did all these years is to save all the identical articles and then do a mass emailing to all the women who are horrified they are white. I figure that way, they could contact each other, start a club, commiserate about what horrendous people they are for not having enough melanin in their skin and being on the right side of the Bell Curve, rent Sex (with black men) In The City, drink whatever the &#8216;in&rsquo; drink is these days among the Upper West Side elite, effete crowd, and generally have an overall miserable evening with each other.</p>
<p>This way, whenever we evil, straight white males go out, we&rsquo;ll have much less of a chance of running into them.</p>
<p>And <b>no</b>, don&rsquo;t bother presenting them with any facts or logic. You might as well talk to sheetrock   &mdash;   they&rsquo;re the same, except for the fact that sheetrock serves an actual, useful purpose in this world&hellip;</p>

			<p>An obvious case for a good (white) psychiatrist&rsquo;s couch.   How can anyone white feel guilty about something that happened over 100 years ago and for which the descendants of the victims have been more than adequately recompensed by big opportunities and privileges since that in far too many instances have NOT been taken advantage of for whatever reason?    The very statement about white guilt encourages many of the blacks to feel personally aggrieved when they should be working hard for themselves with no shackles to give them excuses for failures.</p>
<p>Black people need to learn from birth that the only way to success is hard work with no lame excuses from history for any of their failures and only then will the shackles of the past be shaken off.  Bill Cosby is right and they should all listen to him and learn.</p>

<p>I suppose the two false principals that creates this mindset is:</p>

<p>No it isn&rsquo;t. There are serious differences between black and caucasian genetics which become glaringly apparent when viewing the races as a whole as opposed to concentrating on &#8220;individuals&#8221;.</p>
<p>2) Societies and civilizations just spring out of nowhere and one group will &#8220;steal&#8221; all the good stuff.</p>
<p>No. They have to be built and maintained and the group that built it in the first place has the right to own it and pass it on to their children.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the diversity class, we read, &#8216;Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria?&rsquo;&#8221; </p>
<p>Well, why are they? Because of &#8220;white privilege&#8221;? The author doesn&rsquo;t say. So I found the book at books.google.com. On page 60:</p>
<p>&#8220;The anger and resentment that adolescents feel in response to their growing awareness of the systematic exclusion of Black people from full participation in U.S. society leads to the development of an oppositional social identity.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Yesterday evening I made a quick run to Kroger. I had run out of the creamers I like to use in my coffee. Walking down the aisle that led to the glass cases where the creamers are located I noted a black woman who appeared to be in her thirties. Standing around her were what I assumed to be her children, a son about 15 to 16-years old, another son around 11, and a girl about 9. They had their backs to the glass cases, staring vacuously into space.<br>
 <br>
I saw that the glass door I needed to open was to the side of them giving me access to the creamers. As I approached the door to open it, the 15 to 16 year-old son began moving the cart to block the door I was going to open. I was too fast, thwarting his blockade. As I opened the door the black mother exclaimed, &ldquo;Excuse me!?&rdquo; I replied that I did not know I was in their way. She then said, &ldquo;You better check yoself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told her they were just standing there talking and not shopping. By this time I had my coffee creamers and was walking away. She muttered something unintelligible. I replied, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; This is the privilege I get to experience as a white man; seemingly running into hostile black people at every turn.<br>

This woman is a product of college and controlled media brainwashing/diversity training. At my university our aim is to mass produce useful idiots with this viewpoint.

When I was young, I liked movies about magical events. I knew magic (like turning yourself invisible) wasn&rsquo;t real but I liked to imagine it was.</p>
<p>Wanting something to be and the reality of it are two different things. This woman wants race not to matter but the fact is race matters because race is real.</p>
<p>Again I repeat myself. I truly believe liberalism is a kind of mental illness characterized by an inability to see and accept reality.</p>
<p>A mentally healthy white person can not wake up each morning wondering about their being white. I don&rsquo;t start each day wondering, &#8216;why am I a primate&rsquo; or &#8216;why am I a mammal&rsquo; or &#8216;why am I a biped&rsquo;. These ideas shouldn&rsquo;t be a part of a persons thinking process if they are in good mental health. Neither should a person start questioning their race.</p>
<p>If this women or any liberal or so-called &#8216;progressive&rsquo; feels such guilt for being born what they are, let them go into non-white communities and try to help these people. Unfortunately, for these people, such action won&rsquo;t help them grasp the reality of race. They will only likely fall deeper into guilt and depression and blame &#8216;society&rsquo; for not addressing the issue of &#8216;racism&rsquo;.</p>

			<p>White privilege is a really sneaky term that recognizes whites are more successful, more social, and more inventive than other races, but it explains these triumphs as resulting from favoritism, theft, and pure luck.  It assumes that each and every white has some benefactor that gives him/her free money, great jobs, and everything they need simply because they&rsquo;re white.  Examining this theory critically, it simply tries to spin white success and altruism as selfishness and greed.  For example, white parents paying for their child&rsquo;s college education, white parents sheltering a child who&rsquo;s going through financial troubles, and even leaving behind their estate and life insurance to their children after their death.  I&rsquo;m sorry, but I thought these things were signs or an advanced and moral society, not greed.</p>
<p>It also fails to recognize that black and latinos employers prefer their own race as well, except this isn&rsquo;t frowned upon.  As well all know, these minorities need to stick together to protect themselves from &#8220;lil &#8216;ol whitey.&#8221; </p>

			<p>My White privileges:</p>
<p>To be turned down for the best colleges  because I am white even though I have a 4.0 average and 1500 SAT scores. To sit through 4 years of a mediocre college being lectured in just about every class including medieval art history about the evils of white people and white civilization. </p>
<p>The ony classes that escaped hate whitey propaganda were calculas and economics.  The economics professor was an Indian sikh who had just retired from the World Bank program to bring loans and civilization to Latin America and Africa.  He told us a lot of stories about the failure of foreign aid to those countries.  He admired the civilized nations and despised the uncivilized including his own country, India.</p>
<p>To be turned down for job after job after job because I am white.</p>
<p>Finally, after applying 3 times obtaining a decent administrative job in a major university by the simple expedient of checking African American rather than white on the application.  2 days later I came home and found a voice mail: &#8220;When can you start?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Being continually sexually harassed by black men from age 11 to well I&rsquo;m now 50 and it hasn&rsquo;t stopped.  Spending 8 hours per day surrounded by my fellow employees; many blacks who babble, quarrel, intrigue, fight, argue, carry out vendettas and do about 2 hours of actual work per day.</p>
<p>Having totally and completely false accusations made against me by blacks I work with.  I don&rsquo;t mean exagreatting things, but total falsehoods.</p>
<p>Being dragged in front of civil service tribunals manned mostly by white hating white marxists to answer these charges.  Funny things about the feminazis.  With all their nonsense about sexual harassement in the workplace, if a black man gropes, makes lewd suggestions and harasses a white woman he is perfectly innocent of harassement but she is a racist because she won&rsquo;t sexual gratify the feral predators.</p>
<p>Being mugged by the classic mugging team of 3 feral black predators and totally losing my ability to type 80 words per minute.</p>
<p>Having to spend 3 times the housing costs of blacks because it is too dangerous to live near them.</p>
<p>Spending a fortune on gas, tires and running up 130 miles per week on my car because I have a long commute because it is too dangerous to live near blacks.</p>
<p>Having to sit through mao style diversity training taught mostly by white feminazis.  I have never wanted to kill so much as in those sessions. I&rsquo;m a white woman myself, but I have started hanging out with asian and filipino women because most white women are just vicious traitors to the white race.  </p>
<p>When I complain about the horrible blacks I work with, most of my white female so called friends reply &#8220;Oh, they&rsquo;re not all like that.&#8221; &#8220;Slavery and segration made them that way&#8221;  &#8220;We must atone for the way our ancestors treated blacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>At least twice a week reading a big page 2 or 3 story about some feral black predator who commited a vicious crime.  The story is not about the crime or the victim.  The story is all about his 400 pound project mama, the poverty pimp preacher, the cute little 8th grade graduation picture and the quotes from a grade school teacher, or neighbor who had something nice to say about the feral predator.   &#8220;Don&rsquo;t send him to prison and make a good kid bad.&#8221;  He didn&rsquo;t have a father.  He grew up in the projects.  It is all whitey&rsquo;s fault.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another thing I am sure that the Plain Dealer paid for the diversity session and ordered this traitor to write the piece.  It is very similiar to the confessions the Chinese had to write when they were sentenced to Mao&rsquo;s concentration camps.</p>

			<p>Whites are going to find out that their &#8220;Privilege&#8221; is just a theoreticallly-designed excuse to persecute them&hellip;. I envisage a future White population that, after all the social buffetting, chafing and the like, will shed the P.C. garments that have constrained them in a mode of passivity.  But it will take a leadership weaned on absolute fearlessness.  I see a collective Great White Shark emerging in the sea of humanity that won&rsquo;t be susceptible to &#8220;White guilt&#8221; because, by then, they will have experienced the obverse: the denigration of Whiteness from all quarters.  Yes, the Great White Shark&rsquo;s teeth are being sharpened by every slight and adversity they receive on a daily basis&hellip;.. Red waters will follow.</p>

<p>Most white people have done nothing.</p>

<p>But more white people have been beneficiaries of those few than have been non-white people.</p>

<p><br>
Well, gee.  This appears to be a damned good reason to quit grinding the racial axe, doesn&rsquo;t it?  Unless these people really do want to foment racial hatred against whites.</p>
<p>Imagine the civil rights movement being covered in a truthful way: blacks didn&rsquo;t wrest power away from whites (there was no coup).  It was given them by the various white power structures.  Granted them.  Did many white people object?  Yes.  But white people marched, too, and created the laws in favor of civil rights.  Programs have been created and wealth spent on behalf of American slaves and their descendants for centuries.  The majority of historically black educational institutions were created and funded by whites.  Slavery existed all over the world, and African slaves were captured and bought by blacks to supply the trade.  African slavery was not benign.  Slavery still exists in Africa.  Tribalism is as virulent and violent in today&rsquo;s Africa as it has been for centuries, long before whites set foot on the continent.  If they taught these TRUTHS in an even-handed way, instead of blaming whites for every last bit of it, there could be better racial relations.   Instead, they are sowing the seeds for violent hatred.  White kids aren&rsquo;t going to continue rolling over for this.  They will become extremely resentful and begin to hate right back.  (Asian and Hispanic kids don&rsquo;t have to fall for any of it at all.) There will be a backlash.</p>
<p>My point doesn&rsquo;t have to do with the racial rights and wrongs of slavery and the civil rights movement. It happened, it&rsquo;s history, and it should be told truthfully.  The way it&rsquo;s taught now, whites who aided the various freedom movements are being airbrushed out of the picture, every negative thing is blamed on whites, and whites are reduced to evil caricatures.  Our children will continue to suffer the consequences of this hateful anti-white indoctrination.</p>

<p>I beg to differ with you. Most White people participated in creating modern civilization by merely being in it. They brought their consciences, their ideas, their cooperation, their innate dignity, their fairness, their compassion, their sense of self, their skills, and their work ethic to White society. Yes, mderpelding, some emerged as leaders, whose names have been remembered and studied down through the ages, but those who contributed their racial, social and historical heritage-and all the marvelous traits that accompany it  &mdash;  are indeed worthy of praise, respect, admiration, and celebration. Whether one&rsquo;s ancestors were noblemen or peasants, they were White, and I&rsquo;m proud of every single individual who created Western Civilization. It is this generation, and the previous one, who have been taught to devalue it.   </p>

<p>Look at the comments- a sixteen year old wants to be alive in the old days.  I was born in Santa Monica, 1946.  The loss is incalculable.  Let the young see the old days and the old ways, so that they will know what to fight for.</p>

			<p>This is the first time I have visited this forum, I never missed a word that has been posted on this topic. <br>
My thoughts run with most here, I am an Australian in my 40&rsquo;s, I am depressed as to where my country is going and of the memories and hopes I had for myself growing up in a White proud and political policy nation. Once Australia had a white immigration policy mostly European, and amazing things were built with pride.<br>
Feel free to contact me as I am refreshed by the attitude here.<br>

<p> And this is how merry old England looked before the mass invasion and the planned destruction of British culture.</p>

			<p>John R., we welcome you, and please post as often as you wish. This board is truly a lovely oasis from the ills that vex our formerly great societies. If the truth be known, we here express the views of ninety-eight percent of our population and we are delighted to have you among us. </p>

			<p>&#8220;While I don&rsquo;t see myself as racist, I&rsquo;ve benefited from racism by default &mdash; through education, justice, political and health care systems that for decades have favored white people.&#8221; (-Regina)</p>
<p>Regina, unforchunatly we&rsquo;ve all been socialized to believe these lies and distortions.  But if you can, think about the facts?:</p>
<p>Education-If we examine the education system in America, we see that blacks and other non-whites have more opportunities to go to school compared to whites. Blacks and other non-whites are eligible for race based scholarships and other benefits that whites are not eligible for. If you&rsquo;re black in this country and you graduate from high-school, your college is paid for.</p>
<p>Justice-The justice system is extremely biased against whites. Did you know that for interracial crimes, blacks commit crimes against whites 85% of the time?  At the same time, whites are charged with &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; 65% of the time. And although blacks are only 13% of the population, they committed over 50% of the violent crime in America.  Some people say this is due to &#8220;racism&#8221; but if we read the National Victim Survey, we find that people report crimes by blacks at about the same rate. </p>
<p>Political system- The political system caters to blacks much more than to whites. Did you ever notice that blacks are given affirmative action, racial quotas, and other minority special programs?  Whites don&rsquo;t receive these benefits, so politically, blacks are much better off than whites. Blacks can also call for the firing of whites if they&rsquo;re &#8220;offended&#8221; by something, but very rarely do we hear about it the other way around?  If a white man attended a white nationalist church similar to Obama, do you think he would even have the chance to run for president?  </p>
<p>Health care- The New England Journal of Medicine did a study that proved that whites (as a group) receive less health care than blacks or Hispanics. I&rsquo;m attaching the study in the link below.[1]</p>
<p>So you see Regina, you&rsquo;ve been lied to. It is in the interests of blacks and other minorities that you believe that you live in a &#8220;racist system.&#8221;  But as you can see, if we were really to call the system &#8220;racist,&#8221; we would have to agree its &#8220;racist&#8221; against whites. You&rsquo;ve been made to believe the old narrative about whites oppressing non-whites, but as you can see, this is just to make you feel as if you owe them something.  I hope this helps you see the world a little more clearer?</p>

			<p>Thanks for posting that episode of Dragnet.  I am not old enough to remember that show, but I watched the reruns.  I notice any TV show or movie from the fifties and sixties show civilized whites, dressed respectably and the dialogue is sober.  Today whites are constantly shown as buffoons, deviants or an evil racist bent on trying to harm  minorities.</p>

			<p><i>A few white people throughout history have created the modern world as we know it.<br>
But not most white people.<br>
Most white people have done nothing.<br>
Just like most black people.<br>
</i></p>
<p>I disagree.  Most whites do contribute to society. They maintain a culture, structure, education system and law and order that allows those few white genuises to excel.  Most whites are not mathematical genuises or scientist, true; but most whites are collectively contributing to what we call a civilized society.</p>
<p>If Bill Gates were born in Somolia, Zimbabwe, or some other black run contry, could he have changed the computer industry?  I would say no, his talent would have been wasted if he were stuck in a black run country. In other words, white genuises rely on white culture to flourish.  That black woman and that white woman are benefiting from living a predominantly white culture.  Too bad both of them could not be shipped off to a black run country.  Then they would realize the benefits they are receiving by living in a white run country.<br>

			<p>This sort of ditzy chick is what you typically find in college today. She thinks her own ethnicity is bland, has no &#8220;flava&#8221; and she desperately wants to be accepted by minorities. This usually occurs when she starts dating a black guy, then calls her parents racists when they aren&rsquo;t overjoyed at their little princess dating Tq&rsquo;Sha-ne.</p>
<p>This is partly our own fault. We homogenized ourselves into &#8220;white&#8221;, forgetting our own histories   &mdash;   Italians, Germans, Irish, British, Russian, etc. so that young people today don&rsquo;t think &#8220;white&#8221; means anything. </p>

			<p>People who don&rsquo;t want race to matter anymore are trumpeting the severing of their brain stem. They&rsquo;re making cooing baby sounds and thinking, like a baby, that they&rsquo;re making a lot of sense. They don&rsquo;t happen to notice that to the people calling loudest for a raceless society, RACE IS EVERYTHING. </p>

			<p>Is it a coincidence the headline is &#8216;My Struggles in Black and White&rsquo;? Wasn&rsquo;t Hitler&rsquo;s manifesto named &#8216;My Struggle&rsquo;?</p>

<p>You story sounds bogus!</p>
<p>No college or university is going to call anyone at home and say &#8220;when can you start?&#8221; without having the candidate in question go through an interview.</p>
<p>Secondly, what makes you think Asian and Filipino women are going to care more about White women?</p>
<p>It seems like diversity training has taken its toll on you. </p>
