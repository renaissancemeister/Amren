						<p>Many Britons fear their prospects are being limited because of the pressure put on housing and schools by immigrants arriving in the UK, a new report warns.</p>
<p>The claims come as it emerged that £1billion is being spent on putting up foreigners in council houses &mdash; despite two million people waiting for a home.</p>
<p>The report, titled Immigration and Social Cohesion in the UK, uncovered a stark divide in how parts of the UK adapt to new migrants.</p>
<p>While many people value their children growing up with cultural diversity, some feel their opportunities are reduced because of immigration.</p>
<p>There was particular concern around the competition for social housing, soaring house prices and school places.</p>
<p>Report author Mary Hickman, a Professor at London Metropolitan University, said: &#8220;We found that although many British people value the UK for being multi-ethnic and multicultural, poverty and lack of opportunities undermine social cohesion especially in certain parts of our towns and cities.</p>
<p>&#8220;A key factor influencing whether new migrants are accepted is the dominant story in each locality about who belongs there.&#8221;</p>
<p>The report also suggested that Gordon Brown should spend focus on tackling poverty rather than a &#8220;fixed notion&#8221; of Britishness to improve social cohesion.</p>
<p>Since taking over as Prime Minister last July, Mr Brown has consistently emphasised the importance of Britishness to bind the nation together.</p>
<p>However the Joseph Rowntree Foundation suggested that his time might be better spent dealing with &#8220;deprivation and how people connect&#8221;.</p>
<p>The competition for a limited supply of council housing has been one of the areas of key concern in the debate about immigration.</p>
<p>Since Labour came to power in 1997 the number of people on the waiting list for a council house has soared by 650,000 to 1.67million households.</p>
<p>Figures obtained by the Conservative MP James Clappson show that nearly £1billion is being spent on putting up foreigners in council houses &mdash; despite nearly two million households waiting for a new home.</p>
<p>Parliamentary answers show that 7,000 council houses were rented to foreigners from both inside and outside the European Union in 2006/7.</p>
<p>Given that it costs £134,000 to provide a council house, this means that £938million &mdash; including £430million of grants &mdash; is spent on providing social housing for foreigners.</p>
<p>Mr Clappison, a member of the Commons home affairs select committee, said: &#8220;This is one more example of the pressure placed upon housing and services by the present very high level of immigration permitted by the Government.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Government is completely failing to take into account the consequences of its policies&#8221;.</p>
<p>The provision of council housing to foreigners has proved to be controversial, with claims that it can cause tensions in some working class communities.</p>
<p>Critics said this was because the allocation of council houses was done on the basis of need.</p>
<p>Sir Andrew Green, chairman of pressure group MigrationWatch, said: &#8220;The fact is that allocation is based on need which has the effect of giving priority to larger families which are more likely to be immigrant families.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no question that this one of the causes of local tensions which will not be helped by a reflex policy of denial by this Government.&#8221;</p>
<p>However a report last month from the Department of Communities and Local Government claimed new migrants were not putting &#8220;significant pressure on social housing&#8221; because they are ineligible for council housing.</p>

			<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter if your family has been in that village for 500 years, and if generations of your family helped build that village and nation, paid taxes, and fought to defend the UK.  In the twisted logic of our leftest leaders, a large family of recent immigrants always gets precedence over a small family of UK citizens. The people of England are being taxed to support their own ethnic cleansing.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Native Britons fear immigrants will make their lives harder.&#8221;</p>
<p>Surprised? That was their original purpose. A benefit to the few at the expense of the many. Don&rsquo;t recall anyone ever promising immigrants would make life easier. Don&rsquo;t recall anyone ever asking for permission at all.   </p>

			<p>  It just seems odd and very frightening that the &#8220;winners&#8221;, if you will, of WW2 are the biggest losers in the beginning of the 21st century. The U.K. is in alot of trouble due to immigration troubles, same with France, and  the U.S. The Soviet empire is gone. I hate the communists, but when the soviet union fell apart, that loosed alot of muslims on the world that the kremlin held in check for a long time. The common denominator for all the 21st century losers is their governments. Liberals and neo-cons have sold us to the highest bidder. CORPORATIONS. We now fight wars for other people and entities. Whites are being sold into servitude for higher profit margins. Cheaper wages paid to illegals which in turn keeps whites out of work in their own countries. Generous welfare paid out to blacks, hispanics, and whomever else to keep wages low. Patriotism was replaced by profit margins. Corporations don&rsquo;t believe in, nor do they have borders. Global markets equate global slavery. If and when the slaves rise up, there will be a global &#8220;police force&#8221; to quell any trouble. Anybody else have a solution to these problems? I would love for somebody to give me hope for our future generations. I feel that we have failed them. </p>

			<p>Completely insane, and then the welfare for said immigrants, push prices higher. Cancer will eventually kill the host, immigration is a cancer on western lands. Cut it out, or die.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s good to see news stories that highlight the problems that can arise when nations have immigration policies which seem to fail to take account of the problems that too many immigrants can create for the existing, native-born populace.  The unfortunate thing, for both the UK and the US, is that by the time the problems have become massive enough or obvious enough to be newsworthy, the damage caused by unchecked immigration cannot be undone.   </p>

<p>These numbers seem off.<br>
They&rsquo;re claiming only 7,000 council homes were rented to foreigners but an article from last year says that 200,000 foreigners occupy council housing or social housing.</p>
<p>&#8220;They confirmed that 200,000 citizens of foreign countries hold the keys to council or housing association homes.&#8221;<br>

<p>Assuming four people per home that would total 6.7 billion pounds ($13 billion US).</p>

<p>It would be a bit tedious (to say the least) to speculate yet again about the abject madness, that seems to have taken hold of the UK&rsquo;s political class. Indeed, it is a Labour &#8220;government&rsquo;s&#8221; polices we are discussing here, but from what I can gather of the Tories they are as paralyzed by the multicultural cancer&rsquo;s debilitations as Labour is with wallowing in its spread. There is so much that is negative here to reflect on here, that one could spend years writing about it; however, it suffices to say that the established political classes there, are literally destroying themselves at a pace that is only equaled by the devastation they are willingly visiting upon their own country.</p>
<p>Thus comes the positive aspect, that always balances out the negative; or put another way, enter the BNP!</p>
<p>Sooner or later a void gets filled, particularly when it revolves around political power. In the UK there is clearly a political void that is so vacuous that it cannot even be described as a black hole, it is better to call it instantaneously necrotic. No system can last forever in such a state, and here is where the BNP will eventually triumph I believe.</p>
<p>The only question that remains, is if they will be heard and voted into power while there is still a Britain worthy of the name?</p>
<p>I say, God let it be so!</p>

			<p>  Britons are right! Increasing Third World immigration leads to environmental degradation, overcrowding, crime, ethnic conflict, and huge governmental expenses. The only ones to benefit are real-estate developers, diversity trainers, and racial hucksters of all colors and persuasions.</p>

<p>I believe the BNP or something like it will eventually triumph too. It will just be window dressing, however, to make the remaining whites feel better, keep the taxes rolling in, and to bring a bit of common sense and decency to everyone. Britain is toast, though. Wales and Scotland will end being cordined off as reservations for whites in the UK. </p>

			<p>England has actual physical boundaries and not very big ones.  The beginning of the end of the open-ended immigration period may be at hand as England seems just about full-up.</p>

<p>GOOD THINKING, British friends&hellip; Afer all, it&rsquo;s a safe bet your hard-earned tax money will SUPPORT THE IMMIGRANTS AND THEIR BROOD IN PERPETUITY! In addition to which, you&rsquo;ll be thanked for your generosity with a steep increase in crimes committed by people turning out to be immigrants. Your children asssaulted in school by groups of young thugs. You or your wife standing an excellent chance of being stabbed for your wallet or purse   &mdash;   again by third-world immigrants. Unless, of course, those stabbings and muggings in the British news is just filler material dreamed up by the editors to use up otherwise empty newspaper columns.</p>

<p>The big cities of Wales and Scotland are suffering large scale immigration of foreigners as well. In Edinburgh, ten years ago there were a few (South) Asians but very few Africans. Now there are non-whites everywhere you look. The transformation in just ten years is incredible.</p>
