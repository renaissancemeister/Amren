<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A company that owns 11 McDonald&rsquo;s restaurants in Nevada was fined one million dollars Wednesday after pleading guilty to employing 58 illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The company pleaded guilty in federal court in Las Vegas to conspiracy to encourage and induce an alien&rsquo;s unlawful residence in the United States and aiding and abetting an alien to remain in the country, the department said.</p>
<p>The company&rsquo;s director of operations also pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting an alien to remain in the country.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>About 30 of the illegal workers have returned to their native countries while the rest were allowed to stay in the United States until the case closes.<br>

			<p>A million dollars is a hard hit for a company that owns only 11 stores.</p>
<p>With 58 illegal aliens, that&rsquo;s over five per store.  Thinking back on my own time at McDonald&rsquo;s, there were about six workers per shift, plus a manager or assistant manager.  This means that about 1/3 to 1/2 of the workers these folks hired were illegals.  How likely a cooincidence does anyone think that is?  Since the company was deliberately discriminating against American citizens in their hiring, a class-action lawsuit by any US citizen who had applied for work and was turned down would be warranted.  Damages should be the company&rsquo;s remaining assets.  </p>
<p>The director of operations who pleaded guilty to a felony is going to get some federal prison time for it.  He&rsquo;ll be camp-eligible, so he won&rsquo;t be going to an FCI (a.k.a. &#8220;gladiator school&#8221;), but sentencing guidelines tie a judge&rsquo;s hands, and there is no parole in the feds anymore.</p>
<p>This is the right approach to the problem.  Simply sending the illegals home accomplishes nothing in the long run, as the third world is full of people, but heavy fines and prison sentences for those who hire them instead of Americans will act as a strong disincentive on our end.</p>

			<p>The Immigration Reform Act of 2006 made it illegal to employ &#8220;undocumented workers&#8221;.  Although a lot of people were/are upset that the act didn&rsquo;t go far enough, it still hit the crux of the issue right in the pocketbook.  Fewer work opportunities means fewer illegals.</p>

			<p>     I remember talking to a Mexican years ago. He was doing a menial job. He told me he wasn&rsquo;t even making the minimum wage. He said that after he cashed his check, he was forced to kick back some of his wages in cash to his boss or else he would be fired. Sometimes American business is our own worst enemy.</p>

			<p>Well, a company that owns 11 McDonald&rsquo;s restaurants should be pulling in about $200,000 to $250,000 in profits per store, per year; thus, these treasonously greedy pigs are making between $2.2 million to $2.75 million a year. So this fine amounts to between about 45% to 36% of the group&rsquo;s yearly profits. So while this is a good start, it is hardly enough in my book, they should be fined $58 million dollars and get 58 years in prison each for their crimes. To me that would be the most fitting punishment, considering the number of invaders they preferred to hire over citizens.</p>
<p>However, no cloud is without its silver lining; I intend to print up several copies of the original article, and then take them and leave a few between the tray stacks on top of the trash receptacles at my local fast food pits. They all employ swarms of &#8220;Latinos&#8221; that barely speak English, so maybe they will get the hint?<br>

			<p>Does this mean the next time I take my kids to McDonalds the cashier will understand our order placed in English? Why are the other 28 Illegals still working there? The company&rsquo;s director of operations deserves a nice jail cell for a good long time. Now they need to do more of the same.</p>

<p>Like closing the barn door after the horse ran away.  The &#8220;Immigration Reform Act of 2006&#8221; might have done that (I think it&rsquo;s already a violation of FedLaw), but then it turns right around and gives soft amnesty to illegal aliens.  Why bother worrying about employing illegal aliens when the act makes them legal?</p>
<p>Similarly, virtually every open borders politician has come out for &#8220;border security.&#8221;  For them, it&rsquo;s a vacuous phrase that means unmanned aerial drones that accomplish nothing.  However, since they all want amnesty, even the 100% best border security would be useless if they&rsquo;re going to have the attitude that we should let everyone in.  What would there be to secure, verily?</p>

			<p>McDonalds used to be an American icon but now it&rsquo;s associated with a multicultural globalist agenda.  There seems to be one on every corner and yet it seems the quality of their food has deteriorated over the years, due to either my tastes having  changed or they&rsquo;re using less quality ingredients.  Their advertising is blatantly anti-White.  Check out the images on the paper bags next time you get an order.  You see either alot of odd looking nonwhite people or racially ambiguous freaks.   </p>

			<p> Greedy American business is indeed its own worst enemy.</p>
<p> I know a couple of painfully average guys who for some bizzare twist of fate got their contractor licenses. They told me they hire mostly illegals, pay them 1/2 of what a union guy would get. No overtime given. No insurance, if one gets hurt he drops them off at the local emergency room. No payroll taxes (33% in my state ouch!). No unemployment insurance. No social security tax. No safety equipment. Whats worse, both of them belong to my church (Im a Mormon). They dont even try to rationalize it. They talk about &#8220;I have to provide for my family&#8221;. <br>
 I wait for the day the feds show up at their worksite.</p>

			<p>This is grandstanding for the elections.  McDonalds could be found to employ many more illegals; this is how they operate.<br>
The colonization of USA by millions of illegals and their babies is systemic self destruction brought to US by disfunctional non operational Federal incompetancy.  After they fail to enforce National security/immigration laws; instead of deporting they give away the house!   There is systemic dysfuncion from DC to the agenices in the field.  No one is being held accountable.<br>
Remember: 9/11 was a result of immigrations and ID fraud. many of the operatives had multiple DL&rsquo;s .   If the states do not take control of the problem it will continue.  The Feds have had more than enought time and laws: they never enforce to defend US.  It just gets worse.  V</p>

			<p>Since the case is not yet closed, the 28 remaining illegals are probably being kept around so they can give court testimony.</p>

			<p>Finally someone is enforcing the law.  Any business that hires illegals needs to be given the maximum fine.  Furthermore; we need undercover agents who pretend to be illegals hanging out at their usual places.</p>

The &ldquo;Immigration Reform Act of 2006&rdquo; might have done that (I think it&rsquo;s already a violation of FedLaw), but then it turns right around and gives soft amnesty to illegal aliens. Why bother worrying about employing illegal aliens when the act makes them legal?&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Yes, the barn door has been left open.  But one has to deal with reality, and the reality is they&rsquo;re here.  Although the idea of rounding up millions of illegal immigrants at one fell swoop and mass-deporting them may be attractive to some of you, sheer logistics, not to mention our birthright citizenship law (anchor babies ARE United States citizens), and the inevitable human rights issues and custody court cases that would follow make the fantasy untenable.  You can&rsquo;t just rip parents away from their children.  Get real.  Chipping away at the reasons illegals come here will HELP the situation.  Notice I didn&rsquo;t say SOLVE.  We need to change our birthright citizenship law, but that would require a constitutional amendment, which would take a very long time.   Employment laws are much easier to maintain and prosecute.  That&rsquo;s just one facet of the solution.</p>
<p>Yes, we need to close the border and also need to work to enforce existing laws.  As money gets tighter for the average American, people are going to get tired of illegals fussing and claiming rights and benefits.  </p>
<p>As for the &#8220;soft amnesty,&#8221; in my opinion it&rsquo;s akin to requiring people to register firearms.  It will allow for identifying and monitoring illegals, and will provide a more efficient way to deport those who refuse to accept the &#8220;soft amnesty.&#8221;  In general, public opinion will be more opposed to illegals who won&rsquo;t play within the system; they will appear more criminal.  And yes, public opinion DOES matter   &mdash;   what else is politics but public opinion?  </p>
<p>Of course, the archaic press will still attempt to portray these people as victims, but since the rise of the internet more Americans are learning to ignore the press.</p>
<p>Change takes time. </p>

			<p>McDonalds also supports the gun-control agenda, but the fundamental reason Americans should avoid it is that there are simply better places to eat.  In Colorado Springs, there are so many good sit-down restaurants that run lunch specials that I can&rsquo;t understand how the fast food places stay in business.  When I was still a chemist, co-workers and I would go out to eat once a week, and it would be to Suehiro for Japanese, San Chang for Korean, Marigold&rsquo;s for French soup and sandwiches, Molicca&rsquo;s for Italian sandwiches, or the Empire Asian Buffet for mixed Asian all-you-can-eat.  Life&rsquo;s too short for bad food.</p>

			<p>  McD,S has gone steadily downhill. I used to attribute it to teen workers and shrug it off. I think every mcds in Md. has hispanic workers. Don,t speak English either. I watched them build a new mcds with an all hispanic construction crew. I guess i,m done with them. They put toys from China in their happy meals. If they are an international company why can,t they put toys in from the country they,re operating in? Hey mcds you made your first fortune in USA,how about some loyalty and hire Americans and buy American and maybe people will come back? Did you see that burger king commercial where that black guy calls a white guy an arrogant punk? BK was my favorite but guess i,m done with them too.</p>

All nice, no doubt.  But how about AMERICAN food? Are there are any AMERICAN restaurants left in Colorado Springs, or have they all  gone global?</p>
