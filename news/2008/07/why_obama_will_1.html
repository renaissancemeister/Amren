				Why Obama Will Win
			</h1>
			<p class="byline">
				<i>Jared Taylor, <font color="red">Special to American Renaissance,</font> July 25, 2008</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				It is time to get used to the idea that the next president of the United States will be black. Why will a nation we are so often assured is &#8220;racist&#8221; elect a black president? And will it make a difference?
			</p>
			<p>
				Ever since Hillary Clinton dropped out of the race, the polls have reported consistently that Barack Obama will beat John McCain. The media love to tell us that whites say they support the black candidate and then vote for the white, but there is no reason for whites to lie in this campaign. Mr. Obama will not get a majority of the white vote but he will get enough to beat Mr. McCain. Why will so many whites vote for Mr. Obama?
			</p>
			<p>
				First, some support his policies. They want to end the war in Iraq, and they want the standard liberal program of socialized medicine, higher taxes, more handouts, and more government. There has always been a substantial minority of whites who vote this way, and they have a clear favorite in Mr. Obama.
			</p>

					</tr>

			</div>
			<p>
				Second, as many people have pointed out, an enormous number of whites think it is deeply virtuous to vote for a black &mdash; not for an out-and-out race man such as Jesse Jackson or Al Sharpton, but for an unthreatening, well-scrubbed black who speaks standard English and promises to &#8220;bring us together.&#8221; Even if they live sharply segregated lives, whites thrill to the language of &#8220;coming together,&#8221; and they adore blacks who don&rsquo;t act or sound black.
			</p>
			<p>
				For many whites, voting for Mr. Obama will be an act of high patriotism. Electing him will prove America is not &#8220;racist,&#8221; and many whites believe that rising above &#8220;racism&#8221; is America&rsquo;s sacred calling. One must never underestimate the importance to whites of feeling virtuous. Most would rather lose a leg than be thought a &#8220;bigot,&#8221; and a vote for Obama is a painless way to burnish anti-racist credentials.
			</p>
			<p>
				Third, young whites will line up for Mr. Obama. They have been swallowing anti-white, multi-culti propaganda all their lives and have not knocked around enough to discover it is false. Some who know their parents will vote for Mr. McCain will make a special point of voting for Mr. Obama. Every new generation thinks it is cooler, hipper, and wiser than any generation that ever lived, and what could be cooler, hipper, or wiser than putting a black man in the White House? For many young whites, a vote for Mr. Obama will be a denial of every uncool, unhip, and especially every even faintly race-realist thing their parents ever said or did.
			</p>
			<p>
				Fourth, although the country seems to have a collective memory of no more than two weeks, Americans think everything is &#8220;historic.&#8221; Whenever someone breaks an obscure record in professional baseball we are told history was made. If you ask someone why he waited in line all night to buy the first Apple iPhone he will tell you it&rsquo;s a &#8220;historic&#8221; product. Americans love anything that is &#8220;historic,&#8221; and for people who think a few more stolen bases are &#8220;history&#8221; right up there with the Battle of Lepanto, putting a black man in the White House will be the discovery of America, Pearl Harbor, and the Second Coming all rolled into one. Many whites will vote for Mr. Obama because they want to think they helped &#8220;make history.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				The media, which has its own grim reasons for supporting Mr. Obama, is mesmerized by the same prospect. Editors salivate at the thought of writing headlines like &#8220;History is Made&#8221; the day after the election, and some will lose all self-control and add an exclamation mark. The emphasis, of course, will be on Mr. Obama as the first black president, implying more to come. The media, which always subtly boost the Democrat, will be even more blatantly partisan this time, downplaying every blunder Mr. Obama makes and highlighting Mr. McCain&rsquo;s.
			</p>
			<p>
				Fifth, many whites will vote for Mr. Obama &mdash; or at least not vote for Mr. McCain &mdash; because the Republicans have nominated the most stunningly unattractive candidate in years. Old and pock-marked, Mr. McCain is thoroughly disliked in the Senate for arrogance that he cannot even hide from voters when he is not speaking from notes. He has dismayed Republicans by promoting amnesty for illegals, and dismayed everyone else by saying America should stay in Iraq for 100 years if it takes that long to &#8220;win.&#8221; Mr. Obama therefore has the enormous advantage of running against an opponent that not even Republicans like.
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr. Obama will also crush Mr. McCain in face-to-face debates. Mr. McCain cannot put an unscripted sentence together any better than George W. Bush can, and will come across as a thick-witted geezer. Mr. Obama, who is as glib as any politician, gives credence to H.L. Mencken&rsquo;s definition of democracy as &#8220;rule by orators.&#8221;
			</p>

			</div>
			<p>
				But what about America&rsquo;s storied &#8220;racism&#8221;? Isn&rsquo;t America brimming with people who can&rsquo;t bear the thought of a black president? Americans have been numbed for decades by attractive television-blacks who read the news, forecast the weather, and tell us which brand of toothpaste to buy. Americans get a steady diet of heroic movie-blacks who outsmart and beat up white brutes, solve baffling technical problems, dispense sage advice, and save the world. Even the current Miss USA is black. There are millions of whites who do not want to live with blacks or have much to do with them, but would a black president be much different from nearly eight years of black secretaries of state? The march of blackness may be vaguely worrying to whites but they think there is nothing they can do about it and that they shouldn&rsquo;t even if they could.
			</p>
			<p>
				The final reason why whites will vote for Mr. Obama is that the Republicans do not have the backbone to attack him in the only way that would work. If they were serious, they would fill the airways with Jeremiah Wright prancing and raving, along with the message: &#8220;This is the man who married Mr. and Mrs. Obama, baptized their children, and whom Mr. Obama calls a &lsquo;family member&rsquo;.&#8221; They would buy radio ads quoting Michelle Obama&rsquo;s thesis in which she says she will always be black first and American second. Mr. McCain has nothing like the stomach for a campaign like this.
			</p>
			<p>
				Many blacks probably think he has the stomach for considerably worse: 57 percent think Mr. Obama is in greater physical danger than any white politician, and many say they would have warned him not to run, for fear he would be killed. An assassination would certainly be a shattering event. There is no telling how many cities would go up in flames, and Third-World countries, which have followed the Obama nomination with unprecedented interest, would help make it the most widely reported killing in history. (I have just returned from a Muslim country in which everyone has heard of Mr. Obama and likes him, but most have never heard of John McCain.) Whatever gruesome fantasies blacks may be spinning, however, assassination has gone out of style in America, and white resistance &mdash; such as it is &mdash; is dependably nonviolent. Mr. Obama will be perfectly safe.
			</p>
			<p>
				In any case, Mr. Obama will win far more white votes than he will lose because he is black. Whites who don&rsquo;t want a black president would not vote for a Democrat anyway. As for black voters, even nominal Republicans are said to be running for the doors, but strictly racial voting has always been fine for blacks. Not so for whites, of course. Just try telling your co-workers that you disagree with Mr. McCain but are voting for him because he is white.
			</p>
			<p>
				Racially conscious whites will be in a quandary in November. Even if Mr. McCain&rsquo;s policies are worse than Mr. Obama&rsquo;s should they vote for the white man &mdash; one with an adopted Bangladeshi daughter and who long ago betrayed white interests? Even after years of being softened up with black heroes and figureheads, a black in the White House is a powerful symbol of white dispossession. A mulatto president is an almost explicit endorsement of miscegenation. This is bitter medicine.
			</p>

			<p>
				Some whites have argued that a black president would undercut the charges of &#8220;racism&#8221; whites are forever facing, but they are dreaming. The entire government could look like a meeting of the Mystic Knights of the Sea, but as long as blacks are worse off than whites we will be blamed for it. Sensible whites cannot cheerfully vote for either man; I suspect most will stay home or vote for a minor candidate.
			</p>
			<p>
				Aside from the symbolic impact, which cannot be calculated, will President Obama be much different from a President Hillary Clinton? She would lard her cabinet with blacks and Hispanics, nominate ultra-liberal judges, push for amnesty, grovel before non-whites everywhere, and load up the &#8220;civil rights&#8221; division of the Justice Department with anti-white sharks. She would certainly make a bigger fool of herself over Hispanics and Asians (see &#8220;Turning Up the Pressure,&#8221; AR, May 2008). Our choice, therefore, could not be more disagreeable. On balance, we get to decide which is the more degrading spectacle: deluded white people giving their country away or clear-eyed blacks helping themselves to it.
			</p>
			<p>
				President Obama will, however, face special pressures. He can&rsquo;t let the pushier brothers walk all over him, but he will have to throw them enough bones to keep them off his back. It will be a tricky balance. Mr. Obama&rsquo;s first annual address to the NAACP will be a love feast, but every year after that it will be harder to explain why black unemployment, poverty, and incarceration rates haven&rsquo;t changed at all.
			</p>
			<p>
				Even Mr. Obama&rsquo;s star-struck white supporters will eventually wonder what happened to all that &#8220;change&#8221; he promised. There is not going to be change. The system is far too stuck in its self-serving ways for that. With the help of an enlarged Democratic majority in Congress, Mr. Obama may set up some wheezing, byzantine form of socialized medicine, but no one will be happy with it. If Mr. Obama inherits a sick economy, a weak dollar, expensive oil, and shrinking revenues, Americans will not at all like the change they get.
			</p>
			<p>
				On the bright side, with Mr. Obama we have a good chance of piquant First-Lady behavior. What will the White House be like with Michelle in charge? Will she want a new exterior paint job? How and whom will she entertain? Will the Big Man&rsquo;s guest bedrooms &mdash; in the African tradition &mdash; be turned over to third cousins from Kenya and the South Side of Chicago? There is no telling with what improprieties large and small Mrs. Obama will entertain us as she makes up her mind whether she is an American.
			</p>
			<p>
				It will be an edifying presidency; and whites may be a little less deluded in 2012.<br />

				Fine. It will become the beginning of the European American renaissance. I believe that successful, Spanish(i.e., European, not Mayan or Aztec) oriented Spanish heritage upper middle class folk will join with northern and eastern europeans in this battle.All European and European culture lovers(this includes some Asians and Jews) must be included in a coalition for victory over african/third world barbarism and communism.

				if obama wins, let the republicans know that cultural presevation and ethnic integrity are real issues. we will not beome slave to Goldman Sachs, China or his Chicago hotel and commodities buddies, let alone the hordes of shrieking blacks demanding &#8220;rights&#8221; without a fight. Obama is weak. He has yet to face someone who is willing to say NO, GET OUT.

				There is just one thing that they didn&rsquo;t consider. Many whites like the idea of being color blind in pulic but in private it&rsquo;s a whole different story. If you could put the stop light on many whites as the voted they would vote for Obama but voting is a very private matter.
			</p>
			<p>
				It&rsquo;s much easier just to tell all the liberals at the office that you voted for Obama than actually doing it. You can be cool and still vote for the white man, who will ever know. The last I herd voting is by secret ballot.

				It seems like Presidents for a LONG time have waged war on their subjects. I would not be surprised if Obama does the same. An Obama Presidency will probably mark the end of Black America.

				I would disagree with the idea there wont be change. I remember when Ronald Reagan became president. It really appeared he was able to turn the economy around. Unemployment and interest rates at the time were both around 15%. Reagan, who made running the country look so easy, stopped a lot of change. The country is in bad shape now, if Obama can turn that around, he may be able to push through a lot of changes the Democratic party say they are in favor of.

				When Jared writes &#8220;whites thrill to the language of &ldquo;coming together,&rdquo; and they adore blacks who don&rsquo;t act or sound black.&#8221; I would have to agree that&rsquo;s true, however, they often defer to blacks who have some sort of street-cred even more than they do to the ones who sound white.

				The one thing that troubles me most is race mixing. BHO is the poster child for race treason. A White who mates with Blacks is more than simply lost to us, as if they&rsquo;d been killed. They are strengthening the forces of barbarism and tyranny. When you have to sit across the table from Africans at Thanksgiving because your brother chose to create different offspring, you have been humbled more thoroughly than if Soviet tanks had parked in your driveway. Has anyone here ever read the book &#8220;Hunter&#8221;?

				I tend to disagree with this assessment. Yes, there are many whites who will vote for Obama for one reason or another, but far fewer than the number he needs to win the election. Every indication is that at this moment obama and McCain are neck and neck. Obama has only a 31 percent favorable rating among whites, with the majority saying they don&rsquo;t know enough about him rather than admitting they have an unfavorable view. Whites are going to have to ask themselves one question, I&rsquo;m I ready to see a black guy, a follower of Black Liberation Theology, with a black wife and kids, and all their black relatives, and friends shucking and jiving in the White House? It&rsquo;s the question they are going to have to answer in the privacy of the voting booth, and that answer will be resoundingly &#8220;no.&#8221; We may not like McCain, but he is a safer bet than obama. Every single one of us who regularly read this website have a duty to fully inform everyone we know about our feelings, we can no longer preach to the choir. If we want whites to vote as whites, we must get out there and work to see that it happens.

				&#8220;Republicans do not have the backbone to attack him in the only way that would work. If they were serious, they would fill the airways with Jeremiah Wright prancing and raving, along with the message: &ldquo;This is the man who married Mr. and Mrs. Obama, baptized their children, and whom Mr. Obama calls a &lsquo;family member&rsquo;.&rdquo; They would buy radio ads quoting Michelle Obama&rsquo;s thesis in which she says she will always be black first and American second. Mr. McCain has nothing like the stomach for a campaign like this.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				Not only would the Republicans score some heavy points for McCain in attacking Obama as described above by Mr. Taylor, their intense highlighting of such black anti-white hatred and black racism would be brought front and center, forcing blacks to answer for their many acts and words of racist hatred, which very likely would cause an appreciable abatement.
			</p>
			<p>
				Certainly there is the very real possibility that those kinds of attack tactics would also be enough to get McCain elected. Though I intensely dislike him, I definitely do not want to see a black racist with an anti-white wife in the Whitehouse.
			</p>
			<p>
				In all honesty, I think this black will get elected, specifically for the reasons outlined above, but most especially because this McCain has his finger in the eye of almost every staunch social conservative in the country, when it comes to immigration and Iraq.
			</p>
			<p>
				When he began winning primaries over Romney, I couldn&rsquo;t quite believe my eyes. I was certain he was out of there at the beginning, and I&rsquo;ve tried to understand why he was able to get as many supporters as he did, but it&rsquo;s still a mystery to me, unless it was due to the political machine that the neo-cons now have in place.
			</p>
			<p>
				I think we all should use the next four years uniting under one cause, prepared to the hilt to defend ourselves, watch, wait, and act when the opportunity presents itself. I think we should always keep in mind that this country right now is a near basket case economically, and has horrible race relations that will undoubtedly get far worse, so it is no exaggeration to say that we are on the brink and when a nation is in such a precarious position there&rsquo;s a very good possibility we could all be back to basics in the blink of an eye, at any time, day or night.
			</p>
			<p>
				It&rsquo;s trite but true to say that things will get a whole lot worse before they get better if either of these political demagogues are elected.

				I&rsquo;m surprised Mr. Taylor didn&rsquo;t mention reparations in this article. It seems to me that calls for reparations have nearly reached a boiling point among blacks. If they get a bro in the white house, won&rsquo;t one of the first things they do be to demand he enact some kind of reparations legislation? I think whites will be dismayed &mdash; very dismayed &mdash; if they elect Obama expecting to get &#8220;reconciliation&#8221; and get &#8220;reparations&#8221; instead.

				I don&rsquo;t know if you honestly believe what you wrote Jared or if your trying to motivate Whites to get off their behinds and vote against him, but I think you&rsquo;ve got this story wrong.

				Mr. Taylor stays as objective as objective can be. Of course not to liberals, to whom nothing but unqualified praise of non-whites is the only acceptable type of writing. But that attitude just goes to show the lack of any sense of levity or objectivity they have. The article is very insightfull and was enjoyable to read.

				Obama as president gives me nightmares. There isn&rsquo;t anyone in Congress or the Senate who would stand up to his policies for fear of being called a racist.

				Is there anything whites can do? Look at that poor family who was just beaten coming out of an amusement park. Why can&rsquo;t we form a group to go and protest Jesse Jackson?

				The Republicans are just too spineless, and stupid, really, to just tell it like it is. All they need to do is elaborate on the many anti-white, anti-American rants coming from those around Obama, revealing just exactly who he is, and I&rsquo;m pretty sure they could cause enough whites to back away from him he wouldn&rsquo;t get enough votes to win.
			</p>
			<p>
				Instead they&rsquo;re in their usual role as managers whose prime objectives are to oil the squeaky wheels and to keep things running smoothly, and to pretend they&rsquo;re too good and pure to discuss the subject of anti-white hatred and violence against whites by blacks to win an election, and I&rsquo;m betting they don&rsquo;t have a clue that they&rsquo;re screwing up big time, as usual.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are many Jeremiah Wrights in the black community and there are many black parisioners just like the ones at Trinity Church who cheer when hate speech is directed at whites, and there is no way this Obama isn&rsquo;t affected by all that anti-white, hate-filled propaganda, making him very dangerous for whites to be the leader of this country, and it is the height of stupidity not to point those things out to the white population, so the Republicans are not only cutting their own throats they&rsquo;re letting down whites by not pointing these gross dangers and injustices. &#8220;Spineless,&#8221; may be a bit too kind to describe them.

				I think Jared Taylor has got it right. Whereas Shelby Steele looked earlier on at the American political and cultural landscape and in his book &#8220;A Bound Man&#8221; predicted that Obama could NOT win because he was torn between being what blacks needed him to be, versus what whites needed him to be, it is becoming clearer that Steele underestimated the extent to which white Americans want or need to &#8220;purchase&#8221; some &#8220;proof&#8221; that they are not racist, some easy dispensation for their &#8220;collective white guilt&#8221;. Actually, I think things will get more interesting if Obama wins. Various liberal claims that America is really running rampant with white racism and institutionalized oppression of blacks will become less credible, and those blacks who complain that their plight is caused by &#8220;The (white) Man&#8221; at the top and his power structure, will appear more disingenuous and deluded. Perhaps some whites will vote for Obama because they want to purchase dispensation from minority grievances against their race. Yet perhaps still others will vote for Obama so that they can enjoy watching the little earthquakes and friction on the fault lines that occur as black America staggers with its difficulty picturing its own success.

				While I&rsquo;d dearly love to say I think Mr. Taylor is wrong, I&rsquo;m sorely afraid he&rsquo;s right. Maybe it&rsquo;s going to take the election of the Mulatto Messiah to bring White America to its senses. If Obama were really as wonderful as he and his White supporters think he is, he&rsquo;d probably sweep all 57 states (he DOES think there are that many, doesn&rsquo;t he?) Anyway, I suspect a lot of American Caucasians who&rsquo;ve never heard of the old Southern expression &#8220;Uppity (N-word),&#8221; are going to find out exactly what the old Southerners meant when they said it.

				This goes to show that most whites have NO CONTACT WITH BLACKS! Thats all it shows, and that the media has given in to &#8216;white guilt&rsquo; being liberal, and given Obama a FREE RIDE!<br />
				There is some hope that Obama will be the &#8220;Gift that keeps on giving&#8221;, and I would agree, Obama will be flopping alot in his first 6 months. BUT the PRESS will cover for him, as they hid Roosevelts disability. How long the honeymoon lasts is anyones guess. He is related to Cheynee, he may get some help from him, AND he will LEAN on his advisers as Bush does. Bush just flops around like a tolken frat boy, no reason Obama can&rsquo;t.
			</p>
			<p>
				The thing about Obama is that he will push the boundries of acceptabiltiy, and that is the gift we are hopping for, to show America he is just a crazy, ego centric empty suit. <br />

				I agree with much of this, particularly the part about how &#8220;white racism&#8221; in any meaningful sense of the phrase is greatly overstated by blacks and liberals. The best reason to vote for McCain &mdash; which I&rsquo;m surprised Jared didn&rsquo;t mention - is that it is quite within the realm of possibility that one or two more Republican appointed Justices just might be willing to overturn Grutter. That said, I&rsquo;m voting for Obama because of the more immediate need of stopping McCain from his neocon foreign policy dreams and his immigration plans. I also think incessent cries of racism will be more obviously ridiculous with him in the White House.
			</p>
			<p>
				There is however one part of this essay that really rubbed me the wrong way, that is the suggestion that McCain&rsquo;s decision to adopt a Bangladeshi child may be some kind of strike against him from a racial loyalty point of view. I think that comment was in mean spirited and in poor taste. The fact is there are many childless couples who want to have children, cannot have them biologically, and for whatever reason (usually age requirements), are only able to do international adoptions which in almost all cases are non-white. I believe this was the case with Cindy McCain. White people who adopt non-white children because they wish to have a family but can&rsquo;t have their own children and can&rsquo;t adopt white kids should not have these circumstances held against them, as you seem to do with McCain.

				Shows you how brainwashed MOST Whites are. They always think they have to &#8220;prove&#8221; their &#8220;not racist&#8221;. Others hope by letting Obama become president blacks will finally realize Whites are NOT responsible for their problems and CHANGE their bad and violent behaviours. Its not going to happen. The potential for disillusionment with an Obama presidency is greater then any president in American history.

			<p>
				That means that if he is elected, he will be careful not to upset whites, because he will assume to a certain extent that whites think as he does regarding race.

				McCain, on the other hand, refuses to think racially.<br />
				And views racial thinking as evil. Not good for us whites.

				Bush lost the country for us. Only a man of Bush&rsquo;s track record could ruin an economy and divide a country like he has. Remember, he ran two companies into the ground while in Texas. The man is a certified moron. If a white Republican could do this bad it only gives credence and support to a smart black man who promises to give America back to Americans. I feel that America is too far gone for Obama or any qualified nominee to make a difference.
			</p>
			<p>
				I never thought that I would ever see a black as President but now it is a distinct possibility. I only hope that he sticks to principal and is not the black radical that Amren commentators make him out to be. But nobody was as radical as Bush in his neocon philosophy that sold America out to business hoping to make the most money at the expense of America. Bush committed treason against this country yet blithely remains in office. God help us if we have to endure another round of his legacy.

				&#8220;Third, young whites will line up for Mr. Obama. &hellip;. For many young whites, a vote for Mr. Obama will be a denial of every uncool, unhip, and especially every even faintly race-realist thing their parents ever said or did.&#8221;

				As a man in his early 20&rsquo;s I can say emphatically that I absolutely loathe my generation. Their &#8220;love&#8221; for Obama is truly nauseating. A perfect example is my ex-girlfriend who&rsquo;s 24 years old. From the day I met her, she didn&rsquo;t know what was going on in the world and could care less about politics. The girl didn&rsquo;t even watch the news. But all of a sudden after the media decided Obama was the next Messiah, she became VERY political and a wild-eyed supporter of Mr. Barack Hussein. My God, so many of us have become sheep&hellip; (Thank God I don&rsquo;t go out with her anymore) ;-)

				A personal note. Last week, I talk about BHO with three of his supporters. They tried to convince me that he would be great because of the usual reasons. All three are unregistered voters, I am registered. So it is McCain 1, BHO 0. I have yet to meet a BHO supporter who is registered. So do not let the crowds fool you. 200,000 Germans cheer him, who cares, not one can vote for him. Blacks, Hispanics, and the young have low voter turn outs. White people have a higher percentage.<br />
				McCain would be far in the lead, if it wasn&rsquo;t for the McAmnesty. The republican policiy should be no amnesty, build the wall and we will protect your jobs.<br />
				The rebubs should show the rev wright tapes about a week before the election. There is no point doing this sooner.

				I met a woman with high political connections in this country. She stated flatly that they want Obama as a President because then nobody in the world would criticize us because we would have collectively put on his racial armor. And our countries actions would not be called out because that country or person would then be guilty of racism.
			</p>
			<p>
				So they apparently think they will be needing this heavy armor for what they have in mind next. This reasoning frightened me&hellip;

				I have somewhat mixed emotions on this. On the one hand, a Obama presidency will encourage even more white women to have children with black men as they see how successful the offspring of Ann Dunham&rsquo;s mating with Barack Obama Sr. have become. Many will think &#8220;If I want a successful child, then the example of President Obama shows I should get a black father&#8221;.
			</p>
			<p>
				On the other hand, John McCain deserves to lose because of his treasonous immigration policy. And more importantly, while a Obama presidency might encourage some to race-mix, it might wake up others as their dispossession will be clear. If white America is to be dispossessed (which it will be both under McCain and Obama), it is better if that is illustrated clearly by the reality of a mulatto President, than if it is hidden by the apparent continued white rule.

				It&rsquo;s late and I would like to post something of my own for this article. But for now, I have before me a copy of Solzhenitsyn&rsquo;s Harvard Address and will attach some relevant excerpts. The reader can make his own connections between the quotes and Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s article.
			</p>
			<p>
				&#8220;Relations with the former colonial world now have turned into their opposite and the Western world often goes to extremes of obsequiousness&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				&#8220;A Decline in Courage may be the most striking feature which an outside observer notices in the West in our days. The Western world has lost its civil courage, both as a whole and separately, in each country, each government, each political party and of course in the United Nations. Such a decline in courage is particularly noticeable among the ruling groups and the intellectual elite, causing an impression of loss of courage by the entire society.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				&#8220;Political and intellectual bureaucrats show depression, passivity and perplexity in their actions and in their statements and even more so in theoretical reflections to explain how realistic, reasonable as well as intellectually and even morally warranted it is to base state policies on weakness and cowardice.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				&#8220;And decline in courage is ironically emphasized by occasional explosions of anger and inflexibility on the part of the same bureaucrats when dealing with weak governments and weak countries, not supported by anyone, or with currents which cannot offer any resistance. But they get tongue-tied and paralyzed when they deal with powerful governments and threatening forces, with aggressors and international terrorists.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				&#8220;Should one point out that from ancient times decline in courage has been considered the beginning of the end?&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				&#8220;Even biology knows that habitual extreme safety and well-being are not advantageous for a living organism. Today, well-being in the life of Western society has begun to reveal its pernicious mask.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				&#8220;Actually an outstanding and particularly gifted person who has unusual and unexpected initiatives in mind hardly gets a chance to assert himself; from the very beginning, dozens of traps will be set out for him. Thus mediocrity triumphs with the excuse of restrictions imposed by democracy.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				&#8220;many people living in the West are dissatisfied with their own society. They despise it or accuse it of not being up to the level of maturity attained by mankind. A number of such critics turn to socialism, which is a false and dangerous current.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				&#8220;After the suffering of decades of violence and oppression, the human soul longs for things higher, warmer and purer than those offered by today&rsquo;s mass living habits, introduced by the revolting invasion of publicity, by TV stupor and by intolerable music.&#8221; <br />
				<br />
				&#8220;no weapons, no matter how powerful, can help the West until it overcomes its loss of willpower. To defend oneself, one must also be ready to die; there is little such readiness in a society raised in the cult of material well-being. Nothing is left, then, but concessions, attempts to gain time and betrayal.&#8221; <br />
				<br />
				And finally, my personal favorite, although with so many riches to chose from it seems idle to pick just one&hellip;
			</p>
			<p>
				&#8220;Hastiness and superficiality are the psychic disease of the 20th century and more than anywhere else this disease is reflected in the press. In-depth analysis of a problem is anathema to the press. It stops at sensational formulas.&#8221;<br />

				I have never disliked or feared a politician more than Obama. Everything associated with him sends shivers up my spine..from his radical church and wife to his adoring fans who faint over his every move. It is my dream that somehow, someway he loses this election. I know he has a slight lead in the polls but like they say &#8220;It ain&rsquo;t over til it&rsquo;s over&#8221;.
			</p>
			<p>
				I live in a battleground state that could go either way. If my state does vote for Obama I will make an effort to move to a red state. I see that Obama is down big in the deep South as well as states such as Kansas. I want to move to a place like that and be surrounded by like minded folks.

				He should be worried about Jesse Jackson or any Black he upsets while in Office. After all, even the MSM allows itself to talk about what a problem Black on Black crime is. <br />
				I mean, look at what happened with Blacks when, after years of complaining, they finally got their own Record Companies and were controlling their own business affairs in a matter of the utmost &#8220;cultural&#8221; imporance to them - Rap. And look what they did! Wiped each other out with guns, with the media blaming it on a combination of White Racism and, yep, Guns.

				Oh, and his wife will have the distinction of being the UGLIEST First Lady in History. Only no one will say one word. Except maybe some Russians. At least I hope.

				Lastly, we should not forget that, all hype aside, there are still millions of Americans who have no use for the man and, perhaps more importantly, it is doubtful that Russian and Chinese and others will bow before this guy and shower him with unconditional love. In fact, just the opposite. My guess is a lot of people will see us as more vulneable than ever with him in the White House. And the only reason he is there is EXACTLY because the Office of the President in NO WAY means what it meant 50 years ago.

				As I have told my boss, who prayed for a Hillary victory, I wasn&rsquo;t voting against Hillary because she was a woman or against Obama because he is black. I was not voting for either of them because they are both died in the wool socialists. Of course, I can&rsquo;t say I care much for John McCain because he also leans to the socialist left too. My decision of who to vote for this year, has been the toughest I have ever faced, since I started voting in the 1980 election.

				Of course, in all honesty, I would not vote for Obama under any circumstances. He is a flash in the pants. But he is what the liberal left-wing loonies have been waiting for all their lives. He&rsquo;s their savior. He&rsquo;s their proof that they are not racist like the rest of us. He is the destruction of this country if he is elected.

				I must say that this is one of the few times, that I find myself in total disagreement with Mr. Taylor; moreover, I must state that I feel he is underestimating the &#8220;stealth&#8221; intelligence and drive toward survival that the vast majority of whites in this country still have. Saint Obama, despite all of the media hoopla and high idiocy surrounding him, has yet to crack a popular standing of more than 48% in the polls. John McCain, diseased weasel that he is, continues to hold a 41% to 43% electability rating. Until those numbers change significantly, it is no more &#8220;inevitable&#8221; that McCain will be defeated by him in November, than it is that I will be elected the Monarch of Multicultural Island in a stunningly &#8220;predictable&#8221; upset. As things stand now, given that the Democratic swine normally poll well because of their absurd Santa Claus and Easter Bunny polices early in presidential elections, it is far more likely that McCain has this election in the bag in the long run.
			</p>

				The national electorate of this country, still remains about 81% to 84% white; this election is going to be decided by us, and in a few key new &#8220;swing&#8221; states. Or put another way, while New York and California will remain &#8220;blue&#8221; and Ohio and Florida &#8220;red,&#8221; it would appear that Michigan and Pennsylvania might very well decide this election and both remain unpredictably &#8220;purple.&#8221; Saint Obama lost both of those states to Hillary in the Democratic primaries; however, let us note, that the good Saint BO was not on the ballot in earlier Michigan, but was in the later Pennsylvania contest. With that in mind and given that Pennsylvania is the darker &#8220;purple&#8221; of the two states on an equally white background, is it not safe to assume these are both really are up for grabs?
			</p>
			<p>
				And if McCain gets them both&hellip;???
			</p>
			<p>
				This is why I hold that Senator McCain will be our next US President. He will get it with about 59% to 61% of the white vote and an Electoral College &#8220;landslide.&#8221; Saint Obama might get 95% of the black vote over the normal 90% that goes to the Democrats; and 70% of the &#8220;Latino&#8221; vote that goes that same way over the expected 65%, but so what? Will it match my minor predicted shifts in the white vote?

				&#8220;I think things will get more interesting if Obama wins.&#8221; (Posted by WhiteIsAColor at 9:50 PM on July 25)
			</p>
			<p>
				Not TOO interesting, I hope! Here in Berkeley, where we are snuggled between two of the top 10 most dangerous cities in the U.S., the very black cities Oakland and Richmond, Ca., but where the residents like to pretend they are living in a multi-culti paradise in the making, I&rsquo;m assuming that the blacks are going to be even more of a problem if Obama is elected.
			</p>
			<p>
				Many blacks will be even more resentful that the new status they feel conferred upon them by a black being president is not matched by their becoming magically as well-off as whites. And whites will be even more confused than presently, since they expect blacks to be appeased by Obama&rsquo;s election.
			</p>
			<p>
				Possibly (and hopefully) I&rsquo;ll be proven wrong; certainly some blacks, at least, will recognize that they have misread the degree of white &#8220;racism&#8221; in the U.S. today, if a black can be elected president. But I can&rsquo;t believe that the large number of blacks who presently hate us will be willing to give up their &#8220;culture of resentment.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				As an immediate reaction to Obama&rsquo;s election, I look for the swagger on the streets to increase, the volume of rap to rise, and the degree of general obnoxiousness and rudeness presently shown by many blacks to increase.
			</p>
			<p>
				May events prove me wrong, and prove your somewhat more optimistic forecast correct! We&rsquo;ll both have front row seats here in Berkeley for the next act in the play.

				As Mr. Taylor has noted, whites are simply too nice. They take every opportunity to present themselves as virtuous and magnanimous. I&rsquo;d bet this has a biological basis involving endorphins. Doing good is a physical selfish pleasure.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is a great characteristic for a racially homogeneous society where helping everyone benefits everyone. In a racially mixed society, it&rsquo;s suicide because those who can&rsquo;t do for themselves will bleed the gullible dry.
			</p>
			<p>
				If Obama is elected, blacks will at first see this as a great victory but will quickly sour on him when he doesn&rsquo;t give them the big pay off they expected. Blacks believe leaders of elections are supreme dictators who can do anything and everything they want (that&rsquo;s why blacks will turn on Obama when he doesn&rsquo;t deliver). Blacks believe, with their win, elected leaders have access to all the money and power and they expect their black leaders to give it to them.
			</p>
			<p>
				There&rsquo;s no telling however, what Obama and his wife may do in office. Mr. Taylor does some good extrapolation at the end but who knows what wacky ideas Obama and his wife might propose. Forty acres and a mule or their 2008 monetary (with interest) equivalent? Giving speeches to black groups telling them they&rsquo;ve been cheated and robbed and they deserve compensation and more? There are things out of left field we can&rsquo;t even imagine.
			</p>
			<p>
				Or what demands are blacks going to make? Untold money for them of course but money, aid, and troops to Africa? Laws that give them supreme power over whites in which their opinion or feelings trump those of whites? Federal troops forcing white neighborhoods to integrate? Mandatory Afro-centric education for black and white students? Calls to empty our prisons of &#8216;innocent&rsquo; black men? There will be demands but again, we can&rsquo;t imagine what they are until they&rsquo;re proposed and some of them are going to be wild beyond speculation.
			</p>
			<p>
				We should be thankful this is happening while whites are still the majority. We can only hope Obama and his wife do everything they can to open the eyes of white people to the true intentions of blacks in power.

				Mr. Taylor,
			</p>
			<p>
				Yes Obama will win because he will he&rsquo;ll get nearly 95% of the Black vote and there are enough idiot White liberals who want to assuage their White guilt. However what is the downside? The country survived incompetents like Carter and Hoover it will survive a marxist like Obama. Obama&rsquo;s problem is his ideology not his race. The up side is that maybe Blacks will begin to see that it&rsquo;s liberalism that has harmed them all these years and not the White man.
			</p>
			<p>
				Lastly your quest of attaining a 90% plus white nation will not happen. Your efforts would be better spent fighting leftist ideologies.

				It is difficult to disagree with this article. Yes, whites will vote for Obama for the reasons stated. McCain is the perfect candidate to run against; he is hated by the conservative base of the party and lacks the will to win.
			</p>
			<p>
				To the poster who mentions the negative contribution of Christianity, I would agree with one proviso, viz. it is primarily Protestant Christianity which is the culprit &mdash; -just look at how multiculturalism has prospered in the Protestant nations of Europe and has been variously resisted in the Catholic portions(Italy, southern Germany, etc.). This is not to say that there are not strong trends in the modern Catholic Church which embrace the doctrine of liberation theology, for there are. Yet, Catholicism, as was well illustrated by the French intellectual reaction to the revolution of 1789, is essentially hierarchical in nature and bound to tradition(two things which are not true of Protestantism).
			</p>
			<p>
				I believe that Obama will be elected but that he will not be reelected. The main reason is that he will inherit an economy which is failing and his prescriptions to address this will only make the situation worse &mdash; such is always the case when socialist central government intervention is applied, something in which Obama believes in so far as he believes anything and something which has historically always failed. He will become one of the most hated figures in the history of the presidency, not only because of his economic policies (which will cause a drastic decrease in the American standard of living) but also because he will be pressured to make his cabinet into an affirmative action hall of fame(which will insure incompetence at the highest levels of government). He will be forced to pay back his black supporters (and to reaffirm his black credentials) by expanding the racial spoils system at a time when the US government is forced to maintain historically high levels of debt. He will also inherit the beginnings of the costs of the middle class welfare system(social security and medicare) as the baby boomers, mostly white, begin to retire.
			</p>
			<p>
				His wife will make the white house an object of nearly universal ridicule, as it will reflect her own anti-white racism and lack of intelligence. We will be able to look towards the spectacle of a new Zimbabwe with the Obama election. He will also follow his party&rsquo;s platform by making open borders the official position of the federal government, with special quotas no doubt for immigrants from Kenya, thus hastening the transformation of America from a majority white country into a non-white majority one. Whites who vote for him will live to regret their choice as will the country as a whole.<br />
				<br />
				There is one possible bright spot in this picture, viz. the possibility that 4 years (and if the Republicans are stupid enough, 8 years) of identifiably black rule over the executive branch of our government will create such havoc as to finally awaken white racial consciousness. Things will have to get much worse before this happens but an Obama presidency may be just the thing.

				Jared is right, of course, as the general white population has been poisoned by 100 plus years of &#8216;equality&rsquo; propaganda, and is ready to commit an act of self-destruction, for many of the reasons outlined by him, plus a few others. If a race of Vikings can be transformed by 1,000 years of Christianity and liberalism into the pathetic excuses for white people that we see in Scandanavia today, then anybody can be subverted. We have come to believe our own toxic and self-destructive Lincolnesque ideology, which has been compouded by the distortion of the liberal media and our enemies within. We are in hot water and don&rsquo;t know which way to squirm, because at heart, we are gullible, gutless race deniers, blindsided to reality.

				Jared Taylor&rsquo;s certainly among the most brilliant, fearlessly candid, and thus roundly vilified commentators extant.

			<p>
				Unfortunately, he nails this perfectly, to include his dead-on comments on the doddering and irascible old ninny who is Obama&rsquo;s opponent.

			<p>
				McCain certainly could employ any number of highly effective and unassailable attacks against the cartoonish Obama and his ridiculous and perpetually aggrieved wife, but as Taylor points out, he won&rsquo;t.

			<p>
				That a criminally inclined, bottom of the social order, perpetually and universally non-achieving minority comprising only 13% of the population could see one of its own in the White House bent on enacting its own agenda is indicative of a nation bent of suicide.

				This essay is extremely disturbing to me, because in my three or four years of reading AmRen I have found Jared Taylor to be invariably correct in his analyses. In this case, however, I suspect he is overestimating the number of caucasians who will be scammed into voting Obama by the relentless charm offensive of the MSM. There will certainly be many who do &mdash; WAY TOO MANY for my liking &mdash; but I don&rsquo;t believe there will be quite enough to push the Magic Mulatto over the top (though it may be nail-bitingly close).
			</p>
			<p>
				I&rsquo;m usually pretty confident about what I posit or predict on this site &mdash; but this time I&rsquo;m not at all. We&rsquo;ve still got over three months to go, and a lot could happen during that time: B. Hussein might make more alienating gaffes about typical bitter religious white gun-nuts; Michelle might slap a maid or an aide; who knows, the McCain campaign might even grow a spine and start running some effective attack ads.
			</p>
			<p>
				But as things stand now, my best guesstimate is that there aren&rsquo;t QUITE enough votes to make that New Yorker cover come to life.
			</p>
			<p>
				As I say, however, I am reluctant to say I can call &#8216;em better than Mr. Taylor &mdash; and that is why I&rsquo;m offering my Incredible Shrinking White Man Challenge:
			</p>
			<p>
				IF OBAMA WINS, I WILL DONATE $100 TO AMERICAN RENAISSANCE.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is not a &#8220;bet.&#8221; If I&rsquo;m right and Mr. Taylor is wrong, AmRen owes me nothing. It would be, rather, a &#8220;bonus&#8221; for Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s brilliance; and a &#8220;penalty&#8221; to me for doubting him.
			</p>
			<p>
				I urge ALL AmRen regulars to make this $100 pledge with me. Because if, come Nov. 4, Barack&rsquo;s battering ram DOES succeed in blasting open the Oval Office door, then come Nov. 5, EVERY ONE OF US will be Incredible Shrinking White Men and Women. And Mr. Taylor and his organization will need all the financial assistance they can get to defend our interests against the most white-hostile administration this side of Southern Africa.
			</p>
			<p>
				So who&rsquo;s with me on this one? Can I get a witness? A witness to whiteness, so to speak? I&rsquo;m not one of those Rich White Men you&rsquo;re always hearing about &mdash; just one of the Shrinking ones you DON&rsquo;T hear about. So if I can scrounge up a Franklin to fight the Obamanation, I know some of you fine folks can too. I urge EVERYONE READING THIS to please take The Incredible Shrinking White Man Challenge with me.<br />

				I, for one, will vote O&rsquo;bammy precisely for the purpose of making things MUCH worse. I think nearly all here agree things will get worse before better right? So why drag it out any longer? I&rsquo;d vote Al Sharpton if given the chance. Too many sheeple (as Mark Twain called white Americans) need some sharp jolt to awaken them. Let us hope then that O&rsquo;bammy will deliver just that and we may then begin to embark on the long uphill (yet perhaps not yet futile) fight to reclaim our heritage and our future.

				Whiteplight, I couldn&rsquo;t agree with you more. You are absolutely correct. Our religion has worked against us. Both Protestant and Catholic sects, have harbored illegals and they preach anti-white rhetoric instead of gospel. I personally find myself leaning more toward the old pagan religions for inspiration. I&rsquo;m not saying it is for anybody/everybody else, but it works for me. At least the Pagans preached self-reliance and self-worth. Christianity in the 21st century does not. At least not for whites. I will say here and now, if Obamanation does get elected, I will fly my U.S. flag upside down until he leaves office. We truly are a country in distress.

				I admit that I am a liberal, but I don&rsquo;t follow liberal ideology in lock-step on all issues. I am racist. When I see a black person, that&rsquo;s what I see until I actually speak with them. That makes me a racist, but I don&rsquo;t beat myself up about it. I&rsquo;m programmed to do so, and I believe that it may even be hard-wired into the human psyche. I think I charactize people by how I see them all of the time, so that makes me a human racist. LOL
			</p>
			<p>
				That being said, I believe that it&rsquo;s inexcuseable for a candidate to know as little about the issues that affect the American people as does John McCain. It&rsquo;s nice that he recently learned the difference between Sunni and Shia, since his record as a POW is his strong point, and so he should know about our military actions. He recently learned about how much we&rsquo;re paying for gasoline, as well. Good on him. What does he know about the Sunni Awakening? We still don&rsquo;t know, since he recently confused that with our Iraq escalation. If you look at his voting record, it&rsquo;s clear how he feels about veteran&rsquo;s issues.
			</p>
			<p>
				Barack Obama was not my first choice for candidate, but he seems to have a better grasp as to what&rsquo;s going on. He is a constitutional scholar, a communicator, and a man of reason. I don&rsquo;t see black when I look at him because I&rsquo;ve heard him speak and feel as though I know a little about him. I think we can lead him to do our bidding as our public servant better than we can McCain.
			</p>

				Black schmack. Who cares? I&rsquo;m confident enough in myself that a mixed race (remember he&rsquo;s white, too) candidate is no threat to me.

				I couldn&rsquo;t care less who wins. They&rsquo;re both disasters. The fact that we&rsquo;re even talking about an Obama-McCain election just proves how much this train wreck of a country has declined over the last fifty years.
			</p>
			<p>
				Having said that, however, I&rsquo;ve got to admit that I&rsquo;m going to enjoy the next four years. Whoever gets in is going to be a total disaster and I&rsquo;m starting to enjoy disasters. To a cynic like myself, they&rsquo;re very entertaining. The people who like to refer to themselves as the &#8220;American People&#8221; elected Bush twice and if they elect Obama or McCain to take his place, they deserve everything they get. As Mencken said:

The only story that matters is the demongraphic change from mestizo invaders that will render the US unrecognizable in 10 or 15 years.

				I am with John PM on this. Jared Taylor is a brilliant and corageous man but even he himself gets it wrong at times. Sometimes he gets an idea in his head, and just because it sounds nice to him, he will write an entire article on it while not once citing any evidence to back his claims up. He made this mistake when writing about how wonderful the Japanese are compared to white people and he is doing it here as well.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is fine and dandy for him to list one hundred reasons why he THINKS white people will vote for Obama, and then state them as facts without including any evidence for his conclusions. I haven&rsquo;t seen any evidence that white people in America are delusioned enough to put this man in office. Yes, there are many brainwashed whites, but there are also many more that are NOT. It disheartens me that Jared Taylor has so little faith in his own people.
			</p>
			<p>
				The only conclusion I can come to is that he perhaps wants Obama to become president and that is what has led him to come up with this mythological list stating faulty reasons on why most whites are stupid enough to put him in office. He also makes the mistake of discussing how awful McCain is without bringing to light the obvious fact that Obama is ten times as bad as he is.
			</p>
			<p>
				And for those of you who are thinking about voting third party, you need to look at reality. We aren&rsquo;t in Europe where they have 5 parties to choose from at once. In such an environment, Jared Taylor himself could easily get 30% of the vote. But wake up and look at reality. We are stuck with this two party system where everyone feels pressured to vote for the lesser of two evils, creating a system in which the likes of Ron Paul get no more than 2% of the vote at best. Your best bet is voting for McCain unless you want Obama in office. Trust me; you don&rsquo;t really have any other choice.

				I suspect that among many white folks there&rsquo;s a lot of anti-black feeling simmering just beneath the surface. Every black-on-white crime sends out a ripple effect, &amp; there have been so many crimes, large &amp; small, in the past several years that no one has escaped unaffected. Among the whites I know, race is a strictly off-limits topic, &amp; it wouldn&rsquo;t be if they had warm feelings for blacks.

				I am very disappointed with the DEFEATIST tone of this article.Jared is a very bright man with many useful insights..BUT it is not a foregone conclusion BO will be the next president.Whites may still show enough guts to defeat this dangerous mulatto.Jared seems to throw in the towel and prepare to laugh and lament at the hi-jinks of Michelle.BHO would be a political disaster for this country.More hate crime laws,holocaust denial legislation,a massive amnesty,leftist judicial appointments, etc.I will hold my nose and vote for McCain.Maybe Jared has become too conditioned to white racial views in Northern Virginia.In Oklahoma whites will bloc vote for the white candidate.I detest McCain.. but will vote for anyone other than a radical, mulatto.

				There&rsquo;s a rumor going around that the Republicans are sitting on something explosive to use against Obama right before the elections (called an October Surprise).
			</p>
			<p>
				Will they use it? Will the media deep-six anything the Republicans have against Obama as did the NYTs when they refused to print a rebuttal to Obama by McCain last week?

				Drudge writes:
			</p>
			<p>
				&#8220;&hellip;An editorial written by Republican presidential hopeful McCain has been rejected by the NEW YORK TIMES &mdash; less than a week after the paper published an essay written by Obama.
			</p>
			<p>
				The paper&rsquo;s decision to refuse McCain&rsquo;s direct rebuttal to Obama&rsquo;s &#8216;My Plan for Iraq&rsquo; has ignited explosive charges of media bias in top Republican circles&hellip;&#8221;

				Obama decidedly has the race card in his favor and any criticism of him (OR his ugly wife) will axiomatically be called racism and the speaker or writer branded as a racist &mdash; knowing full well his career will be on the line. With the Obama-fawning press, that makes for a powerful deterrent to speaking out against the Obamas.

				&#8220;&hellip;Kennedy&rsquo;s secretary of State, Dean Rusk, advised against the meeting, and Kennedy later declared the talks a disaster.

				Of course OK will go for McCain. It goes Republican for most Presidential elections. And of course MS and AL will go for McCain vs a black man. But they would have voted McCain even if the Democrat were HRC. That Obama is black, and that there are a lot of whites who would not vote for a black, doesn&rsquo;t alter the Electoral College calculus, because of those whites already live in solidly &#8220;red&#8221; states.
			</p>
			<p>
				What matters is MO and OH. Reputable polling from both states shows JSM and BHO tied, and considering the Bradley Effect, this means that McCain probably has a 5-10 point lead over Obama as of this moment.

				&#8220;Mr. Obama will also crush Mr. McCain in face-to-face debates. Mr. McCain cannot put an unscripted sentence together any better than George W. Bush can, and will come across as a thick-witted geezer. Mr. Obama, who is as glib as any politician, gives credence to H.L. Mencken&rsquo;s definition of democracy as &ldquo;rule by orators.&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
				Uh, excuse me? Did you hear the way Obama mumbled and stammered through questions at press conferences on his &#8220;world tour?&#8221; Obama may be good at delivering a speech when it was written by someone else and appears on a teleprompter, but he completely breaks down when having to react on the spot. McCain will destroy him in the debates (unless of course a member of the media slips a Obama a transcript of the proposed questions prior to the debate which is a real possibility). <br />
				Maybe it is just wishful thinking on my part but I doubt Obama will win for a variety of reasons: 1) He has already hit his ceiling in the polls. With all the hype and momentum surrounding Obama, anyone who hasn&rsquo;t already decided to vote for him isn&rsquo;t going to; 2) Democrats are always well in the lead in the polls at this point in the election. Mondale lead Reagan by 15 points in July. Obama is only ahead by about 4 percent; 3) Undecided voters usually go for the &#8220;safer&#8221; pick. McCain will pick up the current &#8220;undecideds&#8221; 2-to-1; 4) The Bradley Effect is real. It didn&rsquo;t show up in many of the primaries because its effect was cancelled out by a surge in new voters; however, it will show up in the general. Just look at what happened in New Hampshire (a state with few young, black voters to counter the Bradley Effect) - Obama had a solid lead in the polls then lost to Hillary. After adjusting for the Bradley Effect, rather than being down by 4 points, McCain is probably leading by about 6 points; 5) Part of Obama&rsquo;s current lead is based on his seemingly strong support from Hispanics in the polls. As any political scientist knows, Hispanics are unpredictable voters. Although the vast majority of Hispanics may be telling pollsters that they prefer Obama, I am doubtful that they will turn out in force to vote for a black man; and 6) the nomination of Obama marks a decisive day in American politics. Elections have now become nothing more than racial headcounts. I have a large number of in-laws who are working-class whites and life-long Democrats. They are ALL voting for McCain. The nomination of Obama has driven the last remaining &#8220;normal&#8221; whites out of the Democratic Party. It now belongs solely to ethnic minorities and leftist elitists / extremists. Maybe it is just wishful thinking on my part but I think the MSM is going to be absolutely stunned when their Messiah loses in a landslide. When that happens, watch out. We have all seen how blacks in Africa react when their candidate loses.

				I would agree with john PM, but I wonder how much cheating will go on. In the primary, Obama got a black federal judge to allow the polls in black areas of Cleveland to stay open, for no apparent reason. Any protest of this would of course be very racist. If Hillary couldn&rsquo;t get a fair shake, McCain sure won&rsquo;t.
			</p>
			<p>
				I can just see bus loads of blacks being brought in and voting with no ID. It would be a volatile situation to try to enforce any rules, and the press is completely in the bag for Obama. It&rsquo;s amazing, the tv and print media are all Obama.

				Some of who who keep talking about the Bradley effect need to realize that was in 1986. 22 years ago. The smae media made the same case in 1989 with David Dinkins of New York City, Doug Wilder of Virginia and Deval Patrick of Massachusetts.
			</p>
			<p>
				The fact is they all won their elections, perhaps by small margins, but they won!!!!

			<p>
				We cannot rely on the so-called &#8220;bradley effect&#8221; to be the case in 2008. At least 5,000,00 new voters are able to vote this time! It is safe to say that the vast majority will vote for Obama.

				It&rsquo;s a fact that most of the Liberal Whites voting for Obama have never lived around Blacks and have very little first-hand experience with Blacks. Many of them live in the Lilly-White north. Conversely, I&rsquo;ve lived in the South most of my life. I hold a far different perspective than someone from Maine or Vermont holds.

				The average Joe and Jill are too drunk/stoned to know what to do do.<br />
				The black president will be asked by his handlers to bring colored folk into the armed forces for the war that&rsquo;s nearly here, those non whites will have to honor their man. Plain and simple.<br />
				We need a non white army to colonize Africa, fight the Muslim and keep a handle on the folks to the south.

				I would like to point out to racial realists that an Obama Presidency would WORSEN the self-delusion of whites, not improve it. Any failures would be rationalized away (if not simply covered up). An important psychological barrier would be broken. Blacks could become President for God&rsquo;s sake. They must be at least equal to whites. The problem is, this isn&rsquo;t true. Yes, there are important reasons of racial competitiveness why blacks should not be President. They would, essentially, use the position to benefit blacks at the expense of everyone else. The ONLY race that does not engage in that behavior is whites. But, far more important is the fact that blacks are not competent. It is dangerous to give them even a shred of responsibility, let alone authority. A black man as POTUS would be a strong propaganda tool for covering this up. Any time anyone brought up the incompetence of blacks, in any way, the fact that Obama had been President would be brought up and charges of racism and lying would follow in the same breath. The result would be more AA, more special treatment, more&hellip;.pretending.
			</p>
			<p>
				But here is something not mentioned to this point. What do you think blacks will do when Obama loses? I suspect the answer to that is weeks of general rioting in every major city, with mass murder especially of whites. And what type of whites live in easy reach of blacks? Liberals.
			</p>
			<p>
				Think about this a second. You want to wake people up. REALLY wake them up in a way they cannot deny the truth any longer? Well, rampaging blacks, raping, robbing and murdering those that love them most, in large numbers, would be amazingly effective. Such a thing would turn liberals against blacks, once and for all. I rather think the problem would shift from trying to convince liberals to stop aiding and abetting the black menace to trying to convince them their are better solutions than the final one.

				I would vote for Bush and hold my nose, just like I&rsquo;m going to have to vote for McLame and hold my nose. The United States of America is a white country, and should not be headed by a non-white. Even a liberal pandering white would be preferable.
			</p>
			<p>
				I had this dilemma in 2000. When Pat Buchanan picked the nutty black woman Ezola Foster for a running mate, my decision to vote for him was put in limbo. After all, a vote for him was a vote to put a screwy black woman one heartbeat away from the Presidency. At the end of the day, I voted for Pat because (1) For who he is, and (2) I knew a close Bush-Gore race would have meant that most people who might have voted for Pat would have gone to Bush. And that my vote for him wouldn&rsquo;t have made him President.
			</p>
			<p>
				Third party candidates only do well when it is so well known that one of the two major party candidates is going to beat the other by a wide margin. If people get thinking it&rsquo;ll be close, the third parties won&rsquo;t do very well. Also, third parties do horribly in the deep south, because of the high number of black voters. Most blacks vote one way, and most of the whites react by voting the other way.

				Most Whites are lemmings too anesthetized by their creature comforts to give a damn about questioning the multiracial, egalitarian propaganda that the MSM spews 24/7. It is the present, but quickly eroding, material prosperity that keeps this sick circus on the tracks.
			</p>
			<p>
				Elect Obama or elect McCain? Ultimately it doesn&rsquo;t really matter with regards to our goals. What matters is that the negative consequences of multi-racialism continue to mount on the average White until a critical mass is reached where his cognitive dissonance is no longer physically or psychologically tolerable. He must be forced to pick sides.
			</p>
			<p>
				Even if we cut off all non-White immigration in the US today more than 50% of the children presently under the age of 5 are non-White. The deed is done, our country is dead. We are just now beginning to smell the stench of its rotting corpse.

				To schoolteachers comment about sitting across the table with Africans at thanksgiving, thats the problem, if someone in your family marries a black and has offspring, you feel you should sit at the table with them because its thanksgiving. Do not lower your standards, thats what caused all of this. If someone marries outside their race, disown them for ever and always. We need more anger towards our race traitors, not more tolerance. this was the norm many years ago, and by doing so, it kept peoples behavior where it should be. Ostracize anyone that says something politically correct, when you know its not true. be bitter and show it. Lets get back our standards.

I am serious when I say that I think Obama is just a &#8220;blocker&#8221; sent out by the Rodham crime syndicate to divert everyone&rsquo;s attention prior to the Democratic primary so as to protect Hillary from months of scrutiny. It will soon be &#8220;discovered&#8221; that Obama is unqualified to be president vis a vis his lack of a legal birth certificate or he (or his wife) will make some gaff and be forced to resign from the race. Then Hillary will step up and become the candidate with just enough time to sweep the election. I say it again: Hillary will be the next prez.

Reality is&hellip; Black Racism (under the guise of &#8220;Black Awareness&#8221;&hellip;see Michelle Obama&rsquo;s thesis) has now become virtue among just about all Blacks.
			</p>
			<p>
				And to think Whites&hellip; as Taylor nails it&hellip; (especially the younger generation with their baseball caps turned around backwards, and dressed like they are still 12 years old though they may be well-nigh into their 30s now), AREN&rsquo;T going to go out of their way to assuage the collective &#8220;White Guilt&#8221; that 44 years of MSM propaganda has polluted and infected them with and NOT vote Obama, is just being naive.
			</p>
			<p>
				And then?
			</p>
			<p>
				Yes, I agree with those who say that &#8220;Reparations&#8221; will become the hot-topic word of the Obama Presidency. &#8220;Black Entitlement&#8221; and &#8220;Black Empowerment&#8221; and &#8220;White Guilt&#8221; will be three more words that will begin to be bandied about the firmament with ever-increasing frequency through those in charge of broadcasting and the airwaves over at the MSM. Such heinous topics as &#8220;White-on-Black&#8221; crimes will reverberate over the nightly news at night while &#8220;Black-on-White&#8221; crime in general and specifically will be listed as &#8220;aberrations&#8221; or &#8220;isolated incidents&#8221;&hellip; indeed, as it already is now.
			</p>
			<p>
				And for us? Friends, we are already considered as the &#8220;Fringe.&#8221; How long into an Obama Presidency do you think such forums as this will persist before it is shut down.
			</p>
			<p>
				And suppose I&rsquo;m 100% wrong and McCain (farther to the Left than even Hillary, actually when it comes to Immigration) is elected? After the fires of the &#8220;Obama Riots of 2008&#8221; subside, you will see him running so far to the left politically in appeasement and placation of a certain minority-group that he will end up having made even Obama himself look conservative.
			</p>
			<p>
				In short&hellip; we all KNOW what&rsquo;s going to happen if Obama is elected and we all KNOW what&rsquo;s going to happen if McCain is elected, so best advice is to hunker down for the next few years&hellip; and maybe get a Concealed-Carry Permit if you don&rsquo;t have one already.

			</p>
			<p>
				IF OBAMA LOSES, THE CHARGE THAT AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS ARE RIGGED, WILL BECOME PERMANENT, AND SHRILL. Really, this system is copletely dead, regardless of the outcome. Wow. It just gets worse and worse, the more you think about it. I know there will be riots, regrdless of whether Obama wins or not. I know that if he loses, there might be hell on earth, in a black orgy of hatred and insane murder. But, seriously, is there any chance that our election system, or even the whole political structure can survive this election, if the Messiah loses?

				I agree with Whiteplight as to the corrosive effects of Christianity on Western culture, and I too am berated in other places for going on about it. Just read Gibbons regarding what this religion did to Rome. We seem as a nation stuck in the same downward spiral.

				I have a strictly hypothetical question for readers of Amren.com; There are two candidates running for president in November. You must all choose one of the two. Let&rsquo;s say the constitution is ammended so that Boy George can run again.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can either vote for Barack Obama, or the current president for a third term. For whom would you cast your vote?

				You know I think you&rsquo;ve hit on it dead center. This guy was a media darling, and it was apparent the media wanted him to run, because of his leftist leanings. That way whichever leftist ideologue came out of the Democrat primary would make the race one of a near-leftist against a radical leftist. They would rather have had somebody even more liberal on the Republican side, but they figured that wasn&rsquo;t possible, so they settled for McCain better a near-leftist than a conservative.
			</p>
			<p>
				Romney wasn&rsquo;t all I wanted, but he would be ten times better than McCain.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now all McCain has to do to guarantee defeat before the first vote is cast is to make Tom Ridge his running mate. That man not only is without any kind of fire in his belly, he doesn&rsquo;t have a spine. What a dull, lackluster duo that would be.

			<p>
				1. Obama will be the next president.<br />
				2. He will have a liberal Democratic Congress to work with.<br />
				3. He will push through and get an AMNESTY for all the illegals and he will push for and get more legal immigration.

				For almost the first time, I have to disagree with Mr. Taylor, who normally writes with a brilliant and logical style. Predicting the future is never easy, and the variables here are fuzzy enough that nobody will really know until Nov 5th. Some here say the Bradley effect is no more, and one pointed to Douglas Wilder in 1989. Well, he won by about 1 percent, while the White Lt Gov won by 20 percent. While the Bradley effect is possibly diminished by effect of a moaning orgasmic obamaphile press on an impressionable younger generation who lack the ability to critically analyze this situation, it is not dead. My guess is anywhere from 2 to 10 percent of the voting populace who claim to be for Obama will flip the lever for the White guy after enduring a firestorm of last minute doubt about their candidate. They may never admit it to anyone, not even their spouses. But the result will be an unexpectedly high electoral count for McCain as swing states go into his camp.
			</p>
			<p>
				Or maybe I&rsquo;m just dreaming a nice dream, that is, nice only as relative to the thought of the Obama family in the White House. McCain is not my candidate. Tancredo was.

				Here is a vital concept:

			<p>
				assimilation = miscegenation = racial death
			</p>
			<p>
				or
			</p>
			<p>
				balkanization = separation = racial survival
			</p>
			<p>
				From the perspective of our ultimate interests (genetic/racial continuity), whatever encourages balkanization is good; whatever encourages assimilation is bad.

				The book &#8220;Hunter&#8221; was written by William Pierce under the pen name Andrew Macdonald. The ISBN is 0-937944-04-1. <br />
				Synopsis: &#8220;Oscar Yeager is a former combat pilot in Vietnam, now a comfortable yuppie&hellip;faces this choice. He surveys the growing race mixing&hellip;the darkening complexion of the nation as the tide of non-White immigration swells. &hellip;it really is no choice at all: he is COMPELLED to fight the evil which afflicts America&hellip;scheming media masters&hellip;spiritually sick adherents of pluralism&hellip;&#8221; A fun read, about 250 pages, not great literature but a pleasant evening&rsquo;s diversion.<br />
				I also recommend &#8220;Unintended Consequences&#8221; by John Ross. It&rsquo;s about three times as long as &#8220;Hunter&#8221;, not so ideological, but more informative in other ways.

				I was hoping HRC would win the nomination, beat that old crusty illegal-alien-loving McCain, and give us four years of hell. THEN the Republicans would rally with someone BETTER who&rsquo;d swoop in and beat HRC and take back the White House.

				Of course, this is still possible. But the idea of that smarmy sneering anti-American Michelle Obama shacking up in the White House for four years makes my stomach churn.

				&#8220;Fine. It will become the beginning of the European American renaissance. I believe that successful, Spanish(i.e., European, not Mayan or Aztec) oriented Spanish heritage upper middle class folk will join with northern and eastern europeans in this battle.All European and European culture lovers(this includes some Asians and Jews) must be included in a coalition for victory over african/third world barbarism and communism.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				-Excellent post! This is exactly the kind of positive White consciousness we need! Once this broad coalition for White survival is formed, then we can adress the issues within the European descended communities, such as different sub-groups and ethnic and religeous differences but first ALL White people must become aware of how dire the situation is that we are in!

				From the first second I heard Obama speak, I knew that he was an anti-white, anti-American racist! Worse, Obama is already acting as &#8220;President of the World&#8221; and wishes to tear down all walls. The only walls to be torn down of course are the walls of Western Civilization at the complete and utter expense of all natives of Western Civilization.
			</p>
			<p>
				Obama calls for &#8220;change&#8221; and promises us all that we need in the way of jobs, health care, peace and unity, equity and prosperity for all, etc. Very similar to the things Hitler said during the early &#8216;30&rsquo;s&hellip; Germans were suffering with high unemployment and lack of health care, etc. Hitler told the masses that &#8220;things would be different.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				Obama is nothing but an empty suit full of empty promises for the types of &#8220;change&#8221; that only he and his cohorts desire&hellip; For us, this means the death of White America, our freedoms and liberty, our right to individualism and the pursuit of happiness, and our standard of living as we know it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Obama is the classic and over-the-top example of your Globalist Elite! Marxism, Socialism, Fascism&hellip; This ultimate and all-knowing snob knows what&rsquo;s best for us &#8220;uneducated masses who cling to religion and guns&#8221;&hellip;
			</p>
			<p>
				Tear down all walls, indeed!

				&#8216;&#8220;Your best bet is voting for McCain unless you want Obama in office. Trust me; you don&rsquo;t really have any other choice.&#8221; <br />

				I might consider a vote for McCain only if his running mate is anti-amnesty, like Romney (even though he signed a Big Government mandatory health insurance bill into law in Massachusetts). If he chooses a pro-amnesty running mate, I will vote Third Party. After the terrible, liberal, drunken-sailor-spending presidency of George W. Bush, the Republicans deserve to go down in flames.<br />
				I do worry about that fifth vote on the Supreme Court, however.
