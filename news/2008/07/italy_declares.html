<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Interior Minister Roberto Maroni asked the cabinet to approve his &#8220;countrywide state of emergency to deal with the exceptional and persistent influx&#8221; of immigrants.</p>
<p>Minister Maroni added that this would &#8220;strengthen the activity to tackle and deal the phenomenon,&#8221; but no details were made immediately available about what the order would entail.</p>
<p>Earlier this week the Italian parliament approved tough new laws which make illegal immigration punishable by up to four years in jail. Immigrants found guilty of certain crimes face deportation.</p>
<p>Italy has also started a controversial census of Roma which involved the fingerprinting and photographing of all adults and children over 14 years old.</p>
<p>Roma &mdash; sometimes referred to as gypsies &mdash; are often blamed in Italy for the rising crime rate across the country and in recent weeks camps in Naples and Rome have been targeted in arson attacks. Silvio Berlusconi, prime minister, has tapped into a vein of nationalist sentiment by toughening his government&rsquo;s stance on immigration.</p>
<p>Minister Maroni said that fingerprinting Roma gypsy children would ensure that those parents who sent their children out to beg instead of school could be traced and punished.</p>
<p>However it emerged yesterday that many Roma have fled the country because of the fingerprinting scheme which is taking place across the country and involves more than 150,000 people.</p>
<p>Massimo Converso, of the Opera Nomadi, a Roma charity, said: &#8220;We have received news that several hundred Roma who live in illegal camps have left because of fears over the census.</p>
<p>&#8220;The majority are in and around the city of Rome and they have left the capital and said they will only return once the census has been completed some time in October.<br>

<p>LOL  &#8220;Often &#8220;blamed,&#8221; obviously so described to create doubt in the minds of the reader that there is some question as to the accuracy of the statement and implying that right wing fanatics might be behind it all. </p>

			<p>The Roma are all over Europe now that Romania is a part of the EU.  <br>
This link:<br>
 (https://www.independent.ie/national-news/roma-fagin-gang-leaves  &mdash;  but-others-will-take-its-place-1428503.html)</p>
<p>is about the Gypsy pickpocket gangs that have moved into Ireland in the last couple months. </p>
<p>There are plenty of other horror stories about the Roma as well: mutilating their children to make them more effective beggars, etc.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re blamed but are they responsible? It should be easy determine. Does crime increase when they move into a new area? Are they the ones being arrested?</p>

			<p>Italy has discovered who it is, unlike the United States which doesn&rsquo;t know who it is, invites millions of people to come in and destroy whatever identity it still has, and then apologizes for having even a slight amount of national pride.<br>
Way to go, Italy! Now pay ITALIANS to have babies and don&rsquo;t pay foreign invaders.</p>

<p><br>
So glad to hear there is at least ONE white nation that still has a nationalist vein that can be tapped. </p>
<p>May the rest of Europe and the Anglosphere follow the Italian model for social regeneration. Show us the way, Italy!<br>

			<p>Having had experience of the thieving and underhand skills of gypsy children I would fingerprint the lot of them. <br>
Notice how, like Blacks, Gypsies are undergoing the same name changing tactics; they&rsquo;ll change from Gypsy to Traveller, Tinker, Roma, Diddycoi until their reputation catches up with them and society starts to apply ever more criminal and anti-social allegations against them. Then they are reborn with a new name, new identity. They seem to think that this constant namechanging will resurrect them pure as the driven snow and I think that to a certain extent this may work be working. Today&rsquo;s schoolchildren will read about current Roma victimisation, they will find no mention of Roma crime over the centuries. <br>

			<p>The real reason is that the biggest industry in Italy is tourism.</p>
<p>Gypsies are well known to target tourists.  Most countries have robbers and muggers.  But the Gypsies are the only group in the world who send 4 to 10 year old children out to surround, overpower and rob adults.  So these gypsy kids are a real menace to the tourist trade.</p>
<p>That is probably why Italy is cracking down on the gypsies, to keep the tourists coming. </p>

			<p>Now hold on a minute. How could the Gypsy&rsquo;s be responsible? Don&rsquo;t they really mean America&rsquo;s White People are somehow to blame?</p>

			<p>&hellip; but the way they crack down on the Gypsies is to finger print and retina scan the entire population&hellip; then at the moment of truth the EU will copy the data base and like they did to Ireland last week, refuse to allow the local government to deport the illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>In the case of Ireland they must now pay welfare and social security to the extended families of recently arrived immigrants.</p>
<p>How many democrats and republicans can fit into a red state?<br>
Ohh, MCCain&rsquo;s economic stimulus plan is really what we need!<br>
Obama is such a far sighted thinker&hellip;</p>
<p>Face it: the American people have lost the war for their own minds.  </p>

			<p>Blaming the Gypsies for crime is equal to blaming the blacks for crime.  Yes they do do a huge number of petty thefts, rapes and murders but compared to the local BAR Association they are pikers. </p>
<p>There is not going to be any Renaissance until something is done about government corruption starting at the county court house.  </p>
<p>Because it is probably accurate to state that any ten white trial lawyers, selected at random, have done more damage to and stolen more money from and killed more members of the White Race than all the black and gypsy criminals presently in county jail combined.  </p>

<p>Didn&rsquo;t this actually happen about two decades ago when the Mexicans kidnapped a DEA dude? The US government slowed the flow of Mexicans coming through to a trickle in order to pressure the Mexicans. There were even movies made about him.</p>

			<p>The problem lies with countries who eagerly dump their unproductive, dregs of society onto their neighbors. The liberal do-gooders in the neighboring countries allow the influx. Then, citizens and new-arrivals alike are left to sort out the mess. Italy certainly is not the only nation to have this problem. Their solution may be a little heavy-handed but it might be the only effective way to deal with it.</p>
