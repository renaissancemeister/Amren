<h1><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-06-29-hispanics_N.htm">Births Fueling Hispanic Growth</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Haya El Nasser, USA Today, July 3, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Births, not immigration, now account for most of the growth in the nation&rsquo;s Hispanic population, a distinct reversal of trends of the past 30 years.</p>
<p>The Hispanic baby boom is transforming the demographics of small-town America in a dramatic way. Some rural counties where the population had been shrinking and aging are growing because of Hispanic immigration and births and now must provide services for the young.</p>
<p>&#8220;In all of the uproar over immigration, this is getting missed,&#8221; says Kenneth Johnson, demographer at the University of New Hampshire&rsquo;s Carsey Institute. &#8220;All the focus is on immigration, immigration, immigration. At some point, it&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s natural increase.&#8221;</p>
<p>This natural increase &mdash; more births than deaths &mdash; is accelerating among Hispanics in the USA because they are younger than the U.S. population as a whole. Their median age is 27.4, compared with 37.9 overall, 40.8 for whites, 35.4 for Asians and 31.1 for blacks.</p>
<p>Because they are younger and likely to have more children, Hispanics are having an impact that far outlasts their initial entry into the country.</p>
<p>From 2000 to 2007, the Hispanic population grew by 10.2 million &mdash; 58.6% from natural increase. The total U.S. population grew 20.2 million, about 60% from natural increase, in that period. About 6.8 million Hispanics were born and 812,000 died, according to Johnson&rsquo;s research of data from the National Center for Health Statistics.</p>
<p>In some established immigrant gateways such as Los Angeles and Chicago, all the Hispanic growth comes from natural increase, according to Johnson&rsquo;s analysis.</p>
<p>The impact on rural America is seen in areas such as Bureau and Putnam counties, Ill., where dentist Ernesto Villalobos treats a growing Hispanic population. Since the counties&rsquo; health department dental clinic in the rural part of north-central Illinois hired the Spanish-speaking Villalobos about three years ago, the number of patients has grown from 3,000 to 8,000.</p>

			<p>You see a lot of these articles about Europe too in France and Britain but with regard to the Muslims. </p>
<p>The message seems to be just give up whitey, your country is so flooded that cutting off the flow won&rsquo;t make a difference so don&rsquo;t even bother trying at this point. </p>

Latinas have yet to discover birth control. Or more accurately, their men do not allow them to use any. Latino masculinity is strongly linked to potency.</p>
<p>It may take a few generations before Latinas have &#8216;liberated&rsquo; themselves from pregnancy as many western women have done.</p>

			<p>Imagine living in a city where millions upon millions of high school mexican and black dropouts, 1/2 the student body dropping out of high school in any given year, roam the streets with nothing to do and nowhere to go except crime and making more babies. Yeah.. it&rsquo;s happening right here.</p>

			<p>We are defeated politically and demographically.  Whatever happens, continue to have White children and to teach them to be literate, to be useful, and to respect their own People.  The fact remains, unless warfare is conducted with sticks, one intelligent, self-disciplined White is more than equal to a half dozen typical Blacks, or four Mexicans.  Two such Whites can defeat twenty adversaries.  The French, for example, have sent mere companies of Foreign Legionaires into African hellholes, confident that they would emerge intact.  Or when the U.S. lost 18 soldiers in Somalia, it is estimated that over a thousand Africans paid for it in blood.  If necessary, America can continue to exist as a White military aristocracy, until the day when we drive the foreigners and their allies out.  </p>

			<p>They, and blacks are encouraged by the ignorant left, who make them wards of the state and reward them with perks, supported by the self hating liberal voters who steal from the working class, and flush our country down the toilet. Keep on working millions on welfare depend on you. </p>

			<p>Just out of interest, the hispanic population growth rate in the USA, which hovers around 3% per annum, is in fact close to the theoretical maximum that any human ethny can achieve (sufficient to double numbers in around 20-25 years).<br>
  This, of course, implies an hispanic plurality in the USA this century.<br>
  Also, during the period of the Republic&rsquo;s great expansion in the 19th century (when the population went from 6 million to 80 millions), most of the population growth was, in fact, organic and not due to European immigration - and the growth rate then was around 3% - the same heroic rate the hispanics are achieving now.<br>
  Just some food for thought.<br>

			<p>Hispanic births are fueling small towns&rsquo; growth in America. WHILE AMERICAN TAXPAYERS ARE FUNDING HISPANIC BIRTHS! (Not to mention SUBDIZING the Hispanics forever after.)</p>
<p>Now what do you not understand about why we hate and despise the flood of illegal Hispanic immigrants?</p>

			<p>Interesting comments here.  I&rsquo;m one of the people who&rsquo;s been seeing a gradually increasing number of my own White neighbors, friends, even extended family members emigrating out of the USA, mostly from states like California and Arizona but also from the Midwest.  Then settling in heartland European countries  &mdash;   chiefly Germany, Italy and Finland/Norway/Denmark, it seems  &mdash;   to raise their kids, in counries where the population is still heavily White (97+%) and most of us (especially for Germany and Austria) have blood ties going back centuries.  Among, by now, almost a dozen old friends who&rsquo;ve done this, not one is regretting the choice.  The only hassle is learning the language, from what people tell me, and something like German or Danish especially is very easy to pick up.</p>
<p>We have to be careful about equating the demographic crises faced by different Western countries.  Even without any more illegal immigration, the legal immigration numbers  &mdash;   combined with natural population growth  &mdash;   will make the USA a majority non-White nation by no later than 2020.  Just try substitute teaching in a few schools around the country, as an odd job here and there, look at the demographic mix  &mdash;   and you&rsquo;ll see exactly what I mean.  Now combine this with the fact that (1) oil is peaking and oil prices are rising like crazy and (2) the USA is now a net importer of food with scarce water resources esp. in the Southwest, and you can see that in a majority non-White USA, things are going to get very, very ugly.  Same goes for Australia and Canada, if anything on an even faster such trajectory than the USA (though starting from a smaller base).</p>
<p>Europe is a mixed bag, and I&rsquo;ll agree that PC-ridden countries like Britain and Sweden are indeed screwed as bad as North America demographically  &mdash;   but the &#8220;Alpine-Carpathian&#8221; corridor really is heavily, heavily White and Western in culture and demographics, and will survive.  Yes, I know people bring up the issue of the Turks a lot, but in fact the proportion of Turks in countries like Germany, Austria or Denmark is *vastly* smaller than the fast-growing non-White populations of the USA, Australia and Canada.  Turks don&rsquo;t have citizenship and they&rsquo;re being facilitated back home aside from the very small proportion (roughly 1-2 million) who actually can hack it there  &mdash;   and an extraordinary number of those who can, are in fact White themselves.  Remember, a big percentage of people in Turkey are White Christians descended from the Greeks, Balkans and Germanic peoples who were overtaken in the 15th century Central Asian invasions  &mdash;   and these people have a much higher retention rate among the Turks who remain in a country like Germany, in part due to closer cultural/demographic affinity and accomplishment there.  This is why so many of the 2 million long-term resident &#8220;Turks&#8221; in Germany (out of a population of well larger than 80 million) basically look like Finns or Swedes.  </p>
<p>IOW, especially as oil prices continue to shoot up and population sustainability stares us in the face, North America and Australia are headed for unmitigated disaster and a White minority, while at least a portion of Europe (Central Europe in particular) will survive as a heartland of the West.  Since so many of us have ancestry there anyway, especially in places like Germany/Austria and Denmark, seems like an opportunity for us.  And if anything, the lower birth rates in a place like Germany may be an opportunity for us  &mdash;   it just opens up room for 7-8 million of us among the White ethnic Germanic/Celtic/Slavic diaspora to help fill the gap in the coming years to maintain a sustainable population, and benefit in the process.  I haven&rsquo;t decided yet where I want to raise my own kids, but as USA immigration policy continues the insanity of importing 1.2 million high birth-rate people every year when we&rsquo;ve already surpassed 300 million *even as we&rsquo;ve become a net importer of food and highly-priced oil*, I can see the handwriting on the wall.  (Same for places like Canada, Australia, Sweden and the UK, with the same dumb policies.)  The only tiny price is learning a language like German or Danish, with German especially a remarkable language of big accomplishment anyway.  With each new day, then, I&rsquo;m starting to align more and more with my friends who&rsquo;ve made this move.</p>

			<p>I worked in the American public school system for a few years as  the &#8220;receptionist&#8221; which meant I did a lot of the paperwork. We enrolled many Hispanic students who came from families of 6, 10 or even more siblings. They all lived in section 8 housing, and every single one of them got free breakfast, lunch, free after-school programs (read day care) and other perks. We also could not ask them about their immigration status or compel them to have up-to-date immunizations. (Theoretically no child can attend public school without immunizations, but that&rsquo;s THEORETICALLY&hellip;) </p>

			<p>This is it  &mdash;  this is the center of the demographic disaster.  What I&rsquo;ve noticed is that although there&rsquo;s still plenty of white people where I live, a huge number of the young people are hispanic.  <br>
The older whites aren&rsquo;t reproducing; the young hispanics are.  That&rsquo;s what will cause the complete breakdown of our system.  </p>

			<p>Agree with Fed up.  The first act of illegal girls/women is to give birth and receive birthright citizenship from USA; then they proceed to collect Title 8, foodstamps, medicaid, and preferential EEOC opportunities, etc.   How can the feds continue to debase USA for illegals??    Oh I think I know.<br>
All governments now base votes and federal funding on census. Everyone is racing to increase populations for the $$ and votes for more funding.  The sad part of all this is they are not Americans and have no intentions of assimilating.  They are here to make history!  They tell me they are changing America while our taxpayer funded government betrays its own laws and its citizens.   V</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve seen some of the things that people write about on AmRen, but I&rsquo;ve never known anyone who&rsquo;s actually left the US to live abroad. I think most of those stories are probably anecdotal at best.  </p>

			<p>I personally take the mexicans over the blacks any day. Most all work hard and improve the neighborhoods they move into. Just the opposite for blacks. They are given every opportunity to get ahead and many still can&rsquo;t excell in anything that isn&rsquo;t crime related.</p>

<p>We can exist as a military aristocracy as long as we have the money to.  Without an income base, we would have to be willing to return to the warlord style of plundering.  The world where this takes place in would have become a pretty awful place.</p>

			<p>I just returned from the market and it was filled with young Latino women. Each had two or three kids running around and about to give birth to another. A poster above is correct. It seems linked to the &#8220;macho&#8221; male. I&#8221;ve also noticed that many Hispanic males are short and slender. They wear boots (w/heels), huge belt buckles,and ten-gallon hats. I think this has something to do with image. Must make &#8216;em feel good to wear these symbols of masculinity - makes up for the short stature.<br>
I&rsquo;m also wondering where the ones &#8220;in the shadows&#8221; are. That that silliest excuse yet. They are everywhere. If the politicians ever came out of their ivory towers and looked around, they&rsquo;d learn a few things.<br>

			<p>And if this isn&rsquo;t bad enough, we have a treasonist &#8220;president&#8221;, Jorge Bush, who insists on allowing more in.  Already we are being discriminated if we only know English.  I know, it happened to me.  The Girl Scouts of America needed someone for their Tucson mailroom.  I have 5 years of professional experience.  Their ad said &#8220;Bi-lingual encourage to apply&#8221;.  This means: English speakers need not apply.  They claimed &#8216;I wasn&rsquo;t qualified&rsquo;.</p>

			<p>One thing that I&rsquo;ve come to learn, being a native Californian, is that it&rsquo;s very possible to be poor and live among other Whites, but it&rsquo;s absolutely IMPOSSIBLE to be poor and live among poor non-whites! That makes &#8220;being poor&#8221; ten times worse than it normally would be. They&rsquo;ve really done a number on us, but it&rsquo;s the transnational corporations and international banks that have pushed borderless monopoly capitalism.</p>

			<p>Whites are starting to concentrate in whiter areas of the country.  I personally know of several people who moved to Montana in the last couple of years.  There&rsquo;s no way I would stay in Los Angeles if I were a working class white.  Boise or Portland would be much better.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I can see the handwriting on the wall. (Same for places like Canada, Australia, Sweden and the UK, with the same dumb policies.)&#8221;  Grodin</p>
<p>    I can too. Best of luck to you Grodin. If I was twenty years younger I would take your advice to heart, but my roots are too deep in my native land. An old tree will not flourish in transplanted soil. I agree that Central and Eastern Europe remain the only real hope for Western/European/White culture. We can delay the Latin Americanization here in the United States, but we cannot escape it. </p>

			<p>Things MAY not be as bad as it seems.</p>
<p>The ironic thing is, Mexican women in Mexico now average 2.1 children, the same as the U.S. on average, whereas only twenty years ago they were about four or five (hence, why most young Mexican ADULTS you meet have multiple siblings). Puerto Ricans are now down to 1.7 and according to CDC data, appear to be slumping further, while non-Hispanic White Americans are between 1.8 and 1.9. Cuba is even further along, at about 1.4.</p>
<p>Perhaps a baby bust among Mexicans will save us. It&rsquo;s progressing&hellip; give it time. With any luck, they&rsquo;ll be down to 1.2 in a decade or two like their cultural homeland Spain. Meanwhile, the white American birth rate will rise back above 2.1 as it appears to have been doing since 1975, when it was down to 1.5 or so. Thank the white liberals for removing themselves from the gene pool and allowing white conservatives to breed the next generation of white Americans.</p>
<p>In addition, if the number of Mexicans is understated by the Census Bureau as many believe, the Mexican birthrate here in the U.S. would actually be lower than the 2.9 currently recorded. Yes, you read that right. The hospitals count the anchor babies and generally get a good reckoning (after all, it&rsquo;s free for the Mexicans), so if there are more Mexicans than the Bureau believes, the birth RATE is smaller because the same number of babies is attributed to a larger number of Mexicans than thought.</p>
<p>Keep fingers crossed!</p>

			<p>I agree with Joe completely. It is indeed possible to live with low income Whites. I lived in small White rural California town for 16 yrs and had no thefts or problems. I moved to a low income Hispanic town and had 6 thefts in 1 year, graffiti on my car, inside my apartment and on my door, gang fights outside my window and shots fired in my complex. </p>

			<p>Births, not immigration, now account for most of the growth in the nation&rsquo;s Hispanic population, a distinct reversal of trends of the past 30 years.</p>
<p>Of course, that would follow wouldn&rsquo;t it. It means illegal immigration is slowing because they are all HERE! now they can begin building their families. But I still would rather have Mexicans here than blacks and Muslims.</p>

			<p>That&rsquo;s all you see now is pregnant Hispanic mothers, mostly Mexicans, with two or three other kids in tow.They start having kids at very young ages, some at even 15 or 16. It&rsquo;s sickening.They need to be introduced to birth controlor something or else we will be doomed.</p>

			<p>We ARE doomed. At this point, I think Whites need to concentrate on damage control and deciding which kind of Latin American country we are going to be. Argentina, Chile or Costa Rica on one hand or Guatemala, El Salvador, Mexico, Colombia or Peru on the other?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve gone from the US of America to the US of the Americas. Most nations in this continent are Latin American countries characterized by mestizaje - the marriage of the Whites and the Amerindian natives. So it will be for the US. We thought we could avoid this but I guess not. Maybe it was inevitable.</p>
<p>The first thing we can do is to get rid of all these darned illegals. Then we need to focus on reducing Hispanic legal immigration. I think that family reunification immigration is madness. We also need to decolonize and get RID or our colonies in Puerto Rico and Samoa. And we need to make a very serious effort to reduce legal immigration from the current 1.2 million. And also focus on getting rid of H-1B and H-2B guest worker madness. We also need to figure out somehow if we can save Western civilization in the US without a White majority - tough one.</p>
<p>All of these things are theoretically doable.</p>
<p>Saving White America is not. We&rsquo;re just buying time with that.</p>

			<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;I personally take the mexicans over the blacks any day.</p>
<p>Glad to hear that. Now come and get MY Mexican neighbors. Here in Houston, Mexicans pretty well lead in the crime reports. Afte all, outnumbering Blacks here by about 3-to-1. As to the sexual predators, rapists, child molesters. You guessed it! Mexicans &#8216;win&rsquo; again. Try our 10 MOST WANTED list on Crimestoppers. Seven out of ten are Mexican, two are Blacks, one a lonely White.</p>
<p>Do you enjoy the stench of human urine. Dirty diapers tossed in YOUR flower bed by Mexican neighbors? If so, you&rsquo;ll absolutely LOVE ours. Yeah, some are hard workers. Won&rsquo;t deny that. But most also work equally hard at thievery, burglary, shoplifting   &mdash;   small crimes. Ask some of our local store and business managers about that one. They call it &#8220;shrinkage&#8221; or &#8220;pilferage.&#8221;</p>
<p>As to the Mexicans featured in nightly crime reports, I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s just a coincidence that most of them probably are illegals in addition to common criminals.</p>
<p>Sure wish I could look at Mexicans thru your rose-colored glasses. But I&rsquo;ve had my eyes opened long ago. Living with Houston&rsquo;s large [illegal] Mexican immigrant population. Seeing the pictures of perps in the newscasts and in the papers. Hearing stories from law enforcement friends. Even from co-worker victims. Nor are our friendly Mexicans above rape, child molestation, pedophilia   &mdash;   ALL RECENTLY FEATURED on local Crimestopper newscasts. Hey don&rsquo;t just take MY word for it&hellip; look up the CRIMESTOPPER websites for Houston, San Antonio, other large American cities with an abundant Mexican population. See the ugly truth for yourself.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve been in the Ukraine for the past month with my girlfriend&rsquo;s family, and I see hope here in Eastern Europe.  Although the country is quite poor, there is a sense of community and people seem to be happy(oh how I miss the advantages of a homogenous society).  After seening how united Ukrainians and Russians are, compared to the aparthied in the US and my home of Canada continue to decay, I&rsquo;ve decided to learn Russian.  Besides, despite a masters degree from a top school and good experience, I&rsquo;m unemployed and I can&rsquo;t get any interviews (because I check the &#8220;non-minority box&#8221; I think)<br>
I&rsquo;ve been really depressed thinking about how the US is destroying itself for nothing, and am acutally hoping for some kind of civil war. I&rsquo;m happy I came here because it gave me a little hope. </p>

			<p>One possible explanation for so many pregnant Mexican females being the reality Uncle Sugar (a.k.a., THE AMERICAN TAXPAYERS) get stuck with the hospital and doctor bills for the pregnancy and birth, plus probably life-long welfare supplement checks in the bargain.</p>
<p>How plainly can I say it&hellip; THIS IS WHY WE ARE AGAINST THE HISPANICS IN OUR COUNTRY. We&rsquo;re simply fed up with the costs they represent to us taxpayers. Without even mentioning the crime angle or the other social problems. But when did Lying George look at that $90 BILLION we taxpayers have to shoulder, so the business and corporate entities can have access to THEIR cheap labor?</p>
