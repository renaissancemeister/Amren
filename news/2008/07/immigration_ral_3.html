						<p>Immigration reform advocates and religious leaders hope hundreds of people will descend on a small Iowa town this month for a rally in support of workers arrested in a large raid at a meatpacking plant.</p>
<p>Organizers are using the raid at the Agriprocessors Inc. kosher meatpacking plant in Postville on May 12 as an example of what&rsquo;s wrong with the nation&rsquo;s immigration laws. Federal officials have called it the largest single immigration raid in the nation&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>The rally in Postville, population 2,200, is scheduled for July 27 and was organized by Jewish and Catholic groups from Iowa, Illinois and Minnesota.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Most of the 389 workers arrested were charged with using false identification or incorrect Social Security numbers. Two plant supervisors were later charged with aiding and abetting the possession and use of fraudulent identification.</p>
<p>Authorities said some undocumented workers who were sole caregivers for children were allowed to return home with ankle bracelets that monitor their movement. However, immigrant reform advocates claimed those parents aren&rsquo;t able to find work and must rely on handouts.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The groups planning the immigration reform rally this month in Postville are St. Bridget&rsquo;s Catholic Church in Postville, Jewish Community Action of St. Paul, Minn., and the Jewish Council on Urban Affairs of Chicago. They promised testimony from people directly affected by the raid, as well as talk about immigration reform and workers&rsquo; rights.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a call for justice. This is a call to be faithful to our American and religious values,&#8221; Sister Mary McCauley with St. Bridget&rsquo;s Catholic Church said in a statement. &#8220;This is a call to stand in solidarity with our Hispanic brothers and sisters.&#8221;</p>
<p>Organizers are worried that the rally could draw too many supporters and are asking that anyone planning to attend register with their groups.</p>

			<p>The simple solution for citizens who care at all about the interference of these theocrats in the affairs of the citizenry, is to not support them. They know that what they are doing is immoral,even in the doctrines of their various religions.  </p>

<p>As the other rallies have done, this one could create a backlash that will bring more pressure to bear on the illegals.</p>
<p>Just making the populace aware of the illegal situation is enough to raise tempers against the situation and the illegals themselves.</p>
<p>Why csn&rsquo;t the dunces see this?  Because all of them look at themselves as victims of some sort, completely oblivious to their offensive attitudes and actions.</p>

			<p>What kind of idiot turns up to show support for a business that has blatantly violated multiple laws? Not only did the immigration raid show they were massively violating immigration laws, in the past Agriprocessors has also been fined $600,000 for discharging untreated sewage in violation of waste management laws. In 2005 PETA caught them using inhumane practices. </p>

<p>No one will show.</p>

			<p>  People in Postvill have a powerful friend who is attempting to call the White House home.   Barack Obama spoke to the National Council of La Raza and in one sentence managed to do what most Hot Air readers would consider the impossible  &mdash;  he put distance between himself and John McCain on immigration. Calling the ICE terrorists, Obama made his position on border security and immigration enforcement plain. He thinks they&rsquo;re fascist!<br>
How dare these fascists attempt to enforce American law!!!</p>
<p>Maybe the bleeding hearts in Postville can get Obama to attend their rally.</p>

			<p>The most telling line in the story: &#8220;The groups planning the immigration reform rally this month in Postville are St. Bridget&rsquo;s Catholic Church in Postville, Jewish Community Action of St. Paul, Minn., and the Jewish Council on Urban Affairs of Chicago.&#8221; That&rsquo;s the entire story, in fact, day in and day out. The production moves from town to town but the cast of players is always the same.  Shouldn&rsquo;t this sort of behavior be enough to strip those gropups of their non-profit (* cough) tax status?</p>

			<p>A makes-you-want-to-throw-the-towel-in moment! Just heard a news item on TV. The World Court just halted the sentences of 5 Mexicans on death row here in Texas to &#8220;review&#8221; the cases. It sure gets difficult to keep up the fight with so many pro-illegals muddying the waters.</p>

			<p>Years ago I never heard of a meat &#8220;recall&#8221; where thousands of<br>
pounds of meat products were destroyed due to some type of<br>
contamination. I&rsquo;m of the opinion the large number of substandard<br>
workers &gt;read illegals
Time to &#8220;clean up&#8221; at the source of this problem and let Americans go back to work at livable wages.</p>

			<p>It certainly takes some pretty dedicated Leftists to show up to support workers for a big meatpacking plant   &mdash;   typically one of the most tempting targets for pro-animal welfare, PETA-enrolled, anti-corporate types.  A more understandable response would have been outrage at the plant for exploiting Hispanic workers, yet the tone of the protest seems to be that they should be let back on the job with no questions asked!  Quite incredible.</p>
<p>When it comes to Hispanics, even the Left&rsquo;s hard-won labor and animal welfare laws get thrown under the bus, it seems, in deference to the all-encompassing goal of demographic transformation.</p>

			<p>It is amazing how the Reconquista has shaken up race relations.  </p>
<p>I grew up thinking of Catholics and Jews as being just like regular Americans.  </p>
<p>But in recent years, I have started to rethink a great deal.  </p>
<p>It is going to be everyone for themselves pretty soon. </p>
<p>Just like it was 100 years ago when the last batch was overrunning the USA and turning our cities into cesspits.</p>

<p>Yeah, the &#8220;World Court&#8221; gave the order, but Perry told them to stuff it. When King George was the governor of Texas he presided over a record number of executions, including the first execution of a woman since the War for Southern Secession. Now he wants to ORDER Texas to abide by a World Court ruling because it involves Mexican nationals? No, no agenda here folks&hellip;move along..move along..<br>
