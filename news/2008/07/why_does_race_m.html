<h1>Why Does Race Matter for Women?</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Razib, Science Blogs, July 20, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>One social science finding which I&rsquo;ve wondered about over the past few years is the result that women care much more about the race of a potential mate than men do. The fact that individuals tend to want to mate assortatively with those who share their characteristics is no surprise. Rather, what does surprise are a series of papers that show a very strong asymmetry in strength of preference between males and females. To be crass about it, an attractive warm body will do for a man, but women strongly prefer a body with the packaging of their own race!</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s keep this in perspective, here are the correlations from the GSS for married individuals for several variables of note (I&rsquo;ve filtered for whites here):</p>
<p>Ethnicity &mdash; 0.40<br>
Highest Degree &mdash; 0.55<br>
Socioeconomic index &mdash; 0.32</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s interesting to note that the variable which reveals meritocratic achievement has the highest correlation. {snip}</p>
<p>This post is going to review some findings in a paper which attempts to both describe the differences in race preference for dating by race and across genders, and, why those differences might emerge the way that they do. The paper is Racial Preferences in Dating, Review of Economic Studies. Here&rsquo;s the abstract:</p>
<p>&#8220;We examine racial preferences in dating. We employ a Speed Dating experiment that allows us to directly observe individual decisions and thus infer whose preferences lead to racial segregation in romantic relationships. Females exhibit stronger racial preferences than males. The richness of our data further allows us to identify many determinants of same-race preferences. Subjects&rsquo; backgrounds, including the racial composition of the ZIP code where a subject grew up and the prevailing racial attitudes in a subject&rsquo;s state or country of origin, strongly influence same-race preferences. Older subjects and more physically attractive subjects exhibit weaker same-race preferences.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As you can see the demographics are unsurprising for an elite university. Do note that South Asians were discarded from the Asian category so that Asian within this study refers only to East Asians. The researchers collected a fair amount of data prior to sending them through the Speed Dating experiment. These and the GSS were used to generate independent variables that could be used to predict the extent to which race might matter. In the end, race didn&rsquo;t matter that much, just to a statistically significant extent. The authors note that 47% of matches were interracial, while random expectations would have predicted 53%. Random mating in the general population would result in 44% of marriages being interracial, while only 4% are. It is obvious though that demographic segregation will shift away from a panmictic dynamic, and, I think marriage is frankly a higher bar than accepting the proposal for a date.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the chart that shows you who wanted who:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Just inspecting the table, it&rsquo;s pretty obvious what&rsquo;s going on here. Some general observations:</p>
<p>1) Black women at Columbia are really open to dating black men. Take a look at the sex ratios there.</p>
<p>2) Asian dudes are really screwed. Not only are non-Asian women not impressed, but Asian women aren&rsquo;t reciprocally racially discriminatory to level the playing field.</p>
<p>3) Women care a lot more about race than men. Though there is some variation in the male acceptances by race, but as I said most of the differences were not statistically significant. To make this concrete, black women were three times as likely to say yes to a black man as they were to an Asian man (though white women were the most repulsed by Asian men clearly).</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll let the paper talk here:<br>
<blockquote>We first look at the decisions of female subjects. For all races except Asians, all the coefficients on the race indicator variables are negative, implying a same-race preference. For black and white subjects, these coefficients are jointly significant (p-value &lt; 0·01); for Hispanics, the joint significance is at the 10% level, with most of the effect derived from a significant (p &lt;0·05) preference against Asian males. For Asian subjects, no coefficient is individually significant, nor are they jointly so. Finally, we can reject the hypothesis of equal preference against partners of other races for white, black, and Hispanic subjects, owing largely to the greater preference against Asian males by all other races.</p>
<p>For male subjects, the coefficients on racial preferences are predominantly negative but are not jointly significant at 5% for any race. For white and black subjects, when females and males are pooled and gender-race interactions included we find that the male race coefficients are significantly closer to zero than the female race coefficients. In analogous regressions for Asian average, women exhibit stronger racial preferences than men. Note that, since our specification includes subject fixed effects, this difference cannot be due to differential selectivity.</p>
<p>One possible reason for this gender difference might be the different dating goals of men and women. In particular, one might be concerned that women are more interested in forming a relationship while men are more interested in casual sex and that race has greater relevance for the former endeavour. However, in Section 3.3, we demonstrate that older subjects (who, based on their self-reported dating goals, are more interested in forming a relationship) exhibit substantially weaker same-race preferences. Thus, the observed difference seems to reflect a genuine disparity in men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s willingness to be with a partner of a different race, rather than differing goals.</blockquote></p>
<p>First, Asian guys are screwed, obviously. I mean, look at how strongly Latinas have an aversion to Asian guys! Secondly, I don&rsquo;t actually buy their dismissal of different goals. I&rsquo;ll get into that later.</p>
<p>{snip} Here&rsquo;s the above table controlled for attractiveness:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Since you can read the whole working paper I&rsquo;ll restate in plain language what they find re: determinants. If you want the exact betas just download the PDF.</p>
<p>Here are variables which predict same race preference:</p>
<p>* High proportion wish ban on interracial marriage in a region</p>
<p>* Areas where people would not want to be neighbors with another race</p>
<p>* Areas where there are large populations of other races</p>
<p>Here are variables which predict less same race preference:</p>
<p>* Older</p>
<p>* Attractiveness, 1 standard deviation increase in attractiveness results in a 4 point decrease in same-race preference</p>
<p>Variables which had no effect:</p>
<p>* Shared interests</p>
<p>* Cultural variables (books read, etc.)</p>
<p>* Income</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>First, this is a sample of Columbia University graduate students! Caveat. But note that they didn&rsquo;t really extend their findings much with speculation. My main issue with the paper is this: I still suspect it&rsquo;s not taking into account different intent on the part of males and females. I don&rsquo;t think the analogy to older students is appropriate. Their logic is simple, if one assumes that older students are looking for serious relationships and are less race conscious, if women were looking for serious relationships then they too would be less race conscious, not more. I think that this isn&rsquo;t controlling for all life variables. I believe that as people age they become more realistic (or, if not, they stay single!). Someone who is young and wants a serious relationship might have an ideal type in mind who they are holding out for. Someone who is older and wants a serious relationship might realize that eliminating people on the basis of their racial type probably is constraining the field of play unnecessarily.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I will add one more thing, though I&rsquo;m hesitant. As a man of color I feel less than empowered when criticized by heteronormatively privileged white males on this point on the comment boards as they can silence my voice with their command of the English language which has long been the tool of the master, but could it be the white male patriarchy? Perhaps women, long oppressed by males have internalized the racism which is implicit in the current dispensation. One might wager that women perceive that the choices they make are fraught with far greater long term import than those men make, and so they stick with what they see as the &#8220;safest&#8221; option in the white male heteronormative patriarchy? Those who might be able to protect them? For white women it would be the white men who control the levers of power, and for women of color it would be the men who have been oppressed by the phallocracy and have been their allies of necessity against oppression.</p>

<p>Get out the &#8220;straight&#8221; jacket. This black &#8220;researcher&#8221; sounds like he might be a mentally ill transvestite &#8220;trapped in a man&rsquo;s body.&#8221;<br>
Only gays and feminists talk about &#8220;heteronormative class structure&#8221; and &#8220;male partiarchy,&#8221; respectively.  </p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t know if this information is correct or not.  I find more white women involved in interracial relationships than white men in Western PA.  I see more black men with white women, than white men with black women.  Of middle class white men that I know, about 99% have married white spouses.  It seems there are a number of single white women with biracial children.    <br>
For the most part it seems Italians, Greeks, and Eastern Europeans in this area frown upon interracial relationships the most.  </p>

As a man of color I feel less than empowered when criticized by heteronormatively privileged white males on this point on the comment boards as they can silence my voice with their command of the English language which has long been the tool of the master, but could it be the white male patriarchy? Perhaps women, long oppressed by males have internalized the racism which is implicit in the current dispensation. One might wager that women perceive that the choices they make are fraught with far greater long term import than those men make, and so they stick with what they see as the &#8216;safest&rsquo; option in the white male heteronormative patriarchy?

<p>Well, take that whitey!</p>
<p>For a &#8220;man of color&#8221; who likes to put things into &#8220;plain language,&#8221; this Razib fool certainly lavishes us with a rather windy and wordy tirade of Marxist oriented explanations as to why a white woman would prefer a white man over a male &#8220;of color.&#8221; It also oozes with the typical jealousy and rationalizations of nonwhite males, who want to explain away their own lacking desirability with all but the lowest and most vile of white women; it cannot be that decent white women are responding normally and are biologically driven to procreate with those who are like themselves in appearance and behavior, but must instead be because of their &#8220;internalized racism.&#8221; It cannot be that they would rather have children that resembles them equally with their partner in all variables, but has to be because they wish to &#8220;transfer&#8221; their &#8220;protected&#8221; and &#8220;privileged&#8221; cast status to those children. Moreover, the feckless wretch &#8220;of color&#8221; wishes to broadside all possible criticism by oddly condemning white men for their superior &#8220;command of the English language,&#8221; as being the &#8220;tool of the master&#8221; and thus somehow unfair and oppressive toward him and all males &#8220;of color.&#8221; </p>
<p>Indeed, it is unfair and oppressive to point out that &#8220;phallocracy&#8221; is a borderline neologism, that reflects on an obsessively disturbed thought process that wishes to hold that white women just have to have some nefarious reason for marring white men, when there are so many obviously &#8220;preferable&#8221; males &#8220;of color&#8221; to be used and abused by, just like him. Given his highly &#8220;intellectualized&#8221; dialectical take on dating and marriage, one would assume that this is a highly &#8220;stimulating&#8221; individual that no white woman could pass up, based on &#8220;non-racist&#8221; romantic considerations. </p>
<p>Of course, those who do reject what I am sure are his very suave and debonair propositions, are simply doing so because they are just calculating and greedy dupes of the white man&rsquo;s &#8220;oppression&#8221; and the rewards that it brings.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

			<p>   This study is from the University where the institute which promotes political correctness is located.<br>
   It is likely that it has a very high saturation of pro-pc students and faculty and the results should support this.<br>
   It is therefore unlikely that other schools which oppose pc would show similar numbers of interracial couples and note above that areas with large populations of other races are LESS likely to have interracial couples according to this research from Columbia University.</p>

			<p>If I understand this right it&rsquo;s Women are more concerned with long term prospects, and hence this is why or why not they are open to dating interracially? Boy does this guy got things backward about why women &#8216;date interracially&rsquo;. </p>

			<p>Men who will very vocally claim to despise liberals are as likely as liberals to be in interracial relationships while the women in interracial relationships are usually either self-hating liberal white women or golddigging Asian women playing white men for fools.</p>
<p>The liberal white women increase their odds of dying young from the increased risks of AIDS from black men and other stuff that black men do, and the Asian golddiggers leave their white sucker husbands as soon as they break them.  I have been living in northern California, and over and over I have seen Asian women with Asian second husbands after their white first husbands got them into the country.  Plus they and their second husbands got the white husbands&rsquo; money.    </p>

			<p>Regarding the final conclusion, I think White women prefer White men because we make better mates on every level. We are more attractive, work harder, earn more, give more respect, and stick around to raise children. Hell, we even enjoy it! Plus, there is the level of trust that one doesn&rsquo;t have with a stranger. Any other explanation is university-speak baloney.</p>

			<p>I was speaking with a friend about this earlier this tear. This should hardly be surprising. </p>
<p>Women have always been more racially conscious then men when it comes to dating. </p>
<p>For example, how many White women do you se with Asian males or Latino males for that matter? Interestingly, you see more White women with Black men than any other minority.</p>
<p>This is a subject worth discussing.</p>

			<p>I grew up in an integrated small-town many years ago but never even considered dating anyone but white males. Dating is serious business for it brings with it moral and genetic responsibility for any future children. </p>
<p>It never ceases to amaze me when women act surprised that their new boyfriends harm or kill their children (by another man). A majority of these horrific situations seem to result when the woman entrusts her new &#8220;boyfriend&#8221; (often non-white)to babysit her older offspring without realizing he probably has no moral compass, no genetic interest in the child, and no self-control to prevent him from harming what he views as just a nuisance.</p>

			<p>White women are often called race traitors, perhaps because of media images of black athletes and celebrities, who grab up beautiful white trophy wives. Or the opposite image of a dumpy white frump, who winds up with a black man. In reality, most White women prefer their own, and are most likely to be with their own. Black men, wil often call it a lie, and insist, white women everywhere are flocking to them. Most are fantasizing, and are instead string along an assortment of black baby mamas.</p>

			<p>As a white woman, I would never even entertain the thought of a black man.  I like white men but they haven&rsquo;t been too gentlemanly lately (like 3-4 decades).  Chivalry is a social order established by white men and they need to return to it.</p>
<p>If I absolutely had to, I&rsquo;d take an Asian man over a black man any day, even a squat old one with short legs.<br>

<p>For instance, he says &#8220;Black women at Columbia are really open to dating black men.&#8221;  Well do they have much choice?  I don&rsquo;t think there is much chemistry between white, Asian, or Hispanic men and black women.  But he, of course, could never say that.  If he did the PC police would arrest him and throw him in the gulag. </p>

			<p>hi there AmRen!! it is me the Korean guy. </p>
<p>I did read this article.  Was I angry while I was reading this article?  </p>
<p>No,</p>
<p>I kept snickering while I was reading this article.</p>
<p>If you want just a few among the numerous reasons why I kept snickering while I was reading this article&hellip;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just inspecting the table, it&rsquo;s pretty obvious what&rsquo;s going on here. Some general observations:</p>
<p>1) <b>Black women at Columbia are really open to dating black men.</b> Take a look at the sex ratios there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ok, what is the big surprise there?  What is the groundbreaking discovery he made there?  Black women at any college in USA and Canada are really open to dating black men.  Woah, I never, ever knew black women are open to dating black men!!  Congratulations to the author for makig the groundbreaking, brilliant discovery.   </p>
<p>Possibly he was trying to indicate &#8220;Non-black women at Columbia are really open to dating black men&#8221;.  Then I guess I will assume that he meant non-black women but he made the mistake there and then keep reading this article, but he lost credibility there in this article.  He either is a very careless person or he is&hellip;  you know what. </p>
<p>&#8220;To make this concrete, black women were three times as likely to say yes to a black man as they were to an Asian man&#8221; </p>
<p>as a Korean guy I do feel very terrible that black women are three times more likely to say yes to a black man than to an Asian man.  hahahaha  I never ever knew in my life that there are more black women who prefer dating within their race than who prefer dating outside.  You made another fantastic groundbreaking discovery there.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Asian dudes are really screwed&#8221;</p>
<p>If you keep using that junior high school level English, you will not have any significant credibility by the time I reach the end of your article.</p>
<p>And it is safe to conclude that the person who wrote this article is a black male because he keeps saying positive things about black males and negative things about Asian males and this article largely focuses on and discusses black women and their preference in dating.  </p>
<p>And very likely he used a data from a written survey or a verbal survey asking random non-black female students at Columbia.  They might have said that they are open to dating black men, but how many of them actually date black men?  If I were a white woman, and a non-White non-East Asian male asks me &#8220;are you willing to date outside the race?&#8221; then I would automatically say yes and let him go just so I can save myself some trouble later on.</p>
<p>This PDF file <a href="/emir-kamenica/documents/racialPreferences.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://faculty.chicagogsb.edu/emir.kamenica/documents/racialPreferences.pdf</a> was not written by the same person who wrote the above article &#8220;Why does race matter for women?&#8221;.  The PDF file was written by four business graduate students from Stanford, Columbia and U of Chicago.</p>
<p>The above article was not written by someone with recognizable education.  It was a blog entry made by just a random person on his blog.  A blog is something that everyone can have for free nowadays, such as myspace or facebook.  A blog is pretty much a  diary.  The person who wrote the PDF document and the person who wrote the above blog entry &#8220;Why does race matter for women?&#8221; are not the same person.</p>
<p>And what is the thesis or the main argument of this article?  The article indicates women in general prefer dating men of their own race yet reads &#8220;Asian dudes are screwed&#8221; What is the relationship between those two statements?  </p>
<p>The most common flaw of the essays ending up with low marks is the unclear thesis or main argument.  I heard it first hand from a professor at Ryerson University. (the school I am currently attending) If there are AmRen members currently attending college or have children currently attending collge, keep in mind or tell them that whenever you write an essay, it is crucial to have a very clear thesis.</p>
<p>But I will agree that it is a blog entry made by a random person, not an essay or a research paper written by a business graduate student.</p>
<p>I agree with the author of the blog entry in one matter:  Asian males are the least likely group to date outside the race.  I do recognize that is the truth I observe around myself in Toronto. </p>
<p>However, to all AmRen Asian brothers and Asian brothers in this world, I would like to remind you of what I also observed on top of the fact that Asian males are the least likely racial group to date outside the race:</p>
<p>If you pay attention to her and to yourself, and take very good care of her and yourself, and if you truly respect the lady and everyone around you, and if you are always fair to everyone around you, and most importantly, <b>if you always stay very careful not to force or to persuade her to like you,</b>(That rule applies for women of all races)</p>
<p>you will have absolutely no trouble winning the heart of the non-Asian lady of your dreams.  Do you want a proof?  Here I am! The Korean guy in Toronto is the proof.</p>
<p>And to the rest of AmRen, I have learned quite a lot from AmRen since the day I visited AmRen for the first time, I love readin the articles and comments.  And in my point of view, and I am very very positive, that interracial dating in North America should be one of the least of your concerns.  Interracial dating is still very very rare in North America.  Roughly 95% of black men are married to black women, and among the remaining 5%, roughly half of the remaining 5% are married to other non-white women such as South East Asian and Hispanic women.  Even the PDF document written by four business graduate school students from well-known schools in the United States proves that interracial dating is still rare in North America.  </p>
<p>And lastly, just because someone is dating within his or her race that does not make him or her a winner, and just because someone is dating outisde his or her race, that does not make him or her a winner or a loser.  There are some people who date outside the race simply because they want to have that &#8220;hey look at me, I am not a racist!&#8221; look, and I think they are the losers.  There are countless great white men and Asian men around me, and even a few fine black men around me, and overwhelming majority of them are dating within their race.  </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m not surpised&hellip;but these conclusions do fly in the face of logic. I can see the attraction of women to men of their own race, particularly white males. But Black over Asian is suprising, (i don&rsquo;t think south asians would affect the score positively) given the track record of economic and social success of asians verus whites. At an anthropological level, asian men produce more&rsquo;successful&rsquo; progeny than black men (what&rsquo;s their life expectancy etc&hellip;). Just not sucessful with the ladies i guess&hellip;</p>

			<p>Up until about a year ago it was a source of guilt, but I&rsquo;ve always been attracted almost exclusively to (pasty) white men.  The only darker skinned ones I find at all physically appealing are those who have Caucasoid facial features, and even then they must at least have straight hair, too, or light colored eyes.  Dark skin together with dark eyes and dark, curly hair invariably puts me off, even if the fellow is technically white with 100% Caucasian bone structure.</p>

			<p>  I wish this was case at my university. Many of the women are from small, mostly white towns. They haven&rsquo;t a clue about blacks or other minorities. Even worse, they receive extensive brainwashing/diversity training through the Social Work, Sociology, and English departments. At least, most everyday American white women aren&rsquo;t as stupid and foolish as they are. </p>

<p>I completely agree, I have only dated white men, but if I had to date outside my race, I would far prefer an Asian man over a Black one. Over the internet I have seen how Black men often talk in the crudest manner about why they think they are so appealing, and usually they will mention size, which always sickens me. I think what else do they have to offer? Most of them are dead-beat dads who never even marry the mother of their children. And often many of them father numerous children, with numerous women. Their base crudeness turns me off so much, I would not only happily choose an Asian man over a black man, but would happily remain single and dateless, rather than be with one.</p>

Many black females often accuse white women of throwing themselves at black men. HARDLY! I believe this is their way, of trying to account for the fact that so many black women wind up with children, but without a partner. But black males are highly aggressive with females, and it starts at a very early age.<br>
My highschool was mostly white, with maybe 10 to 12% of the students being black. And even then, the black males spent most of their time approaching the white females, or making suggestive remarks to them, when the teachers were out of earshot. This often made us feel very flustered and embarassed. Especially when the white boys would sit back and snicker at it all. I personally got grabbed from behind, while trying to sharpen my pencil once. This behavior continues into their adult life. They are simpley very aggressive in their approach to women of all races, but few of them ever have any desire to settle down or be responsible. Many just move on from one conquest to another, and if children are the byproduct of it, that doesn&rsquo;t stop them from repeating the pattern. I have no clue why any white female would want a part of this? But it almost seems as if black women have accepted this as normal behavior from their men, and are willing to have children with them, even if they are seeing other women at the same time.<br>

			<p>&#8220;As a white woman, I would never even entertain the thought of a black man. I like white men but they haven&rsquo;t been too gentlemanly lately (like 3-4 decades). Chivalry is a social order established by white men and they need to return to it.</p>
<p>If I absolutely had to, I&rsquo;d take an Asian man over a black man any day, even a squat old one with short legs.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was head of a chivalric order for seven years and was a very serious student/advocate of it (as I still am when it comes up).  What most people, men and women get wrong about chivalry is that it is all about men opening doors for women and kissing their hands.  Chivalry is a social system.  It is based on basic tribal suvival and conduct in the heroic sense.  Women are the vessels for the continuity of the people because they have wombs.  The men protect the women and children because they are the future of the tribe or clan.  Disputes are settled honorably by symbolic combats as in a duel to the first blood.  Men of the same tribe or clan do not murder or kill one another for any reason.  In the more sophisticated version developed during the Age of Reason to the Victorian era, the social contract was more complex, but the same principals applied.  Women have roles just as the men do - it is not a one sided affair with feminists consenting to slavish male behavior toward them.  Women serve the men and men serve the women in their roles.  There is room for exceptional women in the system too.  It is a better system than we have now, which is no system at all, but a quasi-marxist fantasy of unisex humanoids who all act (or overact) the same unremarkable way.  What we have is a continual stumble forward with the help of social advocates like Oprah, Dr. Phil and those trash-culture shows propelling and documenting our collective fall.</p>
<p>But it was the feminist movement that killed what was left of chivalry 30-40 years ago.  Feminism and the sexual revolution -as it was called.  People became careless of themselves and others.  Today is simply the continuance and expansion of that.</p>

			<p>Forget non-white; I couldn&rsquo;t date a man with dark skin, dark eyes and dark curly hair, even if he was technically &#8220;white&#8221; and had 100% Caucasian features.  It would just put me off too much.  He&rsquo;d have to have at least straight hair or light colored eyes if his skin was also dark.  Otherwise, friend?  Yes.  Husband?  No.</p>
<p>Does that make me some sort of a race traitor, or maybe just arrogant and superficial?  Nah.  No arguments about taste.</p>

<p>Your observations on Asian women using white men to get in the country caught my eye. My mother does daycare for a white man from Australia living in the U.S. who was married to a Phillipino woman who three years into a 15 year prison sentence for involvement in a murder-for-hire plot against him. He had two mixed children with her. Over the past year, he has been online trying to meet another Phillipino woman and has traveled hundreds of miles across North America and even overseas to meet them in person. Some people never learn.</p>

			<p>If you don&rsquo;t count South Asians, then Asian Americans are a grand total of like only 2% of the United States population. From a global viewpoint, there is absolutely no way the Asian male is &#8220;really screwed&#8221; in the defeatist sense the article is implying.</p>
<p>Women are heavily influenced by the media, and the American media negatively stereotypes Asian males more than any other racial group - to the extent where these stereotypes are starting to conflict with everyday observation.</p>
<p>This is done because, out of all the non-white races in the world, those boys from East Asia (China, Japan, and Korea) are really the only ones that can substantially rival the white man in every capacity.</p>
<p>America is not an Asian society, that much is obvious. But they are productive and don&rsquo;t race mix that much - ergo those &#8220;Asian dudes&#8221; don&rsquo;t deserve all the flack and negative portrayal they get here.</p>

			<p>This black man is just crying sour grapes because the majority of white women have no interest in dating minority men. It took a media blitz to get more white women to date minorities in recent years but still it has not been a sucessful adverstising campaign in that it has generated so few females who want to do so. If anything, this media blitz has pumped up illusions of grandeur in black males into thinking that they are entitled to white women. This article reflects the reality that this isn&rsquo;t true.</p>

			<p>The conclusion doesn&rsquo;t seem to hold for the white race.  A trip to your local mall will show virtually no white men with non-white women but a lot of white women with african men or half-african children. Thus white men are more racially aware than white women. </p>

<p>White men are not necessarily more racially aware just because you see more white women with black men than white men with black women. I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of white men with women of other races, particularly East Asians. There is a very large number of white men with Asian women and half-Asian children that I see every day.</p>
<p>Also white men are more likely to have a long term relationship, marriage, and children with an Asian woman. Many of them find Asian women particularly attractive; the race-mixing white women you see don&rsquo;t always PREFER black men; they usually date black men just to try to ignore race, seem &#8216;cool&rsquo; or anti-racist. Ignorant white women who try and get into relationships with black men usually end up realizing what a huge mistake they made, but not all of them do. Black men don&rsquo;t want commitment, marriage, and children- they just date white women casually for sex and to boss them around. It&rsquo;s obvious to anyone.</p>

			<p>To 10:22, When I am at my local mall I see plenty of white couples. Although, I do see plenty more black males standing around trying to pick up young non-black females. Many Black men refuse to believe that most white women still far prefer white men over them. And some whites have bought into it, but it is an out-right myth. Just look at the racial demograhics, when it comes to marriage. Although, blacks always argue that whites date blacks, but marry other whites. I almost think they are trying to in some way, brainwash white women into believing this is the current trend to follow.</p>

<p>10:12PM: &#8220;What gives&#8221; is that black women don&rsquo;t think of white men as <i>men</i> - more like furniture. Racial separation is not what it was, but it&rsquo;s still there, and AFAICT black women don&rsquo;t make any effort to cross it. White men don&rsquo;t perceive any receptivity there, so they don&rsquo;t try either. This is not conscious, I think. When they consciously think about it, white men accept black women in the abstract. But in practice they are put off by the sub-verbal disdain of black women without ever recognizing it.</p>

<p><br>
So in other words, if black women acted more receptive, white men would be endlessly pursuiing them? It could be argued that many white men don&rsquo;t see black women as women, since many tend to loud and aggressive. Perhaps this is due to the fact that black women have more testosterone than other females. Also, if they could have any man they are receptive to,  one might ask why 70% of them aren&rsquo;t married to men of any race? And it is not just white men or black men. When I go out, I never see a black woman paired with an Asian man, Arab man, Hispanic man, or Indian man. I would conclude that most men view them as the least desirable. Let&rsquo;s face it, the Halle Berry&rsquo;s of this world are few and far between.</p>

However, in my own personal experience, (surely I&rsquo;m not the only one) I&rsquo;ve seen an undeniable gradual increase of White women with non-White men over the years.  This is especially true with those women in their late teens and early 20&rsquo;s.  Many of whom are quite attractive I might add&hellip;    </p>

<p>Sub-verbal disdain? What does that mean? Blacks have always been more than verbal in their distain for whites. Still, this doesn&rsquo;t stop black men from approaching white women, no matter how unreceptive they might be. It is common knowledge that when white men women seek outside their race, they usually seek out Asians. The traits that Asian women are perceived as having, that appeal to some white men, are the exact opposite traits that black women are known for. Receptiveness is only a small part of the equation. Given the choice, most white men would rather have an pretty white female smiling his way, over a black female. No matter how attractive or receptive she might be.<br>

<p>Interesting analyisis there! But I can assure you that the vast majority of white men, would rather have a pretty white female smiling his way, over a black one, regardless of how receptive the black female might appear to his advances. On the other hand, I can&rsquo;t say with full confidence, that the majority of black men would be more interested in the black female over a white one.<br>

I&rsquo;m very confused over this one because it seems out of line from what I see.</p>
<p>Off hand, I can think of two white men who I have seen with black women (one of whom has a child). The other, I only saw holding hands.</p>
<p>What I see every day are white women with black men or white women with mixed-raced children. The fact that white women are having children with non-white men seems to be saying white women don&rsquo;t consider race in the long run.</p>
<p>What I believe may be happening is that the sample is skewed. The sample seems to involve persons who participate in Speed Dating. This leads me to believe that the sample is of men and women who are consciously looking for long term relationships and are far more likely to make rational choices.</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;ve met white men who go to clubs to meet any women for sex, they aren&rsquo;t looking for long term relationships with black women.</p>

			<p>Stone Greaser is correct. </p>
<p>While same race datign and marrige is probably the norm for the over 35-40 crowd, among those that ae younger, I have seen a notable number of interrcial couples, including Black women/White men couples. </p>
<p>Such unions are farmore commonplace among this group.</p>

			<p>All I can say is that I see at least twenty black-male/White-female for every one White-male/black-female couple.</p>

<p>Craigslist is nothing more than a site for hot, horny young people of all races who want to get laid and engage in perverted sex, interracial sex and gay and bisexual sex with one another.</p>
<p>From what I have seen there are many White men (those that have no racial consciuos about them) posting ads for Black and Asian women. </p>
<p>That is why I have learned to stay away from it.</p>

			<p>There is a growing number of White male/Black female couples.</p>
<p>Interestingly, these couples tend to be more professioal and upscale than the reverse.</p>

			<p>Yes, people keep coming here saying the under 35 crowd likes to date interracially. But as the poll among college students, indicated otherwise. No matter how much multicultural propaganda the media forces on the public, there will always be those who can&rsquo;t be brainwashed into being attracted to a group they instinctively are not drawn to.</p>

			<p>I noticed the last paragraph was different than the rest myself too, and I noticed it was almost comical. Comical, sad, and offensive, all at the same time. I thought the writer was being serious though and i didn&rsquo;t get that the last part was Meant to be a joke.</p>

<p>What poll are you talking about? Polls have to be taken with a grain of salt. They only represent a sub sample of people. Many times they range from 500-1000 people. The poll you are talking about may have been even smaller.</p>
<p>Did you see the article in USA TODAY. It talked about the increasing amount of interracial dating among young people.One 52 year old woman stted thatshe was &#8220;uncomfortable &#8221; with seeing such a large number of interracial couples. </p>
<p>I live here in an area of the southeast where there is a notable, not large number of Blacks and I see such couples all the time. I relaize that where I live is only one place, but I can imagine that in more racially diverse areas the numbers of interracial couples are even greater! </p>
<p>The fact is that it is happening. I am a 43 White woman married happily married to a 46 year old White man with three beautiful, blue eyed boys who we are teaching to be racial realists, not nationalists,but race realists. We believe that White nationalism is actually counterproductive. </p>
<p> I wish more people (and I think that the majority do) marry within our race, but no onecan deny that that the number of interracial couples is growing. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s jst a fact.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s actually pretty rare from my observation.  The last time I saw one was two years ago at the DMV.  This guy was in a wheelchair renewing his license and I observed him getting into his van and giving his handicapped black wife the wheelchair so she could renew hers.  </p>
<p>When guys have limited prospects like the one above I can see White guys dating blacks but a healthy White guy with self-esteem, no way. </p>

			<p>It has long been known that many women like bad boys.  That&rsquo;s why you see so many sissy men adopting tough guy fashions, like those razors that leave you with a three day stubble.  I don&rsquo;t listen to the Hollywood controlled excuse for country music that is on the air nowadays, but &#8220;Ladies Love Outlaws&#8221; used to be a regular theme of C&W.;  And a Blacks are bad, literally bad, so would they have appeal to White harlots.  How many chinless White wusses with nose rings can match a low-down Black for authentic wretchedness?</p>

<p>I respectfully have to disagree with you. As someone who does a fair amount of traveling - military bases, college campuses, big cities, rural areas etc&hellip; I can certainly say that I see a number of Black female/White male couples. It is not as common as the reverse, but it is becoming more and more commonplace.</p>
<p>In fact, I would say that the Black female/White male couples tend to be more attractive, sophisticated etc&hellip; It has been my experience that White men who date Black women tend to be more masculine than average and have a certain sexuality about them.</p>
<p>The weaker, less desireable White men that you seem to be describing do not date Black women, if anything, they tend to date Asian women.</p>

			<p>I am familiar with Razib&rsquo;s writings. Usually he writes quite sensibly, though in a somewhat baroque manner.  However, the content usually is sensible. He is perfectly aware of the pull that race and extended family have on peoples&rsquo; choices for mates. I think he&rsquo;s being a bit tongue in cheek here, but i don&rsquo;t know for sure. It&rsquo;s a long essay for keeping the tongue in cheek. BTW, I have seen his picture and he is cute, and I don&rsquo;t normally go for Indian guys. <br>
  I remember reading that Jane Goodall observed that young, female chimps, were among the likeliest to go into stranger groups of chimps and seek out males with whom they shared no history. This was often quite dangerous, and some were killed if I remember right. Older, more experience females did not do this much. It really does reflect the reality. Most girls who go with blacks are very young and experimentally inclined. Most are deeply repelled or at least mystified by their choices 20 years later.</p>

<p>Janet I know from previous boards where you&rsquo;ve posted that your black.  Here some news for you.  There&rsquo;s only about 60,000 White men in this country married to black women.  Is there some reason why you desperately want to believe that White men find black women desirable?  Do you feel unattractive unless a White man says you are?  I&rsquo;m not trying to belittle you, these are serious questions I&rsquo;m asking.  </p>

<p>The guys your describing can get any woman they want.  Why would they want a black woman over a blonde Swedish bombshell?  Sounds like your fishing with a lure but you don&rsquo;t have the right bait.</p>

<p>I have never said I was not Black! I have made this point clear in my post as you have said.</p>
<p>To answer your question, no, I do not need a White man, Black man or man of any race to tell me that I am beautiful. Although I do have me of all races tell me that I am attactive.</p>
<p>I am not sure what your point is? Perhaps you can explain it further for me?</p>

			<p>What is it about this topic that make some of you go bonkers!!!</p>
<p>The fact is tht more young people under 35 do date intercially and more are marrying. While it is treu that most people marry within their race, there are indeed a growing number who do date outside of their race as well.</p>
<p>It seems that the same perople who always rant and rave about statistics and how unreliable they are seem to have no problem pointing out &#8220;statistics&#8221; when it comes to this topic.</p>
<p>Whether people like it or not interracial dating and marriage is becoming more commonplace and it will probably continiue.</p>
<p>Stop fretting about it!</p>

<p>So I suppose a White woman is going to post on here that White men with black women are more masculine and sexy???  Girl, who you foolin?  I probably won&rsquo;t get an answer, but I&rsquo;ll ask anyhow.  What traits do black women have that they&rsquo;re able to snatch an eligible White man from a White woman?  I&rsquo;d like to get a serious answer.  I&rsquo;m a White male so please spare the ludicrous &#8220;he can&rsquo;t resist my big ole booty&#8221;.</p>

			<p>The fact is that most young White men are so promiscuous that they will have sex with any woman regardless of race. </p>
<p>Sex is all they are usually interested in. </p>

			<p>Here in Chicago there is an increasing number of yuppie-type white men who are dating black women. There is also an underbelly or hidden number of white males  &mdash;  often married to white women  &mdash;  who go on various dating sites seeking black women on the side. The ages of these white men vary from the 20&rsquo;s up into the 60&rsquo;s. If white women are the ultimate, then why do so many white men feel the need to sneak around on them? Statistics show that 1/3 of those on dating sites are married.Also, here in Chicago there is an increasing number of white women with black men. A lot of interracial couples are meeting off dating sites which aim at those interested in dating outside of their race.</p>
