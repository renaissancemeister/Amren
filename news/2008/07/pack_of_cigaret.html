<p>Six people, including two teenagers, were arrested in connection with the incident, in which the large crowd gathered to watch as at least five females and one male were using sticks, pipes and other blunt objects to strike a vehicle in the Racetrac Gas Station parking lot on South Pointe Boulevard around 1 a.m. Monday.</p>
<p>The 16-year-old female victim told Hurd (Lee Sheriff&rsquo;s deputy Erik Hurd) that she, her cousin and her cousin&rsquo;s boyfriend pulled in next to a gas pump when several females walked over and began arguing. Sheriff spokesman John Sheehan said the altercation appeared to be over a pack of stolen cigarettes, but the details of that allegation are unclear, he said. The two others in the car tried to calm the situation, but were unsuccessful.</p>
<p>The victim tried to drive away, Hurd said, but was chased by the other females, who began beating the sides of the vehicle with various objects, causing several thousand dollars in damage.</p>
<p>Gloria Hood, 20, Cherrelle Jones, 22, Tamra Harris, 23, Whitley Rodriguez, 20 &mdash; all of Fort Myers &mdash; and a 15-year-old Cape Coral teen were all charged with aggravated assault with intent to commit a felony and criminal mischief by damaging property.</p>

			<p>The tragedy is that we aren&rsquo;t shocked and awed any longer at the results of modern liberal values imparted to a modern generation that act them out like stone age hominids. So much tax money spent with so little desirable result. </p>

			<p>I`m not clear if the girls were arguing with the driver to begin with. It sounds more like the car that pulled in  tried to break up a fight  right next to them like good samaritans. Bad plan!! One other caution. Keep your doors locked as soon as you get in, or get out to go to the store.   I was leaving the Ice House (Texas Speak for Convience Store) when a woman jumped in the passenger seat and screamed, &#8220;Go! Go! Go! &#8221; I didn`t even have time to go what the&hellip; before her pimp reached in and started punching both of us. Drove over him and up the street before pushing her out. Lesson learned. </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m trying hard to read between the lines here. Were the victims White? There is no mention of this. My advice to my fellow Whites is to exercise care at all times around blacks. It is also a real good idea to always fill up when you hit the half-tank mark, preferably during the day in a safe location. You never want to run out of gas at the wrong time.</p>

			<p>If you&rsquo;re up for a whole evening of such nonsense, viewed from a safe distance, go to Youtube.com, then enter various key words such as &#8220;chimp-out&#8221; or &#8220;typical n&hellip; behavior.&#8221;  There&rsquo;s lots of it, both amusing &amp; depressing.</p>
<p>As for the orange jumpsuit girls&hellip; they are among their own people now, so it will be business as usual for them. If someone has a camera handy, maybe it&rsquo;ll all turn up on Youtube. </p>

			<p>What gets me is the good Samaritan.  Why would one want to step in and stop a fight between these animals?  Let them fight and kill each other.  And in the end the good samaritan was attacked.  I wonder if the 16 year-old female victim was White?  I&rsquo;m assuming the answer is probably yes.  Oh the joys of multiculturalism!!</p>

			<p>This is an example of pretty lousy reporting. There is almost no explanation of what happened in the news article  &mdash;   just a set of fragments. Looks like they just ran the story that way.  Why not ask a few people what happened? If it involved 200 people, there has to be a story to report here.</p>

<p>^That is true. The white liberals propigate their ideology on a healthy community and finally when it is completely overrun and terminally ill they abandon it for reasons of safety and comfort blaming the fleeing whites for not remaining in the now destitute crime ridden overrun area. Then they seek out a new healthy community and begin again.</p>
<p>The white liberal acts exactly like a virus does. </p>

 When I Bartended, we had a new  customer that was just a little bit more well heeled than the rest of us. The regulars demanded that I ask the man what he did for a living. He replied that he was a corporate Lear Jet pilot for oil executives. It was just a lil too out of the ordinary for most of us. One of the disbelievers blurted out for the man to prove he was  what he said he was. The guy responded, &#8220;The only time you have too much fuel on board is when you`re on fire!&#8221; Case closed. Drinks for the newcomer all around.</p>

			<p>Can someone answer this question:<br>
Why is the left so opposed to cigarette smoking as opposed to other harmful bodily activity like drinking, drugs and junk food? <br>
It&rsquo;s not as if whites smoke more than blacks.<br>
I personally am against smoking, but we have become so PC against it in the media and educational institutions as opposed to other worse obscenities and harmful activities that it bothers me.</p>

			<p>  I&rsquo;ve met some pretty tough working class black women over the last few years. Some are as muscular and aggressive as their men. Unfortunately, unseemly thuggish behavior has been increasing for black lower class women, something you really didn&rsquo;t see much of twenty years ago in the South. This is gender progress? As Robert Kelly says the controlled media blames this on &#8220;gangs&#8221;. </p>

			<p>It just seems like society is crumbling.  I think a lot of people are starting to sense that things are unraveling from talking to people.  I know I plan to stock up on supplies come November 7th - super Tuesday. Heck I&rsquo;m thinking about leaving the US altogether. I&rsquo;m almost covinced the government doesn&rsquo;t *sincerely* care about the safety of its citizens anymore.</p>

			<p>This doesn&rsquo;t surprise me.  Black women have been shown to have higher testosterone in their systems than white women.  Mix that with low class values, and it is a great recipe.    You can make your own speculation.  </p>

			<p>These women are old enough to have four children apiece by now.<br>
Why weren&rsquo;t they home with them at 1:00a.m.?  And the 16 year-old<br>
victim should have been home too.  Young girls are woefully unprotected and unsupervised in our modern society.</p>

			<p>I still can&rsquo;t make hide nor tail out of this story. Were the victims White? Either the reporter is completely inept or they are deliberately suppressing facts. My advice is still the same. Never go below half a tank of gas and be very wary of blacks.</p>

			<p>I was in Ireland last summer. As a result of the EU even<br>
Ireland has black immigration. While riding from Dublin<br>
to Kildare via bus I sat through a fist fight of black girls<br>
fighting over a lottery ticket. The shocked white Irish on the bus asked me if this was common in America and I said yes, indeed it was. On anystreet corner in any black neighborhood you can see the same behaviour. This year the Irish voted not to ratify the EU  Constitution. </p>
