<h1><a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article4276489.ece">Sniffer Dogs to Wear &lsquo;Muslim&rsquo; Bootees</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stuart MacDonald, London Times, July 6, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Police sniffer dogs will have to wear bootees when searching the homes of Muslims so as not to cause offence.</p>
<p>Guidelines being drawn up by the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) urge awareness of religious sensitivities when using dogs to search for drugs and explosives. The guidelines, to be published this year, were designed to cover mosques but have been extended to include other buildings.</p>
<p>Where Muslims object, officers will be obliged to use sniffer dogs only in exceptional cases. Where dogs are used, they will have to wear bootees with rubber soles. &#8220;We are trying to ensure that police forces are aware of sensitivities that people can have with the dogs to make sure they are not going against any religious or cultural element within people&rsquo;s homes. It is being addressed and forces are working towards doing it,&#8221; Acpo said.</p>
<p>Problems faced by the use of sniffer dogs were highlighted last week when Tayside police were forced to apologise for a crime prevention poster featuring a german shepherd puppy, in response to a complaint by a Muslim councillor.</p>
<p>Islamic injunctions warn Muslims against contact with dogs, which are regarded as &#8220;unclean&#8221;.</p>
<p>Police dogs at present are issued with footwear only at scenes of explosions to prevent them injuring their paws on broken glass.</p>
<p>Ibrahim Mogra, one of Britain&rsquo;s leading imams, said the measures were unnecessary: &#8220;In Islamic law the dog is not regarded as impure, only its saliva is. Most Islamic schools of law agree on that. If security measures require to send a dog into a house, then it has to be done. I think Acpo needs to consult better and more widely.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know in the Muslim community there is a hang-up against dogs, but this is cultural. Also, we know the British like dogs; we Muslims should do our bit to change our attitudes.&#8221;</p>
<p>John Midgley, co-founder of the Campaign Against Political Correctness, said: &#8220;The police are in effect being overly sensitive to potential criminals and not being sensitive enough to the public at large who need to be protected. These sort of things have a counter-productive effect because they cause huge friction between different communities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Caroline Kisko, of the Kennel Club, said: &#8220;We would not condone any attempt to make search dogs wear special clothing, which could cause them distress.&#8221;<br>

			<p>Pavlov`s Revenge<br>
I would give my sniffer dog a Milk-Bone every time it pooped in a house it was searching shortly after I put booties on it. When the dog`s bowels grumbled and his mouth drooled as I put the booties on, I would know that Pavlov was a genius and I was a damn fine student of operant conditioning. </p>

<p>Ban piggy banks, ban stuffed pigs at work, put bootees on search dogs, call 3 year-olds racist if the don&rsquo;t like foreign food, feel up 93 year-old great-grandmothers at airports, and - what? - oh, GIVE YOUR COUNTRY TO A BUNCH OF INVADERS WHO DESPISE AND HATE YOU.</p>

<p>I wonder how many drug dealers will &#8220;convert&#8221; to islam to keep the law from searching their property, except in exceptional cases?</p>

<p>Yet they&rsquo;ll come crashing into Christian homes not only oblivious to offending anyone but not caring one iota whether the place is trashed and little pets are killed in the process.</p>
<p>Britain is in worse shape than the US, and the populace should form their own militias over there in order to protect themselves against a government gone stark raving berserk.</p>
<p>The time is now.  A line has just been crossed.</p>

Unbelievable! I wish I could say only in Britain, but I fear it&rsquo;s coming soon to America too. If these muslims are suspected of breaking the law, let the dogs sniff and be damned to their prejudices against it. If they are that offended then they can go commit their crimes somewhere else. In fact, PLEASE DO! </p>

			<p>Don&rsquo;t blame the muslims.  It is white marxists who came up with this garbage.  It is white marxists that permit third world colonization of their own countries.  It is white marxists that have destroyed Christendom.  But at least our dogs will have clean paws.</p>

Good grief!  What will be next?  Each month another news article brings us more incredible nonsense.  How much bending over backwards and groveling do we have to do to appease these cranky, demanding people&hellip;.  these fanatics, who are, after all, <b>guests in our home</b>?</p>
<p>When are they going to be told that their welcome has been exhausted?  When are our authorities going to show some backbone?</p>

			<p>I said before, after 5 years here in the middle east among the Muslims, I know for a fact a great many of them keep dogs and this includes the Amir of Kuwait in his huge beach front mansion in Kuwait city, and most all of the rural farmers have dogs of some sort and walking along the dirt roads you will be barked at and chased (if not attacked) as you would in any American city. As a thought!! aren&rsquo;t PIGS also being trained to sniff explosives and drugs too?? PERFECT! and next the Muslims will be needing their C-4 back because it is used in religious practices (martyrdom)</p>

			<p>No, no, and no!!! No public special consideration for religious nuts. They don&rsquo;t like it move to a primarily muslim country. These people complain about their rights but persecute, kill, and oppress peoples of other religion, even offshoots of Islam. No leeway should be given to murderous, abusive, misogynistic, anti-tolerant/non-tolerant, free speech hating, dog hating, irrational, backwards, non-muslim hating, and need I say? hate filled religion of Islam.</p>

<p>Huge rise in number of racist attacks</p>
<p>By Nigel Morris, Home Affairs Correspondent<br>
Wednesday, 9 July 2008</p>
<p>Record numbers of racist incidents – from verbal abuse to stabbings – are being reported to police, fuelling fears that levels of Islamophobia are rising.</p>
<p>More than 61,000 complaints of racially motivated crime were made in 2006-07, a rise of 28 per cent in just five years, with increases reported by most police forces in England and Wales. Officers classified 42,551 of the complaints as racially or religiously aggravated offences. Nearly two thirds were offences of harassment, 13 per cent wounding, 12 per cent criminal damage and 10 per cent assault.</p>
<p>In a report on race and the criminal justice system, the Ministry of Justice also disclosed that police used their powers to stop and search one million people. Black people were seven times more likely to be searched than white people and Asians twice as likely.</p>

Allow me to  point out to our American readers that the term &#8220;Asians&#8221; here does not refer to Orientals, as they would assume, but in this case  to those persons from the Indian subcontinent.</p>
