			<p>An entire race of people, whites, vanished from LA, this isn&rsquo;t considered worthy of news, but an increase of 0.2 percent in the number of whites (in 8 out of 50 US cities) is important news (see yesterdays news story). </p>

			<p>The maps only go back to 1940, but if we went back to around 1850, you would see L.A. going from being a Mexican city to mostly white.  The maps we see here show it going back from white to mostly Mexican again.</p>
<p>The biggest story here, looking at all of the maps from recent decades, is how the black community has been subsumed by the growing Hispanic districts.  The black area is getting smaller, and is probably much smaller now than in the 2000 map. Nearly all of what became the black area after 1945 (South L.A., Pacoima), have become greatly Hispanicized and now even Compton and Watts are at the borderline.  The black majority precincts are being shoved out around Inglewood and Baldwin Hills.</p>
<p>What struck me greatly the last time I walked around downtown L.A. was how few blacks there were.  According to the 2006 census estimate, there are 955,000 blacks in L.A. County, but walking around downtown, you see a lot of Hispanics, Asians, and whites, but hardly any blacks. It is as if they have disappeared.  </p>
<p>If we whites are feeling the impact of the Hispanic invasion, imagine what it must be like for blacks.</p>

			<p>  Isn&rsquo;t it interesting that the main black area, including Watts and Compton, grew steadily from 1940 through 1990   &mdash;   then, BAM! by 2000, it had shrunk significantly as Hispanics drove the blacks out of what they had believed was &#8220;their&#8221; turf.</p>
<p>  Maybe now some of those blacks can see how Whites felt in city after city in the 1950s and 1960s as they were pushed out into the suburbs. It&rsquo;s not like the Whites fled with the blacks calling after them, &#8220;Wait! Please don&rsquo;t go! We want to have you as neighbors!&#8221; When blacks reached a tipping point in a neighborhood   &mdash;   say 30 percent or more   &mdash;   they often aggressively made it more and more uncomfortable, even unsafe, for Whites to live there anymore.</p>
<p>  Also note on the Los Angeles maps how the number of Asian and Pacific Islander neighborhoods grew from insignificant in 1940, to possibly the city&rsquo;s second-largest non-White element in 2000. The blacks seem to be   &mdash;   excuse the pun   &mdash;   slowly fading away.</p>

			<p>Looks like the blacks are COMPLETELY surrounded by mestizos. </p>
<p>Tom Chittum in his book, Civil War II, maintains that blacks will be overwhelmed by mestizos in California and by looking at the current map of Los Angeles it is plain to see why.  </p>
<p>Looks like there&rsquo;s a total of about 2 million blacks in California.  That&rsquo;s a lot of people to lose in the opening salvo of a possible civil upheaval.</p>

			<p>I wasn&rsquo;t aware that the deliberately provocative use of &#8220;anglo&#8221; to describe all the diverse white American peoples dated back to 1940 as the map of that date suggests. And on careful review, it becomes apparent that the &#8220;anglo&#8221; designation was imposed by the Ralph &amp; Goldy Lewis Center this year rather than having been used by us in 1940.</p>
<p>I know &#8220;Anglo-Saxons&#8221; but I have never met a person who says, &#8220;Call me anglo.&#8221; The label itself is imposed on us to confuse us about who we are, and those who are &#8220;Anglo-Saxons&#8221; would do well to demand that designation so the rest of us can enjoy our Celtic, Germanic, Italic, Gallic, and Slavic diversity.</p>
<p>As a Polish-American, the labeling on these maps is based on a sense of supremacy by the map-makers who believe they have the power to name us, and it is based on a desire to smother the wonderful diversity that we enjoy into a narrow, unchosen label. We&rsquo;re smart enough to name ourselves.</p>

			<p>This was the intended result of the Immigration Act of 1965. The people behind that actually believed this would happen quicker. The same people and their children push for open borders today, and spend millions lobbying in favor of legal and illegal immigration. Don&rsquo;t bring up Ted Kennedy either when discussing who did this. He was either paid or threatened into being one of the sponsors of the act. He did not write it or have anything else to do with its creation. Do some research and then ponder just what kind of hate was behind this traitorous piece of legislation. </p>

I&rsquo;d like to ditto that.  Last year I visited California with my kids.  I dubbed it the &#8220;California dream&#8221; trip, as we were only going to go to the good parts of California  &mdash;  mostly within the L.A. area.  The vitality, creativity, and energy made it an exciting place to be, but I could not fully block out the demographic changes happening to the area.  I&rsquo;ve lived in the L.A. area on three separate occasions, for a total of about a year, and it&rsquo;s a shame.  I think of a visit to Griffith Park, where I spoke with an older woman, a Polish immigrant, who remarked how the Mexicans had little respect for the park, leaving trash and committing petty acts of vandalism.  I look up above my computer, where I have hanging a framed copy of Hileman&rsquo;s Recreation and Geological Map of Griffith Park, and wonder what interest these foreign populations could possibly have in it. And in the end, I&rsquo;ll never cease to be amazed at how Angelinos (or Californians&hellip;or, for that matter, Americans) can allow this to happen.</p>

			<p> The former White majority in Los Angeles caused this to happen. Greedy business owners, contractors, and growers were all too eager to sell out thier children&rsquo;s future, profiting by hiring illegal[and legal] Mexican labor, slitting the throats, as it were, of thier own people.<br>
 And when the inevitable total Mexican La Raza take over finally happened these White communities, rather than take a stand chose to flee the city wich thier pioneering forefather&rsquo;s created.<br>
  Now all the Whites can do is cry and look for some other group, or government officials to blame.</p>

<p>Living in L.A. county for a very long time, I agree with Mick. In fact, this is same conclusion applies to the whole nation. European Americans have been sold out by traitors, who, are/were largely European Americans. Does anyone argue otherwise?</p>

			<p>The situation in LA is actually worse than the maps of 1940 and 2000 would suggest.  Looking at the 2000 map, you might get the sense that much of LA is much like it was in 1940.  But back in 1940, LA county was about 93% white.  In 2000, those neighborhoods  that have a white majority are often not much over 50% white.  It is highly unusual to find areas over 80% white, especially among the under-18 population.</p>

<p>No, they have no foresight or hindsight or empathy for whites in any way, shape or form. To them the Hispanics are just another form of Whitey, and we are still somehow to blame for their &#8220;oppression&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Poster Stanley Womack is correct in being offended at having a label stuck on him by someone else. But I think that this is a diversion. The marxist left is all for the Whites in America to think of themselves as Celtic, Germanic, Italic, or Slavic. The thing that they most fear would be for all these groups to unite under one name WHITE. It is ok and wonderful for blacks, asians, and hispanics to do so. But for Whites to do it is racist, hate-ful, divisive, etc etc. While there is a great diversiy among Whites I believe what Whites most need to do is solidify as all the other groups do and act as a block.</p>

Posted by Anon</p>
<p>I think you mean Spanish, not Mexican, there&rsquo;s a big difference.<br>
I wonder why there&rsquo;s no Asian category for 1940, there was actually alot in 1940, unless they didn&rsquo;t make up a majority. Parts of East Los Angeles were heavily Japanese until the internment camps. Just think, illegals don&rsquo;t exactly volunteer census data, it&rsquo;s even worse than what this shows, plus it&rsquo;s 8 years old.</p>

			<p> I will always look at Southern California as a white area. The  white people there where never protected from invasion, as stated in the constitution. Our greedy and traitorous politicians sold out my people. I&rsquo;m not from southern California and never lived there but am adopting the state as my own. I will vacation there every year in honor of my white brothers and sisters who were sold out by evilness and greed. Maybe someday we will take the state back. I hope white people honor SoCal and spend their vacation money there.</p>

<p>Apparently, Wayne Eagle doesn&rsquo;t get the big picture. It&rsquo;s not about Blacks, it&rsquo;s about Hispanics and the fact that their numbers are increasing day by day, so in the long run, the whole bigger picture-who are the ones being affected by this&hellip;everyone, including the whites, blacks did not force or tell the Hispanics to relocate, so this blaming blacks is just a scapegoat. <br>
You actually think the Hispanics will stop, after they take over L.A. County, what&rsquo;s next? Perhaps O.C.? Don&rsquo;t forget Nevada, Arizona and Texas. You need to open your eyes and focus on the real problems in this country. Illegal Immigration and if the government doesn&rsquo;t get it under control in the NEAR FUTURE, when all of Mexico has relocated to the U.S. you can&rsquo;t say, &#8220;well, the blacks are at least gone&#8221; Because the White man will surely follow.</p>

			<p>Here is a national view of the same kind of thing:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.usapopulationmap.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.usapopulationmap.com</a></p>
<p>As for someone&rsquo;s claim that LA was originally mostly Mexican - but the real truth is that by today&rsquo;s standards LA was mostly BARREN.</p>
<p>The total population in the 1836 census was just 2,228. This makes sense from most historical accounts I read. When whites started moving in to LA, it was nearly vacant.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.laalmanac.com/history/hi01b.htm" rel="nofollow">https://www.laalmanac.com/history/hi01b.htm</a></p>
<p>More than likely whites didn&rsquo;t run off a single Mexican from the city. As millions poured in, they just became a tiny fraction of the population.</p>

			<p>They count West Asians as white in these statistics.  The number of people of European ancestry is much lower than this picture suggest.  West Asians probably out number European whites in LA proper and definately do in cities like Beverly Hills and Glendale.  The bigger areas of white people in that map are low population density or mountains with no people living there.  </p>

			<p>2:55 AM&rsquo;s map is truly horrifying. Check out the 2090 map. Over 1 billion people in the US (think India or China style overpopulation) and to make matters even worse, 75% non-White. I don&rsquo;t imagine most of those non-Whites are going to be Punjabis, Koreans and Japanese either. Thank God I will be dead before that day comes. No way can this nation survive as a superpower or any kind of power with those kind of demographics and overpopulation figures. I guess we will resemble a typical Latin American nightmare state. No doubt the Rich will be very happy, but there will be teeming revolutionary masses below.</p>

			<p>I look at that map and can&rsquo;t help but think about L.A blacks and O.J. Simpson. They were so smug about how he got off afterwards. And where are they now? Blacks in L.A. are almost pushed out and irrelevant in the Latino tsunmai that has engulfed them. Meanwhile their &#8220;hero&#8221; the Juice is golfing it up in Florida and couldn&rsquo;t care less about them. Such a meaningless Pyrrhic black &#8220;victory&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Los Angeles has gone from being a white, 1st world place to a 3rd world latin american place in less than 60 years. Wake up America, because the whole country will be 3rd world if this mass immgration, illegal or legal, doesn&rsquo;t stop. I feel for our grandkids.</p>

			<p>I was suprised to see the huge difference from whites to non-whites in such a short period of time. Where did all the blacks go? We know they reproduce faster than whites yet their numbers are decreasing. They must be invading other areas and displacing whites there.</p>
<p>What are West Asians; East Indians, Pakistanis? And why would they be counted as whites? I thought the census was a result from all the data gathered from families and individuals. Why would a West Asian say he/she is white? They would check Non-White or Other.</p>
<p>The answer is to tighten the borders now. A huge wall, dogs, well paid soldiers and high-tech equipment to protect and prevent invaders.</p>

			<p>Sad to see&hellip;and to think that 1960-65 LA was a network of beautiful, safe, white neighborhoods!  You could grow up there  &mdash;  be proud of your race and community, play football, go surfing, listen to the beach boys&hellip;a great time.  Now its gone, and we don&rsquo;t even know how to organize ourselves for a counter-offensive.</p>

			<p>1850? There were so few Mexicans here they didn&rsquo;t even count them in the 1850 census. You can check for yourself here: https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/twps0056.html</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ll never cease to be amazed at how Angelinos (or Californians&hellip;or, for that matter, Americans) can allow this to happen.</p>

<p>Wrong. It was the LEADERS of the state and nation who allowed this. The average white person had nothing to do with this, just as the average white around the US who are seeing their neighborhoods, cities and states turn brown and black at far, far faster rates have little to do with it. </p>
<p>I did what was suggested earlier in the thread and took a look at the origin of the Immigration Act of &#8216;65. Shocking. Legislation based in hate and intended to destroy the US. Sickening. The politicians in Washington sold out the US for cash in hand. </p>
