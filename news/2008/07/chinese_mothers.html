<h1><a href="http://bordercontrol.blogspot.com/2008/07/chinese-mothers-seek-their-own-gold.html">Chinese Mothers Seek Their Own &lsquo;Gold Medal&rsquo; Baby With American Citizenship</a></h1>
					<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>U.S. Border Control, July 24, 2008</i></p>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In May 2008, President George W. Bush signed into law The Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008. Chinese mothers are using the law as a means to bring home their own &lsquo;gold medal,&rsquo; a baby with American citizenship.</p>
<p>The Act enabled the United States to take over the labor and immigration system of Saipan, the largest island and capital of the U.S. Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). As a result, employers in Saipan are now allowed to apply for U.S. work visas for immigrant workers under the new act. Also, importantly, babies born in Saipan are now automatically U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>Many Chinese moved quickly to take advantage of the act. Immigration services in big Chinese cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Wuhan have started programs like &#8220;Labor Export to Saipan&#8221; and &#8220;Deliver an American Baby in Saipan.&#8221;</p>
<p>Expectant mothers pay anywhere from 140,000 to 240,000 RMB (about $20,000 to $35,000) for the service that allows them to deliver their babies in Saipan.<br>

			<p>Why does the U.S. have Saipan or the northern Marianas? What use are these islands to America? What do we need them for? Heck we shouldn&rsquo;t even have made Hawaii a state, but this is ridiculous. Time for a strategic withdrawal. Google HEGEMONY EVERYWHERE BUT AT HOME by Paul Craig Roberts.</p>

			<p>Another one of those great programs that there is no way the majority of Americans would agree with, but the wonderful politicians we elect stick us with.  </p>

			<p>More anchor babies? And China has how many desperate housewives, eager to avoid the one child per family law? Plus citizenship, and you don&rsquo;t even have to be in the United States when it happens. I can just imagine the chain migration that will follow. How did Washington manage to slip this one past the watchdogs?</p>

			<p>I know this African lady who came to Britain on a one year temporary visa. Just before she came she got impregnated by some guy back home so that her child could get a British passport. She told me it is very common among Africans to come impregnated or to have as much babies in the U.K as possible. After they are born many children are sent back to Africa but come back before their 18th birthday to claim British citizenship. </p>

			<p>Oh Jeez, they are really hedging their bets, aren&rsquo;t they? If they can&rsquo;t outbreed us with illegals, or affirmative action us to death from our own native blacks, they will have a waiting group of &#8220;intellectually superior&#8221; people to displace the white race.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s nonsense, Britain does not have automatic birthright citizenship, and as a matter of fact, the US is probably the only nation that does.  It is a long difficult (but not impossible) process for someone in the UK to have an anchor baby.</p>

			<p>All people everywhere in the world will soon be American Citizens, as per the many, many, TRAITORS, that we have in &#8220;charge&#8221; of this nation. I can&rsquo;t think of another word for them, try as I may.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not familiar with all of Britain&rsquo;s immigration policy and I don&rsquo;t know if the person who made the original statement about the African lady is British or not. However, even if they don&rsquo;t have a policy of birthright citizenship, they or other countries  may  allow those children born to people in the country legally, either citizenship or an easier path to citizenship. I&rsquo;m not sure about this but it does happen in some countries.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s happening in Canada too&hellip;.they come over on visits here when they are 9 months pregnant and make sure they don&rsquo;t pop til they land on Canadian soil.  If the child is born here the child is automatically a citizen and of course the government does everything in its power to make the parents citizens too. Sadly, the US is not the only country. </p>

			<p>SUMMER 2008 will be like SUMMER 1968&hellip; a watershed year in American politics. A tidal shift in the mentality of the average white voter is taking place and the blogs at Amren and elsewhere are acting like seismographs. In the meantime..READ Mark Steyns book &#8220;America Alone&#8221; to get a sense of the unbelievable global demographic shifts that are being arrayed against this country.<br>
