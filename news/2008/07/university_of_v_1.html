<h1>University of Virginia Publication Sheds Light on Profile of Foreign-Born Virginia Residents</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>University of Virginia, July 1, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->

<p>As Americans celebrate the founding of our nation on Independence Day, 75 foreign-born Virginia residents, gathering with family, friends, dignitaries and visitors, will take a hard-earned oath of citizenship on the lawn at Thomas Jefferson&rsquo;s Monticello. Those new citizens join other foreign-born Virginians who have taken their oaths in ceremonies throughout the year from Harrisonburg to Hampton.</p>
<p>Recognizing the importance of the foreign-born to Virginia, the University of Virginia&rsquo;s Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service released a study of all of Virginia&rsquo;s foreign-born residents, noting that new arrivals account for one-quarter of the commonwealth&rsquo;s population growth since 2000. In the second edition of &#8220;Stat Chat,&#8221; a digest of facts about demographic topics of current interest, Cooper Center demographers report that one in 10 Virginians is foreign-born, and the percentage of foreign-born in Virginia has increased dramatically since 1970. In 2006, the top five countries of birth for Virginia&rsquo;s foreign-born were El Salvador, Mexico, Korea, Philippines and India.</p>
<p>Forty-three percent of the foreign-born in Virginia have become United States citizens through the naturalization process, which requires applicants to be 18 years of age; maintain lawful residence in the United States for five consecutive years; demonstrate good moral character, English language ability and knowledge of U.S. history and government; and take an oath of allegiance to the United States. Naturalized citizens exceed the foreign-born non-citizens and their native-born counterparts in household income and educational attainment.</p>
<p>Using 2006 data from the United States Census Bureau&rsquo;s American Community Survey, the center&rsquo;s demographers also found that:</p>
<p># Almost three-quarters of the foreign-born in Virginia are between the ages of 25 and 64, suggesting migration to Virginia for employment opportunities.</p>
<p># The educational attainment of the foreign-born is represented in two extremes. Overall, a larger percentage of foreign-born Virginians than their native-born counterparts has less than a high school diploma. At the same time, a larger percentage of the foreign-born has earned a bachelor&rsquo;s or graduate/professional degree.</p>
<p># Households headed by foreign-born persons have higher median incomes than those headed by their native-born counterparts.</p>
<p># The foreign-born population in 2006 was primarily from Latin America and Asia. In contrast, in 1900, there were few, if any Virginians from Latin America and 1 percent were from Asia.</p>
<p># The Washington/Arlington/Alexandria metropolitan region leads the commonwealth with one in every five residents being foreign-born (20 percent of the region&rsquo;s population). Harrisonburg ranks second (9 percent), followed by Charlottesville, Richmond, Virginia Beach and Winchester, all with 6 percent of the population foreign-born.</p>
<p>&#8220;Understanding the diversity and strengths of Virginia&rsquo;s foreign-born population is essential to tapping their abilities to contribute to Virginia&rsquo;s future,&#8221; said Qian Cai, director of the Cooper Center&rsquo;s Demographics and Workforce section. &#8220;The profiles, potential and needs of foreign-born Virginians are changing. Thorough understanding of these trends, combined with careful planning and sound public policy, will help Virginia meet their needs and benefit from their contributions.&#8221;</p>

			<p>The more a community has untalked about interracial dating, the more they seem eager to bring in large numbers of immigrants of all colors. Wonder why that could be?</p>

			<p>Thomas Jefferson would have had them &#8220;escorted&#8221; off the property in his time, if they were that lucky. I really think this would make him gag.</p>

			<p>I was a student at U.Va. when it admitted it&rsquo;s first two black students. It started very slowly, and we stupidly had little notion of the madness that lay ahead.</p>
<p>This country needs such a housecleaning, throwing out things not really needed and putting what remains back in its place.</p>

			<p>Virginians need to wake up and get organized.  Vote Constitution Party this year for president.  Join NumbersUSA, Fairus, and support Amren, Vdare, etc.  Don&rsquo;t repeat PC and don&rsquo;t blather it when you don&rsquo;t believe it.</p>

			<p>I am surprised that with all these - now American- morons demanding sharia and allegiance to Allah only they are not prosecuted for lying under oath, treason or obtaining citizenship under false pretenses.</p>

<p><br>
That should be easy. No one really believes it. Noone over 30 years old anyway. Blacks don&rsquo;t even believe it. It would be like turning water to wine, however, for them to tell the truth. I&rsquo;m not sure their psyches could handle it. Too much of a shock to the system. <br>

			<p>I wonder how Virginia got to be so productive before it had all of these diverse people?</p>

			<p>  I think Robert E. Lee and Jeff Davis knew that a tyrannical federal government could only impose its will on a free citizenry by force. They both resisted this illegal and unconsitutional centralization of power. However, I bet they had no idea that whites would eventually be supplanted by persons of color imported from overseas by the same government they fought so long and hard against. </p>
