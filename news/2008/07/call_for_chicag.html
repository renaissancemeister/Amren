<h1><a href="https://apnews.myway.com/article/20080729/D9275U8G0.html">Call for Chicago Students to Skip 1st School Day</a></h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Community leaders on Monday called on students from poorer parts of Chicago to protest inequalities in school funding by skipping the first day of classes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Today we are back to two-tiered schools &mdash; white and affluent on one side, and black, brown and poor on the other,&#8221; said Meeks, who also is a minister on the city&rsquo;s South Side. &#8220;That&rsquo;s an injustice and it&rsquo;s immoral.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meeks said he expects several thousand Chicago students to travel in a caravan of buses to New Trier Township High School in the leafy, North Shore suburb of Winnetka, where they will attempt to enroll.</p>
<p>State statistics indicate that the New Trier district spends around $17,000 annually on each of its students compared to the roughly $10,000 a year spent for each student in Chicago public schools.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Officials at New Trier Township High School District 203 said it wasn&rsquo;t yet clear how they&rsquo;ll deal with so many Chicago students showing up at one time to attempt to enroll at the high school.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Meeks said the protesters would seek to enroll based on state rules allowing students to transfer to another district if their safety is at risk. The inferior education they receive in Chicago, he said, &#8220;was not good for the safety of their futures.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Once again blacks demand that whites pay to educate their children.</p>

			<p>I have a great idea.  The high tech industry is leaving poor little black me behind, so I&rsquo;ll skip school.</p>
<p>When I was growing up, it was understood that everyone had a job to do.  My father had a job as a university professor.  My mother had a job as a bank loan officer (now you know where I got my attitude about money), and my sister and I each had a job - our jobs were going to school.  I also did most of the yardwork and she took care of the dog.  Mowing a lawn is still so ingrained in me that I miss pushing a mower around and smelling fresh-cut grass.</p>
<p>Leaving family expectations aside, I really liked high school.  As you might expect, a wealthy university town could afford to hire some good teachers.  My chemistry teacher had been badly poisoned during his time in industry, but I think Bruce Bush was the best teach of any subject in my life.  He retired only when he was too sick to teach.  My German teacher was Inge Sargeant, who wrote &#8220;Twilight Over Burma&#8221;.  Her first husband was Prince of the Shan state, and he was murdered by the army during the coup there.</p>
<p>The last time we spoke was outside of the grocery store in my old neighborhood.  She was suprised I didn&rsquo;t have an arm or a leg in a cast.</p>
<p>Skipping school really means resignation to a night job stocking shelves at Wal Mart for the rest of your life.</p>

			<p>Just a little OT:</p>
<p>I just looked at a friend&rsquo;s MSTA (Maryland State Teachers Association) pocket calendar for 2008-09. This year, folks, Christmas (according to calendar) is on December 30th.</p>
<p>And people wonder about the product they put out. </p>

			<p>Some ideas are just too stupid to comment on.</p>
