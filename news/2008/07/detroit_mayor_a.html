<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick is now charged with exchanging romantic text messages with additional women in the scandal that has him fighting allegations that he lied under oath about an intimate relationship with his former chief of staff.</p>
<p>An investigator&rsquo;s report says the Wayne County prosecutor&rsquo;s office has determined that Kilpatrick sent and received text messages with &#8220;intimate or romantic content&#8221; to several women who were not his wife or former Chief of Staff Christine Beatty.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The allegations led the prosecutor&rsquo;s office to amend two current charges against the 38-year-old mayor. The amended complaint was signed by a district court magistrate and changes a misconduct-in-office charge and one of four perjury charges.</p>
<p>The misconduct-in-office charge alleges that Kilpatrick authorized the city to prevent the release of text messages containing intimate or romantic messages to women other than his wife or Beatty.</p>
<p>The amended perjury charge accuses Kilpatrick of lying under oath about romantic or sexual relationships with Beatty &#8220;and or other persons not his wife.&#8221;<br>
{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;She [prosecutor Kym Worthy] has no case, and the city is tired of it,&#8221; Kilpatrick said after an event promoting Labor Day activities in Detroit.</p>

			<p>If you read this guy&rsquo;s bio in wikipedia, it almost reads like something out of the Gospel of St Obama: youngest Democratic leader of the Michigan legislature, youngest mayor of Detroit, JD from Michigan State i.e., a young black man on the rise.</p>
<p>But wait! This guy is under investigation for being horny, cheating on his wife, and lying about it! It only goes to prove that in the end black men only care about nice clothes, nice cars, and lots of sex &hellip; </p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t seen it in a while, check out Robocop 2. They&rsquo;ve got this black guy who plays the mayor, and although they only meant him to be a spoof on Marion Barry, it&rsquo;s too close to the truth on what black political leadership is like. God help us.</p>

			<p>Unfortunately Spaniard, &#8220;The gospel of Saint Obama&#8221; is going to be required reading for us &#8216;crackers&rsquo; real soon. <br>
I haven&rsquo;t seen Robocop 2, but I&rsquo;m surprised they would portray a Black mayor in anything but the most positive light.  It&rsquo;s those evil White mayors that we have to watch out for. - And you&rsquo;re correct - God help us - &#8216;cause we&rsquo;re gonna need it - and soon.</p>

			<p>Sounds to me like they have a lot of evidence already, and each story reveals even more damning proof against him.</p>
<p>Expect to see the first use of the phrase &#8220;don&rsquo;t hate da playa, hate da game&#8221; by a defense team ever.</p>

			<p>Did he expose himself to anyone, or smoke a tainted cigar, or rape someone, or commit sodomy in his office? It&rsquo;s only soliciting sex, what the hey, and lying under oath? Not a problem. I&rsquo;m sure he can site the above as a prec{s}ident. Plus he has the advantage of playing the race card. You gotta love it!  </p>

			<p>If we had any true political leadership in the State of Michigan, the governor would have already removed him from office.  Instead, he is allowed to make a further mockery of the city.  </p>
<p>Thankfully, the marginally capable prosecutor Kym Worthy is African.  You can imagine the outcry that we would have heard from the black community about the &#8220;racist&#8221; charges if the prosecutor had been white.  As it is, even the black community is free to stand up against the corruption of this &#8220;hip-hop&#8221; mayor, and many have done just that.  He regularly gets heckled at public appearances.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think even his 17 lawyers will save him this time.  And hopefully, the scandal will remove his mother from office in the US Congressional elections this fall.</p>
