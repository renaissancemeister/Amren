						<p>Hydrangeas still bloom beside cedar-shingle homes, and yachts continue to bob beyond private beaches, but this old preserve of the rich and primped is undergoing a change unlike anything it has witnessed in the centuries since English explorers established the island as a whaling port.</p>
<p>Evidence of the change is at El Rincon Salvadoreño, the island&rsquo;s first restaurant catering to Latinos, at the newly expanded Star Brazil market off the road to the airport, and at the Island Flair clothing store opened two years ago by a Jamaican couple just off Main Street.</p>
<p>In the Nantucket School District, where a decade ago more than 95 percent of the students were white, 25 percent of this year&rsquo;s nearly 1,300 students are members of a minority group and 10 percent grew up speaking another language.</p>
<p>And then there is the Rev. Donovan Kerr&rsquo;s growing New Life Ministries church, which on Sundays attracts as many as 150 congregants, nearly all of them black or Hispanic.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The declining homogeneity of Nantucket&rsquo;s population &mdash; town officials estimate there are about 20,000 full-time residents, more than double what the US Census Bureau documented in 2000 &mdash; has introduced new stresses to an island unaccustomed to culture clashes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;What&rsquo;s changing is the people who&rsquo;ve come to Nantucket with the attitudes they&rsquo;ve gotten from the city,&#8221; said Deputy Chief Charles Gibson, who coauthored the report about the confrontation, which left a 13-year-old boy injured. &#8220;They&rsquo;re coming from other communities, where they&rsquo;ve been discriminated against .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they&rsquo;re not gaining their perceptions from Nantucket.&#8221;</p>
<p>But minorities throughout the 48-square-mile island say the majority has sometimes chafed at their arrival and decision to stay.</p>
<p>Kerr, the island&rsquo;s only black minister, said he has experienced the gamut of racism. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sharon Liburd, the mother of the 13-year-old who suffered a separated shoulder in the confrontation with police last summer, said her son and his friends are angry about the experience. The incident near the ferry docks occurred after an officer told the youths to move off the sidewalk, because they were on bicycles and allegedly blocking pedestrian traffic.</p>
<p>One of the boys suggested that the officer asked them to move because they were black, and after the two started arguing, the officer called for backup, prompting a response by all 16 officers on duty. The officers chased the boys, forced them on the ground and arrested two of them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>David Harding, a former Army sergeant who has lived on the island since 2001, spent seven years working for the Steamship Authority and says he left because of a steady stream of insults from passengers and colleagues. &#8220;If I were starting over again, I wouldn&rsquo;t live here,&#8221; said the 63-year-old African-American, who now shuttles residents and tourists around on a town bus. &#8220;It&rsquo;s very, very, very racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some minorities who moved to the island years ago said they share the concerns of whites who have been born and raised on Nantucket.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Assistant Town Clerk Linda MacDonald, who 18 years ago moved to Nantucket from New Zealand, sees the growing diversity nearly every day at Town Hall. The town doesn&rsquo;t track racial demographics, but a 2006 estimate by the US Census Bureau found that 10 percent of the island&rsquo;s population was black, more than 5 percent was Hispanic, and another 2 percent was either Asian or of mixed ethnicity.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Assistant Superintendent Carlos Colley, who is originally from Puerto Rico and moved to Nantucket about three years ago, said the school district has struggled to keep up with the rising number of students who aren&rsquo;t proficient in English. This year, 125 students in the district spoke English as their second language, and 34 students barely spoke English; 10 years ago, only nine students had another native language, but all of them spoke English.</p>

			<p>Illegal immigration has forced out blacks it seems, from their traditional strongholds. Katrina also forced blacks out from their self-made shanti town slums, and into the unassuming arms of white small town America. A police officer telling a black teenager to move his bike is an argument???? Are you JOKING?? Thats the kind of behavior, consistantly, that gets blacks &#8220;stereotyped&#8221; as lazy, violent,beligerent, uppidy&hellip;. </p>
<p>Ethnic displacement is a real threat to mainstream America. And Canada.</p>

			<p>  &#8221; Another lost paradise &#8221; thanks to America&rsquo;s own pogromical holocaust given to us by the Marxist demo-rat-ic party in federal power in 1965. This Immigration and Reform Act is the greatest ethnic, racial, religious cleansing(contaimination is a much better description )Se. Ted Kennedy,why didn&rsquo;t you get brain cancer before who authored this treasonous, traitorous hate crime, unconstitutional, non-democratic/republic piece of rubbish ?</p>

			<p>The only time I&rsquo;ve been in Nantucket was in 1994 when I was in third grade.  I grew up on Cape Cod back in the mid 1990s.  I went to Falmouth public schools for four years from Kindergarten through third grade.  I remember Falmouth, and the rest of the Cape, as almost entirely white, with only a few blacks and hispanics scattered around.  I was back in Falmouth some weeks ago and it seemed as if half the town was black or hispanic now.  I felt like I was a minority there since I was a white male.</p>

			<p>The liberals and Hollywood types who often talk about white on black racism ironically are usually above the whole situation in their all-white retreats with guards to protect them. The truth is they all go to the bank on the black racial issue, and have a vested interest in proclaiming America a racist country. The practice of blacks claiming bad treatment has become so lucrative it will continue well into the future, and always brings about a big response. It&rsquo;s a weapon blacks have in their hands and they will utilize it until it is no longer effective. The weapon was given to them by the liberals like Kennedy, Carter, and Kerry, rich, white moneybags, who pawn off their guilt on white middle class.</p>

			<p>I went there in 1995 and practically the entire island was White. It was a really beautiful place. How sad. There seems to be no area that blacks and other ethnics can not destroy. On the other hand this is Teddy Kennedy country and he was responsible for the 1965 immigration disaster. The diversity-praising blue-blood liberals are finally getting a taste of their own medicine.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m sorry if I kind of get some small pleasure from this, but the liberal East Coast is going to reap what it has and is continuing to sow, regarding the lax attitude towards illegal aliens and even the cavalier manner in which the East Coast regards its traditions, customs  &mdash;   or rightfull place in America. Too bad for stupid people. Life has a way of kicking stupidity in the teeth, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>

			<p>I think the people should start a charity where they give illegal aliens free bus tickets to Nantucket and other places in massachusetts. I think its a shame that massachusetts is so far east that the people living there barely get to experience any of the diversity they help to create. The leftist establishment in massachusetts has done so much to bring diversity to california&hellip; I think its high time people in california help repay the people of massachusetts by giving the people of massachusetts a chance to experience its own diversity. People in california could start their own volunteer organizations that send illegal immigrant criminal gang-bangers from El salvador to massachusetts. If you think i&rsquo;m joking your wrong. I seriously think volunteer organizations should form in california in order to send illegal immigrants to massachusetts and these organizations should present themselves to the public as being purely benevolent whose sole concern is the well being of illegal aliens.  </p>

			<p>I live on Nantucket and you bet there is a growing population of 3rd world people. They do the landscaping and the trash collection and the other jobs that don&rsquo;t pay so well. It is widely known that most of these people are illegal but a blind eye is turned because we need the labor. However, with the downturn in the economy, those jobs are now being eyed by hungry white folks from Vermont and New Hampshire where jobs are scarce and 15 bucks an hour at Stop &amp; Shop now looks pretty good to them.<br>
Accomodation on this island is extremely expensive and the minorities have to stay 20 or even 30 to a house to get by. The wealthy summer residents (who really run things here) are getting mighty tired of the increased crime and general malaise that the minorities have brought with them. We had a widely publicised rape by a black male last week who is still at large and there was a miraculous island wide sweep last year by the immigration authorities which rounded up 30 or 40 illegals and deported them. Strangely enough, these were all people with known links to drug dealing and crime on the island. No one else was arrested. A sort of &#8216;house cleaning&rsquo; exercise. Eventually it will just get too expensive for illegals to live here and that combined with the super wealthy not wanting to rub shoulders with gang bangers on Main Street will result in the labour being brought in from Hyannis or New Bedford every day,(which is already happening) and the sleepy island will return to its old ways. Unfortunately the rest of this country is not in a position to squeeze economic migrants out economically, but in Nantucket, &#8216;money talks&rsquo;</p>

That&rsquo;s what happens when you&rsquo;re rich, stingy, and depend on cheap labor. Soon the wage-slaves will take with the knife that which they have humiliated and degraded themselves for.</p>
<p>The rich have opened the gates to the smiling, begging, and seemingly docile workers. One day they&rsquo;re going to find their throats cut.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s impossible for me to feel sorry for anyone who makes such selfish and short-sighted decisions.</p>

			<p>I suppose the school system will be strained to the limit catering to the non-English speakers and the Blacks. Pretty soon the halls of the school will look and sound pretty much like those of any urban school on the mainland and many of the White kids will be emulating them in their behavior, speech and wardrobe choices.<br>
It used to be that living on an island afforded some measure of insulation against the barbarian hords and their sociopathic mentalities. It seems that one can never get far enough away.<br>

			<p>Now the untutored throngs are at the gates of Nantucket, in Yankeedom. These same northerners who sat back and allowed the South to have this shoved down their throats and smugly assured themselves that forced desegregation would never, ever find its way to their section of the nation. It took a few decades but here it is. Let&rsquo;s see how &#8220;tolerant&#8221; these New England yankees deal with it. And I, as a Southerner, will sit back and watch.</p>

<p>Exactly. Like so many of the posts here that touch on this theme.  It&rsquo;s like any idea, good or bad, that people at the time think it good.  Eventually the bad comes out.  Like Cars.  What a wonderful invention. But then came the pollution, traffic jams, deteriorations of the cities, that spread to the suburbs, accidents, deaths, etc.<br>
Or something like vinyl. One of the most ingenious and convenient and useful inventions ever. But few knew at the time the production of it would be deletirious to the health of the workers making it.<br>
But this idea - Diversity - which was a GREAT idea and still is in its original sense - was literally hijacked and transmogrified into a Sentimentality by the Power Elite.  And the Heart of Sentimentality is the desire to hear the tune without paying the Piper. Well, like any idea that ends up producing more than was intended, this very bad idea (bad from the start because it was a sentimental distortion of a very good idea) has produced WAY more than anyone ever anticipated. No one really wants to say it (I mean Whites) but the fact is there are only two things to do.  Fight or get the hell out of the way.</p>

			<p>The wholesale conflagation of all that is American-and Western-and White culture has proceeded with such whirlwind speed, it is simply astonishing. In every corner of this land-anywhere there are greedy employers, deluded, arrogant socialist reformers, or welfare benefits to be had, THERE, in that place, no matter how remote, will descend hordes of third world colonists. But in most places, it&rsquo;s already happened. <br>
Wow, I never imagined, growing up in the 1970s and 80s, that such a senseless, evil thing could be brought on American whites-by themselves. The boundlesness of White stupidity and maliciousness is breathtaking. Fratricide!<br>

Regrettably, displaced person this is the future our privileged elite has planned for America. As both McCain and Obama support the disenfranchisement, we are in deep trouble. A violent, poverty ridden, racially divided Brazil del Norte is our immediate future. All whites will soon be DPs in America. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Now the untutored throngs are at the gates of Nantucket, in Yankeedom. These same northerners who sat back and allowed the South to have this shoved down their throats and smugly assured themselves that forced desegregation would never, ever find its way to their section of the nation. It took a few decades but here it is. Let&rsquo;s see how &ldquo;tolerant&rdquo; these New England yankees deal with it. And I, as a Southerner, will sit back and watch.&#8221;</p>

While I agree with you in spirit, I think that instead of indulging in such non-productive Schadenfreude which serves only to divide us, we should be supporting each other. The War Between The States should never have been fought (although I&rsquo;m one of those who think that slavery was one of the minor issues).  Once independent from England, measures should have been taken to repatriate all the slaves. We failed to do that and we&rsquo;re ALL reaping the disastrous results of that period&rsquo;s leaders&rsquo; economic and social shortsightedness. It wasn&rsquo;t worth the free labor. Europe is now learning that same lesson.  We are now headed toward a REAL &#8221; UnCivil War&#8221; and taking pot shots at each other is not what we need now. </p>

People in california could start their own volunteer organizations that send illegal immigrant criminal gang-bangers from El salvador to massachusetts. If you think i&rsquo;m joking your wrong. I seriously think volunteer organizations should form in california in order to send illegal immigrants to massachusetts and these organizations should present themselves to the public as being purely benevolent whose sole concern is the well being of illegal aliens.<br>

<p>This can be easily and cheaply done. </p>
<p>Just go to a mexican radio station and purchase radio spots that say &#8220;massachusetts, massachusetts, welfare paradise and good jobs&#8221;, in spanglish.  The aliens will find the place on their own and the charter bus companies will get them there.   </p>

			<p>   Finally! Maybe Ted Kennedy will get to reap the benefits of his actions for once. Maybe they will mug his family, or carjack his limo. Maybe &#8220;force date&#8221; his kids or grandkids. I&rsquo;m sorry, but the root of all the diversity evil lies with Ted Kennedy and his ilk. I DO NOT feel sorry for him nor the idiots who keep re-electing him. Maybe they will finally get what they deserve. Kennedy was the &#8220;frontman&#8221;. Then let him be in the forefront to receive the rewards. I can honestly say, this article did my heart good. I will enjoy my breakfast now. BTW, I would sure like to see how Teddy spins this to all the new and upcoming victims in his state.  Hahahahahahha, there really is a God.</p>

My wife and I live in a Phoenix subdivision where houses cost $450,000-600,000 and there&rsquo;s more than a few latinos living here.  My parents are from Western NC and my father passed away recently leaving me 40 acres of land in his will.  We&rsquo;re seriously considering building a house there and moving from AZ.  I&rsquo;m waiting to see if these new state laws have any effect on the illegal population.  I hear in the news that many are leaving although I really don&rsquo;t see any appreciable difference with my own eyes.  My kids are almost school age and I don&rsquo;t want to bring them up in this kind of environment. </p>

<p> What you say may be true, but nobody put a gun to Kennedy&rsquo;s head. He CHOSE to go along with this. He lent his name, prestige and political weight to ensuring the bill passed. Also I see nothing to suggest the senator in any way regrets what he did or gives two hoots about the consequences of his actions to ordinary Americans.  Google THE STORY BEHIND KENNEDY&rsquo;S SURGERY by Lawrence K. Altman for a glimpse into the unearned life of privilege the senator enjoys.</p>

What a bunch of bull!! Now if YOU were to go to a black town and were treated very, very,VERY racist[I know it&rsquo;s hard to imagine blacks being racist, but work with me!], would&rsquo;nt you go elsewhere?? Let ME go to Detroit, get a job driving a city bus[yeah right, I would have a better chance of winning the lotto],and see how long it would be before I was assaulted or killed</p>

According to journalist Mr. David Abel, this was just another harmless &#8220;youth&#8221; who was injured by brutal, biased cops.  Another kid (white) would have just moved his bike. End of story. No problem. When a cop tells you to move your bike, you move your bike and you don&rsquo;t give him any lip. There would have been no argument about race injected into it  (the usual black excuse for everything).  </p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s got to be more to it than this.  There had to be a physical confrontation. And it had to be pretty violent. The town&rsquo;s entire complement of 16 officers (!!!)  would have not been called for backup if it were just an argument with a harmless 13-year old.  Come on!  Nor would a shoulder have gotten dislocated;  nor would arrests have been made. Not for an argument!   And no mention here of any injuries to cops. (??)  Just more media bias!  Thanks for another slanted newspaper story, Mr. Abel.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;the Police Department announced it was implementing sweeping changes after a 300-page internal affairs report found that an officer used excessive force in an incident last summer involving eight black youths.  The department  is reorganizing its command staff and requiring that officers undergo diversity training and improved training &hellip;.&#8221; </i></p>
<p>PS.  This kid&rsquo;s family will connect nicely on this. The whole town will pay. And an officer&rsquo;s career will be ruined.</p>

<p>Believe me, I&rsquo;m on your side.  Reconstruction was to the South what the Versailles Treaty was to the Germans. <br>
Segregation was the right way to go. You can&rsquo;t put two races together that don&rsquo;t share the same values, especially in the case of so many Blacks who have NO values. <br>
I think that Taurus689 is saying that we are already in a state of undeclared war and we need to stop dwelling on the actions of those who preceded us. We&rsquo;ve got to move on and work together to take back our country. If the majority of the population of the Northern states had forseen what today&rsquo;s society would look like, the Civil War would either never have been fought or if it has been, the Confederacy would have included a much larger number of the then existing states.<br>
