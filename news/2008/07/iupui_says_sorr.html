<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>A janitor whom a university official had accused of racial harassment for reading a historical book about the Ku Klux Klan on his break has gotten an apology &mdash; months later &mdash; from the school.</p>
<p>Charles Bantz, chancellor at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, apologized to Keith John Sampson in a letter dated Friday, saying the school is committed to free expression.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sampson&rsquo;s troubles began last year when a co-worker complained after seeing him reading a book titled &#8220;Notre Dame vs. the Klan: How the Fighting Irish Defeated the Ku Klux Klan.&#8221;</p>
<p>The book&rsquo;s cover features white-robed Klansmen and burning crosses against a backdrop of Notre Dame&rsquo;s campus. It recounts a 1924 riot between Notre Dame students and the Klan in which the students from the Catholic university prevailed.</p>
<p>Sampson, a 58-year-old white janitor and student majoring in communication studies, said he tried to explain that the book was a historical account.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Sampson says his union official likened the book to bringing pornography to work, and the school&rsquo;s affirmative action officer in November told Sampson his conduct constituted racial harassment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Civil liberties groups and bloggers who took up his cause said Sampson had been wrongly cited for reading a book that is carried by the school&rsquo;s library.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>IUPUI in February informed Sampson no disciplinary action would be taken because the affirmative action office was unable to determine whether his conduct was intended to disrupt the work environment.</p>
<p>&#8220;My prior letter was not meant to imply that it is impermissible for you or to limit your ability to read scholarly books or other such literature during break times,&#8221; wrote Charleston, who has since retired, in a second letter. &#8220;There is no university policy that prohibits reading such materials on break time.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;By first finding Sampson guilty of racial harassment simply for reading a book in the break room, then refusing to admit the gross impropriety of such a finding, IUPUI makes a mockery of its legal and moral obligations as a public institution of higher learning,&#8221; wrote Adam Kissel, director of [Foundation for Individual Rights in Education&rsquo;s] Individual Rights Defense Program.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Bantz didn&rsquo;t apologize to Sampson until last week, after a column in The Wall Street Journal sparked renewed criticism. Bantz also wrote to the others involved in the incident, including the co-worker who filed the complaint, said IUPUI spokesman Rich Schneider.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sampson, who still works for the school, said that he accepts the university&rsquo;s apology but that he was hurt by the allegations and has not enjoyed being in the spotlight.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

			<p>The moral of this story is that no one defended this man until the media got involved. It&rsquo;s the media that has the upper hand. That&rsquo;s good news for whites. What a relief. </p>

			<p>From the obvious lack of intelligence, its pretty clear the Affirmative Action officer was an Affirmative Action hire.  Just giggle when you think, she thinks shes doing something grand.</p>

<p>Yes, they just became committed to free speech when they discovered the world was informed of their obvious bias and curtailment of individual liberty.</p>
<p>How nice it was for them before the internet, when they could do something similar without any concern for being criticized for not doing the right thing.</p>

			<p>That man&rsquo;s lawyer should file a  law suit&hellip;then he won&rsquo;t have to be a janitor anymore&hellip;the man has been not only disrespected, but harrassed, embarrased&hellip;.and suffered mentally at the hands of the morons in charge&hellip;.and in the end they didn&rsquo;t even give the man a raise????? Maybe cause he is white and not a latino, black or muslim&hellip;..I call what they did to him a hate crime and total racism on the schools part, don&rsquo;t you?</p>

<p>Complete nonsense.  They only retracted the charge because the absurdity was becomming apparent to even the brain-dead diversicrats.  The school carries the book in their library.  Can it get more absurd. <br>

			<p>This man could easily persuade a conservative Indiana jury that he has suffered harrassment, slander, discrimination, and the intentional infliction of emotional distress.  If I were his lawyer, I could probably retire after this one.</p>

			<p>Typical. The man is harassed and harried by the PC police and instead of getting angry and taking action, he just wants everybody to know that he&rsquo;s &#8220;not the kind of person that they were painting&#8221; him as. Despicable.</p>

			<p>Was this apology tendered with the same public rancor as the initial complaint?? or as usual, the apology delivered in a dark phone booth, on a dark street, in the middle of the night. And another poster is correct, he should have sued the bonuses out of the school, he could be comfortably retired now. IDIOT!</p>

			<p>The possibility of &#8220;offending&#8221; any black person apparently now trumps the Constitution.   The AFFIRMATIVE ACTION officer told Sampson this: </p>
<p> &#8220;You used extremely poor judgment by insisting on openly reading the book related to a historically and racially abhorrent subject in the presence of your black co-workers,&#8221; Lillian Charleston wrote in a letter to Sampson.</p>
<p>It has not gotten to the point where white folks have to walk on egg shells for fear that they might offend or upset some poor black person.</p>
<p>AND, it seems that most of the universities are setting these standards.   Blacks now seem to believe that they are justified in taking any action they want if they are &#8220;offended.&#8221;  There have been quite a few cases where black students have destroyed the comlete run of  conservative campus newpapers  because of some conservative articles they did not agree with were printed in the papers.</p>
<p>Blacks love the victim role and will go way out of their way to be offended.</p>

			<p>Please sue, Mr. Sampson. Please, please, please sue the pants off these people.</p>
<p>Are there any lawyers out there who will lead the way for racial justice and maintaining our constitutional rights?  It should be easy; all he was doing was reading a book!</p>
<p>Somebody out there please step up, step off the White Privilege Plantation, and contact this man.  I would be willing to send a donation to the cause.  </p>

			<p>I agree that this individuals should file a lawsuit. That is how the left has advanced their agenda so we should play by their rules. If PC was ultimately responsible for costing this university millions of dollars, that might get their attention.</p>

			<p>Wow.  I can&rsquo;t believe I never heard of this, considering I live in Indianapolis.  Anyways, this doesn&rsquo;t surprise me, since I used to go to this school and they have an anal obsession about diversity.</p>
<p>The scary thing about this school is that a year or two ago, the black student union tried to have a building only for black students at this school built.  It&rsquo;s bad enough that they can have a &#8220;black union&#8221;, yet they demanded a building payed for by the taxpayers (IUPUI is a public university) so only blacks can do whatever they want.</p>
