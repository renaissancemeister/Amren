<p>[Floyd] Mayweather, a 31-year-old former Olympic bronze medalist from Grand Rapids, told The Grand Rapids Press in an interview Friday that the network &#8220;is great,&#8221; but criticized its boxing announcers.</p>
<p>&#8220;They talk about Kelly Pavlik, a white fighter, like he&rsquo;s the second coming. Or they go crazy over Manny Pacquiao. But I&rsquo;m a black fighter,&#8221; Mayweather said. &#8220;Is it racial? Absolutely. They praise white fighters, they praise Hispanic fighters, whatever. But black fighters, they never praise.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>HBO Sports president Ross Greenburg said in a statement that the network, which has carried many of Mayweather&rsquo;s fights, was disappointed to hear of the boxer&rsquo;s remarks and denied his claims.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mayweather gave the interview on the first day of a three-day retirement celebration in downtown Grand Rapids. Boxing&rsquo;s pound-for-pound king abruptly retired last month at the peak of his athletic skill and earning power.</p>

			<p>When the 4th or 5th White Russian boxer won the title belts, Max Kellerman stood Lenox Lewis up in front of the cameras and proclaimed that white boxers weren&rsquo;t what a champion looked like and that a champion looked like Lenox Lewis!</p>
<p>Is HBO racist? Yes! They are racist towards White boxing champions that still have the brains to put together a coherent sentence without adding &#8220;you know what I&rsquo;m saying&#8221; behind every third word!!!!! </p>

			<p>URGENT TIM MC HUGH MEMORANDUM  Forget all that boxing stuff and just listen!! Who has seen the new HBO Special, Hard Times A Year in the Life of Fredrick Douglass High School? Oh my God! Watch it and then read about what others think on the web. Where do I begin?<br>
 I was tuned in right at the part where the where the young idealistic White male teacher is picking up his possesions and leaving  this Baltimore Dodge City after one semester. Oh God it was sweet. The definition of Skedaddle came right to mind. He told of the futility of working on a lesson plan for six hours only to have it sidetracked by children who didn`t have the intellegence or self control to even sit down and shut their mouths. He said he needed a spark, a mere spark to keep going&hellip; And then tells the listener there isn`t a spark of light, much less decency in the whole school.<br>
 I sat there and whistled low. Whoever made this documentary didn`t know the truth they were unleashing. Many of the comments you will read later bear this out. Another  disturbing scene was the boy punching girls in the face full on in the hallway. <br>
 The two scenes that struck me most were these. In one, a black, intelligent and articulate  &#8220;Cool&#8221; looking mentor talks to the basketball team about college. The look of fear and self doubt on the boys faces spoke volumes. What really floored me was when they flashed to the security guard who was in the locker room also. His face said he knew the boys would never make it and that  the more intelligent mentor couldn`t figure it out.  The other scene is when the kids go to take the end of year assesment test. First the narrator talks about how every program is hinged to this information needed by the district to help the next batch of kids. And how they prep all year. But the kids do not need it to graduate until 2009 by judicial fiat. So the kids walk in, fold the booklets back up and go to sleep on it. Right in front of the teachers that worked so hard for this one day. Unbelievable! Anyway watch it. It brings into clear focus what you read about here all day long. I just can`t figure out how it made the light of day&hellip;<br>

			<p>Boxers get praise when they win, or when they lose after an extremely dogged defense that looked close on points.  Boxers do not get praise for being crybabies (or for ear-biting).</p>
<p>Boiled down, they&rsquo;re not in the ring to be idolized, anyway.  They&rsquo;re there to get beat up, and to beat up folks, and make some money.  My paternal grandfather, William Scott fought fourteen professional fights, won eight, and lost six.  His nose was broken in the last one, and since he figured he had better things to do than get paid to have his nose broken, he went to work in a steel mill and eventually married his foreman&rsquo;s sister.</p>
<p>Mayweather retired at his peak.  If he didn&rsquo;t blow his money, he&rsquo;s set for life.  He can laugh about all the praise he thought he needed someday when he&rsquo;s fishing off the back of his boat and hooks a mako or a swordfish that will give him a real fight, with no bell at the end of each &#8220;round&#8221;.</p>

I don&rsquo;t follow the sport but when asked to name boxers, the first three that come to mind are Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, and &#8220;Sugar&#8221; Ray Leonard.</p>
<p>If pressed for a white boxer, Rocky Graziano.</p>
<p>If there are other great white boxers, they definitely don&rsquo;t get enough press for me to be aware of them.<br>

But I&rsquo;m a black fighter,&rdquo; Mayweather said. &ldquo;Is it racial? Absolutely. They praise white fighters, they praise Hispanic fighters, whatever. But black fighters, they never praise.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a good example of what people mean when they say that blacks are so self-centered and racist they perceive anything not constantly highlighting them as great without let up as racism.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t it the same throughout society?  I mean, we hear the same thing from all black quarters.  Nothing is ever good enough for them.  They always believe that whites never laud or praise them enough.</p>
<p>Much of this is self-centeredness, but a lot of it is just the same old black arrogance.  They accomplish just a little bit, and unfailingly regard themselves as being godlike images.</p>
<p>Whites will be forever cursed unless they can rid themselves of these primitives and their low intellects and huge egos. </p>
<p>So many of them whine about this country and the unjustness they receive, but not one, nary a one, is ready to move to Africa to be where they really belong, away from the white devil they hate so much.</p>

			<p>Strangely, I have some sympathy for Mayweather&rsquo;s comments.  I well remember the gushingly effusive praise for the rarely seen white man Gerry Cooney that went on for the whole bout until Larry Holmes cold-cocked him in (as I recall) the 12th round. And Holmes was in no trouble whatever throughout the bout.</p>

			<p>What we need is more ethnic cheerleading!  A couple years back, Sports Illustrated name Muhammed Ali the greatest sportsman of the 20th century  &mdash;  -maybe he was the best boxer/fighter, but hardly a sportsman. I let my SI sub expire. I think Mayweather suffers from an inferiority complex (rightly so) and needs somebody to give him a boost.<br>

			<p> The fact is that boxing is dying. Mixed martial arts is kicking its ass (sorry for the stupid pun). There are no compelling personalities in boxing like there used to be. No interest being generated. MMA, on the other hand, is chock full of intersting and compelling figures. Have you ever heard an interview with Forrest Griffin? The guy is hilarious. He could walk on any interview show and crack them up. Chuck Liddell, Randy Coture, Uriah Faber, Matt Hughes, BJ Penn, Rampage Jackson (who is also hilarious), John Fitch. Few if any MMA fighters are the loud obnoxious self-promoting ghetto roosters that populate boxing today. Most are articulate, soft spoken and interesting.<br>
  THAT is what it takes to sell a sport nowdays. Pure ability isnt enough any more. Half of these black boxers cant even communicate in english. They sound like stereotypical punching bags. Nobody outside of the ghetto digs that. <br>

<p>I always like to compare the off-the-field sportsmanship of Muhammed Ali to that of baseball player John Rocker.</p>
<p>The difference being, Ali stood for things many times more hateful than John Rocker. And of course, the way the media treated the two. </p>

			<p>Mayweather&rsquo;s net worth is somewhere around 150 million. Apparently, racism hasn&rsquo;t stopped him from achieving his dream and living a life we can only imagine. Every time one of these millionaire/celebrity blacks whines about racism it proves to white people that it&rsquo;s only a tactic to relieve themselves of responsibility for something.  </p>

			<p>Mr. Mayweather has obviously taken too many hard blows to the head. When was the last time anyone saw any black on any tv show, who didn&rsquo;t mention, or have mentioned, their race in less than thirty seconds. I for one am certainly glad they do this, otherwise one would quite possibly not realize they were black. </p>

Posted by john at 10:18 PM on July 7 </p>
<p>The Cooney/Holmes fight was a closely-contested fight that was decided in the final round with Holmes getting a close decision.  I saw the rerun not long ago, and, as Howard Cossell said, &#8220;That fight was a lot closer than people are aware of.&#8221;  </p>
<p>And indeed it was. I&rsquo;m pretty sure if Cooney hadn&rsquo;t faded away instead of continuing to compete, and  got a few more fights under his belt, he would have beaten Holmes, probably by knockout.  He was bigger, stronger and and had much harder punching power than Holmes.</p>
<p>Cooney wanted to be an undefeated champ and became discouraged from continuing his ring career as a comback contender.  As a result, whites had to wait until just a few years ago to once again have white fighting champions as we do now.  Our ranks had to be infused with Europeans and other whites who still had the drive and hunger to excel in the sport, as white Americans once did in America years ago.</p>
<p>Many champions and contenders are now white, and if there is any kind of lid placed on lauding individual ability by the msm it is the one used to submerge white accomplishment.  No one even knows of the magnificent whites we have today in the sport nor do they know that Heavyweight champ Vladimir Klitschko has a doctorate in sports science and philosophy from the university of Kiev.  At one time his plans were to go to medical school and become a doctor, but instead opted for boxing. Tall, handsome and intelligent, this man is far superor to the brutish-looking blacks who are near-imbeciles and barely literate, if literate at all, who inundate the sport.</p>

			<p>It may be true that black boxers don&rsquo;t get as much praise.</p>
<p>Blacks in America are athletically superior, due to selective breeding when they were slaves   &mdash;   again, another reason they should thank whites.  They should thank us for all their success in sports now.  Moreover, boxing is a violent sport and blacks are already more violent than everyone else.  </p>
<p>Thus, why should they get praise for their genetics and primitive nature?  Whites and others who excel at the sport should be praised more; they have to train harder and develop a mindset that comes naturally to blacks.  Blacks like Mayweather should be happy that he&rsquo;s become rich by doing an activity   &mdash;   fighting   &mdash;   that he&rsquo;d be doing on the streets anyway.  White people have given him millions of dollars, and he should be satisfied with that.</p>

<p>Very true. If Obama loses, America will be called &#8216;racist&rsquo; by blacks - and not just those who voted for McCain, but every white American.</p>
<p>And if he wins? Well then continued &#8216;inequality&rsquo; among blacks will be the evidence of hidden &#8216;racism&rsquo;. They will assume that whites are resisting even the power of a black president with their hidden racism in order to keep blacks down.</p>
<p>And this ideology, sooner or later, is going to be used violently against whites.</p>

			<p>While there may very well be some talented Black boxers who never received &#8220;their shot&#8221; due to their skin color (or more specifically, their inability to connect with a White, middle class advertising target,)Floyd Mayweater Jr. isn&rsquo;t one of them. </p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;d be curious to see how many boxers of any color have received more HBO paychecks than Floyd Mayweather Jr.</p>
<p>He is a talented fighter who has beaten some of the best, but he is not a particularly explosive fighter who has a lot of power and takes the risks that make boxing fun to watch. When you watch a Mayweather fight you will get a disciplined fight and a methodical one that&rsquo;s strong in technique but weak in excitement.</p>
<p>However, Mayweather&rsquo;s whining that he&rsquo;s not being supported by the HBO commentators reminds me of Michael Jackson blaming his last album debacle on a record industry that is hostile to upcoming Black talent. </p>
<p>Are there any other industries that have created more Black superstars than sports and music?</p>

There is a really great beer commercial where just such a loudmouth gets his face smashed in by a low-key White boxer. You can find it on YOUTUBE. My favourite commercial.</p>

			<p>   It would be difficult to find a more self-absorbed and selfish jerk anywhere on the face of the earth. Throughout his career, he has constantly moaned about how little he was being paid and how little attention was being given to him. In spite of his tremendous boxing talent, boxing writers have hesitated to follow his fights because of his attitude. A few years ago, HBO offered him a lucrative contract for three fights. His response was to refer to  the contract as &#8220;slave wages.&#8221;<br>
   In his personal life a few years ago, he was ducking the legal process after charges were filed against him for battering two of his girlfriends. He seems to have been traveling around with three lawyers all the time. I would like to know know how those  cases turned out. <br>
    Mayweather is still another example of a sports figure that fans will pay obscene amounts of money to watch regardless of the  type of person he is outside of sports. How much time and money  has he really spent in helping people in need? I would say precious little.  <br>
    I am curious of his &#8220;intellectual&#8221; achievements. It took the guy years to learn a little about how to promote himself. Eventually, he was able to get enough attention from the media in order to make  megabucks in his De La Hoya and Hatton fights. I wonder what kind of grade school and high school student he was.<br>
    Maybe Michelle Obama is a Mayweather fan. She seems to be trying to duplicate his constant moaning and never feeling he was being treated fairly. If Barack&rsquo;s comment about his wife being smarter than he is true, we are in serious trouble.</p>

			<p>Larry Holmes said nobody ever hit him as hard as Gerry Cooney.</p>
<p>Besides, all the heavyweight champs are white now anyway.</p>

			<p>Mayweather&rsquo;s net worth is somewhere around 150 million. Apparently, racism hasn&rsquo;t stopped him from achieving his dream and living a life we can only imagine. Every time one of these millionaire/celebrity blacks whines about racism it proves to white people that it&rsquo;s only a tactic to relieve themselves of responsibility for something. </p>
<p>I just love the humanities stories where hugely successful blacks raise poor blacks up and help them. Does anyone know of one??</p>

			<p>Holmes was one of the guests on an after fight evaluation on cable t.v. a short while back, and I was surprised to notice that he appeared to sound punch drunk with a higher than normal voice, sounding as if he were talking through his nose.</p>

			<p>     I absolutely agree with MayweatherJr. regarding HBO&rsquo;s bias coverage. Some of it appears to be race based and other aspects of the commentary is based on if they like the fighters personality or not. Larry merchant is one of the primary culprits of bias commentating.<br>
     I have a Masters Degree in Communications, and I am a huge boxing fan. And I recall several fights when the commentary favored a particular fighter and totally ignored what he was doing to his oppenent.<br>
     Racism could be one element but favoritism from one fighter to the next is crazy obvious. It&rsquo;s like they are watching different fights at times. Max Kellerman is a breath of fresh air. I believe professional announcers should have an obligatio to be objective.</p>

<p>Mayweather wasn&rsquo;t talking about bias in general, he was whining about bias against blacks which is not only non-existent it is the reverse, because most all of the commentary favor these black crybabies.</p>
<p>Blacks prove every day in every way that they&rsquo;re about the lowest class of citizens this country has&hellip;&hellip;bar none.</p>
