<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Toddlers who turn their noses up at spicy food from overseas could be branded racists by a Government-sponsored agency.</p>
<p>The National Children&rsquo;s Bureau, which receives Â£12 million a year, mainly from Government funded organisations, has issued guidance to play leaders and nursery teachers advising them to be alert for racist incidents among youngsters in their care.</p>
<p>This could include a child of as young as three who says &#8220;yuk&#8221; in response to being served unfamiliar foreign food.</p>
<p>The guidance by the NCB is designed to draw attention to potentially-racist attitudes in youngsters from a young age.</p>
<p>It alerts playgroup leaders that even babies can not be ignored in the drive to root out prejudice as they can &#8220;recognise different people in their lives&#8221;.</p>
<p>The 366-page guide for staff in charge of pre-school children, called Young Children and Racial Justice, warns: &#8220;Racist incidents among children in early years settings tend to be around name-calling, casual thoughtless comments and peer group relationships.&#8221;</p>
<p>It advises nursery teachers to be on the alert for childish abuse such as: &#8220;blackie&#8221;, &#8220;Pakis&#8221;, &#8220;those people&#8221; or &#8220;they smell&#8221;.</p>
<p>The guide goes on to warn that children might also &#8220;react negatively to a culinary tradition other than their own by saying &lsquo;yuk&rsquo;&#8221;.</p>
<p>Staff are told: &#8220;No racist incident should be ignored. When there is a clear racist incident, it is necessary to be specific in condemning the action.&#8221;</p>
<p>Warning that failing to pick children up on their racist attitudes could instil prejudice, the NCB adds that if children &#8220;reveal negative attitudes, the lack of censure may indicate to the child that there is nothing unacceptable about such attitudes&#8221;.</p>
<p>Nurseries are encouraged to report as many incidents as possible to their local council. The guide added: &#8220;Some people think that if a large number of racist incidents are reported, this will reflect badly on the institution. In fact, the opposite is the case.&#8221;<br>
