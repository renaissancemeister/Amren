<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>State crime lab analyst Kathryn Troyer was running tests on Arizona&rsquo;s DNA database when she stumbled across two felons with remarkably similar genetic profiles.</p>
<p>The men matched at nine of the 13 locations on chromosomes, or loci, commonly used to distinguish people.</p>
<p>The FBI estimated the odds of unrelated people sharing those genetic markers to be as remote as 1 in 113 billion. But the mug shots of the two felons suggested that they were not related: One was black, the other white.</p>
<p>In the years after her 2001 discovery, Troyer found dozens of similar matches &mdash; each seeming to defy impossible odds.</p>
<p>As word spread, these findings by a little-known lab worker raised questions about the accuracy of the FBI&rsquo;s DNA statistics and ignited a legal fight over whether the nation&rsquo;s genetic databases ought to be opened to wider scrutiny.</p>
<p>The FBI laboratory, which administers the national DNA database system, tried to stop distribution of Troyer&rsquo;s results and began an aggressive behind-the-scenes campaign to block similar searches elsewhere, even those ordered by courts, a Times investigation found.</p>
<p>At stake is the credibility of the compelling odds often cited in DNA cases, which can suggest an all but certain link between a suspect and a crime scene.</p>
<p>When DNA from such clues as blood or skin cells matches a suspect&rsquo;s genetic profile, it can seal his fate with a jury, even in the absence of other evidence. As questions arise about the reliability of ballistic, bite-mark and even fingerprint analysis, genetic evidence has emerged as the forensic gold standard, often portrayed in courtrooms as unassailable.</p>
<p>But DNA &#8220;matches&#8221; are not always what they appear to be. Although a person&rsquo;s genetic makeup is unique, his genetic profile &mdash; just a tiny sliver of the full genome &mdash; may not be. Siblings often share genetic markers at several locations, and even unrelated people can share some by coincidence.</p>
<p>No one knows precisely how rare DNA profiles are. The odds presented in court are the FBI&rsquo;s best estimates.</p>
<p>The Arizona search was, in effect, the first test of those estimates in a large state database, and the results were surprising, even to some experts.</p>
<p>Defense attorneys seized on the Arizona discoveries as evidence that genetic profiles match more often than the official statistics imply &mdash; and are far from unique, as the FBI has sometimes suggested.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Indeed, experts generally agree that most &mdash; but not all &mdash; of the Arizona matches were to be expected statistically because of the unusual way Troyer searched for them.</p>
<p>In a typical criminal case, investigators look for matches to a specific profile. But the Arizona search looked for any matches among all the thousands of profiles in the database, greatly increasing the odds of finding them.</p>
<p>As a result, Thomas Callaghan, head of the FBI&rsquo;s CODIS unit, has dismissed Troyer&rsquo;s findings as &#8220;misleading&#8221; and &#8220;meaningless.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Concerned about errors</p>
<p>From her first discovery in 2001, Troyer and her colleagues in the Arizona Department of Public Safety&rsquo;s Phoenix DNA lab were intrigued.</p>
<p>At the time, many states looked at only nine or fewer loci when searching for suspects. (States now commonly attempt to compare 13 loci, though often fewer are available from old or contaminated crime scene evidence.)</p>
<p>Based on Troyer&rsquo;s results, she and her colleagues believed that a nine-locus match could point investigators to the wrong person.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Bruce Budowle, an FBI scientist who specializes in forensic DNA, told colleagues of Troyer that such coincidental matches were to be expected.</p>
<p>Three years later, Bicka Barlow, a San Francisco defense attorney, came across a description of Troyer&rsquo;s poster on the Internet.</p>
<p>Its implications became clear as she prepared to defend a client accused of a 20-year-old rape and murder.</p>
<p>A database search had found a nine-locus match between his DNA profile and semen found in the victim&rsquo;s body. Based on FBI estimates, the prosecutor said the odds of a coincidental match were as remote as 1 in 108 trillion.</p>
<p>Recalling the Arizona discovery, Barlow wondered if there might be similar coincidental matches in California&rsquo;s database &mdash; the world&rsquo;s third-largest, with 360,000 DNA profiles at the time. The attorney called Troyer in Phoenix to learn more.</p>
<p>Troyer seemed eager to talk about her discovery, which still had her puzzled, Barlow recalled. The analyst told Barlow she had searched the growing Arizona database since the conference and found more pairs of profiles matching at nine and even 10 loci.</p>
<p>Encouraged, Barlow subpoenaed a new search of the Arizona database. Among about 65,000 felons, there were 122 pairs that matched at nine of 13 loci. Twenty pairs matched at 10 loci. One matched at 11 and one at 12, though both later proved to belong to relatives.</p>
<p>Barlow was stunned. At the time, such matches were almost unheard of.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Arizona officials obtained a court order to prevent Barlow from sharing the results with anyone else.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Soon, defense lawyers in other states were seeking what came to be known as &#8220;Arizona searches.&#8221;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t panic&rsquo;</p>
<p>For years, DNA&rsquo;s strength in the courtroom has been the brute power of its numbers. It&rsquo;s hard to argue with odds like 1 in 100 billion.</p>
<p>Troyer&rsquo;s discovery threatened to turn the tables on prosecutors. At first blush, the Arizona matches appeared to contradict those statistics and the popular notion that DNA profiles, like DNA, were essentially unique.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many of the Arizona matches were predictable, Myers [Steven Myers, a senior DNA analyst at the California Department of Justice] said, given the type of search Troyer had conducted.</p>
<p>In a database search for a criminal case, a crime scene sample would have been compared to every profile in the database &mdash; about 65,000 comparisons. But Troyer compared all 65,000 profiles in Arizona&rsquo;s database to each other, resulting in about 2 billion comparisons. Each comparison made it more likely she would find a match.</p>
<p>When this &#8220;database effect&#8221; was considered, about 100 of the 144 matches Troyer had found were to be expected statistically, Myers found.</p>
<p>Troyer&rsquo;s search also looked for matches at any of 13 genetic locations, while in a real criminal case the analyst would look for a particular profile &mdash; making a match far less likely.</p>
<p>Further, any nonmatching markers would immediately rule out a suspect. In the case of the black and white men who matched at nine loci, the four loci that differed &mdash; if available from crime scene evidence &mdash; would have ensured that the wrong man was not implicated.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some scientists are not satisfied by any of these explanations. They wonder whether Troyer&rsquo;s findings signal flaws in the complex assumptions that underlie the FBI&rsquo;s rarity estimates.</p>

			<p>In the case mentioned&hellip;maybe they are closely related&hellip;you know&hellip;.&#8221;baby daddy&#8221; thingy they got going&hellip;..could be, but DNA is very good, I would stake my life on those tests but only if they are done by a smart, white, college grad&hellip;none of those who get the jobs in those labs cause they are black, mex, muslim, indian or whatevre other color&hellip;..know what I mean?</p>

			<p>&ldquo;The men matched at nine of the 13 locations on chromosomes, or loci, commonly used to distinguish people&hellip; . The FBI estimated the odds of unrelated people sharing those genetic markers to be as remote as 1 in 113 billion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The key phrase here is &ldquo;as remote as,&rdquo; which indicates that such odds are the maximum remoteness that a given profile can have for a match within the world&rsquo;s population.  A given profile could have a much greater likelihood of a match.  (The precise likelihood could and should be disclosed at trial.)</p>
<p>Say each locus has 7 possible states, and that each state of each loci is equally likely.  The likelihood of a match on any give locus would be 1 in 7.  The likelihood of matching all 13 loci would be (1/7)^13, or about 1 in 97 billion – regardless of the state of each locus.</p>
<p>Now say that some or all of the loci have fewer than 7 states, but that the least likely state of each locus has a likelihood of 1 in 7, and that the other possible states are each more likely than that.  We could correctly announce that the odds of a match could be as remote as 1 in 97 billion.  But say however that we had an individual whose profile was not this extreme.  Say that each of his loci was in a state that had a 1 in 2 likelihood match with the general population.  In this case, the odds of match would be (1/2)^13, or 1 in 8,192.</p>
<p>When you compare the profiles of 65,000 felons with each other, you are making 2.1 billion comparisons.  The field of possible suspects in any given investigation is an almost infinitesimal fraction of that.  It&rsquo;s a testimonial to the power of DNA analysis that Miss Troyer did not announce any 13-point matches.</p>
<p>Also consider that she found 122 nine-point matches and 13 ten-point matches.  Given my above analysis scenario, we would expect at least 52 nine-point matches and 7 ten-point matches, which are within a factor of 2.5 of what Troyer observed.  Bear in mind that there may be correlations between  certain genetic markers and criminality that could account for the fact that Troyer observed more matches than I would have predicted as a minimum.  That is, certain genetic markers could be more prominent among criminals than within the total population.</p>
<p>My analysis simply assumes that the likelihood of a given state in a given locus is independent of the states of the other loci.  But even if this is not the case, the basic principals of the above analysis still apply.</p>

			<p>Of course, the article does not mention the fact that DNA evidence plays only a minor role in convicting people.  You almost never see just the DNA evidence.  It&rsquo;s always the DNA evidence plus a boatload of other evidence.  Without that other evidence (and often, even with it) a conviction is unlikely.</p>
<p>For example, the OJ Simpson case is famous for more than just the media hype.  Specifically, it is famous for having the strongest DNA evidence of any case ever tried in a court of law, up to that point.</p>
<p>And OJ walked.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m curious to see if it ever comes about that DNA will be downgraded from 99.9% accurate to a figure much higher such as 95% accurate? Just like the Sacred Lie Detector, if it says you are Guilty it&rsquo;s 100% and can be used in curt against you. If it comes back your not guilty it can&rsquo;t be used in court. What thinking person would ever subject themselves to a lie e detector? Their machine, their purported expect, their criteria.. </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;d like to see a photo of this allegeged &#8220;white&#8221; subject.  It may be comparable to the story last week about the black baby and white baby born to the interracial couple in Germany.  The baby alleged to be white was really brown skinned and black haired while the black baby looked like his mother in every way.</p>

			<p>You know, I always thought the whole police dog/k-9 unit thing was a scam. If they simply want to search someone, &#8216;uhlps, the dog alerted&rsquo;. How do we even know what the &#8216;signal&rsquo; is? How many signals are there? Did the handler misinterpret the signal? Did the handler pull the dogs chain? Does the handler have his own signals he sends out to the dog? Can the dog testify afterward in court?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s possible, however, that even if something is sealed in a solid container, because of the atomic nature of things, a solid object is not as solid as it looks to the eye, and perhaps some odor/particle can escape it. Perhaps Michael Scott will read this and give us his opinion?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still a lot of room for abuse having &#8216;police dogs&rsquo; decided who to search.</p>

<p>You are quite correct in your suspicions. I train dogs as an avocation, and belong to a group that meets weekly to discuss the finer points of treating dogs with behavior problems. Dogs are very astute readers of their handlers&rsquo; body language, sometimes something as small as a change in facial expression (search  &#8220;Clever Hans&#8221; for an example). Due to the chaining of environmental stimuli, the dog may react aggressively ( for instance) to something that cues that behavior minutes before the actual display of behavior. Anecdotally (to illustrate a point; this is not scientific), there&rsquo;s a dog at my club who growls and cowers when I approach while wearing a large, floppy hat. When I take it off, the dog settles right down and allows me to pet her and feed her. This, we figured our, was due to an abusive trainer in the dog&rsquo;s past. </p>
<p>The officers in question may be unconsciously cuing the dog to &#8220;alert.&#8221;</p>

Here in Buffalo, we had a serial rapist and murder dubbed &#8220;The Bike Path Rapist&#8221; who targeted, as far as I know, only white women:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altemio_Sanchez" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altemio_Sanchez</a></p>
<p>Before he was finally caught, they ran a DNA profile and found the proportions of his racial background. When hispanic Altemio Sanchez was caught, the profile was perfect.</p>
<p>My suspicion is that DNA is highly accurate and that&rsquo;s the problem for all the people who argue that our prisons are populated by innocent black men.</p>
<p>This sounds to me nothing more than an attempt to call DNA into question and better the chance of freeing &#8216;innocent&rsquo; black men. If they can us DNA testing to cause juries to doubt DNA accuracy, more criminals go free.</p>
<p>I understand that the Innocence Project who are asked to test DNA more often show results that prove guilt and not innocence.</p>
