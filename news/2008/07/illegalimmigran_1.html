<h1><a href="https://www.cis.org/">Illegal-Immigrant Population Dropping: Significant Decline Since Last Summer</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steven A. Camarota, Center for Immigration Studies, July 30, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A new analysis by the Center for Immigration Studies of monthly data collected by the Census Bureau shows that the illegal immigrant population has declined significantly between last summer and May of this year. The study is the first to find quantitative evidence that illegal immigrants are leaving the country. It also examines the extent to which stepped-up enforcement and the downturn in the economy account for this trend.</p>

			<p>Since they seem to know all these facts, why is it they can&rsquo;t deport them while they are being counted? Just another attempt at brainwashing from the anal retentive left.  Put on yore gum boots, it&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; purty deep. </p>

			<p>Nothing but praise for the efforts and the research by CIS. </p>
<p>&#8220;the illegal immigrant population has declined significantly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reason for optimism? Not near enough, not fast enough. And no reason the trend couldn&rsquo;t reverse at any time. And subjectively, no evidence. The numbers still seem to be increasing. (I live in the Southwest). There&rsquo;s still no fence. Nothing to stop the southward trickle from turning into a flood northward, again, with the next whiff of amnesty or any other magnet. The anchor baby situation is unresolved, and next to id and job theft, remains one of the biggest draws. Still waiting for a criminal employer to lose their assets, their business license and go to prison. Still waiting for the maternity wards, the ER&rsquo;s, the schools, jails and Walmart to show a decline. Still waiting for even one sanctuary city to be addressed.</p>
<p>Good news by the numbers, and 10 percent should be a noticeable improvement. Just wish it were evident here. Personally, I suspect illegals are simply &#8216;on the move&rsquo;, but not homeward. </p>

			<p>I think that the fewer illegals in the country will help the economy.I prefer to patronize any buisness where their is a blond haired blue eyed lady behind the counter.I really think it makes a difference.I would prefer to spend my money when it would benefit my own kind.</p>

			<p>BarJohn McObama have plans to reduce further the illegal immigrant population.  Give them all amnesty, and that way, there will be no more illegal immigrants here.</p>
<p>Beyond that, this proves that the employer raids are forcing many illegals to self-deport.  The Houston Chronicle has an article, claiming that this is some kind of newfangled strategy.</p>

			<p>The Center For Immigration Studies is a trusted organization where immigration matters are concerned, I just didn&rsquo;t read anything on California. Whether other states are experiencing an &#8220;exodus&#8221; I don&rsquo;t know, here in California I haven&rsquo;t seen any such thing. It seems the State gets more and more, endlessly.</p>

			<p>Property rights, states&rsquo; rights and national sovereignty: They share a common theme. My neighbors can&rsquo;t stomp on my grass, the feds can&rsquo;t blackmail states with federal dollars (actually, they can; but they shouldn&rsquo;t) and you can&rsquo;t just come waltzing (or wading) across the Rio Grande.</p>
<p>Now a report says unskilled Hispanic immigrants are heading home. &#8220;Yeah,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Show me the stats.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the Center for Immigration Studies, dot-dot-dot</p>
<p>• The &#8220;illegal immigrant population has declined by 11 percent through May 2008 after hitting a peak in August 2007&#8221; they estimate. </p>
<p>• Where once 12.5 illegals snuck* around the golden plains, &#8220;only&#8221; 11.2 are left.</p>
<p>• For every illegal alien (were talking Hispanics, primarily; not Martians) removed by the government, another seven skipped town on their own volition.</p>
<p>• Legal immigration continues to increase. Could be enforcement is working, the reports concludes. Even before the employment rate got nasty, illegals were heading home. </p>
<p>• If this continues, five years from now only 6.25 illegal aliens will be driving without insurance and giving birth to anchor babies.</p>
<p>• If Obama is elected, the whole thing will reverse. That wasn&rsquo;t in the report, but I thought it was worth the ink. </p>
<p>* Ok, &#8220;sneaked.&#8221;<br>

			<p>&#8220;The evidence indicates that the illegal immigrant population may have declined by over one million in the last year.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our best estimate is that the illegal immigrant population has declined by 11 percent through May 2008 after hitting a peak in August 2007&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>YEAH RIGHT!</p>
<p>CIS used the data from the census CPS (current population survey). This leads me to suspect that the feds are cooking the numbers. </p>
<p>Frankly, I find these numbers hard to believe.</p>
<p>Given that 13-15% of the illegals are non-Hispanic, I could imagine some of them leaving as well. However, the graphs indicate that its Hispanics leaving.</p>
<p>I JUST DON&rsquo;T SEE IT!</p>

Marching in our streets under the Mexican flag put illegals in the cross-hairs. That was a turning point for Americans. They saw these people as they are; arrogant and ungrateful.</p>
<p>By the next rally when they marched under the American flag, it was too late. They shot themselves in the foot and the new bandage couldn&rsquo;t hide the wound.</p>
<p>If they think we&rsquo;re supposed to love and worship them, they can go back to whatever nation they left.</p>

			<p>I do not believe the data.  I see more immigrants in S CA now than ever!! Pregnant immigrants are all over the stores where I shop. Few can speak any English. There is no indication any are leaving.  I think is is just more propaganda to take the heat off. Probably sponsored/funded by Immigrant activists.   V  </p>

			<p>CIS estimates the number of illegal aliens to be 11-12 million. I find this number suspect as its been bandied about for at least 2 years since CNN first started quoting the &#8220;Pew Research Center&#8221;;</p>
<p>https://www.cnn.com/interactive/us/0603/charts.immigration/frameset.exclude.html?eref=yahoo</p>
<p>Clicking on ORIGINS in the link above, one sees the estimate that 78% of the estimated 12 million illegal aliens hail from Latin American countries, with 56% coming from mexico alone.</p>
<p>Thus, there would seem to be approximately 6.7 million mexicans in the US, not counting the other 22% of illegal aliens that come from &#8220;other Latin American countries&#8221;</p>
<p>If we assume these percentages apply roughly to the alleged 1.3 million illegals who supposedly have fled, that means approximately 728,000 mexicans have left our country.</p>
<p>This translates into roughly a 9% decline in the mexican illegal alien population.</p>
<p>Yet, the Amren story below this one quotes an AP article stating that remittances to mexico have declined by a mere 2.2%!</p>

			<p>      Everyday I see more and more pregnant hijabis pushing baby<br>
carriages full of the ones they&rsquo;ve already had. Aren&rsquo;t we sup-<br>
posed to be at war with these people? You don&rsquo;t win wars by<br>
importing the enemy into your country. And once here, they work<br>
in the ghetto converting and organizing Blacks and increasingly,<br>
Hispanics.</p>

			<p>To my dear wonderful American neighbours&hellip;.I pray to God they are fleeing South and not up North to Canada.  We have all the &#8220;vibrant diversity&#8221; that we can stomach.  </p>
<p>On a further note, if they are counting these illegals in the survey, why don&rsquo;t they just deport them when they find out they are illegal? But I guess that would make too much sense.   </p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t believe this for a second. Where I live it seems there is more than ever.The women proudly walk the streets with three kids in tow and one in a baby carraige. New vehicles that they easily can afford from their underground economy. Twenty to a house,( at night only so they don&rsquo;t get caught by code enforcement).The jails and local court rooms are jam packed with them. Leaving? I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re going anywhere.</p>

			<p>I think some might have left, but they are still everywhere in my city. Of course, my city is probably majority illegal aliens, their gangster worthless children, legal Hispanics (mostly illegals who got legalized, and &#8220;children of Mexican immigrants&#8221;. Everybody&rsquo;s here legally, and it&rsquo;s very rude to ask. But if they don&rsquo;t speak English well, you know they are probably illegals. Most legal Hispanics speak English fairly well, or a family member does. </p>
<p>But an illegal came up to the me the other day at a taco stand, said he was from San Jose, out of work (!) and hungry. I had to buy him a taco. First time I&rsquo;ve ever seen an illegal out of work (!) and hungry. And the homes that were bought be illegals living 10 and 20 to a house, in some neighborhoods, are being nuked by the foreclosure crisis. And some of the local permaunemployed Hispanic gangbanger worker hoodlums were actually able to find jobs (!) and have started working. </p>
<p>Maybe some are leaving or falling on hard times, who knows. Every little bit helps.</p>
