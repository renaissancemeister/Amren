						<p>It seems even 22 miles of open ocean might not be keeping gangs off Catalina Island, a mist-shrouded outpost of Los Angeles County best known for its Hollywood history and crystal-clear harbors.</p>
<p>Deputies on the isle say a fledgling gang called the Brown Pride Locos has gotten a foothold among the beaches, coves and tourist shops. A stabbing, burglaries and graffiti are being blamed on the gang, and deputies last month surprised teenagers practicing moves with knives on a dark bluff above Avalon&rsquo;s crescent-shaped bay.</p>
<p>A swift crackdown has netted at least six arrests and led to a pair of police raids &mdash; but it has also caused an uproar in the tiny community, where residents leave their doors unlocked and putt around in golf carts.</p>
<p>Locals insist that LA&rsquo;s corrupting influences could never penetrate their paradise, where the stars of Hollywood&rsquo;s golden age frolicked and where dozens of classics, such as &#8220;Mutiny on the Bounty&#8221; and parts of &#8220;Jaws,&#8221; were filmed.</p>
<p>Deputy David Mertens, a six-year gang enforcement veteran from Los Angeles, is trying to gain the upper hand before the violence escalates.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before I transferred here, I came to do my interview and I was shocked,&#8221; said Mertens, who was brought in with a new commander late last year. &#8220;I could not believe all these gangsters walking around and all these drug deals going on right in the open.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Others feel that deputies are profiling Hispanic teens who are the children of the maids, cooks and waiters who fuel the island&rsquo;s tourist industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve been here 19 years and there are no gangs here. It&rsquo;s ridiculous,&#8221; said 26-year-old Evelyn Cano. &#8220;They see shaved heads and tattoos, and that&rsquo;s a gang to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>But deputies insist there&rsquo;s a problem on Catalina, although they aren&rsquo;t sure exactly how it started. There are groups by the same &mdash; or similar &mdash; names in San Pedro and Long Beach, where ferries depart daily for Catalina. Mertens believes the group has quietly expanded to about 50 members since 2004.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some residents support the crackdown. Grocery store supervisor Brian Vidaillet, 31, said he recently turned over a possible gang member who was stealing alcohol from his store. Vidaillet, who moved to Catalina a year ago, said residents are angry because they are used to being left alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there&rsquo;s a problem,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If we don&rsquo;t do anything now, it&rsquo;ll grow. It&rsquo;s like a cancer.&#8221;</p>
<p>The mayor and other longtime residents scoff at these doomsday scenarios. They insist the alleged gang members are a group of childhood friends who are going stir-crazy on the 76-square-mile island.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&rsquo;t have no gang. They&rsquo;re the ones who created this problem. Every time they stop a kid, the first thing they say is, &lsquo;Are you a BPL?&rsquo; Or, &lsquo;Tell me who is,&rsquo;&#8221; said Miguel Rodriguez, whose 15-year-old son is on the sheriff&rsquo;s list of gang members.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;In Avalon, you only have two blocks. Everybody walks the same two blocks, everybody sees everybody,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s not like LA, where you can go the other direction. If you see somebody and say, &lsquo;Hey Joe,&rsquo; you can get arrested for violating probation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Even though their maid may be a great person who does her job well her kids may not be any near as nice as she was.</p>

			<p>This is the end of the world.  We can&rsquo;t even be safe on a little island whose main business is tourism.  How can they even think of letting gangsters destroy the little village of Avalon made famous in two popular songs of the 20th century:</p>
<p><b>Avalon</b> (1920)</p>
<p>I found my love in Avalon beside the bay<br>
I left my love in Avalon and sailed away<br>
I dream of her and Avalon from dusk &#8216;til dawn<br>
And so I think I&rsquo;ll travel on to Avalon<br>
(words and music by Al Jolson, Billy Rose, and Buddy DeSylva)</p>
<p><b>Twenty-Six Miles</b> (1958)</p>
<p>Twenty-six miles across the sea<br>
Santa Catalina is a-waitin&rsquo; for me<br>
Santa Catalina, the island of romance</p>
<p>A tropical heaven out in the ocean<br>
Covered with trees and girls<br>
If I have to swim, I&rsquo;ll do it forever<br>
Till I&rsquo;m gazin&rsquo; on those island pearls</p>
<p>Forty kilometers in a leaky old boat<br>
Any old thing that&rsquo;ll stay afloat<br>
When we arrive we&rsquo;ll all promote romance,<br>
romance, romance, romance<br>

<p>Here is Benny Goodman doing Avalon circa 1970, looks like on the Carson (Tonight) Show, and a collage about Catalina (26 miles, by the Four Preps):</p>

			<p>Gangs are just an extension of tribal life these people have been a part of for centuries.  The Spanish might have forced the indian out of the jungle, but it&rsquo;s obvious that they couldn&rsquo;t force the jungle out of the indian.</p>
<p>Does anybody doubt that the same is true of blacks?</p>
<p>These gangs will continue to proliferate, and many worse is better scenarios will occur before war breaks out between blacks and browns.</p>
<p>I would say that America is destined to be a battleground of tribal warfare, but that&rsquo;s what it is right now.  The only difference between now and the foreseeable future will be the scope and intensity.</p>

			<p>This is why both California and Arizona are seeing an exodus of millions of Whites every year  &mdash;   they&rsquo;ve now become little replicas of the south-of-the-border gangland thug nations that drive qualified people away.  If this is happening even on Catalina Island, you can imagine how horrendous it is for people in the cities like Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, San Francisco, Tucson and Tempe in both California and Arizona (not to mention New Mexico and much of Texas and Florida).  I personally know almost two dozen White friends and acquaintances who&rsquo;ve left these states and resettled in other states like Idaho or Wyoming, or even emigrated abroad to places like Austria, Italy, Denmark or Germany if they can speak some German or Italian.  It&rsquo;s only going to get much worse from here  &mdash;   the demographics are working disastrously against us, and by 2015-2020 the US will have a non-White majority.  It&rsquo;s already like that in California and Arizona, and anyone who&rsquo;s worked in the schools can see this nationwide.  </p>

<p>Tourists fuel the tourist industry, they and their money.  This is the kind of sneaky language that is constantly used to parlay a completely fixable problem into one where the only solution left is to absorb whatever conditions those irreplaceable Hispanics brought with them.</p>

<p>Amen, buffalonative.  I&rsquo;ve said the same thing a million times.  Mexico is the way Mexico is not because of some arbitrary lines drawn on a map.  Mexico is as Mexico is because it is populated with Mexicans.</p>
<p>How many formerly white, law-abiding, decent, nice to live in neighborhoods have to be ruined by these Mestizos and Africans before white people wake up?</p>
<p>I live in a Southwest town, having recently moved back.  There are now waaay more Mexicans in town.  It simply doesn&rsquo;t have the same feel as it used to.  There&rsquo;s graffiti all over the place.  I used to feel safe almost everywhere in town.  No more.</p>
<p>You said it; where Mexicans are, there is Mexico, and Mexicans don&rsquo;t create societies even remotely like whites do.  Africans create pestholes like Detroit and DC, the Bronx, you name it.  Wherever they are, so are their primitive, violent societies.</p>
<p>Much like subspecies in the animal kingdom, subspecies of humans are not made to inhabit the same land area.  One side will be wiped out, or at least made an insignificant and marginalized footnote in history (such as is happening and will continue to happen to whites if we do not wake up and fight this illegal invasion (if it&rsquo;s not already too late)).</p>
<p>The brainwashed, multicultist, diversity, we are all the same liberal traitors that have allowed, no encouraged this to happen should be accountable for their treachery.  </p>
<p>Honestly though, as long as the economy does not go completely belly up, and white Americans still feel like they have something to lose by upsetting the apple cart, they&rsquo;ll probably continue to keep moving away as the invaders take over their former cities.</p>
<p>Now, if the economy goes belly up, and whites no longer feel like they have something to lose, maybe the lie of the multicult will crumble, and people&rsquo;s long slumbering allegiance to tribe will reawaken.  Remember, this last 50 years is an aberration in history (with obviously disastrous results).  It can&rsquo;t last.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to get ugly(er) within 20 years.</p>

			<p>The first outsiders to any new area that blends with the host population are usually the radical block busters.  Hey, it&rsquo;s only the maids &#8220;children&#8221;, let them be.  In reality, these block busters are to blitzkrieg new areas with pincer assaults that are hard to combat, like 20-second graffiti sprayings and robbery guerilla tactics.  I believe LA needs to send in crack SWAT teams for this problem.   </p>

			<p>Catalina Island could have been spared if they had followed but one underlying principle - Mestizos = GANGS.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter how peaceful or prosperous the area is (and therefore discounting the typical liberal excuses of poverty and need for self-protection for why minorities form gangs), if you let the Mestizos come to work, THERE WILL BE GANGS.</p>

			<p>As a native Californian, I took the tourist boat to visit Catalina island numerous times as a child. It was quaint and pictureques, dotted with equally picturesque houses. There was also a lovely mansion that was home to the Wrigely family. In those days,(the 70&rsquo;s) almost every face you saw then was white, be they locals or visitors. Now it is being corrupted by brown invaders, who have place, and really no history on the island. Like so many wonderful places of our youth, non-whites are destroying them.</p>

			<p>I recently recorded the song &#8220;Twenty Six Miles across the Sea&#8221;, song by the Four Preps,(1958) about California&rsquo;s fabled Santa  Catalina Island. Then this article comes out and another piece of Americana is ripped from my consciousness and denigrated. It is truly sad, that a people with a glorious history and heritage  &mdash;  seem so unconcerned about losing it all,  &mdash;  BECASUE THAT IS EXACTLY THE CASE.</p>

<p>Ah, the old profiling defense again.  Form a criminal organization that is 100% Hispanic, and, voila!  Any actions taken against the gang are &#8220;racial profiling.&#8221;  I mean, far be it from the authorities to unfairly profile possible members of a group called the &#8220;BROWN PRIDE Locos&#8221;&hellip;</p>

			<p>What I don&rsquo;t understand is the reluctance of authorities to be pro-active when it comes to these gang organizations. When dealing with the Cosa Nostra there was certainly no hesitation in going right after them who come off like pansies compared with the brutality of groups lile MS13. According to what we&rsquo;ve been reading these Black and Latino gangs are a severe threat to the continued existence of this society and are every bit as dangerous as Al Qaida, Hezbollah and Hammas. </p>

It was getting to be the evening, when I noticed that my fellow shoppers&rsquo; visages were changing&hellip;  The &#8220;night crowd&#8221; was coming out.  I figured it was time for me to head back. The walk out to the car was downright scary!  I guess all the locals (read: whites) know when to give up and go home; now I know&hellip;  </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently recareering toward another Master&rsquo;s degree as the IT space has shrunk so dramatically because of all the flattening, offshoring, outsourcing, insourcing, etc.. I mean what used to be a distributed sprawling space of happy employment is now a very lean tight space of overworked unhappy people with only the top 2%-3% being chosen anymore for IT administration. I know I&rsquo;m complaining but a straight A MBA with a science degree in I.S. and 20 computer certifications doesn&rsquo;t get far here anymore. So I&rsquo;m recareering in to a field with a great demand and low supply of workers in an industry that can&rsquo;t really be offshored, outsourced because it&rsquo;s hands on. It can be insourced though unfortunately. Even so, at least that still is controlled by reality and visa for highly educated white collar jobs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d kind of like to stick around here for another 40 years should the Lord smile on me and write a book about the end of western civilization in the SouthWest. How it went from a crown jewel to a smoking ruin. </p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s very dangerous. It can be very dangerous. When you get into the urban side down here anything can happen. So if I survive, I&rsquo;ll write that book. Please do turn the lights off after I&rsquo;m gone. By the time I croak, there really won&rsquo;t be much left to write about here. </p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll just need to wall it off.. something that should have happened along our southern border during the early part of the last century.</p>

			<p>It is beyond peradventure that there are no actual &#8220;gangs&#8221; on Catalina Island. What is happening is that an aging indigenous population is experiencing the benefits of politically correct, multi cultural,la rasa diversity in the form of youth groups. Remember young and color always trumps old and white!</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the more diverse the population becomes, the more the original population can be expected to learn. This, of course, is a good thing! And, although it is certainly not easy, one can teach an old dog new tricks, particularly if the old dog&rsquo;s life depends on learning the new tricks!</p>
<p>Some cutting edge psychologists today would undoubtedly tell us that a life of quiet comfort can only be expected to lead to a life of indolence and sloth. They would undoubtedly recommend an exposure to the accouterments of a more &#8220;diverse&#8221; lifestyle. Yes thats it: loud speakers blaring gangster rap at 2:00 a.m., robberies, rapes, and murders during the day.</p>
<p>Soon these old codgers would learn to lock their doors not only at night but during the day as well. See how much they could learn?  How much they could benefit? Soon the sale of firearms would skyrocket! Homes would go on the block to be sold a bargain prices! Minorities would be taking over the island!</p>
<p>With the importation of African -Americans to the island, there would be the additional benefit of governmental spending. Project housing would soar! Then diverse educational benefits would occur - hip hop High Schools and artistic appreciation for alternative life styles, whether based upon sexual orientation or pharmaceutical supplementation. You get the picture!</p>
<p>These old codgers would soon have to admit that diversity is the bench mark of a Brave New World; and, that their world would soon be passing into oblivion along with them. And thats a good thing! </p>
<p>These senile old coots would have to embrace change. Rather than viewing the fresh approaches, new ideas, and a new way of thinking as obstacles they would soon have to come to terms with the fresh approach known as &#8220;out of the box&#8221; thinking.</p>
<p>As the remnants of a by gone era, these out of touch generational old guys would be able to walk along their formally pristine beaches and pontificate upon &#8220;how things used to be back in our day&#8221; while navigating their way through used hypodermic needles, broken whiskey bottles, latex condoms, and raw sewage. </p>
<p>Yes, these youth groups are just the beginning!</p>

			<p>Do articles like the above make you angry? The mainstream regards us Amren types as hate-filled supporters of racial violence. That&rsquo;s ironic, since a few decades from now, when the melting-pot meltdown really gets cooking (and its racial ingredients have mixed about as well as my metaphors), any whites reviewing the Amren posts of today  will likely regard them as just another variety of today&rsquo;s mild-mannered white response.</p>
