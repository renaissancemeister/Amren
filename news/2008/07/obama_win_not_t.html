<p>But black leaders argue that problems like discrimination, police brutality and unfairness in the legal system are still rife and they remain committed to fighting them.</p>
<p>Beyond that, many African-Americans lag behind the overall population in social standards, like health, education, income and employment, and protest remains an effective way to bring change, as it was during the civil rights heyday, they say.</p>
<p>Although blacks account for around 12 percent of the U.S. population, 44 percent of all prisoners in the United States are black, according to U.S. census data, and the number of blacks in prison has quadrupled since 1980.</p>
<p>The income of an average black family is 58 percent of that of an average white family&rsquo;s, according to a 2007 study.</p>
<p>The issue of the different roles played by Obama, who is the Democratic presidential candidate, and civil rights leaders came into focus this month after comments by veteran black campaigner Jesse Jackson on Obama.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>DUAL TRACK</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The issues that concern blacks have shifted from generation to generation. Sharpton, 53, said he had more in common with Obama and other elected black politicians such as Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick and New York Gov. David Paterson because they were all similar in age.</p>
<p>Older civil rights leaders like Jackson had their roots in the South but a new generation was more in tune with issues such as corporate discrimination, he said.</p>
<p>Several black Americans said there was still a role for protest even if Obama were president. They cited a rally last September in Jena, Louisiana, as evidence that young people had not lost their appetite to protest.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands attended the rally in support of six black teenagers accused over the beating of a white schoolmate.</p>

			<p>Of course. It will never end. As long as there enough people willing to drop out of school, have babies without having a job, arrive late for work, give less than a fair day&rsquo;s work, and blame Whitey, the race-industry will be raking in the bucks.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a very misleading statement because the average white family has two bread winners in the family and the average black family only has one. </p>
<p>When you have a black man and his wife both working they tend to do as well as whites unless they haven 15 kids. </p>

			<p>So there&rsquo;s no point in electing a black president.  We will still have to endure the whining, nagging, and general misbehavior of the black race in America.  When does it end?  When the last remaining White person breathes their last breath.</p>

<p>What percentage of the crimes committed in the U.S. are committed by blacks? There&rsquo;s your answer, Sherlock.</p>
<p>&#8220;The income of an average black family is 58 percent of that of an average white family&rsquo;s, according to a 2007 study.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pretty good for not working. What percentage of blacks&rsquo; living expenses are paid for by welfare versus out of pocket expenses? How does that compare to whites? This is basic reasoning. Anybody with a journalism degree should be able to ask these questions themselves. The problems is they are political activists and propagandists, not journalists.</p>

			<p>If Obama wins, it will be like a sea of black NBA or NFL players antics. In-your-face trash talking, bold, brazen, classless malcontents with a license to do anything.  One year after he swears on the koran, there will be a revolution in this country. Whites have had more than their fill of these incessant whiners and will finally pull the plug on all their freebies.  Hence, the spoiled children will throw a temper tantrum and get the long overdue spanking! </p>

			<p>If the Magic Mulatto wins this election and Tyrone <i>still</i> can&rsquo;t qualify for a loan to purchase the Cadillac he covets, Tyrone will draw the obvious conclusion that the white man&rsquo;s Keep The Brothers Down Ju-Ju is stronger than he thought, and that the solution to his self-inflicted problems is a new round of black candidates and &#8220;programs.&#8221; For blacks the answer never lies in the obvious thing but in magical thinking about politics. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a very misleading statement because the average white family has two bread winners in the family and the average black family only has one.&#8221;<br>
******************<br>
Actually the average black family has no real bread winner. The &#8220;head of household&#8221; (female) getting welfare, section 8 housing subsidy, food stamps, etc. etc. etc. instead of 2 working adults. I wonder if the researchers added up the value of all these services and included them in the total for the black families net income? (I doubt it.) <br>

			<p>This just goes to provde what my dear ole Dad said the day that LBJ signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  That no matter what we do, what we give them, blacks are never going to be satisfied.  An Obama presidency isn&rsquo;t going to stop their complaining and demanding.</p>

Without question one of my favorite posts so far this year.<br>
Just Excellent!</p>
<p>And, of course, I certainly hope you&rsquo;re right.  </p>
<p>But it does point to something very, very, important.</p>
<p>Organization.  OURS!</p>
<p>How are we going to do it?<br>
What is it going to consist of?<br>
What are our guiding principles?<br>
etc.</p>
<p>Having sufficiently analyzed our numerous problems, from Race, to Immigration, to Family, Society, Culture, the next question becomes, What are we going to DO about it?<br>
If we can&rsquo;t answer that one then our future can be told with perfect assurance.</p>

Who will disproprtionately receive this &#8220;federal robber baron &#8216;s &#8221; gift of stolen monies ( name the races ). Yet, the Marxist mantra that all races of people are equalstill is chanted as they rob you; the &#8221; chutzpah &#8221; of our corrupt anti-white, anti-Christian, federal government since 1954 A.D. .</p>
