						<p>A dwarf planet orbiting beyond Neptune has been designated the third plutoid in the solar system and given the name Makemake, the International Astronomical Union said on Saturday.</p>
<p>The red methane-covered dwarf planet formerly known as 2005 FY9 or &#8220;Easterbunny&#8221; is named after a Polynesian creator of humanity and god of fertility.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Makemake is just slightly smaller and dimmer than Pluto and was discovered in 2005.</p>
<p>&#8220;The orbit is not particularly strange, but the object itself is big, probably about two-thirds the size of Pluto,&#8221; said Mike Brown of the California Institute of Technology, who discovered and named Makemake (pronounced MAH-keh MAH-keh).</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Brown said the name came to him when he was looking for a mythological god and thought of the South Pacific&rsquo;s Easter Island. Makemake was the chief god among people who settled the island.<br>

			<p><i>Brown said the name came to him when he was looking for a mythological god and thought of the South Pacific&rsquo;s Easter Island. Makemake was the chief god among people who settled the island.<br>
</i><p>This report is no cause for outrage, but rather amusement: it&rsquo;s probably appropriate that this stargazer named a horrid, uninhabitable, distant, methane-muddled pseudo-planet after a forgotten god of a remote, barren and nearly uninhabited Pacific Island.  <p>We&rsquo;ll know for sure that that&rsquo;s the case if Mr. Brown is denounced therefor by some doctrinaire diversicrat for &#8220;insulting&#8221; Easter Islanders and their culture - such would be an &#8220;unintended consequence&#8221; typical of white people&rsquo;s attempts to honor the dogma of multiculturalism, and perhaps an event that would knock some sense into Mr. Brown&rsquo;s sleekly complacent cranium.</p></p></p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m a huge Sci Fi fan, so I&rsquo;m glad to see this about a Red-Dwarf on here.</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t there a Sci Fi show on PBS called &#8216;Red Dwarf&rsquo; concerning the ship Red Dwarf carrying some of the last humans? &#8216;Lister&rsquo; a black/blackmixed party animal type-guy was the main character, and &#8216;Rimmer&rsquo;, a nerdy/gung ho white guy, who might even fit in here, was his friend. &#8216;Rimmer&rsquo; wasn&rsquo;t even alive anymore, only a hologram. There were actually 4 regular characters, Lister, Rimmer, Cat, Kryton (a robot), and &#8216;Holly&rsquo; the ships computer, well 5 characters.</p>
<p>It took me awhile to notice the racial component of the show, although I did notice &#8216;Cat&rsquo; (a really black guy who looked like a regular guy but acted like a cat) - I noticed that being odd right away. </p>
<p>It was a great show, regardless. Maybe even an optimistic show. Maybe white Englanders will live on after all even if only as a hologram. <br>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure of meeting some of the present-day inhabitants Easter Island (Rapa Nui).  I can state, unequivocally, they are the friendliest, most beautiful, and most humble people on our planet.  Centuries ago, their Polynesian ancestors crossed the wide expanse of the Pacific Ocean, using the stars for navigation, much in the same way we hope to travel through our solar system one day.  Also, while their island home is small, they have graciously allowed the U.S. to build there the longest runway in the Pacific, to be used in the event of an emergency landing by the NASA space shuttle.  Thus, I find it quite appropriate that a new planet be named after one of their deities.</p>

			<p>There are a lot of things like that out there - to many to name after Roman dieties.  Google &#8220;Trans-Neptunian Objects&#8221; for a singular lesson in just how many large &#8220;snowballs&#8221; orbit beyond Neptune.</p>
<p>Our solar system really has two belts.  The first known was the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.  Ceres was the first of these discovered, and was first thought to be a small, lone planet, about the size of Texas.  Other objects were soon discovered, and the nature of the asteroid belt became clear.</p>
<p>The Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune is much the same, with Pluto much in the same category as Ceres - once thought to be a planet, but now known to be a major member of a very large association of similar individuals.  Unlike the rocky asteroid belt, in the Kuiper Belt things like ice and frozen gases predominate.  Since many objects are in eccentric orbits and/or strongly inclined to the plane of the ecliptic, they are difficult to detect.  Since we hae discovered quite a lot of them, this must mean there are a huge number of objects.</p>
<p>Three major populations of Kuiper Belt objects are known: &#8220;Plutinos&#8221;.  These are objects that like Pluto, share a 3:2 orbital resonance with Neptune.  &#8220;Two-One-Ohs&#8221;, which share a 2:1 orbital resonance with Neptune (these are farther out), and &#8220;Scattered Disc Objects&#8221;, which orbit yet farther out.  A peculiar &#8220;Extended Scattered Disc Object&#8221; named Sedna is also known.  Sedna&rsquo;s very eccentric orbit takes it between the Kuiper Belt partway to the Oort Cloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Makemake&#8221; isn&rsquo;t runaway Political Correctness, unless the Wise and the Good forget about Babylonian, Egyptian, Norse, Finnish, and Celtic dieties.</p>
<p>Between Trans-Neptunian Object and extra-solar planet dscoveries, this is a good time in which to be an astronomy buff.</p>

			<p>Years ago I saw a group of black militants whining on a TV show that the planets and stars had all been named after Greek and Roman gods but not Afican ones.</p>
<p>Of course these dopes couldn&rsquo;t name a heavenly body whatever they wanted because they would have to discover one first. </p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s articles like this that hurt the credibility of this website. It&rsquo;s really a stretch to equate the naming of a minor and insignificant dwarf planet, of which there may be hundreds yet to be discovered, to some supposed insult to Western culture. The reason that the object got the name it did, is because it was nicknamed Easter Bunny by the astronomer who discovered it, because he found it on Easter Sunday. It&rsquo;s common for astronomers to give celestial objects nicknames as placeholders, because their discoveries must be verified by others before it can receive it&rsquo;s official name. When the time came to name it, he wanted to keep the Easter association, so he named it Makemake, a deity of Easter Island. This is because the tradition of naming planets after deities. It had nothing to do with political correctness.</p>

<p><br>  &mdash;  -Posted by at 1:42 PM on July 23<p>Of <i>course</i> it had <i>everything</i> to do with political correctness: do you really mean to imply that Mr. Brown is a &#8220;Rapa Nui&#8221; rather than a Westerner, or to assert that his choice of a god&rsquo;s name from that locale was just his way of &#8220;keep[ing] the Easter connection&#8221;?  Besides, the tradition of naming planets after deities is a <i>white, Western</i> tradition - just as an example, Mars is referred to in Chinese as the &#8220;Fire Star,&#8221; not by some Chinese god.<p>At any rate, Brown appears to know little about the deity whose name he chose, for according to the Wikipedia article on Easter Island, Makemake was a &#8220;previously unexceptional&#8221; god whose cult was promoted after an 18th Century coup by military leaders, which cult was &#8220;to blame for the island&rsquo;s misery of the late 18th and 19th centuries,&#8221; according to the Wikipedia article. <p>Some god.  Some planet.  Some rationale for naming it.</p></p></p></p>

<p>(laughter) I didn&rsquo;t even make that connection! I was wondering what the story was doing on here. I was just glad it was. </p>

			<p>Naming the plutoid after a &#8220;Rapa Nui&#8221; god had <i>nothing</i> to do with political correctness?<p>Here&rsquo;s a few passages from a National Geographic on-line article, &#8220;New Dwarf Planet Marks Shift in Naming Trend&#8221;:<p><i>&#8220;By having Makemake not be a Greek or Roman name, we&rsquo;ve got away from that idea for these dwarf planets, and I think that&rsquo;s good,&#8221; [Brian] Marsden [of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory&rsquo;s Minor Planet Center] said.<p>&hellip;<p>Brown, as the discoverer of so many new celestial objects, has written quite a few names in the stars.<p> </p>
<p>Among them are <b>Quaoar, a creation force of the Los Angeles Tongva tribe; Orcus, the earlier Etruscan counterpart to Pluto; Sedna, the Inuit sea goddess</b>&hellip;</p></p></p></i><p>I think it&rsquo;s fair to conclude from this article that 1) Mr. Brown has a penchant for naming celestial objects after non-Western gods (or preferably, goddesses), and that 2) this penchant of his has the approval of the government funded Smithsonian.  I wonder how people can avoid the inference that his choice of the name Makemake for the new planet derived from conventional obeisance to political correctness; perhaps such compliance is so automatic and pervasive that the average white person is not even consciously aware of it.<br>
