						<p>{snip} According to a report released this week by the Annie E. Casey Foundation, black teens in Ohio die at nearly twice the rate of white teens.</p>
<p>Columbus Public Health officials say the disparity in Franklin County is even worse. Here, the death rate for black teens is more than three times higher.</p>
<p>Child-health advocates say the gap is troubling.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Black infants also fared poorly, the report says, dying more than twice as often as non-Latino white babies and three times more frequently than Latino infants.</p>
<p>For years, the Casey Foundation has compiled an annual report on child well-being. This is the first time the data, from 2005, also has been broken down by race.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jennifer Connery, executive director of the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Columbus, said money for more programs is only part of the answer. &#8220;I think we need awareness just as much,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 2005, the same year studied in the Casey report, 87 percent of all Franklin County homicide victims younger than 18 were black. &#8220;And they&rsquo;re roughly 20 percent of the population,&#8221; said Kathleen Cowen of Columbus Public Health. &#8220;So that&rsquo;s the disparity.&#8221;</p>

<p>I doubt many Whites, Latinos, and Asians living in any area around &#8220;Black&#8221; &#8220;youth&#8221; are unaware of the problem.</p>
<p>What would these &#8220;child health advocates&#8221; recommend in order to produce the desired equality of outcome? That the non &#8220;Black&#8221; populations kill more of each other?</p>

			<p>From the full article:  <i>Tray said he tells himself it&rsquo;s important to stay off the streets. But it isn&rsquo;t easy finding safe, positive places. &#8220;It&rsquo;s hard because this is my neighborhood,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&rsquo;m attached to this environment.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>That comment was obviously coached.  Modern 17 yr-olds don&rsquo;t naturally say, &#8220;I&rsquo;m attached to my environment.&#8221;  That quote is straight out of a flaky sociology textbook; black &#8220;youth&#8221; have been coached in victimology by social workers and liberal teachers for decades, and now they&rsquo;re even parroting the language.  It would be funny if it weren&rsquo;t so pathetic!  </p>
<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t Tray entertain himself at home instead of &#8220;running the streets&#8221; or waiting for the city to plan his evenings for him?  Why doesn&rsquo;t he do his homework, read a book or work on a project with his dad?  </p>
<p>Oh, wait, <i>he&rsquo;s black??</i>  Well then I guess we&rsquo;d better call the city parks and recreation department when he gets bored&hellip;  </p>

			<p>Why, why, why can these people never clean up their act and keep it together??????  And &#8220;create awareness&#8221;?  We&rsquo;re already more than aware that they destroy everything they touch.</p>
<p>The blame for all these circumstances rest squarely on the shoulders of blacks themselves, PERIOD!!!  I don&rsquo;t care how much $$$ you throw at them, history has shown that it will be all for naught  &mdash;  nothing will ever change.</p>
<p>Articles like this one do not make me feel compassion or pity  &mdash;  only contempt for these people who constantly DEMAND for whitey to do and do and do for them, like a spoiled toddler.  <br>
I&rsquo;d be in total shock if they actually did anything remotely  constructive in their &#8216;communities&rsquo;.</p>

I detect a lack of enthusiasm for actually doing anything about this. &#8220;Awareness,&#8221; the all-purpose liberal solution to everything, gets token lip service.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine with me, since they don&rsquo;t know what would work anyway. </p>

			<p>As an institution, single-parent black families have been a disaster for the kids involved.  The older ones get shot or contract HIV, and the younger ones drown while swimming unsupervised or are beaten to death by mom&rsquo;s boyfriend, yet we are constantly told that neighborhoods composed of these abbreviated families are &#8220;vibrant&#8221; and that the women heading them are &#8220;strong&#8221;.</p>

			<p>There&rsquo;s one very big ommission in this article:  Black crime among teens is many multiples higher than white teen crime, and black teens are more apt to resort to shootings and killings  than white teens.</p>
<p>Just a wee ommission.  Nothing that really matters, though, since it only involves the truth and has absolutely no bearing on a propagandist&rsquo;s desire to create false impressions.</p>
<p>Now, do we hold a candlight vigil immediately, as we hug each other and cry over the abject injustice of it all, or do we riot?  Either way is o.k. with me.  I just want to know what clothes to wear.</p>

			<p>The more I watch CNN&rsquo;s &#8220;Black in America&#8221;, focusing on problems like this, the more infuriating it gets.</p>
<p>Why is this whitey&rsquo;s fault? And what is &#8220;money for more programs&#8221; and &#8220;more awareness&#8221; going to do to help? As it is, the more aware I get the less sympathetic I feel.</p>

<p>According to common sense, it means that black teens are killing at nearly twice the rate as white teens, given that black teens are the ones doing all the black teen killing (OK, the Mexicans are killing black folk, too) and are the only ones who can stop it.</p>

			<p>Just watch AMREN in the near future folks. They&rsquo;ll bring us the news articles of the next bunch of new social programs to address this all-too-predictable outcome of the old social programs.  </p>
<p>Government at all levels ALWAYS rewards chaos and barbarity in the black community with money from the tax coffers to include set-asides, preferences and entitlements. Of course, the black folks who will run these programs will prosper mightily as they demand even more treasure from the productive. And the irresponsible birthing, absent parenting, and the carnage will continue in the so-called &#8220;black community&#8221;. </p>

			<p>Just a few weeks ago, there was a drive-by in front of a Boys Club in Tulsa:</p>
<p>https://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?articleID=20080715_11_A1_spancl772376</p>
<p>Yes, usual suspects.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t go thinking that the Boys&rsquo; Clubs are so safe.</p>

			<p>This only tells half the story. Look at the rate at which they commit homicide and the cause of the disparity becomes readily apparent.</p>

			<p>The radical left always has an explanation for any black problem.  Whites, well white males in particular.  They have even gotten some people that claim to be MD&rsquo;s to say that black infant mortality is so high because of the stress of white racism.  Young black males tend to be involved in things that  either send to jail or the morgue, that is a fact. Their deaths are just the effect, the cause is their destructive nature.</p>

<p>       What? That means White babies are dying at a higher rate than Hispanic babies? That is horrifying news. </p>

			<p>&#8220;According to a report released this week by the Annie E. Casey Foundation, black teens in Ohio die at nearly twice the rate of white teens.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because of the high rate of gun violence among young black males, but of course whites will be to blame somehow for this.</p>
<p>&#8220;Black infants also fared poorly, the report says, dying more than twice as often as non-Latino white babies and three times more frequently than Latino infants.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because blacks are more likely to use drugs, drink or smoke during pregnancy and are less likely to get prenatal care or to take their babies to the doctor even though they can get free care on medicaid. Again, of course it will somehow be white&rsquo;s fault.</p>

			<p>In the bizarre world of the MSM, any time there is any disparity concerning anything, it&rsquo;s cause for concern or alarm.  If God were a leftist, there would be no separate species, no mountains and valleys, no changes of weather.  All life would be exactly the same, all objects exactly the same color, the landscape one endless plain, the weather a monotonous drizzle.  Anything other than that would involve disparity and we can&rsquo;t have that, now can we?  Here&rsquo;s what they fail to comprehend: diversity = disparity.  If you celebrate one, you must celebrate the other.  Reject one, you must reject the other.  Only in their make-believe fantasy world can there somehow be diversity and no disparity.  Those people should be locked up in mental institutions to consort with the voices in their heads.  Instead they somehow became our rulers and waste billions of our dollars trying to acheive their impossible dream.</p>

			<p>Ugh.  I am so sick of hearing the word &#8220;awareness&#8221;.  Believe you me, I am PLENTY aware.  This is not news to me at all.  You know who need to benefit from some awareness?  The people committing these crimes!  Yup.  Young black males.  They&rsquo;re the ones with no awareness.  The reason the rest of us are not out on the streets acting like a bunch of thugs is because we are AWARE!  </p>
<p>And really, why do these kids need programs?  Why?  I grew up in a place with no &#8220;programs&#8221;, and I just sort of managed to keep myself entertained anyway.  Not that hard.  Also, the only kids who are going to participate in these programs are the kids that are already doing pretty well.  It&rsquo;s not going to benefit the criminals at all.  </p>
<p>And to you who said that these &#8220;families&#8221; are not &#8220;strong&#8221;, yayyyyyy!!!!  I am getting so sick of hearing this.  Drives me nuts.  I am a single young woman with a college degree and a law degree.  I don&rsquo;t pump out bastards carte blanche.  I keep my life (relatively) together so I never have any really big problems to deal with.  I work very hard. Yet, you would never hear anyone describe me as &#8220;strong&#8221;.  Oh no.  That word is reserved for those who have had many illegitimate kids starting at age 16.  That word is for those who barely keep their act together. That word is for those who have a son in prison for murder.  Those people are considered strong.  </p>
<p>That is not strength people, it&rsquo;s pure weakness.  </p>

			<p>Black babies are dying at higher rates than Hispanic and white babies because they are born to 13 year old mothers with various venereal diseases and other high risk health problems, plus little to no prenatal care. These mothers have no real interest or knowledge in childcare and dump them on various relatives and friends to care for once the &#8220;cute&#8221; wears off. Meanwhile the so-called fathers are out doing what gang-bangers do  &mdash;  impregnating more 13 year old girls, taking and selling illegal drugs, raping and robbing, having fun with drive-by shootings &hellip; So they are self-selecting via Darwinism  &mdash;  just not fast enough to save civilized society from them.</p>

			<p>In a sense, I find this good news.  Blacks are killing each other and keeping their population down.  As long as no one else is killed in the crossfire, they should be allowed to thin their herds as much as they want.  Let their natural law of the jungle rule.</p>

<p>Looks like the only way to reduce these &#8220;bleak stats&#8221; is to convince young blacks that it&rsquo;s not nice to shoot each other.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t see how this is unnatural;  blacks simply have an accellerated life cycle.  They reproduce younger and at a faster rate than whites, and they generally die earlier.  Their lifestyle and odd culture result in earlier deaths when compared to whites.</p>

			<p>Without Western aka, white man medicine, what would this black mortality rate be ? Obviously it is only conjecture but using African or Haitian tribal medicine, it is a given that the rate would be considerably much higher than the &#8221; twice &#8221; ratio, so therefore, blacks and white Marxist liberals should &#8221; count their blessings &#8221; that they live and want to live with the &#8221; man &#8221; for a better and longer life; it spite of their stupid, non-appreciative, anti-white,hateful ways.</p>

			<p>A great and vacuous turn of phrase, &#8220;&hellip; troubling.&#8221;  It&rsquo;s a nice, apolitical-sounding term that rolls off the tongue: i.e., &#8220;The lack of awareness of inner-city youths killing each other is a glimpse into a &#8216;troubling&rsquo; scenario that needs to be addressed by the community&#8221; &hellip; BLAH, Blah, blah. The first step in solving a problem is admitting you have one: 1st step &mdash; you&rsquo;re violent and running one FULL standard deviation lower than average intelligence. Now, having articulated the problem[s] we can move past &#8216;troubling&rsquo;, one hopes&hellip; .</p>

They need to find their own solutions sans taxpayer aid.One of the greatest blunders in American history was the importation of African slaves to this country.For every Duke Ellington you get a hundred criminals. Observe how effective &#8220;The Million Man March&#8221;was. From one generation to the next it comes down to one word&hellip;&hellip;irresponsibility.</p>
