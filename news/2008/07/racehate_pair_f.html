					<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rob Preece, Yorkshire Post, July 16, 2008</i></p>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>TWO men convicted of publishing race-hate articles on the internet have skipped bail and fled to the United States to claim political asylum, the Yorkshire Post can reveal.</p>
<p>Simon Sheppard and Stephen Whittle were given bail by a judge at Leeds Crown Court on Friday, despite having been found guilty of a series of race-related offences.</p>
<p>The pair were due to return to court on Monday while a jury continued deliberating over further charges, but they failed to show up.</p>
<p>Last night Sheppard, 51, and Whittle, 41, were being held by immigration officials at Los Angeles Airport &mdash; outside the jurisdiction of the British court system.</p>
<p>It is believed that the pair travelled from the UK to Ireland by ferry before taking a direct flight to Los Angeles.</p>
<p>They are likely to have their case considered at an immigration hearing in the US before UK authorities can secure their return.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Humberside Police, which led the race-hate investigation, said: &#8220;We are led to believe that they are indeed being detained by the Immigration and Naturalisation Service (INS) at Los Angeles Airport.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are in custody and we are in liaison with the INS to establish that this pair are our two men and, if so, what is likely to happen to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sheppard, of Brook Street, Selby, was found guilty after a seven-week trial of 11 counts of publishing racially inflammatory written material.</p>
<p>The jury gave unanimous verdicts on nine of the charges on Friday, and returned with two majority verdicts on Monday while Sheppard was absent.</p>
<p>Whittle, of Avenham Lane, Preston, was convicted of five counts of publishing racially inflammatory written material.</p>
<p>Four of the verdicts were reached unanimously on Friday, and the fifth was returned by a majority of 10 to one on Monday after Whittle had absconded.</p>
<p>The jury were unable to reach verdicts on seven further race-related charges which Sheppard faced.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the Crown Prosecution Service said it had yet to decide whether Sheppard should be retried on the seven outstanding charges. It has 14 days to reach a decision.</p>
<p>The case is due to be considered further at a hearing at Leeds Crown Court on July 28.<br>

<p>They&rsquo;re fantastic and I desperately hope that they&rsquo;re given the asylum they deserve.  1st Amendment is 1st for a reason.</p>

			<p>  The UK is beyond hope. I have read all of Whittle / O&rsquo;Farrel columns and have found them to be honest and straight forward much like many here on Amren. If Jared Taylor found himself in the UK, Canada, or Germany he may well find himself in the Dock as well. </p>

oh Lord have mercy on us, and protect us against the evil traitors in our midst, who seek our destruction by any means. Please give us the strength and courage to overcome these evil, diabolical entities. Amen</p>

			<p>So what race were they writting about and what did they print&hellip;I would love all the details, but I am only guessing mind you, they are both white and had the nerve to print something truthful about blacks, muslims and other assorted trash??? Am I right????? Anyone gonna take bets on this one????</p>

			<p>This is what the asylum system was designed for.  It was designed to liberate white people from communist regimes (USSR) and neo-communist regimes (UKSSR).</p>

			<p>They might have done better to have flown to Mexico and entered the U.S. through Tiajuana or Juarez, thereby dodging the custody of the INS.  Of course, any Catholic church would have offered them sanctuary once they cleared the border, right?  Too late for that, but in any event, the case for political asylum is obvious.  Has the Government founded by John Adams, George Washington, and Thomas Jefferson,the nerve to defy the Crown Prosecution Service?  </p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a good example of what a very large part of the problem is regarding the destruction of white culture and tradition and the suppression of free speech.  It is brainless, spineless whites who are so stupidly gullible they participate in destroying other white people, reinforcing policy that was designed to keep whites down.</p>
<p>What every one of them needs, on this jury and wherever else they might support the destruction of their own people, is a long stint in a non-white environment where they&rsquo;re brutalized and harassed on a daily basis, which would be most any non-white area, with the possible exception of an Asians one.</p>
<p>When white historians write of this period years from now, they will refer to these type of people as being so well indoctrinated and gullible they participated vigorously in their own destruction.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s official.  The West today is firmly in the hands of Psychopaths. </p>
<p>The material on their site is well-reasoned and well-written, and probably pretty popular. Which is why they are being made an example of.<br>
Not quite sure why they skipped town and went to the States.  Don&rsquo;t really get that one. These guys must have known that we&rsquo;re barely one notch above England and Canada when it comes to Free Speech.<br>
But over in San Francisco they want to keep Central American Drug Dealers and Murders out of jail.</p>
<p>Like I said, the West, and the USA are firmly in the hands of Psychopaths.</p>

			<p>Unfortunately, white race realists will not find asylum in our PC land, any more than southern African whites will. If such a land existed - that welcomed whites who are &#8220;guilty&#8221; of upholding Western Civilization - millions of Americans would flee there.<br>

			<p>They&rsquo;re hardcore anti-Semites in general. They are neo-Nazis and Holocaust revisionists. They write some stuff on Blacks, but not too much. Jews are importing Blacks and non-Whites into the UK, and this is destroying the UK. Stuff like that. They&rsquo;re also misogynists, like most fascists.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re smart and funny, but they do not resemble Amren at all. If they did, no decent person would come to this site.</p>

			<p>The sad fact is that many people who are responsible for or have actually committed acts of violence that have killed and maimed civilians have applied for &#8216;political asylum&rsquo; - and have actually got it, on the grounds that their &#8216;ethnic or political&rsquo; group was being &#8216;persecuted&rsquo; by state actors.<br>
 However Sheppard and Whittle are the type of person that political asylum was originally intended to foster and protect - the Alexander Solzhenitsyns of this World - writers and intellectuals, who acting genuinely out of the spirit of the dignity of the expressed human voice have sought to challenge a tyrannical state by daring to voice heterodox opinions, rather in the manner of George Orwell&rsquo;s novel &#8216;1984&rsquo;.<br>
  It is precisely to preserve free speech (in the truest sense of the word) and the dignity accorded to express heterodox political opinions (notice I do not say &#8216;right&rsquo; as evidently this &#8216;right&rsquo; does not exist in Britain), that dissidents are supposedly accorded the privelege of asylum.<br>
  But on the other hand, the concept of political asylum has been so throughly abused these days that the public (quite rightly) associates it with the opportunist illiterate Somali goat-herd who is unable to read let alone formulate political opinions.</p>

			<p>Since these two were prosecuted for their political statements, they are eminently qualified for refugee status.  Given the politcally-correct climate in the US that has prevented us from accemting white refugees from Zimbabwe, who are in genuine fear of their lives, it seems quite unlikely that we will grant asylum on a first-amendment basis.</p>

			<p>This IS an important case - let everyone you know know of it, EVEN if they are opposed to &#8216;racism&rsquo; its a clear illustration that the UK is prosecuting people for THOUGHT CRIMES.  </p>
<p>This can be as embarrassing a setback to the PC police as the mark steyn case. </p>

			<p>An interesting point they mention at the top of their home page is that at trial they had a Muslim forewoman on the jury.  Doesn&rsquo;t a person have the right to a jury of his peers?  How is a Muslim woman a peer of a British man?  Her perspective will be so completely different than his. </p>
<p>It is open season on non-PC white males living in an Orwellian state.  Why?  Because you are the most independent and creative of all the races, and the elite want their countries filled with non-thinking, conformist dumbos.</p>

<p>No argument with your first sentence Scott.</p>
<p>The second sentence of your quoted above is one I given some thought to as well. These two men are not stupid, so my guess is that they did it to draw attention to their case.  If there&rsquo;s any validity to this point of view then these two deserve our respect and attention.<br>
Yeah, I have read their site and it is, as you say, well-written and well-reasoned.  Still I wouldn&rsquo;t exactly take the approach they&rsquo;ve chosen.  Never the less, what is happening to them is awful, just awful.  <br>
In the first place, Hollywood should be arrested for Hate Crimes against Whites.  After all, they&rsquo;ve been practicing it for decades.</p>

I would still come here, Mr. Lindsay!  Even without the attraction of you.</p>
<p>Are some points of view to be blacked out if they don&rsquo;t meet with YOUR approval?  Who will decide?  </p>
<p>Are you suggesting that your description of them (&#8220;fascists&#8221; etc.)should disqualify them  from every other citizen&rsquo;s right to freedom of expression and to hold independent political opinion?  If so, would you also advocate its denial to self-declared Communists, such as yourself?   (After all, what&rsquo;s fair for the goose is fair for the gander, is it not?)</p>

<p>Hey, Bobby Lindsay.

<p>So, please do the Amren readers a big favor and cease with your lame efforts to scoop sand over this smelly brown object in the litter box that was once Western European civilization, okay?</p>

Thank  you.  Wouldn&rsquo;t you think that if Mr. Lindsay found that smelly subject to be objectionable, he would at least (given his  considerable writing talents) take pains to explain  to us exactly WHY?  He should be able to do that very easily, instead of trying simply to cover it up and make it go away.</p>
<p>But I saw no factual arguments of rebuttal in his post    &mdash;   nor even such an attempt   &mdash;   just the usual leftist name-calling and attempts to censor what he doesn&rsquo;t like or doesn&rsquo;t want others to hear.</p>
<p>Sorry, Mr. Lindsay, if truth were on your side, you could do better than that. </p>

<p>True enough.  But you have to look at the proportions to get a true  sense of perspective.  If  (let&rsquo;s say)  2/3 come from 3% of the population and 1/3 come from 97% of the population, then would you try to tell us that stark fact  is insignificant and unworthy of notice?</p>
