						<p>State school pupils are set to be taught Islamic traditions and values in compulsory citizenship lessons.</p>
<p>The move &mdash; part of a package of initiatives announced by Communities Secretary Hazel Blears yesterday &mdash; is designed to curb extremism.</p>
<p>Education campaigners warned however against giving Islam a privileged position over other faiths.</p>
<p>Other plans announced by Miss Blears also drew criticism &mdash; including a state-funded panel of Islamic scholars and theologians to provide community leadership.</p>
<p>Prominent Muslims said this scheme was naive because Government endorsement would erode the credibility of those taking part, especially among the young and disaffected.</p>
<p>Another measure will see Muslim children being taught citizenship lessons by imams in mosque schools &mdash; in the hope that they will be better equipped to resist extremist messages.</p>
<p>Many Muslim youngsters in the UK attend evening classes at madrassah schools attached to mosques, where imams give instruction in the Koran and Islamic history.</p>
<p>Ministers want imams to stress that the Koran places a duty on all Muslims to be good neighbours, carry out voluntary work and play an active part in civic society.</p>
<p>Pilot schemes will begin in October in London, Leicester, Birmingham, Oldham, Rochdale, and Bradford.</p>
<p>The Department for Communities and Local Government has tasked the Islam &amp; Citizenship Education group with producing the teaching materials for mosques.</p>
<p>The organisation, however, wants to extend its remit to mainstream state schools by &lsquo;teaching Islamic traditions and values in the school citizenship curriculum&rsquo;.</p>
<p>David Conway, senior research fellow at the Civitas think-tank, said: &lsquo;Some will see this as another sign of a creeping process of Islamisation &mdash; an insidious process which plays down the Christian basis of our culture and encourages children to learn more and more about Islam&rsquo;s contribution.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Muslims are still a relatively small minority in Britain and, while I have nothing against children in our multi-religious society learning about each other&rsquo;s faiths, for one particular faith to be privileged in mainstream schools seems to me pointless, and won&rsquo;t make for greater harmony.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I fear it will play into the hands of the small minority who want to see the Islamisation of Europe, and believe they will triumph through sheer numbers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Unlike religious education classes, citizenship lessons, which do not cover issues of belief, are compulsory.</p>
<p>Nick Seaton, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said: &lsquo;We should not single out one particular faith. Citizenship is supposed to be secular.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Children can learn about particular religious values in religious education lessons. That&rsquo;s why parents have the right to withdraw. It&rsquo;s a very different matter to promote a particular faith&rsquo;s values as part of compulsory citizenship lessons.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It seems to me dangerous to single out the one faith which is probably linked to the most problems with terrorism at the moment for special treatment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Khalid Mahmood, project manager of Islam &amp; Citizenship Education, stressed that the project was at a very early stage.</p>
<p>He said: &lsquo;The material is being developed for the madrassahs but we are putting it together so that people in mainstream schools would also be able to use it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Miss Blears announced details of the panel of 20 leading Muslim experts which will have £100,000 in state funding.</p>
<p>Based at Cambridge University, the experts will be expected to compile reports on key issues in the lives of British Muslims, such as the wearing of Islamic veils by women.</p>
<p>Miss Blears insisted the new panel would be independent, adding: &lsquo;It is not for Government to dictate on matters of faith or religious teaching.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Dr Azzam Tamimi, of the Institute of Islamic Political Thought in London, said the scheme was doomed to failure.</p>
<p>He said: &lsquo;This is a naive initiative. This not how Muslim education or awareness works.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When a Muslim individual seeks advice or knowledge he or she would usually go to a person they consider to be credible or an authority, and usually Muslims are suspicious of government-sponsored or organised commissions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Dr Tamimi told BBC Radio 4&rsquo;s Today Programme ministers were trying to dictate to Muslims over religious awareness and education.<br>

			<p>This is it. The beginning of the end for (formerly) Great Britain. British women had better start stocking up on robes and veils and figuring out how to get to market without driving. Once they start indoctrinating the schoolchildren with compulsory Islamic teachings the next step is calling them all converts and then they HAVE to remain Muslims or face death. They will also have to do their sworn duty to try and kill all non-muslim infidels  &mdash;  such as their parents and other older family members. </p>

			<p>Man oh man&hellip;.the situation in britain just keeps getting worse and worse.  The government there is creating a real environment for a fascist backlash there.  When people have had enough, I think they are likely to hang their leaders and shoot the immigrants.</p>
<p>See if it doesn&rsquo;t happen exactly like that.</p>

			<p>I have an email pen pal in the UK.  He is only 16, BNP all the way, and sends me videos daily of all the nonsense that is going on.  One group, the UAF (United Against Fascim), primarily composed of white Britons from what I&rsquo;ve seen, can&rsquo;t seem to wait until Britain is finally dead, and protest rabidly whenever someone for the BNP has a speaking engagement or holds a rally on the street.  He is 16, and he can see what awaits.  His youtube moniker is RIPGB1991.  Nothing is more fascist, sexist,or oppressive than islam. They truly make my skin crawl.</p>

			<p>  I truly hope the white Brits do get fed up and hang their leaders and the muslims. Call for the headsman, time is getting short. Britain must be saved for the white Brits.</p>

			<p>But will the kids be allowed to be taught Christian, Jewish and Hindu &#8220;traditions&#8221; as well?  Religion has all but been banned from State schools by the government so how are they going to get around this?</p>
<p>Will the children be allowed to question and criticise openly any aspects of Islam they find repugnant without being accused of racism?  I think not!</p>
<p>My eldest daughter now in her forties, after having discussions about life usually in our family car, was congratulated at school for during organised debates, being the only child in the class supporting fox-hunting in the 1970s.  The teacher said that she had an answer for everything and the rest of the class ended up stumped.   She was judged the winner, one against over 30 others.   </p>
<p>(Foxes are like rats, not pretty little dogs as most city dwellers think.  The other children had not seen 30 plus chickens killed in a farmer&rsquo;s yard by one fox. Hence the old now illegal tradition of fox-hunting where 3 of every four hunted escape anyway.  They are now shot or gassed.)</p>
<p>Now, theoretically, she would be shut up by the teacher for daring to &#8220;criticise a religion (or foxhunting)&#8221; with the facts.    No wonder the British National Party is feared and demeaned by the other political parties in the UK.</p>
<p>  Thank God we live in Spain now where the Spanish people are more sensible in this matter, tolerant but &#8220;do not step over the line&#8221;.   But funnily enough, some of the British expats. living here are brainwashed and refuse to see any other point of view but their own.   So sad!</p>

<p>We no longer have that in the U.S. and the MUSLIMS are encroaching on that more and more since they got the beach head in Michigan.</p>

			<p>Britain keeps on going down the drain everyday. Anyways I hope the children learn some good things out of Islam say, family values (which the west has lost in the last 50 years), rejection of the degenerate pointless youth culture of Big Brother and Amy Winehouse etc&hellip; There are good and bad things in every ideology. The trick is to pick up the best and use it for the good of the Volk.</p>

<p>Exactly. Islam goes against women&rsquo;s rights, gay rights or any other rights. The Left supports it simply because it is mostly praciticed by non-whites and anything non-whites do is a-ok in their eyes.</p>
