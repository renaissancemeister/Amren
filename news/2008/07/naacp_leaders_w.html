						<p>NAACP leaders meeting in in Cincinnati say they will step up their campaign against flying of the Confederate battle flag on state grounds in South Carolina.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A 2000 compromise removed the flag from the Capitol dome in South Carolina. It now flies on Statehouse grounds near the Confederate Soldier Monument.</p>
<p>The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has continued a boycott of the state.<br>

			<p>Another shakedown to gain $$$ from hand wringing, self loathing liberals and Fortune 500 corporations.  Enrollment is in the pits and they need some money! How better to get those dollars than by stirring the pot and inflaming the brothas against evil, racist S.C., all because of a piece of cloth.</p>
<p><br>
They might gain some credibility if they would address the problems in their community, such as rampant drug use and  promiscuity, nonbelief in education, irresponsible sperm donor fathers, welfare reliance and a general lack of morals.</p>
<p>As far as their so called &#8220;boycott&#8221; of SC, big deal.  We like it just fine that the boycott is in place.  Too bad the black bikers have ignored it though.</p>

			<p>What a bunch of whiners.</p>
<p>They agreed to the compromise back in the &#8216;90&rsquo;s to stop their crying if the flag was moved from the top of the capital to the statehouse grounds.  They reneged on the agreement- why is no one surprised?</p>
<p>They are too stupid to realize GA&rsquo;s flag is comprised of the Stars and Bars with the GA state seal superimposed on the left upper corner.  Too ignorant of history to realize that I suppose.</p>
<p>A mind is indeed a terrible thing not to have.</p>

			<p>Like the warning signs of a coming bad marriage, the assumptive new political dominants in America are showing their hand.  We can expect many statues removed, parks and historical battlegrounds renamed or removed from the national register and a wholesale persuit of things like repairations.  If elected, I predict that Barak Obama is going to be more busy controling the black drive for spoils than anything else.  It might even become the main cause for his presidency to fail. </p>

Does that mean that blacks leave the state?  Will they please boycott my state (I live everywhere in the U.S.)</p>
<p>I hear Africa needs a lot of help.  Maybe they could form a permanent rescue mission and go help their fellows?  What, they don&rsquo;t care about that?</p>

			<p>The NAACP is a menacing enemy to whites.  They even get away with overtly advertising their racism as the advancement of COLORED PEOPLE!  </p>
<p>At least Bush refused to associate with them for the greater part of his 2 terms.</p>
<p>Obama spoke at their national convention yesterday.</p>
<p>McCain is scheduled to address them (kiss their self-righteously bloated black bottoms) tomorrow.</p>
<p>We can look forward to hearing a lot more from them after the next election; guaranteed to be both infuriatingly offensive and exasperatingly tiresome.    </p>

			<p>The blacks whine about the Confederate flag and its supposed connections to a racist past and thus want it removed from sight for all time. Well, as a White person, I find about ninety-eight percent of the black &#8216;culture&rsquo; offensive, as do most other Whites but you never, ever hear of us clamoring for the removal of their crude music, appalling behavior, lawlessness, and so on. In fact, they themselves offend me, and so I hereby protest that they be removed from our (once-majestic) shores for all time. </p>
<p>By the way, imagine the hue and cry from liberal policians, misguided Hollywood celebrities and other assorted hand-wringers should a legitimate repatriation proposition arise. As much as we discuss the idea of a ninety-plus percent White America (as it should be), there is a small but vocal segment who would never allow it to happen, believing their racially &#8220;enlightened&#8221; views are superior to the truth.</p>

			<p>As a S. Carolinian, I can assure you the boycott has NOT AFFECTED anything.  Black Bike Week is still being held every May in Myrtle Beach, and the place is trashed after they leave.</p>
<p>One good thing to come of the boycott is Serena Williams and her racist family are no longer darkening our doorstep.</p>
<p>BTW- we fly the Stars and Bars and Big Red at our house.  I suggest everyone that is incensed by this do the same.  Pick your favorite confederate flag and let it fly!</p>

			<p>I said in a previous topic thread that Blacks must have a special kind of intelligence that we do not have, as different as the &#8220;intuitive&#8221; intelligence of a European leftie from the &#8220;rational&#8221; intelligence of a European rightie.</p>
<p>I believe that this Black intelligence is much like Marxism in this respect: All things that advance the goals of Blacks are righteous, and permitted, and are often dressed up in biblical language. </p>
<p>Even going back on an agreement.</p>
<p>However, (and this is where their special intelligence comes in) they can and will make it sound right, and their goal will be achieved because the decent Whites will be too befuddled, and the liberal Whites will be cheering them on.</p>
<p>So what is it that gets the liberal Whites on their side  &mdash;  White stupidity or that special sort of Black intelligence (or both)?</p>
<p>An afterthought: Maybe this special sort of Black intelligence is so, because it is not encumbered by morality, or truthfulness. But still, why do not &#8220;intelligent&#8221; Whites call them on it? The ones that try are met with the Black verbal equivalent of &#8220;Soul Train&#8221;  &mdash;  a flurry of verbal gyrations, bizarre verbal movements, and supercilious emotings. There are only a few White men who can nail them down, verbally, and keep them from squirming away.  </p>

			<p>The NAACP is like a dog with a bone with the flag issue.</p>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t there more important issues in the black community?</p>
<p>How about the 70% out of wedlock births.  How about the black kids who graduate high school and can&rsquo;t read their dipolma  and continue to speak Ebonics?  Also, the fact that blacks make up over 50% of the prison population while being just 13% of the general population.  <br>
I&rsquo;m sure the NAACP&rsquo;S response to these things will be to blame Whitey.  &#8220;All of our problems are because of racism and slavery and we want that flag down AND reparations.&#8221;</p>

Let&rsquo;s see&hellip; black on black crime and violence, black failure in school, black illegitimacy rates, AIDS, poor health habits, etc, VS. the Confederate Flag.</p>
<p>Black problems are intractable and unsolvable because blacks are blacks. It&rsquo;s easy to see why blacks rally around non-issues.</p>
<p>If we do away with The Flag, blacks will still have themselves as their source of their own problems and misery.</p>

<p>I have been boycotting restaurants where colored people work for years now. As a result, I have found establishments where only white people work. The dining experience has been much more pleasurable. It is my hope that more and more white people will join the boycott. Hit them in the wallet where it hurts.  <br>

<p>The real threat to our White Race, in my view, is substance abuse, and out of wedlocks births. We have got to stop destroying ourselves.  We are our own worst enemy.</p>

			<p>Drew&rsquo;s comments mirror my own findings. After the black lawsuit against Cracker Barrel, it began hiring all kinds of blacks, and service (speed, efficiency and politeness) went down the tubes per the increased number of blacks. </p>
<p>That led me to look carefully at the number of black workers in all restaurants, and the same pattern holds true. I have predicted the demise of three different restaurants because their staffs went nearly 50% black, and all came true within a year of the prediction.</p>

			<p>The Confederate battle flag is the Southern arrangement of the ancient St. Andrew&rsquo;s cross, which came to America from Scotland. It is hated by the Left because it is both an ancient Christian symbol (one that been important Russia, Greece, and Spain too) and a symbol of a European ethnic-national culture. </p>
<p>In cultural Marxism, some animals are infinitely more equal than others, and all European ethnic groups are decidedly unequal to the beloved, angelic non-whites. Therefore all symbols of such white groups, especially those symbols that are specifically Christian, must be warred against until they are exterminated.</p>

<p>Jake,<br>
That would mean that there are 39,000,000 blacks in the US. On a typical day in Philadelphia, it seems that there are that many. Maybe it just sounds that way.</p>
<p>But seriously, do you think that figure is lowballed? When&rsquo;s the last time they did a census? Where do they get that figure. </p>

			<p>As far as restaurants with a majority of black workers, they usually go out of business here because of poor food, poor service, etc.  And they include franchise chains also, such as Sonny&rsquo;s and Roadhouse Grill here.  It&rsquo;s a shame, what were once good restaurants became terrible and shut down. </p>

			<p>Actually from the standpoint of the African - American it is far better to have the flag than it is to remove it! As long as the flag flies the NAACP can point to it with disdain and disgust saying that its presence alone points to unequivocal racism among its supporters. </p>
<p>As the Very Most Reverend Jesse Jackson Ph.D  would (hypothetically) note:</p>
<p>&#8220;This representation of immense human suffering continues to fly over a land deeply divided over issues of race and one in which justice for all its citizens continues to be denied. This flag, this reaffirmation of the darkest hour of human suffering in our country&rsquo;s history, is a direct slap in the face of every man,  woman, and child of color, reminding them of their second class status as citizens, their second class status as beneficiaries, and their second class status as human beings. </p>
<p>This flag continues fly over a divided land. A land which daily reminds every citizen of color that the struggle is not over, that the promise land has not been reached, and that the vision of Dr. Martin Luther King Ph.D has not been realized.        </p>
<p>As long as the mindset of those who support this symbol remains unchanged additional effort by the federal government needs to be brought in the form of reparations to assist those of color, in changing an environment which is unfair to all its citizens.</p>
<p>As long as the mindset remains unchanged, affirmative action, welfare, Medicare, rent subsidies, aid to dependent children, social security, rebates, etc. need to be extended and increased until the year 2,065.</p>
<p>I am calling today for the Congress of the United States to pass a bill directing the State of South Carolina to compensate  every black man, woman, and child, in the amount of five hundred dollars per week for as long as this symbol of hated and subjugation continues to fly any where over this state&rsquo;s property.&#8221;  </p>

If you think blacks should be given money for a flag(ridiculous!)&hellip;&hellip; I want ALL blacks to compensate America for the cost of the Civil War adjusted for inflation plus interest.  Oh that&rsquo;s right, they most likely can not afford it because they are either in jail, spending all their money on drugs, illegal firearms, $5000 rims on a $500 car, or are on welfare.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t disagree with you more. Although I agree that there is a war against all of European ancestry, it doesn&rsquo;t hinge on Christianity or its symbols.  They are just an incidental historical insert.  In fact, Christianity has largely influenced the liberals who are at the forefront of the issue.  Nowhere in the New Testament does Jesus or anyone else speak for the preservation of any national identity, race or ethnic group.  In fact, what it does is require believers/followers to deny themselves and &#8220;love their enemies.&#8221;  Karl Marx converted to Christianity and used those principals for his communist manifesto.  The early Christian communities were communist in principal and function.  In fact, all the Catholic monestaries were too.  In the NT, Jesus scolds a disciple for not sharing, and what is the &#8220;miracle of the bread and fishes&#8221; if not collectivism?</p>
<p>Must I remind you that MLK was a Christian preacher?  Jesse Jackson is a Christian preacher, not a Black Muslim.</p>
<p>I copied part of the CNN article on White farmers being beaten in Zimbabwe yesterday exactly because it proves this point. Here it is;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mike Campbell moved in and out of consciousness, as Ben and Angela prayed   &mdash;   not for their lives, but for their captors. Freeth said he had never understood Luke 6:28   &mdash;   &#8220;Bless those who curse you&#8221;   &mdash;   until that moment, and a &#8220;supernatural&#8221; peace came over him.<br>
Freeth told God, &#8220;If I&rsquo;m going to be with you today, then I&rsquo;m ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>White Christian saps, ready to die as Christian martyrs rather than see their reality!</p>
<p>If Whites wish to survive as a group they are going to have to let go of &#8220;that old time religion, the makes you &#8220;love everybody,&#8221; and get tough.  If you must have a religion, let it be a true White indigenous one like Druidism.  Catholic priests basically immitate them anyway.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I am calling today for the Congress of the United States to pass a bill directing the State of South Carolina to compensate every black man, woman, and child, in the amount of five hundred dollars per week for as long as this symbol of hated and subjugation continues to fly any where over this state&rsquo;s property.&rdquo; </p>

<p>&gt;   The Constitution doesn&rsquo;t give people the right to compensation for being offended about anything.  The removal of that flag or any symbol you choose to not approve of doesn&rsquo;t change the feelings of anyone.  Until we are living under a Black dictator like Mugabe, we are free to choose and that means local governments too - the historic symbols that go with the experience of any region.  Next will be all the statues in the South commemorating CSA dead or any referrence to the CSA at all.  Like a communist/fascist takeover, all previous history of the conquered is usually destroyed.  Jesse Jackson&rsquo;s career depends upon that flag remaining where it is and he knows it.  He just loves to milk the issue for every drop he can get in recognition for himself.  I&rsquo;d like to snip his b@%%$ off. </p>

			<p>If all vestiges of the Confederacy are wiped clear, both physical evidence and historical, then the NAACP will have no way to prove that their ancestors were ever held in slavery in this country - no more reason to constantly complain.</p>
<p>I can, though, my ancestors were indentured servants, i.e. white slaves.</p>

			<p>Blacks that would deny simple rights like flying a flag don&rsquo;t deserve the most basic rights themselves</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;imagine the hue and cry from liberal policians, misguided Hollywood celebrities and other assorted hand-wringers should a legitimate repatriation proposition arise.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Speaking of repatriation, here&rsquo;s a site written by a woman who, along with her husband and kids, relocated to Ghana.  </p>
<p>One quote:  &#8220;Ironically, every Ghananian we spoke with wanted to go to the United States.&#8221; </p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t post this for her to be picked on or anything like that.  Just thought it was interesting to White Nationalists and other Amren posters.</p>

			<p>Excellent post, Whiteplight!</p>
<p>As you noted, Christianity plays both sides of the field, and each side blames the other for not being Christians or, at least, for not being the &#8220;real&#8221; Christians.</p>
<p>My current hypothesis, which I am now investigating, is that everything that we value in Christianity came from, or was already present in, European sensibilities.</p>
<p>The family, for instance. Jesus, in the New Testament, sounds anti-family to me! The concept of family is expanded into meaninglessness, where everyone who believes is your brother, regardless of race, IQ, level of industriousness, aesthetic sensibilities, etc. An acquaintance or a friend, maybe, but not a brother. Jesse Jackson and Rev. Al are not my brothers. Neither is that guy who does all that grinning, for that matter  &mdash;  Joel Osteen.</p>
<p>Dude, as a mystic, I am looking into more realistic expressions of European spirituality. </p>

			<p>The last time there was a supposed boycott of South Carolina over the Confederate Flag issue, my husband and I were at Carowinds Amusement park.  While waiting in line for one of the roller coasters, I started talking with a couple standing behind us.  They were black and I asked them how come they weren&rsquo;t boycotting SC.  The husband told me he didn&rsquo;t give one hoot about that flag issue, that he was at the park to have fun.</p>

			<p>Hmmm. The caption leading into the sarcastic rhetoric was:   </p>
<p>&#8220;As the very Most Reverend Jesse Jackson Ph.D. would (hypothetically) note&#8221; &hellip;.</p>
<p>The little speech that followed was a hypothetical speech that he might have made not I.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since you have asked for mine, indirectly, I would reply as follows:</p>
<p>There are those who would remove forever any historical reference to the one seminal and defining part of this state&rsquo;s great history simply because it &#8220;offends&#8221; one segment of the population vis a vie another. Has any thought whatsoever  been given to the segment whose forebears supported, fought for, and died in a vain effort under this battle flag?</p>
<p>Should these proud men and women&rsquo;s graves now be desecrated by the removal of a symbol which transcends history. Irrespective of whether or not you agree today with what you understand the confederacy to have stood for then, the irrepressible fact remains that it existed, and that it started here.   </p>
<p>Should we strip away forever black history month? Should we deny the accomplishments of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr? Simply because someone, somewhere, either is, or may be offended, in some way? No! But some would rip away the remaining vestiges of a proud symbol and discrete its memory.   </p>
<p>Rather than view this symbol as a symbol of injustice the African American should view this as a cornerstone in the process of atonement. It should represent to one and all that the African - American, who is always known for his or her sensitivity, is sensitive to the fact that to deny a part of a state&rsquo;s history for one part of its populace, is nothing less than an attempt to deny a part of a state&rsquo;s legitimacy to all.</p>
<p>Should white Carolinians now expect reparations by the northern horde of egregious land usurpers that migrated into the region shortly after the War of Secession? How about the off spring of the dead or marred and scared soldiers? How about the destruction of the Southern homes and property by the various union armies that took sadistic delight in the blatant destruction of beautiful southern plantations? We rebuilt Germany. We rebuilt Japan. We are rebuilding Iraq. But not one penny for the South was ever spent.  </p>
<p>In all fairness, there exists today innumerable reparations extended to African Americans by the federal government. Social security, welfare, aid to dependent children, medicare, medicade, no child left behind, food stamps, etc. etc. the list is endless for those fortunate enough to be born with a dark skin hue. </p>
<p>Consequently should a white citizen of the State of South Carolina be now left behind when reparations are being issued? Citizens who gave so much, suffered for so long, simply for being born white? Does white suffering count for naught? Is suffering unique to the black hand, forever being held out for perpetual compensation?</p>
<p>Is this equal protection under our constitution? Or any constitution for that matter?</p>
<p>I am calling today for a legal injunction to be issued against the NAACP and its subsidiaries preventing any and all transfers of assets. </p>
<p>I am calling today for the removal forever of the tax exempt status afforded to this organization. </p>
<p>Furthermore, I am calling today, that as punishment for its ultra vires, slanderous, and illegal activities, by and through the so called Reverend Jesse Jackson, that the NAACP be charged with providing five hundred dollars ($500.) to every white man, woman, and child within the great state of South Carolina in perpetuity, if and/or when, the state flag of South Carolina is either altered, amended, or removed!</p>

			<p>Not to veer to far off subject, but here is a review by Sam Francis of the book, The Germanization of Early Medieval Christianity. The book basically says that Europeans &#8220;European-ized&#8221; Christianity.<br>

			<p>&#8220;As a S. Carolinian, I can assure you the boycott has NOT AFFECTED anything. Black Bike Week is still being held every May in Myrtle Beach, and the place is trashed after they leave.&#8221;</p>
<p>    I have family that live in Myrtle Beach, and they sincerely wish that the blacks would boycott South Carolina, particularly the black bikers! Keep the flag flying I say. </p>

			<p>MoMo, no matter how obvious the sarcasm or satire, you have to state, even more clearly than you did, that your post is sarcasm or satire.  Some readers are as satirically-challenged as the average Obama supporter or are just in a hurry and don&rsquo;t read carefully.</p>
<p>Just type &#8220;/s&#8221; for &#8220;end (of) sarcasm&#8221; after any irony, sarcasm, parody, jest, or satire you post.  Saves time, trust me.</p>

<p>Dear 7:22 p.m. July 19</p>
<p>Thanks for the advice.  Apparently even our self imposed censor here doesn&rsquo;t understand all of my posts either as he or she is determined to decide for all of our collective members whether what I write is appropriate or inappropriate. </p>
<p>I particularly liked my view on NASCAR which was left on the  cutting room floor - but I suppose that is the prerogative of a critic that, while parroting and promoting individual freedoms (particularly freedom of expression), makes sure that the ultimate freedom, the power to decide my artistic life or death, lies in his&rsquo; or hers&rsquo; hand and not my own!</p>
