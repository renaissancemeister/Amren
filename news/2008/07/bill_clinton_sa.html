<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Bill Clinton is so bitter about Barack Obama&rsquo;s victory over his wife Hillary that he has told friends the Democratic nominee will have to beg for his wholehearted support.</p>
<p>Bill Clinton; Bill Clinton says Barack Obama must &lsquo;kiss my ass&rsquo; for his support</p>
<p>Mr Obama is expected to speak to Mr Clinton for the first time since he won the nomination in the next few days, but campaign insiders say that the former president&rsquo;s future campaign role is a &#8220;sticking point&#8221; in peace talks with Mrs Clinton&rsquo;s aides.</p>
<p>The Telegraph has learned that the former president&rsquo;s rage is still so great that even loyal allies are shocked by his patronising attitude to Mr Obama, and believe that he risks damaging his own reputation by his intransigence.</p>
<p>A senior Democrat who worked for Mr Clinton has revealed that he recently told friends Mr Obama could &#8220;kiss my ass&#8221; in return for his support.</p>
<p>A second source said that the former president has kept his distance because he still does not believe Mr Obama can win the election.</p>
<p>Mr Clinton last week issued a tepid statement, through a spokesman, in which he said he &#8220;is obviously committed to doing whatever he can and is asked to do to ensure Senator Obama is the next president of the United States &#8220;.</p>
<p>Mr Obama was more effusive at his unity event with Mrs Clinton on Friday, speaking fondly of the absent former president, who attended Nelson Mandela&rsquo;s birthday celebrations in London instead. The candidate told the crowd: &#8220;I know how much we need both Bill and Hillary Clinton as a party. They have done so much great work. We need them badly.&#8221;</p>
<p>But his aides said he has so far concentrated on cementing relations with Mrs Clinton first. They say they are content to let relations with Mr Clinton thaw gradually.</p>
<p>It has long been known that Mr Clinton is angry at the way his own reputation was tarnished during the primary battle when several of his comments were interpreted as racist.</p>
<p>But his lingering fury has shocked his friends. The Democrat told the Telegraph: &#8220;He&rsquo;s been angry for a while. But everyone thought he would get over it. He hasn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve spoken to a couple of people who he&rsquo;s been in contact with and he is mad as hell.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&rsquo;s saying he&rsquo;s not going to reach out, that Obama has to come to him. One person told me that Bill said Obama would have to quote kiss my ass close quote, if he wants his support.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&rsquo;t talk like that about Obama &mdash; he&rsquo;s the nominee of your party, not some house boy you can order around.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hillary&rsquo;s just getting on with it and so should Bill.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another Democrat said that despite polls showing Mr Obama with a healthy lead over Republican John McCain, Mr Clinton doesn&rsquo;t think he can win.</p>
<p>The party strategist, who was allied to one of the early rivals to Mr Obama and the former First Lady, said Mr Clinton was &#8220;very unhopeful&#8221; about the nominee&rsquo;s prospects in November.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bill Clinton knows the party will unite behind Obama, but he is telling people he doesn&rsquo;t believe Obama can win round voting groups, especially working-class whites, in the swing states,&#8221; the strategist said.</p>
<p>&#8220;He just doesn&rsquo;t think Obama will be able to connect with the voters he needs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joe Klein, the author of Primary Colours, a fictionalised account of Mr Clinton&rsquo;s 1992 election, who has known the former president for 20 years, said he also heard that he was &#8220;very, very bitter&#8221;, from people who have spoken with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s time for him to get over it or go off and do his charitable work. He knows the rules of the road. What&rsquo;s going on now is kind of strange. I think his behaviour is really, really shocking.&#8221;<br/>

&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t talk like that about Obama &mdash; he&rsquo;s the nominee of your party, not some house boy you can order around.&#8221;</p>
<p><br/>
In a properly-run America, Obama WOULD be the house boy and not the nominee. That way we&rsquo;d only have to worry about losing our silverware and not the whole country. </p>
<p>Also, please note the &#8220;You can&rsquo;t talk like that about Obama&#8221; diktat. Yet another Dhimmicrat who DEMANDS everybody be respectful and polite toward B. Hussein and treat him with kid gloves. Why? Because B. Hussein ISN&rsquo;T WHITE, that&rsquo;s why!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m no fan of anybody named Clinton, but for the first time in my life I feel like I have something in common with Bill: we&rsquo;re both furious over the ascendancy of BHO. I actually feel like buying the old scoundrel a beer. <br/>

			<p>For once, I hope the big liar is right. Actually, the prospect of either Obama or McCain in the White House is horrid to me, and I would have prefered the merely venal Senator Clinton to either. Still, McCain is tacitly white and he can count, so he will know the score if elected. Obama is anti-white, and he will happily count his non-white coalition and look for ways to stick it to da&rsquo; man.</p>

			<p>If they find this behavior shocking, what do they think about his mass murder spree of dozens of people to cover up his corruption and womanizing?</p>
<p>Do they mind that he raped juanita broderick and sexually assaulted kathleen willey and paula jones?</p>
<p>Do they mind that he&rsquo;s a serial liar, thief, and corrupt bribe taker?</p>
<p>How about his abuse of power when he killed hundreds of innocent branch dravidians?  Or when he had the ATF shoot an unarmed pregnant woman at ruby ridge because he didn&rsquo;t like her politics, then promoted the murderer?  Does any of this shock them?</p>
<p>What do they think of his unwillingness to capture bin laden even though his head was offered on a platter?  How about his bombing of empty tents and pharmaceutical factories as his bold response to the terror attacks leading up to 9/11?</p>
<p>Are they okay with a president whose sanctions killed a million innocent Iraqis while not producing any diplomatic gains against Saddam, and then whose secretary of state admitted the death toll and said it was &#8220;worth it&#8221; to 60 minutes?  What about his ridiculous invasions of somalia and haiti, his bombing of the serbs in a war we had no business in, or his selling nuclear secrets to china?  Is this shocking?</p>
<p>Or do democrats truly believe that the only crime on earth is thinking poorly of various designated victim groups, and EVERYTHING else is perfectly moral and okay?</p>

			<p>Bill Clinton is a typical White liberal who so fawned over African-Americans that he was called &#8220;The First Black President.&#8221;  And what did all his altruism, generosity and pandering get him?  Although he did his best to transcend race, Blacks returned the favor with a sharp slap to his face.  </p>
<p>Let this be a lesson to anyone who thinks that they can &#8220;work with Blacks.&#8221;  You can&rsquo;t! </p>
<p>Let this be a lesson to anyone who thinks that Whites and Blacks can come together to reach a common understanding.  It won&rsquo;t happen!  American society will either be dominant white, dominant Hispanic, or dominant black.  We only need to examine any African country or Black-majority USA city to see what the latter will look like.  </p>

			<p>Barack might have to kiss Bill&rsquo;s ass if people learn about S2433 which threatens US sovereignty and was sponsored by Obama. </p>
<p>We are already spending more money than any country in the world on foreign aid as we push into what is looking to be a serious recession. A recession caused by modern liberals and neo-conservatives and their myoptic policies which run contrary to the national interest. </p>
<p>S2433 wants to diminish our national sovereignty to the United Nations in a manner committing the U.S. to spending 0.7 percent of gross national product on foreign aid, which amounts to a phenomenal 13-year total of $845 billion over and above what the U.S. already spends. Other troubling propositions in S2433 are present as well.</p>
<p>Note: Please phone, email, and write your elected representives asking them to vote NO on S2433 and any legislation which resembles it.</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;big plan&#8221; seems to be for all of us to come together into a radical liberal worldview with Obama as our Messiah leader and those that refuse to be persecuted for their unwillingness to surrender their beliefs, morals, ethics, and values to the &#8220;big plan&#8221;. The purpose of all this appears to be so that we can corporately deny ourselves and suffer for the good of the money in the greatest government funded give away in the history of the world (at our expense of course). In my understanding, that&rsquo;s the &#8220;big plan&#8221;. </p>

			<p>  The Clinton-Obama situation points up one of the big problems with party politics. You run in the primary, you tell the voters all the ways your opponent is not fit to be the nominee   &mdash;   and then if you lose, you&rsquo;re expected to fall right into line, talk about how wonderful your opponent has suddenly become, and how voters should cast their ballots for him instead for (yuk!) the loser from that OTHER party.</p>
<p>  The way I look at it, Bill Clinton is at least refusing to be a hypocrite. He&rsquo;s still furious over how he feels his wife was treated unfairly by the media, he refuses to be impressed by St. Barack, and he&rsquo;s balking at demands that he be a good, loyal party hack. I say, good for him. I think Obama is a mountebank and a charlatan, too.</p>

			<p>Bill, surely you realize it was yours and the Democratic Party&rsquo;s policies towards blacks and other nonwhites that led to Obama&rsquo;s ascendancy?  Yes, he&rsquo;s a weak candidate and he&rsquo;ll probably lose by a landslide.  A hundred scandals against McCain won&rsquo;t change the odds, most people simply will not vote for a black candidate.  </p>

<p>Great post.  As much as I despise BHO, I despise the Clinton&rsquo;s just as much.  The two of them are power hungry sociopaths who will stop at nothing to gain power and to further their new world agenda.</p>
<p>As far as I am concern, Hil got her comeuppance.</p>
<p>His remark will do nothing except split the Dem&rsquo;s along racial lines (as if they weren&rsquo;t already) and help John McCain.</p>

			<p>I would just like to say to any white Democrats out there who have ambitions of someday becoming president, that it&rsquo;s time for you to give up those dreams. Henceforth, you must have a proper regard for the sacred principles of multiculturalism and affirmative action, which means you must relinquish all of your political ambitions &hellip; but you can still lick envelopes and do door-to-door canvassing for the black candidate of your choice. </p>

			<p>It couldn&rsquo;t happen to a more deserving pair then the Clintons. They have spent their entire public lives pandering to blacks and screwing over their fellow Whites. Now they are getting a taste of their own medicine. The Clintons were stunned at how fast blacks deserted them to rally to Obama&rsquo;s standard. They had assumed they would capture a large percentage of the black vote. Partly because of this miscalculation they didn&rsquo;t take Obama seriously enough in the beginning. Thus after a lifetime of pandering to blacks they are tossed aside as blacks answer the tribal racial call. Serves them right!</p>

<p><br/>
I agree.  And what I think it points to is not the possibility of a victory of either one - but, rather, it points to the absolute victory of the REAL OWNERS of this Country.</p>
<p>To use an analogy from the Movies, 2008 was the year that the camera moved back far enough for the audience to see the Director, or, group of Directors, and it became clear once and for all that this IS a movie, a very bad movie, and that the people in front of the camera are merely Actors reading from a script they didn&rsquo;t write, and playing a part that, though they may have auditioned for, didn&rsquo;t create.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to tell if they are aware of the fact that their audience is dwindling; and if they ARE aware, the next question is, Do they know the reason it&rsquo;s dwindling? And if they know that, the next question is, Do they care?<br/>
I think the answer is to the first question is &#8220;Yes&#8221; and to the second, &#8220;No.&#8221;<br/>
In fact, not only do they not care, but they are waiting for us to leave the Theatre because they&rsquo;ve recruited a new audience. Of course, they seem oblivious to the fact that the new audience is filled with a disparate group of people who don&rsquo;t like each other, and are more than willing to tear up the Theatre and rush the stage.</p>

			<p>For probably the first time ever, I have to admit I totally agree with William T. Clinton. On the need for The Obamination to kiss WTC&rsquo;s royal arse, and that Obama might make a decent showing but cannot hope to win the presidency.</p>
<p>Facing facts&hellip; Obama comes across as being just as much a liar as Hillary OR Bill Clinton. Neither of these three &#8216;worthies&rsquo; has much credibility with a large part of the American population. And with ample good reason.</p>
<p>I have no use for that GWB Clone, McCain, but have a lot more faith in McCain in a real crisis than I possibly could have in Obama&rsquo;s handling of one. Even Hillary would be a far better choice in that kind of scenario.</p>
<p>Obama and McCain are open borders/pro-amnesty freaks. In spite of any seeming backtracking now that the rubber meets the road.</p>
<p>Obama would tend to strongly favor Blacks and is actively pandering to the Hispanics by kissy kissing up to the illegals as well as those hispanics now American citizens. What I find incredulous is that given Blacks are the first to be adversely impacted by illegal immigration, so why would BLACKS support a man betraying their cause? Is the average Black American REALLY THAT STUPID? No, don&rsquo;t bother answering it for me. i can guess.</p>
<p>I recall our &#8216;friend&rsquo;, Williams the Plumber, crowing in one of his posts he&rsquo;d hire an illegal Mexican instead of a Black American. A sentiment, for better or worse, echoed by many corporate and mid-sized business personnel managers. Blacks are notorious for lacking a work ethic; a fact not lost on hiring managers and HR personnel. Besides which, hiring a Hispanic, even if they doubt the legitimacy of the guy&rsquo;s papers and claims, still gets the hiring manager off the hook for not hiring enough   minorities. So really what does the average underskilled, under-educated Black American gain by voting for a man betraying his best interests? Like they say: Go figure!</p>

<p>Whether we want to admit it or not, there are alot of republicans who are dissatisfied with John McCain as well.</p>

<i>How about his abuse of power when he killed hundreds of innocent branch dravidians?</i></p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t kill them, they committed suicide. </p>
<p>Maybe it was wrong to storm the compound, but let&rsquo;s  call a spade a spade.</p>
<p>If it wasn&rsquo;t a suicide then why didn&rsquo;t they run out when the place caught fire? Don&rsquo;t tell me the escape route of every single one of them was blocked.</p>
<p>If some of them had survived then no doubt there would have been dissidents who would have eventually revealed what had been going on inside the compound, and I&rsquo;ll bet it wouldn&rsquo;t have been pretty. No doubt this is why they were all ordered to &#8220;drink the Kool Aid.&#8221;</p>
<p>I resent the implication that one must be in favor of the Branch Davidians in order to be racially aware.</p>

It is hysterical that the Clinton franchise has been brought to a shuddering halt by a beneficiary of the &#8220;diversity is good&#8221; philosophy.</p>

<p>Well, that is a rather intolerant stance there Comrade Clinton!</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t ironic that this oversexed old fool and champion of diversity, seems so very bitter at the defeat of his wife at the hands of this mulatto? Why shouldn&rsquo;t he be just overjoyed at the historic significance, of the second black president being elected; could it be that he is jealous?</p>

<p>.  .  . is the part where Clinton says Obama can&rsquo;t win. Reportedly, Hillary said the same thing to Bill Richardson in a private phone call. Even if it is a self-serving statement, it is reassuring to have an experienced Democratic politician say this when he thinks no one is listening. Bill, I hope you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>P.S. Note to Fed Up  &mdash;   Clinton&rsquo;s middle name is Jefferson. WTC means World Trade Center (RIP).</p>

			<p>Could you just imagine the possibilities if the American left were to become so pissed off at minorities that they returned to white, America first pseudo fascism like was dominant prior to both world wars (see Liberal Fascism for more info).  Blacks and those white elites that love them so much, have ROYALLY stabbed in the back, the rest of the loose coalition of malcontents that have always controlled the dems&hellip;.and attempted to marginalize them.  If they lose the upper hand, perhaps by an Obama campaign that goes up in flames, it will have to have them questioning the wisdom of empowering blacks.  Especially with someone as ruthless and vindictive as Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>This is especially important given the fact that so many are awakening to the truth about minorities.</p>
<p>The situation has&hellip;.potential.</p>

Bill Clinton got to be president because he kissed black butt and in his mind, they owe him for all he&rsquo;s given them to brag about.</p>
<p>Wake up and smell the African roast coffee, Bill. Whatever you think you did for blacks can in no way make up for the fact that you&rsquo;re not black.</p>
<p>Bill Clinton is a race traitor who has discovered he&rsquo;s been hoodwinked. He used blacks but in the end, they turned the table and used him. He&rsquo;s a man without a race to associate with.</p>

			<p>Tim in Indiana,</p>
<p>Many that died in the Waco fiasco were children.  Your argument that those children committed suicide in absurd.  When you have kids in the compound you have to treat them as hostages.  You don&rsquo;t just set it on fire and then say, well gee they should have run out.  Also, the FBI/ATF, after first denying, eventually admitted they used incendiary devices when they stormed the compound.  They admitted the flames went up much to quickly and many in the compound were trapped.  Judge Napolitano in his book &#8220;Constitutional Chaos,&#8221; called it murder.  I would hope that those responsible at least have the decency to regret setting it on fire which resulted in so many deaths.</p>

This was the most gestapo type event in the history of America. Had those Davidians and Timothy Mcvey been Islamic, Mcvey would be a martyr. Instead Janet Reno, the ATF, and Mcvey, were all cold blooded murderers, however only Mcvey has been brought to justice, &#8220;In this life&#8221;. The others are awaiting their fate. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Mr Obama was more effusive at his unity event with Mrs Clinton on Friday, speaking fondly of the absent former president, who attended Nelson Mandela&rsquo;s birthday celebrations in London instead.&#8221; (from original article).  </p>
<p>It looks like Bill Clinton is the houseboy. And if he acts up too much, he&rsquo;s just going to be sent out to the fields. This is the New America.</p>
<p>Most of the people who don&rsquo;t like Obama can&rsquo;t stand Bill Clinton either, and lots of those people are not yet able to be honest with themselves about race, and so still like to think of themselves as being &#8220;anti-racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>So if Bill&rsquo;s anger begins to be interpreted as having a racial component  &mdash;  everyone is going to be fighting with everyone! Which will happen soon enough anyway with a black president with a wife prone to mouthing off. (If Hillary was unpopular as first lady, Michelle is really going to be a hit!)</p>
<p>Interesting times ahead, with real possibilities for increased white consciousness. Fasten your seat belts and hang on.</p>

<p>I just don&rsquo;t believe all the negative things written about them.  Political pundits and journalists say and write anything and they have their reasons.  If you and I were famous people there would probably be many fictional stories written with info from our supposed inner circle, all painting a negative picture, unless we are black or Mestizo, of course, then we can do no wrong!</p>
<p>Anyway, if Bill actually said this vulgar comment, I am disappointed because I do believe all Presidents should be gentlemen and not use coarse language.  Let&rsquo;s give Bill the benefit of the doubt and not believe he actually said this unless it is proven, such as with Mr. Clinton saying it again while videotaped.</p>

The NSA/CIA/DIA/FBI and organizations unnamed run this country. Let&rsquo;s call them the Power Control Group. <br/>
I wonder if Hillary&rsquo;s comment about RFK wasn&rsquo;t a bit of subliminal warning to the people.   I also sense a great deal of rubber in the character of Obama. He&rsquo;ll bend pretty quick.</p>

			<p>So, absent the active support of Bill Clinton, those thousands of fine little OBAMANDROIDS and OBAMABOTS will bravely have to stiffen their resolve and work a little harder. If they hope to get their Lying Messiah into the White House. Considering the distaste Obama evokes among many THINKING Americans, I have to concede our schools are doing an excellent job of producing millions of hopelessly brainwashed young people   &mdash;   incapable of absorbing hard facts, then reasoning based on facts. Instead of blindly swallowing the lies they&rsquo;re exhorted to believe by their Mulatto Messiah.</p>
<p>The sublime irony is that were the Republicans able to produce anything other an a geriatric doddering clone of G.W.B., they wouldn&rsquo;t even have to campaign much to win the election.</p>
<p>Americans desperately need a third-party mindful of its obligation to the American people rather than special interest groups. That our presidential hopefuls are modern carricatures of Larry, Moe and Curly convinces me the sun is setting on our once proud American nation and we are heading for the long darkness. A feeling not dispelled by our insane governmental policy of letting America become overrun with third-worlders draining our resources, burdening our infrastructure and bringing little other than vast volumes of crime to our society.</p>

			<p>Everybody please note:  This is the first in what is going to be the come uppence and stark revelation of white liberals.</p>
<p>The Clintons have been brainwashed zombies to anyone and  anything non-white, blindly supporting any left wing radical cause that seeks to unfairly advance minorities some way.  And there is no doubt they expected to be worshipped and idolized by them through all eternity.  I mean, after all, didn&rsquo;t Clinton delight in calling himself the first black president?</p>
<p>Now almost every non-white supporter has jumped ship and embarked on Captain Obama&rsquo;s African vessel, because all along it was race loyalty the has always placed first, last and always with these people.  Wanting equality really meant having control to them all along.  These goofy white liberals are good for them only for as long as they&rsquo;re useful.  It was they who caused Hillary&rsquo;s defeat.  Because she ignored whites in favor of non-whites, she had few white supporters, only the militant, mentally deranged feminists and a few union, blue collar types.  </p>
<p>If the Clinton&rsquo;s ever take time for reflection they have just got to be choking at the realization that they were being used by non-whites as much as they were using them.  Revenge is so sweet.</p>
<p>And take heart, my friends, there will be other white liberals who will come to learn how utterly foolish and naive they have been all along.</p>
<p>The only thing I can think of that would be more entertaining would be to see an armed civil war between all Democrats, shown on live T.V.  They could call it the battle of the Diversitoids against Racial Homogeneity.</p>

			<p>Bill Clinton is a typical white guy, only more so.  He naturally resists mixing.  He doesn&rsquo;t live around blacks or hang around them.  He had numerous sexual affairs, but never one with a black woman.  He refused to send his kid to school with blacks.  He made sure he did not have a black doctor involved in his heart surgery.  He used blacks as fronts, but never considered blacks advice on important matter, such as how to get elected or avoid impeachment, although he displayed them like lawn jockeys to get elected.  </p>
<p>Regarding Bill and Janet Reno&rsquo;s slaughter of peaceful men, women and children in Waco, Texas, I would like to add the name of Chuck Schumer.  His main claim to fame is trying to disarm law abiding Americans so that they can be easily robbed and killed.</p>
<p>To derail the Congressional investigation into Reno&rsquo;s and her federal troops&rsquo; murder of innocent Americans, Schumer forced a little twelve year old girl to tell the world in detail over national TV how she was raped.  I saw this on TV, he grilled her on specifics, and she said that she &ldquo;closed her eyes&rdquo; when it happened.  </p>

<p>Bill Clnton did have affiars with several Black women. One was Lencola Sullivan, a former Miss Arkansas who was fourth runner up in the 1980 Miss America Pageant.</p>
<p>He also had relationships with lesser known Black women, including some who worked on his staff when he was governor of Arkansas.</p>
<p>He was also known to have a wandering eye for a supposedly beautiful Black women who was member of a prominent Black family in Washington D.C. in the early 1990s during his early years as president.</p>
<p>While the national media has largely been silent on these interracial liasons, it was common knowledge in Arkansas when I lived there for 20 years.    </p>
<p>Although I do agree with you aobut Bill Clinton and his tretment of Blacks. He did manipualte them to his own advantage and they seemed to have no problem with it or they were to ignorant to realize what he was doing.</p>

<p>&#8220;A senior Democrat who worked for Mr Clinton has revealed that he recently told friends Mr Obama could &#8220;kiss my ass&#8221; in return for his support.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, the article has such a strong ring of truth and I&rsquo;m pretty much willing to believe it, but chances are that whoever &#8220;fed&#8221; it wants to hurt the Clinton campaign. Much of Shirpwell&rsquo;s recent work on the telegraph has had a focus on Obama/Clinton relations. The question is whether there&rsquo;s any embellishment; since it&rsquo;s written as an &#8220;inside source&#8221; piece, it&rsquo;s pretty much impossible to prove and impossible to disprove unless it&rsquo;s on tape somewhere. Maybe this is just another supporter leaving her for Barry?</p>
<p>But to some extent, the quote just provides an excuse to paint a picture that holds together pretty well, so we&rsquo;ll have to keep an eye on the mending - or attempt at mending - of relations between the clintons and obama.</p>

But White liberals should understand that when they fake reality for decades concerning black abilities, achievements, college education etc., one day the PC brainwashing and double-think/double-standards of America will succeed so well that their black (and soon, hispanic) proteges will be able to take over without needing said White libs. What a shock to the &#8220;first black Prez!&#8221;&hellip; As  Anne Coulter says, the soccer moms will vote for the cosmopolitan foreigner, B. Hussein, &#8216;cuz they think he&rsquo;s cute. Perhaps if the Socialist Kenyan Scarecrow wins, that will shock American Whites of all political persuation into abandoning the great lie of absolute equality, and the great crime of trying to FORCE EQUAL RESULTS rather than simply enable equal OPPORTUNITY.</p>
<p> Note, too, that given current trends it&rsquo;s only a question of time before we&rsquo;re ruled by Asians (Indians, Chinese etc.) who are far more intelligent than most blacks or hispanics, and whose academic and business achievements are real, not faked.<br/>
We&rsquo;ve got to return to some sort of European preferences in our immigration laws (or ask China and India to allow Whites to immigrate there en masse   &mdash;  - AS IF!&hellip;.)</p>

			<p>Billary have clearly overrated their importance in the world.</p>
<p>Billary can KMA</p>
<p>Elizabeth Dole would have been a good first woman President.  Sandrah O&rsquo;Connor might have been as well, or my mother.</p>
<p>Even among Democrats, my old high school girlfriend would have been a good one.  Four to eight more years of Billary would have been even more hideous than a Bush Dynasty.</p>
<p>Why is it our elections have turned into freak-shows?</p>

			<p>If Bill Clinton did in fact say these things, then I can see his thinking behind it.  Incumbants for the most part remain their parties nominee during the next election cycle.  Hillary is obviously NOT going to be the democratic nominee for 2008, and if Obama wins the presidency, then Hillary is out in 2012 also.  Bill and Hillary&rsquo;s best chance at the White House in 2012 is for Bill to sabotage Obama&rsquo;s chances in 2008 by stirring dissension amongst democrat voters.  At the same time, Hillary plays the loyal democrat that refuses to break party rank or talk bad of the black nominee.  A &#8221;Good Cop, Bad Cop&#8221; scenario.  If a fraction of those loyal to Bill, but not necessarily Hillary, become less enthused for Obama as a result of Bill, then McCain&rsquo;s chances of winning in 2008 increase.  In 2012, Hillary should then have a chance to become president in a landslide since she will once again have the black vote in her pocket (since BHO probably won&rsquo;t be running), as well as the votes of the new latino citizens, courtesy of McAmnesty, who will be too old to run for a 2nd term.  Meanwhile, by Hillary taking the high ground and publicly supporting Obama, she maintains her status with the Democratic &#8221;elites&#8221;, setting the stage for 2012.  Bill may be a race traitor and be of low moral character, but he is definitely not stupid.  Does this scenario seem logical?  If not, where am I mistaken?</p>

			<p>William:</p>
<p>You forgot about the attractive Black Little Rock anchorwoman who seemed to coincidentally &#8220;got transferred&#8221; to St.Louis in 1991 once allegations of an affair between her and Clinton were leaked to the Arkansas Gazette and other state newspapers.</p>
<p>Remember how the story was quickly hushed up.</p>
<p>The liberal baby boom press realized that their golden boy would have never had the chance to become president had this been exposed.</p>
<p>I hear that he is still cheating on his wife!</p>
<p>Bill Clinton was a dog and will always be a dog!!!!</p>

William, the &ldquo;supposedly beautiful Black women who was member of a prominent Black family in Washington D.C.&rdquo; is just too good to be true.  Sounds like the Clinton spin machine telling blacks that what I said, that Bill can&rsquo;t stand blacks<br/>
, was not true.  </p>
<p>Although Bill Clinton is the kind of man that could go for just about anything, there is no real evidence that he had black women for sex partners, despite the, &ldquo;common knowledge in Arkansas….&rdquo;</p>
<p>White women came forward.  There was lots of money to be made.  Are we to believe that black women are so protective of their good names that they refuse to publicly admit to a sexual affair with the President of the United States?  Or believe that the black prominent family stands alone against every other black in America that finds recreational sex the black American pastime, and refuses to soil their daughter&rsquo;s immaculate reputation?  </p>
<p>No if Bill had a black sex partner, she&rsquo;d be first in line at the tabloids to cash in. <br/>

			<p> Juan McAmnesty (aka john McCain) could still beat B. hussein Obama in november if he chooses a consevative w/o close ties to bush as a runnung mate./ Someone like Pawlenty or Romney would shore up the Rep. base and help him win states in the midwest like mich and mn. And to top that off, McCain is quite old and may not run again leaving Romney or pawlenty as the heir apparent. Bill deserves to see his wife lose to a minority, after all, didn&rsquo;t he say as pres. that in time america will lose its dominate Euro. majority? </p>

			<p> I do not have any sympathy for the Clinton`s. They have pandered to the Black Community all their political careers. They pushed Affirmative Actions to the max. Now their product challenges them and they are upset. i heard Bill Clinton say he expected to see a Black President in his life time. This was when he was running for reelection against Bob Dole. He was in a slam dunk position so he could talk big. The thing about White Liberals and their Affirmative Actions Programs they never  gave up anything they had, instead they took what little the blue collar working white worker had and gave some to the minorities. It is not rich people like the Kennedys whose kids get denied into an education program or a job, but the white working class person`s kid. I am not against anybody having a job or an education. I just see when hiring preferences are made based on race then it is the lower income white guy who gives. I hope the Clintons are real mad now they know know how some of their own have felt, except Hillary Clinton was beat fair and square. Senator went by the rules the Democrat Party established, he simply beat her. Let the Clintons cry, they will get over it just as I am sure other people who have been cut out by their programs got-over it.</p>

			<p>P. Noctura:</p>
<p>Bill Clinton&rsquo;s affair with former miss Arkansas Lencola Sullivan was well known in Arkansas. He also hgad a relationship with Elizabeth Ward, a former Miss Arkansas who was also Miss America 1982. I also heard stories about the anchorwoman as well. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about the D.C. woman.</p>
<p>You are correct,there were a few White women who came forward, but many more did not for fear of reprisal. I also believe that the &#8220;liberal&#8221; media made an effort not to expose his relationships with Black women. Even they were savvy enough to know that it would be frowned upon if he ever desired to be elected to public office.</p>

			<p>As for who owns Obama. The super rich liberals. They know they couldn&rsquo;t` control Hillary so they backed him. They know McCain will do it his way, after all he will most likely be a one term president with his age so he will be his own man. He has plenty of money and can`t be bought. Obama has been bought and paid for, polished up and properly packaged for the American Public. This is one guy who isn&rsquo;t`t buying. It is that simple. </p>

These two pathetic social climbing baby boomers did so much damage to American citizens rights, Ruby Ridge, Waco, Cloak and Dagger Chinese &#8220;deals&#8221;, etc.etc. that I&rsquo;m just loving their humiliation, though I&rsquo;d never vote for the racist, affirmative action empowered Obama&rsquo;s.</p>

Yes, but that was just meant for the masses, not the elites!  They didn&rsquo;t expect to see the white RULING class get shoved aside by some upstart  &#8220;minority&#8221; type. This scenario is not going according to plan!</p>
<p>Their own programs which have produced Affirmative Action creatures like Obama have sneaked up behind them and are now biting them in the rear.</p>
<p>Ho, ho, ho!  I&rsquo;m starting to enjoy this spectacle.  The Clintons are now getting it from the blacks, and I can&rsquo;t wait to see the same thing happen to the Bushes and McCains, coming from the Hispanics whom they love so dearly.</p>

Cop, It seems PERFECTLY logical to me. I don&rsquo;t think you are mistaken at all.</p>
<p>As for Barry, who scolds Native of Arkansas:  <i> &#8220;You do not call a former president a dog!!  Show the man some respect! He is a former president!&#8221; </i> &hellip;   I would agree that one should show the TITLE its due  respect;  but as for the MAN, I would have to agree with Native of Arkansas.  Respect must be earned. That man defiled the presidency; and anyone who still respects him (the &#8220;man&#8221;) after his shenanigans in office has to be a robot capable of learning nothing. </p>
