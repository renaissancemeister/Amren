						<p>A new poll suggests Canadians would prefer to vote for Barack Obama rather than cast a ballot for their own political leaders, while 45 per cent of Americans envy Canada&rsquo;s health care system.</p>
<p>The bi-national survey, conducted by the Strategic Counsel for CTV and The Globe and Mail, showed that here in Canada, Obama was more admired than Prime Minister Stephen Harper &mdash; or any other national leader.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some would read (the results) as an indictment of our political leaders,&#8221; the Strategic Counsel&rsquo;s Peter Donolo told CTV.ca. &#8220;Others would say it&rsquo;s an acknowledgement of the phenomenal nature of Obama&rsquo;s appeal. He really is a prototype of his own; he&rsquo;s broken the mold.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stephane Dion trailed far behind the other leaders, just ahead of Republican presidential nominee John McCain:</p>
<p>* Barack Obama: 26 per cent<br>
* Stephen Harper: 21 per cent<br>
* Hillary Clinton: 16 per cent<br>
* Jack Layton: 9 per cent<br>
* Gilles Duceppe: 6 per cent<br>
* Stephane Dion: 5 per cent<br>
* John McCain: 3 per cent</p>
<p>Obama appealed to people across Canada&rsquo;s political spectrum, with 24 per cent of conservative-minded voters choosing him and 28 per cent of liberal thinkers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there&rsquo;s a sense in Canada that we&rsquo;re in a rut with our political situation, and I think there&rsquo;s a fatigue with the nature of politics in Ottawa as we watch it through question period &mdash; the very cranky, minority-government style politics. There&rsquo;s a little more envy than usual south of the border,&#8221; said Donolo.</p>
<p>This recent poll by The Strategic Counsel surveyed 1,000 Canadians and 1,000 people in the United States.</p>
<p>When it came to health care, 45 per cent of Americans felt Canada had a superior system, while 42 per cent thought the United States should stick with its own.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the vast majority of Canadians, 91 per cent, felt that Canada&rsquo;s health care system was better than the United States.</p>
<p><b>Canada tilts to the left</b></p>
<p>When Canadian respondents were asked how to define their political views, regardless of how they actually vote, slightly more than half described themselves as liberal:</p>
<p>* Very liberal: 12 per cent<br>
* Liberal: 39 per cent<br>
* Conservative: 38 per cent<br>
* Very conservative: 3 per cent</p>
<p>Respondents in the United States were slanted in the other direction, and also had more people who considered themselves on the extreme right of the political spectrum:</p>
<p>* Very conservative: 10 per cent<br>
* Conservative: 47 per cent<br>
* Liberal: 30 per cent<br>
* Very liberal: 7 per cent</p>
<p>&#8220;In general, I think on a lot of issues the United States are a more polarized society,&#8221; said Donolo. &#8220;When you look at the number of how many hardcore conservatives there are in the U.S., it&rsquo;s a pretty significant number.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Gay marriage</b></p>
<p>The same poll also suggested Canadians are far more liberal than Americans, with 70 per cent supporting gay marriage.</p>
<p>When it came to gay marriage, 68 per cent of Canadians backed supported it, while 28 per cent were against it. In 2005, when the government was considering whether to repeal the gay marriage bill, 55 per cent were in favour of gay marriage.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think this points to the reality being a lot less threatening to people than the concept. As people have gotten used to the issue, there&rsquo;s been less anxiety over it,&#8221; said Donolo.</p>
<p>Aside from being more politically right-of-centre, Americans also appear to be more religious.</p>
<p>Respondents in the United States went to religious services more frequently than Canadians:</p>
<p>* Every week or almost every week: Canada 23 per cent, U.S. 46 per cent<br>
* Once a month: Canada 8 per cent, U.S. 11 per cent<br>
* A couple of times a year: Canada 27 per cent, U.S. 16 per cent<br>
* Never or hardly ever: Canada 42 per cent, U.S. 27 per cent</p>
<p><b>Technical notes</b></p>
<p>The poll was conducted between June 12-22 by The Strategic Counsel for CTV and The Globe and Mail.</p>
<p>The sample size was 1,000 people in each country. A proportionate random national sample has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.<br>

			<p>Obama doesn&rsquo;t have an appeal. Obama is truely a dark horse candidate. He has not been around long enough for people to learn anything bad about him. Let&rsquo;s wait and see if he is still popular after a couple of years when gas is $10 a gallon and two new wars have begun. What people really don&rsquo;t like is the situation they find themselves in and they blame the old order. </p>
<p>I think it was Mark Twain that said people don&rsquo;t go to the polls to vote for someone they go to vote against someone. </p>

			<p>Wonderful.  Can we just send Obama up to Canada and let him govern there?  It would free us of his personality cult, and he&rsquo;d have a hard time doing anything that would mess up Canada any worse than it already is.</p>

			<p>As a Canadian, I can confirm that for the most part they are pretty stupid.  Liberal left leaning brain dead males and feminazis.</p>
<p>We are doomed here in Canada as well as most of what was settled by western europeans.</p>

			<p>B. Hussein Obama is just barely more of an &#8220;American&#8221; than he is a &#8220;Canadian;&#8221; a run for something in the Great White North wouldn&rsquo;t be markedly more ridiculous than BHO&rsquo;s posturing as some kind of &#8220;American.&rsquo;</p>

			<p>I have to say that although I have some Canadian friends, and have loved many artists (musicians, etc.) from Canada, they are a terribly credulous people. They are as ill-prepared for the imigrant wave that will crush and smother them, as were those New Zealand birds that could be clubbed, eaten or captured without even running away. Those poor birds, innocent and wonderful, had no knowledge of predators. They had no frame of reference for something that would hurt them. <br>
Of course, human beings-especially those of good, stolid, intelligent stock should be held accountable for their own stupidity. Innocent birds have an excuse. The endngered Cannuck&hellip;does not.</p>

<p>Anyone that finds B. Hussein Osama appealing is not remotely conservative-minded, they are a marxist!</p>
<p>&#8220;Obama is truely a dark horse candidate. He has not been around long enough for people to learn anything bad about him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nonsense. He&rsquo;s been around more than long enough for anyone with an IQ over room temperature to see that he&rsquo;s a fellow traveller. Let&rsquo;s see: Wright, Pfleger, Ayers, Rezko, two white-hating autobiographies, the most leftist voting record in the U.S. senate, a leftist record in Illinois state senate, a black supremacist wife, a Muslim stepfather, a kool aid-drinking mother, a Muslim name, a Muslim cousin who ran for office in Kenya (with whom B.H.O. is tight), a protegé of communist Saul Alinsky, a history of &#8220;community organizing&#8221; (read marxist agitation), a record of flip-flopping equal to that of John Kerry&hellip;and on and on we could go. There&rsquo;s more than enough there for anyone who chooses to look.</p>
<p>That someone like Osama could get nominated speaks to the sheer stupidity of a large segment of the American population. I can excuse the blacks because they will always vote tribally, but there is no excuse for the self-loathing white leftists going orgasmic over this great big nobody. They are the lowest of the low.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also telling that you can get elected on superficialities and five second sound bites. This man has ZERO substance, zilch, nada, zip. He&rsquo;s a walking platitude. I have no patience for people who say that most voters haven&rsquo;t got time to become familiar with the candidates. Anyone with ten minutes to spare and an internet connection can figure out that Osama would be a disaster for the U.S. Richard Lynn and others are right: the dysgenic chickens are coming home to roost, and we&rsquo;re seeing the results of half a century of idiotic immigration policy, generous welfare, and cultural marxism.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obama feeds off of White Guilt in Canada just like he does in the USA.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed. It&rsquo;s a miracle that a centrist like Harper even managed to get elected in this country, and only with a slim minority after all the stars aligned.</p>

			<p>Canada is where the Northern states were in 1950, clueless about race and very liberal. If we repeat what the South did and send our Blacks North will it wake Canada up? </p>
<p>It seems that the rest of the White world follows the White Northern states bad example. </p>

<p>So America&rsquo;s 10% &#8220;hard-core conservatives&#8221; cause division and polarization, but Canada having 12% &#8220;hard-core liberals&#8221; is fine and dandy.</p>

			<p>Too bad we can&rsquo;t let them have good ole Hussein. I think he is a perfect fit for those socialists. 45% of Americans envy Canada&rsquo;s health care system, where the hell did they come up with that? I guess you can rig a pole to catch whatever fish you are after.</p>

			<p>Obama was bearly elected to run the nomination of the dem party. Hell he did&rsquo;nt even beat Clinton, Clinton had more votes then Obama. It gose to show how rigged the elections are here in America thats Clinton who had 18 million votes. Clinton who beat Obama in Votes by about a million people, still loss. Obama was not elcted the Dem nom, he was given it. He did not win the votes or the popular votes. He won because the dem party electorals voted him in. People must remember that 95% of blacks and a majority of the hispanic vote dem. </p>
<p>Obama won the dem nom, because 98% and a great deal of hispanics and white marxist voted for him. Even with their support he still could&rsquo;nt beat Clinton who had 1 million more votes then Obama. </p>
<p>So people don&rsquo;t think that white Americans elected him as the dem nom. when it has been because of the black and hispanics who really elected him. Now if we wins the election then you can say whites elected him. Whites make up 65% of America. Most of the 17 million who voted for Obama in the dem nom were black who make up 40 million of Americas population. But in the general Obama may still win because of Bush which people have had enough of. And because Clinton and Edwards who are throwing their hispanic and whites voters behind Obama.</p>
<p>So if Obama wins the elections it will not be because of whites conservatives. It will be because of Clinto and Edwards who gave their votes to Obama. It will also be because we have 110 million non whites who will support Obama. As many people think hispanics will support McCain are wrong. Hispanics will vote for Obama so will asians, blacks and marist whites.</p>

<p>A rut? Fatigue? In Canada, after decades of diversity &amp; mass immigration from the third-world? Surely there must be enrichment &amp; diversity on every street corner &amp; in the very air the people breathe. And here&rsquo;s me thinking it was because politicians in every white Western nation have an agenda of their own that&rsquo;s to blame for voters&rsquo; disillusionment with politics &amp; politicians. But then what do I know, I&rsquo;m only one of the goddam peasants.</p>
<p>It has to be those boring white folks again. I suggest all you bored Canadian liberal politicians diversify &amp; adopt the postal voting scheme introduceded in the UK where some Muslim councillors [politicians at local level] use it to create their own little personal fiefdoms with some of the brothers having that colourful quaint old custom of voting numerous times. Little rascals that they are. It&rsquo;ll take Canada even further down the road to third-world Banana Republic status, but hey, brother, with all those tom-toms &amp; bongo drums sounding throughout the land who&rsquo;s gonna care. </p>
<p>Yipeeee. It&rsquo;s party time.</p>

			<p>In the US, 57% of people are conservative and 37% liberal?  If this is true, why do most news programs, entertainment, newspapers, etc. have a decidedly liberal slant to them?  One would think the majority of these outlets would have a conservative bend to them given that&rsquo;s where the majority of people are.  </p>

			<p>Canada is where the U.S. was in 1950: clueless and naive. My theory is that they haven&rsquo;t been forced to become conservative by being beat up by Blacks in the educational system and on the streets the way we have here in the U.S. It&rsquo;ll take more exposure to large numbers of Blacks in their cities, educational systems and to the dangers of being governed by Blacks before they wake up.</p>

			<p>I sort of hope Obama gets elected.  (Ater all, when the alternative is McCain, what is there to lose?)  That is the only way we&rsquo;re going to cure millions of clueless white people of their Obama infatuation.</p>
<p>Do the Canadians really believe that children should be raised by homosexuals?  That&rsquo;s what the &#8220;gay marriage&#8221; issue is about   &mdash;   once homosexuals are legally married, they can legally adopt.  That is why the Catholic adoption agency has had to cease operating in Massachusetts   &mdash;   it is against their religion to send children off to be raised by two Daddies.</p>

			<p>In this matter, I do have to agree with the Catholics. No, I emphatically do not think homosexuals deserve to be stoned to death in the marketplace, Old Testament style. Nor do I feel they should be entrusted the care of impressionable youngsters either.</p>
<p>I would say by definition, a lot of pedophiles can also be viewed as homosexuals, since that&rsquo;s what a male raping a male child can an also be construed as. My own view of homosexuality? I consider it a mild form of insanity or mental illness. No more, no less. Given homosexuality is of its own a dead end, sex being the purpose of reproducing the species.</p>

			<p>I have a comment for the people who say they hope Obama gets elected so that people will finally wake up to the ineptitude of black leaders.</p>
<p>When ever has a black leader&rsquo;s failure been his own fault? After Obama is elected and is proven to not be cut out for the job, invariably white liberal journalists will trot out a host of excuses for his failure. Chief among them will be racism.</p>

			<p>Do the Canadians really believe that children should be raised by homosexuals? That&rsquo;s what the &ldquo;gay marriage&rdquo; issue is about  &mdash;  once homosexuals are legally married, they can legally adopt. That is why the Catholic adoption agency has had to cease operating in Massachusetts  &mdash;  it is against their religion to send children off to be raised by two Daddies.</p>

<p>This may be a state issue, I cannot recall, but here in the Western U.S. many gays and lesbians already adopted children.  Famously, the singer Melllisa Ethridge got inseminated with David Crosby&rsquo;s sperm to have a bady with her female partner.  This has been going on for a long time.  Sperm banks have allowed a lot of lespians to have children.  I think gay male cases are with children from a previous marriage.  There are variables here but homosexuals parenting children is nothing new.</p>

			<p>PLEASE, CANADIANS&hellip; take Obamat for your own, and welcome. We Americans sure as hell don&rsquo;t want him. Unless you count a few million hopelessly brainwashed and deluded teen and young adult fools. Who have been pumped up with years of p.c. garbage during school and tons of rap music slop to boot.</p>
<p>Hell, if anything other than McCain were running against Obama, the Republicans could just about save the biggest part of their election warchest. They wouldn&rsquo;t have to try very hard to defeat The Obamination.</p>
<p>Obama comes across as a liar, a phony. An inexperienced tyro who has no real substance. A man many of us rational people see as being little more than a media (advertising) creation. One which, should the unthinkable happen and he gets elected, the media would pounce on in a feeding frenzy to expose his flaws. As they did after Bill Clinton ascended to the presidency. With Obama as prez, you can bet your last Canadian dollar the media would find thousands of &#8216;flaws&rsquo; in his administration for the media to joyfully tear into.</p>
<p>I heard LYING OBAMA spout recently about wanting to end the outsourcing of American jobs to overseas locales. Guess I must have missed it&hellip; because I am not aware that in his Senatorial capacity, LYING OBAMA ever initiated or fought for any kind of Congressional legislation ending that abominable practice.</p>
<p>Obama talks a fine game&hellip; but talk is cheap, and in Obama&rsquo;s case, utterly devoid of substance (and often of truth). Canada, puleeze take him as your own. Most of us THINKING Americans would be only too glad to be rid of him. Or his (and his wife&rsquo;s) barely concealed anti-White racism.</p>
<p>The only thing I am aware of Obama initiating is yet another obscenity of a bill, aimed at taking wealth from the American people and distributing it to undeserving third world countries. I see no reason whatsoever, to steal taxes paid by hard-working American people and handing it out to those impoverished African nations&hellip; where it will either be wasted on luxuries for its corrupt rulers, or squirreled away in private Swiss bank accounts for these thieves.</p>
<p>Ever wonder WHY Africa seems to have such an abundance of natural resources needed by industrial nations&hellip; yet the people live off either crime or hand-outs from White nations? Something I&rsquo;d say is certainly worth thinking about. Now think how long it would take America to descend to third-world status under Obama.</p>

			<p>Whiteplight brings up interesting points&hellip; but I wonder if allowing homosexuals of either gender to have/raise children is healthy or unhealthy for the children.</p>
<p>I mean say what you, will&hellip; there is simply nothing natural about two males or two females pawing or slobbering over each other. The image of two homosexual males, for example, sticking their sex organs into each others mouths or anuses&hellip; utterly disgusting, to say the least. How can a rational person view homosexuality as a lifestyle? The term would imply choice&hellip; while your homosexuals claim to have been &#8220;born&#8221; that way.</p>

			<p>We&rsquo;re talking about a nation that has a &#8220;Human Rights Tribunal&#8221;. Something straight from Orwell&rsquo;s imagination. Hussein hates Whites, and hates freedom. No wonder he&rsquo;s popular in Canada. </p>

			<p>Canadas need to swoon is much greater than any appeal Obama might have. That point should not be missed. Same holds for here.</p>
<p>But I have a question. Why in the world did they conduct this survey in Cananda?</p>
<p>Well, because they  - the REAL OWNERS of this Country (and the WORLD) have big plans for Obama.  My hunch is that they intend to make him the first President of MexAmeriCanada.  Let&rsquo;s see.</p>

<p>I am aware that this has been going on for some time, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s a good idea.  How is a boy going to learn how to be a father from his two lesbian &#8220;mothers&#8221;?  I am not a gay basher, I think that homosexuality is usually caused by mistakes in fetal development and people can&rsquo;t help being what they are.  But I see no reason to twist the most fundamental institution of our society to the convenience of the gay rights movement.</p>
<p>The laws for marriage are indeed supposed to be made by the states.  However, they should be made by state legislators, not by judges.  So far as I know, in every case where a state has gay marriage it is because some judge &#8220;discovered&#8221; this &#8220;right&#8221; in the federal or state constitution, something that would have astonished the authors of those documents.<br>
