<h1><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D91SJ6DO0&amp;show_article=1">President Clinton Warns of Growing Polarization</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrew Welsh-Huggins, AP, July 12, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Former President Bill Clinton warned Saturday that the country is becoming increasingly polarized despite the historic nature of the Democratic primary.</p>
<p>Speaking at the National Governors Association&rsquo;s semiannual meeting, Clinton noted that on the one hand, following the early stages of the Democratic primary, &#8220;the surviving candidates were an African-American man and a woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But this achievement was overshadowed by a growing distance between Americans, said Clinton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Underneath this apparent accommodation to our diversity, we are in fact hunkering down in communities of like-mindedness, and it affects our ability to manage difference,&#8221; Clinton said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He cited statistics compiled by [Bill] Bishop [in his book <i>The Big Sort</i>] that found that in the 1976 presidential election, only 20 percent of the nation&rsquo;s counties voted for Jimmy Carter or President Ford by more than a 20 percent margin.</p>
<p>By contrast, 48 percent of the nation&rsquo;s counties in 2004 voted for John Kerry or President Bush by more than 20 points, Clinton said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were sorting ourselves out by choosing to live with people that we agree with,&#8221; Clinton said.</p>

<p>How dare people decide they want to live with people &#8220;that they agree with&#8221;! Better start bussing all those unfortunate, homogenous-thoughted blacks out of those ghettoes into conservative, presumbably white, neighbourhoods!</p>

<p>Uhm, he&rsquo;s just quoting a recent sociological study that found out that fact, it is nothing that he discovered.</p>
<p>And yeah, New York City IS full of crazy, like minded liberals.</p>

President Clinton doesn&rsquo;t seem to grasp what he&rsquo;s saying.</p>
<p>The former President is bemoaning the fact that like-minded people have chosen to associate with each other and he thinks this is wrong. The solution he sees is for diverse people who believe and embrace the ideal of &#8216;diversity&rsquo; (like-minded people) to come together to form diverse groups and communities.</p>
<p>The problem is that if all these people agree that diversity is a good thing and agree to live in a diverse community, how much diversity of ideas, opinions, and values do they really have? After all, everyone shares the same values, ideas, and opinions. That is not diversity. These are &lsquo;communities of like-mindedness&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The only way for &#8216;diversity&rsquo; to appear to work is for like-minded people who embrace diversity to associate with each other. This then is not a diverse set of people because far from sharing diverse ideas, they all share the same ideas.</p>
<p>You can never have consensus if everyone has a different or diverse opinion or viewpoint. Diversity of ideas, opinions, values, priorities, etc is why we have conflicts and why people fight. If everyone shares the same ideas and opinions, then you do not have diversity. Agreeing to live in a &lsquo;diverse&rsquo; community and believing in diversity is like-mindedness.</p>
<p>Either everyone shares the same ideas, opinions, and values or everyone is at each others throats and happier living among their own. Self-defined diverse individuals and groups can not produce the desired outcome of diversity because they are not a diverse group of people.</p>
<p>As soon as everyone agrees on most things, they are no longer diverse. Diversity is an impossibility.</p>

			<p>I traveled to the other side of the world to live with people I feel comfortable with and would do it again to avoid being around PC/diversity cherleaders of any color. So, Bill Clinton has shown a gift for stating the painfully obvious.</p>

			<p>And yet, this is the same Bill Clinton that openly boasted about the racial dispossession of whites while he was President.  He&rsquo;s only now questioning diversity (pun intended) because his wife lost out to the tribe, even as he thought the tribe loved him.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;We were sorting ourselves out by choosing to live with people that we agree with,&rdquo; Clinton said.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
What a ridiculous, tortured, PC verbal exercise in terms.  He, of course, meant race, ethnicity, and perhaps religion.  It sounds moronic stated this way, as if people should choose to live with people they DISAGREE with&hellip;</p>
<p>I certainly don&rsquo;t want to live with people I disagree with, you moron.  Life&rsquo;s too short.  (Of course, he&rsquo;s used to kind of living with at least one person who disagrees with him and his nomadic sex life, so he thinks it&rsquo;s normal.)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m guessing the US military would be just the place Clinton could find such living arrangements.  <br>

			<p>He is right to be dismayed, politicians of his breed are heading for extinction. The people have gotten in front of their leaders; and if we whites side with our communal interests, we may yet prevail.</p>

			<p>Clinton is an over-educated DOLT! Slavishly lapping up the p.c. dogma that the ONLY good society is a multi-cultural one. The very premise flies in the face of common sense. Given that people will make a conscious effort to live among those who look, think and act pretty much like themselves. Interpreted as actively attempting NOT to move into neighborhoods composed of people of other races, other skin colors.</p>
<p>But then again, most people are painfully aware other races are more given to criminal behavior. Like Blacks, Hispanics, for example. Let a White family move into a Black neighborhood   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s akin to asking to be robbed, mugged, burglarized, raped or even killed. But that&rsquo;s just common wisdom   &mdash;   amply supported by crime statistics and factual evidence, Mr. Clinton. So feel free to move into any Black or Hispanic neighborhood of your choice. (Like that brain-damaged female featured a week ago (gringa in the Heights). The silly fool thought she&rsquo;d be welcome in a Dominican neighborhood. Too dumb to realize what all might have happened to her but for extremely good luck.)</p>

			<p>Speaking of the Big Sort, I always laugh when I see movies in which the director portrays a perfect small town for the setting.  The town is always smallish, green and leafy, with a white church steeple in the middle, and the town population is always &hellip; you guessed it:  white.  See, e.g., the towns portrayed in Roxanne, Joe Dirt (Silverton is the ideal town), and The Village.  When directors want to show us a nightmare, they show a place that is dark, noisy, crowded, and &#8220;diverse.&#8221;  See, e.g., Bladerunner.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Didn&rsquo;t he and his, ahem, wife buy a mansion in a lilly white area in upstate New York ???!!!&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh, yeah! When i was teaching in upstate New York earlier in this decade, I remember the residents of Skaneateles (one of the MOST beautiful towns you can imagine, if you can afford to live there!)  telling me, to my face, that they made it clear to the Clintons, that they didn&rsquo;t want &#8216;their kind&rsquo; in the town.</p>
<p>Not that they were &#8216;persons of color,&rsquo; but that they were &#8216;po&rsquo; white trash!&rsquo; </p>
<p>Coulda knocked me over with a feather. And then I started to laugh. Now, that Billery is over and done with as far as political viability is concerned, it only seems fitting, somehow.</p>

			<p>So what&rsquo;s the solution Bill?  Seal the borders, halt immigration, enforce the law, end the welfare state?  Or is it more Section 8 vouchers for the suburbs, more &#8220;block busting&#8221;, more affirmative action and maybe reparations?  When you start forcing people who think like you Bill to be around people they don&rsquo;t want to be around, they start thinking like me!</p>

			<p>Clinton is a typical airhead liberal.  He pushes for policies that aware people KNOW will cause problems that will undoubtedly divide the populace then declares his surprise when he finally recognizes the fighting that&rsquo;s been going on for years.</p>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s another one to be surprised about that&rsquo;s occurring right now, Bubbah:  Blacks and browns are fighting and killing each other all over the country but especially in the Southwest, most particularly California.</p>
<p>Will pitched battles have to be in progress before you recognize this one as well?  And will you &#8220;see the light&#8221; before an AK 47 cuts down your door or will you do as you are doing now, making an announcement about events occurring that even the blind can see?</p>

			<p>I wonder if he&rsquo;s talking about different races or White people with different political views, although these two things are intertwined.  I don&rsquo;t know how many times I hear in the media or read an article about some White making a comment that mixed race babies are the most beautiful in the world or diversity is our greatest strength.  There&rsquo;s no middle ground here to work with and I&rsquo;m not compromising my beliefs, I would just as soon stay away from them.  Of course, sometimes I wonder, given that I&rsquo;ve met very few people who espouse these things in real life, whether it&rsquo;s just left wing propaganda to energize their minority constituents.  Of course, I sometimes wonder if the right secretly masks itself as the left and engages in the same thing to rile up right wingers into taking action against the left.    </p>

			<p>So people choose to&hellip; WANT TO live among people similar to them. This attribute of human culture and thought goes back to the beginning of time. So why should Clinto or anyone else be surprised?</p>
<p>Do we see Clinton and his liberal cronies giving up their prized, heavily guarded mansions to live in urban Black or Mexican ghettos? To practice that principal of cultural diversity they so fervently claim to believe in? Do you see Bill Gates deciding to live among the common rabble in the seedier sections of Seattle, for example? To live among the Blacks and &#8220;set a good example&#8221; for all Americans.</p>
<p>As a White man why in hell would I want to live among people I consider inferior to me   &mdash;   by intelligence, education, lifestyle or any other yardstick. I want to live among middle class White Americans like myself. Thus bitterly resenting the fact the community we&rsquo;ve lived in for 28 years has become overrun with Hispanics and Blacks (and the attendant crime integration brings with it).<br>
