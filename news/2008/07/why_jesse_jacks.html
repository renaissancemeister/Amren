<p>But now &mdash; not looking old so much as a bit lost within the new Obama aura &mdash; it is clear that Jesse Jackson has come to a kind of dénouement. Some force that once buoyed him up now seems spent.</p>
<p>{snip} [He] and the entire civil rights establishment pursued equality through the manipulation of white guilt.</p>
<p>Their faith was in the easy moral leverage over white America that the civil rights victories of the 1960s had suddenly bestowed on them. So Mr. Jackson and his generation of black leaders made keeping whites &#8220;on the hook&#8221; the most sacred article of the post-&rsquo;60s black identity.</p>
<p>They ushered in an extortionist era of civil rights, in which they said to American institutions: Your shame must now become our advantage. To argue differently &mdash; that black development, for example, might be a more enduring road to black equality &mdash; took whites &#8220;off the hook&#8221; and was therefore an unpardonable heresy. For this generation, an Uncle Tom was not a black who betrayed his race; it was a black who betrayed the group&rsquo;s bounty of moral leverage over whites. And now comes Mr. Obama, who became the first viable black presidential candidate precisely by giving up his moral leverage over whites.</p>
<p>Mr. Obama&rsquo;s great political ingenuity was very simple: to trade moral leverage for gratitude. {snip}</p>
<p>So it is not hard to see why Mr. Jackson might have experienced Mr. Obama&rsquo;s emergence as something of a stiletto in the heart. Mr. Obama is a white &#8220;race card&#8221; &mdash; moral leverage that whites can use against the moral leverage black leaders have wielded against them for decades. He is the nullification of Jesse Jackson &mdash; the anti-Jackson.</p>
<p>And Mr. Obama is so successful at winning gratitude from whites precisely because Mr. Jackson was so successful at inflaming and exploiting white guilt. Mr. Jackson must now see his own oblivion in the very features of Mr. Obama&rsquo;s face. {snip}</p>
<p>And then Mr. Obama took it further by going to the NAACP with a message of black responsibility &mdash; this after his speech on the need for black fathers to take responsibility for the children they sire. &#8220;Talking down to black people,&#8221; Mr. Jackson mumbled.</p>
<p>Normally, &#8220;black responsibility&#8221; is a forbidden phrase for a black leader &mdash; not because blacks reject responsibility, but because even the idea of black responsibility weakens moral leverage over whites. When Mr. Obama uses this language, whites of course are thankful. Black leaders seethe.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Mr. Obama&rsquo;s sacrifice of black leverage has given him a chance to actually become the president. He has captured the devotion of millions of whites in ways that black leveragers never could. And the great masses of blacks &mdash; blacks outside today&rsquo;s sclerotic black leadership &mdash; see this very clearly. Until Mr. Obama, any black with a message of black responsibility would be called a &#8220;black conservative&#8221; and thereby marginalized. After Obama&rsquo;s NAACP speech, blacks flooded into the hotel lobby thanking him for &#8220;reminding&#8221; them of their responsibility.</p>
<p>{snip} Why then, all of a sudden, are blacks willing to openly embrace this truth &mdash; and in the full knowledge that it will weaken their leverage with whites?</p>
<p>I think the answer is that Mr. Obama potentially offers them something far more profound than mere moral leverage. If only symbolically, he offers nothing less than an end to black inferiority. {snip}</p>
<p>But white Americans have also been tormented by their stigmatization as moral inferiors, as racists. An Obama presidency would give them considerable moral leverage against this stigma.</p>
<p>So it has to be acknowledged that, on the level of cultural and historical symbolism, an Obama presidency might nudge the culture forward a bit &mdash; presuming of course that he would be at least a competent president. (A less-than-competent black president would likely be a step backwards.) It would be a good thing were blacks to be more open to the power of individual responsibility. And it would surely help us all if whites were less cowed by the political correctness on black issues that protects their racial innocence at the expense of the very principles that made America great. We Americans are hungry for such a cultural shift.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But here lies his essential contradiction: His campaign is more cultural than political. He sells himself more as a cultural breakthrough than as a candidate for office. To be a projection screen for the cultural aspirations of both blacks and whites one must be an invisible man politically. Real world politics, in their mundanity, interrupt cultural projections. And so Mr. Obama&rsquo;s political invisibility &mdash; a charm that can only derive from a lack of deep political convictions &mdash; may well serve his cultural appeal, but it also makes him something of a political mess.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mr. Obama has already won a cultural mandate to the American presidency. And politically, he is now essentially in a contest with himself. His challenge is not Mr. McCain; it is the establishment of his own patriotism, trustworthiness and gravitas. He has to channel a little Colin Powell, and he no doubt hopes his trip to the Middle East and Europe will reflect him back to America with something of Mr. Powell&rsquo;s stature. He wants even Middle America to feel comfortable as the mantle they bestow on him settles upon his shoulders.<br>

			<p>I kind of resent the idea put forth here by Mr Steele that whites wouldn&rsquo;t vote for someone who is a &#8216;leverager&rsquo;. They certainly seem more than willing to sell fellow whites down the river. Headfirst down an endless inescapable black hole? No problem. Into a world like that portrayed in the art work &#8216;The Scream&rsquo;? Without blinking. Americans would vote for a &#8216;leverager&rsquo;. Actually, Obama himself is black leverager. With all the attempts we&rsquo;ve seen to certify Obama&rsquo;s &#8216;blackness&rsquo;, it would be more accurate, and relevant, to note that it is Black America that would never accept a politician in the mold of say, Mr Steele himself. Isn&rsquo;t that a more accurate observation of what is going on?</p>
<p>I have no problem with where Mr Steele is coming from, in truth I really don&rsquo;t know but I&rsquo;ve heard only good things about him. The problem is, judging by the the article here, in our current environment we can&rsquo;t seem to have a discussion touching on white guilt without in the process creating even more.  </p>

			<p>This whole &#8220;row&#8221; with JJ is contrived; BHO knows blacks are going to vote for him no matter what but he knows he can&rsquo;t win without massive white support. 100% black turnout alone just won&rsquo;t cut it.  Many whites despise JJ; this is just a stage managed event for BHO to &#8220;distance&#8221; himself from this hustler to appeal to the white voters he needs to win.  Honestly, can you see &#8220;the Reverend&#8221; Jackson voting for McLame out of spite?</p>

			<p>One of the things that has really irritated me about the black community is their support for Jackson. He and Sharpton have never been and never will be more than parasites preying on blacks. They never address any of the real issues confronting blacks as they are merely ambulance chasers and grandstanders. They come riding into town on a white horse with fanfare when issues are hot. Once interest wanes, they leave like a thief in the night with a pocket full of money. </p>

			<p>From MoMo: the following comment is sarcastic. It is also true.</p>
<p>Mr. Steele should be commended for creating out of whole cloth, such a distinguished analysis seeped in pure horse manure.</p>
<p>Senator Obama is an opportunist. If he were to surround himself, and be identified with the average African - American, he would not win any more African - American votes but he WOULD lose substantial number of white votes and hence the election.</p>
<p>In short, Jesse caters to the whims and caprices of blacks, Obama to whites. The whole underlying agenda of Senator Obama is not to be too threatening to whites, or to the news media which long ago drunk the Obama kool aid and sold out. </p>
<p>Senator Obama&rsquo;s allure is two fold: {1} he sounds like Martin Luther King and (2) he speaks in short sound bites {that to anyone who can speak in sentences are totally meaningless}. </p>
<p>And guess who Senator Obama sounds like a genius to as well? Hmmm yes, you guessed it! Those same white, pointy egg headed, dorky, far left socialistic - Marxist, limp wristed, intellectual elites and effete  academic snobs that daily infect your little Johnnies and Mary Anns! Yes Henrietta thats the ticket! We can all now take the moral high ground by supporting an African - American! See how far we have come (yes but in which direction?).</p>
<p>The only way a normal person can ever get a Ph.D. today is in the hard sciences. In any field that requires subjective interpretation forget it! If you are not on the same wave length as the person grading your paper you ain&rsquo;t never gonna be sitting where he, or she, or it is. <br>
 <br>
These same sociopathic psychologists  strut around these campaigns using Latinate words and pontificating as experts on everything: military actions (when the closest they have ever been to the military is in some combat simulation on their laptop) housing crisis (when they have never had the bottom fall out from their investment when their neighborhood became more diverse), the gas shortage (since they live close to the campuses), and the volatile stock market (when they have never owned a stock, bond, option, or had to make a payroll or pay taxes in their entire lives).   </p>
<p>I must be getting old! Senator Obama will win! McCain will wait to the last possible moment to actually put up a fight: &#8220;My friends we can&rsquo;t be too hasty we have to let the tea cool in the saucer, we can&rsquo;t act too hastily, we can&rsquo;t say anything that might be construed as either racial, personal, religious, or political &hellip;.&#8221;   McCain wants to do it his way. He will too. He will lose of course. I think he has reconciled himself to this fact since the most important thing to him is to be able to reach out across the isle - he sould still be able to do that!  Unfortunately however, this country will lose right along with him.  The Republicans should have done better! </p>
<p>This whole political process reminds me of the satire of James at War particularly that of &#8220;I wanna be a pop star&#8221;. Google it; see what you think - just substitute Obama for Britney.</p>

			<p>Jesse Jackson loves Obama.  Both are shysters and backed by black racists and their white Bolshevik sidekicks.  Both are human trash.  A vote for Obama is a vote for Jackson and a vote for human trash.</p>

			<p>What a bunch of baloney.  Steel is a black guy (although light-shinned).  He&rsquo;s a black guy first last and always.  He&rsquo;ll say what gets blacks closer to taking over America.  His selling point is &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid to Obama, he&rsquo;s not the wild transplanted African tribal chief that Jackson is&rdquo;.  </p>
<p>A good example of the article&rsquo;s disingenuousness is Steele purporting that Obama displayed a racial evenhandedness by telling the NAACP in a, &ldquo;speech on the need for black fathers to take responsibility for the children they sire.&rdquo;   That&rsquo;s like the pastry chef like telling the fat guy he&rsquo;s got to loose weight.  It&rsquo;s for the benefit of white on lookers.</p>
<p>Obama has spent his whole life taking advantage of the white people&rsquo;s industry and generosity; he is not going to change now or ever.  Steele knows this.</p>
<p>We are not like Steele or Jackson or Obama.  We are white people.  America is a white European and Christian country.  But our tolerance and fairness for others different from us has proved a weakness.   We should be more like Steele. </p>

			<p>The problem with Steele&rsquo;s analysis is the problem with everyone and everything that doesn&rsquo;t acknowledge the elephant in the parlor: media power.  That is the central defining aspect of contemporary western civilization.</p>
<p>E.g., &#8220;white guilt&#8221; (what a ludicrous, Orwellian term), insofar as it actually exists*, is not something Joe Sixpack and Sally Soccermom sat down one day to think about, posed like the statue (&#8220;hmmmmm&#8221;), to come up with the conclusion of &#8220;white guilt.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nope.  Joe and Sally&rsquo;s teevee told &#8216;em whites were guilty (but not Joe and Sally, as long as they worship the great god Diversity), and they bought it hook line and sinker.  Period.  Full stop.</p>
<p>Same goes for the &#8220;worse is better&#8221; argument.  How will whites KNOW things are worse, and worse because of non-whites and the genocidal race-replacement regime, IF THE MEDIA DOESN&rsquo;T TELL THEM?  We&rsquo;d literally have to all be on fire, with non-whites roasting weenies in the flames, before the media would deign to inform us of our own destruction.</p>
<p>Same goes for the &#8220;Hitler&rsquo;s Revenge&#8221; argument (that Hitler&rsquo;s legacy is death to European racial self-awareness).  Pitiful.  As if Joe and Sally sat down, thought &#8220;hmmmmm,&#8221; and came to the anti-racist position via thinking about Hitler&rsquo;s legacy.  If that&rsquo;s the case, what&rsquo;s Stalin&rsquo;s Revenge?  Why isn&rsquo;t &#8220;anti-racism&#8221; (inter alia) utterly discredited by the gulags and the Holodomor?</p>
<p>DUH!  THE IT&rsquo;S THE M-E-D-I-A S-T-U-P-I-D!</p>
<p>*: (&#8220;white guilt&#8221; is a collective guilt for which NO ONE - least of all the Tim Wises of the world - feels individually responsible - it&rsquo;s always &#8220;those other white people&#8221;)</p>
<p>(note, when I say &#8220;the media&#8221; in this context I mean the whole meme-manufacturing apparatus; mostly the mass media and academia)</p>

			<p>Sokme say that Obama will do this or he stands for that. Has everybody forgotten that the democrats have fullfilled exactly zero of their campeign promises since taking office. We&rsquo;re still in Iraq, the economy sucks, the country is almost bankrupt, big oil still runs the show at $4.00 + a gallon for gas with the illegal problem looming larger than ever. Yep, our leaders have sold us out and we are mostly screwed by them.</p>

			<p>Jealous Jesse Jerkson&rsquo;s attack on Obama for &#8220;talking down to Blacks&#8221; was ridiculous because he and Rev. Al Pimpton have themselves often lectured their own people in front of whites as a p.r. stunt.</p>
<p>Steele makes some good points but in regard to his statement about Obama&rsquo;s moderate, non-race-card-playing campaign rhetoric: We&rsquo;ll see how quickly that changes after the election.</p>

			<p>Obama might be younger, more eloquent, and more educated than Jackson, but I have no trust for him either. He is just knows how to play the game like most politicians. One thing is certain though, even if Obama were to make it to the Whitehouse, this would never stop most blacks from crying out about white oppression, at any given chance. White guilt is a cash-cow that they intend milk until dry, or until whites come to their senses, and let them know it will not work on them any longer.</p>

			<p>I feel no gratitude towards Obama.  Why should I?  He&rsquo;s promising to work for another illegal alien amnesty, will see to it that our immigration laws are not enforced, wants to raise taxes, and has a laundry list of new ways to spend tax dollars.  Only on foreign policy is he better than &#8220;bomb, bomb, bomb; bomb, bomb Iran&#8221; McInsane.  But that&rsquo;s not a high bar to meet.<br>

			<p>Dont kid yourself. Jackson like all his ilk hates and detests whites premier and would do anything to kill off the whole race or make them slaves. This inner family squabbling just gets attemtion he craves so badly. Jackson is 100% in Obamas corner without exception. <br>

<p>Excellent post, Svigor  &mdash;  thanks.</p>
<p>Many, like Dr.David Duke, think the internet will be the means of dissemination of such information, and also our salvation as an organizational tool. But I don&rsquo;t see it. People come home from work, they mostly don&rsquo;t want to go fussing around on the web (it&rsquo;s too much like work)  &mdash;  they want to flop in a chair (if they have time even to do that) and passively let TV wash over and through them, and relax into the great community that is out there watching these programs at the same time. The urge for a community of shared experience that a person can relax into is universal, and TV comes closest to supplying that now in most of the U.S., sadly. The Net is a very different sort of experience.</p>
<p>I hope very much that I&rsquo;m wrong and Duke is right. And I think he&rsquo;s a very impressive man that people have been fooled into despising.</p>
<p>P.S. Jackson hates Obama because Obama is going to derail his gravy train.</p>

			<p>Jessie Jackson hates Obama because Obama has outshined him in the public eye. That&rsquo;s it. Blacks are very jealous of one another and any of them are quick to sabotage a &ldquo;Brother&rdquo; if he gets more attention (or stuff) then they do.</p>
<p>Right now, big-whitey-world is giving Obama four pats on the back for every one that it&rsquo;s giving Jessie. Soon, Jessie&rsquo;s back might be entirely unattended. He&rsquo;s in a fix and getting desperate.<br>
