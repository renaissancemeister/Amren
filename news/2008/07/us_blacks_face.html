				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Deborah Zabarenko, Reuters, July 29, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Blacks are more than twice as likely as whites to live in cities where the so-called heat island effect is expected to make temperature increases more severe, the newly formed group said at a briefing.</p>
<p>More blacks also will be &#8220;fuel poor&#8221; as energy demand rises due to higher air-conditioning loads, population growth and urbanization, commission [of the Commission to Engage African-Americans on Climate Change] said.</p>
<p>In a survey of 750 U.S. black adults released by the commission, 81 percent said the U.S. government should take strong action to deal with global warming, and seven in 10 said it was very important for the 2008 presidential candidates to do something about it.</p>
<p>A solid majority, 64 percent, of those surveyed by telephone between June 20 and July 3 said they would be willing to pay an additional $10 a month to fight global warming. Twenty-eight percent were willing to pay an added $25 a month and only 14 percent were willing to pay an extra $50.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The commission aims to draw African-Americans into the climate change debate and to involve the black community in economic opportunities of the green economy.<br>

			<p>I get the feeling that there are a lot of us whites who are going to cheer and root for climate change in earnest.  Since I think most of this climate change is nature&rsquo;s doings, what is Clyburn going to do?  Sue God?  He might be that pretentious.</p>

			<p>When the majority of the 64% can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t pay the extra $10.00 per month to fight global warming who do you think will wind up holding the bag for this farce? It is always something with them like enviormental racism, institutonial racism, police racism, on and on never ending stupidity. I think a great idea for them would be to try living in the artic or antartic, to see how they would deal with polar racism. They should love it, living in a totally white community.</p>

			<p>&#8220;There is a fierce urgency regarding climate change effects on the African-American community,&#8221; said Ralph Everett, the co-chair of the Commission to Engage African-Americans on Climate Change said. &#8220;People need to understand what is at stake   &mdash;   our very health and well-being.&#8221;</p>
<p>They break apart from the rest of society and discuss national issues and how they affect blacks, ignoring everybody else.   At the same time, out of the other sides of their mouths, they&rsquo;re violently complaining that blacks are not included in the American mainstream.</p>
<p>The cry baby whining is not only unjustified it&rsquo;s sickening to have to tolerate.</p>

<p>Yet again, another flawed &#8220;survey.&#8221; Why not conduct it between June 20 and February 3?</p>
<p>I bet the results would be quite different and some of the answers by the black respondents would probably be priceless.</p>

			<p>Not to mention the inevitable increase in the cost of crack cocaine due to higher energy prices.</p>
<p>As for teaching blacks the opportunities of the green economy.  Black and green don&rsquo;t mix.  Except for the few cases where a person is directly threatened by environmental degradation, almost all environmentalists pursue their calling out of a concern for the greater good.  It&rsquo;s a manifestation of altruism - and therefore rare among blacks.</p>

			<p>Trying to engage Blacks in environmental concerns is futile.  They can scarcely plan a month ahead, taking action for future years is unthinkable.  They can&rsquo;t even keep themselves from getting AIDS, so focused are they on immediate gratification.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Lol&hellip;.as if the actual black person knows what global warming, let alone has enough brain power to suggest the implications of it.  Global warming is a lie.  Anyone who bothers to inform themselves about the state of what science has to say about this issue will quickly find that this is undeniable.  The earth is actually cooling&hellip;.rapidly.  Don&rsquo;t break out your winter coat just yet, the temperature differences we are talking about are minuscule.  Since the industrial revolution started, the earth&rsquo;s average temperature rose about 1.5 Celsius.  But, in the last ten years, it was plunged .5 Celsius.  Well, woopie de doo, our climate is a shifting.  Seriously though, our climate is unchanged, it just goes through minor shifts here and there from decade to decade&hellip;.century to century.  This is well known among climatologists.  But seems to escape the notice of statesmen (not to mention blacks).</p>
<p>What does it mean that so many blacks think this way?  It means that they are essentially slaves to the neo-communist elements of our government.  They vote the way they are told and think what they are told to think.  Ten years from now, when near 100% of the US energy needs are met with completely non-polluting nuclear fusion, the liberals will be telling us that the loss of so much carbon being added to the environment is causing global cooling, mass catastrophes and the threat of nuclear war via an increasingly impoverished and unstable middle east.</p>
<p>And blacks will have curiously forgotten all about global warming. </p>

			<p>Interesting.  Here I am, upstairs, in the middle of a city with all the usual asphalted surface helping to alter the area microclimate.  We haven&rsquo;t had any rain worth note in weeks, and at 11:06 PM, it is still 84 F.  As I type, I am wearing a pair of atheletic shorts.</p>
<p>I have never had air-conditioning, but the city does.  During the day, the sun shines down on all that asphalt.  It heats up, and warms the air.  The warm air rises, and convection pulls cooler air out of the surrounding area.  I love the sighing sound the low-level wind makes as it rushes through the pine and spruce trees.</p>
<p>We have a ceiling fan at the top of the stairwell that does not get turned off in July and August.  We keep one window open in the kitchen downstairs and two upstairs.</p>
<p>The heat is turned on in late autumn when we can see our breath in the mornings.  My wife thinks we&rsquo;re wasting money that way, but when she was growing up, there was thin sheet ice in the toilet every morning.</p>
<p>Air-conditioning is not a fundamental right.</p>

			<p>Has anybody noticed that outside the southern states of the US utility costs generally rise during the winter?</p>
<p>It costs more to heat and light homes and businesses in the winter than it does to cool and light them in the summer.</p>
<p>Imagine how aggrieved blacks will be when they discover this reality.</p>

			<p>So people who evolved to survive in the extreme heat of Africa are at a disadvantage to whites, who evolved in cold weather, to exist in &#8220;heat islands&#8221; in temperate North America? What logic goes through these peoples heads? Shouldn&rsquo;t global warming be GOOD for blacks, relative to other groups, rather than bad, because they are designed for warmer weather?</p>

			<p>Good luck collecting the extra $10-50 dollars a month from them.  In my experience as a landlord, blacks will run their utilities at maximum output (without paying) until the utility company pulls the plug on them.  Then they will find a relative to open an account for them and repeat the process.  They also have a total inability to understand a bill.  They see $900 as balance due (with $800 in back charges) and honestly believe they are being charged $900/month (and will argue it with you even after explaination).    One group begged a neighbor to let them run and extension cord to their TV after the power was shut off.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;Even the climate is leaving them behind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, even the climate is racist.  As Marion Barry said, &#8220;All laws are racist.  Even the law of gravity is racist.&#8221; </p>
<p>So, we have a racist law of gravity, a racist climate, and if that&rsquo;s not enough to give blacks ulcers, we have Angel Food Cake which is white, and Devil&rsquo;s Food Cake, which is black.</p>
<p>Add to those injustices the fact that a black hole in space is racist, and you have a recipe for oppressing blacks beyond anything they&rsquo;ve ever experienced in their worst nightmares.</p>
<p>No wonder the black on C-Span wanted to exterminate whites from the face of the earth in order to know true peace.</p>
<p>When he watched the movie Star Wars, I wonder how he kept from going insane observing that Darth Vader was black, just as the Detroit Mayor Kirkpatrick went off the deep end when he discovered that a black woman sat next to a white guy named White.</p>
<p>When Obama git in, whitey gonna learn all he kin do is tip-toe around and keep his mouf shut.<br>

&#8220;Blacks are more than twice as likely as whites to live in cities where the so-called heat island effect is expected to make temperature increases more severe, the newly formed group said at a briefing.</p>
<p>More blacks also will be &#8220;fuel poor&#8221; as energy demand rises due to higher air-conditioning loads, population growth and urbanization, commission said.</p>
<p>The commission aims to draw African-Americans into the climate change debate and to involve the black community in economic opportunities of the green economy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Translation; More hot air and rising energy costs will present great opportunities for blacks. When the utility bills rise so that blacks can&rsquo;t afford them, they will need free energy vouchers to pay for air conditioning in the summer, and gas heating in the winter. This is a call for blacks to start agitating now instead of later.</p>
<p>In addition, they will need free air conditioned Cadillacs to take them to KFC and to liquor stores.</p>
<p>Guess who will pick up the tab?</p>

			<p>I was personally involved in this survey and I can positively state that all the blacks who responded to this survey were the highest caliber of Americans you can imagine, not once did I detect any hostility or animosity, or even rudeness.  It was a utopia of connected citizens with nothing but regards for the others in their community, always waiting until others had gone first.      obama &#8216;08/the abyss &#8216;09</p>

			<p>&#8220;81% of blacks concerned about global warming,,,,&#8221;</p>
<p> Huh? I was active in many environmental groups for years and I never once saw a black face. Look at what blacks have done to Haiti for a more realistic impression of their attitudes towards ecology.</p>

<p>Oh, I&rsquo;ve already learned that.   After working around a number of them for many years, I learned to watch every single word I said, and that there were certain topics (however innocent), even in jest,  that were completely beyond-the-limits.</p>
<p>But whites who haven&rsquo;t learned are in for a hard time.</p>

			<p>Regarding some blacks objecting to the cake name &#8220;Devil&rsquo;s Food Cake&#8221; as racist, several articles on the web say that it was originally a BRIGHT RED chocolate cake with white frosting when it was created in America in the the early 1900s.  The redness of the cake was from dye, and when Red Dye No. 40 was discovered to cause cancer in the 1970s, the recipe was modified to create a dark brown or dark red-brown cake with fudge icing.  </p>
<p>So, it was called Devil&rsquo;s Food Cake because it was originally bright red and devilishly delicious, not for any other reason!</p>
<p>Blessings to you all, and when can I expect you at my house for some coffee and cake?</p>

			<p>&#8220;Has anybody noticed that outside the southern states of the US utility costs generally rise during the winter?&#8221;<br>

<p>This is a bit off topic, but do you really think we don&rsquo;t have high heating bills in the South? I live in North Carolina. Most of the older homes aren&rsquo;t insulated like they are up North. Natural gas isn&rsquo;t as prevalent. We hit hard times and went through two winters with just a kerosene heater and a couple of space heaters. It was h**l. Last year we could finally afford propane and it cost us about $450/month, plus we had to supplement with a kerosene heater on the really cold days becuae we didn&rsquo;t want to turn the thermostat above 72 deg. During Jan., Feb., and March it can get down to the teens during the night. I lost my job recently and if I can&rsquo;t find something soon, we&rsquo;ll be back to one kersoene heater and a couple of space heaters again. By the way, our average electric bill without the space heaters runs $130. With the space heaters it was runnning around $250-$300. In the winter our utilities cost almost as much as our mortgage. </p>
<p>There is a difference between Florida and North Carolina, Virginia or Tennessee!  </p>

			<p>Yes, it gets cold down south.  I did most of my prison time in Ft. Worth, Texas, and the damp chill of the two winters I spent there was quite unpleasant.  Fortunately for me, I was able to scrounge a second blanket for my bunk.  We had an ice storm in the winter of 2002-03, and as one of the grounds maintenance crew, I spent a miserable day chipping ice off the walks.</p>
<p>When I was living in Sydney, which is 35 degrees south of the equator, and so approximately like San Diego (35 north), the winter rains made me feel cold as well.  My main gripe was that I would run out of dry shoes, and in order that my wet laundry would dry at all, I had to string clothesline in my bathroom.  A secondary gripe was the spiders.  Australia doesn&rsquo;t have many snakes.  The spiders have killed most of them.</p>
<p>We have gas forced-air heat, and I never see a winter heating bill over $100.  My wife&rsquo;s attitude helps, though.  She&rsquo;s made of fairly stern stuff, and thinks that if one doesn&rsquo;t wake up to ice in the toilets on winter mornings, one is wasting money on heat.  We compromise.  The heat gets turned on when I can see my breath in the mornings, but only to 60 F.  We experimented with 55 F before we married, but that wasn&rsquo;t much fun for me, as I already have the metabolic rate of a dead reptile.  Resting pulse: 45.  Normal body temperature: 93-94.</p>
<p>Where acclimization to hot climates is concerned, blacks have it made, but when one looks at African blacks, they&rsquo;re rather slim.  Cheap groceries and a preference for fried food in North America puts the pounds on blacks, and they end up backwards on the surface area-versus-volume equation.  They don&rsquo;t have our tolerance of cold weather (they turn gray), but the extra insulation they grow here makes them poor at dealing with hot weather as well.  The last thing in the whole world I would want to be in a hot, humid eastern or Great Lakes summer is fat.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m not at all surprised that 81% of blacks expect the federal goernment to do something about global warming. After all Uncle Sam is their &#8220;massa&#8221;.</p>
