<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Italy said on Saturday it had expelled 38 Egyptians as part of a crackdown ordered by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi&rsquo;s government on illegal immigration.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Interior Minister Roberto] Maroni also defended his plans to fingerprint Roma children. Roma people, known in Italy as &#8220;nomads,&#8221; are blamed for much of the crime in Italian cities.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&rsquo;t know who lives in legal (nomadic) camps let alone the illegal ones. We don&rsquo;t know the nationalities of the residents so we have to do a census,&#8221; Maroni told the newspaper Corriere della Sera.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Catholic charity Fondazione Migrantes, which is linked to the Italian bishops&rsquo; conference, questioned why Roma people were being singled out.</p>
<p>&#8220;It incomprehensible why fingerprints are being taken solely from minors from this tiny ethnic minority,&#8221; it was quoted as saying by Italian news agencies.</p>
<p>&#8220;All of this will not reduce fear and give peace to our people, but set the stage for unearthing a type of xenophobia, or worse, of racial discrimination.&#8221;<br>

			<p>As a Catholic i&rsquo;ve been annoyed at the church lately on it&rsquo;d stance on immigration</p>

			<p>My guess is that they are the front line for much of the petty street crime around those parts. It`s as hard to fight off a swarm of kids as it is bees. Also, a while ago a poster related a story about his own experience with the gypsy kids. He told how he was a decent man, but for a brief moment he was almost ready  to push a six year old girl down a flight of stairs. I WISH I could remember what she had done exactly to warrant that kind of response. Because it resonated with me. In my own case I had kindly told a five year old girl, &#8220;No Thank You&#8221; when proffered gum. She reached out and took my free hand while  begging me with her eyes. When she realized the answer was still no she bit into the back of my finger hard enough to draw blood. Hard enough to drip blood back to the Hotel. We`re both extremely lucky it was in a crowd that she could melt into  as the pain and rage came out to play.</p>

			<p>  Thirty eight out of the thousands of Italian illegals doesn&rsquo;t seem like many to me. This sounds more like a charade than a real effort to reduce illegal immigration.  It&rsquo;s time to get serious and expel thousands.</p>

			<p>When I was in Italy once, a bunch of 10-13 year old gypsies walked past my friends and me as we were walking down the street.  One tried to raise a newspaper in my face while another put his hand in my pocket to steal my wallet.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately for him, I was an angst-filled recent high-school graduate who had recently been spurned by my girlfriend of a year or so.  I flew into a rage and threw him against a telephone pole screaming at him.  I feel the same rage sometimes at those who attempt to destroy Western culture.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is common there.<br>

			<p>If you ever travel to Europe BE VERY WARY of Gypsies. They will rob you blind. They have it down to a science and prefer tourists who are more inexperienced and unfamiliar then the natives. They hang out at train stations, bus depots, tourist attraction, anywhere crowds of vacationers are likely to be. They are often children controlled by an adult and operate in packs. Be very careful. If you can stomach it there are all sorts of Youtube videos of Gypsy children in Europe robbing tourists blatently.</p>

			<p>The worst thing is their astonishing birthrate. A gipsy woman at 25 has already 6-7 children, who are not even registered and probably will never attend an Italian school, maybe because there aren&rsquo;t lessons of stealing and robbing.</p>

			<p>The Church is defending criminals, interesting, Perhaps they might want to take them into the Vatican. There is a pernicious malady of a sadistic kind that ever supports degenerates at the expense of good citizens. It seems to me that if a person or organization feels charitable &hellip;let (them), with their own (labor) earned income, quitely support,defend who they will, and if this needy one violates a decent person let the enabler pay restitution. Who enables criminal&rsquo;s is an accomplice to crime.</p>

			<p>I am unfamiliar with the Gysies, are they white? are they Muslim? if they are Muslim that is enough reason to wipe them out</p>

			<p>One of the things the Gypsies like to to is stuff their begging sing into your middle, while they rifkle through your belt pouch.</p>
<p>Never, ever wear a belt pouch in Europe.  It marks you as an American.  </p>
<p>Never accept drinks from strangers.  These will be drugged.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t wear atheletic shoes.  These mark you as a Yank.  </p>
<p>If addressed in English, ignore the remark.  A white man with an Asian gal marks himself as a Yank, but we told folks I was Siberian Russian (Siberski Russki) and she was North Korean, and we had no trouble.  Speak German, Russian, Spanish or French if you are white.</p>
<p>Do NOT ever go to Algeria if you have Oriental features or an Asian wife.  Vietnamese were the torturers there, for the French, and this is still remembered.</p>
<p>Get a fake passports from Ceylon or some other country that no longer exists.  Airplane hijacking is a thing of the past, but I have multiple passports and my wife has two.  Airplane hijackers used to ask for passports, just so they would know who to shoot.</p>

<p>The Gypsies are actually a nomadic people of northern Indian descent.</p>

			<p>Skip:</p>
<p> The Gypsies are originally from northern India. They began entering the Balkans in the 1400&rsquo;s.  They have never contributed ANYTHING to Europe&rsquo;s welfare and never will.</p>

			<p>when my parents went to Italy one summer&hellip;gypsies were all over the place in Rome and other big cities&hellip;..they are likely a race of their own&hellip;..muslim, with a little black mixed in for seasoning&hellip;.they certainly were not white according to the discription and they were all beggers from the oldest to the youngest&hellip;.and people are warned not to bother giving to them as they are certainly NOT starving nor are they poor&hellip;.like blacks&hellip;.they don&rsquo;t want to work and mostly are thieves&hellip;..sound familiar????</p>

<p>Michael, I always enjoy your posts.</p>
<p>I lived in Slovenia for a while, but I didn&rsquo;t have such a hard time since I avoided Italy and stayed out of big cities.  However, I think things have gotten worse since I lived there.  But you would make a wonderful mess out of Rick Steve&rsquo;s Polyanna like travel shows.  I&rsquo;d love to see that idiot get some reality into them.</p>

			<p>To add to an above post, some other things that will single you out as an American (and the poster is right, white sneakers on anyone over 25 scream &#8220;American&#8221;) are baseball caps and North Face clothing/gear.</p>

			<p>This happened to a Doctor friend in the USA.</p>
<p>He lives  a few blocks from an entertainment street that has a lot of bars and clubs.  He goes to the bars 2 or 3 times a week looking to pick up women.  There are gypsy women all over the street, and going into the clubs and bars to sell single red roses.</p>
<p>Being a habitue of the bars he got acquainted with one of the flower sellers.  Finding out he was a Doctor she asked him to do an evaluation of her 14 year old daughter.  He agreed and the family including the Father and some male relatives arrived for the appointment.</p>
<p>What the family really wanted was a retardation mental illness diagonsis so they could get generous SSI disability payments instead of stingy welfare payments for the girl.</p>
<p>My friend gave the girl an IQ and Minnasota multiphasic test and concluded there was nothing wrong with her.  He told the parents.</p>
<p>The parents replied that if he didn&rsquo;t write a retardation reccomendation for their SSI application they would report to the police that he had molested the girl.</p>
<p>My friend said ok, let me dictate the diagnose to my clerk.  He went to the receptionist phone, called the police and told them there were invaders in the office.  He said this to insure that the police would get there right away instead of coming by hours later to take a report.</p>
<p>The police arrived.  He explained what had happened and the police took the gypsies away.  The next day he got a call from a detective.  He was told, don&rsquo;t worry about it, gypsies are known to make false reports to the police when things go their way.  They often make false reports about each other.</p>
<p>He did have to go to the police station and sign an affadavit about had happened, just in case the gypsies came back with more false charges.  </p>

			<p>When I lived in Florida, there was a gypsy community in St. Petersburg that was always scamming the seniors who retired there.  They were merciless to vulnerable widows - they would knock on their front doors and tell them that they were workmen who were driving by and had noticed something terribly wrong with the roof.  Then they&rsquo;d intimidate the old women into giving them thousands of dollars in cash and disappear.  </p>
<p>Fortune telling scams were also common; they&rsquo;d convince senile people to give their life savings to the gypsies to &#8220;lift a curse&#8221;.  One gypsy was arrested for stealing $140,000 from an elderly woman via the curse nonsense!  Sometimes they would follow shoppers around in the parking lot of my local grocery store to beg and offer &#8220;fortunes&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Yet another stereotype that is true - Gypsies are thieving beggars.    </p>
