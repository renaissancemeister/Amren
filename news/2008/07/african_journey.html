						<p>As members of the SMU men&rsquo;s basketball team workout and prepare for the upcoming season, they do so with a new perspective on three teammates and their team as a whole.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think now they really know like where we came from,&#8221; said senior center Bamba Fall.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was very eye-opening,&#8221; says sophomore guard Mike Walker. &#8220;You get to know the guys on the team and everything, but to be able to see where they come from and why they act the way they act .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is very enlightening.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team returned last month after a 12-day trip across Africa to play and teach basketball and to learn about teammates like Fall, Papa Dia and Mouhammad Faye, all from Senegal.</p>
<p>&#8220;What they have to go through just to play the game on an everyday basis just makes you think twice and appreciate what you have a lot more, a lot more,&#8221; says Walker, who grew up Iowa City, Iowa.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And both before the trip and during they took an anthropology class, Peoples of Africa, with a professor along for the journey. They had daily class meetings and kept journals about their experiences on the trip.</p>

			<p>And I am sure that they each had an in depth final examination also! Since these members were all majoring in Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Economics, Statistics, and Engineering, the Peoples of Africa (what? this sure ain&rsquo;t no English professor who tagged along) had to have been an elective course designed to satisfy their humanities requirement.      </p>
<p>Why is it considered enriching to tour a country where the gross national product is considerably less than Toyota&rsquo;s? Would Einstein have been enriched if he had spent years in the outback of Australia talking only to aborigines? Would the aborigines have understood any of Einstein&rsquo;s theories?   </p>
<p>I have a pretty good understanding of what spitting cobras are all about. I don&rsquo;t think that I would be further &#8220;enriched&#8221; by sleeping in a bed full of them.</p>
<p>And finally, what is all this enrichment about anyway? Are these basketball players somehow better? Are they going to win the NCAA tournament simply because they went to Africa? Are they going to make more money? Are they going to benefit spiritually? Is this &#8220;enrichment&#8221; in any way quantifiable?</p>
<p>I spent two years in a high traffic area in Vietnam from 1969 to 1971 in a combat push force. At no time did I ever feel that I was being &#8220;enriched&#8221;! The skills I learned there would have little application outside of a career in crime.</p>
<p>Give me a beautiful sailboat, an open sea, blue water, and the wind and I will feel enriched beyond words!</p>

			<p>Why should the basketball team go to Africa to experience Africa?  When it is probably all but one or two African anyway.</p>

			<p>why don&rsquo;t they go to Germany or England and show the &#8216;africans&rsquo; what civilization is (or at least used to be)?</p>

			<p>&#8220;Texans visit Senegal and are enriched.&#8221;</p>
<p>What a pity they didn&rsquo;t elect to enrich themselves further and decide to stay. <br>

			<p>I disagree with some of your comments.  Travelling and experiencing other cultures really is enriching.  I love to travel to exotic places every chance I get because it&rsquo;s so educational.  Though subSaharan Africa is not near the top of my list of places I wish to visit, I have no doubt that there are many interesting places to visit in that part of the world.  Much can be learned from primitive cultures.  When those primitive cultures are imported, en masse, to live among us whether we want them or not - that&rsquo;s when we have problems.<br>

<p>I agree. It is a good thing to travel and see other countries, be it in europe or africa. I do think it opens one&rsquo;s eyes. However, as was said, the problem occurs when we import many of these nations into our own countries. I believe in enjoying diversity when it occurs in other countries, just not importing it into my own.</p>
