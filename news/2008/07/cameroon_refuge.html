						<p>A Cameroonian poet and activist living in Poland as a refugee since 1999 went on trial Friday in Warsaw charged with having &#8220;knowingly infected&#8221; 11 women with the HIV virus, his lawyer said.</p>
<p>Held behind closed doors to protect the identity of the victims, the trial of Simon Moleke Njie, 34, also known as Simon Mol, is expected to last &#8220;at least a several months,&#8221; defence lawyer Mikolaj Pietrzak said.</p>
<p>Polish police detained the suspect in January 2007 after one of his victims filed a criminal complaint against him.</p>
<p>Mol told investigators he had not known he was HIV positive and that he had tested negative for the virus in 1999. But Polish police investigators found that several of his partners told him they had tested positive for the disease after having had intimate relations with him.</p>
<p>Mol became a darling of Poland&rsquo;s liberal press for organising vocal campaigns against racism and supporting the cause of refugees in Poland.</p>
<p>The women allegedly infected by Mol range in age from 20-25. Mol is believed to have initially asked them to translate his articles and poems into Polish.</p>
<p>The charges carry a maximum penalty of 10 years behind bars.</p>
<p>Mol is also suspected of infecting two other women, currently residing outside Poland.</p>

			<p>What are blacks DOING in Poland? And shame on those Polish women!</p>
			<p>
				Posted by  at  6:25 PM on July 22</font> </p>

			<p>&#8220;A Cameroonian poet and activist living in Poland as a refugee since 1999 went on trial Friday in Warsaw charged with having &ldquo;knowingly infected&rdquo; 11 women with the HIV virus, his lawyer said.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think those women infected should be required to have some kind of indentifying mark that would warn others who come in contact with them that they are HIV positive.  </p>
<p>We need women like these OUT of the white gene pool, right along with gullible males who practically trip over themselves to favor these black primitives some way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mol became a darling of Poland&rsquo;s liberal press for organising vocal campaigns against racism and supporting the cause of refugees in Poland.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, the main objective of this primitive is to force his way into a Western country and complain that they&rsquo;re racist because he doesn&rsquo;t feel as if he&rsquo;s accorded the high honor by everyone that&rsquo;s due him.  You see, wherever blacks go they&rsquo;re totally preoccupied with whining about being a victim, and we can guess why:  He&rsquo;s too dumb to make it on his own, so he has to employ crybaby tactics hoping to intimidate the gullible fools on the left to support him and give him freebies.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a good example of the top notch African immigrant Robert Lindsey wants us to believe is a cut above the norm and out-performs whites academically.  I think Cameroon is about a 62 group I.Q. average, but I&rsquo;m not sure without checking.  It&rsquo;s somewhere in that range.  But in any event is there a better example of black failure than to note that Poland is at the bottom of the economic heap, yet it is doing so much better than African countries blacks are frantically trying to sneak in at all hours of the day and night?</p>
<p>Well, the bottom line to all this is that there are now at least 11 foolish women&hellip;.but probably more&hellip;&hellip;that this weird looking character has infected, which probably places Poland at risk of an epidemic from the others who are there.</p>
<p>Incidentally, reading the tripe that blacks write that is pushed as poetry is nothing but garbled stupidity, about as creative as a stick figure trying to pass as art.</p>

			<p>The study about white women preferring white men.  Again I ask is that study correct?  </p>

			<p>It isn&rsquo;t just Poland. There were similar cases in other Eureopean countries and Australia. In Canada, there are 4 such cases just off the top of my head: 3 African refugees or immigrants, and 1 African-American player in the Canadian Football League. All of them infected at least 10 women out of many others they put at risk while knowing they were HIV+. In one case, there were nearly 30 altogether. There could have been other women who did not come forward.</p>
<p>What can we learn from these cases? (1) Confirms stereotypes about African sexuality as if there is nothing else on their mind (2) not just blatant disregard for the well being of others but a psychopathic killer (3) the curious willingness of many women as seen by the number of those who came forward to testify and the possibility of others who did not.</p>

			<p>Well if this isn&rsquo;t Political Correctness in a nutshell, I don&rsquo;t know what is. The irony, of course, is that this time leftism infected itself with the disease, be it that the only women that would lay with him were lefty, hippie types. </p>

Yes. Most definitely. I see these as a sort of race crime.  A clear expression of race hate.  By his actions, he&rsquo;s saying, &#8220;If I have to die, I&rsquo;m going to take a whole bunch of you with me!&#8221; </p>

Virtually all women believe the &#8216;we are all equal&rsquo; dogma, but, they apparently also seem to believe that some are more equal than others. In your post you are basically saying, all stupid women who believe this (all women) deserve to get AIDS. Is it all to be found in your book, How to gain friends and influence people? </p>
<p>By the way, I don&rsquo;t understand, as a conscious white, your apparently aversion (an aversion so ingrained it doesn&rsquo;t even need to be spelled out) to the &#8216;we are all equal&rsquo; dogma. Oh - I could understand your aversion to those working under this banner, or the way it is carried out - what is done under it&rsquo;s name, but, wouldn&rsquo;t a, &#8216;we are all equal&rsquo; mantra be preferable to the current discrimination and double standards? Preferable, that is, if you&rsquo;re working for the interest of whites. </p>

			<p>I imagine the press in these cases act surprised. It&rsquo;s not too much of a surprise, however. You can blame this in part on the gay/liberal lobby. Whether or not someone has AIDS is a secret guarded more closely than nuclear technology. They don&rsquo;t have to tell you. They are even encouraged to tell you, even in all honesty, they don&rsquo;t have AIDS. They will tell you that if you ask. You might discover later that they do have HIV, a virus that could possibly lead to AIDS.</p>
<p>These cases always have multiple victims every time. I never understand that. If AIDS is a disease created by the white man, and they&rsquo;ve been infected, why don&rsquo;t they just stick to killing one white person?  </p>

<p>Always the same story.  They voluntarily choose to move to a white country, when over two dozen black ones are available, and as soon as they arrive start whining about racism and discrimination   &mdash;   and at the same time, campaign to bring in more of their countrymen!  </p>
<p>Perhaps, for this guy and others, it was really about access to white women all along.  I found a quote an another website which also confirms that at least some of the women who slept with this guy were influenced heavily by their own leftist ideas:</p>
<p>&#8220;Monika O., literature student who met with Simon Mol 11 months earlier, contacted the police in November this year.</p>
<p>- I was attracted by journalism, I wanted to write about Migrator Theater - she describes. - I was fascinated by human rights activist fighting with racial stereotypes. Soon we started to meet, went to bed. I didn&rsquo;t suspect that he could infect me with HIV virus and even less, hide from me that he is infected. I also thought that suspecting him of being infected would equal giving way to stereotypes. Thus we made love unprotected.&#8221;</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m not in the least bit surprised the women were curious enough to sleep with this character. Many if not most countries in Europe import American TV shows, where blacks are consistently cast either as heroes, or as the hapless victims of racist white villains, or both. Also, most european countries have MTV which also reinforces the perception of &#8220;black=cool; white=uncool&#8221;. (Snoop Dogg, Chris Brown, and Ne-Yo, black musicians, all appear on MTV Poland&rsquo;s homepage.)  Compounding this problem is the fact that many Europeans don&rsquo;t have enough first-hand experience with blacks to be able to form their own conclusions and, understandably enough, get their beliefs from the innacurate portrayals in American TV and movies.</p>

			<p>This is a disgrace.  It&rsquo;s hard to feel sorry for these women who are so utterly stupid.  Their lives are going to be cut short from a lack of common sense.  Children, especially girls, need to be educated about the facts of racial and ethnic differences from an early age.  The fact that black men are 20 times more likely to carry AIDS then white men is no anomaly.  This fact alone should keep white women from having relations with black men but sadly in this case it didn&rsquo;t.  I do not, nor have I ever understood why any white woman would want to be with a black man.  I&rsquo;ve asked my wife for help on this brain buster but she can&rsquo;t understand it either.</p>

			<p>So how  come  Mol is  not  yet  dead  from  this  supposedly  highly  morbid disease  &mdash;  after at  least  9  years  of  being  HIV+?  And his  very willing  paramours?  I am sure  they  are  all  well enough  to  attend  the  &#8220;trial&#8221;.  But  the  question is: what  fool-proof  evidence  could they  muster  up  to  convince  the  skeptical that  Mol&rsquo;s the  one?</p>

			<p>&#8220;Virtually all women believe the &lsquo;we are all equal&rsquo; dogma&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>They really don&rsquo;t, pal. Despite the fact that some give lip service to it. </p>
<p>Hence the fact that 97% of American white women marry within their race. If we believed in indiscriminate race-mixing the white interracial marriage rate would be above 44%.</p>
<p>I have followed this story, and I can tell you that this Mol character, manipulated and coerced a small group of leftist college students into death, by threats and lies. </p>
<p>Any woman with normal decency would not defile themselves in such a way, but these girls were young, brainwashed by PC, were coerced by this animal.</p>
<p>Most Polish women are disgusted by this story.</p>

			<p> It appears that all the communist propaganda over the years still has some effect in present day Poland. Of course, in many ways, we in the West are even more concerned about radical equality, and the &#8220;great dream&#8221; of eliminating racism through miscegenation. This man is a poet in the same way that I&rsquo;m a &ldquo;rocket scientist&rdquo; on the fourth of July. I feel sorry for the Polish women who contracted AIDS from this thug/creep, but they should have known better. </p>

<p>Being naive on the topic, I asked a question something like this several months ago.  My question, basically, was:  &#8220;Isn&rsquo;t AIDS considered a death sentence?   Therefore, why is So-and-so still alive?&#8221; </p>
<p>There were several well-informed replies to the effect that while AIDS is  still not <i>curable, </i> it is now <i>controllable, </i> and that infected parties can now live for many years if given proper treatment.  I did not know that.   That&rsquo;s the best I can remember.  I invite anyone more knowledgeable to corret me on this.</p>

<p>Ah, thanks for reminding me about &#8220;those enemies&#8221;.  It&rsquo;s been, what, two days, since I last heard about them.  Sixty plus years on, and were still blaming them for everything while the Stalinists run wild.  Aren&rsquo;t they a useful bunch?<br>

<p>If you give a black man status, nine times out of ten he will turn it into sexual currency with white women. That goes for sports, politics, entertainment and all else. Ignorant white women think they&rsquo;re getting some of that status with their bodies.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a story of moral failure.  </p>
