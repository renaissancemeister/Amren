						<p>Tomeika Broussard thought it was so absurd when she overheard her supervisor refer to her as a &#8220;reggin&#8221; that she just laughed. Then she realized it was the n-word spelled backward.</p>
<p>The only African-American in the small medical clinic in Los Gatos, Calif., Broussard said she was subjected to racial slurs almost daily. They were not the overt ones that most people would immediately recognize, but rather subtle, surreptitious code words that sometimes take a while to figure out.</p>
<p>&#8220;When &lsquo;reggin&rsquo; came up, I&rsquo;d never heard that word but I knew it was negative. So I had this kind of nervous, shocked laugh,&#8221; said Broussard, 31, who was awarded $44,000 in damages last year in a racial harassment lawsuit filed after she was fired from her job as a file clerk. &#8220;I didn&rsquo;t know whether it was illegal, but I knew it was not OK. It was humiliating.&#8221;</p>
<p>Federal officials say they have seen an increase in harassment complaints involving coded words and images in the workplace. Whether it is geared toward racial groups, religious affiliations, sex or sexual orientation, code words have proliferated in recent years through the Internet, where Web sites provide forums for creating, discussing and spreading new words promoting intolerance.</p>
<p>With Democratic Sen. Barack Obama as the first African-American to head a major-party ticket, political analysts predict race will become a central issue in the presidential election. Negative messages about race used in the campaigns and in the media could spill over into the general public, the analysts said, conjuring old stereotypes and stirring fears that create racial tension.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Terms such as &#8220;welfare queens&#8221; and &#8220;crime-ridden neighborhoods&#8221; have long been used to refer to African-Americans, Dawson said. In recent years, other analysts said, discussions about patriotism have increasingly become coded with phrases such as &#8220;full-blooded Americans&#8221; used to exclude certain ethnic groups, particularly Latino immigrants.</p>
<p>During the Democratic primary season, Sen. Hillary Clinton was accused of using racial code when she said that Obama&rsquo;s support among &#8220;hardworking Americans, white Americans,&#8221; was weakening. The inference, critics said, is that only white Americans work hard.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Reading the subtleties</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Since the first racial code word lawsuit in 1996, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has seen an influx of cases involving racially coded messages. In the earlier case, the federal appeals court in Philadelphia overturned a lower court ruling and found in favor of a credit manager who sued Cort Furniture Rental. Carol Aman said she and other black employees were referred to as &#8220;you people&#8221; and &#8220;that one in there.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As the country becomes more diverse, cases also have resulted from culture clashes between African-Americans, Hispanics and Asians, according to the EEOC.</p>
<p>For example, an assembly technician in San Jose, Calif., sued the company he worked for last year, claiming he was harassed by a Vietnamese co-worker who repeatedly played loud rap music with anti-black racial epithets. The lawsuit charged the co-worker also sang the lyrics within earshot of him.</p>
<p>In another case, a black employee was repeatedly called &#8220;Cornelius&#8221; in a reference to the ape character from the movie &#8220;Planet of the Apes.&#8221; Another case involved a man of Chinese and Italian ancestry who was taunted daily by his foreman, who referred to him as &#8221; Bruce Lee.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Complaints overblown?</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Maurica Grant, 32, who was fired from her job as a technical inspector with NASCAR, filed a lawsuit claiming that she was repeatedly harassed. Grant, who is black, said co-workers called her &#8220;Nappy Headed Mo&#8221; and &#8220;Queen Sheba.&#8221; According to Grant, they also said she worked on &#8220;colored people time,&#8221; meaning she often was late.</p>
<p>EEOC officials said they also have seen cases of code words used to identify ethnic groups in job applications.</p>
<p>&#8220;Racial harassment is alive and well and manifesting itself in so many forms, especially with advances in technology allowing programs that screen out certain addresses and names associated with certain groups,&#8221; said Paula Bruner, appellate attorney for the EEOC in Washington. &#8220;It is a lot more pervasive than people appreciate.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Another Web site, the Racial Slur Database, defines 2,649 slurs. According to the site, its mission is &#8220;helping to make the world a better place.&#8221;<br>

			<p>You gotta check out the <a href="http://www.rsdb.org/" rel="nofollow">Racial Slur DataBase</a>! It&rsquo;s equal-opportunity offensive! There&rsquo;s something there for everyone to call their best friends or worst enemies. Life is too short to take this &#8220;stuff&#8221; seriously. :)</p>

			<p>So, the gist of this article is that they make up new words and insults&hellip; every single day&hellip; almost as the opportunity arises&hellip; just for the sheer fun of it, and do such things as play loud demeaning &#8216;anti-black&rsquo; rap music, and those poor blacks all across America have to suffer through it all.</p>
<p>The justice system and the media, once again amaze us with their accuracy, fair play, and knowledge of what&rsquo;s really going on out there. Ya can&rsquo;t fool the media or the justice system. They&rsquo;re professionals. That&rsquo;s their job. They discover the truth and act on it. That&rsquo;s what they are paid to do. All day. These are top notch professionals. I think the only ones who could possibly do a better job than them would be America&rsquo;s educators, but I don&rsquo;t want to sell them short. </p>

			<p> This is hardly new. Whites routinely call blacks all sorts of racist names coded and overt. most of the time they get away with it too. I used to work in commuications ion the late 1980s. During meetings some of the most ignorant, racist and some sexist comments would ever hear came flying out of people&rsquo;s mouths. I told my supervisor that they were not paying me enought to deal with such ignorant, callous, crude commnets. His repsnse was &#8220;well this is how the environment is here, either adjust to it or you may want to consider leaving.&#8221; istayed for a fe more months. During this time, I divorced myself from most of my co-workers. As far as I was concerned they were out of sigh and out of mind.</p>
<p>By March 1989, I left and started my own consulting firm that specailizes in issues that related to women of color. Now at the age of 48, I am happily and fincially secure.</p>
<p>The fact is that this story does not surprise me at all. <br>
Hopefully some lawsuits will stop this continuing harrassment of Blacks and other minorities. </p>

<p>Nappy Headed Mo.  That&rsquo;s pretty clever, actually!  The &#8220;Queen Sheba&#8221; nickname makes me wonder if she went around acting like some entitled prima donna.</p>
<p>As for &#8220;colored people time,&#8221; what Ms. Grant COULD have done was proven the stereotype wrong by being prompt every day.  That would have shut up her coworkers.  But I guess she preferred to sue instead and get a nice lump of free money.</p>

 Reminds me of a scene in &#8220;Pretty Woman &#8221; that irritates the hell out of me. After Julia Roberts is beaten up by a guy, she asks her Prince Charnming if there is a secret special school that teachs men how to hurt women. He replies, &#8220;Not ALL guys hit.&#8221; Yeah, uh-huh. Meaning what?  That  most guys do?!? One of the first subliminal media insertions I ever picked up on. Now I could write a book&hellip;</p>

			<p>It is interesting to see just how people whine to cover the truth. These people would have been respected it they had worked hard and been regular folks (Unless that is a code phase for White). For Example, if the NASCAR babe had showed up on time and worked hard, she would have gotten respect. Instead, through her own actions she earned the observation of working on &#8220;colored people time&#8221;. </p>
<p>When I was 25, I got into trick shooting with revolvers. Being so young, and meeting men who had been in the game longer than I had been alive. I was treated to the usual &#8220;Rookie&#8221; and &#8220;College Boy&#8221; Jokes, till I started shooting golf balls out of the air. Work hard, prove yourself to men who have also worked hard, and quit whining.</p>

			<p>The racial slur database is beyond ridiculous.  Among other whoppers, it suggests that the term &#8220;coon&#8221; might have been coined in relation to Carleton Coon.  The Random House Unabridged Dictionary says that coon as a racial slur originated between 1735 and 1745.  Carleton Coon was born in 1904 and wasn&rsquo;t well known until at least the late 1930s.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;According to Grant, they also said she worked on &lsquo;colored people time,&rsquo; meaning she often was late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So here is a question, was she really often late?</p>
<p>My guess is that she was, and then gave absurd excuses as to why she was; then, if these ridiculous excuses were not accepted as &ldquo;holy writ,&rdquo; she put on a &ldquo;performance.&rdquo; By &ldquo;performance,&rdquo; I mean the: screeching, frenetic, cacophonous, and obscene verbal bombardment that black females engage in when they are confronted with an actual reality, that does not conform with their distorted version of it. Much like the: huffing, puffing, eye glaring, and nostril flaring of their male counterparts of color, this is a tactic of intimidation that is almost universal among black females.</p>
<p>While certainly contributing to a diversity of behavior and decorum in a workplace, it does also tax the same without any hope of repose. Laughably, that is what is inherently wrong with &ldquo;those people&rdquo; or other entitlement groups &ldquo;of color&rdquo; in communion with them; they all seem to feel that simply because the federal &ldquo;government&rdquo; dictates the &ldquo;urgency&rdquo; of accommodating them, that it makes such: &ldquo;right&rdquo; and &ldquo;just.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that fallacy in mind, we need all cry out loudly, God Help Us All!<br>

As much as we white folks might hate the entire ridiculous racial-whining industry, I think we&rsquo;re not going to have any choice but to start lodging complaints ourselves. If we can&rsquo;t stop others from filing these hateful hatespeech suits against us   &mdash;   and I see no relief on the horizon   &mdash;   then we&rsquo;ll simply have to file suits against them. We should have our lawyers draw up papers and call the media every time some nonwhite calls us &#8220;cracker,&#8221; &#8220;honky,&#8221; &#8220;whitebread,&#8221; and whatnot   &mdash;   and I mean EVERY time. </p>
<p>If we did so, we could absolutely FLOOD these agencies with so much paperwork they&rsquo;d BEG us to stop. Any one Jeremiah Wright sermon from the past 20 years picked at random should be good for a couple dozen anti-white defamation actions, easy. Ditto Jesse. Ditto Sharpton. </p>
<p>Any lawyers out there want to weigh in on this one? <br>

			<p>But always remember: Code words/racial slurs are offensive ONLY if used by Whites against non-Whites. Non-Whites, of course, are not only allowed but actively encouraged to use as many derogatory terms for Whites as they can think up.</p>
<p>Like hate crimes being something ONLY Whites can be guilty of, tossing racial slurs and insults are also lmited to Whites only. Blacks, Mexicans can do so without anyone being allowed to feel offended.</p>

			<p>I did some research on the net. I found the word reggin being used as the term identifying one who listens to or follows reggae. Makes me wonder if this was settled out of court because the manager made the reference due to either she mentioned a likeing of reggae or she listened to it at work? Kinda like getting in trouble for calling yourself a white african american spear chukkar when you are the only person in the company who had been born in africa, threw javalin in college but has white skin&hellip;..HR depts in the US dont have a clue when they get a racism counter suite with birth certificate attached after that..</p>

			<p>The majority of these lawsuits are frivolous, costing businesses and consumers a small fortune, and clogging our courts, to boot.<br>
I think we need to come up with a few new slurs to identify the scam artists who pursue these frivolous lawsuits, shakedowns from the likes of Rev. Al, noose hoaxes, Duke LaCrosse-type hoaxes, and the like.<br>
Tomeika Broussard, who scammed $44,000 from the medical facility where she worked, aided by our complicit Government, could be called a &#8220;Nooser&#8221; or a &#8220;Tawana&#8221; or a &#8220;Mangum&#8221; or a &#8220;Sharpton&#8221;, or perhaps her very own first name, a &#8220;Tomeika.&#8221; <br>
Just think, a &#8220;Tomeika&#8221; scrawled across the top of an application form might save a small company something to the tune of, well, $44,000.</p>

<p>Nor does that insanity we call &#8220;political correctness.&#8221; It&rsquo;s time to stop kowtowing to minorities. If they get offended&hellip; tough beans, amigo! If you chose to feel slighted or offended by what a White might say, that&rsquo;s YOUR problem. We Whites feel a bit offended ourselves. By the incredible amount of criminals among the Afro-Americans. By the incredible amount of criminals among the Latinos living in our country   &mdash;   regardless of whether they Latinos are here legally, or scurried across the border in the dark of night.</p>

<p>       Does Vietnamese &#8220;rap music&#8221; with anti-black lyrics really exist? If the music is in sung in Vietnamese, how could you know what they are singing? You would have to know Vietnamese! Personally, I&rsquo;ve never heard any commercial rap music with anti-black lyrics. </p>
<p>This whole &#8220;hate speech&#8221; business is a real racket. Do people honestly deserve hundreds of thousands of dollars because their feelings were hurt? Maybe, at best, someone deserves an apology and the offender a letter in their personnel file. Repeat offenders could get suspension, or in extreme cases of actual long term harassement termination, but thousands even millions of dollars paid for hurt feelings? If I was paid thousands everytime I had my feelings hurt by comments from my co-workers over the last thirty five years, I&rsquo;d be as rich as Croesus.</p>

			<p>I am sure there is a reader who works in a setting, most likely a Government one, where as a white person they are a minority.  I have no doubt that black and brown people use racial slurs towards white co-workers.  And keep in mind whites are not a protected class, and will have no re-course.</p>

			<p>Why is it that whites are never offended by racial slurs against whites, but minorities always are?  I&rsquo;ll tell you why, because a racial slur is nothing more than another word or phrase for describing ones race.  </p>
<p>Whites are proud of our race, so being called white by a minority using a racial slur that means white only makes us smile.  Minorities, on the other hand, are so full of racial self-loathing that that hate being reminded of what they are&hellip;</p>

			<p>Just don&rsquo;t talk to them, and don&rsquo;t ignore them either. You can&rsquo;t win, so try not to say anything. If you are white you are always wrong, no matter what you say or don&rsquo;t say, and no matter how you do it. If you see a piano falling about to hit a black person and you holler, &#8220;Hey, You!&#8221; at him, he will get out of the way, and then sue you for using a racial slur to address him.</p>

black:&#8221;Wot fo&rsquo;you lookin at me,yo wants tuh die?&#8221;Dad just looked<br>
at him,and waved his hand at him,in a gesture of disgust,and<br>
said,&#8221;Your&rsquo;re nuts!&#8221;And drove off.I worked part-time at a local<br>
YMCA branch(Socialism at its best)where a black woman,&#8221;working<br>
on black time&#8221;(always late)said,&#8221;What for you lookin at me,dat<br>
way?You look like you wants to kill me.&#8221;I was told to face the<br>
front door,at all times,to greet members.A member stepped up to<br>
the counter,as this was happening,and said to me:&#8221;What is this?&#8221;<br>
You have to LOOK a certain way?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;As much as we white folks might hate the entire ridiculous racial-whining industry, I think we&rsquo;re not going to have any choice but to start lodging complaints ourselves. If we can&rsquo;t stop others from filing these hateful hatespeech suits against us  &mdash;  and I see no relief on the horizon  &mdash;  then we&rsquo;ll simply have to file suits against them. We should have our lawyers draw up papers and call the media every time some nonwhite calls us &ldquo;cracker,&rdquo; &ldquo;honky,&rdquo; &ldquo;whitebread,&rdquo; and whatnot  &mdash;  and I mean EVERY time.</p>
<p>If we did so, we could absolutely FLOOD these agencies with so much paperwork they&rsquo;d BEG us to stop. Any one Jeremiah Wright sermon from the past 20 years picked at random should be good for a couple dozen anti-white defamation actions, easy. Ditto Jesse. Ditto Sharpton.</p>
<p>Any lawyers out there want to weigh in on this one?</p>

<p>I believe you have &#8220;broken the code,&#8221; so to speak. It doesn&rsquo;t even matter if the complaints are taken seriously; they still have to waste time/money investigating them.</p>

			<p>I worked for a college radio station. As part of their effort to root out ignorance and evil we were orientated as a group and given a copy of the diversity policy and the station manager spoke to our group about it. One of the examples listed of things that couldn&rsquo;t be said at work was &#8216;white boy&rsquo;. This was the first and last time I&rsquo;ve ever witnessed the forces of inclusion include white men. For the most part this simple orientation seemed surprisingly successful. </p>
<p>They would play songs a lot in the different booths (to work on commercials, etc) and cubicles at the station. I did the news there. I still remember the song &#8216;Unity (U.N.I.T.Y.)&rsquo; by Queen Latifa being played at the station. Whenever an unattractive uh, white boy would walk by the black girls at the studio would sing along to it together extra loud apparently in reference to the guy who was a bit too ugly for their tastes. </p>

			<p>Some very good ideas expressed here. Resisting Defamation has been working toward developing a database of terms expressing hatred toward the diverse white American peoples for 18 years. We rapidly discovered the need for a way to determine what were grounds for deciding what was a slur and what were not (mere offensiveness not being adequate for us in public opinion), and came up with the necessary ingredients. We hope this analysis will prove helpful to attorneys in the future who need to have an independent resource in this regard. To see a copy of an ad we did in June blasting our daily newspaper for using slurs against the diverse white American peoples, go to: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.resistingdefamation.org/sub/metro.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.resistingdefamation.org/sub/metro.asp</a></p>
<p>To see our online syllabus, go to:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.resistingdefamation.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.resistingdefamation.org/</a></p>
<p>By the way, the confusion between &#8220;protected classification&#8221; and &#8220;protected group&#8221; needs to be cleared up. In hate crime and fair employment statutes, white Americans are in the &#8220;protected classification&#8221; of race. The only place that &#8220;protected groups&#8221; applies is in language statutes and, in them, all non-English speakers are protected groups and all English speakers are not protected so far as language use is concerned.</p>
<p>There is something very strange about the assumption of the existence of &#8220;protected groups&#8221; within hate crime and fair employment statutes, but it is just not true that the concept applies. It is a doctrine that is taught to law enforcement personnel and the print &amp; electronic media, however, but it is not correct. If you are assaulted and called &#8220;redneck peckerwood honky&#8221; or &#8220;breeder, breeder&#8221; or &#8220;round-eyed white devil,&#8221; you are considered eligible for the crime against you to be treated as a hate crime for sentence enhancing or based on an ethnic intimidation theory. Getting law enforcement and prosecutors to act is another thing, and confusing &#8220;protected group&#8221; with &#8220;protected classification&#8221; is not a help in educating ourselves about how to talk with those officials.</p>

<p>And you would be right. I worked in a specialized narcotics enforcement group comprised for a time of 14 Hispanics, myself and one Asian American guy. Immediately I was assigned as a partner to the Asian guy and we worked hard and began to show better stats than the other teams. I was routinely greeted in the morning by a yell of &#8220;Hey you white piece of ****&#8221;. Every single day that and worse was said to me and the similar anti asian slurs were cast upon my partner. Daily this was done in front of Hispanic supervisors and did not stop when I complained   &mdash;   in fact my supervisor told me &#8220;Stop acting like a nerd&#8221; when I lodged a complaint. In fact the only way it stopped was when I pulled several of the guys aside after about a year of this and threatened them with violence and then asked to transfer to a different group. My experiences with that group are the reason I began my journey towards racial equity in life and why I read this board.<br>
Interestingly enough, several of the groups supervisors threatened to sue our organization over racial inequities in promotion and they all miracuously rose to top positions over the years before I retired a few years ago.</p>

<p>La, While I&rsquo;m pleased to read that you have started a business directed at assisting people of colour, and good luck to you with that venture, I notice that you excluded Whites from your concerns when it comes to people being harrassed.  Was this just a slip up?.<br>
 Why didn&rsquo;t you include White people in your statement?  How do you feel about White people taking legal action against Blacks or other non whites for racial insults? does the prospect please you?<br>

			<p>Although my ancestors left Germany long before the Austrian Corporal arrived, I cannot make a reference to German culture without hearing some sort of Heil-Hitler remark, usually from a Black or Latin.  I have never liked this sort of thing, but  I have gotten used to it; it simply proves the speaker&rsquo;s ignorance.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m disappointed by the list in one respect, and that is that one of the slurs for subcontinental Indians is missing: &#8220;pull-start&#8221; (Sikhs with turbans) and &#8220;push-start&#8221; (women with the red forehead dot painted on) are present, but &#8220;curry-n*****&#8221; (self-explanatory) is not.</p>
<p>A question I would like to ask LA is whether he or she thinks it would be fair for someone&rsquo;s small business to be bankrupted in a lawsuit, merely because one employee calls another one &#8220;green-eyed devil&#8221;.  The money to settle these harrassment suits you approve of so much has to come from somewhere, and somehow, it never seems to come out of the pockets of the offending employees.<br>

Nah.  This poor guy was probably just playing typical gangsta rap which consists of gibberish interspersed with multiple uses of the n-word.  You know, the kind of &#8220;music&#8221; authentic American blacks created. </p>
<p>Personally, I think it would be a great idea if it were illegal for non-blacks to buy or listen to music containing the n-word.  Same with videos/movies. Then the rap industry and black media productions could be purely &#8220;a black thing&#8221; that other races wouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to understand or waste money on.  It would be a black cultural victory!  /s<br>
