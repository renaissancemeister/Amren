<h1><a href="https://apnews.myway.com/article/20080729/D927Q66O0.html">House Formally Apologizes for Slavery and Jim Crow</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jim Abrams, AP, July 29, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The House on Tuesday issued an unprecedented apology to black Americans for the wrongs committed against them and their ancestors who suffered under slavery and Jim Crow segregation laws.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The resolution, passed by voice vote, was the work of Tennessee Democrat Steve Cohen, the only white lawmaker to represent a majority black district. Cohen faces a formidable black challenger in a primary face-off next week.</p>
<p>Congress has issued apologies before &mdash; to Japanese-Americans for their internment during World War II and to native Hawaiians for the overthrow of the Hawaiian kingdom in 1893. In 2005, the Senate apologized for failing to pass anti-lynching laws.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Cohen resolution does not mention reparations. It does commit the House to rectifying &#8220;the lingering consequences of the misdeeds committed against African-Americans under slavery and Jim Crow.&#8221;</p>
<p>It says that Africans forced into slavery &#8220;were brutalized, humiliated, dehumanized and subjected to the indignity of being stripped of their names and heritage&#8221; and that black Americans today continue to suffer from the consequences of slavery and Jim Crow laws that fostered discrimination and segregation.</p>
<p>The House &#8220;apologizes to African-Americans on behalf of the people of the United States, for the wrongs committed against them and their ancestors who suffered under slavery and Jim Crow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Slavery and Jim Crow are stains upon what is the greatest nation on the face of the earth,&#8221; Cohen said. {snip}</p>
<p>Cohen became the first white to represent the 60 percent black district in Memphis in more than three decades when he captured a 2006 primary where a dozen black candidates split the vote. He has sought to reach out to his black constituents, and early in his term showed interest in joining the Congressional Black Caucus until learning that was against caucus rules.</p>
<p>Another of his first acts as a freshman congressman in early 2007 was to introduce the slavery apology resolution. His office said that the House resolution was brought to the floor only after learning that the Senate would be unable to join in a joint resolution.</p>
