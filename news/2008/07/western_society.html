<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>IT may begin with a chuckle, but it could easily end in tears. At least, if we are not careful. One may be tempted to scoff at the demand to legalise polygamy made recently by Khalil Chami of Sydney&rsquo;s Islamic Welfare Centre. But with the recent announcement by Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams that the adoption of sharia law in Britain seems unavoidable, the joke may turn out to be on us.</p>
<p>Britain provides an instructive lesson on the interaction between increasingly radicalised sections of the Muslim diaspora community and its Western host society.</p>
<p>From Dundee to Dover, traditional British values, already weakened to the point of collapse by a decades-long elite infatuation with mushy multiculturalism and cultural relativism, cannot provide resistance against the growing tide of extreme demands by radical self-styled community spokesmen.</p>
<p>The same way that the claim of racism has been used to shut down any debate on cultural identity, immigration and social cohesion, so is Islamophobia increasingly used to silence dissent. To merely raise certain issues is to give offence, and offending sensibilities is a hanging offence in our postmodern times.</p>
<p>While radicals agitate, a politically correct establishment, at pains to prove how enlightened and tolerant it is, even if it means tolerating the intolerance of others, usually stands on the sidelines, if not actively cheering on another challenge to the ostensibly oppressive, hegemonic Western culture and polity.</p>
<p>In January last year, Britain&rsquo;s Channel 4 television broadcast a documentary on jihadi incitement in mosques throughout England. The material revealed by this undercover investigative report was quite incendiary in nature. One Saudi-trained imam called for British Muslims to &#8220;dismantle democracy&#8221; by &#8220;living as a state within a state&#8221; until they are &#8220;strong enough to take it over&#8221;.</p>
<p>Another Islamic radical praised the Taliban for killing British soldiers and argued that women who declined to wear the burka should be beaten into submission.</p>
<p>After the program was aired, British authorities wasted no time springing into action. The West Midlands Police lodged criminal charges, not against the extremist imams but against the TV network. Responding to a complaint by the Muslim Association of Britain, the police accused Channel 4 of inciting racial hatred by means of an ostensibly distorted documentary that demonised Islam. When the Crown Prosecution Service ultimately declined to pursue the matter, police referred the complaint to the British government broadcast oversight agency, OFCOM.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, an officer from the Wiltshire Police ordered a motorist to remove England&rsquo;s flag of St George from his automobile because it was &#8220;racist towards immigrants&#8221;.</p>
<p>Stand-up comedian Ben Elton recently asserted that fear of &#8220;provoking the radical elements of Islam&#8221; caused the BBC to censor jokes about Muslim clerics. &#8220;There&rsquo;s no doubt about it,&#8221; Elton said, &#8220;the BBC will let vicar gags pass but they would not let imam gags pass.&#8221;</p>
<p>This comes on the heels of a legion of other examples of often pre-emptive surrenders to yet unvoiced radical demands, such as some British banks withdrawing toy piggy banks or public institutions turning Christmas into an amorphous Winter Festival, all for the fear of offending Muslim sensibilities.</p>
<p>All this is rather ironic, since under the twin dogmas of multiculturalism and cultural relativism, all cultures and beliefs are meant to be equal. Like George Orwell&rsquo;s animals, however, some seem to be more equal than others. Commitment to cultural diversity all too often seems to disguise contempt for the dominant national culture that historically bound the society.</p>
<p>No wonder such large sections of the British establishment don&rsquo;t offer any resistance to the claims of fundamentalist radicals.</p>
<p>The case against Channel 4 was ultimately dismissed and the broadcaster won a pound stg. 100,000 ($206,000) civil judgment against the West Midlands Police. But even if sanity prevailed after much time and expense, the totalitarian echoes of this affair clearly have a chilling effect on freedom of expression. While a TV network has the requisite resources to wage a vigorous legal defence, less well-heeled victims of the thought police would be in real strife.</p>
<p>All this is worrying to the silent majority of Muslims who are not interested in political agitation but simply want to rear their families in peace, freedom and prosperity, so often lacking in countries where they or their ancestors have come from. It&rsquo;s hard to blame the moderates within the Muslim community for not speaking out more against the extremists when they see the establishment and the authorities so often and so easily buckling to radicals.</p>
<p>In Australia, federal Attorney-General Robert McClelland summarily dismissed Chami&rsquo;s demand for the legalisation of polygamy. But lest we feel too comfortable, it should be noted that the example of Britain demonstrates how quickly a national sense of cultural self-confidence can erode. Britain serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of unrestrained political correctness and cultural relativism.</p>
<p>After all, if Westminster democracy and Wahhabi theocracy are ethically equal, there is no reason to resist when freedom comes under assault from feudalism.</p>
<p>The essential question we face is not about the rule of law but about which law is to rule. Events in Britain teach us that Chami&rsquo;s proposal represents the thin end of the wedge in the creeping campaign to introduce Islamic jurisprudence into our legal system.</p>
<p>A nation with two legal systems, reflecting conflicting social and political philosophies, is a house divided and, as history shows, it cannot stand.</p>
<p>We must be culturally self-confident enough to assert that the monopoly status of common law and democracy in Australia is entirely non-negotiable. As Peter Costello said not so long ago: &#8220;If a person wants to live under sharia law, there are countries where they may feel at ease, but not Australia.&#8221;<br>

<p>The one part of the article that is pure balogna. The Muslim &#8220;silent majority&#8221; is not on our side - they&rsquo;re on the side of the radicals. They&rsquo;re afraid of speaking out and getting deported or the borders geting closed to their immigrant relatives.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that when societies become secular, as has Britain, the only religious displays they will tolerate<br>
are those that are aggressively assertive, destructive, and contemptuous of existing social mores.</p>

			<p><i>Cultural diversity means contempt for the dominant national culture. </i></p>
<p>Interestingly, there is no such contempt in non-Western civilizations. There, the dominant culture is supposed to rule, and our bleeding-heart Liberals don&rsquo;t seem to have problems with that.</p>
<p>Just a few decades ago, such contempt would be called what it is: treason on behalf of hostile nation(s). Now it mascarades as doing good for the humanity.<br>

			<p>They may think their motives are noble in standing fast against &#8220;racism&#8221;, but they are using multiculturalism to mask their fear.  Always remember that Islam means submission, and if you don&rsquo;t do what they tell you they&rsquo;ll kill you.  </p>
<p>Therefore, Islam must be resisted by any means necessary &hellip; while there&rsquo;s still time.</p>

			<p>I believe that it is very, very important to watch the goings-on in Great Britain in the future.  They&rsquo;re further along the politically-correct road than almost any other White country.  They are already a police state with close to 5 MILLION cameras nationwide.  They are beginning to come apart at the seams as a country, and as a people and the collective reality denial among them is astonishing.  The average British citizen is beginning to become utterly deracinated.  I&rsquo;ve noticed more British in the U.S. in the last few years, and I think they&rsquo;re coming over here because of the racial situation there now.  The few I&rsquo;ve spoken too just will not admit it and I believe it&rsquo;s not just a case of not admitting it to me; it&rsquo;s a case of them not even admitting it to themselves.</p>

			<p>The problem is that liberalism inflicts its negative externalities on society as a whole and thus is allowed to grow wackier and wackier until we all implode collectively.</p>
<p>Park the Imans outside the houses of rich establishment feminists and diversity-mongers, make them wear the hijab, and then we will how fast the wall comes tumbling down.</p>

			<p>[One Saudi-trained imam called for British Muslims to &ldquo;dismantle democracy&rdquo; by &ldquo;living as a state within a state&rdquo; until they are &ldquo;strong enough to take it over&rdquo;.]</p>
<p>So, what&rsquo;s new here?  I mean, every group that migrates to Western societies has takeover and control as its goal, whether expressed verbally or not.  The West does not have immigration, it has colonization.  And while it could be said that this situation is payback for all the imperialistic colonizing by them it really isn&rsquo;t payback at all, because it was never the rank and file in the West that wanted territorial expansion and imperialistic policies.  They&rsquo;re as much victims as anybody else.  It was the usual bunch of miscreants who took over the government then and are controlling it now.  </p>
<p>Different people with different ideas, but there&rsquo;s no difference in the perverted desire to control and manipulate the majority, which they are still doing only this time under the guise of another bizarre cult-like ideology known as multiculturalism, rather than imperialism, socialism, fascism, or communism.  </p>
<p>So whether it&rsquo;s any of these isms, or another one Western society&rsquo;s criminal class has thought up, these emotionally and mentally ill types just exchange one pathology for another.  The only thing important to them is that they have control, because they feel as if only their mediocre minds are brilliant enough to tell us what we should have, how we should act, and what we should do.</p>
<p>&#8220;After the program was aired, British authorities wasted no time springing into action. The West Midlands Police lodged criminal charges, not against the extremist imams but against the TV network.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, they&rsquo;re following their usual procedure and brutalizing anyone or anything that threatens to expose the dangers of their schemes, just as they have always done, and where there is a brutally oppressive police state there are always naive gullibles who pitch right in and assist the miscreants in enforcing their imposed restrictions on thought and speech.</p>
<p>[&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt about it,&rdquo; Elton said, &ldquo;the BBC will let vicar gags pass but they would not let imam gags pass.&rdquo;]</p>
<p>These restrictions serve to expose the incredible weakness of their policies.  They have rounded up the rattlesnakes from throughout the desert and swept them into town amongst the townspeople, because they perceive the move is necessary in their overall plan to create another one of their ism utopias,  telling everyone how it has made them stronger, while they frantically pursue procedures that will hammer any complaints about it into submission through vicious police state oppression.</p>
<p>As in the Nurenburg trials, it will be not only necessary to punish these people, after we have had enough and acted once again against another of their idiotic ideologies, it is absolutely vital to air their crimes in open court, so that mankind can guard against another round of outrages when they come up, embraced with the determination that &#8220;never again&#8221; will we allow our vigilance to slip so badly every kook, oddball and misfit springing out of the bushes can slip up on us and take control.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that some of the most firm believers and admirers of traditional Western Civilization at this point of &#8220;The decline of the West&#8221; are the Orientals. Since most white youth at this point are either partially or totally deracinated and ashamed and/or unaware of traditional Western culture, it&rsquo;s ironic that many black youth will still criticize one of their own who is seen as social climbing and trying to escape the ghetto as &#8220;acting white.&#8221; At this point, they should accuse such an individual of &#8220;acting Oriental&#8221; since there seems to be a higher percentage of young people of Chinese, Japanese and Korean background who admire and practice what used to be seen as white culture.</p>

<p>Not sure I&rsquo;d say &#8216;for no good reason&rsquo;. Perhaps they think if it supports diversity, it was all for a good cause.  </p>

<p>We are not cowards, but our leaders are, and we are ashamed of them. We are also ashamed of the BBC and the many other public organisations now dominated by Leftist traitors.</p>
<p>I am sure that if it comes to the last ditch we will see again the formidable fighting spirit of England..and that of Ireland, Scotland and Wales. </p>

<p>Yep, war is the ultimate in dysgenics. The best, brightest and strongest are sent into battle and killed, while the dullest and weakest stay behind and continue to breed. Keep that in mind next time some you hear some airhead call for reviving the draft. </p>

			<p>Yes, it is sad that I get to see the decline of our great western civilization right before my eyes. I am absolutely speechless at the behavior and talk from whites in Europe, Australia, and US. This is a mad world that I inhabit, now I am giving credence to the idea that it is now the ne asian century/millenia?? </p>
<p>I scoffed at this before but the asian young people that I come into contact with are healthy and group minded. They want to make their parents and family proud and willing to sacrifice for them. When I see some posters laughing at them for having &#8216;group think&rsquo; and not being &#8216;creative&rsquo;, I am sadly amused that this is probably the reason why they are staunchly upholding their civilization. I went to asia and was shocked at the nationalism and vigor of the people there. They were absolutely sure they didn&rsquo;t want foreign blood muddying up their genes. They emphatically want to preserve their culture and are puzzled at white nations. They couldn&rsquo;t understand why the whites are putting up with criminal and underachieving black/brown population. </p>
<p>When I compare the asian kids to the white kids, it makes me weep. The white kids are smart and doing well in general but mostly brainwashed into accepting anything into their genetic pool. They are also not very caring about their parents&rsquo; traditions or wishes.</p>

			<p>Reply to schoolteacher:</p>
<p> That could be the VERY REASON WHY Britain is such a pathetic country today - too many good and brave men were lost on the battlefield. I can&rsquo;t think of one single thing Britain ever gained from its self-inflicted German wars. An excellenet book about all of this is Patrick Buchanan, CHURCHILL, HITLER AND THE UNNECESARRY WAR.</p>

			<p>Ah yes. The incredible joy of foreign travel&hellip; meeting strange people&hellip; hearing of even stranger (yech) customs&hellip;</p>
<p>BEIJING - Canine cuisine is being sent to the doghouse during next month&rsquo;s Beijing Olympic Games.</p>
<p>Dog meat has been struck from the menus of officially designated Olympic restaurants, and Beijing tourism officials are telling other outlets to discourage consumers from ordering dishes made from dogs, the official Xinhua News Agency reported Friday</p>
<p>Belive it or not&hellip; this was on today&rsquo;s MSN Website. And the Chinese third-worlders probably would like to introduce this delectable cuisine to America. (Sorry, but our unwanted and despised Vietnamese nearly caused a riot in Texas back in the early 1980s for this same eating habit.)</p>
