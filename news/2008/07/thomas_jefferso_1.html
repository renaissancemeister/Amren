<h1><a href="http://www.wtop.com/index.php?nid=25&amp;sid=1440495">Thomas Jefferson High Changes Admissions Test</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, July 15, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Fairfax County school officials say the new test to get into the Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology will be more accessible to students who aren&rsquo;t native English speakers.</p>
<p>The test will eliminate quantitative comparisons in the math section. It also will have a shorter verbal section that will focus less on vocabulary and more on reasoning.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

			<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to see the bridges designed by illiterate non-English speakers who are math-challenged.</p>
<p>But no matter! Only equality of outcome matters, nothing else.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Focus less on vocabulary&#8221;<br>
 When I was in Night school my very last teacher was some kind of Persian guy who taught the mechanics and structure of computers. He had a see thru model and he was showing how a lot of it was baffles and such which in his words &#8220;Helped the heat circulate and escape.&#8221;. During the break I sidled up to him and  explained, &#8220;Out in  Big Block  hot-rod country we have a word for that&hellip; We call it dissipate&hellip;&#8221;  His eyes and his smile got big and he grinned almost as much at being made fun of as being educated by the guy who always showed up to class with sin on his breath. Later he leaned over my desk and whispered, &#8220;You know you have an A from now on no matter what&hellip;&#8221; I took it as tacit permission to peruse AMRen and You Tube during class.</p>

			<p>Having reviewed the cases of several white males in my neighborhood who have been rejected by TJ&rsquo;s in the past several years I can attest to the fact that their rejection has been based on their being white and male.  In fact, I also know of several Asian students who did get accepted had equal or lesser test scores and grades compared to the white males who did not get accepted.  Blacks and hispanics get accepted by default if they get decent scores and grades.</p>
<p>TJ&rsquo;s has a convoluted admissions process that uses Fairfax County school personnel (not TJ&rsquo;s staff) structured in &#8220;evaluation groups&#8221; that make the admissions decisions.  The student&rsquo;s racial / ethnic / gender status is clearly noted on every stage of the admissions process.  They have standing orders to factor in &#8220;diversity&#8221; and they can play any games they want to without repercussion.</p>
<p>Oh yes, Northern Virginia has a large population of highly educated white children so finding a highly qualified pool of applicants from among them is not a problem.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Out in Big Block hot-rod country&#8221;</p>
<p>Those who have big blocks, are big blockheads.  Those having small blocks, are small blockheads.  I have a small block, factory 350, in a &#8216;75 Chevy Monza.  I had the windshield replaced yesterday, by the mobile services of Safelite ($231 total).  The van had a picture of a good looking White serviceman&hellip;  the guy who actually did the work was named Jesus&hellip;oh christ&hellip;</p>
<p>I had purchased and installed some nylon clips, used to hold the reveal molding in place (the shiny metal surrounding the glass).<br>
Jesus just wiped out some of these clips, with the tool used to rip out the old rubber seal.  I asked if he had more, and he said &#8220;we&rsquo;ll use those (mine) in the bag&#8221;.  He was totally unfazed by the the fact that a customer had a bag of molding clips, as if it were an everyday occurence.</p>
<p>Then it came time to attach the antenna, which is a thin wire inside the top of the glass.  The plug was too big, so he spent about a half hour using a razor blade to remove rubber, to reduce diameter, so the male would fit in the female.  When he wasn&rsquo;t using the blades, he HELD THEM BETWEEN HIS TEETH!  He couldn&rsquo;t get it to work, so I told him he could go, and I would finish ( I did, using a knife, 5 minutes).  The windshield was left dirty, with markings from a black marking pen needing to be removed.  The contract states the glass is to be clean (all needed supplies were in the truck).</p>
<p>I asked him was this the first time (for a problem of this nature)- he said, &#8220;No, I&rsquo;ve been doing this since 1982.&#8221;  He seemed to &#8220;think&#8221; that I was asking if this was his first windshield job!</p>
<p>I find it very hard to believe that this was the very first time an antenna plug didn&rsquo;t fit.  These kinds of problems are to be noted, and worked out in advance.  Adapters are very common in electronics, to make one size fit a different size opening.</p>

			<p>I have never understood the concept that sitting next to somebody of another race will make me comprehend the subject better.<br>
 Will the test scores ofan all asian class go up if you bring five blacks and a hispanic?<br>
  PLEASE EXPLAIN</p>
