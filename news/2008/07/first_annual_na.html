						<p>Don&rsquo;t miss the First Annual National Black Women&rsquo;s Town Hall Meeting convening Friday, July 11 with Dr. Dorothy Height, a distinguished panel, and the Landmark of Greatness Awards presentation to Barbara McKinzie, International President, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. Special invited guest is Mrs. Michelle Obama. </p>
<p>This event will take place on Friday, July 11, 2008 from 6:00 pm to 9:00 pm at NCNW National Headquarters, 633 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20004.</p>
<p>For anyone that is unable to attend, NCNW is pleased to announce that this event will be aired on C-SPAN, Sunday, July 13, 2008 at 11:30 am. The broadcast will follow NGA Live and Newsmakers.</p>
<p>Please be sure to check your local listings! </p>
<p><b>Overview</b></p>
<p>In the coming weeks, NCNW will convene a historic meeting, the First Annual National Black Women&rsquo;s Town Hall Meeting. What began as a national radio discussion about race and gender has expanded into much more and you are part of this movement.</p>
<p>Our challenge has not been who will come to this event but how many. Because the nation&rsquo;s capitol is one of the most sought after locations for events, an appropriate and available venue was our biggest issue. We knew women from around the country would see the importance and urgency of this event and be present &#8220;</p>
<p><b>Get Involved</b></p>
<p>The spirit of a town hall means listening and learning together. Which brings us to the issue at hand. We have been working diligently to find a cost-effective and technologically driven solution to the hundreds of women who will be unable to physically present at the First Annual National Black Women&rsquo;s Town Hall Meeting. We think we have the answer.</p>
<p>In order to provide streaming video, where you can watch the Town Hall virtually online, we will need to set up a pay-per-view type scenario. In order to secure this service, we need at least 400 of you to pay $15 per-person in advance through a secure Paypal account by Monday, June 30. This is the only way to guarantee that this event will be broadcast live to you. Simply go to the below link and click on the &#8220;Donate&#8221; button and follow the instructions from there. If we do not reach our goal, your donation will be refunded, less a paypal processing fee. https://www.blanchewilliams.com/events.htm</p>
<p>ACT NOW! Don&rsquo;t delay! Get ready to participate in an interactive, online experience with live instant messaging components.</p>
<p>Commemorative DVD&rsquo;s will be available after the event.</p>

			<p>&#8220;What began as a national radio discussion about race and gender has expanded into much more and you are part of this movement.&#8221;</p>
<p>A &#8220;discussion about race and gender&#8221;, according to my P.C.-English dictionary is:<br>
&#8220;A one-sided argument whence white males will be blamed for all the ills of non-whites and/or women throughout the world&#8221;</p>

			<p>Send me a copy of the video.  Also, don&rsquo;t miss &#8220;Being black in America&#8221; on CNN.  And remember, it&rsquo;s brought to you by GEICO (just in case any of you have insurance with them, you might want to let them know you&rsquo;ll be switching companys)<br>

<p>No non-Christians, non-Whites, or women allowed. </p>

			<p>Can white women attend?  Hmmm-this sounds racist to me. </p>
<p>Can you imagine what that will be like- besides the head bobbing and nasty attitudes, the smell of cheap perfume and their shrieking voices&hellip; I wonder how many will try to slip in their entire extended family for the festivities.</p>

			<p>Bet they don&rsquo;t get the 400, not when they have to PAY through a paypal account that they don&rsquo;t have on a computer they don&rsquo;t own.</p>

<p>Good.  Now we need a National Hispanic Women&rsquo;s Town Hall Meeting, then one for Hmongs, one for Muslims, one for East Asians, then Southeast Asians, then Northern Asians, and Amerindians.</p>
<p>After that each entity can proceed to build standing armies to protect each group, and pursue its agenda of gaining control of the country, as the blacks and Hispanics have done with their gangs.</p>
<p>And justbefore the shooting starts, we can change the US motto to:  &#8220;Out of many, comes great agitation and war.&#8221;</p>

			<p>This type of race-exclusive meeting always becomes a victim whining-fest that blames Whitey for everything.</p>

			<p>&#8220;National Black Women&rsquo;s Town Hall Meeting &#8220;?</p>
<p>Yet if anyone called themselves a white group, it&rsquo;s branded by blacks as openly racist.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;Yet if anyone called themselves a white group, it&rsquo;s branded by blacks as openly racist.&#8221; -Cliff Yablonski</p>
<p>Complaining about this so-called &#8220;double standard,&#8221; as conservatives love to do, misses the point almost entirely.  These black women, just like the members of La Raza or even the SPLC, are out-and-out racists, so there actually is no double standard to speak of: it&rsquo;s totally consistent, in fact!  They flaunt their racism while at the same time using it as a weapon to intimidate and silence their enemies, both towards the same anti-white ends.</p>
<p>Those who call this strategy a double standard play naively assume that these types of people had ever once considered extending to the opposition an ounce of courtesy, respect, or fairness, or that their failure to do so is merely a forgetful oversight.  </p>
