						<p>Some Houston residents are upset after Korans were left on the doorsteps of hundreds of homes in their neighborhood as part of a campaign to educate people about Islam.</p>
<p>Residents of Braes Timbers in southwest Houston began finding the holy books two weeks ago, MyFOXHouston.com reported. The Korans came with a note saying they had been left by the Book of Signs Foundation, which claims to have distributed 30,000 free copies of the texts to residents throughout the city.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we went into a Muslim country and left a Bible, we would be in prison and then decapitated a few years later,&#8221; Sue Ann Pieri, a resident who chose not to destroy the book, as other neighbors did, told MyFOXHouston.com.</p>

			<p>Where I live the Bibles are often simply purged from many of the local libraries by the atheist and non-Christian religious practitioning bureaucrats that run them, but you sure can find the Koran and pretty much any other text for a major world religion as well as some cults. I keep hearing disturbing real incidents of how Christianity is persecuted and it&rsquo;s missionaries biased against not just in the US and Europe but worldwide. I find it disturbing.</p>
<p>Take the case in the UK of two Christian preachers stopped from handing out Bible extracts by police because they were in a Muslim area by a Muslim police community support officer who told them &#8216;You have been warned. If you come back here and get beat up, well, you have been warned.&rsquo; A police constable who was present during the incident in the Alum Rock area of Birmingham backed up the Muslim telling the preachers not to return to the district. </p>
<p>Interesting. Does this mean that Christians can have Christian police community support officers that forbid Muslims from prostelizing in their communities and the police will back us up? Or does it only go one way?</p>
<p>Whatever happend to Christian rights under the Human Rights Act or our own Constitution which guarantees freedom of religious expression?</p>

			<p>When we had some Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses leave some religious materials behind at our house when I was a teenager, my mother used them for kindling in the fireplace. Think about the many uses for a Koran you do not wish to read. They can be ripped apart and placed in litter boxes. They can be made into paper airplanes. Perhaps little girls could cut paper dolls out of them. Put your imagination to use and think of what practical uses the Koran has around your household. And don&rsquo;t be shy about thanking the Muslims. True, they&rsquo;ll be infuriated, but so what? You&rsquo;re using the &#8216;gift&rsquo; they left for you.</p>

			<p>Of course Christian evangelization, down to and including mere public display of Bibles or crosses, is illegal in the Islamic world. Why would anyone voluntarily join this anti-intellectual death cult? Apart from washed up folk singers, that is.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I have read that the albanian muslims are the wors[t] muslims on the planet. They drink alchohol,eat pork and are pretty monogamous and guess what. They are white&hellip;&#8221; - Tony Soprano</p>
<p>The Albanians who are Muslims, are the heirs of the Bogomil heresy, which afflicted Eastern Orthodoxy @1000A.D. It was theologically very similar to the current Dispensational error afflicting Evangelical Christendom in the USA today (the Falwell, Robertson, &#8220;Left Behind&#8221; mindset). The Bogomils saw very litte hope in a Christianity that (they thought) did not save, so they joined a militaristic, future-oriented (so they thought) religion that DID, i.e., Islam.</p>
<p>The similarities of the Bogomil&rsquo;s stance, to those who have today abandoned Trinitarian Christianity, for a chimera of seeing Divine &#8216;salvation&rsquo; in ANOTHER Near eastern subgroup (such as John Hagee- who already has denied Christ as Messiah, and who lauds WHICH group constantly?) is the reason that this Year, this election, this war is a RELIGIOUS war, whether you want it or not.</p>
<p>As the Bible says, &#8220;God is not mocked.&#8221;</p>
<p>And it is also why a U.S. Lawyer has noted that BHO has gone on record: &#8220;consider the following quote from Obama&rsquo;s first little book, Dreams of My Father:  </p>
<p>&#8220;I will stand with the Muslims should the political winds shift in an ugly direction.&#8221;  - http://www.conspiracypenpal.com/rants/barack.htm</p>

This whole business about &#8220;joining&#8221; a religion that you want to &#8220;hook up with&#8221; is hooey.  You either practice the beliefs or you don&rsquo;t.  If you don&rsquo;t, then don&rsquo;t call yourself a Christian, Muslim, or whatever.<br>

			<p>I&rsquo;m not bothered by this at all. These people are going to a fair amount of expense to give away what look to be very pricey and attractive editions of the Koran. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind getting one of them myself, especially for free. I got an expensive hardback copy of the Bhagavaghita from a wandering convert this way. He was just handing them out on the street.</p>
<p>These particular Muslims aren&rsquo;t bothering anybody. They&rsquo;re not banging on your door like Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses as far as I can tell. What&rsquo;s the big deal? What&rsquo;re you so worried about? Do you actually think that people are going to be converted against their will because somebody left a Koran on their doorstep? The ideas are out there. You can buy the Koran in any book store. This revulsion and fear towards a book reminds me of Voodoo. The way people are reacting, you&rsquo;d think they were Haitians who just found a bloody feather on their doorstep.</p>
<p>As for destroying the books, using them for toilet paper or target practice, I&rsquo;ve always thought that book burners were some of the lowest forms of life on the planet. I don&rsquo;t care what color you are or what the book is. Destroying books you don&rsquo;t like puts you on the same level as the Taliban as far as I&rsquo;m concerned.</p>

			<p>Corporately, some of our concerns are that we&rsquo;re worried about a double standard being practiced to our detriment and that becoming policy. We&rsquo;re worried about a modern liberal ideological assault on our values, heritage, culture, and entire civilization. </p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want to digress to the point of having to refight wars with pagans and muslims for territory that was already won and civilization that was already built. We&rsquo;re worried about moving backwards in the name of &#8220;progress&#8221; to the point where western civilization fractures yet again entering a balkanized dark age in which we have to rebuild western civilization from a fractured remanent. </p>
<p>We&rsquo;re worried that these things will occur if we don&rsquo;t reform our country and civilization. We&rsquo;re worried that we won&rsquo;t be able to move forward as a people and civilization in what amounts to a multicultural modern liberal facist regime.</p>
<p>Now would you like to hear about our personal concerns for ourselves, families, neighbors, and communities and why we we&rsquo;re worried about crime, drugs, public education, corruption, etc&hellip;? Because all the numbers are there.</p>
<p>Or maybe you simply are interested in why we would be concerned about this article. The Bible, a book you may or may not be familiar with, has a passage written by an ancient King named Solomon who was known for his wisdom, his wealth and his writings. He wrote, &#8220;Catch the foxes for us, The little foxes that are ruining the vineyards, while our vineyards are in blossom.&#8221; </p>
<p>While seemingly harmless, foxes dug holes and passages that loosened the soil around the vines, preventing them from developing a stable root system. Eventually a family of foxes, over a long time, can destroy the roots of the vines and ruin a vineyard.</p>
<p>Proverbial symbols of destroyers we must catch those foxes because if we don&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;ll destroy what we possess. </p>
<p>So 9:50AM on July 3, while it might not make a wit of difference to you whether or not western civilization, culture, and territories fall from the inside out instead of reforming and progressing to their fullest flowering: it surely matters to us. Yes we are concerned. </p>

			<p>9:50 AM: A book is just an object.  Destroying or discarding an unwanted book is no different than tossing out an empty milk carton.  If you doubt me, go by the library on the trash day after they hold a used book sale.  They toss all the unsold books in the dumpster when the patrons are gone.<br>
     And what is so bad about the Taliban, anyway?  They&rsquo;re brave defenders of their own culture, who chased the Russians out of Afghanistan.  If we&rsquo;d limited our Middle-Eastern involvement to buying oil, they&rsquo;d not even know we existed.  </p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always had a little bit of sympathy for the Taliban. How can I not? They are the first non-white group; the first third worlders, the first noble and wise creatures - the left hasn&rsquo;t gushingly fell in love with. Can you imagine the egg on their face?</p>
<p>Seriously, I&rsquo;ve always had a little bit of sympathy for them. I have no sympathy for their war or their fighting however.<br>

<p>Their aim is NOT to educate people about Islam, but to take over this country by force or sheer weight of numbers, and they&rsquo;d like to have as many converts as possible along the way.  These FACTS apply to the black and Hispanic populations as well.</p>
<p>This entire country is in the process of breaking apart along lines of race, ethnicity and religion, and there isn&rsquo;t a thing anyone can do about it now but slow down the process.</p>
<p>I think the entire white population really knows that.  That&rsquo;s why they always vote for the candidate who they believe will take us on the slowest road to hell.</p>

<p>You miss the point like so many. Of course nobody is going to be converted against their will. The point is that most of these people(muslims) are an alien group completely at odds with western democracy. Most of them come for economic reasons only and many seek to change our society. They start small, suing to have their muslim traditions accomadated in public schools, passing out the koran, attempting to make inroads into pushing islam in our society. However, don&rsquo;t kid yourself, if their numbers get sizeable, they&rsquo;d try to take over in a heartbeat. They belong in their own muslim countries, where they can live in accordance with islamic tradition, the do NOT belong here. Wake up please.</p>
<p>PS-I&rsquo;d rather have voodoo.</p>

<p>When I was in federal prison, I did one better.  I left fried pork rind crumbs all through a Koran I had read, so the next reader of this &#8220;book&#8221; would be handling pork.</p>
<p>Having read it, I would not even put out a burning Koran with urine.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact I have. The hugely wealthy state of Kuwait gave the Tsunami relief fund $50,000 U.S. back when it hit and the Kuwaitis made a HUGE deal of it in their Kuwait Times. These people have bank tellers in their banks with lines only for people who are dealing with 30,000 Kd or more and there is always a line. At the moment the Kuwaiti Kd (Dinar) is trading at $3.77 U.S.= 1 Kuwait Dinar. I know this because I was working in Kuwait at the time. The Kuwait Times always has a long list of DRUNKEN DRIVER arrests listed from the previous evening also.</p>

			<p>Probably a whitewash translation meant for ignorant infidels. Otherwise, as someone who has studied Islam and is horrified by it, I think it would be great if more people would take a look at the Koran (esp chapters 8 &amp; 9) and sense for themselves how intolerant and violent this religion of jihad is. Real translations are available at <br>

			<p>I am an avid science fiction reader.  For the benefit of 9:50 AM, I&rsquo;d like you all to read anything you like by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle, or David Drake.  Niven and Pournelle put a lot of development into alien species.  Drake is Vietnam vet, and about the best military science fiction author I&rsquo;ve ever read.  Then read anything by E.E. &#8220;Doc&#8221; Smith.</p>
<p>I once used an E.E. &#8220;Doc&#8221; Smith novel for target practice.  You would, too.</p>
