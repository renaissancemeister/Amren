						<p>Governor Paterson, who became New York&rsquo;s first black governor following the resignation of Eliot Spitzer, is lashing out at the press for describing him as an &#8220;accidental governor,&#8221; implying in a speech that the term&rsquo;s frequent usage was motivated by racial bias.</p>
<p>In a speech at the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People&rsquo;s annual convention in Cincinnati, Mr. Paterson also suggested that the defeat of Senator Obama by Senator McCain in the presidential contest would be a victory for racism.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Yesterday, [Mr. Paterson] let it be known that he no longer wants to be called accidental, saying the term has not been applied to white governors and presidents who took office under emergency circumstances.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am known as New York&rsquo;s accidental governor. I would like to point out a couple of facts: The two adjoining states to New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, have had three government changes in the last five years. None of those people were called the accidental governor,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody called Teddy Roosevelt an accidental president. Nobody called Truman an accidental president. And nobody called LBJ an accidental anything. So why was this non-illustrious title held all of these years for me? I will leave the answer to all of you and the Freudians in the audience because I haven&rsquo;t had the chance to think about it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For instance, Richard Codey, who filled in as governor of New Jersey for James McGreevey after the latter resigned in a sex scandal, was described as an &#8220;accidental governor&#8221; by the Philadelphia Inquirer, the New York Observer (in a story headlined &#8220;the Return of an Accidental Governor), the Washington Post, the Star-Ledger (in several articles), the Associated Press, and the New York Times.</p>
<p>President Johnson was the subject of a 1967 book by Robert Sherrill called &#8220;The Accidental President.&#8221; A 2001 book about President Bush and the 2000 election race by David Kaplan was titled, &#8220;The Accidental President: How 413 Lawyers, 9 Supreme Court Justices, and 5,963,110 Floridians (Give or Take a Few) Landed George W. Bush in the White House.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Can America reject the crucible of race that has dictated and pervaded all of our history to embrace an African-American man who has the right polices for the next decade in this country?&#8221; [Mr. Paterson] said.</p>

			<p>I think Patterson is trying to incite riots in New York City in the probable happenstance of Obama&rsquo;s defeat.  And feeding into the NAACP&rsquo;s line that &#8220;racism&#8221; still exists, meaning the NAACP still needs your generous contribution.</p>

			<p>&#8220;New York governor doesn&rsquo;t know history, calls others racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s blind, not deaf. Being in line to take the position of governor, no excuse will suffice.</p>
<p>(The article didn&rsquo;t really support this statement in the title of the article. The media, round-and-round it goes.)</p>

			<p>You ain&rsquo;t seen nothin yet from this guy. He&rsquo;s a sub-par jerk who nobody ever thought would get in, they thought that he was on the shelf forever, but things just didn&rsquo;t turn out that way. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, they can call him anything they want, but nobody will ever use the word competent when referring to him.</p>

<p>Well, people of New York, here&rsquo;s what you get when you vote for a black in any position:  A race baiter that is unequivocally calling for action against racism if the black nationalist loses the election.</p>
<p>I wish the black politicians and the black retards on the T.V. news shows would realize that there are literally tens of MILLIONS of white people in this country who are not intimidated by black threats of war, as the corporate geeks and spineless politicians are.  In fact, most welcome it as a chance to right all the recent injustices.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m glad the not so veiled black threats keep coming, because &#8220;Worse is better,&#8221; and with enough of it we will get even more whites more aware of the deteriorating situation.</p>

			<p>Whining about racism if a black doesn&rsquo;t get elected pres in front of a black organization that is blatantly anti-white, has got to be solid proof of black arrogance moving into a higher gear.  It&rsquo;s truly disgusting and none of us should put up with it any longer.  It&rsquo;s time to act and act NOW!</p>
<p>If McCain were to say something similar to the Council of Conservative Citizens, imagine what kind of hysteria that would cause.</p>
<p>Blacks are unable to see it because of their stupidity, but putting this black up as a candidate has revealed more black racism in this country than what could have been gotten from one of Jesse Peterson&rsquo;s books being read on national t.v. every evening for a year.</p>
<p>This situation could just backfire very badly for blacks, and if it does it&rsquo;s what they deserve because they&rsquo;re acting just exactly as if they had just conquered us and are waiting to celebrate our demise.</p>

			<p>Honestly as a New Yorkers, I had completely forgotten about this guy.  After his bizarre sex life scandal died down he has essentially been forgotten. </p>
<p>Much like Jesse Jackson, he throwing a temper tantrum at the media to fawn over him again, like a how a dejected two year old acts when his mommy has another baby (obama) that takes away mommy&rsquo;s love and attention.</p>

<p>Get over it, Paterson. Gerald Ford would have loved to have been called &#8220;accidental&#8221; rather than all of the other nasty names he was called. You&rsquo;re not so unique just &#8216;cause you&rsquo;re black.</p>

<p>Great post, as usual Robert.</p>
<p>I am in my 40&rsquo;s and grew up in a mixed neighborhood - though the town was not mixed - and a mixed classroom from 1st to 12th Grade.  After High School I lived in three major Cities in the USA.</p>
<p>I never ONCE saw a White person attack a Black person, but I have seen the opposite.  In fact from childhood to young adulthood not one year went by when I didn&rsquo;t see, or hear about, or, in some cases was involved with Black on White violence.<br>
The Powers that be KNOW this and will do whatever they can to stop us.  But, after all I&rsquo;ve been through, I&rsquo;m not afraid at all.  I would welcome a confrontation on a large scale.  <br>
I am not intimidated by the name-calling.  I have nothing but contempt for your average Middle Class White Liberal or Conservative Doormat and People-Pleaser. Their masks have been stripped and they stand exposed. They are morally bankrupt and intellectually shallow, at best.  </p>

<p>An assassin&rsquo;s bullet ended the life of William McKinley in 1901, making his vice president, Theodore Roosevelt, an &#8220;accidental&#8221; president at the age of 42<br>
https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/presidents/26_t_roosevelt/tguide/index.html</p>
<p>Nobody called Truman an accidental president.</p>
<p>THE MAKING OF A NATION - July 25, 2002: Harry Truman&rsquo;s Second Term <br>
Before the election of nineteen-forty-eight, Harry Truman sometimes was called an &#8220;accidental&#8221; president. That meant the citizens had not elected him to lead the nation. <br>
https://www.manythings.org/voa/02/020725mn_t.htm</p>
<p>And nobody called LBJ an accidental anything.</p>
<p>Sherrill has authored numerous books on politics including his biography of Lyndon Johnson, &#8220;The Accidental President&#8221;<br>

<p>At least Obama is articulate.  Patterson is not.  I think he&rsquo;s trying to say that (white) America should forget about race while, at the same time, hack politicians like Patterson are taking a bath in it.</p>

<p>This guy is too dumb to be governor!  He is basically saying that if you do not vote for Obama you are a RACIST.</p>
<p>However, the NYT picked up this theme in a recent article.  It was shown in a poll that only 30% of whites supported Obama while black support was close to 100%.  So, this brillant person, maybe Jayson Blair,  from the NYT, concluded that whites were not supporting Obama because they were racists. <br>

<p>Ever heard of a convention being held for White Democrats or Republicans?  Know any businesses called &#8220;Your White Christian Bakery&#8221;?  The White Caucus?  The White Chamber of Commerce?  Blacks can vote carte blanche for Obama but we&rsquo;re not allowed to vote for own interests.  Who is it that really needs to get over race?  </p>
<p>The right policies?  What little substance is in his campaign is alot of flip flopping on Iraq troop withdrawals depending on the day of the week.  One thing that is solid is that industrious upper income people like myself will be taxed to death to pay for alien invaders and shiftless prehistorics.  Sorry, I&rsquo;m not fooled into believing the ridiculous idea that a black theologist is the hope of America and the White race.  The whole thing reads like some wierd Charlton Heston scifi movie.  Well, I&rsquo;ve got news for you, Obama is no Roddy McDowall and Michelle is no Kim Hunter. <br>

<p>It&rsquo;s been said on here before and more eloquently than I can say it but spoken words by whites are taken more seriously than assaults by the chosen ones. Sometimes when the white person has even been killed the surviving family members are the ones claiming they, or the deceased, aren&rsquo;t racists. <br>

			<p>&#8220;A spokesman for the Obama campaign&hellip;(said)&hellip;voters would make their decision based on &#8216;Senator Obama&rsquo;s vision for uniting our country&hellip;&rsquo;&#8221; (from original article).</p>
<p>At the Ashby flea market (about 90% black) here in Berkeley today, there were stacks of new T-shirts for sale with Obama&rsquo;s picture on them, and the ones that had lettering didn&rsquo;t say, &#8220;he&rsquo;ll unite our country.&#8221; They said, &#8220;The first black president.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Nice to see that someone else posting on AmRen lives in my area (H. Dumpty)!  I live 2 blocks away from the Ashby Flea Market in Berkeley.  Hello friend, I feel less alone in this island of stifling political correctness and firey zeal to conceal the truth about racial issues. By the way I don&rsquo;t even go to the Ashby Flea market because it has such a sleazy feel: it has long had a reputation as a place where stolen goods are sold.  Whether this has to do with its being 90% black or its being in a liberal city that codependently supports its black criminals as the suffering victims of endemic, systemic, institutionalized racism, is not clear.   The last time I went to the flea market was to pursue two black people who had just come through my block with a shopping cart, brazenly cutting people&rsquo;s flowers from their front yards, and going to sell these stolen clippings at the flea market.   I&rsquo;m sure many in Berkeley would have lauded them as inventive entrepreneurs.  <br>
It is so tiring how Paterson and others play the Race Card at the slightest opportunity.  I think of Richard Thompson Ford&rsquo;s excellent book, The Race Card: How Bluffing about Bias Makes Race Relations Worse, which I recommend to you all. <br>
As someone trained as a psychotherapist, it is also galling to me, to observe the dishonesty with which their own self-hatred or low self-worth is projected outwards by black persons, onto white persons or a white system.  If we have a pervasive problem with anti-black racism in our nation, the problem lies primarily within black people, who engage in the most destructive and self-denigrating of behaviors while simultaneously blaming white persons or fictitious oppressive white structures for their own self-hatred.  </p>

Thank God that Caucasians have organized and are beginning to march against our oppressors both black and white. It is our duty to God to do so.  White man - spit in the faces of our oppressors and give them all beautiful Italian salutes.</p>

<p>Mitch:  Thanks for pointing that out.

<p>Robert Kelly:  Thank you also!  I had been wondering if I was imagining the subtle &#8220;Bring it on&#8221; response from middle America to the Duke rape-hoax, the Jena 6 fiasco, Noose-a-rama and other recent black temper-tantrums.  For the last few years, I&rsquo;ve noticed more and more white anger over racial injustices to our people.  I think the MSM has overlooked it completely.  </p>
<p>When whites are finally pushed too far, it will be a nightmare for militant blacks!  We&rsquo;re smarter, better educated, better armed and our racial history shows that we organize quickly and efficiently when required.  </p>

			<p>After watching a brief excerpt of the view wherein Whoopie Goldberg uttered some nonsensical tripe that the &#8220;n&#8221; word belongs only to blacks, and that other disgusting female black who screamed she could say the &#8220;n&#8221; word but, &#8220;I don&rsquo;t want to hear it come out of your mouth,&#8221; I suddenly realized that these retards truly believe that a black for president means to them that they have won the country.  They believe their perverted policies will dominate and rule.</p>
<p>I agree with the above posters.  The couch potatoes are getting an earful and an eyeful of how disgusting these people really are.  And I wonder how many of the liberal audience on The View  might be looking at blacks as threats rather than victims.  Even liberals use their brains sometimes, when they&rsquo;re not prancing around hugging everybody on death row.</p>

<p>Using the N-word to describe themselves is one of the few things so many of them have gotten right. Let&rsquo;s not begrudge them this one little achievement, that they want to hold so close to their own bosoms and cherish as their own. Let&rsquo;s see how long it takes before they claim they invented the word.</p>

<p>How nice to hear that someone holding similar ideas lives so close! Please feel very welcome to drop me an email if you feel like it.</p>
<p>Berkeley is absolutely mute on race. Occasionally I read the Berkeley Daily Planet, always full of ongoing discussion of matters of great moment (whether or not the University must supply water and food to the tree sitters trespassing on their property), and occasionally there is a letter to the editor expressing stunned surprise that violent crime has actually touched the writer or the writer&rsquo;s children, and the writer asks in bewilderment why nothing is done? </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve sometimes replied with a short letter saying that Berkeleyans refuse to think about crime because it might lead them to thoughts about race, and that the writer can be very sure that the criminal outrage to their persons they have just described will provoke absolutely no response from anyone except for my own short letter.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t been wrong yet! </p>
<p>But the fear on Berkeleyans&rsquo; faces when my footsteps (I walk a lot) surprise them as they are exiting their cars at night tells me they know at some level that crime is a problem here. And as far as I can tell, almost all the street crime, violent crime, here is committed by blacks, and beginning just recently, by some Hispanics.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me started.</p>

			<p> &#8220;I live 2 blocks away from the Ashby Flea Market in Berkeley. Hello friend, I feel less alone in this island of stifling political correctness <b>and firey zeal to conceal the truth&#8221;  </b><br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  <br>
Zeal to conceal the truth!  Isn&rsquo;t it amazing that something like this could be written about a university town?  Absolutely appalling.</p>
<p>PS. Out of curiosity, I googled Ashby Flea Market.  I find that it is located on Martin Luther King Way.   Oh, oh!    Does that tell me everything I need to know? </p>

Isn&rsquo;t it amazing that something like this could be written about a university town? Absolutely appalling.&#8221;<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  <br>
On re-reading the above today, it occurs to me that my comment could be misconstrued. Let me make it clear that I am not criticizing the writer, but the TOWN.</p>
<p>Concealing the truth!   Isn&rsquo;t <i>discovering the truth</i> what a university is supposedc to be all about?  Have we lost our way this badly?</p>
<p>How diseased and corrupted has our academic system become when political correctness takes precedence over truth finding? </p>
