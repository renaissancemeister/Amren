<h1><a href="https://www.eurweb.com/story/eur44959.cfm">The Debt: What America Owes Blacks</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>William Reed, EURWeb (Los Angeles), July 3, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Segments of Americans are gearing up to oppose Senator Barack Obama because they fear he will be more considerate of the debt America owes to Blacks.</p>
<p>Anti-Obama whites, in particular, are concerned he&rsquo;ll get into the White House and put Blacks on track for &#8220;a reparations gravy train.&#8221;</p>
<p>CNN debate moderator Anderson Cooper put Black Reparations on track to be a part of the presidential dialogue during the South Carolina Primaries.</p>
<p>The African-American vote in South Carolina was very important, and that made the reparations question relevant in the Democratic Debate. At that event former Senator John Edwards said &#8221; I&rsquo;m not for reparations .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but I think there are other things we can do to create some equality that doesn&rsquo;t exist in this country today&#8221; he said, going on to talk about inequities African Americans experienced paying mortgages in Charleston, S.C., where the debate was held.</p>
<p>When Cooper asked Sen. Barack Obama about reparations he sidestepped a yes or no answer instead preferring to redefine reparations to make it part of a broader conversation about economic justice. &#8220;I think the reparations we need right here in South Carolina is investment, for example, in schools.&#8221; Obama said.</p>
<p>To corner Obama and nail all the candidates down, Cooper asked for a show of hands and questioned: &#8220;Is anyone on the stage for reparations for slavery for African-Americans?&#8221; The only &#8220;yes&#8221; came from Congressman Dennis Kucinich who said: &#8220;The Bible says we shall be and must be repairers of the breach. And a breach has occurred. We have to acknowledge that. It&rsquo;s a breach that has resulted in inequality in opportunities for education, for health care, for housing, for employment.&#8221;</p>
<p>From then on, reparations have been an issue in the campaign. America owes Blacks $700 billion to $1.9 trillion for unpaid labor that built the country&rsquo;s infrastructure, including the U.S. Capitol. While Obama dodges the issue, his &#8220;old church, Trinity United Church of Christ, lists &#8220;The Debt: What America Owes To Blacks, by Randall Robinson (Penguin Putman Inc., 2000) as recommended reading&#8221;. In The Debt, Robinson argues that America still owes an enormous debt to Africans and African Americans for the incalculable damage that backs have suffered and continue to suffer as a result of two hundred and fifty years of slavery and segregation.</p>
<p>Barack&rsquo;s birthright brothers many whites; but Wautella Graham of the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America (N&rsquo;COBRA) breaks the question of slavery into four categories of involvement: victims, collaborators, perpetrators and beneficiaries and makes the point that, &#8220;Even immigrants and people whose ancestral line contains no slaveholders should pay reparations, since every American benefits from slavery.&#8221;</p>
<p>Slavery victimizes free blacks to this day. All American people are responsible for the debt America owes.&#8221;<br>
