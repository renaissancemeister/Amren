<p>Citing alarming rates of childhood obesity and a lack of healthful eating choices, a city councilwoman is pushing for a moratorium on new fast-food restaurants in South-Central Los Angeles. Jan Perry, a Democrat who represents the city&rsquo;s overwhelmingly African-American and Latino District 9, is supported by nutritionists, frustrated residents and community activists who call restrictive zoning an appropriate response to &#8220;food apartheid.&#8221; &#8220;You try to get a salad within 20 minutes of our location; it&rsquo;s virtually impossible,&#8221; said Marqueece Harris-Dawson, executive director of the Community Coalition.</p>

			<p>Memo to Marqueece:</p>
<p><br>
One way to remedy the situation is to open up your own salad bar.<br>
Why must you wait for someone else to open up a salad bar in your neighborhood? Get together with your buddies, pool your resources, and voila!!! Black owned salad restaurant in Black neighborhood!! you dont need white people to tell you what to eat, when to eat it, or how to eat it.</p>

			<p>That district was once solidly black.  It is now about 85 percent hispanic and 15 black.  The obese kids are the mexicans.</p>
<p>They are fat because throughout American history when poor working class immigrants come to America they have good nutrition for the first time in generations and the children and grandchildren grow up much larger than the immigrant grandparents.  I know a Japanese family.  The immigrant great grandmother is actually shorter that the 3rd generation great grandchild due to the difference between poor working class nutrition in Japan in the 1920&rsquo;s and the good nutrition availble to Americans.</p>
<p>And all those idiot liberal intellectuals who came up with the free school breakfast, lunch, after school snack, WIC coupons and food stamps have created a generation of little butterballs.</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t it just 10 years ago that liberal organizations were going on and on about 100,000 American children go to bed hungry every night?  And now they are going on and on about childhood obesity.  There are billboards all over Los Angeles showing butterball hispanics kids and slogans such as feed your kid fresh fruit and vegetables instead of McDonalds.</p>
<p>But the typical hispanic diet is heavy on rice, beans, tortillas,plantains, cornmeal and other fattening carbs.  Beans are very nutritious, full of protein, vitamins and minerals, but a cup of cooked beans is about 900 calories.  So a cup of beans at lunch and dinner is 1800 calories just for the beans alone.</p>
<p>Jan Perry and the rest of the disgusting city council critters and county supervisors get enormous contributions from the trial lawyers groups.  So all Ms Perry is doing is Public relations work for the trial lawyers.  Next time McDonald&rsquo;s is hit with one of those &#8220;McDonald&rsquo;s made me obese&#8221; lawsuits, all Ms Perry&rsquo;s PR about the evils of McDonalds will have created and impression in the entire jury pools mind that yes indeed, McDonalds, not rice beans and tortilla&rsquo;s are responsible for hispanic obesity.</p>
<p>Then too, most of the hispanic immigrants are not european, not mixed but pure indian.  And the typical Latin American indian is built like a bowling ball.</p>

			<p>Too funny.  When the fast food establishments are gone, there will be activists screaming that there are no fast food establishments in the black neighborhood because of racism.  </p>
<p>Will the cloying paternalism toward minorities ever end?  &#8220;They&#8221; just can&rsquo;t take care of themselves, I guess.</p>

			<p>Actually they are right. Now a hundred years ago when Southcentral Los Angeles was all white, you could buy all the vegetables you wanted at the weekly farmer&rsquo;s market or the local grocery store. Of course, now that it&rsquo;s just a huge concrete jungle and a lot of the chain stores didn&rsquo;t rebuild after the last riots there (can you blame them?), there really are NOT many places to buy healthy food out there.</p>

			<p>Just amother excuse to cry racism, and blame their obesity and on whites. It would be cheaper to buy a head of lettuce and the fixings at the grocery store, than to pick a salad up everyday at some fastfood place. But who is fooling who? They aren&rsquo;t obese because of the lack of availabiliy of salad, it&rsquo;s there if they wan&rsquo;t it. They want the junky, greasy, fatty, foods, and several helpings full at that. They have supersized themselves.</p>

			<p>Fast food is highly nutritious.  The number-one daily need for humans is protein.  Check.</p>
<p>We need calories (though in the near term most of us   &mdash;   white or black   &mdash;   have ample fat reserves).  Check.</p>
<p>Third, we need fat.  Check.</p>
<p>We also need calcium and salt.  Check</p>
<p>And water.  Check.</p>
<p>All are available at fast-food joints in abundance.  Yes, we need vitamins and minerals, and it&rsquo;s a good idea to mix in raspberries and cauliflower and cabbage and plums, but you&rsquo;ll live much longer on Big Macs than on broccoli.</p>

			<p>Every fast food restaurant has a &#8220;light&#8221; menu or a &#8220;Low fat&#8221; menu.  McDonalds has salads (which are pretty good I should say), Wendys has healthy items, and so does Jack in the box.</p>

			<p>If they&rsquo;re not complaining that Angel food cake is white and trying to rename the black holes in space because the universe is insensitive to blacks, they&rsquo;re wanting to spend their time and energy creating a food placement police.</p>
<p>With all these worthwhile considerations on their minds constantly, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine that black run countries and cities have all failed miserably, especially Atlanta and Detroit. </p>

			<p>Marqueece must truly be an elite that does not eat fast food.  All national fast food chains offer salads, and other healthy choices.  Maybe all these fast food joints are locally owned fried chicken and taco joints.  I am sure veggies are scarce there, except for salmonella salsa.</p>

			<p>McDonalds has actually been promoting their salads and wraps pretty heavily these last few years due to all the heat they are catching for their super artery clogging burgers. </p>
<p>The catch of course is that these &#8220;salads&#8221; are generally well tailored to fit the tastes of their customer base  &mdash;  enormous hulking creatures on the verge of death from diabetes  &mdash;  and they thus fill them with fried chicken and creamy fatty dressings and cheeses making them in fact even more unhealthy than their bugers. </p>
<p>It is like when my hometown of NYC did away with Soda in schools but replaced it with snapple which actually has even more sugar.  A 300 calorie &#8220;tea&#8221; or a 700 calorie &#8220;salad&#8221; makes you feel like you are &#8220;eating healthy&#8221; and lets you feel good about yourself which is all that matters anyway.<br>

<p>Haven&rsquo;t you ever heard of &#8220;Poke Salad&#8221; as in &#8220;Poke Salad Annie?&#8221;  But it was a shame because her mamma was working on a chain gang.</p>
<p>That is how serious I take this issue.  They like sugar, fat and television.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m not buying the idea that fast food is inherently fattening.  The fat and salt content depends on what fast food one is talking about.  The first job I was able to get after my release from federal prison was at Subway; I took it just to keep my P.O. happy, and not p.o&rsquo;d.  I got a free meal each shift I worked, so I ate Subway sandwiches five or six days a week for most of a year.  I didn&rsquo;t gain any weight.  My favorites were the chicken pizzaiola (chicken, pepperoni and marinara sauce) and chicken-bacon-swiss melt, loaded with vegetables in each case.  We had pastrami in the store, too, so sometimes I would bring Thousand Island dressing and sauerkraut from home and make myself a Reuben.  I brought unsweetened iced tea from home to drink.</p>
<p>What I was conspicuosly not doing was eating MacDonald&rsquo;s Big Macs, in which the beef is fried, the buns are sweetened with sugar to make them more appealing to kids, and chasing them with French fries deep-fried in more beef tallow and a large sugary soft drink.  In fact, the reason I applied at Subway in the first place is because when I walked into the store, I could tell by the smells present that they were not frying anything.</p>
<p>Eating fast food is a collection of choices.  One can chose which restaurant one goes to, and once one is inside, one gets to chose what to order.  In fact, one also gets to chose whether to eat lunch out at all during the workweek.  My wife does not.  She makes salads at home and brings them to work in Tupperware, usually with a packet of instant miso soup.  Alternately, she makes a sandwich in pita bread and takes that, in both cases with iced tea I brew at home.</p>
<p>If in fact &#8220;nobody sells a salad&#8221; in that area, I suspect it is the result of restaurant owners tailoring their selections to what customers are willing to buy.  With an eye on the bottom line, no franchise owner really wants to write off a lot of wilted lettuce and spoiled tomatoes every week.  That said, is there something actively preventing the residents from *making their own salads*?  Even if you&rsquo;re in a hurry, it&rsquo;s not complicated.  Grab some &#8220;garden salad&#8221; mix out of a bag in the refrigerator.  Supermarkets sell a variety of these.  Throw it in Tupperware, along with some tomato, onion, cucumber slices, almond accents and sunflower seeds or croutons, and the dressing of your choice.  This might take two or three whole minutes out of someone&rsquo;s busy day, either the previous evening, or in the morning before work, and it costs a lot less than going out to eat.</p>

			<p>The 9th District of Los Angeles is in the 90037 zip code.  I used this zip code, and did a 5 mile search for McDonalds, there are 25, Burger King, there are 20 and Wendys, there are 10.  I would think even in LA, Mr. Marqueece Harris-Dawson and Ms. Jan Perry could go 5 miles in 20 minutes and get themselves a salad.  Its always amazing to me how blacks cry about how racial government is, but they are constantly inviting it into their lives.</p>

			<p>&hellip;American children going to bed hungry every night</p>
<p>I had always wondered where these hungry children statistics came from.  I found out from Thomas Sowell&rsquo;s  &#8220;Vision of the Annointed &#8220;.   If you qualify for food stamps but you don&rsquo;t get food stamps, then your children are going to bed hungry and they are statistics.</p>
<p>Someone needs to teach Marqueece how to make a salad.  It must be the legacy of slavery and institutional racism that she lacks this ability.</p>

			<p>AJ has hit the nail exactly on the head: businesses go where the money is, and when the customer base is not present, they stay away.  The area is probably full of hamburger and fried chicken and Mexican eateries.  The most vegetable-intensive traditional Mexican dish I can think of offhand is guacamole and chips.  No animal-products, not even cheese.  I make guacamole quite often at home; cut an avacado in half, pull out the seed, and scoop out what is inside the rind.  Mash that up with some tobasco or salsa and a little lemon juice (which keeps it from turning brown).  Enjoy.  The problem is that the chips are fried, and avocados are full of oils, which means fats, which means calories.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is that people are programmed by evolution to like eating, since we spent most of our evolution at a near-starvation level.  With the rise of civilization, the rich were the first fat people; early organization allowed the production of a genuine surplus, and the rich and powerful were able to monopolize that surplus.</p>
<p>In much of the developed West, food is now quite cheap, and so does not form a very high percentage of the typical family budget.  It is now the uneducated who overeat, and eat greasy, salty food in abundance because it tastes good.  &#8220;Convenience&#8221; foods seem particularly popular in America, for reasons that are unclear to me, except perhaps for the grease and salt content.  I am reminded of a Time Magazine article about what we eat a few years ago, that showed pictures of a German family, a Japanese family, and a (black) American family, each posing with a one-week supply of groceries they had purchased.  Each family was a married couple with two kids of approximately high-school age, as I recall.  The German family had some beer, and a very nice-looking selection of grain products, meat, vegetables and lots of fresh fruits.  The Japanese family had some beautiful pieces of fresh fish that had me salivating just seeing the picture, rice, noodles, more vegetables and less fruit, and some less-identifiable things.  The black US family had bought a great, big pile of bottled soda and convenience foods, and I just winced.</p>
<p>Even without thinking about which wage-earners are likely to take a public transportation to near their offices and then walk the rest of the way there, and who is likely to drive to work, it was painfully obvious who was inviting major health problems and who was not.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t really about fast-food unfairly targetting black and Hispanic areas.  This is about people&rsquo;s eating habits, even - or perhaps especially - at home.</p>

			<p>I do remember reading online that black women were by far the heaviest women in this country, followed by Hispanic women. Just reading the response was fascinating, since black women were logging on in droves, calling the study racist, and insisting they were lies. A few even went so far as to say that when black women put on wieght they were simply curvy and thick, while white women just became plain old fat. And that BMI&rsquo;s just didn&rsquo;t apply to them. For all their hypersensitivity, they probably really do believe this to be the case. I also will never forget reading how white women usually admitted to feeling self-conscious about being moderately overweight, while black women who were significantly over-weight and even obese, usually said they thought they were a healthy weight. Most blacks do like to see themselves through rose colored glasses, and anyone who challanges them on such issues, will instantly be deemed racist. The black community has monster sized egos.</p>

<p>Their egos are actually pretty fragile about some things.  The silence is deafening on this board when there&rsquo;s a story about black IQ, but start talking about nappy hair, flaired nostrils and wide loads, they come out of the woodwork in droves.  You wouldn&rsquo;t know it from their fifth grade posts, but they say they&rsquo;re all graduates of prestigious Ivy League schools, have light skin, married to White men and have children.  Talk about shattered self-esteem.   </p>
