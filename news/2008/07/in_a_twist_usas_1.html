						<p>Dozens of workers line up for a buffet catered by Satay Malaysian Grille, a popular Chinatown eatery here. They carry plates piled high with Asian delicacies to nine rows of long tables facing a dais.</p>
<p>By the time the employees savor mango-sticky-rice treats, their luncheon speakers are introduced: a local TV reporter, a former school administrator, a bank founder, a magazine publisher, a chamber of commerce executive, a local politician.</p>
<p>Only one is Anglo. The rest: Chinese, Japanese, Thai &mdash; all Asian Americans.</p>
<p>This event isn&rsquo;t in Las Vegas&rsquo; Chinatown district but in a meeting room at one of the pillars of the local business establishment: Nevada Power. The lunch, held so the utility&rsquo;s employees could hear voices from the Asian-American community, is a reflection of the explosive growth and rising clout of Asian Americans in Nevada and other inland Western states. They&rsquo;ve become a powerful voting bloc that&rsquo;s being wooed by presidential candidates &mdash; and an economic force that businesses are catering to.</p>
<p>This decade, the Asian population has grown at a faster rate than that of the Hispanic population in 14 states &mdash; including Nevada, Arizona and Texas &mdash; as well as Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>In a surprising twist to historical settlement patterns, growing numbers of Asian Americans are beginning to bail from the places that have long been their main gateways to the West: California and Washington. Wearied by the same crushing home prices, poor schools, jammed freeways and persistent crime that have sent millions of other Californians packing, Asian Americans are moving to spots in the West they hope will produce better lifestyles &mdash; namely Las Vegas and Phoenix.</p>
<p>The Asian migration is fueling ethnic diversity in places that have been overwhelmingly white. Since 1990, Nevada has had the most rapid growth of any state in the number of Asians and Pacific Islanders.</p>
<p>The number jumped 174% in the 1990s and 67% so far this decade to about 211,000, according to 2007 Census Bureau estimates. Asians now make up about 8.2% of Nevada&rsquo;s 2.6 million people &mdash; a higher percentage than the national share of 5.4%. Most live here in Clark County, where Asians are the fastest-growing minority.</p>
<p>Arizona also is registering significant growth among Asians, a trend fueled largely by an exodus from California and Washington. They&rsquo;re leaving for lower cost of living, warm climates and better job markets, a reflection of the migration patterns that have made Nevada and Arizona the nation&rsquo;s fastest-growing states throughout much of the past two decades.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why First Asian Bank&rsquo;s two branches cater to all Asian groups. The number &#8220;8,&#8221; a symbol of prosperity, is the first number of the bank&rsquo;s branch numbers and all its customers&rsquo; account numbers (the Beijing Olympics start on 8/8/08 for the same reason). Two Texas companies have since opened banks in Las Vegas to target the Asian market.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Real estate agents have organized &#8220;fly-and-buys&#8221; for Californians, offering them three days and two nights in Vegas to play and check out properties.</p>
<p>o The first national glossy magazine to target all Asian ethnicities is scheduled to be launched from Vegas in September. The monthly AsianAm will sell for $4.50, aim for an initial circulation of 700,000 and try to capture the attention of Asians ages 18 to 34, says Bessy Lee-Oh, CEO and publisher.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Most hotels and casinos are careful not to offend Asian sensibilities. Fifteen years ago, when the MGM Grand HotelsCasino opened, guests had to enter through what appeared to be the mouth of a lion, the company&rsquo;s corporate logo. Many Asian patrons were not amused. They considered walking into the mouth of a beast bad luck and avoided the casino. MGM spent millions redesigning the entrance.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Filipinos are the largest Asian group here, at about 45%. Chinese are the next at 15%, Japanese and Koreans make up 9% each, Asian Indians and Vietnamese represent about 5% each, and other Asians make up 12%.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>California generates more Asian migrants than other states, but they&rsquo;re coming from elsewhere, too.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Las Vegas is luring Asians young and old, professional and service workers, native-born Americans and immigrants.</p>

			<p>These people will demand &#8220;fair play&#8221; from us, and consistently favor their racial brethren when we&rsquo;re not looking.  That&rsquo;s how they get rich.  That&rsquo;s why ethnic Chinese own the Phillipines, and dominate much of the rest of east Asia.

			<p>Asian is too broad a category. It includes people from very different cultures. Some of those cultures live in harmony with us, while others don&rsquo;t know how to.</p>

			<p>&#8216;overwhelmingly white&rsquo;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s that phrase again. Keep and eye out for it. You never see any other racial population paired with that term. I guess peaceful prosperous communities of whites is &#8216;overwhelming&rsquo; to journalists of color for whom such communities just don&rsquo;t compute. </p>

			<p>I like how the &#8220;reporter&#8221; of this piece says that only one of the employees of an Asian restaurant was &#8220;Anglo.&#8221; First, we&rsquo;re not Anglo, we&rsquo;re White, and secondly he reports it as if it is a surprise. Asians, like all other identity groups - with the exception of Whites) - always discriminate in favour of there own.</p>
<p>Asians are out-pacing Hispanics here in New England as well. We live in the Boston area and went up to Lake Champlain for the weekend. More than 95% of the people we saw were White. But the over-whelming majority of non-Whites were Asians. Particularly (judging from the names of their restaurants) Thai and/or Vietnamese.</p>
<p>By-the-by, our trip was part vacation and part scouting trip. We were trying to see if the area would be a good place to start a White Nationalist community. It absolutely would. Vermont has a population of roughly 600,000 residents. If 50,000 WNs moved into the state (particularly if they localized in one area) we could &#8220;transform&#8221; (to use my favourite Newspeak word) it. We could elect a WN governor, 2 WN senators, and a WN representative. What do y&rsquo;all think?</p>

			<p>Well put.  Just look at their shining example in California.<br>

			<p>Sooner or later Asians will dominate the United States Of America&hellip;.USA will be known not as United States Of America but United States Of Asia&hellip;. Whites don&rsquo;t have to hate others but they certainly deserve a homeland of their own, much like other people. You would want to have a family and your love ones surrounded by your own people, dont you.</p>

			<p>Having lived in Vermont in the recent past I can tell Russ that politically the place is a hotbed of marxists masquerading as Democrats. Whether a White Nationalist community would even be allowed to exist there is a real question. Essentially, virulent leftists from NYC and Boston have been colonizing Vermont since the &rsquo;60s and stop at nothing to make life very very difficult for any individual or communal group that dares  oppose their agenda.</p>

<p>Hello ricpic,</p>
<p>I agree wholeheartedly with the above. Vermont, along with California, New York, and Massachusetts are generally considered the most &#8220;liberal&#8221; states in the union.</p>
<p>While there is no doubt that the political institutions of VT. are dominated by Marxists, I think it is equally true that they constitute a tiny fraction of the population. They dominate the politics because they work hard at it and because most people are followers and just follow along.</p>
<p>Having been born and raised in New England, I feel like I have a fairly intuitive understanding of the people here. The overwhelming majority of the people in northern New England aren&rsquo;t liberal but rather libertarian. The Marxists understand this and manipulate this fact.</p>
<p>I believe a small but dedicated group of WNs could easily reverse the gains the Marxists have made in the state. And in a very short period hold the kind of influence that the Marxists currently enjoy.</p>
