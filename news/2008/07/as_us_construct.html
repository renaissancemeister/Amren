						<p>{snip} From 2000 to 2006, the amount of remittances grew significantly year after year, helping to support workers&rsquo; families abroad. That growth leveled off in 2007, and now it has actually begun to decline: January through May of 2008 has seen a decline of $668.28 million compared to the same period in 2007. In May alone Mexican families received $171.3 million less than the previous year (see chart below). {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} With the deflating housing bubble and the decline of construction jobs in the first quarter of 2008, the unemployment rate of Hispanic immigrants rose to 7.5%, and Hispanic construction workers now earn less than they did in the first quarter of 2006. {snip}</p>

			<p>At the end, remittances go up sharply as construction jobs go down sharply. In other words, they are making more money at other jobs, during what is supposedly a recession. They are rooted and will stay, but will still be loyal to the Mestizo nation forming in our country and Mexico.</p>

			<p>Seven point eight billion dollars going out a month in remittances, but these folks &#8220;can&rsquo;t&#8221; pay their own emergency room bills.</p>
<p>I think a class-action lawsuit by the hospitals against the construction companies is in order.</p>

			<p>As a Construction worker since 197^ remittances are right up there with the efficacy of foreign aid in my diary of personal governmental affection. </p>
<p>But has anyone noticed that just over 100 years ago when the Maine was blasted in Havana harbor and the US went unilateral on Manila, that today the white &#8220;Spanish&#8221; ruling class of mexico has the United States as it&rsquo;s dumping ground ? </p>

			<p>Many people don&rsquo;t understand that more than a few Mexicans are building some very nice homes in Mexico with these remittances. Money that essentially never was taxed, that was saved often because welfare and document fraud are a part of the remitters life, and in general the American blue collar citizenrys rights to fair wages sacrificed. I have known what it&rsquo;s like to be broke. I even understand the desperation of some of these illegal aliens. My question is,&#8221;What of the desperation of some Americans&#8221; who are affected by illegal immigration. What of their rights? Afterall, most have paid taxes to this nation at one time or other. Most have had ancestores that have paid taxes. Where are our priorities? Don&rsquo;t long time Americans deserve everything the nation has to offer, before Mexican or other nationals? These are the moral dilemmas that so many politicians refuse to face, and why I so utterly despise them. Their utter disrespect for the Americans citizenry, with their warts and all. Know what I mean?</p>

			<p>This is all money, of course, that is NOT going to American workers.  At some point, this &#8220;Ponzi scheme,&#8221; courtesy of the liberal/neocon alliance, is going to totally fall apart soon.  A country dependent on cheap illegal labor never lasts long, for a multitude of reasons.  Relatively high gas prices just accelerate the process.</p>
<p>Thank goodness.  We need to &#8220;drain the swamp,&#8221; so to speak, and start anew.   </p>

			<p>A good idea might be for businesses such as hospitals and such to have access to the illegal OR legal workers pay to force them to pay their horrendous medical bills BEFORE they get their money on payday OR make the EMPLOYER pay it. That way, if the employer is forced to pay it, one can pretty much guarantee it will be removed from the pay of said illegal before he gets what is left.</p>

			<p>I have long wondered why this outflow of money isn&rsquo;t illegal.  It seems to me that given enough time, this will further destabilize the economy.</p>

			<p>Even with this very modest downturn, the May 2008 allowance is still four times that of the May 2000 allowance (and the numbers are all in 2008 dollars, so no role for inflation to explain the huge jump).  In the space of 8 short years, Mexicans have quadrupled the amount of earnings they are sending home.  This is cause for great concern.</p>

			<p>Would anyone venture to guess what the PETTY THEFTS, SHOPLIFTING AND BURGLARY INCIDENTS ROSE TO LATELY? Or the impact on welfare? Don&rsquo;t kid yourself. Like those four Mexican shoplifters my wife spotted last week at the local Wal-Mart, the illegals are not reluctant to do a little stealing to get along.</p>
<p>With all the crying by W-M about stock shrinkage&hellip; you wonder WHY store security people are never in sight.</p>

			<p>I know I&rsquo;m slow, but could someone please explain why Mexicans are allowed to send their pay home, then expect to get free medical care among other freebies? I can just imagine what my neighbor would say if I confronted him with the following: &#8220;I just bought a new car and I&rsquo;m kinda short of funds, so I though you wouldn&rsquo;t mind feeding and clothing my kids.&#8221; Just think of the answer you&rsquo;d get. But, this is the reasoning that  our idiot government and the even more idiotic government of Mexico have worked out. With whomever wins in November, it will continue. The scenario: Illegals break in, give false documents or stolen IDs, change their names when necessary, bring their large families to be taken care of, hire out illegally and BINGO! Their punishment - AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP. They have a place to go - where do we go to avoid the crime and overpopulation?</p>

<p>Modern epistemology is nihilistic and anti-rational.  Surely, you have read Atlas Shrugged (1957), where you could/can see predictions of the coming hell.</p>

<p>Because of those old fools in our courts, trying to legislate via constitutional interpretation! The idea the damned illegals can leech of the American taxpayers as they do, while paying virtually NO taxes, steal Americans&rsquo; jobs out from under them, then get every kind of hand-out galls a lot of us HONEST American taxpayers and workers.</p>
<p>It is a crime   &mdash;   an illegal can bring his brook of six and his wife to any hospital ER facility, demand and get all kinds of medical care   &mdash;   sticking the hospital (and eventually our taxpayers) with the unpaid bill. The illegals who don&rsquo;t send money home simply bring their tribe here   &mdash;   to be supported in undeserved luxury by the American taxpayer!</p>
<p>Now you can understand why SO MANY AMERICANS ARE OUTRAGED BY ILELGAL IMMIGRATION! Just so the corporations and smaller business owners can get cheap labor.</p>

			<p>The illegal immigrant latino networks in the SouthWest have a lock on entire industries across a large geographical area (the southwest of the USA). They are heavily into blue collar jobs now.. not just those jobs they want you to believe they are doing.</p>
