						<p>The Rev. Jesse Jackson used the N-word during a break in a TV interview where he criticized presidential candidate Barack Obama, Fox News confirmed Wednesday.</p>
<p>The longtime civil rights leader already came under fire this month for crude off-air comments he made against Obama in what he thought was a private conversation during a taping of a &#8220;Fox &amp; Friends&#8221; news show.</p>
<p>In additional comments from that same conversation, first reported by TVNewser, Jackson is reported to have said Obama was &#8220;talking down to black people,&#8221; and referred to blacks with the N-word when he said Obama was telling them &#8220;how to behave.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though a Fox spokesman confirmed to The Associated Press that Jackson used the slur, the network declined to release the full transcript of the July 6 show and did not air the comments.</p>

			<p>It is incidents like these that have made me to cease watching Fox News.Fair and balanced my butt. CNN has at least the guts to have someone like Jared Taylor or James Edwards of the political cesspoo on the airl. I say that the people the dangerous to whites are Bill Oreilly and Sean Hannity.They give credibilty to lowlifes like Jesse Jackson and Oreillys good buddy Al Sharpton.</p>

			<p>None of this matters to the media.  Jackson will continue to pompously posture in front of the camera as though he were a  sagacious dignitary dispensing words of wisdom, and the media will still hang on his every word as though he were offering insightful and meaningful commentary.  Some things never change.</p>

			<p>The latest news is that Al Sharpton has come out against JJ:</p>
<p>https://wcbstv.com/local/sharpton.jackson.nword.2.773359.html</p>
<p>Now hopefully this eviscerates JJ&rsquo;s credibility to criticize white people.  Also it shows Fox News for what it is.  The most conservative cable TV talk commentators are Lou Dobbs (CNN) and of course PJB (MSNBC).  </p>

<p> FOX News is only remotely better than MSNBC or CNN, when it comes to white racial interests; some on the network are abjectly hostile to them like Uberschweinhund Sean Hannity and Geraldo Rivera (big surprise there,) while others are mildly informed like Bill O&rsquo;Reilly. So this cover up, is really no big surprise to me; after all, that these fools would still have Comrade Jesse on as a credible guest, after his histrionic buffoonery during the Duke &#8220;rape&#8221; hoax says far more then the censoring itself. </p>
<p>Or put another way, they routinely note that he is a race hustler on the network, but still give him air time regularly. Funny, they don&rsquo;t extended the same courtesy to Mr. Taylor with equal uniformity and he has yet to be caught: slurring, slandering, or lying about any group or individual ever. In fact, I would hazard to guess that it is his grasp of facts and figures regarding the truths of racial differences and the disparities they engender, that keeps him off the &#8220;preferred guest&#8221; list.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!<br>

			<p>Psst I heard that J.J. is not really a reverend and he talks down to everybody because he is a very learned confidence man.  He builds confidence in people by what he is saying because you are thinking no one could be this forceful or resolute in his beliefs of the arguments without there being some kind of truth to what he&rsquo;s talking about.  Wrong again you guilt-ridden CEO&rsquo;s with more money than common sense.</p>

			<p>I agree with others that Fox is really only scarcely better, if ay all than the rest of the mainstream - and this has only gotten worse over time. The FNC really is little more than a shill for the Republican party and it&rsquo;s Neoconservative leadership! </p>

			<p>I saw one report that had more of the transcript available for viewing. Apparently Jesse Jackson called Obama a half-breed (n-word). My first thought was he was referring to Obama as one of those blacks who used to work in the house as opposed to one of those blacks who used to work in the fields. I wonder if the description means something else. </p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how &#8220;hardnosed&#8221; and &#8220;cut to the chase&#8221; white conservatives will be, but once it comes to minorities and racial/PC issues, they back off.  </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m sure most of you seen Mrs. Hasselbeck on &#8220;The View&#8221; when she was brought to tears over the N-word situation? She represents the mind of many white people who&rsquo;ve tried to be tolerant and kind towards blacks while receiving none in return.  </p>
<p>She, like many kind white people are psychologically hurt after years of ethnic intimidation and negative socialization. She&rsquo;s obviously a very nice person, who cares about people but as usual, NOTHING IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR BLACKS!  </p>
<p>No matter how hard white people try to be understanding towards blacks and their issues, we get no appreciation for our sacrifices.  It almost brought me to tears seeing this kind women trying her hardest to cater to blacks. Mrs. Hasselbeck, if you&rsquo;re reading this [?] my heart goes out to you.</p>
<p>But make no mistake, no matter how long whites have been socialized to hate themselves, time is running out for our tolerance&hellip;.</p>

			<p>O&rsquo;Reilly, Hannity, and Fox News have to be some of the most gut-less creations that have ever come down the pike. Especially the great hard hitting O&rsquo;Reilly. The way Sharpton eats him alive is really nauseating,yet he has him on his show time &amp; time again. Two of his more disgusting episodes were a few years back. In one Paul Hornung of Green Bay Packer and Notre Dame fame and at the time a commenator on The Notre Dame Football Radio Network made the statement that since ND was moving to a different conference and a much tougher schedule maybe the school should loosen up on its academic standards so as to attract more high quality black players. The black race hustlers went nuts, the school apologized, Hornung was fired and the Great O&rsquo;Reilly piled on Hornung, what a brave guy. In the second case a High School principal in Georgia allowed white students to have their own prom after having allowed blacks the same privelege. This did not seem to meet with the approval of our tough but fair minded reporter. What a sick joke of a tough guy.</p>

			<p>When they use the N-word (and can any term sound sillier than OUR obligatory term, &#8220;N-word?!&#8221; They have us talking like school children! Don&rsquo;t we jump through their hoops, though!), can we at least then call them, &#8220;N-people&#8221;?</p>

			<p>I mean, if we continue to use this silly-sounding term, &#8220;N-word,&#8221; then some linguistic evolution will inevitably take place, giving terms like:</p>
<p>N-slaved: working long, hard hours to pay for government programs for blacks.</p>
<p>N-tranced: believing all God&rsquo;s chillun&rsquo; got the right stuff to build rocket ships to the moon.</p>
<p>N-mate: white victim of black rape in prison: </p>

(scroll down to &#8220;race and ethnicity,&#8221; in this report by the lefty group, Human Rights Watch)</p>
<p>N-complete: complete enough for an an affirmative action hire.</p>
<p>N-genius: having limitless capacity for invention.</p>

			<p>As I watch, and hear all this madness&hellip;the white world poisioning and strangling itself, killing it&rsquo;s babies, ushering in the tidal wave of third world immigration that will crush and drown it, I feel almost giddy with the sense of possibilities.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not cracking up. I just mean,that when the world has gone mad&hellip;stark raving mad, a sane man can make his way. </p>
<p>The old order is DEAD, DEAD, DEAD. Make no mistake, and don&rsquo;t waste time on a eulogy. Nobody cares, and what&rsquo;s done, is DONE.<br>
 <br>
We, whites, must make our way as individuals, and make contact with eachother as we can. But our strength will be in simply being sane, non-deluded, fiercely independent individuals. We don&rsquo;t even need to be militant. Forget that. <br>
We simply need to hold our heads up and think, reason, and act. That IQ we have-that &#8220;scientists&#8221; are backpedaling to disprove? It wil serve us, as it always has. Our morals, our work ethics? They will buoy us, as we uphold them. We will sure as hell have to find NEW ways to make money, save it, and build new conduits for productivity, security and advancement. But don&rsquo;t fear all that&hellip;it&rsquo;s our racial heritage. WE are the reason the modern world exists, and our ancestors hewed that world out of chaos, pestulence, death, warfare and backwardness. Our task is the same as it has always been: evolve, inovate, lead, dominate, succeed, forge onward endlessly. WE still hold the torch that lights the future. And now we know the future is for us exclusively-because the third world hates us, and the other whites hate us worse. <br>
But as they&rsquo;re all either loony (liberal whites) or dysfunctional square pegs unfit for the modern world (the third worlders), they are bith irrelevant. Brush them all aside,ignore them, and go your own way, bravely, with a light heart. This is your plight. Are you going to cower and reminisce, or move ahead? For God&#8221;s sake, don&rsquo;t get offended, and emmulate the sick whining super-Feminists, &#8220;professional minorities&#8221;,  millitant Gays, Marxists and other assorted navel-gazing, self-involved failures. Don&rsquo;t even fear the ultra greedy uber-rich. Their eternal albatross is their overwhelming greed. Greed equals stupidity, because it motivates the black-hearted to posess more than they can hold. They always crumble under the weight of their megalomaniacal need. They will Always do themselves in. They won&rsquo;t ever stop a free white man. <br>
Our white brethren are nearly reduced to the level of infants soiling their diapers. They writhe on the ground like helpless babies. Their minds are mush.<br>
 The Third worlders are, as ever, incompotent, save for their breast-beating demagogues. Nothing there has changed. None of them can touch a well-composed white man. We&rsquo;ll do just fine in hard times. Screw the rest. We DON&rsquo;T need them.</p>

<p>Posted by A. White at 6:18 PM on July 17 </p>
<p>You are absolutely 100% correct A White.  Did you see the segment from &#8220;The View&#8221; where they were talking about the &#8220;N&#8221; word.  The black woman told Barbara Walters that she can use the N word because to her it&rsquo;s a term of &#8220;endearment&#8221; while Barbara can&rsquo;t say it because then it takes on a different meaning.  And they need to replace Elizabeth Hasselback.  I was embarrassed to watch her crying buckets about how we need to get rid of these harmful words.  She can&rsquo;t stand up to those other 4.  She&rsquo;s a wimp.</p>
<p>But as with everything else with blacks, there is always a double standard - they can do it, but we can&rsquo;t.  I still believe in that old rhyme we used to repeat when I was a kid &#8220;Sticks and stones may break my bones but names will never hurt me.&#8221;  <br>

			<p>The best explanation for the n-word disparity described by commenters above came from a once-upon-a-time black woman troll caller to local talk radio, who called herself &#8220;Project Girl.&#8221;  She said that white people were just jealous because blacks now &#8220;owned&#8221; the n-word, and thus were wholly responsible for its decorum.</p>
<p>Four hundred years, and they now have a word.  Wow.</p>

			<p>Re my last post: A friend of mine went to the Berkeley Marina to watch this year&rsquo;s 4th of July fireworks, and there were no parking spaces left, except for two &#8220;empty&#8221; spaces occupied by a black family picnicking. </p>
<p>My friend asked them pleasantly if they would mind picnicking on the grass instead, as many other families were visibly doing, and was stunned when she got a rude response much like Jackson&rsquo;s response at anyone&rsquo;s &#8220;telling &#8216;N-words&rsquo; how to behave.&#8221;</p>

			<p>The manifest dishonesty about the N-word in our times, is the deceit that if only we stop using the N-word, then the type of person who many, (including, apparently, many blacks in our times who use the term to describe themselves) have found appropriately described by the N-word, will disappear. But ceasing to use that word does not suddenly and magically make certain types of people or certain types of behavior disappear. Removing a word does not remove the reality that it points to.  I once heard someone say, &#8220;I have no problem with blacks.  It&rsquo;s the N  &mdash;  -&rsquo;s I hate.&#8221; My 90 year old black Jamaican next door neighbor lady, disgusted with the behavior of her grandson who I guess she thought fit the term, informed me, in the most decisive tone, that she was not an American N  &mdash;    &mdash;  .   If you ban or criminalize the use of the N-word, that does not remove the reality to which it points, nor the legitimate distaste that many find in contemplating or beholding that reality.  The N-word could be seen as referring to a certain &#8220;gestalt&#8221; : acombination of behavior, attitude and other personal traits, which will not disappear through the most fanatical and fascist censorship of language.  In other words, a pig doesn&rsquo;t become a princess if you ban the word &#8220;pig.&#8221;  </p>

<p>Exactly!  Changing the word will not transform the reality.  If the fact is unpleasant, then it will remain unpleasant, no matter what the term.  Eventually, given due time, the currently faddish &#8220;person of color&#8221; or  African-American&#8221; will come to be considered insults and will be banned by the  PC authorities as having bad connotations.  Well, who gives such words their bad connotations?</p>

<p>That was an amazingly educational link you gave. Really remarkable.  Thank you.  I have no suggestions, other than the need to maintain free and open discussion.  Perhaps someone will come up with an answer. Censorship and secrecy are the  enemies of our cause; and those who seek to impose them on us know that fully well. Let&rsquo;s guard the precious Internet and  make use of  it while we have it.</p>

<p>Thank You! You are absolutely right. Your words were very inspirational. A shot in the arm. If we continue to do what we always have done, believe in ourselves,do our best and remain composed,we can see this through. Our intelligence, morals, and work ethic will see to that. </p>
<p>The problem is that we see every day how things are eroding around us and there is little we can do to stop it. As an individual it sometimes seems too much to bear, but there is too much at stake. Failure is not an option.</p>
