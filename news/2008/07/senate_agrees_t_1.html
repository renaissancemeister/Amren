						<p>The Senate voted Wednesday to triple spending for a much-acclaimed program that has treated and protected millions in Africa and elsewhere from the scourges of AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.</p>
<p>The 80-16 vote committed the United States to spending up to $48 billion over the next five years for the most ambitious foreign public health program ever launched by the United States.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The bill passed by the House in April approved $50 billion, including $5 billion for malaria, $4 billion for tuberculosis and $41 billion for AIDS. Of the AIDS money, a proportion &mdash; $2 billion next year &mdash; would go to the international Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Actual spending levels still have to be approved in annual appropriations bills.</p>
<p>Earlier Wednesday, the Senate, acceding to arguments that Congress must also address humanitarian issues closer to home, agreed to set aside $2 billion of the $50 billion for American Indian water, health and law enforcement projects.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Senate vote came after months of negotiations with Senate conservatives wanting assurances that the new AIDS bill would continue to include programs promoting abstinence and fidelity and would not discriminate against religious groups in allotting funding.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Senate changes will have to be worked out with the House. Those include a measure added to the Senate bill by Sens. John Kerry, D-Mass., and Gordon Smith, R-Ore., that would reverse a policy that has made it difficult for HIV-positive foreigners to visit or seek residency in the United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;For 20 years the United States has barred HIV-positive travelers from entering the country even for one day,&#8221; said Rachel B. Tiven, executive director of Immigration Equality. &#8220;Today the Senate said loud and clear that AIDS exceptionalism must come to an end.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Of course the Senate will vote to give my and your money to AIDS-ridden countries. The Senate, being of the uppercrust of this &#8216;society&rsquo;, they get the taxbreaks. It&rsquo;s easy to give away something that&rsquo;s not yours without feeling the impact. </p>
<p>One of the &#8220;humanitarian issues closer to home&#8221; that Congress needs to discuss is the fact that U.S. citizens like myself don&rsquo;t want to leave their home anymore. I hate being around all of this diversity and equality. </p>
<p>&#8220;AIDS exceptionalism must come to an end&#8221;<br>
Wait until one of their children gets raped by an outsider with AIDS. All they&rsquo;ll know is personal guilt. But, they wouldn&rsquo;t do enough to try to change things for other people.</p>

			<p>Yet, we found out that Africa&rsquo;s population will double by 2036.  Looks like we don&rsquo;t need to spend this money.  If we do, then Washington might as well dig two more ratholes to complement the one they already have.</p>

			<p>In this year of disasters, Senator Gordon Smith (Rino-OR) could not resist sticking his thumb in our eye again, with this proposal to import AIDS patients. I hope they go to live on his street.  As an Oregon resident, what can I expect next, a plague of locusts and a rain of frogs?</p>

			<p>  Sen. Coburn doesn&rsquo;t need to worry about the money being diverted to so-called &#8220;irrevelant other programs.&#8221; It will instead be diverted into the pockets of high politicians and generals, just like most of the money the West has poured into Africa since the colonies there began turning to &#8220;independent countries.&#8221; And why do these sob-sister stories about AIDS in Africa never mention the main reason for the spread of HIV-AIDS?That is to say, widespread, indiscriminate sexual relations, outside of marriage and with total disregard for the consequences. </p>

			<p>This is insane!  No one with AIDS should be allowed to come here.  All they will do is tax our healthcare systems which will have to provide them care for free, and then spread the disease as carelessly as they do in Africa.</p>
<p>Also, I can&rsquo;t even get health care AT ALL because I can&rsquo;t afford it and am told I make too much to qualify for free care.  How DARE our government send billions overseas for health care and leave the citizens here hanging with nothing!</p>

			<p>The shareholders of the pharmaceuticals supplying these drugs will be lining their pockets from the public treasury.</p>
<p>Is their any doubt left that big business owns the government?  Rather than compete in the free market, they conspire with their accomplices in government to reach into our pockets and help themselves to our taxes. </p>

			<p>Unbelievable. How can the USA give money to anyone right now. I may be wrong, correct me if I am. I was under the impression that the US government was financially broken. How can the US government continue to throw money at the third world when they are unable to even fund their own wars, or pay their own bills. (I read somewhere that the US borrows astronomical amounts from China so the government can avoid default)It does not make sense to me. To give money (that you do not even have)to the third world that that is borrowed from China does nothing to advance the interests of American people. Anyway, maybe a American who knows more can elaborate for me.</p>

			<p>Supposedly there is a health care crisis in the United States but our politians decide to spend $50 billion of OUR HARD EARNED TAX MONEY on the lost cause of Africa.  This should clear up any doubt that the politicians in Washington are out of touch with working Americans.</p>

			<p>     Our own legislators are destroying this country, and we elected them. It&rsquo;s time for all voters to choose third party candidates this November. These senators and representatives are a part of the plot to destroy this country and replace it with a one world government. I hear people ask how can these men be so stupid. They are not stupid. They know exactly what they are doing. We are the stupid ones because we believe they actually want to do what is right for the country.</p>

<p>I am almost too enraged to compose myself enought to formulate a civilzed reponse to this insanity. Why not just line up every American and shoot every 25th one? Wouldn&rsquo;t that be more humane then letting millions of AIDS afflicted refugees spread their horrible contagion across the land? </p>

			<p>Is there no end to the madness??? $41 billion for a disease that&rsquo;s easily preventable. Let&rsquo;s hope the end of &#8220;AIDS exceptionalism&#8221; will bring in some of those diseased African Romeos we&rsquo;ve read about on AmRen who purposely infect women, so we can really celebrate this wise and compassionate move.</p>

<p>Every Senator and Congressman voting for this abomination should be forced to stand trial for TREASON AGAINST THE AMERICAN CITIZEN!</p>
<p>Better yet, they should each be forced to let two third-world African AIDS suffers live with the honorable lawmakers.</p>

			<p>Absolutely incredible. Those 80 Senators cannot tell the difference between charity and theft. Or they can, but know most of their constituents will see them as being charitable. Blacks probably support the aid since it is white taxpayer dollars funding it. But most of the 80 could not have been elected without the white vote. </p>

<p>I agree with you.  The only logical explanation is that our liberal government wants to destroy this country by bankrupting us.  One way is through global welfare; another is through radical environmentalism.  Al Gore wants the government to spend trillions of dollars on wind and solar power, and he&rsquo;s a nobody-why does he even get airtime?  <br>
The liberal  government wants to destroy us by eradicating our culture.  One way is through mass immigration from the third world. It is insane to allow diseased people to enter the U.S.<br>
Don&rsquo;t Africans think that the cure for AIDS is raping babies?  How did AIDS become a PC disease?</p>
<p>You are right.  The time has come to vote third party.  Like they say on the Constitution Party website, vote your conscience and leave the results to God.  It wouldn&rsquo;t hurt to beg His forgiveness for allowing the most blessed nation on earth to become such a nightmare.</p>

			<p>There&rsquo;s no cure yet for diseases like cancer and Alzheimer&rsquo;s, but billions are going to be extorted from American taxpayers for AIDS, a PREVENTABLE disease!  How did Americans become responsible for Africa&rsquo;s health care?    </p>

			<p>How obvious does it have to get that we are in some kind of fascist system already. The American public has no real representation. NONE. The Senates basic message to the citizenry is, you just keep paying your taxes now and keep your mouths shut.</p>

			<p>I once interpreted for an English-limited (well, no English) homosexual AIDS- infected man from Honduras at the local general hospital.  The social worker told him that he was welcome in the USA and that there were plenty of opportunities for him here for work and that he didn&rsquo;t have to worry anymore and that his bills would be paid for by the city.  He was a refugee from Hurricane Mitch in Honduras - even though the hurricane was over two years old at least.  So saying that we didn&rsquo;t allow disease-ridden Third World in the past is absurd.  </p>

			<p>Gordon, Kerry and his wife and should personally be forced to support people with AIDS both here and aboard at 75% of their asset worth.  Let&rsquo;s see how long they will sing the same song and play Santa Claus with someone&rsquo;s money.  And they should be forced to live with Africans and blacks here to personally experience how the blacks are actually catching AIDS.</p>

In the real world, when we citizens put ourselves in debt, we have to sign something acknowledging the debt, and provide collateral. I would ask, WHO signs to put our country so deeply in debt, and WHAT is the collateral??? our future as America I  would guess or bet. There can&rsquo;t be much of the U.S. that the Arabs don&rsquo;t own by now.</p>

			<p>From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Senate conservatives wanting assurances that the new AIDS bill would continue to include programs promoting abstinence and fidelity&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>To channel John Stossel:  Gimme a Break!</p>
<p>What brain-dead moron believes that sub-Saharan Africans, with IQs of about 70, are willing (and/or able) to practice fidelity let alone abstinence?</p>
<p>This is a great account of stupid do-gooding from travel writer Paul Theroux, author of Dark Star Safari: Overland from Cairo to Cape Town: </p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip; [M. Theroux] met a young, attractive Finnish woman working on an AIDS project in Zambia. She had been in Africa only a short time, but was already disillusioned. &#8216;It is horrible. There is no sex education. No one will talk about sex, but everyone does it. No one will talk about AIDS, and everyone is infected. We were sent an anti-AIDS film and we showed it. But people in the village said it was shameful  &mdash;  too indecent  &mdash;  and so it was withdrawn.&rsquo; Mr. Theroux asked if she had talked to them. She had. The result? &#8216;They wanted to have sex with me.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="/ar/2003/12.html#article1" rel="nofollow">/ar/2003/12/#article1</a></p>
<p>It just frosts me that clueless politicians of both parties (or whoever is in &#8216;control&rsquo;), those who derive great personal satisfaction from being seen as great White rescuers of Africans  &mdash;  using other people&rsquo;s money, of course, see fit to print more worthless money to perpetuate utter insanity in Africa.</p>
<p>In a sane world, instead of spending worthless dollars on a worthless cause, the money would be spent rescuing Whites from Zim and SA and re-settling them in the US, with full government support.  Any leftover moneys could be spent installing IUDs in Africans to control their un-bridled population growth and help end the perpetual cycle of starvation, warfare, and dependency on the West for their survival.  </p>
<p>It is the only solution.</p>
<p>As Kevin Myer recently wrote in the brilliant article &ldquo;Africa is Giving Nothing to Anyone &mdash; Apart from AIDS&rdquo;:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;.So, how much sense does it make for us actively to increase the adult population of what is already a vastly over-populated, environmentally devastated and economically dependent country?&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

			<p>So, the next time you hear some talking head or politico wailing about the &#8220;economic crisis&#8221; afflicting America, just remember that it is likely the same people championing these AIDS-giveaways, and preparing to import more poverty and disease into out midst. There is no more voting this insanity away. America, on its present course is absolutely doomed. At the risk of sounding the defeatist alarm, it may already be too late.  </p>

Actually, we spent our tax money quite awhile ago. This is just money borrowed from China to transfer to Africa. We are then sent the bill with interest accrued.</p>
<p>China is the #2 foreign entity that the US owes money too.</p>
<p>#2 China 493 Billion (tack on another $41 billion in AIDS debt)</p>
<p>If the American people are so interested in giving Africa aid for AIDs why can&rsquo;t we just donate it?  Why is the government forcing us to give to the charities they are interested in?</p>

			<p>once upon a time, it would have been seen as crimnal to take money from one citizen to give to another. but now most people accept public education, medicare, social security, etc. then the government extended this wealth distribution to illegal aliens. now they take it one step further and extend it to people throughout the world. the US government is in debt because it is borrowing foreign money to pay foreign healthcare. and the American people pay half their yearly income just to service the interest on this debt. this isn&rsquo;t charity. it isn&rsquo;t even tyranny. it&rsquo;s insanity. no wonder congress has a 9% approval rating. </p>
<p>it is said that the people have the government they deserve. and that may be true of most people. but i believe there are exceptions. i didn&rsquo;t vote for this. i don&rsquo;t support this. and i don&rsquo;t feel that i deserve this. i&rsquo;m being dragged along by the currents of stupidity.</p>

As Kevin Myers pointed out in his article in the Irish Independent (for which he is now to be prosecuted), all this charity is merely raising the population of Africa to unsustainable levels.  When the world economy crashes and the charity dries up, the scale of the deaths in Africa will dwarf all wars, plagues and famines in history.</p>

			<p>Our elected officials are betraying the American people and this is just another nail in our coffin. America is in a financial crisis and these custodians of our tax dollars, these buffoons, fritter away $50 Billion without so much as a nod from the American people? How dare they? What on earth can that continent of ignorance ever do for us? The West has been shoveling money into that corrupt continent for a century but it&rsquo;s still as backwards as it&rsquo;s always been. Talk about a lost cause. Does anyone really think this money will ever get into the hands of those ignorant masses that are infected with AIDS or will it just enrich their corrupt tyrants and politicians?  I think Bush and his liberal friends are just looking for more immigrants into America. The Bill, passed by these idiots, has also made it legal for AIDS infected travelers from Africa to enter the US for as little as one day. This enables these throwbacks to spread their infection here in the US. This isn&rsquo;t about doing anything that serves the American people.  It&rsquo;s about stealing money and making liberals feel good. </p>

			<p>I lived in Africa. As you can imagine, it is not a place that would benefit by a larger population. </p>
<p>As Kevin Meyers said in his courageously anti-mainstream article in the  Independent of Ireland, malaria is one of the natural mechanisms at work there to keep the population in check and prevent a slow motion human neutron bomb from going off. As cruel as it may sound, the same is true of AIDS as a natural population control device. </p>
<p>Just imagine the lunacy of the population of Africa, currently about 800m, doubling (or more!) in 30 years. A more populous Africa WILL HAVE A DIRECT NET EFFECT UPON THE POPULATIONS and SOCIETIES OF ASYLUM GRANTER NATIONS IN THE WEST over time. How much of an effect will depend on what we do TODAY. </p>

<p>The article said this bill passed the House in April.  Isn&rsquo;t that the way bills usually go-first the House and then the Senate?  The only hope is a veto from President Bush, which seems unlikely since he already approved an expenditure of $35 billion in Aids welfare in the past, and called for more in his last State of the Union address.  It&rsquo;s a long shot, but we should be writing, calling, and e-mailing for a presidential vero.  Then, is there is one, we can contact our congressman urging them not to override the veto.  Even if we succeeded in this endeavor, an Obama presidency can assure us of even more wasteful sprending on AIDS.    </p>

<p>Translation: &#8220;By an 80-16 margin, the United States Senate voted to steal $48 billion from taxpayers and give it to the owners of drug companies who, in turn, kick back a portion of the stolen money to the thieving senators in the form of campaign contributions. Since the taxpayers effectively have no rights, there is nothing they can do about it unless they want to be imprisoned or killed.

			<p>Here&rsquo;s the deal:  See, they told us all, early on, AIDS doesn&rsquo;t discriminate.  Well, fast forward  20 years.  The truth has finally come out.  AIDS DOES discrimate.  The truth is:<br>
If you do not use drugs, don&rsquo;t require a blood transfusion and are a heterosexual in a monogamous relationship and your partner is faithful, the chance of contracting AIDS is very nearly zero.</p>
<p>Well, the political lobbyists who have come to rely on AIDS money can&rsquo;t let this situation stand.  So if us whiteys are going to stubbornly refuse to die of an AIDS epidemic because we just won&rsquo;t quit abiding by a moral code, then by golly, they&rsquo;ll just have to import the AIDS carriers to rape us and infect us for them.</p>

<p>Why is it that the white race, primarily in the United States, is responsible for attempting to cure AIDS in Africa? Aren&rsquo;t the majority of Africans who have a religion primarily Muslims?</p>
<p>Where are all of these rich Middle Eastern Muslims in all of this?  </p>
<p>Why is it politically fashionable to crucify white Christians on the one hand while expecting them to save the world on the other? </p>

			<p>Every one of those AIDS patients that comes is going to cost us over half a million (if not one million) if they stay. </p>
<p>I still use one of the federally funded clinics for neurology. I have neurosarcoidosis, its progressive - so I know what it means to have the sword hanging over your head. Even though the clinic sees several thousand patients, 234 of them consume 95% of the budget. Those 234 are the AIDS patients - for whom the formulary rules that every other terminal patient is stuck with don&rsquo;t exist, and no treatment is off limits. They have a pretty good lobby. That is what those coming here can expect, and its expensive as all hell to do it.  </p>

			<p>I wonder why the MSM does not cover things like this.</p>
