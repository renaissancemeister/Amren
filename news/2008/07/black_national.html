<h1><a href="http://www.9news.com/news/article.aspx?storyid=94919&amp;catid=339">&lsquo;Black National Anthem&rsquo; Stirs Controversy for City</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tiffani Lupenski, KUSA-TV (Denver), July 2, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Mayor John Hickenlooper&rsquo;s annual State of the City address may get more attention for what wasn&rsquo;t included than what was.</p>
<p>At the start of the event Tuesday morning, City Council President Michael Hancock introduced singer Rene Marie to perform the national anthem.</p>
<p>Instead, she performed the song &#8220;Lift Ev&rsquo;ry Voice and Sing,&#8221; which is also known as the &#8220;black national anthem.&#8221;</p>
<p>When she finished, the audience responded with mild applause. The national anthem was never performed.</p>
<p>Governor Bill Ritter (D-Colorado) discussed the incident on The Mike Rosen Show on 850 KOA on Wednesday morning, calling it &#8220;inappropriate.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ritter went on to say he felt Marie&rsquo;s actions were &#8220;wrong&#8221; and &#8220;outside the bounds.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Marie told 9NEWS she kept her plans to switch songs quiet until the very last moment. She says only she, her husband and a friend knew she was going to sing something other than the &#8220;Star-Spangled Banner.&#8221;</p>
<p>She says she wanted to express her love of her country by mixing the lyrics of &#8220;Lift Ev&rsquo;ry Voice and Sing&#8221; with the melody of the &#8220;Star-Spangled Banner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I decided to sing my version, what was going on in my head was: &lsquo;I want to express how I feel about living in the United States, as a black woman, as a black person,&rsquo;&#8221; said Marie.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Lift Ev&rsquo;ry Voice and Sing&#8221; was written as a poem by James Weldon Johnson in 1899 and set to music by his brother in 1900.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no substitute for the national anthem, period,&#8221; Brown said. &#8220;And that&rsquo;s what really bothered me. You know when we fly the flag, the American flag, it&rsquo;s always the highest flag, as it should be. And that didn&rsquo;t come across today, that didn&rsquo;t happen today.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Below are the full lyrics to &#8220;Lift Ev&rsquo;ry Voice &amp; Sing&#8221;</b></p>
<p>Lift Ev&rsquo;ry Voice and Sing<br/>
Also known as &#8220;The Black National Anthem&#8221;<br/>
by James Weldon Johnson</p>
<p>Lift ev&rsquo;ry voice and sing,<br/>
Till earth and heaven ring.<br/>
Ring with the harmonies of Liberty;<br/>
Let our rejoicing rise,<br/>
High as the list&rsquo;ning skies,<br/>
Let it resound loud as the rolling sea.<br/>
Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us,<br/>
Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us;<br/>
Facing the rising sun of our new day begun,<br/>
Let us march on till victory is won.</p>
<p>Stony the road we trod,<br/>
Bitter the chast&rsquo;ning rod,<br/>
Felt in the days when hope unborn had died;<br/>
Yet with a steady beat,<br/>
Have not our weary feet,<br/>
Come to the place for which our fathers sighed?<br/>
We have come over a way that with tears has been watered,<br/>
We have come, treading our path through the blood of the slaughtered,<br/>
Out from the gloomy past,<br/>
Till now we stand at last<br/>
Where the white gleam of our bright star is cast.</p>
<p>God of our weary years,<br/>
God of our silent tears,<br/>
Thou who has brought us thus far on the way;<br/>
Thou who has by Thy might,<br/>
Led us into the light,<br/>
Keep us forever in the path, we pray.<br/>
Lest our feet stray from the places, our God, where we met Thee,<br/>
Lest our hearts, drunk with the wine of the world, we forget Thee,<br/>
Shadowed beneath thy hand,<br/>
May we forever stand,<br/>
True to our God,<br/>
True to our native land.<br/>

			<p>Well, I guess if you want someone to sing the American national anthem, you have to pick members of the American nation and not members of the black nation.  Blacks are apparently too tempted to sing their own race&rsquo;s anthem and not America&rsquo;s anthem.</p>
<p>She kept it secret because she knew they wanted to pick the anthem and not leave it up to her to sign what she wanted.  This seems to be a narcissistic tendency among black folks to satify their own desires and not the customer.</p>
<p>It would be wise just to select an American national to sing our anthem and not a black national the next time.</p>
<p>Certainly at black events, like hip-hop shows, MTV Awards, Rap Nite at the State Fair, breakdancing competitions, the NBA playoffs in Las Vegas, etc. she and other blacks can still sing the black national anthem.</p>
<p>We would have our own people sing our anthem at our events.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Diversity&#8221; refers to differences.  Once you have diverse ethnic, language, or religious groups, then you start to have differences in interpretation of history, differences in importance of holidays, customs, behaviors, and moral norms, different opinions as to who should be taxed and how government funds should be spent.  These difference lead to arguments and conflict, ultimately leading to distrust, polarization, hatred, and war.  Ethnic diversity is the beginning of the end for any nation.</p>

			<p>This is the type of thing Jared points out in his talks. People choose to live among like minded neighbours that share their culture and worldviews. </p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t expect blacks to sing the national anthem with the same feeling we do, care about our culture like we do, or care about America like we do. </p>

			<p>Getting braver, aren&rsquo;t they? Incidents of this nature can only increase. </p>
<p>The sputterings of White officials will not deter them. After all, isn&rsquo;t this part of the diversity the United States is committed to uphold?  </p>
<p>I say: Throw down the gauntlet. The next time the national anthem is to be sung, sing &#8220;Dixie&#8221;! And let the whole damn crowd join in. And then have a public prayer in the name of J#$^&rtstkl;) &hellip;  in the name of J(*&+mmph) &hellip; (I can&rsquo;t say it! Let me try again!) . . in the name of Jesus. </p>
<p>It would be like a cloudburst of welcoming rain onto the parched, dry, dusty ground of the Wasteland.</p>

			<p>So, once again we see that the blacks need and want to live in other country. The USA is NOT their country and will NEVER be.<br/>
Africa is the MOther of all blacks. She waits for them.<br/>
Amen.</p>

			<p>Why I am not surprised by this .The blacks want a separate country all black.Everything black.Black paper with black print .Give them their own state and let them run it.Black police,black teachers,black scientists,black politicians.Lets see the great cities they will build.Within a month the white nations will be dropping rice to feed the blacks in their black state.</p>

			<p>Im sure many AMREN regulars could compose a &#8216;black national anthem&rsquo; that would sound nothing like the one in the article..come to think of it, Im sure most blacks could also compose one that sounds nothing like &#8216;lift ev&rsquo;ry voice and sing&rsquo;&hellip;</p>

			<p>She was MAKING A STATEMENT. She was saying &#8216;I don&rsquo;t identify with this country and its anthem, this is my song instead&rsquo;. Symbolism is important and powerful and the fact there is a black &#8216;national anthem&rsquo; says a great deal. Can one seriously imagine a &#8220;White national anthem&#8221;? It shows to what extent the minority has the moral, emotional and physocological initiative in America today.</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t expect blacks to sing the national anthem with the same feeling we do, care about our culture like we do, or care about America like we do.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And why is that? Given the history of the US, one should not necessarily think, that Blacks are doing this just to ruffle a few feathers. Given the barbaric bloody events that took place in shaping this nation(which I am proud of usually)but nevertheless, the annihilation of the NATIVE American, Brutalization of the Mexicans, the Torture and rape and the institution of Slavery should in no doubt be a surprise to anyone that can&rsquo;t understand why and how something like can happen.<br/>
I don&rsquo;t agree with this one bit, yes, we have too many skeletons in our closet,we are not a perfect nation, but we are a Great nation,  but if you&rsquo;re not proud of your country, GET OUT.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m sure Lift Ev&rsquo;ry Voice and Sing is a lovely song, but when I hear an announcement that someone is going to sing the national anthem, I expect to hear The Star Spangled Banner. I&rsquo;m funny that way. <br/>
She knows she did the wrong thing and went about it the wrong way or she wouldn&rsquo;t have had to sneak it in the way she did. We don&rsquo;t want or need a &#8220;Black national anthem&#8221;. Doesn&rsquo;t the pledge of allegience still say ONE NATION, or has that changed too?</p>

<p>1. If you felt so bad, why are you still living here since 1865?</p>
<p>2. Isn&rsquo;t it racism to say &#8220;as a black person&#8221; or &#8220;as a white person&#8221;?  I mean&hellip;aren&rsquo;t we all Americans?</p>

			<p>Why are we upset about this?  More power to them, I say.  They are **finally** pursuing things that will lead to greater independence of their race from others.  Bravo!</p>

			<p>Blacks might do well to remember the adage, &#8220;Be careful for what you want, because you might get it.&#8221;  A truly all-black nation will yield such a violently harsh and impoverished reality, that 21st-Century racism will seem like Government Employees&rsquo; day at the local theme park.</p>

			<p>I really would support another &#8220;Back to Africa&#8221; movement for obvious reasons. This was a movement in the early 70&rsquo;s as some of us recall. Problem was it was much easier to stay in America &amp; suck up welfare for a living than to actually work for a living in Africa.</p>

Brava, Ms. Rene Marie. Thank you for opening many sets of eyes.</p>
<p>I hope, in the future, people will stop turning to black singers to add &#8216;diversity&rsquo; to programs. Count me as one who is sick and tired of the ubiquitous black performer being hauled out to sing the anthem.</p>
<p>Blacks complain we only see them as stereotypes but they give us stereoytpe perforances.</p>
<p>Brava.<br/>

			<p>I guess the blood of 800,000 dead civil war soldiers wasn&rsquo;t reparations enough for the racist ingrates. I have no problem with them having their own national anthem, if they take it back to the native land they say they love so much. What pray tell is an African American anyway? It seems it is neither an African, nor an American. Too bad Lincoln met with his &#8220;untimely&#8221; death, as he had plans to send them back to their beloved paradise.  </p>

			<p>Blacks take every opportunity to rub in the face of whites that they are not like us.  That they are not of us.  They hold no loyalty to our societies (very often, the make plain that they mean us harm) and do not feel it necessary to hold themselves to our ways, means and standards.  They are not kith nor kin to us in any manner and have no desire to be.</p>
<p>But, do they really understand the implications of this?  If we cannot be one out of many, then we cannot cohabitate. Everywhere, the world over, balkanization leads to war.  Not only do we vastly outnumber them, but we are far better armed, are overwhelmingly smarter, and, most importantly of all, can act as a cohesive whole&hellip;.where they absolutely cannot.</p>
<p>That is a GRIM reality for their continued existence.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s not a true black national anthem without a reference to their incessant rape, theft, and shaking down of the nation.</p>
<p>This country is a freakin mess thanks to &#8220;The Greatest Generation.&#8221;<br/>

			<p>No matter what blacks in this country attain, rightfully or not, they&rsquo;ll forever have a viewpoint from 1899, at least. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sick of any and every public occassion being turned into a circus blaming whites, blaming conservatives, lifting blacks, lifting liberals. Some people just like to complain when they can&rsquo;t do anything else.  <br/>

			<p>Obama&rsquo;s non-negotiable Commitment to Africa and the Black Value System, MS-13, Spanish only schools, and now a black version of the National Anthem. Add in whites starting to notice the media blackout of non-white on white crime thanks to the internet. I predict a sudden end of white tolerance in 2009.</p>

<p>John Wilkes Booth, for that reason, should be THE mose reviled villain in US history. What I have never understood, though, was why subsequent presidents failed to take up those reins and see the repatriation process implemented. We know that Teddy Roosevelt, Harry Truman, and I suspect every other Commander In Chief secretly desired a way to return them to where they truly belong, but none acted upon it. Andrew Johnson, whose administration had more than its share of problems, should have immediately begun the process, and then (poetic justice) US Grant could have completed it. And then America would forever be America. But, sadly, it did not happen that way.</p>

			<p>Mrs.Rene Marie committed a very unpatriotic act by singing an anthem which was anything other than our national anthem.<br/>
Mrs. Rene Marie and other blacks of her ilk will lie and deceive people throughout white America for years to come but they won&rsquo;t travel very far.<br/>
God has a destiny for blacks in America which is to transcend in accordance with the Constitution and God&rsquo;s laws.<br/>
And it is a project of whites to see that blacks continue to follow Constitutional principle as so many American&rsquo;s who have passed on have done so.<br/>
The future of science and biology continue to make progress by leaps and bounds.<br/>
And although this will sound very controversial at the present time, in the future there will come a time when the genetic defiencies of blacks will be brought into balance with the higher functioning races to become a symbol of hope for Africas people and another phenomenal achievment for the United States of America.<br/>

			<p>2. Isn&rsquo;t it racism to say &ldquo;as a black person&rdquo; or &ldquo;as a white person&rdquo;? I mean…aren&rsquo;t we all Americans?</p>
<p>Clearly, we are NOT all Americans. The blacks always want to say AFRICAN American but they don&rsquo;t want to GO BACK there, not enough welfare and no preferential treatment and except for Mugabe and Mbeke no one over there appreciates a pimp dresser.</p>

			<p>&#8216;She says she wanted to express her love of her country by mixing the lyrics of &ldquo;Lift Ev&rsquo;ry Voice and Sing&rdquo; with the melody of the &ldquo;Star-Spangled Banner.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>She wanted to contribute something she believed would be one more thing that would continue to unite blacks in this country, because almost all of them believe they&rsquo;ll take over if they stay on their present course.  This is her contribution to her separatist black state.</p>
<p>So, the blacks say they want equality, but what they really want is power and control, as if they haven&rsquo;t failed enough in Africa with it, and all the black run cities here in this country.  They separate themselves in many other ways.  (Which is good.  I like it.  I hope they stay &#8220;separated.)</p>
<p>The Mexicans have been running through the streets holding the Mex flag overhead in what they perceive is triumphant victory, and everywhere they live they make sure they are separate and apart from the white majority.  They want to colonize and eventually dominate and control like the blacks.  And, also like the blacks they have no desire whatsoever to adopt the white man&rsquo;s history, traditions, and culture.  Literally millions of them reveal their separatist aims by advocating to give illegal aliens amnesty, because their loyalty lies with their race, not a piece of real estate or the inhabitants who foolishly allowed them to enter.  Does anybody not believe that the vast majority of them would be fighting for Mexico within our borders if the US ever went to war with Mexico?</p>
<p>The Muslims want sharia law here, not the white man&rsquo;s version of christianity, nor do they want anything to do with the culture and traditions of this country.  Like all the other rabble, they came here strictly to earn money, build their mosques and patiently wait until they can assume control either by a violent takeover or through sheer weight of numbers, just as the blacks and Hispanics want to do.  </p>
<p>So, here it is, in the last analysis, a present day America with not only the contentious, squabbling nationalities Roosevelt warned us of, but forces within our borders that amount to nothing less than seditious elements that care not one whit for anything but their own people, customs, tradition and cultures, and it&rsquo;s plain for anybody who has the eyes to see that if it were in the power of the majority of the people in these groups they would be willing to eliminate every white woman, man and child in this country if it was certain they could assume control, especially blacks, and before it is assumed that that statement is an exaggeration, think about it first.</p>
<p>Since unity is an absolute prerequisite for holding a nation together, especially in trying times, and unity belongs only to those nations that have homogeneous populations, can it be any plainer that this country has been destroyed by diversity and has no future in its present form?</p>
<p>China and Japan are patiently waiting to step up as the world&rsquo;s super powers when America implodes, as it inevitably will.</p>

			<p>&#8216;And why is that? Given the history of the US, one should not necessarily think, that Blacks are doing this just to ruffle a few feathers. Given the barbaric bloody events that took place in shaping this nation(which I am proud of usually)but nevertheless, the annihilation of the NATIVE American, Brutalization of the Mexicans, the Torture and rape and the institution of Slavery should in no doubt be a surprise to anyone that can&rsquo;t understand why and how something like can happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you look at the history of the world, violence and brutality occured all over it in the past. Non-whites were ever bit at brutal towards others as whites were and fought over territory, had slavery, etc. Blacks sold their own into slavery. The history of humanity is one of brutality, slavery and horrible treatment of others.  Almost every nation, if you go back far enough, has dark chapters in their pasts, where nasty behavior occured. Slavery and brutality towards blacks indians and others is one part of america&rsquo;s past and it occured between groups of people, all now dead. Today, blacks,indians and mexicans are not brutalized but are favored minorities, especially blacks. Marie, who sang her black national anthem, grew up  most pampered because of her race and has benefited enormously because her ancestors were slaves. Yes, Marie may want to sing her black national anthem but you don&rsquo;t see her wanting to go back to Africa, do you?</p>

			<p>If the woman feels that way about America, let her take a REAL STAND! By moving back to Africa to be with HER people!</p>
<p>Like many Americans, I&rsquo;ve had it up to here with these self-pitying whining Black cry-babies. Claiming we oppressive Whites are obsessed with &#8220;keeping Blacks down,&#8221; or &#8220;in their place.&#8221;</p>
<p>A Black with talent (sports, entertainment) can make millions! A Black often has the advantage at job interviews due to HIS/HER skin color over Whites. An advantage not just limited to landing a coveted job, but for university admissions. Even the proverbial &#8220;bar&#8221; is lowered for them so they can get enrolled.</p>
<p>If a Black has a decent education, makes a reasonable appearance at the job interview, that Black can and will get HIRED for the job he/she is qualfied for. So on what does this silly female base her outlandish claim on, pray tell.</p>
<p>That millions of Black Americans are working at jobs, are successful based on their own abilities and skills   &mdash;   shows just how hollow, how empty the typical discrimination claims by Blacks really are. As to that claimed &#8220;glass ceiling&#8221;, prove your claims&hellip; a lot of Whites can&rsquo;t rise above a certain corporate level either. Given there are only so many positions available at the top of the corporate management pyramid.</p>
<p>Maybe our poor cry-babies need to stop, think and take good hard look at reality! That much, if not most of their claimed discrimination and oppression is either imaginary or of their own causing (lack of education, lack of real ability).</p>

Neither they nor us know. This riddle I suspect will go unanswered; I have yet to hear anything but the same old myths each February when Black History Month rolls around. Truly they are a people burdened&hellip;by themselves. Their sheer incapacity to live in the modern world once was noted privately, but now (post Dr. Watson&rsquo;s comment) it has now quite public and less is it a shameful thing to discuss openly. They aren&rsquo;t &#8220;equal&#8221; and have never been. </p>

<p>EXTREMELY WELL PUT, John. But recall ONE truth   &mdash;   it being far easier to blame someone else (Whites) than looking inward at themselves to find the root cause of their collective failure!</p>
<p>Nagin dropped the ball badly in NOLA. Instead of marshalling every available public bus, school bus, city truck, using city employees to drive them&hellip; he let 50,000 of his people languish in that hell of a Superdome. Instead of setting the example AFTER Katrina, he let his police department steal (sorry, I meant borrow) 28 Cadillacs. Which being low slung probably made much more sense for patrolling waterlogged, debris-strewn streets than higher riding trucks. (At least to Blacks.)</p>
<p>Nagin&rsquo;s incompetence is or was mirrored by virtually every Black that manged to ascend to the mayoral office of an American city. Our history is replete with bad examples. Street, Dinkins, Berry, and so on and on the list goes.</p>
<p>Need still more examples of African&rsquo;s inability to progress? Look EAST   &mdash;   to the African nations. Mugabwe, Amin, Charles Taylor&hellip; again an endless list of corruption, incompetence, lack of any real ability. (Unless you appreciate creative new ways to brutalize and terrorize their kin   &mdash;   with mutilation, rape, murder, cannibalism, necklacing, etc., etc.)</p>
<p>Just WHAT is it in the Blacks&rsquo; psyche preventing them from coming to terms with the reality THEY have to advance themselves By their efforts, their intellectual ability. That they can&rsquo;t expect Whitey to do it for them; and scream &#8220;racism&#8221; at the top of their lungs if we can&rsquo;t do more for them.</p>

<p>Yes, and I know how such a great transformation will come about:  Jesse or Al will wave a magic wand over their heads, and presto, blacks will gain intelligence, plus all the many mental abilities they lack right now.   And, in addition to that, they will no long be so impetuous and burdened with zero impusle control, and they will be able to stop and consider the repercussions of their actions instead of losing control, killing and screaming over every perceived injustice.</p>
<p>You, my friend, are an important part of the reason why we have deteriorated this far already.  It is those whites like you who are so gullible, believing your naive pie-in-the-sky fantasies, that are our biggest obstacle to setting things straight right now.</p>
<p>But let me give you an irrefutable rebuttal to your premise of your egalitarian paradise:  Blacks don&rsquo;t want non-blacks included in it, and because they are obsessed with trouble-making, violence and crime against ALL the races in this nation war will be the order of the day far sooner than the set-up of some 22nd century clinic specializing in making geniuses out of dopes. <br/>

			<p>THere is a parallel in the case of the black debaters who ignored the rules and turned what was supposed to be a debate into an Amos and Andy show.<br/>
When blacks don&rsquo;t play by the rules (Rene Marie evidently was entrusted with the job of singing the national anthem, but decided to sing something else)there never is any official recrimination or punishment for their lack of honor.<br/>
Until they get slammed, instead of coddled, or sometimes even REWARDED for misbehavin&rsquo;, nothing will ever change.<br/>
White people need to develop the courage to speak out against such abuses, regardless of the PCBS they might catch. When one is bold, another is emboldened, and so on. As a group we can do something. As isolated individuals, we can&rsquo;t do much.</p>

			<p>Speaking of the &lsquo;Intention of the Framers&rsquo; of the Constitution, go to Wikipedia and type in &ldquo;Colonization Societies.&rdquo;  No fewer than seven repatriation (Back-to-Africa) societies existed in America&rsquo;s bygone days. Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln were involved, as well, since they were already plenty worried about what they perceived as the inability for freed slaves to ever enter mainstream society on an equal footing. Yep, even before the Civil War, free blacks in northern cities were kickin&rsquo; up their heels with 1800s versions of break dancing and whooping it up (and committing crimes, too). That&rsquo;s HOW Liberia came to be. Once back in Mother Africa, the idyll turned ugly, with American blacks getting into fighting rivalries with the natives. Today, Liberia is, for all intents and purposes, just another corrupt and kleptocratic variation on the African theme of what passes for nations.</p>

			<p>Less not forget what tomorrow is for all Americans. This woman agenda was self, not her race, not her pride, or her devine right to free speech.  It was about making a name for herself, greed is good, it&rsquo;s the American way to think and act about self. and no one else matters..not the division her performance will light in the crosses of men. old wounds unhealed. Old ways of hate and distrust will way anew again. For what ever her reasons or whatever you right to disagree with her &#8220;ACT&#8221;. Don&rsquo;t forget we are all Americans, this woman&rsquo;s will get her 15 minutes of fame.  But we will still have our National Anthem.</p>

			<p>Denver is what Los Angeles was in the 1990s-maybe WORSE, if that seems possible. And L.A. is now worse than mexico City. What the hell difference does it make now if some African racist sings a ridiculous &#8220;anthem&#8221; as an act of stealth hate? <br/>

It would be funny, were it not undeniably true.<br/>
Oh, BTW, I know a dedicated socialist who said with glee at an Obama sppech &#8220;He&rsquo;s a socialist, you know.&#8221;<br/>

			<p>Her &#8220;anthem&#8221; came as no surprize to me, as many(not all)Blacks I deal with have become much more aggresive, and sometimes downright unnecessarily rude toward me and other Whites(in the work place)as an Obama win becomes more and more probable.<br/>
Look for race riots similar to the 60&rsquo;s if he wins or does NOT win. If they get their man, they&rsquo;ll celebrate by going nuts, which usually means burnings and small-scale riots. If the election is close and he loses, Katie bar the door. We&rsquo;ll have riots, murders of Whites and recount after recount to look forward to.</p>

			<p>What a joke?  Another black person who wants to cry and boo hoo about our racist past through a song, while she walks the streets of the greatest country which has ever existed - thanks to - white people.  The poster above is absolutely correct.  You can&rsquo;t find a black person anywhere in the world that has created or been able to sustain anything.  They can&rsquo;t govern themselves - one need only look at every African country that has been turned over to or being run by a black person.  They have destroyed every major city in this country.  Destroyed the work ethic thanks to affirmative action, destroyed schools, increased our crime rate and brought their third world mentality to our streets. </p>

			<p>What is there left to say.  I saw her on CNN late last night and  she said would do the same thing all over again. And then on to something about the National Anthem not speaking to the story of her people that were slaves. Of course. <br/>
 Perhaps some one could get to the PA system during the MLK day celebration in Atlanta  and put Dixie on for the same reason.</p>
<p>But we can expect only more and more of this as, intentional or not, the Obama thing stirs up the black masses and their white admirers.  We are going to see some crazy days.</p>

			<p>      A detailed plan for peacefully taking over neighborhoods<br/>
has already been worked out-google &#8220;Pioneer Little Europe&#8221;. The<br/>
author is an old timer in the Movement and knew Pierce, Rockwell,<br/>
Oswald Mosely, etc. Whether anyone is actually doing it, I don&rsquo;t<br/>
know. The problem is that most Whites are still too comfortable<br/>
to up and move to a new neighborhood. And to ask them to act in<br/>
concert with others? Unthinkable! The Whites who would be able<br/>
and willing probably wouldn&rsquo;t have the right stuff. We are an<br/>
intensely individualistic people. It worked for us in settling<br/>
this continent. Now it works against us. The principle of our<br/>
unity is not the clan but an elected goverment. When that gov-<br/>
erment turned against us we were dealt a knockout blow. A blow<br/>
that wouldn&rsquo;t have hurt other peoples, like Arabs or Chicanos, as much because their clan structure is still in place. They<br/>
never trustedt the goverment to begin with.</p>

			<p>Are we surprised that a black woman found a way to further the black racial agenda in the public forum?  Blacks are the most racist and race obsessed people in this country and this display of black nationalism served to underscore the widening racial divide that exists and the resentment blacks have towards America.</p>
<p>Besides, the theme song from &#8220;The Jeffersons&#8221; is more fitting as a black national anthem.   </p>

			<p>&#8220;So much for freedom&#8221;. posted at 7:28</p>
<p>It is not that Whites cannot stand Whites living apart, it is the government does not want anyone to live free and apart.  That was the problem with Randy Weaver, the Branch Davidians, and the LDS fundamentalists in Texas.  The Southern states also wanted to live free and were invaded by the U.S. federal government.</p>
<p>The problems we have with third world immigtation in this country are happerning all over the Western world.  Our problems seem to have escalated greatly in the 1960s with immigration reform and civil rights legislation. We have  political correctness resulting in loss of freedom, affirmative action resulting in loss of freedom, anti-discrimination laws resulting in loss of freedom, hate speech laws resulting in loss of freedom, religious tolerance resulting in loss of freedom for Christians and Jews.  Have I forgotten anything?  That this is happening to every Western nation cannot be just a coincidence.<br/>
I used to poke fun at conspiracy theorists, and now I are one.</p>

			<p>I hope that whoever hired this woman to sing the anthem did not pay her.  Why didn&rsquo;t they pull the plug on her microphone?  <br/>
Maybe the guy with his hand on his heart thought she was singing other verses than the first.</p>
<p>Schoolteacher,  have you noticed that Black people can&rsquo;t sing anymore?  They do that odious note bending that drives me nuts.<br/>

<p>Blacks at that time were working with White direction and influence. Many of the songs were written by Whites and intended for a mixed audience. Blacks are becoming more African and less American. The melodic is receding and the rumble of the drums is drawing nearer. The veneer of civilization is fading and peeling away. We once held some common bonds. Perhaps we laughed at the same shows (there were only 3 channels)or shared a joy for a clever song. Those times have ended. </p>

<p>Sam Cooke was shot to death in a motel while in the act of beating a woman whom he had brought there, I assume, for an evening of reading Byron&rsquo;s poetry.<br/>
When he began to beat the woman the motel manager/owner came to the door and was threatened by Sam.  The woman did not play Cupid and Draw Back her Bow but rather drew back the hammer and then dropped it on Sam. Instead of learning something about History and Biology he decided to live his profligate life and now he&rsquo;s workin&rsquo; on that big Chain Gang down below.</p>
