				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stephen Wright, Daily Mail (London), July 12, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Their arrival in the capital is said to have led to a huge rise in thieving and prompted the creation of a specialist police squad to tackle their sinister activities.</p>
<p>Yet in a move which has caused disbelief amongst rank and file officers, Scotland Yard has asked staff to &lsquo;celebrate&rsquo; the contribution of Roma gipsies to &lsquo;London&rsquo;s culture and diversity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In a notice posted on the force&rsquo;s intranet website, Denise Milani, director of the Met&rsquo;s &lsquo;Diversity and Citizen Focus Directorate&rsquo;, urges officers to observe the first ever &lsquo;Gipsy Roma Traveller History Month.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ignoring the huge drain on resources caused by Romanian pickpockets who target commuters and tourists in the West End, Miss Milani &mdash; a protege of Metropolitan Police chief Sir Ian Blair &mdash; says Roma gipsies are welcome in the capital.</p>
<p>She says: &lsquo;We welcome the celebration of the community&rsquo;s history and contributions to London&rsquo;s culture and diversity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Met Police works to make London a safer city for all and we are committed to understanding and working with all communities, including the Gipsy Roma Traveller community.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Gipsy Roma Traveller History month celebrates their history, culture and contributions to the rich tapestry of Britain&rsquo;s diversity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The mother-of-two&rsquo;s comments were described as &lsquo;political correctness off the Richter scale&rsquo; by one furious detective. He added: &lsquo;What planet is this lady living on? We have been run ragged by gangs of Romanian gipsies who are targeting innocent people in the West End.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How is that enhancing the rich tapestry of cultural life in Britain?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Following the expansion of the European Union, the number of Romanian criminals known to police in central London rose from 12 in 2006 to 214 last year.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, police staged a dramatic series of dawn raids in Slough, Berkshire, in a campaign to stamp out a Fagin-style crime ring involving Romanian slave children smuggled into Britain.</p>
<p>Ten children were taken into care and 24 of their suspected controllers arrested on suspicion of human trafficking and organising theft involving up to £1billion a year. Many of those arrested were understood to be Roma gipsies.</p>
<p>The youngsters ranged in age from less than one to 17. Many such children are made to travel to central London every day and carry out crimes including pickpocketing, credit card cloning and theft.</p>
<p>Police have estimated that each active Romanian criminal makes about £100,000 a year &mdash; most of which is channelled back to his home country to fund luxury cars and homes.<br>

			<p>Contributing to &#8220;The rich tapestry of Britain&#8221; The flowery phrases used by these loony leftists almost triggers a gag-reflex in me. The thought that any true Brit could swallow it without the same reaction, is almost too much to believe. Every day crime sky-rockets in the UK, and every day. And indigenous White Britons are being threatend with arrest, if they say the wrong thing to the wrong people. Diversity is not their strength, diversity is their down-fall.</p>

			<p>They are a problem here in the US too but nobody realizes it. Most of the psychic studios here are run by the gypsy women who send most of the money that they steal to a boss who will give them a percentage of the take. The way that the scam works is that someone will come in for a reading and they will be told that a curse has been placed on them and for X amount of dollars it can be removed. Of course the curse is never removed and more and more money is needed to try to remove it. Most of these women know each other so if someone stops going to one particular psychic and goes to another their story follows them. The women cloak the scam in religious terms, using Jesus, church and other Christian terms to reel in a victim. When they say that they are going to their church to work on your problem they are really meeting with the other women to discuss how much they have taken from you and how much more they believe they will be able to make from you. They move around so much and people are so afraid to report this sort of confidence crime that they can almost always escape justice. The ones that do get caught almost never serve any real time and you will never get your money back. </p>

			<p>Only in the psychotic minds of anti-white multiculturalists is crime to be celebrated as &#8220;diversity.&#8221; I suppose someday they&rsquo;ll say the outrageous numbers of black/Muslim-on-white rape are beneficial to society, because it&rsquo;s &#8220;integration.&#8221;</p>

			<p>I loved the detective&rsquo;s exasperated &#8220;What planet is this lady living on?&#8221; IMO it&rsquo;s the same planet, but in that morally inverted parallel universe where savagery reigns supreme and military personnel advance in rank by killing their superiors. No doubt gypsy behavior is normal there.</p>
<p>Send Denise Milani to Romania and force her to slave away in a gypsy camp. Then see what she says about their &#8220;culture.&#8221;</p>

			<p>We have several families of Travelers living in Fort Worth, Texas.</p>
<p>And they will readily refer to themselves as being Travelers.  Part of their scam is traveling around the South &#8216;fixing&rsquo; cracked driveways of elderly people by spraying a black paint on the surface and claiming its asphalt.  They take the money and are gone the next day.  They rake in thousands and live in big houses with fine cars out front.</p>
<p>I was stationed in London in the very early 70&rsquo;s.  A good friend (from Cherokee, Iowa) lived in Slough.  It was a nice house in what I took to be a nice town.  I guess the town has changed&hellip;</p>

			<p>This article was uplifting to read, if the rank and file police officers in the UK are becoming openly and vocally mutinous then the possibility for revolt exists.</p>
<p>Let us hope the next time they decide to round up the Nick Griffin types the police simply refuse to carry out their orders. <br>

			<p>The famous 18th century Scots economist Adam Smith, author of &#8220;The Wealth of Nations&#8221;  was kidnapped by gypsies when he was 4 or 5.  His parents hired a sort of bounty hunter private investigator to find him and bring him home. </p>
<p>Adam Smith was one of the lucky ones.  He was found and brought home in a couple weeks.</p>
<p>If he had not been found, he would have been used as a beggar child slave till he was 12 or so, and then sold to a ship&rsquo;s Captain for a life of indentured servitude or slavery in America.</p>
<p>For centuries the liberal idiots who are entranced by gypsies denied that gypsies kidnapped children and used them as slave beggars.  But the truth is, they did kidnap European children to use and sell as slaves. </p>

			<p>Here is the Italian attitude towards the gypsies.  Note that the girls had been harassing and begging from beach goers.</p>
<p>Foxnews.com</p>
<p><br>
Naples  &mdash;   Photographs that depict Italian sunbathers relaxing at the beach despite the nearby presence of the bodies of two Gypsy girls who had drowned, have raised questions about Italian attitudes toward the Roma minority, The U.K. Guardian reported.</p>
<p>The incident took place outside of Naples on Saturday. At about 1 p.m., four Gypsy teens, who had reportedly been begging beachgoers, decided to go into the water, despite apparently not being able to swim.</p>
<p>The girls were hit by an unusually large wave, resulting in an attempted rescue by life-savers from a nearby beach. Two of the girls were saved. The other two, aged 14 and 16, could not be reached in time, The Guardian reported.</p>
<p>Following their drowning, the bodies of the two girls were dragged ashore and laid out under beach towels, The Guardian said.</p>
<p>But Italian media later reported that the deaths of the girls and the presence of their bodies did not stop the sunbathers from enjoying their day at the beach, as most continued with their activities.</p>
<p>According to The Guardian, Italy is reportedly plagued by anti-Gypsy sentiments.</p>
<p>Italian newspaper La Repubblica wrote, &#8220;While the lifeless bodies of the girls were still on the sand, there were those who carried on sunbathing or having lunch just a few metres away.&#8221;<br>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br>
Indeed. I suppose the female children were kept to be used as slaves of another sort. Thus, one finds fair and even blond or red-haired  persons among Gypsy troups  today   &mdash;   as in Ireland   &mdash;   the legacy of  kidnapped ancestors long-forgotten.</p>
<p><br>
(PS. I wonder if Smith&rsquo;s parents had to pay a ransom to get him back. Quite likely. In addition to the bounty, of course. [I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if bounty hunters and Gypsies collaborated   &mdash;   to their mutual proit.]  To the poor, such a payment would have been impossible. Their child was gone forever.  With Moorish pirates prowling the coast, and Gypsy vagabonds scouring the land, life was perilous even in one&rsquo;s own homeland   &mdash;   especially for the poor.</p>
<p>I can still remember the phrase, used by people of my grandparents&rsquo; generation to scold naughty children: &#8220;If you don&rsquo;t behave, I&rsquo;ll give  [sell?] you to the Gypsies.&#8221;   Come to think of it, one doesn&rsquo;t hear that admonition anymore. I suppose it&rsquo;s Politically Incorrect.)</p>

<p>Yes, I read that story (and the very slanted comments from the Italian equivalent of the ACLU) in one of the European papers.   Well, what did they expect the (perfectly innocent) picknickers on the beach to do?   Gnash their teeth, wail and tear their hair?  There was nothing anyone COULD do!   So, for them, life went on.</p>
<p>Also, there were odd details about the story.  The beach  [unidentified] was said to be &#8220;west of Naples&#8221;. If you go much west of Naples, you&rsquo;re out in the Mediterranean!  Furthermore, the girls (who  allegedly couldn&rsquo;t swim) ventured out into rough and dangerous water, apparently on a sudden whim!  Does that makes sense?   Gypsies go to the beach to beg or steal, not to swim. They would have gotten a beating if they didn&rsquo;t come home with enough money for the day.  And the beachgoers pictured (blonds) looked more like northern European tourists (common there) than Neapolitan locals. So what were they supposed to do?  Cancel their vacations?  The matter was  already in the hands of the authorities.  </p>
<p>This story was just a skewed attempt to make Italians look bad for the sake of fighting the new, tougher restrictions on Gypsies.  And to stir up sympathy for Gypsies. As if the two things are in any way connected!  Also, while there were scathing quotes from officials of the usual left-wing groups, there were none  from those with opposing views.  At any rate, it was not the fault of any of these picnickers on the beach that these two girls had died (through their own folly) although the slant of the story was to make it appear that way   &mdash;    that they were victims of typical Italian heartlessness.  </p>
<p><i>  Recent weeks have seen heightened tensions between Italian authorities and the country&rsquo;s Roma minority amid a crackdown by Silvo Berlusconi&rsquo;s government targeting illegal immigrants and talk by government officials of a &#8220;Roma emergency&#8221; that has seen the 150,000-strong migrant group blamed for rising street crime. <br>
That has provided justification for police raids on Roma camps and controversial government plans to fingerprint all Roma   &mdash;   an act condemned by the European Parliament and United Nations officials as a clear act of racial discrimination. Popular resentment against Romanies has also seen Roma camps near Naples attacked and set on fire with petrol bombs by local residents. </i> [Note that there is no mention at all of the  Gypsy crimes that exhausted the patience of local residents!] </p>
<p><br>
<i>  In a statement published on its Web site, the Italian civil liberties group  EveryOne said Saturday&rsquo;s drowning had occurred in <b>an atmosphere of &#8220;racism and horror&#8221; </b>&hellip;.  &#8220;The most shocking aspect of all this is the attitude of the people on the beach,&#8221; the statement said. &#8220;No one appears the slightest upset at the sight and presence of the children&rsquo;s dead bodies .&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I ask again:  &#8220;Well, what would you have wanted them to do?&#8221;</p>

			<p>I thought the job of the police was to uphold the law and arrest criminals, not to &#8220;celebrate&#8221; various ethnic communities. (Even if there was anything to celebrate about Gypsies, which there isn&rsquo;t).</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, the magic of a low-angle shot with a high zoom lens.</p>
<p>Unless I see a photo from a higher angle I seriously doubt that pair in the photo were near the girls. It&rsquo;s all about sensationalism, and what better way to do that than making it appear that those two were mere feet away.&#8221;<br>

Thank you, Mr. Dumpty!   I didn&rsquo;t catch that, and didn&rsquo;t even think of it.  </p>
<p>What you have pointed out is absolutely true.  With a high-power lens (which this seems to be), the space can be compressed dramatically and be made to appear that the beach-goers were sitting right next to the corpses while they continued to picnic.   Sensationalism indeed!   How low will these pararazzi  and politicians stoop to make a point?  And shame on the media who printed it. They will go to any lengths to pursue their agenda.</p>
