				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Teresa Watanabe, Los Angeles Times, July 25, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Hate crimes in Los Angeles County rose to their highest level in five years last year, led by attacks between Latinos and blacks, officials said Thursday.</p>
<p>The annual report by the Los Angeles County Human Relations Commission showed hate crimes rose by 28%, to 763, with vandalism and assault leading the way.</p>
<p>In what commission Executive Director Robin Toma called an alarming trend, hate crimes based on race, religion and sexual orientation all rose, increasing against nearly all groups &mdash; including blacks, gays, Jews, Mexicans, whites and Asians &mdash; even as crime in general declined.</p>
<p>The largest number of racial hate crimes involved Latino suspects against black victims, followed by black suspects against Latino victims. Latinos also made up the largest number of suspects in hate crimes based on sexual orientation. Whites were the leading suspects in religion-based incidents. Overall, blacks made up nearly half the hate crime victims, totaling 310.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&rsquo;re seeing is the democratization of hate crimes,&#8221; said Brian Levin, who directs the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at Cal State San Bernardino. &#8220;We&rsquo;re not only seeing a diversification of victims but also increased diversification of offenders.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Amanda F. Susskind, Pacific Southwest regional director of the Anti-Defamation League in Los Angeles, said hate rhetoric is rising online and is particularly targeting youth, perpetuated in part by as many as 110 white supremacist organizations nationwide.</p>
<p>The rhetoric appears to be influencing other groups, Toma said. He cited law enforcement reports that some Latino gang members who targeted blacks in the Harbor Gateway area of Los Angeles were found with neo-Nazi material and some Latino gangs were forming alliances with white supremacists in prisons to prey on blacks.</p>
<p>Despite the intense national debate over illegal immigration, hate crimes against immigrants decreased slightly from 42 to 39. However, the report noted that some crimes may &#8220;be inspired by anti-immigrant animus but it may not be explicitly verbalized.&#8221;</p>
<p>The report noted, for instance, that as of last August, Pasadena police had investigated 69 crimes involving attacks against Latinos, many of them low-wage immigrant workers who were robbed and beaten, allegedly by African Americans. But none of the cases were submitted to the county commission for inclusion in the hate crime report this year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One of the most worrisome findings, commissioners said, was the rising number of hate crimes between Latinos and blacks &mdash; many of them driven by gang hostility.</p>
<p>The report found that a third of suspected Latino-on-black crimes and 42% of suspected black-on-Latino crimes involved gangs. The crimes were increasingly violent last year, including two attempted murders.</p>

			<p>But they don&rsquo;t tell us who committed these hate crimes.  And the dirty little secret is that those Chicano Hispanics who commit them will be counted as white.  So if black commits hate crime against Chicano, it&rsquo;s recorded as that on the books.  But if the same Chicano in retribution commits a hate crime as black, it goes down on the official books as a white-on-black hate crime.</p>
<p>Connie Rice, a civil rights attorney in L.A., said that this uptick in hate had to do with the bad economy.  I don&rsquo;t think one Morris Seligman Dees, Esq. will use this canard the next time some white man with an obsession with white sheets or bent crosses goes on a fit of enmity and exuberance.</p>

<p>Why does the media ALWAYS make blacks out to be the victim? I&rsquo;m getting so SICK AND TIRED of this and the way they all worship Barack Obama. </p>
<p>Anyone whose been to prison or has a friend or family member that has been to prison knows damn-well that blacks are the ones who prey on others most of the time. If Latins and Whites are forming an alliance, it&rsquo;s because they are fed up with being preyed on by blacks!!! </p>

			<p>There is some good news and bad news on this story:</p>
<p>First, the good news:  This story was carried at another major website where posting is allowed.  A few posters were ahead of me, and their remarks were fairly neutral.  I posted as a white nationalist, and every remark thereafter was made in a similar vein.  In fact, every poster sounded like we do, and the longer the thread became, the more assertive the remarks.</p>
<p>When whites can follow an example of courage, it is evident that most whites agree with us, which leads me to the bad news:</p>
<p>Unless somebody is present to show a little spine, whites are inclined to do little to defend their own interests, even in the face of such a deplorable story as this one.  And without a measure of spontaneous courage, whites will never assert their interests, and leaders willing to defend those rights will not emerge.</p>
<p>It should give all of us heart that our ideas are no longer unspeakable.  But we do have a long way to go to normalize our views.</p>

			<p>I strongly suspect that in a Mexican/White gang alliance against Blacks, the Mexicans will be the more numerous and the senior partners.  Don&rsquo;t blame Whitey for Mexicans not liking Blacks when nobody else does either.   </p>

			<p>Thank God they found a way to blame it on whites.</p>
<p>Blacks killing Mexicans, blame it on whites.</p>
<p>Mexicans killing blacks, blame it on whites.</p>
<p>I think every time a black or Mexican suspect is apprehended, they should be able to name a white person to take their place in prison.  Only then will we see the end of white privilege and white rascism.</p>
<p>I always thought the &#8220;Twilight Zone&#8221; was fiction, boy was I ever wrong. Somebody wake me up when this bad dream is over; this can&rsquo;t be real.</p>

<p>Amanda F. Susskind is certifiable. Even if what she were saying is true, which it isn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s a lie, where is her proof? Heresay, and conjecture won&rsquo;t do the trick. Neo nazi materials won&rsquo;t do the trick either because there never has been proof that that material leads to anything. She is FULL OF IT. Mexicans and blacks have never had any love lost for each other and anyone who has lived in Southern California for any length of time knows it  &mdash;  except apparently Amanda F. Susskind.</p>

<p>You know, this is one group of lies that I don&rsquo;t mind seeing them write about, because by distracting from the real causes of the problems of black and brown racism they&rsquo;re only going to make things worse, which will bring about greater fighting.</p>

Amanda F. Susskind, Pacific Southwest regional director of the Anti-Defamation League in Los Angeles, said hate rhetoric is rising online and is particularly targeting youth, perpetuated in part by as many as 110 white supremacist organizations nationwide.<br>
Latino gangs were forming alliances with white supremacists in prisons to prey on blacks.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that these conflicts are between blacks and Latinos,but despite that, they sure are not going to let whitey off the hook. It&rsquo;s good policy to always blame whitey.  <br>
Based on this thinking, I think we have a suspect on who killed Cock Robin.</p>

			<p>Well, well, well.  Even though whites are no where to be found in LA I knew they would get the blame.  </p>
<p><br>
Wow, 110 white supremacist organizations?</p>
<p>What they don&rsquo;t tell you is that any two white people found discussing racial issues without following the ADL PC guidelines gets labeled a white supremacist hate group.  The Anti-Demfamation League sure does a lot of defaming.  They should be labeled a terrorist smear organization.</p>

One of my now frequently used words is &#8216;obfuscate&rsquo; meaning to confuse and render unclear.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what these articles on &#8216;hate&rsquo; crimes do. They hide the real facts by drawing spurious associations resulting in confusing and unclear conclusions. </p>
<p>An example:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Whites were the leading suspects in religion-based incidents. Overall, blacks made up nearly half the hate crime victims, totaling 310.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>If I read this as I suspect it was meant to be read, I would draw the conclusion that whites are the majority suspects in the hate crimes attacks on blacks because the first sentence leading to the next sentence is linked in the mind of the reader:</p>
<p>Whites are suspects.<br>
Blacks are victims.<br>
Blacks are victims of whites suspects.</p>
<p>Is this the result of poor writing skills or highly deceptive and manipulative writing?</p>

<p>Ahh, for the good &#8216;ole days, when the ADL was complaining that those very same &#8220;white supremacists&#8221; were fomenting hatred toward Hispanic immigrants.</p>

			<p>The ADL says, the ADL? We all know who they are and WHAT they are! They need to be run out of the country and take all their commie organizations with them. THEY are the reason we have our country flooded with 3rd world immigrants. THEY are the reason for anything that is anti-White and anti-Christian. THEY are the reason for &#8220;special protection&#8221; of those groups they listed above, INCLUDING themselves! ONLY Whites are left out of that list, aren&rsquo;t they? Anyone notice this? </p>

<p>Can&rsquo;t help but wonder how many &#8220;religion-based&#8221; crimes there were. My guess is maybe a dozen and they just stuck that in there to make it look like whites are far worse than they are.</p>
<p>Furthermore:</p>
<p>&#8220;110 white supremacist organizations nationwide&#8221;.  I wonder if Amren is counted among them.</p>

			<p>The government counts Hispanic on Black crimes as White on Black crimes. This is done intentionally, so as to build resentment against Whites and to divide the populace even more than it is already divided, and to justify even more fascistic &#8220;hate crime&#8221; laws.<br>

			<p>I am curious as to what the racial background is for these &#8220;Latinos&#8221;.  Are we talking basically white northern mexicans or their mestizo and indian southern neighbours?  As for &#8220;Latin America&#8221;, Argentina and Uruguay have some of the most extreme White supremacist groups in the world.  Makes sense when you consider that most of these &#8220;Latinos&#8221; are Spaniard, Italian, German, Scandinavian, Croatian, and Irish descended people.</p>

			<p>The fact that our conspiratorily criminal federal government continues to keep our borders open to any and all illegal alien traffic has everything to do with these statistics.</p>
<p>California is evolving into a base combination of Juarez and Zimbabwe, and self-elected liberal social experiment enforcers  like Robun Toma and Amanda F. Sisskind dumbly feign surprise when these ignorant sociopaths inevitably act out their natures.  </p>

<p>It would be near impossible prove, but I would tend to disagree with that. I bet if you take the men in the nation and divide them into men who have had sex with other men, and men who haven&rsquo;t, I bet among the gay group there would be a higher likelihood of committing murder. I bet that works for both lesbians and gays, with the &#8216;hatred&rsquo; being even more pronounced among lesbians. In each incident there would be a good possibility the victim would be straight. </p>

<p>No way Jose are they basically white.  Mexicans/mestizos (&#8220;latinos&#8221;) are mostly Indian.  Maybe 5/10 percent of mexico is White.  Of mestizos, they may be 10/20 percent White (Spanish).  Mexico is, taken at a glance, what happens when the injuns are allowed off the reservation.  btw 25 percent of adult mexican males (in USA) are alcoholic.</p>

<p>I am appalled, however, that someone from the ADL would pretend to know so little about blacks and criminal justice so as to pretend that Hispanics and whites are forming alliances in prison to &#8220;prey on blacks&#8221;.  They do so to protect themselves from blacks.  Unlike Susskind, I had the unfortunate privelidge of seeing this firsthand.  Has Susskind forgotten about the Crown Heights riots, in which black mobs targetted Hassidic Jews, murdering one, while New York police stood by and did nothing, or has her hatred of white gentiles convinced her she should ignore incidents like these in order to continue to use black &#8220;victimhood&#8221; as a useful club with which to beat whitey?</p>

			<p>Blacks are often shocked to learn that other cultures dislike and distrust them. They have raised their young to believe Whitey is a racist devil, who is biased against them, regardless of high black crime rates. Learning Hispanics feel the same way astounds them, so they blame it on Whitey again. Doesn&rsquo;t matter what people you are talking about, whites are to blame for anyone disliking them. Never their own bad behavior, and bad reputations. Reputations that are well earned, and well deserved.</p>

			<p>[&ldquo;Latino gangs were forming alliances with white supremacists in prisons to prey on blacks.&rdquo;]</p>
<p>Why does the media ALWAYS make blacks out to be the victim? I&rsquo;m getting so SICK AND TIRED of this and the way they all worship Barack Obama.</p>
<p>Anyone whose been to prison or has a friend or family member that has been to prison knows damn-well that blacks are the ones who prey on others most of the time. If Latins and Whites are forming an alliance, it&rsquo;s because they are fed up with being preyed on by blacks!!! </p>
<p>You actually believed what you just mentioned?? Unbelievable.</p>

<p>This has been said a lot on amren  &mdash;  I&rsquo;m hoping you or someone can provide a link to a gov&rsquo;t document that states this. I post the DOJ link below on MSM sites, and it would be helpful to strengthen its stats even further. (Maybe elsewhere on the DOJ site I can find it, if no one has it handy)</p>

			<p>&#8220;Amanda F. Susskind, Pacific Southwest regional director of the Anti-Defamation League in Los Angeles, said hate rhetoric is rising online and is particularly targeting youth, perpetuated in part by as many as 110 white supremacist organizations nationwide.&#8221;  So, no matter WHO is engaging in &#8220;Hate Crimes&#8221; (in this case Blacks and Hispanics) those awful &#8220;White Supremacists&#8221; are inevitably - and always - to blame according to Comrade Susskind of the VERY &#8216;RACIST&rsquo; and ETHNOCENTRIC HATE ORGANIZATION &#8216;ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Go to the KHOU.COM website (Houston news media). Then go to local inews and read the crime stories. You can jon the blog by becoming a member (painless). Just watch yourself that you don&rsquo;t sound to extremely racist.  Let the Mexicans AND Blacks know you&rsquo;re aware of how much crime is done by the two races.</p>

			<p>It all sounds good. If blacks realize that Latinos are their real enemy and spend their time battling latinos in the schools, in jobs and on the streets, it will only benefit whites. Let the games begin!</p>

Mexico is, taken at a glance, what happens when the injuns are allowed off the reservation. btw 25 percent of adult mexican males (in USA) are alcoholic.</p>
<p>Posted by no way jose at 5:56 PM on July 26 </p>
<p><br>
I have thought the same thing about Mexico: it&rsquo;s what America would be if our pasty-faced wig-wearing forefathers hadn&rsquo;t dealt with the Native situation the way we did. Cruel as it may have been, the rez system was merely a necessary step that permited whites to develop the continent into the European-derived superpower that it is (or at least was). </p>
<p>Had the early Americans NOT done this, we too might have been hobbled in our progress by millions upon millions of injuns and mestizos of limited abilities and ambitions. The British, French, Germans, etc in our country did the difficult thing and corralled the indigenous peoples   &mdash;   and produced America. The Spanish in Mexico, lusty losers that they were, instead encouraged their men to inter-breed with the squaws   &mdash;   and produced Mexico. </p>
<p>(&hellip;Which would be fine if we still had a border. But the same dimwits who messed up Messico are now HERE and making a similar mess of America!) </p>
<p>As for the stat about 1/4 of Mex-American males being alkies, well, I hadn&rsquo;t heard that before   &mdash;   but I&rsquo;m not terribly surprised either. If our injuns aren&rsquo;t real good with alcohol, there&rsquo;s no reason to expect Mexico&rsquo;s would be either. They sure do seem to put away a lot of cerveza   &mdash;   and that&rsquo;s only when they&rsquo;re out of mezcal. And the frighteningly high rates of hispanic drunk-driving violations, crashes and fatalities would only lend support to your data. <br>

			<p>The dirty little secret in California especially in Los Angeles is the turf war between Hispanic gangs and Blacks. This has been going on for many years now but has escalated in recent years. Of course the MSN will never report the racial distinction clearly, making it appear that somehow whites are the root of the problem. </p>

			<p>&#8221;, I bet among the gay group there would be a higher likelihood of committing murder. &#8220;</p>
<p>Right, In the list of the 10 worst serial killers in America, 7, Juan Corona, Wayne Williams, John Wayne Gacy, Jeffrey Dahmer and 3 others were gay.  So that&rsquo;s 70 percent of the worst serial killers were gays who killed men.</p>

<p>Good point. While I&rsquo;m not the one who wrote what you are responding to, I have observed that some things are genetic and that other things are enviromental. Drug addiction, depression, ADD, mental illness, suicide, sexuality, and alcoholism: these things are all genetic. We learn more and more about that everyday. Everything else in this world is caused by an environment created by racist and bigoted white men. </p>

			<p>Black racist africans in our America have killed over 200,000 of us since the MLK marched on DC.  Black african racists have raped and terrorized hundreds of thousands more of the American people.  Isn&rsquo;t it time we non-black folks marched for Civil and Human Rights for the non-black population.  We need to spit in the faces of the racist and genocidal Bolsheviks like the ADL who terrorize white people with their shysteristic tactics.  Power to our people!!!</p>

			<p>I went to high school with Robin Toma who is mentioned in this article. He is involved with the ACLU merely as means to future political office or gain. Of course, this is par for the course with all ACLU, ADL and SPLC types. They carry a grudge against any and all white males, especially those who outperformed them in academics, a hatred of traditional America in general and Western Civilization in particular. Keep these types of people in mind when the ultimate collapse hits the US and a large chunk of the West. </p>

			<p>I love how they said that some of the Latino&rsquo;s were carrying White Supremacist material.</p>
<p>I have noticed Africans and Mestizo`s commenting on this website, so even they know most of their general populations are troublesome. It gives validity to the experiences of everything said here. Very eye opening.</p>

			<p><i>&#8220;&hellip;Can&rsquo;t help but wonder how many &ldquo;religion-based&rdquo; crimes there were. My guess is maybe a dozen and they just stuck that in there to make it look like whites are far worse than they are.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Because in 100% of the cases of &ldquo;religion-based&rdquo; crimes, the perps turn out to be the &#8220;victims&#8221; themselves.<br>

<p>Our Indians are better than Mexico&rsquo;s Indians.  Two of my best friends in lockup were Amerinds, one in for manslaughter, and the other in for murder and mutiny.  The first was Navajo, and the second Jicarilla Apache, with plenty of Spanish in his bloodline.</p>
<p>The second was an Amerind racist.  He didn&rsquo;t like the concept of whites being part Amerind or Amerinds being part white.</p>
