<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>The Rev. Jesse Jackson&rsquo;s offhand insult of Barack Obama last week has exposed a heated debate over whether Obama&rsquo;s groundbreaking presidential campaign &mdash; and his repeated challenge to the black community to straighten out its own affairs &mdash; is displacing and alienating some in Jackson&rsquo;s generation of black leadership, which held the government accountable for the plight of African-Americans.</p>
<p>Though Jackson apologized profusely for the remark, he still faced intense criticism, not least a sharply worded rebuke from his namesake son, who is a congressman and an Obama campaign official. Some in the black community said the clash demonstrates the elder Jackson&rsquo;s resentment at having to make way for a new generation of leaders like Obama, who believe that black America is not blameless for its chronic social problems.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Derrell] Lipscomb [Pentagon City Mall shopper], 18, said Jackson is behind the times: &#8220;He doesn&rsquo;t understand that racism really isn&rsquo;t the main thing right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Several prominent black political figures note that Jackson expressed aloud what some black voters had kept to themselves: a suspicion that Obama&rsquo;s criticism of deadbeat dads and undisciplined households is a play for more-conservative white voters. That part of the debate, they say, has been largely kept quiet to avoid damaging Obama&rsquo;s historic bid for the presidency.</p>
<p>Many believe a public discussion could undermine Obama&rsquo;s support among African-Americans, a constituency he will need behind him at full strength to defeat Republican challenger John McCain. Though black voters turned out for Obama in record numbers during the marathon Democratic primaries, any erosion of that support could mean the difference in battleground states like Georgia and North Carolina.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Unlike Jackson, who marched with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Obama, 46, and the younger Jackson represent &#8220;the new generation which is less confrontational, more willing to compromise [with whites] and play inside the game of politics,&#8221; Haynie said. They see themselves not as activists but as politicians who are elected to solve problems, even if it means adopting moderate or conservative positions.</p>
<p>William Galston of the Brookings Institution, a Washington policy center, said some believe Obama&rsquo;s criticism of the black community has spurred debate because &#8220;every time someone who is not a conservative talks about personal responsibility, he or she is accused of giving aid and comfort to the enemy. It suggests in so many words that the people at issue are not pure victims.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a message liberals and some black people find disturbing, Galston said, because &#8220;it takes white America and privileged America off the hook.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet most blacks would rather keep quiet about their discomfort with that message if it means helping elect the first African-American president.</p>

What the &ldquo;meathead&rdquo; liberals (and conservatives) can&rsquo;t realize is, 99% + blacks will vote for Obama no matter what!</p>
<p>Will vote for him if he talks down to blacks or talks up to Whites.</p>
<p>Will vote for him if he has David Duke as his running mate.  <br>

			<p>I agree with Sissy White, this is their big chance. They won&rsquo;t blow it. And with Republicans infuriated at the Republican Party and turning independent like crazy.. I think the Obamination will come to pass.</p>

<p>Does Obama really believe that black America is not blameless for its problems? Or is he just saying that to appeal to white voters?</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;every time someone who is not a conservative talks about personal responsibility, he or she is accused of giving aid and comfort to the enemy. It suggests in so many words that the people at issue are not pure victims.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Although this is certainly a message that blacks should have heard decades ago, delivering that message will start a ride down a slippery slope. If blacks give whites &#8220;permission&#8221; to talk about blacks as anything other than pure victims, it might (gasp!) actually lead to a semi-honest discussion about race. </p>
<p><i>That&rsquo;s a message liberals and some black people find disturbing, Galston said, because &ldquo;it takes white America and privileged America off the hook.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>This is very dangerous indeed, because once whites are taken even slightly off the hook, it will be very difficult to &#8220;reel them back in.&#8221; If this were to happen, I don&rsquo;t think we would ever again see a spectacle like the fawning over blacks and the self-flagellation by whites that we&rsquo;ve seen since the 1960s.</p>

<p>What are black college students interested in (academically) in your opinion?  I&rsquo;m in college and I haven&rsquo;t found ANY academic subjects that interest them.  I took a class on African Economic Development and the dozen blacks in class would constantly complain about how boring the subject was.  They&rsquo;d perk up for 1 or 2 minutes whenever the Prof mentioned slavery, but then they&rsquo;d go back to dozing or text-messaging; 90% of them skipped the 2nd half of class <i>every day</i> even if the whole period was on slavery - they&rsquo;d walk out of class saying &#8220;this dude&rsquo;s boring&#8221; even though he was one of the most interesting Profs I&rsquo;ve ever had!  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m truly mystified as to how everything can to boring to someone.  These students chose to take an elective class on Africa, presumably because they were interested in the subject, but then every single fact was &#8220;boring&#8221;, every article and book was &#8220;boring&#8221;, every lecture was &#8220;boring&#8221;.  They also knew less about Africa than I knew in grade school.  And yet it was their &#8220;favorite subject&#8221;?  I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like it.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true that young blacks don&rsquo;t care about Jessie Jackson and Al Sharpton; they talk a lot about Rose Parks, MLK and Malcolm X, then skip right to modern rappers and movie stars.  Standard &#8220;Black History&#8221; is &#8220;boring&#8221; to them once the Black Panthers left the scene.  </p>
<p>When Jessie Jackson starts talking, I guarantee that my former black classmates roll their eyes and pronounce him &#8220;boring&#8221;.  </p>

			<p>This story fantasizes that the &#8220;Black Community&#8221; is objective. Sissy White is absolutely correct. In the &#8220;Black Community&#8221; racial solidarity trumps EVERYTHING else. </p>

			<p>New Orleans could of voted out their black mayor who failed the test with Katrina. Yet they re-elected him, instead of his white opponent. Did race play a factor? Or are blacks okay with poor leadership as long as he is black?</p>

<p>If there were to be a poll conducted amongst white youth in america I suspect the following would be true.. many young white americans have: 1.) practically no idea about white history; 2.) couldn&rsquo;t give a damn about it; and 3.) consider people like Jesse Jackson to be old-school geezers. </p>
<p>the infection that plagues american youth today is the constant bombardment of entertainment from (MTV to video games) This is not without design as suggested by zetigeistmovie..  society is being lulled into an intellectual sleep as a thirst for knowledge and wisdom is being replaced by instant gratification of the senses propagated by modern media. </p>
<p>I was engaged in both european and african history in university and found that many of my white colleagues found european and us history to be boring and irrelevant to modern times several of whom stopped showing up after 2 or three sessions. </p>
<p>In my formal education I was presented with images of black people within the industries of sports and entertainment but what about a history that is rarely addressed such as st. maurice patron saint to the holy roman emperors. </p>
<p>How about a paradigm that focuses upon an all inclusive American history that is impartial to black or white. Both peoples built this great nation and as globalization continues on its steady march Americans will face the onslaught of students from around the world who know more about our history than we do. </p>

			<p>Many young people are surprisingly blase and/or ignorant of historical facts. It&rsquo;s perhaps more remarkable concerning African-American students when one considers the supposed and constant moral outrage that figuratively, and perhaps literally FUELS white guilt and the stream of entitlement money issuing forth.</p>

			<p>A black friend of mine said that she worried that if Obama was elected, he would be assassinated.  LIke a lot of blacks she fears the conspiracy of some vast racist white right wing group who might be out to eliminate him.  I reflected afterward that with the black power structure in the nation being what it is, with the Jacksons and the Sharptons and even Farrakhan having hijacked &#8220;black&#8221;  and using their position to lecture to others about what black is and isn&rsquo;t and who is racist, then really if anyone has an interest in assassinating Obama, is could well be these sort of black leaders who stand the most to lose. If Obama is elected, there&rsquo;s now a black person in high position who isn&rsquo;t (yet, at least!) interested in a bunch of black whining and finger-pointing, finding white racism everywhere.  This could do serious damage to the Jacksons, Sharptons, Farrakhans, Reverend Wrights because it will help reveal what complete nonsense they are.   </p>

Evidently they expected to be entertained rather than educated. <br>
So what were they doing there?    <br>
Answer:  They were there to get diplomas, that&rsquo;s what, not educations.</p>
