						<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A total of 3,942 illegal immigrants were deported from Florida between January and June of 2007, while that number jumped to 5,889 over the same time period this year.</p>
<p>Authorities said 1,251 of that number faced charges such as aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, kidnapping, money laundering, sex offenses and drug charges, according to the Associated Press.</p>
<p>ICE attributes part of its success in identifying illegal immigrants to a program targeting inmates in federal, state and local custody. The program started in June of 2007.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;How it works is we send our local ICE representative a 24-hour log of every foreign-born person that comes into the Highlands County jail,&#8221; Benton said. &#8220;ICE runs that information through their computer systems and anyone who is not legally documented in this country .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they come over and interview the inmates and decide whether or not to put a detainer on them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Every foreign-born inmate booked into the Highlands County Jail has their name run through the ICE computer systems.</p>
<p>&#8220;They even run people that have papers,&#8221; said Tracy Ferrante, a detention support officer who sometimes works with ICE.</p>
<p>The next step, the interview, usually takes three to five minutes.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first question they typically ask is &lsquo;are you here legally,&rsquo; and usually they&rsquo;re honest,&#8221; Detention Support Officer Denise Morales said. &#8220;Most of them will say from the beginning they are illegal. It&rsquo;s not to their benefit to go to the trouble to (lie) .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. unless they&rsquo;re trying to hide something.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Most of the time detainers are placed on inmates immediately after ICE finds out they are in the country illegally.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Two-thirds of foreign born inmates that make it to the interview process were detained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once they put on a detainer &mdash; say they are in the jail for petty theft &mdash; once they get their case finished and are able to be released from our jail, they take them to the ICE office,&#8221; Benton said.<br>

<p>It&rsquo;s what Benton possibly didn&rsquo;t say that is troubling. &#8220;Whereupon a water head immigration judge paroles half of them and gives them an immigration court date.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Every foreign born suspect gets checked by ICE.&#8221; </p>
<p>Aha,yeah,go on. This would only be deemed strange or even offensive, etc. by your typical demented &#8220;progressive&#8221; or Democratic politician. I can&rsquo;t think of any other group this would bother.</p>

			<p>In San Fransicko, because of our sanctuary policy in regards to illegal aliens,illegals who do violent felonies are not brought to the attention of the Feds.One such punk did a robbery, a beating of a young man for not being in a gang, and he eventually ended up shooting to death a father and two of his teenage sons.</p>

			<p>Similar things happen in Chicago, also a &#8220;Sanctuary City&#8221;, where the bonehead mayor can&rsquo;t differentiate between immigrant and illegal alien.<br>
 The leftie Chicago media doesn&rsquo;t report on these tragedies.<br>
My heart goes out to the woman who lost her whole family in a matter of moments thanks to the idiotic policy of mayors like Newsom and Daley.<br>
If they have such disdain for Federal Law, the gov&rsquo;t should actually (not just threaten) remove ALL Federal funding.</p>
