						<p>Two schoolboys were allegedly disciplined after refusing to kneel down and &#8220;pray to Allah&#8221; during a religious education lesson.</p>
<p>It was claimed that the boys, from a year seven class of 11 and 12-year-olds, were given detention after refusing to take part in a practical demonstration of how Allah is worshipped.</p>
<p>Yesterday parents accused the school of breaching their human rights by forcing them to take part in the exercise.</p>
<p>One, Sharon Luinen, said: &#8220;This isn&rsquo;t right, it&rsquo;s taking things too far. I understand that they have to learn about other religions. I can live with that but it is taking it a step too far to be punished because they wouldn&rsquo;t join in Muslim prayer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Making them pray to Allah, who isn&rsquo;t who they worship, is wrong and what got me is that they were told they were being disrespectful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another parent Karen Williams, 38, whose 12-year-old daughter is a classmate of the boys, said: &#8220;I am absolutely furious my daughter was made to take part in it and I don&rsquo;t find it acceptable.</p>
<p>&#8220;The teacher had gone into the class and made them watch a short film and then said &lsquo;we are now going out to pray to Allah&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then two boys got detention and all the other children missed their refreshments&rsquo; break.&#8221;</p>
<p>She added: &#8220;Not only was it forced upon them, my daughter was told off for not doing it right.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;d never done it before and they were supposed to do it in another language.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said the pupils were asked if they had water on them, and when one girl produced a bottle, the teacher began washing her feet with it.</p>
<p>Her husband Keith, 44, a painter and decorator, said: &#8220;The school is wonderful but this one teacher has made a major mistake. It seems to be happening throughout society. People think they can ride roughshod over our beliefs and the way we live.&#8221;</p>
<p>The alleged incident, at the Alsager school, one of Cheshire&rsquo;s top performing schools, happened on Tuesday afternoon. The teacher, Alison Phillips, the school&rsquo;s subject leader in RE, is understood to be staying away from the school until the furore dies down, although she has not been suspended.</p>
<p>She is said to have got prayer mats out of the cupboard and also asked children to wear Islamic headdresses.</p>
<p>Deputy headmaster Keith Plant said: &#8220;I have spoken to the teacher and she has articulately given me her version of events.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sources at the school said the incident could have been down to Miss Phillips instigating a role play and not properly briefing the pupils, all aged around 12, what she was doing.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Cheshire County Council said they were investigating. He added: &#8220;The headteacher contacted the authority immediately complaints were received. Enquiries are being made into the circumstances as a matter of urgency and all parents will be informed accordingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Educating children in the beliefs of different faiths is part of Cheshire&rsquo;s diversity curriculum on the basis that knowledge is, of course, is essential to understanding.</p>
<p>&#8220;We accept that such teaching has to be conducted with commonsense and sensitivity.&#8221;<br>

			<p>International Humanitarian Law says that forcing someone to breach their own religious faith - for any reason - is a crime against humanity.</p>
<p>The gods I believe in would never prohibit alcohol or pork.  As Ben Franklin once said, &#8220;Beer is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy.&#8221;  I would amend that to include apple-lemon cider, lime cider, honey mead, white grape pyment, and so-on.</p>
<p>The gods I believe in would also never tolerate me praying to another.</p>
<p>This article reminds me all over again how much I love the British, and how much I hate Britain.  If a child of mine did that someday in sixth grade, I would probably die of pride on hearing about it.</p>

<p>The parents of these boys should immediately yank them from the school and home-teach them.</p>

			<p>It just shows that the so-called &#8220;tolerance&#8221; is a one way street.</p>
<p>It takes a moron to believe that preaching &#8220;tolerance&#8221; in Western schools is a fair effort to make all peoples and their cultures and religions equally appreciated. Double standard and duplicity are at the very foundation of it.<br>

<p>Not been suspended? Had this been a teacher in America teaching of Christianity she would have been fired, skewered in the press, lawsuits filed and barred from teaching again for life. And this woman wasnt even suspended? Probably being paid during her absense as well. </p>

			<p>Part of the &#8216;diversity curriculum&rsquo;? So this need overrides the individual&rsquo;s sovereign choice in matters of religion? I suppose the school masters should assign inter-racial sexual activities as part of sex ed as well? This &#8216;diversity&rsquo; cult is nothing short of a religion enforced by the state.</p>

Why can&rsquo;t tolerance extend to this young boy? Can&rsquo;t they tolerate his choice? By not tolerating his actions, they have disrespected his right to make choices for himself. Everyone raves about teaching children to think independently only they don&rsquo;t want them to think and act independently. Is it any wonder some of these kids flip out?</p>
<p>I hope he takes these lessons into adulthood. This intolerance, disrespect, and humiliation might cause him to be a leader of white men.</p>

			<p>Ridiculous! This teacher will claim that in his/her culture &hellip;blah..blah..blah. I doubt the teacher will be reprimanded justly&hellip;.(How disgusting!)</p>
<p>The burning a cross into a studen&rsquo;t skin in Ohio is not acceptable, if this is what truly happened. I think the teacher should be able to have his Bible at school and read it on his own time. He should be able to speak of his faith one-on-one within the school to anyone who is interested, outside of class time.  </p>
<p>In a Buddhism course in college, we were suppossed to put our palms together in prayer and bow our heads for meditation or something. I guess I was kinda looking around. The instructor, from Brown University, called me out by name and told me to close my eyes. I looked out the window. It was not a big deal. But, I made it clear that I wasn&rsquo;t going to participate. (But, this was in Georgia and I was an adult.)</p>

			<p>What ever happened to the separation of church and state? My tax money goes towards funding a public school that is supposed to teach my children how to read. I will teach them how to pray at home, and NOT to Allah, thank you very much! <br>
This is obviously actionable in a court of law. I hope everyone involved is sued to the fullest extent possible, with enough added financial penalties to label it an example. <br>
In fact, this teacher likes Islam so much, don&rsquo;t they give lashes in public? Wonder how she&rsquo;d like that? (I&rsquo;d pay good money to watch!)</p>

<p>The last time I visited Crewe (my Mom&rsquo;s hometown) and Nantwich (my Dad&rsquo;s hometown)it was all white and very British.  Such pretty villages throughout northern England with vibrant shops, cozy corner pubs, cobblestone streets and the lovely green countryside&hellip;  It was all so quaint&hellip;  It was all so English!</p>

			<p>Spiness liberals teach in our schools anymore. They espouse multi-culturalism &amp; tolerance to the student body. Same thing goes on in our other cherished social institutions. This is prime example why so many younger white people have voted for the obama creature. They have been brain washed and forgotten their proud white history. In the 20th century whites were landing on the moon, making unheard medical &amp; scientific discoveries. On the other hand, blacks were carrying about nothing but murder and destruction throughout the world. I am very happy in my whiteness and have no guilt feelings at all.</p>

			<p>Hey, Lydia  <br>
Good one!  I think I&rsquo;m inspired- how about forcing all the students to say the &#8220;Hail Mary&#8221; over a hot dog barbeque?   At a co-ed pool-party?   That oughta &#8220;diversify&#8221; the activities of a broad spectrum of students. </p>
<p>And what was the legal drinking age-limit (there must have been a time without one) in medieval Europe?  Perhaps in a nod to that heritage, every child over 14 should also be treated to a mug of honeymead! </p>
<p>Really, I can&rsquo;t expect my serious feelings about this to be printable.  Also, it is good to think before speaking, rather than letting emotion take control of one&rsquo;s words. </p>
<p>Though damn near speechless (with outrage), I can offer this: This is indeed very disturbing.  </p>
<p>Then again, education about islam is indeed sorely lacking in the west.  People should- need to!- know the truth.   Just how much of the horror that islam has visited upon humanity should be revealed to children is a matter requiring careful consideration.  </p>
<p>Adults, please check out <a href="http://www.thereligionofpeace.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thereligionofpeace.com/</a>, which is dedicated to just that.  There are many excellent links as well, so anyone online can learn quite a lot about islam; what it is, its role in history and current events, and its aim for the future. </p>
<p>This article is one more case in point- you, your family, and your society are what islam is aiming at.  </p>

			<p>Pray to Allah? I&rsquo;m not religious and I find this offensive. Teach kids world religion, show them how different people pray and worship but don&rsquo;t force them to participate in any religious behavior. Religious worship is a private affair!! Unless you are breaking the law, ie child brides, polygamy, honor killings, whippings, etc&hellip;, it is a private activity. Disgusting. I will lay down my life for freedom of religion but am willing to fight anyone who pushes their religion down my throat. Christians, Muslims, anyone&hellip;  Private and private, no special consideration for any freakin religion.</p>

			<p>Note the cognitive dissonance (or hypocrisy) of the father of one of the victims: <i>&#8220;The school is wonderful but this one teacher has made a major mistake.&#8221;</i> As if this &#8220;mistake&#8221; had been made in a vacuum, or the teacher even considers it a &#8220;mistake&#8221; at all. Like all enablers of evil, the school administrators are backpedaling only because they and their agent were caught red-handed. Therefore, there is nothing &#8220;wonderful&#8221; about this school at all. If it is considered &#8220;top-performing,&#8221; the bottom-of-the-barrel schools must be on a par with the typical black American schools.</p>
<p>Soprano Fan wrote: <i>The parents of these boys should immediately yank them from the school and home-teach them.</i></p>
<p>Fat chance, even if the parents weren&rsquo;t flaming hypocrites. Homeschooling has been outlawed in Germany under a Nazi-era statute that was never repealed. Expect that cancer to metastasize across Europe in the near future.</p>

<p>The Muslims also do public hangings and beheadings, I would pay good money to see that done to these types. I pointed out that the sentence for preaching the gospel on the street in Kuwait is 20 years in prison, not sure what it is in Saudi, but my guess would be public beheading!! how&rsquo;s that for religion of tolerance and peace. Maybe we should try that on all of the idiot IMAMs in the U.S. and U.K. </p>

			<p>   I don&rsquo;t expect this to be posted, but I have got to say it. Allah and his followers can kiss my ass. My patience with those backward people have come to an end. Go to Hell and take that false god with you. Allah and mohameed are fake. No British child should ever be made to pray to that false religion. Brits must rise up now and rid themselves of the disease of islam and its followers. exterminate them if you must. revolt, that is the only way to save the U.K.</p>

<p>These two lads must be the last two men left in England. </p>
<p>Expecting a Free Man to kneel and recite allegiance to the sworn enemies of freedom? Far beyond the pale of what any free individual has ever been expected to bear, without someone suffering the lethal consequences such a demand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope he takes these lessons into adulthood. This intolerance, disrespect, and humiliation might cause him to be a leader of white men.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Get the existing Muslims out of the UK, and don&rsquo;t let any more known Muslims in.  Otherwise, they will continue becoming more numerous, more arrogant, even less willing to assimilate.  They always resort more to intimidation &amp; threats as they gain numbers in non-Muslim countries.  </p>
<p>It is only to be expected that self-hating white fools like the teacher in this article will cave in to the pressure to be fashionably multicultural.  But the pressure runs only in one direction.  Muslims would demonstrate and possibly become violent if we asked their children to perform a Christian prayer or ritual.  In the long run, we end up dominated by Islam and oppressed or killed in our own countries.  This is just the beginning.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m sure that in its efforts to seperate church and state, the school has banned christmas trees, parties and decorations and now calls the christmas vacation &#8220;winter break&#8221;</p>
<p>I have detested the feminazis since they first swarmed out of the communist party in the sixties.  What I really fail to understand is exactly why a marxist atheist feminazi would support Islam.  Are they crazy???  Islam goes against everything the feminazis stand for.</p>
<p>I keep forgetting that liberalism is a mental disease.  I should think of their pronouncements as no more valid than that of the mentally ill homeless guy who rants and raves in front of my local McDonald&rsquo;s every morning</p>

			<p>Will the school sponsor a passover dinner so the kids can experience the founding myths of Judiasm?  How about bringing a priest in to say mass, hear confessions and give them communion????  Or make a video of one of those black American protestant preachers on TV and make them watch it.  ( Bishop Patterson of Tennessee is great, one of those old time preacher voices).</p>
<p><br>
Why stick to Islam except to prepare the kids for the Islamic takeover.  This is similiar to Obama&rsquo;s recent announcement that all American children should learn Spanish.</p>

			<p>Everyone should email the school board and tell them how you feel about this. This really is a major step to completely destroying European identity. People have become so blind to the assault on our heritage, it is so sad.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Why not compel the little muslim childen to pet and play with dogs, in an effort to demonstrate the wonders of Diversity? Or would that be going too far?&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
How ignorant and hateful can you be? That would be inciting racial hatred, how racist. Only whites can be enriched by non-whites. <br>

			<p>Can you imagine if the Brits, say, in the 30s and 40s had it a part of their cirriculum to be pro-nazi, pro-german, and then reparmanded their brits for not following along?  Brits, get your sanity back!</p>

			<p>The truth is that the multi-culturalist traitors are breeding an ultra-nationalist, foreign hating white race. When these white kids grow up and look around them at what these monsterous individuals have done with their supposed heritage, and they have to compete with large groups of dark skinned individuals for employment, women, and political power, the rage will erupt slowly but surely. The future that the elitists are insuring is global war and there is no escaping it. We have gone too far down the road to perdition. There is absolutely no possibility that things can continue the way they are. </p>

			<p>&#8220;The teacher, Alison Phillips, the school&rsquo;s subject leader in RE, is understood to be staying away from the school until the furore dies down, although she has not been suspended.&#8221;</p>
<p>Typical cowardly liberal. Alison Phillips and all who support her should be stripped of their citizenship and deported to an Islamic country. There they can experience &#8220;diversity&#8221; in all its glory, such as female circumcision.</p>

			<p>I won&rsquo;t get started venting my anger on this forum, since I might not know when to stop.  Suffice it to say that it&rsquo;s sad to see this happening to England.   The points made above about what would happen to one of us here in the USA if we were pushing Christianity in the schools the way Phillips is pushing Islam are well taken.  I&rsquo;m a Christian, and I don&rsquo;t even like having Christianity pushed down my throat, as strange as such a statement may seem.  Clearly then, I don&rsquo;t want other religions crammed down my throat.  The best Christians are those who don&rsquo;t tell you what fine Christians they are.  The others always make certain they tell you what fine people they are, that they know they&rsquo;re going to Heaven, and if you don&rsquo;t mend your ways, you&rsquo;re going straight to hell.  If I were to permit myself to care enough to give a damn, I could really worry about the world today.</p>

<p> BANG ON Kirsten. You are dead on. If SHE TRULY BELIEVED what she had been doing was right, why wouldn&rsquo;t she be vigourously defending herself against her detractors? I guess dealing with adults instead of children is a totally different ballgame. </p>
