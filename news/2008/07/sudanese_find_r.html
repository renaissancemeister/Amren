<h1>Sudanese Find Refuge, Jobs in Anchorage</h1>
					<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Elizabeth Bluemink, Anchorage Daily News, July 27, 2008</i></p>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The word is spreading on the grapevine in the Lower 48 that Anchorage is a place where the refugees can find work.</p>
<p>Rebecca Kuon, a mother who fled pregnant from her village in southern Sudan after civil war broke out in the 1980s, arrived in Anchorage last year.</p>
<p>She washes dishes at a local hospital and hopes to start a second job soon.</p>
<p>Tor Gach, one of the first Sudanese refugees to move to Anchorage in 2006, has a college degree from the Lower 48. Now he&rsquo;s working on the North Slope.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In just two years, the Sudanese population in Anchorage has blossomed &mdash; from a few who arrived in 2006 to a vibrant community now estimated at 600.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A new nonprofit, the South Sudanese American Community Association, is modeled after similar nonprofits that have been established by Sudanese refugees in the Lower 48.</p>

			<p>It will be interesting to see what excuses the leftists make for them when, in a few years, their crime rate blossoms too.  When rapes, AIDS, muggings, beatings, burglaries and drug use increase in Anchorage the powers that be will do everything in their power to hide the link between those trends and Sudanese refugees.  If Alaskans are lucky, the Sudanese will leave because of the cold.  There is no doubt that, even if they do leave, there will be white women carrying their babies left behind.</p>

			<p>Why do these &#8216;refugees&rsquo; from equatorial Africa (Sudan, Somalia, etc.) always head to cooler climates way up north, as opposed to sub-tropical or warm temperate climates? In Europe, they seem to prefer Scandinavia over the south. In America, they abandoned balmy Atlanta to relocate en masse to Maine, and they&rsquo;re heavily concentrated in Minnesota too. They&rsquo;re in Canada as well. I guess I would assume that those sorts of people would prefer to live in warmer climatic regions. Or is there something else behind all this that I don&rsquo;t know of?</p>

			<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t doubt they appear to be thriving. I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s an army of white angles doing everything for them.</p>
<p>Blacks everywhere need extra attention in order to appear to be doing as good as whites who are left to fend for themselves and generally do well on their own.</p>
<p>Once the novelty wears off and the population grows into a noticeable problem and a drain on people and resources, a few white people will wonder why those before them thought this was a good idea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too bad people can&rsquo;t learn from the integration experiences of others. Each new and naive white community foolishly believe integration failed for others because the others were racists or didn&rsquo;t try hard enough. Since they&rsquo;re not racists and they&rsquo;re going do their best, this time it&rsquo;s going to work. And on and on and on until each white community is undermined or destroyed.<br>

			<p>&#8220;I have interviews everyday,&#8221; said Rith Jal, who moved to Anchorage last year after working as a janitor and machine operator in Minnesota. So far he has gotten no call backs.</p>
<p>It would appear that Anchorage is the promised land for the Sudanese. Leave Minnesota where he has a job and go to Alaska where no one wants to hire him.</p>
<p>Africans need to understand that it&rsquo;s normally done the other way around. Then again Alaska probably has a good government assistance program. For some reason blacks love to look for work they just hate to find it. </p>

<p>Ah yes, there is that word again, &#8220;vibrant&#8221;. Yes, white communities and native american ones are just too boring, we need vibrancy. In a few years, vibrant will come to mean crime, crack houses, shootings and the like. Have to liven things up, don&rsquo;t we. We can&rsquo;t allow &#8220;boring&#8221; white people or native americans to just live their lives can we.</p>

			<p>LOL!</p>
<p>Somalis in Maine and now Sudanese in Alaska.  I&rsquo;ve been to both areas and I can tell you that the Winters are more than brutal.  They&rsquo;re treacherous even for us honkies whose genes equip us for cold weather.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve endured both areas so far, but I don&rsquo;t look for it to last.  They&rsquo;ll not only get tired of the sub-freezing temps, but it&rsquo;s entirely possible they could have multiple cases of frost bite among them since black skin is many times more prone to frostbite than white skin.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how that migration unfolds.</p>

			<p>Wonder if author, Elizabeth Bluemink, is a graduate of the old U.S.S.R. Propaganda Ministry and Public [Mis]Education Institute. Now WHY would anyone doubt transplanted Sudanese are going to do absolutely great in Anchorage   &mdash;   without constant help from stupid White- do-gooder types. This story is about as believable as an Obama campaign speech. (Obama needs to take a history refresher course, judging from some of his recent gaffes.)</p>
<p>Give Alaska about five years (assuming the Sudanese survive that long). Then take another look at the Alaskan violent crime stats. Comparing the curve to BEFORE and AFTER the Africans arrived.</p>

<p>I think it has something to do with the welfare systems and the fact that many warmer climates already have a larger number of non-white migrants competing for welfare. In warmer climates like Atlanta, they already have many blacks as well as other migrants. There is a much greater strain on the welfare system there so they cannot be  as generous because more people use it. </p>

<p>Because where there are white people, the standard of living is high; the Northern climates have more white people.  Sadly, the standard of living will drop as more Africans invade.  Is there any place where we can live in peace?</p>

<p>My theory is that northerners by nature are more socialistic due to the winter hardships.  Cooperation and forward planning is essential.  Of course this is largely alien to our hunter gatherer friends who are taking full advantage of our generosity.</p>

<p>&gt; I agree with the annonymous reply @7:51, but add this;  There are elements of from some of the other posts here that apply as well.  Scandinavians have a high boredom rate.  Sweden has long had a surprising suicide rate, hard drug culture, high rate of alcoholism, etc., surprising - you might think - for a country with a &#8220;cradle to grave&#8221; welfare system.  Sweden made jazz their national music in the 1960s - what does that say about cultural suicide?  But all of Scandinavia tends to be naive from their dominant Lutheran Protestant Chrisianity as well.  Scandinavia has always been isolated from the larger reality of Europe.  The Netherlands of course, are another example of the goodness of kindhearted Christian White people gone terribly wrong.  It is such a tangle - can of worms - so deeply seated - it is doubtful that people will be able save themselves.  We only need to look at NL to see how they have &#8220;painted themselves into a corner&#8221; so to speak.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Italy is starting to do something about their problem, but they have a long history of dealing with problematic immigrants.  It will be interesting to see how far Italy can go in active self-protection while Karadzic is at The Hague.</p>

<p>Every gets around $1000.  Times it by a family of 6 - $6,000 a year extra.  Plus food stamps, housing vouchers, and a WAY higher than average minimum wage, I am shocked that immigrants didn&rsquo;t figure this out before.  </p>

<p>   I think your right. In addition, the whiter states are really nicer and generally safer than the more diverse states. Many of the whites in New England and Alaska have had little personal experience with African people, and are not &#8220;prejudiced&#8221;  &mdash;   some would say &#8220;experienced.&#8221;</p>

			<p>After reading the original article, the posts down below are from people in Alaska and are NOT very happy about this either. They are already complaining. I can&rsquo;t blame them either. Their tax dollars are now going to teach the children of these Africans English and the citizens are ticked - rightfully so. </p>
<p>However, the government relocates these refugees and YES the loony liberals make sure they relocate them in a white state – Alaska (or a white community) would be it. Get it? Concur and Divide. Can&rsquo;t have an area or state that is too white because we white people would kick the liberals out for good and/or do what our Founding Fathers did.</p>

They&rsquo;ve been there for some years now, and i&rsquo;m sure the Alaskans know what&rsquo;s in store for them if immigration keeps up.</p>

			<p>The Alaska Permanent Fund is not &#8220;the dole&#8221; as one writer put it.  It is written into the State Constitution that the citizens reap the benefits of the taxation of the state&rsquo;s abundant natural resources.  It&rsquo;s to keep State Gov&rsquo;t. in check; it is NOT &#8220;the dole.&#8221;<br>
If you think (like the above poster) that a family of six getting $6000 a year is a great thing, try living there and raising a family of six with the prices as high as they are!  <br>
It is NOT a time to go &#8220;whee!! free money!&#8221;  It&rsquo;s time to get the kids some boots or winter coats!  Or pay for the home school books so you don&rsquo;t have to send them off to the multi-racial public &#8220;school.&#8221;<br>
I lived there for 20 years.  I speak from first hand experience.  <br>

<p>Since I wrote this, I am going to respond to you only with this:  I am from Alaska.  I grew up there.  I had a huge savings account when I left home from the PFD.</p>
<p>To an immigrant with with a big family, in spite of the cost of living, the PFD and the wages in Alaska is extremely high.  It is most certainly NOT the &#8220;dole,&#8221; however.  I think every state should treat its people as good as Alaska does.  </p>
<p>My family was middle class, and yet we always either saved out PFD money or took a nice X mas vacation with it.  You will get by in Alaska just fine without it.  </p>
