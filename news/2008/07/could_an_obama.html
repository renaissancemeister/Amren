<p>But there are others who warn that an Obama presidency could hurt African-Americans. They say an Obama victory could cause white Americans to ignore entrenched racial divisions while claiming that America has reached the racial Promised Land.</p>
<p>Paul Street, author of the forthcoming book &#8220;Barack Obama and the Future of American Politics,&#8221; says Obama risks becoming an Oval Office version of talk-show host Oprah Winfrey. She and former Secretary of State Colin Powell are African-American figures whose popularity allows some white Americans to congratulate themselves for not being racist, he says</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;re cited as proof that racism is no longer a significant barrier to black advancement and interracial equality,&#8221; Street said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;However, the suggestion that somehow Senator Obama&rsquo;s campaign represents an easy shortcut is not realistic,&#8221; Shapiro [Nick Shapiro,an Obama spokesman] said in a statement. &#8220;Senator Obama believes that we still have a lot of work to do, and that&rsquo;s not just true for the issues facing blacks or Latinos, but for women and other communities struggling to secure the basic necessities in life like jobs, housing, health care and quality education.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Any suggestion that an Obama presidential victory could set back race relations may seem odd or even inappropriate. His presidential campaign has been framed by many observers as a glowing example of America&rsquo;s move to a &#8220;post-racial&#8221; society.</p>
<p>&#8220;Racial polarization used to be a dominating force in our politics, but we&rsquo;re now a different, and better, country,&#8221; Paul Krugman, a New York Times columnist, wrote last month about Obama&rsquo;s political rise.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Yet there are a few political commentators who warn African-Americans that an Obama victory could be twisted to suppress the push for racial equality. Most of these commentators are African-American, but they also include white, Latino and conservative pundits.</p>
<p>These commentators say that there is a subliminal appeal to Obama&rsquo;s presidential candidacy that has been ignored. Obama doesn&rsquo;t just represent change; he represents atonement for America&rsquo;s ugly racial past for others, they say.</p>
<p>Steve Sailer, a columnist for The American Conservative magazine, wrote last year that some whites who support Obama aren&rsquo;t driven primarily by a desire for change.</p>
<p>They want something else Obama offers them: &#8220;White Guilt Repellent,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;So many whites want to be able to say, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not one of them, those bad whites.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nsbp;. Hey, I voted for a black guy for president,&rsquo;&#8221; Sailer wrote.</p>
<p>Sailer cited another reason why many whites want Obama as president:</p>
<p>&#8220;They hope that when a black finally moves into the White House, it will prove to African-Americans, once and for all, that white animus isn&rsquo;t the cause of their troubles. All blacks have to do is to act like President Obama &mdash; and their problems will be over.&#8221;</p>
<p>Glen Ford, executive editor of the online journal blackagendareport.com, offered some white Americans a free solution to the race problem: &#8220;Millions of whites came to believe Obama could solve the &lsquo;race problem&rsquo; by his mere presence, at no cost to their own notions of skin privilege,&#8221; Ford wrote in an essay in January.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It could actually get worse for poor African-Americans, [Andra Gillespie, an assistant professor at Emory University&rsquo;s political science department] says.</p>
<p>&#8220;People could say if Barack [Obama] can succeed and someone can&rsquo;t get off of the stoops in the hood, it&rsquo;s their fault, and it has nothing to do with systemic racism,&#8221; Gillespie said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama has responded to such criticisms before. In his &#8220;A More Perfect Union&#8221; speech in March, he dismissed claims that his candidacy was fueled by the desire &#8220;to purchase racial reconciliation on the cheap.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Despite what Obama has said, his presidency could provoke a black backlash because the expectations are so high, others say.</p>
<p>African-Americans who would expect a President Obama to be a vigorous advocate for their cause may be disappointed by Obama&rsquo;s approach to race if he becomes president, some say.</p>
<p>Author Street says Obama may be a symbol of bold racial change but he is personally cautious about race. A President Obama won&rsquo;t want to appear to favor blacks, because he might lose political support if he appears as the &#8220;angry black man&#8221; in the White House.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>African-Americans may also be disappointed by an Obama presidency because they may have forgotten what Obama is: a politician, says David Sirota, author of &#8220;The Uprising,&#8221; a book that examines how populist movements in America shape public policy changes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Politicians, even the best-intentioned ones, are weather vanes,&#8221; Sirota said. &#8220;If the wind isn&rsquo;t blowing in the right direction, they will perpetuate the status quo.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Whites can&rsquo;t win no matter what happens, that&rsquo;s the point.  The entire issue of race and racism has gone so far beyond the realms of reason that even the long alleged cure is suspect.  </p>

			<p>In a rather perverse way at times I am hoping that Barack Hussein Obama will become our 44th President, if only to see the dismay of those masochistic white men who contributed millions and millions of dollars to his war chest in the hopes of managing him once he enters the oval office, or have his ear whilst in office, or even just hoping he&rsquo;ll be grateful for all their work on his behalf.  If the past is any indication of the future, they&rsquo;ll be in for a hell of a surprise.</p>
<p>Also, I can&rsquo;t resist the specter of Michelle Obama in the White House.  She&rsquo;ll make their wives crawl and eat humble pie.  It&rsquo;ll be a blast.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a black finger on the button?</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do with &#8220;systemic racism&#8221; or any other nonsense made up by white liberals and blacks to explain black failure.  When it comes down to it, it absoulutlely is the &#8220;stoop sitter&rsquo;s&#8221; fault and no one else.  There has never been another group of people in the history of the world that is so adept at making excuses for failure than American blacks and their white apologists. </p>

			<p>I have, sadly, come to the conclusion that it won&rsquo;t matter who&rsquo;s elected.  The 2nd American Revolution is an unstoppable freight train. The American taxpayers will throw up their hands and say &#8220;Whoa, enough&#8221;! And the revolt begins and it&rsquo;s gonna get wierd and nasty.<br>

This article mirrors much of what I have written before (so much so, I have to wonder if the writer reads this board).</p>
<p>Blacks have high expectations for black leaders. They believe that once their man is in office, their lot in life will change over night (or at least is should). When their condition doesn&rsquo;t change dramatically in a short period of time, they turn on their golden boy for being a sellout to the real white men in power behind the scene.</p>
<p>Yes, &#8216;racism&rsquo; must never be allowed to fad away. This all encompassing &#8216;get out of jail free&rsquo; card and universal excuse and justification for black failure must remain front and center for blacks to use at the drop of a hat. Damn the facts. Damn reality.</p>
<p>The dream of a race-less Promise Land must always remain an unreachable dream to strive for so white people can be put in their place when needed.</p>

			<p>Lol&hellip;..the Obama campaign is a strong indicator that the US is marching steadily towards civil war.  If he gets elected, the process will become accelerated.  The likely result of such a war will be the extermination of all blacks in our country.  For an exhaustive and rather disturbing analysis, see the book, Civil War II.  Several websites make it available in .pdf format easily found by googling it.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;d say yeah&hellip;..an Obama campaign would hurt blacks.</p>

<p>I have to disagree 100 percent. Blacks seem to have an infinite tolerance for ineptitude, and incompetence as long as one of their own is in charge. Look at Marion Barry, look at Kwame Killpatrick, look at the dozens of African Presidents for Life  &mdash;  they really don&rsquo;t care what you do once you get to power as long as you live large, and don&rsquo;t give up your seat to a white man. </p>

			<p>an Obama presidency would simply represent one more give away to blacks who will never be satisfied; they will never be satisfied because they will never as a group attain the same level of achievement as whites, not due to &#8220;systematic racism&#8221;, but simply due to their low mean cognitive ability;  those who are waiting for the day when blacks and whites will be equal are waiting for a day that will never come; full equality under the law has been a fact for many decades; but actual equality is nothing but a fool&rsquo;s dream  &mdash;  this one fact alone means that the racial spoils system which Obama likes so very much will go on forever.</p>

			<p>Not &#8220;being racist&#8221; to blacks is giving them what they want and appointing them to positions they&rsquo;re not qualified for, or voting for them.  Wasn&rsquo;t it the incompetent Governor Patterson who said if Obama loses it will be because of racism?</p>
<p>All we need to plummet further into greater degeneration is to have more blacks in control like South Africa, Zimbabwe, Detroit and New Orleans, where they&rsquo;re very close to imploding right now.  In the face of such failure it is only black arrogance that enables them to ignore their failures, thinking the next time they&rsquo;ll get it right.</p>
<p>Has everybody concluded as I have that these people are no more them mentally challenged children who threaten to riot if they don&rsquo;t get what they want?</p>

			<p>I think we all know that an Obama presidency will never convince blacks that they aren&rsquo;t routinely discriminated against. Blacks will always believe that. The only question is (as this article alludes to) will it convince whites that blacks aren&rsquo;t as horribly discriminated against as they claim? That&rsquo;s the most we can hope for from an Obama presidency. </p>
<p>In fact, I almost wonder if proving they&rsquo;re not &#8220;racist&#8221; isn&rsquo;t the only reason whites are voting for Obama. I wonder if they aren&rsquo;t setting up some form of social contract with blacks. &#8220;Okay, we will elect a black president, under ONE condition: blacks must stop whining how they can never get a fair shake in this country.&#8221; When blacks continue whining, as they surely will, whites may feel betrayed  &mdash;  as if their end of the &#8220;bargain&#8221; wasn&rsquo;t held up. Or maybe I&rsquo;m just dreaming.</p>
<p>In any event, I wonder if blacks will pressure Obama to enact some form of reparations shortly after he gets into office. If he does, whites may wonder what happened to all this &#8220;reconciliation&#8221; and coming together Obama promised. If he doesn&rsquo;t, I wonder if blacks will be the ones who feel betrayed. </p>
<p>It would be interesting if, after four years, blacks are the ones who hate Obama to same the degree they hate Colin Powell, Condoleeza Rice and even Clarence Thomas? Perhaps they&rsquo;ll be insisting that they need a president who isn&rsquo;t only half black. It should be an interesting four years&hellip;</p>

			<p>This is another one of those conspicuously suspicious articles where the author almost always refers to blacks as &#8220;African-Americans,&#8221; but never refers to us as anything but &#8220;whites.&#8221;  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a deliberate manipulation of the language for subliminal, insidious purposes; compliments of the thriving Civil Rights/Black Power industry and its friends in the media.</p>

			<p>An Obama Presidency is simply not going to happen anyhow so it doesn&rsquo;t matter.  Assuming McCain wins the same states Bush did and there&rsquo;s no reason why he wouldn&rsquo;t, Obama has a problem with Pennsylvania.  No amount of one sided press coverage or window dressing is going to convince middle America that this guy is nothing more than an affirmative action clown in a suit.  An interesting thing is Clinton bought the rights to a web domain with the number 2012 in it.  She can&rsquo;t run with Obama in the White House so who do you think she&rsquo;s voting for?  Her supporters must have picked up on it because they&rsquo;re not falling in line.</p>

			<p>Sometimes I sit back and find myself amazed at all the pandering that goes on in the popular culture and media for a race that is a relatively small segment of the overall population and has given so little&hellip;and in fact, destroyed so much.</p>
<p>Their presence is so overstated and overrepresented on TV, music and films, and the notion of &#8220;progress&#8221; (as far as the socialists define it) demands an African president being elected as a necessary &#8220;hurdle to overcome.&#8221; For what end?</p>
<p>And right now tonight CNN is airing some &#8220;journalistic&#8221; mini-series called &#8220;Black in America.&#8221; They treat this subject matter as some sort of groundbreaking anthropological discovery, when in fact their toxic &#8220;culture&#8221; is constantly forced upon viewers every other random channel flip or two.</p>

			<p> Nothing short of total extinction of whites will end racism simply because the term &#8220;racism&#8221; has been defined by Liberal ideologues as an idiosyncrasy of whites. In other words, according to that definition, the sentence &#8220;This white person is racist&#8221; is synonymous with &#8220;This white person is white&#8221;.</p>
<p>If Obama wins (I hope not!), the Liberals will start calling for more radical methods to eradicate racism. It is not that difficult to predict since the main architects of the civil rights movement and current diversity/multiculturalism doctrines draw from the same sources as socialists in Soviet Union and Eastern Europe did. Once it became clear that socialism there was a failure and its promises were lies, they claimed that these failures were not the result of socialism but of &hellip; not enough socialism, and vigorously pushed for more.</p>
<p>In other words, these people will stubbornly push for implementation of their absurd ideas, and as soon as it becomes clear that they don&rsquo;t work, they will call for even more of the same nonsense.</p>
<p>So, for those of you who, out of desperation, are contemplating voting for Obama, I have this to say.</p>
<p>When you will be left powerless with no recourse and no means of defense against constant accusations that whatever you do is never enough to kill racism in your hearts, remember my friendly advice: I told you so.</p>

			<p>David Dinkins was mayor of NYC in the late 1980s/early 1990s and crime in the city soared.  Dinkins was originally perceived as a moderate, &#8220;acceptable&#8221; black who would set a good example.<br>
Instead, NYC became hell on earth and New Yorkers, having had enough of murder, rape, assault, etc., elected Giuliani in 1992.<br>
It will be the same when Obama becomes president.  Violent crime will soar.<br>

			<p>&#8220;I think we all know that an Obama presidency will never convince blacks that they aren&rsquo;t routinely discriminated against. Blacks will always believe that. The only question is (as this article alludes to) will it convince whites that blacks aren&rsquo;t as horribly discriminated against as they claim? That&rsquo;s the most we can hope for from an Obama presidency.&#8221; <br>

<p>I predict he will lead from the center &amp; make a lot of compromises.</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s hope so.</p>
<p>By making the blacks the center of universe, you perpetuate their paranoia and special privileges. </p>
<p>Here is proposal:<br>
a historic compromse would be the elimination of all quotas, zero tolerance for criminality, and a generous helping hand to anyone who is really trying.</p>
<p>Idiot King George&rsquo;s special interests were weapons manufacturers, polluters, crooked high finance, and energy firms.</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s are more deserving.</p>

			<p>I think that an Obama presidency will convince a lot of Whites that their guilt is irrational, and that there should be no more whining about &#8220;White racism&#8221; or &#8220;institutional racism&#8221;.<br>
I also think that the race industry will continue to thrive, feeding off the remaining White Guilt.<br>

<p><i>Posted by elitist at 4:48 AM on July 24 </i></p>
<p>The above is an absurd statement, not based on credible evidence.</p>
<p>The problem with so many American voters is that they confuse &#8220;outspoken&#8221; with &#8220;intelligent&#8221;.</p>
<p>Obama doesn&rsquo;t exhibit much self-restraint, nor is he intimidated while talking to much more sophisticated audience than he is. This is a clear indication of simple mindedness rather than intelligence. Philippe Rushton calls it <b>&#8220;winning personality&#8221;</b> (Solving The African IQ Conundrum : &#8220;Winning Personality&#8221; Masks Low Scores) and justly so.</p>
<p>I had a black classmate in a college math class. Many students were intimidated a little by the professor who had reputation of hard grador (you know how it is when you are supposed to prove the binomial formula but you can&rsquo;t tell the basis step from the inductive step), but my classmate was not. Oh, how outspoken he was. He asked what looked like insightful questions in class, made what looked like apt remarks, and nodded his had with understanding each time the professor finished a proof. We thought that this guy was really intelligent.</p>
<p>Well, the first test came, and he got the lowest score in class.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Einstein (an extremely intelligent individual) wasn&rsquo;t outspoken at all. In Princeton, they had to establish the Institute for Advanced Study where they could hire him at non-teaching position because students had difficulty following his lectures.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth remembering that not everything that&rsquo;s shiny is solid gold.<br>

<p>&gt; I don&rsquo;t know what effect an Obama presidency will have as history and even the present examples seems to indicate that people will put up with an awful lot for a long period before real action occurs.  But the idea that whites need to revive the tribal or clan feeling among themselves is essential to white survival.  It was the Roman Empire that began its destruction and the Christian religion that later continued its loss.  However, it is also socialism where socialism becomes universal as it has today in the Western world.  The &#8220;socialism&#8221; of the tribal community for the good of all its members is something that has to be learned again too.  One of the first ways to begin would seem to be the success of having an interest group for whites mirroring the NAACP or La Raza, but not contain qualifiers such as religious or political affliation, etc.  The common binding point must be an understanding that transcends the incidental baggage that history has added to the tribe.</p>

<p>Sorry, but seldom have less true words been typed.  Obama is a creature of the extreme left whose life has been a continuous, self-centered search for the real Obama  &mdash;  -how anyone who is so completely self absorbed could ever spare even a few minutes to think of something else makes one wonder just how much time the famous mulatto will have to spare for such subjects as climate, immigration, the economy or health care.  Obama may well be intelligent, but both he and his wife have very serious problems with reality testing;  they live in a world which is in a different galaxy from that of most of us.<br>
An Obama presidency will be the triumph of white self hatred over common sense and will result in a racial spoils system of unknown proportions.</p>

			<p>My guess would be that the vast majority of black voters have no clue how checks and balances work.  They&rsquo;re going to be shocked when they discovery that Obama is just the executive, and not the legislative and judiciary concurrently.  They&rsquo;re going to wonder why things aren&rsquo;t changing immediately.  Um, because the process is slow and difficult ON PURPOSE.  </p>
<p>BTW, Obama is not the outsider he claims to be.  He was raised by a wealthy white family.  He was president of Harvard Law Review.  I can tell based solely on that fact alone that Obama is part of the criminal gang that has been running this country for over 50 years.  It&rsquo;s just more of the same.  Personally, I&rsquo;m not voting this election.  It&rsquo;s become such a farce. </p>

<p>Your right on there, my friend.  Right on.</p>
<p>Blacks do have a few qualities, which serve to make them appear better than what they are, besides the above perceptive description you gave.   For example, it was pointed out by an astute researcher that blacks have normal abilities at memorization, and many of them are able to string words together fluently without hesitation, so if the black person might be above the black group I.Q. average of 85, he is often complimented by whites on his intelligence.   Add these factors to a natural tendency toward arrogance by blacks, and you have one that truly believes he is a genius.</p>
<p>Those types have been on here many times convinced their superiority will put the racist honkies to shame with their powerful intellects, and they carry on with a more sophisticated audience exactly as if they are in charge.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, their lack of feeling intimidated, and their articulateness and memory doesn&rsquo;t serve them too well when it comes to reasoned, logical argument that requires an ability to understand abstract concepts.  Quite frankly they come across as absolute fools, and to their discredit they aren&rsquo;t able to see it at all and continue on unabated with their take charge attitude.</p>
<p>The condition they are beset with, I believe, is one that has been described as being &#8220;blind to their own stupidity.&#8221;</p>
<p>While this Obama is a substantial cut above these kinds of blacks, he&rsquo;s nothing exceptional compared to whites, and he should give thanks to the heavens that his mother was white, because without that white admixture he wouldn&rsquo;t understand half of what he does right now.</p>
