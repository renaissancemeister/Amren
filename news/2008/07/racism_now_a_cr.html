						<p>AFTER more than a decade of debate, a controversial anti-racism bill has been unanimously approved by legislators in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>This could be good news for non-Chinese Hong Kongers like the Arcilla family.</p>
<p>Originally from the Philippines, the Arcillas have called Hong Kong home for more than two decades.</p>
<p>All of the four Arcilla children were educated in the city after the family&rsquo;s move, and both parents speak fluent English and some Cantonese, hold steady jobs and pay taxes.</p>
<p>Yet they face racism on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Father Ray Arcilla, 54, said he has been called &#8220;stupid and &#8220;brainless&#8221; in the course of his work as an engineer, simply because of the colour of his skin.</p>
<p>His 26-year-old daughter Tesa said she has met Hong Kongers who assume she is either a maid or a prostitute because she is a Filipina.</p>
<p>Under the new anti-racism legislation, the discrimination faced by the Arcillas could now be illegal.</p>
<p>The new law aims to guarantee racial equality by criminalizing &#8220;discrimination, harassment and vilification on the ground of race&#8221;.</p>
<p>Even so, some rights groups like Unison, which represents ethnic minorities, criticize the bill for not going far enough to protect minority rights.</p>
<p>Fermi Wong, the director of Unison, said it was &#8220;ridiculous&#8221; that government agencies, including the police, are exempted from the law.</p>
<p>But secretary for constitutional and mainland affairs Stephen Lam said it was not feasible to include all government departments in the bill.</p>
<p>Doing so could result in &#8220;an influx of litigation and complaints which are unreasonable and unnecessary .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and would hamper efficient administration&#8221;, he said.</p>
<p>Ethnic minority groups, who make up five per cent of Hong Kong&rsquo;s seven million population, have long complained of discrimination from the majority-Chinese population, especially towards the darker-skinned South Asians.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of thousands of ethnic Indians, Filipinos, Nepalese and members of other South Asian groups living in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Many often complain they are paid less than Hong Kong Chinese for the same jobs or are made to work longer hours.</p>
<p>Some have also reported unfair treatment from hospitals and government departments, and difficulty in getting places for their children in public schools because of poor Chinese-language skills.</p>
<p>A separate row over a controversial clause exempting language discrimination divided lawmakers and nearly torpedoed the bill.</p>
<p>Under the original clause, government agencies and hospitals would be required to provide services in languages other than Chinese.</p>
<p>Margaret Ng, who chairs the Legislative Council&rsquo;s bills committee and is a long-time champion of an anti-discrimination law, slammed the government for its &lsquo;mono-language existence&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In a Legislative Council meeting on Wednesday night, she told fellow lawmakers: &#8220;I stand before this council and the eyes of the world bowed down with shame and disappointment. I am deeply ashamed of our government.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unison&rsquo;s Wong said the problem was that the government did not see minorities as a politically significant constituency.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is not a single non-Chinese legislator representing their interests,&#8221; she noted.</p>
<p>In March, Wong and other equal rights campaigners headed to Geneva to express their concerns to the UN Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.</p>
<p>She intends to return next month to put pressure on the Hong Kong government to amend the anti-racial discrimination bill.</p>
<p>But some members of minority races &mdash; the very people the bill sets out to protect &mdash; are apathetic about the law and its clauses and exemptions.</p>
<p>Arcilla echoed the thoughts of others when he said there is only so much a law can do.</p>
<p>&#8220;The rest is up to education.&#8221; Caryn Yeo, The Straits Times-ANN<br>

			<p>Somehow i&rsquo;m seeing that the fall of the west (whites) will be a good thing.<br>
Remember that the top dog is always the one who dictate the laws; and right now everybody imitates the US (multiculturalism, egalitarism, PC, diversity, self-hating whites, Africa missionaries,Hip Hop etc.)<br>
Perhaps the rise of China and India to the top will change that.</p>

			<p>they can pass all the laws they want. Hong kong is now part of China. China is a very racially conscious nation. There are practically no &#8220;immigrants&#8221; to China. Chinese look down on all foreigners, whites let alone other Asians or blacks.  Money is what Hong Kong is about. If these Filipinos are functioning well as professionals, they&rsquo;ll be fine. But overall, the Chinese have less use for dark skinned people than whites in the USA have for dark skinned people. there are billions of people in China, and when and if they dominate the world economy, it will be bad news for African Americans and Africans. &#8220;Civil rights&#8221; is a term I doubt you will find in a Chinese dictionary.</p>

			<p>The Chinese are some of the most racist people on the planet. For thousands of years they saw the world outside their borders are barbarians and the chinese people as superior. Likewise the japanese looked down upon the chinese as inferior. </p>
<p>Britain had to force the country to open trade relations to the rest of the world. </p>

			<p>Ethnic Chinese are all twisted up about skin lightness&rsquo;s pecking order, and have the arsenal of skin bleaching nostrums to show for it. Filipinos and other S.E. Asians are those within viewing distance at whom they direct their petty contempts. Well, that&rsquo;s a fine hobby for them. Throw some American blacks into the mix and they would rapidly go into a sort of shock.</p>

These quotes are making me bang my head against the wall!  These are not examples of racism.  Maybe Arcilla made bonehead mistakes on the job, and he won&rsquo;t be coddled by his employers.  And maybe his daughter dresses like a hooker, who knows?  What would she prefer to be mistaken as?<br>
How do they interpret the rough-and-tumble of daily life as racism?  It&rsquo;s insanity!  Why don&rsquo;t they just leave and quit making themselves and everyone around them miserable?</p>

			<p>Uh oh, slippery slopes for the Hong Kong Chinese. Well not surprising since they were a British colony. I wonder how they&rsquo;ll deal with foreigners trying to take over their country. Looking forward to seeing non white countries such as china, japan, and s. korea dealing with these problems. </p>

			<p>What has been lost here is the Chinese involvement in the 18th and 19th century slave trade.<br>
The Chinese were big players in this. What they they sought were castrated males and they only wanted these because they didn&rsquo;t want an alien (that is, black) population breeding in China.<br>
Who are the fools now? The Chinese are brilliant because they can think generations ahead. It is we who are stupid.<br>

<p>Well&hellip;how about learning the language then?  <br>
According to the article, only 5% of the population are ethnic minorities&hellip;why the heck should government agencies be forced to provide services in other languages other than the native tongue??? </p>

			<p>This particular racism has been around for thousands of years, maybe tens of thousands of years.  Originally darker-skinned peoples, similar to those living in the Philipines, New Guinea and certain isolated islands inhabited what is now Southern China and Indo-China.  Polynesians also have their roots there.  Over the generations, North Asians have been pushing those South Asian populations Southward and displacing them.  My understanding is that the Melanesians (New Guineans and other very dark skinned peoples of surrouding islands) pushed out the negritos (remnant pigmoid populations).  In turn the South Asians pushed out the Melanesians.  Then the North Asians pushed out the South Asians.  The latest major clash is in Irian Jaya, where Indonesians are destroying native tribes and their habitat at an alarming rate.  Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if people could just leave each other alone?</p>

			<p>I think this actually is strategical on the part of the Chinese. They know that as long as the west continues its present demographic trends, the world will eventually be all Chinese. So, by changing their laws to better reflect and enable their greatest weapon against the west.. (immigration) they make themselves look &#8220;progressive&#8221; and this helps prevent the west from moving to protect itself from destruction, as then they will be labeled &#8220;reactionary&#8221; or &#8220;racist&#8221;. </p>
<p>In the words of Sun Tzu: &#8220;The best victory is when the opponent surrenders of its own accord before there are any actual hostilities. It is best to win without fighting&#8221;.</p>

			<p>If the East Asians catch the disease of racial relativism and suffer mass immigration it can only be good for us.</p>
<p>The European peoples where the first to catch this disease.<br>
Maybe we can recover from it soon, when the other advanced races, the East Asian race and the West Asian Europids, catch it.</p>

			<p>If the Chinese are really smart people, havent they figure out by thousand of years ago that the iq is not connected to skin color?</p>
<p>If the environment is the same, as the US, Filipinos beat them.  The Filipinos dont have to study as hard as they do yet almost of them are employed and can hold a job and they have the highest household income, least proverty rate.  Yet check out the welfare reliance rate of the CHinese.  So shameful.  </p>

			<p>As a black man who grew up in Hong Kong, I must say this bill comes as a relief. I have long suspected that racism was the source of all my troubles. Now I have proof and the courts on my side! I can now start blaming the Chinese for everything, and demanding easy, well paying jobs set aside for me and my brethren. Chinese TV must now show the Chinese as criminals and high school dropouts, not me.  Pretty soon the schools will start brainwashing Chinese girls, and they&rsquo;ll start chasing after me instead of responsible, bright, hard-working Chinese men! <br>

			<p>I agree with Barracuda. IN the United States alone, when comparing the lighter skinned Chinese vs the darker skinned South Asian Indians. You would learn that the darker skinned Indians are far more successful academically, economically and socially as compared to their Chinese counterparts. Indian Americans are the wealthiest and best educated ethnic group amongst the Asians. With almost Zero crime rate, high professional educational excellence etc. the Indians seem far more well assimilitated as compared to many Chinese who have entered here illegally, are on welfare or are just on student visas ( trying to steal and &#8220;cut-copy-paste&#8221; US technology).</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t think that Chinese are &#8220;obsessed&#8221; with light skin anymore than Westerners are &#8220;obsessed&#8221; with big breasts. For a girl light skin &#8220;baak jeng&#8221; is one indicator of beauty but not necessarily the sole overriding one. My sister for instance is considered quite dark, yet she is considered pretty &#8220;leng nui, and has never had problems in getting boyfriends.</p>
<p>Also the Chinese, I can assure you are generally quite uninterested in racial matters, and are more curious about blacks than hostile.</p>
<p>John Derbyshire describes well the Chinese attitude towards race:<br>
<a href="https://www.olimu.com/WebJournalism/2007/Texts/ChinaInAfrica.htm" rel="nofollow">https://www.olimu.com/WebJournalism/2007/Texts/ChinaInAfrica.htm</a></p>
<p>Filipinas are looked down upon by some, but to no greater extent than the situation in the West. If a white guy marries a filipina, in the West the stereotype is mail-order bride - with some justification.</p>
<p>The Chinese are certainly not politically correct, but they are not racist. That is a white preserve.</p>
<p>However the anti-racism law is a good first step towards bringing China into the modern world.</p>

			<p>I can see the dominant Chinese mainland administration quitely removing these Hong Kong Marxist Liberal agitators from their positions of influence, revoking their citizenship and international passports, and deporting (banishing) them permanently to outer Mongolia or some such backwater.</p>
<p>If the mainland government does implement such action, then hooray to them and proper order!</p>

<p>Wrong!  You don&rsquo;t speak for the whole of the Chinese race, whether you are Chinese yourself or not. Galton and Derbyshire are merely non-Chinese observers and can&rsquo;t possibly be classed as experts on anything to do with the collective Chinese mindset.  </p>
<p>Where any race demonstrates the willingness to act to preserve what is their&rsquo;s by lineage and thus birthright, this is not an act of racism, but natural survival instinct.  Failure to act results in dispossession, disenfranchisement and lastly, genocide.</p>
<p>Chinese in Hong Kong were treated as immigrants when Hong Kong was under British rule in common with every other immigrant group.  Now that Hong Kong has been returned to Chinese rule, since 1997 several thousands of mainland Chinese have migrated into that island and see other non-Chinese inhabitants as out-groups.  That&rsquo;s understandable.</p>
<p>If the same alien demographic catastrophe that&rsquo;s been unleashed upon the white world was unleashed upon China and her enclaves, it is extremely unlikely that the Chinese would simply continue to &#8216;sit on the fence&rsquo; and not ever demonstrate their anger and rage to their government representatives at some point, most particularly where they were witnessing perpetual alien invasion of avalanche proportions, demands for the introduction of racial discrimination (Affirmative Action) against the native Chinese, an exclusive ethnic quota system, cultural supremacy, education establishments, housing complexes and employment positions all overrun with non-Chinese out-groups who back it all up with threats of wholesale civil upheaval (insurrection) if their endless demands are not met at every turn, in a country these out-groups don&rsquo;t even belong in.  Are you saying the Chinese would tolerate such a situation permanently in <b>their</b> homelands?  </p>
<p>If the Chinese would not be prepared to countenance such a situation in their own homelands indefinitely likewise, why should white races in the lands of their indigenous birthrights do so either.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Tibet is a prime example of what is a true example of &#8216;racism&rsquo;. The Chinese have been suppressing the Tibetans in their own homeland for thousands of years with their Chinese expressions of intolerance and loathing of all things Tibetan.</p>
<p>In view of the above, your submitted opinion on the matter is wholly hypocritical and thus invalid.<br>

<p>They still are Hong Kong still maintains a separate currency and has seperate passport controls despite being part of China.  The term is called &#8220;One Country Two Systems.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why despite being part of China Hong Kong is a called a &#8220;Special Administrative Region&#8221;.  In act that&rsquo;s whats printed in my US Passport for birthplace: Hong Kong SAR, not PRC.  </p>
<p>In fact I believe that people from mainland China also require some sort of visa to enter Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Although technically part of China Hong Kong is a protectorate of mainland China with its own unique set of laws and legal system.</p>

<p>A Swain: eight percent of China&rsquo;s population are non-Han. Even before affirmative action was enacted in the US, Mongolians, Tibetans, Uighurs, Zhuang etc were beneficiaries of affirmative action. As with US blacks now, they require less marks to secure university places, receive massive funding to preserve their respective cultural heritages and have television, radio and print media in their indigenous languages - all at the expense of the state government.</p>
<p>Unlike whites, Han Chinese did not exterminate their own indigenous people, but have perhaps gone too far the other way. By allowing and indeed encouraging the minorities to preserve their own cultural identities and languages it has fostered the very separatist tendencies which are currently such a threat to the stability of China.</p>
<p>For example in Tibet, Tibetans have the choice of either education in the Tibetan language or Mandarin. Many of course choose Tibetan. The downside to this of course is &#8220;One negative side effect of this policy, which is designed to protect and maintain minority cultures, has been reinforcement of a segregated society.&#8221; - US State Dept Report. <br>

<p>A Swain: unlike what happened to the indigenous peoples of the Americas, Australia and New Zealand, both Tibetan population and life expectancy has doubled sinced the so-called Chinese &#8216;invasion&rsquo; of 1950.</p>
<p>In fact the average life expectancy for Tibetans (65) is higher than that of Australian aborigines (59).<br>

			<p>John Liu at 1:27 AM claims that the Chinese aren&rsquo;t racist.  Has he read the news today?  The Chinese Government has instructed restaurants and bars to not seat Blacks and Mongolians during the Olympics.  I suspect that Mr Liu is really a White multiculturalist who gets a thrill out of pretending to be non-White.  I can&rsquo;t imagine a Chinese so clueless about his own people as to make such a statement.  He is a poster best ignored, a troll.</p>

			<p>&#8216;The Chinese are not racist&rsquo;.</p>
<p>For anyone who knows this statement cannot be uttered with a straight face.<br>
To the Chinese ALL foreigners (most particularly non-Mongolian types)are &#8216;barbarians&rsquo;.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Somehow i&rsquo;m seeing that the fall of the west (whites) will be a good thing. Remember that the top dog is always the one who dictate the laws; and right now everybody imitates the US (multiculturalism, egalitarism, PC, diversity, self-hating whites, Africa missionaries,Hip Hop etc.)<br>
Perhaps the rise of China and India to the top will change that.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is an idiotic thing to say on all levels.  And it disturbs me that nobody on here has called this person on this yet.</p>
<p>1) It is NOT inevitable yet that China and India will rise to the top.  I think that the admiration for these two nations is disgusting and unfortunate.  India is a third world sewer and I don&rsquo;t see any evidence that it will overtake the West.  And if India did get on top of the world I don&rsquo;t see how anyone in their right mind could consider this a good thing.  Same with China.  </p>
<p>2) The only reason these nations will rise to the top (if they do) is because they learned a great deal from the West.  You mention all the negative about the West but what about the even larger number of good things?</p>
<p>3) I don&rsquo;t know how you even came to your conclusion after reading what this article is about.  What does India have to do with all this?  And there was once a time when whites were just as racially aware as the Chinese.  We have it in us.  And once whites view immigration the way they used to, we will be far more fit to be on top of the world than the Chinese (as if we aren&rsquo;t already).</p>
<p>I could go on and on with this.  As I said, it disturbs me that no one else on here has responded to this guy&rsquo;s post.<br>
This causes me to lose faith in our movement.  There are too many zombies on here who just go along with these cliches about Asians being better than us.  It is disgusting.<br>

<p>Yes, whites are so stupid for creating 90% of the world&rsquo;s science.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Maybe we can recover from it soon, when the other advanced races, the East Asian race and the West Asian Europids, catch it.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have never heard anyone refer to the peoples of West Asia as Europids OR as advanced.  Who are you refering to in that region?  The arabs aren&rsquo;t equal to us.  At one time there were a lot of Indo-European people in that area but not so much today.  In any case, I don&rsquo;t understand why you are considering that region advanced.</p>
<p>Another thing I would like to say (and this is mostly directed at other posters) is that just because East Asians have better immigration policies, this doesn&rsquo;t make them necessarily better or smarter than us.  They are just different from us.  We are the more adventurous and creative race.  This has been good and bad for us.  Our adventurous nature has brought the world science but it has also brought the world the idea of equality.  At the same time the Asians have their ups and downs.  </p>
<p>Stop bashing your own people (whites); this is getting disgusting.<br>

			<p>&#8220;I agree with Barracuda. IN the United States alone, when comparing the lighter skinned Chinese vs the darker skinned South Asian Indians. You would learn that the darker skinned Indians are far more successful academically, economically and socially as compared to their Chinese counterparts. Indian Americans are the wealthiest and best educated ethnic group amongst the Asians. With almost Zero crime rate, high professional educational excellence etc. the Indians seem far more well assimilitated as compared to many Chinese who have entered here illegally, are on welfare or are just on student visas ( trying to steal and &ldquo;cut-copy-paste&rdquo; US technology).&#8221;</p>
<p>I am really starting to lose faith in our movement by reading these comments.  Is this American Renaissance or a mainstream conservative website that we are posting on?</p>
<p>Indians and Filipinos do better than the Chinese and whites? Give me a break. Compare The Phillipines and India to any white country or any Northeast Asian country.  Who is better off?  The Northeast Asians lack the creativity gene (or they don&rsquo;t have as much of it as whites) which is why they copy, but who is anyone to say that the Indians are somehow better?</p>

			<p>Once China allows immigrants in at the same extent the West does, then I will agree with John Liu.  But right now his argument bears no accuracy.</p>

			<p>Racially profiling while considered a racist action in the West is not necessarily impelled by a sense of racial superiority.</p>
<p>Chinese in Guangzhou for example profile out-of-province Han Chinese migrants as criminally inclined and socially backward. My wife has this very attitude. But as in my wifes case, this does not prevent close friendships being forged or even marriages between Cantonese and people from poorer provinceds.</p>
<p>In a country with limited resources profiling a group know for criminal behaviour is perhaps the easiest and least costful way of ensuring social stability. </p>
<p>In the West they refuse to profile, so an 80 year old white guy from the mid-West is subject to the same scrutiny at the border as an obviously young muslim man with a turban. Maybe the West is rich enough to afford this wastage in resources. China is not.</p>
<p>Again, indigenous groups in China have fared way better under communist rule than indigenous groups under white rule. Most are still large minorities in their own areas, speak their own languages, dress in native costumes and many still live lives very different and separate from the Han Chinese. What suffering they did undergo was mainly persecution at the hands of anti-religious fanatics during the cultural revolution. But then all Chinese of different ethnicities were subject to the same travails at this time.</p>

			<p>I wonder how many Filipinos, Malays or Indonesians would agree with the assertion that the Chinese are not racist.<br>
 These are all cultures that know the Chinese intimately, and in many cases are bossed around by them.</p>

			<p>Few things.</p>
<p>There are not billions of humans in China, thank God.</p>
<p>Southern Chinese are SE Asians, or South Asians. They are very distant from Northeast or North Asians. Extremely distant. Whites are closer to NE Asians than Southern Chinese are.</p>
<p>The Filipinos come from Taiwan, and are very closely related to Taiwanese and Hong Kong Han. For all intents and purposes, Filipinos are a South Chinese people. All SE Asians come from Southern Chinese. Thais came only in the past 800 years. Western Indonesians and Malays are also very heavily Taiwanese (South Chinese) types. Polynesians and Micronesians are about 1/2 Taiwanese (South Chinese) and Melanesian. There isn&rsquo;t much evidence for Melanesians pushing out Negrito types. They appear to be similar stock.</p>

			<p>It is a fact that East Indians and Filipinos in the US do quite a bit better than Chinese, and vastly better than US Whites, economically. Filipinos outperform all other Asian groups in the US, including Japanese.</p>
<p>West Asians are Caucasians. I guess that is what he means by Euripids. That includes Turks, Kurds, Assyrians, Arabs of Arabia, Levant the Mesopotamia, the Caucasus, Iran and Afghanistan. There are definitely some very White-looking people in all of those places. I can show you some pics if you want. Indo-European does not equal White. Turks, the Caucasus, Kurds, Assyrians and Iranians are White for sure.</p>

               Perhaps you have the genetic data to back up your claim that north-east asians are closer to &#8216;Whites&rsquo; than they are to the southern Chinese, But I for one find this very hard to swallow - purely based on obvious phenotypic similarities (ie the distinctive eye-fold, the coarse black hair, the small gracile physique, the colouring).<br>
  Similarly I admit that Iranians, Arabs etc are of the &#8216;caucasian&rsquo; family (Turks, of course, originated in central Asia and are kin to the Mongolians), but they are in 99.9% of cases readily distinguishable from a northern or central European (ie a &#8216;White&rsquo; in popular parlance) by even a four year old child.</p>
