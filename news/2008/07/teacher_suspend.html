<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A HIGH school has suspended a teacher following claims that pupils were punished for not praying to Allah.</p>
<p>Education bosses have launched an investigation following complaints from parents after two Year Seven Alsager High School pupils were given detention for refusing to take part in a practical demonstration of how Allah is worshipped, which included them wearing Muslim headgear.</p>
<p>The inquiries will involve parental complaints about &#8220;methods&#8221; of education on the Islamic faith and also ongoing inquiries centred around other practice issues.</p>
<p>Cheshire County Council said the suspension is not in itself a disciplinary measure.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, concerned parents are calling on the education authority to investigate how religion is taught in schools.</p>
<p>Parent Sharon Luinen said: &#8220;At the moment I am happy with the way the school have dealt with the issue and don&rsquo;t want this to look as if I have a problem with the school because I am very happy with it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am all for children learning about multicultural societies as they do need to know about the different faiths, but my gripe is they shouldn&rsquo;t have to take part in something they don&rsquo;t believe in or want to do. To say they were disrespecting Allah because they didn&rsquo;t want to take part is a bit much.</p>
<p>&#8220;These children are the youngest in the school and are not going to question the authority of their teachers.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be just as horrifying if a Muslim child was told to say Christian prayers.&#8221;</p>
<p>County children&rsquo;s services director Joan Feenan, said: &#8220;Educating children in the beliefs of different faiths is part of the national curriculum in secular schools and I&rsquo;m sure that the great majority of our parents welcome any efforts to further mutual understanding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Having said that this authority also accepts without question that such teaching should be carried out with awareness, sensitivity and sound common sense.&#8221;</p>
