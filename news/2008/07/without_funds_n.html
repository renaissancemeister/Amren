<p>[New Jersey] has an estimated 1.3 million people without health insurance who cannot pay a doctor or a hospital bill. New Jersey law requires that hospitals treat anyone who walks through their doors, and then get reimbursed later by the state. But the state&rsquo;s looming budget shortfall has forced it to cut back on the reimbursements, leaving hospitals to pick up the tab. And hospitals, in turn, are going broke: Six have closed in the past 18 months, and half of those remaining are operating in the red.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The situation has come to a head in this city [Plainfield] of 48,000 people &mdash; majority black, largely poor and with many new immigrants moving in. The city&rsquo;s hospital of 130 years, Muhlenberg Regional Medical Center, is slated to become the latest casualty of this faltering system, closing its acute-care facility later this year. The obstetrics and pediatrics wards have already shut, and equipment is being packed up and wheeled out.</p>
<p>The hospital says it lost $16.8 million last year and will lose another $18 million in 2008, leaving its owners little choice but to close it down. But news of this latest closure has hit hard for those in Plainfield and surrounding towns who have come to rely on Muhlenberg. Many are elderly, some have chronic conditions, and they will now have to travel as far as 10 miles away for care.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Muhlenberg, owned by Solaris Health System, blames the huge growth in uninsured patients, the underfunding of Medicaid and Medicare and the state&rsquo;s budget cuts for charity care. &#8220;The healthcare system in New Jersey is clearly broken,&#8221; Muhlenberg says on its Web site. &#8220;And hospitals that serve a high percentage of poor and uninsured cannot survive under these pressures.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}<br>
 <br>
Some of the uninsured are new immigrants from Mexico and Central America who are moving into the town. But most are longtime residents, working-class families, black and white, who have lost their jobs and their health insurance as the regional economy has faltered.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The wave of illegal immigration is another problem. Illegal immigrants by law cannot apply for charity care. But by law, they must also be treated at New Jersey hospitals, which cannot ask for proof of citizenship. &#8220;They get treated, but the hospital is just hoping somebody, someday will pay,&#8221; said Mary Zink, a Plainfield art teacher who volunteers with the People&rsquo;s Organization for Progress, an activist group that has been leading protests against Muhlenberg&rsquo;s closing.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some state officials have said that New Jersey needs this period of consolidation &mdash; that there were too many hospitals, and that some needed to close to make the system more rational and efficient.</p>

Six hospitals closing in just 18 months should be a loud, screaming headline. But this pace is just slow enough to allow the mainstream media to let it go by virtually unnoticed.</p>
<p>Does this story remind anyone about yesterday&rsquo;s story detailing the gradual collapse of medicine in South Africa?</p>

			<p>I hadn&rsquo;t had any insurance since I graduated college. When I was working up in NJ, I almost cut the tip of my finger off. (It was sliced down through the nail, barely hanging on.) <br>
&#8216;New Jersey law requires that hospitals treat anyone who walks through their doors&rsquo; I guess I could have gone to the hospital. I was debating it. </p>
<p>Nah. I trust myself more than going to a hospital in NJ. I just wanted to keep the injured area clean. I wrapped it up, held my finger above my heart, and kept working. It was fine after a few months. No work lost.  </p>
<p>When I have worked around uneducated workers, I&rsquo;ve heard them mention plenty of times of all the visits to the emergency room. Their reasons for going where so insane to me. I assume none of them have ever thought to have a physican or make an appointment for anything. </p>

			<p>Frankly, I don&rsquo;t cry for anything in NJ, the land of gun control and air gun control. They brought this upon themselves with their arrogance and condesending to the police and other public employees. For example, &#8220;The current starting salary for a trooper is $58,748.29 (including uniform allowance). The second-year total compensation jumps to $65,662.39. Top pay for a Trooper I is $97,188.48. Troopers receive yearly increments.&#8221;</p>

			<p>No suprises here.</p>
<p>Anyone who has spent anytime around hospital emergency rooms knows that illegals and Medicaid recipients use them to rountinely treat everything from hangnails to upset stomachs.  This is compliments of a assinine federal law.</p>
<p>A nurse I know used to work in the ER in a smaller city.  She routinely would tell me about medicaid recipients arriving at the ER (the entire extended family in tow EXCEPT FOR the patient, who would be coming behind in the ambulance) for treatment for upset stomachs and colds.  They realized if they called an ambulance, da gubmint would have to pay.  Instead of putting their sorry butt in the car and driving them over, they wasted valuable resources just to cheat the system and to avoid paying their miniscule copay.  </p>
<p>And you wonder why hospitals are closing???</p>

			<p>Absolute rocket science. Bring on the parasites. Democratic fascism is in control. One person one vote, a true mob rule, and since the majority of Americans, couldn&rsquo;t fill the back side of a postage stamp with their political knowledge, we are on the verge of collapse. Remember under this system your vote counts the same as the village idiot.  </p>

			<p>&#8216;There&rsquo;s no such thing as a free lunch&rsquo;<br>
 <br>
An aphorism often attributed to the free-market economist Milton Friedman.<br>
He also maintained that it is impossible to maintain a welfare state with &#8216;open-door&rsquo; immigration.<br>
 This is the other side of the coin that the extreme free-market right that screams and shouts for more immigration keep silent about.</p>

			<p>Perhaps Mary Zink should get her head out  and attend some courses on economics. She should pay attention to cash flow profit and loss. A study of history would reveal the practice called debt slavery; can&rsquo;t pay your debt find yourself in chains heading toward the quarry.</p>

			<p>Curiously, the same illegals who &#8220;can&rsquo;t&#8221; pay their medical bills always have plenty of money to send home as remittances.</p>

			<p>  This problem of illegal immigration could be solved overnight. If every American, white or black, marched onto their town halls, illegal immigration would end faster than you could say &#8220;barrio&#8221;.</p>

			<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;If every American, white or black, marched onto their town halls, illegal immigration would end faster than you could say &ldquo;barrio&rdquo;</p>
<p>That is, if you can get enough people motivated enough to get off their backsides.</p>
<p>Have you noticed McAmnesty and Obamination BOTH are for open borders? A coincidence? About the same coincidence as the 911 towers dropping ever so neatly in their own footprints like controlled demolitions! Americans are being manipulated and controlled. Which explains WHY Ron Paul got such poor media coverage. We are not supposed to have [negative] opinions on illegal immigration. So the media fall all over themselves to put a &#8220;spin&#8221; on the problem. To boost ONLY politicians trumpeting the North American Union and Open Borders garbage!</p>
<p>While American citizens are robbed, raped, killed by illegal immigrants in virtually any area of our nation you&rsquo;d care to name.</p>
<p>Then when Lying George pulls off the NAU as his final abomination before being replaced in January, 2009   &mdash;   millions of Americans will want to know WHY and HOW was this accomplished. Answer being: They collectively couldn&rsquo;t be bothered putting up any kind of a struggle. A fitting epitaph for a once proud nation.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;They get treated, but the hospital is just hoping somebody, someday will pay&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In effect, the New Jersey State Legislature is closing these hospitals - by passing laws that prohibit hospitals from screening out illegal aliens. In fact, those laws mandate free medical care at New Jersey hospitals for any human being from anywhere in the world who walks in.</p>
<p>&hellip;And the citizens of New Jersey continue to elect and pay these legislators?  </p>
