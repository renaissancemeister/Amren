						<p>ALMOST a third of British Muslim students believe killing in the name of Islam can be justified, according to a poll.</p>
<p>The study also found that two in five Muslims at university support the incorporation of Islamic sharia codes into British law.</p>
<p>The YouGov poll for the Centre for Social Cohesion (CSC) will raise concerns about the extent of campus radicalism. &#8220;Significant numbers appear to hold beliefs which contravene democratic values,&#8221; said Han-nah Stuart, one of the report&rsquo;s authors. &#8220;These results are deeply embarrassing for those who have said there is no extremism in British universities.&#8221;</p>
<p>The report was criticised by the country&rsquo;s largest Muslim student body, Fosis, but Anthony Glees, professor of security and intelligence studies at Buckingham University, said: &#8220;The finding that a large number of students think it is okay to kill in the name of religion is alarming.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a wide cultural divide between Muslim and nonMuslim students. The solution is to stop talking about celebrating diversity and focus on integration and assimilation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The researchers found that 55% of nonMuslim students thought Islam was incompatible with democracy. Nearly one in 10 had &#8220;little respect&#8221; for Muslims.</p>
<p>In addition to its poll of 1,400 Muslim and nonMuslim students, the centre visited more than 20 universities to interview students and listen to guest speakers. It found that extremist preachers regularly gave speeches that were inflammatory, homophobic or bordering on antisemitic.</p>
<p>The researchers highlighted Queen Mary college, part of London University, as a campus where radical views were widely held. Last December, a speaker named Abu Mujahid encouraged Muslim students to condemn gays because &#8220;Allah hates&#8221; homosexuality. In November, Azzam Tamimi, a British-based supporter of Hamas, described Israel as the most &#8220;inhumane project in the modern history of humanity&#8221;.</p>
<p>James Brandon, deputy director at CSC, said: &#8220;Our researchers found a ghettoised mentality among Muslim students at Queen Mary. Also, we found the segregation between Muslim men and women at events more visible at Queen Mary.&#8221;</p>
<p>A spokesman for Queen Mary said the university was aware the preachers had visited but did not know the contents of their speeches. &#8220;Clearly, we in no way associate ourselves with these views. However, also integral to the spirit of university life is free speech and debate and on occasion speakers will make statements that are deemed offensive.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the report, 40% of Muslim students said it was unacceptable for Muslim men and women to associate freely. Homophobia was rife, with 25% saying they had little or no respect for gays. The figure was higher (32%) for male Muslim students. Among nonMuslims, the figure was only 4%.</p>
<p>The research found that a third of Muslim students supported the creation of a world-wide caliphate or Islamic state.</p>
<p>A number of terrorists have been radicalised at British universities. Kafeel Ahmed, who drove a flaming jeep into a building at Glasgow airport last year and died of his burns, is believed to have been radicalised while studying at Anglia Ruskin university, Cambridge.</p>
<p>Wes Streeting, president of the National Union of Students, condemned the study. &#8220;This disgusting report is a reflection of the biases and prejudices of a right-wing think tank &mdash; not the views of Muslim students across Britain,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Only 632 Muslim students were asked vague and misleading questions, and their answers were wilfully misinterpreted.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of the findings amplify previous research. A report by Policy Exchange last year found that 37% of all Muslims aged 16-24 would prefer to live under a sharia system.</p>
<p>Baroness Warwick, chief executive of Universities UK, said: &#8220;Violence, or the incitement to violence, has no place on a university campus.&#8221;<br>

<p>Perhaps Mr Streeting&rsquo;s views would be different if 10 or 20 years from now his daughters started marrying Muslims.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sick to think that our ancestors shed their blood to keep the Muslims out of Europe, and yet a handful of traitors have handed over our lands with out a shot being fired &hellip;</p>
<p>Where is a Charles Martel or Don Carlos when we need one?</p>

			<p>Well, native Britain, you asked for it so now you have it.  Bathe now in the consequences of your government&rsquo;s &#8220;deep thinking&#8221;.  And don&rsquo;t forget to duck because Mohammed is gunning for you.  </p>

			<p>I lived and worked in Saudia Arabia and Jordan during the 90Â´s. What is strange is that homosexuality is common amongst men as long as it is not called by that name, especially in Saudia Arabia where the separation of the sexes is so apparent. In Saudia Arabia an effeminate man is seen as a homosexual, but a man exhibiting no effeminate outward behavior, who nonetheless engages in homosexual behavior at a bathhouse, is not labeled as such. Also, in Saudia Arabia imported she-males from South America or Asia are very popular as sex objects, and the fact that they are biological males was never mentioned amongst the Arabs indulging in this type of behaviour. </p>

<p>Only a third?  They must be getting soft.</p>
<p>Better ramp up that propaganda machine, because somebody might think it would be a good idea to keep those people out of Western countries, and we could never live with a decision like that, because &#8220;diversity is our strength.&#8221;</p>

<p>He has it half right.  Just replace &#8220;integration and assimilation&#8221; with &#8220;deportation,&#8221; and everything will be fine.<br>

<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s alarming but not surprising. The question is, what are you going to do about it???</p>

<p>Right  &mdash;  and all you have to do to integrate and assimilate them is get them to give up Islam! Shouldn&rsquo;t be any problem. (Just ask nicely, as we are wont to do).</p>

			<p>The foolishness of granting religious and other freedoms to a religion whose members in large numbers oppose religious and other freedoms. And will kill to preserve the lack of freedom they so cherish.</p>
<p>Our cultural forms, including our freedoms, were designed for us, and work for us. They do not work for peoples such as these.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe the percent of Christians in our own country who support the creation of a theocratic state with freedoms severely curtailed is nearly as high as the percent of such folks among muslims. But I really don&rsquo;t know, and would like to know.</p>

			<p>Oh for God&rsquo;s sake do these people ever learn? Their country and culture are being destroyed by these parasites yet they do nothing but acquiesce to their demands and desires.  Sickening, utterly sickening&hellip;</p>
<p>Amazing that a once great nation has been reduced to this. Unfortunately, i think that we are the next to fall.<br>

<p>You mean a third admitted it openly. I&rsquo;ll bet there is at least another third that believes this but simply didn&rsquo;t admit it to the one doing the poll.</p>

<p>This is true, every word of it. It is also true in Kuwait and Iraq. I think the Kuwait and Saudi men are the most despicable bunch of hypocrits on the planet, their women think so too BTW and I know this to be a fact.</p>

<p>There are now several thousand prostitutes in Dubai. Apart from a few African women, they come from Russia, the Ukraine and other republics of the so-called Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Dubai, like Bahrain, &#8216;has prospered as a centre for fun-starved Saudis,&rsquo; as the Sunday Times report puts it.<br>

<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, they have been fighting among themselves (like Christians, but fiercer) since the inception of their religion.  If they ever do convert the world, a worldwide Muslim civil war would result.  That much cultural agressiveness always needs a cause.  But let&rsquo;s not forget to look in the mirror.</p>
