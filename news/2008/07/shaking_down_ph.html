<h1>Shaking Down Philanthropies</h1>

	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} A proposed bill there would have required foundations with more than $250 million in assets to report the racial, gender and sexual orientation of their board members, staffs and grantees. The bill&rsquo;s sponsors recently agreed to drop the issue in return for a political payoff of millions of dollars from 10 of the state&rsquo;s biggest charities.</p>
<p>In 2007, state representative Joe Coto introduced &#8220;The Foundation Diversity and Transparency Act&#8221; at the behest of the Berkeley-based activist group, Greenlining. The organization claimed that though &#8220;communities of color&#8221; made up the majority of Californians, the state&rsquo;s foundations were spending only 5% of their dollars on them. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Greenlining only counts money as going to minorities if it&rsquo;s given to organizations whose board and staff are more than 50% minority. Thus an inner-city Catholic school with a 95% black population wouldn&rsquo;t qualify if its teachers were mostly white. As well, these are private foundations whose donors gave money for specific causes, such as cancer treatments or the environment. Presumably they&rsquo;d like the money to go to people who can accomplish these goals most effectively, rather than to some pol&rsquo;s allies.</p>
<p>Despite the objections of the state&rsquo;s nonprofit sector to this remarkable government grab, the bill passed through the Democrat-controlled assembly and was heard this spring by the state Senate&rsquo;s business and economic development committee. Mark Ridley-Thomas, the committee chair and head of the black caucus, had the votes to get it out of committee and through the Senate. Locked in a tight primary race for Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, Mr. Ridley-Thomas apparently was playing this issue for all it was worth, promising his South Central L.A. constituents that he would, as California political blogger Stephen Frank put it, &#8220;make sure the rich white foundations would give their money to local nonprofits.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Robert Ross, president and CEO of the California Endowment, a private health foundation that works with underserved populations, was at the Senate hearing. He reports that the state&rsquo;s foundations &#8220;were roughed up pretty badly.&#8221; The message, from the bill&rsquo;s supporters, he says, was that &#8220;well-heeled philanthropy is too busy spending money on opera and museums of fine art to make their resources available to minority and low-income communities.&#8221; But there was room for compromise, apparently. &#8220;Mr. Ridley-Thomas related to us, and to me personally, &lsquo;If you guys show some problem-solving leadership on this, we&rsquo;ll look to that kindly.&rsquo;&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>Dr. Ross and his colleagues agreed that by the end of the calendar year they would propose multiyear, multimillion-dollar initiatives to improve the access of minority-led organizations to foundation money and to help &#8220;train a diverse pipeline of executives, staff and board members for the nonprofit and philanthropic sectors.&#8221; Neither Dr. Ross nor his colleagues at other foundations were willing to give us a specific figure for the commitment, but Orson Aguilar, the incoming executive director at Greenlining, says he&rsquo;s expecting somewhere in the range of $300 million to $500 million over the next five years.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Foundations devoted to environmental change, [Orson Aguilar, the incoming executive director at Greenlining] notes, should give money to minority-led organizations because &#8220;communities of color suffer most from global warming, if you look at asthma rates.&#8221;</p>
<p>When we last wrote about this topic (&#8220;The Color of Charity,&#8221; Feb. 4), we quoted a letter by Paul Brest, president of the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, California&rsquo;s largest foundation, to the state assembly: &#8220;[Our] fundamental operating principle is to direct our resources to organizations that have the promise of making the greatest difference in achieving [philanthropic] goals. Thus, we do not focus on the racial composition of our grantees, but rather on how to achieve measurable impact in improving the lives of the communities that our grant recipients serve.&#8221; This is still an eloquent summary of the problems with diversity initiatives. {snip}</p>
