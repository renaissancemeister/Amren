						<p>A Los Angeles judge dismissed a taxpayer lawsuit Wednesday that sought to repeal a long-standing directive prohibiting Los Angeles police officers from asking arrestees about their immigration status.</p>
<p>Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Rolf M. Treu sided with the city and the American Civil Liberties Union, which claimed there were no triable issues raised in the suit. He heard arguments on the motion June 10 and had the case under submission since then.</p>
<p>Los Angeles resident Harold P. Sturgeon filed suit in May 2006 against police Chief William J. Bratton and members of the Police Commission, seeking to have Special Order 40 declared unlawful.</p>
<p>In court papers, Sturgeon&rsquo;s lawyers called Special Order 40 &#8220;essentially a &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t Ask, Don&rsquo;t Tell&rsquo; policy regarding illegal aliens.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sturgeon asked for a permanent injunction preventing taxpayer money from being used to enforce it. He and other critics said the 28-year-old mandate from the Los Angeles City Council hampers the LAPD&rsquo;s ability to exchange information with federal immigration officials.</p>
<p>The order is intended to avoid discouraging illegal immigrants from reporting crimes and assisting police.</p>
<p>In their court papers, lawyers for the City Attorney&rsquo;s Office maintained the directive does not prevent the LAPD from working closely with federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no evidence .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to show that ICE has ever complained that they have not had the assistance of LAPD, or that LAPD has not come when they are called,&#8221; the city&rsquo;s court papers state.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last year, the Los Angeles City Council went on record against any future federal legislation that would force the Los Angeles Police Department to change its policy on identifying undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Los Angeles was the first major city to enact the Special Order 40 policy in 1979.<br>

			<p>Anywhere else it would be unthinkable to have a judge toss out a request by citizens to make law enforcement obey the law. But here in Los Angeles, it&rsquo;s par for the course.</p>
<p>Consider that we have about 1.2 million illegals in Los Angeles with more pouring in. Attempts to send them back would result in rioting. Los Angeles would be thrown into chaos [again].</p>

<p>Who cares what their insane reasons are? Really. Especially considering each week they are liable to give a new reason. That&rsquo;s not the only reason to discount their insane reasoning. Just one more reason not to give a hoot. </p>

			<p>Is anyone surprised at this action? California belongs to Mexico. We are sadly lacking leaders who have any intestinal fortitude to stand up for their own country and its citizens. California brough this on themselves. They elect reconquistas and then are surprised that their leaders do everything they can to bring all of Mexico here. We who value our nation should think long and hard about the next 4-8 years. Whoever wins the presidential election, will make sure that the borders are opened wide and every criminal will become a citizen.</p>

			<p>A perfect example of the future.  Judges rule for the people and illegal aliens have preference.  The entire idea of equal protection  was not to include those who steal (fraud &amp; thieves) into USA and was not to include greater protections for some than others.<br>
This shines the light of intentions upon those who are deliberately circumventing USA laws and using the judical branch to achieve their (not USA) goals.  V</p>

<p>Hold your horses! What does this have to do with arrestees? If you&rsquo;re arrested, darn right they can inquire about your immigration status. I live in Greater Tijuana too (Central CA portion), but illegals who are arrested are routinely handed over to ICE. Routinely.</p>
<p>Los Angeles has obviously gone completely insane.</p>
<p>All you Amrenners talking about how Hispanics are tolerable whereas Blacks are not, forget it. Hispanics in small #&rsquo;s are quite tolerable. In large numbers, they recreate Mexico, with all of the violence, chaos and squalor imaginable.</p>
<p>No sane White person would EVER want to live with large #&rsquo;s of Hispanics. NEVER! </p>
