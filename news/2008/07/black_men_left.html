<h1><a href="http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2008/07/black_men_left_behind_by_hight.html">Black Men Left Behind by High-Tech Economy, Report Warns</a></h1>
					<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robert L. Smith, Cleveland Plain Dealer,  July 28, 2008 20:04PM</i></p>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As the region and the state strive to prepare workers to compete in the new economy, a local research group warns that huge numbers of people are likely to be left behind.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of black men are not only unemployed but nearly unemployable in a knowledge-based economy, so investments in higher education and in high-skills job training will not reach them, PolicyBridge argues in a study to be released Tuesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Job Prescription: Examining Pervasive Joblessness Among African-American Men&#8221; argues that creative strategies are needed to re-introduce the working life to jobless black adults, some of whom have given up on ever finding steady work.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The report, written by McShepard and Mark Batson, PolicyBridge&rsquo;s executive director, along with researcher Fran Stewart, warns of a &#8220;full blown economic emergency&#8221; left largely untreated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s well known that the black unemployment rate well exceeds the white unemployment rate here and nationally, but even that alarming number reflects only people actively looking for work, the authors point out.</p>
<p>For a clearer look at the workforce, the authors combined the numbers of unemployed with the numbers of jobless black adults reported to the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>
<p>By their reckoning, 38 percent of black men ages 25 to 54 in Cleveland are not in the labor force. Regionwide, 31 percent of black men of prime working age are not working.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Often, a work ethic is lost in communities afflicted with long-term joblessness, making its residents even less attractive to employers.</p>
<p>The report call for focused attention to the problem and suggests a couple of helping strategies.</p>
<p>Investments aimed at increasing the numbers of college graduates and high-tech workers, while important, will not lift the urban black underclass anytime soon, the report argues.</p>
<p>PolicyBridge calls for more basic adult job training and job matching. It suggests alternatives to jail for drug offenders, like &#8220;skills training camps,&#8221; and more programs aimed at helping high school drop outs earn degrees.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

			<p>And after they all realize that they don&rsquo;t have the brain pans for such a career track, then the technology industry, like Bill Gates, will just dump a bunch of money on quasi-welfare programs.</p>
<p>Either that, or affirmative action them in to positions they&rsquo;re not qualified for, while a white subordinate does all the work for none of the pay.</p>

			<p>The Chinese, Japanese, Russians, Indians and Arabs are doing very well in high tech. It&rsquo;s because of their superior intelligence and habits of hard work. Groups that don&rsquo;t have the intelligence and good work habits have to stop their whining.</p>

			<p>  Are black communities really &#8220;afflicted with long-term joblessness,&#8221; as the story says? Or is it really &#8220;long-term laziness&#8221;? Notice how such stories always tap dance around the main problem   &mdash;   not that many blacks can&rsquo;t find work, but that many blacks would not work if you put a gun to their heads. All this talk about the things that someone else should do   &mdash;   the federal government, &#8220;society,&#8221; ad nauseum, is really comical. It&rsquo;s the black community that is heavily dysfunctional, and problems like this are a big factor in that.</p>
<p>  There is never any shortage of black &#8220;leaders&#8221; (usually preachers) when they want to complain about &#8220;racism&#8221; or some other such alleged affliction. Where are their leaders when it comes to growing some responsibility in their community?</p>

<p>The ones that aren&rsquo;t in prison are selling dope, pulling robberies, burglaries, rapes, and assaults, plus home invasion has become extremely popular with them as of late. </p>
<p>If they would give a truthful answer as to why they don&rsquo;t look for regular employment or learn a trade, they&rsquo;ll admit stealing and dope pay a whole lot better, and crime is much easier to do. </p>
<p>The only way to get them out of that lifestyle is to give them jobs with CEO pay and make certain they don&rsquo;t have to work but a few hours per week, and allow them to get high on the job.</p>
<p>I mean, we know the solution, so why isn&rsquo;t it being acted on? </p>

			<p>Conservative John McWhorter of AEI, who is black, speaks of &#8216;the corner man&rsquo; in the black community and its increasing prevalence through the last century. As the welfare programs increased in the 60s, he states that the corner man became more and more common. </p>

<p>The only jobs low IQ blacks can be matched to are those of carwash atendants, fast food workers, or very low skilled, low paying positions. Those are the very jobs that blacks, whom have a ghetto mentality, feel that they&rsquo;re too good to perform.</p>

<p>So, when they write these endless articles about income and opportunities, and check incomes, even net-worth nowadays, for purposes such as affirmative action, for starters, they are basically comparing the incomes or people who chose not to work with those who do. When I was in the Army, once a year we&rsquo;d get a print-out of how much we were &#8216;actually&rsquo; earning. They would add the value of eating at the chow hall, medical care, and housing allowance to our salary, saying we were making $30,000 a year while our paycheck said it was $10,000. Personally, I don&rsquo;t have a problem with these men choosing not to work, but how about including rent/utility/appliance vouchers, foodstamps, girlfriends, job training, unemployment and subsidised housing, when figuring out the income of these men who aren&rsquo;t working? </p>

			<p>Ill never forget YEARS ago in suburban northern Virginia I went to take a test to qualify for entry at one of those computer schools that you see on tv. There were many blacks there also to take the test which in my opinion was quite easy. After the test, they only called the names of those who had passed in order to sell us  their computer training. About 90% of the blacks were not called on. It was indeed eye opening for this naive boy from a white majority town in Illinois on that day&hellip;</p>

<p>Africa. A black male is lying under a banana plant waiting until a fruit falls down, then he eats them. By walks a white guy,<br>
&ldquo;Listen, lad, why are lying here and waiting. Why don&rsquo;t you take a stick to knock some hands down?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s why? Take them to a market and sell.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;What do mean what for? You&rsquo;ll make money to hire several blacks like you. They would bring down more fruits for you to sell.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;So what?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Are you obtuse? Having money, you would hire hundreds of blacks to plant more banana plants. You are going to be a plantation owner.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;What would I do it for?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Idiot. After getting big money you wouldn&rsquo;t work at all. Only you would do is lying on your back and eat your bananas.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;How really stupid all you whities are! What do you think am I doing now?&rdquo;<br>

			<p>You want to teach black males how to work, get rid of public housing! I live near one of those places, they cut through my neighborhood with the cops hot on their heels. Right back to their free room and board that we taxpayors provide them with. All they have to do is put up with the police helicopters each weekend. Make them pay their way through life just like the rest of us.</p>

<p>What does this say about these black men - victims of the legacy of slavery? </p>
<p>What do all these able bodied black males do? Check the Cleveland crime figures. </p>
<p>What can Cleveland do about it? Nothing but waste taxpayer money on the usual non-working stuff like &#8220;job training&#8221;. </p>

			<p>SHOULDN&rsquo;T it be THEIR responsibility to be more employable and to upgrade their work skillls? At my job (I work for a major telecommunications corporation) we are constanly told it is OUR responsibility to develop and upgrade our working skills, knowledge and employability. I do everything I can to keep abreast of changes, new developments, take courses, etc.</p>

			<p>I love how they describe these types of situations concerning blacks and higher learning.  It&rsquo;s always the institution that has &#8220;failed them&#8221; or &#8220;left them behind&#8221;.  Even Lou Dobbs occasionally talks about how &#8220;our schools are failing an entire generation of students&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as if it&rsquo;s the <b>teachers</b> that are the ones just showing up for class, going through the motions, goofing around, not paying attention, fighting, posturing, and harassing the other students; and the <b>black male students</b> are the ones sitting quietly, giving their full attention to the teacher, respecting others, just ready to absorb another day of learning!</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember ever hearing any stories about any teacher or school administrator putting a gun to a black student&rsquo;s head and forcing them to drop out of school. That is their decision and their decision alone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty evident that mathematics, science, history, English and literature isn&rsquo;t their cup of tea. I mean, how in the world does that help them accomplish their goal of being the next &#8220;great&#8221; gangsta rapper, baller, porn star or dope dealer?</p>

			<p>What really blows my mind&hellip; that Black men are also shoved aside in the labor market by ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS! And that their Mulatto Messiah, Barak Hussein Obama, is selling his own people out   &mdash;   TO GET THE HISPANIC VOTE IN NOVEMBER!</p>
<p>Can the average Black American male really be as stupid as all that? To not UNDERSTAND what&rsquo;s going on in the lowest level labor competition? To NOT UNDERSTAND how Obama is hurting his own people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no secret in head to head competition for unskilled labor jobs, hiring managers will hire illegal aliens (even if they have damned good reason to suspect the proffered documentation is false) over Black Americans. Blacks are hurt by the fact too many business owners and corporate managers view Blacks as NOT HAVING A WORK ETHIC! That Blacks will ONLY WORK if carefully watched, So the businesses and corporations hire Mexicans   &mdash;   and can claim Blacks didn&rsquo;t apply or appear interested   &mdash;   while saving bushels of dollars on cheap wages paid to illegals.</p>

			<p>Hummmm, maybe if instead of disrupting classes, they should pay attention and learn, or even show up for classes more than a few times a week, they might just open a book, read and learn!!! Who&rsquo;s fault is it??? Why us whites are to blame as usual&hellip;..you can even teach a monkey to do something when they pay attention&hellip;.but blacks only have to learn to spell their names to sign a welfare check&hellip;and if they get sent on to college&hellip;for free, bye the way, they just get the ole sheepskin just because they are black, brown or any other rainbow color&hellip;.whites have to pay  and pay till doomsday!!</p>

			<p>Too little, too late. Black men have been effectively out of the workforce for some time. It&rsquo;s only because of Affirmative Action and quotas that we have this illusion that they&rsquo;re in the workforce at all. Take away AA and quotas, the umemployment rate of black men would rise to somewhere in the upper eighty percentile. Possibly that&rsquo;s even to low a number.</p>

			<p>A bus is running down the highway of life&rsquo;s future and having to stop all the darn time to allow these stragglers on who won&rsquo;t even run for the bus once it is stopped. No free person should have to be coerced into anything they will not willingly take the initiative to achieve. Why is it anyone&rsquo;s burden any longer to include those who will not willingly include themselves? </p>

			<p>We all know why blacks are behind in high-tech but I would like to add a second reason.</p>
<p>Blacks are behind on many things because they&rsquo;re stuck in the past looking for answers and reasons for their condition.</p>
<p>Blacks like to say, &#8216;you can&rsquo;t move forward until you know where you&rsquo;re been&rsquo; but this is pure foolishness. What matters is now and how you prepare for the future.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t move forward if you&rsquo;re always looking back. It&rsquo;s one thing to remember the past. It&rsquo;s another thing to obsess over it.</p>

			<p>I work in high tech Silicon Valley, and there are VERY few blacks in my environment.  There is a reason for that: they just don&rsquo;t have the intelligence to work and compete in this field.  </p>
<p>The tech industry requires an understanding of higher math, computer science, engineering, physics and even business administration.  Blacks are woefully underqualified and don&rsquo;t have the intellectual abilities to grasp these concepts.  </p>
<p>Now, The proposition that blacks should be given &#8220;skills training camps&#8221; instead of prison scares me.  I may have to work alongside some black ex-convict affirmative action case just because the government says there aren&rsquo;t enough blacks in the computer industry.  Hopefully, I&rsquo;ll be retired by then!</p>

<p><br>
If a group of people &#8220;are nearly unemployable in a knowledge-based economy,&#8221; then that group of people must be lacking in knowledge, no? </p>
<p>And when this is followed up by the statement &#8220;so investments in higher education and in high-skills job training will not reach them,&#8221; what is being implied is that that group of people are unreachable and ineducable, no?</p>
<p>Once again, a simple and robust (if unpleasant) explanation is staring us in the face   &mdash;   yet nobody wants to be the one to say it. <br>

			<p>Why should the government help people who wont help themselfes? There are millions of white people who could benefit from that same job training, and who would actually use it for their own good and that of their community. Trying to get black men to be productive is like trying to squeeze blood from a stone.</p>

<p> They also suffer because they are &#8216;encouraged&rsquo; to act like the &#8216;N&rsquo; Word&#8221;. Baggy pants? no problem, its a choice, its a &#8216;lifestyle&#8221;, I&rsquo;ll ignore it, I&rsquo;m a &#8220;liberal&#8221;. </p>
<p>The black community will have to lean on OBAMA, there will be no more excuses should he get in.</p>

			<p>The blacks are confused because in TV &amp; movies, they are lawyers, doctors, scientists, computer engineers, effective administrators etc&hellip; They can&rsquo;t figure out that this is fantasy, they think they should just be able to become doctors without comprehending that this requires discipline and long term sacrifice. Let&rsquo;s just start teaching them the reality of their abilities and start funneling most of them into low skilled labor but never ever hire them to work in your homes.</p>
<p>See what happened in S. Africa once people succumbed to the allure of easy domestic service which turned out to be one of their downfalls. Never ever get close and personal with these people otherwise you will pay one way or the other. Either you personally or socially by giving them the illusion that they are able to function at a human level and are equal to other higher functioning races. At some point they&rsquo;ll get disgruntled and angry that they don&rsquo;t have what you have worked so hard to have. Then it&rsquo;s payback time, take from whitey who makes them work for their money and food.</p>

			<p>It would ultimately help the black community if we stopped the dysgenic policies collectively known as &#8220;welfare&#8221;.  But I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll ever push for that.  In our inner cities we have reached the point of no return where the parents (actually the mother and her live in boyfriend of the month) are simply not capable of providing a home life conducive to education, no matter what is done about the schools.</p>
<p>The jobs even uneducated black men can do, such as landscaping or hanging dry wall, have all been given to illegal immigrants, which the Democrats favor.  So not even the Democrats really care about black unemployment anymore.</p>

			<p>The fact that whites far exceed blacks in education is obvious to blacks.  This accounts for the familiar cry by blacks of &#8220;give us more education&#8221;.  But blacks fail to understand that education cannot be handed out like a welfare check.  It is work.  It is work done without pay.  When you hear blacks cry out let us work but don&rsquo;t pay us, then you will know they have come to understand what it means to &ldquo;get educated&rdquo;.</p>

			<p>An exremely intelligent individual once spoke the truth. Paraphrased:</p>
<p>&#8220;I am inherently gloomy about the prospect of programs to help African-Americans because all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours whereas all the testing says not really. There is a natural desire that all human beings should be equal but people who have to deal with black employees find this not true.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not really so brilliant. Rather, just obvious. This statement took courage and he took a lot of flak. Reading the arguments refuting this is laughable.</p>

			<p>Funny, I&rsquo;ve been reading this same story, with minor variations, since perhaps 1963.</p>
<p>While Barack Obama apologizes for the &#8220;tragic&#8221; history of America, he totally misses the real point of his pious scolding.  The real tragedy of America, and the one which has proved utterly intractable, is that we imported a hopelessly incapable permanent underclass in the early years of this country, and worse, one that has proved prolific in terms of crime, social disruption, and worst of all, birthrate.</p>
<p>It was tantamount to actively planting weeds in a productive garden, and post-Sixties, fertilizing the weeds.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s funny you bring this up. Just yesterday I saw the X-files movie and the casting in a couple of roles was just laugh out loud pathetic. For those familiar with the series, Scully has now become a surgeon and at the beginning of the movie they show here having a video conference with one of her superiors about a controversial medical procedure. Well guess who Scully&rsquo;s superior was - a black woman of course. She gave of the vibe of a low level DMV clerk but was mouthing all of this technical medical jargon with a delivery that made it automatically clear she had no idea what she was saying. She was only on screen for couple minutes but it was some of the worst acting I ever saw in my life.</p>
<p>Then there was one of the main FBI agents working the case who was played by some rapper named XZIBIT. Imagine a rapper trying to deliver serious authoritative lines of somebody in the upper ranks of the FBI - you&rsquo;re right - a total disaster.</p>

This mind control/brain wash by the MSM is getting worse and worse. Blacks, being lower IQ, can&rsquo;t seem to differentiate reality and fantasy. They are angry that their kids are not doing well but can&rsquo;t put 2 &amp; 2 together that they are the cause of the problems not &#8216;the police&rsquo; or &#8216;the man&rsquo;. They also have no shame and would gladly mooch and beg and threaten others to get what they want.</p>
<p>I would be less irate if they put whites and even asians in roles that they usually play in real life. They are the ones who are usually the scientists, doctors, administrators, etc&hellip; This is believable. Not some primitive black dictating to whites and/or asians who have far outstripped them in real life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting tired of seeing Morgan Freeman and few others as the wise, knowing, kind, loveable, or the intelligent guy. He is not a typical black nor are many others who are seen as examples of black humans. The obamas(blacks) are not rational and we shouldn&rsquo;t be dealing with them as if they are.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s bad enough they see impossible false images of their race on TV, it&rsquo;s worse when they are told by the educational-industrial complex constantly for over a decade that they can &#8216;be anything they want to be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge joke among us White teachers when community activists or college recruiters ask black &#8216;students&rsquo; what they want to do with their lives. </p>
<p>We snicker as high school kids with second grade reading levels and state math tests in the second percentile raise their hands and loudly, proudly stand up and proclaim that they are going to be pediatricians, brain surgeons, entrepreneurs or lawyers. Of course, everyone claps and praises the little genius and tells him to &#8216;go for it!&rsquo; &#8216;go far!&rsquo;  This goes on all around the room, ad nauseum.</p>
<p>At no time are these kids told they don&rsquo;t have what it takes, will never have what it takes, or even what it takes to succeed  &mdash;  oh, such banal things as intelligence, hard work, focus, drive, a competitive spirit, curiosity.  There are no students with these characteristics in their school, no role models, and of course, the very few capable ones must be wary of accusations of acting White.</p>
<p>DH used to come home from graduation shaking his head, knowing the valedictorian and salutatorian of these schools, while being accepted by ivy league schools (with inferior SAT scores) do not have what it takes to succeed in a competitive university.<br>
After all, they&rsquo;ve been heaped with false praise, lauded, feted and told they&rsquo;ll &#8216;go far.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When it doesn&rsquo;t work out, as it won&rsquo;t (unless they major in black studies), they drop out or scream racism  &mdash;  angry, bitter, blaming Whites, of course for holding them back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a no win situation.</p>
<p>As one of my colleagues says:  &#8220;You can&rsquo;t pour brains into them!&#8221;</p>
<p>I would also add:  a work ethic, patience, perseverance, an ability to deal with rejection and failure, and above all, to stop blaming Whites for all of your problems.</p>

<p>Excellent points.</p>
<p>Viewing themselves as geniuses and delighting in their cleverness, the Hollywood geeks are convinced that inputting data to the masses depicting blacks in positions they could never attain will fool everybody into believing that what they are presenting is a picture of the way things really are, especially the kids, and such deviousness is just one step in their journey for a egalitarian society. They regard themselves as being so devilishly clever they can hardly contain their glee.</p>
<p>But, as is usually the case with self-appointed geniuses, they&rsquo;re much to silly and dimwitted to follow their pursuits to a logical conclusion, because they have no real understanding of the ramifications of their devious acts.  If they had better insight into what they are attempting, they would understand two things:  1) White children are exposed to the real world every day and the older they get, the more they are able to discern the differences between real life and false depictions on the movie screen.   Eventually most of them will realize that they have been taken, the same way they eventually realize they have been duped when they learn there&rsquo;s no Santa Claus, Easter Bunny or Tooth Fairy.  Just a few are too gullible to understand.</p>
<p>2)  These horrible caricatures of accomplished black professionals on the movie screen, as realist noted, fool blacks into believing all it takes to be a doctor is to carry a black bag and stethoscopes around his neck, and it&rsquo;s only necessary to  wear horned rimmed glasses and a grey suit to be a psychiatrist.  </p>
<p>When they bomb out miserably in school trying to learn subjects far simpler than what is necessary for these professional positions, their first and most vehement reaction is to blame whites, the system, society, or inadequate teaching, or not enough money for education, etc., rather than acknowledging that some people just do not have the mental power and/or dedication necessary to complete the required learning.  They watch the movies and can tell by looking at the black stars that they&rsquo;re as smart as they are, so what&rsquo;s the problem?</p>
<p>Expecting loud mouthed, low intellect blacks to see the difference between fantasy and reality is a recipe for disaster, as we are witnessing on a daily basis.  And, it will get far worse, because NOBODY is going to utter the truth.  NOBODY.</p>
<p>So as far as the duplicitous lot in Hollywood are concerned, they&rsquo;re just more of the same criminal ideologues who have a real problem with adequate comprehension as to what the real world is all about, just like their favorite boy, Karl Marx, who fully expected that workers would rise up against capitalists.  He was too naive to understand that the power within most every human of wanting to work for himself and not some vague state entity far over rides any desire to work for anyone or anything else.  Marx was the usual ideologue:  An educated, incompetent fool, exactly the same as what we endure today.</p>
<p>The new fools aren&rsquo;t so well educated and are less intelligent, and they are far more gullible and naive than most.  Take our boy Obama, for example,  who says he wants to give blacks reparations and put more teachers in the schools to elevate black financial standing and to assist them to learn on a higher level than what they are capable of.</p>
<p>Neither scheme will work.  They&rsquo;ll be broke in two years or less, and they won&rsquo;t learn no matter what kind of tricks are tried.</p>
<p>If a person can remain aloof and neutral to all this, he would stay entertained watching these fools running in circles trying to create a society that will never be, because a wealth of past experience has shown that such nonsense has been tried and failed many times throughout history.</p>
<p>The answer for whites who can is to live apart in a protected community, so the effects of this move toward insantiy is minimally experienced.  It won&rsquo;t be much longer that we will be fighting for our share of bread&hellip;&hellip;within the next 20 to 50 years, but sooner if the economy tanks&hellip;&hellip;and we or our heirs will be able to square things then.    </p>

Oh, there&rsquo;s probably SOME work available to you if you&rsquo;re searching 24/7.  It may not be what you want, but certainly you could still job-hunt 16/7 while working a 40 hour week.  What do you live on, unemployment?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got 3 part-time jobs (all of which have offered me more hours if I want them) and a small business.  </p>
<p>The impact of out-sourcing is not minimal by any means, but people who really want to work can find work.</p>
<p>Any kind of honest work is honorable work.  (Note: that&rsquo;s a traditional American value.)</p>

			<p>Getting special treatment, like more affirmative action to the black community, will not work. We have seen affirmative action fail, more then 50 years now. </p>
<p>Please &#8220;liberal phycos&#8221; wake up your a destructive force for America. Your not helping, black Americans do not need more (&#8220;racist anti-white&#8221;)affirmative action. </p>
<p>The real problem with black people is that they do not finish school. How are blacks ever going to learn to be part of a high-tech economy. When they do not finish school to even go to collage?</p>
<p>No more, no more to the no where inititives, they lead to no where.</p>
<p>The problem is not racism. Has any one given a look at black problems?&hellip;&hellip;..Yes they have always had a high crime rate. But the fact is the black community has become poorer, more drug use. More killings, rape and overall crime sense the end of segregation. So how can the problems blacks face not only here in America but world wide, be because of racism?&hellip; The same problems have happened in other nations where whites ruled. Now those nations are poorer, and have much more problems then under white rule.</p>
<p>Liberals blame whites for every thing wrong with blacks today. They blame racism on blacks problems like poverty, arrest, drug use, aids, murders, unemployment. But the fact is sense segregation blacks have actually become poorer. Blacks have actually quadrippled their numbers in jail. Murder is higher, rapes are greater, HIV is spreading, unemployment has exploded. </p>
<p>So how can it be racism that caused this?&hellip;.When under so called racism such as segregation, blacks actually did better. If blacks can do better under segregation, then it tells you something.</p>

			<p>If blacks are being &#8220;left behind&#8221; by the high tech industry, perhaps that is because there is not much demand for programmers and electrical engineers who are functionally illiterate.  What really fries my hide is that the same leftists who fret about blacks being &#8220;left behind&#8221; and expect us to fall into paroxysims of pity over it, as if this was our fault, see nothing wrong with a black high school mentioned in an article posted here a few weeks ago that only expects two hours of attendance per week out of its students.  The fact that these two hours per week are probably spent on fluff like &#8220;building self-esteem&#8221; does not make a substantial difference, as zero hours per week of genuine education is not a whole lot worse than two.</p>
<p>What ever happened to the concept of people being responsible for their own education?  This may mean busting one&rsquo;s hump in high school in order to get the grades necessary to get a college scholarship.  It may mean working full-time while taking night classes at a local community college.  At 42, I&rsquo;m back in college, working on a welding certificate, because nobody has figured out a way to offshore small machine shop repairs or welding work in the oil and gas industry.  Sure; it&rsquo;s not chemistry, and it&rsquo;s not my idea of a dream job, but as Russian Admiral Gorshkov used to say, &#8220;The Best if the Enemy of Good Enough.&#8221;  Community college tuition is cheap, and the classes are available at night, just so people who work 9-5 can still attend.</p>
<p>There are a lot of things one can do for a living out of one&rsquo;s house.  One of my friends in prison, a Jicarilla Apache used to make jewelry.  His sister sent the materials in, and he mailed the finished items out.  It was nice-looking stuff, and she was selling it on the reservation through a friend who owned a small store.  Another one was speculating in stocks, and was on the telephone with his broker several times a week.  Last spring, I made some artificial plants for the office where my wife works.  The ones you see at Wal Mart not onlyy look fake, but they tip over too easily.  I used real ceramic pots, and weighted them down with a layer of fist-sized streambed stones.  On top of this went spray foam insulation, and while that was hardening, the plant stems went in.  After the foam was hard, I painted it dark brown, and then added lava rock of the type sold for use in gas grills on top of that.  Last, the rest of the foliage went onto the stems.  After subtracting out the cost of the materials, I calculated I was making just over $25 an hour.  I got asked to do it by some of my wife&rsquo;s co-workers when they were over for dinner and admired a plant I had already made (they thought it was real).  One of my neighbors, a retired widow does pet grooming.  Another neighbor does advertising layouts on his home computer.  It must pay decently, because he is supporting a non-working wife and two kids, and with gas at $4 a gallon, I&rsquo;ll bet the lack of a commute helps.</p>
<p>High tech jobs are overrated.  I did that for almost ten years, which left me a blood pressure of 175/105 by my 31st birthday.  Now it&rsquo;s 85/45, so low I can&rsquo;t donate blood.  No medication was necessary to cut my BP by just over 50%; not working for jerks anymore did the trick.  Work as an engineer in the microelectronics industry consists of having a boss make crazy promises to customers and who then expects you to come up with a solution, preferably by yesterday.  If I could go back and do it all over again, I would have studied something like optometry instead of chemistry.</p>

			<p>On a note from way previously, about the new &#8216;X-files&rsquo; movie:</p>
<p>&#8220;Then there was one of the main FBI agents working the case who was played by some rapper named XZIBIT. Imagine a rapper trying to deliver serious authoritative lines of somebody in the upper ranks of the FBI - you&rsquo;re right - a total disaster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, I noticed that familiar face in a trailer for the new &#8216;X Files&rsquo; movie  &mdash;  it was indeed the rap &#8216;musician&rsquo; known as Xzibit. And my reaction  &mdash;  to a few seconds in a movie trailer, mind you  &mdash;  was exactly the same: what a joke, and an insult [I hope!] to the FBI.</p>
<p>For a much more credible appearance of this performer, see &#8220;Derailed&#8221;, starring Clive Owen and Jennifer Anniston. It&rsquo;s a &#8216;film noir&rsquo; about a married investment banker who falls for a  woman [Anniston] who is part of a con-artist team which blackmails his character. The rapper&rsquo;s character, as the thuggish &#8220;muscle&#8221; of the gang, fits my impression of the actor: obnoxious and violent  &mdash;  I don&rsquo;t think this this was a &#8220;stretch&#8221; for him, dramatically speaking. Surprisingly for this day and age, Mr. Xhibit&rsquo;s character ends up ventilated several times, 9mm style, by Owen&rsquo;s character in a chaotic, climactic gunfight. It&rsquo;s a great scene.</p>
<p>I enjoyed the movie, and recommend it, despite some obligatory &#8216;diversity&rsquo; propaganda. It&rsquo;s on cable and no doubt DVD.</p>
