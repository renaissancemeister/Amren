						<p>Andrew Leonard of Salon gives us Obama&rsquo;s thoughts (presented at a town hall meeting) about bilingual education:</p>
<blockquote>You know, I don&rsquo;t understand when people are going around worrying about, &#8220;We need to have English-only.&#8221; They want to pass a law, &#8220;We want English-only.&#8221;
<p>Now, I agree that immigrants should learn English. I agree with that. But understand this. Instead of worrying about whether immigrants can learn English &mdash; they&rsquo;ll learn English &mdash; you need to make sure your child can speak Spanish. You should be thinking about, how can your child become bilingual? We should have every child speaking more than one language.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s embarrassing when Europeans come over here, they all speak English, they speak French, they speak German. And then we go over to Europe, and all we can say [is], &#8220;Merci beaucoup.&#8221; Right?</p>
<p>You know, no, I&rsquo;m serious about this. We should understand that our young people, if you have a foreign language, that is a powerful tool to get ajob. You are so much more employable. You can be part of international business. So we should be emphasizing foreign languages in our schools from an early age, because children will actually learn a foreign language easier when they&rsquo;re 5, or 6, or 7 than when they&rsquo;re 46, like me.</blockquote></p>
<p>Whoa. Reporting live from the United Kingdom, I have been assured that the typical Brit does not speak many (i.e., any) languages other than English and a smattering of American. Apparently Obama is aware that culturally, Britain is not part of Europe, and he assumes we know it as well.</p>
<p>But the real comedy gold is this:<br>
<blockquote>Instead of worrying about whether immigrants can learn English &mdash; they&rsquo;ll learn English &mdash; you need to make sure your child can speak Spanish.</blockquote></p>
<p>Really? Will that help me or my children communicate with the immigrants from Vietnam, or China, or Poland? Who knew? <a href="https://www.cis.org/articles/2007/back1007.html" target="table4" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>Table 4</b></a> can help Obama&rsquo;s staffers figure out that if slightly more than half of recent immigrants to the Unite States are from Latin America, than sightly less than half are from other parts of the world.</p>
<p>Obama talked about this during the Univision debate last February. Frankly, I think teaching foreign languages at an earlier age in school makes lots of sense, but I wonder whether are public schools are doing so great a job on the Three Rs that we need to expand their mission.</p>
<p>LEFT UNREPORTED: How many languages does Barack speak? And how are his kids (ages 10 and 7) doing with their Spanish, or do they also embarrass him as the rest of us rubes do? I&rsquo;d hate to think this is one more &#8220;do as I say&#8221; scenario similar to Barack&rsquo;s no-smoking aspiration.</p>
<p>BONUS QUERY: Should that be &#8220;us rubes&#8221; or &#8220;we rubes&#8221;?<br>

			<p>Well I sure liked that bedtime story from Massa Obama. Wasn&rsquo;t there some article not too long ago that said that only four Afro-American LAPD officers could speak functional Spanish? (not that &#8220;functional Spanish&#8221; would do a cop much good in an LA Barrio anyway) </p>
<p>I teach Spanish and frequently get Afro-American pupils who for one reason or another think that in 10 weeks they&rsquo;re going to be promoted to Ambassador to Argentina. Most drop out about 30% through class. If Obama wants to hear some serious European laughter based on linguistics, he might try listening in on some Spaniards as they sneer and laugh at Mexican, Caribbean, and Chicano Spanish.  </p>
<p>Wholesale bilingualism among Afro-Americans simply ain&rsquo;t in the cards no matter how much mo&rsquo; betta Uncle Sugar Bucks Massa Obama can manage to toss at that windmill.</p>

			<p>Bilingualism has been a national mantra in Canada since the 1970s, and recent government reports indicate it did nothing to ensure all citizens across the country could speak both English and French with ease. Rather, Canada is still balkanized re: official language capability, with French speakers in Quebec and English speakers elsewhere. Even in New Brunswick, Canada&rsquo;s only officially bilingual province, the French and the English do not mix, despite common cultural values - the French are in the north, and the English are in the south.</p>
<p>But ever since bilingualism did become a national mantra, what did indeed happen was the rise of Quebec separatism, which has had a nasty effect on Canada&rsquo;s economy - one Quebec politician referred to it as a &#8220;never ending trip to the dentist&rsquo;s office.&#8221; Canada has endured two close breakups since bilingualism came about. Bottom line - Americans, don&rsquo;t listen to Obama!</p>

ALSO LEFT UNREPORTED:  How many languages does the average African American speak? LESS THAN ONE. </p>
<p>EXTRA BONUS QUERY:  Does Obama personally CARE which language(s) American kids speak   &mdash;   or is he just sucking up to the Mestizo vote because he knows hispanics have the power to ethnically-cleanse him from the White House race they way they&rsquo;re ethnically-cleansing his Soul Brothas in the LA ghetto? <br>

			<p>What the h@ll is he talking about?!?!  &#8220;International business&#8221;?!?!? Man, that boy is one high toned fool!  </p>
<p>Black teachers are sweating bullets because there are so many Mexicans in their schools they have to learn Spanish just to keep their jobs, and this high-yalla fool is telling them they need to learn a second language so they can get a great job in &#8220;International Business&#8221; and &#8220;go over to Europe&#8221;?</p>
<p>Yeah, Obama. Tell that to black folks in South Central LA who are being ethnically cleansed by Mexicans.  H@ll, forget Europe, Obama, bruthas in LA need to learn Spanish to know when to duck the pendejo&rsquo;s bullets!</p>
<p>I expect he IS embarrassed by dumb-as-a-box-of-rocks Americans. We&rsquo;re pretty stoopid, aren&rsquo;t we, Obama.  Not near as smart as your Harvard Law School and University of Chicago friends.</p>
<p>I swear, I just can&rsquo;t understand why regular everyday colored folk are wetting their pants over this guy. He has absolutely no use for them.</p>

			<p>&#8220;If you have a foreign language, that is a powerful tool to get a job.&#8221;  No actually, it`s not. Here in San Antonio, native Spanish speakers of which there are many, will always have the inside track because they simply can communicate better and on an even plane with other native Spanish speakers, of which there are many. Think I go to work to buy a car to go to work&hellip; For the same reason that most Americans refuse to speak with a guy in India who speaks poor &#8220;store bought&#8221;  English, most Spanish speakers will demand a native speaker of Spanish as well. Also, I have many times seen the non-native speaker of Spanish here in San Antonio try to polish their skills by addressing native Spanish speakers in Spanish. Most times they get an answer back in English. This is because native speakers don`t  like the idea  being your unpaid linguist. Or they feel the need to let you know that you are not a member of &#8220;their&#8221;&#8221; club no matter what language you address them in.  </p>

			<p>C&rsquo;mon, guys, I&rsquo;ll certainly not vote for Obama, a socialist who wants to destroy and remake our country as we know it, but the suggestion that American kids might do well to learn Spanish isn&rsquo;t totally unreasonable. And it certainly isn&rsquo;t mutually exclusive with the requirement that Hispanics living here should learn English.</p>
<p>First, learning any foreign language is a good intellectual exercise.  Two, Spanish is a logical choice, since we have a lot of Hispanics in this country at this point, giving any kids with some aptitude in the language plenty of opportunity to practice it, to say nothing of dealing successfully with the reality that there are 40 million of them in our midst and that being able to speak their language is a potentially large commercial opportunity.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, not everything that comes of Obama&rsquo;s mouth is idiotic, certainly no more so than what we get from that lip-bibbling ninny John McCain.</p>
<p>Christ, what a paucity of choices.</p>

			<p>I fully intend to embarass Obama all the way to the ballot box in November. I speak 4 languages, none of them Spanish. And he still thinks I&rsquo;m a clingy cracker rube. He&rsquo;s right, if clingy cracker rubes get teary-eyed at the Star Spangled Banner, thank soldiers, pay their taxes, and help stray animals. Oh, did I mention, clingy cracker rubes think they live in the greatest country in the world. </p>
<p>God, I love rubes!</p>

			<p>Yes Americans need to learn to speak Spanish, or rather &#8220;Spanglish&#8221; I speak as one who lost my job as a non-bilingual speaker. (Which here in Washington State means non-Spanish-speaking.)&#8221;Bi-lingual preferred&#8221; is PC speach here for only Hispanic need apply. I really have nothing agains speaking Spanish, I DO have something against having it shoved down my throat against my will in my own country! <br>
Half the kids in our country can&rsquo;t even speak or write English properly, much less another language.<br>
With the public school in the shape they&rsquo;re in I don&rsquo;t know how they are going to implement another course.   </p>

C-span ran yet another NAACP whine-fest. Jesse Jackson said that he encourages black kids to learn Spanish because English is a minority language in the western hemisphere and that like it or not, we have to communicate and get along with everyone here and in this hemisphere.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t even get black kids to learn English, for goodness sake, and Mr. Jackson thinks blacks will willing embrace learning Spanish to get along with their Hispanic brothers?</p>
<p>Most AR readers would welcome public schools that taught multiple languages to children at an early age as some European countries do. But how in heavens name does anyone believe this could be done with the racial makeup and racial demands by non-whites to teach everything except reading, &#8216;riting, and &#8216;rithmetic? We can&rsquo;t get blacks to perform at white grade levels and now we&rsquo;re supposed to believe they can learn a second language?</p>
<p>Yet another &#8216;i have a dream&rsquo;. I wish these people would wake up.<br>

I share the sentiment that &#8220;adios&#8221; and &#8220;expulsar&#8221; are the Spanish words we should learn. I&rsquo;d also like to know how to say &#8220;Please go back to your home country.&#8221; </p>
<p>It seems that Jesse Jackson is gong to teach Obama a new Spanish word  &mdash;  <i>cojones.</i> </p>
<p>Note to Peejay:  I don&rsquo;t want to be rude, but you need to learn your own language. That should be &#8220;enemy&rsquo;s,&#8221; not &#8220;enemies.&#8221; </p>

			<p>Can Obama make it any more clear where he is coming from and where he wants to take us.  I&rsquo;m over fifty and can remember when German and French were offered at my high school.  Yes, they offered Spanish too.  But, now it&rsquo;s all about teaching our American children the language of the invaders.  Don&rsquo;t worry about those Mexicans learning English, they will&hellip;maybe.  In the meanwhile though, we should just go on pressing 2 for English, slowing down the education of OUR citizens so, the illiterate invaders can keep up and just generally doing everything we can to make everyone but us feel comfortable in our country.</p>

			<p>When William the Conqueror invaded England in 1066, he made it a law that speaking English instead of French in the Anglo-Saxon kingdom was punishable by death.  As a result, he destroyed the culture of the Anglo-Saxons who inhabited England because when you take away the common language, you destroy the existing culture and the unity of its people.  William understood this invasion tactic in 1066, and he saw the destruction of Anglo-Saxon England in his lifetime. Why are Bwana Obama and his liberal zombies so oblivious to this? Or are they?  </p>

			<p>I want to learn good Castilian Spanish, not the Mexican Spanish I was taught in High School. Knowing Spanish will not get you a job. They only hire Spanish speakers whose first language was Spanish. It however will make easedropping more fun. You would not believe what they say when they think you cannot understand them!<br>
   I learned French before I traveled to Europe. I had no problems. Of course, I knew I would not have the State department providing a translater.<br>
  Does B; Huisien speak another language? Does he speak Russian as well as Condi Rice?</p>

			<p>How many bilingual blacks do you meet?  Not very many, I promise you.  As The Incredible Shrinking White Man posted, most of them really can&rsquo;t speak English.  They have a remarkable, across-the-board inability to master verb tenses, and usually have limited vocabularies.  Obamba is out of his mind if he thinks the average black is going to learn Spanish, or any second language.  </p>

			<p>In my opinion, English is the &#8220;universal&#8221; language; in other words, the best language to know for &#8220;international&#8221; activities. </p>
<p>Also, if I wish to learn a new language, it should be my choice; not the recommendation or &#8220;choice&#8221; of a divisive and Hispanic-pandering political hack.</p>
<p>Furthermore, how many Americans can afford to travel &#8220;around the world&#8221; these days?  Perhaps learning other languages is great for our rich global-trotting &#8220;ruling class,&#8221; but it hardly seems necessary for the bulk of America&rsquo;s suffering middle class.</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;American children should learn Spanish&#8221; statement is clearly an outrageous grab for the Hispanic vote, and it sounds down-right anti-American to me.  Then his further comments of &#8220;how embarrassed we should be in front of Europe&#8221; is just another America-bashing put down.  Add this to our &#8220;clinging to guns and religion&#8221; and &#8220;apathy towards anyone who is different,&#8221; and we all seem to be nothing but a bunch of backward red-neck morons who so desperately needs the ever-widening, all-knowing guidance of Messiah Obama and his fellow globalist elites.  </p>
<p>Finally, why the heck should our children learn Spanish unless we&rsquo;re expecting to completely surrender our country to Mexico?  I guess Obama feels that we should make this invasion as smooth and comfortable as possible for our Spanish-speaking invaders!</p>
<p>Honestly, take away the flowery speeches in front of thousands of adoring &#8220;gullibles,&#8221; and we have nothing but a blundering anti-American idiot!</p>
<p>I have one word for you, Barack Obama&hellip;  ADIOS - Like Yesterday!</p>

			<p>Hi folks,  this is what I posted at another article here (the one on swooning Canadians). I think it&rsquo;s more fitting to put it here.</p>
<p>Canadas need to swoon is much greater than any appeal Obama might have. That point should not be missed. Same holds for here.</p>
<p>But I have a question. Why in the world did they conduct this survey in Cananda?</p>
<p>Well, because they - the REAL OWNERS of this Country (and the WORLD) have big plans for Obama. My hunch is that they intend to make him the first President of MexAmeriCanada. Let&rsquo;s see.</p>

<p>After reading the &#8220;Again Please, In English&#8221; article I am even more convinced.</p>
<p>I have to confess that, every once in a while, I&rsquo;m in awe of the fact that the people in power, in charge of something so big, and so all-important, can be so incredibly short-sighted, bull-headed, and unrepentant. I believe that one of the reasons, perhaps time will show it to be the reason, is their obvious addiction to a priori thinking.</p>

			<p>Obama takes the time to say, condescendingly, that &#8220;You know, it&rsquo;s embarrassing when Europeans come over here, they all speak English, they speak French, they speak German. And then we go over to Europe, and all we can say [is], &ldquo;Merci beaucoup.&rdquo; Right?&#8221;</p>
<p>Aside from the fact that he is most definitely going to end up sticking his foot in his mouth with his Black constituency*, he is also making a fool of himself for not taking an important point into account and then relating it to us (that would take all the fun out of appearing superior - and this is a guy who, like the rest of the Elites, is addicted to mood-altering through intellectual and moral self-righteousness).</p>
<p>Europeans are geographically enmeshed.  They have HAD to learn each others language to communicate at all. Also, England became an Economic and Industrial world power as a result of its supplying all of Europe with everything it needed in order to defeat Napolean. And, of course, the educated European had been schooled in the classical languages of Greek and Latin for centuries - something that makes learning another language a lot easier. And, interestingly, this is, or was, a practice of Ivy League schools here. Ya know, like the one Obama went to.<br>
I always thought that with Ivy League schools you couldn&rsquo;t get in unless you spoke a second language, or at least couldn&rsquo;t get out until you did. He went, and can&rsquo;t speak a second language. Why not? </p>
<p>The USA on the other hand is a giant land mass with the Atlantic Ocean on side and the Pacific on the other. Canada above, almost entirely English speaking, and Mexico below, an alien and unfriendly neighbor whose border was desert country few Americans had any interest in crossing, with reason. What he is indirectly refering to, though I don&rsquo;t think he even knows this, is our Frontier Culture and the mentality that has come with it. And that IS a problem. It HAS created difficulties that DO need to be addressed. But he&rsquo;s not addressing them which makes me think he isn&rsquo;t aware of what he&rsquo;s saying.</p>
<p>But even more, there&rsquo;s this. WHAT SPANISH IS HE TALKING ABOUT?!?!?!?!?<br>
I know people from Argentina who can&rsquo;t understand Mexicans.<br>
The reason is simple. Since Latin America, including Mexico, has very low literacy (with the possible exception of Argentina) they all speak in lumfardos (slang).  Something similar to Black English. (remember the movie Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels when they had English subtitles for two guys speaking English? THAT&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m talking about, except worse).  If you speak a fluent, standard, correct Spanish to these guys, they&rsquo;ll start complaining about elitism and more &#8220;oppression&#8221;. Some of them might even take insult and become violent.<br>
The bottom line is all of this points to just how shallow and transparent Obama and his Bosses are.</p>
<p>*Show of hands for those of you who think that Obama&rsquo;s Black Constiuency will heed his call and stampede to the nearest Berlitz to sign up for Spanish classes. Blacks supporint Obama because he&rsquo;s Black are in for a big surprise when it becomes undeniably obvious where his REAL loyalties lie.<br>

			<p>I&rsquo;d also like to know how to say &ldquo;Please go back to your home country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here are some options.  (I&rsquo;m not a native speaker, but I am very fluent.):</p>
<p>(1) Por favor vuelva (or vuelve) a tu (or su) propio pais.<br>
(2) Favor de regresar a tu (or su) patria.</p>
<p>Although I speak fluent Spanish, I think it is outrageous that monolingual Americans are being discriminated against.  I am all for learning foreign languages, but I see no reason why English should not be the official language of the U.S.</p>

<p>I am at a summer language program at an esteemed university and there are practically none, save for a couple in the easy languages, like Spanish and french.  In the more difficult languages, you guessed it  &mdash;  zippo.</p>

			<p>I know only one phrase in about 6 different languages, &#8216;Thanks, same to you&rsquo;. </p>
<p>In Spanish that&rsquo;s Gracias a ti</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not an exact translation, and in fact there may not be an English phrase that approximates the meaning of Gracias a ti</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite an interesting phrase. </p>

			<p>Re: flying tiger at 1:24AM.  When I was in high school a long time ago, I took two years of Castilian Spanish.  Much of the course content centered on the culture of Spain.  A few years later I spent a couple of years in Florida before settling in the Southwest.  My Spanish wasn&rsquo;t that bad, but everyone (Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Mexicans, Colombians, ect) were constantly correcting me.  Believe me, the Spanish language of the Latin and South American countries are NOT the same.  So, I have not even tried to speak the language for the last twenty-five years.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Does B; Huisien speak another language? Does he speak Russian as well as Condi Rice?&#8221;</p>
<p>Rice is in the news today, because of an Iranian missile test. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s intended to be funny or not, but I think it&rsquo;s pretty funny. She&rsquo;s in Russia promoting a missile defense shield, saying, &#8220;Your missiles wont work&#8221;</p>
<p>Funny to me! I have been drinking some. . <br>

			<p>I think it&rsquo;s hilarious that B.O. keeps insulting Americans across the board.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also thoroughly enjoying the English that I read here, but of course not at all in the same manner.  It is good to see what is written here!  </p>
<p>Ms. Parker, amen!   However, I don&rsquo;t think we need to go to such an extreme&hellip; </p>
<p>Peejay, your point is also a matter of degree.  Having people on your side who know your enemies is indispensable, but forcing the entire population to adopt a language is another thing entirely, as Ms. Parker points out so well. </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my 2 cents on this, the perspective of one American who has studied many languages (quite successfully, BTW): I think we&rsquo;ll be better off promoting English skills, and the government has no business telling anybody they must learn any foreign language anyway.  </p>
<p>(Man, it pisses me off to have to &#8220;press one for English&#8221; when I&rsquo;m in the U.S.!)</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;d say that raising the standard of English used in our society is vital.  Too many people are satisfied with vague allusions peppered with buzz-words, and seem incapable of communicating in clear, well-thought out, logical language. </p>
<p>Words are thinking tools as well as means of communication.  A higher-order tool-box allows higher-order thinking.  </p>
<p>By the way, the foreign language that helped me the most in terms of clarifying the rules of grammar was German. Also, the influence of Latin &amp; Greek on English was made clear to me as a young boy.  You see, my mother had a graduate degree- in English.  </p>
<p>Here is another thought on the matter: I have never heard anything about Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Horace Smith &amp; Daniel Wesson, Wilbur &amp; Orville Wright, Mark Twain, Robert Frost, George Washington,  or Thomas Jefferson (to name but a few important Americans) ever speaking anything other than English.</p>
<p>To the ever-condescending Barack Hussein Obama (who I hear does not even posses the skills he is insulting Americans in general for not having, even though many actually do):  &#8220;Abbes etiam a consilio insultandi mihi nisi latine loqui scias.&#8221;  (Don&rsquo;t even think of dissing me unless you speak Latin.)</p>

			<p>The objection some posters have of some of us being against Spanish is misplaced. If they would read the anti-Spanish posts clearly, it would show that most people are against Spanish because there is an agenda behind this push towards Spanish. This is not some innocent sentiment about the value of  language. If it were, why all of the emphasis on Spanish, suddenly, in the main stream media, the newspapers, the constant injecting of little bits of Spanish into commercials, etc. etc. Give me a break. This stuff never went on before, did it?  </p>

			<p>As some of you may recall from my previous posts,I am in Iraq and have been for nearly 5 years. I work in the field with the Marines and often with the Iraqi Police and Iraqi Army units at the field stations (OPs, CP, ECPs and such) and even as far as I have been I find many, many Iraqis speak fair English and as far as I know I am the only white American that can speak Arabic. I generally do not let on to the locals that I understand most of their language because they say things not meant for American ears, since as far as they know, NO AMERICANS SPEAK ARABIC!! I do not speak Spanish though, not a word but I am not in Spain or Mexico.</p>

			<p>Spanish is a white European dialect like English or French or Russian etc.<br>
Spain conquered the aztec indian ex Asian migrants and killed off the bad ones and trained the others to speak their white tongue and learn their culture and white man religion. <br>
Obama is ignorant of history like these mexicans who speak white mans tongue Spanish. </p>

			<p>You know something, I am taking Spanish classes but not to accomodate the third world refuse pouring in here from Mexico.  I&rsquo;m learning Spanish because I plan on living in Argentina in the next couple of years.  For anyone interested, you can obtain a Visa much easier there than in Europe, if you can provide proof of a steady income (I think it was $800 a month the last time I checked) from a pension, Social Security, etc. and don&rsquo;t plan to work in the economy.  Check it out, it&rsquo;s a beautiful place with a cosmopolitan (not in a bad way like in the US) population and an intact Western culture.  </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m right there with you on that. I teach Spanish and my wife and I have often discussed relocating. We originally were thinking of Spain but sadly, Africans and other third worlders will soon obliterate Spain as we once knew it.<br>
Argentina would be great albeit historically it hasn&rsquo;t been real stable politically and there was also La Guerra Sucia before and during the Falklands War.  The economy is growing again. The thing that&rsquo;s stopping us are our children and grandchildren. We just couldn&rsquo;t leave them. Everyone we love is here. It&rsquo;s just so far. We should have made that decision when we were younger and should have seen the writing on the wall.<br>
You&rsquo;re right about the population of Argentina being overwhelmingly of European stock, largely Spanish, Italian and German. Argentine Spanish, especially in Buenos Aires, has a distinctly Italian inflection. I wish you well.<br>
¡Muy buena suerte Che!<br>

<p>Hi Skip. Please let me know if I am mistaken, but I thought Americans serving in Iraq were not allowed to post at places like these - that their servers or whatever prohibit it.  Just wondering.<br>
I would also LOVE to know what those serving in Iraq think about what is going on in general in the USA. Are you allowed to discuss such things?<br>
All the best.</p>

			<p>&#8220;You know, it&rsquo;s embarrassing when Europeans come over here, they all speak English, they speak French, they speak German. And then we go over to Europe, and all we can say [is], &ldquo;Merci beaucoup.&rdquo; Right?&#8221;</p>
<p>You think maybe it&rsquo;s more embarrassing for a European tourist to hear some Afro-American in a doo rag and a big sloppy football shirt speaking the &#8220;jive&#8221;.  Honestly, do blacks in West Africa or Brazil speak some kind of ebony phonics French or black Portuguese or is it just America that has uniquely dumber blacks?</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve been going to the same Mexican restaurant for about 15 years most every weekend since they opened. The Hispanic manager was in my Spanish class in high school. He took over his father&rsquo;s position at the restaurant when he graduated. Jose, the manager; has a son, born in the U.S., who can&rsquo;t speak a lick of Spanish. I believe Jose is proud of that fact. He hasn&rsquo;t wanted his son to learn Spanish. </p>
<p>This is the way legal immigrants viewed their position in the U.S. 20 years ago. They did a better job of trying to seem that they wanted to assimilate. They don&rsquo;t have to pretend as much anymore. </p>
<p>Does Obama know Spanish? Spanish he could actually use, as he alludes to?   </p>

			<p>I have very little respect for nitwits who come to this country and can&rsquo;t be bothered to learn the language. But we live in a global economy and learning languages, Spanish in particular, since millions of people on the American continents speak it, is useful. That&rsquo;s a reality that isn&rsquo;t going to change no matter how much some people treasure their ignorance. If your kids don&rsquo;t learn languages they will probably suffer. My kids speak Spanish. I speak it too. Not because I think immigrants shouldn&rsquo;t have to learn English and I do think we should have an official language law, by the way so that government offices are not required to post information in Spanish or any other language. But the world economy is going to get more competitive by the day and if you&rsquo;re a working class person who thinks your kids are going to be able to be complacently ignorant and they&rsquo;ll float along through life rethink it. For their sakes. Make them learn languages. Really.  </p>

			<p>As a Canadian I feel compelled to speak up here. Many Americans are buying the same propaganda Canadians were sold about the French language in the 1960&rsquo;s. Now IT IS TRUE that there is NOTHING WRONG with learning another language. This does not mean that a country should attempt to function in two languages. There is all the difference in the world between personal bilingualism and state bilingualism. They are not the same thing.</p>

<p>There are more Chinese in China than there are hispanics in all the Western Hemisphere but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m going to run out and learn Chinese or Hindi for that matter.  The language of global commerce is English and if countries want to do business with us they&rsquo;ll learn English.  </p>
