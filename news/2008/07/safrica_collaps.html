<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>A surprise visit to the overburdened maternity section of East London&rsquo;s Frere Hospital has led to Nozizwe Madlala-Routledge, the deputy health minister, describing the situation as a &#8220;national emergency&#8221;.</p>
<p>The minister found acute shortages of staff and equipment, and situations in which nurses had to &#8220;play God&#8221; &mdash; deciding who would live and who would die.</p>
<p>The hospital was simply not equipped to save the lives of the increasing number of underweight newborn babies, the victims of Aids, poverty and drug abuse. Very small babies were sometimes regarded as stillborn, nurses admitted to the deputy health minister.</p>
<p>A distressed Madlala-Routledge said she saw Frere&rsquo;s combination of problems as an example of a massive systemic crisis, which threatened a breakdown in the delivery of healthcare.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly, with those kinds of babies referred to it, that hospital needs to be reviewed&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;It really shows what is a national emergency, in my view, particularly with infant mortality seen as an important human-development indicator,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>South Africa&rsquo;s human-development indicator has been declining continuously, and much of it is blamed on infant mortality, according to United Nations Development Programme sources.</p>
<p>The deputy minister&rsquo;s unannounced two-hour visit to the hospital followed a report in East London&rsquo;s Daily Dispatch this week, which suggested the problems at Frere had led to the deaths of hundreds of babies every year.</p>
<p>A total of 2 000 babies have been stillborn at Frere in the past 14 years and last year&rsquo;s figures appeared to be the highest &mdash; a record 199. Maternal death rates are also increasing.</p>
<p>Hospital staff conceded in documents that &#8220;most&#8221; maternal deaths and stillbirths could have been avoided.</p>
<p>Most mothers with complicated pregnancies in the eastern part of the province are referred to the Frere&rsquo;s maternity section.</p>
<p>The Sunday Independent accompanied the minister on her visit and observed nursing staff dashing from one tiny baby to the next. With only five incubators available on the ward, nurses said they were not equipped to save many of them.</p>
<p>In emergency theatres and a post-natal care unit for babies with problems, nurses spoke of major staff shortages &mdash; the number of senior nurses had decreased by more than 50 percent since the 1990s.</p>
<p>Since January, the maternity section at Frere has lost 15 key staff. It could take years for critical posts to be filled.</p>
<p>There was also a shortage of clerical staff and porters and, consequently, nurses were spending too much time on paperwork and on moving patients between units.</p>
<p>Internal documents reveal that senior management has known for years that the situation is out of control but has done little to address the crisis.</p>
<p>In the maternity section, nurses had only two instruments to measure high blood pressure, one of the key risk factors among pregnant South African women. It also had only two machines to monitor the heartbeats of babies during labour.</p>
<p>Frere is an academic hospital where nurses undergo basic training and this stretches human resources even further.</p>
<p>On most days, only two sisters are in charge of the emergency delivery ward, where about 10 Cesarean sections are done and most other births are accompanied by complications. One of the nurses has to supervise training while carrying out her duties.</p>
<p>Many recently graduated nurses are now appointed to senior posts because experienced nurses are no longer willing to work under the stressful conditions.</p>
<p>Madlala-Routledge reiterated her controversial stand that a rapid review of the healthcare system was urgently needed.</p>
<p>She made a similar appeal in an internal document earlier this year but got short shrift from her cabinet colleagues.</p>
<p>After her visit to Frere, Madlala-Routledge was adamant that the shortages were &#8220;acute&#8221; and the turnover &#8220;just too high&#8221;.</p>
<p>Of the nurses, she said: &#8220;They are totally overstretched. It has gone so far that it needs a real, comprehensive intervention.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, with those kinds of babies referred to it, that hospital needs to be reviewed.</p>
<p>&#8220;The staff was burning out fast! I was humbled by their dedication and passion for the profession.</p>
<p>&#8220;What upset me was that they have to play God and make decisions, which must be very difficult for people who are healers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madlala-Routledge said the crisis highlighted a need for a national investigation to go to the heart of planning, budgeting and allocating money.</p>
<p>&#8220;We really need to understand why people are dying. It warrants a rapid review [of the national health system].</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to understand exactly what money is being spent on, [and] whether the limited resources are deployed efficiently.&#8221;</p>
<p>Earlier this year her review plan was rejected by both the ANC and the government.</p>
<p>The treasury has since called for a systemic review of delivery in key social services, particularly health and education.</p>
<p>A confidential internal report on maternal deaths has already urged a serious intervention by the department.</p>
<p>On Friday, Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, the minister of health, announced substantial salary increases for the country&rsquo;s overworked nurses.<br>

			<p>How much longer will the world blame apartheid for South Africa&rsquo;s problems?  Here&rsquo;s an analogy those in the medical field should appreciate: the wrong diagnosis leads to the wrong treatment and the patient doesn&rsquo;t get better.  South Africa, as a whole, is the patient and the world is treating it as if its illness is caused by apartheid.  This is why it will never get better.  As whites continue to flee that failed country, things will progressively get worse.</p>

			<p>But they have the cash to spend on new soccer stadiums for the FIFA World Cup in 2010 and even stopped the building of one hospital to divert funds for this reason.   Such actions never happened in the days of Apartheid when the country was run well, even with international sanctions in place.  I know as I lived there until I escaped five years after the ex-terror movement, the African National Congress was voted by a ecstatic black masses into government, masses who believed the impossible lies that they would all have a job, a big house, a car etc.</p>
<p>Another Zimbabwe in the making.</p>

			<p>I think I might have saved a life last week. Our down the street neighbor told us she was going to visit South Africa with her husband. I told her to look up &#8220;The Death of South Africa&#8221; on her computer. And maybe some rape statistics as well.  I haven`t seen her since. I think she was what we used to call &#8220;scared straight.&#8221;  I feel better about them never talking to me again for ruining their vacation plans  than knowing I might have watched them fly off to their doom. Watching the tourists kidnapped, raped and hacked to death  while on Safari on last nights &#8220;Locked Up Abroad&#8221; seemed to bear my position out&hellip;</p>

<p><br>
No.  The crisis highlights a need to go to the ART of planning, budgeting, and allocating money.  And also having the heart NOT to stuff your own coffers with &#8220;mis-deployed&#8221; money at the expense of infants.</p>
<p>Typical.</p>

			<p>It makes sense that if the growth in white power and presence provided the means for the back population of Africa to expand, then the forced diminishment of that power and presence will naturally lead to the black population shrinking.  When it shrinks, these are some of the unpleasant things that must happen.</p>

			<p>Blacks excell at nothing but robbery, murder &amp; rape. Look what Mugabe has done to his own country &amp; people. Once the &#8220;Pearl of Africa&#8221; as Rhodesia, Zimbabwe is a sewer. S. Africa is speedily heading the same direction. The simple equation is that fewer whites = greater dysfunction within their society. Amazing that in the 21st century most native born Africans alive today are still as primitive as they were in the 16th century.</p>

			<p>Are S.A blacks better off now than they were in 1994? Or worse off? </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a rhetorical question  &mdash;  although just asking it could get me in big trouble (I am supposed to assume yes, although news reports seem to skirt this). </p>
<p>Yes there are black S.A. billionaires, but what about the average S.A. Black. I would really like to know.</p>

			<p>South Africa is in jeopardy of being replaced as the location of World Cup 2010! Let&rsquo;s say that &#8216;South African time&rsquo; is not equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time. Fifa&rsquo;s plan is influenced by their considering the hypothetical situation: &#8220;if a natural catastrophe forces it away from South Africa.&#8221; </p>
<p>I find this situation funny and unfortunate. As much as I will be disgusted by hearing monologues like: &#8220;Since the fall of Apartheid, South Africa has become a global leader in Information Technology and Johannesburg has the highest average income in all of South Africa&hellip;.&#8221; I would have likened the multiculturist&rsquo;s experience to that of a having to eat an absolutely disgusting meal that a loved one has prepared especially for you; you have to smile and eat it.</p>

			<p>Ah..summertime in Geneva Switzerland. What a delightful country.<br>
Alpine scenery, immaculate towns, sidewalk cafes. And the <br>
overwhelming sight of hundreds of Mercedes limos with their<br>
windows blacked out driving from gated lakefront villas<br>
to the downtown banks. Oh look..there is another African black dictator with his henchmen carrying attache cases full of money<br>
going into the bank.<br>
Oh look.. in the car behind is his 3 mistresses on the way to a<br>
little shopping spree.</p>
<p>A  vision of the real meaning of &#8220;Post Colonial Africa&#8221;<br>
as observed by this America in Switzerland a couple years ago.</p>
