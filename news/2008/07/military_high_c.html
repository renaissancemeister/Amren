						<p>A U.S. Army soldier who espoused racist views in an Internet profile was exercising his right to free speech, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces ruled Wednesday.</p>
<p>Nearly eight years ago, military prosecutors charged Pfc. Jeremy T. Wilcox with making statements online that discredited the Armed Forces and were detrimental to good order and discipline.</p>
<p>Wilcox was also accused of several other charges &mdash; including violating military rules by attending a Ku Klux Klan rally and encouraging participation in extremist organizations. Those charges were resolved separately and not part of the appeal to the Washington, D.C.-based military high court.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the conclusion of his court martial, Wilcox, who was originally from Idaho Falls, Idaho, but was serving with the 82nd Airborne Division in Fort Bragg, N.C., was sentenced to eight months confinement, a bad-conduct discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade. The court decision did not indicate what portion of the sentence applied to the charges at issue in Wednesday&rsquo;s ruling.</p>
<p>In a 4-to-1 decision, the military&rsquo;s highest court found that Wilcox&rsquo;s statements didn&rsquo;t go far enough to justify criminal charges.</p>
<p>The investigator&rsquo;s testimony showed that Wilcox &#8220;held beliefs that are both disturbing and inconsistent with Department of Defense policies regarding racial equality and other matters,&#8221; the high court found. But Wilcox&rsquo;s defense lawyers were able to show that he had good working relationships with minorities in his unit, and that there was no evidence that his racist views adversely affected his military performance.</p>
<p>Though members of the military don&rsquo;t have the same free speech rights as other civilians because their speech must be weighed against military interests, the court found that Wilcox&rsquo;s statements were still protected. Wilcox thought he was making the statements to a like-minded civilian friend, not to his fellow soldiers, the court noted.</p>
<p>The court took special care to distance itself from Wilcox&rsquo;s beliefs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The case now returns to the military Court of Criminal Appeals so Wilcox&rsquo;s sentence can be reassessed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Chief Judge Andrew Effron and Judges Charles Erdmann, Scott Stucky and Margaret Ryan signed the majority opinion. Judge James Baker was the lone dissenter, contending that Wilcox&rsquo;s behavior did discredit the service because it was contrary to military policy and values and could hurt recruiting efforts. Failing to punish that conduct suggests to the public that the military tolerates the poor behavior, Baker wrote.</p>

			<p>Non-white racism in the military, as in the private sector, far outweighs white racism.  I would venture to say that at least 80% of all blacks are anti-white and fixated on anythng they believe might be beneficial to them as a racial group, again just as it is in the private sector.</p>
<p>What the naive, gullible elites have to somehow learn is that because blacks want to have sex with a woman regardless of her race, he still resents and dislikes her if she&rsquo;s not black and especially if she&rsquo;s white.  The elites naively seem to think that blacks indicate non-racial attitudes by pursuing women of other races without considering anything further.  </p>
<p>Dumb?  Yes, but nobody ever accusedelites of being street smart.</p>

			<p>What is conspicuously absent from this article is the alleged racist speech.  What is it that he said?  This is another example of poor reporting.  It must have been harmless or maybe had a ring of truth to it, since the court found him not guilty and the liberal AP press isn&rsquo;t reporting what he said.</p>

			<p>What is racist speech?  Is the truth a defense?  </p>
<p>If a person points out there were about 36,000 black on white rapes but almost zero white on black rapes in the same year, is that racist?  </p>
<p>If a person complains about the rampant Affirmative Action programs that promote minorities over better qualified whites, is that racist?  </p>

<p>As the court has found there was no poor behavior. The Army disregards this man&rsquo;s private believes and his free speach right. It was a rule in the communist Russia, where I grew up, to punish for not supporting the official propaganda. It is a horror, when in the &#8216;free&rsquo; country a man, defending this country, is sued not for a bad behavior (which was not found) but for his personal view.<br>

			<p>What gets me is that, in another version of this article from a Bellingham, Washington newspaper, some woman is quoted now as worrying that the white sheet group and the bent cross group is going to take over the U.S. Armed Forces.  (No, her name was not Heidi Beirich).  You figure, with all the black and Hispanic gangs running almost amouck, this person frets about one white man.</p>

			<p>Is the Dept of Defense also concerned about the disturbing racial/racist views of those soldiers who profess to be members or have been seen at events of the Nation of Islam, the NAACP, Reverend Wright&rsquo;s church or other black churches where racist views are openly professed?    </p>

			<p>From the original article:<br>
&#8220;What parents would want their daughter or son to serve in a unit they thought might be infected with white supremacists and closet skinheads? What soldier (other than a white supremacist) would want to have &#8216;Wskullhead&rsquo; on his right or his left in combat?&#8221; Baker asked.</p>
<p>What citizen would want to stand before a judge, albeit a military one, who does not believe in free speech? What soldier(other than a soldier of the Red Army) would wish to serve under an Officer who would persecute him for political statements made while off duty to someone online and not in his unit?</p>

			<p>He deserved to be singled out because, I mean, after all, no Black in the Military would EVER speak the way this man spoke about members of another Race.  Or so the MSM so informs us, in one way or another.</p>
<p>Joking aside; any of you ever see Jar Head?  What was that if not anti-White and anti-Military. Hollywood and the rest of the Media Elites smugness is literally psychotic.  Meaning, it NEVER deviates. I call it the Broken Clock Syndrome. Strictly speaking, a broken clock is &#8220;right&#8221; twice a day.  <br>
But, actually, of course, it&rsquo;s never right because it&rsquo;s always broken.  <br>
All their movies are the same. Stories, Topics, Characters.  There is not a hell of a lot of range and depth.<br>
Big Business - Bad.<br>
Military - Very Bad.<br>
Big Business in bed with the Military - Way Bad.<br>
The only &#8220;good&#8221; people found in either group are the ones who have an &#8220;awakening&#8221; and come around to the Media Elites way of thinking. BORING.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more variety to the characters in Amatuer Porn.</p>
<p>Or so I&rsquo;m told.</p>

			<p><i>That&rsquo;s when a military investigator went undercover, posing as a young woman interested in the white supremacist movement and recording her online conversations with Wilcox, who also referred to himself as &#8220;Wskullhead.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>The internet   &mdash;   where the men are men, the women are men, and the children are FBI agents.  I think any outspokenly pro-white man who suddenly finds himself to be an object of fascination by the opposite sex can safely assume he is being set up.</p>
<p><i>Wilcox &ldquo;held beliefs that are both disturbing and inconsistent with Department of Defense policies regarding racial equality and other matters,&rdquo; the high court found.<i></i></i></p>
<p>I too do not believe in racial equality, other than in a strict legal sense (equality under the law).  After all, it conflicts with the plain evidence of my senses.  So I am happy to hear I won&rsquo;t qualify for military service, because it was never my desire to visit exotic foreign lands and kill people.  Throughout my lifetime I&rsquo;ve never seen our military used to defend my own country, except for a few months when it looked like they were actually trying to get bin Laden.<br>

			<p>The US military has become a self-disgracing entity.  How DARE they accuse Wilcox of bringing &#8216;discredit&rsquo; onto the armed forces?</p>
<p>&#8220;Waterboarding isn&rsquo;t torture.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Menacing POWs with dogs is not a violation of the Geneva Convention.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither is stacking them naked in homosexual positons.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The School of the Americas never taught torture techniques.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Soldiers don&rsquo;t really need armored Hummers or hard trauma plates for their PASGT vests.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Navy personnel really enjoy it when uniforms containing polyester melt onto their skin in shipboard fires.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Deploying armor on the ground in Mogadishu would needlessly provoke the locals.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your sworn oath to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic means we can give you a bad-conduct discharge if you refuse to put on a blue UN helmet.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry it worked out that way for Wilcox.  Naive people usually end up getting blindsided.</p>

			<p> 80% of the casualties in Iraq are white people. We do all we can to kill white people. Its what we do best.(our country) That guy is right black recruitment and women enlistment is way down. How about an affirmative action draft to equal things out? If the blacks are not joining why do whites join an organization that takes their rights away and abuses them? Every thing in this country is out of wack and its been like that since the sixties. The rich and powerful have always stuck it to the poor and powerless though. That will never change.</p>

I bet you could say all those things, seriously, in the military and still be considered some degree of cool. But say, &#8216;the military shouldn&rsquo;t use affirmative action&rsquo; and you&rsquo;re liable to be given a bad conduct discharge. </p>

			<p>The United States Army also teaches the idea that only whites are racist.  According to the Army&rsquo;s Equal Opportunity Program, the white race is the only race capable of practicing discrimination, being prejudice, and being racist.  In fact, every example in the numerous Army equal opportunity publications, place white soldiers as being racist and minorities as the victims.  In addition, the Army teaches Soldiers that minorities contributed more to American society than White-Americans.
