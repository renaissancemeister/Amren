						<p>An Associated Press-Yahoo News poll found differences in how engaged various groups of voters are in the presidential campaign.</p>
<p>A RACIAL GAP</p>
<p>In the AP-Yahoo News poll conducted in June, 49 percent of blacks said they are excited by the election campaign, compared to 16 percent of whites. Enthusiasm by African-Americans has also grown far more: 32 percent more African-Americans and just 6 percent more whites say they are excited now than said so in an AP-Yahoo News survey in November.</p>
<p>DIVIDES AMONG WHITES</p>
<p>Whites who say they are not excited by the campaign back Republican John McCain by a 2-to-1 margin. Whites who say the election is exciting lean toward Democrat Barack Obama, by 2-to-1. Overall, 46 percent of whites said they were interested in the presidential race in November while just 41 percent say so now.</p>
<p>POLITICS CAN BE A DRAG</p>
<p>Independents are more bored with the campaign than any other group of people &mdash; 28 percent of them say so. {snip}</p>
<p>ONLINE POLITICAL ACTIVITY IS LIMITED  .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>Between six in 10 and nine in 10 say they have never used the Internet for politics, varying by activity. Obama supporters are slightly likelier than McCain&rsquo;s to go online for politics. Overall, the most active tend to be younger, better-educated and higher-earning people. {snip}</p>
<p> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  WHILE OTHER POLITICAL ACTIVITY REMAINS LOW</p>
<p>Few say they have engaged in any recent political activity. {snip}<br>

			<p>What they forgot about Obama vs McCain polls is the Bradley Effect.  Whenever I see such a poll these days, I subtract 5 from Obama and add 5 to McCain, and that&rsquo;s what the poll would read if whites weren&rsquo;t posturing to the pollster.</p>

			<p>What&rsquo;s there to be excited about?  This years Presidential Election is rigged so that White voters have no choice but to vote for McCain and keep the neocon power structure in place.  </p>

Overall, 46 percent of whites said they were interested in the presidential race in November while just 41 percent say so now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, going by the above it looks like Comrade Obama will likely get a serious thumping in the Fall; the 84% of whites who are not excited by this bad joke of an election, can be seen as the &#8220;silent majority&#8221; of 2008, that Nixon spoke of in 1968. They are not pleased at electing McCain to the White House, as they know him for the grating and pompous jackass that he is. However, they have enough sense (or at least cynicism) to see that he (while not offering &#8220;hope&#8221; or &#8220;change&#8221;) will be a a more stable president, than the absurdly inexperienced Comrade Obama. I believe that McCain will get about about 59% to 62% of the white vote, and that he will carry Michigan and Pennsylvania; this will be enough to toss him over the top, and then some. </p>
<p>Despite all of the media&rsquo;s near orgasmic hoopla over Comrade Obama possibly carrying some &#8220;red states,&#8221; I doubt if the map of 2004 will be much changed in his favor. </p>
<p>I cannot say that I am even remotely enthusiastic at the prospect of a McCain &#8220;presidency,&#8221; but we will at least survive it.</p>
<p>What a telling sign of the times, that this is the &#8220;best&#8221; we can hope for.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all<br>

I feel that this will become a Ron Paul election hype again. Obama racks in the money like Ron Paul did, he controls the internet like Paul did. Obama controls the left wing media, and papers. But Obamas supporters only use the internet, their other political activity reamains low. So the question is will the Obama supporters come out to vote? </p>

			<p>So true. I am the least excited I have ever been in all my voting years, and for the first time in my life, I find myself one of those &#8220;undecided voters&#8221; that I used to look upon with disdain. When both candidates are as appealing as a rotting fish, it makes the decision very hard. If I can write in Ron Paul, I will. </p>

			<p>You know what&rsquo;s so pathetic about this whole election is that Clinton would&rsquo;ve have trounced McCain.  Most conservatives would&rsquo;ve have stayed home to burn the neocons and there would&rsquo;ve been a Democrat Congress and a President in November.  Maybe the superdelegates need to think about that at the convention when they&rsquo;re casting their votes?</p>

			<p>Only 16 percent of whites say they are excited by the campaign  &mdash;   yes, that&rsquo;s excellent news for us, and bad news for Obama. All the excitement about his campaign might turn out to be a manufactured product of the left-wing media. </p>
<p>A little-known piece of history:  When McGovern ran against Nixon in 1972, primarily on an anti-war platform, he drew <b>enormous</b> crowds whenver he gave a speech. This looked like a wave of enthusiasm for him to any naive journalist covering the campaign. But in fact, those crowds didn&rsquo;t represent the electorate. McGovern lost by a landslide.</p>

			<p>Re: Black excitement and the Democrats&rsquo; big problem</p>
<p>Our African-American friends rarely have anything to get excited about or to celebrate. This means that there is a pent-up demand for something, anything, to be happy about. The Obama candidacy offers them a rare chance for this.</p>
<p>I think that by the time of the Democratic Convention, this black exuberance will be a distinctive and visible feature of the 2008 election. And the Democratic leadership will have a problem, because they won&rsquo;t want Obama to be connected in people&rsquo;s minds with blacks too strongly. </p>
<p>Prediction: I foresee events like spontaneous block parties and street parties in major American cities to &#8220;celebrate&#8221; what is happening. But these could easily turn into chaotic mob scenes that get out of hand. These could happen in any city with a large black population. The press will have to cover them, but they won&rsquo;t want to because the events will make Obama look bad.</p>
<p>Another prediction: A spontaneous theme song to be associated with Obama starting in August will be the 1964 hit &#8220;Dancing In The Streets.&#8221; The Democratic Leadership will like this at first (because it&rsquo;s a great, up-beat song), but won&rsquo;t like it when the street events get out of hand.</p>

			<p>A great many whites supported the first black leader to be elected in Zimbabwe. They looked down their noses at the white racists who predicted only doom, doom and more doom. Twenty-five years later the nation (once described as the bread-basket of Africa) cannot even feed its own and whites are being massacred and forced out. Looks like the racists were right after all.</p>
<p>A great many whites supported the first black leader to be elected in South Africa. They looked down their noses at the white racists who predicted only doom, doom and more doom. The Washington Post predicted in 1994 that the new multiracial South African government would be &#8220;a government with a mandate for forgiveness. It will be the first time a country has an official policy that is nothing less than applied Christianity.&#8221; The new government &#8220;is going to keep it clean and beautiful so that newspaper readers will think they are reading scripture when they read dispatches from South Africa that cannot be read except through tears.&rdquo; [Mary McGrory, South Africa is Twice Blessed, Wash Post, 5/12/94.] But now the South African government has become quite corrupt. White farm seizures are fast becoming the norm. One-third of white Afrikaaners have been driven out of the workforce by the black government and are now homeless. Higher-ups in the government now admit that people were better off under Apartheid. Looks like the racists were right after all.</p>

<p>Where&rsquo;s my &#8220;Don&rsquo;t blame me, I voted for Paul&#8221; T-shirt? I have a feeling it&rsquo;ll be useful within a month of the new president&rsquo;s office.</p>

			<p>Blacks were also excited when Mandela took over and ousted the 1st world white government. They were also exited when white rule Rhodesia was replaced by black African rule and renamed Zimbabwe. <br>
Blacks were also happy when Lincoln destroyed the south and gave them equality in America.<br>
They were also happy when the slave revolt occurred in the Bahamas. They were also happy when they took over Detroit, Philly, DC, etc etc. Its the same pattern.</p>
<p>America is going the way of Rome and when blacks began to happily take over you can bet  that everything goes to hell quickly and permanently for good. <br>
Americas only hope is that they still have the majority of whites but this is rapidly changing with miscegenation and influx of mexicans etc. <br>
Down she goes &hellip;.</p>

			<p>What is really striking about this election is not the fact that the MSM are in the tank for Obama but that they make no bones about it. Apparently it&rsquo;s their view of &#8220;fair and objective&#8221;</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t the &#8220;objective&#8221; NYT write an article suggesting whites were racists because only about 30% backed Obama? And apparently this number took the so-called Bradley Effect into consideration.</p>
<p>Just a suggestion to the NYT, maybe whites are just not too enamored with a raw rookie who flip flops and lies a lot..</p>

<p>Ron Paul dropped out the race last month.   I was dissapointed to see this as I had donated alot of money to his campaign.  Don&rsquo;t be a fool, writing in Paul at this point is just the same as casting a vote for Obama.   </p>

			<p>JAKE, you&rsquo;re partially right&hellip; but some of the Obama articles on MSN lately are not what I&rsquo;d call flattering or supportive of the OBAMINATION.</p>
<p>I think a fair guess for him doing as well as he did in the primaries was NOT THAT PEOPLE REALLY WANTED OBAMA, BUT THEY DESPISED SHRILLARY CLINTON ENOUGH TO EVEN VOTE FOR OBAMA AS THE ALTERNATIVE!</p>
<p>I also think a lot of people, in the privacy of the voting booth, will VOTE AGAINST OBAMA this November. He does carry as much negative baggage as Shrillary Clinton. Given that both Obama and his wife are seen as anti-White racists. That many people simply do not believe his claims of not being a closet Muslim or having strong ties to that religion.</p>
<p>The ONLY real character trait I deduce from Obama is that he is an inveterate LIAR. Which alone would keep me from ever wasting my vote on the man. As a genuine politician, he is little more than a media creation. Some high up muckety-muck deciding to put the power of the press behind Obama&hellip; for whatever purpose we can only guess at. On his own, without all that media support, he&rsquo;d have trouble running as local dog catcher.</p>

			<p>Don&rsquo;t waste your time writing in a Presidential vote.  Remember, when you vote for President, you&rsquo;re not necessarily voting for a person, you&rsquo;re voting for a slate of electors to represent your state.  There are only slates of electors available for those candidates who are nominally on the ballot.  If you write in a candidate, your write-in vote for President won&rsquo;t even be counted.</p>

			<p>Of course!  Simply because blacks, in their low IQ naivety think that a black president will hand them wealth on a plate.  It was the same in South Africa when the ANC came to power.  It is the same there now, in fact.  SA blacks now believe that Zuma will hand them wealth on a plate.  In fact, it&rsquo;s possible that all blacks believe that if they vote for someone, that person will make them wealthy.  How wealth is produced is beyond their comprehension.  That only a minority can become the idle rich is a concept they cannot seem to grasp.  </p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t see Obama making any changes, can you? If he&rsquo;s been approved by Bilderberg and AIPAC, which seems to be the case - and he won&rsquo;t get to the White House if it&rsquo;s not - they his term in office will amount to nothing more than tugging his forelock and doing their bidding.</p>

Oh, and I think most of you who are predicting a McCain victory (based on white America&rsquo;s hidden fear and contempt of Obama) are walking on thin theoretical ice. Here&rsquo;s why; McCain, apart from being a despicable betrayal of anything American, is a lousy candidate. Cantankerous, without charm, and just too old for anyone under 65. <br>
Obamashamalamadingdong actually has a chance, not just because of so many marxist whites drooling and wanting to have his love child, but because Mctraitor is without charm, or enough marbles to look compotent. He truly seems too old. The Communists-er Democrats may be aggressively offensive, but the Republicans are just stupid. Truly, they are the stupid party.<br>

			<p>I had quite a few things to say to this article, but I was stopped dead in my tracks by the post from No Mans Land.</p>
<p>I happen to live in a black ruled society right here in the US.  It amazes me to no end what we have in common with SA and Rhodesia.</p>
<p>You pinned it down.  You got it right.  Let nobody in the US, if they live under these kinds of politics- be it Detroit, Philly Atlanta, New Orleans, etc. etc- do not be blind to what the South Africans are trying to tell you.</p>
<p>You, my friends, are already living in it.  You just don&rsquo;t know it quite yet (except Detroit- I think you figured it out).  This is our future.  Let&rsquo;s not lie to ourselves- this is our present.</p>
<p>If you want to fight, please do, I&rsquo;m with you.  If you feel you can&rsquo;t, then you can&rsquo;t, and don&rsquo;t feel guilty about it.  The big problem here is that we are the epicenter of a huge problem, so don&rsquo;t wage a war of denial about it.  It&rsquo;s our duty to let the country now what&rsquo;s going on with us.  They really don&rsquo;t seem to know otherwise.</p>
<p>People seem to like to go to other parts of the country, and then proceed to tell lies about what they ran from, just to be PC.</p>
<p>Everybody white flights- nobody admits it.  As a result, people that are gullible just don&rsquo;t understand it.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t tell them lies anymore.  Please tell them what it is you&rsquo;re running from.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>So stay or flee, that&rsquo;s your chice, but for God&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t lie.</p>

			<p>I am glad you folks see this all so clearly.  Myself I have very mixed feelings about Obama.  First since his father was suppose to be part Arab and his mother all white he is more white than black. To the extent genetics plays a role in temperament he is probably much less impulsive than a black.  Second he is intelligent.  Even hundred percent blacks can be far to the right on a bell curve although the average is only 85 and this guy can be way over there given he is mostly white.  So here&rsquo;s the reality..  He may be capable of being a decent President unlike the blacks in Africa,Detroit, D.C.,etc. If so America and the world is going to conclude any black could be a competent leader, contrary to the facts.  Therefore I submit we should be very careful right from the beginning in distinguishing Obama from a run of the mill black and in drawing this distinction to the publics attention.  </p>

<p>What some of us worry about is not necessarily Obama himself (although his policies are bad enough).  It&rsquo;s the attitude that the average black will have if he actually wins.  It&rsquo;s the &#8220;we&rsquo;re taking over honkey&#8221; mentality.  I have noticed a sharp uptick in black-on-white hate crimes and wildings, not-so-coincidentally corresponding with Obama&rsquo;s success.</p>

			<p>Beware that 16 percent.<br>
Oh, and I think most of you who are predicting a McCain victory (based on white America&rsquo;s hidden fear and contempt of Obama) are walking on thin theoretical ice. Here&rsquo;s why; McCain, apart from being a despicable betrayal of anything American, is a lousy candidate. Cantankerous, without charm, and just too old for anyone under 65. </p>
<p>Your saying an inexperienced Obama who will tax us to the breaking point is better?  Your saying a guy with ties to terrorists and black liberation theologists is not a betrayal of America?  Charm?  Is this an American Idol contest or a Presidential Election?  Not that it matters how do you know he&rsquo;s not charming and cantankerous other than the spoon feeding from the media?  I don&rsquo;t think Obama is charming not to mention his unpleasant appearance (he almost looks like a cancer or AIDS patient) or the stress in his voice to suppress his black inflexion.  But these are just opinions.  The age issue is mute.  I have no illusions about McCain but people raised the issue about Reagan and he was the best President in living memory. <br>
 <br>
Obamashamalamadingdong actually has a chance, not just because of so many marxist whites drooling and wanting to have his love child, but because Mctraitor is without charm, or enough marbles to look compotent.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see how since only 30% of Whites have a favorable opinion of him.  Since so many White people lie in these polls to keep from looking racist, the percentage is probably much lower.  You make your post sound as if this supposed charm, good looks and youth trumps experience and knowledge.  Is this a beauty contest? <br>

			<p>&#8220;I can&rsquo;t see Obama making any changes, can you? If he&rsquo;s been approved by Bilderberg and AIPAC, which seems to be the case - and he won&rsquo;t get to the White House if it&rsquo;s not - they his term in office will amount to nothing more than tugging his forelock and doing their bidding.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t trust him plain and simple.  He&rsquo;s not all that enthusiastic about America the way it is.  In his own words he said he would side with the muslims if there were a conflict.  As President he would not be so obvious in siding with the enemy but it could be done covertly.  There would literally be no safeguards to protect classified information from being leaked to the other side if he chose to do so.  </p>

			<p><i>Only 16 percent of whites say they are excited by the campaign &mdash;  yes, that&rsquo;s excellent news for us, and bad news for Obama. All the excitement about his campaign might turn out to be a manufactured product of the left-wing media.</i>  </p>
<p><i>A little-known piece of history: When McGovern ran against Nixon in 1972, primarily on an anti-war platform, he drew enormous crowds whenever he gave a speech. This looked like a wave of enthusiasm for him to any naive journalist covering the campaign. But in fact, those crowds didn&rsquo;t represent the electorate. McGovern lost by a landslide.</i>  </p>

<p>God I hope you&rsquo;re right.  Just keep telling yourself &#8220;The enemy of my enemy is my friend&#8221; and vote McCain.  </p>
<p>My personal plan is to support McCain through Election Day, then fight him after Inauguration Day.  He&rsquo;s better than Obama, and voting 3rd party is pointless this year.  </p>
<p>I also plan to place a &#8220;Democrats for McCain&#8221; bumper sticker on my car as soon as he picks a VP - if I can encourage even one white Democrat to jump the aisle for McCain, it will be worth pretending to be a leftist on the highway for a couple of months.  </p>

			<p>I hope they get REALLY excited. I can&rsquo;t wait to hear their wails of racism when the polls prove meaningless and most whites, including many hispanics, vote for McCain just to keep Mr. &#8220;Barack&#8221; Affirmative Action in the South Side of Chicago where he belongs with all the other hustlers.</p>

<p>Whether it was intentional or not Mass Immigration has placed Hispanics alongside of Blacks. In fact, more than just placed, but in many cases REplaced. <br>
Anyway, if Obama looses and Blacks riot, Hispanics are likely to have little sympathy and NO patience.<br>
You will have two higly reactive and extraordinarily hard-headed groups who don&rsquo;t get along. It doesn&rsquo;t look good for Blacks. Even if Obama wins. But if he doesn&rsquo;t, well&hellip;<br>
Blacks have been the special victim group of the West, especially here.  Having Trillions of dollars and an endless stream of speical favors, and unconditional enabling, showered on them for the past 50 years, to no avail. <br>
Whereas Hispanics have come along and in less than ten years are QUANTITATIVELY posing as a viable threat not to Blacks, but to Whites.<br>
Blacks still don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s hit them and they seem to have little clue as to what is coming.  It is my view that, demographically, Blacks will be one notch below the American Indian by the middle of the century.  Of course I could be wrong, and only time will tell.  But one thing is for sure; by this time next year we will know exactly what anyone can expect from the USA for the rest of the century.</p>

Um, YES, this IS a BEAUTY CONTEST. Americans long ago surrendered their rights to self-govern, and instead look every four years for the guy who looks, sounds and feels right-rather like shopping for a car. Then the voting public goes back to sleep. <br>
Add to that, the sickly slide into socialism that has edukated a whole generation or two, and has buoyed the old hippies, and Obama the savior looks good to a lot of deluded folks.</p>
<p> McCain just looks too old. And he is. He&rsquo;s also an open borders fanatic who is probably in the hip pocket of the Mexican drug cartels. How could such a promoter of open borders not be? Who runs Mexico, compadre? The drug lords. Who keeps their avenues of drugs, violence, guns and human capital open? McCain, and hundrest-nay-thousands- of other politicians, big and small.</p>
<p>Face it- though every thinking man hates the idea of Obama being president, McCain is only marginally better. I mean, the choice is ludicrous&hellip;would you like your eye to be put out, or would you rather lose your right hand? <br>
My point is only this: McCain is a stupid, stupid choice for the republicans to have made. God, what a stupid bunch of people. I EXPECT Democrats to put up an abhorrent candidate-it&rsquo;s their job! They cast their lots with minority blocs forty years ago. Since then, they have been a tool of all those groups who live to dismember American culture, and divide the spoils among themselves. Ergo, The Democratik machine is the machine to put out the most abominable candidate. No surprise.<br>
I can&rsquo;t stand either party, or those who rally to support candidates based on party affiliation&hellip;if ever there was a way to obscure the true nature of politics, it&rsquo;s the two-party system. <br>
But McCain is a loser. I hope he wins (God help me), but he&rsquo;s a loser.</p>

			<p>Hey look. We can thank Bush and his neocons and GOPs for screwing up everything so badly that has allowed Obama to exist in the first place.Anybody who knows the history of Dubya surely could have predicted he would mess up everything he touched and we know Daddy pulled all the strings and fixed it all up.<br>
This is what happens when you follow a car off the cliff. <br>
Bush has made everything a piece of cake for Obama who has simply waltzed right in and took over without any problems. Sometimes who have to look in the mirror to see the real blame for the problems. </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve some advice for those who don&rsquo;t want to &#8220;waste&#8221;a vote.  The Constitution and American Independent parties need your votes.  If they don&rsquo;t get a certain percentage of the votes cast, they can be removed from the ballot.  If ever we are to elect an American President again, it will be because the third party threat forced the GOP to listen to us.  Until we get a real candidate, we need to keep the right-wing third parties alive.</p>

			<p>Obama will probably win because the Establishment has decided to swing the pendulum again (the fact of his race also gives them a lot of &#8216;see how democratic America is&rsquo; rubbish to spout. </p>
<p>But either way, either candidate will once again act as bellhops for an Establishment that owns and operates both parties. How do you suppose either one of these candidates got to be candidates? </p>
<p>While promoting a few insignificant, but popular, legislative issues along the way (predictably hailed by the Establishment&rsquo;s newsspeak), the next President, whoever he is, will as usual assist the Corporate Round Table in continuing to change (read debase) our national culture by making our borders, our quality of life, and citizenship itself within them utterly meaningless.</p>

			<p>The election is not exciting, but it&rsquo;s not boring either   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s horrifying.  The choice is between a half senile war open borders war monger and a tax and spend socialist who is even more in favor of illegal immigration than McCain.</p>
<p>Of course 98% of blacks will vote for Obama.  They won&rsquo;t be called racist for voting for one of their own.  But if 70% of whites vote for McCain, this will be taken as proof of irredeemable racism.</p>
<p>The illegal alien amnesty bill that keeps being resurrected is now a near certain thing for passage.  The Republicans have deservedly lost their majorities in the House and Senate, and will soon lose the White House.  But the Democrats did not deserve to get their majorities.  With Nancy Pelosi as speaker of the House and Obama as president, it will be almost impossible to prevent an amnesty from being railroaded through Congress.<br>

			<p>Sorry WR, the Elder, but House and Senate seats will get voted on this November. There is no guarantee the Dems won&rsquo;t lose a lot of ground with the strong feeling AGAINST Amnesty in this country.</p>
<p>Nor do I believe the OBAMINATION can win. People SAY one thing, and in the privacy of the voting booth, will likely do another, voting FOR McCAIN as the perceived lesser of the evils. Besides which being not that healthy looking, he might do the country a favor and either resign early (due to health reasons) or even keel over. With a good Republican V.P. to take the reins and get our nation back on track.</p>

			<p>To FED UP:  Most Americans are against amnesty but put it way down on the list of issues, below the price of gas and the Iraq war.  Even the Republicans voted for the most pro-amnesty candidate available in the primaries, although I&rsquo;m pretty sure it wasn&rsquo;t because they liked his stand on illegal immigration.  I&rsquo;m afraid that the failed candidacy of Ron Paul proves that with most Republicans you can just squeak &#8220;The Terrorists (TM)!&#8221; and they will rush to vote for whomever promises to bomb the most Muslims (a policy guaranteed to create more jihadists), and will ignore all other issues.</p>
<p>If the Republicans won&rsquo;t punish a candidate in the primaries for his stand on illegal immigration, and the Democrats nominate the most pro-amnesty candidate on their side, there is no reason to believe that people are going to vote out Democrats because of their adamant advocacy of replacing American workers with illegal aliens.</p>
