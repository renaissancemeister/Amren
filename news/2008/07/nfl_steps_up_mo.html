						<p>The NFL is stepping up its monitoring of on-field player activities to ensure that no one is flashing the hand signals of street gangs.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Times reported Tuesday that the league had hired experts to look at game tapes and identify players or team officials who might be using suspected gang signals. Violators would be warned and disciplined if the episodes recurred.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>They said the scrutiny was intensified after the shooting death of Denver cornerback Darrent Williams in 2007 after Williams was involved in a dispute with known gang members. Anti-gang information is included in orientation literature and stressed in the annual mandatory league meeting for rookies.</p>
<p>The NFL took further notice after Paul Pierce of the NBA&rsquo;s Boston Celtics was fined $25,000 in April for what the league said was a &#8220;menacing gesture&#8221; toward the Atlanta Hawks&rsquo; bench. {snip}</p>
<p>The Times said that was the precipitating incident for the NFL.</p>

			<p>With things such as gang signs its important to know the difference between a gang sign and a hand sign that indicates ones area of residence. Often the hand sign that indicates that one lives on the east coast and the hand sign that indicates that one lives on the west coast are mistaken for gang signs when in fact they are simply hand gestures used to indicate where one is from and hence what coast they represent.  </p>

<p>Quit drafting potential &#8216;bangers.  Look into ending discrimination against whites, which Don Wassall has proven: www.castefootball.us</p>

			<p>I think the thuggish behavior on and off-field is good.  If it drives mainstream Americans into not watching a bunch of idiots throwing a ball around, those mainstream Americans will have to find a more productive use for their time, and the idiots will have to get real jobs.</p>

<p>And isn&rsquo;t that the reason for the east coast, west coast murders of Tupac and Biggie Smalls?</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t just about coasts. It&rsquo;s about which coast your gang represents. This isn&rsquo;t about respect and being nice. It&rsquo;s about trashing and disrespecting each other. All of which leads to violence.</p>
<p>Coast or gang. It&rsquo;s the same thing.</p>

<p>Nobody with a productive use for their time has any need or desire to waste their time being schooled in the intricacies &amp; details of Afro-American Criminal Sign Language.</p>
<p>When the criminals who cannot abide by the rule of law (or any other set of rules, save the law of the jungle) do us the favor of identifying who they are, the proper form of appreciation for such gestures is to recognize them for what they are and deal with such enemies of society accordingly.<br>

Warned? In the good old days of the NFL-when men, not juvenile thugs- played the game, such behavior would draw immediate and lifetime expulsion. <br>
Who the hell cares, anyway. I have had zero times infinity interest in the NFL since God-knows-when. It finally died at  least fifteen years ago, when I had the distinct feeling I was watching despicable infantile morons dance and strut about the gridiron. Wait, call that the &#8220;idiotorium.&#8221; That&rsquo;s what it is. Ditto Baseball, basketball, or any other such sport. <br>
I&rsquo;d sooner watch stock cars go around the track 200 times-just for the camradere!<br>
But, better yet, I&rsquo;ve got a LIFE. Hopefully, the rest of American white men-and anybody else who sees themselves as a standard-bearer for Western society- will reclaim their lives, too. <br>
Don&rsquo;t be a spectator.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t want to make fun of you sport enthusiasts but really how much longer are white American men going to keep up their frenzied following of professional sports that for the most part are a matter of one bunch of black thugs playing another bunch of black thugs?  I wouldn&rsquo;t contribute a nickel to the NFL by going to a game, buying any of their products etc.  All you are doing is supporting and enriching the enemies of our people.</p>

<p>Why would anybody use a hand gesture to indicate where they&rsquo;re from? Sounds like another form of gang sign to me. I mean, isn&rsquo;t that what a gang sign is? Personally, I&rsquo;ve never felt the need to flash gestures that mean I&rsquo;m from the West Coast or wherever. This signing business always reminded me of kids who form clubs and have secret signals and codes and the like. The mental age of these gangbangers must be around five years old.</p>

			<p>These are so-called &#8220;professional&#8221; athletes.  No matter how you feel about professional athletics, they are American Dynasties, and now they are going to have &#8220;experts&#8221; watch players for use of gang signs?  And what will happen when they catch players using signs?  Players get to play after they become convicted criminals, so whats making a gang sign going to get them?  Worse yet, what does this say about everyone involved?  RIDICULOUS!</p>

<p>Why waste your time studying anything then? Maybe you should just walk around being ignorant of what people are doing and saying. Do you realize that the attitude you have is why Americans don&rsquo;t know the difference between a Shiite and a Sunni? Do you realize that knowing the difference is important? Obviously using hand gestures in a way that is typical of the ghetto is not something associated with high culture however wearing your ignorance as a badge of honor isn&rsquo;t a mark of high culture either. A truly sophisticated is not only knowledgeable of refined things, a sophisticated person is knowledgeable of both that which is refined and that which is coarse. </p>

The NFL must stomp this out, or face ruin.</p>

			<p>Tell me, 7:18, what part of a ball game requires flashing hand signs to opposing players to indicate the &#8220;area of one&rsquo;s residence&#8221;?  One&rsquo;s teammates would naturally already know.  All the opposing players need to know is where your team is from and where it stands in the rankings.  If you are playing for the Cowboys, it is safe for the opposition to assume that where you were originally from is irrelevant and that you now reside in or near Dallas.</p>
<p>If this is too complicated for you, you don&rsquo;t need to be making excuses for overpaid gang-wannabees, even though some on-field shootings between members of opposing teams would make the game more watchable.  Should these overgrown children also sag their uniform pants while they are at it?</p>

			<p>Ditto to Mr. Scott&rsquo;s response to the poster (troll?) 7:18 on Jul.18, but even more important to me: </p>
<p>The very idea of knowing &#8216;African-American Criminal Sign Language&rsquo;, as another poster aptly named it, as a measure of &#8220;sophistication&#8221; is a joke, right? You were being maybe a comedian?</p>
<p>Your comparison of such ignorance to that of the Sunni/Shia schism in Islam is ridiculous as well: even though I don&rsquo;t care to have it around, I respect Islam for the world religion and cultural force that it is. I think you just insulted a billion-plus Moslems.</p>
<p>You also raised another point: So what if most Americans don&rsquo;t understand Sunni vs. Shia? Why should they? I may have forgotten it from high school world history class, until the Carter era-blowback of failed US foreign meddling brought it to our attention via the Iranians, but that&rsquo;s all the significance it had to me personally. Nothing to be ashamed of, as an American non-Moslem (as some here might agree, maybe a redundancy right there). </p>
<p>Yes, I wear my &#8220;ignorance&#8221; of gang signs as a badge of honor, because I&rsquo;m sophisticated enough to discern what is worth knowing and what is not.</p>
<p>To &#8220;adults&#8221; flashing gang signs (I&rsquo;m sorry to say I actually know the term is &#8220;stacking&#8221;)  &mdash;  and to those who think it should matter to me  &mdash;  I&rsquo;d offer a hand signal in return: extended middle finger.</p>

			<p>There are plenty of hand signs that aren&rsquo;t for gangs. Fraternities have hand signs and I, for one, would be very offended if I was told that I couldn&rsquo;t represent my fraternity on the field.</p>

<p>We never had problems like this before sports, and the rest of our society, was forcibly integrated.</p>
<p>The further the black race gets from the era in which whites exerted meaningful control over their behavior, the more they revert to the behaviors natural to so many of them.</p>

<p>You would be vevy offended if you couldn&rsquo;t &#8220;represent&#8221; your fraternity on field.  How nice!  I would have to represent my fraternity on field by putting you in the hospital or the morgue.</p>
<p>Have you ever been throat-punched during a ball game for giving hand signs to opposing players?  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet the moderator doesn&rsquo;t have the stones to post this.</p>
