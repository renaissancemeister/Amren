				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Patrick Donahue, Bloomberg, July 24, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Berlin&rsquo;s city center took on the atmosphere of a rock concert as more than 200,000 people jammed the German capital&rsquo;s Tiergarten park to hear U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;He&rsquo;s extremely charismatic &mdash; I&rsquo;ve never seen anybody like this,&#8221; said Wolfgang Zuchowsky, a 73-year-old retired police officer from Berlin. &#8220;It&rsquo;s much better than what we&rsquo;ve seen from the American style in the last few years, quite a bit more intellectual than the current president.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought he was very good,&#8221; said Julian Metz, a 27-year- old architecture student in Berlin who shook Obama&rsquo;s hand after the speech. &#8220;It was a great feeling to touch him.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>&lsquo;Man of Goodwill&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>The Berliners of 2008, for their part, wanted as much of Obama as possible. Sixty-two percent of Germans want him to be the next U.S. president, according to a Gallup poll released yesterday.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&rsquo;s young and he&rsquo;s a boy with integrity,&#8221; said Annegret Boesken, 60, a retiree from the western German town of Pruem. &#8220;I think he&rsquo;s a man of goodwill. Especially from my generation, it&rsquo;s a change for a new chapter in U.S.-German relations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, thousands thronged behind barriers in front of the Hotel Adlon to try and get a glimpse of him.</p>
<p>The daily Berliner Zeitung&rsquo;s headline ran: &#8220;Obama ist ein Berliner &mdash; fuer einen Tag,&#8221; or &#8220;Obama is a Berliner, for a day.&#8221; In the tabloid Bild-Zeitung the headline, &#8220;Do an Obama for Us,&#8221; was meant as a demand to German politicians to adopt Obama&rsquo;s charisma as well as his cropped coif.</p>

			<p>There was a rock concert before BHO&rsquo;s speech.  That&rsquo;s why the turnout was high (but nowhere near 200G, I think.)  This has been a common Obama campaign scam.</p>
<p>At one point, Obama talked about the terrorist conspiracy leading up to 9/11, and spoke of it as a bad thing.  I noticed there were  a lot of boos and jeers when he said this.  Meaning that most of the crowd were Turks/Muslims.  Real Krauts no more wanted Obama there than they want black American soldiers occupying their country, raping their women and collecting German welfare benefits.</p>
<p>I broke down the substance of some of his remarks:</p>

			<p>Millions of Germans died in the two world wars for this?  I am not defending the Nazis. But Germany represents a now lost civilization that Obama has nothing but contempt for. Listen to a Schubert march or a Mozart requiem and weep.</p>

			<p>Charisma is just another word for salemanship.  I heard today that 75% of Germans say they would vote for him if they could.  What, for their own president?  That might be a different matter.  </p>
<p>Certainly, today&rsquo;s Amren essay &#8220;Why Obama will Win&#8221; holds true for European Whites as well as North Americans; even more so - as most Germans are completely addicted to the constant search for the self-vindication that groveling at the feet of a good black political salesman can bring.  What Hitler did to Germany!</p>

			<p>I am disappointed in the East Germans.  I had thought they were somewhat educated people.  Apparently those idiots know little of Louis the Bolshevistic Nazi Farrakhan or the goofy preacher nut Jeremiah Wright or the massive black on white rape, murder, and racial cleansing.  If they did, they would have been protesting Obama and asking him in shouts of defiance why he is a closet racist and bigot.</p>

			<p>I just don&rsquo;t understand any of it. I don&rsquo;t see the &#8220;charisma&#8221; or the reason for the fascination. His youth and his racial status must be the ONLY reasons for the hoopla. But in Germany? Of all places?? Are the Berliners trying to inform us that they&rsquo;ve transcended their past and are delighted by the prospect of a black man at our helm? *OR*, are they smugly pleased that the remaining superpower will be brought down to every other nation&rsquo;s rank? There is much about this candidate that I cannot fathom.</p>

			<p>Well, I&rsquo;m German, I&rsquo;ve been reading Amren regularly over the last few weeks, I largely agree with Mr Taylor and utterly despise political correctness. <br>
BUT I just don&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s so bad about Obama. I don&rsquo;t actually know enough about his politics to judge him on those, but he seems intelligent enough, certainly more so than Bush? (Guess you won&rsquo;t like me for this)</p>
<p>I just can&rsquo;t help rather liking him to be honest.</p>
<p>So, my honest and naive question is this:</p>
<p>Just why would Obama make such a terrible President? </p>
<p>(if you think we&rsquo;re all brainwashed - which may or may not be true - you have only yourselves to blame, hehe)<br>

			<p>Yeah, but we have to understand the background for this &#8220;enthusiasm&#8221;. People mainly went there to hear a concert, and that gets people primed and in a good mood for just about anything. </p>

			<p>Was the crowd really Germans or was there alot of Blacks, mixed races, Turks, Algerians, etc. I don&rsquo;t think a true German would ever go to see this charlatan, except of course a liberal German much like those here in the USA. They have been as brainwashed as the Whites in this country.  It is pathetic to see Whites fawn and coo over this guy who hates them to begin with. We are in for some bad times if Whites don&rsquo;t wake up and get some backbone the world over. I am totally ashamed of my race. They are cowards.</p>

			<p>[Germans gush over Obama, &ldquo;a boy with integrity.&rdquo;]</p>
<p>Too bad, the Jeremiah Wright tapes weren&rsquo;t played right after Obama&rsquo;s speeches, so they could gush over them too. </p>
<p>Europeans, with a few exceptions, are absolutely cluless about the degree to which blacks cause ungodly problems in this country.  They know little or nothing about horrendous black behavior, especially since they have been under indoctrination and fed politically correct propaganda now for 60 years, not really aware of the extent of the contentious racial problems that have been here for so long and getting much worse.<br>

<p>You wrote:</p>
<p><i>(if you think we&rsquo;re all brainwashed - which may or may not be true - you have only yourselves to blame, hehe)</i></p>
<p>I can completely understand why you said that, and agree.  I get the feeling that the German body politic would be very much more right wing if we weren&rsquo;t still occupying the country.</p>
<p>As for your fundamental question:  What&rsquo;s so bad about Obama?</p>
<p>Do you live near an American military base?  If not, do you know someone that does?  If not, then I&rsquo;ll tell you what I have been told   &mdash;   black American soliders have a bad propensity to rape German women who live near the bases, commit other sorts of crimes off base, and some are even collecting German social welfare benefits.</p>
<p>An Obama Presidency would be bad enough for its doctrinaire liberalism, but we have 40 million blacks, and even if a small percentage of them &#8220;feel their oats,&#8221; so to speak, thanks to the ignorant &#8220;We&rsquo;re taking over&#8221; mentality a la Mandela/Mugabe, there will be white people murdered.  In fact, I&rsquo;m of the opinion that just his political success as of now has sparked a lot of wildings, group beatings and hate crimes.</p>

			<p>One element in the welcome Obama received in Berlin is that Berlin has always been the most leftist of German cities. This was true in the 20&rsquo;s and 30&rsquo;s leading up to the National Socialist period and still is. </p>

			<p>He is something new, there has never been a person of color running for president, the greatest generation has died off. He is half white, so he can communicate with whites. Most whites do not interact with other races. The News media gave him a free ride. Neocons are afraid to attack him or want to vote for him.</p>
<p>In all a perfect storm. Bush is an empty suit also, so can Obama get away with it? What happens after 4 or 8 years? Can blacks complain anymore about schools, crime, welfare? </p>
<p>It will be interesting to say the least. Will anyone attack him on his merrit? </p>

			<p>Germany has little knowlege of blacks, its mainly in Britain, and in France that has blacks. They are also under strict thought-police rules, so they have to smile when they see a minority committing a crime against a white. Don&rsquo;t worry about Germany, they will be the first white country to deal with the problem at hand. Italy IS leading the way, they are on full immigrant alert!</p>

			<p>I think many Germans (and Europeans in general) have an idealized view of blacks from films and TV, and jazz and hiphop are very popular and &#8220;cool&#8221;.</p>
<p>Very few have had much exposure to black culture. <br>
That is true to some extent in the US as well; those with the least contact with blacks are the most outraged by any criticism of them.</p>
<p>My son went through a phase of admiring blacks and trying to be black until he was in a high school that was 20% black. After one year, he couldn&rsquo;t stand them. </p>

<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t speak German, but I do speak Spanish and I read El Pais, a paper from Madrid, almost everyday online. The Spanish are enamoured of Obama. They even had a cartoon where two people are talking and one says that if Obama were running for president over there (in Spain) he&rsquo;d blow the opposition away, but that won&rsquo;t happen in the U.S.  The other person says &#8220;Yes, the gringos are rotten, aren&rsquo;t they, Miss Scarlett?&#8221; So, American Whites are called gringos and on top of it they had to take a jab at the White Southerners. Nice.  </p>
<p>The point I&rsquo;m trying to make is that I think the MSM in Europe is every bit as bad as here. The Europeans think we&rsquo;re all racists and for no reason at all except that we&rsquo;re evil. And, no, we don&rsquo;t have only ourselves to blame. It was done to us. We don&rsquo;t have a free press. </p>
<p>I guess the Europeans will have to learn the hard way. We&rsquo;ve been trying to appease the Black race for over 40 years now and they&rsquo;re worse than ever. </p>
<p>Well, thank God for the internet!  <br>

			<p>To the German guy or gal,</p>
<p>Why would Obama make a bad President?  The list is long, but I will give you a start.</p>
<p>First of all, the Office of the President of the United States is serious business; this is not a high school popularity contest.  We do not want someone who is just average to be in this important position that will make decisions that will not only affect us, but future generations as well.  I believe Bush, for instance, had a chance for greatness after 9-11, but he erred and we will suffer the consequences in years to come.</p>
<p>Mr. Obama has no executive experience.  I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that there are thousands of people in our country more qualified for President that Mr. Obama.  He is a self-described &#8220;community organizer.&#8221; Much more is required to lead this nation.</p>
<p>Mr. Obama&rsquo;s voting record and policies would be a disaster for this nation and possibly for much of the world.  More government and socialism is not the answer.  </p>
<p>Mr. Obama (as well as, his wife) has made it clear from his statements and writings that he does not like white people.  He, in fact, does not like the fact that he is half white.</p>
<p>I am amazed that a man who would not sing our national anthem (stated that the American flag is a &#8220;symbol of oppression&#8221; to some people of the world and that if the song were &#8220;We are the World&#8221; he might sing it), recite the pledge of allegiance, wear the American flag, and has a wife that said she &#8220;proud of America for the first time&#8221; in her adult life is even a viable candidate at all.</p>
<p>The story then is not Barack Obama, but the Americans and so called &#8220;Americans&#8221; that support him.  What true American would do such a thing?</p>
<p>By the way, the list of negatives about Obama is much longer and detailed than this brief description.<br>
</p>

			<p>As a Canadian I can&rsquo;t help but be struck by how this whole Obama thing just reminds me SO MUCH of Pierre Trudeau in 1968. Largely a political-party elite and MSM manufactured creation P.E.T. promised &#8220;reconciliation&#8221; between Canada&rsquo;s two communities and above all - &#8220;change&#8221;. By 1972 Anglo-Canadians had become utterly disenchanted with him and only his Quebec tribal vote let him hang on to a minority government. It will be interesting to see how far Obama&rsquo;s rule parallels Trudeau&rsquo;s.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The walls between races and tribes, natives and immigrants&hellip; cannot stand.&#8221; - Obama in Berlin</p>
<p>If the Germans are so enthusiastic about Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;one world&#8221; message, then why do they have some of the strictest immigration laws in the Western world? Why don&rsquo;t they prove their commitment to Obama&rsquo;s wall-free utopian vision and open their borders to mass non-white immigration?</p>

			<p>&#8220;The daily Berliner Zeitung&rsquo;s headline ran: &ldquo;Obama ist ein Berliner &mdash; fuer einen Tag,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Obama is a Berliner, for a day.&rdquo; In the tabloid Bild-Zeitung the headline, &ldquo;Do an Obama for Us,&rdquo; was meant as a demand to German politicians to adopt Obama&rsquo;s charisma as well as his cropped coif.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was quite a discussion on the local talk radio station the other day about &#8220;Ich bin ein Berliner.&#8221; When Kennedy said it in the 60&rsquo;s, he got a huge chuckle from the crowd. He should have said (according to the guest on the radio show), &#8220;Ich bin Berliner.&#8221; &#8220;icn bin EIN Berliner&#8221; translates to &#8220;I am a jelly doughnut.&#8221;<br>

			<p>I am US citizen who has lived between the US &amp; Berlin for years.</p>
<p>Obama is inexperienced and unqualified, but he is light years better than Mcain, and the fact that he is 1/2 black (and 1/2 white) is not that important.</p>
<p>People here like Obama because he is intelligent and articulate and doesn&rsquo;t seem to want to get into any new wars.</p>
<p>The Europeans - right &amp; left, it really makes no difference at all - regard Bush and Cheney as insane, corrupt, ignorant clowns who have reduced the US to impotence and ushered in a new levels of paranoia and isolation.</p>
<p>In other works: because he is so different from Bush, who is universally despised here. </p>
<p>Germany is years ahead if other countries re talking openly about wanting to end mass immigration and force people to assimilate or leave.</p>
<p>there are huge battles here over the building of mega mosques.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the link between being anti-Muslim takeover and conservative has been broken.</p>
<p>This means simply:<br>
with no stigma of being called a right wing kook, ordinary Germans who are progessive in most things can openly say they want many foreigners to leave, that Berlin is in Europe, not a suburb of Istanbul. </p>
<p>So there is potential for a mass movement here which spans the political spectrum.</p>
<p>Having said that, the worst social proble, in Germany is the shocking violence perpetrated by young Nazis - who will target cripples or pretty much any at all if there are no foreigners available.</p>
<p>I have lived in a heavily Turkish neighborhood for years: it is safer than any city in the states.</p>
<p>I would rather live in a neighborood that is 100% Turkish than one even 1% neonazi.</p>

			<p>Of all the nations of Europe, Germany is the most politically correct and the most masochistic.  The German government is merely the creation of the occupation forces following WWII  &mdash;  largely composed of  Americans with a huge grudge over their shoulders.  The result is a country which is in perpetual self-flagalation, and self hatred.</p>

<p>Let me try to answer your question from a different angle.  Americans don&rsquo;t elect individuals as president any more based on what they are or what they believe.  It&rsquo;s all a huge charade and it boils down to acting, saying the right things, wearing the right clothes, having the right look, being taller than your opponent, flattering the right interest groups and spending enough money.  Character has nothing to do with it.  If a candidate ever gets caught saying something that is not carefully rehearsed, he&rsquo;ll get in trouble for it usually.  Hence, it is not Obama the man Americans are voting for (or against).  It is Obama the symbol.  He is a symbol of the ultimate affirmative action.  He&rsquo;s a symbol of black racialism and a rejection of white America.  Both he and his wife are clearly black racialists and, had they been white and held the same positions about whites - they would never have even made it to the primaries for both would have been branded as racists.  Therefore his candidacy is also a symbol of double standards.  Nothing he&rsquo;s said, since the beginning of his campaign, can be taken seriously.  Every word out of his mouth, every nuance, every piece of clothing, has been carefully orchestrated by his team of coaches.  If this is what they mean by &#8220;integrity&#8221; then perhaps we should change the definition in the dictionary.  We&rsquo;re not saying that McCain is any better of course.  But all this hype about &#8220;change&#8221; is ridiculous.  Obama does not represent meaningful change on a political level; 99.9% of what he&rsquo;ll do is the same as any other leftist politician would do in the White House.  They all come from the same mold.  If you want somebody to get excited about and who actually does represent change, then get excited about Ron Paul.  Unfortunately the powers that be do not want change so they made sure Dr. Paul never stood a chance.  I also second what question diversity said.  Any boost in collective black self esteem and empowerment will be directly translated into murdered and raped whites and Asians.  Blacks are already worshiped in this country and even that&rsquo;s not enough; they murder, rape and pillage at alarming rates.  Sadly, whether Obama wins or loses, many innocent whites will die at the hands of blacks.  Either scenario is an excuse for further bloodshed.  Oh, and by the way dear German friend, don&rsquo;t think what we say about black behavior here is based on prejudice or what we&rsquo;ve heard/read. Not so.  It&rsquo;s based on our own personal experiences (backed up by statistics).  Just yesterday I found out that my housemate&rsquo;s brother was murdered by a black hoodlum.  It was part of a gang initiation.  In other words he was killed because he was white but not a word about it in the press.</p>
<p>As for Obama being smarter than Bush, that&rsquo;s probably true - but it&rsquo;s not saying much.</p>
<p>I hope you continue to read, and participate in, Amren.</p>

			<p>Having asked the question why Obama is wrong and read your comments:</p>
<p>&#8220;Germany represents a now lost civilization&#8221; - make it Europe - we&rsquo;ve traded in a highly refined culture for degenerate gangsta-rap and bling. People used to aspire to be like the best. Today, the ghetto is the ideal for most. </p>
<p>Whiteplight: </p>
<p>&#8220;75% of Germans would vote for him - what for their own president?&#8221; - That question is justified, you&rsquo;re probably right. Question is what percentage would be willing to vote for a Turkish-German   &mdash;   the closest equivalent to an African-American here.  </p>
<p>Someone:</p>
<p>&#8220;Are the Berliners trying to inform us that they&rsquo;ve transcended their past and are delighted by the prospect of a black man at our helm?&#8221; Sth like that, yes. And we&rsquo;re happy Bush is leaving.</p>
<p>&#8220;*OR*, are they smugly pleased that the remaining superpower will be brought down to every other nation&rsquo;s rank?&#8221; </p>
<p>I assure you that&rsquo;s not the case. Our leftwing media make us appear far more anti-American than most really are. </p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s his youth, charm and intelligence. </p>
<p>Question Diversity:</p>
<p>I used to live near a now closed US Airbase actually (been inside even) but I wasn&rsquo;t aware there was a problem with rape by black soldiers. In any case, our media wouldn&rsquo;t inform us if that was the case. I know it is in Japan. When GIs stationed in Germany get in trouble, it&rsquo;s usually fistfights with Turks in my personal experience. </p>
<p>And we are heavily indoctrinated with multicultural propaganda thoughout highschool, in addition to having your TV-shows and movies, that are loaded with liberal political messages. Any sense of pride of our own culture and heritage is heavily discouraged.</p>

			<p>Americans have themselves to blame for Obama. 30 yrs of PC, multicult, Civil Rights. 2 former white countries (Rhodesia and South Africa) trashed. I just read the opposition in Zimbabwe will not discuss return of lands to the white farmers. Do Americans realise what it means for pioneers and settlers to be forcefully removed from their lands and turned into refugees. Proud people with skill, will and independence turned into refugees and losers. These people will be heartbroken for their lives. The ANC in South Africa is following this pattern. The whites in southern Africa have been utterly humiliated through the foolishness of the US and Britain. So I give a damn if the US is ruled by a black or mulatto. You had it coming!! </p>

			<p>To Anonymous German: first, welcome to site.</p>
<p>Obamba wants to break down walls. The logical conclusion of that (in the long run) would be one world, one culture, one people, all with same ideas, group feelings, continually blending into a grotesque caricature of Oneness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been noted that wild dogs let loose in a city, no matter the variation in size and shape, will all begin to look alike, given enough time. Intermingling molds them into a set shape. It&rsquo;s by isolating that nature gets a chance to try some interesting creative experiments.</p>
<p>That may be one reason Europeans beat out the Chinese, for the most part, in scientific and technical advancement. The mountains ranges that divided the European conclaves allowed seclusion to be oneself, and yet enough proximity to be influenced by the people on the other side of the mountain. The seclusion and proximity made for a creative dynamics; a group could march to their own drums, learn from the other, without being overwhelmed by them.</p>
<p>The horror the for future would not be some Apocalypse; better a thousand comets whacking earth; the dinosaurs never knew what hit them; we should be so lucky. The real horror would be some Super-Africa til the end of time; The tragic condition of not having the self-consciousness of even knowing what went wrong.</p>
<p>The tearing down of walls makes for an anthill. Question: why is a billion ants better than one ant? Except for the utilitarian purpose of building and anthill it&rsquo;s not! They&rsquo;re just an unnecessary duplication of one another. It&rsquo;s the striving of the individual or race to be oneself that adds something to life.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your favorite animal? The tiger? Would you want only tigers on the earth, even assuming there was something to eat? Diversity of Race is build into nature for good reason.</p>
<p>Obamba says the future is the &#8216;Black-Brown-Yellow-White Race&rsquo; is the future. Hey, can someone that can give a fine speech be wrong? Can a crowd of ex-hippies, dreamy liberals, and identity-challenged adolescents cheering in unison be wrong? God forbid! Our dreams of Utopia would prove an illusion. We&rsquo;d have to face the truth alone!</p>
<p>Look at the ancient past. I don&rsquo;t know if the extinct Neanderthal still has surviving genes in modern man, but if so it&rsquo;s a very, very small part. Fast forward 20,000 years, how much White will be there be in this Black-Brown-Yellow-White Future Man? Probably little more that the Neanderthal. Our token genes will be like the token White at a NAACP meeting, with the same degree of power.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be taken in by pretty speeches. Whites have proven, where the tires hit the road, they are a people of intelligence, curiosity, and creativity; they deserve to survive as a distinct people with a distinct culture. </p>
<p>Some day Obama will be gone, and hard times will come, new colored leaders will arise, same words, but with colder hearts and little memory, and will kick the millennium over the Golden Mountain. </p>

<p>Are you sure you&rsquo;re living in Germany, and not Berlin, Texas?</p>
<p>I wish I could agree with you! But from where I stand, speaking out about immigrant crime is still a no-go in my country. As you know German, you should check out www.akte-islam.de (by respected former FAZ-reporter Udo Ulfkotte) and see for yourself how many heinous violent crimes go unreported in the mainstream press. And do you really think Neonazis pose that much of a threat? They sure do tend to pick on the innocent and weak ones and I by no means endorse them but how many are there anyway? They&rsquo;re mostly unemployed malcontents. </p>
<p>And if you live in an area with many Turks and never even witnessed immigrant violence, that is no short of a mystery to me. Walking along the Zeil in Frankfurt any night of the week I am virtually guaranteed to get aggressed. Could it be they don&rsquo;t pick on other foreigners perhaps? <br>
Muslims in France are known to not smash cars with foreign licence plates either. Think about it. </p>
<p>jewamongyou:</p>
<p>As always, very insightful, couldn&rsquo;t agree more. Except that I am not so sure an Obama victory would embolden blacks to commit even more crimes as opposed to temporarily appeasing them. But then you would know better about this than myself. </p>

<p>These two quotes illustrate the problem of Germany and to a comparable extent the entire White world.  Pride in one&rsquo;s ethnicity as a White has been vilified to point of self-destructive abandonment and self-abuse.  That creates the condition that only the most radical reactionary elements will arise to fight it.  That element, as illustrated by the German neo-nazis is so vile and repugnant that it forbids any white with a shred of decency from joining in.  This guarantees the continuance of confusion and division - including among white nationalists outside Germany - that will most likely prevent any cohesive movement from succeeding.  Unless the most radical elements suddenly become much wiser thant they are at present.</p>

<p>That is an interesting point you raise there - neonazis and other extremist groups are indeed doing us more harm than good. Precisely because there may be a certain degree of congruence of opinion between us and them on a few select issues (and NOT on many others),it is absolutely crucial for all of us to distance us from them to make it very clear we don&rsquo;t want to be confused with them. <br>

			<p>As a German-American I was upset about the turnout at the speech.  Still, I think we are over-analyzing this.  Europeans, left and right, hate Bush.  Germans like Obama simply because they hate Bush&rsquo;s foreign policy and the impact it has had on them.  Liking Obama doesn&rsquo;t mean they like multiculturalism.  Just look at the comment by the earlier German poster- even Germans who despise political correctness and multiculturalism like Obama.  Also, don&rsquo;t forget that many in the crowd were just there to listen to a free rock concert and view the spectacle.  I saw pictures of the speech and almost all of the people there who were going nuts and trying to get close to the stage appeared to be black or Turkish.  Even in shots of the larger crowd, there are noticeable dark spots in the audience.  I would predict that at least a quarter of the crowd was ethnic.  Plus, this was in BERLIN people.  As another poster pointed out, Berlin is about as representative of Germany as a whole as New York is representative of middle America.  Let&rsquo;s stop with the gloom and doom all the time.  The thin veneer of multicultural hype that makes crowds like this possible can be shattered very easily.  As Jared said at the conference this year, once your eyes are opened to race realism you can never go back.  As a former liberal myself, I can attest to that.  In just the past week I have talked to several young, former Obama supporters who now despise him and are very conservative.  Why? Because they said he has been over-hyped and is not &#8220;cool&#8221; anymore.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a link to website that documents many quotes from Obama and those around him.  From my brief glance at the site, it seemed to be accurate.</p>
<p>One of the things I didn&rsquo;t mention about Obama is his friendships with criminals and terrorists.  He is friends with two members of the Weathermen terrorist group that bombed and attempting bombing here in the States.  They killed people.  They are unashamedly communists and buddies with Obama.</p>

You will simply love the attention to detail Jimmah has conjured through years of intellect-breaking and market-numbing ventures in Africa and the Middle East, prompting some Europeans to gape in awe at the meticulous breakdown in even the most simple societies.  Even Englishmen have been known to fall to their knees sobbing why could not Jimmah do more to hurry the pace England is now on?

Thanks, Conrad. Good points.  Yes, I too saw pictures of this media-staged spectacle, and studied them closely.  I would guess that your statements above are entirely accurate.  There were too many dark or dusky faces who were applauding wildly.  (Plus some naive Germans, there for a free concert.)  This is Germany?  These are your Trojan horses within   &mdash;     an army of conquest without firing a shot    &mdash;    surely the easiest invasion and conquest in the history of the world.

			<p>There were Muslim SS units in the German military machine in WWII and they conducted themselves in the finest Muslim fashion of mayhem and slaughter and when captured or surrendered at the end, the Russians treated them harshly. We should too. Wonder how well a BLACK SS unit would have performed? Weapons are our friends.</p>

			<p>&#8220;BUT I just don&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s so bad about Obama. I don&rsquo;t actually know enough about his politics to judge him on those, but he seems intelligent enough, certainly more so than Bush? (Guess you won&rsquo;t like me for this)&#8221;</p>
<p>   Only in relation to the corrupt and incompetent Bush administration does Obama seem &#8220;better&#8221;. Senator Obama is one of the most liberal/leftwing senators in the United States Senate, and he has accomplished little or nothing in his short career. He clearly is not qualified to hold the high office of president and without the fawning promotion of the controlled media he would not have won the Democratic nomination. Obama and his wife have shown evidence of being black nationalists who believe in white guilt and massive black entitlements. While it&rsquo;s possible that Mr. Obama may become a good president, it is unlikely due to his shopworn liberal beliefs and his prevaricating political attitudes.</p>

			<p>Count Barackula will not win  &mdash;  he will be repelled, not by the cross (maybe by the true cross and all it stands for, and the historical European philosophical understanding of that cross), but by White common sense.</p>
<p>He will soon be back in his crypto-Marxist coffin. </p>
<p>Whites may go through the contortions of rock-star adoration, but that&rsquo;s as far as it goes.  Sort of like the &#8220;barking&#8221; behavior at the great Barton-Stone revivals at the first of the last century. After the barking, after the Obamamania, it is back to the fields, back to the daily grind. Nothing of lasting change.</p>
<p>Whites will not allow the undead Marxists to take the lead in this country. The musty, moldy communist garb that Count Barackula wears will be revealed for what it is  &mdash;  and soon.</p>
<p>And as far as Christianity causing this  &mdash;  not true. Most of the churches are the last repository of common sense. There are a few radical ones, but most that still believe in supernatural power, the Atoning Sacrifice (and there are many valid theories of the Atonement) and Christian ethics  &mdash;  I have found them to be remarkably lucid and enlightening.</p>
<p>Christianity shorn of a mystical and supernatural understanding is like a woman shorn of her husband  &mdash;  both are incomplete, not whole, uncomplimented, and lacking a supporting foundation.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s all about being realistic to me and not alienating people who would otherwise be willing to join. </p>
<p>Going too far in your demands, you may well end up achieving nothing. So yes, I do believe that is the way to go.</p>
<p>But you do have a point: We are already silenced. I do not consider myself an extremist yet could not publicly say what I write here. Question is how we can improve that situation.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re absolutely right about the demographic Jihad that has been going on for decades in Europe and is consistently ignored (or silently supported, according to more paranoid minds) by all major political parties and the press.</p>

			<p>If Obama had chosen to describe himself as White instead of Black, he would still be an insignificant senator from Illinois. He chose Black and was then sped on the fast affirmative action path to the presidency.<br>
The left has molded Obama&rsquo;s image into that of a charismatic Messiah who will save the world. The image has fooled a lot of people. </p>
<p>Posted by at 11:15 AM on July 27 </p>
<p>Exactly!</p>
<p>He IS, after all, half White.  So, what if it was the White side of Obama that gave him the intelligence, or, more precisely, the cleverness, to simply use the other half as a mask to feed his ambition.<br>
Those of us who grew up in the late 60&rsquo;s and early 70&rsquo;s and were a part of the first real, large-scale, integration of Races, in Public Schools, and the Work Place, can easily recall a time when a person like Obama would have been ridiculed, relentlessly, by Blacks, as not being Black enough.  <br>
For goodness sakes, WHITES are hiding behind Race in order to appear virtuous and above it all. <br>
So what do you think a half White person, insecure about his half-Whiteness, and doubly insecure (though understandably so) as a result of being abandoned by BOTH parents (a devastating scar that tough love does NOTHING to remove) is going to do?</p>

			<p>If any Germans are reading this, what would you say if America were to decide to withdraw all troops from Europe and turn the bases over to the nations where they are located?  Most of the people who post at this site would be in favor of such a policy because we think Europeans would have to grow up in a hurry.  What do you think?</p>

			<p>For another take, from Star Parker, on the Berlin hoopla, read:</p>
<p>https://www.gopusa.com/commentary/sparker/2008/sp_07281.shtml</p>
<p>Just a brief quote:<br>
<blockquote><br>
At least some of the Germans listening to Obama surely sensed there was something problematic with what he was saying. His analogy of the tearing down of the Berlin wall to tearing down all lines of distinction between nations and religions was obviously fractured. The Berlin wall was a political wall that divided one people. It separated Germans from other Germans, a far cry from distinctions between nations and religions that Obama apparently wants to obliterate.</blockquote></p>
<p>The German, French and British each have a strong sense of national history and identity&hellip;<br>

			<p>Germans have always been given to ideologies of the left or right.  Obama is &#8220;idealistic&#8221; to the Germans because he can be <br>
identified within a Leftist/Marxist framework. Thats what is happening. Germany has learned few lessons from their own past.<br>
They think by automatically acting to the other extreme from the Far Right, they are free of the sins of totalitarian thinking. They arent. </p>

			<p>Re: the comment that the closest German equivalent to an African American would be a Turkish German, it seems to me a close equivalent might be a Gypsy (aka &#8220;Roma,&#8221; &#8220;Zigeuner&#8221; or whatever). I understand they, just like American blacks, have an average IQ of 85. I know from experience how crime-prone and vagrant they are. One in Dublin begged me for money for her sick baby, which turned out to be a plastic doll. In Hamburg one demanded to &#8220;read my fortune.&#8221; In Bucharest one pestered me for food from my plate in a restaurant, and then devoured my leftovers. In St. Petersburg one snatched a soda from my brother&rsquo;s hand as he drank it. Imagine electing a Gypsy, militant and full of grievances, as Chancellor of Germany, and then you&rsquo;ll understand how white Americans might feel about a radical black president.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m a public school teacher in Maryland. In order to matriculate from, say, seventh to eighth grade, a student must attend school for 180 days, with an allowance for absences totalling 24 days (6 days per quarter). Therefore, a student must be in school 156 days to pass his or her classes, without special grade variance forms.</p>
<p>Barry Obama was in the Senate for 143 days, mostly voting &#8220;uuhhhh&#8221;, or &#8220;present&#8221;, or calling for a mulligan because he &#8220;misspoke&#8221; when he voted, before he began running for the most important job in the Free World. </p>
<p>Heck. He couldn&rsquo;t even get out of seventh grade in Maryland&rsquo;s school system.</p>

<p>Ironically, Turks in Germany have been shown to have an IQ of 85 (or was it 86?) as well. (see &#8220;Race differences in intelligence&#8221; by Richard Lynn, a book so honest it&rsquo;s almost mean, highly recommended) </p>

<p>As to US troops on European soil, it seems to me their role has evolved from that of an occupying force to that of a protector in the cold war era, and now your bases are simply practical hubs for you to bring your wounded to from Iraq and such. <br>
I don&rsquo;t mind them in that function.</p>
<p>Already, many bases are being closed anyway. </p>
<p>A US Major I once discussed that with did not share my opinion and pretty bluntly informed me you were still here as occupiers to make sure we don&rsquo;t elect the &#8220;wrong guy&#8221;. </p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s how it is, I would prefer them to leave as well. As much as I like the US, we do have the right to full national sovereignty. </p>
<p>&#8220;because we think Europeans would have to grow up in a hurry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, nothing much would change I think. We still wouldn&rsquo;t spend that much more on defense, and we&rsquo;d still be stuck with our leftwing dominated media and politics. </p>
<p>I hear Bush offered a complete withdrawal when Germany vetoed Iraq in the UN btw (not sure if that&rsquo;s true though). Seems our politicians don&rsquo;t really care too much. </p>

<p>Because, German-guy, he is a hard-line Marxist (as is his opponent and the current President), and as a non-White, non-Christian (like his opponent and the current President), he is in no way, shape, or form an acceptable candidate for public office of any description in a White, Christian country.</p>

			<p><i>&#8220;&hellip;Well, I don&rsquo;t speak German, but I do speak Spanish and I read El Pais, a paper from Madrid, almost everyday online. The Spanish are enamoured of Obama. They even had a cartoon where two people are talking and one says that if Obama were running for president over there (in Spain) he&rsquo;d blow the opposition away, but that won&rsquo;t happen in the U.S. The other person says &ldquo;Yes, the gringos are rotten, aren&rsquo;t they, Miss Scarlett?&rdquo; So, American Whites are called gringos and on top of it they had to take a jab at the White Southerners. Nice&hellip;..&#8221;</i></p>
<p>This cartoon may have been printed in a Spanish paper, but there is no way it originated there.  &nbsp;&nbsp;Even in Andalucia where I used to live, Spaniards DO NOT refer to their fellow Caucasians as &#8220;gringos&#8221; (it is a Mexican term), and they would never have any reason to take jabs at the American South.  &nbsp;&nbsp;I guarantee you that it was authored by someone on <i>this</i> side of the pond.  &nbsp;&nbsp;Someone who <i>does</i> hate Whites.</p>

			<p>Liebe Freunden! Thanks for the info about Turkish IQs. But after reconsidering, I realized not even Gypsies and Turks could match the violence of American Blacks. A quick glance at our crime rates tells the story:</p>
<p>https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/05cius/data/table_49.html</p>
<p>Over 50% of our murders are committed by a certain 12% of our population. Rape and assault statistics are similarly lopsided. This, even though the Feds count Hispanic criminals as white to make the crime rates a little more even. For example, please read what it says for &#8220;RACE&#8221; under this guy:</p>
<p>C:\Documents and Settings\owner\My Documents\Polit\Wanted Posters\DEA Fugitives, Boston Fugitives, DELACRUZ.htm</p>
<p>I suppose President Obama will take away even this much information, and shut down this &ldquo;hate&#8221; site too.</p>
<p>Celebrate diversity!<br>
