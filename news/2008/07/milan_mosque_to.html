<h1><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7493756.stm">Milan Mosque &lsquo;To Be Closed Down&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, July 7, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A controversial mosque in the Italian city of Milan is to be shut down, the country&rsquo;s right-wing government says.</p>
<p>The Jenner mosque attracts about 4,000 Muslims each week, with Friday prayers often spilling out on to the street.</p>
<p>Now, after years of complaints from local residents, Italian Interior Minister Roberto Maroni has said he will close the mosque by August.</p>
<p>A leading Roman Catholic has accused Mr Maroni of behaving like a fascist. He has rejected that charge.</p>
<p><b>Rendition</b></p>
<p>The Jenner mosque is based in a converted garage.</p>
<p>Since it opened as an Islamic cultural centre in 1988, it has outgrown its cramped surroundings &mdash; much to the alarm of people living in the neighbourhood, says the BBC&rsquo;s Christian Fraser in Rome.</p>
<p>It has come under the spotlight several times for alleged links to extremism.</p>
<p>The Muslim cleric, Abu Omar, who was known for his fiery preaching, says he was kidnapped on his way to the mosque in 2003.</p>
<p>He claims he was then transferred to Egypt, where he was tortured.</p>
<p>Twenty-six suspected CIA agents and several Italian intelligence officials are currently on trial in Milan over his alleged rendition.</p>
<p>Most of them are being tried in absentia.</p>
<p><b>&lsquo;Nomads&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Mr Maroni, who belongs to the anti-immigrant Northern League, has said he will press ahead with plans to close the mosque, and that anybody found praying in the street will be issued with a ticket.</p>
<p>The local Muslim community is being offered the use of a nearby stadium, in which the Beatles once played.</p>
<p>However, the council has said it can only be used four times each week and that each person will be charged on entry.</p>
<p>The president of the mosque, Abdel Hamid Shaari, has said he is happy to pay rent but that its members &#8220;won&rsquo;t be treated like nomads&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are Milanese and we are not going to accept the solution that&rsquo;s being offered,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><b>Catholic support</b></p>
<p>The Catholic church has come out in support of the Muslim community.</p>
<p>The Roman Catholic priest in charge of inter-faith relations in Milan, Monsignor Gianfranco Bottoni, said that only a fascist or populist government would resort to such dictatorial methods as closing a mosque.</p>
<p>In an interview with the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, Mr Maroni said he was addressing residents&rsquo; complaints that worship regularly spilled out on to the street.</p>
<p>He said he had faced similar criticism from the UN children&rsquo;s fund (Unicef), when the Italian government announced that it was fingerprinting all Roma people of gypsies.</p>
<p>However, he had convinced Unicef that the move would help get Roma children into mainstream schools, he said.<br>
