						<p>Doudou Diene, a Sengalese lawyer and the United Nations Human Rights Council special rapporteur on racism, has completed a tour of eight American cities, where he gathered firsthand information on issues related to racial discrimination and xenophobia.</p>
<p>At a June 6 press conference in the UN Information Center in Washington, D.C., Diene talked with reporters about some preliminary findings of his three week tour. While citing some positive things such as the nomination of Senator Barack Obama (D-Ill.) as the Democratic Party candidate for the presidency, Diene focused on U.S. shortcomings such as re-segregation of minority communities. The expert on racism and special investigator cited racial bias in the criminal justice system and talked about how underfunding of public education plays a role in deepening racial inequality. Diene explained he is not a UN employee and that he would be reporting to the UN General Assembly in the spring of 2009, but that his findings would be shared with U.S. government officials.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Baraka told The Final Call the Diene tour was an &#8220;opportunity to expose the underbelly of White supremacy in the country.&#8221; The number one fight for people of color in the 21st century is the fight for human rights, Baraka said.</p>
<p>In March, his organization charged the Bush administration with failing to comply with its obligations under the International Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination, an international treaty that the United States signed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Miami, Diene heard testimony from Sofian Abdelaziz Zakkout, director of the American Muslim Association of North America, who discussed issues related to immigration, racial profiling and discrimination against the dress of Muslim women.</p>
<p>Aesop Ameen, director of the association&rsquo;s prison committee, talked about the difficulties Muslims experience in prison when trying to adhere to their faith, including challenges when trying to pray.</p>
<p>Muslim civil rights advocate Ahmed Bedier explained to Diene how &#8220;Islamaphobia&#8221; and &#8220;anti-Muslim rhetoric&#8221; from officials and pundits are contributing to hate crimes against Muslims across Florida.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Damon Hewitt, an NAACP Legal Defense Fund attorney, said Diene also got a look into the workings of the prison system through testimony about conditions at the Louisiana State Prison at Angola, a former 18,000 acre slave plantation. Testimony delivered before the special rapporteur showed little has changed in the last several hundred years of the prison&rsquo;s existence. Even Congress recently heard complaints about the prison&rsquo;s practice of keeping some inmates in solitary confinement for decades, said advocates.</p>

			<p>Who commissioned this anti-White knucklehead to do this one-sided story?  And furthermore, why didn&rsquo;t he ask Whites how they felt about racism?  Do these people actually think racial hatred is a one-way street?  Come to my neck of the woods Mr. Diene and I&rsquo;ll show you some race-baiting thugs.<br>

			<p>DouDou- that name says it all.</p>
<p>How convenient DoDo examined racism from the black and muslim standpoint only.  He should have spoken with Channon Christian or Christian Newsome&rsquo;s parents for one.</p>
<p>As for what this lackey supposedly discovered, I couldn&rsquo;t give a damn.  Americans do not answer to him or the UN.</p>

			<p>If he had gotten mugged by blacks, he&rsquo;d decry that opportunities for them are so limited they&rsquo;re forced to turn to crime.</p>
<p>As long as there are blacks in the world, stupidity, violence, and utter confusion will all be problems for the rest of mankind to deal with. </p>

			<p>&#8220;The expert on racism and special investigator cited racial bias in the criminal justice system&#8221;</p>
<p>Translation: More blacks are convicted of committing crimes than their percentage of the national population, even when Hispanics are somehow &#8220;white&#8221; in regards to perpetrators - hence, there must be an inherent flaw in the system.</p>
<p>&#8220;Muslim civil rights advocate Ahmed Bedier explained to Diene how &ldquo;Islamaphobia&rdquo; and &ldquo;anti-Muslim rhetoric&rdquo; from officials and pundits are contributing to hate crimes against Muslims across Florida.&#8221;</p>
<p>Excuse me, but I thought he was investigating bizarre allegations of &#8220;racism&#8221;?</p>

			<p>Poor whining minorities. Why don&rsquo;t they return home and take their religion with them. Most only come here to spit out kids and get on welfare. If the muzzies have trouble in prison, so what. Give them an opportunity to return to muzzieland where they belong. This is a Christian country founded on family &amp; Christian values. We as a general rule do not torture people with power drills and lop off heads.</p>

			<p>I read somewhere the UN releasing a report that listed the USA as one of the worst places for children. The UN, among other things, is very anti-USA. I have no respect for such an organization which has made clear through past actions that they do nothing and criticize those that do.</p>

			<p>Amazing. A lawyer from Africa comes to America and decides there is anti-black racism. I guess the only solution will be to import more people from Africa. I wonder if this person has conducted any investigations in Zimbabwe or one of the many black countries that routinely discriminates against whites.</p>

Airplanes, automobiles, phones, computers, internet, radar, elevators, high-rises, air-conditioning, refrigeration, modern medicines, on and on.  What has this man done of any distinction to criticize our great nation?</p>

<p>In a less enlightened age, he would have been arrested, thrown in a cell, and never heard from again.</p>
<p>Eventually, our society will solve this problem by moving to one of those two extremes.</p>

			<p>The UN is an evil organization hell-bent on destroying what is left of white western civilization.  It has no business polluting US soil with it&rsquo;s socialist third world agenda. By the way shouldn&rsquo;t the Sengalese lawyer be more concerned with getting his country into at least the 19th century than worrying about us?</p>

			<p>Hopefully &#8220;DooDoo&#8221; will stay the hell home where he belongs&hellip; and out of our &#8220;racist&#8221; America. Furthermore, if Muslims feel discriminated against because of their dress code, they&rsquo;re collectively invited to pack up and leave. We did quite well without their presence and surely can easily get used to their going.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m sick of non-whites, especially in white countries AND ESPECIALLY in positions of power whining about &#8220;white supremacy&#8221;.  These same people don&rsquo;t mind using our taxes, government and white-created institutions for their own ends.</p>

			<p>Natural selection of the fittest, natural segregation of the races, competition for a limited number of resources, is natural. To attempt to impose a guilt trip upon the strong, the successful, the survivors, the whites, and the Asians, is to admit that you think that what is natural, what is right, is in fact unnatural, and is therefore is wrong!</p>
<p>Guilt trips are NEVER laid upon the inferior, the weak, and the losers in any society. Put these people in charge and you have a modern day Africa. </p>
<p>So here comes a gentleman de color under the perfunctory guise of a racial case worker for the UN? Get real! Assume if you will, that somehow by chance, the white and Asian races were collected together in the most inhospitable part of the world (a part that was lacking in any desirable resource); and similarly, people of color were likewise collected together in the most desirable areas of the world.</p>
<p>TWENTY YEARS LATER.</p>
<p>O.K. Lets take a vote here. </p>
<p>How many here feel that the people of color would be running the world?             </p>
<p>How many here feel that mean old whitey would once again be taking advantage of the poor black man.</p>
<p>How many here feel that the yellow man would be usurping whitey from the head of the table?</p>
<p>The bottom line is this: all this political correctness, multi cultural one world orderism, affirmative action (negative discrimination), black is beautiful polyglot, in any language, is just about as natural as beastiality! This interloper needs to try Africa if he wants to see how people of color benefit from a lack of white racism. Of course he may just get eaten in the process!</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s really quite remarkable that a Senegalese African &#8220;official&#8221; would be invited to this country to look into &#8220;racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Consider: Americans of Black African ancestry currently enjoy the highest standard of living of any Black Africans in the world, with incomes hundreds of times higher than those of native Africans living in their original environment.</p>
<p>American Black Africans commit crime at a rate 800% higher than American whites and Hispanics.</p>
<p>I think I speak for most Americans, Hispanic, Asian, or European when I point out that I&rsquo;d be more than happy to see all willing black Africans repatriated to sub-Sahara Africa forthwith.  Of course, there would be no takers for this offer.</p>

			<p>This DoDo and the U.N. and this entire article have so many things that bother me. For example, the damn Muslims in prison! to BE there, they have already violated a number of tenets of the Muslim faith. I also see, as the rest of you do, that he only &#8216;interviewed&rsquo; blacks and Muslims so what did he think he was going to hear? exactly what he wanted to hear. He should visit Kuwait and Saudi Arabia for some REAL human rights violations. And no U.N. &#8220;official&#8221; is going to visit Africa now since the ones were killed in Zim. The situation in Africa is well known and nothing can or will or should be done about it. The U.N. should be thrown out of the U.S. and we should stop supporting it. Perhaps an AR reader has the statistics of how much of the U.N. budget the U.S. pays yet Senegal has an equal say in where that money goes (such as into Mugabe&rsquo;s pockets)i note that the U.N is the first two letters of UNnecessarry, UNeeded, UNproductive, UNable, UNcooperative and quite a number of other UNs And the building occupies some pretty high dollar real estate that could be put to better use, sayyyyyy as a junk yard.</p>

			<p>from the article - The expert on racism and special investigator cited racial bias in the criminal justice system and talked about how underfunding of public education plays a role in deepening racial inequality.</p>
<p>I wonder what his evidence of the racial bias in the criminal justice system is? I bet it is nothing more than racially disproportionate crime statistics. As to his finding on public education, if true, is it only underfunded for the minority students? That is not the case where I live. Just the opposite is true for more money is spent per pupil in the urban areas than in the whiter surrounding suburbs yet they still bus the minorities out to the surrounding towns as they continue down their road of denial.</p>

			<p>Allow me to offer another take on this Senegalese &#8220;lawyer&rsquo;s&#8221; view on what is commonly called racism in America:</p>
<p>Racism is not so much unreasoned discrimination against blacks.  Rather, it&rsquo;s the settled conclusion of many decades of empirical observation of black behavior and achievement levels in this and every other country in the world.</p>
<p>These dismal facts and observations have remained intractably unchanged despite nearly fifty years of almost desperate efforts to move blacks to the front of the line in everything from hiring, employee retention, education, and income redistribution. </p>
<p>Of course, this is interpreted by the true believers as but additional proof that white racism is such a powerful force that even the most strenuous efforts to elevate blacks are thwarted by the invisible hand of discrimination.  </p>
<p>What is inexplicable, even in the face of this strange reasoning, is how Asians overcome these ostensible barriers, not in several generations, but pretty much on their first attempts.</p>

<p>How dare a black &#8220;official&#8221; from the United Nation of Thugs cry racism at our expense while ignoring the genocide of whites in Africa and throughout Western Civilization!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tired of the one-way street!  How about a White History Month?  How about a White Congressional Caucus?  How about a White Entertainment Television station?  How about a few Charter schools that cater to whites?  How about a few White Support Groups like the NAACP or La Raza?</p>
<p>How much more discrimination and persecution must our people swallow before we rise up in our defense?</p>
<p>European Americans (White Americans) built this country; and now Blacks, Muslims and Mexicans are stealing it right under our noses!  </p>
<p>We, as European Americans and the founding peoples of this country, must defend what&rsquo;s left of our country, our race and our culture before it all disappears to dust&hellip;</p>

			<p>&#8220;A lawyer from Africa comes to America and decides there is anti-black racism. I guess the only solution will be to import more people from Africa.&#8221;<br>

Ahh, just the opposite, really. If they were all &#8216;repatriated&rsquo; back to the loving shores of Mother Africa we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to treat them with any kind of racism. Problem solved.</p>

			<p>One of the many Obama positions that is being withheld from the public is  his &#8220;UN tax&#8221;. it&rsquo;s a bill that would allocate 3/4% of the GNP to a fund to end world poverty. This would be administered by the UN, not the USA. A UN tax.</p>
<p>Try looking up something critical of Obama on google. You won&rsquo;t be able to. The topic  will come up, but it will have an Obama slant.  The news media, including the the internet search engines, are in the tank for Obama. </p>

			<p>Not to beat on a dead horse but McCain has, as part of his platform, a plan to replace the UN with an organization that ONLY allows western democracies.  If such an organization were created, it would quickly make the UN obsolete.  Very soon afterward the US would very likely leave the UN.  Without us, it would collapse&hellip;.especially if the other countries included in the new organization left too.<br>

			<p>Well if Mr. Doudou Diene were to visit China he would probaly note very little racism. Why, is it because the Chinese are so tolerant or is it because China is filled with Chinese people?</p>
<p>There are two solutions to racism. One is total tolerance and the other is segregation. Ask yourself whick has been proven to work historically. People of diffenent races and even religions need to be kept apart, they are happier being around there own kind. </p>
<p>The only way to force peole to live togather is under a totalitarian government, they still dislike each other but are afraid to talk about it. I may be able to force the lion to lie down with the lamb but they are never going to be good roommates.</p>

			<p>Adding to the &#8220;humor&#8221; of the above story&hellip; READ the NYT article on today&rsquo;s MSN news&hellip;</p>

<p>Pleae note: ANYONE REFUSING TO VOTE FOR OR SUPPORT OBAMA WILL BE DEEMED A RACIST!</p>
<p>The endless whine by Blacks that they&rsquo;re &#8220;discriminated against.&#8221; That opportunities for them are limited. (That those nasty Whites won&rsquo;t hire a young Black, functioning at about 4th grade level in math, grammer, etc. as A CORPORATE VICE PRESIDENT! Those evil racists!)</p>
<p>Polls generally are virtually useless. The kicker here is the NYT and MSN running this story, the gist of which is that the Obamination has little real hope of winning in November. Due, of course, of course&hellip; TO WHITE RACIST FEELINGS!</p>
<p>I said it before, and repeat it&hellip; If the Republican Party would get their act together. Hold a meeting with McBush, laying the law down to McCain that for the good of the Republican Party he MUST DROP OUT   &mdash;   citing health and age issues. The Republicans could draft Romney and waltz into the White House. Putting anything other than a Bush clone into the race would GUARANTEE a Republican win over Obama. His lies, his inexperience, his thinly disguised racism!</p>

Until then, Mr. Poo Poo needs to take his unfounded rhetoric back to his spear chucking country.</p>

			<p>I always find it amazing when white people claim to be victims of racism.  In particular, white people like to cite the Congressional Black Caucus, BET, and the NAACP.  It never seems to register that these groups and entities exist as a direct result of white racism.  You want White Entertainment Television?  It&rsquo;s called CBS, NBC, ABC, and every other network you can name.  Congressional White Caucus?  It is simply called Congress.  NAACP - if I&rsquo;m not mistaken there have been and are plenty exclusionary groups of, for, and by white people.  There are also any number of groups that cater to the needs of individual ethnicities.  There are groups and clubs for Italians, Germans, Irish, etc.  When has there EVER been a law passed in this country that said white people couldn&rsquo;t go here or  there, or use certain facilities or accommodations?  You talk about welfare as though blacks were the majority recipients.  There are more white people on welfare than any minority group (perhaps all put together).  Affirmative Action for whites is called &#8220;legacy&#8221;.  Your daddy went, your granddaddy went, so you can go.  They went in a time when those oppotunities were denied to black people.  </p>
<p>America wants to stand on a soap box and tell the rest of the world what to do and how to behave.  Well, what&rsquo;s good for the goose.  </p>
<p>You invite American of Africa descent to go home, because we don&rsquo;t come from here.  Well, neither do you.  Unless you are an American Indian, your aancestors came from somewhere else.  And white people did not build this nation alone.  To hear you tell it, white people did everything.  That is so far from the truth that the it can&rsquo;t see the truth from where it is standing.  You forget that it was enslaved Africans who did most of the heavy lifting (both north and south) and performed the labor that helped to create the wealth of this nation. Go back to Africa?  Go back to Europe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny how some of you now group yourselves with Asians and hispanics, to the exclusion of black people.  You hate hispanics.  Or do you not recognize that all the hoopla about illegal immigration is mostly pointed toward them.  If there were no black people in this country, then you&rsquo;d turn on the Asians and everyone else you consider different, less than, and inferior to you.  We white people the only people here, you&rsquo;d divide into groups and try to destroy each other. Were that not true, there would be no history of war in Ireland, or continental Europe.  </p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t get me started about the problems in Africa.  After centuries of colonialism, missionaries, and the stealing of Africa&rsquo;s wealth of resources, of course there are problems. </p>
<p>After almost 400 years of slavery, oppression, violence, segregation, discrimination, and bigotry - you marvel that black people have the unmitigated gall to harbor ill feelings toward white so-called Christians.  Read a Bible lately?  I suggest you get into the New Testament and study up on what being a Christian really means.  &#8220;they will know we are christians by or love (of ourselves).</p>
<p>The saddest thing is that this contribution won&rsquo;t make you think. You won&rsquo;t give the slightest thoughtful consideration to what I&rsquo;ve had to say. You will dismiss it, attack it, and slight grossly exaggerated statistics to prove to me that it is black people who cause all the ills of the world.  It&rsquo;s never white people.  No - all the racism in the world originates and is perpetrated by people of color.  God bless America (or what you really mean is white america.  no one else counts in the prayer or in the equation.  </p>

<p>Defending is old news. In fact, what&rsquo;s left to defend? Should we defend our colleges, our government, our corporations (Ok, I defend our corporations as long as it has nothing to do with their racial policies, or social policies)? Should we defend our tax laws, our education system? There&rsquo;s not much left to defend. You can have it, though, if that&rsquo;s what you want. As for me I think we need to work on creating a new nation, call it what you will, just for whites. </p>

			<p>&#8220;I always find it amazing when white people claim to be victims of racism. In particular, white people like to cite the Congressional Black Caucus, BET, and the NAACP. It never seems to register that these groups and entities exist as a direct result of white racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>How? There are no comparable entities for whites. Your notion doens&rsquo;t &#8220;register&#8221; because it&rsquo;s absurd. </p>
<p>&#8220;You want White Entertainment Television? It&rsquo;s called CBS, NBC, ABC, and every other network you can name.&#8221;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re joking, aren&rsquo;t you? These networks&rsquo; products would be hard to beat for black pandering and ridiculous, grotesque idealizations of blacks. Anyone from outer space watching CBS, NBC and ABC must conclude that American blacks are a race of space-traveling brain surgeons, whose only problem is those atavistic, evil white people engaged in a disinterested, wicked campaign to Keep The Black Man Down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Congressional White Caucus? It is simply called Congress.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now I know you&rsquo;re kidding. &#8220;Congress&#8221; is that mostly white legislative body that has passed every unconstitutional black-empowering &#8220;law&#8221; of the last five decades. If Congress were actively pursuing the interests of whites, the country would be a very different sort of place. No affirmative action, no welfare, no Section 8, no plethora of government &#8220;programs&#8221; that make the subsidized lives of most blacks possible in the first place. How many black votes were passed in favor of the Civil Rights Act, or any of the rest of it?</p>
<p>&#8220;There are also any number of groups that cater to the needs of individual ethnicities. There are groups and clubs for Italians, Germans, Irish, etc.&#8221;</p>
<p>How many of them passsed federal legislation?</p>
<p>&#8220;There are more white people on welfare than any minority group (perhaps all put together).&#8221;</p>
<p>Why do our opponents insist on mouthing this falsehood? Here are the official statistics; blacks comprise a much larger welfare population, both in percentage and raw numbers, and are much likelier to be on welfare than whites are:</p>
<p><a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/hsp/indicators06/ch1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://aspe.hhs.gov/hsp/indicators06/ch1.htm</a></p>
<p>&#8220;America wants to stand on a soap box and tell the rest of the world what to do and how to behave&#8221;</p>
<p>Most of us here couldn&rsquo;t care less about how the &#8220;rest of the world&#8221; behaves; we just don&rsquo;t want them dictating how our nation ought to be run. Especially cretins from African pestholes.</p>
<p>&#8220;To hear you tell it, white people did everything. That is so far from the truth that the it can&rsquo;t see the truth from where it is standing. You forget that it was enslaved Africans who did most of the heavy lifting (both north and south) and performed the labor that helped to create the wealth of this nation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blacks picked cotton and tobacco. They were largely a failure at anything else, though there are minor exceptions. And they were only able to pick cotton and tobacco because white people knew how to grow, harvest and market them. Left to the average capabilities of blacks, America wouldn&rsquo;t be markedly different from any black nation, which is to say it would be stuck in the stone (or, allowing for a more generous interpretation) the iron age.</p>
<p>&#8220;Or do you not recognize that all the hoopla about illegal immigration is mostly pointed toward them [mestizos]&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, you see, mestizos comprise by far the largest portion of illegal aliens, so any thought or measure concerning illegal immigration must perforce involve mestizos. It&rsquo;s pretty simple. And of course we don&rsquo;t like having hordes of them here. Why should we? Assuming that none of the posters here is a chicken baron, what positive thing do we derive from La Raza? Plenty of negatives are obvious: rising crime, rising taxes, ruined schools, third-world truculence, closing hospitals, exotic new diseases, every variety of Latin American degeneracy. Why on earth shouldn&rsquo;t we oppose all that?</p>
<p>&#8220;We white people the only people here, you&rsquo;d divide into groups and try to destroy each other. Were that not true, there would be no history of war in Ireland, or continental Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Merely silly. That whites of opposing nations have engaged in warfare hardly proves that a &#8220;white&#8221; America would fight amongst itself. Why wasn&rsquo;t it behaving that way in 1965, when the country was 90% white and blacks had not been subsidized with housing in WhiteyLand? In fact black America provides a better example of what you&rsquo;re thinking about. Barely a day goes by here in Chicagoland without some new lachrymose tale of some black punk who&rsquo;s been shot by some other black criminal.</p>
<p>&#8220;After centuries of colonialism, missionaries, and the stealing of Africa&rsquo;s wealth of resources, of course there are problems.&#8221;</p>
<p>Africa&rsquo;s problems are its people. The US, Canada and Australia were European colonies far longer than most regions of Africa were; why don&rsquo;t we have African-style problems? As for &#8220;stealing resources,&#8221; I would like to know 1)how a herd of primitive pastorals or hunter-gatherers would ever have known of these &#8220;resources&#8221; if not for whites, 2)what such a society would have done with, say, crude oil, 3)why Nigeria, an independent nation sitting on the sixth-largest supply of oil on earth is just as &#8220;troubled&#8221; as its African neighbors and 4)why all these problems become more not less severe as Western imperialism fades into the past; shouldn&rsquo;t the opposite be true?</p>
<p>&#8220;After almost 400 years of slavery, oppression, violence, segregation, discrimination, and bigotry - you marvel that black people have the unmitigated gall to harbor ill feelings toward white so-called Christians.&#8221;</p>
<p>You ought to examine your arithmetic. In any case I would like to meet this 400-year-old black person. I&rsquo;d agree that 400 years is a long time to undergo anything.</p>
<p>&#8220;Read a Bible lately?&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suggest you get into the New Testament and study up on what being a Christian really means.&#8221;</p>
<p>Where does the New Testament command us to view blacks as desirable neighbors, to excuse black crime, to consent to welfare-state theft, or generally to ignore brute reality? Does the NT say anything dispositive of differences in average intelligence or proneness to crime among the races? Do NT injunctions to love one&rsquo;s neighbor apply to, say, the Carr brothers, or to the defendants in the Knoxville case? Or do they only apply to white people who write things you don&rsquo;t like?</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&rsquo;t give the slightest thoughtful consideration to what I&rsquo;ve had to say. You will dismiss it, attack it, and slight grossly exaggerated statistics to prove to me that it is black people who cause all the ills of the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve heard it all before. We&rsquo;ve given &#8220;thoughtful consideration&#8221; to all of these lies, half-truths and sophistries, and unfortunately for you we generally recognize shoddy logic when we see it. As for statistics, it&rsquo;s interesting that you anticipate our response in this way, a tacit concession that your argument is grounded primarily in theology and not in a dispassionate look at brute facts. No one has ever said that &#8220;it is black people who cause all the ills of the world;&#8221; if you&rsquo;re going to say this kind of thing you ought either to give up your condemnation of &#8220;exaggeration&#8221; or give fourth-grade English another try. Only a fool or a liar would engage in the casual disregard for truth that you&rsquo;d like to see us adopt.</p>

<p>Nonsense.  The wealth of Africa - oil, diamonds, minerals, was nothing to Africans.  It had no value to them until Europeans wanted these things.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve heard all of your arguments before.  They are not even specious, they are just wrong, and we&rsquo;re not buying them anymore.  The problems of black people are your problems - not ours.  White people just aren&rsquo;t buying your excuses anymore, and we really don&rsquo;t care about you as a people.  Get used to it.

			<p>&#8220;Stealing of resources&#8221;?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see just wat has been &#8220;stolen&#8221;.</p>
<p>AIOEC - the Association of Iron Ore Exporting Countries includes Mauritania, Guinea-Bissau and Sierra Leone.</p>
<p>IBA - the International Bauxite Association includes Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone and Ghana.</p>
<p>COPAL - the Cocoa Producers Alliance incudes the Ivory Coast, Togo, Nigeria and Cameroon.</p>
<p>Cafe Mondial includes the Ivory Coast and Angola.</p>
<p>OPEC includes Nigeia and Gabon as its black African members.</p>
<p>ITC - the International Tin Council includes Nigeria and the Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire).</p>
<p>Mercury producers formed a conasortium to fix and manipulate prices in 1974.  This includes Nigeria.</p>
<p>CIPEC - the International Council of Copper Producing Countries includes the Republic of the Congo and Zambia.</p>
<p>Far from being &#8220;stolen from&#8221;, black Africa is gouging prices for strategic minerals for as much as the market will bear.</p>
<p>I have a great idea.  The US, Canada, Argentina, Australia, Poland and the Ukraine should form OGEC - the Organization of Grain Exporting Countries.  By cutting production and introducting export quotas, we could probably triple the price of wheat, corn and soybeans around the rest of the world.  A parallel Rice Exporters Cartel including the US and Brazil could achieve much the same thing with rice.  </p>
<p>Obviously our farm products are being stolen from us by the greedy pigs of the Third World who are too lazy to grow their own crops.</p>
