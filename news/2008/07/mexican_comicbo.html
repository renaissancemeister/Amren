<h1>Mexican Comic-Book Character Called Racist</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ed Lavandera, CNN. July 9, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A comic-book character popular in Mexico for generations has run into a cultural barrier at the border, where Americans see him as a racist caricature.</p>
<p>For more than 60 years Mexicans have followed the adventures of &#8220;Memin Pinguin.&#8221; But the dark-skinned Memin&rsquo;s exaggerated features in &#8220;Memin for President&#8221; came as a shock to Houston, Texas, Wal-Mart shopper Shawnedria McGinty.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She&rsquo;d never heard of &#8220;Memin Pinguin.&#8221; She bought a Spanish-English dictionary and tried translating but still didn&rsquo;t like what she saw. </p>
<p>&#8220;So I asked my boyfriend, does that look like a monkey to you?&#8221; she said. &#8220;And we went back and forth and he was like, no, that&rsquo;s a black woman,&#8221; referring to the character&rsquo;s Aunt Jemima-like mother.</p>
<p>McGinty and Houston community activist Quannel X want the comic books removed from the stores.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Mexican readers who grew up following the shenanigans of Memin say critics need to look beyond the cover and understand the stories.</p>
<p>&#8220;They will bring a smile to their face because we&rsquo;re so fond of that character,&#8221; said Javier Salas, a Spanish-language talk show host on Chicago radio station WRTO. &#8220;We respect him, we love him. And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so absurd for us to hear complaints from people who don&rsquo;t know, don&rsquo;t understand Memin.&#8221;</p>
<p>Memin is a poor Cuban-Mexican kid with bug eyes, thick lips and protruding ears. The mischievous and caring boy helps his mother by selling newspapers and shining shoes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wal-Mart spokesman Lorenzo Lopez said the retailer has instructed stores to remove the books from shelves and discontinue sales.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The store has received no other complaints about Memin, Lopez said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Memin is no stranger to controversy. Three years ago, a series of Mexican stamps honoring Memin ignited an international uproar. The stamps were discontinued because of protests from African-American leaders.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is saying we respect and regard the African-American community by making them look like Sambos on a stamp?&#8221; the Rev. Al Sharpton said at the time. &#8220;This goes over the line.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Look how they portray his mother, with huge ethnic lips, dark skin, making her look like the big gorilla and him like the little monkey.&#8221;</p>
<p>But fans of Memin say the valuable lessons of a beloved comic book character tackling real-life problems have been lost in translation.</p>
