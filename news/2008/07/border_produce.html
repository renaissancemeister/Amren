<p>Rafael Edmundo Melo Jr., 40, killed himself the day after appearing in federal court to face charges that he had allowed truckloads of vegetables and flowers infested with harmful pests to enter the United States from Mexico without proper fumigation.</p>
<p>While the death of the veteran plant inspector brought pain and sadness to his family, the conspiracy with which he and two other U.S. Department of Agriculture inspectors were accused had the potential to cause further damage to the nation&rsquo;s agricultural industry.</p>
<p>The scheme, which went on at least three years and ended when the defendants were arrested in April, could have decimated dozens of Texas agricultural industries, government and industry officials say. Some experts believe the effects of the tainted shipments could still harm crops.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Melo and the two other USDA inspectors were also charged with filing fraudulent overtime payments, claiming they oversaw fumigations of infested shipments that were conducted improperly or never took place. Charges were also brought against the owner of a Laredo pest control company accused of improperly billing Mexican exporters for fumigation services.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Prewett [Ray Prewett, president of Texas Citrus Mutual in McAllen and executive vice president of the Texas Vegetable Association] noted that Mexico, which exports large amounts of limes and lemons, has confirmed that two insects known to introduce disease to citrus have been found in the country&rsquo;s groves. South Texas is the home of a thriving grapefruit and orange industry that generates $80 million annually for growers and packers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>The power of a pest</b></p>
<p>The full extent of the scheme has not been revealed. But a federal indictment cited seven shipments in January and March of more than 2.5 million floral cuttings and 28,000 pounds of raw broccoli that were improperly fumigated. When the charges were unsealed in a Laredo federal court in April, a prosecutor told the judge that cabbage and other foods were also involved.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Plant shipments entering the country from Mexico at Laredo are screened by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers assigned to the city&rsquo;s five border stations and its airport, said CBP official Mucia Dovalina.</p>
<p>If a harmful pest is discovered by the CBP&rsquo;s 55 agricultural specialists, the broker for the Mexican shipper is given the choice of returning the produce or paying to have it fumigated under USDA supervision. In cases where a particularly harmful pest is found, the entire shipment must be destroyed, Dovalina said.</p>
<p>In addition to fumigation costs, which average $600, the Mexican shipper must pay overtime charges for USDA inspectors. Such fees are common because many of the shipments reach the border after 4 p.m, when USDA inspectors typically go home for the day.</p>
<p>The CBP in Laredo maintains a list of 28 harmful pests and diseases that require the return, fumigation, or destruction of the plants that carry them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Two of the three defendants are awaiting sentencing by a federal judge. Earlier this month, Jose Homero Reyes, 48, a USDA inspector, pleaded guilty to three counts against him, including allowing infested agricultural products to enter the country in violation of the U.S. Plant Protection Act. Originally charged with 11 counts, Reyes is set to be sentenced in September and could face up to 15 years in prison.</p>
<p>Last month, Laredo resident Arturo Ramirez, the 46-year-old owner of Ambush Exterminators, pleaded guilty to six counts, including conspiring with others to improperly fumigate plants. Ramirez, originally charged with 19 counts, will also be sentenced in September and could face up to 30 years.</p>
<p>Former USDA inspector Robert Perez, a 35-year-old former USDA inspector, plans to fight the charges against him, his lawyer said. &#8220;We&rsquo;re going to present our evidence in court and let the jury decide,&#8221; said his San Antonio lawyer, Albert M. Gutierrez.</p>

			<p>This reminds me of the recent salmonella outbreak.  Several times, on the evening cable tv talk shows, there have been guests worried that this outbreak would spark a backlash against Mexican &#8220;migrants.&#8221;  One went so far as to predict of &#8220;nativist wave of violence.&#8221;  Here you go, an infectious disease is spreading, and people are worried about diversity.</p>

			<p>It has been clear for quite sometime to me that since this whole salmonella tomatoe fiasco started that the Feds have contorted themselves in every direction except the truth to avoid publicizing anything negative about Mexico or Mexicans as it relates to food borne illnesses in this country. Check the Raleigh News and Observer article out on some work NC health authorities did and pay attention to the names of the businesses cited. Of course this is small potatoes compared to this story here at AMREN. Just refer to the ICE/CPB southern border corruption stories involving Hispanic surnamed inspectors. For every Copean and Ramos, there&rsquo;s probably a thousand of the other kind.  We need corn fed blond headed farm boys from Indiana on the border!</p>

			<p>All the defendants are Hispanic.  I get the impression that hiring Hispanics to oversee the border with Mexico might not be the brightest idea - at least until such time when American Hispanics stop considering themselves &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; and only consider themselves &#8220;American&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Is it loyalty to the motherland, or simple greed?  I think that if greed were the sole motivation, there&rsquo;d be somebody named Daniger or Wickham or Wojohowitz in the group.  Or is it that Mexicans are simply more selfish than Whites?  Either way, we don&rsquo;t need them.  </p>

			<p>As a former border patrol agent I swear:<br>
The situation at the border is not a jot better today as it was before 9/11. <br>
At the Southrn border we have a strong didvide along the racial line. They are white officers who do work following the protocol (which is less conserned with security, than a &#8220;Monopoly&#8221; manual). They, at least, are hard to bribe: about 4 to 6 per cent. On the other side are Latinos and blacks. ALL of the take the job from easy to very-very easy. 99.9 per cent of them accept &#8216;presents&rsquo;, at least 60 per cent take bribes and &#8216;co-operate&rsquo; with the country enemies.<br>

			<p>Mexicans are not our friends.  This propaganda that they are lovable, hardworking, misunderstood  people&hellip;.is all liberal nonsense.  Mexico is providing our prison population. In Los Angeles, Mayor Villagrossa just publicly announced that the Hispanic dropout rate in L.A is 60-65. In Las Vegas, it has been around 40%.  The dropout males join gangs or create gangs and sell drugs or break into homes of working citizens. The dropout females, make babies, and collect welfare. Their babies become dropouts, and continue the cycle.  So, crime escalates. Assaults increase, robberies increase, child molestations increase, car jackings, copper thefts, drive-by shootings increase. Drunken driving greatly increases (a major Hispanic/Mexican Indian problem) and the prisons and local jails fill up to maximum capacity.  All this pandering to Hispanics, should stop. Their goal is to over populate Americans in this country, then take whatever they want by outvoting Americans out of their Pensions and Social Security.  Taxing Retirees Savings and Retirement accounts, and redistributing the wealth, to feed and house more Hispanics. Businesses will be forced to hire a certain percentage of Hispanics, as they will be using the same &#8220;Diversity&#8221; card that uneducated, unqualified blacks have used for decades, to be hired over better qualified applicants.  Get used to it. It&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>

			<p>I use to wonder why George Bush put up with the kind of corruption represented by Mexicans, including those working as border agents.  But then it occured to me, he made his money on a corrupt sale of his failed oil business to the Arabs so he is apparently undaunted by corruption.</p>

			<p>Our leaders are clearly not trying to defend or protect America. Their actions clearly indicate otherwise.</p>
<p>Probably by weakening America, they will make a world government easier for people to swallow.</p>
<p>They we will all really be screwed. </p>

<p>Well said. Except it goes both ways. Quite often I am reminded by fellow Americans who know of my Cuban background that &#8220;Well, you&rsquo;re not really American&hellip;you&rsquo;re Hispanic.&#8221; Even though I was born here, am white of pure Spanish and French decent and have pledged allegiance to God and country as far back as I can remember. I know of Cuba what the news tells us and what my parents, who left at a fairly young age told us. I have no allegiance to that communist country or its people.</p>
<p>I am American.</p>

			<p>Washington does not have the revenue to fund the Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid programs for the tens of millions of boomers approaching retirement.  Since Washington does not legislate against employers paying illegals under the table and off the books our smiling members of congress have no intention of having these alien parasites fund these pay as you go Ponzie entitlement schemes for retiring boomers.  </p>
<p>What Washington does intend to do is what every communist government on earth has done and that is to empower the peasant-class (Hispanics) to destroy our white middle-class.  </p>
<p>They will fail miserably&hellip;  </p>

			<p>What makes me angry is that Federal jobs are difficult to obtain for a White male, U.S. citizen and they are usually well paid with plenty of benefits.</p>
<p>Then you have these clowns who chose to betray the country for profit.</p>

			<p>Oscar:  I agree completely with the laughable goals of the Hispanic invaders, but you are forgetting a few very important points:</p>
<p>Americas are sick to death of seeing Hispanics in every third or forth car driving next to them when we take to our roads and highways.  </p>
<p>Americas are sick to death of seeing Hispanics in our stores, parks, schools, hospitals, factories, restaurants and communities.  </p>
<p>Americas are sick to death of Spanish being spoken and displayed in public and the &#8220;Press 1 for English&#8221; is a source of escalating outrage. </p>
<p>This outrage, disgust and animosity Americans feel for Hispanics will absolutely positively lead to shooting war against these incompatible colonizing parasites.  There will probably not even be so much as a Mexican restaurant left standing by the time Americans have physically vented their wrath against these foreign interlopers and their seditious domestic panderers&hellip;    <br>

			<p>There was no salmonella on tomatoes. There was salmonella on basil, and it was all grown in Mexico. Of course! Where else would it have been grown? Mexico, home to every disease and pestilence known to mankind. It&rsquo;s sad how they kept good US (!) produce off the market for days or weeks due to this.</p>

<p>So, they not only let untreated and unsupervised vegetables to the USA, they also stole from the Mexican companies. An equal opportunity corruption.</p>
