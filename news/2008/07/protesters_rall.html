						<p>About a thousand protesters descended on a small town in northeastern Iowa on Sunday, decrying the raid of a meatpacking plant that arrested nearly 400 residents and calling for a change in federal immigration policies.</p>
<p>Postville, a town with about 2,200 residents, was pushed to the forefront of a national debate when federal immigration officials raided Agriprocessors &mdash; the nation&rsquo;s biggest kosher meatpacking plant &mdash; in May in the largest raid of its kind in the United States. Most of those arrested were Guatemalan and Mexican nationals who lived in the area.</p>
<p>Sunday&rsquo;s protesters &mdash; many arriving by bus from the Twin Cities and Chicago &mdash; circled the streets of Postville on a route about a mile long. Some clutched banners and signs such as one that read, &#8220;United for immigrant and worker rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rabbi Harold Kravitz of the Adath Jeshurun Congregation in Minnetonka, Minn., spoke when the rally paused near the driveway of Agriprocessors, on the outskirts of town.</p>
<p>Shouting into a portable microphone, he said the protesters wanted to stop the criminalization of people who come to the U.S. simply to make a living.</p>

			<p>They say they had 1,000 people show up, but I bet there were no more than 100.  Also note that these were libs who swooped in from Chicagograd and Minneapolisgrad.  I originally thought that the town&rsquo;s illegal aliens were making a fuss.</p>

			<p>I agree. They should not only be able to hire illegals they should be encouraged to hire them. IT WOULD KEEP THE MILES LOW ON THE &#8220;ICE&#8221; TRUCKS WHEN THEY PICK THEM UP.</p>

			<p>I almost feel sorry for them. Who knows though maybe their protest will change some immigration laws. </p>

			<p>Did I miss something in reading this&hellip;&hellip; are these people aware that it&rsquo;s the law. You can&rsquo;t be here illegally. No other country on earth outside of dying european democracies allows such entry. I have a friend who brought his family here from Greece. They are originally from Albania. They told me stories of how bad it is in Greece to be a legal alien. Those caught coming in illegally are usually beaten and often killed by police and it&rsquo;s applauded by the locals. America is losing it&rsquo;s Americaness the same way Rome lost it&rsquo;s Romaness.</p>

			<p>Everytime they&rsquo;ve tried to intimidate people with their grusome protests the scheme backfires on them and more animosity from the general population is directed at them.</p>
<p>Obviously they aren&rsquo;t able to learn very well.</p>

			<p>The whole world would come to America &#8220;simply to make a living&#8221; if they could and the seditious globalists would welcome them all.  Businessmen love labor surpluses and an endless escalating flood of imported unsophisticated third-world consumers to buy their products.</p>
<p>&#8220;Merchants have no country. The mere spot they stand on does not constitute so strong an attachment as that from which they draw their gains.&#8221;<br>

			<p>   Working conditions and wages were steadily improving in the meat packing industry during the 1980s and early 1990s, then the greedy meat packing industries decided to hire illegal aliens and return the industry to the conditions of 1900!  Safety and sanitary conditions have deteriorated to the extent that packers can now use radiation to kill germs!  How much progress have we made since the publication of Sinclair Lewis&rsquo;s The Jungle? This industry is badly in need of a cleanup  &mdash;  enforce the laws you corrupt political creeps.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t say back in the day everybody that came to a America had a dream to become part of the total landscape and did so legally with inspection at Ellis Island. Today people violate the law by jumping the border to come and make a living because they can&hellip;..with their comrades claiming that they have the right. Birds of a feather flock together. </p>
<p>How things have changed in the land where the rule of law is supreme&hellip;.it makes me wanna holler!<br>

<p>People have to go through the immigration process. There are laws regarding this in EVERY nation on earth. Nobody has the right to go to another country illegally and flout their laws to suit them. Go home. March in the streets of Mexico and Guatamala, both rich in natural resources and throw out your corrupt leaders. </p>
