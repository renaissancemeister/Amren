						<p>Be careful if you have saggy pants in the south Chicago suburb of Lynwood. Village leaders have passed an ordinance that would levy $25 fines against anyone showing three inches or more of their underwear in public.</p>
<p>Eugene Williams is the mayor of Lynwood. He says young men walk around town half-dressed, keeping major retailers and economic development away. {snip}</p>
<p>The American Civil Liberties Union says the ordinance targets young men of color.</p>

			<p>In this case, the constitutional concerns have been allayed, because it defines exactly how much underwear one has to show before one is violating the ordinance.</p>
<p>It might be futile, but in good faith.</p>
<p>Another scenario:  You&rsquo;re showing 3.1 inches of underwear.  A Lynwood cop spots you, tells you to stop, gets out his ruler.  Before he gets to you, you pull your pants up.  He arrests you for obstruction of justice.  How does the prosecution prove that you did obstruct justice?  Unless there&rsquo;s a spy camera around, it&rsquo;s the sagger&rsquo;s word against the cop&rsquo;s.  However, the judicial system isn&rsquo;t going to waist their time to squabble over a tenth of an inch of underwear.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Down-Low&#8221; pants (known in PC language as &#8220;saggy pants&#8221;)started in prisons where blacks showed their gang colors. Out of prison, &#8220;down low&#8221; pants have taken on a homosexual meaning. It&rsquo;s advertizing. <br/>
Stooping to the down low<br/>
http://www.gbmnews.com/articles/1822/1/Stooping-to-the-down-low/Page1.html<br/>
Rap Song for campaign against sagging pants tells young men their exposed underwear means they&rsquo;re closeted homosexuals.<br/>
Rapper Dooney Da&rsquo; Priest&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pull Your Pants Up&rdquo; has become the signature song for Dallas Deputy Mayor Pro Tem Dwaine Caraway&rsquo;s push to eradicate sagging pants and exposed underwear, particularly among black youths. Caraway has unsuccessfully tried to get the City Council to pass an anti-sagging ordinance, but earlier this week the first of more than two dozen billboards urging people to &ldquo;pull &lsquo;em up&rdquo; was unveiled. </p>
<p>In a reference to what he says is the origin of saggy pants, Da&rsquo; Priest appears to try to scare young men into pulling up their pants up by suggesting that if they don&rsquo;t, it means they&rsquo;re closeted homosexuals. </p>
<p>&ldquo;You walk the streets with your pants way down low/I don&rsquo;t know/Looks to me like you&rsquo;re on the down low,&rdquo; Da&rsquo; Priest raps.</p>
<p>In the black community, &ldquo;on the down low&rdquo; is used to describe men who have sex with men but identify publicly as heterosexual. <br/>
 Da&rsquo; Priest claimed saggy pants originated in prison with inmates who wanted to signal that they&rsquo;re available for sex. According to most sources, however, the phenomenon likely has more to do with mis-sized clothing and prohibitions against belts in prison. </p>
<p>In any case, Da&rsquo; Priest told the Voice he did not intend the lyrics as an attack against the gay community but merely wanted to educate people. </p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it actually means behind bars, and what I&rsquo;m trying to do is let young people know,&rdquo; Da&rsquo; Priest said. &ldquo;If they want to make themselves available to another man, I have no problem with that.&rdquo; <br/>
 <br/>
WIKI: &#8220;On the Down Low&#8221;<br/>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_on_the_DL" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_on_the_DL</a><br/>
In same-sex sexual contexts, Down-low refers to men who have sex with men (MSM) but are either closeted or do not identify as gay. The term is most often associated with and has its origins in African American culture in the United States but it is not exclusive to that group.<br/>
This usage emerged during the 1990s in inner-cities across the United States, and early in the 2000s when a series of mainstream media reports emerged, some equating the phenomenon with men who have sex with both men and women, and some tying the behaviour to the ongoing AIDS pandemic.</p>

			<p>The sad part is that the ACLU would only object to the law because it &#8220;targets young men of color&#8221;.  The fact that government has no business micromanaging our lives should be their primary concern.</p>

			<p>On the positive side - I used to see this foolishness in young white males as well several years ago&hellip;but haven&rsquo;t witnessed it since. Whether the fad just passed in this area, or perhaps they actually did realize how completely asinine they looked is anyone&rsquo;s guess. Blacks however latch onto these &#8220;cultural&#8221; quirks and cling to them forever&hellip;after all, it&rsquo;s really all they have which is undeniably sad.    </p>

			<p>I was actually in prison, and it was the black gays who were selling it, or just wanted a new boyfriend, who &#8220;dragged a sag&#8221; in their trousers.</p>
<p>I knew two of the gay whites.  They were OK, but they acted like they were badly married.  One of them used to give me and my own friends his once-read books, so I taught my best friend there to read on swords &amp; sorcery novels.  &#8220;The Wizard&rsquo;s First Rule&#8221; was my bunkie&rsquo;s first full-length novel.  His mother got him a subscription to &#8220;Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology&#8221;, mainly for me.  I used to read to him, and tell him what the technological terms meant.</p>
<p>They wore their trousers properly there.</p>

			<p>Sorry. <br/>
But this one is wrong. I feel that I am as conservative as anyone who views this site. I visit it every day and have learned much from it. I also believe in our Constitution and what it stands for. It doesn&rsquo;t stand for government dictating how we wear our clothes if it is offensive to someone else. <br/>
Look away. <br/>
If this kid was a 23 year old swim-suit model, no one would care if her low-cut jeans revealed her thong. I would encourage it. So these kids look like complete idiots. Look at who they are! <br/>
Government intrusion into our lives has come along way too far and this is simply another example of it. We complain because we don&rsquo;t want to be told to wear seatbelts, helmets or how to raise our kids. We shouldn&rsquo;t accept and endorse legislation banning other types of intrusion simply because it is targeted at the fashion sense of hyper-idiot child men.<br/>
I can&rsquo;t stand these dolts either, what they stand for or what they represent to our society. Making them pull up their pants, however, does not adequately address the issues with them that truly must be addressed.<br/>

			<p>It&rsquo;s a nice thought but it won&rsquo;t work. It will just turn into another drain on the already overloaded court system when they don&rsquo;t pay the fines and somebody has to try to hunt them down and serve them with papers for non-appearance and so forth.</p>

			<p>Maybe if the girls and young women would laugh and point at the offenders, they&rsquo;d get the idea. This &#8220;fashion statement&#8221; is as indigenous to the black community as the &#8220;pedal pusher&#8221; pants and thick soled gym shoes seem to be with the &#8220;Latino&#8221; community. They all look ridiculous, but it isn&rsquo;t a crime yet.</p>

<p>This happens all the time, a policemans word against an offender. They take the policeman&rsquo;s word. I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m going to say this&hellip; but they take the word of the police more than they should. Ok, maybe that was a dumb thing to say.  </p>

			<p>What amazes me is that black behavior of this sort is ON DISPLAY for all to see (along with RAP, Hip-hop), and yet the notion that this shows how moronic the black community is seems to be lost on many whites. Black behavior is right out in the open people, figure it out!!</p>

			<p>They should just let it be. If black guys want to walk around looking like total idiots (all the while thinking they look &#8220;cool&#8221;) I say fine. Who cares? It&rsquo;s not like these losers are ever going to amount to anything. I think its just that the comparatively few blacks who do have something on the ball, who do have something going for them, are embarrassed for their race. They have the capacity to REALIZE what these idiots don&rsquo;t - you look ridiculous. </p>

I have no idea about the origin of this bizarre custom. Nor any prison experience.  But as a gay person, I have to say that I very much doubt the gay implications that some people gtry to impute to it.   That makes absolutely no sense to me.</p>
<p>These people, to my eye, are not gay, are not attractive to gays, and I imagine they hardly know what &#8220;gay&#8221; is. They are dumb, straight ghetto thugs, that&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>I do, however, think that the second explanation given above is far more likely to be true.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;&rsquo;Down-Low&rsquo; pants (known in PC language as &ldquo;saggy pants&rdquo;)started in prisons where blacks showed their gang colors&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the gang detail of the police department  &mdash;  who visit my school occasionally to give talks about the &#8216;action in the hood&rsquo; the saggy pants started when belts were taken away from prisoners because they could be used as weapons or to commit suicide (and thus the families could accuse the prison guards of staging a murder to appear to be suicide).</p>
<p>Later, when the thug is released back into his hell-hole community, the saggy pants become a sign that one had been to &#8216;Centurion School&rsquo; i.e. prison  &mdash;  a sign of noble achievement and point of pride in certain black communities. Remember:  Immediate street cred is a way to achieve status in these communities  &mdash;  grillz, rimz, loud thumping music with sexually explicit lyrics, saggy pants, all of it fits together, as degenerate as it may be.</p>
<p>The cops say: &#8220;The lower the pants the tougher the kid!&#8221; </p>
<p>(or so they believe)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this sick trend hasn&rsquo;t blown over in the 25+ years since it&rsquo;s started and the schools are having a terrible time dealing with it  &mdash;  not to mention that the rap artists and other heroes in the black ghetto community have added this  style of dress to their &#8216;acts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Gots to keep it real.</p>

			<p>&#8220;In a reference to what he says is the origin of saggy pants, Da&rsquo; Priest appears to try to scare young men into pulling up their pants up by suggesting that if they don&rsquo;t, it means they&rsquo;re closeted homosexuals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh really?  I would be extremely leery about believing ANYTHING coming from a black preacher or a black rapper.</p>
<p>But accusing them of being gay is one way of scaring them into pulling their pants back on.  The very fact that this is used to scare them is proof that they are not gay.  (Jus keepin it real.)</p>

			<p>Only today, I saw 2 young blacks going across the middle of a busy blvd (jaywalking of course) they both were wearing saggy baggy pants, with white tanks. One had his slung so low the waistband was falling underneath the entire buttocks area, covered by nothing but red boxers, The other one had them hanging halfway off his butt. They forced them both to waddle and move so slowly, I was amazed they had the guts to cross the street while dressed that way. If they had neeeded to run quickly, there is no way they could have, without falling flat on their faces.</p>

			<p>Thanks for the laugh, Jimmy Stubble!!  :)</p>
<p>I see nothing wrong with this new ordinance.  The city leaders are sick of this behavior and want to put a stop to it.  What else can they do??  As far as &#8220;pointing and laughing&#8221; as suggested by one commenter, I say let&rsquo;s see YOU point and laugh, and we&rsquo;ll see what happens&hellip;</p>
