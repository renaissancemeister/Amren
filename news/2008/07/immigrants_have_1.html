						<p>The character of England&rsquo;s countryside has changed fundamentally over the past decade following an influx of immigrants which have helped rapidly push up house prices and demand for new developments, an official report has revealed.</p>
<p>Since 2002, the number of immigrants has almost tripled in rural areas &mdash; compared to a lower rise of 86 per cent in the country&rsquo;s towns and cities.</p>
<p>The average home in the countryside now costs £257,600 &mdash; 6.8 times as much as the typical income &mdash; compared to £212,823 in urban areas. The number of second homes has doubled to about 94,000 since 2000.</p>
<p>The report from the Commission for Rural Communities (CRC) which has analysed the &#8220;state of the countryside&#8221; over the past decade warns that the character of &#8220;large parts of England&rsquo;s countryside is changing&#8221;.</p>
<p>It found that sharp rises in immigration and property prices have coincided with a decline in access to services for rural residents.</p>
<p>Another report published by a Parliamentary Committee, warns that many services are now &#8220;inadequately funded&#8221; in areas facing increases in population following immigration.</p>
<p>Dr Stuart Burgess, the Chairman of the CRC, said: &#8220;The character of large parts of England&rsquo;s countryside is changing as a result of built development; demand for new development is significantly higher per household in rural areas than urban areas and the countryside has seen a greater number of new houses than in the urban fringe in recent years.</p>
<p>&#8220;The decline in services in rural areas continues to concern rural communities. Each year we have found there are fewer outlets for many services and poorer accessibility to services for people without cars.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, the Commission concludes that the quality of life for people living in the countryside is still higher than for their urban counterparts with residents enjoying healthier lifestyles and lower rates of crime. Educational attainment is also higher among children living in rural areas.</p>
<p>Almost one in five English residents now live in rural communities &mdash; 9.6 million people. Most households are families with young children or pensioners.</p>
<p>However, the rural population continues to rise at a faster rate than in the country as a whole partly because of a &#8220;dramatic increase&#8221; in immigrants, particularly from eastern Europe. Although there are more immigrants living in urban areas the rate of increase is far higher in the countryside.</p>
<p>Rural areas which now have the highest proportions of immigrants include Lincolnshire and the Isles of Scilly.</p>
<p>A separate report published by the Parliamentary Committee for Communities and Local Government, criticises the Government for failing to properly prepare local communities for the impact of higher immigration. It also draws attention to the issue in rural areas.</p>
<p>Dr Phyllis Starkey, the chair of the Committee, said: &#8220;We found that public concerns about the effects of migration are not necessarily based on prejudice, but can arise from genuine anxieties about practical issues, such as the effect of migration on housing and other local services.</p>
<p>&#8220;Local services are unable to respond to rapid population changes and are left under-funded as a result of the current funding system. This situation is putting local public services under pressure.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Committee believes that Government plans for immigrants to pay a new levy to help fund public services are inadequate. It calls on ministers to set up a contingency fund to provide additional funding to certain areas.</p>
<p>A government report on improving affordable housing in rural areas is expected to be released within the next few days. The study, conducted by Liberal Democrat MP Matthew Taylor, is set to call for more new housing earmarked for local residents. Today&rsquo;s Rural Commission report calls the issue the &#8220;dominant challenge&#8221; facing rural areas.</p>
<p>However, plans for new &#8220;eco-towns&#8221; &mdash; many of which are located in rural areas &mdash; have met intense local opposition.</p>
<p>Tom Oliver, the head of rural policy at the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said: &#8220;The scale of the pressures on the countryside, from large scale housing schemes and other intrusive development, are making rural England a place which needs more careful protection than ever before.&#8221;<br>

<p>It makes sense that Eastern Europeans would prefer the English countryside. It is calmer, more conducive to raising a family and free of the black gangs that plague London and other cities. </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve never exactly been to Canada, except for the Canadian side of Niagara Falls which I&rsquo;m not sure really counts, but I remember as a kid hearing stories from people who had been to Toronto or Montreal. They would always say, &#8216;it&rsquo;s so clean in Canada&rsquo;. This was around 30 years ago. It never occurred to me until very recently when I happened to think about it that there might have been a racial component to that. It probably wasn&rsquo;t meant to be racial really. I do suppose if someone said that today, it would be considered a racial comment. In truth, I bet people don&rsquo;t say that about Canada much anymore. That&rsquo;s not meant to be a racial comment as much as a factual comment.  <br>

			<p>London  and/or the Country is  a  place I`ve never been. But recently I watched both You Tube footage of the Beatles` roof top concert and the feature length movie,&#8221;Mrs Brown You`ve Got A Lovely Daughter.&#8221;  Both made me extremely nostalgic for how it must have been. Not only over there but over here too, if you can guess my meaning. Bobbies, Middle aged war veterans etc&hellip; <br>
 Two interesting things about The Herman`s Hermits movie. The first is that the girl was a real stunner. Think Carnaby Street Helen of Troy! Even my girlfriend was saying how she was the quintessential English &#8220;bird&#8221;. A perfect picture of her times. The second caught me by surprise. I was just thinking how &#8220;White&#8221; the movie AND London looked, when they showed a 3 second cutaway to a Carribean Black couple. It must have been one of the very first Edit- ins of minorites in English cinema. Find the movie and see if you can spot it. </p>

			<p>where are the leftist environmentalists? Why as is england - a densely populated country that went out of its way to create greenbelts - letting hundreds of thousands of immigrants in? </p>
<p>I know i am preaching to the choir here but is it conspiracy, incompetence, maliciousness?? or just being blinded by idealogy.</p>
<p>I always hear how countries need more immigrants. Common sense tells us increasing the population is not a sustainable way to live&hellip;but it seems the only &#8216;formula&rsquo; for keeping socilist capitalism going.</p>

			<p>I live in England and I don&rsquo;t know what the author is talking about.  Probably designed to get money for some never ending expansion of government into the lives of citizens.  London is the problem.  Like cockroaches, low value immigrants prefer urban areas.</p>

 My friends in and from England, say that the percieved &#8220;eastern european&#8221; immigrants are in  fact, mostly Pakistanis and Indians or others from those areas who just happened to come THROUGH! eastern europe and are mostly Muslims and are making their usual demands and wanting to build a Mosque before they are moved in. This is, as usual, accompanied by the Muslims usual disdain for the English culture or laws. Most are trying (with no buyers) to sell their homes and get out while they can.</p>

			<p>Same thing is happening in Canada.  After years of reckless immigration, developers in the immigrant-destination cities have grown accustomed to building new sub-divisions every year.  </p>
<p>Now, the sattelite towns are resisting encroachment, and the developers are crying foul.</p>

			<p>My eyesight must be the cause, but I just couldn&rsquo;t find any reference in that article about the CRIME by that flood of immigrants. So I&rsquo;m confident all the crime in Britain is the work of disaffected Whites protesting over British immigration policy, right? Those stabbings, for example. Has there been a huge increase in sales of theatrical (dark skin tone) make-up?</p>
<p>Why does &#8220;such as the effect of migration on housing and other local services&#8221; sound suspiciously like a disguised comment on immigrants&rsquo; voracious appetite for hand-outs and public assistance. As well as for the social problems their third-world life style creates.</p>

			<p>If prices are going up, then somebody is making money from this immigration so it&rsquo;s fine with them. Just as in every white country, wealthy caucasions are enabling this influx because they benefit financially. Simple as that. Money rules. End of story. </p>
<p>Too bad for the pretty countryside. And the white people who live there.<br>

			<p>  Greedy real estate developers love to flood the country with immigrants. They make plenty of money that way. The people who live with the increased diversity pay the price in increased prices, crowding, noise, polution, crime, etc. </p>

			<p>For a true image of a happy and harmonious England before the rot set in try and get hold of Henry Vollom Morton&rsquo;s books, In Search of England is one of the best. Also The Soul of Scotland and many others. Be warned, you&rsquo;ll be both angered and saddened at the betrayal of this country.<br>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t know. Its amazing when you think about it. Britain was not invaded one single time between 1066 and 1948. That is 882 years free from foreign invasion. What other European country could dream of saying that? Between 1670 and 1813 France invaded German-speaking lands no fewer then FOURTEEN times, on average once every ten years. Or consider how the Germans had to endure the horrors of the thirty-years war. Britain also built an empire on which the sun never set. And now today Britain is being overwhelmed by an immivasion. Unreal. Britain is a textbook case in how nations choose to commit suicide.</p>

			<p>This report is a bit of a mish-mash. Except in certain areas the chief impact of immigration on the countryside has been indirect - third world immigration into the cities forces white flight into the countryside which stimulates the demand for new housing. At the same time the existing rural population (the last remnant of the aboriginal Anglo-Saxons) find themselves priced out, a process compounded by the sale under Mrs. Thatcher of the public housing in which most of the real villagers lived.</p>
<p>The &#8220;certain areas&#8221; referred to above are those which major in the production of fruit and vegetables - the cultivation, harvesting and packing of which is labour intensive. The availability of eastern European labour has enabled farmers to expand such activities, but it has resulted in some displacement of local labour. (The problem with local labour is that it is more expensive because migrants do not have rent or mortgages to pay).</p>
<p>It is likely that eastern European migration will eventually settle down into a similar pattern to that from the rest of the EU - i.e. young people come for a few months or years to see the sights and earn some money and then go home; most of those who stay for good do so because they have married locally (already a noticeable trend with eastern Europeans who are often very good looking as well as very white!).</p>
<p>There is, though, one quite new and unwelcome tendency which doesn&rsquo;t fit into the above, i.e. the permanent settlement in many small towns of sizable communities of &#8220;Portuguese&#8221;. These people, although they hold Portuguese passports and are therefore EU citizens able to come and go as they please, are often in fact Brazilians or from Portugal&rsquo;s former colonies in Africa. They work in meat packing plants.</p>
<p>When all is said and done, though, the English countryside is still beautiful, still white and still very English (that tripling in the number of immigrants is from a very low base) So come and see it while you can!</p>
