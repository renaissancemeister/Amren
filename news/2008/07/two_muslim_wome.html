						<p>Two Muslim women say that a McDonald&rsquo;s restaurant refused to hire them, and insulted them during job interviews because they wear traditional Islamic dress.</p>
<p>Toi Whitfield, 20, of Detroit and Quiana Pugh, 25, of Dearborn sued McDonald&rsquo;s, the owner of the local franchise and its unidentified manager in Wayne County Circuit Court on Thursday. Their representative said they are considering filing civil rights complaints with the federal and state governments.</p>
<p>&#8220;I applied for the McDonald&rsquo;s position maybe two weeks ago and he simply (told me) I had to make a choice and remove my hijab, or I would not be able to establish employment there,&#8221; Pugh said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The women are seeking $10 million in a suit.<br/>

			<p>I say: let them wear the headscarf, along with a hairnet too   &mdash;   that means there is less chance of them getting hair in to other people&rsquo;s food.</p>

			<p>I have seen the pictures of these two &#8220;Muslim&#8221; women.  They are nothing more than ghetto blacks. I say hire them and let them wear whatever they want.  Do not settle the lawsuit.  I bet they would be most dissapointed in acutally having to work there as opposed to feeling &#8220;hurt and disturbed&#8221; with their huge settlement.</p>

			<p>If I, as a man, applied for a job at McDonald&rsquo;s, or any other organization for that matter, while wearing a dress and nylons, I&rsquo;m sure I would have been told to dress more appropriately if I wanted the job. Or they might not have even considered hiring me at all! I have no desire to wear women&rsquo;s clothing, but if I did, could I justifiably complain that I was being discriminated against? Nope! That&rsquo;s cause there are all sorts of unwritten codes that we in society must abide by. Muslims would like to usurp our cultural codes of conduct with ones specific to Islamic societies. I say, &#8220;No way!&#8221; When in Rome, do as the Romans do, and I&rsquo;m not saying &#8220;please&#8221; - rather, I would like to insist on it.</p>

			<p>This, like other similar lawsuits, is a setup. They are planned and carefully executed. They target various businesses. Sometimes the applicant is hired, and they do nothing. Sometimes the applicant is not hired, and they clap their hands for joy because they now have someone to sue.<br/>
Much like the &#8220;discrimination&#8221; lawsuits that have plagued employers for years.<br/>

			<p>Why would muslims even bother seeking employment where they require special uniforms and serve pork? Oh. Dearbornistan. Never-mind.</p>
<p>If Mcdonald&rsquo;s is forced to hire them, the next demand would be for foot-baths. Then the demand that muslim employees be exempt from working during the breakfast, lunch and dinner rush while they stop to pray. While the rest of the dhimmi employees are forced to step over them and carry the extra workload.  </p>
<p>McDonald&rsquo;s can afford some pretty good attorneys. They should counter-sue these two losers. The positive publicity wouldn&rsquo;t hurt their sales, or their image, one bit.  </p>

			<p>These two are black ghetto women who are members of the Black Muslim cult.  And Detroit is ground zero for the lawsuit lottery among blacks so this is no surprise in any way, shape or form. These sistas are about to &#8220;get paid&#8221; - big time.</p>
<p>In Detroit and surrounding areas, you hire blacks at your own risk.  Employers know that they better have their liability insurance fat and paid up in full when taking on a black employee.</p>

			<p>Well if it keeps hair out of the food, it might actually be a good thing. They&rsquo;re suing for $10 million. HA, 10,000,000 divided by 7 (per hour) = 1,428,571 (hours) divided by 40 =35,714 (40 hour work weeks) divided by 52 = 687 (years) <br/>
They&rsquo;re suing for 687 years worth of work at McDonalds, the sad thing is they&rsquo;ll probably get it.</p>

			<p>McDonalds is already in trouble for its not just acceptance but implied promotion of the gay agenda. It will be interesting to see how all this plays out. Of course our so-called courts rule against traditional America all the time anyway, so these women who stay with a religion that demeans them may get a big payday. McDonalds probably knows women in this strange dress would drive customers away. It would me, but I never eat at fast food joints anymore anyway. With all the illegas and what not these places hire God knows how the food is prepared. </p>

			<p>Whitfield and Pugh must have heard about the hijab-wearing  Muslim woman in the UK who sued the owner of a hair salon who wouldn&rsquo;t hire her. </p>
<p>Heaven forbid if McDonald&rsquo;s would have hired them for the breakfast shift where they might have had to heat pork products for the Egg McMuffins.  </p>
<p>Suing is just SO much easier than working.</p>

			<p>Why would muslims want to work for a capitalistic conglomerate that promotes the values of the &#8220;great satan&#8221; and serves pork? What if they are hired, will the McDonald&rsquo;s not be allowed to serve sausage McMuffins or bacon double cheeseburgers? Maybe they would file a lawsuit stating they were made to touch pork. <br/>

			<p>This is another con job like the one against the hairdresser in London.  Hijabs are unsanitary and hide the true hygeine of these people, which is very nasty. Westerners like to see a face, for communications and identification purposes. This is one time that I am for McDonald&rsquo;s if it pursues its court case rather than back down to political correctness.</p>

			<p>This is definately a shakeup plan. I am a former Muslim who was often sent on assignments to different places advertising as &#8220;help wanted&#8221;. If I or another hijab wearer were turned away by saying that they were &#8220;just taking applications&#8221;, told to remove headscarves or just ignored the place of business would be threatened with a lawsuit. Most of the time they would knuckle under, especially if they were a small business who could not afford to lose money. None of us were ever hired though. I am embarassed to even say that I participated in such an operation but it did happen. I think I was chosen because I am a White person of American heritage, in other words, they could not say I was not hired or interviewed because I was black or some other ethnicity. </p>

			<p>Yawn.  Best punishment for them:  Hire them and allow them to wear the uniform UNDER the hijab.  Then work &#8216;em like dogs. (Heh.)  Back there by the ovens and fryers, it&rsquo;ll be hot as Hades.</p>
<p>But, of course, OSHA wouldn&rsquo;t allow that.  It wouldn&rsquo;t be safe.  Their flowing robes could catch fire.  Sigh.</p>
<p>Judges should be forced to throw these cases OUT.  No more settling out of court.  All settling does is encourage this stuff. It&rsquo;s time for corporate lawyers to start suing these &#8220;plaintiffs&#8221; for harassment and damages.  If a person can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t follow clearly stated corporate rules, they have to go somewhere else.  Better yet, they can get an advantaged-person business loan and create their own Hijab Hamburger Heaven right there in the middle of Detroit.  Or Dearborn.  Whatever.</p>

			<p>Doesn&rsquo;t McDonald&rsquo;s have a sort of uniform that their employees wear?    What about other organizations such as this?  Are employees now to demand the right to replace the employer&rsquo;s uniforms and to wear their OWN uniforms?  </p>
<p>What if they wanted to be a nurse or a cop?  Or a bus driver or a meter reader? Would they have the right to forgo the traditional uniform and  instead wear their religious garb?  Where is all this madness taking us?</p>
<p>And all, I might add, in the name of Holy Diversity.</p>

			<p>When I was seventeen, McDonalds told me I&rsquo;d have to cut my hair (which was barely shoulder length), to keep my new job there. After about my third day, I decided that I&rsquo;d rather keep my hair, and they could keep their lousy job. It was MY choice. <br/>
 I did not sue anybody. I went on to better things.</p>
<p>You see, I wasn&rsquo;t a walking parade of personality disorders and naive, arrogant delusion, like these muslim women are.</p>
<p>These people have no integrity, honesty, virtue, or guts. Why are they here, in our land????????????????????????????? </p>

			<p>Hey, you wanna bet that soon, there will be NO PORK products at McDonalds, anyway? <br/>
I bet that this will ripple across the entire fast food industry within the next five years. They will say it&rsquo;s about health reasons at first, then they&rsquo;ll begin to admit it&rsquo;s about &#8220;cultural consiousness and respect for their diverse clientelle,&#8221; but by then the whole game will be up, because long about that time, Americans will have no more energy to resist Sharia law, than do Britons today.<br/>
On the lighter side, it will be funny to see Mestizos, Blacks, and ultra-racist Arabs fighting it out daily, the pork axis, against the non-pork front!</p>

I had to have an emergency c-section.  I was rushed to a large teaching hospital.  The Dr. that did the surgery did not introduce themselves to me before the operation.  When I looked up, I was extremely horrified to see the Dr. getting ready to cut into me wearing a headscarf.  I began crying uncontrollably and praying out loud.</p>

			<p>Huh?  I have been told by employers that I pretty much HAD to wear make-up and jewelry.  How&rsquo;s that for discrimination? I have never once in my entire life had a job where there was not some sort of set way to dress.  </p>
<p>My guess is that Mcd&rsquo;s does not allow hats, scarves, or any head covering other that a hairnet of a barrette.  It&rsquo;s just standard.   </p>
<p>One good thing about these lawsuits:  the more people sue for millions of dollars over stuff like this, the less inclined I am to believe that there is any actual discrimination going on at all.    </p>

			<p>&#8220;I never eat at fast food joints anymore anyway. With all the illegas and what not these places hire God knows how the food is prepared.&#8221; <br/>

<p>You&rsquo;d rather go to a fancy French restaurant?  Who do you think is peeling your vegatables there?  Same deal.<br/>

			<p>McDonald&rsquo;s is a huge world-wide corporation. They even have branches in China and Russia!   I wonder if they have any branches in Moslem countries?  Probably so.  In which case, I have to ask what they require their employees wear in those places?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m an Asian guy, I live in Indonesia which majority of people are moslems but I&rsquo;m not a moslem. <br/>
There ARE McDonald outlets here and there ARE girls wearing hijab working at McDonald outlets here. But the government here allowed the people freedom to hire whoever/whatever they like. You only want to hire pretty slender young females, go ahead, no one will and no one can sue you. <br/>
Here, even if the girls working at McDonald are wearing hijab, they are usually slender and have quite a pleasant face to look at. On the contrary, even if a girl do not wear hijab but is fat and ugly then you can bet your bottom dollar that no Indonesian male manager in his right mind will want to hire her.  </p>

			<p>This is surprising given their multicult advertising, their little ethnic jingles and their recent support of the homosexual agenda.  You might think your getting a taste of Americana but all they&rsquo;re serving up is globalism.  Dispense with the pretense of flying American flags at your chains and instead use one of a clawed demonic hand holding the world in it&rsquo;s grasp.  Keep up the boycott.  I pass by one of these every morning on the way to work and I&rsquo;ve noticed an appreciable decline in business.  </p>

<p>There are McDonalds in Kuwait but Muslim Arabs don&rsquo;t work in them, they own them and hire Indians and Philippinos to work in them. A poster above is also correct in that if a girl is working in an establishment and wearing the Hijab, she is going to be well built and have beautiful eyes and be clean!</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t think this case will win.  The right of certain businesses to demand employees wear uniforms is well-established in the US.  Be that as it may, McDonald&rsquo;s is not exactly a sympathetic victim here, given their unthinking support of every left-wing cause that comes down the pike, from gun control to militant homosexuality.  The last time I was in Boulder, I was delighted to see that the store on Table Mesa Drive, in the extreme south end of town had closed and the building was standing empty.</p>
