<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>For the last decade, NASCAR has tried to shed its legacy as a sport indelibly linked to the confederate flag. Motorsports execs understand that if their sport is ever to go global, burning rubber can&rsquo;t be associated with burning crosses. However, despite NASCAR&rsquo;s efforts to improve their image, it&rsquo;s still a sport where racism thrives below the surface and sexism in the form of bikini-clad NASCAR eye candy is proudly paraded around the speedway, as much a part of the scenery as the stars and bars. NASCAR is in danger of being marginalized by this contradiction. They&rsquo;re attempting to reach an international audience while displaying the worst kind of backward provincialism.</p>
<p>{snip} In 2005, [Mauricia] Grant became the first black, female inspection official in the sport&rsquo;s history. Two years later she was fired. Now Grant has filed a $225 million harassment lawsuit against NASCAR alleging &#8220;racial and sexual discrimination, sexual harassment and wrongful termination.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The lawsuit details twenty-three specific incidents of sexual harassment and thirty-four specific incidents of alleged racial and gender discrimination over a two-year span. It is a fairly mindnumbing recitation of similar stories that go well beyond anyone&rsquo;s notion of political correctness.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mike Wilford,  who is named in the suit and has since left NASCAR, told The Associated Press that Grant was in on the offensive &#8220;jokes&#8221; the whole time. &#8220;Graphic and lewd jokes? She participated in them. She laughed, she would never say it was inappropriate,&#8221; Wilford claims. &#8220;She asked to be called the only two names she was ever called. She called herself Mo Money all the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Grant has said, &#8220;We have to work together to change the racist culture. Anyone that has an interest in motorsports, they should be allowed to work in that environment without having to deal with racism or sexism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grant&rsquo;s love of motorsports is so intense, so pure, that she can separate the beauty of the sport from the ugly underbelly desperately clinging to its wheels. Perhaps she could even inspire NASCAR fans to get up and demonstrate &mdash; whether it be at Daytona or Talladega &mdash; to show that intolerance and gender inequality are not the cornerstones of the sport they love.<br>

			<p>The white male bastion will be brought down by the media&rsquo;s desire for diversity. The mere fact that NASCAR has become a unifying force for white males has made it a target for the liberal and left wing press. If this was a gathering of Muslim extremist the media would print glowing admiration for their<br>
cohesiveness. </p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t think blacks and liberals will ever be happy until they have destroyed every last bit of White culture that exists. </p>
<p>NASCAR is not   &mdash;   and never was   &mdash;   meant for blacks! It was a sport for rural Whites, mainly men. </p>
<p>How many White sports players are subjected to racial slurs from blacks while on the field or in the locker room? Plenty! </p>
<p>Blacks will never be happy until they see a NASCAR event with blaring rap music, Hennessey Ads and Puff Daddy and his &#8220;ho&rsquo;s&#8221; out on the raceway. </p>
<p>Blacks are parasitical in that they seek to destroy everything that they can&rsquo;t control or can&rsquo;t create themselves. </p>

			<p>the comments to this article that are linked to the original Nation article (NOT the AMREN comments)are grim reminders for me of the narrow minded bigotry that one encounters when a &#8216;progressive&rsquo; (formerly known as &#8216;liberal&rsquo;) gives you their take on life.My ex-wife was a bleeding heart liberal attorney that could never find it in herself to be critical of any black, yet dished out the term &#8216;redneck&rsquo; often toward people she knew absolutely nothing about.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t really care much for NASCAR, but I find it interesting that sports that aren&rsquo;t totally dominated by blacks at every level must demonstrate that they aren&rsquo;t &#8220;racist.&#8221;  Sports and anything else for that matter that are inherently white don&rsquo;t sit well with leftists and must be inspected with a fine tooth comb for any signs of racism.  To include the fraudulent lawsuit brought by a racism hustler as proof of the racism only further erodes the credibility of the article.</p>

			<p>Why must NASCAR obsess itself with &#8220;internationizing&#8221; itself? Is there an analogous story to this one in the Le Mans or Gran Prix world? The answer to that question, unfortunately, lies in the same place that the answer to the question regarding Lowes Home Improvements Warehouse, Inc.&rsquo;s obsession with diversity and bilingual store signage. Pure, unadulterated seven plus zeros GREED. And that answer invariably leads to self-destruction.</p>

<p>Going global is nonsense.  The sport makes billions right now.  It is the same kind of greedy elites who want to expand that moved the cororations overseas and act now as traitors to their own people.</p>
<p>Nascar fans should oust every fat, pompous ass that is in charge of the sport and get new ones in who have not subcumbed to a criminal desire to enrich themselves further.</p>

			<p>If not for the older generations who flew that flag, Nascar would not exist. This makes me mad look back at history and you seen all the good Nascar drivers useing the Confederate flag. Now Nascar wants to ban a cultural symbol that built their money makeing machine. That is beyond treason to the South and its hsitory, the very redneck type who has always paid to view the Souths biggest sport. Now the infected disease of PC is creeping into money hungry fat wallets. The Confederate flag belongs to Nascar as much as the cars, and old Nascar icons them self. </p>
<p>Its up to all Nascar fans to protest this hate against your culture. Nascar belongs to the people who built it, the people who waive those Confederate flags. Its dose not belong to the money makeing PC pimps running the show today. </p>
<p>Ya&rsquo;ll are the Boss the redneck is the Boss and it is up to the fans to stand up and protest Nascars ignorant view of the Confederate flag. I will fly my flag because I am white, and its my dam right. I would expect to go to a Harlem Globe Trotters game and see the African American flag. </p>
<p>This war waged against white America, and its own cultural identy needs stop.</p>

___________</p>
<p>Just like a typical black.  EVERYTHING has to have at least one black or it is racist. Maybe you should research the beginnings of NASCAR.  Auto racing in the south grew out of moonshiners trying to outrace the cops with their goods.  Not many black moonshiners way back then.  Come to think of it, not many blacks in Appalachia.</p>
<p>How many blacks do you know that really even like racing? Only after yuppies discovered it, did blacks begin complaining. </p>
<p>Blacks can have their own fraternities, sororities, NAACP, BET network, etc. and that isn&rsquo;t racist?  Looked at the NBA lately- where are all the white boys? </p>

<p>I suppose if you were black and blind AND were refused a pilot&rsquo;s license, you&rsquo;d blame that on racism.</p>
<p>Mauricia Grant (aka Call Me MO Money)suffered no racism.  Greed is what ails her.  She saw an untapped resource and took advantage.  </p>
<p>Next stop:  POLO!!!  She could probably find loads of overt racism at the field.<br>

<p>NASCAR doesn&rsquo;t call their models &#8216;bikini-clad eye candy&rsquo;, nor do most people who watch NASCAR use the phrase &#8216;eye candy&rsquo;. They sure don&rsquo;t. I wonder who might use such a phrase&hellip; ? Maybe I can&rsquo;t prove it, but this is the writers own sexism here, referring to girls as &#8216;eye candy&rsquo;. But, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if it can be proven or not. Nope. Or even if, when he uses the word &#8216;eye-candy&rsquo; to denote a girl - if this is meant to be a compliment. All that matters is that this is offensive. I didn&rsquo;t make the rules but this is one time I&rsquo;d be willing to enforce them.</p>
<p>Someone who claims to be upset about &#8216;racism&rsquo; and &#8216;sexism&rsquo;, even aghast at it, should try a bit harder not to be a sexist. I wonder how the boycott of &#8216;The Nation&rsquo; newspaper will work out? And how much the lawsuit will be for&hellip;</p>

			<p>Reggie&rsquo;s silly post is merely a reminder that a &#8220;racist&#8221; thing is anything any black doesn&rsquo;t like. That is the full statement of the case. What &#8220;racist&#8221; thing has NASCAR ever done? I suppose not being dominated by blacks is &#8220;racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>What a pernicious, meaningless word.</p>

<p>Yes it is a well known fact that America is rampant with racism.  I mean if the Senegalese UN investigator on racism said so then it must be true.  How utterly ridiculous that he should come over here and point fingers.  The bloody cheek of him, look at the state of Africa.    <br>

			<p>I became more interested in NASCAR when I heard what the Left were trying to do to it.  Yeah, they are out to get us folks. Hope NASCAR doesn&rsquo;t buckle. They are obviously going to force a confrontation and back them into a corner where the only sensible thing they can do is say - Back Off! We want to be with our own!&#8221;</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;ll be that.  </p>
<p>Since the Left has already decided from the beginning that &#8220;Thou Shalt Not Love Thyself or Gather Freely Amongst Thyself if Thou Beest White.&#8221;</p>
<p>So they force us to do just that and then judge us by their &#8220;standard&#8221;.</p>
<p>I have no real interest in the Right, but I despise the Left.</p>

			<p>Nascar is fair and competitive. You win if you race well. People who have had unfair race-based privileges all their lives can&rsquo;t possibly fit into a meritocracy, and so will whine their victim song.<br>
If Nascar goes PC, I go the other way.</p>

			<p>I used to read the nation in my leftist days, I don&rsquo;t know if they should be crying racist at Nascar for being too white, last time I checked the Nation was written by a bunch of white jews, with like 1 black columnist.</p>
<p>Hopefully Nascar fights that lawsuit to the death, I hate it how these companys alwasys settle, giving incentive to invite further lawsuits. It is like pouring blood in the water during a shark feeding frenzy. I would love to watch the cross exmaination of that Plaintiff, &#8220;Is it true that you referred to yourself as at work as &#8220;Mo Money&#8221;? I am sure that would sound great in front of the jury&hellip;.</p>

			<p>I live in Johnson City, Tennessee which is about 45 minutes from the Bristol Motor Speedway.  Although I am not a racing fan, I know plenty of people around here who are.  Race weekends are a boon for businesses here.  You can&rsquo;t find a hotel/motel room anywhere.  I even worked a couple of summers at the racetrack, selling souvenirs.  Those race fans are well-behaved, even if they are drinking. There were not fights.  They were just there to enjoy the race and have fun.</p>
<p>The year after Dale Earnhardt was killed, Jesse Jackson showed up at the Bristol Motor Speedway, complete with hulking bodyguards.  He claimed he was there because he was a fan of Dale Earnhardt.  It wasn&rsquo;t long after that, the newspaper here released the story that NASCAR had forked over $250,000 to Jackson&rsquo;s Rainbow/PUSH Coalition and the NASCAR fans were furious.  The president of NASCAR tried to gloss it over that it was just a charitable contribution but us dumb rednecks knew better.  It was a bribe pure and simple.  It&rsquo;s the same extortion that Jackson has been playing for years with major corporations.  To date, I can report, unless it has been done secretly, that no further donations would be made.</p>
<p>Of course, I hate to say that I believe NASCAR will go the way of other major sports. And it may take awhile for blacks to push their way in but it&rsquo;s going to happen.  It&rsquo;s inevitable.  Once one gets their foot in the door (which I think there is a black driver now), it&rsquo;s just a matter of time.</p>

			<p>&gt; Nascar is fair and competitive.</p>
<p>?! Concerning the actual CARS, Nascar hasn&rsquo;t been &#8220;fair or competitive&#8221; for decades. With Nascar, the teams and manufacturers that pour the most money in get the most favors. Period. Dodge brought new money in years ago and were allowed alot of leeway until the other makes complained. Dodge currently can barely afford to stay in the sport, contributes the least financially and therefore garners the least &#8220;favors&#8221;. </p>
<p>Toyota at this point has more cash then Chevy, Ford or Dodge combined and were allowed to buy their way into Nascar when A: a majority of fans were opposed and B: they have NEVER sold a push-rod V8 RWD car in the US, let alone a carburated push-rod V8. </p>
<p>Their second year in they are contending for a championship (Dodge has been back for almost 10 years and still hasn&rsquo;t won one) and the most wins in one season for any manufacturer. Not because they are &#8220;better&#8221; at making pushrod V8&rsquo;s, but because Nascar allowed them to tear-down the others designs and make their own. They then approved the new engine which makes at least 20 more HP than the others on average. The other makes are finally bitching but it&rsquo;s ultimately going to be irrevelant. Toyota has the money - they will get the favors. Dodge will likely be done after their contract runs out, Ford probably isn&rsquo;t too far behind. I&rsquo;m sure Nissan and / or Honda will take the place down the road - so much for the &#8220;Great American Sport&#8221;. </p>
<p>What does this have to do with Amren? It&rsquo;s a perfect metaphor for the selling out and downfall of America in general.  </p>

			<p>It makes me utterly sick that a black woman has to be an inspection official. As everyone else seems to be saying, NASCAR is an American white man&rsquo;s sport. It makes no sense to have black or Hispanic drivers, mechanics, or anything else. Now, not only is NASCAR becoming multiracial, it&rsquo;s also being sued because it&rsquo;s not &#8220;open-minded&#8221; enough toward that multiracialism. I hate to be pessimistic (or realistic?), but it appears that NASCAR is going to buckle (and indeed already is) under the pressures of the liberal media.</p>
<p>Another thing that drives me mad is Grant&rsquo;s statement that &#8220;anyone that has an interest in motorsports, they should be allowed to work in that environment without having to deal with racism&hellip;&#8221; What? &#8220;Anyone&#8221;? When did the average, traditional NASCAR fan ever express any desire to change the racial demographics of the sport? NEVER!! That&rsquo;s why &#8220;racism thrives below the surface&#8221;! We don&rsquo;t want just &#8220;anyone&#8221; involved with the sport.</p>

			<p><i>The white male bastion will be brought down by the media&rsquo;s desire for diversity. The mere fact that NASCAR has become a unifying force for white males has made it a target for the liberal and left wing press. If this was a gathering of Muslim extremist the media would print glowing admiration for their cohesiveness.</i>  <br>

<p>Exactly.  I once read a theory that much of NASCAR&rsquo;s popularity is as a covert/subconscious white pride event.  Our people aren&rsquo;t allowed to have ethnic festivals or civic groups.  Thus NASCAR, hockey games, historic reenactments, gun shows, etc have an unusually strong pull on us - taking our families to NASCAR allows us to FINALLY enjoy a day surrounded by whites doing &#8220;white things&#8221;.  The most popular &#8220;redneck&#8221; events are popular largely because of the white crowds.  </p>
<p>Consciously or not, multicultists know that NASCAR has a white pride element to it.  Therefore, it must be destroyed. </p>

			<p>NASCAR will probably go the way of country-western music, controlled by outsiders who despise its fans, and only want to take their money and defile their children.   </p>

			<p>Blacks absolutely loath NASCAR! It angers them that there are no famous black drivers, and further angers them that the fans are mostly white. Because of this, they call them rednecks, trailer trash, inbred hillbillies and so on. It has always made me laugh how, they like suggest that anyone who isn&rsquo;t big on black culture should be seen as backwoods and uneducated. As though ghetto black culture is the empitome of sophistication, with it&rsquo;s reputation for rap and hip-hop, baggie pants, gold grills, tacky dress, and all around tacky behavior. Not at all surprising they are making an issue of the Confederate flag, anything to bring whitey down a notch or two.</p>

			<p>Steve W: Thanks for your excellent points. Even though I agree with everything that you said, I&rsquo;d like to stress one particular point that you made: you stated that &#8220;a majority of fans were opposed&#8221; to allowing Toyota into NASCAR. Toyota, as everyone already knows, is an Asian car, and has no business being in such an American sport/organization. Now, having said that, I&rsquo;ve nothing against Asians per se, but I still don&rsquo;t want their cars in NASCAR. But what do you expect? NASCAR officials are clearly more interested in being viewed as &#8220;open-minded&#8221; and &#8220;tolerant&#8221; so that they can increase their fan base (supposedly) but especially so that they can appease the ruling tyrant of the Western world  &mdash;  The Media.</p>

			<p>Jill at 9:21 PM: Exactly so.  Our enemies can smell White pride at a hundred miles.  That&rsquo;s why they have neutered C&W; music, that&rsquo;s why they hate gun shows.  Classical concerts, Shakepeare plays, and folk music festivals are as White as any AmRen gathering, but there is no pride, only self-contempt and unbridled hatred for working class Whites, so they continue unmolested by the racial commissars.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Howvever, despite NASCAR&#8221;S efforts to improve their image, it&rsquo;s still a sport where racism thrives below the surface and sexism in the form of bikini  &mdash;  clad NASCAR eye candy is proudly paraded around the speedway, as much a part of the scenery as the stars and bars.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wow! Liberal hypocrisy never, ever, ceases to amaze me. &#8220;Racism&#8221; and &#8220;sexism&#8221;?? How many articles have liberals written that deal with the racism and sexism of Rap Music? Need I give examples? In fact, Rap culture and music has inundated much of Europe,and other western nations, in the form of youth imitating these &#8220;Rap Stars&#8221; with dirty lyrics and degradation of the opposite sex. But afterall, this is a black product, unlike NASCAR, so liberals not only excuse the vileness of much of Rap, but even praise it as a form of high art. Just another example of liberal hatred and resentment for another segment of popular white culture. They&rsquo;ll never stop.</p>

Yes, but the type of whites who attend these events do not identify with &#8220;working class whites&#8221;   &mdash;   (another ethnic group altogether).  They are also the same type who monopolize the media.  That makes THEM exempt.  Indeed, they ARE the &#8220;racial commissars&#8221; who dictate our cultural values. </p>

			<p>NASCAR was much better when it was a good ol&rsquo;boy sport. The drivers were better also. There is nothing wrong with being redneck.</p>

			<p>Zirin is a communist - plain and simple.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the first line from his wikipedia entry: </p>
<p>Dave Zirin comments on varied sports-related matters. Zirin champions athletes and issues which might be overlooked by corporate sports media and addresses the tendency of the media to objectify and employ athletes as pawns in money-making efforts. </p>
<p>Until 3 days ago, the first sentence read Dave Zirin comments on varied sports-related matters FROM A LEFT-WING POINT-OF-VIEW.  Somebody obviously changed it to make Mr. Commie look better.</p>
<p>His books include &#8220;A People&rsquo;s History of Sports,&#8221; and his &#8220;works&#8221; have been printed in The Nation, International Socialist Review, War-Times, and The Afro-American.</p>
<p>Amazing also Zirin&rsquo;s apparent distaste for &#8220;bikini-clad NASCAR eye candy.&#8221;  Csn&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m in the least bit surprised!</p>
