<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>A new analysis by the Center for Immigration Studies of monthly data collected by the Census Bureau shows that the illegal-immigrant population has declined significantly between last summer and May of this year. The study is the first to find quantitative evidence that illegal-immigrants are leaving the country. It also examines the extent to which stepped-up enforcement and the downturn in the economy account for this trend.</p>
<p>The report, entitled &#8220;Homeward Bound: Recent Immigration Enforcement and the Decline in the Illegal Alien Population,&#8221; is embargoed until Wednesday, July 30th at 2:30 pm. The study will be available online at www.cis.org. Advance copies are available to the media.</p>
<p>The Center will formally release the report at a press conference on Wednesday, July 30th at 2:30 pm in room 1309 of the Longworth House Office Building. The report&rsquo;s lead author, Dr. Steven Camarota will be joined by Representatives John Barrow (D-GA), Lamar Smith (R-TX), Tom Feeney (R-FL) and Heath Shuler (D-NC) to discuss the implications of the study.</p>
<p>For more information, contact Steven Camarota at (202) 466-8185 or sac@cis.org<br>

			<p>Gee, living in Southern California, I haven&rsquo;t noticed any drop at all. I mean zero. It seems I see and hear illegal aliens everywhere. How do you know they&rsquo;re illegal aliens. When you have lived in Southern California most of your considerable life  &mdash;  you know who they are for the most part.</p>

			<p>yeah, what a crock. The flood of immigration was cataclysmic in scope. The tiny recession of that flood-if any, is laughable.<br>
too little, too late.</p>

			<p>   Probably an election year ploy. To placate voters. I haven&rsquo;t seen any less of them here in IL. People who don&rsquo;t live in a dirty 7 state(illegal aliens- CA,TX,CO,FLA,IL,NY and NJ) probably don&rsquo;t even know we have an illegal alien problem to begin with.          </p>

			<p>This is the counter-argument to the claim that we can&rsquo;t round up 12-20 million illegal aliens. There is no need to: crack down on the employers, the landlords, the banks, and eliminate social services, and, at minimum, a sizable minority will self-deport.</p>

			<p>They are leaving the country&hellip;they move to NY where the grass is greener. They get their rents and other bills paid and can shop till they drop with there benifit card without speaking a word of the national language&hellip;.and killing U.S Citizens under protection of the law&hellip;.(sic)</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t buy it. I live in Orange County, California and I can assure you that the number of illegal aliens here has skyrocketed.  <br>
It&rsquo;s actually native born Americans (both black and white) that are fleeing the state, especially the lower and middle classes such as myself. The upper class will leave once they find themselves completely surrounded by &#8216;La Raza&rsquo;. The media is lying when they make the dubious claim that illegal aliens are &#8216;homeward bound&rsquo;.</p>

			<p>How do they know that?  Are the illegals reporting they&rsquo;re leaving?  Just because you see a decline in their population in some metro areas of AZ, OK or MD doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;ve headed for the border.  I live in KY and not once did I see an illegal alien where I live until about 3 years ago.  I see more with ever increasing frequency and just last week an old delapidated bldg was turned into a Mexican restaurant.   </p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t believe this for one minute.  Are the same people who have claimed for years that the border is unguardable now also saying that we are somehow able to count the illegal aliens we do have?</p>
<p>Nobody is really going to go back to Mexico or Guatemala when they can make a shorter move to the nearest sanctuary city and go on public assistance.</p>

			<p>Declining! I don&rsquo;t think so. How about relocating to California &#8221; The Sanctuary State&#8221; and how about, more illegals getting in due to the fact that our Immigration Officers hands are tied and really do not want to enforce the law, as they may end up in jail like their fellow officers. California is for all intents and purposes now a Satellite State of Mexico. Come visit and you will see the future of what America will look like. We are broke, corrupt and crime ridden.  </p>

			<p>Does this means if our economy has an upturn, they&rsquo;ll come sneaking back? Businesses who hire lawbreakers must be held accountable. Let&rsquo;s mete out harsh penalties to those who skirt the law and hire them. Others who aid and abet in any way need to be censured. Sanctuary cities need all funding cut off immediately. They harbor and reward criminals who commit murder - witness San Francisco (the Bologna family) and Los Angeles (Jamail Shaw). These are high-profile cases but murder and injury to law-abiding citizens happens daily in our nation. Illegal aliens cost this country well over $350 billion yearly. California is going broke, but the governor won&rsquo;t admit that it&rsquo;s primarily due to the many illegals in that state. Our government throws away enough money in their pork projects. Do we have to have it followed with the money wasted on these criminals? Both are preventable. Taking corrective measures and enforcing the laws already on the books, we CAN get rid of them. Si, se puede!</p>

			<p>They maybe leaving places that have decided to do something about the illegal immigration problem. But, they seem to be moving to places that don&rsquo;t care like here in Las Vegas NV.</p>

			<p>Unfortunately the illegal aliens in my neighborhood haven&rsquo;t got the news.  They&rsquo;re still here, playing loud music and dumping trash in the streets.</p>
