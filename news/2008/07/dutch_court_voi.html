						<p>A Dutch court punched a hole in toughened immigration restrictions, ruling an illiterate Moroccan woman cannot be required to pass a Dutch language test to join her husband in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The order dismayed politicians who have sought to curb immigration from non-Western countries and they vowed Friday to fix the law to cover the loophole exposed by the Amsterdam District Court.</p>
<p>On the other side, the ruling was applauded by rights activists who say the government should scrap the requirement entirely, which they say is discriminatory and violates international human rights law.</p>
<p>Faced with public outrage over Islamic radicalization and the religion-motivated murder of a Dutch filmmaker, parliament enacted a tough law in 2005 requiring immigrants to pass an exam on the Dutch language and culture before they are granted a visa.</p>
<p>The Amsterdam court, however, found the test requirement was omitted from a clause referring to family reunification and ruled in favor of an unidentified North African woman who had been rejected for a visa.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Human rights groups have denounced the culture requirement because it applies only to immigrants from Third World nations, such as Turkey, Morocco, India and China. Family members from industrial countries like the U.S., Japan and Australia are exempt.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Christian Democrat Alliance, the largest party in the governing coalition, said it was determined to overturn the ruling, either through a judicial appeal or new legislation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think that when you start here, you have to know something about the values over here,&#8221; said Chantal van den Berg, a party spokeswoman.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Requiring Third-World immigrants to know anything about Dutch culture &ldquo;discrimination.&rdquo; </p>
<p>It is, but it&rsquo;s far worse as an example of rabid hate by whites.</p>
<p>I mean, doesn&rsquo;t everybody know that?<br>

			<p>Funny. Last week there was an article about officials in England being required to learn about Islam. &#8216;Diversity training&rsquo;, I think they called it. In fact, I bet Dutch schools require that too.</p>
<p>I think they should be required to learn about Islam too. Just not in the way these, white&rsquo;s last, hateful multiculturalists force us to learn about it.  </p>

			<p>Are these Dutch totally unable to pass a law stopping immigration at all? The Netherlands does not need Muslims, especially poor, illiterate, rabid zealots. Just send the usual 60 cars to Morrocco for the outraged Muslims to burn now and then to keep them happy where they are.</p>

			<p>  How can you expect immigrants to live and succeed in a culture about which they know knowing and care to know even less ?<br>
  Does it take a letter like the one below to awaken the advocates of diversity ?<br>
  Dear Diversity Advocate:  I am sorry to report that your cat was eaten by an immigrant, your 4 year old daughter has been kidnapped and sold into marriage by an immigrant,and your son has been beaten by an group of concerned immigrants who objected to his clothing. None of these speak your language and all complaints are racist discrimination against these 3 groups of immigrants.Immigrant Rights Protection Office of the Dept of Diversity and Government Discrimination against the  Majority<br>
Population&rsquo;s Culture<br>
   The letter from a specific agency is a not yet  possible but the incidents in it have already happened.</p>

			<p>Why are Moroccans in the Netherlands?</p>
<p>Posted by at 10:21 PM on July 24 </p>
<p>When I lived there for a while with Dutch friends in 1997 I was told that they come for the jobs, then go home with the money.  I later learned in Spain that these same transient workers would carry cash with them and often sleep by the side of roads during their trips back to Morroco.  This had led to a crime where Morrocans (mostly) robbed Morrocans on the roads in Spain.  Spain had a law at the time that made parking and napping by the side of roads illegal and severely dealt with.  The other side of it was that many Morrocans in NL would get themselves laid off or hurt so that they could take advantage of the genous welfare/unemployment benefits meant to be for Dutch workers.  The Netherlands are a nation and people who have had a hard time saying &#8220;no&#8221; to anything.  They are paying the price for this and their unfounded sense of self-righteousness.  They love their socialist system and insulated grandiose self portrait of liberalism.  It is very difficult to find a Dutch patriot.</p>

			<p>In Germany, kindergarten employees are taking lessons in Turkish so as to be able to communicate with the children by now. Can&rsquo;t accuse of them of inconsistency in any case. </p>

			<p>I say, laws like these will ensure that the multiracial multicultural dreams of the elites will eventually collapse. Let the barbarians not integrate, their alien and hostile behaviour will only awaken more Whites to their alien natures. It is a law I support. Let the different racial populations live parallel cultural lives as this will push more Whites into the traditional European cultural orbit and the &lsquo;common modern globalised culture&rsquo; will become weaker.</p>

<p>They are the third prong of the Muslim assault on Europe. The first is France, second is Kosovo and Netherlands should round up the infidels in one easily contained area quite nicely. </p>
