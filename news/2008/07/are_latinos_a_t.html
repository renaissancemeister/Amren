<h1>Are Latinos a Threat to the U.S.?</h1>
					<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Erin Carlyle, Orange County Register (Santa Ana), July 25, 2008</i></p>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But over the past few decades, [Leo] Chavez, a 57-year-old anthropology professor at UC Irvine, has watched with alarm as portrayal of Latinos has pervaded popular culture and seeped into political discourse. Chavez calls this portrayal the &#8220;Latino Threat&#8221; and it goes something like this:</p>
<p>Latinos are a threat to the nation. Latinos have too many babies. Latinos can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t learn English. Latinos refuse to integrate. Latinos are replicating their own culture in the U.S. Latinos are part of a conspiracy to take over the American Southwest.</p>
<p>According to Chavez, these ideas are not only biased, they are divisive &mdash; even dangerous. They divert attention from a critical national problem &mdash; the legal status of 12 million undocumented workers in the U.S. &mdash; fueling a political firestorm instead of offering a solution.</p>
<p>In his new book, &#8220;The Latino Threat: Constructing Immigrants, Citizens, and the Nation,&#8221; Chavez examines how the story about Latinos developed, and how it plays out in public life. The narrative, Chavez says, drove the 2005 Minuteman Project to patrol the Arizona-Mexico border; the 2003 controversy over Jesica Santillan, an illegal immigrant who received organ transplants; popular images of out-of-control Latina fertility; and the 2006 marches for immigrant rights.</p>
<p>With Orange County-based data &mdash; drawn from a 2006 survey and a 1997 study on reproductive health &mdash; Chavez attempts to dismantle what he says are the faulty tenets of the Latino Threat Narrative. He claims Latinos, like other immigrants, adapt and conform to the diverse, ever-changing culture of the United States even as they enrich and shape it.</p>
<p>Here are excerpts from a recent conversation with him:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Q. Was your method to start collecting images?</p>
<p>A.[In 1981 or 1982], I started collecting images of magazines, newspapers &mdash; this was before blogging started on the Internet. From the 70s into the 90s, the sheer number of alarmist images grew tremendously. We went through two major recessions, immigration became a hot topic. Issues of changing demographics became a hot topic. The browning of America became a hot topic.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Q. What do you think are the biggest factors here in Orange County that have perpetuated the Latino Threat Narrative?</p>
<p>A. I think, number one, the demographic change was rapid.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After World War II with the real estate covenants [in Los Angeles]being declared illegal, people moved out, to West L.A. and other parts of Los Angeles. So you had a white flight. Orange County became the white alternative to the changing demographics in Los Angeles, in the 50s.</p>
<p>At the same time, you have a booming Orange County economically, which draws in more immigrant labor.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Q. I would like to talk to about the belief that Latinos are forming a separate society. Where does this belief come from?</p>
<p>A. It comes from two different sources. One, it comes from the Chicano movement itself. Remember, back in the 1950s and 60s, it was pretty much a stigmatized population. Jim Crow was very strong in the 40s, 50s. Restaurants, pools were all closed to Latinos. Schools were bad in Latino neighborhoods.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So one of the things the Chicano movement attempted to develop, just like the black movement, was a sense of pride. The ideology that emerged was the idea of Aztlan &mdash; that Latinos who are here are in their homeland. They aren&rsquo;t foreigners here.</p>
<p>And for some academic scholars in Chicano studies, they took it even further and said Aztlan is our homeland and we deserve to take it over. They helped introduce the idea as much as those who see, from the outside, that the growth in the Latino population is a threat.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I think politicians have learned that railing against the immigration threat, particularly the Latino Threat, brings in votes.</p>
<p>For the common people who get riled up, let&rsquo;s say the folks who are in the Minutemen .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a lot of their constituents, I think what they really feel, bottom line, is that the movement of people in the world across national borders really is a threat to the kinds of rights and privileges they deserve as citizens.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll notice, many of their constituents are the ones who maybe aren&rsquo;t getting the full measure of the benefits of American society. They aren&rsquo;t getting the best health care. They may not even be insured. They aren&rsquo;t getting the great jobs. They aren&rsquo;t getting the great pension plans.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Q. How do you think the Latino Threat Narrative affects Latinos and race relations?</p>
<p>Latinos as a group, first of all, are very varied. But one thing that unites them all is that the main source of information is the media. There&rsquo;s a surprising number of Latinos who believe [the Latino Threat Narrative]. It&rsquo;s divisive among Latinos.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Until we do something about the Latino Threat Narrative, the anti-immigrant discourse, the idea that illegals are somehow inherently criminals, we&rsquo;re never going to see immigration for what it is. Basically, an economic benefit for the nation.<br>

			<p>Miami is spanish speaking and foriegn. LA is spanish speaking and foriegn. There is a town/city on the lower Hudson River that is raidly becomming spanish speaking and foriegn. Chicago is on its way to being foriegn and spanish speaking. Or, to put it another way,these are cities where a Native Born White American is a foriegner. Think of the absurdity of this. Native Born White Americans are becoming foieigners street by street,city by city state by state in the their own country?</p>
<p>Not are only have Native Born White Americans become foriegners in their own country, they are also becoming a racial minority in their own nation. This is the essence, the heart, of the hispanic threat. Why should Native Born White Americans be in favor of this? When you frame the debate in terms of the legitmate racial and national interests of Native Born White Americans, there is absolutely no reason reason why they should be in favor of this.</p>
<p>No doubt the hispanic invader will respond:your ancestors were immigrants and that since it was ok for your ancestors to come in it is by symmetry ok for hispanics to come in. Native Born White Americans should not be even handed in their attitiude towards immigration. You don&rsquo;t think for one minute that the hispanics are do you ? When the hispanics,asians and muslims out number US one day, they will maintain their racial dominance over White Americans&hellip;forever. And if WE complain, they will tell US where to go.There is no debate. WE state our racial preference for America loud and clear and if they don&rsquo;t like they can leave.</p>
<p>There are irreconcilable differences between Native Born White Americans and hispanics. Never be even handed in your attitude towards American immigration policy.</p>

			<p>Why would the Chicano movement&#8221; need to &#8216;develop a sense of pride.&#8221; Should the White Nationalist movement also develop &#8220;a sense of pride&#8221; over the accomplishments of Western Civilization? Why are Chicanos saying they are different? Along racial lines? Hello?</p>

<p>First of all, these aren&rsquo;t &#8220;immigrants&#8221; they are illegal migrants. Big difference. Yes, illegal migrants do bring a lot of crime, disease and drain the welfare system. Mexico and other countries like them do NOT tolerate illegal migration, why should we?? However, even if these were legal, the American people don&rsquo;t want it. We want to have our own language,culture and people just like Mexico or anywhere else and massive legal immigration will change that. Imaginge if millions of white americans came to Mexico legally and threatened to replace Mexican culture and make Mexicans a minority in their own country? How would the Mexicans like that??? They would hate it and it would be insane if Mexico allowed such a thing. It would destroy Mexico as a country and turn it into something else. Well, we don&rsquo;t want our country turned into Mexico and we have every right not to.<br>

<p>Being a &#8220;little bit&#8221; Aztlan and a &#8220;little bit&#8221; American and then things got out of hand, so that&rsquo;s how all this went wrong for the Latinos?</p>
<p>Hogwash and frog feces!</p>
<p>Developing a sense of &#8220;pride&#8221; through an ideology that erroneously holds that it is a Latino &#8220;right&#8221; to live off of the accomplishments of the white man, is where the thinking errors begin. The absurd idea that &#8220;equality&#8221; is something &#8220;owed&#8221; by real Americans to Latinos, is where the undulating irrationality enter the equation; and then finally comes the delusions, the break with reality, that what white men built was your creations and that he had &#8220;stolen&#8221; it all from the &#8220;oppressed&#8221; Latinos.</p>
<p>That is the reality of the &#8220;Latino Threat Narrative,&#8221; which might better be termed the Universal Nonwhite Fantasy.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

			<p>And to think, our tax dollars are paying for these idiots to write such garbage.  All you have to do is go into any emergency room in LA and see who&rsquo;s there for free care.  Heck, just look at how California, or any area with a large hispanic population, has gone downhill since their arrival.  And what is Mr. Chavez&rsquo;s solution&hellip;grant them amnesty.  That&rsquo;ll sure help.</p>

			<p>Oh, common!! I&rsquo;ll sum up my attitude as to why Latinos are a threat in California. But first let me qualify my comment. It is the llegal alien element, and the utter lack of respect for any laws that they have had to follow, since they have broken into this foreign nation, that I consider the source of the danger. It has created an atmosphere that anything goes, and so it has been the case. Illegal activity of any type one could imagine has flourished. Now, what is going to happen if it is demanded that the laws are suddenly to be taken seriously? Or how about the alternative and the laws are continued to be treated with disdain and contempt. What kind of State of California is that going to lead to. I can&rsquo;t see a bright side, but maybe it&rsquo;s just me.</p>

<p>And the mestizo masses and their leaders were so stupid it never occurred to them that it wasn&rsquo;t the ground they were standing on that was the reason they sneaked into this country, but the civilization that whites built on it.</p>
<p>Land has nothing to do with the issue really.</p>
<p>They forced their way into our business communities because we were prospering and they couldnt do the same.  If we had exchanged places with their ancestors 200 years ago, they would be sneaking south over the border and forcing themselves into our culture down there.</p>
<p>Wheverever we choose to make our homes, non-whites follow with their hands out, justifying their pitiful encrouchments with claims of injustice asserting that whitey owes them something or claiming they&rsquo;re the true owners of where whitey is residing, afterwhich they set up organizatons that drect hate and contempt at us for not rolling over and playing dead when their sorry lot arrives.</p>
<p>If it sounds as if I disrespect non-whites, it&rsquo;s because I do, and they&rsquo;ve more than earned it.  Every bit of it.  I&rsquo;m sick to death of their whining claims of victimization.</p>

			<p>Of course they are.  They&rsquo;re a threat to the culture, heritage and European traditions of the United States of America.  They&rsquo;re loyalty is not to the U.S. - at least not until they turn it into a Rio Dejaniero where White Europeans are a minority.  Then of course it won&rsquo;t be the USA anymore.  It is not long in the future unless some bolts come out of the blue somehow, somewhere.</p>

			<p>&#8220;According to Chavez, these ideas are not only biased, they are divisive &mdash; even dangerous.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
They are also true. People didn&rsquo;t just go to bed one night and wake up in the next morning with these views. They come from witnessing what is going on around them. I know a small town that has had an &#8220;official&#8221; population of around 6500 for the last 30 years, yet every year the school system expands. Now there are full-on Mexican businesses catering solely to Mexicans. Spanish, not the Mexican-American kind but the rapid-fire ethnic type, is heard everywhere. I watched with my own eyes as an uninsured illegal crashed his Mustang into a Volkswagen Beetle carrying a woman, her elderly mother and her two young daughters. Lastly, two illegals followed the daughter of a local dentist, ran her off the road and brutally raped, tortured and left her for dead. Biased? I wonder why?  </p>

<p>A well-worn, tiresome, and overplayed game of the left; attempting to mock and ridicule people who tell the truth so that others who see the same facts come to believe making the same observations is bad. Check out the cable program The Daily Show to see how it&rsquo;s played.</p>
<p>Again we come back to the unanswered question: what part of that quoted paragraph isn&rsquo;t true?</p>

<p><br>
If they&rsquo;re ILLEGAL then they&rsquo;re CRIMINAL. If you&rsquo;re doing something AGAINST THE LAW, then you&rsquo;re COMMITTING A CRIME. </p>
<p>I mean, we all know these people are a bit dim   &mdash;   we&rsquo;ve all seen their IQ stats. Seriously, amigo: what part of this is the brown brain incapable of comprehending? <br>

			<p>This is a puff-piece disguised as &#8220;hard-hitting journalism&#8221;. The L.A. Times is creating the illusion of being critical and hosting different points of view, while providing a venue for Chavez to introduce the latest term in the cultural war: the &#8220;Latino Threat Narrative&#8221; (notice the capital letters). You&rsquo;ll be hearing this term more and more as journalists and public officials adopt it to dismiss critics of the immigrant movement &#8220;Oh, you&rsquo;re just repeating the Latino Threat Narrative&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>We know our criticisms are very real though, don&rsquo;t we? </p>

<p>I consider myself very even-handed about immigration.  I don&rsquo;t want hispanics here, and if they tell me that my ancestors were immigrants, too, I will tell them they were pioneers.  My ancestors BUILT something from nothing, whereas these usurpers want to take over what my ancestors built for me.</p>

			<p>Let&rsquo;s not get caught in this legal/illegal immigrant trap.  By refusing to do anything about the &#8220;illegals&#8221;, our Masters have made it clear that there is no difference between the two groups.  They simply let in as many as the &#8220;law&#8221; will allow, and let it as many others as they can, because their goal is to overwhelm us by any means necessary.  I think we ought drop the term &#8220;illegal alien&#8221;, when our objection is really to all of there foreigners.  By focusing on &#8220;legality&#8221; we forfeit the larger issue, which is the displacement of our people.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Until we do something about the Latino Threat Narrative, the anti-immigrant discourse, the idea that illegals are somehow inherently criminals, we&rsquo;re never going to see immigration for what it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hello??? They are here illegally&hellip;.that&rsquo;s against the law&hellip;.it&rsquo;s a crime&hellip;.so in fact THEY ARE ALL CRIMINALS. <br>

			<p>&#8220;According to Chavez, these ideas are not only biased, they are divisive &mdash; even dangerous. They divert attention from a critical national problem &mdash; the legal status of 12 million undocumented workers in the U.S. &mdash; fueling a political firestorm instead of offering a solution.&#8221;</p>
<p>  The solution is to enforce current laws and gradually the criminal lawbreakers will return to their home countries  &mdash;   particularly, if employers of illegals are vigorously prosecuted. <br>
  <br>
   No, we are not all descendents of immigrants. This is false. Some of us are descended from the original settlers of the country. The settlers/pioneers were in American before the United States and its present minority-loving federal government even existed. </p>

			<p>&#8220;I think politicians have learned that railing against the immigration threat, particularly the Latino Threat, brings in votes.</p>
<p>Then why are all the politicians pandering to them?&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Because big business,who control politicians and who greatly benefit from a cheap mestizo, tell them to pander to them.</p>

<p>Perhaps Professor Chavez could explain the difference between &#8220;illegal&#8221; and &#8220;criminal.&#8221; </p>
<p>Note that for leftists like this cretin facts do not matter; the central reality is the &#8220;discourse,&#8221; some of which are &#8220;privileged&#8221; because of usually pernicious political motivations. </p>
<p>&#8220;According to Chavez, these ideas are not only biased, they are divisive &mdash; even dangerous.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Biased&#8221; is a meaningless noise, a speech act rather than a word. &#8220;Dangerous&#8221; means &#8220;accurate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They divert attention from a critical national problem &mdash; the legal status of 12 million undocumented workers in the U.S. &mdash; fueling a political firestorm instead of offering a solution.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, Professor, the &#8220;political firestorm&#8221; is the prelude to the solution, a free bus ride for your illegal compatriots back to sunny Mexico. In what sense is that not a solution? These people really are terrified of whites adopting the sort of mass racial and political identity they encourage among their own. <br>

<p>I would like to protest this continuous talk on here along the lines that all Hispanics hate Blacks. I know one Hispanic woman who hates Blacks. That&rsquo;s it. I live in a majority-Hispanic city and I know these people very well. The young men all emulate Blacks to the max, form alliances with Black guys, listen to Black music, watch Black movies, walk like Blacks, dress like Blacks and talk like Blacks most of the time. These are all gang kids who are involved in street gangs in one way or another. There is NO Hispanic-Black conflict here, certainly no Hispanic-Black gang conflict. It&rsquo;s not true that Hispanic and Black gangs are all at war. For instance, Nortenos and Bloods are allied (both wear red). Surenos and Crips are allied (both wear blue). Young Hispanic males will not tolerate anti-Black talk and are quick to defend the Blacks whom they emulate as they compete with them to see which is the lowest race on Earth. These young Black males think Black women are hot and say they want to have sex with them. And you are starting to see a few Black-Hispanic couples. If these guys have animosity towards anyone, it is WHITES. &#8220;Acting White&#8221; for these Hispanic thugs is as bad as it is for Blacks.</p>
<p>The Black-Hispanic war is for the most part confined to *Los Angeles* and even there, I think it is quite complex.</p>

After all the Worst President in American History is still in the White House and can be counted on to help them. By making ICE go thru the motions, but not really actually DEPORTING them or letting Homeland Security actually CONTROL our border.</p>

			<p>Robert Lindsay, my experience, here in Los Angeles County has been different having worked with Mexicans in the not too distant past,even some I got to know well. Sure, many of them will &#8220;act&#8221; like the black gang types, and listen to rap etc. But I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I&rsquo;ve heard hispanics I worked with say that if they ever had a sister,etc. that went with a black guy, they&rsquo;d dump her, disown her, etc. They had this same attitude towards even non-gang member, regular black guys. True they probably didn&rsquo;t dig white guys going with the sister all that much either. I don&rsquo;t know. But the animosity I heard towards blacks, was frequent. </p>

			<p>The fact is that all this talk about a black/brown divide is misleading propoganda put out by the liberal media in an effort to pacify us Whites (many of us who are to naive as it is).</p>
<p>The fact before long, there will be so many Latinos in this country that the will overpower the White population, along with the Blacks who have made their contempt for us Whites well known.</p>
<p>We Whites must band together to preserve our heritage and livelihood!!!! If not we are doomed!!!! </p>

<p>You are correct. For all of you who are under the mistaken belief that Latinos will rise against Blacks you are mistaken.</p>
<p>Do not play attention ot this foolish rhetoric put out by the mainstrem media to placate Whites into thinking that we will be okay. They will take care of each other.</p>
<p>They will do everything to work together to ensure our destruction! That why we need to close the borders!!!  </p>

			<p>according to census.gov, Hispanics&rsquo; growth rate is 10 times that of any other group in the U.S. and ~2/3 of Hispanics here are illegally here! Read The Hispanic Condition by Prof.Ilan Stavans (hailed as the &#8220;leading Hispanic voice of the decade&#8221;)  &mdash;  -he describes their culture; rampant crime, greed, corruption, bribery, incest, promiscuity, violence,lack of respect for education,&hellip;. </p>

			<p>Robert Lindsay fails to realize that most Puerto Ricans are black or part black. Same for Dominicans, Cubans and other &#8220;latinos&#8221;. However, Salvadorans, Guatemalans and especially Mexicans do not like blacks at all and in fact view them as loudmouth cowards who do nothing but bluff. They love to call the &#8220;mayates&#8221; on their bluffing. These and a few other indio/mestizo groups will not line up with whites against blacks (except in prison) but they will fight against the blacks every time out. They will absolutely not take sides with them. It&rsquo;s in their blood and their cultures. Just like it used to be in ours. </p>

			<p>I live in the Central Valley and am around all kinds of gang type kids and even older Hispanics. Especially with the young gang kids nowadays, they are 100% on the side of the Blacks. They are Mexicans, Salvadorans and Guatemalans. As I noted above, these kids emulate Blacks in every way possible. From these guys, I have never heard the slightest word against Blacks, and in fact they seem to be trying their hardest to be Blacker than Blacks. If you say anything against Blacks, they jump all over you, take the side of the Blacks, and call you racist. The little kids around here, Black and Hispanic, all play with each other.</p>
<p>I do know one Hispanic woman who hates Blacks, but that&rsquo;s it. </p>
<p>Maybe things are different in this part of California, or maybe I just can&rsquo;t figure it out? I&rsquo;ve been looking for signs of Hispanic hated of Blacks since I moved here, and I&rsquo;ve hardly seen it. Am I missing something?</p>

			<p>Robert, your descriptions don&rsquo;t match any other place in CA or the Southwest. Little kids playing with each other doesn&rsquo;t cut it. Look at what happens by the time the kids hit jr and sr High School. The blacks and latinos are at each other&rsquo;s throats. It doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;ll side with Whites. But they go at each other. What you are describing is the typical crud that goes on in schools, where the &#8220;dark&#8221; students will gang up on the White teachers and any other White authority figure. Do you work in a school or around a school? I speak Spanish and I hear the mestizos talk garbage or comment on Whites all the time. I turn and look at them and then they get a frightened look on their faces. &#8220;Entiendo espanol,&#8221; is usually all I have to say to have them almost staggering. They and other non-whites are jealous of Whites and want what we have. But they can&rsquo;t have it because without us &#8220;it&#8221; will go away. </p>
<p>The amusing thing about the Mexicans and other latinos in LA who openly hate blacks is that they constantly listen to black rap &#8220;music&#8221;. Then again. so do many idiotic White and Asian kids. </p>

			<p>Americans are buying guns at record numbers, suburban communities of primarily white ethnicity are increasingly anti-legal/illegal immigration, trust in our government has never been lower, and both democrats and republicans have lost all credibility. With the economy on the down turn, and tension between Americans and Mexico on the rise, what do you think will eventually occur?</p>

			<p>There is very little racial conflict period in my area. It&rsquo;s almost all Hispanic, with a few Whites and Blacks. Everyone hangs out with each other. All of the Whites hang out with Hispanics and most of them hang out with Blacks. Most of the Blacks associate interracially too. The kids around here fight, but the fighting is mostly between Hispanic gangs. There are so few Blacks here that they have basically no gang presence whatsoever. There are also just fights between kids, but that&rsquo;s mostly within race too. Now and again an Hispanic and a Black will fight, and then you will hear racial insults, but it&rsquo;s in the context of a fight.</p>
<p>The main risk here is to WHITES! The young White men here say that they cannot walk down the street late at night because the local Hispanics will attack them. Neither Blacks nor Hispanics have to fear racial violence against them.</p>
<p>I am aware of ZERO Hispanic-Black interracial conflict at the schools here - zero. Thing is, there are few Blacks here, and I think the Blacks are on good behavior due to being a such a small minority, so they don&rsquo;t start too much stuff. The so-called Hispanic-Black war in California *does not exist* in this town. I&rsquo;ve been looking for it since I came here, and I don&rsquo;t see it.</p>

			<p>Ok Robert, I see what&rsquo;s up. You don&rsquo;t have a critical mass of blacks vs latinos (and whites). THe latinos are openly in charge and the blacks don&rsquo;t have any kinds of numbers. Whites are always the targets. These upstanding minority take that hatred with their mother&rsquo;s milk. They&rsquo;re brought up to hate us and that&rsquo;s the problem, well, one of them. It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether they become unified or not. They are against us regardless. </p>
<p>I will say it is a lot less violent up there if what you say is true. The blacks and latinos have been going at it down here as long as I can remember, but it&rsquo;s making the news now because the blacks are getting their clocks cleaned by latinos who have no qualms about fighting back. They won&rsquo;t instantly be made the bad guy and have the US Attorney flying in to handle things as will happen if a white hits a black (or latino or any non-white) in self defense who is trying to beat or rob him. </p>
