<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Nine months after the 10,000 Men movement was launched with great fanfare, the organization that vowed to mount a massive campaign to retake Philadelphia&rsquo;s crime-ridden streets has fielded only four patrol units totaling about 200 men.</p>
<p>Some of the thousands who attended the organization&rsquo;s initial rally Oct. 21 said the project had failed to capitalize on the outpouring of enthusiasm for organizing African American men into crime-fighting patrols. They say the movement has lost momentum.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Outwardly, the organization appears to have stalled. It opened an office at 1501 Christian St. in a property owned by Kenny Gamble, the entertainment mogul and one of the organization&rsquo;s high-profile founders. But with no paid staff, the headquarters is open only by appointment, Bond said.</p>
<p>And the 10,000 Men Web site (www.10000menphilly.com) has not been updated in months. It still headlines an April 5 Community Action Fair to encourage volunteerism, the organization&rsquo;s biggest public event since its inaugural rally.</p>
<p>The organizers deny the project has sputtered, and say many of its accomplishments have gone unnoticed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve lost momentum,&#8221; Collins said. &#8220;I think there is a majority &mdash; a huge, vast number of men who participated and who I am in contact with via my radio show and in public appearances &mdash; who are as committed today as they&rsquo;ve ever been.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Joe Certaine, former city managing director, devised an elaborate training manual that was reviewed by then-Police Commissioner Sylvester M. Johnson, who was also a founder. The group expended much effort to devise uniforms and an African-shield logo. It identified members of the &#8220;vanguard&#8221; &mdash; those with experience in law enforcement, the military or Town Watch &mdash; who would lead the street patrols.</p>
<p>But Bond said the organization realized that many volunteers had no stomach for participating in the street units. A survey of 2,000 men who attended the inaugural rally found that most were interested in serving as role models in their communities through other activities, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;A large number stated they wanted to be involved in neighborhood cleanup &mdash; things of that nature,&#8221; Bond said.</p>
<p>Still, the organization&rsquo;s public position remained fixed on the foot patrols.</p>
<p>In late November, reporters were invited to watch 100 leaders of the vanguard engage in the group&rsquo;s first &#8220;field training&#8221; exercise in Point Breeze, where pamphlets were distributed on a sunny Saturday morning.</p>
<p>The organizers promised to emerge in greater numbers when the weather warmed and the threat of crime increased.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know the whole nation is looking at us,&#8221; Johnson said at the time. &#8220;We want to do it step by step, do it correctly.&#8221; He did not return a telephone message last week.</p>
<p>The expanded patrols never materialized.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Despite not having much of a presence on the streets, Collins and Bond said, the movement may have contributed to the reduction in homicides and violent crime because it has encouraged black men to reduce hostilities. The city&rsquo;s murder rate began dropping in the autumn, and is down about 20 percent from a year ago.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some men who attended the initial rally but were discouraged by a lack of communication from the 10,000 Men said the experience nonetheless had inspired them to become more involved on their own.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m not surprised this fizzled. Why should a black snitch on another black, and have them turned in, even if they&rsquo;re the worst of criminals?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easier to call for more gun control laws, or stage a phony gun &#8220;buy-back&#8221; photo-op in a ghetto storefront church.  </p>

			<p>About the ONLY surprise in the article&hellip; that they could actually muster as many as 1200 interested Blacks. As an ex-Philadelphian, it took me a while to stop laughing enough to post an answer. Trying to find 10,000 morivated, civic-minded Blacks in Philly? About as probable as honesty in Obama or the Clintons, one would suppose.</p>
<p>Speaking of Obama&hellip; I am not exactly sorry to see much of that vaunted popularity of his starting to fade. Maybe, just maybe a lot of Americans are waking up to the reality the media was simply tryig to do the proverbial trick of turning a sow&rsquo;s ear into a silk purse. Fawning over Obama as the media did.</p>

			<p>Why not?  There are probably only 200 black men in Philadelphia who care enough to do anything to reduce the crime rate in the city, even if the proposal is half-baked and futile.</p>
<p>However, judging by past performance (&#8220;Million Man&#8221; March), they&rsquo;ll say that 10,000 showed up even if only 200 have.</p>

			<p>Well, 200 men certainly is a far cry from 10,000. </p>
<p>This reminds me of all the plans and schemes to &#8220;revitalize&#8221; Gary, Indiana that I read about in the local paper. Rarely do these plans ever come to fruition.</p>
<p>Blacks simply don&rsquo;t want to volunteer. for proof of this, go to webshots.com and do a search for the terms &#8220;Katrina relief.&#8221; You&rsquo;ll see about 20 white faces for every black one.</p>

<p>And did they?  How many black males did Mr Bond get to pick up trash and clean the neighborhood?  My guess: <b>None</b>.  </p>

Isn&rsquo;t this how it always ends? Calls to &#8216;end the violence&rsquo; followed by calls to &#8216;band together&rsquo; followed by tepid turnout.</p>
<p>Here in Buffalo this goes on all the time. A wave of violence happens and blacks form a group with an anacronym (such as MADD DADS) with predictions things are going to change. When the next wave happens, yet another group forms with yet another anacronym and on and on&hellip;<br>

			<p>Interesting, but not surprising. Blacks aren&rsquo;t known for organizational abilities (except when one of their race-pimps raises the tribal call against Whites) or for volunteering (time or money). Blacks don&rsquo;t do something unless there is something in it for them. I also recall when AmRen first reported on this about the possibility of doing a follow-up story and seeing what happens. Thanks AmRen.</p>

			<p>This story is absolutely laughable!  </p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t find anyone because all the black males are the criminals they&rsquo;re supposed to be patrolling against.  This comedy is indeed award worthy.</p>

			<p>Perhaps those 9,800 were convicted felons, and hence ineligible to associate with one another.</p>

			<p>These no-shows are probably the same bunch that calls for &#8220;community policing&#8221;(that is, cops out walking the streets and putting themselves more directly in harm&rsquo;s way)but they won&rsquo;t even help out in their own neighborhoods. And further evidence that when blacks see a need for action, they actually expect white folks to do it for them.</p>

			<p>Altruism is not an African trait. One African trait that they themselves coined the phrase for is &#8220;getting over&#8221; on others. It is unique to Africans in that they consider &#8220;getting over&#8221; on someone else as commendable, as if it were something to be proud of.</p>

			<p>This brings to mind the Rev. Jesse Jackson&rsquo;s bus caravan to upload blacks for work to &#8220;rebuild&#8221; New Orleans, thus replacing the Mexicans who were already working there.  The buses left with much fanfare (was it from Chicago ?) but the mission was quietly and quickly aborted due to no, to little enlistment by black males.  At least we can rest assured that Obama will address and rectify blacks&rsquo; laziness.  All please join hands with me and sing &#8220;Blowin&rsquo; In The Wind&#8221;.  </p>

			<p>Sometimes I daydream about the possibility of 10,000 whites who miss the old Detroit getting together to fight the blight there. </p>
<p>Of course, in reality that place is too far gone to be worth anything other than an object lesson. </p>
<p>Also, should 10,000 white men determined to do something about crime in urban America actually form a group to act on that desire, I have no doubt that they would be facing down National Guard troops the moment they hit the streets (or before).</p>

			<p>I am actually a little surprised that this plan wasn&rsquo;t more successful. It seems like exactly the kind of thing that would appeal to most ghetto blacks, getting to swagger around the city in paramilitary garb, black panther style, looking vaguely menacing and acting like some kind of Superfly type black macho man.</p>
<p>I am guessing since this was apparently a NOI front group, they probably turned off a lot of the volunteers with their typical NOI mumbo jumbo dogma about their dead mullatto founder WD Fard flying around in his space ship, and evil wizards creating the white race in a laboratory etc.<br>

			<p>The missing 9800 men are probably criminals.  Besides, fighting crime would be acting white and there&rsquo;s no greater stigma in the black community than that.    </p>

			<p>Reply to Cliff Yablonski:  </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true. Altruism and cooperation are not African traits. For them everything is a zero-sum game. Perhaps it is an evolutionary response, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
