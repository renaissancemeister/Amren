						<p>The University of California&rsquo;s admissions standards would undergo their most far-reaching overhaul in decades under a faculty proposal that would allow students who have not completed the prescribed college-prep courses or earned minimum test scores to have their applications considered.</p>
<p>Starting with the freshmen class of 2012, the revised policy also would promise a spot on one of UC&rsquo;s nine undergraduate campuses for all students who graduate in the top 9 percent of their senior classes, compared with the 4 percent now promised admission.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Under the faculty plan, the guaranteed admission target would drop to about 9.7 percent to create space for students who have not met the eligibility criteria by the end of their junior years, as is currently required, but who can demonstrate they are on the right track with classes and preliminary test scores.</p>
<p>Such students would not be promised slots within the system up front, but would be &#8220;entitled to review&#8221; by individual campuses that could factor in such elements as their backgrounds and extracurricular activities before deciding to offer admission.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;They are going to look at people&rsquo;s assets more broadly than what was captured by the SAT and a set of courses. That is a pretty positive model, and a difficult one to challenge,&#8221; Longancre said [David Longancre, president of the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education.]</p>
<p>The proposal, which has been in development for two years and was approved on a 38-12 vote last month by the legislative arm of the university&rsquo;s Academic Senate, has not been without critics, however.</p>
<p>By moving away from a standardized, in or out admissions formula, toward one that allows for some subjectivity, UC would be abandoning a principle that has made it a leader in higher education for almost half a century, said Saul Geiser, a UC Berkeley education professor.</p>
<p>&#8220;The proposal eliminates a central feature of the &lsquo;social contract&rsquo; between the University of California and the citizens of the state &mdash; any student who works hard in high school and meets UC&rsquo;s established eligibility requirements is guaranteed admission to the UC system,&#8221; Geiser said. &#8220;Rather than being assured of admission to the UC system, students will be subject to the uncertainties of each campus&rsquo; admissions.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Rashid said his committee, which is charged by the Board of Regents with revising the freshman eligibility policy, found that the current system did not produce unyielding equality, but was a model of &#8220;structural unfairness&#8221; that penalizes students from less-privileged backgrounds.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Demographically, they look far more like the state of California than the fully eligible pool,&#8221; Rashid said. &#8220;These are students we should be bending over backward as a public institution to be fair to, and yet we are bouncing them for these silly reasons.&#8221;</p>
<p>Besides creating the new &#8220;entitled to review&#8221; category and expanding the automatically eligible pool to include the top 9 percent from every public and private school, the proposal would eliminate the two SAT subject tests as an entrance requirement. UC, which started mandating the subject tests as a condition of admission during the 1970s, is the only large public university system to require them, Rashid said.</p>
<p>Taken together, the changes would allow about 20 percent of the roughly 350,000 students who graduate from California high schools each year to be considered for admission to UC campuses, up from the current 12.5 percent, Rashid said. But again, only about 9.7 percent would be guaranteed admission if they apply, he said.</p>

			<p>These educrats are priming up for the new students, whom they clearly know, will not qualify to attend a university. Keep those taxpayer edu-dollars following endlessly.</p>

			<p>There may be somewhat less to this than at first appearance.  First, it comes out of the Academic Senate, from the faculty, thus not necessarily representing the opinions of the UC Administration and Regents who call the shots.  Second, the sorts of changes that they are talking about would probably have more to do with the UC&rsquo;s &#8220;fallback&#8221; campuses, Riverside and the newly-opened Merced, as opposed to Berkeley or UCLA.  Finally, the elites always walk a fine line messing around with admissions at elite colleges, their alma maters and the presumptive alma maters of their heirs.  Taking steps that would compromise the reputation of the system or the odds of their own seed gaining admission are a no-go.  Unless they can count forever on Daddy Warbuckses like the 72 year-old Richard Blum, President of the Regents and husband of Diane Feinstein, to make up for whatever they would lose in alum gifts and research grants from a move that compromises reputation, there are significant constraints.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they have far to fall, given that their competition is primarily top-tier private universities that actively and openly practice Affirmative Action.  And they can always find a way to tease out policies that still protect their own interests while making sure to keep the &#8220;opportunity&#8221; slots open for blacks and hispanics while keeping talented middle-class and working-class white kids out.</p>

			<p>Because it has special low admissions requirements for blacks only, Florida State University&rsquo;s library sounds more like a zoo than a library. Pretty soon, the University of California system will have a similar problem in its libraries if it favors blacks over whites during the admissions process.</p>

			<p>Hate to break it to them, but the blacks, latino&rsquo;s and other assorted dummies, of one color or another, will file a law suit because they don&rsquo;t even have the brains to sign their own names let alone pass SAT tests&hellip;but they will be forced to take in these imbiciles just because of their race or color like everyone else has to put up with them&hellip;..</p>

			<p>They are simply projecting the expected changes in college prep class sizes and test scores.  After all, they need warm bodies in those university classrooms or it might appear that California has no further use for a higher education system.</p>

			<p>California used to offer free tuition for residents, does anyone know if they still do? I know people make a lot of jokes about California, and I have friends that moved there and didn&rsquo;t like it, but it&rsquo;s in California that the West has advanced the farthest. They have a right to be proud of what they&rsquo;ve created, and proud of the advances the West has brought to the third world too. I do suspect people of color don&rsquo;t really respect us, and favor their own and each other over whites and will soon be replacing us.  </p>

			<p>This is the latest scam to keep minority numbers up, also known as &#8220;Lowering The Bar™ &#8220;. The University of California should spend less effort on social engineering and more on recruiting and educating the students who deserve to be there. </p>

			<p>Read Paul Copperman&rsquo;s *The Literacy Hoax* for stories of class valedictorians who scored an amazing 200V, 200M on the SAT.  (If you&rsquo;re not familiar with SAT, those are the lowest possible scores on the verbal and math sections.)  No machine error:  the students were re-tested and the scores stayed about the same.  Copperman quotes, as I recall:  &#8220;These students have been conned into thinking they&rsquo;ve gotten an education.&#8221; </p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not going to hack it in college.  No way.  Not even at Uncle Charlie&rsquo;s Summer Camp. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even going to go into the obvious issue of students at the 35th percentile of a top high school being more qualified than the top 1% at a trash school. </p>

			<p>I retch when I hear the word White privilege, since these days, it can only be considered an oxymoron. Whites are the only people who will not stand up for their rights. For at least 2 generations now, they have been indoctornated with white guilt! And so effectively, that they now behave like docile sheep. When whites were once famous fighters and conquerers. Instead of feeling guilt over it, they should take pride in this. But forget it, most have been programed into behaving like shameful sheep.</p>

			<p>That&rsquo;s code for you don&rsquo;t get admission whitey. In other words, you worked your butt off as a white minority in California to earn admission to UC but now someone with far less ability and substandard test scores gets your seat instead of you. What&rsquo;s wrong with this picture?</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s mainly about money - get more students, more tutition, aid, etc, flunkouts quickly replaced. Big bucks in lowering standards.</p>

			<p>by all means, LOWER THE BAR!!! Especially if the person wants to become a future lawyer or doctor.</p>
<p>Any member of a racial minority DESERVES at least a doctorate degree if he can write his name or count to 20 without too much coaching. Seriously, what kind of pedagogical stupidity is this? Why would a mediocre student get a break simply for being &#8220;less privileged&#8221; (meaning not being a White/Caucasian)? </p>
<p>If the student couldn&rsquo;t take the requisite coursework or score well enough on tests to gain admission thru the normal process, why would he or she be expected to do any better in a university setting? We&rsquo;ve seen some of the childish posts by our strangely silent LaRhonda in the past. Glaring errors, poor sentence structure, childish phrasing of her thoughts.</p>
<p>I guess the obvious follow-on to this admissions program would be to require all employers to automatically accept any non-White applicant&hellip; disregarding his lack of skills, or poor performance on any tests which might be part of the job application process&hellip; then start the minority member out at a salary equivalent to what his department manager earns. Simply for the racial minority applicant not being privileged enough to be born a White.</p>

			<p>How I wish that for a year or two the libs could get what they want: 100% non-white, non-asian freshman classes.  If Whites and Asians could take a year off, just sit out one year, and let the elite colleges fill up with their desired diversity the profs would be in heaven, right?  Could you just see these white lib profs facing a freshman English class in an auditorium filled with 100 black and hispanic &#8220;students&#8221;?  What are the odds that more than 20% of that group would actually be deserving to be there?  What are the odds that more than 20% would know how to conduct themselves in a manner befitting a classroom?  Can you see it?  &#8220;Okay, class; let&rsquo;s settle down.&#8221;  &#8220;Shut up honkey.&#8221; I can dream.</p>

<p>Yeah, the university would crumble. No alumni associations, no foundations, no donations. Let&rsquo;s give up on them; they&rsquo;re giving up on us. </p>
<p>Degress are becoming more and more useless. (They&rsquo;re good for the extreme professions that will always require long study.)All of the diversity has changed the job market and how people order their lives around their work. Don&rsquo;t waste the time or money. </p>

Very true.  That&rsquo;s the inevitable result of the dumbing-down and universalization of college that has occurred in the past couple of generations (since the 60s).  When nearly EVERYONE has a college degree, a college degree becomes meaningless.  If the government gave everyone a million dollars, they would all be millionaires but they would be absolutely ordinary and no richer than their neighbors.</p>
<p>My parents (pre-WW2) had only high school diplomas, but they were much better educated than most university grads of today. A diploma (even high school) really meant something back then when you had to apply yourself and work for it; nothing was handed out automatically. The recent notion of everyone&rsquo;s right to universal college education has produced degree inflation which has eroded the value of a degree. Today, college degrees are a dime a dozen.  You can&rsquo;t get a decent job without at least a master&rsquo;s.  Your graduate degree today is about equivalent to a high school education in the 1930s.  When everyone has one, it means nothing.</p>
