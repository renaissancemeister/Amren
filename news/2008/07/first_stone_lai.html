<h1><a href="http://www6.comcast.net/articles/news-world-europe/20080716/France.Louvre.Islam/">First Stone Laid for Louvre&rsquo;s Islamic Art Gallery</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, July 16, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The first stone was laid Wednesday at the Louvre&rsquo;s new Arts of Islam gallery, the first major modern architectural addition to the museum since its famed glass pyramid was built in the 1980s.</p>
<p>President Nicolas Sarkozy and a major donor for the project, Saudi Arabian Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, took part in the ceremony to start work on the addition, which includes a shimmering glass wave hanging over a 19th-century courtyard. The project&rsquo;s architects say it resembles a cloud or a flying carpet.</p>
<p>The wing, expected to open in 2010, will display a vast collection of Islamic art from the seventh to the 19th century.</p>
<p>At the groundbreaking ceremony, Sarkozy spoke of the need for dialogue between the West and the Middle East.</p>
<p>This gallery &#8220;will be the chance for all French and foreign visitors to the Louvre to see that Islam is progress, science, refinement, modernity, and that fanaticism in the name of Islam is to flout Islam,&#8221; Sarkozy said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;With Abu Dhabi, French museums are exporting, and here today it is Islam that is coming to the heart of France,&#8221; French Culture Minister Christine Albanel said.</p>

			<p>This opens up a world of opportunities. I&rsquo;m sure the Louvre will want to begin immediate negotiations to exchange artifacts with Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s Museum of Christian Art, Iran&rsquo;s Center for the Study and Appreciation of Hindu Relics, and Pakistan&rsquo;s Buddhist Heritage Memorial. </p>

			<p>     It does sound like the French are kissing the Muslims&rsquo; rear ends so they don&rsquo;t burn down Paris like they did last summer. Notice, though, that since Sarkozy took over there have not been any riots or car burnings. Maybe they know this guy means business. It will be interesting to see what he does if the Muslims get out of hand again.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Islam is progress, science, refinement, modernity&#8221;  Let me add to that sentence: Islam is bombing, head chopping, hand chopping, misogynistic, dog kicking, genital mutilating, intolerant, pig-hating, humorless, screaming Death-to-America, head-to-toe-veiled, bearded hatred for anything non-Islamic. </p>

			<p>Mmmm, how insightful of Monsieur Sarkozy.</p>
<p>One must give credit where credit is due, and I don&rsquo;t know what we in the West would do without his brilliant observations and insightful recognition of TRUTH!!!</p>
<p>Unfortunately this worthy is living in the past because his observations, while arguably true, are at least 1500 years too late.</p>

			<p>If anyone in France is willing to give their hard earned money to the &#8220;culture&#8221; that is going to spell their eventual down fall is the thing that is the most repulsive about this article! let thoes idiots put on the display, if it succeeds then those French people deserve the cultural destruction they allowed upon themselves! i always thought Sarkozy was a French Nationalist, what is he doing siding with the enemy?</p>

<p>Yes, and after saying that he picked up a report from his desk and read it.  It announced another 100 cars torched in the country overnight by blacks and muslims, with the prediction that full scale rioting could occur again at anytime, since the situation remains on the edge. </p>

<p>Dear gee vee, I have to disappoint your hopes on <br/>
Sarkozy,but the car-burning continues unabated, <br/>
especially on french holidays. <br/>
Our precious and objective media in <br/>
the free West just don&rsquo;t report it.</p>
<p>On the night from July 13 to July 14 <br/>
a whopping 297 cars were burnt. <br/>
Read it here:<br/>
http://fr.news.yahoo.com/afp/20080714/tfr-securite-14juillet-violences-lead-f56f567.html</p>
<p>On the following night, another 295 cars were burned:<br/>
http://fr.novopress.info/?p=12233</p>
<p>Now I wouldn&rsquo;t call this a success by Sarkozy, rather a media-blackout.</p>
<p>The only big thing Sarkozy has achieved in his presidency is the creation of the so called &#8220;Mediterranian Union&#8221; last week, with the promise of additional massive Middle-Eastern and North-African immigration to Europe!</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re not reading the right media to not know the riots have continued.  Sarkozy got elected on a pack of lies.  The French bought the lies hook, line, and sinker.  Just like we do.  The politicians of the West are to blame for every single ill in this country, Europe, Canada, and Australia.  We need to start voting properly.  Neither McCain nor Obama are worth anything so any change will have to wait until 2012. That&rsquo;s only if we&rsquo;re still around.  But my crystal ball says idiot whites will continue to vote the same way until they are no longer able to vote at all.</p>

			<p> I will say this:: isalmic art is &#8216;interesting&rsquo; - the Met NY has an islamic art section and its certainly a lot better than the african &#8216;art&rsquo; section - but seems like this is being done for all the reasons - my suspicions are;<br/>
a. saudi money<br/>
b. socialist theory that muslims feel alienated and if they have their special section they won&rsquo;t be.<br/>
c. time and study for french school children will be diverted from Raphael, Velasquez and michanagleo to visit this &#8216;art&rsquo;. </p>
<p>Interestingly enough, when spain expelled its muslims it went into its Golden age of art, Zurburan, Velasquez, Murillo, et al wouldn&rsquo;t have found much work for a culture shunned depicting the human figure. </p>

			<p>France keeps their minorities hidden away in suburb type ghettos.  No way would they allow the young thugs that burn cars on a nightly basis near all the riches of France.  This museum is truly a joke.  First because Islamic (funny they use the word Islam which is usually considered more radical than Muslim) culture is not going to be embraced by the French, and second, what is Islamic culture?  Art, music, etc. are considered harem to most Muslims.  These are third world people that worry about daily survival.  If they now have culture its only because they are taken care of by the welfare state of France, and obviously have too much time on their hands.</p>

			<p>Since his election, many have said (and I did too) that Sarkozy was a Trojan horse placed into the French presidency with the massive support of the European media&hellip;. all with the purpose of keeping Le Pen out.  And it&rsquo;s proving true.</p>

			<p>This stuff about Islam being a scientific religion needs to be put in its place. Islam learned its science from Greeks, Persians and other Indo-Europeans while contributing little to it.  I am getting sick and tired when even people on this very website believe these myths about Islam saving the West in the Middle Ages.</p>

			<p>I just hope the Muslims living in France do not send suicide bombers to blow up all the &#8220;infidel&#8221; art in the Louvre because of it being considered &#8220;idiolatry&#8221; according to Islam.</p>
<p>It would be a worldwide tragedy if the Mona Lisa and all the other irreplaceble art treasures, in the Louvre, where blown away in the of &#8220;The Religion of Peace&#8221;?!</p>
<p>To everyone reading this post, did you see the 1996 movie &#8220;Independence Day&#8221; starring Will Smith, Bill Pullman, and Jeff Goldblum?  This movie is about outer-space aliens determined to exterminate the human race and finish off Earth&rsquo;s natural resources.</p>
<p>At the end of this science-fiction movie, when humans finally defeated the outer-space aliens, my reaction was &#8220;Oh, no, Independence Hall in Philadelphia, the Sistine Chapel in Rome, the Mona Lisa and all of the other irreplaceable art treasures of the Louvre, have all been blown away!&#8221;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in real life, I am sure there are many fanatical Muslims living France, who if given the chance to so, would gladly become suicide bombers to blow up the Mona Lisa and all of the other art treasures in Louvre!</p>

<p>The destruction of French (and all &#8220;Western&#8221;) art is a very real possibility.  The art accompanies the culture, which fanatical Moslems think is decadent.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Ross, they don&rsquo;t have to detonate even a match. They needn&rsquo;t bother.  All they have to do is be patient and wait.  Things, just as they are, are nicely going their way.  They are openly predicting (gloating) that in another twenty years or so, France will fall into their hands.  Given time, their explosive demographic increase alone virtually guarantees it.  Then they can  officially outlaw all art  (including music, dancing, etc.) by government decree.  If so, practically EVERYTHING that represents French culture will be abolished.  Even the cuisine!  It all depends how fanatical are the new rulers. And if that comes, they will brook no dissent. Those who now makes apologies for them (eg. such as Sarkozy) could receive a terrible shock when they realize they have created an uncontrollable Frankenstein monster.</p>

<p>Obviously they&rsquo;re betting against this  by trying to appease the monster. The French have always been great appeasers. (Not to say that Sarkozy is French.)  I hope the monster consumes them (meaning people like Sarkozy).<br/>
