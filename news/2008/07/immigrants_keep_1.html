						<p>New figures from the City of Oslo indicate that every fourth resident of Norway&rsquo;s capital has a non-Norwegian background. They may have come from Sweden, the USA, Vietnam or Gambia, and they&rsquo;re playing an important role in the job market and the culture.</p>
<p>&#8220;Without the immigrants who work hard and do a great job, we could just forget trying to keep the restaurant branch going,&#8221; said the boss of the company canteen at the large German industrial concern Siemens.</p>
<p>Of the 10 persons working in Siemens&rsquo; canteen, for example, only two were born in Norway. The others come from Denmark, Sweden, Pakistan, Mexico, Gambia, Turkey, Morocco and Kosovo. All contend that they don&rsquo;t really think about the international diversity.</p>
<p>&#8220;But we do talk a bit about the countries we come from, said Yaya Jallow Olsen from Gambia.</p>
<p>&#8220;And we laugh a lot together and have fun on the job,&#8221; added Lene Halstvedt from Denmark.</p>
<p>&#8220;We learn a lot from each other,&#8221; confirmed Yonus Kaplan from Turkey.</p>
<p>New data from the city and state statistics bureau SSB shows that of Oslo&rsquo;s 560,484 residents, 137,878 are immigrants. That&rsquo;s up from 85,550 in 1998, when the city had a population of 499,693 and immigrants made up 17 percent, not the 24.5 percent today.</p>
<p>The largest single immigrant group continues to be from Pakistan, with 20,313 living in Oslo. Next in line is Somalia, with 9,708 immigrants and Sweden, with 7,462. Other countries with relatively large immigrant groups in Oslo include Sri Lanka, Poland, Iraq, Turkey, Vietnam, Iran and Denmark. Eastern Europeans as a whole make up nearly as large a group of immigrants as those from Pakistan, with 19,721 registered as living in Oslo.</p>
<p>Foreigners also make up a fairly large portion of the population in Stavanger, where many expatriates are working in the oil and offshore industries.</p>
<p>Erling Lae, head of Oslo&rsquo;s Municipal Executive Board, is pleased with the amount of foreigners in the capital. &#8220;When every fourth resident has a foreign background, I ask myself what the city would look like if they weren&rsquo;t here,&#8221; Lae told newspaper Aften. &#8220;Oslo would have been in a deep crisis.</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&rsquo;t matter where they&rsquo;re coming from, but that they&rsquo;re doing well and have a job. And most do.&#8221;<br>

<p>Oh really?  Then I wonder how Oslo managed to survive without any crisis back in the 60s when all cities of Norway were used to be all-white. By the way, and how comes that other cities in Norway who are not infected by the latest immigration wave are NOT in a deep crisis as Lae states?  A big big LIE. He should better look at crime statistics and draw further conclusions.</p>

			<p>If Oslo didn&rsquo;t have 137,878 foreigners, it wouldn&rsquo;t need 137,878 foreigners.  That is, most 3rd worlders in the West make their living either by undermining the wages of the locals, by theft, or by providing services to their racial communities.  They are parasites, no matter how hard they work, because their entire communities are cancerous growths living off the host country.  </p>

			<p>The foreigners have those jobs because by rape, murder, robbery and other violence they have driven the Swedes away from their own capital.</p>
<p>Note that the restaurant industry is thrilled about this.  Food work of any kind is always the most exploitive of the worker.  That is why Siemens loves the foreigners.</p>

The problem is that people like Hilde Lundgaard, who may enjoy the spice of diversity she has access to today, won&rsquo;t be alive long enough to see the consequences her children and her grandchildren will have to suffer and die for because Ms. Lundgaard thinks only of her selfish needs to stimulated by different experiences.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said that liberalism is a mental illness. I wonder if the brain of a liberal produces excess amounts of the aptly named Dopamine.<br>

<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that line before. It was in a movie. Not one about alien nationals but one about really alien invaders, Independance Day. Aliens in the movie, are trying to take over our territory to use it as their own. One of the &#8216;humans&rsquo; tells one of the aliens, &#8220;Just think of what we can learn from each other&#8221;. Finally he says, &#8220;What do you want from us&#8221;? And the alien says, &#8220;We want you do die&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a completely pretend movie. Pure science fiction. I don&rsquo;t imagine the results in Norway are going to be much different however. That was a good movie tho Independance Day.</p>
<p>There was another line in the movie I remember, but I can&rsquo;t repeat it here because it&rsquo;s not PG</p>

			<p>65 % of rapists in Oslo happen to be Muslims as well. Surely, they would be missed. </p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that for one moment.  It&rsquo;s all just more of the same inane, baseless reasons the new world order bunch uses to gain acceptance of their migration policies throughout the West.</p>
<p>Every nation in the West not only would be skating along easily right now, if they had never allowed third world rabble in, they would indeed be much more stable and every bit as prosperous.</p>
<p>A person would have to be an idiot to believe that importing hordes of crime and poverty is necssary for the continuation of a country, especially since the huge sums paid for social programs, jails and court costs, far exceeds the amount of money these people produce.</p>
<p>Only those airheads in the msm and brainwashed academia could ever be so dense and naive to not believe that multiculturizing a nation will  weaken it and place it on the brink of war.</p>

			<p>The one glaring thing about this story to me is that there are a number of American expatriates living there.  The same goes for the UK, Ireland, France, Italy and just about every other country in Western Europe.  Americans have always had a presence in the region but the numbers appear to be steadily growing.  I hope people aren&rsquo;t jumping ship.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m not going to say that the rest of the immigrants are a bowl of cherries, and I think the main benefit these immigrants are giving Norway is cheap labor, but the main problem group as I understand it are the Black Muslim Somalis. They&rsquo;re pretty terrible everywhere - Norway, US, Finland. They&rsquo;re all refugees. I don&rsquo;t get it. </p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t Somali refugees just go to another African country? Like one next door? Why do African refugees always have to come to the West where they do so poorly. I think in Finland I was reading something where the African refugees were committing almost 100% of the violent crime in Helsinki. Specializing in armed robbery and of course rape. </p>

			<p>We had a black waiter (American) when we visited Oslo, who had been living there for several years.  When we asked him what he recommended we do while we were there, he offered his opinion that there wasn&rsquo;t anything worthwhile in the city.</p>
<p>We then asked specifically about the Norwegian Folkemuseum and Viking ship museum, which we had been quite excited about, and he said he had taken his visiting relatives and he and they were so bored they spent less than an hour before leaving.  We went anyway and spent all day there, and could have spent much more time had we had it.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help wondering why this guy bothered to live there when he had nothing nice to say about the place, and when he was apparently bored to tears by its culture and history.  I found out later that wait staff in Norway earn $20/hour or more, which explains it.</p>
<p>What is not explained is what Norway is getting in return for the presence of a person who takes no interest in it. Does it really need a waiter so badly it&rsquo;s worth trashing the social cohesion that makes the country such a pleasant place to live?</p>

<p>NOT! just Pakistanis, MUSLIM!! Pakistanis. Pakistanis are generally disliked by the Muslim community overall for some reason. Sub continent Muslims tend to have less than fastidious sanitation habits, they&rsquo;re pushy and quarrelsome. I am personally, an equal opportunity disliker of all the Muslims.</p>

<p> Couldn&rsquo;t the Norwegians have found an eastern European who would wait-tables for twenty bucks an hour? I wouldn&rsquo;t think there would be too many Norwegian-speaking U.S. blacks? I&rsquo;m NOT surprised at his lack of interest in the Vikings. The Norse built ships before 1,000 A.D. that crossed the Atlantic ocean. Africans never even built ships that could go to nearby Madagascar.</p>

<p>You know I think I met that same black waiter at a cafe there.  I was sipping coffee with my wife and we noticed this guy in a doo-rag and an Obama tshirt waiting on tables.  He came over to us and I started a conversation with him.  I found out he was from Detroit and received a scholarship from the University of Oslo and was majoring in African-American studies with a minor in black history.  You want to know something?  He spoke perfect Norwegian! He said it was just a little &#8220;someun someun&#8221; he picked up from being there.  We talked further and he lamented how boring and &#8220;booger&#8221; the culture was and that there weren&rsquo;t any decent clubs to go to.  He said the only good thing was that the Norwegian &#8220;honeys&#8221; thought he was exotic and couldn&rsquo;t keep their hands off him.  </p>
<p>Does this sound like your waiter?</p>

			<p>Wow.  Talk about a coincidence, we ran into this same American black waiter only he went to the Norwegian University of Science and Technology where he was studying molecular manufacturing and nanotechnology.  His family owns a string of fried chicken outlets in the greater Oslo metropolitan area.  </p>

			<p>KENELM: I am a Norwegian and I will try to explain why there are so many Pakistanis in Norway. It all goes back to around 1970 when Pakistani human smugglers in Hamburg sent about 1000 Pakistanis to Oslo. The Pakistani s had only one-way ticket to Oslo, tourist visa,  no money and of course no working permit. They went around Oslo looking for food in garbage cans. Since they officially were &ldquo;tourists&rdquo;, the Norwegian authorities had no obligation to them, but in the autumn the do-gooders of Red Cross gave them  shelter and food, and later they got working permit. Chain migration during 40 years explains the high number of Pakistanis in Norway now. As for their contribution to the Norwegian society, which Erling Lae boasts of, that is a laughing stock among ordinary Norwegians. It is  well known that Pakistanis mostly live off welfare, and that they are cheating on the taxes. For instance, most of the taxi drivers in Oslo are Pakistanis. Recently it became known that these taxi drivers had cheated tax for between 500 million and one billion Norwegian kroner (between 100 and 200 million US $). Most of them also collected welfare, even though they worked as taxi drivers.  Are you surprised when I tell you that most of these Pakistani taxi drivers were not punished? They even retained their taxi driver licenses. Because, as one do-gooder said, how shall these taxi drivers earn a living if we take their taxi drivers licenses? </p>

			<p>Yes, the case of Pakistanis in Norway indicates the very, very grave danger of &#8216;chain migration&rsquo; once a very small nucleus population gains a foothold.<br>
  It must be rembered that whilst Norway&rsquo;s population is only a few million (and has the one of the World&rsquo;s best standards of living), there are well over 150 million Pakistanis, who mostly live in dire poverty, (in Karachi electricity is very limited and intermittant despite refrigeration and air conditioning being needed for scorching temperatures), and are exceedingly cunning and well organised.</p>
