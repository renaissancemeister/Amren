						<p>ON THE one hand, I expected some uproar in Ireland over my piece about Ethiopia on July 10. But there really wasn&rsquo;t any. On the other, I didn&rsquo;t expect an attempt to jail me by a state-sponsored body. Yet Denise Charlton, of the Immigrant Council of Ireland, has urged An Garda Siochana to investigate me under a special law, by which I could be tried and imprisoned for two years without even the benefit of a jury.</p>
<p>Oh, Denise, Denise, you silly, silly little girl: have you nothing better to do with your time and talents than to try to get someone jailed for saying something you dislike? So there we are. The apparatchiks of the equality industry merely have to contemplate the sector of their psyche wherein their self-righteous emotions reside: and if these are sufficiently overwrought, they decide that a hate-crime has been committed.</p>
<p>Actually, I hate no-one. Personal, political and racial hatreds are the most corrosive and ruinous of all passions. Why, I don&rsquo;t even hate Robert Mugabe, or his chum, the former Ethiopian dictator, the lovely Mengistu, who is hiding out in Zimbabwe, or the Emperor Bokassa, or Idi Amin, and any of those fine fellows who have brought such lustre to the name of Africa.</p>
<p>And so, not hating, I certainly don&rsquo;t want anyone to hate anyone else either. However, I know and feel and applaud measured hostility, the guardian of our civilisation, and the father of our laws. Measured hostility is what puts the gunman behind bars: it drives the mugger from the street and the burglar from our homes.</p>
<p>It also protects freedom of speech from those who would steal it from us &mdash; most particularly in Ireland of today, the quango thought-police of doctrinaire liberalism, and single-issue vigilantes in the media.</p>
<p>This latter group is most conspicuous in Metro Eireann, the magazine of full-time, professional immigrants: that is, immigrants who write about immigration. Gosh: what interesting and varied lives you people lead!</p>
<p>METRO e-mailed me the following questions. &#8220;Do you agree with the charges levelled against you by the Immigrant Council of Ireland (namely that the article can be seen as inspiring racial hatred?) Why/why not?</p>
<p>&#8220;2. Do you agree that your article could be misunderstood in some quarters? If so then what is the main idea of it and what was it really trying to say?</p>
<p>&#8220;3. Do you agree that some of the statements you made could be offensive to people from Africa who live in Ireland? Did you think about them when writing the piece?</p>
<p>&#8220;4. It&rsquo;s definately (sic) not the first time that your writing offended somebody. Can you recall any other instances/ official complaints/death threats etc that you got from, say, the Irish republicans?</p>
<p>&#8220;That is all. It would be great if you could answer these questions or give your comment in any way you wish. I just want to add that there are a lot of Africans associated with Metro Eireann and they&rsquo;re all very offended. So we&rsquo;ll have to run comments from the African community, aid groups etc and it would be really great to have your comment to balance all of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, &#8220;a lot of Africans&#8221; are &#8220;all very offended&#8221;, are they? All of them? The poor dears. Well, if the countries on whose behalf they get so easily offended are so bloody marvellous &mdash; Sudan? Rwanda? Zimbabwe? Sierre Leone? Congo? Somalia? Eritrea? Etcetera? &mdash; why aren&rsquo;t they enjoying themselves back home?</p>
<p>Why are they here, working for a magazine which cheerfully invites me to incriminate myself before our new thought-police? Or which thinks that journalistic balance consists of Lots of Offended Africans of Metro, plus anyone else they can enlist, versus little old me?</p>
<p>And in that contest, by God, I know the sword whereby I stand: the measured hostility that comes from a Tolerant, European Secular Christian Order, the very one that allows Metro people come from all over the world to work here, and ask me stupid questions, and even be offended.</p>
<p>Its origins lie in the Christian ore of our history. It was forged in its present form in Europe&rsquo;s evil wars of the 20th century, where it was tempered in the Holocaust and shaped against the anvil of communism. TESCO stands for personal freedom, unlike the new authoritarian &#8220;liberalism&#8221; that neo-Leninist state functionaries are now making into an official political orthodoxy.</p>
<p>ONE of these orthodoxies is that Africa&rsquo;s woes are the legacy of &#8220;colonialism&#8221;. But Ethiopia (formerly Abyssinia, and far older than any European state) was never colonised.</p>
<p>However, it was conquered by the Italians in 1936, and liberated in 1941 by a British army led by General Sir Allan Cunningham: a Dubliner, after whom a road in Addis Ababa is still named. This final titbit comes from one of a half-dozen Ethiopians who e-mailed me, supporting my attempts to broaden the discussion about Africa away from the grotesque pieties of simple victimhood.</p>
<p>Accepting criticism of one&rsquo;s own country, and from a foreigner like me, is not easy: so thank you, Oh gentlemen of Ethiopia, for truly embodying the principles of TESCO. Metro, please copy.</p>

											<p>
							<i>Kevin Myers, Independent (Dublin), July 22, 2008</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>Last Thursday week, with famine approaching yet again, I wondered about the wisdom of forking out yet more aid to Ethiopia. Since the great famine of the mid-1980s, Ethiopia&rsquo;s population has soared from 33.5 million to 78 million.</p>
<p>Now, I do not write civil service reports for the United Nations: I write a newspaper column, and I was deliberately strong in my use of language &mdash; as indeed I had been when writing reports from Ethiopia at the height of that terrible Famine.</p>
<p>I was sure that my column would arouse some hostility: my concerns were intensified when I saw the headline: &#8220;Africa has given the world nothing but AIDS.&#8221; Which was not quite what I said &mdash; the missing &#8220;almost&#8221; goes a long way; and anyway, my article was about aid, not AIDS.</p>
<p>Since dear old Ireland can often enough resemble Lynch Mob Central on PC issues, I braced myself for the worst: and sure enough, in poured the emails. Three hundred on the first day, soon reaching over 800: but, amazingly, 90pc were in my support, and mostly from baffled, decent and worried people. The minority who attacked me were risibly predictable, expressing themselves with a vindictive and uninquiring moral superiority. (Why do so many of those who purport to love mankind actually hate people so?)</p>
<p>We did more in Ethiopia a quarter of a century ago than just rescue children from terrible death through starvation: we also saved an evil, misogynistic and dysfunctional social system. Presuming that half the existing population (say, 17 million) of the mid 1980s is now dead through non-famine causes, the total added population from that time is some 60 million, around half of them female.</p>
<p>That is, Ethiopia has effectively gained the entire population of the United Kingdom since the famine. But at least 80pc of Ethiopian girls are circumcised, meaning that no less than 24 million girls suffered this fate, usually without anaesthetics or antiseptic. The UN estimates that 12pc of girls die through septicaemia, spinal convulsions, trauma and blood-loss after circumcision which probably means that around three million little Ethiopian girls have been butchered since the famine &mdash; roughly the same as the number of Jewish women who died in the Holocaust.</p>
<p>So what is the moral justification for saving a baby from death through hunger, in order to give her an even more agonising, almost sacrificial, death aged eight or 13? The practice could have been stamped out, with sufficient political will, as sutti in India once was. And the feminists of the west would never have allowed such unconditional aid to be given to such a wicked and brutal society if it had been run by white men.</p>
<p>But, instead, the state was run by black males, for whom a special race-and-gender dispensation apparently applies: thus the two most politically incorrect sins of our age &mdash; sexism and racism &mdash; by some mysterious moral process, akin to the mathematics of the double-negative, annul one another, and produce an unquestioned positive virtue, called Ethiopia.</p>
<p>I am not innocent in all this. The people of Ireland remained in ignorance of the reality of Africa because of cowardly journalists like me. When I went to Ethiopia just over 20 years ago, I saw many things I never reported &mdash; such as the menacing effect of gangs of young men with Kalashnikovs everywhere, while women did all the work. In the very middle of starvation and death, men spent their time drinking the local hooch in the boonabate shebeens. Alongside the boonabates were shanty-brothels, to which drinkers would casually repair, to briefly relieve themselves in the scarred orifice of some wretched prostitute (whom God preserve and protect). I saw all this and did not report it, nor the anger of the Irish aid workers at the sexual incontinence and fecklessness of Ethiopian men. Why? Because I wanted to write much-acclaimed, tear-jerkingly purple prose about wide-eyed, fly-infested children &mdash; not cold, unpopular and even &#8220;racist&#8221; accusations about African male culpability.</p>
<p>Am I able to rebut good and honourable people like John O&rsquo;Shea, who are now warning us that once again, we must feed the starving Ethiopian children? No, of course I&rsquo;m not. But I am lost in awe at the dreadful options open to us. This is the greatest moral quandary facing the world. We cannot allow the starving children of Ethiopia to die.</p>
<p>Yet the wide-eyed children of 1984-86, who were saved by western medicines and foodstuffs, helped begin the greatest population explosion in human history, which will bring Ethiopia&rsquo;s population to 170 million by 2050. By that time, Nigeria&rsquo;s population will be 340 million, (up from just 19 million in 1930). The same is true over much of Africa.</p>
<p>Thus we are heading towards a demographic holocaust, with a potential premature loss of life far exceeding that of all the wars of the 20th Century. This terrible truth cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>But back in Ireland, there are sanctimonious ginger-groups, which yearn to prevent discussion, and even to imprison those of us who try, however imperfectly, to expose the truth about Africa. And of that saccharine, sickly shower, more tomorrow.<br>

			<p>I was in Ireland when the article was published and read it at that time; I had no clue that it would flutter the feathers of the ICI nor was I aware of the ICI&rsquo;s existence.<br>
The article was very well written and made several points which, however they may effect the emotions of Ethiopians, were indisputable.  What exactly is the status(governmental/non-governmental) of the immigrant council of Ireland?  One can only hope that it is not financed with Irish tax revenues.</p>

Just like in the UK, Irelands council members, are all about the suppression of white rights. Non-white immigrants can shout anti western propaganda from the streets, and that is fine. But any white who dares to speak their mind, or voice disapproval against the multicultural mindset, faces prosecution. Europes power structure is now set-up to intimidate and threaten White Europeans against daring to go against the against the establishment. It&rsquo;s a Marxist socialistic network, intent on ending Europes white indentity, and creating a new world order. And it is happening in most of Europe. Brigitte Bardot was once revered as a French icon, but today has been fined and threatened with imprisonment for speaking out against immigrants. With Europes history of bloody battles, and countless wars, Europeans bravely fought to protect and defend what was theirs, it is sad to see how easily they are losing their continent and it&rsquo;s countries to outsiders, all due to their twisted political structure, which is set out to destroy them. Thank goodness there are still independent thinkers like Kevin Meyers, who are still brave enough to defy them.<br>

			<p>It is good to see more and more signs of race realism in main stream media that has been covered at Amren in the past year.</p>
<p>To Kevin Myers: The key here is once you have gone past a certain point, don&rsquo;t apologize and retract. Doing so will only encourage the enemy by showing their opponents are easily scared at the smallest threat. It also gives the public a false impression that apologetic realists were wrong to begin with and that will discourage any further activism. Finally, as James Watson found out, it will not help begging for forgiveness.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure there are Ethiopions whom &#8216;Mengistu&rsquo; had tortured, because of their political beliefs (most likely for being pro-capitalist), who are living in Ireland. There still is some diversity in Ireland, tho these badly named? human rights counsels are working hard to stamp that out. I wonder what they recommend for Ken Myer&rsquo;s rehabilitation during his 2 year prison term? </p>

			<p>Why do we Western societies never learn from one another&rsquo;s experiences?<br>
Ireland initiated its suicidal immigration policies long after the hideous implications of such policies in Britain and in other European countries had been clearly revealed. Was this because the Irish population wanted this? We know that this isn&rsquo;t so. It&rsquo;s because of the same white-hating white bureaucrats who have subverted democracy in all civilized countries.<br>
Ireland, wake up! You have a small country with generous welfare benefits. Your economy, not to mention your gene pool, will be overwhelmed, bankrupted, and corrupted unless you get rid of these parasites right now!   </p>

<p>I find it sad that we have to go through such contortions to avoid mentioning the simple fact that IQ matters, and the africans dont have a lot of it. And we had better rein in our liberals and feminazis before they destroy themselves, and us, in their Moral One-up-Manship.</p>

<p>They are very proud of their tolerance. It&rsquo;s the pinnacle of an educated, multicultural society. Tolerance for any and everything, except Intolerance. It&rsquo;s about tolerance, period. Which, at the zenith of the rainbow, pretty much means tolerance for everything that&rsquo;s not considered &#8216;white&rsquo;. And &#8216;tolerance&rsquo; for everyone, except for someone who&rsquo;s white. </p>

			<p>In a saner world, Kevin Myers would steal Barack Obama&rsquo;s spotlight. I especially like his phrase &#8220;measured hostility.&#8221; I hope it will replace stigmatized terms like &#8220;prejudice&#8221; and &#8220;bigotry&#8221; with a more apt description, one that recognizes a rational aspect to the growing anger many whites feel.</p>

<p>Maybe a hugely public trial would be the best thing for Europe, a lot of support for him would come pouring out of the woodwork!<br>
 <br>
Europe is becoming Muslimized, and too many Europeans are stuck in the old paradigm: <br>
we rule the world, so let&rsquo;s show more compassion.</p>
<p>The new paraidgm is:<br>
we are under siege, so let&rsquo;s defend ourselves, our land, our prople, our way of life. </p>
<p>Now we are the colonized, they are the invaders.</p>
<p>By all menas, let&rsquo;s love everyone one earth - from a great distance, in a Europe that is safe and secure.<br>

			<p>  Too many forget that truth is not a defense against political correctness which has as its stated aim (see Institute for Social Research, Columbia University, New York and articles by its founders where they say the way to world socialism/communism is to make white people extinct) the extinction of the white race.<br>

			<p>Whether or not the author of the contested article consciously hated anyone, or not, my view is that people have a right to their own hate, and to the expression of it, within certain boundaries.  Laws having to do with &#8220;hate speech&#8221; are perhaps needed when such speech clearly suggests violent intent or could be reasonably viewed as tending to promote violence against a particular group in a situation where persons have both the means and the disposition to enact such violence. Such as a group of black rioters immediately after the Rodney King incident in LA pouring out into streets yelling out that blacks should kill whites, or if there were a tiny minority of blacks in a particular town and a large group of whites gathered near their house shouting that blacks should be lynched or burned to death.  In cases like those, a reasonable observer could guess that those expressing the racial hatred possessed both the means and the intent to do grievous bodily injury to others.  However, in any community that is overwhelmingly disposed to view anti-black racial comments with contempt, such as is the case in nearly all white Western societies, expressions deemed as anti-black &#8220;racial hatred&#8221; or as merely &#8220;racially offensive&#8221; must be viewed in context.  Indeed, if we consider the view of Jungian psychology about the dynamics of the collective shadow, rather than condemn those expressing views on blacks or Africa which aren&rsquo;t &#8220;nice&#8221; and &#8220;PC&#8221;, we ought to give AWARDS to these people, for their service to the larger whole, in helping to point out and also diffuse the collective psychological shadow material.  Hate is a completely normal human emotion and &#8220;racial hatred&#8221; is at one time or another experienced by everyone, at some level, consciously or unconsciously. It isn&rsquo;t helpful to nurture our hatred, because that tends to poision us, but it also poisons us to deny our hatred or project it out onto other groups.  Liberals have a massive problem with deying their own hatred, just as conservatives often have a problem in accepting their contrasexual selves.  INdividual and collective psychological health is obtained first by projecting outwards, and then by recollecting our projections and &#8220;owning&#8221; our own stuff.  In the face of huge masses of deluded and repressed people of all colors who can&rsquo;t seem to stomach any white person saying anything the least critical of blacks or of Africa, it is a needed wake-up call to hear someone saying the kinds of things this author said, to help people come to their senses and expose hypocrisy and fascist attempts to control speech and opinion.  Even if he said them for no other reason but to play devil&rsquo;s advocate with double standards and hypocrisies, that seems good enough reason to me. I recently read that in the 1800&rsquo;s in England, men could be and were sometimes hanged for suggesting that the Empire should help out its miserable white poor: the destitute throngs.  When an opinion becomes a crime, we&rsquo;re all in trouble.    </p>

<p>   I fully expect a &#8220;Camp of the Saints&#8221; mass exodus to Europe from Africa in the near future. European governments must either get tough with the illegal immigrant lawbreakers or cease to exist as economically prosperous centers of civilization and progress. </p>

<p>          My opinion is that we are watching the slow cancerous death of western culture including your dear Ireland and my beloved USA by the removal of industry from the first world to the third world, and by moving huge numbers of third world peoples into first world nations with no regard to climate, race, religion, language, culture, or communicable diseases.  On top of all of this, &#8220;we&#8221; force our media and schools to teach that this is a strength and a positive event.</p>
<p>          What does a nation become when a vast amount of its population becomes first generation immigrants who hold to an extremely different race, religions, beliefs, and languages with no chance of assimilation or cohesion to the host nation?  I submit that the host nations will become just as a neighborhood or community becomes when they experience this on a smaller scale.  The community becomes undesirable, the wealthy flee, the infrastructure begins to rapidly decay, and lawlessness abounds.</p>

			<p>Why threaten to jail him? What are they afraid of? Seems it might be that his words are too close to the truth, and might actually open some eyes. If they really believed he was wrong, they would not try and supress his speech, and would instead have someone of the opposite mind-set write a rebuttal.</p>
