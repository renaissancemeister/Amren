						<p>The planned construction of over 180 mosques in Germany is mobilizing right-wing xenophobes but also an increasing number of leftist critics. They fear the Muslim places of worship will facilitate the establishment of a completely parallel society.</p>
<p>Responding to public pressure, architects reduced the size of a controversial mega-mosque planned for the city of Cologne.</p>
<p>The issue at hand wasn&rsquo;t the construction of a missile base or a new nuclear power plant. Yet the media reported &#8220;turmoil&#8221; and an &#8220;enraged&#8221; audience in a school auditorium in Ehrenfeld, a district of the German city of Cologne. The mood was almost comparable to that of the protest gatherings once held against nuclear missiles or reactors.</p>
<p>Instead the outrage was directed at a huge mosque planned for the area. Still, the words used by the project&rsquo;s opponents called to mind the protests of earlier times. &#8220;The minarets even look like missiles,&#8221; railed one woman. A man said the mosque&rsquo;s dome reminded him &#8220;of a nuclear plant.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ill will over mosques like the one being built in Cologne is spreading rapidly throughout Germany, often to the surprise of local politicians. For a long time the establishment of Muslim prayer rooms provoked little protest, housed as they were mostly in residential buildings, shops and back courtyards. Recently, though, there has been an increasing number of acts of protest, some violent. Molotov cocktails were thrown through mosque windows in the Bavarian town of Lauingen; Christians set protest crosses inscribed with &#8220;Terra christiana est,&#8221; or this is Christian land, on the grounds of a mosque in Hanover; and construction trailers went up in flames in the Berlin district of Pankow.</p>
<p>The anti-Islam protest movement has also begun to spill over into city politics. In Cologne, for example, the extreme right anti-mosque initiative Pro Cologne captured five local government seats in recent elections. Now the group is aspiring to enter the national scene as Pro Germany, together with other like-minded organizations, some from the far-right fringe. Their approach follows the example of populist Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn, whose anti-immigration party garnered a surprising degree of support before he was murdered in 2002.</p>
<p>In Germany there is also a market for these &#8220;single-issue parties,&#8221; suggests trend researcher Adjiedj Bakas, who himself emigrated from Surinam to the Netherlands. In the populous Ruhr Valley region of western Germany the Voter Initiative Recklinghausen (whose acronym &#8220;WIR&#8221; is the German word for &#8220;we&#8221;) has found resonance with its message. The group claims it is fighting against &#8220;creeping Islamization,&#8221; and is allied in the local government with the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), one of Germany&rsquo;s major political parties. WIR members say they aren&rsquo;t alone in their opposition to Islam and their concern &#8220;that in 20 years in Recklinghausen, as in all large German cities, the majority of the residents under the age of 40 will be Muslims.&#8221; &#8220;Discomfort is already spreading in some parts of the city,&#8221; says Georg Schliehe, a WIR representative on the local city council, &#8220;but policy, public authorities and scholars downplay the problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>This burgeoning sentiment against mosques has no doubt been strengthened by the Islamist murders and suicide attacks that have also afflicted European cities in recent years. Some Muslims like Imran Sagir, director of a property development company specializing in mosques, say they can understand German citizens&rsquo; fears. When you hear on the news about crimes committed in the name of Islam,&#8221; he says, &#8220;who can blame people who don&rsquo;t want a mosque in the neighborhood?&#8221;</p>
<p>Wolfgang Huber, the head of Germany&rsquo;s Protestant Church and bishop for the states of Berlin and Brandenburg, names what he sees as one important cause for the increasing unease. He says there is an &#8220;obviously large-scale initiative&#8221; on the part of Islamic organizations to show their presence in as high-profile a way as possible and in as many places as possible. No fewer than 184 new mosques, some with domes and minarets, are currently being built or planned throughout Germany. That&rsquo;s considerably more than the 163 existing traditional mosques (along with around 2,600 prayer rooms mostly hidden within secular buildings).</p>
<p>And that appears to be only the start of an expected wider European mosque-building boom. One organization alone &mdash; Ahmadiyya, a movement seen as an outsider community within Islam that the respected German weekly Die Zeit described as &#8220;something like the Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses among Muslims&#8221; &mdash; has introduced a &#8220;100 mosque plan&#8221; for Germany. Currently 25 percent of these projects have been completed.</p>
<p>More often than in the past, Muslim communities nowadays are trying to include Middle Eastern style minarets in their building projects. It&rsquo;s an addition that is rousing greater protest &mdash; no matter where the mosque is getting built in Germany. &#8220;As soon as the foreignness is cemented in a structure like a mosque, the problems just multiply,&#8221; says Christoph Dahling-Sander, the Protestant church&rsquo;s representative in the city of Hanover for matters concerning Islam.</p>
<p>There have been some notable exceptions, though. Residents in the far northern town of Rendsburg in the state of Schleswig-Holstein kept their famous northern German composure and a majority accepted the construction of a large mosque. But as a rule, when building plans for mosques become public, neighbors immediately mobilize with a laundry list of concerns about why they will be bad for the neighborhood. They fear parking shortages, plunging property values and noise pollution. Hoping to maintain a veneer of political correctness, local politicians with the traditional parties play down these concerns. But by doing so, they just create even greater opportunity for grassroots groups like the citizens&rsquo; movement Pro Germany.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where this kind of gaudy Middle Eastern building goes up, with a dome and minarets, the next thing will be an application to the authorities for permission to do the call to prayer,&#8221; a passage on the Pro Germany Web site reads. It&rsquo;s visions like this that are leading more and more Germans to see the construction of mosques as the expression of a &#8220;kind of land grab,&#8221; observes Claus Leggewie, a political science professor at the University of Giessen in the western state of Hesse.</p>
<p>This impression is aggravated not only by right-wing agitators but also, according to Leggewie, by careless or sometimes even deliberately provocative statements by Muslim builders. Many seem to think like Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. In words spoken in 1997, Erdogan made mosque construction seem like part of a strategy of Islamization: &#8220;The minarets are our lances, the domes our helmets, the believers our army.&#8221;</p>
<p>The names of some of the newly built mosques aren&rsquo;t exaclty in harmony with the reassuring &#8220;Islam is peace&#8221; slogan. Religious scholar Ursula Spuler-Stegemann at Germany&rsquo;s University of Marburg, among others, criticizes the fact that mosques are named after warlords like Fatih Sultan Mehmet, conqueror of Constantinople. &#8220;That can only be an agenda,&#8221; she believes. &#8220;These Muslims don&rsquo;t just want to show their presence here, but also to strengthen and expand it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Statements made by intellectuals like Spuler-Stegemann, who has also said that, &#8220;Islam has a problem with violence,&#8221; underscore the fact that criticism of mosque construction is no longer exclusively the domain of mindless xenophobes. And it would be a mistake, offical representatives on immigration issues from Germany&rsquo;s states warned a recent joint convention, to sweepingly dismiss mosque critics as being right-wing extremists.</p>
<p>In the case of the controversy over the mosque planned for Cologne&rsquo;s Ehrenfeld neighborhood, the right-wing Pro protesters have indeed been pushed into the margins. Their complaints have been drowned out by more high-profile statements coming from prominent leftists and liberals including German Jewish journalist Ralph Giordano, women&rsquo;s rights activist Alice Schwarzer and investigative reporter GÃ¼nter Wallraff, who have all spoken out against the mosque. Representatives of Germany&rsquo;s large churches have increasingly added their voices to the criticism as well. The &#8220;dishonest dialogue&#8221; with Islam described in SPIEGEL&rsquo;s pages in December 2001 &mdash; in which church representatives simply ignored scandalous and unbearable aspects like persecution of Christians, discrimination against women, toleration of terror and &#8220;honor&#8221; killings for the sake of harmony &mdash; is now a thing of the past.</p>
<p>In place of the &#8220;fairy tale that we&rsquo;re all &lsquo;children of Abraham&rsquo;,&#8221; in the words of Leggewie, the churches are now making an effort not to entangle themselves in finding contrived common ground with Islam. Instead they are trying to find areas in which they differ &mdash; and this applies particularly to the construction of mosques.</p>
<p><b>&#8220;Why Would You Build a Mosque in an Area Where Nobody Lives?&#8221;</b></p>
<p>Of course the Protestant and Catholic churches stress unanimously that Germany&rsquo;s more than 3 million Muslims have the same constitutional right to build houses of worship.</p>
<p>But agreeing to a mosque, German Protestant leader Bishop Huber said at a national church meeting in 2007, should in no way preclude the opportunity for an open and critical discussion about the location, size and number of such buildings.</p>
<p>Location, size, number &mdash; at least one of these factors seems to be out of proportion in some of the 184 new mosque projects. There are plenty of examples out there.</p>
<p>In Berlin the local Ahmadiyya congregation, just 200 members strong, is pushing construction of a mosque at a cost of around â¬1 million ($1.6 million) in Berlin&rsquo;s suburban Heinersdorf district, which is home to a paucity of Muslims. Feeling left out of the process by local politicians, furious residents quickly began to gather at numerous, often overflowing and sometimes tumultuous protest meetings. &#8220;No to the mosque&#8221; or, as in the time around the fall of the Berlin Wall in this former East German district, &#8220;We are the people.&#8221; They demanded that their quiet neighborhood not be allowed to be transformed into a &#8220;second Kreuzberg,&#8221; a reference to a downtown Berlin neighborhood known for its massive Turkish immigrant population. &#8220;Why?&#8221; one of the speakers asked, drawing applause, &#8220;Why would you build a mosque in an area where no Muslims live?&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in populous Cologne in western Germany, the locally based Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs (DITIB) &mdash; which has close ties to a sister institution in Ankara &mdash; has plans to build what it is describing as &#8220;Europe&rsquo;s biggest mosque.&#8221; The construction is designed for thousands of visitors and slated for Ehrenfeld, an overburdened neighborhood that already suffers from a serious parking shortage. It&rsquo;s not just the mosque&rsquo;s location that has local residents seething, though, it&rsquo;s also its gigantic scale. Once built, the mosque will have a surface of 22,000 square meters (236,800 square feet) and 55-meter minarets standing as tall as an 18-story office tower. The enormous Ottoman style building, pronounces author Dieter Wellershoff, is as strange for some residents as it would be &#8220;if it were some object that suddenly landed there from another planet.&#8221;</p>
<p>And in Frankfurt&rsquo;s village-like Hause district, already home to two mosques, a 300-member association wants to erect the third Muslim community center in a 400-meter radius at a cost of â¬3 million. Local residents are afraid the concentration of mosques might cause their area to &#8220;tip.&#8221; A typical statement made by local residents at protest meetings goes like this: &#8220;It wouldn&rsquo;t feel like home anymore if more come here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The resentment fomenting amongst the mosque&rsquo;s opponents, who have already collected well over 1,000 signatures, was further fueled when the local Green Party&rsquo;s spokesperson on integration policies, Nargess Eskandari-GrÃ¼nberg, pointed out that 40 percent of the city&rsquo;s population are immigrants. &#8220;If that doesn&rsquo;t suit you,&#8221; she said, &#8220;then you need to move somewhere else.&#8221;</p>
<p>Local mosque critics did manage to find support from the Protestant Church, whose leader in the local state of Hesse dismissed the Green Party politician&rsquo;s statement as &#8220;tasteless.&#8221; Although state church leader Peter Steinacker says he has no personal objections to the construction project, he says the issue of whether a third mosque should be built in an area like Hausen is a &#8220;question of political prudence.&#8221;</p>
<p>These conflicts often come to a head following the same pattern. Persuaded by the argument that Germany&rsquo;s constitutionally guaranteed freedom of religion requires them to authorize any proposed mosque, city administrators are often keen to come to an arrangement with builders early and behind closed doors, coming to comprehensive agreements.</p>
<p>But with this strategy, which political scientist Leggewie describes as &#8220;paternalistic,&#8221; local governments tend to make &#8220;the mosque association&rsquo;s demands their own&#8221; and to inform the public of &#8220;too little, too late.&#8221; And because the Muslim communities &#8220;often don&rsquo;t display the necessary openness&#8221; when residents find out about the sometimes enormous projects, they feel they&rsquo;re being presented with a done deal and taken for fools.</p>
<p>Often it is only then, when the local conflict is taking on traits of a clash of civilizations, that the fundamental questions avoided by city planners at the beginning of the process are discussed. They include, for example, topics such as how the organization behind the project deals with issues like terrorism and women&rsquo;s rights, whether the project is aimed at integration or separation and whether plans that go to architectural extremes are really covered by the constitutionally protected right to freedom of religion.</p>
<p>And it is often in this phase that local media and local politicians raise the issue of how the planned mega-mosques differ from Christian or Jewish holy buildings. &#8220;Whether a mosque can even be called a house of worship at all,&#8221; says Middle East scholar Spuler-Stegemann, &#8220;is contested even within Islam.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Islam expert Leggewie&rsquo;s opinion, mosques are &#8220;definitely not churches.&#8221; He says they can be better described as multipurpose buildings. In the same way, Islam itself is &#8220;not just a religion,&#8221; emphasizes Daniel Cohn-Bendit, a Green Party politician and long-term representative for multicultural affairs in Frankfurt. It is &#8220;also a theocratic vision,&#8221; in which politics and belief are inseparably bound and &#8220;democracy and human rights are subordinate and conditional values.&#8221; Islamic associations are not officially recognized religious communities, points out Necla Kelek, a Germany-based sociologist and feminist of Turkish descent. Granting building permits for mosques, she says, is &#8220;not a question of freedom of religion but a political question.&#8221; She says Germany&rsquo;s laws governing construction and associations are ill-equipped for dealing with the issue.</p>
<p>The great dissimilarity between these mosque centers and churches is evident in the original plans for the Cologne mosque, in which only one-fifth of the 22,000 square meters was set aside as an area for prayer. The remaining space, according to a Turkish-language appeal for donations, was intended for a TV studio, pharmacy, doctor&rsquo;s office, legal practice, bakery, hairdresser, supermarket, bank, preschool, library, restaurant and jewelry store. The mosque&rsquo;s size was only later reduced as a result of public protest.</p>
<p>Large mosques like the one in Cologne often offer even more: Koran schools and kickboxing studios, computer and TV rooms, travel agencies and funeral homes &mdash; all services provided under one roof or in the immediate vicinity. &#8220;It&rsquo;s everything a Muslim needs outside the apartment,&#8221; claims Kelek, &#8220;If he wants to, in addition to praying, it also allows him to have nothing to do with Germany society.&#8221; She describes the mosques as &#8220;breeding grounds&#8221; for a parallel society and an &#8220;obstacle to integration.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under the pretext of religious privilege, the DITIB strategists in Cologne have in truth claimed the rights to a commercial center that also happens to include the opportunity to pray. A Muslim community in Berlin&rsquo;s NeukÃ¶lln district also wanted to take its cue from Cologne and construct an immense commercial and cultural center. But at least the planners there, as the daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung recognized, only described the structure as being a &#8220;semi-mosque.&#8221;</p>
<p>That plan, however, failed in the face of the strong opposition of Deputy Mayor and District Councilwoman Stefanie Vogelsang of the conservative Christian Democrats. Her awareness of the issue had been heightened by a conflict with DITIB a few years earlier, when the organization deliberately violated its building permits during the construction of a new mosque in the same neighborhood.</p>
<p>By the time construction had been completed, the mosque&rsquo;s two minarets rose 37 meters into the Berlin skyline rather than the approved 28 meters and the dome measured around 22 meters instead of the permitted 18. For Vogelsang that was cause enough to slap the Muslim congregation with the highest fine ever imposed in her district, â¬100,000. &#8220;Whoever lives here, whoever builds here, needs to follow our laws,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The local Berliner Kurier newspaper praised her as the &#8220;councilwoman who doesn&rsquo;t let people walk all over her,&#8221; but the Muslim community had a totally different opinion. It would have been perfectly fine if the illegally erected minarets had been &#8220;a little bit bigger,&#8221; a reporter overheard in the mosque. Another congregation member complained that &#8220;every mosque in Turkey&#8221; is bigger. &#8220;They must be laughing themselves silly at us,&#8221; he grumbled.</p>
<p>Reactions like that reinforce the impression on the part of critics like Spuler-Stegemann that for some building associations mosque construction is, more than anything, a show of power and an effort to establish Muslim enclaves. &#8220;Where you can hear the call of the minaret,&#8221; she says, &#8220;from a certain Muslim perspective, that&rsquo;s Islamic ground.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Building Code Violations and other Community Spats</b></p>
<p>After her experience with the mosque on Columbiadamm, Vogelsang appeared determined &#8220;not to allow herself to be tricked&#8221; and not to allow further Muslim communities to massively violate building code. Later, she successfully blocked an association called Inssan, which had plans to build an immense mosque center in NeukÃ¶lln, which is already home to 15 official mosques and 31 other prayer rooms. The proposed structure violated &#8220;all zoning ordinances,&#8221; she claims.</p>
<p>The 8,000-square-meter complex had been planned for a strictly residential area with no bus service or parking lots; and it would have been located near the RÃ¼tli School, which became infamous throughout Germany in 2006 for its high level of student violence. The building was designed to sit along the street on a strip of land 73 meters wide, rather than the prescribed 13 meters, with an area 40 percent greater than that permitted in the area.</p>
<p>Financing for the project also seemed dubious to Vogelsang. After the builders &#8220;almost snottily&#8221; rejected requests for disclosure of their sources of funding to district authorities. She eventually found out through the Berlin state government&rsquo;s Interior Ministry that &#8220;Saudi and other Arab foundations&#8221; were behind the project &mdash; countries ranking at the bottom of the list on the global scale of religious freedom.</p>
<p>The building lot had been purchased by Ibrahim el-Zayat, a representative of the Islamic Community of Germany organization. The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, Germany&rsquo;s domestic intelligence agency, claims the group has connections to the Muslim Brotherhood and other radical groups. Vogelsang doesn&rsquo;t believe the Inssan Association&rsquo;s assertions that there are no strings attached to the donations from the Middle East. &#8220;You find someone who is willing to give me â¬15 to â¬20 million with no strings attached,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>Vogelsang considers herself lucky &#8220;that the mosque could be rejected because of construction ordinances,&#8221; but the Inssan Association is already pursuing a new strategy. It now wants to build the mosque center in a commercial zone in western Berlin&rsquo;s Charlottenburg neighborhood. The site first chosen in a residential part of NeukÃ¶lln was zoned for chuches, but not meeting places of the mass scale of the mosque center.</p>
<p>The organization has also been taking great pains to publicly position itself as being moderate in its approach to Islam. It arranges PR training for its members, criticizes forced marriages and runs blood drives and environmental campaigns. In this, diehard opponents see less a sign of liberalization than a camouflage intended to deflect attention from the group&rsquo;s dubious funding sources and Islamist backers.</p>
<p>&#8220;To get in good with the Berlin elite, you meet with members of the dialogue industry and put on some politically correct events,&#8221; says Ian Johnson, an American author, Pulitzer Prize winner and Islam expert living in Berlin.</p>
<p>Instead of putting all their cards on the table when they meet with adjacent property owners, leaders of an association wanting to build will strike a deal with &#8220;the usual clique of politicians and officials in charge of immigrant issues,&#8221; says Johnson, and then put &#8220;a mosque right down in the middle of the neighborhood.&#8221; This approach carries the danger that &#8220;through the lack of a democratic outlet,&#8221; residents will be pushed into the arms of right-wing populists who reject the construction projects for &#8220;nationalistic or racist reasons.&#8221;</p>
<p>Public opinion polls generally show that the predominant view in Germany&rsquo;s major cities is that Muslims should have a right to places of worship beyond those hidden behind courtyards &mdash; as long as the plans comply with building laws and fit their surroundings. At the same time, a majority supports the position of journalist Giordano, who suggests there is &#8220;no fundamental right to building a mega-mosque,&#8221; especially if it disrupts the look of the city around it. A balance, says Giordano, must be found &#8220;between the back courtyard and the centrally located grand mosque.&#8221;</p>
<p>The group that is dead set against the construction of any type of mosque is a relatively small minority. But in addition to affected residents and xenophobes whose views cannot be changed, this group of opponents also notably includes Islam experts from the Muslim world.</p>
<p>There are &#8220;more than enough mosques in Germany,&#8221; says Mina Ahadi, co-founder of Germany&rsquo;s Central Council of Ex-Muslims. Ahadi has been under police protection since she publicly renounced Islam &mdash; a crime punishable by death according to radical interpretations of sharia law.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When a mosque is built,&#8221; Ahadi says, &#8220;the result is that greater pressure is placed on women, and even more children are forced to wear a headscarf to school, which leads to isolation.&#8221; She accuses German politicians of &#8220;boundless naivetÃ©&#8221; in their dealings with Islamic organizations that, she argues, &#8220;ultimately want to instate sharia law.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, among those local politicians who have no general objections to mosques being built, there is an increasing willingness to investigate the true ambitions and financial backers of the builders more fully than in the past. This is not always easy, however, given the complexity of the situation as well as the fact that imams&rsquo; sermons are mostly delivered in languages other than German. Moreover, some groups are adept at strategies for concealing intentions that run contrary to the German constitution, using what the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution calls &#8220;legality tactics&#8221; &mdash; in other words, using government means to get around government laws.</p>
<p>Even DITIB, the comparatively moderate organization behind the mosque project in Cologne, arouses mistrust. DITIB is the long arm of a religious institution in secular Turkey. &#8220;What will most likely happen,&#8221; ask the residents of Cologne who take part in the protests, &#8220;if the feared Islamization of Turkey happens? Will DITIB bring it over here?&#8221;</p>
<p>Cologne&rsquo;s Archbishop Joachim Meisner is already warning people about of areas in Germany &#8220;where sharia law is increasingly spreading.&#8221; In the case of DITIB, this warning might be premature or simply inaccurate. At the same time, however, the association is remotely controlled from Ankara and has a reputation for being more concerned with helping to maintain the identity of Turkish immigrants than with helping them integrate in their new homes.</p>
<p>The worldview of Ahmadiyya, the organization that currently wants to build one of its planned 100 mosques in Berlin&rsquo;s northern Pankow district, also causes some unease. Every now and then, rumors escape the mosque walls claiming that many of the group&rsquo;s leaders consider not only women and Jews to be second-class citizens, but also homosexuals. In 2007, an Ahmadiyya Web site stated that the &#8220;increasing tendency toward homosexuality&#8221; could be traced to the consumption of pork.</p>
<p>Widespread protests against Ahmadiyya by residents of SchlÃ¼chtern in the western state of Hesse led the town to change its zoning laws so as to prevent a planned mosque that would have included minarets from being built. In other locations as well, politicians are becoming more and more inclined to use city-planning laws as a way of limiting or completely prohibiting dubious projects by questionable developers.</p>
<p>This is exactly what Bonn did when the city voted against the construction of a cultural center with minarets on the grounds that the project would further aggravate the &#8220;uncontested and ongoing formation of ghettos&#8221; in a specific Muslim-influenced neighborhood. In Munich, the city government rejected a proposed mosque project because its &#8220;disproportionate mass&#8221; would have allegedly impacted a square whose buildings are on historical-preservation lists.</p>
<p><b>Minarets &lsquo;By No Means Compulsory&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Cologne wants to prevent two associations from building a mosque in the district of MÃ¼lheim because they have contacts with the Islamic organization Milli GÃ¶rÃ¼s. Norbert Fuchs, the district&rsquo;s mayor, certainly sees it as a &#8220;problem (when) political questions are dealt with by using building ordinances.&#8221; For his part, though, Cologne&rsquo;s Deputy Mayor Guido Kahlen is convinced that: &#8220;In those cases where we have room for administrative discretion, we have to use it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seeing that this mindset appears to be catching on in other places, builders are apparently becoming more and more willing to exclude minarets from their architectural plans. As they see it, people living near these mosques view the minarets less as symbols of integration and more as demonstrations of power.</p>
<p>When Leggewie gives out advice, he says that mosques should be built without the classic soaring towers &mdash; on practical grounds. &#8220;As soon as a mosque differs from the look of the city around it through its &lsquo;foreign&rsquo; form,&#8221; Leggewie reasons, &#8220;you can count on greater resistance, which often necessitates more involved authorization procedures.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The traditional style underscores, even unintentionally,&#8221; Leggewie adds, &#8220;the orientation of Muslims toward the areas most important to Islam and toward their homelands.&#8221; And lastly, he points out, the Middle Eastern style of a mosque with minarets is &#8220;by no means compulsory.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, a counterexample is the mosque of the Turkish parliament in Ankara, built in 1989, which doesn&rsquo;t have minarets. And than there&rsquo;s a &#8220;mosque for the future&#8221; planned for London&rsquo;s East End. Plans for the mosque envision space for 70,000 worshippers in a high-tech structure with a glass roof instead of a dome and wind turbines instead of minarets.</p>
<p>For the proposed Ahmadiyya mosque in Hausen, near Frankfurt, architect Mubashra Ilyas has designed a simple building with &#8220;Bauhaus elements&#8221; and one symbolic minaret that people passing by can only see from a certain angle. As Ilyas explains it, this is &#8220;because it&rsquo;s certainly easier for native Germans living in the area to live with it that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>In any case, minarets are no longer needed for the muezzin&rsquo;s call. A call to prayer is redundant, according to Fazlur Rehman Anwar of the Ahmadiyya mosque in EimsbÃ¼ttel, Hamburg: &#8220;After all, there are watches.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the other hand, when Muslim builders with financial backers in the Middle East insist on enormous, showy multipurpose centers in Turkish or Arab style, they must accept a high degree of political risk. The openly Middle Eastern style may lead to a flare up in the already smoldering debate about religious freedom in the countries that back these projects financially, since some are countries in which Christians are violently persecuted and prevented from building churches.</p>
<p>Representatives of both the Catholic and Protestant churches in Germany continue to emphasize that they have in no way made their approval of mosque construction contingent on Muslim countries&rsquo; allowing Christians to build churches there. At the same time, however, they let it be known that they can&rsquo;t accept the status quo in the long run.</p>
<p>While Protestant Bishop Huber calls for &#8220;Muslims&rsquo; unrestricted right to convert,&#8221; his Catholic colleague Archbishop Meisner has appealed to the DITIB, who are building the mosque in Cologne, &#8220;to support a project in Turkey.&#8221; As Meisner explains: &#8220;The Pope has declared 2008 to be the Year of St. Paul (as) we are celebrating of the 2000th birthday of the apostle Paul. Yet at his birthplace in Tarsus, we Christians have nothing &hellip; We need to campaign to be allowed to build a pilgrim center and a small church there. In return, that would be taken into account here in Cologne.&#8221;</p>
<p>Less elegant than the cardinal&rsquo;s approach &mdash; which, admittedly, met with no success &mdash; is the direct method used by some representatives of the CDU. While representatives of the Christian Social Union (CSU) the CDU&rsquo;s Bavarian sister party, were satisfied with the stipulation that minarets could not rise higher than church steeples, local CDU members in Castrop-Rauxel, a city in western Germany, recently agreed to a disproportionately radical resolution on the topic.</p>
<p>Of course mosque construction should be allowed, the CDU members say, but land usage must be strictly restricted: &#8220;We suggest applying the standards that are in effect for the construction of new Christian religious buildings in Turkey.&#8221;<br>

			<p>Time is short for Europe. It&rsquo;s strange to think of all the historical battles, and invasions by Islam Christian Europe has fought, and yet now,the one world agenda,or whatever this clear ongoing conspiracy of the importation of millions of Moslems should be called  &mdash;  is threatening to destroy traditional Europe, forever.</p>

<p>Yes, the Europeans should simply &#8220;move somewhere else&#8221; if they don&rsquo;t like massive immigration.  </p>
<p>The populations in the Middle East and Africa are skyrocketing, and these oppressed people need to live somewhere.  Why not Europe?  Europeans should simply move out of their nations so that these millions and millions of oppressed foreigners can have a higher standard of living.  </p>

			<p>Nothing to say on Islam exactly. I would just like to reiterate my success in stopping the building of a Mc Mansion across the street from our home. I FOUGHT CITY HALL AND WON!! The council put me down verbally  for being &#8220;Strident&#8221; even as they gave me a 90 day moratorium. I don`t need to educate anyone   on what has happened to the economy or the housing market in the last  90 days. It was all the breather we needed for the uncaring developer to go bottom up and for me to still have my view and sunlight.   Not bragging, just telling those who care to fight a Section 8, Halfway House  or anything else that these fights can be won but they HAVE TO BE OPPOSED. I wouldn`t have believed it myself. Which makes the temporary meter going down and the For Sale sign going up that much sweeter! Even my neighbor said it made up for all my shortcomings&hellip;</p>

			<p>   I wouldn&rsquo;t concern myself with a parallel society, the muslims fully intend to wipe out the ethnic Germans and take over Germany. Islam must be stopped by all means available to the German people. And I do mean ALL means. Don&rsquo;t wait to be saved by your crooked government, they cannot and would not if they could. Same here in the states. </p>

			<p>It is one thing to have a small amount of &#8216;diversity&rsquo;, IE: 5 or 10% of a given population. It is quite another to have a non-native population childishly allowed to continue with its own ethnic identity outside of their native lands and becoming 20-30-40% of a given population. Childishness, Peter Pan, Liberalism, is great for wealthy, all-white countries. Its a pigskin boat, and it will float only as long as you can bail faster than you poke holes in it.  Perhaps we can look at the micro-environment to predict social breakdown. Once blacks become 35% or so of a given population, social kaos ensues. Minorites are 35% of American population, and we have no accountability in government, and a collapsing banking system. Natures laws cannot be avoided, can they?</p>

<p>Nowhere in the article is there any mention of a long term solution to the problem of Islamization.  Obviously, if they are not forced out of Europe, they will come to dominate it.  It&rsquo;s the question these timid fools refuse to debate.</p>

I am not sure where this was taken, but you can get the gist of it. A German businessman is conducting an interview about his business exchanges and holdings. About 15 seconds into the video he is confronted by a &ldquo;youth&rdquo; (Turk) who looks at the camera and calls someone other than the man an &ldquo;Altie.&rdquo; (Old person, probably referring to the interviewer, most likely a female). The businessman asks what is problem is. Needless to say, but the Turk gave the wrong answer.</p>

			<p>Imagine.  You are walking through a nice green meadow in Germany and then you look up and instead of seeing quaint village steeples over the horizon in front of snow-capped mountains, you see minarets.  This is disgusting.  Mosques have no place in Germany.</p>

			<p>The one advantage that Germany has over other white countries in the same predicament is that they have had the good sense (for the most part) not to make their non-white immigrants citizens.  And there is no birthright citizenship, so their offspring aren&rsquo;t citizens either.</p>
<p>Eventually, the American Empire will crumble, because America itself will have too many non-whites such that it won&rsquo;t be a first-world country.  Therefore, the American occupiers will leave Germany, leaving it free and independent again.  Once that happens, all those Turks and Muslims won&rsquo;t be long to stay.</p>

			<p>Never mind the mosques.</p>
<p>By now, one child out of three belongs to an ethnic minority in Germany (and unfortunately, they mostly aren&rsquo;t northeast Asians -that I personally wouldn&rsquo;t mind at all- or other Europeans either).</p>
<p>Being insulted by young Muslims simply for being German has become so commonplace it is accepted as a normal, minor nuisance.</p>
<p>The really disturbing part is the extreme and hitherto unknown degree of violence these people have introduced into our society. While the mainstream media like to stress and bloat even the most insignificant Neonazi-type incident, they routinely and deliberately ignore the most hideous crimes committed by immigrants for fear of causing public outrage. </p>
<p>(you hear about these incidents from friends and relatives, police officers(they usually aren&rsquo;t too fond of the current state of affairs), sometimes they make it into minor local papers, but only most rarely into the national ones)</p>
<p>Groups of mostly Turkish young men routinely seek out Germans as victims to beat up, rob or worse. </p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t see that this is primarily an issue of mosque-building: rather, the issue again seems to be one of unchecked immigration.  Who is building these mosques?  I doubt very much that it&rsquo;s being done by native Germans, who have suddenly been seized by an infatuation with Islam.  Rather it&rsquo;s the Islamic immigrants the Germans allowed into their country in too large of numbers.  Perhaps Germany opened its doors so wide, out of a need to atone for its Holocaust past, to get multicultural with the times and prove that it isn&rsquo;t a racist or xenophobic nation.  And how many Germans or other Europeans would be interested in reciprocating their own nation&rsquo;s generosity and  hoping for equal generosity from a fascist nation run by the Taliban, or taking up residence in a welcoming community where  women can&rsquo;t vote, drive or go outside without a male attendant, and may be stoned to death if someone rapes her?  </p>

&#8220;&hellip;the organization deliberately violated its building permits during the construction of a new mosque in the same neighborhood. By the time construction had been completed, the mosque&rsquo;s two minarets rose 37 meters into the Berlin skyline rather than the approved 28 meters and the dome measured around 22 meters instead of the permitted 18. For Vogelsang that was cause enough to slap the Muslim congregation with the highest fine ever imposed in her district, â¬100,000.&#8221; </p>
<p><br>
Although I&rsquo;m glad the Islamic invaders were hit with a big fine for doing this, what the local council should REALLY have done was to KNOCK THE THING DOWN. </p>
<p>Some of these Mohammedan orgs have massive, virtually limitless financing (usually from rich Saudi Wahhabi extremists), and even a large fine is as nothing to them. So the ONLY thing that would really teach them the necessary lesson   &mdash;   that they are highly suspect foreigners sitting on white Christian soil so they better watch their step   &mdash;   is to DEMOLISH any construction project of theirs that exceeds the dimensions dictated by the local Europeans. </p>
<p>Either that or refuse to let them build these hideous, frightening, nation-threatening monstrosities in the first place. <br>

			<p>I see an even more dire future for Germany if this situation is allowed to continue. I forsee a renewed interest in an extreme right wing nationalist movement. The ethnic German people&rsquo;s tolerance level will be reached and then all Hell will break loose in Germany. <br>
Check out the video at the High School and the attitude of the Turks. It&rsquo;s very similar to the attitude of our Blacks here. One declared that the Germans won&rsquo;t defened themselves because they&rsquo;re afraid. Their attitude toward education is also quite similar. Not going to class, disruption of classes etc.  They use the excuse that there is no chance for a job so that their future will be burglary, assault and rape. <br>
We in the West have gotten our young men so &#8221; in touch with their feminine side&#8221; that they&rsquo;ve lost the will to defend themselves.</p>

<p>Yes - even leftwing publications are increasingly under pressure to acknowledge there is resistance to the islamisation of Europe. But note how author BÃ¶lsche refers to all critics as &#8220;xenophobes&#8221; and rightwing &#8220;extremists&#8221; (&#8220;e.g. extreme right anti&hellip;)</p>
<p>The only problem Der Spiegel sees with all this mosque-building is that in their view, it&rsquo;ll increase the divide between Germans and migrants, based on the false assumption that successful integration is possible. </p>
<p>Der Spiegel isn&rsquo;t worth the paper it&rsquo;s printed on, and so is most of our press when it comes to immigration.</p>
<p>I am convinced that everywhere, be it the US, Germany, France or the UK, the media are the major culprit. They decide what our politicians can and cannot say and mislead the largely sheepish public. </p>

			<p>I lived for six years in Germany, and while I am neither German or Christian, I find the idea of huge mega-mosques a blight on the beauty of the country. I loved Germany; it was my home. I respected the culture and the people of my host country. I find it disgusting that other foreigners cannot understand this basic concept, which is a necessity for harmony and peaceful relationships. Though my German was poor, I spent every year there learning the language and progressing in my understanding of the history and people there. Germans initially thought I was a Turk when meeting me, because of my swarthy and Asiatic looks, and treated me with some hostility, but the majority of them, once they saw my respectfulness and willingness to engage them in their language, were very friendly and welcoming to me. </p>
<p>Germany is a fantastic country and I left there shortly after reunification. It breaks my heart to constantly read about these problems with the Turks which were already beginning to fester at the time of my departure. The Turks, for the most part, do not respect Germany&rsquo;s culture nor its people. They were trouble makers in my time there and I can only imagine what their increased numbers has wrought on the country.</p>

			<p>That seems like an astoundingly truthful article, even for one intended for mass consumption.</p>
<p>- It acknowledges that the native German people have very valid claims and fears about the building of instruments of religious supremacy - property values, parking, noise, etc</p>
<p>- It recognises that in most instances the existing residents are entirely left out of the building process, all proceedings are carried out behind closed doors, and the venture is rushed through before anyone can do anything about it in a breathtaking display of arrogance</p>
<p>- It acknowledges that there is a continuing push for Islamic religious domination via massive funding from the Islamic world, and claims of donations and no-strings attached monies are blatant frauds</p>
<p>- It reveals that the massive building enterprise further decreases any possible Muslim integration into society</p>
<p>Clear, refreshing, informative.  And there is nothing in the article that can be contrued as &#8220;racism&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Maybe a simple but effective solution would be acceptable both to native German people AND Muslims: LET THE MUSLIMS RETURN TO THEIR COUNTRIES OF ORIGIN!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure the Germans would not be loath to see them leave. While the Muslims would be free (and welcome) to build all the mosques they want in their own lands.</p>
<p>Minorities like Muslims would be better advised to address the enormous percentage of immigrant-perpetrated CRIME in Germany and other European nations. That&rsquo;s correct: CRIME BY MUSLIMS, AFRICANS, PAKISTANIS, TURKS, HINDUS.</p>
<p>One can only hope the German people (along with the rest of Europe) are finally waking out of their torpor. All good phrases and political speeches aside, people want to, SHOULD live, surrounded by their own kind. Third-world immigrants simply do not belong in White European nations.</p>

			<p>@ Question Diversity (9:30 PM on July 21):</p>
<p>Unfortunately this was changed a few years ago. <br>
The &#8220;ius sanguinis&#8221; was practically abolished so that we have more of a &#8220;ius solis&#8221; in Germany.</p>
<p>Only illegal immigrants are excluded from the birthright, at least in theory. In reality illegal immigrant children born in Germany usually acquire German citizenship on &#8220;humanitarian&#8221; grounds.</p>
<p>As a German I have to say that many Germans are very angry that the government has the flagrance to officialy label these people &#8220;German&#8221;. But on the other hand there are unfortunately a lot of Germans who absolutely do not care.</p>
<p>To ensure the compliance of the population the federal and provincial governments have started a massive propaganda campaign consisting web-based, TV-spots in the TV, radio broadcasts and large advertising posters in the streets, displaying slogans that glorify diversity.</p>
<p>This is not done in a subtle way but rather blunt and in-your-face:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bundesregierung.de/Content/DE/Fotoreihe/2007/2007-07-13-Kampagne-Integration/kampagne-krankenschwester,property=poster.jpg" rel="nofollow">https://www.bundesregierung.de/Content/DE/Fotoreihe/2007/2007-07-13-Kampagne-Integration/kampagne-krankenschwester,property=poster.jpg</a></p>
<p>https://www.bundesregierung.de/Content/DE/Fotoreihe/2007/2007-07-13-Kampagne-Integration/kampagne-integration,item=4,layoutVariant=FotoreiheSA.html</p>
<p>These campaigns are sponsored directly from the federal government, but many propaganda or immigrant-support programs exist on the communal level or from the churchs.<br>
The &#8220;conservative&#8221; parties CDU and CSU have traditionally supported immigration to Germany, despite talking otherwise to the gullible German voters.<br>
For example the &#8220;state secretary of integration&#8221; is a CDU-politian. As is chancellor Angela Merkel who approved of the faustian &#8220;Mediterranian Union&#8221; just a few day ago.</p>
<p>Although immigration from Turkey is ongoing, they make up for &#8220;only&#8221; 25 percent of the Non-German immigrants. There are about 3,5 million Turks (of which 1 mill. are citizens) of about 15 million non-Germans (or decendents of foreigners) in total.</p>
<p>Recent nonwhite immigration is largely from northern and southern Africa, Turkey, Iraq, India, Pakistan, China and Vietnam.<br>
This is contrasted with a ridiculously low birthrate of the indigenous Germans (about 1 birth per woman).<br>
The higher official birthrate of 1,4 birhts/woman is misleading because it includes legal alien residents and naturalized non-Germans.</p>
<p>As a faithful observer of the situation in my country, I have to admit that a future solution will be very unpleasant because the government is happily hiring non-European foreigners to work in our administration, police and army. <br>
It is a Yugoslavia in the making. <br>
A big mess.</p>

			<p>In the post-WWII period, Germans had a massive load of guilt dumped on them. The result being the German people are so hopelessly BRAINWASHED, that even if they do see the truth (about immigration), they&rsquo;re afraid to open their mouths. For fear of being deemed racists. </p>
<p>The pandering political leaders of German compounded the crime, by passing idiotic laws prohibiting criticism of immigrants or even questioning the legitimacy of immigration.

			<p>&#8220;The planned construction of over 180 mosques in Germany is mobilizing right-wing xenophobes&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>You mean, ordinary European Whites?</p>
<p>Why does rhetoric like this make me want to raise my right arm, and shout &#8216;Sieg Heil&rsquo;&hellip;not like it is totalitarian rhetoric, or anything&hellip;..</p>

			<p>&#8220;It would have been perfectly fine if the illegally erected minarets had been &ldquo;a little bit bigger,&rdquo; a reporter overheard in the mosque. Another congregation member complained that &ldquo;every mosque in Turkey&rdquo; is bigger. &ldquo;They must be laughing themselves silly at us,&rdquo; he grumbled.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Thus is captured the Islamic psyche in a nutshell.  &#8220;Mosque envy.&#8221;  </p>
<p>These huge mosques are nothing more than a statement of domination.  That&rsquo;s the fundamental impetus of Muslim fanatics, isn&rsquo;t it?  Domination over females, domination over other religions, domination over countries, continents, the entire globe&hellip;</p>

			<p>Germany is ruled by the same clique of international financier elites and traitors that America, Canada and Europe are ruled by. They fully intend to swamp us with third worlders and allow them to rob, rape and murder us out of existence. </p>
<p>Once Whites have been eliminated these elites will have a world of low IQ serfs and welfare dependents to rule over in perpetuum. </p>
<p>This is the &#8220;New World Order&#8221; in a nutshell.</p>

			<p>The massive protest against the proposed mosque in Heinersdorf was inspirational - the protesters&rsquo; procession went on and on - even critics admitted it was a huge demonstration of opposition. It is incredible that such wide popular feeling had no effect on the ruling PC liberals. What do Europeans have to do to halt the fast-growing Islamisation of Europe when mass protests are ignored and the main parties are complicit in the destructive multiculturalism developing in all our countries.</p>

			<p>Yes, the Europeans should simply &ldquo;move somewhere else&rdquo; if they don&rsquo;t like massive immigration. </p>
<p>The populations in the Middle East and Africa are skyrocketing, and these oppressed people need to live somewhere. Why not Europe? Europeans should simply move out of their nations so that these millions and millions of oppressed foreigners can have a higher standard of living. </p>

<p>Maybe the Germans would understand that the 3rd world Muslims need &#8216;Lebenstraum&#8221; this little word caused a lot of trouble in the 30s, why not now for the Muslims doing it to Europe. Muslims should be run out of ALL civilized countries and their Mosques torn down before it  is to late. No percentage of Muslims should be allowed since, remember, the Nazis were able to subjegate all of Europe because they were willing to commit wholesale violence just as the Muslims are doing now and people will cower before it</p>

			<p>&ldquo;We suggest applying the standards that are in effect for the construction of new Christian religious buildings in Turkey.&rdquo;<br>
_______</p>
<p>Maybe better would be the standards for building a church in Saudi Arabia - none allowed.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Eventually, the American Empire will crumble, because America itself will have too many non-whites such that it won&rsquo;t be a first-world country. Therefore, the American occupiers will leave Germany, leaving it free and independent again. Once that happens, all those Turks and Muslims won&rsquo;t be long to stay.&#8221;</p>
<p>With Europe&rsquo;s economy growing faster than ours and the rise of the euro, they&rsquo;ll leave us in the dust long before we become a minority in the US.  We&rsquo;re in such a sad state of affairs that all Europe has to do is stop loaning us money to finance our military. The Cold War has been over for a generation now yet why do we still have troops in Europe, Japan and Korea?  These places are more than capable to taking care of themselves.  Having an American presence in Europe that soon will consist mostly of black and Mexican troops seems ludicrous and will seem ludicrous to Europeans.   </p>
