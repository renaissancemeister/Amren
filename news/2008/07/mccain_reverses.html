						<p>ABC News&rsquo; Teddy Davis and Kevin Kilbane Report: During a &#8220;This Week&#8221; interview with ABC News&rsquo; George Stephanopoulos John McCain reversed himself on affirmative action and endorsed for the first time a proposed state ballot measure which would end race and gender-based affirmative action in his home state of Arizona.</p>
<p>&#8220;I support it,&#8221; McCain declared when asked about the referendum. &#8220;I do not believe in quotas.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have not seen the details of some of these proposals. But I&rsquo;ve always opposed quotas.&#8221;</p>
<p>McCain has long opposed quotas but his new support for ending affirmative action programs which stop short of quotas puts him at odds not only with Democratic rival Barack Obama but also with the Arizona senator&rsquo;s own views in 1998.</p>
<p>Back then, when the legislature in McCain&rsquo;s home state of Arizona considered sending the voters a measure to end affirmative action, McCain spoke out against it calling it &#8220;divisive.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>McCain&rsquo;s critics on the left charge that he has changed his position on affirmative action in order to shore up his support among conservatives.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is clearly an election-year flip flop and a pander to a skeptical right-wing base,&#8221; said John Kraus, spokesman for the liberal Ballot Initiative Strategy Center. &#8220;He has put politics first on this issue. There is no other way around it.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ward Connerly, the affirmative action foe behind the Arizona and other state measures in Nebraska and Colorado, told ABC News last month that McCain was missing an opportunity to draw a sharp contrast with Obama.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The presumptive Democratic nominee has spoken in favor of developing income-based affirmative action programs. But he also supports maintaining race-based affirmative action programs and has come out against the proposed Arizona ballot measure ending affirmative action. He has also come out against an identical measure which has qualified for the ballot in Colorado as well as one that has been proposed in Nebraska.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Here is McCain&rsquo;s exchange with Stephanopoulos:</p>
<p>STEPHANOPOULOS: &#8220;Opponents of affirmative action are trying to get a referendum on the ballot here that would do away with affirmative action. Do you support that?&#8221;</p>
<p>MCCAIN: &#8220;Yes, I do. I do not believe in quotas. But I have not seen the details of some of the proposals. But I&rsquo;ve always opposed quotas.&#8221;</p>
<p>STEPHANOPOULOS: &#8220;But the one here in Arizona you support?&#8221;</p>
<p>McCAIN: &#8220;I support it, yes.&#8221;<br>

			<p>McCain&rsquo;s meanderings may lose him the election if he cannot turn out conservative whites and scare moderate whites away from Obama. His &#8220;support&#8221; for this initiative seems tepid and murky as used dishwater. If he ends up fumbling this issue and the myriad of others he might exploit against BHO, it will be his own doing. If it so happens, then we can hope the GOP learns from it and has a Goldwater or Reagan moment, thus opening a new path to victory. A path where whites can safely walk.</p>

<p>If I had someone come to an interview with a normal name but was a non-white, my response would be:  Thank You for coming in!</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t hire those who rely on Affirmative Action in the first place, you should be okay.  That and keeping your company private so the Government cannot force you to hire incompetents.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The presumptive Democratic nominee has spoken in favor of developing income-based affirmative action programs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ten years after giving a lower-income person a job over someone with a higher income, then, you stitch back, fire the beneficiary, and hire the rejected candidate, because the guy who didn&rsquo;t get the job has a lower income the the person who did? Of course the person who didn&rsquo;t get the job is no longer trained and qualified in his presumptive field. I wonder how this type of affirmative action works out in all-white countries, all black ones, or all Asian or hispanic one? I wouldn&rsquo;t say income based (income of the parents presumably) AA couldn&rsquo;t work but I do think the ones proposing this in the USA are basically trying to discriminate against whites and that is where and how it would be/is implemented.  </p>
<p>My own opinion, and I&rsquo;ve said this on here before, is that affirmative action helping non-whites who grow up poor - basically because of discrimination against white men in the first place&hellip; will only end when white men are denied &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo;, too. Once white men are denied affirmative action the whole hate whitey train will seriously begin to slow down in earnest.</p>
<p>We read a lot of doom and gloom scenarios but I do think this eventuality will turn our nation around. There&rsquo;s a lot of room for that, for sure. Eventually non-whites may bring the nonsense back by show of force, Mugabe style. Hopefully before then whites will have seriously considered white nationalism. </p>

			<p>How better to ensure the Black man artificially wins again than by ensuring his opponent is one of the worst possible White<br>
candidates? This is another egregious example of the affirmative action process; the advancement of Blacks by the imposed restraint of Whites. It&rsquo;s happened for decades in the education system.</p>
<p>The clever guise of McCain&rsquo;s staged candidacy represents the apex of the affirmative action charade for the Left and corporate America. How better to defeat conservatism than to thrust in a non-conservative like McCain, thus stacking the deck firmly against Conservatives and in favor of Liberals and minorites.</p>
<p>The fact is that McCain is very old, not in full control of his faculties any more, prone to diseases such as skin cancer, not an effective communicator, not especially intelligent, prone to emotional outburts like many grumpy old men, supportive of illegals, and he&rsquo;s happy to be in bed with Liberals. This staged election proves everything sinister that I have ever suspected about the government, the election process, and the nation. </p>
<p>All of this makes me despise taxes more than ever.</p>

			<p>This GOP oaf may yet stumble into the presidency. If he does, do not expect any changes in affirmative action. In other words, expect more of what we got from Curious George, Bush I, Ronald &#8220;Mr. Conservative&#8221; Reagan, Nixon &hellip;etc.</p>

			<p>&#8220;But I&rsquo;ve always opposed quotas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>McCain has been in Congress for thirty years and never did anything to ban quotas because he has always supported quotas.<br>
I don&rsquo;t know who has more contempt for whites, Obama or McCain.<br>
The people of Arizona are obviously as unfit morally as the Catholics in Massachusetts. <br>

			<p>Its too late McCain. Too late to rush to the lifeboat and reap our votes. We see you for what you truly are, a Minority-pandering leftist photo copy of Jorge Boosh. I&rsquo;ve no doubt in my mind if you got into office, suddenly you wouldn&rsquo;t be against AA. Suddenly, 12million+ illegals would magically become citizens under your rule. While Obama is no better, at least he doesn&rsquo;t hide it.</p>

McCain looked good in that interview.  I was thinking about Jared Taylor&rsquo;s recent characterization of him the whole time, and thought that McCain can come off much better than the &#8220;old, out of touch&#8221; image that has been expressed by many people.</p>
<p>And .  .  . hey, look .  .  . he takes a position we like. Maybe Amren people can vote Republican this year after all.</p>

			<p>Well, here&rsquo;s one reason to vote for him besides the concern about Supreme Court appointments.  Maybe he&rsquo;ll do an &#8220;about face&#8221; on immigration and the war, too.  Right, and maybe he&rsquo;ll pick Tom Tancredo, Ron Paul, or Pat Buchanan as a running mate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still not ready to hand the throne over to Obama yet just because the media has ordained it or Jared Taylor has resigned himself to the eerie inevitability.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s all contact the McCain campaign and see if we can&rsquo;t talk some more sense into him.     </p>

Like all the neocons, for most of his career McCain has sided with the Left not only affirmative action, but also immigration.  He is a fraud.   Vote for Chuck Baldwin.</p>
<p>The real question we whites should be asking ourselves is:</p>
<p>(1) Unlike all other races, why have whites lost any sense of tribalism?</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>(2) What can be done to regain any sense of tribalism.</p>
<p></p>

<p>Indeed. His left wing critics are correct. But is there any doubt that McCain will say absolutely anything as long as it is to his benefit? We saw that with his flip flopping stance on illegal immigration, and then the return to his pro-illegal alien stance once he had secured the nomination.</p>

			<p>McCain, the maverick, enjoyed all the press he got from the MSM by sticking his thumb in the eyes of conservatives.  However, now he is shocked, shocked, that his old buddies at the MSM are sticking it to him.  So, he is tacking back to the right as fast as he can.  AND, it looks like I&rsquo;m back again to the lesser of two bozos situation.    And after looking at my options, this is clearly another election where I have to hold my nose and reluctantly vote for the old flipper, Amnesty John. </p>

At his rate, long before he makes up his mind and starts to court those citizens who could make him win the presidency, Obama will have clinched it. He&rsquo;s so hopeless.</p>

			<p>This is how McCain portrays himself as the lesser of two evils. It&rsquo;s his one redeemable quality, however insincere it may be. He is basically begging the conservative base not to waste its vote on an independent. I say &#8220;Too little, too late amigo!&#8221;</p>

			<p>This is a nice piece of news, but I get the gut feeling McCain&rsquo;s found religion on affirmative action because of pressure from real patriots within the GOP, not because of any deeply-felt principle.  If McCain could, he&rsquo;d ignore all of our calls to oppose affirmative action.  Which is all the more reson for us to keep the heat on. </p>

			<p>McCain realizes the black vote will go to Obama. Now he is trying to fool the true conservatives into voting for him. I&rsquo;m not fooled by it, and I doubt many others are either. But then again the average person running around loose on the streets is a fool.</p>
<p>I intend to go to the polls and leave the selection for President blank. There are no acceptable candidates running. Trying to figure who is the lesser of the evils, is still a vote for evil.</p>
<p>The rulers (they would deceive us and say elected representatives) like to say they enjoy the support of the citizenry. If many would leave that choice blank, it would send the signal that we are not happy with the way things are, or who they have put forth. It is a real vote for change.</p>

			<p>Anonymous at 7:06 has it right.  McCain&rsquo;s candidacy is obviously not meant to be taken seriously.  He&rsquo;s nothing but a prop to help guarantee that Obama becomes the next president.  Since he&rsquo;s very old, meanders and is clearly extinct, I hereby dub him &#8220;Meanderthal Man&#8221;.</p>

			<p>I will vote for McCain just to vote against Obama. What we voters must take into account, and I hear very little on this subject, is the person each candidate chooses as a VP running mate. McMain&rsquo;s for obvious reasons, and Obama&rsquo;s because he may choose one such as Farakhan or at least with those types of leanings, which will seriously bear bad tidings for the white race in America. As Always, Weapons are our friends.</p>

			<p>McCain is a man who doesn&rsquo;t believe anything at all.  He&rsquo;ll say anything, except why we should actually want him as President.  His repeated, profane verbal abuse of other elected officials makes him sound like he is suffering from Tourette&rsquo;s Syndrome.  </p>
<p>I simply can not wait to order some good movies from Amazon dot com to watch instead of the debates.  The debates will consist of Hussein uttering glittering vagueries about &#8220;moving foreward&#8221; while McShamnesty won&rsquo;t know what to say, since debates are not scripted.</p>
<p>If I were your President, I would veto every foreign aid bill that reached my desk, and even with veto-override majority votes, I could still order the money impounded and left unspent.  I would order ICE to stop processing all H-1b visa applications.  I would de-recognize diplomatic immunity for UN officials and their families.  I would withold all federal funds from any &#8220;sanctuary city&#8221; via impoundment of the funds.</p>
<p>I honestly don&rsquo;t know what to do about the speculation in stocks, real-estate and now commodities that keep producing inflation balloons.  A responsible government fiscal policy couldn&rsquo;t hurt.  I suspect this financial mess is the free market attempting to adjust to artificial distortions in it, with more &#8220;money&#8221; than ever in circulation.  Intervention in the free market helped produce the real-estate mess in the first place.</p>
<p>I am not charismatic, and would have trouble leading sailors into a brothel.  Perhaps the US is not ready for an ex-con with a Japanese wife as President, but if this election produces the results you want, either way, please tell me in four years.  I&rsquo;d be interested in hearing how you aren&rsquo;t sick of rice, noodles and potatoes by then.</p>

			<p>McCain could actually come out winning this thing if he manages to engage in a Secret Sailer Strategy.  And he may just want it bad enough to win.  While there&rsquo;s an understanding between the parties to stay elitist on immigration and race quotas, maybe the GOP will have to go populist on at least one issue to avoid extinction.</p>

<p>I agree with that. That is the problem and without clear understanding and unity behind the problem we are tilting. We must be consistent in identity and argument. we also must be unwavering in our assault and in defanging and belittling all criticisms of this central theme. We have the power to do this.</p>

			<p>It would certainly be refreshing if we could, just for once, believe anything that our politicians say.  But it is an election year and as we have all seen with B. Hussein Obama, they will do anything to be elected.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s election isn&rsquo;t even a case of voting for the lesser of two evils.  Both candidates are socialists and I will not vote for a socialist, under any circumstances.  </p>
<p>If John McCain hadn&rsquo;t aligned himself with the likes of Teddy Kennedy, although with some misgivings, I would have voted for him.  </p>

			<p>McCain no longer has a chance, and his lies about quotas are an admission.</p>
<p>I would rather have Obama as President than McCain.  I do not believe congenital liar McCain has any chance of winning, and moreover, I do not even care.  McCain does not deserve to win.</p>
<p>For endorsing shamnesty, the GOP deserves to have its behind righteously kicked until it is too sore to sit down for four years.</p>
<p>I am almost ready to never vote GOP again, ever, for the rest of my life, when I have almost never voted anything but GOP until now.</p>
<p>The one issue I voted about - gun rights - has been definitively ruled on by the US Supreme Court, so I really don&rsquo;t care anymore about which branch of the US Socialist Party gets to play with the Big Electric Train Set.  The Good Guys won that decision, and whether the McManchurian McCandidate or the Obamanation wins this election is irrelevant.</p>
<p>My only hope is that we get to put Shrubya to trial for perjury, treason and murder after he is no longer President.  The US used to be the greatest nation in the world, and it may be again, if we are allowed to hang an ex-President in civilian clothes.  It would hurt me if we had to farm the job out to the Hague War Crimes Court.</p>

			<p>Problem, these referendums never work for 3 reasons.</p>
<p>(1) Federal law supersedes state and local law and federal requires that whites cannot be hired or admitted to colleges.  There is no way to get around this.  Fighting it will just result in losing the case after spending millions in legal fees.</p>
<p>(2) There are no enforcement provisions written in and a law that cannot be enforced is a dead letter.</p>
<p>(3) The same vicious white hating feminazis and non whites still run all the HR departments especially in government and they will not hire whites because of discrimination, hatred and the federally mandated ethnic cleansing of whites program that has been so successful.</p>
<p>Vote for the proposition, but don&rsquo;t expect any relief from affirmative action because you won&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>10 years after California&rsquo;s prop 209 went into effect there are fewer whites in government work and admitted to college than in 1996 when prop 209 first appeared on the ballot.  </p>
<p>Our government and elites hate us and want us gone. Denying us employment is their major weapon.  Without jobs we cannot marry and have children. With jobs and welfare non whites can afford to have lots and lots of children.  We are forty years into the ethnic cleansing of whites and it is working quite well.</p>
<p>If America had a Siberian gulag, we would have all been loaded on trains and dumped there 40 years ago.</p>

			<p>John McCain really is a weak candidate. Now he is changing his positions to make Conservative Voters believe he is the lesser of two evils. I don&rsquo;t believe they will fall for the GOP and their tricks in the general election.</p>

			<p>This &#8220;change&#8221; is as phony as McCain&rsquo;s claimed &#8220;change&#8221; on immigration policy. It&rsquo;s the sort of &#8220;change&#8221; a child undergoes while trying to wheedle money out of a parent - absolutely empty of sincerity, honesty, or resolve.</p>
<p>The only candidate out there even remotely worthy of a vote is Libertarian Bob Barr. He won&rsquo;t win, but this time around, given the two media-establishment-rigged candidates, the only honorable vote will be a protest vote.</p>

			<p>Don&rsquo;t listen to those people urging you to vote for Chuck Baldwin.  I agree with his views and if Clinton had won the nomination, I most certainly would vote for him, but not now.  Voting for him now is a vote for Obama.  I suspect some of you people out there are Obamamaniacs who are just starting to realize there&rsquo;s a tidal wave of White voters that are going to carry McCain into the White House.  </p>

			<p>Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s article this month &#8220;Why Obama Will Win&#8221; (and I agree 100%), is right on target that the Republicans have nominated the least attractive candidate.  </p>
<p>Elections in this country, especially the presidential ones, have become a serious problem, I hate to say joke because what&rsquo;s happening in this country is no joke.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t help but believe that President Bush has done so much damage to the Republican Party during his 8 years in office.  I have been sorely disappointed in him.  </p>

			<p>To everyone who continues to tout Chuck Baldwin and Ron Paul, let me remind you that I was once completely onboard with Pat Buchanan. </p>
<p>Years ago, Pat was rolling along nicely, attracting a good, grass-roots level of White supporters, talking the language of White nationalists and realists when he suddenly made the bizarre decision to select a Black woman as his running mate!</p>
<p>Ron Paul was on a similar course with White nationalists and realists this year until he commented negatively about one of his White campaign contributors in Florida. Amazing! I stopped supporting Paul that same day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m waiting to see if Chuck Baldwin has the courage to stand up to say &#8220;I am here to represent White people, their rights, and to protect our heritage as White Americans.&#8221; Any candidate who has the courage to say that, or at least not cower down when the press applies heat like Ron Paul did, will have my vote.</p>
<p>So far, only David Duke has had that type of courage. The rest are gutless losers as far as I&rsquo;m concerned.</p>

			<p>McCain is an first class jerk.  He is arrogant, rich, spoiled and a traitor to his country  &mdash;  his recent reverses on affirmative action and illegal immigration and increased taxes, and the list goes on are pathetic pandering meant solely for consumption by republicans and conservative independents in the upcoming presidential election.  There, I have said what I think about Juan McCain.</p>
<p>Obama on the other hand is the closest thing to true &#8220;evil&#8221; that we have had as a presidential candidate in living memory.  Obama makes McCain look like George Washington, he is that horribly bad.</p>
<p>  He too has been changing his positions for &#8220;change&#8221; in direct step with the latest popular polls.  But just ask yourself this when comparing two horrible candidates: which candidate would likely make it a major priority once elected to effectively repeal the 2nd amendment?  </p>
<p>There is only one answer to that question, viz. Obama.  The evil that he could and would likely do makes McCain&rsquo;s sickening liberalism pail by comparison.  Imagine Obama in the white house with a Democratic congress  &mdash;  Just close your eyes for a moment and imagine this in January.  How long would it take for an individual who never served in the military, who has most likely never fired a weapon of any kind and firmly believe no matter what he says that only &#8220;military and police should be allowed to possess firearms, and then mostly in an unloaded condition as otherwise they might hurt someone&#8221;, who views the bill of rights as a quaint piece of historical &#8220;Americana&#8221; written by evil, viciously racist, white males  &mdash;  how long do you think it would take him to join with such morons as Nancy Pelosi and Feinstein and New York mayor Blumberg to pass federal legislation which would outlaw the possession of firearms by ordinary citizens?  </p>
<p>My guess is that it would take about 6 months.  Such legislation would gut the 2nd amendment and never forget that the one amendment to the US Constitution upon which all the others rest is the 2nd amendment.  That is one thing that I cannot imagine even the pathetic Senator McCain ever doing. </p>
<p> Think about it for a moment before simply saying as I have often done in the last months that there is no difference between the candidates.  The truth is that there actually is and it is a huge difference.  We simply cannot allow Obama to become president of the United States.  McCain may be an arrogant SOB in bed with the open borders lobby and congressional Democrats on several issues, but he is not in bed with the anti-gun Dems or with  anti-gun lunatics like Obama and his gang. </p>
<p> That is the one and only reason that I plan on bitting the bullet and voting for him in November.  While he personally makes me sick, the alternative is simply too horrible to imagine. </p>
<p> There are certainly many other reasons to vote against Obama, scores of very good reasons especially for white Americans, but while Obama can do many outrageous things, like ramping up the racial spoils system, demanding and obtaining reparations for blacks, opening what remains of our borders to terrorists and other third world underclasses  &mdash;  none of these things will immediately destroy our country.  </p>
<p>However, if he succeeds (and such is very likely) in effectively repealing the 2nd amendment, he will have totally destroyed this nation by finally eliminating the very possibility of any meaningful resistance to the government by us,  the American people.  Such would truly be the end of America.</p>
<p>Sadly, this puts us all in the position of being duty bound to hold our collective noses and go out and vote for Obama&rsquo;s opponent, regardless of what a sleaze he is personally and politically.  </p>

			<p>McCain did graduate last in his class at West Point, so what, he didn&rsquo;t necessarily study because his dad and granddad guaranteed his future.  Doesn&rsquo;t mean he&rsquo;s stupid. It&rsquo;s still one of the top universities in the world.  Is he the lesser of 2 evils, absolutely and that is the only reason you need to vote for him. &hellip;Posted by margaret at 1:21 PM on July 29: &#8220;10 years after California&rsquo;s prop 209 went into effect there are fewer whites in government work and admitted to college than in 1996 when prop 209 first appeared on the ballot.&#8221;&hellip; <br>
But that doesn&rsquo;t mean it didn&rsquo;t have any effect.  White and Asian enrolement at the top universities jumped dramatically and decreased at the community college level.  While the reverse happened with the black population.  The top positions in government went to qualified people (white and Asian), and less blacks.  You can&rsquo;t look at the absolute numbers because they will stay the same.  A qualified white person who didn&rsquo;t get into Stanford because of Afirmative Action still goes to school, but a less prestigious one.  The reverse happened with blacks once prop 209 was enacted, the black student who doesn&rsquo;t now get into Berkeley, still goes to school, but a local community college.  So absolute numbers can be misleading. </p>

<p>Agreed, but that attitude needs to go farther. I urge everyone to boycott <i>all</i> federal races (President and Congress), as I started doing in 2002. The sole purpose of government is to safeguard our God-given rights. Any government that fails to do so   &mdash;   or worse, actively destroys our rights, as the federal Leviathan does   &mdash;   is by definition illegitimate. Any vote, even for a 3rd party candidate, indicates your stamp of approval for that illegitimate government.</p>
<p>Of course, if you are fortunate enough to have Ron Paul or Tom Tancredo as your US House member, you should put the above advice aside <i>for that race only</i>. They are the only ones who take their oath of office seriously, and are therefore the only legitimate members of the federal government.</p>

			<p>The outlawing of firearms by the Omanation will never happen.  The US Supreme Court finally heard a 2nd Amendment case this spring, and ruled that the right to keep and bear arms is an individual right.  This was probably the most important decision in a century.</p>
