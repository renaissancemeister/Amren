			<p>Judging by the same standards, it look like McCain is not changing any minds either.  Last poll I saw showed Obama getting 93% of the black vote with McCain getting a whopping 4%.  I don&rsquo;t know who the other 3% were.  </p>

			<p>  Appears that the pollsters consider the blacks more important than the Whites, as they almost always put the results of polling blacks first, then those of the Whites. Also, the poll shows who REALLY won&rsquo;t vote for a candidate of another race, when given the option of voting for one of their own: The blacks, obviously. Why was no mention of that as being significant made by the writers?</p>
<p>  I also view as dubious the statement that Obama holds such a huge edge among Hispanics.  Given the racial clashes and general bad feeling which have cropped up between Hispanics and blacks in the bigger cities in the last few years, that sounds to me as if the pollsters somehow had their tumb on the scales to try to make McCain&rsquo;s chances look practically nil. One should always be suspicious of polls taken by news organizations which have a big vested interest in the success of one of the two sides   &mdash;   such as this one. </p>

<p>Couldn&rsquo;t have anything to do with the fact he attends a racist church, headed by his racist, egomaniacal, hate spewing mentor Jeremiah Wright, could it? Or maybe his racist, whitey hating, chip-on-my-shoulder wife Michelle is to blame?  No wait- maybe it is whitey&rsquo;s fault since we refuse to stop clinging to God and guns, out of our sheer paranoia and bitterness.  </p>

			<p>Look let&rsquo;s be honest. Why would an affirmative action empowered guy with his affirmative action empowered wife, impress rational Americans of other races as being leaders in taking Americans towards a &#8220;colorblind&#8221; society. If it was a black man who man his own way, and was seen to be and honest and upright person, well maybe that would be different. Only liberal Democratic  morons and weak, submissive Americans looking for a savior would vote for Obama, considering everything that is known about him.</p>

			<p>Anyone who can slog thru barackobama.com will see that his &#8220;program&#8221; is a vast income transfer program from employerd whites to unemployed blacks, blacks in jobs that are low paid because they were too lazy or too stupid to do well in school, or to illegal immigrants. Obama cannot have enough illegal immigrants in this country. He might be surprised his &#8220;brothers&#8221; don&rsquo;t love Mexicans or Central Americans all that much, but since he is a creature of Columbia and Harvard he doesn&rsquo;t know that.</p>

			<p>If, after all these many years, there is no &#8216;significant improvement&rsquo; in race-relations, then is it not obvious that integrationism has failed because it isn&rsquo;t quite right or natural?</p>
<p>If the races were really interchangeable and had natural and true affinity for each other, the race problem would have disappeared long ago.<br>
That it persists is only evidence that black and white don&rsquo;t really mix.</p>
<p>Whenever man fights Nature, the results are always deadly.</p>
<p>For race-liberals, race-relations won&rsquo;t be &#8216;improved&rsquo; until there are no more races.</p>

			<p>Obama isn&rsquo;t closing the racial divide as much as expected&hellip; .</p>
<p>which translates to: VOTE FOR OBAMA OR BE CONSIDERED A HOPELESS RACIST!</p>
<p>If McAmnesty could be persuaded to step aside on health/age related issues&hellip; If the presidential candidacy were handed to, say, Romney&hellip; It wouldn&rsquo;t even be a fight to defeat Obama. If would be virtually child&rsquo;s play. Given the ONLY lead Obama has over McCain is that McCain is widely perceived to be a McClone of G.W.B.</p>

<p>This is abjectly laughable!</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is, most blacks in this country will not see &#8220;evidence of significant improvement in race relations,&#8221; until whites are all exterminated (either through miscegenation, genocidal massacres, or a combination of the two) by them. They are an utterly failed race, who constantly compare themselves to whites and find themselves lacking; these two factors combine, to form a fantasy mindset of endless &#8220;racist&#8221; persecutions by their racial superiors, that explained away their social pathologies and technological/economic disparities, when compared to whites. </p>
<p>Murder someone and get a death sentence, its &#8220;racism;&#8221;</p>
<p>Show up to a job interview dressed like an unkempt &#8220;gangsta&#8221; and get shown the door, its &#8220;racism;&#8221;</p>
<p>Make an obscene and boorish special of yourself in public and get laughed at, its &#8220;racism;&#8221;</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t find your favorite brand of popsicle in a grocery shop, its &#8220;racism;&#8221;</p>
<p>And of course, pick your nose or rectum and get dirty fingers, its &#8220;racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is simply a hard fact of life with those people (and yes, the &#8220;pun&#8221; or jab is intended here,) they will never be happy or feel adequate so long as they have any higher evolved or even better hybrid peoples around them. Today it is whites they envy, but let us go under through our own inexplicable altruistic stupidity and it will be the Asians or Latinos tomorrow that curse them with &#8220;racist&#8221; oppression. </p>
<p>In all honesty, if this country were suddenly only populated by African &#8220;Americans&#8221; and pure black Africans, would not the two groups begin going at each other over who had been more &#8220;oppressed&#8221;? Imagine, just imagine, the divided &#8220;loyalties&#8221; of an Al Sharpton or Jesse Jackson over a Membeki or Mugabe, in discussions of what did more damage in such a scenario: &#8220;Was it slavery or colonialism, where does over-oppression fit in?&#8221;&hellip;on the Next Oprah&hellip;?</p>
<p>Would, the UN have to step in and mediate?</p>
<p>That is, if it even still existed?</p>
<p>This election will be a bad joke; in fact, it already is!</p>
<p>If Nobrains McCain wins, it will be because of the &#8220;racism&#8221; of whites; if the Ubermulatto Obama wins and then fails miserably (as can be expected,) it will be because not enough &#8220;good will&#8221; was extended to him by whites while he was the General Secretary. </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!<br>

			<p>How could Barack Obama close the &#8220;divide on race&#8221; when the racial divide is central to his marxist religion?  Blacks aren&rsquo;t interested in race relations, they are interested in quotas, handouts, and revenge.  The blacks who actually are part of our culture and can exist in the world of ideas like Thomas Sowell, Alan Keyes, Hermain Cain, and Clarence Thomas, are ridiculed as uncle toms by the black masses.  I&rsquo;d take Thomas Sowell as president over Obama, McCain, or Kennedy any day.</p>

			<p>First of all, how was he supposed to accomplish this feat of pure magic?  It would certainly require magic, because making this happen in the real world would take decades.  This has already been proven since 60% of the black people polled said they still think race is a major issue in America.  Contrast that to 34% of white people who feel the same way.  Why the gap in attitude?  And why is it white people&rsquo;s fault that black people are apparently twice as fixated on racial issues than white people in America?  Well, maybe because the propaganda  literally tells the black people of America things are unchanged, so they believe it.  The media tells this to them, they learn it in church apparently and when it comes time to vote they make overwhemingly racial choices.  Racism from white folks has made the most dramatic declines in the past few  decades.  Can black Americans say the same thing?  </p>
<p>Obama making such an instant change is as foolish a notion as thinking that black Americans will suddenly stop hating white people the day after reperations are paid out (again).  Anyone who reads this article objectively should ssurely see the numbers are telling a very obvious story.  White Americans are growing up, black Americans are not by almost a 2 to 1 margin.  </p>

			<p>If this poll is acurate, it simply illustrates that Obama is just the front man for a bunch of hype generated by the liberal media. The many who disagree with their racial tactics (including White guilt) used by this hype machine are seldom, if ever, heard.     </p>

			<p>Of course, race should not be what we&rsquo;re voting on. I had pretty much made up my mind that I wasn&rsquo;t voting at all. I would never vote for a Democrat and I didn&rsquo;t think I could make myself vote for McCain. </p>
<p>Putting aside race, the only reason to vote for McCain is for the defense of this country. Clinton weakened U.S. Defense. Bush got blamed when we were attacked. U.S. citizens could not imagine fighting on this land. It&rsquo;s unthinkable to most. But if US-haters showed up in large numbers, we&rsquo;d have to deal with it. I believe McCain would be a better bet for not allowing that to happen. </p>
<p>Consider this seriously when you vote. Remind others, also. </p>

			<p> The reason blacks wont admit to a better atmosphere in race relations is because they need to keep the race card in their pocket. Whenever a black doesnt get what they want, the race card is played.<br>
 They will NEVER give up the card that ALWAYS makes whites dig in their pockets. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Mr. Obama&rsquo;s candidacy, while generating high levels of enthusiasm among black voters, is not seen by them as evidence of significant improvement in race relations.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was the opinion of many of us before we were informed about this poll.</p>
<p>Aware whites know full well that an Obama presidency will not make it impossible for blacks to complain about having equal opportunities, as the naive multicults so foolishly believe.  Blacks will continue to complain and howl about injustice towards them no matter what occurs in their favor.</p>
<p>Just look at how they&rsquo;re behaving now?  Can any intelligent person, besides the emotionally and mentally handicapped leftists,  legitimately claim that blacks do not have MORE opportunities and privileges now than any other race in America?  </p>
<p>That they do is without doubt, yet how are they reacting?  To hear them one would think they were in chains with a white foot on their necks.</p>
<p>Considering that, how anybody could believe&hellip;..even the leftists&hellip;.. these pitiful people would ever rise to the level of sanity and intelligence and stop their whining is beyond me.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter if they were each given a million dollars, a mansion, a Rolls Royce, plus white maids and servants, they would be bellyaching and wailing as if they were being stomped on.</p>
<p>They hold the title of the biggest ingrates in the history of the world and it&rsquo;s one they&rsquo;re not likely to lose.</p>
<p>This country will never know peace until these people are gone for good&hellip;.or at least isolated in their own territory.</p>

			<p>I worked as a pollster in the summer and autumn of 1988, when Bush Sr. and Dukakis were the candidates, and I assure everyone that these national polls are absolutely meaningless. I was one of about eighty or so pollsters; we each had a stack of index cards with names and telephone numbers of registered voters. We would call each one, ask them their choice, and then mark their responses on a form. Guess what? Many pollsters marked whatever answers they felt like it, regardless of what the voter stated! Some pollsters (and I won&rsquo;t say which part of the population they were part of) arrived for their shift with a variety of snacks, and then languidly called a few voters, ate some popcorn, made another two or three calls, sipped their cola, got up for a cigarette break, came back to their chairs, decided they were tired of polling voters, and thus simply filled out the form with whatever responses they wanted to. In other words, it is all hogwash!! Those of us who *did* make the effort and wrote all responses truthfully were stunned at the behavior of the others and I walked away knowing that I should never trust national polls again. It is all a complete joke. There is almost zero credibility to them. I was there!!</p>

			<p>Whites have a reason to not trust Obama after all the Rev. Wright and other high contriversy surrounding Obama, whites have every right to not vote for Obama. Blacks on the other continue to show their racism yet the poll dose not even talk about the fact blacks vote 97% for Obama. The fact blacks support Obama even after finding out about Obamas racist ties to left wing racist anti-white extreamist groups, points out the fact that 97% of blacks are racist. </p>
<p>How many whites would vote for a white president who has racist connections answer very little. This electional years gives us the &#8220;whitepeople&#8221; right to vote for David Duke as president. </p>
<p>Whites need to vote for their own interest and stop supporting the interest of other races. How many whites vote not for their interest but for those of the minority community? answer to many. Whites must vote for their own interest not the interest of a race that hates and is against our own interest.<br>

<p>McAmnesty will destroy any chance of whites ever retaking (or at least re-civilizing) America; Obama will revivify our hopes. For real white racial nationalists, preservationists, supremacists, etc., Obama will be a godsend. But don&rsquo;t be stupid and actually vote for the monster, even if you&rsquo;re in a swing-state. An Obama presidency, founded on a likely miniscule mandate, and especially with a great rightist third party showing, could provide us with the breakthrough we need. </p>

The post of 12:24 AM mentioning irresponsible and lazy people working on national polls is something of an eye-opener. But the way this is handled in the media is for everyone to look at more than one poll. Patterns usually do emerge, so there is some credibility to the whole process.<br>

<p>Posted by Robert Kelly</p>
<p>True:  Thus they&rsquo;ll turn to revenge, as Flamethrower writes above  &mdash;  through demands of punitive transfers of White wealth, racial quotas, and more forced integration.</p>
<p>As Jared Taylor has commented on many occasions:  If integration and mult-culturalism were so wonderful, people would be running toward it, seeking it out, instead of sacrificing everything they have to avoid it at all costs.</p>
<p>The main reason to vote for McCain (amnesty or not) is appointment of federal judges, especially those of the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Who do you think he&rsquo;ll appoint?  I figure he&rsquo;ll go for an NCAAP or ACLU lawyer or he&rsquo;ll throw a bone to the Hispanic constituency and go for a lawyer from LA RAZA.</p>
<p>As it is, the Supreme Court seems to be split 5-4 on major issues such as the Second Amendment.</p>
<p>One thing we can be very sure of:  President Obama will not nominate judges who will uphold the Equal Protection tenants of the Constitutions.  </p>
<p>And remember:  Supreme Court judges are Lifetime Appointments.</p>
<p>Hold your nose and vote for McCain, he&rsquo;s our only hope, slim as it might be&hellip;</p>

<p>With all due respect BonBon, I&rsquo;m afraid you are still clinging.  The fact of the matter is that the three seperate but equal powers are controlled from the outside.  I know there are many people who would quarrel with this, but then, that&rsquo;s part of the problem. <br>
Either way, I am convinced that by this time next year there will hardly be a soul alive who thinks the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial Branches are in any way autonomous.  </p>
<p>This is a hard pill to swallow folks but the Republic is over.<br>
If you think you can save it you are whistling in the wind. It is obvious that they are forcing our hand - it is the unconscious assumption of nearly every post here at AR.<br>
For every day we cling we weaken our chances of seeking and acting on an alternative.</p>

			<p>Bon-Bon:</p>
<p>I appreciate your thoughts, but presidents don&rsquo;t appoint judges -they only nominate them.  McCain, with a Democratically controlled congress, has practically no chance of seeing any  conservative judicial nominees confirmed.</p>
<p>And I doubt that McCain, who&rsquo;s made a career of sticking him thumb in the eyes of conservative Republicans, would even try.</p>

			<p>I have to concur with BonBon. Particulaly respective to holding one&rsquo;s nose and voting for McAmnesty. Black on White crime is bad enough. While the controlled media will go through any length to hide these kind of crimes from us, they will skyrocket under an Obama presidence. Blacks feeling they can do whatever they want. Obama also waffles back and forth. I heard he FAVORED reparations, later claimed to be against it in another article. The guy is a hopeless liar. Fully as bad as Shrillary is.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m quite surprised that Eurowhite women have supported Obama to the degree shown since women tend to seek security above all else. Remember it was Soviet women who supported the Communists after their fall in Russia because the lefties, as always, guaranteed women security with stolen taxes for pensions, etc. Eurowhite mothers must also understand that their sons will continue to face Affirmative Racism (AA) which Obama supports (and McCain stands neutral). As the economy and world security crumble under Obama, these women along with the rest of us will experience tragic social insecurity and see how they actually voted against their valuing of security. I think if McCain wants to win he has to hammer away at the likely insecurity under Obama.</p>

			<p>An Obama win will be celebrated wildly in the streets, the black community putting on a spectacle that will evoke memories of how they cheered OJ&rsquo;s acquittal.</p>
<p>On the flip side an Obama loss will come complete with riots and years of news stories on how racist a country we are.</p>
<p>Either way it is sure to open just a few more white eyes to reality.</p>

			<p>Not one of us here would vote for McCain. All the votes going into his column will actually be votes against that Muslim whose name I refuse to speak or type. Why has God forsaken America? How was our nation brought so low as this? Then again,</p>
<p>Mein Volk, do we have here an opportunity to finally rid ourselves of that monstrous two-party system? While every shred of common sense screams that we mustn&rsquo;t vote for that Muslim, maybe that is exactly what we need do, for two reasons. First, in winning the Presidency for Space Cadet McCain we would be rewarding the Republican Party which is like petting the dog after it bites hell out of you. They abandoned us, let us now abandon them. They are in dire need of a wake-up call; we should send them packing. Second, I cannot think of a surer way to destroy that behemoth insanity we call our elected government than to put the loony communistic Democrat Party in position so they can run it and themselves into the ground. If we would bring on the demise of the R. Party by voting 100% for the D. Party, then stand back and allow the D&rsquo;s to self-destruct (as they most certainly will do), we may have a chance to stop all this madness. But then again, </p>
<p>Like everyone else when my car goes into skid on ice, emotionally the last thing I want to do is turn into the direction of the skid &mdash; even though I logically know that is the only way to recover control.</p>
<p>Our old nation is sick, and dying. That inept Muslim would quickly bring it to an end; McCain would just prolong its agony.<br>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;I appreciate your thoughts, but presidents don&rsquo;t appoint judges -they only nominate them. McCain, with a Democratically controlled congress, has practically no chance of seeing any conservative judicial nominees confirmed&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re absolutely right about the restrictions of presidential appointments; I was referring to this source:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Justices of the Supreme Court, judges of the courts of appeals and the district courts, and judges of the Court of International Trade, are appointed under Article III of the Constitution by the President of the United States with the advice and consent of the Senate&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps you&rsquo;re right and the Ted Kennedy-types in the Senate would &#8216;Bork&rsquo; any McCain nominee  &mdash;  perhaps not.  But I&rsquo;m very sure any appointees from Obama would be leftist ACLU-types in favor of reparations, more AA quotas, anti-White legislation, and anti-Second Amendment decisions.  Remember:  The recent pro-Second Amendment decision a few weeks ago was 5-4  &mdash;  One Vote.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take my chances with a McCain presidency, as distasteful as that may be  &mdash;  watching him mau-mau to LaRaza and the NAACP this past week made my blood boil. </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;With all due respect BonBon, I&rsquo;m afraid you are still clinging&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Mal:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I follow you.  What is it exactly I and others on this board are clinging to?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like the direction this country is heading any more than anyone else here, especially in light of the two lame, depressing presidential candidates.   Both will take us down the road to hell &mdash; I believe Obama faster and more furious than McCain, and some here write that this is a good thing as it will speed up the inevitable collapse of this country.  </p>
<p>I have watched my home state, California, in five decades turn from a safe, clean paradise into a gang-infested, high-tax, non- and anti-White third world hell hole.</p>
<p>Do I believe all is lost?  No, but I believe we are well on our way to an economic and societal collapse &mdash; and that racial violence is inevitably in our future.  Best to remain armed, prepared and ever vigilant:</p>
<p>https://www.chaostan.com/nxnet/nuclear-threat.html</p>
<p>I am also fully aware of how this transformation came about and who is responsible for it:</p>
<p><a href="https://library.flawlesslogic.com/juif.htm" rel="nofollow">https://library.flawlesslogic.com/juif.htm</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;.Never in the history of the world has a dominant people thrown open the gates to strangers, and poured out its wealth to aliens. Never before has a people been fooled into thinking that there was virtue or nobility in surrendering its heritage, and giving away to others its place in history. Of all the races in America, only whites have been tricked into thinking that a preference for one&rsquo;s own kind is racism. ..&rdquo;</p>
<p>What would you suggest we do?</p>
<p>Respectfully, </p>
<p>Bon<br>

<p>Great post BonBon.  And I agree.  That is EXACTLY why I mentioned the &#8220;clinging&#8221; part. And I also meant it when I said &#8220;respectfully&#8221;, I was not being patronizing.</p>
<p>What I meant was that if you think we are headed for Social and Economic Collapse, and if you think that it will manifest itself, in part, in Racial violence, then how is one President going to change that by a Supreme Court appointement? He&rsquo;s not.  And so, to think that he could or would is an example of a failure to let go and accept, fully, the unpleasant reality that you yourself described so well in your second post.</p>
<p>Any President is going to do exactly what they are told to do.  We probably have not had a President with any real authority or power since before Woodrow Wilson.  We&rsquo;re only now figuring that out. All of the major institutions of today are controlled from the outside and those on the inside who do have power are like minded brothers and sisters in the &#8220;cause&#8221; advanced by &#8220;the REAL owners of this Country.&#8221;</p>

			<p>We must always look for the best of the best for president and you just can&rsquo;t find one among the white race.</p>
<p>Take the army commercial, all of the whites have different jobs but the only on who is a intelligent analyst is black. Is this brain washing or what.</p>

			<p>I wonder if Americans would be more willing to vote for an Asian for president? Come on people - I am a white guy - my grand parents came from Germany during the rise of Hitler. And my wife came from the Phillippines. She came as a nanny and is now and RN. Asians have out performed whites in schools and many jobs. And now Toyota is the number one car company. Let&rsquo;s not focus on race - let&rsquo;s focus on who is best qualified. Besides the president doesnt have nearly as much power as you might like to believe. The burueacracy does and that is an awful mess. </p>

<p>No argument with you, Rob, about the bureaucracy. But this is a racial site, not a political site.  Why should people posting here not focus on race? <br>
