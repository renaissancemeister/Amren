						<p>U.S. Hispanic activists laid out plans on Friday to register 2 million new Latino voters to boost the clout of the United States&rsquo; fastest-growing voter bloc in the November presidential election.</p>
<p>Organizers representing more than 100 grass-roots Hispanic organizations from a dozen states met in Los Angeles to fine-tune a drive to get Latinos to sign up and vote in the November 4 election.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Organizers of the initiative say activists will seek to register voters through community-based drives, focused on battleground states such as Colorado, Nevada and New Mexico that they say have been overlooked by both Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In recent weeks both McCain and Obama have addressed several national Hispanic organizations in their hunt for votes, stressing economic and educational proposals they said would help Latinos as well as reviving plans for a comprehensive overhaul of immigration laws.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The drive to encourage Latinos to vote began in earnest last year after hundreds of thousands of Hispanics marched through the streets of many U.S. cities calling for an overhaul of immigration laws.<br/>

			<p>&#8220;Plan is to register another two million Hispanics to vote in November&#8221;</p>
<p>The question is, to vote on what? To vote on issues detrimental to whites, others? A lesson and a warning to people who continue to believe that the radical hispanic groups, are somehow just mild mannered folk with no racist agenda at all. Really??</p>

			<p>  It truly is a sad day when politicians pander to the lowest denominator for a vote. It would seem to me that the United States is the newest addition to the failed great countries of history. Egypt, Rome, Great Britain. etc&hellip;&hellip; Even though the Soviets fell apart in 1990, they were right when they said that we would be conquered without a shot fired. We, as the Romans, were destroyed by race-mixing, lack of national identity, and no cohesion what-so-ever to hold the country together. Too many spoken languages, too many different sets of beliefs,,etc&hellip; It truly is over for this nation as a world leader in anything except for the race to Hell. I think we are winning that one. All I can say is, save yourselves, band together as a race and try to establish a haven or a group of states for our race of people. We have already given way too much to others that deserved nothing. At least establish a small country for our people. After all it is true, if you are not part of the solution, then you are part of the problem. If you still feel &#8220;white guilt&#8221;, then go live amongst those whom you desire to serve. Leave our sight, and never come back.</p>

			<p>It would be interesting if anyone cared to find out how many illegal aliens the Latinos will be registering to vote.  How convenient for the Mexicans and South and Central Americans then, to be able, in great numbers, to vote on US policy and law, all the while remaining citizens of a foreign country!  WHy don&rsquo;t we just start handing out US election ballots in Canada, Indonesia, the Phillipines, China and Zimbabwe?  I&rsquo;m sure if the world can all vote here it&rsquo;ll be interesting to see the election results!  As for Hispanics marching through the streets demanding an overhaul of US Immigration laws, WHAT immigration laws?  Do we have any?  </p>

			<p>Wait, I thought the mythical Hispanic vote with their strong sense of family values was supposed to be the ace in the hole for the Republican party and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s ok for them to pander to them with amnesty proposals and weak stances on illegal immigration?   I guess I was wrong.   Fooled by the government again!</p>

<p>So true!  We are replicating the central causes of the fall of Rome.  When everyone was made a Roman citizen the empire fell.  There are important details involved, but the most important one, Christianity is playing its role too.  The Roman Catholic Church sought to reclaim the physical Empire&rsquo;s holdings and mostly suceeded.  Pope&rsquo;s used to be youthful general&rsquo;s, not old pretentious men.  It used the Christian idea to replace Roman citizenship with membership in the church as a tool for conquest.  But I wonder what the result of the fall of America will be?  The stuggle&rsquo;s of the West are not occuring in a bubble, seperate from other concerns.  With the less than subtle differences to compare to it, we may be about to enter a period far worse than the one that Europe experienced after the fall of Rome and the new Roman Catholic &#8220;empire&rsquo;s&#8221; rise.  <br/>

			<p>If we begin to reach the point where Hispanics can vote our country right out from under us we will be obligated to drastically reduce the number of voting age Hispanics.  What other choice would we have other than surrender to one of the world&rsquo;s quintessential race of bottom feeders without so much as firing a shot?  I think not&hellip;   </p>

			<p>A not so minor point.  Read the headline:</p>
<p>&#8220;US Hispanics ramp up drive to register voters&#8221;.</p>
<p>Written by Syantani Chatterjee.</p>
<p>I always thought that the word &#8216;ramp&rsquo; was a noun.  Stand by&hellip;</p>
<p>Yes, it is. A noun.  Never a verb.  Had to check the ol&rsquo; dictionario&hellip;  A few years ago it seems that people started using ramp as a verb.  I don&rsquo;t know where that habit came from but I never could find anyone to explain what ramp meant as a verb.  I see ramp today used as a verb in newspapers.  Where did our standards go?  This is just wrong.  It drives me crazy.</p>
<p>Another word used incorrectly is &#8216;impact&rsquo;.  While it is a transitive verb, in most cases of usage the better choice is either &#8216;affect&rsquo; or &#8216;effect&rsquo;.  &#8216;Impact&rsquo; means to press tightly together.  Drives me crazy&hellip;</p>

			<p>My father always said that America backed the wrong side in Europe in WWII.  When I consider the threat we face from an out of control overpopulation of minorities I have to admit that German style fascism and the methods they employed look better to me every day.  </p>
<p>If whites allow this nation to continue down the path to communism whites will soon become a persecuted minority that will eventually be exterminated.  Better them than us I say&hellip;<br/>

			<p>The Influx of all these illegal aliens (Latino&rsquo;s) into our alabasterd Cities must be stopped.  We are becoming more morally corrupt every day that our borders remain open to these scourges.  Unite my brothers before it is too late.  America was built on white principles and that is what made this country great.  If we do not act soon I am afraid it may be to late soon. </p>

			<p> Registering Hispanics to vote! You can just imagine the shenanigans that will go on. Can&rsquo;t you? I mean who is gonna check these people out?  The black and Hispanic vote don&rsquo;t mean that much anyway. Whoever wins the White vote will be the next president. You don&rsquo;t want to anger white people. Someone should come out for tighter border security.  Both candidates are kissing up to La Raza types, however. Seems like the La Raza types can&rsquo;t lose.</p>

			<p>   Unless you live in a dirty 7 state (illegal aliens-CA,TX,CO,FLA,IL,NY and NJ) you just don&rsquo;t know how bad the invasion really is. Most people in other states don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;re talking about when it comes to illegal aliens.</p>
