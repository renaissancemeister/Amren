						<p>The number of Mexican-born immigrants who became U.S. citizens swelled by nearly 50% last year amid a massive campaign by Spanish-language media and immigrant advocacy groups to help eligible residents apply for citizenship, according to a government report released Thursday.</p>
<p>Despite Mexicans&rsquo; historically low rates of naturalization, 122,000 attained citizenship in 2007, up from 84,000 the previous year, with California and Texas posting the largest gains. Salvadorans and Guatemalans also showed significant increases at a time when the overall number of naturalizations declined by 6%.</p>
<p>At the same time, the number of citizenship applications filed doubled to 1.4 million last year, the report by the U.S. Office of Immigration Statistics found.</p>
<p>The surge in naturalization of Mexicans, their largest year-to-year increase this decade, came amid pitched national debate over immigration reform. The report cited the campaign by Spanish-language media and community groups, along with a desire to apply before steep fee increases took effect, as two major reasons for the jump in naturalizations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The increase in Latinos with the power to vote could affect the political landscape in November, analysts said. Louis DiSipio, a UC Irvine political science professor, said one of the biggest impacts could be in Florida, a key battleground state that posted 54,500 new citizens last year. Although the ethnic Cuban population there has dominated the Latino political landscape and tended to vote Republican, he said, more of the newer immigrants are coming from South America and trending Democratic. For the first time this decade, more Latinos were registered as Democrats than Republicans, 35% to 33% as of this spring, according to Gold.</p>
<p>Beyond November, the swelling Latino numbers nationwide will continue to recast the political landscape for local elections, DiSipio said. He said that growing Latino naturalizations in the late 1990s, thanks to a 1986 amnesty for illegal immigrants, helped California Democrats gain an 800,000-plus voter edge and that similar gains could occur with the newest increase.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Erica L. Bernal-Martinez, senior director of civic engagement for the association of Latino officials, said grass-roots organizations planned to continue their push to encourage naturalizations among the estimated 4 million to 5 million eligible Latinos. Mexicans have historically had low rates of naturalization &mdash; 35% compared with 59% for all immigrants &mdash; but that appears to be changing as media and community organizations pour unprecedented resources and energy into their civic engagement campaigns, Bernal-Martinez and Gold said.</p>
<p>More than 400 community organizations across the country, along with major Spanish-language media, have joined forces in a &#8220;Ya Es Hora&#8221; (It&rsquo;s Time) campaign to help eligible voters become citizens and register to vote. The campaign plans to hold naturalization workshops in 10 cities Saturday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The new report found that California posted the largest gains in new citizens in 2007, from 153,000 the year before to 182,000; followed by Texas, from 38,000 to 53,000; and Illinois, from 30,000 to 39,000.</p>
<p>After Mexico, the largest number of new citizens came from India, the Philippines, China, Vietnam, the Dominican Republic, South Korea and El Salvador.</p>

			<p>Are our new citizens going to drop the hypenated names and become true Americans, or will their loyalties remain with their native country? Anyone want to take a guess?</p>

			<p>Their loyalties will remain with their native country. Good riddance. Let them have the arid deserts of the southwest. If they want territory beyond that, they will have to face violence. I do not want them to be thought of as Americans and breeding with my younger family members in the first place. I hope this comment doesn&rsquo;t cause a huge debate, since those who oppose my comment must not understand the consequences of &#8220;integration by any means&#8221; aka Yugoslavia.</p>

<p>Posted by Angryyoungman at 11:24 PM on July 14 </p>
<p>At the risk of boring regular posters - I would like to make a salient point.  And since I lived in that region for several years in the late 1990s and read a lot of Balkan and Habsburg history (that is the bore, I know) I wish to point out to Angryyoungman that although Tito settled Albanians in Kosovo, etc., he basically did not force anyone to live anywhere they did not want to during Yugoslavia.  He allowed Albanians to settle in limited numbers in Kosovo to trim automatic Serbian nationalism.  Although plenty of Serbs and others lived in other regions (I knew many Serbs in Slovenia who had been there all their lives - one in her 80s) the various ethnic groups - and especially Bosnians tended to stick pretty tight to their own groups.  They married in their ethnic groups with little exception.  There were so many jokes about certain ethnic groups and about their own ethnic groups that everyone seemed to slough it off.  Slovenes had hilarious jokes about themselves as well as Montenegrins, Serbs and all the rest.  Slovenes are probably the most easy going of all of them, but it was a Serb who told me a joke about that US jet that got shot down during the NATO action in Kosovo.  He said it was the result of a wedding.  The joke is that Serbs love to shoot their pocket guns into the air at their weddings - which go on for three days.  The point was that it was no acheivement, just a side effect of normal, crazy Serbian life.  </p>
<p>Today, after all of the fighting and bad feelings, these people have a better sense of humor about everything than we do in this country.</p>
<p>No, it was the reality that al-Qaeda actually had set up a cell in Sarajevo and Milosevic&rsquo;s proclaimation that all the school textbooks in his new Yugoslavia would be in Serbian that started the fireworks.  It had nothing to do with forced immigration.  People on this site are making a lot of referrences to Yugoslavia these days, but they don&rsquo;t really seem to know what they are talking about.  I know this stuff, I lived there.<br>

			<p>Let me guess.  They did it so they could vote against amnesty, and build a wall?</p>
