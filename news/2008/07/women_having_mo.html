						<p>Each woman now has 1.91 children on average &mdash; the highest since 1973 &mdash; according to the Office for National Statistics.</p>
<p>As a result the number of births &mdash; 690,000 &mdash; increased by 20,000 in 2007 compared to the previous year, when there were 1.86 children per woman.</p>
<p>One factor in the rise is the tendency for foreign-born mothers, particularly from the Indian sub-continent, to have large families.</p>
<p>Another is women choosing to have children when they are in their more fertile 20s, rather than delaying until they are in their 30s and 40s.</p>
<p>However, those who do delay are having more children due to improvements in fertility treatment.</p>
<p>The figures, which relate to England and Wales, indicate the overall fertility rate has now increased for six successive years.</p>
<p>Its lowest point came in 2001 when it sank to 1.63 children per woman.</p>
<p>However, last year&rsquo;s rate is still far lower than in the 1960s when it reached a peak of 2.93 children per woman in 1964.</p>
<p>Lois Cook, the ONS statistician behind the provisional figures, said the analysis showed women across the country and of all ages were contributing to population growth.</p>
<p>Ms Cook said: &#8220;It is quite complicated and there is not a single explanation such as older mothers or migrant mothers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apart from women under 20, all child bearing age groups are experiencing a rise in fertility rates which could mean fewer are putting off having a family and deciding to have children before they reach 30.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is true that rates are also going up among women in their 30s and 40s. But in the early part of 2001 there was evidence more women were delaying motherhood.&#8221;</p>
<p>The proportion of births to foreign-born women now stands at 23 per cent, an increase of 1 per cent.</p>
<p>On average, foreign women have 2.5 children each, rising to almost five for those from Pakistan, and 3.9 from Bangladesh.</p>
<p>The number of babies born to British mothers is also increasing, but lags far behind immigrants at an average of 1.7 children each.</p>
<p>Compared with 2006, there have been increases in fertility rates for all age groups except for women under 20. The highest percentage increase was observed for women aged 40 and over with an increase of 6 per cent compared with the previous year.</p>
<p>Fertility rates for women aged 40 and over have more than doubled in 15 years since 1992 and in 2007 reached 12.1 births per 1,000 women.</p>
<p>Last year 3,345 infant deaths were registered, giving a rate of 4.8 deaths per 1,000 live births. This is the lowest rate ever recorded in England and Wales.</p>
<p>The ONS has predicted the UK population could reach 71 million by 2031, with migrants and their UK-born children accounting for 69 per cent of that growth. Part of the reason for the explosion is Eastern European women, particularly Poles, having more children in Britain.</p>
<p>The number of deaths registered increased for the first time since 2003. In 2007, there were 504,052 deaths in England and Wales representing an increase of 0.3 per cent compared with 2006.</p>
<p>Circulatory diseases, such as heart disease, are still the most common major cause of death contributing to over one third (34 per cent).</p>
<p>Cancer accounted for just over a quarter (28 per cent) of all deaths registered in 2007, with a rate of 2,133 per million population for males and 1,545 for females. Since 1997 death rates for cancer have fallen, by 16 per cent for males and 12 per cent for females.<br>

			<p>According to the Office of National Statistics 9.8% of all births in the UK in 2007 were to mothers born in the New Commonwealth nations (Pakistan, Bangladesh, Caribbean, etc&hellip;)</p>
<p>Only 3.8% of births are from mothers born in the EU and yet the attribute the increase of births to &#8220;the explosion is Eastern European women, particularly Poles, having more children in Britain&#8221;.</p>
<p>Propaganda.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to cover up the real problem and make people think it&rsquo;s Europeans who are having the babies.</p>

			<p>My mistake.<br>
The figures I quoted are from 2006 even though the other files on that site I linked to were from 2007.</p>
<p>I still doubt that they&rsquo;ve changed much in regards to the proportion of mothers that are from the EU vs the New Commonwealth countries.</p>

<p>Sadly, still way under the replacement level and there never is an indication of how many of these White British mothers babies are having babies by non-White (therefore, non-British) males. If that is factored in, it&rsquo;s obviously even less than 1.7.  And Pakistani women are at 5.0 and the Bangladesh women are at 3.9?!</p>

			<p>The birth rate among white women throughout the West could easily rise to 2-1/2 children per couple, which would increase  populations, if the governments pushed just a wee bit as they have done in Russia, but if they did that they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to import third world rabble in the pursuit of the multicultural utopia they desire, under the guise of needing to pay for their retirees.</p>
<p>Case closed.</p>

			<p>Remember that Britain, and England in particular, also has by far the highest rate of White emigration of any Western country.  And those Poles aren&rsquo;t staying in the UK  &mdash;   with the decline in the pound relative to the zloty, coupled with the UK&rsquo;s floundering economy, the Poles are all going back home (or settling in Germany or Austria, which have big Polish communities).  The UK is scheduled to go majority non-White (majority Pakistani, Indian, African in particular) by 2030, not long after the USA, Australia and Canada themselves.  Looks like the empire really is striking back against Britain.</p>

			<p>An obvious point that is completely ignored in this story is that there are as least as many 2nd and 3rd generation (therefore described by the British government as &#8216;English&rsquo;) non-White mothers as there are &#8216;foreign born&rsquo; non-White mothers.<br>
  Bearing that in mind it is very reasonable to assume that something like 30-40% of all births in Engalnd are to non-White parents.</p>

<p>What I think is happening is a double-whammy of those utopian socialists who see multiculturalism as their means to that end, and greedy capitalists who don&rsquo;t care about the color their wages slaves.  Since non-white ones demand and expect less, whites are expendable.  I guess the real show-down between these two entities is put off for a while, but I think it will come eventually.</p>

			<p>The British Government and much of the British media habitually described 2nd/3rd generation immigrants as &#8216;British&rsquo; on the technicality that they were born in the UK. <br>
This is highly mis-leading; true British people are being out-bred in their own land at a frightening rate. </p>

			<p>Of course, since the government does not believe that there are any racial differences, it does not perceive a difference between 2nd and 3rd generation foreigners having children and real British women giving birth. I have a strong suspicion that this increase in the &#8220;British&#8221; birth rate is merely the result of Pakistanis and such increasing as a percentage of the population, not actual English, Scottish and Welsh. Also this is counting the impact of foreign men impregnating English women.</p>

			<p>They must have a record as to how many births are to White British mothers because they record the birth rate of white British women.</p>
<p>They may even have data on the race of the fathers but they&rsquo;re not publishing it.</p>
<p>They do at least publish the country of origin of the father.</p>
<p>Mother and father non-UK born: 14.6% of all births<br>
Mother non-UK born, father born in the UK: 6.2% of all births<br>
Mother non-UK born, father not recorded: 1.1%<br>
Mother born in the UK, father non-UK born: 5.9%</p>

<p>27.9% of all UK births in 2006 had at least one foreign born parent and it still doesn&rsquo;t include births by Pakistanis, etc&hellip; who were born in the UK.</p>

			<p>If you could actually find the number of WHITE BRITISH babies being born in these figures, it would not be good.  Most non-whites in the UK are born there and are not counted as &#8220;immigrants.&#8221;  Also, many white women in the UK have mulato offspring, like our friend the &#8220;shoebomber&#8221; Richard Reid.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;Also, many white women in the UK have mulato offspring, like our friend the &ldquo;shoebomber&rdquo; Richard Reid.&#8221; </p>
<p>A friend of mine was recently in London for business.  According to his own (very unscientific) observations, he thought they were more white women with mulatto children in London than Chicago!  He couldn&rsquo;t believe it, at one point he took a walk in a park near his hotel and saw more mulatto kids with white mothers than white kids with white mothers! Sad&hellip;           </p>

<p>If more white men would act like men and not like either A) scared little mice, or B) misogynist whiners (&#8220;You&rsquo;re supposed to be attracted to white men, what&rsquo;s wrong with you??&#8221;), then they&rsquo;d probably have more white women interested.</p>
<p>The sad thing is if they acted like OBNOXIOUS misogynists (i.e. like blacks, Mexicans etc.) the ladies would probably flock to them.</p>
