<h1>Danny Glover&rsquo;s Slavery Film Lacked &#8220;White Heroes&#8221;, Producers Said</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AFP, July 25, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>US actor Danny Glover, who plans an epic next year on Haitian independence hero Toussaint-Louverture, said he slaved to raise funds for the movie because financiers complained there were no white heroes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Producers said &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a nice project, a great project .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. where are the white heroes?&rsquo;&#8221; he told AFP during a stay in Paris this month for a seminar on film.</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&rsquo;t get the money here, I couldn&rsquo;t get the money in Britain. I went to everybody. You wouldn&rsquo;t believe the number of producers based in Europe, and in the States, that I went to,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first question you get, is &lsquo;Is it a black film?&rsquo; All of them agree, it&rsquo;s not going to do good in Europe, it&rsquo;s not going to do good in Japan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody has to prove that to be a lie!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Maybe I&rsquo;ll have the chance to prove it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Toussaint,&#8221; Glover&rsquo;s first project as film director, is about Francois Dominique Toussaint Louverture (1743-1803), a former slave and one of the fathers of Haiti&rsquo;s independence from France in 1804, making it the first black nation to throw off imperial rule and become a republic.</p>
<p>The uprising he led was bloodily put down in 1802 by 20,000 soldiers dispatched to the Caribbean by Napoleon Bonaparte, who then re-established slavery after its ban by the leaders of the French Revolution.</p>
<p>Due to be shot in Venezuela early next year, the film will star Don Cheadle, Mos Def, Wesley Snipes and Angela Bassett.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&rsquo;t the first one who had this idea,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Sergey Eisenstein had the same idea, Anthony Quinn had this idea, Harry Belafonte, Sidney Poitier, and this goes on.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;Lethal Weapon&#8221; co-star, just turned 62, finally raised 18 of the 30 million dollars needed from a Venezuelan cultural body set up in 2006 by his friend President Hugo Chavez to counter what he termed &#8220;the Hollywood film dictatorship&#8221;.</p>
<p>Venezuelan filmmakers last year slammed the investment.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is Mr Glover who should be bringing dollars to Venezuela,&#8221; the National Association of Film Makers and the Venezuelan Chamber of Film Producers said in an open letter.</p>
<p>Glover, a longtime activist, has supported Chavez&rsquo;s political revolution since he was first elected in 1998.</p>
<p>After making his debut with a bit role in 1979 movie starring Clint Eastwood, &#8220;Escape From Alcatraz&#8221;, Glover played in films such as &#8220;Silverado&#8221; and &#8220;Witness&#8221; but grabbed wide attention after Steven Spielberg&rsquo;s 1985 movie &#8220;The Color Purple&#8221;.</p>
<p>He is probably most widely known as &#8220;Lethal Weapon&#8221; co-star with Mel Gibson.</p>
<p>Born in San Francisco, he enrolled at the Black Actors Workshop there and is known for his stand against discrimination as well as for his activism against the Iraqi war and anti-personnel mines.</p>
<p>An admirer of the Senegalese writer-filmmaker known as the father of African cinema, Ousmane Sembene, Glover has helped produce African films, including the recently-acclaimed arthouse movie &#8220;Bamako&#8221; by Abderrahmane Sissako.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first African films that I saw were films that portrayed Africans as savages, ignorant and uncivilized, and I wanted to know something else,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I was very fortunate, I had the chance to read writers like Mariama Ba, Aime Cesaire &hellip; and Leopold Sedar Senghor. I read him when I was 20.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I saw Sidney Poitier on screen, I was probably 10 or 11,&#8221; he added. &#8220;That was a different image, an image I had never seen before, on screen.</p>
<p>&#8220;The African-Americans I saw, they danced, they were buffoons, that was the image. So Sidney brought another image.&#8221;</p>
<p>History, Glover said, had enabled him to play a wide range of roles because of the changes taking place in society.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think cinema has played a great role in our re-imagining ourselves,&#8221; he said.<br>

			<p>I am what you would consider a white person.  I do not see color because I am a spiritual person.  I believe God created human beings with different shades of color and physical features.  God could have had some fun and made us all purple and I still believe we would have found a way to kill each other simply by looking for a small difference like a different accent.  I am ashamed of some of the so called white perfect people in this forum.  Really ignorant and racists. To say that blacks are not capable of govern themselves is not true.  Studies shows all races have the same brain and intelligence.  Throughout history blacks in Africa managed successful kingdoms.  The original Egyptians who built the pyramids were blacks.  The Bible even talks about black kingdoms.  King Solomon fell in love with a black queen.  Blacks were great inventors.  The traffic light that you stop to everyday while driving was invented by a black man. Someone is this forum said that blacks did not defeat the French by themselves and were helped by the British and Spaniards.  That is simply not true.  The Haitians actually fought the British and Spanish as well and won!  The Haitians had to kill the whites to gain their freedom because they were being killed and abused through slavery by the whites.  There are records showing white slave masters pulling out slaves eyes, chopping off their hands and feet and cutting off their heads if they did not obey or tried to escape. On the island of Haiti/Hispaniola, the whites nearly wiped out all of the native Indians (Tainos). The reason that Haiti became poor is not because blacks post-independence mismanaged the island, it is because after Haiti went independent, the major powers (England/Spain/France/United States) agreed not to trade with Haiti.  They said that they will keep Haiti isolated and Haiti will never succeed.  France demanded Haiti to pay millions of dollars in gold so that it will not re-invade Haiti with greater number of troops. Americans went to Haiti to create tensions between groups for profits.  Namely, to sell their old weapons that were obsolete in the United States.  Hence, created civil unrests in Haiti for decades.  Furthermore, Mr. Glover is correct.  Hollywood&rsquo;s movies have white heros.  This is a movie based on historical facts.  Blacks from got their freedom from whites by killing them.  As a result the Haitian Revolution set the stage for other slaves in the Americas to gain their freedom.  Haiti even sent troops to Georgia to fight in the civil war.  Haiti helped Simon Bolivar of Venezuela get their independence from Spain.  That is why Hugo Chavez is funding this film.  A lot of people in Venezuela does not want their country to invest in this film but most of these people do not know their history and forgot that Haiti helped Venezuela gain their independence.  However, Hugo Chavez being an educated man knows that Haiti helped Venezuela and he his showing his gratitude by funding the movie.  The movie is a 30 million dollar project.  Venezuela is funding 18. It is normal that the movie is being shot there.  It would have been better if it was shot in Haiti but Venezuela put up so much money, it would be an honor that is shot there.  The leads in the movie has no Haitian actors.  Danny Glover is also a business man.  In order to atract audience, big name actors are necessary.  I am sure there will secondary roles played by Haitians.  The Haitian government could not grant any money simply that Haiti is a bankrupt country.  It does not matter who are the actors or where it is being filmed.  The idea is that this story needs to be told.  The Haitian Revolution truly was so important in freing slaves in the Americas and stopped &#8220;slave ships excursions&#8221; to Africa.  By the way the Dominican Republic benefited from the Haitian revolution because the the freed slaves/Haitian Army went into invaded the Dominican Republic and freed their slave brothers and sisters from the Spaniards.  I can&rsquo;t wait to see the movie.  I wish it complete success worldwide!!!</p>

			<p>No matter where the movie will be filmed,the most important thing is to teach the history of Hispaniola island to the whole world.<br>
There are still racist people who don&rsquo;t see this idea in very good<br>
way since a great deal of them are expecting the death of all intel<br>
lectual Haitians to come up with their racist idea of what Haitian<br>
revolution was a supposition but not a reality.First of all,I want<br>
to thank Danny Glover for such a good idea,we,haitianpeople,love you.<br>
Good luck and don&rsquo;t let them play on mind.!!! </p>
