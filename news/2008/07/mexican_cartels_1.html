						<p>The head of Mexico&rsquo;s intelligence service has said that drug cartels are threatening the country&rsquo;s democratic institutions, including Congress.</p>
<p>Guillermo Valdes told the Financial Times newspaper that drug traffickers were trying to take over the power of the state.</p>
<p>Gangs have infiltrated police forces, justice departments and government bodies, he said.</p>
<p>Mexico has seen a sharp increase in drug-related violence this year.</p>
<p>Mr Valdes, who is the head of Cisen, the government&rsquo;s intelligence agency, said he could not rule out the possibility that drug money was involved in the campaigns of some members of the national Congress.</p>
<p><b>Lucrative trade</b></p>
<p>&#8220;Drug traffickers have become the principal threat because they are trying to take over the power of the state,&#8221; he told the Financial Times and a small group of foreign media.</p>
<p>The gangs, he said, had grown wealthy from the lucrative drugs trade and had recruited members of police forces, the judiciary and government organisations in order to protect their business.</p>
<p>He said that even federal institutions such as Congress itself could have been targeted by the powerful cartels.</p>
<p>&#8220;Congress is not exempt .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we do not rule out the possibility that drug money is involved in the campaigns (of some legislators),&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Earlier this month US President George W Bush signed into law a $400m aid package to provide training and equipment for the fight against drug trafficking.</p>
<p>It is believed that only $20m will go to Mr Valdes&rsquo;s service.</p>
<p>Since coming to power in 2006, Mexican President Felipe Calderon has deployed thousands of police and soldiers to tackle drug-trafficking.</p>
<p><b>Crime surge</b></p>
<p>There have been an estimated 4,700 drug-related murders during that period.</p>
<p>Mexico has seen a surge in drug-related violence and killings during 2008. On Sunday, eight people, including two youths and a 12-year-old girl, were shot dead when gunmen opened fire on their cars, Mexican officials said.</p>
<p>The attack happened as the victims were waiting at traffic lights in the city of Guamuchil in the state of Sinaloa.</p>
<p>Hours earlier gunmen in Mazatlan, on Sinaloa&rsquo;s coast, killed a policeman and then took dozens of people hostage in a restaurant before escaping.<br>

			<p>$400 million to a drug infested, crime ridden country because Mexicans love to claim its Americans that use the illegal drugs.  Mexico is a very rich country, but you and I continue to subsidize their corrput country.  When will Mexico reimburse America for all the crime committed by MEXICAN citizens in OUR country?  By the way no extra money is going to American boarder states that are also dealing with drug cartels. </p>

<p>J.O.H.N. M.C.C.A.I.N. (R.) A.R.I.Z.O.N.A.!= &#8220;Journeying Over Here Now, Mexican Cartels Commit Atrocities In Nation. Reject A RINO&rsquo;s Ignorance Zealously Offering Narcotraffickers Amnesty!</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to include the (R) which &#8220;Reject&#8221; stands for.<br>
Also, even though it may not be the intention of McCain to give Narcotraffickers amnest, something tells me that some would take advantage of McCain&rsquo;s Ignorant Zeal and so some of these traffickers would be included.</p>

			<p>Ill never forget back around 1987 when I arrived in LA on vacation from Illinois. When I rented a car, I was asked to sign an agreement that I &#8216;would not take my rental car into mexico&rsquo;. Puzzled I asked &#8216;why?&rsquo;. The lady then informed me that their rental cars are routinely stolen and the mexican government did nothing to help get them back&hellip;.just an early chapter in my journey of racial awareness.</p>

			<p>Coming to America. It&rsquo;s already here. Why are we so cowardly and silent whenever it concerns &#8220;minorities&#8221; and what they do?  Not those here, but those Whites throughout the country who are afraid of their own shadow? What has happened to our race? I am totally ashamed to call them &#8220;my race&#8221;.</p>

			<p>People are too focussed on the negatives of this situation and not on the positives.  Mexico is about to dissolve into anarchy.  What does this mean?  It means that the plans for a north american union have failed before any serious progress towards implementation can be made.  There is no legitimate state on our souther border to negotiate this with.  Before long, there will be no economy to engage this with anymore.  Canada is still viable but mexico is not.  With nothing to gain, those politicians hell bent on this are forced to give up their evil plans.</p>
<p>Violence on the border will force our country to intervene.  Our border WILL be militarized.  Not doing so is no longer an option.  Eventually, mexicans will enter a US town, murder and rape the people there and burn the whole town to the ground.  Public opinion will dramatically and permanently turn against all mexicans.  Our government will have to restrain americans from lynching mexicans, especially illegals.  It will no longer become possible to ignore the situation, and there won&rsquo;t be any payoff to doing so.</p>
<p>Before long, all visas from mexico will be canceled and all immigration will halt.</p>

			<p>The reason maybe the people depended upon the Feds to protect US.<br>
Our national safety is assigned to the Feds.  White people had rights recinded to minorities under the civil rights act. The laws have subordinated US to others. It is the greatest betrayal of a country ever.  Race is no reason to relinquish your heritage.  This is what government laws have put upon US.  Now we have no protection. Those assigned to protect US are mostly those who seek our demise. It is time to form the White  caucus. <br>
Sending millions to narco Mexico is insane. They will use the weapons here in USA to kill US.   The reps in DC must be heavy drinkers of overmedicated.  V</p>

			<p>Drug war is about to get hot again on the US side. American Intel better track this one better than they did islamist fundamentalism in the early 90&rsquo;s. </p>
<p>My opinion&hellip; no demand, no supply&hellip; someone is using the drugs and not just poor people either&hellip; </p>
<p>I honestly believe that if America wanted to end its drug problems it has the ability to do so&hellip;. but too many people not including the cartels are making too much money from it. </p>

			<p>Haven&rsquo;t we always known that Mexico is corrupt from the top down? This country will never be self-sustaining and will forever be an albatross to this country. By the time McCain or Obama gets out of office, the rest of that third world entity will be here. I wonder how there can ever be any question. If our leaders are aware of Title 8, Section 1325 of the U.S. Code, it plainly states that illegal entry is a federal crime. So, why is it ignored? Every last one of them need to be deported, then the pro-illegals can follow.</p>

			<p>There already are various news reports on the internet about Mexican drug cartel activity on this side of the border. Targeted violence. We have to end the magnet of jobs and welfare for illegals, secure the border, and begin deporting illegals. It&rsquo;s a place to start. </p>

			<p>Shall we pretend that the drug cartels and their money does not infect our own politicians? Such as a judgeship once mentioned by Paul Harvey in which a candidate spent millions to get a job that paid only $55,000 annual. Paul Harvey commented,<br>
 &#8220;Wellllllll&#8221;</p>
