						<p>If the Iowa State Fair is a celebration of our rural roots, could there possibly be too many concerts featuring country performers?</p>
<p>State legislator and Urban Dreams founder Wayne Ford says yes. Nothing against country, but the fair needs a major dose of diversity in the shows it books for the grandstand. Latinos and blacks, he says, are underrepresented.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>State Fair Manager Gary Slater brought some of this on himself. He set the bar high a few years ago when he lured Alicia Keys, and now he has to live up to his past success. Or Ford lets him hear about it through the media.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be honest. I&rsquo;ve never walked into the Iowa State Fair, glanced around at the 97 percent white crowd and said, &#8220;Hey, what this place needs is more black performers in the grandstand to reflect the growing diversity of the state.&#8221;</p>
<p>So maybe we need someone like Ford to point out the not-so-obvious to the somewhat oblivious.</p>
<p>Not to generalize, but you see more Latinos than black people at the fair. Do blacks stay away because the fair has little to offer them? Or would they show up in greater numbers if they had something to show up for?</p>
<p>When I asked a black guy I know why he doesn&rsquo;t go to the fair, he said, &#8220;I don&rsquo;t do livestock .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or tractor pulls.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But every other year or so, he makes a point of saying the State Fair could use a few more minority entertainers, a few hip-hop acts, a little variety. The State Fair is for all Iowans, he&rsquo;s saying, not just NASCAR fans.</p>
<p>The clientele, however, is mostly white. Much whiter than urban Iowa. About the same color as rural Iowa.</p>
<p>Maybe the situation is like the old Yogi Berra quote: &#8220;If the fans don&rsquo;t want to come to the ballpark, you can&rsquo;t stop them.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

			<p>Wayne Ford-sounds like a white name. Isn&rsquo;t he a little old to be suggesting a hip-hop anything? (It&rsquo;s amazing how generations of blacks join together to listen to and dance to the same kind of trashy rap music.)</p>
<p>Maybe if blacks had more to contribute than just hip-hop acts, it might have already been added. I&rsquo;ve never thought of &#8216;blacks&rsquo; within the context of a &#8216;state fair&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s the way it&rsquo;s always been. But, now the equality bandwagon is out of control and everyone wants a piece. </p>

			<p>This is an easy one to call.  Rural whites from Iowa listen to country &amp; western music and some classic rock &amp; roll.  Playing hip-hop at the state fair is going to infuriate the folks running the food concessions, because nobody is going to stay at the fair long enough to get hungry.</p>
<p>The good news is that Ford will be remembered as the one who turned the state fair into a debacle.</p>

			<p>IF you bring in hip-hop artists, I guarantee that the white attendance figures will drop WAY below 97%. They won&rsquo;t want to be attending another Valleyfair.</p>

			<p>Blacks either cannot or do not want to understand that white people have NO desire to be around them and their deviant behavior. I guarantee that if the fair brings in more minorities, whites will go elsewhere. This was the exact same situation in my state. One amusement park started to attract more blacks, and what do you know? Crime skyrocketed, and there have actually been shootings. Naturally, now the whites tend to go to the rival park.</p>

			<p>&#8216;would they show up in greater numbers if they had something to show up for?&rsquo; my first thought goes back to those &#8216;promotions&rsquo; by the police where people are notified that theyve &#8216;won&rsquo; some item like a color tv. when they show up to collect their prize, they get the handcuffs slapped on them for an outstanding warrant..another thought that this article reminds me of are the black guys with white girls pushing strollers at the illinois stae fair. once the kids get beyond walking age,  you never see Tyrone around anymore. </p>

			<p>It seems there&rsquo;s a whole class of busybodies out there who believe it&rsquo;s their purpose in life to seek out and destroy any organization, cultural event or situation where white people choose to congregate without &#8220;diversity&#8221;.  They must have a lot of hatred in their hearts against white people and they really should be more tolerant.</p>

			<p>&#8220;State fair is 97 percent white; black legislator wants hip hop acts.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is just another incident where it makes a lot of us wonder why blacks can&rsquo;t be happy being among their own kind, rather than constantly following whites around with their hands out begging.  </p>
<p>For a group of people who do almost nothing but complain about whites, they indicate evidence of pathology by wanting to include themselves in all white events, as if they&rsquo;re beset with masochistic tendencies, along with so many other shortcomings.  </p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the party crashers who are not wanted, and they&rsquo;re not invited, because of their bad behavior and loud mouths that continue on non-stop with childish, whining complaints that are absolutely baseless.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really embarassed for them.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Hey, what this place needs is more black performers in the grandstand to reflect the growing diversity of the state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In ten years half the festival will be populated by &#8220;people of colour&#8221; (i.e. blacks), while the other half will be an assortment of whiggers, with the usual stabbings/killings when the percentage of blacks at any festival exceeds 5%.</p>

			<p>Since when do country fairs have rap acts?  That would be equivalent of inviting a bunch of metal and punk bands and having mosh pits and beer tents. Couldn&rsquo;t they find some black blues musicians or something a little more appropriate for a country fair? </p>
<p>Are they really trying to make the fair more &#8220;inclusive&#8221; or are they just trying to punish all the haughty whites with their intact nuclear families, and middle class ways by blasting obscene rap &#8220;music&#8221; and flooding the park with trigger happy thugs looking to cause trouble?<br>

Let them set up the hip-hop stage as close to the entrance as possible and they can watch fair attendance plummet.</p>
<p>The cure for diversity is diversity. Let the white attendees get an earful and eyeful of what diversity truly is.</p>

Or the Merle hay Mall in Fords Des Moines Area, going black.. on the losing track &hellip; fewer and fewer whites willing ot put up with their disgusting behaviour IF they can avoid it</p>

			<p>State and county fairs are about rural culture.  They were started centuries ago in Europe as a way for farmers, herders, etc., to tout their produce and livestock, see the latest in farm technology and enjoy rubbing elbows with others of their ilk. This black garbage is urban based and has no place at such a fair.  They have their own black festivals which are exclusively black and lack &#8220;diversity.&#8221; Blacks are not interested in what goes on at state and county fairs; they just want to ruin one more thing that White people cherish. They won&rsquo;t stop, and the government and liberal media keep pushing them. By the way, Iowa needs to stop apologizing for its mostly White population. No one has ever accused Louisiana of being too black.    </p>

			<p>Blacks ruined the carnival at Milwaukee&rsquo;s Summerfest.  Summerfest is 98 percent white with 98 percent of the blacks hanging around the carnival section.  I guess that they got bored with it and went on a wilding rampage beating every white person they could find inside and outside of the Summerfest grounds.  Milwaukee pulled the carnival and gave the blacks no reason to go back there.  It is interesting that supposedly grown people would be interested in a children&rsquo;s entertainment area.  Go figure.</p>
<p>Milwaukee brought this on itself with its way too generous welfare benefits and rolling out the red carpet to every freeloader in the nation.  It went from being one of the nicest and safest cities in the nation to one to avoid.  It still has its Polish and German sections but it is saddening to see such great neighborhoods fall into disrepair with blacks as their tenants.  I hope that the day comes when Milwaukee will be reclaimed for the German, Polish, and other great European immigrants who made it into a once great city.</p>

			<p>So far every time a state fair &#8220;diversifies&#8221; it is only a short matter of time before it turns into chaos.  Security is the first thing to be under-realized as thugs sweep through.  At some point we&rsquo;re just going to have to say &#8220;shut the hell up, sometimes we actually WANT a white-only affair and we should have that right&#8221;, after all, every other race seems to except white people in America.  </p>

			<p>In a way, Iowa brought this on itself. How in the world did a black guy get to be state rep. in IOWA??? It would be like blacks electing a White man for mayor of Detroit. And I&rsquo;m sure a country-western band would be VERY welcome at a predominately black gathering!!! I&rsquo;d like to set something like that up and then have a hidden camera set up to film how blacks would react to it[and to also heip I.D. the black thugs that attacked the C.W. band]. I remember awhile back reading about a black cowboy in Montana who sang country and rap. He said that he goes all over to different C.W. clubs and does half his show country-half rap so as to expose people to different cultures. When asked how many rap clubs he takes his act to, he said &#8220;none!&#8221;</p>

			<p>When the audience is 97% black, such as a recent story about NY social service clients in the news, the call is to have the workers look more like the clients they are serving; when the audience is 97% white they say the we need to highlight and bring to the forefront the minority. </p>
<p>They should book one of those hair-bands that did a rap song in the 80&rsquo;s instead, Aerosmith, Anthrax, Ozzy Osborne or even Back Street Boys, Beastie Boys or Linkin Park. We&rsquo;ll go with, you have to represent the audience you are entertaining. Anything  less would just be evil. </p>

			<p>It strikes me that &#8220;Urban Dreams founder Wayne Ford&#8221; is trying to foist his beloved hip hop trash noise on the wrong crowd. These folks don&rsquo;t WANT &#8220;urban dreams&#8221; or the urban nightmares that go along with them either. </p>

<p>No, there will still be unwitting white girls who have no experience of black conduct and there will be the usual rapes and murders with the attendant &#8220;baby mommas&#8221; and broken families in that area of Iowa. The area will NEVER recover.</p>

			<p>Nothing is ever improved by the presence of blacks; everything is improved by their absence.  Every white person knows this, in his/her bones, no matter how careful they may be not to say it.  Bring in blacks, &amp; whites will find a reason not to attend.  Everything will go downhill, slowly or rapidly. </p>

			<p>Have some of you ever seen a &#8220;Hip-Hop&#8221; concert audience? It isn&rsquo;t all black by any means. Don&rsquo;t be too certain that young whites wouldn&rsquo;t line up in droves to lap up this post-MTV ghetto noise! The town I live in(though in New York) is very rural and agri-oriented&hellip;and probably 90+% White. Every car driven by white teens I encounter is booming all manner of &#8220;Urban&#8221; music(ie. Hip-Hop, R&B;, etc.)at top volume. </p>
<p>I hope some of you are correct in that Whites would reject this invasive Rap proposition wholesale&hellip;but I&rsquo;m not so sure. </p>

			<p>I thought a state fair was supposed to be family entertainment.  Who in their right mind would bring their minor children to an event to hear misogynistic rap &#8220;songs&#8221; about people getting shot?</p>
<p>There are events that are expected to be appropriate entertainment for parents with young children, like state fairs.  There are events that are manifestly not, like R-rated movies and rap concerts.</p>
<p>If I took my family to an event where I was expecting traditional civilized values and instead heard hip-hop, I would leave immediately and demand my money back on my way out the gate.  Once home, I would write a letter to the organizers explaining why I would never be returning.</p>
<p>No child of mine will be allowed to possess any hip-hop music until they turn 18.  Nobody of ANY age will ever be allowed to play it inside my home.</p>

			<p>Blacks simply can&rsquo;t stand for whites to have anything to themselves, where they can keep company among themselves. If they don&rsquo;t get their way, they cry foul and scream racism. Then Sharpton or Jackson swoop in for a shakedown. About the only group I have never seen them try that with are white biker clubs, and truth be told, I think they are too scared to mess with them. Bringing hip hop to this Iowa fairground, would be like holding a punk rock concert in a retirement home. It is utterly ridiculous, and only intended to stir things up.</p>

			<p>I see an earlier post mentions Memphis as a place where Mr. Ford could find more black amusement. Not any more. </p>
<p>The Memphis Fair, held at the same location for 150 years, was finally swamped and ruined by blacks. The fair is supposed to move to a location outside Memphis, but it may not reopen at all. The towns interested in hosting the fair don&rsquo;t want to attract blacks from Memphis. Several years ago, the amusement park nearby was shut down due to blacks and their unique &#8220;talents&#8221;.  </p>

			<p>I once heard a story of some Confederate re-enactors that marched in a parade in Georgia. After the parade was over, the re-enactors were headed back to their vehicles when they were confronted with a gang of black thugs who wanted to ruff&rsquo;em up a bit. The leader of the Confederate group, which was fully  accoutered by the way, yells &#8220;FIX BAYONNETS&#8221; That put an end to the confrontation right then and there. </p>

Hopefully there are enough of them left to ignore the ramblings of this whining politician.  If not, the demise of the famous Iowa State Fair is clearly on the horizon.</p>

<p>In ten years half the festival will be populated by &ldquo;people of colour&rdquo; (i.e. blacks)<br>

<p>Exactly.  As always, &#8220;Diversity&#8221; is just the first step to white elimination and black takeover.  Once started, it never stops at just a little. We&rsquo;ve seen it so many times before. Doesn&rsquo;t anybody else notice this?  Can people be really that brainwashed? Once blacks get a little, they&rsquo;ll want more. For them, there&rsquo;s no such thing as enough until they have it all. <br>

			<p>If the fairgoers are 97% white, it must be a really nice place to go, a place where families can feel safe.  Now it&rsquo;s going to be ruined, just like so many other parks, fairs and attractions in the US.  After all, whites just can&rsquo;t be allowed to have anything to themselves!  &#8220;Diversity&#8221; must be forced on them.  Pretty soon that fair will be a place of gangs, litter, fights, shootings, and drugs.  Whites will not dare go.  Before long, the fair will be shut down completely.  Mark my words.  I&rsquo;ve seen it happen time and again, starting with Riverview Park in Chicago when I was a child.</p>
<p>I live in Southern California now, and even our major amusement parks are being destroyed.  Disneyland used to be a great, safe place to visit, where most guests were courteous and free to enjoy themselves.  Now it&rsquo;s filled with rude Mexicans and other third-worlders pushing and shoving.  My friend who used to work at Disneyland said the employees dreaded Sunday and called it &#8220;Mexican day&#8221; because that was the Mexicans&rsquo; favorite day to show up at the park, and they are horrible to deal with.  Disneyland and other parks also have gangs of loud, rude blacks cutting in line and causing trouble.  As parks such as Disneyland fill up with minorities who drive whites away, how long before the parks eliminate such &#8220;white&#8221; attractions as &#8220;Main Street U.S.A.&#8221; because they don&rsquo;t appeal to minorities?</p>
<p>Everything white, safe, pleasant and fun is being destroyed in this country.  And we whites just put up with it&hellip;we let them take it from us!</p>

			<p>I think it is a great idea to bring in some rap artists to Iowa. They need some Diversity and as we all know, Dieversity is Strength. While their at it they might as well have a Bring Your White Corn Fed Daughter to Date a Black Brother Booth. </p>
<p>Sarcasm aside, what exactly is Wayne Ford&rsquo;s argument? Supply and demand usually regulates what performers are brought to an area. I&rsquo;m sure in inner city areas there is not much demand for Country Music-so what? </p>

			<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be a PHD to understand that when the blacks come into an area or a venue the majority of whites will move on. They don&rsquo;t want to be within this droopy draws, ebonic, hip hop nation. White vote with their feet they don&rsquo;t want to lower themselves into confrontations with these animalistic blacks. The fair had an attendance record last year of 1,000,000 increase black attendance and watch the TOTAL figures fall dramaticly. It irritates the blacks that most whites Don&rsquo;t Care what blacks call them (honkie, cracker, whatever) they just don&rsquo;t care because they place little value on any blacks opinion on anything, including cute little nick names for white people.</p>

The Station Director, a black man, and therefore someone that could be candid explained that Whites were the ones that contributed at fund raising drives so could determine the style of music played. Imagine the insolence of expecting Whites to pay to have Public Radio play Black Music. But now that I think about it that&rsquo;s how things in principle and practice generally are.</p>
<p>Most older White folks leave their radio at one station. They would desert a station that played any mixture of White and black music. People like a station where they can count on a style of their own.</p>

			<p>New Jersey had a beautiful amusement park called &#8216;Palisades Amusement Park&rsquo; located on the Hudson River just south of the George Washington Bridge.  Originally it barred blacks from entry.  Later it allowed them in the park but not in the swimming pool.  Shortly after they were forced to lift all restictions the usual happened.  Their behavior and crime drove the whites away.  People who lived near the Park complaimed that the blacks from Harlem came over by bus but went home by car.  The place closed a couple of years later.</p>

			<p>Scheduling events that target black and latinos will force whites to stay away from the fair.  That and there will be some level of violence and mayhem once non-whites begin showing up in greater numbers.  </p>
<p>This makes by blood boil.  Whites don&rsquo;t demand representation at black and latino cultural events, yet they rudely push their way into traditionally white cultural events like this Iowa fair.  I guarantee if whites arrogantly tried to make a presence at a minority festival they would be threatened with bodily harm by the angelic minorities.  Whites, as always, passively acquiesce  to the demands of non-whites which further emboldens them.      </p>

<p>True, though I have several presets. Back in 1999 the Orlando &#8220;oldies&#8221; station suddenly (and with no notice) switched to a &#8220;black oldies&#8221; format. The howls of outrage could be heard for miles around! The owners claimed they had &#8220;market research&#8221; to support the change. Well, that research must have been done in Parramore (Orlando&rsquo;s crime-ridden black ghetto), Pine Hills (a formerly prosperous white community west of town, now a black-infested hovel nicknamed &#8220;Crime Hills&#8221;) and the county jail. Not surprisingly, the black format lasted only a few months. </p>
<p>In another &#8220;sign of the apocalypse,&#8221; a few months ago the Orlando AM sports-talk station switched to Spanish-language.</p>
<p>Someone (1:22 PM on July 19) bemoaned the lack of decent black music these days. To quote Smokey Robinson, I second that emotion! While I never cared for Sly or Hendrix, I loved the Platters, the Fifth Dimension, the Pointer Sisters and the Supremes. Then there were great soloists like Roberta Flack,  Sarah Vaughan, and Nat &#8220;King&#8221; and Natalie Cole, just to name a few. None of them would demean their talents with &#8220;rap&#8221; or &#8220;hip-hop&#8221; garbage.</p>

<p>Here in Canada, the last of the White oriented gatherings would probably be the Highland Games. Diversity arrived at these events and the atmosphere is not quite the same. I even saw a Black wearing a kilt at one years ago.</p>

			<p>Why is hip hop still clinging to the cultural landscape of this country anyhow?  It&rsquo;s been around for at least 20 years now and it&rsquo;s stale and passé not to mention it all sounds the same.  Is it cool now to listen to the music your momma&rsquo;s baby daddy listened to?</p>

			<p>It is the Mid-South Fair, not the Memphis Fair, and I think it will be moving to Tunica, Miss.</p>
<p>When I was little girl, my brothers and I would go downtown Memphis to watch the Cotton Carnival parade.  Our mother would drop us off and pick us up later at the Mid-way (carnival rides).<br>
It was a good family event.  Now there is no more carnival.  Instead there is Memphis in May that is geared to adults.  But I don&rsquo;t go to downtown Memphis anymore.</p>

			<p>Superman wondered: <i>How did this guy get elected to legislature in a 97% WHITE population? Obviously, he&rsquo;s not representing his constituents.</i></p>
<p>I just did some checking. While the article doesn&rsquo;t say Ford is from Des Moines, that&rsquo;s a good bet as the town is about 8% black. It&rsquo;s likely the Iowa legislature was forced at judicial gunpoint to gerrymander a black district for that 8%. (Interestingly, Ames and Iowa City are only 2.65% and 3.75% black respectively, despite being college towns.) </p>

			<p>Blacks either cannot or do not want to understand that white people have NO desire to be around them and their deviant behavior.</p>

<p>Blacks are the same way, they don&rsquo;t want to be around Whites. However, Blacks know that if they show up and act like animals they will soon have the place to themselves. </p>
<p>If they want more Blacks at the State Fair, just do like they do on election day, bus them in. Even if they have to go out of state to get them<br>

			<p>I hear and read about how whites are not in favor of this.What I also hear is we will just run away and hide.All the whites will leave and eventally the fair will be ruined.I think it is time to start drawing lines in the sand and make a stand.We as whites have to stop running away and we need to have guts to survive.Are we all going to end up in a covered wagon surrounded by our enemies.RISE UP WHITE NATION!</p>

			<p>One of the institutions targeted for destruction by the Communist Manifesto is the family unit.  You see this every day in the fact that so many children think more of their government school indoctrinators than they do their parents.  The longer we wait to deal with our domestic enemies and their minority lackeys the more force will be required to set things right&hellip;<br>
