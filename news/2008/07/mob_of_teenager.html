<h1>Mob of Teenagers Attacks British Police Over Litter Row</h1>
									<div align="left">
						<i>AFP, July 18, 2008</i></font> 
					</div>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Two British police officers were injured after some 30 teenagers, some in school uniform, attacked them &#8220;like animals&#8221; after they asked a girl to pick up a piece of litter, officers said Friday.</p>
<p>One of the policemen was treated in hospital for bite wounds after the attack in a shopping precinct in Croydon, south London, Wednesday. The officers, aged 34 and 29, were on sick leave with bruising and knee injuries.</p>
<p>The teenage girl was initially asked to pick up a piece of litter. She did so but immediately dropped it again. When asked to pick it up again she became aggressive, and a group of teenagers gathered round and attacked them.</p>
<p>A number of men in their 30s and 40s and several women joined in the attack. All those involved were black, London&rsquo;s Metropolitan Police said.</p>
<p>One of the officers who was bitten, and is now recovering at home, said: &#8220;They were acting like animals, but I hate using the term &lsquo;animals&rsquo; because they would not do that. Animals have a reason for doing something.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is just nonsense violence. It is difficult to think that they could do something like this &mdash; and to a policeman.&#8221;</p>
<p>A 15-year-old girl was arrested at the scene on suspicion of assault and bailed. When her parents arrived to pick her up, they complained about having their summer holiday interrupted, one of the attacked officers added.</p>
<p>The issue of youth violence has been highlighted by a string of fatal knife attacks in London and elsewhere in recent months, and was a hotly-debated theme during the campaign for the capital&rsquo;s mayoralty in May.</p>
<p>Separately, a 13-year-old boy was being questioned after being arrested on suspicion of involvement in the murder of a 17-year-old youth who was shot dead last week as he went for a haircut in Sheffield.<br>

			<p>What&rsquo;s that (Sir) Trevor Phillips? Not enough black representation on BBC TV? Not near enough of them being shown as dignified professionals? How about showing them as they really are in the UK? Grown black men and women biting policemen because a black teenager is too  spoiled and lazy to pick up her own litter. This is the true face of Africans in the UK</p>

			<p>Waiting for Trevor Phillips to chime in, to tell us how this was the fault of the cops.  We&rsquo;ll all find out that using the word &#8220;animals&#8221; to describe this mob attack was far worse than the mob attack itself.  Animated by visages of slavery, of course.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m surprised they were allowed to print that. I don&rsquo;t see my local paper ever being that frank (or honest). In fact, I wonder how much Gary news it leaves out simply because they don&rsquo;t want the entire paper being taken over by crime news from just one city.</p>

<p>The hard facts of life regarding &#8220;crowd control&#8221; with blacks, seems to be utterly lost on whites; the last group of whites to fully grasp how to deal with their spontaneous pack attack proclivities, was the South African police and security forces in the 1980s. Once they begin an attack or riot, the only method of &#8220;calming&#8221; them is to ruthlessly shoot down a few, so that the rest will wildly disperse hooting and howling back to their holes and perches. </p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t rocket science here folks, it is simply drawing a line and spelling out consequences for those &#8220;people&#8221; when they cross it.</p>
<p>End of story!<br>

			<p>Ahh&hellip;  But Diversity is Beautiful, is it not?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t beleive what England is now having to &#8220;tolerate&#8221;&hellip;  </p>
<p>Sounds like the southern part of London is now a No-Go Zone even for the police officers.  </p>
<p>How much more must the English &#8220;tolerate&#8221; before they finally stand up for themselves?  </p>

<p>The fact that the PC press is referring to the non-white thugs as &#8220;youth,&#8221; indicates very clearly that much worse conditions have to yet evolve before the elites are going to be ready to face the truth of what their diversity calamity has wrought them.</p>
<p>Of course it will get worse.</p>

Being around non-whites is like holding a ticking time bomb. It&rsquo;s going to go off but you&rsquo;re just not sure when or how big the explosion will be.</p>
<p>This is one of the most frustrating aspects of being around non-whites. They bring their foul and obnoxious activities with them and expect to be welcomed with loving arms and treated like royalty. How dare we expect them to live by our standards!</p>

			<p>That&rsquo;s odd.  The BBC news on PBS almost invariably begins its typical third world-focused broadcast with some bit about a black African event, and yet this incident, which happened right on its doorstep, is ignored.     </p>

			<p>It used to be, &#8220;See Naples and die!&#8221;.  Now it is see Britain and die, in the streets, stabbed, shot or kicked to death.   Born there, I have not lived there for 34 years as I am now resident Spain after 24 years in South Africa, but I would need to carry a gun there in modern Britain for self-protection as we did (legally) under the then new black government.   Where can we escape from these psychopaths?</p>

			<p> I remember spending some time in London back in the mid 1970&rsquo;s. It was still a great city, very clean and the population was friendly.  I was only 12 but I traveled all over town on the Underground alone and always felt safe.  What has possibly happened to you people that you are willing to accept and even enable the destruction of your country?  </p>

One must view these increasing attacks in Britain against civilization that are being directed against their cops with mixed emotions. After all, they are on the front lines enforcing Governmental policies that make such &#8220;animalistic&#8221; outrages inevitable. </p>

			<p>When was the last time a mob of &#8220;elderlies&#8221; attacked policemen for stopping them from littering?  By the way, aren&rsquo;t most armies made up of soldiers that sans uniforms would be called &#8220;youths&#8221;.</p>

			<p>This is slightly off topic, but how come abuse by non-white police officers on white civilians is completely blacked out by the media.</p>
<p>In Salem, Oregon, officer Antonio Gonzalez shot and killed unarmed Irish national Andrew Hanlon who was visiting family. It was a big story in Ireland, but unheard of in the U.S. After being acquitted, Antonio Gonzalez went on to sexually assault a white teenager afterword. The story was only carried in Salem&rsquo;s Statesman Journal.</p>
<p>Also in Salem Oregon, black officer Sterling Alexander sexually assaulted a white teenager. Again, only the local Salem newspaper ran the story.</p>
<p>The media hypes up news when white officers so much as beat a black lowlife criminal, and there are riots. If one white officer EVER sexually assaulted a black or hispanic teen, it would be nationwide news.<br>
But they stay silent when underqualified, power tripping minority police officers attack whites.</p>

			<p>I received this from a friend in the UK today</p>
<p>&#8220;And did you know that multi-cultural Britain is &#8220;enjoying&#8221; a baby boom?<br>
In a seriously over-populated world I kid you not.<br>
 <br>
Women across the country of all ages are contributing to population growth with more babies being born now than in the 70&rsquo;s.<br>
More than one if four however, are born to foreign mother according to official figures. <br>
 <br>
Only a third of the 20 000 babies were born to British mothers, the rest to women originally from overseas!<br>
And don&rsquo;t you love the fractional children we have!<br>
Foreign women tend to have 2.5 children. Those from Bangladesh have 3.9 and from Pakistani women it rises to almost 5.  British women on the other hand only clock in at 1.7.<br>
The Office for National Statistics has predicted that the population in the UK could rise to 71 million by 2031 with migrants and their UK born children accounting for 69 percent of the growth&#8221;.<br>

			<p>The Anglo British have progressively outdone themselves in this sado masochistic orgy of diversity. They have invited the most retrograde human genetics into a country of what was once a hansome refined populace. What is this white mans disease of self destruction inviting the cains and hammites of the world to sleep with their daughters and attack baboon style their men? Only the misplaced compassion of confused whites would promote a race that nature has stamped for extinction!</p>

			<p>When whites are being driven out, and even killed in countries like Zimbabwe, for not being indigenous, even though they have been there for generations, and were producing quality farm goods. Why is that Africans are being allowed to immigrate to Europe in such massive numbers? Seems the only thing most seem to be producing is delinquent thuggish, offspring?</p>

<p>So did I - partly because it had a black &#8216;feel&rsquo; to it and partly because it has received little attention on UK TV.</p>

			<p>Not so very long ago Croydon was a smart and prosperous self-contained little town, that was caught up in the Greater london conurbation and was incorporated into the GLC in about 1964.It was quintessential English suburbia of the type Betjeman wrote about.<br>
   It was, historically, the leading market-town for that part of north Surrey and since the 1960s it grew up into a very big retail center, perhaps rivalling London&rsquo;s West End.<br>
  As recently as 20 years ago nary a black face was to be seen on Croydon High Street.Lately, however, it has been inundated with huge numbers of &#8216;asylum seekers&rsquo; and the overspill of Thornton Heath, a nearby suburb with a heavy black population.<br>
   Croydon College, once a respected technical school, is now the site of pitched battles between blacks and Somalis.</p>

			<p>The report on the attack by the left-wing,liberal national broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), naturally omitted to mention that the mob, including the girls, was all black, but the local paper had the courage and the professionalism to do so.  The two actual reports presented in an amusing way can be read at:</p>
<p>http://www.bnp.org.uk/2008/07/competition-time-can-you-spot-whats-missing/.</p>
<p>The credo of the Press and media is supposed to be the reporting of the news factually with no slants to follow personal political leanings.  As the BBC is financed by a compulsory tax each year that amounts to many millions of dollars(if you have a TV set, you must pay it even if you have modified te set to not receive the BBC channels), thsi makes this failure to report properly an even bigger sin.</p>
<p>A respected leading British politician, Enoch Powell prophesied in 1968 in public speeches the that the allowing of multitudes of especially black immigrants into Britain would result in the streets of Britain running red with blood. Looks like he was right with all the stabbings and shootings being currently committed by mostly these people. Almost a daily event now, and yet like in the USA, they are such a  small percentage of the population.</p>
<p>The actual speech can be read by Googling Enoch Powell and Wikipedia.   He is proving to be so right but at the time he was ostracised by the &#8220;useful fools&#8221; even in government.</p>

			<p>So, originally the police mentioned the race. That information was not carried on other news accounts, leading me to suspect that the information was deliberately and intentionally suppressed.</p>

			<p>Knowing the area that this incident occured, and hearing the circumstances that sparked it, my immediate thought was &#8220;Hmmm, bet you any money you like they are black&#8221;.  Sho &#8216;nuff, seeing the video footage that a member of the public took, this was the right guess.  This is how race riots start.  The sheer arrogance of these &#8220;people&#8221; is breathtaking. This behaviour is being &#8220;aped&#8221; (pun intended) by more and more non-Black youths.</p>

			<p><i>&hellip;so that the rest will wildly disperse hooting and howling back to their holes and perches<i> </i></i></p>
<p>Thankyou for that John, I had to laugh even though this report is a true nightmare.<br>
 Speaking of Soweto, I was watching that show the other night and for the first time I found out that white people had been murdered by the &#8216;schoolchildren&rsquo; prior to the police taking action. I&rsquo;d always believed the police just fired on peaceful, marching crowds(like they do ya know!). I was quite surprised by the frankness of the show in this regard. Of course, the programme soon resumed its promotion of the heroic nature of the &#8216;children&rsquo;. <br>
Back to the situation in Britain, what more can we say about this once happy country?  It&rsquo;s a tragedy, and I think as it moves further and further towards chaos, Sharia Law or some other form of totalitarianism will be promoted as the only answer. Leftists of all shades will welcome this and may even come to some agreement with their fellow travellers in control the Muslims. I feel sure that there will be not some few Britons who will welcome this, if they are presented with the choice of living with gangs of feral people roaming the streets, burning, looting, murdering etc. or the law and order that totalitarian regimes impose, survival instincts take a lot of beating. Whatever the outcome, I don&rsquo;t see a return to normalcy anytime soon. <br>
Thanks again for the laugh.<br>

Our policy makers have swallowed the lie that &#8216;racism&rsquo; is the cause of all social, political, and economic unrest. They have been told, &#8216;end racism, and associated problems will solve themselves overnight&rsquo;.</p>
<p>People who have the sense to think for themselves know &#8216;racism&rsquo; is not the problem. The problem is certain groups of people.</p>

			<p>Regarding Mr Digby&rsquo;s comment<br>
Yes Croydon is still mainly white, the southern surburbs like sanderstead are almost exclusively white. The northern surburbs like Norwood and Norbury (home of the infamous Derek Bentley and Christopher Craig and now yardies) has a mixed ethnic population. Thornton Heath&rsquo;s crime is mainly black on black, I&rsquo;ve always felt quite safe there. However Croydon is where the world&rsquo;s refugees claims for asylum are processed, the Home Office buildings are the main employer in central Croydon.  </p>

			<p>Themost amazing to me about this is the innocuous beginning of the fracas. Was a fellow member of the Tribe being beaten by numerous police? Was a white drunk driver responsible for a black childs death? Any of these or similar ocurrances may serve to exonerate the mob, but all this for a request to pick up a piece of trash? <br>
The story doesn&rsquo;t give any details, but I&rsquo;d be willing to bet she was asked to do so because the officer saw her drop it on the ground in the first place!</p>

<p>The leftists you mention should take heed of the Vietnamese Viet Cong experience. Once America was run out of the country, the VC held their arms open to joyously greet their fraternal Communist brethren, only to get the hosing of a lifetime by the North Vietnamese. A lot of the VC ended up on leaky boats or in re-education camps.</p>

			<p>I home based with an English family in Croydon in 1988 while I toured the British Isles for two months.  Croydon then was a nice little town/suburb south of London.  It was pretty quiet and non-threatening.  But the signs were already there and I recall well what Robert said to me one day while we were on his roof patching some bricks on his 300 year old restored home; &#8220;We used to have a settled society, but they had to ruin it.&#8221; 1988!  The poor man must be really disilllusioned about his England by now!</p>

<p>Yes, I can verify it.  The victim&rsquo;s friends said that he was a gentle guy who wrote poetry and liked to read.  It has been on tv in Portland a couple times.</p>

			<p>Love it.  Perhaps the police will have a rethink about the merits of being PC to the point of self-destruction.  Reductio Ad absurdum (or something like that).  Hope this story chills the liberals as well (in the white, not the black sense of the word).  The police can&rsquo;t even defend themselves never mind THEM  as their utopian experiment goes haywire.  In fact, it has just this minute occured to me: the Neo-liberal fascists, at the start of their multi-racial experiment, must have had at the back of their minds the possiblity that the testement of human experience may actually turn out to have some veracity; that perhaps people of different cultures would not mix; and that the safety net would be the police. Would they have ever embarked on this insane scheme without the back up of a security force to protect them if things got nasty?  I think not.  Even they don&rsquo;t have that much faith in &#8216;the family of man&rsquo;.  I&rsquo;d like to do a multi-cultural experiment on British Neo-liberals.  It would involve a hurricane, a sports stadium in New Orleans and no police.</p>

			<p>Why couldn&rsquo;t the Brit&rsquo;s have learned from the bitter mistake of the Americans for not returning the Africans to their native land at the end of the Civil War? Instead they INVITED it upon themselves! What reason did they have to think things would have turned out any differently?? Lincoln had &#8220;repatriation&#8221;(shipping the Blacks back to Africa) in his plans to put the country back together. <br>

			<p>Compassion for the black race is as much a waste of time as having compassion for a snake. </p>
<p>Our ancestors gave use fables and parables to impart a bit of wisdom into our thick skulls. None better than the lady and the snake.</p>
<p>A lady finds a snake fozen in the snow, she shows compassion and take the snake into her house so that she might warm it and nurse it back to health. When the snake is all better it bites her, a fatal wound. She ask, Why? The snake&rsquo;s answer,&#8221;I&rsquo;m a snake&#8221;. </p>
<p>Sure the black man is a pitifull creature but does that make him deserving of compassion? Just like the snake, once healthy and strong he will act as nature intended. He will bite you.</p>
<p>If our ancestors were so smart just how did we become so dumb? We started to letting others do our thinking for us. You won&rsquo;t find that fable in the Bible but that doesn&rsquo;t make it any less true. </p>

			<p>&#8220;It has been on tv in Portland a couple times.&#8221;</p>
<p>Im sure it has, but I never saw the TV coverage. The point is that even if it was one white cop who sexually assaulted a black teen or shot an unarmed black man, it would be nationwide news.</p>
<p>But here we have a black officer who sexually assaults a teen, and a hispanic cop who shoots and kills an unnarmed white tourist, who proceeds to sexually assault a white teen afterward. All this happened within the course of a year in a small relatively white city.</p>
<p>Im not saying all non-white officers are bad or unqualified or corrupt. But many are and contribute to the breakdown of our justice system.</p>
<p>The country would be in absolute chaos had they been white cops with non-white victims.</p>

			<p>Here in America I have been writing Congressmen over the black lych mob beating phenomenon. I can&rsquo;t understand why nothing is done, the feds crushed the very same thing in the deep south when it went the other way(white on black that is)</p>

			<p>This doesn&rsquo;t surprise me. When blacks attack, it is common behavior for them to attack in packs, obviously no different there than from here in the US.</p>

			<p>This reminds me of an incident that took place in Boston in March 2004.  I was in a tunnel connecting the South End T stop and the Copley Mall, with three friends.  Three black girls were walking the other way and one dropped a Papa Gino&rsquo;s cup on the floor, they saw us looking at them questioningly and started muttering &#8220;what up, why you lookin&hellip;&#8221; in their barely understandable version of English.  My friends meekly ignored them but I looked at the one who dropped the cup and said, like a teacher would say to a child:  &#8220;you should pick up that cup and put it in a trash can&#8221;.  The look I got was priceless, this look of initial shock, then the animal-like behavior started, them screaming at me (as they were walking away of course), they used a racial slur against me, which I wish I had reported (they used the &#8220;w-trash&#8221; word, then, from a safe distance, one of the other animal-like blacks threw her cup at me, which came nowhere near hitting me, which was lucky for her because if it had, I would have run across the street to the station and met up with them as they entered, and made a scene.</p>
<p>That incident made me realize, it wasn&rsquo;t just black males, it&rsquo;s all of them.  </p>

			<p><i>Croydon College, once a respected technical school, is now the site of pitched battles between blacks and Somalis<i><br>
 posted by Kenelm Digby</i></i></p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t surprise me to read that Mr. Digby, I attended the Art School at Croydon College in the 1960s, it was chocka with Communists back then, one of my most vivid memories is of two Communists guys inscribing a hammer and sickle on a girls chest as retribution for some slight. Nonetheless, in those days Croydon was pretty safe and respectable even though it had its share of teddyboys and the Craig/Bentley rooftop murder of PC Sidney Miles. (That awful anti-death penalty film &#8220;Let him have it&#8221; was based on it; less than 60 seconds devoted to the death of PC Miles of course. Christopher Craig now lives happily in Dunstable, Beds). Croydon was quite a respectable town but even more up market were Purley and Purley Oaks. I passed through recently, they have become downmarket immigrant filled slums, full of &#8216;pound&rsquo; shops and fried chicken takeouts. We know who to thank.<br>

			<p>  I heard that the BBC in England calls anyone who&rsquo;s against the Muslim invasion, nazi&rsquo;s. There&rsquo;s the problem, three letters, BBC. The media in all it&rsquo;s glory, trying to destroy another white, christian nation.</p>

			<p>A respected leading British politician, Enoch Powell prophesied in 1968 in public speeches the that the allowing of multitudes of especially black immigrants into Britain would result in the streets of Britain running red with blood. Looks like he was right with all the stabbings and shootings being currently committed by mostly these people. Almost a daily event now, and yet like in the USA, they are such a small percentage of the population.</p>
<p>No matter what the U.S. or U.K. governments say, I REFUSE to believe that blacks are only 10% of the respective populations. I believe it is more like 45% in the U.S. and certaianly much greater than advertised in the U.K. I would also bet that the blacks that attacked the police officers were also MUSLIMS! anybody know if my suspicion is correct??</p>

			<p>Skip  the uk population in total is close to 80 million but the goverment and the BBC put out an out an official figure of 60 million. Under the ruling labour goverments open borders policy some 10 million have been added to the UK population.Some are from the enlarged EU such as Poland,however 80% are from the Indian sub-continent and Africa. Providing lots more labour voting Muslim voters</p>
