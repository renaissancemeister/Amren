<h1>Civil-Rights Election</h1>
					<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peter Kirsanow, National Review Online, July 9, 2008</i></p>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Should Barack Obama win this fall, 2009 will a busy year for enacting civil-rights legislation &mdash; perhaps the busiest since 1964.</p>
<p>Numerous civil-rights bills have either passed the House or are pending in various committees, just waiting for a Democrat to be elected to the White House. Traditional civil-rights groups anticipate that without the threat of veto, expanded Democratic majorities in Congress will pass a number of these bills in the first few months of 2009. Here are just a few of the bills likely to be signed by a President Obama within the next year.</p>
<p><b>Reparations</b><br>
<i>Commission to Study Reparations Proposals for African-Americans Act.</i></p>
<p>Rep. John Conyers has introduced this legislation every year since 1989, but with a Democrat in the White House and significant congressional majorities, this bill finally has an opportunity to be enacted. The purpose of the bill is to create a commission to study the impact of slavery in the United States and recommend appropriate remedies, including an apology to and reparations for blacks. The House Judiciary Committee on the Constitution held hearings related to the bill in December 2007. The bill is modeled after that which granted reparations to Japanese-Americans interned during World War II.</p>
<p><i>The Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act (&#8220;Akaka Bill&#8221;).</i></p>
<p>The Akaka Bill would create a separate race-based government for persons of Native Hawaiian descent. The race-based government would have the authority to exercise broad sovereign powers, including the ability to negotiate with the federal government concerning criminal and civil jurisdiction, civil-rights protections, and the transfer of lands and national resources. The bill would permit Native Hawaiians to sue the federal government for claims related to the 1893 overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom. Its supporters concede that ultimately, secession is a possibility.</p>
<p>{snip} Sen. Obama, a former resident of Hawaii, has pledged his unqualified support for the bill and vowed to sign it if he becomes president.</p>
<p><i>The Guam World War II Loyalty Recognition Act.</i></p>
<p>The bill provides $126 million for reparations to residents of Guam who suffered personal injury, forced labor, or internment at the hands of the Japanese during World War II. {snip}</p>
<p><b>Comparable Worth</b><br>
<i>Fair Pay Act of 2007.</i></p>
<p>The bill would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act to prohibit discrimination in the payment of wages on account of sex, race, or national origin. {snip} Sen. Obama is one of the sponsors of the bill.</p>
<p>Obama has also sponsored the Paycheck Fairness Act that significantly narrows the circumstances under which an employer may use the &#8220;bona-fide factor other than sex&#8221; affirmative defense in sex-discrimination cases involving wage disparities.</p>
<p><b>Sexual Orientation/Gender Identity</b><br>
<i>Employment Non-Discrimination Act.</i></p>
<p>As originally proposed (H.R. 2015), (&#8220;ENDA&#8221;) would have amended Title VII to forbid discrimination in employment on the basis of actual or perceived sexual orientation and gender identity &mdash; adding two new federally protected classes of persons. {snip}</p>
<p>A compromise bill (H.R. 3685) was introduced in September 2007. {snip} Senator Obama has stated that he supports the expansive version of ENDA that includes gender identity.</p>
<p><i>Local Law Enforcement Hate Crime Protection Act of 2007.</i></p>
<p>The bill would make federal crimes of certain violent conduct where such conduct is motivated by the actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability of the victim. The Bush Administration issued a veto threat. Sen. Obama is one of the sponsors.</p>
<p><b>Housing Discrimination</b><br>
<i>Housing Fairness Act of 2007.</i></p>
<p>The bill directs HUD to conduct a national testing program to detect, document, measure and assess the degree to which individual renters, home buyers, or mortgage borrowers are discriminated against based on race, color, religion, sex, familial status, disability, or national origin.</p>
<p><b>Voting Rights</b><br>
<i>Ex-Offenders Voting Rights Act of 2007.</i></p>
<p>The bill would automatically restore to ex-offenders who have served their sentences the right to vote in federal elections. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Sen. Obama is one of the sponsors.</p>
<p>Several other bills will have a dramatic impact on employment discrimination litigation should they be enacted: {snip} The bills should be a boon for employment lawyers.</p>
<p>Even considering the trade-offs and compromises that even a party in complete control of the executive and legislative branches must make, there&rsquo;s a very good probability that most, if not all, of the foregoing bills will be signed into law if Sen. Obama wins. And it wouldn&rsquo;t be surprising if even more bills join the list. The interest groups supporting the proposed legislation have been laboring in the wilderness for some time waiting for the harmonic convergence of large majorities in Congress and a Democrat in the White House. They won&rsquo;t let the moment pass quietly.<br>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve been almost apathetic to this campaign since McCain and Obama became the nominees. I figured it won&rsquo;t matter who wins. This is a wake up call for me; convicts voting, reparations, and even payment to Guam for being loyal? McCain may be a liberal, but at least he&rsquo;s not going to dole out punishment.</p>

			<p>How many more civil rights do they need?  Do they want a law mandating every white woman to marry a black man?  Also, Obama claimed he was opposed to reparations.  He became Senator from Illinois because the dingbat who opposed him (I won&rsquo;t mention Alan Keyes by name) came out FOR Reparations, and Obama rapped his knuckles for it.  That&rsquo;s how Obama could get 70% of the vote.</p>

			<p>The Guam Bill: <i>The bill provides $126 million for reparations to residents of Guam who suffered personal injury, forced labor, or internment at the hands of the Japanese during World War II. </i></p>
<p>Am I missing something here? Let me read that again. Hmmmmmm. Yes. we need to start giving money to all the people the Japanese harmed in World War Two. And the people the Germans harmed. After all, we were part of that war. Yes, yes, there are still people in the world who haven&rsquo;t received money from the U.S. government.<br>

			<p>I hope BO does get elected and these black supremacists try to pass these bills with the economy gong in the tank! <br>
America&rsquo;s first slaves were white, not indentured servants either. And what did the white slaves get promised? What are the and when are the descendants of the Black Plantation slave owners going to pay reparations to the descendants of the white slaves? This is apparently history most people are unfamiliar with. Learn the truth. And no one owes anyone anything. Your comments are out of line completely. </p>
<p>Link: http://www.epado.bravehost.com/whiteslaves00.htm</p>
<p>Black slave owners in the United States<br>
http://www.epado.bravehost.com/whiteslaves05.htm</p>
<p>The point of the matter is that is swept up under the rug. Why? Now for the ugly other side of the coin! </p>
<p>The white slave descendants split much blood in the so called Civil War to free black slaves. Is that not enough? Apparently not. Then what will be enough? </p>
<p>The only thing the white slave and their descendants did get is to fight the now imperialist wars that the USA is ever so demanding, the white slaves and their descendants built this country from the bottom up and got promised nothing. </p>
<p>What do they get? SPIT ON by the likes of people like BO screaming racism for some perceived, real and or imagined past grievances that white people also endured. See the utter hypocrisy? <br>
BO has already proved just how much he hates European (white) Americans and continues to do it. Is white America going to take a stand against this blatant hate and racism or are you going to cow-taw in the corner for fear of being called a racist yourself? <br>
This situation is growing worse by the day and all European Americans will find themselves refugees in their own country that their fore fathers conquered and built!!!!!!! <br>
Hell in California and Florida you are refugees. Is that what you want? The founding forefathers to this country are screaming at you from the grave. Grow the moral courage, the backbone, and pride in your culture to stand United together as unbreakable force that your founding forefathers had! And no there is nothing racist about it, especially since every non-white is afforded that. It is only denied, balked at and denounced as &#8220;racism&#8221; if your skin color happens to be white.</p>

			<p>Certain sources that I respect have insisted that nowhere in our Constitution of the United States is there provision for any right not to be discriminated against.  Moreover, &#8220;freedom of association&#8221; dictates the exact opposite:  That in freely choosing with whom we associate, do business, hire, and so on, we must be entitled to naturally and justly exercise our personal preferences, based on whatever criteria we choose. </p>
<p>Can anyone say that the Constitution is supposed to outlaw discrimination?  </p>

			<p>Regarding the reparations, there are many Whites who are descendents of slaves, and there are many Blacks who have ancestors who owned slaves. The labor also compensated for the transportation. So, if they want the money for labor, shouldn&rsquo;t they pay for passage to the colonies?<br>
Likewise for the food, water, shelter, medical care, and protection.<br>
[b]The Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act (&ldquo;Akaka Bill&rdquo;).</p>
<p>The Akaka Bill would create a separate race-based government for persons of Native Hawaiian descent.

<p>We can only guess, if Whites wanted their own country on U.S. territory! I think the answer is pretty obvious.</p>
<p>Obama is a racist Black Nationalist! He wants what is best for Blacks, over all other races. He is trying to make an anti-White coalition, with the Hispanics and others. He has advocated for increasing Black African immigration, at an astronomical level. He has race-baited and spoke for the exclusive interests of his race. We just have to look at his favorite church in Chicago, Ill. He didn&rsquo;t join it on accident. </p>
<p>Obama has actually continually brought up race. When he keeps bringing up the need to &#8220;get over race,&#8221; he is actually succeeding at planting the seeds for further racial divison. Ironic?</p>
<p>If it is so important to transcend race, then why does he keep bringing it up? Shouldn&rsquo;t it be too obvious to need to state. If we vote for Obama to &#8220;transcend&#8221; race, as Obama is ordering us to do, then are we really transcending race?</p>

			<p>Well, on and on it goes; the nightmarish possibility, that we will find ourselves in the Utopian States of America by the year 2009, with General Secretary Obama &ldquo;living large and in charge.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s right whitey, DJ Obama gonna&rsquo; be &ldquo;in da house&rdquo; for da comrades, da White House. And here, we are offered a whole host of probable legislative &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; dictates, that this mulatto nonentity will likely push forward.</p>
<p>Of these, the most pernicious and outright idiotic is the: &ldquo;Commission to Study Reparations Proposals for African-Americans Act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is proposed by Comrade Congressman Conyers, which right there should be enough to table this worthless piece of written stupidity, given his &ldquo;accomplishments.&rdquo; The<br>
chief &ldquo;accomplishment&rdquo; here being that he intends to die in his office and probably will, thanks to being reelected by sud-imbecilic blacks in Detroit for decades, with no coming respite (let alone an electoral retirement) in sight. However, let us not be so crude as to judge this proposed &ldquo;commission,&rdquo; simply on the &ldquo;merits&rdquo; of the man who initiated it; let us look at its assumed &ldquo;healing&rdquo; nuances:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The purpose of the bill is to create a commission to study the impact of slavery in the United States and recommend appropriate remedies, including an apology to and reparations for blacks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How &ldquo;novel,&rdquo; to say nothing of &ldquo;noble!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I really would be for this, if we could plant the so-called &ldquo;commission&rdquo; in the western or eastern suburbs of Detroit; or allow for competing commissions in those areas, to look at the impact of blacks on the region, post antebellum. Or for that matter, post 1945.</p>
<p>A true comparison and contrast of the &ldquo;horrors&rdquo; of slavery, against the &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; gains after World War II on Comrade Congressman Conyers&rsquo; own &ldquo;turf,&rdquo; would be most enlightening and enriching. If you don&rsquo;t believe me, just hit Woodward between Mc Nichols and 7 Mile around midnight, for really spicy taste of &ldquo;life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Enough said here.</p>
<p>Except for, and as always, God help us all!</p>

			<p>As stupid and as this the matter of reparations is, and as much as I hope it never passes, the statement &#8220;So, if they want the money for labor, shouldn&rsquo;t they pay for passage to the colonies?&#8221; is just a bit over the top since these people never asked for passage here, and were in fact forced to come. The only decent thing to do is give them and all their decendants free passage back to their African shores. I&rsquo;m sure they will enjoy the cruise, unlike their long-gone ancestors. It can even be touted as part of the quit-claim with their American citizenship.</p>

That Housing Discrimination one scares me. It would mean <i>the federal government</i> carries out those little exercises where they send out potential renters to see if they black guys get turned down and the white guy doesn&rsquo;t. (We&rsquo;ve had articles about them on Amren several times. Usually it&rsquo;s a newspaper or nonprofit that does the &#8216;research.&rsquo;) It would force real estate owners and landlords to document the basis for their rental decisions, and they would be much less able to make decisions based on gut instinct.<br>

			<p>After having read this several times, am I to believe that BO now approves of South African Apartheid with the plans to have separate race-based governments in Hawaii, (and this would be just a start)?   What a lot of hypocrites these people are.   While SA follows Zimbabwe into the racial pit of despair for those white Africans who made those nations great, these political fools want to move the goal-posts to suit their own agendas in the USA.   </p>
<p>Reparations are not needed now for the conditions have existed for the many decades since for the descendants of the victims to either return to Africa etc, or to work hard in the USA and make their fortunes (however modest but with hard work) in the society that the USA has been for over 150 years now since the slaves were freed with mostly white blood.</p>
<p>I am not a racist, they are now living in South Africa in government, but I am a realist to see that the objective is running the country without the qualifications of abilities to do so, as has happened in South Africa and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>This move should be rejected by all sane, educated Americans.  It is becoming like a perverted Tom Wolfe novel.</p>

			<p>To Outraged Anglo:</p>
<p>I posted on the Black slaveowners link you provide, and was shocked to read about the mention of the Louisiana slave-owner Antoine Dubuclet, who owned over 100 slaves, and whose plantation was valued at $ 264,000 USA, in 1860! I thought, why is there no mention of this man? Why don&rsquo;t Ken Burns or Spike Lee make a film about this guy? Why don&rsquo;t they mention it to all the Bantu students during Bantu History Month?</p>
<p>If they ever made a film about Antoine Dubuclet, I have the actor to play him - James Earl  Jones!</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t know how old you are Outraged, but, when Alex Haley&rsquo;s (now fraudulent) &#8220;Roots&#8221; was made into a TV mini-series by ABC in 1977, teachers and the government practically mandated that Americans watch each episode. I thought that was chilling at the time - the federal government practically ordering us to watch &#8220;Roots&#8221;. Years later, it came out that &#8220;Roots&#8221; was a fabrication of Alex Haley&rsquo;s, but he was pushing up black dahlias by that time. </p>

			<p>People, let&rsquo;s not forget that National Review circa 2008 is basically a neocon/GOP medium.  They may criticize Obama&rsquo;s liberal schemes, but are suspiciously quiet with regard to McCain&rsquo;s.  </p>
<p>There is very little paleoconservative media outside of the Internet.  So, be very careful that you don&rsquo;t view John McCain as some sort of savior.  He certainly is not.</p>

<p><br>
When it comes to pandering to blacks, er, &#8220;African-Americans,&#8221; McCain might by MARGINALLY more reasonable, since he doesn&rsquo;t need a significant number of black votes or black financial contributions to win.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to Hispanic pandering, one could make a case that McCain (as an Arizona senator) is actually worse than Obama.  Plus, the Republicans in Congress would be more likely to pass an amnesty bill with McCain as president than with Obama.  In other words, amnesty for some 20 million illegal aliens is more likely under a John Sidney McCain presidency than a Barack Hussein Obama presidency. </p>

			<p>You know, the irony about all this, is that an election of Barack Obama to the Presidency might be the one thing to finally grab American Whites by the throat and shake them out of their sheep-like complacency en masse.  Too often, our people have elected fools such as the Clintons or sell-outs like the Bushes, and then turned around and convinced ourselves that everything will work out fine, we don&rsquo;t need to look after our own interests.  An election of Barack Hussein Obama would remove that comforting idiocy once and for all.  I&rsquo;m wondering if it&rsquo;s the one thing that we actually need.</p>

<p>Hell!! many of us working whites, if not all, are still enslaved trying to support our families and seeing more and more of our money go to welfare, immigration and plain old enemies of our country every payday. I said before, I am convinced some sort of bribe is going to be paid to the blacks and then the Muslims will want their unfair share. A black Muslim gets even more, and more yet to a black Muslim farmer.</p>

			<p>For those of you who think restoring voting rights for convicted felons is a good idea   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s a really bad one for our cause.  Because what will happen is that all those black men that will all of a sudden be able to vote, will get on the voter rolls because of motor-voter, but will very likely not vote.  However, the addition of many more new registered voters in certain black jurisdictions will give corrupt black poll workers the opportunity to vote for them after the polls have closed. </p>
<p>BTW, this is probably how Florida ended up with the dimpled chad and pregnant chad in 2000.  Because certain poll workers were taking multiple ballot cards and voting Gore afterhours, and some of the chads didn&rsquo;t punch through.  This kind of voter fraud problem used to be common in St. Louis, as well.</p>

<p>How on earth did we get to the point where we&rsquo;re voting for the candidate who will take us down the &#8216;slowest road to hell?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Either candidate is a disaster on immigration issues  &mdash;   Dick Morris writes that Obama has this in store for us:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;He [Obama] wants to cover 12 million illegal immigrants with federally subsidized health insurance, dramatically driving up costs and forcing federal rationing of healthcare&hellip;&#8221;</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t have a problem with restoring a convicted felon&rsquo;s right to vote after (s)he has served his/her complete sentence.<br>
Question Diversity&rsquo;s concern should be addressed by poll watchers which duty is to keep the election officials honest.</p>
<p>I do wonder with this reparations thing whether there could be a &#8220;repatriation&#8221; backlash, starting with the black habitual criminals we spend $15-30k per year to incarcerate.</p>
<p>Maybe after the Communist government in Cuba falls, Cuba could be a place to ship black criminals to work in the cane-fields.</p>

			<p>comparable worth was a campaign by liberals and the labor unions a few years ago. it means equal wages for people who different things, but based on a political decision of what you do is worth. so if the black receptionist who chats on her cell phone all day wants to sue your company to make what you make working all day to nail down sales for the company, and sometimes you do this in the evening or weekends if that&rsquo;s what it takes, she can sue and get a few million in the streets to support her. Yes, just watch the demonstrations flourish under Obama, the new King.  What are you worth? Whatever O&rsquo;s Secretary of &#8220;Labor&#8221; says you are. If you  have any kids in college, send them to Law School. There will be lots of employment litigation unleashed by the election Harvard Law School Review Chief Editor Obama, who favored publication of articles of how to sue employers because you are black. <br>

 Congress from enacting laws that take away our God-given rights.  Civil rights are rights granted by Congress that take away others&rsquo; God-given rights. So, civil rights are unconstitutional.  Civil rights have also set an evil precedent; everyone wants civil rights for whatever they want.  </p>

<p>Hell!! many of us working whites, if not all, are still enslaved trying to support our families and seeing more and more of our money go to welfare, immigration and plain old enemies of our country every payday. I said before, I am convinced some sort of bribe is going to be paid to the blacks and then the Muslims will want their unfair share. A black Muslim gets even more, and more yet to a black Muslim farmer.&#8221;</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see how going back and suing over Industrial Revolution mistreatments is much different than the proposed repairations.  Those conditions  were awful and in my opinion worse that what blacks dealt with in the South under slavery.  Look into it, went on long after the Emancipation Proclaimation - well into the 20th century.</p>
<p>As for today&rsquo;s working class, I am convinced that our government (corporations) sees us as expendable and easily replaced with workers that will carp less - and expect less.</p>

			<p>This whole reparations thing is a complete fraud.</p>
<p>Yes, Blacks ancestors who were slaves were undoubtedly used badly.</p>
<p>Would that we&rsquo;d never have brought them here.  However, we are a 15 generations removed from slavery.  The only laws remaining on the books that are discriminatory are those that discriminate against whites (affirmative action).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say reparations are more than paid judging by the fact that blacks standard of living is much higher in the US than it is in any African run nation.  Modern day blacks should be VERY thankful to live in a country with the largess and liberal social policies that allow them to live much better than their African brothers.</p>
<p>The only reparations I&rsquo;d be willing to pay (and I&rsquo;d do so gladly) is contributing to their one way tickets back to Africa.</p>
<p>Of course, they would never want to go back their.  They may bite and growl at the hand that feeds them, but they are still well aware of who it is that&rsquo;s feeding them.</p>
<p>The main thing in this day and age that is holding blacks back is low IQ.  Pure and simple.  They know it to be true themselves, though they&rsquo;d not admit it.</p>

			<p>Germans and Italians also languished in internment camps during WWII but I don&rsquo;t recall them ever getting a dime.  Whites were indentured servants and slaves at the time of this country&rsquo;s founding, so where&rsquo;s the reparations legislation benefiting their descendants?  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m of the belief that a Obama presidency would mean a reparations windfall for blacks who already benefit from race based legislation in the form of welfare, affirmative action, medicaid and the like.  Sam Francis was correct when he said it&rsquo;s no longer a matter of equality so much as it is blacks exerting their racial supremacy and power over the cowed whites.  Whites cannot bring themselves to become antagonistic and aggressive towards blacks, since that would be racist and wicked. </p>
<p>An Obama presidency could become a veritable nightmare for white nationalists (non-nationalists are zombies), and perhaps his pro-black radicalism will finally galvanize whites to rally around the concept of race and take meaningful action to defend  our people.            </p>

<p>That is the most ridiculous of them all.</p>
<p>For years and years and years liberals complained that female students did not do good enough at math and science, so they put so much work in to making females better at math and science.  Now we have an epidemic of American males dropping out of school and under performing in reading, math and science - and what do the liberals say?  There is no more problem!  Even when females are graduating at much higher rates and out performing their male counter parts - they don&rsquo;t give a damn.</p>

			<p>Reparations<br>
Commission to Study Reparations Proposals for African-Americans Act.</p>
<p>Rep. John Conyers has introduced this legislation every year since 1989, but with a Democrat in the White House and significant congressional majorities, this bill finally has an opportunity to be enacted. The purpose of the bill is to create a commission to study the impact of slavery in the United States and recommend appropriate remedies, including an apology to and reparations for blacks. The House Judiciary Committee on the Constitution held hearings related to the bill in December 2007. The bill is modeled after that which granted reparations to Japanese-Americans interned during World War II.  <br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;   </p>
<p>This is very possible under Obama. And not only were none of his ancestors slaves in America, on his white American side, they were actually slave owners. Those in favor of reparations are asking for trillions of dollars. It can&rsquo;t be compared to Japanese Americans interned during WWII, since the money went directly to the people who suffered through it, or their children. Not centuries back. Also, a good deal of these blacks are just like Obama, and are the direct descendants of former slave owners. Al Sharpton is one as well. They may be the ones who are related to them, but will not recognize them. And instead want to impose their ancestors sins on many White Americans whose people never owned slaves, and in many cases on whites who came long after slavery was abolished. It is yet another scam intended to rob whites of their hard earned money, to place in the pockets of black slackers.<br>

			<p>There are three basic truisms when dealing with reparations:</p>
<p>Truism number one. As long as there is some foolish white person whose self imposed guilt is being reflected through a prism of moral superiority, there will always be some black hand being held out demanding money!</p>
<p>Truism number two. Irrespective of the amount of money given from the white man to the black man it will never be enough. There will be periodic revisions. More guilt, more money, more moral superiority, It is a never ending circle, a never ending &#8220;Catch 22&#8221;! </p>
<p>Truism number three. The end result of all of this nonsense is that blacks will still perform less well on standardized I.Q. test, will still perform less well in grade schools, will still perform less well in High Schools, and will always still perform less well in colleges as compared to whites and Asians. However, they will always out perform both whites and Asians in football, basketball, track and field, and violent crime. </p>

			<p>Of all the issue in this campaign, the issue of reparations is the most powerful one for dissuading the majority of voters to reject Obama.  However, Obama has not committed himself to supporting reparations for black Americans even though many around him are avid supporters of such legislation.  If the reparations albatross his hung around Obama&rsquo;s neck, he will surely lose the election.</p>
