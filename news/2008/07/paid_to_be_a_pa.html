<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>A year ago, New York started a controversial and ambitious anti-poverty scheme which is now being closely monitored overseas.</p>
<p>The idea of Opportunity NYC is simple.</p>
<p>Some 2,500 families in the city&rsquo;s most deprived neighbourhoods are paid for tasks that many people would deem to be normal parental responsibilities &mdash; taking their child to the doctor and dentist, say, or attending parent-teacher meetings.</p>
<p>Some people are even being paid to find a job.</p>
<p>The scheme is targeted at some of the toughest neighbourhoods in the city.</p>
<p>East New York in Brooklyn definitely qualifies &mdash; it is the vision of inner-city deprivation.</p>
<p>Half of the residents live below the poverty line &mdash; the majority are black or Hispanic.</p>
<p>Crime is high; there is even barbed wire around the local supermarket.</p>
<p><b>Inner city</b></p>
<p>&#8220;You can see this is really like the inner city. The income here is pretty low. This area has a high crime rate; drugs and gangs. It&rsquo;s underdeveloped, so many people are just sitting on corners, there are more liquor stores here than banks,&#8221; said Candace Perkins, one of the scheme&rsquo;s local co-ordinators.</p>
<p>It is to combat this that the city has come up with the experimental approach, imported in part from Mexico.</p>
<p>The scheme is funded by private money but has the support of the mayor&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>One recipient is 37-year-old Natasha Dean.</p>
<p>She has 12 children and lives in one of the area&rsquo;s notorious tower blocks, which she enters through the back door because she is too scared to go in the front.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since I&rsquo;ve been here about four years, I&rsquo;ve witnessed about 10 shootings. About four or five deaths,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Natasha heard about the project and was curious.</p>
<p>The appeal was obvious &mdash; it was a simple case of doing the sums.</p>
<p>&#8220;The finances definitely appealed. To get paid for things I normally do without any strings attached was wonderful,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>In the past two months, she has received some ($992) £500 for things such as ensuring her children do not miss school, and have dental check-ups.</p>
<p>More tasks completed mean more money in.</p>
<p>It has helped her cope with a sick child and no job.</p>
<p><b>Incentives</b></p>
<p>Natasha is almost in tears as she describes not having enough money for the $2 (£1) bus ride to visit her daughter at the hospital.</p>
<p>She has not told her children about the scheme, but she is using her own incentives to ensure they do what is needed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a son who wasn&rsquo;t doing too well in school. By giving him these incentives, I would tell him if you do this in class Mum will get this and this for you. His behaviour has changed because I was able to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. follow through, because of the money.&#8221;</p>
<p>It might be good for Natasha but it has raised questions.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the manner on which this is done is completely wrong-headed,&#8221; said Herb London is from the conservative Hudson Institute.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m not sure that it&rsquo;s working and I&rsquo;m not sure the message that&rsquo;s being delivered is an appropriate message: that we need to reward people because their children do well in school, where people have to be compensated for engaging in what would normally be quotidian activities you would expect from a parent.&#8221;</p>
<p>The deputy mayor, Linda Gibbs, says it is too early to say whether it will work or not, but defends the idea of using cash as an incentive.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s inherent in our economy. We are a capitalist economy &mdash; the tax code is full of cash incentives around behaviour,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody works hard during the year because they want a big bonus at Christmas time. This is not out of keeping with a lot of the way that we incentivize behaviour already in our economy. It just doesn&rsquo;t happen for poor people as often.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Breadline</b></p>
<p>Natasha says the scheme works for her because it does not ask or judge why she has 12 children &mdash; unlike the social services.</p>
<p>She resents any implication that the scheme could be regarded as an income in place of a job.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to work, I don&rsquo;t see this as a crutch, I can&rsquo;t just lay back and say OK. It&rsquo;s wonderful that it&rsquo;s there, but I can&rsquo;t depend on it. This is just an incentive not a lifestyle, not a job. I need to find employment. I&rsquo;m not sitting back&#8221;</p>
<p>Her small apartment is sparsely furnished.</p>
<p>She only just got enough money to buy beds and curtains.</p>
<p>She sits on the sofa with her kids around her reading their report cards. Her son is now getting As and Bs.</p>
<p>The incentives have worked for her children, and are working for her.</p>
<p>She may have done the basics anyway, but the cash ensures she does.</p>
<p>The idea is controversial, and it is too early to say if it is a sticking plaster on a larger problem or a constructive way to get people out of poverty.</p>
<p>It has helped Natasha out of her immediate problems, but will it help her children escape a future of struggling on the breadline?<br>

			<p>Any excuse to give white taxpayer money to non-whites is always a good idea.Mainly because it just makes the problem worse.Which means in the future even more white taxpayer money can go to non-whites.</p>

<p>What an idiot!  She should be the poster child for involuntary sterilization.</p>
<p>Heck if da gubmit wants to pay her, pay her to get those tubes tied.</p>
<p>What kind of human being brings 12 others into the world just to suffer and to exist in such barbaric and dangerous conditions?</p>
<p>Answer:  black welfare queens.</p>

The fact is non-whites cost more in money, time, resources, etc. Put them in the same school with whites and everything being equal, they will still require extra money and help and even so, they will fail to raise their performance.</p>
<p>We should acknowledge this fact and give them extra money to get away from us. Let them have extra money for afro-centric schools. Let them have extra money for community projects in their communities.</p>
<p>In the long run, it&rsquo;s a small price to pay for our safety, well being, and future.</p>

			<p>Sterilization, sterilization, sterilization.  We need to bring that back.  We need to institute something like Barbara Harris&rsquo; CRACK program: pay women to get themselves sterilized, say after having 2 children, rather than letting them have 12.  </p>
<p><i>Herb London: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure that it&rsquo;s working and I&rsquo;m not sure the message that&rsquo;s being delivered is an appropriate message: that we need to reward people because their children do well in school, where people have to be compensated for engaging in what would normally be quotidian activities you would expect from a parent.&rdquo;<i></i></i></p>
<p>I disagree with Mr. London.  We are paying these people anyway (welfare, Medicare, food stamps), with the problem being none of these programs implies that you have to behave properly.  </p>
<p>With this program, you actually have to do proper, moral acts in order to be paid.  That is a substantial improvement.  </p>
<p>Again, we also need to pay these kinds of women to sterilize themselves after having a kid or two.  </p>

			<p>You have to have a license to drive a car, go hunting or fishing, run a business, or own a dog, but you do not have to have a license to be a parent!</p>
<p>That Natasha Dean has 12 children in the worst set of circumstances and depends on this extreme kind of government assistance, is one example that not everyone should be a parent.</p>
<p>Perhaps, better kinds of government programs would be to distribute and encourage birth control for poor communities of blacks, hispanics, even that of poor whites.  </p>
<p>Believe me, I would be rather be aborted, than be born into a dreadful situation, like that of being one of Natasha Dean&rsquo;s children!</p>
<p>But then again, even being born into a rich family does not guarantee a happy life.  Child abuse, and examples of people who should not be parents, happen even in the wealthiest and most respectable families.  Singer Bing Crosby was a notorious abuser of his children and was just as unfit to be a parent as Natasha Dean.</p>
<p>I do not intend to insult, or disrespect, anyone&rsquo;s religious faith.  But when churches and synagogues order and demand that everyone in their congregations have children, by claiming that it is God&rsquo;s will to be &#8220;fruitful and multiply&#8221;.  It can create serious problems by persuading people who should not be parents, like Bing Crosby and Natasha Dean, to have children and make them suffer by being born to the wrong sort of parents.</p>

			<p>I love in articles such as this how everything that is said is written in Proper English.  I get a chuckle out of thinking that a black perpetual welfare case would actually say &ldquo;I want to work, I don&rsquo;t see this as a crutch, I can&rsquo;t just lay back and say OK. It&rsquo;s wonderful that it&rsquo;s there, but I can&rsquo;t depend on it. This is just an incentive not a lifestyle, not a job. I need to find employment. I&rsquo;m not sitting back&rdquo; all in understandable English that a non-ebonics speaker would understand.</p>

			<p>These beggars are being paid protection money. Shut off the spigot and watch the parasites overrun the country. Stop rewarding and feeding the animals and they will all turn predatory, turning on their keepers. Absolutely everyone is a racist, there are no exceptions, only liars.  </p>

TWELVE children??? I would love to know exactly how many baby daddies sired her kids?? Sounds like getting pregnant has been her true occupation. And I don&rsquo;t believe her for an instant when she claims she has every intention of getting work someday. She has already spent most of her adult life pregnant, and probably will continue to get pregnant as long as she can. She said herself, the more she does for her children, the more money she makes, hence the more children she has, the more money she will rake in. Meanwhile, the people paying her taxes, aren&rsquo;t getting a paid a cent for doing what they are paying for her to do  &mdash;  Being responsible parent. </p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how many blacks follow the same pattern again and again. A black mother who has several children out of wedlock, will bring them up on public assistance, in the projects, only to see her children repeat the cycle. Their daugthers will often get pregnant in their teens, and start collecting welfare, while their sons will drop out, become gangsta&rsquo;s playa&rsquo;s, and impregnates as many willing females as he can find. And who do they blame for all this? Whites of course,racist whites are holding them down. And when they want to boast off their race, they will point to Obama and say, see he made it all the way to the top. Made it to the top, thanks to his white Grandparents who financed his education. The same grandparents he called racist. In that way, he is no different than most of his fellow blacks living in the projects.</p>

			<p>While the problem for now is that we are paying for this woman to act civil and like a good parent.  The real problem is that her dozen bastard children will end up either A) as the &#8220;baby daddy&#8221; for even more bastard children, and probably in the criminal justice system, or B) as future legs-open welfare recipients, that expect to be paid for doing what is deemed &#8220;good parenting.&#8221;  The cycle will not only continue, but will expand exponentially.  </p>
<p>This is socialism, &#8220;it takes a village&#8221;, mentality that utterly makes me furious.  Expect more of this if we get an Obamanation.</p>

<p>Hold off on that Bing Crosby libel.  Bing Crosby: Irish, Catholic and golfer, (almost a perfect American combination) is a prime target for counter culture hit men.  One of Bing&rsquo;s son wrote an over the top portrayal of Bing as abusing a father; another son said it was all a lie.  Bing&rsquo;s father was pretty much of an off to the wood shed dad and Bing followed suite.</p>
<p>None of Bing&rsquo;s kids turned out bad, and they grew up in Hollywood!  Bing died a very wealthy man. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bing_Crosby" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bing_Crosby</a> </p>

			<p>&#8220;we also need to pay these kinds of women to sterilize themselves after having a kid or two.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually been going on, here and there. I met a young girl who&rsquo;d been filled with Norplant (the one where you can&rsquo;t get pregnant for 5 years or something) anyway.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;His behaviour has changed because I was able to &hellip; follow through, because of the money.&#8221;</p>
<p>1. How much has it changed?  My guess is, marginally.  It&rsquo;s not exactly unheard of for teachers to bump up the marks a little (or a lot) due to &#8220;good behavior&#8221; and &#8220;effort.&#8221;</p>
<p>2. If promise of a future reward supplied by the state is enough to improve his behavior, then promise of a future reward resulting from his own efforts  &mdash;  -do well in school so you can get a decent job, go to your job, collect your paycheck, not be a worthless layabout  &mdash;  -should also be enough to improve his behavior, at least somewhat.  Of course it probably won&rsquo;t be because her child is probably incapable of any foresight past next week, and has no sense of pride whatsoever, only vanity and a sense of entitlement.</p>
<p>The woman has 12 children and wonders why she can&rsquo;t afford to take care of them.  Talk about clueless.  If only stupidity wasn&rsquo;t hereditary, the whole situation wouldn&rsquo;t be nearly so depressing.</p>

			<p>&#8220;What an idiot! She should be the poster child for involuntary <br>
What kind of human being brings 12 others into the world just to suffer and to exist in such barbaric and dangerous conditions?</p>
<p>Answer: black welfare queens.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
The funny thing about this is that if it were a white person with 12 children, this would be an article about overpopulation, the radical Christian right, irresponsibility, how the kids don&rsquo;t get the love they need and the list goes on.   Think about all the hate the Duggars get in the press for having 19 children (who they take care of very well), but if a woman like has 12, they don&rsquo;t bat an eyelash.       Whites from a big family are a threat because they will turn into &#8220;homophobic Republican Wal-Mart shoppers with bad haircuts and no designer jeans&#8221; as one writer put it.   I guess children are a blessing only when they come from minority families on the government&rsquo;s dime. </p>

			<p>Although this program is <i><b>privately</b></i> funded, they are receiving these incentives <i><b>in addition to</b></i> their taxpayer-funded goodies like welfare, food stamps, Section 8/HUD housing vouchers/free apartments in the projects, handouts from churches/charities, huge &#8216;earned income credit&rsquo; tax refunds, etc.  In my dealings with poor people over the years, whether they were legitimately poor or &#8220;low-income&#8221; by government decree, barring unusual/emergent circumstances, the reasons for their situation always seemed to stem from laziness, pickiness about the type of employment/wages they were willing to accept and, more often, flat-out wastefulness.  In terms of actual income, most &#8220;low income by government decree&#8221; people actually aren&rsquo;t.  There is an endless supply of these people who supposedly never seem to have enough money for necessities and need &#8220;assistance&#8221;, but always manage to afford salon fake braids, salon fake weaves, (often laughably blonde), salon fake nails, cell phones, pagers, parties, barbeques, brand-new, non-tatty clothes for both dey and dey chilluns, booze, dope, rap CDs, solid gold/diamond bling, eating out at restaurants (three trips a day to McDonalds&rsquo;, Burger King, et al) etc., etc.  This woman is no exception.  She&rsquo;s in tears to a BBC reporter about not being able to come up with $2 for a bus (why the Hell doesn&rsquo;t she just walk her fat behind there) to see her daughter in the hospital (receiving free medical treatment, no doubt), but blowing $1,000 on new furniture and curtains (which in a high-rise she doesn&rsquo;t actually need, for the most part) was nooooooooo problem&hellip;  Don&rsquo;t waste money on Afrocentric schools, sterilization/social programs, or parent licencing.  <b>JUST SEND THEM ALL BACK TO THEIR HOME COUNTRIES WHERE THEY BELONG!!!!</b></p>

			<p>&#8220;The scheme is funded by private money but has the support of the mayor&rsquo;s office.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not funded by taxpayers yet, but give it time.</p>

			<p>Who oversees this dispursement of money?  My bet is that blacks are over-represented in this duty.  Just as there are massive amounts of fraud in any government program geared towards minorities, so it is with this program.  As an example, how many times have you witnessed an obese, but otherwise healthy looking, black hanging a government issued handicap placard on their rearview mirror?  Here in Harris County, Texas it was revealed several years ago that many recipients of these tags had no medical condition which would warrant receiving one.  So how were they able to obtain the handicap placard?  From black employees responsible for issuing them.  Anything to save a fellow black, even a healthy one, from having to walk an extra 50 feet through a parking lot.  Yet my 88 year old grandmother was made to jump through hoops in order to get one for herself, from the same office workers that so effortlessly handed these things out like halloween candy to their own.<br>
From government agencies that issue food stamps and welfare to things as simple as handicap placards, blacks are disproportionately represented in the employment ranks, and in every one of these places, theft and deception are normal operating procedures.  I suspect that &#8220;Opportunity NYC&#8221; will be no different. </p>

<p>How right you are! I remember reading a scathing article about a white couple about to welcome their 16th child. The man writting about them was ripping them to shreads for it, in very judgemental manner. This white family was about as old fashioned as you could get. The kids were brought up with chores, said yes sir, and yes mam. The girls only wore dresses and skirts, and the mother was a stay at home Mom, who sewed the family clothes, and home schooled the kids. I should also add, their home was huge, and the father supported the family with his own hard work. How perverse it is, that families like those, who support their own kid&rsquo;s are insulted by our twisted leftist media, while welfare queens are supposed to be treated with kid gloves for having one kid after another out of wedlock, and are also given big rewards for doing what is supposed to be their jobs as parents.</p>

<p>Did they get paid for being good parents? Of course not! But this Natasha Dean who reproduces like a feral alley cat gets paid for doing what she is supposed to do.<br>
Instead of being paid for giving her offspring the bare minimum of guidance she should be heavily fined for each one she squirts out. Or since she is living on taxpayer money, take away a portion of her allotment for each one the taxpayers have to support. If she only had one or two, maybe she could raise them without being paid for it.  </p>

			<p>Hello again, from Harry.  I visited the Duggars&rsquo; website.  Yes, they have 19 children.  The major difference is that as opposed to people like Natasha Dean, the Duggars are competent people who are taking good care of all their 19 children.</p>
<p>I may not know what goes on behind closed doors at the Duggars house.  But, even though I am an agnostic, and the Duggars are Christians, visiting their website gave me a very positive impression that they are the right kind of people to be parents.</p>
<p>Of course, not everyone who chooses to be child free is as incompetent as Natasha Dean.  Among great people who were, and are, child free would include Andrew Carnegie, artist Thomas Eakins, C.S. Lewis, Luther Burbank, Katherine Hepburn, Alan Rickman, and Jeff Goldblum.</p>
<p>Ironically, the actor Steve Martin, chose to be child free, but did a great acting job in the movie &#8220;Cheaper by the Dozen&#8221; and it&rsquo;s sequel &#8220;Cheaper by the Dozen 2&#8221;, in which he plays a man who is the father of ten children.</p>

			<p>This is Harry again.  When I mentioned a list of child-free famous people, I made one historical mistake; Andrew Carnegie did have one child.  But, I am still certain that the other past, and present, famous people, were and are child free.</p>
<p>Oh, well, nobody is perfect!</p>
