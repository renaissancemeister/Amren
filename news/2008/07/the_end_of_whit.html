<p>For much of the 20th century, the proportion of whites shrank in most U.S. cities. In recent years the decline has slowed considerably &mdash; and in some significant cases has reversed. Between 2000 and 2006, eight of the 50 largest cities, including Boston, Seattle and San Francisco, saw the proportion of whites increase, according to Census figures. The previous decade, only three cities saw increases.</p>
<p>The changing racial mix is stirring up quarrels over class and culture. Beloved institutions in traditionally black communities &mdash; minority-owned restaurants, book stores &mdash; are losing the customers who supported them for decades. As neighborhoods grow more multicultural, conflicts over home prices, taxes and education are opening a new chapter in American race relations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Census data &#8220;suggests that white flight from large cities may have bottomed out in the 1990s,&#8221; says William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank.</p>
<p>For instance, while most of the 50 largest cities continue to see declines in the share of whites, it is at much-reduced rates. In Los Angeles the share of the white population declined only about a half a percentage point between 2000 and 2006, compared to a 7.5-point decline the previous decade. Cities including New York, Fort Worth and Chicago show a similar pattern.</p>
<p><b>&lsquo;Natural Decrease&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Demographic readjustments can take decades to play out. But if current trends continue, Washington and Atlanta (both with black majorities) will in the next decade see African-Americans fall below 50% for the first time in about a half-century.</p>
<p>Meantime, in San Francisco, African-American deaths now outnumber births. Once a &#8220;natural decrease&#8221; such as this begins, it&rsquo;s tough for the population to bounce back, since there are fewer residents left to produce the next generation. {snip}</p>
<p>There are myriad factors driving the change. In recent years, minority middle-class families, particularly African-Americans, have been moving to the suburbs in greater numbers. At the same time, Hispanic immigrants (who poured into cities from the 1970s through the 1990s) are now increasingly bypassing cities for suburbs and rural areas, seeking jobs on farms and in meat-packing plants.</p>
<p>Cities have spent a decade tidying up parks and converting decaying factories into retail and living space. That has attracted young professionals and empty-nesters, many of them white.</p>
<p>The shift has put the future at odds with the past. New York City&rsquo;s borough of Brooklyn has seen its proportion of whites grow to 36.1% in 2006 from 35.9% in 2000 &mdash; the first increase in white share in about a century.</p>
<p><b>Hoarding Computers</b></p>
<p>While the root of neighborhood conflicts is often money or class differences between white-collar and blue-collar workers, it often unfolds along racial lines. About two years ago Public School 84, in a largely Hispanic section of Brooklyn, meetings of the Parent Teacher Association started drawing a more professional, wealthier and whiter group of parents.</p>
<p>Soon, disagreements spilled into the open. Arguments concerned everything from how PTA money was spent, to accusations that some white parents were hoarding computers for their kids.</p>
<p>Even ice cream became a point of contention: In the past year, a group of mostly white parents took issue with a school tradition of selling ice cream to raise money. They felt the school shouldn&rsquo;t be serving sugary foods to kids, but the break with tradition angered many minority parents who felt the sales were an important source of money and that ice cream is a harmless treat.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Cries of &lsquo;Segregation&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>A few months later, a small group of families, most of them white, proposed establishing a new public school, to be located inside the existing P.S. 84. Hundreds of minority parents reacted by putting out a press release calling it de facto segregation. The proposal is &#8220;clearly discriminatory,&#8221; the release said. &#8220;Children will suffer the effects of negative stigma as a result of this segregation which will send our City back 120 years!&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Brooklyn, in a majority African-American section of the borough, Councilwoman Letitia James says a handful of predominantly white parents last year asked her if some of their local tax money could be steered to schools in a nearby neighborhood. The parents wanted their kids in schools with a more diverse racial mix, Ms. James says, rather than the majority-black schools in her district.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Cities Get a Makeover</b></p>
<p>Today, cities are refashioning themselves as trendy centers devoid of suburban ills like strip malls and long commutes. In Atlanta, which has among the longest commute times of any U.S. city, the white population rose by 26,000 between 2000 and 2006, while the black population decreased by 8,900. Overall the white proportion has increased to 35% in 2006 from 31% in 2000.</p>
<p>In other cities, whites are still leaving, but more blacks are moving out. Boston lost about 6,000 black residents between 2000 and 2006, but only about 3,000 whites. In 2006, whites accounted for 50.2% of the city&rsquo;s population, up from 49.5% in 2000. That&rsquo;s the first increase in roughly a century.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Washington &mdash; where African-Americans have been in the majority for a half-century &mdash; has lost about 80,000 black residents between 1990 and 2006. Whites had been leaving, too, but recently they&rsquo;ve started coming back. Between 2000 and 2006, Washington gained 24,000 whites and lost 21,000 blacks. Whites are now 32% of the population, up from 28% in 2000.</p>
<p><b>Churches Take a Hit</b></p>
<p>This is a problem for Washington&rsquo;s African-American churches. The past few years, numerous black churches have relocated to suburban Prince George&rsquo;s County, Md., to follow their parishioners. Later this year, Metropolitan Baptist Church (founded by freed slaves during the Lincoln administration) plans to leave town as well.</p>
<p>Some of the remaining black churches are now courting white members. On a recent Sunday, the Rev. John Blanchard, the 64-year-old pastor at Ebenezer United Methodist Church, preached to a thin crowd; several pews were empty {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While his church flounders, the predominantly white Capitol Hill United Methodist Church just down the street is flourishing.  {snip}</p>
<p>In San Francisco, the African-American population has fallen by a third, or about 30,000 people, since 1990, largely due to surging housing costs and redevelopment that destroyed some public housing. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>From Poor to Poorer</b></p>
<p>As middle-class African-Americans have left San Francisco, the remaining black population has gone from poor to poorer. In 1990, half of the city&rsquo;s African-American population was very low-income; by 2005, that number swelled to about two-thirds. The number of black-owned businesses fell 25% between 1997 and 2002.</p>
<p>As blacks migrated to San Francisco&rsquo;s suburbs, so too have many social activities centered on the community. {snip}</p>
<p>The Western Addition, a historically black neighborhood in San Francisco once home to many jazz clubs, has lost much of that character. Powell&rsquo;s Place, an iconic soul-food restaurant that had been located in or around the neighborhood since the 1970s, has moved to Bayview-Hunters Point. Charles Spencer, who owns a barbershop catering to black men, says he has lost many of his customers and is trying to diversify. His Web site has a picture of a white client to go with three black faces.</p>
<p><b>&lsquo;An Act of Faith&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>The city has celebrated its traditional black culture by designating a stretch of Fillmore Street the &#8220;Fillmore Jazz Preservation District,&#8221; yet the businesses that defined the era are now gone or dying. Raye Richardson, owner of Marcus Book Stores &mdash; its motto is &#8220;Books by and about black people everywhere&#8221; &mdash; has been in the Fillmore district since 1946. She remembers the clubs, the black tailor shops and the many black residents who supported her shop. Today, Ms. Richardson says her store is losing money; much of her business comes from mail-order traffic.</p>

			<p>Despite the joy and hope this article might seem to bring, it in no way focuses on what demographic changes are ravaging many suburbs.</p>
<p>Africans might be leaving many cities but they are taking over numerous suburbs that just one generation ago were safe, pleasant places to raise children.</p>
<p>As an example, almost all south suburban Chicago high schools were largely White 30 years ago.  Now, several are all-black, 10-12 are largely African, and three are slowly changing to predominantly African.</p>
<p>Where have the Whites gone?  To relatively remote suburbs southwest of the city (Orland Park, New Lenox, Frankfort, Homer Glen) where a pretty penny is paid to get away what has happened to one-time excellent schools such as Homewood-Flossmoor, Thornwood, and Rich Central.</p>
<p>While many southwestern suburbanites can tell you tales of when grandpa and grandma lived inside Chicago,I personally know of no one who has migrated back into Chicago to avoid decaying south suburbs.</p>

White people developed great cities to satisfy their love for culture, community, and art. When non-whites moved in, whites were forced to take refuge elsewhere in a kind of Middle Ages fortresses of suburban gated communities safe from the barbarian hordes.</p>
<p>Thanks to the efforts of shutting down failed housing projects, many cities are now safe once again. (see: <a href="/news/2008/06/american_murder.html" rel="nofollow">/news/2008/06/american_murder.php</a> )</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my neighborhood is one in which the displaced housing project hordes have been relocated. The problem of non-whites and the problems they create haven&rsquo;t gone away, they&rsquo;ve only been transferred to communities that had no idea that they were chosen to be destroyed.</p>
<p>If you live in such a &#8216;die-versifying&rsquo; community, you know what I&rsquo;m talking about. If not, read the article I posted.</p>

			<p>These White population increases they&rsquo;re touting seem pretty marginal to me.  Do you remember that story in the MSM last year that these cities were losing White population as people were heading for the sunbelt?  Which one is true?  Is this just bait to coax White people to move back?  People moving into these gentrified neighborhoods more often than not don&rsquo;t have kids or they&rsquo;re gay.  How do they expect to maintain stable neighborhoods without families?  How long before the blacks realize that these Whites are trying to raise property values and price them out of their own neighborhoods?  How long before they retaliate?  I live in East TN in a small town, maybe 40,000.  At my place of employment, at least half of the people are from out of state, places like California, Phoenix, Denver.  I have relatives who left the Atlanta area and my own parents moved from Orlando to Asheville, NC.  I don&rsquo;t think White flight has stopped at all.  In fact, it seems to have accelerated and it&rsquo;s in numbers that I haven&rsquo;t seen in my lifetime.    </p>

			<p>Typical anti-white ranting.  Several times the author mentions a negative result of neighborhoods becoming less black: Beloved institutions losing the customers, problems for African-American churches&hellip;, the black population has gone from poor to poorer, black neighborhood has lost much of that character.  Meanwhile whites are &#8220;setting things back 120 years&#8221;, hoarding computers and promoting segregation.  You&rsquo;d think, reading this article, that black neighborhoods have no negative qualities and white neighborhoods have no positive qualities.  I&rsquo;d like to know, Mr. Dougherty, which kind of neighborhood have you chosen to live in?</p>

			<p>Remember that White sometimes is interchangeable with Caucasian. Caucasian includes mixed people from the North Africa, Southwest Asia, and South Asia. And many mestizos put themselves down as Caucasian or counted as Caucasian. I do not believe that the White percentage is increasing. I believe the brown people, who may be counted as White, is increasing. I have seen it in New York City, Boston, and other places. There may be some young White people or childless couples that might move into places like Harlem, but with the overall numbers of White declining as a percentage and absolute numbers cities are not becoming more White/European.</p>

			<p>White people built all of these cities and were the first inhabitants of them, thusly it seems that whites moving back into the cities is a natural correction. White people have always been urban, look at all of the great cities of Europe as opposed to the non-existant cities of the non colonized third world.</p>

			<p>I saw an article on a Swedish site a couple of weeks ago that spoke about the large rise in Sedish families moving to the inner cities.</p>
<p>I was surprised until I saw the last two paragraphs.</p>
<p>&#8220;The number of children living in inner-city Stockholm has increased by 154 percent over the past 30 years, a new survey by Svenska Dagbladet shows.<br>
[&hellip;]<br>
Many parents responding to the Svenska Dagbladet survey argued that the convenience of living in the inner city far outweighs the negatives such as crowded parks, exhaust fumes and segregation.</p>
<p>Close proximity to work, shops and restaurants is cited as the universally most popular reason for choosing to live in the inner city.</p>
<p>Björklid warns however that children brought up in the inner city will not gain the same access to the diversity and immigrant cultures that are more prevalent in the suburbs.</p>
<p>&#8220;These possibilities are clearly better in the suburbs where there is a greater mix of residential areas.&#8221;</p>

			<p>I have to step over my principals: not use opinions and base my judgements on facts. In this case I cannot do it, because the article is stupid by its communistic approach.  Take just one example: &#8220;while most of the 50 largest cities continue to see declines in the share of whites, it is at much-reduced rates.&#8221; In Detroit there is 0(zero)of whites moving out of the city, because there are no more whites in there.<br>
Messing with ambiguous numbers is not going to create love betwenn groups originated on inter-unacceptable planets.</p>

			<p>&#8220;A few months later, a small group of families, most of them white, proposed establishing a new public school, to be located inside the existing P.S. 84.&#8221;</p>
<p>lol  wasn&rsquo;t there an &#8216;AmRen supporter&rsquo; elected to school board in NYC. . ?</p>
<p>&#8220;New York City&rsquo;s borough of Brooklyn has seen its proportion of whites grow to 36.1% in 2006 from 35.9% in 2000 &mdash; the first increase in white share in about a century&hellip; In 2006, whites (in Boston) accounted for 50.2% of the city&rsquo;s population, up from 49.5% in 2000. That&rsquo;s the first increase in roughly a century.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over a Century of silence over real change, but 8 out of 50 cities see an increase of whites, like this one of 0.2 percent, and it is news fit for a big story. </p>
<p>&#8220;The city has celebrated its traditional black culture&hellip; &#8220;</p>
<p>I swear, I read that as, &#8216;it&rsquo;s traditional black failure&rsquo;. I need to get out more. </p>

As I knew before I even read the article, the truth would not be white flight ending, but merely re-routing. We&rsquo;re still fleeing; we&rsquo;re just going different places. Decades ago, when the term &#8220;inner-city&#8221; morphed its meaning from &#8220;centrally located&#8221; and &#8220;convenient&#8221; to &#8220;black&#8221; and &#8220;dangerous,&#8221; white people who wanted to hold onto everything from their hubcaps to their heads vamoosed to the &#8216;burbs. Now   &mdash;   with Section 8 housing facilitating blacks getting out of their ghettoes and moving to OUR areas   &mdash;   we whites are (not of our choosing) on the move again. </p>
<p>Although most of our deluded caucasian brothers and sisters would rather die than admit it, the presence or absence of blacks in any given area is THE PRIMARY CRITERION for choosing where to live for almost ALL whites. It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether they identify as conservative, liberal, &#8220;progressive,&#8221; or anything else: get a white person to put the PC platitudes about Brotherhood and Equality aside for a moment and actually talk TRUTH about their racial preferences in housing, and that is EXACTLY what they&rsquo;ll be forced to confess. </p>
<p>We, as a people, are in a virtually continuous state of white flight. But we can&rsquo;t run forever, and it seems to me that, sooner or later, we&rsquo;re going to have to stop running and make a stand. <br>

			<p>I think this is only a short term trend based on yuppie liberals.  Already, such a supply in St. Louis has dried up.  Even the ones that have moved will move out once they have children, and see the urban school systems.</p>

			<p>In Paris, as Steve Sailer as pointed out, the French live in the cities, while the underclass lives in the suburbs.  In America however, the underclass lives in the cities, while all the working stiffs live in the boring suburbs and commute to the cities.  </p>
<p>I think the French arrangement is preferable.  Middle or upper class blacks are fine.  But I think the housing projects should be in the suburbs.  Living in the cities is so much nicer.  </p>

			<p>I have been in New York City several times recently - I am stunned at how White many areas really are these days. Naturally, many folks are tourists and working people, but clearly large areas of the city are simply filled with Whites. I have never felt more comfortable in that city in over thirty-five years! Stay out of the &#8220;dark&#8221; areas and its damn-near civilized!! Who would have guessed? </p>

			<p>LNN: That&rsquo;s all great, we Americans already know all of this, those in the inner cities have no idea what real Americans are doing, we are preparing, we are buy guns and ammunition at a rate never before seen in the history of the United States, 43% of Americans own guns, and 85% of those guns are owned by the so called &#8220;White man,&#8221; White Men have not voted for Democrats since the early 1970&rsquo;s and we are the deciding vote in every election, this November the Nationalist Party will officially be founded, and if anything in Europe tells us something, over there the Nationalist Parties are dominating the grass movements in every political race, not so just a year ago, almost over night, Sweden, Italy, the Swiss and other nations and people have awoken to the threat. Nationalism is on its way to America, I plan myself to donate time, and money to this movement, we already have a plan, here in San Diego, we plan to organize, Santee, El Cajon, Lakeside, Poway, and other communities, town hall meetings, posters, pollsters, the works. Our plan is to get the word out, have speakers from pro-American groups like the minute men, save our state, and others speak to the people, and most of all door to door registration. These efforts will be repeated throughout CA, and the southwest in particular, and eventually by 2012 elections we the majority will speak in one voice. The time is coming my fellow Americans, that America will have ONE language, English, ONE culture, the American culture, and most of all a secure Border. Like I have said many times in the past, Americans come in all shades of color, but we share a distinct and differing belief, the constitution, the bill of rights, and freedom, an understanding as they were written by the founders of this once great nation.</p>

			<p>Why do we need to preserve &#8216;black culture&rsquo;? They are treated like some disappearing ancient civilisation. There are plenty of &#8216;black culture&rsquo; in the most dangerous areas of the country. It&rsquo;s a culture we should be glad to be rid of. I get sick of young singers and dancers aping disgusting moves, screams, and lyrics from hip hop and r&b.; We have been brainwashed into accepting black culture since otherwise we would throw up at the idea of teen age and any age promiscuity, body jiggling booty grinding &#8216;dancing&rsquo;, multiple baby daddies/mommies, STDs, welfare,murders, drugs etc&hellip;.</p>

			<p>The simple fact is that most whites with any brains have no desire to be around blacks. Almost everyone I know feels the same. In public whites have to put on a good show but in private things are a whole lot different. I agree, blacks are  trashing the suburbs now. They move in, property values decline and the whites flee. Believe me, it&rsquo;s not the color of the skin, it&rsquo;s their dysfunctional culture of robbery, rape and murderous ways.</p>

			<p>If you&rsquo;re White you just can&rsquo;t do anything right( ryhme unintentional).<br>
They whined when we moved (or were chased) out of the cities due to their egregious behavior. Now they whine when we move back into the cities because they are being &#8220;displaced&#8221;. If they had practiced responsible stewardship of the cities of which they were in de facto and de jure control of them there would have been no problem. There isn&rsquo;t one geographic entity that doesn&rsquo;t deteriorate once it comes under their influence, and that includes their ancestoral homes in virtually every country on the African continent. Trillions in monetary AID have been pourted down the rat hole that is Africa with absolutely no remarkable change for the better and the same can be said for what has occurred right here in the USA. </p>
<p>This is just more example of how we really need to live apart from each other. No good ever comes (at least to Whites) from propinquity to Blacks in fact, in a majority of cases it ends in violence with the Whites ususally being on the receiving end. <br>
Separation before conflagration is the only solution.</p>

			<p>White flight is continuing, albeit in a different direction. Third world immigrants/illegal aliens are increasingly choosing small towns and rural areas, in order to obtain &#8216;a better life&rsquo;. Whites respond by moving away, and the emptying cities may now provide demographic relief. The term &#8216;gentrification&rsquo; refers to people (i.e., whites) moving into run-down neighbourhoods and sprucing them up. Trouble is the third world hordes will inevitably move to where things are better, courtesy of whites. In other words, they move in, whites move out, they make a mess, they move out to where whites are, whites move back in, whites clean up the mess, they move back in to where whites are&hellip; and the cycle repeats itself.</p>

			<p>It is true of White People as it is of any other group that they prefer to live amongst one another. As the old saying goes &#8220;Like Likes Like&#8221; But why is it that in almost any decent well to do  White Community when a Chinese or Korean family moves in there is not the upheveal or fear as when certain other groups move in After all Whites are supposed to be such dyed in the wool bigots who invented racism. Who could outwardly and culturaly be more different from White Americans than Asians, yet not provoke this supposed inherent hatred and racism?</p>

<p><i>But I think the housing projects should be in the suburbs. Living in the cities is so much nicer.</i></p>
<p>Personally, I&rsquo;m a rural, small town type myself. But whether your a farm boy or a city boy, the point is that in either scenario <i>we</i> are letting <i>them</i> determine the arrangement (same goes for France, too). The useful, productive and civilized in any society should be relegating the dregs to their corners, not running scared when those lower orders stomp in and forcibly take over.</p>

			<p>I live in a rocky mountain state. We have noticed a huge increase of blacks move into our city and the corresponding increase in violent and non-violent crimes. WHAT A SURPRISE.<br>
 Front page story today on the huge crime increase. Im afraid my beautiful white utopia of Salt Lake is on the map for destruction by blacks. We have been lucky for so long and the luck is running out quickly. Im afraid the population here is incredibly naive about blacks. Im sure they see easy targets here.<br>
  I am so angry. Im sure the (too) welcoming people here will bend over backwards to make the new residents feel comfortable. This will be our downfall to be sure.</p>

			<p>Although it&rsquo;s great to hear that whites are moving back to the cities that they built, one thing to keep in mind is that this is only a redistribution of the white population. As long as white birth rates remain low, and non-whites continue to breed at an alarming rate, we&rsquo;ll simply find ourselves in the same situation as the French in regards to Paris and its suburbs.</p>

			<p>To take my home, NYC, as an example, blacks have only been here for about 100 years. You think those great brownstones in Harlem were built for crack addicts? I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>Blacks came in here in the early 1900s as part of an ethnic cleansing operation. It worked. Whites fled and blacks settled Harlem. They&rsquo;ve pretty much destroyed it as everyone knows.</p>
<p>Now whites and Asians are moving back. They&rsquo;re getting the kind of welcome from blacks that you might expect. Verbal abuse, threats and trashing of their properties. But I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re going anywhere. Blacks can see the handwriting on the wall.</p>
<p>And if high gas prices persist, expect to see more and more reverse ethnic cleansing in Harlem.</p>

			<p>The actual numbers behind the story are remarkably unimpressive.  The gentrification phenomenon only involves a very small portion of the white population, and relatively small portions of the cities themselves.  </p>
<p>The biggest problem is that those white people who would be willing to move into a &#8220;blighted&#8221; but historic neighborhood are probably less likely than most to have children, given local schools.  This might be ok if they are only the vanguard for others, but if the neighborhood has a housing project or two within its boundaries, the local school may be virtually immune to neighborhood changes, and may even get WORSE during gentrification, as black homeowners depart and leave only the children of those in the projects.  </p>
<p>For the vast majority of white couples who want to start families, moving back into cities is simply not a viable option.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;The Western Addition, a historically black neighborhood in San Francisco once home to many jazz clubs,&#8221;</p>
<p>Jazz clubs acting as fronts for drug dealers, stolen merchandise dealers, illegal gambling, pouring moonshine into regular liquor bottles, counterfeiting operations, and most of all, teenage and younger prostitutes who were held in slavery.</p>
<p>In the city of 500,000 during Fillmore&rsquo;s glory days, at least 7 teenage black girls were murdered by their fillmore black pimps who treated the girls like slaves and used the girls as punching bags.</p>
<p>One of the major tourist sights of the city from about 1950 to 1980 was driving along Fillmore and Divisadero at night and viewing the hordes of teen and younger prostitutes and their vicious pimps.  Those pimps, boot leggers and drug dealers were just about worshipped by the rest of the blacks in the city.</p>
<p>It is where the &#8220;Rev&#8221; Jim Jones had his operation before he moved it to Guyana and murdered 900 of his followers, mostly old ladies, single moms and their children.</p>
<p>And the black bloc voters elected every politician in the city for all those years until the White gay rights, tree worshippers and outright lunatic fringe became powerful in the city </p>

			<p>&#8220;Is this just bait to coax White people to move back?&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
You are probably right.  This sounds like a press release from a real estate organization. If you read articles about downtown Los Angeles you will hear about all the upscale condos and the wonderful night club life and how all the rich younger whites and retired people are moving into all those condos so the young can &#8220;walk to work&#8221; and the retired can go to concerts at Disney Hall ($100 to $300 per ticket) </p>
<p>But just try the &#8220;Ten PM Monday through Friday windows test.&#8221;  Drive past all those pricey upscale condos and lofts and you will not see lights and curtains.  You will see mile after mile of dark windows.  No one is home because no one will buy those condos.</p>
<p>Another factor is that employers have been moving out of downtown Los Angeles for the last 50 years.  Even a lot of the government agencies have moved to safer area.  There are more jobs in West Los Angeles than there are downtown. So the move to downtown walk to work slogan is useless.  There are at least 8 areas (airport, harbor, W. VAlley, E. Valley etc) that have more jobs than downtown does.  And people would rather live closer to work unless their job site is surrounded by criminals just out of jail, horrible homeless etc.</p>
<p>I call these kind of articles secondary advertising.  Just get a regular newspaper to publich an article pushing your product.</p>

			<p>Whites moving back in to cities is in my opinion a major mistake.  People in cities generally have smaller families and this trend can only contribute to the already accelerating White population decrease.</p>
<p>My view is that White Americans need to avoid the cities and head back out to the ethnically homogeneous countryside and massively repopulate it with huge White families.  We need to rebuild and repopulate all of the small and medium-sized towns, villages, and rural areas and relearn the host of necessary skills needed to be a successful and cohesive ethnic group just as we used to be before the post-WWII rise of suburbia and America&rsquo;s mega-cities. </p>
<p>We need to rebuild an extensive, tight-knit network of linked small towns/villages and rural areas across America and Canada where we can all work together toward common goals for the good of our people, just as it used to be in pre-WWII America, Canada, Europe, Australia, and other Western countries.  Additionally, modern technology like the internet can only improve communication, cooperation, and networking opportunities.</p>
<p>If case you haven&rsquo;t noticed this already, let me spell it out clearly: people in cities are utter slaves to The System more than anyone else because they are so dependent on it for nearly all of their needs.  Nearly all necessities are imported in to cities from the countryside, and city-dwellers are basically helpless because they depend on The System for even the most basic things like water/food, shelter, electricity, etc.  Most life-long city-dwellers are often helplessly dependent types   &mdash;   they are generally clueless, mollycoddled, lazy, decadent, and prone to mass-hysteria and violence should a crisis or series of crises break out since they no longer know any basic survival skills (and again, there really is no true independence or control of your own destiny in cities because nearly everything is imported in to them).  </p>
<p>Out in the countryside though you and your family/group/community are largely responsible for your own destiny.  As long as you have the skills and determination, along with a strong community network, you and your family/community can become much less dependent on The System for all of your needs, i.e. you are more able to control how you want to live your life.  It is clear that people in cities are generally dependent CONSUMERS (importers) while people in the countryside are generally self/communally-reliant PRODUCERS (exporters)   &mdash;   which do you prefer to be?</p>
<p>Out in the countryside (it&rsquo;s already overwhelmingly White-owned, by the way) we can enjoy the beauty of nature and be good stewards of the land (in cities, however, it&rsquo;s all ugly gray concrete and ugly steel); we can avoid pollution, crime, dependence, ethnic/racial &#8216;diversity,&rsquo; and the other pitfalls of urban living; we can rebuild our own schools and other cultural institutions and avoid being indoctrinated and controlled by an overwhelming central government which is run by one-world internationalists, open-borders types, and greedy free-traders; we can set up our own independent media systems, non-corrupt local governments, and strong regional economies; and we can become more self and communally sufficient by relearning critical skills like agriculture, water and soil management, construction, carpentry/forestry, animal husbandry, hunting/foraging, and many other indispensable trades, skills, and occupations which are necessary for long-term survival and cultural continuity but have since been lost as Whites have been herded in to cities and suburbs in the past few decades.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Nationalism is on its way to America&#8221;,</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something to be happy about?  It didn&rsquo;t work the first time around - for a reason. Life is dynamic, not static. There is NO going back - ever.  For Right or Left.  There is certainly always the chance to continue repeating the same mistakes. Or, what is known as &#8220;the compulsion to repeat&#8221;. But is that what we need?  It usually comes in the form of one type of Socialist Utopia or another. Nationalism or Communism - same place, different starting point.  Both are attempts to solve all of Mankinds problems with one over-riding Explanation.  IT CAN NOT BE DONE!<br>
The problem with the West today is its incredible inability to face this unpleasant fact and begin to create a System that requires continual renewal and modification.  But, unfortunately, it would appear as if not enough people are even aware of the nature of our problem and lack the psychological and intellectual maturity and patience to engage in any form of self-criticism without letting anxiety interfere with their self-examination.<br>
So they end up clubbing each other over the head with Absolutes.  Has it ever occurred to anyone that it&rsquo;s a little odd that there can even be TWO Absolutes?  <br>
They seem to be oblivious to the fact that the lust for finality is the mark of childishness.</p>
<p>There most definitely could be a Movement.  I certainly hope so, but for God&rsquo;s sake please, let&rsquo;s not use the word Nationalism.  It might sound paradoxical, but we have a better chance of preserving what was best in our Republic if we steer clear of a word that has done far more harm than good.<br>

			<p>I&rsquo;m skeptical about those numbers.<br>
I believe the author has not accounted for the fact that hispanics are classified as white in police reports and census forms. The numbers are skewed and simply reflect the large numbers of hispanics moving to these areas and classifying themselves as white whenever it benefits them. Or to screw up the census to hide their true numbers.<br>
The irony is that they are the founders of &#8220;La Raza&#8221; and among the most racist of any race or subgroup living in America.</p>
<p>The real &#8220;white flight&#8221; will be to communities that have the backbone and wherewithal to protect us from invading hordes and social parasites. Then &#8220;white flight&#8221; will become &#8220;WHITE FIGHT&#8221;, to preserve what we have worked so hard to attain.</p>
<p>There are a few communities like this in IL, but there are far more without the guts or will to stand up for honest hard-working Americans and their families. West Chicago, Elgin, and Aurora are all examples of the latter. Someone recently referred to West Chicago as a &#8220;social experiment&#8221;<br>
We are looking for a place to live to get away from the third-world-ification of a once nice community.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Sandstorm&#8221; You are correct - I should have noted that. Overall NYC is, of course, chock-full of nonwhites from every far flung corner of the earth, and their numbers are growing at geometric rates! Still, in many areas that one would previously have avoided like Hell itself, Whites have clearly put things back in order, at least temporarily. Back in the 80&rsquo;s, it seemed hardly a block of that city outside perhaps Park Ave. was safe to tread as a White man!! </p>

			<p>&#8220;Not to be racist,.. (Posted by at 1:58 PM on July 22)</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t sweat it  &mdash;  you&rsquo;re among friends. No apologetics necessary re red herrings like the words &#8220;racism&#8221; and &#8220;hate&#8221;.</p>
<p>City living was fine when I was growing up in segregated Richmond, Va. in the 1940s. The word &#8220;racism&#8221; was never heard (having apparently been invented only a few years earlier), blacks stayed in their own part of town when not working and were no problem, and no one I knew &#8220;hated&#8221; them.</p>
<p>Imagine, this word &#8220;racism&#8221; that now so rules our lives so dismally had apparently never, in the entire history of the world, ever been uttered or written until the 1930s!! And today the word RULES!</p>
<p>I went looking for the word&rsquo;s history, and came upon an article written by Sam Francis in 1999 for American Renaissance. Sam Francis said about the word &#8220;racism&#8221;:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;it has no use other than as a kind of fancy curse word, the purpose of which is simply to demonize anyone who expresses the ideas it is supposed to describe.&#8221;</p>

I say good riddance to rap, welfare, baby daddies, bling, ebonics, STD&rsquo;s, foul language, greasy food, sagging pants,  etc., etc.  If this is (ahem) &#8220;culture&#8221;, I&rsquo;d prefer savagery.</p>

			<p><i>Whites moving back into cities is, in my opinion, a major mistake. <b> People in cities generally have smaller families and this trend can only contribute to the already accelerating White population decrease.  </b>..White Americans need to avoid the cities and head back out to the ethnically homogeneous countryside and massively repopulate it with huge White families.  In case you haven&rsquo;t noticed it already, let me spell it out: people in cities are utter slaves to The System .. [they] are  basically helpless because they depend on The System for even the most basic things.<br>

<p><i>&#8220;In Paris, as Steve Sailer as pointed out, the French live in the city, while the underclass lives in the suburbs. <br>
In America however, the underclass lives in the cities, while all the working stiffs live in the boring suburbs and commute to the cities. <br>
I think the French arrangement is preferable. Living in the cities is so much nicer.&#8221;<br>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..<br>
Perhaps so.  Nicer to some, yes, but not congenial to families.  Zsidoazas makes excellent points about the deleterious effects cities have on families.</p>
<p>The French situation has historical, social, legal, and economic reasons. In contrast to the British Isles where power was  more dispersed, less centralized, and the great aristocrats were primarily based in the country,  the aristocracy in France was urban. They were <i> required  </i>to live where the king could keep an eye on them.  So wealth and power in France were heavily concentrated in the cities. Everyone who was anyone lived in town.  Thus, the population gravitated to where the money was. The countryside was bled to make the cities splendid. Everything was done for the cities while the provinces were neglected.  It was much  the same in Bourbon Spain.  </p>
<p>Even in Paris today, you notice the difference the moment you step over the city line [with the notable exception of several wealthy communities on the western side]. The buildings  outside the city line become imperceptibly shabbier, less opulent. The flowers and trees disappear.  So do the elegant shops and restaurants. The parks are fewer and less well kept. The sidewalks seem dirtier.  Even the pavement is cracked and inferior. The grimy, smelly, industrial areas are located here.  And so are the Arabs and the Africans.  And the housing projects.  And the crime.  No wonder the wealthy don&rsquo;t want to live in the suburbs!  They must be amazed that in America it is the reverse.</p>
<p>But consider this:  Cities may be comfortable  and convenient   &mdash;   for the childless, that is.  But cities are crowded, apartment space is precious, and city living is expensive. Such conditions are not conducive to raising children.  Particularly not to large families. This is one reason why, historically, the French have not had large families or any population increase. Instead of children, they have a dog or cat.  It&rsquo;s a fact: city people don&rsquo;t have large families.  Since the 1600&rsquo;s France has not had a surplus population to export.  Unlike all other European countries, how much French immigration have we received in the USA?  Virtually none. </p>
<p>And thus, it is one reason why the French have been so vulnerable to the current racial invasion, and also why their government has been  (for a very long time, more than a century) so thirsty for more population    &mdash;   anywhere they can find it.   In other words, city living and low birth rates have been their undoing. Yes, life in French cities is comfortable;  but expensive, and the present generation enjoys its comforts at the expense of future generations that remain unborn.</p>

Why us nasty old &#8216;racist&rsquo; Whites would infinitely rather live with and among our own kind&hellip; than among Blacks, Hispanics or both! The liberals just can&rsquo;t understand why we are so against living in communities with skyrocketing crime, vandalism and violence from the mental primitives of African or Mexican/Latino descent.</p>

			<p>I guess I&rsquo;m the only New Yorker who reads Amren. So here is how it really is. Contrary to what some posters have claimed, New York City is becoming VERY white! Thank God! Essentially blacks and hispanics are being priced out. For example, I live in the Lower East Side. I pay $2000 a month for a 300 square-foot studio apartment (at least I don&rsquo;t have to buy gas, insurance or make a car payment). <br>
The only blacks and hispanics that live in my neighborhood anymore are those that have lived there for over 10-15 years and therefore have rent control. In fact, rent control is the only thing that is keeping blacks in NYC at all. Rent prices are outrageous.<br>
But even though I pay too much rent, I don&rsquo;t mind it. I love it here. There is so much to do and never a dull moment. I really like being able to walk to work. I&rsquo;m surrounded by world-class restaurants and a lot of like-minded whites. True, NYers are a more liberal crowd, but all that means is that we don&rsquo;t talk openly about our distaste for black culture. Trust me, white NYers get it. I mean, after all, we have had to live with blacks for so long. All those whinny liberals that talk about the joys of diversity are the ones that live in the suburbs and talk like that because they have never lived around blacks. <br>
Even Brooklyn neighborhoods close to Manhattan are becoming whiter by large margins. Take Williamsburg and Fort Green, both extremely close to the city, for example. It&rsquo;s all young white kids moving in and the rents are reflecting it. The reason these neighborhoods are so white now is because they are the neighborhoods that are closest to Manhattan.<br>
I can&rsquo;t speak for other cities but in the past 10 years there has been a PHENOMENAL DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGE in NYC. It&rsquo;s really safe here now and that is due to the fact that blacks have to come in to the city from their Brooklyn ghettos. <br>
Also, I have heard a lot of concern about urban residents being single and not having children. This is probably true at first, as we are in the initial phase of reclaiming our great city. However, we are the buffer group that is taking a lot of the heat so that in another 10 years NYC really will be a great place to raise a child. I wouldn&rsquo;t want to have my child go to school with blacks, therefore, I&rsquo;m waiting. But these days, blacks are so few in numbers. They are NOT being replaced with hispanics, but rather with more young, educated, ambitious whites. Think of it this way: all new NYers are white, everyone who moves into Manhattan these days is white. I strongly encourage anyone to visit NYC now and see what it is like. Go to the Village and the LES. What black can afford the $1500 starting rate for a studio apartment in Manhattan? And of course the real estate industry is all over this. <br>
Guilliani is a real jerk, I agree, but he did manage to clean this city up and he&rsquo;ll always have my respect for standing up against blacks. Because there is a huge black constituency here and it took some balls to say that we wouldn&rsquo;t put up with it. And other mayors should follow suit. Who wants to have to drive an hour just to get to work? </p>

			<p>Sorry but one more post. Here is the basic strategy to cleaning up cities. It&rsquo;s the one NYC used in the mid-90&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Phase one, initiate a police crackdown throughout the city on petty crime, graffiti, jay walking, panhandling, etc&hellip; Take the criminal out of his environment. Even though they can beat a lot of the charges in court, they&rsquo;ll have to spend a night or two in jail. Also, it&rsquo;s a great way to catch career criminals and felons with warrants as they tend to have behavioral patterns of breaking all laws.</p>
<p>Phase two, create a few neighborhoods close to the metro with an extremely high police presence. That way, all the whites will flock to them and be protected. Naturally, the rents will rise, the property value will rise, and more whites will follow. (I mean, don&rsquo;t we already pay a pretty penny in our suburbs.) Those who can&rsquo;t afford to live there, will move close by and gradually the police umbrella will spread out and so will the rent increase, thereby preventing new blacks from moving in and gradually forcing old blacks out. After all, a brotha won&rsquo;t want to use his foodstamps at pricey gourmet and organic supermarkets and will thereby have an incentive to leave on his own free will- especially ever time he gets a summons for play his loud rap music.</p>
<p>Phase three: After white area is stabilized, move police presence to next area and repeat.</p>
<p>That is what has been done over and over in NYC for the past 15 years. Now, former ghettos like the Lower East Side where I live, Hell&rsquo;s Kitchen, Chinatown, East Village, Alphabet City, etc&hellip;. are now some of the safest, most exciting and culturally stimulating neighborhoods in America- and by culturally stimulating I do not mean diverse.</p>
<p>Funny though it may seem, a good indicator of how safe and desirable a city or neighborhood is, I think, is the amount of celebrities who inhabit and frequent it. I see celebrities all the time, any more, they&rsquo;re all over the place. It&rsquo;s cool when you walk down your own block and see Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, Leonardo DeCaprio, Kirstin Dunst, and others just hanging out, and no one bothers them either because it&rsquo;s so normal.<br>
They even say that NYC is becoming a playground for the rich, so yes, there is a downside to it for poor whites. However, as I can attest, it is still true that if you move here with the right attitude and ambition, you can succeed. And as I have learned, it takes money to live in an all white utopia whether that be the new NYC or some suburb or small town, or in the countryside. But I believe we&rsquo;re worth every penny of it.<br>

			<p>To Jordan:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always loved NYC (I lived there 3 years in the late 60s), and your two posts have brightened my day. Your posts are convincing (!), but I believe there are some other regular posters here that live in NYC, so I am going to wait to hear from them before feeling too good.</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the trouble of your two posts  &mdash;  not only their content is heartening, but also the obvious easy intelligence of yourself, the writer. I would like very much to think that bright, young whites like yourself are filling up the city and transforming it.</p>
<p>John Lennon (whose name rarely appears on this site) said that NYC was the &#8220;center of the universe,&#8221; and that&rsquo;s the way it always felt to me. May it shine bright once again!</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.<br>
You&rsquo;re not quite alone, Jordan. There are a few of us out here. </p>
<p>I take it you&rsquo;re a new New Yorker, and you haven&rsquo;t been mugged yet.</p>
<p>You wrote an interesting and optimistic post.  Your glowing comments are true, but  mainly true of Manhattan, and  of Manhattan alone.   Yes, some nearby neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens have become Manhattan  &#8220;suburbs&#8221; (but they&rsquo;ve been that way for years).  The rest of the larger city continues darkening, and becoming more foreign by the year.  Just like Paris, Manhattan is a white enclave surrounded by a dark ring of burgeoning, outlying suburbs.  Interesting comparison.</p>
<p>As everywhere in the US, for the white population, having been stripped of any legal or open ways of preserving white neighborhoods, the only way left is &#8220;discrimination&#8221; by money. In other words, it&rsquo;s getting very expensive to be white! The people who have promoted this demographic transformation don&rsquo;t worry about this, as they have plenty of money.  This is exactly the same tactic used in Latin America where the rich  (and white) few percent live in opulence while all the rest are poor and wretched.   They are living on borrowed time.  </p>
<p>If you are rich or super-rich, Manhattan the place for you.  And yes, celebrities are all over the place (but who cares?).  At the  least, in order to live here, you have to have a very high income, if you don&rsquo;t have rent control.   But what is considered a high income in most of America is practically poor in Manhattan.  And those fabulous restaurants you mention all cost big  money and are not frequented by working class people. Nor are those organic and health-food supermarkets and fancy delis. They are not places where working people shop.  All of these are too pricey for most blacks and browns   &mdash;    and  they are for most white people too.  Those of us who can afford to stay here are a  lucky minority and not representative of the overall white population.  </p>
<p>As I see it, New York is heading in the direction of São Paulo or Mexico City  (and so many other Latin or Third World  cities) where the  gilded rich live a charmed life behind barbed wire and bullet-proof glass, protected by armed guards, traveling by helicopter, and  removed from the squalor, crime, and ugly realities that torment most of the rest of the population.   Having seen these other cities,  this is not a trend that I want to see here or that I consider healthy   &mdash;    a few very rich and a great many very poor.  That seems to be the way we&rsquo;re presently  going, and New york is just a harbinger for the rest of the country.   I take alarm.  As a very long-time resident, I think your initial thrill  with New York will eventually wear off.  But good luck to you. Enjoy it while you can.</p>

<p>You know what&rsquo;s interesting is that you can visit a city like Savannah, GA, which is overwhelmingly black and you see very few black people in the tourist areas.  You see very few policeman or security but the housing projects are just a couple of blocks away.  What&rsquo;s keeping Biggy G and his posse from terrorizing the Historic District?  </p>

Posted by ghw</p>
<p>Actually, I attribute my &#8220;racial awakening&#8221; to the second time I got mugged- at gunpoint by five blacks. When I moved to NYC in 2000 at the age of 19, I was your typical liberal, except I didn&rsquo;t have any money when I arrived, I mean zero. Thus, I lived in homeless shelters or couch-surfed for several months. After I got a steady income I was forced to live in black and Hispanic neighborhoods because I couldn&rsquo;t afford white neighborhoods. I chose to view it as a learning experience though. You see, I come from all-white rural Illinois, so I thought it would be good for me. In black communities and in homeless shelters, however, I learned how blacks really felt about whites- they are very open about it. I could tell you some stories. <br>
Although I do appreciate your argument and I can empathize with you ghw, I strongly disagree that NYC becoming anything like Mexico City (yes, I&rsquo;ve been there and I speak Spanish). NYC&rsquo;s chief charm is that you are free to walk about where you want without fear and experience all the best the world has to offer- yes, I must qualify that by excluding that to most of Manhattan and the emerging Brooklyn/Queens neighborhoods. But no one, and I mean no one, not even blacks, want to frequent black neighborhoods. There is no reason to be in a black neighborhood in the first place. And because they have been pushed out so far you don&rsquo;t have to be worried about getting lost in the wrong part of town so long as you stay in Manhattan below 110th street- for none NYers that is the vast majority of Manhattan.</p>
<p>Though, yes it may be true that black neighborhoods are still bad, and even getting worse, that issue is moot because they&rsquo;re located too far out of the city to matter. Essentially, they&rsquo;ve become a nonissue. Let them kill themselves if they want. They only make their presence felt on an individual basis when they come into Manhattan. Black neighborhoods will always be bastions of misery and despair due to their own pathology of victimhood. We shouldn&rsquo;t try to compare them to our standards. I moved to the city starting from scratch in quest for the classic &ldquo;American Dream.&rdquo; They&rsquo;ll never have that because they expect it to be given to them.</p>
<p>Yes, it is true that NYC is home to the super-rich, but we also have a strong middle-class and a passionate community of young, ambitious whites. So what about the rich? The interesting thing about NYC is that there are no social castes. I have friends that are literally millionaires and friends that are penniless squatters. One of the beauties of white culture is that we don&rsquo;t have to judge a man&rsquo;s worth by the size of his wallet but rather by his character. </p>
<p>Optimism is the only way towards our salvation. Jared Tyler is so inspiring in that respect. We cannot as a race resign ourselves to defeatism, that is a black thing. We&rsquo;ve lost ground, true, hence it&rsquo;s high time we reclaim our birthright. NYC is the modern day Imperial Rome or Athens if you like. The ghettoization of NYC coupled with white flight was the equivalent of the dark ages, no pun intended. Thus it&rsquo;s high time for an American Renaissance. </p>

			<p>I was making a general statement. How can I be expected to account for every obscure ethnicity in the world? My claims stand: NYC is rapidly becoming more white. And what the heck is an Ashkenazi Jew anyway (rhetorical question)? And why should I care? What does that have to do with anything?<br>
No one ever had to worry about being mugged, beaten, rapped or killed by a Ashkenzi Jew. Look around, anyone can see, NYC is becoming the ideal city. NYC will always be a cultural melting pot. What made it so miserable for so many years from the mid-60&rsquo;s to mid-90&rsquo;s was that it was overrun with blacks and Hispanics. Now whites are reclaiming it at cutthroat speed- all the better.</p>

			<p>I liked the exchange between Jordan and GHW.  But with all respect Jordan, you don&rsquo;t know what it is like to be poor and white in NYC. What you were doing was &#8220;Slumming&#8221;. That&rsquo;s when a comfortable White Middle or Upper Middle Class person goes it &#8220;alone&#8221; with just a penny in his pocket to see if he can make it on his own. It&rsquo;s more like an experiment in living then a desperate attempt to make ends meet<br>
It&rsquo;s not sincere at all, and there is NO coincidence that you were a liberal at this time. No matter how hard it was for you you were always a phone call away from being rescued by your family.<br>
The world is filled with White people like that and for me, they are part of the problem for poor Whites who can&rsquo;t get a break, have to have close and continuous contact with Blacks and other Non-Whites, and often with very unhappy results, and then have to listen to Whites like you tell them there&rsquo;s &#8220;no excuse. I made it out ok.&#8221;  But the fact is, you were never in it.</p>

<p>A very important side of the issue, and it&rsquo;s good that you remind us.</p>
<p>But I think you are reading into Jordan&rsquo;s posts statements that he didn&rsquo;t make or even imply (e.g., &#8220;there&rsquo;s &#8216;no excuse. I made it out ok.&rsquo;&rdquo;), and attributing to him circumstances that apparently weren&rsquo;t his (&#8220;you were always a phone call away from being rescued by your family.&#8221; Actually, Jordan said &#8220;(I) was forced to live in black and Hispanic neighborhoods because I couldn&rsquo;t afford white neighborhoods.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Jordan seems like a very bright guy, and I assume (perhaps naively?) that he made his way out of poverty by his own efforts. Surprisingly quickly, I&rsquo;ll grant. But from his writing I suspect he may be VERY bright.</p>
<p>From what both of you and ghw have said, it seems clear that no white person should now move to NYC unless they have some wealth, or the means to have a good income.</p>
<p>Looking back on my three years in NYC in the late 60s, I realize that the friends I had that were of average intelligence were persons born in NYC, and all the persons I knew who had come to NYC from elsewhere were above average intelligence.</p>
<p>I subscribed to a local newspaper in Appalachia a few years back, and every time the paper had an article about some local who was especially talented or able, it turned out they were no longer local but had moved away, frequently to Manhattan!</p>
<p>NYC was always a magnet for the brightest from all over the U.S. It sounds like it&rsquo;s now resuming that role. And if the bright whites collecting there now have their heads screwed on even half straight about race, as Jordan says they do, that&rsquo;s grounds for rejoicing.</p>
<p>I wish I were bright enough and able enough to move back there  &mdash;  I loved living there, and the insane attitudes about race here in Berkeley drive me nuts. (But it is nice to be a 10-minute bike ride away from a regional park here in Berkeley. But, NYC has natural beauty too).</p>

			<p>Many thanks for your kind words H. Dumpty. I too have no idea know how Danny Boy came to such conclusions. I&rsquo;m from rural Illinois, and I never was a phone call away from being bailed out by my parents. Although, I would like to think that if they had the means they would have wanted to help; however, it just wasn&rsquo;t in the cards. And even though I made it on my own, I never could have done it without the kindness and goodwill of strangers, i.e. strangers letting me crash on their sofa for days at a time, dedicated case managers at various homeless shelter who wanted to help an earnest individual trying to make it, and the countless hours of mentoring by my professors at Hunter College, a public school paid for by a combination of scholarships, the Pell Grant, TAPS, and federally subsidized student loans. </p>
<p>I noticed in Danny Boy&rsquo;s comments a kind of resentment and disbelief. It&rsquo;s a sad state of affairs when whites adopt the defeatist attitude and victim mentality that black America thrives upon. I would imagine that you too, H. Dumpty, will come across some animosity due to your optimism and good faith people. That is just how it is for optimists: we&rsquo;re perpetually labeled naive. I, however, refuse to let myself become an embittered, jaded New Yorker.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I stand by what I said: anyone with the right attitude and ambition can make it here. By &ldquo;make it here&rdquo; I do not mean become fabulously wealthy, I just mean that you can make a decent life for yourself in a white community. Oscar Wilde said it best: &ldquo;we are all in the gutter but some of us are looking at the stars.&rdquo; I live by those words.</p>

<p>As someone who lives in Wilmington, NC, a mostly white town similar to Savannah, I&rsquo;d have to say that here, the posse does terrorize the down-town district on occassion. When there are muggings reported downtown, or shopkeepers have problems with local teens, they often don&rsquo;t reveal the race of the suspects but everyone is frightened just the same. It was a minor story, and the media here reports on these occasionally, when an 80 year old white lady was beat up and robbed walking to her mailbox. The news media fingered the perpetrator as a black guy. Plenty of killings go on in this area also.  <br>
