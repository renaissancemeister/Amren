<p>[Josephine] Baker&rsquo;s movie [&#8220;Princess Tam-Tam,&#8221; 1935] is one of five recalled on a set of U.S. postage stamps being released Wednesday to honor vintage black cinema. Ceremonies marking the sale of the stamps will be held at the Newark Museum in New Jersey, which is holding a black film festival.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Another poster, for a 1921 release, provides a taste of the racial divide that sent the young Baker to Europe to pursue her career.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Sport of the Gods,&#8221; the poster proclaims, is based on a book by Paul Laurence Dunbar, &#8220;America&rsquo;s greatest race poet,&#8221; and it adds that the film has &#8220;an all-star cast of colored artists.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other posters in the set of 42-cent stamps are:</p>
<p>* &#8220;Black and Tan,&#8221; a 19-minute film released in 1929 featuring Duke Ellington and his Cotton Club Orchestra.</p>
<p>* &#8220;Caldonia,&#8221; another short at 18 minutes, which was released in 1945. It showcased singer, saxophonist and bandleader Louis Jordan.</p>
<p>* &#8220;Hallelujah,&#8221; a 1929 movie released by MGM. It was one of the first films from a major studio to feature an all-black cast. Producer-director King Vidor was nominated for an Academy Award for his attempt to portray rural African-American life, especially religious experience.</p>

Postage stamps are passe.</p>
<p>The postal service is always looking for ways to get more people to buy more stamps and not use them so they make a profit.</p>
<p>That they make stamps with ducks, flora, WWI airplanes etc just shows a need to generate new avenues of revenue.</p>
<p>Some will point to this as yet another &#8216;civil rights&rsquo; victory. I see it for what it is. Pandering for profits.</p>

			<p>Bet Jesse and Al will want a stamp of themselves now. We used to go to the post office and just buy a book of stamps. Now we have to LOOK at which stamps we are buying! One time at Christmas time, I didn&rsquo;t pay attention and got a whole book of Kwanza stamps! I did take them back though and told them I didn&rsquo;t believe &#8220;in Kwanza&#8221; and they gave me a real Christmas book of stamps&hellip;..</p>

			<p>&#8220;Stamp touts &ldquo;an all-star cast of colored artists.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t it not too long ago they were selling stamps honoring the black, anti-white racist Malcolm X?  It doesn&rsquo;t say much for them when they honor people like that and Tookie Williams and other convicted murderers and rapists, but then if they didn&rsquo;t honor them there wouldn&rsquo;t be many to choose from.</p>

			<p>  What? No footage of Stepin Fetchit? How about Stymie and Farina? And don&rsquo;t forget Aunt Jemimah! They&rsquo;ve left out the black film characters most of us remember best. And, to get serious for a moment, don&rsquo;t forget that James Baskett received a special Academy Award for his role as Uncle Remus in &#8220;Song of the South.&#8221; But of course the gutless Disney organization kept that movie under wraps for many years because the NAACP didn&rsquo;t like it.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Josephine Baker&rsquo;s movie [&ldquo;Princess Tam-Tam,&rdquo; 1935] is one of five recalled on a set of U.S. postage stamps being released Wednesday to honor vintage black cinema.&#8221; </p>
<p>WRONG: &#8220;Princess Tam-Tam&#8221; is a part of French cinematic history starring Baker who made a sensation in Paris in the 20s and 30s because she was unique and exotic in their culture. In the US, she was a minstrel player. No way can &#8220;PTT&#8221; be construed as a black movie. It&rsquo;s very French, and Baker, who spoke fluent French, comes off as French as any other actor in the movie. Baker hated the US and permanently expatriated herself after a failed comeback in the 1950s. Her husbands were all White and the trashy cable bio about her life greatly exaggerates her committment to race relations. Her movie, &#8220;Zou Zou&#8221; is the same. Baker was buried with honors reserved for French statesmen. She was always French before she was black. Sorry, they&rsquo;ll have to issue a &#8220;Blacula&#8221; stamp instead.</p>

			<p> Actually Black film makers did remarkable work on fantastically low budgets during the Jim Crow era and deserve recognition for their artistic contributions.<br/>
  That said how about a white film maker making equally good use of the media in the internet and producing a great pro-white film to protest todays Jim Crow laws against White people?</p>

			<p>Wait till Obama gets elected; We could see U.S. postage stamps with the reverends Wright, Jackson and Sharpton leading in the Afro-centric church catagorie. How about stamps with those wonderful, fun-loving Black Panthers, or Nation of Islam characters? Why not, I ask; Afterall Obama did say they were friends. </p>

			<p>Josephine Baker, a pretty hot black babe, had white directors for her movies and lived in France, not Africa. She also supported French president Charles de Gaulle during the Marxist student uprising in 1968.</p>

			<p>Hasn&rsquo;t this country worshiped blacks enough?  Enough with the deification.  How about a set of stamps showing the worst black criminals out there?  Oh I know why, the post office will be publishing them for 10 solid years and still not finish the job.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t worry about honoring black culture.<br/>
I worry this honoring must be adequate. <br/>
─────────<br/>
There was a hot discussion in Detroit in what form to honor Rosa Parks.<br/>
 <br/>
I said: there is a steel arm with a fist hanging in the center of Detroit. The arm is Joe Louis&rsquo;s.  Why is an arm only? </p>
<p>They said: because it was the part of his body, which brought him fame.</p>
<p>I said: Rosa is famous for refusing to move her a… I mean, another part of her body while on a bus. So wouldn&rsquo;t it be logical to install her steel a… I mean, another part of her body in the White House&rsquo;s Hall of Fame?!</p>
<p>They said: no, this would be too erotic.</p>
<p>The moral:<br/>
What moral? What moral has to do with political correctness!?<br/>

			<p>After a long string of African-American Heritage stamps, the Postal Service is running out of Blacks of any notable accomplishment, not that the most of the Blacks who have adorned those stamps accomplished much.  Actually, I think Black motion pictures, made in the days when they were pretty much barred from mainstrean movies, are probably one of the few notable accomplishments Blacks should take pride in.  I would be be happy if Spike Lee and Danny Glover and all the rest of their clique would get out of Hollywood and go make their own movies in their own ghettos for their own people.</p>

			<p>Honestly, I don&rsquo;t have a problem with this.  Blacks of this bygone era were far more civilized than their modern day, arrogant offspring.  Though not perfect by any means, this generation nevertheless faced much more adversity than ANY black can claim today.  I say, giving them a stamp collection is no big deal.  It&rsquo;s much less offensive than a Kwanzaa stamp, and besides, it&rsquo;s not as if WE have to use them.<br/>
I do have one question though:  Who is going to use these stamps, if not whites?  I mean, blacks are notorious for not paying their bills.  Then again, maybe the inmates writing back home to mama will ensure this stamps success.  We&rsquo;ll see.</p>
