						<p>The scene repeats itself daily on city streets: a driver gets stuck bumper to bumper, blocking an intersection and preventing another car from turning left.</p>
<p>But authorities say that was enough to cause Edwin Ramos to unload an AK-47 assault weapon on a man and his two sons, killing them.</p>
<p>The deaths immediately drew public outrage, which intensified when authorities revealed that Ramos, 21, is an illegal immigrant who managed to avoid deportation despite previous brushes with the law.</p>
<p>The case has put San Francisco&rsquo;s liberal politics to the test, setting off a debate over its sanctuary law that shields undocumented immigrants from deportation.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Ramos pleaded not guilty to three counts of murder in the deaths of Anthony Bologna, 49, and his sons, Michael, 20, and Matthew, 16. Bologna and his older son died in the intersection on June 22. His younger son succumbed to his injuries days later.</p>
<p>Shortly after that, police arrested Ramos, a native of El Salvador and reputed member of the Mara Salvatrucha gang, known as MS-13. Investigators believe he was the gunman, though two other men were seen in the car with him.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Amparan declined to discuss details of the case, but he denied his client was involved in gang activity and said Ramos entered the country legally. Federal authorities contend Ramos is undocumented.</p>
<p>The victims&rsquo; family learned that Ramos had been arrested at least three times before the shooting and evaded deportation, largely because of San Francisco&rsquo;s sanctuary status.</p>
<p>The policy, adopted in 1989 by the city&rsquo;s elected Board of Supervisors, bars local officials from cooperating with federal authorities in their efforts to deport illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Bolognas&rsquo; relatives say Ramos apparently benefited from the policy when he reportedly was convicted twice of felonies in 2003 and 2004 but never was turned over for deportation.</p>
<p>&#8220;All San Francisco&rsquo;s sanctuary ordinance has done is bring violence and death to this once-great city,&#8221; said Frank Kennedy, who is married to Anthony Bologna&rsquo;s sister.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>ICE spokesman Timothy Counts said his agency did not receive word of Ramos&rsquo; arrest in March. He said the only communication received about Ramos was an &#8220;electronic message&#8221; from the sheriff&rsquo;s department three hours after his release.</p>
<p>The case has garnered national attention, leading U.S. Rep. Tom Tancredo, R-Colo., and an anti-immigration group called Californians for Population Stabilization to ask the U.S. Department of Justice to take over, alleging San Francisco authorities have mishandled it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because San Francisco&rsquo;s political leaders have already demonstrated their willingness to act in flagrant violation of federal law, I do not believe that local judicial institutions can be trusted to fairly try the case or mete out an appropriate punishment,&#8221; Tancredo said in a letter sent Tuesday to U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Diana Hull, president of Californians for Population Stabilization, called on about a dozen cities nationwide with similar sanctuary policies to end those programs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to remember always that a death-dealing policy like &lsquo;sanctuary&rsquo; hides behind the false mantle of compassion,&#8221; Hull said.</p>

											<p>
							<i>Jaxon Van Derbeken, San Francisco Chronicle, July 24, 2008</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Edwin Ramos, 21, is accused of the June 22 shooting deaths of Tony Bologna, 48, and his sons Michael, 20, and Matthew, 16, in the city&rsquo;s Excelsior district. In an appearance before Judge Lucy Kelly McCabe, Ramos spoke softly and slowly in denying each of the allegations.</p>
<p>The defense sought the gag order after The Chronicle revealed that Ramos was an illegal immigrant who was found to have committed two felonies at age 17 &mdash; a gang-related assault of a Muni passenger and the attempted robbery of a pregnant woman &mdash; but was not surrendered by San Francisco juvenile justice authorities to federal officials for possible deportation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Federal authorities say Ramos, a Salvadoran native whom police believe was involved in the MS-13 street gang, was awaiting deportation proceedings at the time of the slayings after being turned down for temporary residency. But Amparan [Ramos&rsquo;s attorney, Robert Amparan] insisted outside court that Ramos was in the United States legally and that federal officials were wrong about his immigration status.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>McCabe said she saw no grounds to issue a gag order that would prevent attorneys, law enforcement officials and Ramos from talking publicly about the case outside court. She left open the possibility that she would issue an order barring further disclosures related to Ramos&rsquo; juvenile criminal records, which by law are not open to public examination.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Also Wednesday, federal officials provided more details from their records about the chain of events that led to Ramos&rsquo; release from San Francisco city jail in April, despite that he had already been flagged by federal authorities as an illegal immigrant.</p>
<p>Ramos was let go after San Francisco prosecutors declined to charge him in connection with a March 30 arrest on suspicion of weapons and gang violations.</p>
<p>Sheriff Michael Hennessey has said deputies faxed a notice to the local Immigration and Customs Enforcement office four hours after Ramos and a companion were arrested, inquiring about their immigration status. The sheriff says the federal office never replied and that Ramos was released early April 2.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to Tim Counts, spokesman for ICE, the only communication his agency received about Ramos came by way of the electronic request at 3:44 a.m. April 2, nearly two hours after Ramos was released. He said there is no record that ICE received any fax from the Sheriff&rsquo;s Department.</p>
<p>Sheriff&rsquo;s deputies queried the agency by phone April 1 about the man arrested with Ramos, Erick Lopez, and an immigration hold was placed on him, Counts said.</p>

			<p>Well, for all those of you who are considering voting for <b>Obama</b>, let me quote from his speech in Berlin earlier today:</p>
<p><b>&#8220;The walls between the countries with the most and those with the least cannot stand. The walls between races and tribes, natives and immigrants, Christians, and Muslim and Jews, cannot stand. These now are walls we must tear down.&#8221;</b></p>
<p>So, how exactly are you planning on defending American citizens against violent criminals (a.k.a. <i>mucho</i> men) from Mexico and El Salvador?</p>
<p>How exactly are going to prevent the violence, lawlessness, and Marxism from spreading to the U.S. when Obama wants to tear down the border wall?</p>
<p>Please, use your cavesa before you cast your votes on him.</p>

			<p>Clearly the victims&rsquo; family, what is left of it, should sue the city for millions of dollars.  After all, it was their policy which effectively made the murders possible.  If it were me, I would sue the city until it didn&rsquo;t have a dollar left to its name; perhaps then, the city council would understand that it does not pay to be a haven for illegal criminals.</p>

			<p>Well look for more gun control laws in The Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of California. I&rsquo;m just wondering how an illegal immigrant with 2 felonies obtained an AK47? The liberals will undoubtedly blame the gun. As a resident of California, and proud gun owner, I know first hand the laws concerning &#8220;assault weapons&#8221;. It&rsquo;s a felony in California to posess a magazine/clip with a higher capacity than 10 rounds, and it&rsquo;s also a felony to use said magazine/clip without a &#8220;lock&#8221;. I like the way the PC spin immediately kicks in, referring to the AK47 as an &#8220;assault weapon&#8221;, which it is not, it&rsquo;s a semi-automatic rifle. Unless it was an illegal automatic rifle. </p>

<p>Posted by GetBackJack at 9:28 PM on July 24 </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget this dope, planning to make a run for governor:</p>
<p>http://www.sfgov.org/site/mayor_index.asp</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Gavin Newsom brag[ged] proudly on Ronn Owen&rsquo;s radio program last year about how SF was a sanctuary city and they would do NOTHING to support the Federal Government in dealing with illegal immigration&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alipac.us/ftopict-124198.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.alipac.us/ftopict-124198.html</a></p>
<p>Here is a picture of the Bologna family:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.johnandkenshow.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.johnandkenshow.com/</a></p>
<p>BTW:  This was reported by the local yellow rag originally as a case of &#8216;road rage&rsquo; instead of what it was:  the cold-blooded execution of three people, two of whom were a 16-year old boy and his 20-year old brother, by an illegal immigrant criminal with an AK-47.</p>
<p>While we&rsquo;re on the subject of the idiot mayor of San Fransisco, here&rsquo;s an example of his character:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Newsom&rsquo;s admission that he had an affair in 2005 with his campaign manager&rsquo;s wife&hellip;betrayed Alex Tourk, a friend and onetime deputy chief of staff He betrayed a friend and loyal aide&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.creators.com/opinion/debra-saunders/gavin-newsom-boy-mayor.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.creators.com/opinion/debra-saunders/gavin-newsom-boy-mayor.html</a></p>
<p>Frank Kennedy stated on John and Ken&rsquo;s radio show tonight that he would do everything in his power to prevent Newsom from becoming governor of California. I wouldn&rsquo;t count on the MS or local media to Spread the Message, it will have to be through talk radio and the Internet.  The lame LA Times did not pick up this story until listeners of John and Ken&rsquo;s show called and e-mailed in force.</p>
<p>Of course, in California, Whites are expendable, ignored and scorned by the local media and politicians, only good for providing tax moneys to support illegal immigrants, failing schools and social programs.</p>
<p>The message seems to be:  &#8220;Whites get out!  But leave your money.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bon</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m a resident of the San Francisco Bay Area, and I&rsquo;m glad that this story is giving some public attention to the kinds of problems that are being downplayed by liberals who seem so intent on protecting illegal aliens from the law.  This, as well as the recent story of the city of SF sending a group of illegal alien felons down to a youth camp in SoCal, paying for their residency there (from which center they promptly escaped!) all because they wanted to protect these poor &#8220;kids&#8221; from the evil ICE forces. It&rsquo;s insane.  The hypocrisy seems all the more pointed when considering that liberals typically protest corporations who outsource their factories/production units overseas, to take advantage of cheap Third World labor.  These very same liberals don&rsquo;t bat an eye when instead of outsourcing their production outside the country, the corporations leave their factories here, and bring the illegal Third World workers into American factories instead. In both scenarios,the corporate exploitation is the same, the result is the same   &mdash;   Americans are displaced from their jobs   &mdash;   but liberals protest the former while inviting the latter.  Liberals, can you please comment on this blatant hypocrisy? </p>

			<p>Bon Bon,</p>
<p>I despise Gavin Newsom.  He brings new meaning to the words arrogance and self-adoration.</p>
<p>I am infuriated with the Bologna murders.  But I wonder how many infuriated San Franciscans voted for Tom Tancredo, Duncan Hunter, or Ron Paul in the primaries?  I bet very few.  Forget the Board of Supervisors, how many of these citizens are just as guilty?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gotta hit home to spark change.<br>

			<p>After the Supreme Court re-affirmed the Second Amendment as an individual right. Mayor &#8221; Grusome Newsom &#8221; made a statement to the effect that the killing of the Bologna family was the kind activity that is promoted by The National Rifle Assocation This man is totally delusional. The right of lawbiding citizens to carry a handgun in SF would have probably prevented this horrible crime. Mayor Newsom needs to be at the very least  Impeached. He is an accessory to murder in my opinion</p>

			<p>Whenever an airheaded liberal fool tells you immigration is &#8220;good&#8221; for America&hellip; remind him about how much CRIME, including rape, murder, car-jackings, muggings and armed robbery, not to mention stabbings and drive-by shootings are done annualy by Hispanic immigrants, legal OR illegal.</p>
<p>I post similar stories quite often, culled from Houston&rsquo;s KHOU.COM<br>
website. We need a solid high wall along the border, patrolled by troops ready to shoot at intruders.</p>
<p> Barak Husein Obama&rsquo;s Berlin speech left me speechless&hellip; Obama telling the Europeans we need to do away with all walls. Open our nations to unlimited immigration, then welcome the third-worlders sharing everything with them, so to speak. I hope and PRAY enough Americans come to their senses and vote AGAINST THE OBAMINATION in November. Obama would be the worst possible president ever, even topping GWP, Lyndon Johnson and Bill Clinton for that dishonor. Obama gave himself away in that speech. Bet on a sure thing. He&rsquo;d do away with the southern border fence right away. And push the North American Union down everyone&rsquo;s throat. In addition to importing ten or twenty million Africans to wreak their crime, filthy personal habits and disgusting lifestyle on Americans&hellip; in addition to being on welfare all their lives.</p>

			<p>As long as the American public continues to elect and re-elect, retards like Newsom, this stuff is never going to stop.  Newsom could care less about these murders.  He&rsquo;s just like every other politician in this country, spouting out what the public wants to hear and then driving around in a bullet proof limo, with gun-toting protection and going to home to hide behind his electrified and gated house.  </p>
<p>He has deliberatedly broken federal laws, bragged about breaking the law on live TV and you can&rsquo;t tell me that the federal government, with all the power it wields over the rest of us, couldn&rsquo;t do something about him.  That dog don&rsquo;t hunt.</p>

			<p>I live in nearby Silicon Valley and I laugh at these liberal policies now coming to bite the homosexuals, hippies and do gooders in Sin Francisco.  As African terrorist Malcolm X called it, this is an example of &#8220;chickens coming home to roost.&#8221;  They wanted their mexican illegals, and now they&rsquo;ve got them.</p>
<p>They also want more black in San Fran.  They can have ALL of them as far as I&rsquo;m concerned.  </p>

			<p>While visiting a girl friend in Santa Cruz, Cali. some years ago she wanted to take me on the new subway in Sin Funcisco which I had not seen before. She knows I carry a gun and she wanted me to leave it, I refused as I have experiences of other subways in other cities. I never have made it into the Sin Funcisco subways, nor do I feel I missed anything. </p>

Uh, yeah, how &#8216;bout you now start pickin&rsquo; up the phone and CALLING! Three people might still be alive now.  Just proves more than ever that:</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m glad these murders have gotten the attention of the nation. It&rsquo;s about time. Sadly, killings and rapes have been going on in sancuary cities for quite some time.</p>

			<p>Having just spent some days at a hotel in downtown San Francisco, I&rsquo;m left with the strong impression that the city is nothing but a large, outdoor mental institution. It&rsquo;s like someone forgot to lock the back gate of the asylum and all the inmates got out. They&rsquo;re swarming all over the streets   &mdash;    psychos, winos, junkies, loonies and whackos   &mdash;   arguing with each other, raving to themselves, begging from strangers, yelling at traffic, and screaming aimlessly at God.</p>
<p>And one further observation:  four out of five of these dysfunctionals seem to be black.  I&rsquo;ve been reading articles that S. Fran. is fretting about losing its black population. (That&rsquo;s a loss?)   Well anyway, a visitor there would never believe it!  They are everywhere, like sand on a beach.</p>

			<p>What we are seeing on Amren is the tip of ice berg of a new national white consciousness. Everywhere its starting to awake.<br>
Incident like this shooting will occur many times in the future. But every one is a building block, not a set back.</p>

			<p>Yes, San Francisco is outraged? However, what did they expect? When you give sanctuary to illegal migrants, you can expect to attract a lot of criminals. I see some of these liberal SF types get &#8220;unliberal&#8221; real fast when crime from illegals hits their front door.</p>
