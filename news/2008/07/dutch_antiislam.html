						<p>Dutch legislator Geert Wilders will not be prosecuted for inciting hatred of Muslims with his film denouncing the Quran, prosecutor said Monday.</p>
<p>Prosecutor said his film &#8220;Fitna,&#8221; or &#8220;Ordeal&#8221; in Arabic, and statements Wilders wrote in Dutch newspapers were hurtful and insulting but not criminal.</p>
<p>The film juxtaposed Quranic verses against a background of violent film clips and images of terrorism by Islamic radicals. It aroused protests around the Muslim world after it was released on the Internet in March.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve had enough of Islam in the Netherlands; let not one more Muslim immigrate,&#8221; [Wilders] wrote in the paper. &#8220;I&rsquo;ve had enough of the Quran in the Netherlands: Forbid that fascist book.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prosecution spokeswoman Hanneke Festen said Wilders&rsquo; statements were allowable under Dutch law, which forbids inciting hatred against groups on the basis of their race or creed but also grants leeway to freedom of speech.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mohamed Rabbae, chairman of the moderate National Moroccan Council, said the Dutch group will go to court to ask a judge to order a prosecution of Wilders anyway.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wilders said he hopes prosecutors will send a copy of their decision to prosecutors in Jordan, where he faces a lawsuit. Wilders has said he is worried he could be arrested if he leaves the Netherlands because Jordan has informed Interpol he is wanted to face charges there.</p>

			<p>Fitna should be part of regular curriculum in Western schools.  It is a brave exploration of Islam&rsquo;s own doctrine&rsquo;s detailing of the intractable hostility that islam bears for the West.</p>

			<p>Update: The coward, slick Dutch Christian Democrat Foreign Affair minister Maxime Verhagen refuses to address the Jordanian government for this act of legal jihad.</p>
<p>Background: in the past the &#8216;moderate&rsquo; islam leader Mohammed Rabbae has tried to censure eaerlier theatre plays and films which &#8216;insult the prophet Mohammed&rsquo;. So much for moderate Muslims and their stealth jihad.<br>

<p>The West has decided that George Orwell was not writing tales of caution but instead blueprints for a better society. <br>

			<p>&#8220;Wilders has said he is worried he could be arrested if he leaves the Netherlands because Jordan has informed Interpol he is wanted to face charges there.&#8221;<br>
  &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;  <br>
And by extension, that possibility means that ANYONE, including anyone posting a comment here on Amren or elsewhere, would be in theory extraditable to Jordan or some such place for alleged offenses against Islam or the Sharia laws. </p>
<p>This very new notion which has been introduced in the legal world that anyone can be extradited and tried for what are considered crimes somewhere must be confronted and defeated or we will all be prosecutable for some offense somewhere.<br>

			<p>I say the Dutch government is going to crumble and hand Mr. Wilders over to the Muslims for a FAIR trial. When he is promptly tried, convicted and executed, the Dutch and the U.S.the U.K. and all of the other western nations will protest in the &#8220;strongest terms&#8221;. What good will that do Mr. Wilders?? I really believe this is a possibility. I watched the clips on youtube and he is correct on EVERY point of criticism of the Muslim world and faith.</p>
