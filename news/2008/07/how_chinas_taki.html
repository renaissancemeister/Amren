<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>On June 5, 1873, in a letter to The Times, Sir Francis Galton, the cousin of Charles Darwin and a distinguished African explorer in his own right, outlined a daring (if by today&rsquo;s standards utterly offensive) new method to &lsquo;tame&rsquo; and colonise what was then known as the Dark Continent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My proposal is to make the encouragement of Chinese settlements of Africa a part of our national policy, in the belief that the Chinese immigrants would not only maintain their position, but that they would multiply and their descendants supplant the inferior Negro race,&rsquo; wrote Galton.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should expect that the African seaboard, now sparsely occupied by lazy, palavering savages, might in a few years be tenanted by industrious, order-loving Chinese, living either as a semidetached dependency of China, or else in perfect freedom under their own law.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Despite an outcry in Parliament and heated debate in the august salons of the Royal Geographic Society, Galton insisted that &lsquo;the history of the world tells the tale of the continual displacement of populations, each by a worthier successor, and humanity gains thereby&rsquo;.</p>
<p>A controversial figure, Galton was also the pioneer of eugenics, the theory that was used by Hitler to try to fulfil his mad dreams of a German Master Race.</p>
<p>Eventually, Galton&rsquo;s grand resettlement plans fizzled out because there were much more exciting things going on in Africa.</p>
<p>But that was more than 100 years ago, and with legendary explorers such as Livingstone, Speke and Burton still battling to find the source of the Nile &mdash; and new discoveries of exotic species of birds and animals featuring regularly on newspaper front pages &mdash; vast swathes of the continent had not even been &lsquo;discovered&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Yet Sir Francis Galton, it now appears, was ahead of his time. His vision is coming true &mdash; if not in the way he imagined. An astonishing invasion of Africa is now under way.</p>
<p>In the greatest movement of people the world has ever seen, China is secretly working to turn the entire continent into a new colony.</p>
<p>Reminiscent of the West&rsquo;s imperial push in the 18th and 19th centuries &mdash; but on a much more dramatic, determined scale &mdash; China&rsquo;s rulers believe Africa can become a &lsquo;satellite&rsquo; state, solving its own problems of over-population and shortage of natural resources at a stroke.</p>
<p>With little fanfare, a staggering 750,000 Chinese have settled in Africa over the past decade. More are on the way.</p>
<p>The strategy has been carefully devised by officials in Beijing, where one expert has estimated that China will eventually need to send 300 million people to Africa to solve the problems of over-population and pollution.</p>
<p>The plans appear on track. Across Africa, the red flag of China is flying. Lucrative deals are being struck to buy its commodities &mdash; oil, platinum, gold and minerals. New embassies and air routes are opening up. The continent&rsquo;s new Chinese elite can be seen everywhere, shopping at their own expensive boutiques, driving Mercedes and BMW limousines, sending their children to exclusive private schools.</p>
<p>The pot-holed roads are cluttered with Chinese buses, taking people to markets filled with cheap Chinese goods. More than a thousand miles of new Chinese railroads are crisscrossing the continent, carrying billions of tons of illegally-logged timber, diamonds and gold.</p>
<p>The trains are linked to ports dotted around the coast, waiting to carry the goods back to Beijing after unloading cargoes of cheap toys made in China.</p>
<p>Confucius Institutes (state-funded Chinese &lsquo;cultural centres&rsquo;) have sprung up throughout Africa, as far afield as the tiny land-locked countries of Burundi and Rwanda, teaching baffled local people how to do business in Mandarin and Cantonese.</p>
<p>Massive dams are being built, flooding nature reserves. The land is scarred with giant Chinese mines, with &lsquo;slave&rsquo; labourers paid less than £1 a day to extract ore and minerals.</p>
<p>Pristine forests are being destroyed, with China taking up to 70 per cent of all timber from Africa.</p>
<p>All over this great continent, the Chinese presence is swelling into a flood. Angola has its own &lsquo;Chinatown&rsquo;, as do great African cities such as Dar es Salaam and Nairobi.</p>
<p>Exclusive, gated compounds, serving only Chinese food, and where no blacks are allowed, are being built all over the continent. &lsquo;African cloths&rsquo; sold in markets on the continent are now almost always imported, bearing the legend: &lsquo;Made in China&rsquo;.</p>
<p>From Nigeria in the north, to Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and Angola in the west, across Chad and Sudan in the east, and south through Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique, China has seized a vice-like grip on a continent which officials have decided is crucial to the superpower&rsquo;s long-term survival.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Chinese are all over the place,&rsquo; says Trevor Ncube, a prominent African businessman with publishing interests around the continent. &lsquo;If the British were our masters yesterday, the Chinese have taken their place.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Likened to one race deciding to adopt a new home on another planet, Beijing has launched its so-called &lsquo;One China In Africa&rsquo; policy because of crippling pressure on its own natural resources in a country where the population has almost trebled from 500 million to 1.3 billion in 50 years.</p>
<p>China is hungry &mdash; for land, food and energy. While accounting for a fifth of the world&rsquo;s population, its oil consumption has risen 35-fold in the past decade and Africa is now providing a third of it; imports of steel, copper and aluminium have also shot up, with Beijing devouring 80 per cent of world supplies.</p>
<p>Fuelling its own boom at home, China is also desperate for new markets to sell goods. And Africa, with non-existent health and safety rules to protect against shoddy and dangerous goods, is the perfect destination.</p>
<p>The result of China&rsquo;s demand for raw materials and its sales of products to Africa is that turnover in trade between Africa and China has risen from £5million annually a decade ago to £6billion today.</p>
<p>However, there is a lethal price to pay. There is a sinister aspect to this invasion. Chinese-made war planes roar through the African sky, bombing opponents. Chinese-made assault rifles and grenades are being used to fuel countless murderous civil wars, often over the materials the Chinese are desperate to buy.</p>
<p>Take, for example, Zimbabwe. Recently, a giant container ship from China was due to deliver its cargo of three million rounds of AK-47 ammunition, 3,000 rocket-propelled grenades and 1,500 mortars to President Robert Mugabe&rsquo;s regime.</p>
<p>After an international outcry, the vessel, the An Yue Jiang, was forced to return to China, despite Beijing&rsquo;s insistence that the arms consignment was a &lsquo;normal commercial deal&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Indeed, the 77-ton arms shipment would have been small beer &mdash; a fraction of China&rsquo;s help to Mugabe. He already has high-tech, Chinese-built helicopter gunships and fighter jets to use against his people.</p>
<p>Ever since the U.S. and Britain imposed sanctions in 2003, Mugabe has courted the Chinese, offering mining concessions for arms and currency.</p>
<p>While flying regularly to Beijing as a high-ranking guest, the 84-year-old dictator rants at &lsquo;small dots&rsquo; such as Britain and America.</p>
<p>He can afford to. Mugabe is orchestrating his campaign of terror from a 25-bedroom, pagoda-style mansion built by the Chinese. Much of his estimated £1billion fortune is believed to have been siphoned off from Chinese &lsquo;loans&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The imposing grey building of ZANU-PF, his ruling party, was paid for and built by the Chinese. Mugabe received £200 million last year alone from China, enabling him to buy loyalty from the army.</p>
<p>In another disturbing illustration of the warm relations between China and the ageing dictator, a platoon of the China People&rsquo;s Liberation Army has been out on the streets of Mutare, a city near the border with Mozambique, which voted against the president in the recent, disputed election.</p>
<p>Almost 30 years ago, Britain pulled out of Zimbabwe &mdash; as it had done already out of the rest of Africa, in the wake of Harold Macmillan&rsquo;s &lsquo;wind of change&rsquo; speech. Today, Mugabe says: &lsquo;We have turned East, where the sun rises, and given our backs to the West, where the sun sets.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Despite Britain&rsquo;s commendable colonial legacy of a network of roads, railways and schools, the British are now being shunned.</p>
<p>According to one veteran diplomat: &lsquo;China is easier to do business with because it doesn&rsquo;t care about human rights in Africa &mdash; just as it doesn&rsquo;t care about them in its own country. All the Chinese care about is money.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nowhere is that more true than Sudan. Branded &lsquo;Africa&rsquo;s Killing Fields&rsquo;, the massive oil-rich East African state is in the throes of the genocide and slaughter of hundreds of thousands of black, non-Arab peasants in southern Sudan.</p>
<p>In effect, through its supplies of arms and support, China has been accused of underwriting a humanitarian scandal. The atrocities in Sudan have been described by the U.S. as &lsquo;the worst human rights crisis in the world today&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The government in Khartoum has helped the feared Janjaweed militia to rape, murder and burn to death more than 350,000 people.</p>
<p>The Chinese &mdash; who now buy half of all Sudan&rsquo;s oil &mdash; have happily provided armoured vehicles, aircraft and millions of bullets and grenades in return for lucrative deals. Indeed, an estimated £1billion of Chinese cash has been spent on weapons.</p>
<p>According to Human Rights First, a leading human rights advocacy organisation, Chinese-made AK-47 assault rifles, grenade launchers and ammunition for rifles and heavy machine guns are continuing to flow into Darfur, which is dotted with giant refugee camps, each containing hundreds of thousands of people.</p>
<p>Between 2003 and 2006, China sold Sudan $55 million worth of small arms, flouting a United Nations weapons embargo.</p>
<p>With new warnings that the cycle of killing is intensifying, an estimated two thirds of the non-Arab population has lost at least one member of their families in Darfur.</p>
<p>Although two million people have been uprooted from their homes in the conflict, China has repeatedly thwarted United Nations denunciations of the Sudanese regime.</p>
<p>While the Sudanese slaughter has attracted worldwide condemnation, prompting Hollywood film-maker Steven Spielberg to quit as artistic director of the Beijing Olympics, few parts of Africa are now untouched by China.</p>
<p>In Congo, more than £2billion has been &lsquo;loaned&rsquo; to the government. In Angola, £3 billion has been paid in exchange for oil. In Nigeria, more than £5billion has been handed over.</p>
<p>In Equatorial Guinea, where the president publicly hung his predecessor from a cage suspended in a theatre before having him shot, Chinese firms are helping the dictator build an entirely new capital, full of gleaming skyscrapers and, of course, Chinese restaurants.</p>
<p>After battling for years against the white colonial powers of Britain, France, Belgium and Germany, post-independence African leaders are happy to do business with China for a straightforward reason: cash.</p>
<p>With western loans linked to an insistence on democratic reforms and the need for &lsquo;transparency&rsquo; in using the money (diplomatic language for rules to ensure dictators do not pocket millions), the Chinese have proved much more relaxed about what their billions are used for.</p>
<p>Certainly, little of it reaches the continent&rsquo;s impoverished 800 million people. Much of it goes straight into the pockets of dictators. In Africa, corruption is a multi-billion pound industry and many experts believe that China is fuelling the cancer.</p>
<p>The Chinese are contemptuous of such criticism. To them, Africa is about pragmatism, not human rights. &lsquo;Business is business,&rsquo; says Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Zhou Wenzhong, adding that Beijing should not interfere in &lsquo;internal&rsquo; affairs. &lsquo;We try to separate politics from business.&rsquo;</p>
<p>While the bounty has, not surprisingly, been welcomed by African dictators, the people of Africa are less impressed. At a market in Zimbabwe recently, where Chinese goods were on sale at nearly every stall, one woman told me she would not waste her money on &lsquo;Zing-Zong&rsquo; products.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They go Zing when they work, and then they quickly go Zong and break,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;They are a waste of money. But there&rsquo;s nothing else. China is the only country that will do business with us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There have also been riots in Zambia, Angola and Congo over the flood of Chinese immigrant workers. The Chinese do not use African labour where possible, saying black Africans are lazy and unskilled.</p>
<p>In Angola, the government has agreed that 70 per cent of tendered public works must go to Chinese firms, most of which do not employ Angolans.</p>
<p>As well as enticing hundreds of thousands to settle in Africa, they have even shipped Chinese prisoners to produce the goods cheaply.</p>
<p>In Kenya, for example, only ten textile factories are still producing, compared with 200 factories five years ago, as China undercuts locals in the production of &lsquo;African&rsquo; souvenirs.</p>
<p>Where will it all end? As far as Beijing is concerned, it will stop only when Africa no longer has any minerals or oil to be extracted from the continent.</p>
<p>A century after Sir Francis Galton outlined his vision for Africa, the Chinese are here to stay. More will come.</p>
<p>The people of this bewitching, beautiful continent, where humankind first emerged from the Great Rift Valley, desperately need progress. The Chinese are not here for that.</p>
<p>They are here for plunder. After centuries of pain and war, Africa deserves better.<br>

			<p>Note that even though the Chinese come to Africa in huge numbers, they live segregated from the African communities. I think both the Africans and the Chinese know that only segregation ensures absence of conflicts, and they laugh about the idea of diversity that is promoted in the west (and which is obviously not working in Africa).<br>
Now the Chinese only need to come in ever bigger masses and to breed excessively to increase their population and their power in Africa - and the continent will be their in a century.</p>

			<p>A bit off topic but slightly on topic. I get the impression that when British people moved to Africa and lived on African land that had a profound effect on those peoples psychology in terms of living on areas of land that were vastly unpopulated and in terms of being exposed to all sorts of natural wonders. I wonder what sort of psychological impact living in Africa is having on those Chinese expatriates and I wonder if any of them are having a sense of appreciation for wildlife. </p>

			<p>Well well, it seems the stupid little &#8220;black majority rule&#8221; experiment, forced on Rhodesia in 1980 by the US and the UK, and in 1994 on South Africa, hasn&rsquo;t been too successful.</p>
<p>I have met with many white ex-pats (though war refugees would be a more appropriate term) from these two countries who honestly believe it was all a conspiracy by multi-national mining corporations to take over their huge mineral deposits of precious metals and diamonds. I&rsquo;m skeptical myself. It&rsquo;s a tough call but I&rsquo;m inclined to think it was the communist/socialist influence in the State Department and Congress-with the help of the liberal press of course- that destroyed white governed Africa simply because white nation destruction is what they do for fun.</p>
<p>The way I see it, why would even the greediest, dirtiest corporation trade modern efficiency, under white government, for the predictable inefficiency and corruption of black majority rule? South African and ex-Rhodesian mines are no where close to the productivity levels that profited these multi-national companies under white governments. Zimbawe&rsquo;s mining industry is practically shut down.</p>
<p>Whatever the truth of who was really behind the forced transition of black rule, it appears they didn&rsquo;t write the Red Chinese into the script. America is napping while China takes over the most mineral rich continent on earth. Condi Rice is either evil, incompetent, or a damn fool..maybe it&rsquo;s all three. </p>

			<p>The &#8220;West&#8221; isn&rsquo;t worried about anything but allowing the continuing plunder of it&rsquo;s industries by &#8220;Equity Managers&#8221;, once called Corporate Raiders, Junk Bond Kings, etc. so that the freedom Capitalism brings can thrive. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised that there are hundreds, thousands maybe,of Chinese spies right inside the U.S. We should ask Bill Clinton, he might know.  </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m having a few cognitive dissonance issues here with the Chinese. If they are so smart (and civilized, with temperate sex habits), why is their own country so overpopulated? And how does one explain their apparent dismal attitudes towards environmental stewardship?  </p>

			<p>Africans aren&rsquo;t very smart as a group but they know enough to recognize colonization when they see it and they have a healthy xenophobia.  Sooner or later there will be violent pogroms against those Chinese settlers.  Partly because of resentment over settling in Africa and partly because of jealousy stemming from the inevitable income gap between native Africans and the Chinese.  If Chinese do replace blacks in much of Africa, many benefits will come to pass - not least among the remaining blacks.  Their standard of living (though far below that of the Chinese) will rise substantially.  What bugs me is that the Chinese care nothing for preserving wildlife and its habitat.</p>

			<p><i>The Chinese do not use African labour where possible, saying black Africans are lazy and unskilled.<br>
</i><p>When I lived in East Asia, I found it refreshing that people there generally judged blacks by their actual behavior and aptitude, not out of some vague, sloppily utopian egalitarian sentiment or out of cheap sympathy for their alleged &#8220;suffering and oppression&#8221; due to race.  <p>The average Chinese is a true race realist, and black Africans will find that he is not beset or restrained by &#8220;white guilt.&#8221;  <i>Tant pis pour les noirs.</i>  So much worse for the blacks.</p></p></p>

			<p>&#8220;Across Africa, the red flag of China is flying. Lucrative deals are being struck to buy its commodities &mdash; oil, platinum, gold and minerals. New embassies and air routes are opening up. The continent&rsquo;s new Chinese elite can be seen everywhere, shopping at their own expensive boutiques, driving Mercedes and BMW limousines, sending their children to exclusive private schools.&#8221;</p>
<p>And just WHOM is providing the Chinese with the capital to do this?  Ahh yes, we Americans are.  Back in the 1980&rsquo;s many &#8220;Conservatives&#8221; here in the States started buying into and accepting the whole notion of the Multi-National Corporation&hellip;allowing it to circumvent and ultimately supplant our national sovereignty. These were the &#8220;free traders&#8221; (see John McCain) that allowed the collapse of our manufacturing base, ultimately transferring all of it to China&hellip;along with our wealth&hellip;for nothing in return except massive trade deficits and a national debt that we will never dig ourselves out of.</p>
<p>If (or when?) we ever have a war with China, you can expect these Multi-National Corporations to side with China. Cisco Systems and 3Com are set to become China-based companies. Cisco Systems is the backbone of our entire Internet/network infrastructure.  Does anyone see a problem with that?  We&rsquo;ve become a lazy, stupid, suicidal nation sedated by &#8220;bread and circuses&#8221;&hellip;a people that can no longer think ourselves out of a box, nor even want to try.  We are no better off than the Africans are.  China owns our debt and can call it in at any time.  So, just like they own Africa, they own us too.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m not so certain I agree that the west should be worried about this.  It&rsquo;s the africans that should be worried.  I get the distinct impression that the chinese intend to wipe them out.  Considering how toxic and evil blacks are, I have a tough time seeing that as a negative.</p>
<p>The problems with the chinese aren&rsquo;t genetic like they are with blacks.  Their problem is communism.  And that particular sickness is showing real signs of falling apart.</p>
<p>Whites had their chance in africa.  We were unwilling to do what should have been done&hellip;.which was to get rid of the blacks and create white ethnostates on that continent.  Instead, we enslaved the blacks there and then lost the stomach for it.  All of africa&rsquo;s problems stem from that loss of desire to dominate blacks.  Now, it&rsquo;s china&rsquo;s turn.  If they are foolish enough to do what whites did, it will simply turn out the same way (only it will be THEIR problem now&hellip;.suckers, hehehe).  The western world should concern itself with disengagement from africa.  No more aid.  Hell, no more contact with them at all.</p>
<p>The best thing that could happen would be for africa to become a successful homogenous chinese ethnostate with a democratic government.</p>

			<p>Trust me, the Chinese may be as ruthless as they want in controlling that continent but Africa is a poisoned chalice. In the 1950&rsquo;s British military forces were iron fisted in trying to crush the mau-mau in Kenya but to no avail. Africans (at least the ones I&rsquo;ve met) are very racially consious and I just can&rsquo;t see them allowing China to off load their surplus population on them ( the Europeans tried that and failed).    </p>

			<p>We should use the rescue of the remnant White populations in Africa as an excuse and steal all the territory we can.  This is a straightforward competition for resources that will be won by the ruthless.  We can get the jump on the Chinese by ignoring the pretense of doing business with the Blacks.  We&rsquo;ve still got the most powerful, effective military in the world.  We could even honor the present contracts that the Chinese with the current rulers, just so they don&rsquo;t have any pretext to fight.  We could generously send all the Chinese &#8220;refugees&#8221; home.   We should round up several million liberals immediately and put them to work building infrastructure in the most habitable parts of East Africa.  Any White who supports affirmative action deserves to slave away their life reclaiming the Dark Continent for the White race.   (While we&rsquo;re at it, we can ship all the criminal Blacks we have to the Congo.)  Pay the Black mothers to get their tubes tied.  Africa will not belong to the Africans in fifty years, it may as well belong to us.  Perhaps after the Obama Riots of November 2008, the U.S. will find its way to a new, self-respecting destiny.  There are 200 million Whites in this country, maybe half of whom are fit to be citizens of a republic.  We can spare ten million of the fit, and most of the others, to build civilization, for ourselves and our posterity.  In 1960, JFK challenged the nation to reach for space, and we spent the money and invested the creativity to do it.  Africa is a lot closer than the moon, and a lot more valuable.  </p>

			<p>Sounds like progress to me. The current European solution to Africa isn&rsquo;t working, most of the problems are getting worse. Our desire to throw food at the African continent to make ourselves feel better has seen populations swell but very little infrastructure created to support this growing population which in turn creates more hungry people which need food thrown their way in the future. A deadly cycle until it ends up in civil war or worse.</p>
<p>The Chinese may have less ethics but the African populations will benefit from this more so in the long-term than by the current system.</p>

			<p>Many people are surprised to learn that the Chinese willingly engaged in black African slavery from about AD 700 to about AD 1300. This is not well known, but the essence of it is that the Arab slave-takers would send huge caravans throughout East Africa to capture and enslave black Africans. Some of these newly enslaved persons would be retailed to wealthy Chinese as slaves. Yes, the Chinese have at least six centuries of experience with black Africans. It&rsquo;s not really secret, but there is no public discourse about it. Here&rsquo;s some information.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sino-platonic.org/abstracts/spp122_chinese_africans.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.sino-platonic.org/abstracts/spp122_chinese_africans.html</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Beginning in the Tang dynasty, Arab traders brought a number of East African slaves to China. Although historians have studied the African slave trade extensively, particularly the export of West African slaves to the Americas after 1500, a much smaller body of research focuses on the premodern East African slave trade, and fewer sources still mention black slaves in China. From the eighth to the fourteenth centuries; the Arabs controlled this vast slave trade, which stretched not only along the entire coast of East Africa and throughout the Arab world but as far east as China. Black slaves were just one of many commodities in the Arabs&rsquo; large-scale maritime trade with China, which peaked during the Tang and Song dynasty (960-1275). The&hellip; Arabs sent delegates to the Chinese court in (AD) 651, marking the first recorded official contact between the Chinese government and the Arab caliphate. By the ninth century&hellip; the local residents could have seen African slaves on trading ships and in Arab homes. Some wealthy Chinese people even owned African slaves&hellip;.&#8221;</p>

			<p>  Can you believe it? There is obviously no such thing as &#8220;Yellow Guilt.&#8221; The audacity of these Chinese: They are going to make huge amounts of money, come hell or high water, and they don&rsquo;t give a tinker&rsquo;s damn about whether the world thinks they&rsquo;re racists, or whether they&rsquo;re brutalizing the Africans, or acting discriminatory, or anything else.</p>
<p>  Maybe it&rsquo;s just that when there are 1.3 billion of you you&rsquo;re like the 800-pound gorilla who sits wherever he wants; and maybe it&rsquo;s also that the Chinese have never learned how to be paralyzed by indecision, guilt and self-hatred, like too many of us have.</p>

			<p>Just to set the record straight, human beings evolved from primates in Central Asia.  The six colored races suddenly appeared from the original humans about 500,000 years ago in the highlands of India.  From there, the blacks migrated into Africa and ever since have regressed while living in the tropics which is a lesser stimulating enviroment.  Needless to say they were of the secondary color of the rainbow therefore endowed with lesser genetic capabilities which explains their inability to compete against the white and yellow races.</p>
<p>About 500,000 thousand years, there were about half a billion humans on this planet.  There were no so called white race yet.  The white race is primarily a mixture of the blue man and descendents of Andites which is a mixture of Adam and Eve descendents and Nodites, descendents of superhumans which were part of the Planetary Prince staff.</p>

			<p>&#8220;With little fanfare, a staggering 750,000 Chinese have settled in Africa over the past decade. More are on the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>from the article</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to rewrite the sentence if I may.</p>
<p>&#8220;With little fanfare, a staggering 10,000,000 Mexicans have settled in the California over the past decade.  More on the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ok, I could put &#8220;in the USA&#8221;, but it wouldn&rsquo;t have the comical touch. Not that this situation is any laughing matter.  But it is so distressing that we need to lighten up now and again just to keep our wits about us.</p>
<p>Plus, my little joke was just to illustrate how utterly absurd the MSM is in expecting us to take an interest in ANYTHING it is cares about.  750,000 Chinese in Africa. </p>
<p>SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT!?!?!?!?!?!?</p>
<p>The MSM tells us to be concerned, as if we&rsquo;re still listening.<br>
But it has NOTHING to say about Whites being slaughtered in that same part of the world.  But it can&rsquo;t make the connection that we are not listening anymore exactly because it does stuff like this. So it just keeps on talking to us as if there was NO Internet.  Because it is the MSM, that obnoxious mouthpiece of the Liberal, Left, Neocon Levithan that is, like the Monster it speaks for -<br>

			<p>&#8220;There have also been riots in Zambia, Angola and Congo over the flood of Chinese immigrant workers. The Chinese do not use African labour where possible, saying black Africans are lazy and unskilled.&#8221;</p>
<p>They also say blacks are stupid, and have maintained that all along.  And in addition to thinking that, plus regarding blacks as lazy and unskilled, the Chinese know that blacks are trouble-makers getting involved in crime and violence.  That&rsquo;s why they sent around an edict demanding that they not be served during the olympics.</p>
<p>Japanese minister Nakesone some time ago announced that America will never prosper in the world of tomorrow, because it has too many blacks holding it back.</p>
<p>Well, it looks like China and Japan, the two most homogeneous nations in the world, know much better than the gullible Western white airheads who are welcoming trouble and poverty with open arms.  I doubt that neither nation would be so foolish as to do the same inane thing.</p>
<p>And so far as China&rsquo;s completely colonizing Africa is concerned, I say &#8220;yes&#8221; it will happen, it is happening, and the blacks will slowly be replaced and/or eliminated one way or another.  That has been my view for years now.</p>
<p>With dwindling food to eat and water to drink, China has no option but to extend its motherland into Africa.  And that&rsquo;s exactly what they are doing right now.</p>
<p>In the middle of the 21st century, China will have numerical superiority and control of large parts of Africa, pushing blacks into ghettos, while the majority of blacks somehow mysteriously disappear.  The West will demand to know what happened, and the Chinese will tell them to shut their faces, and the West will be able to do nothing against a Chinese motherland so large and powerful.  Besides the West will be as a sinking ship, overburdened with third world hordes whose weight has started the process of sinking.</p>
<p>With civil wars, chaos, and constant bickering and jockeying for control, the tumultuous masses in the US will have so weakened the country the only option available to them will be to break up into autonomous nation states or to burn out and die in a Mad Max scenario of roving bands of militias.</p>
<p>And China will be riding high, laughing at the leftist fools who inanely claimed that diversity was their strength.</p>

			<p>Andrew Malone comes across as fawning over Africa, the way he describes those Bantu urban Edens Nairobi and Dar es Salam. He also mentions &#8220;cheap&#8221; Chinese goods ad nauseum. Over and over he describes Africa as a &#8220;beautiful&#8221; continent. Is he sick with mad cow disease or what?</p>
<p>To A. Windaus:</p>
<p>Did you see today&rsquo;s article in &#8220;USA Today&#8221;, where some civil engineer from California uprooted his family to Rwanda, because he wanted to build sidewalks in Kigali, the capital city, with the &#8220;dream&#8221; of actually turning Rwanda into the most prosperous nation in the sub-Sahara?! He&rsquo;s a follower of evangelist Rick Warren, who fancies himself as some kind of messiah to the African people. The acolyte&rsquo;s name is Tom Wheeler. While the Chinese are giving munitions to African regimes, this guy Warren is passing out Bibles. Another delusional American who will find out in a hurry, the joy of multiculturalism.</p>
<p>Andrew Malone should worry more about what Trevor Phillips and the other Caribes are doing to Britain, rather than what the Chinese are doing in Africa. He decries the fact that Chinese convicts are producing cheap goods, forgetting that Australia was settled by convicts sent there courtesy of Britain. He also seems to forget the atrocities the English visited upon the Irish. It&rsquo;s almost like Malone pines for the days when the sun never set on the British Empire.</p>
<p>Hey Andrew Malone, lighten up. Thanks to the Chinese presence, Africa is now a mosaic of multiculturalism, what with Arabs in the North, Bantus in the East, Central, West and South, a sprinkling of Hispanics in the South (holdovers of Fidel Castro&rsquo;s Cuban Afrika Korps) and Chinese everywhere south of the Sahara. Isn&rsquo;t this what you Brits wanted for crissakes? Isn&rsquo;t this why you put Nick Griffin in the can?</p>
<p>So STFU and enjoy it, before you are charged with a hate-crime for speaking ill of the Chinese in Africa.</p>
<p>Once again, we see a race of people come into Africa, and build an infrastructure, while African Bantus sit like kindergarten children awaiting the start of the day&rsquo;s lesson.   </p>

			<p>A controversial figure, Galton was also the pioneer of eugenics, the theory that was used by Hitler to try to fulfil his mad dreams of a German Master Race.<br>
_________________________________________________________________<br>
Ah, the liberal &#8220;caveat,&#8221; the inevitable phrase that is meant to protect it&rsquo;s author from condemnation from the holy priests of PC.<br>
So Hitler&rsquo;s idea of a German Master race was mad, eh? <br>
Why? <br>
We breed dogs and cattle and corn to perform as we like.<br>
Are we mad?<br>
We sometimes select mates based on a sense of how favorable their traits are, ergo the traits of our offspring.<br>
Are we mad?<br>
I am no fan of Hitler-or Mao-or Che, etc. But this ridiculous mantra everybody must repeat-that Hitler was crazy and evil beyond compare for concieving of eugenics&hellip;that is a type of madness in of itself-at least a severe neurosis. Eugenics may be unsettling, but it is not crazy. And anybody who can think can tell you that we could breed any trait in humans we wanted. If we can produce a Daschund, we can produce smart people, big people, people who don&rsquo;t get burned easily in the sun, beautiful people, people who can hold their breath underwter for incredible ammounts of time, etc. How do you think the races emerged? (Oh, I forgot, race does not exist&hellip;)<br>
On second thought, let&rsquo;s call the whole thing off. Intellectualism is DEAD, since thinking is officially a form of heresy.<br>
But who&rsquo;s listening? <br>

			<p>I often go to a website whose topic matter concerns Zimbabwe. On it, numerous Black Americans, Black Europeans, and Black Africans insist that China is going to be the savior, of not just Zimbabwe, but all of Africa. They invariably make snide remarks about evil white colonizers, but are too dim to realize that China is not there on a mercy mission, and that they have no love for Blacks. They delude themselves into believing that because they are helping Mugabe, that this is all about supporting black the black power struggle against white domination. It astounds me how they bury their heads in the sand. With ignorance like this so rampant, China should have little trouble taking over completly.</p>

<p>So VERY true! Bravo, for saying what almost nobody here has ever said, to my recollection. The Chinese, by and large, are not like us at all. They participated in their own slaughter in their terrible revolution. They eat dogs. They are a massive overpopulation bomb. They can be unspeakably cruel by our standards. They are more ruthless than us. <br>
Every race has good people, and the Chinese have admirable traits. But a great white shark has admirable traits-and is even beautiful. But I won&rsquo;t offer a great white shark my hand.<br>
Anybody who trusts  the Chinese to help us, or coexist with us-in some imaginary racial alliance against the brown world- is being silly.</p>

 One more thing, why is it OK to criticise the Chinese but not blacks? Why don&rsquo;t the Chinese in the UK take the author to court for being racist against the Chinese? Why are people so obsessed about the poor innocent Africans supposedly exploited by everybody? Anybody who has stayed in Africa will know it is exactly the opposite. Africans are probably the most exploitive people in the world.</p>

			<p>This really was discussed on NPR RADIO months ago. The Chinese predictably taking advantage of the dull-minded Blacks, building roads, hospitals, schools, etc. with &#8220;loans&#8221; to the various nations. The Blacks mortaging their nation and souls to their Chinese overlords. When it&rsquo;s time to pay the piper, China plunders the nations&rsquo; resources for a fraction of the loot&rsquo;s true value. </p>
<p>Rest assured, their Chinese overlords are not about to let the simple Africans off easily   &mdash;   or cheaply. They&rsquo;ll be damned sure to get their &#8220;low interest&#8221; loans repaid four times over. You can also bet they&rsquo;ll crush any Black armed resistance with as much of China&rsquo;s military force as necessary. China also is quite ruthless in controlling its population size. Rest assured that as China starts &#8220;controlling&#8221; large sections of Africa, the Black population numbers will drop, and drop, and drop! So maybe letting China have a free hand in Africa might not be all that bad of a thing.</p>
<p>As to Mugabwe, we can at least get a good laugh out of this strutting clown and his chest-full of medals. Medals just as meaningless as his delusions of grandeur. Should his demise &#8220;benefit&#8221; his Chinese masters, rest assured, he will be dispatched without fuss when the time comes. The Chinese are cynical and ruthless, as their slave-labor exploitation of the locals shows. Rest assured, it will get WORSE, not better, for the Black Africans. But when you make a pact with the devil&hellip; as the old saying goes&hellip;</p>

Don&rsquo;t worry the British Royal navy will capture them  &mdash;  and grant them asylum in Britain! The Chinese would just harvest their organs and discard their bodies in the garbage.</p>
<p>I am all for a Chinese Hegemony in the region. Let the Chinese who are unparalyzed by guilt bring order to Africa. Maybe if we are really lucky they will implement the one child policy throughout the dark continent. Maybe if we are really really lucky they will have Chinese will establish colonialist governments that will cooperate with nationalist European governments in facilitating the mass repatriation of African invading hordes.

			<p>&#8220;According to one veteran diplomat: &lsquo;China is easier to do business with because it doesn&rsquo;t care about human rights in Africa &mdash; just as it doesn&rsquo;t care about them in its own country. All the Chinese care about is money.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite the asiaphilia rampant on this site, the fact remains that human decency is a white trait.</p>

			<p>This is an interesting and predictable development.  Unfortunately for the Africans, China wants Africa, not Africans.</p>
<p>When the Chinese immigrant population of the African continent becomes large enough, we can expect that the Chinese, who doubtless consider them a net liability, inconvenient, and annoying, will simply banish them to the bush to fend for themselves.</p>
<p>The Chinese will stand by and watch from their well-defended enclaves while the native Africans starve and die from the ravages of disease.</p>
<p>The Chinese are a remarkably unsentimental people and are unmoved by any such notions as &#8220;the white man&rsquo;s burden.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&ldquo;With little fanfare, a staggering 750,000 Chinese have settled in Africa over the past decade. More are on the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Weve had at least 4 times that number here in the uk in the last decade,and this coming from a british newspaper,I think theres something about an old saying involving glass houses and stones that is most apt here.</p>
<p>Or the more likely and in keeping with liberal double standards, mass immigration is only bad if its a non white people being displaced.</p>

<p>That was my 1st thought as well. According to my handy-dandy pocket calculator, 750,000 is about 0.58% of China&rsquo;s population, and that migration took 10 years. </p>
<p>According to the article, the Chinese government envisions 300 million colonists in Africa eventually. At the curent rate, that goal will be reached in 4000 years.</p>

			<p>Hopefully our former poster styling himself as, JOHN LIU, read this story. Mr. Lieu, it might be recalled, took us all to task, lecturing us Whites for &#8220;having plundered&#8221; (his words) China of so much wealth and art. Using the colorful expression &#8220;den of thieves&#8221; as his term for the British Museum.</p>
<p>I and other posters pointed out to him how China has pretty well outdone any purported thievery by Western nations. China is constantly stealing (via espionage) countless Western industrial and defense technology. Is plundering Africa of its wealth and using Africans as little more than slave labor. With China&rsquo;s unspoken but certainly quite possible intention of eventually &#8220;depopulating&#8221; Africa of its Blacks   &mdash;   through instigating endless civil wars, genocide, spreading of diseases, and so on. It should be most interesting to read the responses of Chinese posters to this excellent, hard-hitting and to the point article about China&rsquo;s own colonial ambitions.</p>

			<p>This is one of the FEW times I disagree with Kenelm Digby&hellip; I doubt the Chinese are going to put up with ANYTHING from what the Russians derogatively termed &#8220;black asses.&#8221; China will take from its African &#8220;clients&#8221; whatever minerals, resources it needs and wants. Selling to the world what it can&rsquo;t use in its own industries.</p>
<p>Chinese (nor would this be China phillia by any sense) are far more intelligent (but then collectively, what race isn&rsquo;t) than the Africans. I doubt any counter-argument by any African group would be tolerated or allowed. Give it a half-century and African population will be in a very steep decline. With Chinese overlords the root cause of such decline. With Blacks reduced to near-slavery working for their Chinese Masters under far worse terms and conditions than they ever did for their White European colonial masters. Those &#8220;loans&#8221; and &#8220;gifts&#8221; will ultimately cost in the long run, today&rsquo;s native Africans more dearly than they ever could imagine. Very possibly with very fatal (for Africans) results. Pity I won&rsquo;t be around in 2058 because I would certainly would view with great interest at the African map at that timepoint long with the decline and near disappearance of roughly most of a billon and a half Blacks by then.</p>

			<p>The rule of Africa by the Chinese will be very different from that by the White in that they won&rsquo;t be constantly a minority juggling for power with a Black majority. They will just overbreed the blacks. They will be a majority in the places they choose to expand. The West was killed by guerrilla in Africa. The Chinese are in Africa (or anywhere they settle) to stay, and are masters of guerrilla and counter guerrilla. African attempts at massacres against the Chinese will be countered with effective Chinese massacres against the African.</p>

			<p>This should be good news for the Whites in Africa, who I have been thinking about lately on a daily basis.  For sure, if the Chinese rescue them it will be for practical purposes, not humanitary reasons.</p>
<p>But I am sure the Chinese are aware of how valuable the Whites will be to them.  They are smarter, easier to talk to and the Chinese speak English, not any African dialect.  In fact, at this moment, there are almost as many children from ages 6 to 10 in China learning English as their are Americans.  The number at present is 250 million.  That&rsquo;s 250 million Chinese children learning English.  It&rsquo;s unlikely they are going to waste that on Africans when they are studying English to better learn what we already know, ie; Engineering, Infastructure, Finance, Science, Technology, Housing Development, City Planning, and General Education.  </p>
<p>My guess is that they will have no use for, and so, no patience with, Bono. The Bono Bubble all but Burst by 2005 and he has since been well exposed for the self-serving poser and fraud he is. </p>

The Chinese are smart enough to not allow any black immigration to China. A few diplomats and their families and aids kept in highly segregated enclaves sure, but not wide spread black immigration.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be interesting to see how the Chinese respond to charges of violations of human rights and racism. Will they care? What actions will they take to prevent or put down uprisings? Will they be willing to fire live rounds into crowds of rioting Africans? Will they conquer Africa or come to curse the day they set foot on the continent?</p>

<p>I would say more the latter-that the Chinese aren&rsquo;t full of guilt and self-hatred as most whites are when it comes to racial issues and politics.  Remember, whites controlled blacks and the chinese in their own countries for a long time.  It&rsquo;s more will and pride than sheer numbers.

			<p>The Chinese government has historically had no problem using the harshest measures available to control their own population.  How can anyone imagine that they&rsquo;d have the least bit of trouble shooting inconvenient Blacks?  They would never hold war crimes trials, or even admit that the Blacks had disappeared.  They are as cold-blooded as the Blacks when necessary, and much smarter.  Black soldiers are only useful for massacring unarmed people, and providing realistic targets for real soldiers.  A million Blacks armed with AK-47s would be no match for 50,000 well-trained Chinese infantry.  Africa is toast.  We should make it ours.</p>

			<p>Taking a bit from the study of history, the Mexicans &amp; Chinese had extensive trade and contact when not many would do business with Mexico. Though there are a few enclaves of Chinese there, its only real effect has been to help setup a system of corruption that makes smoothing over &#8216;troubles&rsquo; with force rather run of the mill, and to guarantee you are dealing with the same people day in and day out to trade with.  Business first indeed. A handful of people became very wealthy, and that wealth has stayed in those families for generations to come. Mexico looks like hell for it and still doesn&rsquo;t have basic services most places. </p>
<p>I honestly don&rsquo;t expect much more than that will happen in Africa. Though it would be interesting to see if they can setup a colony or two there and make a go of it. They would probably have to commit a full scale genocide or at least backhandedly fund large scale displacement to make it happen. History shows those conflicts over resources always end with either the destruction of one group in favor or another, or the displacement of the loser. If China has the stomach for it, they could easily accomplish either.  The Chinese may well be doing that effectively by mandating that the work on big projects be done by Chinese. The blacks in Africa are not quite smart enough to realize the benefits &amp; make money catering to them to take their dollars away from them. So there wont be any large scale development that the Chinese don&rsquo;t make themselves. After a period of time, they could start building gates and extending them outward around those developments. De facto segregation; and if the presence of corruption is high enough (and this is Africa after all) they could run things with a very small actual population and keep importing more.  Thats a much easier method than taking over things with force. They have that too if they need it. </p>
<p>I would say that we could learn from that road map of how to claim an area for our own ethnic needs, but as long as federal laws only allow minorities to do that in the US - and we continue to tolerate that - its not possible to do here.  But if we were given a free hand, the same could be done for our cities, largely  just by economic exclusion of others.  In the US, the exact opposite is happening because of the laws in place. Mexican invaders can parasite off of us, and then only do business with Mexican businesses. They wont have the same levels of accomplishments, its not in their genetics, but they can easily setup economic exclusion areas and back that with the force of making it unpleasant for other races to be there.  They are doing this quite successfully already as another stories map of LA by ethnicity shows clearly.  </p>
<p>Its unfortunate, but one of the reasons that we failed to colonize Africa more successfully was pure &amp; simple greed. As soon as settlers made it safe for commerce, in came the gunships on the personal mission of a few wealthy individuals to make sure they got their claim of gold, silver, diamonds..etc  Those settlements were stabbed in the back at nearly every turn. The result being public aid of African countries from the west with sums that vastly exceeded the profits taken out by a few. Wonderful way to externalize costs if you are that few, but it made every adventure into Africa an economic loss, and ultimately, a failure.  Corruption isn&rsquo;t unique to their governments either.  If the goals had honestly been to settle those places for our benefit, we would have done it, but that kind of thing is never the case for long.  You always have to throw off the yoke of those wanting to run it for just a few &amp; bleed it dry.  Those states never got to the point of being able to say throw off the British yoke, or the French yoke, or Dutch yoke - and still keep it as a free settlement for our people. South Africa succeeded for a long time in spite of that, one of the rare exceptions, but in the end, it still came down to the same things.  </p>
<p>If the Chinese are doing it for nationalistic reasons, and can stick to that, they will be incredibly successful. If, like western settlements - its done for the financial interests of a few &amp; those few have the ear of the military - they will doom themselves to failure eventually.  Africa is an incredibly rich continent that could have many pockets of paradise in the right hands. </p>

       Just consider these little tidbits, the South African Afrikaaners - perhaps some of Europe&rsquo;s finest racial specimens have in the long run (3-400 years or so,)been effectively destroyed as an ethny despite their initial truimphs and achievements in South Africa ( a land that was incidentally almost free of blacks at the time of European settlement).<br>
  Likewise in the good ol US of A, blacks (who make up no more than 12% of the population)effectively have the entire American government and political establishment under their thumb, not to mention victimizing Whites massively, whilst Whites dare raise a squeak in reply.</p>

&#8220;Whites had their chance in africa. We were unwilling to do what should have been done&hellip;.which was to get rid of the blacks and create white ethnostates on that continent. Instead, we enslaved the blacks there and then lost the stomach for it. All of africa&rsquo;s problems stem from that loss of desire to dominate blacks. Now, it&rsquo;s china&rsquo;s turn. If they are foolish enough to do what whites did, it will simply turn out the same way (only it will be THEIR problem now). The western world should concern itself with disengagement from africa. No more aid. </p>
<p><br>
The White Man&rsquo;s Burden was a christian act. Sure many Anglos profited, but it was done in the name of Christ.. the chinese are doing it in the name of profit. The Chinese will keep their slaves or otherwise exterminate them when need be. There certainly will not be any Chinese altruism towards Africans. <br>
A slow and malignent death. I think Nietsche if he were alive today would fully agree. </p>
<p>The question is what will the Chinese do with the few millions of whites left in Africa. Turn the women into whores as they do Russian blonde hair blue eyes? Maybe subservient middle management or farmers for the men? </p>

			<p>Would you rather they immigrate to here? Let them get burdened down with affirmative action, quotas, etc when the blacks start to protest and burn down their cities. Maybe the 21st Century won&rsquo;t belong to China after all. They increasingly are taking on more of our ridiculous welfare-esque policies in their own country towards minorities. This could also cause Africans to preferentially immigrate to China (instead of here) over time, and of course Chinese immigrating to Africa aren&rsquo;t coming here. And as one reader pointed out, they will get stuck as being the colonizing masters instead of Europeans. Looks like alot of upside to this for Americans to me.</p>

<p>All they are doing is trading with African leaders. Nothing else. China is never going to turn 12% black because as history has shown (with that cropped Tang-Abbassid paper) they don&rsquo;t want blacks even if they&rsquo;re slaves. </p>
<p>African &#8220;slaves&#8221; in &#8220;China&#8221; were limited to wealthy families in Guangdong who used them as door-holders. This is a much better lifestyle than living in Africa in the 1200s.</p>

			<p>I know a lot of negative things are said about blacks in this forum, but when all&rsquo;s said and done, blacks are the born survivors of the human race, and in the long run will always truimph against any adversity by sheer dint of the will to survive and exist - if you study their actions they are always based on &#8216;what&rsquo;s good for me&rsquo;and blacks have an uncanny yet omnipresent subliminal racial self-interest and awareness in which they (rightly) see any non-black as a hostile competitor and when the opportunity arises they quickly move to destroy the threat.<br>

At Ishawalanda (?) 1200 soldiers held against 20,000, until some of them ran out of ammunition and the Zulus broke through.  Intelligent, disciplined men will always outfight much larger numbers of dull witted enemies.  Given superior technology and an indifference to the death and suffering of their opponents, such warfare more resembles the buffalo hunts staged for rich Easterners in the 1880s than actual battle.  The Chinese would have nothing to fear from the Africans, nothing at all.  Jackals, hyenas, and vultures would grow fat and lazy on the bounty.  </p>

First thing, 8:20 PM, the average African Black has the intellectual capacity of a White 13 year old.  The Blacks are not anywheres near the equals of Vietnamese or Afghans.  <br>
Second, it was not the intent of either the U.S. in Viet Nam or the Russians in Afghanistan to exterminate the locals.  The task of fighting is made much harder if you have to distinguish the harmless natives from the enemies.  That is where the atrocities in Viet Nam came from, an inability or unwillingness to sort out who was VC and who wasn&rsquo;t.  But I believe that the Chinese would gladly kill every soul in Africa to get themselves more living space.<br>
Third, the victories of the North Vietnamese and the Mujahadin were political, not military.  You do not defeat a nation of 200 million by killing 58,000 soldiers, unless that nation makes a political decision that victory isn&rsquo;t worth the cost.  I do not doubt that the Chinese would consider a few tens of thousands of dead to be a fair price for the best agricultural land in Africa.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;Do the Chinese really understand the Kalihari or the Congo rain forest.&#8221;  The Chinese don&rsquo;t need the Kalihari Desert or the Congo Basin rain forest.  It is the savannah, the grasslands of east and south Africa, that can support agriculture, that they need.  That is open country with woods scattered about, which denies the defenders cover for ambush.  Over a century ago, the British were able to defeat the Boers in South Africa by building a system of defendable observation towers, which allowed their forces to hunt down the mounted Dutchmen.  Surely the Chinese could do better with modern technology, aerial reconaissance, and infrared sensors.  The Briitsh also built the first &#8220;concentration camps&#8221; where they put the Boers families when they burned their houses and farms, clearing the land of ALL inhabitants.  Of course, the ex-Reds have experience in creating famines, they ought be able to excel the British in this regard as well.  <br>
     The U.S. did not &#8220;carpet bomb&#8221; North Viet Nam, we destroyed much of their industrial infrastructure.  Their farms remained as before, feeding the people.  Until we mined the port of Haiphong at the end of 1972, they continued to receive weapons and other support from the USSR.  Who will support the Africans?  Who will feed the Africans?  All of their leaders have grown rich off foreign aid and/or bribery.  None of this will change.<br>
     The less desirable parts of Africa will be taken in due course, as the Chinese colonies populations grow.  Didn&rsquo;t we Whites take all of North America from peoples who were fighting for their very survival?</p>

&#8220;When a people are fighting for their very SURVIVAL higher IQ and high tech weaponry still won&rsquo;t crush them!&#8221;</p>
<p>Amen.  A Chinese campaign in Africa (without nuclear weapons, which would draw the ire of America) would make Vietnam and Afghanistan look like the US and Russia&rsquo;s most shinning successes.  If there is one thing Vietnam proved, it is that you don&rsquo;t need to be a genius to run around triple-triple canopy jungles bushwhacking people with an AK-47.  They would be M-16&rsquo;s midway through the conflict, as the US would give the natives all they wanted in payback for Vietnam.  We have a long collective memory.</p>
<p>In addition, why is it that people believe that the Chinese will have the collective stomachs for an aggressive, armed insurgency.  They have not started a war in over 2000 years, and have had there you know what&rsquo;s handed to them by the Europeans and the Japanese. </p>
<p>The typical African militiaman on the other hand is a battle hardened 19 year old who was kidnapped as a child by a band of insurgents and knows nothing more than war.  Additionally, he realized he will be killed before 30 by AIDS, malaria or a bullet so he is fighting all out for glory at all times;  he has no family to return to. </p>
<p>Also, one must take into account the logistical nightmares posed for an inexperienced military to fashion supply lines from China through a large part of Africa.  We had shortages in the tiny nations of Korea and Vietnam, and we&rsquo;d been at war for 25 straight years.  Malaria/yellow fever/titsi fly/water purification pills not arriving in time would wipe out whole battalions of Chinese soldiers.  </p>
<p>Mainly though, one can never underestimate the human survival instinct.  A few thousand annorexic Ethiopian tribesmen with spears were able to humiliate Mussolini for almost a month.  How would the Chinese (who hate their government to begin with) react to the sight of a few countrymen captured and dismembered and hung from trees?</p>

			<p>The Chinese have no stomach for war?  There was war between the KMT and the Reds from 1928 until 1949.  There was war between the Japanese and the Chinese from, I think, 1931 until 1945.  The Chinese fought us in Korea, and made war upon themselves from 1949 until about the mid 70s.  They have all the stomach in the world for war, and are throughly nationalistic too.  <br>
     Are the Chinese without a human survival instinct?  With their vast population, compelled by agricultural necessity to live along the coast and in two river basins, they are faced with water shortages and other environmental threats.  They have established a one-child per couple policy because they face a threat to their survival from overpopulation.  Establishing economic dominance in Africa, as a prelude to eventual seizure of the most productive land, is their best chance for long term survival as a race.  It is also beneficial to the individual Chinese who emigrate, just as German, Swedish, and Slavic farmers left their homes to take over the newly depopulated Indian lands.  As they watch the White race commit suicide, they can see that we won&rsquo;t fight for Africa, we don&rsquo;t even fight for ourselves.  They will have a free hand to exterminate any restless natives.  <br>
     And it won&rsquo;t take much to exterminate the natives.  Didn&rsquo;t that Irishman get in trouble last week with the Irish race commissars for pointing out, among other things, that the population of Ethiopia has doubled since the famines of a couple decades ago, solely because of foreign food shipments?  When the Chinese control the ports, 19 year old Black militiamen won&rsquo;t have any food to steal.  Those who don&rsquo;t starve can be shot, they have no genetic resistance to bullets as they do to the local diseases.  And while the Chinese may have no inherited resistance to those diseases, they are familiar with water and insect borne diseases.  They&rsquo;ll manage, especially when the benefits of conquest are so great.  Sub-Saharan Africa, all to themselves, without any sub-Saharan Africans to trouble with.  If the 19th century Europeans and Americans could conquer continents with miniscule armies, the 21st century Chinese, with millions of disciplined troops, backed by a modern industrial and technological base, and without any humanitarian inhibitions, should have no trouble.  They&rsquo;re just waiting for us to shrivel up.<br>

			<p>But schoolteacher, remember North America was scarsely populated when Europeans arrived and the tribes not hugely aggressive initially (which allowed whites to get their foot in the door). Disease killed most American Indians, however Africans are used to these diseases but the Chinese won&rsquo;t be. I don&rsquo;t have any great love for blacks but I understand their ideology towards outsiders and they just won&rsquo;t allow a chinese population foothold on their continent in the first place. Really it should be the Russians scared of chinese territorial ambitions! </p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;great African cities such as Dar es Salaam and Nairobi.&#8221;</p>
<p>AFRICAN cities ? Read up on your history, Mr. Malone. Nairobi was founded by the British, and built by British and Indians. Dar es Salaam, as you might guess from the name, was founded by Arabs. I suspect this Malone is one of the &#8220;Black&#8221; Irish.</p>

			<p>Briton at 5:14 AM: The Chinese already have a foothold in Africa, and a couple firm hand grasps as well.  750,000 Chinese immigrants into North America is cause for alarm, as many posters have said.  How much more threatening is that number of intelligent foreigners to a continent of primitives?  I don&rsquo;t doubt that they are already funding Black militias to do their bidding for a dollar a day, under nominal African command.  Africa and all its resources are for sale to the highest bidder, from the 18th century slave markets to the minerals used in video games that they&rsquo;re fighting over now.  China is patient, and by the time that President of the United States, Shamika Garcia-Chang, finishes her second term in office, in 2024, we will watch feebly as the last Bantu guerrilla gangs are hunted down.  <br>
     Let&rsquo;s hope the Russians do a better job of defending their territory.</p>

              The hold that European colonists had over sub-Saharan Africa was only very tenuous at best, and in the vast majority of cases lasted no longer than 60 or so years (from 1900 to 1960).<br>
  In fact once the blacks started getting organized and had modern weapons (an their numbers built up), Whites were very soon on the defensive and had to abandon their colonies forthwith - contrary to what is often claimed this wasa done reluctantly in most cases.<br>
 Examples are the Belgian Congo in 1960, the &#8216;mau-mau&rsquo; rebellion in Kenya, the Rhodesian conflict of the 1970s and the abandonment of South Africa in more recet times.</p>
