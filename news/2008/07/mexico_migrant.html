<h1><a href="https://www6.comcast.net/articles/news-world-latinamerica/20080730/Mexico.Remittances/">Mexico Migrant Money Declines 2.2 Percent</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, July 30, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Money sent home by Mexican migrants declined by 2.2 percent in the first six months of 2008, the first sustained drop in more than a decade, Mexico&rsquo;s Central Bank reported Wednesday.</p>
<p>The downturn in U.S. housing construction and stepped-up U.S. immigration raids have made it tougher for migrants to find jobs, and less able to send home money.</p>
<p>Jesus Cervantes, director of economic measurement for the bank, said year-end figures are expected to continue this trend &mdash; the first sustained drop since 1995, when Mexico&rsquo;s central bank began keeping a tally.</p>
<p>Money sent home by Mexican migrants &mdash; also known as remittances &mdash; is the country&rsquo;s second-largest legal source of foreign income, after oil exports. And for years, it contributed to a growing Mexican economy: Annual remittances nearly tripled from about US$9 billion in 2001 to almost US$24 billion in 2007, amid improved reporting methods and an exodus of migrants from Mexico.</p>

			<p>Another explanation is that since so much of Mexico is already here, they don&rsquo;t need to remit as much &#8220;back there,&#8221; since &#8220;back there&#8221; is here.</p>

			<p>Maybe the Calderon government will now have to assume some responsibility for their own people. For far too many years we have been babysitting every criminal he urges to sneak into our country. American ciizens have had enough. We will phone, fax, email and confront the pro-illegals in our government who have aided and abetted Mexico&rsquo;s violent and corrupt government. Here and there we see the light at the end of the tunnel. We will continue to fight until we have our country back and have leaders who care more for our welfare than that of illegal aliens.</p>

			<p> I was at the convienence store the other day, and I saw three illeagel aliens in a 20 year old Chrysler New Yorker. It would not start. It is sad that an American worker who would be paid 20 dollars an hour and would be driving a new Chrysler 300C is denied a job because of three 7 dollar an hour people like them. If we can  reign in and penalize buisnessmen who have gone way too far in the pursuit of profit, we can turn our whole country around. I support capitalism, but government must be a balancing force to ensure fairness for worker and owner. I ask anyone on this board to infiltrate government positions and destroy the marxist/liberal establishmemt. I know we can do it. We made America. </p>

			<p>Guess we&rsquo;ll have to make up the difference. I&rsquo;m sure the White House is scrambling around to see which US program it can tap to do this. Maybe we can take it from the fund for improving our unsafe bridges, or maybe take some from the FDA - it&rsquo;s not watching our food supply anyway. Or maybe we can remove a few more programs in our schools, like English courses. Lets don&rsquo;t let Mexico down. After all, they depend on us.</p>

			<p>I own stock in Western Union.  Anyone think I should sell it now? </p>

			<p>Anonymous who owns stock in Western Union:</p>
<p>WU just closed their American operations in St. Louis and Dallas, (as of August 1) and has outsourced most of it to Costa Rica.  The new employees in Costa will average a wage of $18 a day.  What&rsquo;s worse is that their union, the Communications Workers of America (CWA), didn&rsquo;t make a peep about it in their union newspaper.  However, that paper can talk up racial diversity with every issue.</p>

<p>Union officials were probably bought   &mdash;   if not with money, with promises of &#8216;amnesty&rsquo; by the feds for past criminal misdeeds&hellip; as long as they just spout the good talk (diversity) and keep mum about rank and file jobs being outsourced. I lost faith in labor unions decades ago. If any unions still have guts and fire, I haven&rsquo;t seen signs of it in recent years.</p>
<p>Even the Teamsters can&rsquo;t seem to keep the unsafe Mexican rigs off our roads. Never mind that they&rsquo;re also actively stealing jobs from the Teamster rank and file. As also are Indian and Pakistani truckers (non-union SCAB labor). Makes you wonder if ANY union leader has any starch left in his spine. Our corporations, actively aided and abetted by our OWN GOVERNMENT, are going all out to destroy our American middle-class. Through outsourcing to other countries. Through in-sourcing (GIVING Americans&rsquo; jobs to legal and illegal immigrants). Unless enough people wake up and DO WHATEVER NECESSARY, we can only hope that silly Mayan prophecy of the world ending in 2012 will come true. Because for what were once proud, courageous American Whites, the world won&rsquo;t be worth living in. We&rsquo;ll be competing with the foreign trash at the lowest wages the corporations want to offer.</p>
