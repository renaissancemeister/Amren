<p>Now Escondido is trying a new approach to what it calls the &#8220;public nuisances&#8221; of illegal immigration, citing residents for code violations such as garage conversions, graffiti and junk cars.</p>
<p>The city is also debating a new ordinance that would restrict overnight street parking without a permit. In addition, it is drafting a policy that would prohibit drivers from picking up day laborers along some streets.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Like many city leaders frustrated with the federal government, Escondido officials said they were taking immigration enforcement into their own hands. They said they were fighting the perception that Escondido, a city in affluent northern San Diego County with a burgeoning Latino population, has become a destination for illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>Councilman Ed Gallo said he regularly receives complaints from Escondido residents about illegal immigrants crowding schools, hospitals and neighborhoods.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police Chief Jim Maher said his department conducted two &#8220;criminal alien&#8221; sweeps this year. Officers identified illegal immigrants with criminal records who had been deported but then returned. In two separate sweeps, Escondido police arrested 31 illegal immigrants and turned them over to federal authorities for possible deportation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Lauren Mack said the police department sweeps were a &#8220;unique enforcement approach&#8221; because the officers acted largely on their own.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The police department&rsquo;s most controversial move, however, was establishing checkpoints to find unlicensed drivers. Last year, the department set up 18 license checkpoints, resulting in 293 impounded cars, 14 arrests and 296 citations. Maher said those checkpoints helped officers find at least 290 unlicensed drivers and helped reduce the city&rsquo;s number of hit-and-run crashes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some folks say they are controversial because they target a specific segment of the population,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That is absolutely not true. Our checkpoints are for one reason and one reason only: traffic safety.&#8221;</p>
<p>Escondido officers ask about immigration status only if the drivers do not have licenses. Illegal immigrants are not eligible to obtain driver&rsquo;s licenses in California. In the last six months of 2007, officers identified six illegal immigrants and referred them to federal authorities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The following sentence appeared in the original version, but was removed before the resolution passed: &#8220;Illegal immigration leads to higher crime rates, contributes to overcrowded classrooms and failing schools, subjects our hospitals to fiscal hardship and legal residents to substandard quality of care, and destroys our neighborhoods and diminishes our overall quality of life.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The city&rsquo;s policies have also attracted criticism from some residents who said the city is blurring distinctions between illegal immigrants and Latinos here legally.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not about immigration,&#8221; said resident Bill Flores, spokesman for a community organization called El Grupo. &#8220;It is about brown people.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They are looking for a way to reduce the number of brown people.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>More than 62,000 Latinos lived in Escondido in 2006, making up 44% of the population, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. That marks a significant jump since 1990, when roughly 25,000 Latinos lived in the city and were 23% of the population. The non-Latino white population, meanwhile, dropped between 1990 and 2000 by nearly 11%.</p>
<p>The elementary school district&rsquo;s demographics have also shifted. Latinos made up 48% of the student body in the 1997-98 school year and 65% in 2007-08, according to the California Department of Education.</p>
<p>Cornelius, of UC San Diego, said Escondido is a hotbed of anti-immigration activity in part because its population is largely conservative and in part because it has been a destination for immigrants &mdash; both legal and undocumented &mdash; looking for work.</p>
<p>The city is trying to make illegal immigrants&rsquo; lives so uncomfortable that they will go away, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Immigrants say the city&rsquo;s hostility toward them makes it difficult to live in Escondido. The proposed parking ordinance, for example, is meant to discourage multiple families from sharing a single home, Councilman Gallo said.</p>
<p>Lucina Carachure, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico, lives in a neighborhood littered with trash and full of boarded-up apartment buildings. On her husband&rsquo;s monthly income of $1,800, Carachure said, the family of five cannot afford to live alone.</p>
<p>So they share a two-bedroom apartment with another couple and their baby. Together, they pay $1,000 in rent.</p>

			<p>Good luck. Escondido is a tiny island of Americans surrounded by an ocean of illegals.</p>
<p>&#8220;The police department&rsquo;s most controversial move, however, was establishing checkpoints to find unlicensed drivers&hellip;&ldquo;Some folks say they are controversial because they target a specific segment of the population,&rdquo; he said.&#8221;</p>
<p>Controversial? As in &#8216;they target the specific segment of the population&rsquo; that drives without having drivers licenses? Too funny. But I guess its always &#8216;controversial&rsquo; whenever law enforcement gets applied equally to one of the preferred minorities. </p>

			<p>&#8220;restrict over night street parking&#8221;  I got a ticket for this when I was twenty. I thought it was crazy. Now I think it`s the greatest thing on earth. Keeps all manner of other irritations from getting a foothold. It is such a wake up call to leave my bedroom community and go to where there are twenty five cars in the street on a single block. </p>

<p>Why is this allowed anywhere? This practice seems designed to bypass any and every labor, wage, and tax law.</p>

			<p>It looks like the influx of illegals and the decay in the physical and cultural environment they bring with them has finally awakened the base population of Escondido to try to actually do something about it.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it&rsquo;s far too late for them, or us, now. The illegals are here, and they continue to flood over the border. And the laws of a corrupt state and federal government specifically designed to keep them here, are, selectively, the only laws that will be seriously enforced.  </p>

			<p>When I lived in Penasquitos (just south of Escondido) in the 1980&rsquo;s, I got home from a concert in Vista, and calmly left my rear right window slightly ajar, with a nice trendy jacket in the back seat (nothing expensive, @$20 at the time) before I went into the house. I parked my car in the driveway, thought nothing of it, and went in. Next morning, I jumped into my little Honda, and noticed a draft as I was driving down the road- some illegal alien had broken my window in, and stolen my jacket! Police and insurance said it clearly was the work of &#8216;illegals&rsquo; walking the neighborhood at night.</p>
<p>This was almost thirty years ago, when the Latino population was much less, and those that were, ALL spoke English, becuase they KNEW that if they didn&rsquo;t, we&rsquo;d let them know our disapproval.</p>
<p>Last month, I visited my dad in SD. We went to IHOP for breakfast, and, besides my dad and myself, ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE RESTAURANT WERE HISPANIC, and ALL WERE SPEAKING SPANISH. It was a case of &#8220;WE had become the &#8216;minority.&rsquo;&#8221; But will ANYONE give US &#8216;reparations&rsquo;? No creo Yo!</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking a &#8216;nice&rsquo; neighborhood, where houses now cost $500K, and yet&hellip;. we have &#8216;day laborers&rsquo; in open view at all hours of the day, clearly vagrants, clearly unwashed, clearly squatting on public (or private!) land, and all clearly ILLEGAL. YET the US Gov&rsquo;t does NOTHING! Escondido is  far, far worse than Penasquitos or Rancho Bernardo. And the taquerias, the lavanderias, and the lowriders on the streets of Escondido are, er, HAVE BEEN, a ubiquitous feature of the city for some time, that once was a haven for Midwesterners looking for a less expensive version of Paradise.</p>
<p>No more.</p>
<p>YOu want to curb illegal aliens, California? DEPORT THEM, NOW. EVERY SINGLE LAST STINKIN&rsquo; ONE OF THEM. (with a nod of the head to Cheech and Chong)</p>
<p>If not, ha! Buena suerte, gringos! Hasta la vista, California. The American dream is dead. Thank God I left it when I did. I can at least remember the &#8216;Golden State,&rsquo; before it became merely &#8216;the Brown state.&rsquo;</p>

			<p>Let&rsquo;s use EVERY LEGISLATIVE tool and tactic available. Including pollution elimination (by old cars, overpopulation, trash dumping, etc.)</p>
<p>The BEST way would be for the feds to utilize the National Guard to work hand-in-hand with local law enforcement agencies to round up and deport ALL ILLEGAL ALIENS. First fingerprinting and photographing them. Then if they return and are caught a second time, a 20-year MANDATORY PRISON TERM   &mdash;   no parole, no time off for good behavior. Borrow a page from the old USSR, to rid ourselves of 30 million parasites, criminals and social burdens.</p>

			<p>One would think that legal citizens of Mexican descent would also want to preserve their town. Why does ethnic loyalty have to extend to the point where one&rsquo;s own way of life is jeopardized?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious about Councilman Gallo. Is he of Hispanic or Italian ancestry? In either language it means &#8220;rooster&#8221;.</p>

			<p>I lived in a 5,000 sqft home overlooking the 15 freeway in Escondido in the early part of this decade and could see a noticeable difference in the area I lived in as one traveled further east. I do not condone entry into any country unlawfully and would agree to stricter government sponsored repercussions to those who would do so; however, something must be said about those who would solicit the services of those day laborers who obviously see residing in the city as lucrative if they are getting picked up and offered work.</p>
<p>How about cracking down on those who employ these people and imposing penalties upon them? The root of the problem is that there is a market for their services&hellip;. no demand, no supply of the workforce&hellip; </p>
<p>Further; the cost of housing or residence in the community may encourage them to move into the area&hellip; raise the rents and this would force them to find housing elsewhere&hellip; take a lesson from a city re-engineering playbook&hellip;if you want to remove a specific social class from an area remove any possibility of affordability or accommodation and there will be no option but to move&hellip;</p>
<p>Lastly, there may be a transient element to the issue as I noticed a lot of public transportation available in and around the city which connect to other less affluent communities in vista and san marcos. </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m afraid Gary is correct. It is too late for California. Far,far to late. Illegal aliens and former illegal aliens, and those to be former illegal aliens have and will have in the future the run of the state. As one poster has often reminded, the lunches and breakfasts at Los Angeles County school districts would put a Marriot Hotel buffet to shame. And despite this, the food is often thrown in the trash less than half eaten. California citizens on fixed incomes, and others pay for it all. Leaving the state is the only solution to the taxes that the reconquistas and ethnic interest groups force the citizenry to pay, and this will never, as Gary points out, change. </p>
<p>California should be a warning and a lesson to other States in the U.S. You will be conquered and you will serve,(racist ethnic groups interests) whether you like it or not. You will subsizdize the incompetence that is Mexico, whether you like it or not. It has been decreed by our &#8220;elites&#8221;.</p>
