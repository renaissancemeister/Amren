						<p>Twenty-five people with albinism have been murdered in Tanzania since March, a BBC investigation has found.</p>
<p>Albinos are targeted for body parts that are used in witchcraft, and killings continue despite government efforts to stamp out the grisly practice, the BBC&rsquo;s Karen Allen says.</p>
<p>Once, albinos used to seek shelter from the sun. Now they have gone into hiding simply to survive, after a series of killings linked to witchcraft.</p>
<p>In Tanzania, 25 albinos have been killed in the past year.</p>
<p>The latest victim was a seven-month-old baby. He was mutilated on the orders of a witchdoctor peddling the belief that potions made from an albino&rsquo;s legs, hair, hands, and blood can make a person rich.</p>
<p>Sorcery and the occult maintain a strong foothold in this part of the world, especially in the remote rural areas around the fishing and mining regions of Mwanza, on the shores of Lake Victoria.</p>
<p>Nobody seems to know why the killings are happening now, but Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete is now putting pressure on the police to identify where albinos live and offer them protection.</p>
<p>This is not an easy task when BBC investigations suggest that some police are being &#8220;bought off&#8221; in order to look away when such appalling crimes are committed.</p>
<p><b>&lsquo;We want your legs&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>The last adult albino to be murdered &mdash; just a few weeks ago &mdash; was Nyerere Rutahiro.</p>
<p>He was eating dinner outside in his modest rural compound, when a gang of four strangers burst in, and threatened to arrest him. As his wife Susannah looked on helplessly, the men began to hack at Nyerere&rsquo;s arms and legs with machetes.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want your legs,&#8221; they shouted, &#8220;We want your legs,&#8221; his wife recalls, still deeply traumatised by what she saw.</p>
<p>Nyerere was clearly being targeted for being albino &mdash; but in every other respect he was an accepted part of his community. A father of two in his 50s, farming cassava &mdash; just like everybody else.</p>
<p>His body was laid to rest in a cement-sealed grave to protect against grave robbers who often steal body parts of the dead to give to witchdoctors. A builder had been hired to do the job.</p>
<p>Looking on as the funeral came to a close, is Nyerere&rsquo;s sister Winifrida. She too is albino.</p>
<p>Terrified, she pulls her six year-old-son closer to her. Though he is black (the gene that causes albinism is a recessive gene), he too is vulnerable.</p>
<p>It is all too clear what is going through Winifrida&rsquo;s mind. Will they come for her next?</p>
<p>Squinting her pale eyes against the midday sun, Winifrida whispers in a barely audible voice: &#8220;Please, ask the government to take me away from here, I dare not come out of the house since my brother was killed.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>BBC investigation</b></p>
<p>This is the work of organised gangs, according to Tanzanian police in the commercial capital Dar es Salaam.</p>
<p>Witchdoctors, middlemen and the clients who pay for albino body parts are among the 173 people in custody so far for these macabre killings. None has been prosecuted.</p>
<p>The BBC sought to investigate how sorcerers&rsquo; tales of albinos are being channelled into gruesome crimes.</p>
<p>An intermediary posing as a &#8220;client&#8221; with mining and fishing interests seeking to get rich quick, visited a prominent witchdoctor on our behalf at dusk. They were told that albino body parts could be obtained without difficulty, for a price.</p>
<p>The police are now investigating these claims. Since then, a seven-month-old albino baby was killed nearby.</p>
<p><b>Ostracised</b></p>
<p>The sad reality is that albinos who can afford it, are now flocking to urban centres where they feel a little more safe.</p>
<p>And nowhere is it considered more safe than at the Ocean Cancer Institute in Dar es Salaam &mdash; where so many of them come to get treatment for the skin and eye conditions that albinos often fall prey to.</p>
<p>Away from the wards, under the shade of a mango tree, a black woman sits with her albino daughter. Ashura and Amina, her angelic looking nine-year-old.</p>
<p>They may seem an odd couple at first, but the firm eyes of the mother reveals a woman deeply protective of her child. She is a woman who looks older than her years.</p>
<p>Ashura and Amina now live on their own, ostracised by the rest of their family.</p>
<p>&#8220;When Amina was born my husband and the older two children moved away,&#8221; recounts Ashura.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were so ashamed and thought Amina would bring us bad luck &hellip;  but I am not leaving her &hellip;  she&rsquo;s my daughter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Every parent nurturing an albino child has good reason to be frightened in today&rsquo;s Tanzania. The stories of youngsters being snatched from their parents&rsquo; arms or attacked on the way to school are &mdash; quite frankly &mdash; horrific.</p>
<p><b>Albino MP</b></p>
<p>Albinism affects one in 20,000 people worldwide, but in Tanzania the prevalence appears to be much higher.</p>
<p>The Albino Association of Tanzania says that although just 4,000 albinos are officially registered in the country, they believe the actual number could be as high as 173,000. A census is now under way to try to verify the figures.</p>
<p>Demonised by the ignorant, prized by the superstitious, albinos are now getting organised in urban centres &mdash; putting their trust in Tanzania&rsquo;s first albino MP.</p>
<p>Al-Shymaa Kway-Geer is an impressive woman, who was nominated by the Tanzanian president to give the albino community a voice.</p>
<p>Not only is she trying to lobby for subsidies to assist her community for the medical treatment they invariably need as a result of their albinism, but she aims to lead by example.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I used to go out, people called me zeru zeru (the derogatory term for albino). They used to chase me, follow me, but now I am someone, they call me honourable, the term we use for politicians,&#8221; Mrs Kway-Geer says.</p>
<p>Understandably, she is distressed and baffled by the recent spate of albino killings which do not appear to be replicated among Tanzania&rsquo;s neighbours.</p>
<p>But she hopes that by standing up and being counted as possibly the world&rsquo;s first albino lawmaker, the rest of Tanzanian society will start to care.<br>

			<p>It is hard to imagine a more horrible way to live. To be in terror of being chopped up at any moment 24 hours a day 7 days a week for your entire life is gruesome. Apparently the guy was still alive to witness the body-parts snatchers chopping him to pieces. I can&rsquo;t help but wonder if something like this is in store for white people in the future and imagining there will be other nonwhites in the market for white body parts. </p>

			<p>One of the things that really bugs me is how, even in racially aware circles, the implications of this behavior are pretty much left unexamined.  The point is not that blacks are violent.  Almost all of their behavior has this element.  Or even that blacks are evil.  A quick look at any black controlled country turns up plenty of evidence of that.  But that blacks, on a large scale, engage in satan worship.  That is the source of dark rituals of this nature.  Blacks worship and always have, various demonic powers and huge numbers, even in the western world are overt satanists.  Not the pretend satanists you see those idiot goth kids engaging in.  But the real deal, where it is very common for them to engage in things like ritualistic murder.</p>
<p>It used to be taken for granted that blacks were the &#8220;descendents of Cain&#8221;.  Aside from the literal meaning, which I doubt any but the highest religious authorities in the Vatican can opine convincingly about, the symbolic meaning of this is quite clear.  Where whites have at our root, thousands of years of Christianity and a dedication toward good and God as the very foundation of our culture, societies and government, blacks are almost the diametric opposite.  </p>
<p>They worship evil.  And it is high time we at least noticed this.</p>

<p>I was thinking that same thing about a recent story about world relief to Africa. I didn&rsquo;t think of it until later. The story was about world hunger and starvation in Africa. No one made the connection to that happening here. It was too abstract a concept for us I guess. Oh - There were plenty of &#8216;racial&rsquo; comments, but in the entire thing, no one considered that along with racial replacement, real hunger and starvation could be coming to the USA. Starvation. That&rsquo;s an important thing to overlook. Even us &#8216;racists&rsquo; can use a wake-up call sometimes. If us racist whites can&rsquo;t make enough food, how will we send any to places like Africa? (that&rsquo;s in case Bono is listening)  </p>

<p>&gt; Completely wrongheaded analysis of the situation.  Not only do they not worship &#8220;Satan&#8221; or evil as an object or with intention, but Christianity is nothing more than symbolic human sacrifice and cannibalism full of superstition and illogical claims borrowed from pre-existing &#8220;pagan&#8221; religions.  Christianity has not been the foundation of Western culture, but a parasite on it - and for less than two-thousand years.  If Christian practices had prevailed in the West without the intervention of older philosophical pursuits for real truth, most of us would still be serfs in Europe and believe the world was flat.</p>
<p>Whites will not find a way to survival as a groups until it rids itself of the thought virus of Chrsitianity that comes with so many nullifying contradictions.</p>

			<p>But whiteplight, a catholic priest divised the theory of the Big Bang, Mendel (the monk) done revolutionary work in genetics and the Bishop and scholar Alcuin played a major part in development of our alphabet. <br>
However I agree the christianity of Pat Robertson, John Hagee etc is indeed a &#8220;thought virus&#8221; (although still not as dangerous as liberalism and feminism). </p>

			<p>&ldquo;Completely wrongheaded analysis of the situation. Not only do they not worship &ldquo;Satan&rdquo; or evil as an object or with intention&hellip;&rdquo; </p>
<p>Whatever they do worship, this force they seek to have benefit them acts in menacing ways with ill intent towards those it afflicts. It demands payment in blood, bone, and whatnot. To be unaware of this is to be ignorant. Other races as well are involved in dark practices. You do not have to dig too deep to find that hispanics are in to some truly wicked stuff. The asians do not get a pass either. They are known for using curses to do harm to others. <br>

			<p>I would hesitate before saying that blacks are &#8220;innately&#8221; drawn to witchcraft or satan worship.  The ancient Mesoamerican civilizations practiced ritual human sacrifice on a massive scale, and pre-Christian European tribes may have also practiced human sacrifice.  At the same time, we repeatedly hear stories out of Africa (and Haiti, I might add), that are truly disturbing and inhuman, and which seem like they are out of another time in history.  </p>
<p>The interaction of religion and race is an interesting subject, but one prone to overgeneralizations.  For example, it seems as though whites, in general, have had a peculiar resistance to converting to Sunni Islam throughout history: the &#8220;whitest&#8221; conquered peoples, such as the Lebanese or the Persians, either refused to convert or adopted Shiite Islam instead.  East Asians have been resistant to it as well, even as Christianity spreads rapidly in Korea and China.  Yet cultural differences might be playing a role here too, not to mention political issues, etc.  It would all make for an interesting, and very politically incorrect academic study. </p>

<p>These things are true but those civilizations went extinct!! so why are the blacks still hanging around?? because we whites just keep on giving, giving, giving, giving, giving You get the point.</p>

<p>This is toooooo funny. Here in many of the camps in Iraq, including the one I am on, UGANDANS are the security force. The U.S. military, particularly the Marines, want to arm all of their troops with the M-4 but it is said there are not enough but ALL OF THE UGANDANS HAVE M-4s????? Weapons are our friends.</p>
