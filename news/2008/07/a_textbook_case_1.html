						<p>{snip} Here, for example, is a multiple-choice question that appears in a recent edition of a Saudi fourth-grade textbook, Monotheism and Jurisprudence, in a section that attempts to teach children to distinguish &#8220;true&#8221; from &#8220;false&#8221; belief in god:</p>
<p>Q. Is belief true in the following instances:</p>
<p>a) A man prays but hates those who are virtuous.<br>
b) A man professes that there is no deity other than God but loves the unbelievers.<br>
c) A man worships God alone, loves the believers, and hates the unbelievers.</p>
<p>The correct answer, of course, is c). According to the Wahhabi imams who wrote this textbook, it isn&rsquo;t enough just to worship god or just to love other believers &mdash; it is important to hate unbelievers as well. By the same token, b) is also wrong. Even a man who worships god cannot be said to have &#8220;true belief&#8221; if he loves unbelievers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unbelievers,&#8221; in this context, are Christians and Jews. In fact, any child who sticks around in Saudi schools until ninth grade will eventually be taught that &#8220;Jews and Christians are enemies of believers.&#8221; They will also be taught that Jews conspire to &#8220;gain sole control of the world,&#8221; that the Christian crusades never ended, and that on Judgment Day &#8220;the rocks or the trees&#8221; will call out to Muslims to kill Jews.</p>
<p>These passages, it should be noted, are from new, &#8220;revised&#8221; Saudi textbooks. {snip}</p>
<p>The promised revision &mdash; hailed, at the time, as a great diplomatic success &mdash; was supposed to be finished by the beginning of the 2008-09 school year and was accompanied by a Saudi PR campaign. {snip} But although the beginning of the 2008-09 school year is nearly upon us, the only textbook revisions have been superficial, and the most disturbing part of the message &mdash; that faithful Muslims should hate Jews and Christians &mdash; remains.</p>
<p>{snip} Saudi school textbooks are a special case, however. They are written and produced by the Saudi government and subsequently distributed, free of cost, to Saudi-sponsored schools as far afield as Lagos, Nigeria, and Buenos Aires, Argentina. Americans are not the only ones who worry about their influence. In Britain, a small political storm began last year when British mosques were found to be distributing Saudi books that called on Muslims to kill all apostates.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Here is a novel idea for both of them: Make sure that children in Iraq, Afghanistan, and in Islamic schools all around the world have decent fourth-grade textbooks. It might save a lot of trouble later on.<br>

			<p>If this were a mens&rsquo; club, those beliefs would have the FBI investigating it day and night, bugging its meeting rooms, and infiltrating its membership.<br>
But it calls itself a &#8220;religion&#8221;, and the FBI leaves it alone.<br>

			<p>&#8220;Revised Saudi textbooks still call on fourth-graders to hate Christians, Jews.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the imams and mosques in the West do about the same, along with some of them promoting jihad and takeover of their adopted countries.</p>
<p>The only group more insane are the whites who comprise the left who are encouraging the importation of these people into their countries, under some foolish notion that tribalizing every Western country will make it unlikely that white nationalism will rear its head and cause another war.  They claim they need tax units to help pay for retirees, but that&rsquo;s nonsense since the amount they hand out to these people in social programs FAR exceeds anything that might be paid to retirees.</p>
<p>Too bad for them white nationalism is more likely to come to power once more, because of the wretched denigration and oppression of whites necessary to pull off this insane scheme.  And, of course, the rabid animosity for the third worlder&rsquo;s adopted country&rsquo;s tradition, culture, government and way of life, only adds to white hostility.</p>
<p>Has somebody told these white elites that many people are making a list and checking it twice to determine whose been naughty and whose been nice?</p>
<p>I suppose they have, but radical leftist arrogance is as skewed as black arrogance, and I&rsquo;m fully aware that they believe they will remain in control.</p>
<p>Imagine their surprise when the situation turns against them and they first learn they&rsquo;re going to be guests of honor at a local pig roast.</p>

			<p>The problem with that &#8220;novel idea&#8221; is that for islamic schools, those ARE decent textbooks. </p>
<p>There will be trouble on its way for as long as there are islamic schools anywhere, because the crusade- that is,  the islamic crusade to destroy &amp; replace all other ways of life everywhere- which began with Mohammed himself and has left a bloody trail of destruction and oppression wherever it has reached, has never stopped.</p>
<p>They will not stop of their own accord, for they truly believe that what they do pleases god.  </p>
<p>To learn more about the bloody toll the &#8220;religion of peace&#8221; is taking on the world right now, as you read this, take a look at this informative site: <a href="https://www.thereligionofpeace.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.thereligionofpeace.com/</a></p>
<p>There are also many links to other sites with more information about islam, both current and its history.  It is vital that we know. </p>

			<p>That&rsquo;s funny. I thought George Bush told us the Saudis were our &#8220;friends&#8221;? Doesn&rsquo;t he routinely go on his trips there to hold hands with these despots? Funny how he never seemed to care about &#8220;spreading democracy&#8221; to Saudi Arabia, rated by FREEDOM HOUSE as the least free country in the world.</p>

			<p>The gay lobby is growing in influence, especially here in the U.S. Yet one does not hear a peep from them about the spread of Islam, whitch under sharia law simply calls for the beheading of all gays. No tolerance, no undersanding, no trials, just off with their heads, And of course Islam is growing by leaps and bounds here in the U.S. thanks of course to immigration policies specifically designed to destroy white American and our once Christian heritage. I think it would be great if gays would voice resistance to Muslim immigration because it threatens their lifestyle. and their lives. And gays are about the only Americans the congress listens to. Muslim immigration is absolute madness. Muslims will never assimilate. Their faith forbids it. Where&rsquo;s the gay lobby when we need them. </p>

			<p>What about a virtuous man who does not need some alien supernatural being to command him, with rewards or punishment?</p>
<p>What if I just choose to do good?</p>
<p>I drove up to Denver a year ago to testify for a friend in part of his ongoing divorce case.  I slept on the floor in my usual place, near the door.</p>
<p>In the court anteroom, I was mistaken by his ex-wife&rsquo;s lawyer for my friend&rsquo;s laywer.   </p>
<p>My friend&rsquo;s ex-wife never showed up.</p>
<p>We returned to his apartment, in time to see a nearly new bed being put out as trash by the complex work crew.  Since he had been sleeping on his sofa, we snagged that and the mattress was a pure nightmare to get up three flights of stairs.  The corners on that flight of stairs were torture.</p>
<p>I do good, not because I am &#8220;commanded&#8221; to do so, or because I believe in a supernatural reward, but because I choose to do so, or because I think, &#8220;What would my mother do?&#8221;  That day, it was because my friend was being harrassed by his ex-wife, so I drove up to Denver.  I was there for him, and the bed and box springs were an accident.</p>
<p>A new religion, in which one does the right thing because it is right would be good.  We could start with the Golden Rule: &#8220;Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.&#8221;</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..<br>
I don&rsquo;t think so, Miss Applebaum (should be Apfelbaum).  You are interpreting into this what you personally WANT to put there.  What is your motive?  </p>
<p>In fact, Christians and Jews are acknowledged by Islam as the other &#8220;Peoples of the Book&#8221; and are allowed special privileges and exemptions which are not accorded to any other sects.   While devout Wahibis doubtless do not have much love for Christians or Jews, it is atheists, polytheists, and members of all non-Abrahamic religions who are denied ANY tolerance at all. Thus, the Peoples of the Book actually have  a privileged status which the other belief systems of the world do not enjoy.</p>
<p>Islam is not an especially tolerant religion - least of all Wahabism -  but Christians and Jews still come out better than all other  &#8220;unbelievers&#8221;.   Why only zero in on two?</p>
