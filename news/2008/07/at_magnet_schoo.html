					<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Alison Chandler, Washington Post, July 7, 2008</i></p>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Asian American students will outnumber white classmates for the first time in the freshman class at the region&rsquo;s most prestigious public magnet school this fall, a milestone reached as the number of African Americans and Hispanics has remained low and the Fairfax County School Board prepares to review the school&rsquo;s admission policy.</p>
<p>At Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in the Alexandria area this year, more than 2,500 applicants vied for 485 seats. Asian American students got 219, or 45 percent of the total, while white students got 205, or 42 percent. About 38 percent of the school&rsquo;s students were Asian American in the past school year.</p>
<p>T.J., as the school is known, draws students from several Northern Virginia jurisdictions. It ranks among the nation&rsquo;s top public schools in some surveys because of its rigorous curriculum and high-achieving students. Its average combined SAT score in 2007 was 2155, compared with 1639 countywide. More than 150 of its students that year were semifinalists for National Merit scholarships.</p>
<p>A plurality of Asian American students in a high school class would be an anomaly in the Washington region, where fewer than one in 10 residents is Asian American. In Fairfax, which supplies most of the school&rsquo;s students, people of Asian descent account for 16 percent of the population, census data show. That percentage has doubled since 1990 and is the highest in the area.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The rising concentration of Asian Americans at T.J. mirrors demographic trends in other elite math and science magnet schools. In New York, the selective and specialized Stuyvesant High School, Bronx High School of Science and Brooklyn Technical High School have Asian American majorities, although about 10 percent of the metropolitan population is of Asian descent. In San Francisco, Asian Americans make up more than 60 percent of the students at selective Lowell High School and about a third of the city&rsquo;s population.</p>
<p>The success of Asian American students reflects the educational commitment found in many immigrant communities, particularly for second-generation students fluent in English and encouraged by upwardly mobile parents who came to the United States for higher education or professional positions.</p>
<p>The demographic imbalance in top public magnet schools has become a sensitive issue, however. Black and Hispanic students often are vastly under-represented. Many of the schools struggle to reflect the diversity of the wider population while maintaining a transparent admissions process with uniformly high standards.</p>
<p>Jenny Tsai, a recent Harvard University graduate, wrote her thesis about what she perceived as a growing sentiment that &#8220;too many Asians&#8221; were at top magnet schools. She attended the selective Hunter College High School in New York, where she sensed &#8220;a certain level of anxiety&#8221; as the portion of Asian American students in the entering class grew from less than a third to more than half between 1997 and 2003. Tsai said some students felt a need to justify their admission or their contributions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Admissions offices at top private colleges are becoming the front line for debates about equal access as the supply of high-caliber Asian American applicants swells and colleges try to maintain student diversity. Some Asian Americans contend that they face informal quotas and are forced to meet higher standards, similar to hurdles that Jewish Americans faced in the first part of the 20th century.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Fairfax School Board has adjusted the T.J. admissions policy over time to reflect legal decisions and changing politics. An affirmative action policy that allowed racial and ethnic variations in academic benchmarks was abandoned in the late 1990s. Afterward, admissions of black and Hispanic students plummeted. In 2001, nine black or Hispanic students were admitted, down from nearly 50 in 1994, according to the board&rsquo;s Minority Student Achievement Oversight Committee.</p>
<p>In 2004, the board adopted an admissions policy that takes racial and ethnic diversity into account as a &#8220;plus factor&#8221; but not a determining factor. {snip}</p>
<p>Despite those changes and a weekend enrichment program meant to help prepare promising candidates from under-represented groups, admissions of Hispanic and black students have increased only slightly. The incoming class will have 10 Hispanic and nine African American students. The School Board is scheduled to review the admissions policy this month. Whether it will alter the policy is unclear, but the issue is sure to draw close attention from many parents.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Minority advocates and education experts say raising black and Hispanic enrollment at T.J. must be a long-term effort.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you have been behind the eight ball since kindergarten,&#8221; an admissions policy or a middle school preparation program is not going to help much, said John Johnson, a member of the minority student oversight committee. He said parents and communities must push as soon as possible to put students on a faster academic track.</p>

			<p>I see Asian studying and trying much harder than whites.  I&rsquo;m in a university library to study right now and I&rsquo;m mostly surrounded by Asians.  I&rsquo;m often the only white is my graduate classes for computer science.  Most of the whites on campus are studying business, or in other words, wasting their time.</p>

			<p>Don&rsquo;t panic out too much boys and girls.</p>
<p>Fairfax County is known by many (to the left of Josef Stalin) as the People&rsquo;s Republic of Fairfax.</p>
<p>It is something of a paradox, in as much as it has a large non-white population, about 1/3, but is still one of the wealthiest counties in the United States.</p>
<p>One can only speculate on the legerdemain used by the bureaucrats to ensure Whites became a minority at this elite magnate school.</p>
<p>Also bear in mind, a large percentage of the rich and not so rich Whites send their children to private schools, which culls down the number of White intellectual elite students, who would normally apply to this school.<br>

			<p>The Washington comPOST, never misses an opportunity to print articles which cast whites in a negative light. But there may be more to the story than just Asian &#8220;brilliance&#8221;. For example,in China preparation courses for the entrance exam to Stuyvesant HS in NYC and probably to TJ are offered in various cities in China.Since there is no control on who enters this country and illegal aliens have the &#8220;right&#8221; to attend school in the US, I wonder how many of these Asians &#8220;geniuses&#8221; are in this country illegally. So American born whites,blacks and hispanics may be competing against a select group of the brightest adolescents in a population 5 times that of the US. For those Asians, especially South Asians(India) who believe they are intellectually superior to whites and this is just sour grapes, a caucasian group (Ashkenazi Jews) have the highest average IQs. On average Indians have lower IQs than caucasians, and the Indians who immigrated to the US are the smartest out of a population of one billion.  </p>

			<p>Thomas Jefferson High School was the school the V-Tech massacure killer went to before being welcomed for his diversity at V-Tech.  The V-tech victums&rsquo; families received $6 Million for their loved ones but the people whoes pets were poisoned by the Chinese contaminated pet food got $25 Million.</p>

<p>A burgeoning racial consciousness is emerging from Jenny, one she is writing a thesis on, receiving maximum extra credit for sure. There must be a white/asian dynamic at play here. It&rsquo;s the only explanation for her not being censured by the school, parents, and her community.</p>

			<p>Gosh, what a surprise!  Races with a strong work ethic, who are demonstrably intelligent, and focus on long-term objectives, are doing well in the Virginia school system.</p>
<p>Of course, they&rsquo;re probably not well represented on the offensive line of the high school football team.</p>

			<p>The problem is with Asian and other foreign groups who attend our top schools and then return home.  It is a brain drain on our educational system and doesn&rsquo;t benefit our society at all except perhaps they will engineer better electronics in Taiwan or China.  </p>
<p>The Asians do well in mathematics because of their language.  Written Chinese or Japanese lends itself well with the symbolics used in mathematics.  I&rsquo;ll admit that many of them are academically excellent in math and computer science but many of them failed miserably in English language and other courses not related to their discipline.  At my university, many would rather write off these courses in pursuit of their academic major.  Also, cheating is pandemic at universities with many of the foreign nationals.  It was common to find them with last the prior semester&rsquo;s tests obtained through either stealing or academic collusion.  In other words, they would do anything to succeed.</p>

			<p>Asians aren&rsquo;t smart.  They&rsquo;re just good at mind-numbing memorization. Subjects like math and computer science are easy, but just require hours of boring study; something Asians are good at. How come you never seen Asians in honors English and Art classes?</p>
<p>Also, Asians cheat a lot. In fact, cheating is openly encouraged in Chinese and Japanese cultures. They have no honor system, which whites invented. This along with affirmative action is why Asians are so over-represented are these supposed &#8220;elite&#8221; schools.</p>
<p>Anyone who thinks Asians are smarter is just a closet Asianphile.</p>

			<p>Asians work harder than whites but are not smarter as the first poster John has stated.<br>
 The Asian vs Caucasian IQ comparison is very interesting. It is very difficult to get a handle on this due to the fact that the Asian Population Worldwide is huge, much larger than the Caucasian. The Asians who get to the United States tend to be from the very upper end of the bell curve. When they test on standardized tests they score a tiny bit higher in a very interesting way.<br>
When you compare the top 10% of Asians vs the top 10% of Caucasians the Caucasians will score better. When you compare the top 25% of Asians vs the top 25% of Caucasians they score about equal. By the time you compare the top 50% of Asians vs top 50% of Caucasians the Asians have pulled ahead. When you compare the whole group of Asians vs Caucasians the IQ difference is about 104 for Asians vs 100 for Caucasians. Most the the difference between Asians and Caucasians in the United States is on the left side of the respective Bell Curves. This is why when you look at who wins the Nobel Prizes it is mostly Caucasian. These people typically come from the upper one percent of the IQ group. Jewish people who are Caucasian will typically score better than Asians. <br>
The other factor which is pulling the Caucasian IQ down is the very low fertility rate of very bright white women. White women with IQ&rsquo;s over 120 have less than one child per family. They are too interested in their careers and cannot be bothered to have children. They are destroying Western Civilization but they are extremely selfish and could not care less. I must know about 50 of these types of women. I tend to run into these types do to my work in the high tech industry.<br>

			<p>All week long on the Science Channel there is  series about the history of the space program. The show show last night started off by stating that four hundred thousand people were involved in the space program. Here is one thing you can be certain off:the the racial composition of space program was 99.9 percent White.</p>
<p>In addition to race replacement, this news story points to another serious problem with post 1965 LEGAL immigrant asians:Native Born White American are competing with post-1965 asian &#8220;Americans&#8221; for the scarce resources of America. If the Asian &#8220;American&#8221; gene-line of post-1965 LEGAL asian immigrants weren&rsquo;t here in OUR AMERICA, the racial compostion of this Virginia magnet school would be from 90 to 95 percent White.</p>
<p>Do you think the Chinese living in China and the hindus living in India would put up with a similar state of affairs within their own borders? Not for a minute.</p>
<p>Some people will say that the success of the asian students justifies the continuation of LEGAL asian immigration? But who benefits from this? Native Born White Americans certainly don&rsquo;t. From a White Nationalist perspective, the scarce resource of America should be devoted to developing Native Born White youth not China&rsquo;s and India&rsquo;s youth within the borders of America the Nation founded and created by White Americans.</p>
<p>Post-1965 LEGAL asian immigration is of 0 benefit to Native Born White Americans. As far as the legitimate racial interests of Native Born White American go,this is all that matters. </p>
<p>John(with the asian fetish)</p>
<p>How did Native Born White Americnas survive all those years without post-1965 asian &#8220;Americans&#8221; within the borders of White America? Quite well thank you.</p>

			<p>Interesting comments.  Both the positive and negative things said about Asians are true.  They&rsquo;re smart, they work hard, and they cheat like there&rsquo;s no tomorrow. And you can bet their numbers in these schools will increase. Indeed, most academically elite schools will probably be at least plurality Asian in twenty years. I wonder if the parents of the white children who were rejected have thought through to the real reason underlying their displacement by the water walking yellows and browns?  </p>
<p>An immigration policy which more or less treats native born American citizens like employees of a highly competitive corporation, subject to termination and replacement at any time.</p>
<p>It might work OK for Microsoft and Tyson.  We&rsquo;ll see what kind of country it produces.<br>

			<p>OK, I can&rsquo;t let that one slide.  The VTech killer did NOT go to Thomas Jefferson.  He went to his local HS, where he was a marginally better than average student, but nowhere near the caliber that could have gotten into TJ.  </p>
<p>And now if I may get onto my soapbox for a minute.  I&rsquo;m a lurker, and I for the most part I find this board engrossing and entertaining.  But I have noticed that there are two camps on this site - those who want to have a meaningful discussion on race, unrestrained by the bounds of political correctness, and those who are simply flat out racist.  A good litmus test of which camp you belong to is your attitude towards Asians.  I understand (and usually agree with) the prevailing attitude towards Blacks and Hispanics, because one only has to look at the statistics on crime, poverty, and education to tell that they are a net drain on society.  But the opposite holds true for Asians in this country.  I have yet to see anyone post a logical argument as to why they are bad for this country.  2nd generation  Asian Americans in particular are for the most part, indistinguishable from any well-educated white person.  The main difference is that they look different from you.  And if you dislike a group only because they look different from you, not only does that say you are racist, but it also says something about your level of intelligence.</p>
<p>By the way, if you notice from the article, the percentage of Blacks and Hispanics has dropped at TJ, so it seems that this article should make most of you happy.</p>

<p>Does this mean anti-white rhetoric like this at the high school helped create this killer, or that the killing itself led to this anti-white bias? Or are the two realities independant of each other?</p>
<p>There have certainly been enough white workplace and school yard shootings. It&rsquo;s surprising there aren&rsquo;t more. </p>

			<p>This doesn&rsquo;t really bother me at all.  </p>
<p>East Asians have demonstrated time and again their abilities at intellectual pursuit and actually make pretty good Americans after a generation here.</p>
<p>Predictably, no one bothers to learn the OBVIOUS lesson here.  </p>
<p>Asians do well, especially in comparison to hispanics and blacks, in spite of being a *gasp* minority.</p>
<p>I guess mean old Whitey just isn&rsquo;t trying hard enough to oppress the Asians.  I mean what else could explain their success if every minority failure is attributable to white racism?</p>

<p>Really now? On exactly what do you base this &#8220;honest&#8221; assessment? On the fact that Asians invented the computer you are using to write your &#8220;honest&#8221; statement? How about the Internet you used to post it? Or maybe it&rsquo;s because they invented television, air-conditioning, the car, radio, plumbing, steel architecture, electrical systems, Western medicine, telephony, the cell phone or any of the other hundreds of things you use everyday? You really need to re-think your concept of honesty.</p>

<p>And don&rsquo;t forget affirmative action; because every piece of legislation passed in the last 50 years serve special interest.  Now upwardly mobile Asians who come to the United States for higher education or professional positions, and their Asian American children receive preferential treatment in education, and jobs over hard working European Americans and their children that hover over the poverty limit, and have faced hardships, such as scarcity of food, the minimal of household amenities, donning secondhand clothes, and suffering racial prejudice.  <br>

<p>According to you &#8220;Asians&#8221; are smarter and worker harder than whites.</p>
<p>Then why are white countries far superior to Asian countries in almost every category? (except for the crime rate and we know the reason for that)</p>

			<p>These Asians can excel in their own countries; we don&rsquo;t need them here, to be quite honest.  Yes, they have higher IQs and they are hard workers, but yet white people are still responsible for creating 90% of the world&rsquo;s science. And before any Indian Americans get too arrogant over this article, they need to realize that Indians on average have lower IQs than whites.  This article is mainly talking about Chinese, Koreans, etc&hellip;.</p>

			<p>John; I hate to tell you the &#8220;truth&#8221; but &#8220;Asians&#8221; are not more intelligent.Why does a nation :China, with 1.3 billion people who allegedly are more intelligent need to steal technology from the US? The US with a population only one-fifth as large with supposedly less intelligent people have no need to steal or otherwise obtain technology from China.<br>

<p>Actually that is not true. Inventions like gunpowder, paper, rockets, guns, cannons, irrigation, the first printing press, sail ships, etc&hellip; etc&hellip; were not invented by Europeans. Chemistry, astronomy, and algebra have middle eastern origins. The word algebra itself is Al-Jebrah of arabic origins. Also the entire world uses Arabic numerals not Roman numerals. Europe didn&rsquo;t even invent mathematics it was China and Arabic peoples, only the Greeks had geometry. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve heard this said many times and it&rsquo;s the opposte of the truth.<br>
Firstly, the depth and subtlety of ancient Greekk mathematics and their concept of geometric theorems and rigid mathematical proof was a unique achievement - far in advance of what any other civilization ever achieved (just think of how the work of Archimedes anticipated the calculus and his method of finding the volume of the sphere) - and it remains the bedrock upon which the whole mdern science of mathematics- with all of its myriad of ramifications is based upon.<br>
 Secondly, although I don&rsquo;t doubt the ancient Chinese DID discover some good, true and remarable results (but perhaps in no way matching the Greeks), the work of the early arab authors was largely derivative from the Greeks.<br>
  From the Hindus, of course, we get our modern numerical notation and the concept of zero - but the fact is the Greeks and Romans whilst, admittedly, never having a cipher for zero were aware of the concept when performing calculations on the abacus.<br>
  Thirdly, the modern conception of mathematics as that science that deals with quantity in a hard, eminently logical and analytic way is the the product of the great European mathematicians (starting in Italy and France)who from the 14th to 19th century labored to produce the rigid theorems in algebra, trigonometry, calculus, geometry etc - and whose notation and concepts we still use.</p>

<i>Why is this suprising - another troll harping on about superior Asian intelligence.</i></p>
<p>While I agree that trolling exists on the Internet and that it is disruptive, I also dislike those who throw around this word too lightly. Remember at the bottom of every page it says &#8220;we encourage polite debate.&#8221; Is it not possible that Asians are more intelligent than whites in some areas, and less intelligent in others? Intelligence is a highly complex subject. This is as compared to blacks, who are less intelligent than whites in almost every area, except perhaps in the area of &#8220;social intelligence.&#8221; They certainly have proved themselves very canny in sticking together and manipulating white guilt, albeit certainly with plenty of help from white liberals.</p>

			<p>Actually, the Greeks didn&rsquo;t invent Geometry.  It was developed thousands of years earlier, integrated into the building practices of the Ancient Egyptians.  The Greeks made certain refinements, but the same can be said of anyone people who borrow a technology for their own purposes.</p>
<p>All said, most of the contributions of Northern and Western Euro-ethnotypes is virtually nil until the 16th century.  One may argument that even to this day, most of it&rsquo;s intellectual &#8220;horsepower&#8221; is imported.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Why is this surprising. Asian work harder and are simply more intelligent than Whites.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dear John, work harder yes&hellip;.simply more intelligent than Whites, I disagree. How do you define intelligence? And yes, dear Lucas, Asians,apparently do cheat pretty lot in exams. As a person of Asian descent, sadly I have to admit this. Asians are good at memorizing equations and constants. And they work hard too. But not many of them really understand the &#8220;stories&#8221; and reasoning of scientic theory. And during exam times, some of them are willing to risk of being caught to copy-cat the solutions of the person next to them. Perhaps they knew they couldn&rsquo;t provide a good answer to the question and tried to copy other&rsquo;s, hoping to get &#8220;simpathy&#8221; marks&hellip;.I had this bad experience before, where a girl next to me tried this. </p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;East Asians have demonstrated time and again their abilities at intellectual pursuit and actually make pretty good Americans after a generation here.&#8221;</p>
<p>I am flattered by this praise. But why do you seem to prefer an Asian to be an American citizen over a white person (unless you are an Asian like me)? Some of you white people are really strange. In reverse, I doubt that Asians would welcome whites with open arms in their home countries&hellip;.Yes, a lot of whites dolive in Asia, but they are mostly rich expatriates. But this is another issue all together. The point is, whether Asian excel or not, whites should take responsibilty for their own country, people and society. We asians would resent for example if you whites start to migrate to our countries in large numbers, outnumbering the native inhabitants. Same thing here.Thats why I don&rsquo;t understand some of you whites.<br>
Courtney, I have deep respect for you. <br>
Your words might sound harsh but they are truly meaningful. </p>

<p>Another product of PC American schooling. So the Chinese invented such and such in 300 BC.  So what?  The fact remains that 90% of science was developed by whites.  This is simply what every book that discusses the history of science talks about.  And some of the stuff the Chinese are given credit for are either ridiculous exaggerations or there were people in the West who had them at the same time (sailing ships??? give me a break&hellip;you must not know much about the Greeks and Romans).  Guns?  Try again.  Modern math?  Even more ridiculous.</p>
<p>As for arabs, they did squat.  Most of their science was based on what Greeks did.  Please explain why their countries are such 1st world paradises today while Europe is third world (sarcasm noted here).  The same goes for India.  And people need to educate themselves and understand that many of the people who lived in the Near East and India at one time were actually white.<br>

			<p>Well, at least they are not criminal, that&rsquo;s my attitude since they seem to be here to stay. I prefer e asians over indians and pakistanis because the latter two groups tend to have higher crime rates and their IQ swings wildly since they are not as homogeneous as the e asians. And I don&rsquo;t care who is smarter or more creative!!!!!!</p>
<p>If I had to choose, I&rsquo;d live among e asians as oppose to other non-white immigrants. I&rsquo;ve felt very safe in those areas where they are a majority. People understand how to live with others, they like white people, they or their children are usually very well educated, and the kids are very respectful. I like asian food as well. I also like se asian food but less open to living among se asians. I&rsquo;d prefer to send my kids with white and e asian kids since I like their behavior and work ethic. </p>
<p>Since this seems to be a reality, I&rsquo;m just renumerating how this could be a positive. But I would go back to mostly white if I could, not a racist but just like my own kind. It doesn&rsquo;t seem like this is going to happen.<br>

          Just show me where the Egyptian equivalent of the books of Euclid are or the extant proofs and theorems of all the other Greek mathematicians?<br>
  The works of the Greeks (which was strictly academic in the truest sense - and relied on the concept of rigid, logical proof)was far, far more advanced than that of Egyptians, which seemed to rely on &#8216;practical, rule of thumb&rsquo; methods for building and land surveying and never really progressed into serious academic enquiry.<br>
  Agreed, there was an &#8216;hiatus&rsquo; in mathematics from the time of the Greeks to renaisssance, but the whole vast superstructure of the subject as we know it today is entirely the work of Europeans.One might reel off a few names, Newton, Euler, the Bernoullis, Gauss, Cardan, Descartes, Leibnitz etc etc etc.</p>

<p>Something can be done about it. Shut down all LEGAL asian immigration to 0. AS for the ones that are in OUR AMERICA, theycan be encouraged to leave by creating a social and cultural environment that is hostile to their presense in OUR AMERICA.</p>

<p>Asians excell at mindless memorization and improving on already exsisting technology.</p>
<p>You can harp on about their superior intelligence all day long, but bear in mind that Asia would be at least three centuries behind the West if they had not been exposed to Western technology and culture.</p>

			<p>As white men are the guys who created the modern world, the debate as to who is smarter is a moot point to me. What I have a hard time coming to grips with is just how different Asians are from me. Just one example is the thing about it being disrespectful to look an Asian in the eye when talking to them. When I talk to a person, I want to look them directly in the eye. That this is offensive to an Asian confounds my sensibilities. </p>
<p>It is hard to talk about differences between Asians and white people without seeming crude and offensive. For instance, probably the majority of Asians have no problem with eating dogs. The thought that Asians are dog eaters is disturbing to me. The idea of putting fluffy on the grill just does not seem right. And this makes me culturally insensitive? </p>
<p>Asians practice female infanticide. While some may want to use the argument that white females do abortions, kill children due to post-partum depression, and other nefarious reasons, this is not relevant to the practice of killing newborn females fresh out of the womb. I&rsquo;m talking about Asians who really want a baby, just not a female baby. Of course now portable sonogram devices are making their way to Asia making it possible to eliminate the female fetus before it is born.</p>
<p>I could go on and on about other cultural aspects that differentiate myself from the Asian but will desist as these practices would be hard to write about in a manner that would not seem outrageous and grotesque. And this does not even speak to the global ramifications resulting from the Asian mindset. I&rsquo;m all for Asians doing their own thing in their own countries. I take that back. I just learned that 33% of the air pollution in California comes from China.<br>
