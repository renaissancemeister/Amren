<h1>Spike Lee Takes Jackson to Task for Obama Comments</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Newsmax, July 10, 2008,</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Spike Lee says the Rev. Jesse Jackson&rsquo;s crudely phrased criticism of Barack Obama won&rsquo;t affect the Democrat&rsquo;s campaign, which the filmmaker expects to succeed at bringing &#8220;seismic&#8221; change to the world.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lee predicted Obama would be elected in November.</p>
<p>&#8220;When that happens, it will change everything.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp.; You&rsquo;ll have to measure time by &lsquo;Before Obama&rsquo; and &lsquo;After Obama,&rsquo;&#8221; Lee said during the panel. &#8220;It&rsquo;s an exciting time to be alive now.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything&rsquo;s going to be affected by this seismic change in the universe,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Lee attended the TV group&rsquo;s annual summer session to discuss documentaries he&rsquo;s making for ESPN Films, including one about Kobe Bryant and the Los Angeles Lakers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Asked if there was any validity to the criticism of Obama, Lee replied: &#8220;No. Here&rsquo;s the thing: I don&rsquo;t know why people are questioning whether Barack Obama is black enough. For me, that&rsquo;s an ignorant statement.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are middle-class, educated black people who speak the way he does&hellip; .   We have to try to move away from this so-called image of what black is, which is largely influenced by rap and that type of stuff,&#8221; Lee said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m for Mr. Obama,&#8221; Lee said. &#8220;I think he&rsquo;s gonna win. And it&rsquo;s going to be a better day not only for the United States but for the world.&#8221;<br>

<p>The man is a loon. He thinks people can cause geographic changes in the earth. Like thinking the government tampered with the levees, and manipulated the weather so hurricanes to strike New Orleans.</p>

			<p>So I guess Spike has stopped trolling after Clint Eastwood in an attempt to get his name in the news.</p>
<p>Why do the media pay attention to this clown&rsquo;s opinions? He has made mainly mediocre films for the majority of his career. Why doesn&rsquo;t the media seek out white director&rsquo;s opinions the way they do Lee&rsquo;s?</p>

			<p>Memo to Mr. Spike Lee:</p>
<p><br>
If Detroit, New Orleans, or any other black run city are indicative of what is coming down the pike, then we can agree that if BHO wins, it will NOT be a better day for the USA. </p>

<p>A lot of people seem to think this. Then, if you ask them for an example of what will change, you get the sound of silence.</p>
<p>Every four years people talk about the presidential election as if it will be a major turning point. Every four years, you get just another weak, flawed human being, and life goes on.</p>
<p>The change an Obama presidency will bring is that we won&rsquo;t stop hearing about him every day for four years. But since that process has already started, it won&rsquo;t be much of a change either.</p>

			<p>Spike&rsquo;s quote of &#8221; seismic change &#8221; is what this constitutional patriot is afraid of; he means it will get &#8221; worse &#8221; for us Americans. These racist, parasitic communists are for America&rsquo;s genocidal holocaust; something that has been happening with all the antiwhite and anti-Christian collect laws by either corrupt congress or treasonous courts,including the Supreme Court</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m excited! How &#8216;bout you? Spike says it&rsquo;ll be a GREAT day for the world &hellip; and also for the United States &mdash; mostly&hellip; . Well, probably. OK, possibly. What does it matter, anyway? Africa FIRST, then the rest of the world&rsquo;s fortunes will follow, stylistically speaking, that is. Thank you, Mr. Lee, for your stewardship.</p>

			<p>&#8216;try to move away from this so-called image of what black is&rsquo;</p>
<p>The word &#8216;black&rsquo; means whatever a black wants it to mean. They can have those little victories for now. They&rsquo;ll be scrambling to keep themselves alive if blacks are in charge of blacks or anything else. </p>
<p>McCain is discriminated against because of his age. This discrimination makes him &#8216;black&rsquo;. (Why not? I heard it straight from Stephen Colbert. I enjoy his show when I catch it. How could this not be seriously, politically correct? This country has lost any standard or foundation for laws, rules, or decency of life.)</p>

This is exactly how blacks think.</p>
<p>They believe that the people in power are all-powerful and have the power to do anything, anytime, and any way they want. They believe politicians have access to the money and they can spend it as they see fit or give it away to anyone they please.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why blacks are at first elated by black election victories but then quickly turn on their leaders. Once in power, they expect everything to be turned over to them and when it&rsquo;s not, they see their leaders as &#8216;turning their back on the people who elected them&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The same expectation is going on with Obama in the black community. Blacks believe that if Obama is elected, he will have absolute power to change the cicumstance of blacks in a heartbeat.</p>
<p>Blacks see leaders as dictators. Obama, on his trip to Kenya, even criticized Africans for their attitude of the &#8216;big chief syndrom&rsquo; in which the winner of the election takes all.</p>
<p>Blacks will be dancing in the streets over an Obama win but they will turn on him when he doesn&rsquo;t deliver.</p>

<p>What a load of expected mumbo-jumbos, from Comrade Spike; I wonder, will all the leprechauns of Ireland and elves of the Kebler tree cookie factory, fertility dance on the head of a pin while Nessie and Mokali Imbembi mate on it as well, to consummate this &ldquo;seismic change in the universe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of more importance, will the world&rsquo;s Sasquatches and Yetis be invited to dance at/on the inclusively heady pin party?</p>
<p>The cosmic implications do warrant these questions, in a BC/AD versus BO/AO galaxy in transition and post Jesse &ldquo;the Baptist&rdquo; Jackson universe. </p>
<p>One last question, what does Lord Darth Vader have to say about all this?</p>
<p>My guess would be: &ldquo;Perhaps, you think you are being treated, &lsquo;unfairly?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!<br>

<p>Spike Lee possess no particular qualifications which lends this unfounded prediction any credence whatsoever. He is simply using the artificial influence and puffed up image given to him by the liberal media to say something messianic about a very average and inexperienced politician that he would like to see be president simply based on race. Any of us could do the same thing. The name &#8220;Obama&#8221; may one day rank with such names as Hitler, Mussolini, &#8220;Jim Jones, and David Koresh, but it will never rank with those who truly changed the world: Moses, Jesus, Constantine, Galileo, Copernicus, Luther, Columbus, Washington, Marx, Freud and Einstein. Obama doesn&rsquo;t possess this kind of world-changing genuis in even the most remote way, and anybody who says he does should be laughed at.       </p>

			<p>Blacks in leadership positions, and those who have a certain level of success, rabidly deny that blacks haven&rsquo;t advanced much on their own because of their lack of intlligence and ability.  It&rsquo;s whitey&rsquo;s fault.</p>
<p>As we see endlessly on T.V. the black talking heads constantly attribute black failure to systemic racism, the government, white racism and oppression, etc.  They know the truth, however, but it would be tremendously embarrassing for them to admit it, so they deny and fabricate, hoping their duplicitous efforts pay off and whites are intimidated so greatly blacks will be awarded even more than they are now, and eventually reach a level of success throughout the population on a par with whites.  Spike lee is a fairly dimwitted fellow, and I&rsquo;m positive he believes that all blacks have to do is fill the seats in important positions and that&rsquo;s all it will take to stay there, because he perceives that&rsquo;s all whites are doing.  </p>
<p>On Bill O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s show a while back, O&rsquo;Reilly asked Lee why so many blacks were incarcerated, and he replied that a large number of blacks were in prison compared to whites, because whites have more money and can get out on bond.  Is that imbecilic or not?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that the same kind of logic blacks employ on this site? </p>
<p>So, really, the bottom line is that this election isn&rsquo;t so much about Barack Obama as it is about Spike Lee and others like him. They perceive that in honoring him they honor themselves and the whole world will do the same.  That blacks will continue to drop out, commit crimes, fail, and still show their lack of intelligence, no matter if Obama is elected or not, probably never occurs to the self-appointed black elites who are rooting for him.</p>
<p>If he loses the election, I wonder if they will be instigating war, because of some NEW conspiracy theory their paranoid, inadequate minds have drummed up.<br>

<p>Blacks will not be &#8216;dancing&rsquo; in the streets, whether Obama wins or looses the election blacks will be rioting, looting, robbing and raping a little more freely than usual knowing they will be pardoned. I do wonder though, who the Muslims will blow up in their celebrations.</p>

			<p>Obama, for the most of his life was actually shunned by the black side of his family, raised, educated, clothed,fed, etc. by white family members, what if after he&rsquo;s elected he turns on blacks, tells them to accept responsilbility, go to work, shut up, quit blaming the white devils. This is a very unlikely vision, but if it happened, then maybe Lee&rsquo;s predictions would come true.</p>

			<p>It should be evident to any sentient person that the manipulated U.S. media is the problem, which has spawned Afro &#8220;celebraties&#8221; like Lee and Obama. Media generated propaganda is the cause of the race war being waged against Anglo-Americans, in all of its ugly facets. To recognize this factor is to understand the the animators of the delimma. </p>

			<p>Yes, it will - but only to a degree slightly less than that of McCain, who if elected will want to give trillions more to blacks around the globe to prove he is not racist.</p>
<p>Blacks are the most self-deluded people in the world. They demand to rule Detroit because they will make it even more rich and clean and safe with the added bounus of diversity. Ditto for Newark, Memphis, New Orleans, Oakland, etc. The exact opposite happens, yet blacks continue to assert their faith in their redemptive rule. I think that while most black leaders are simply conmen (they do not believe this stuff, but they spout it gain wealth and power), the vast majority of black people do believe and would pass lie detector tests, answering YES to such questions as: Are black people smarter than whites? Are black people more honest than whites? Do blacks commit fewer crimes per cpaita than blacks? Does black rule prove beneficial to all people?</p>
<p>It is like dealing with a person who is both delusional and immature, who mixes endless childish self-indulgence and the most violent temper tantrums with paranoid visions of epic grandeur telling him he is some perfect combination of religious leader, scholar, lawyer, judge, governor, and general. </p>
<p>Facts can NEVER alter the views of such persons.</p>

			<p>I agree there will be a &#8220;seismic change.&#8221;  America will go the way of Rhodesia, South Africa, Uganda, Detroit, Baltimore, Washington DC ad infinitum.  A once prosperous society will fall.</p>
<p>Blacks simply don&rsquo;t have the intelligence or faculties to lead or maintain any large organization or government.  I will be proven correct, I&rsquo;m sure, but by then it will be too late for all of us.</p>

			<p>Obama surely ain&rsquo;t my mamma and will not surely not be getting my vote.  Likewise he will never sit in the oval office because he will not be elected President.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m contributing to the John McCain campaign and donating to the Republicam Party as well.  Despite all the bitching and moaning here on this site, McCain still stands as the best (albeit seriously flawed) candidate even though he displays an apparently complete disinterest vis-avis WHie Nationalist interests, causes and concerns.<br>
 <br>
So to strike another yet blow, I&rsquo;m also putting my modest money where my mouth is and will contribute a like or greater sum than the two to the organ that singularly expresses my polical views best: Amercian Rennaissance, where my politcal heart truly lies</p>

			<p>As distasteful as Obama Hussein is, I might repeat the above and remind us all that he was raised as a white, by whites. He is used by Muslims and Blacks as a door to power, but in essence he is neither Black nor white. He may turn on either, depending on who pays the most. Also he married a black woman who straightens her hair and tries to be Mary Tyler Moore . Her  sixth grade level doctorate paper indicates hatred for whitey and yet she lives as a white woman. She could convince me she is black by letting her hair go African and dropping the Jackie Kennedy wardrobe . <br>
I am therefore still asking the question, who is behind the Obama Hussein mulatto family. What are they meant to represent and at whom will they be pointed when Prince Obama is King. It could go either way.<br>
I believe he is there to provide army fodder in the way of black men and women for the coming colonization of Zim, Uganda, Iraq and Iran.<br>
Mr. Lee will no doubt make movies showing the great heroes the black boys will be in their fight for the American colony abroad.</p>

Black director says Obama victory will bring &ldquo;seismic change in the universe.&rdquo; <br>
     He&rsquo;s right, it will be the end of the U.S. as we know it and perhaps the world . I predict disaster if he is elected . I also predict he will either convert to Islam in office or perhaps found a new, hybrid religion . On the subject of Koresh, have you seen,&#8221; Waco, Rules of Engagement?&#8221; He did not believe himself to be God, he believed he was a New Testament prophet . The bottom line is, we have been lied to about Koresh .<br>
He certainly may have been no Saint, but neither is the FBI .I wouldn&rsquo;t know who to distrust the most .I also have a tape I purchased at a gunshow, filmed with some type of new infrared sensors . It purports that the FBI was indeed firing into the compound as it burned . It&rsquo;s convincing . To a large degree, our own government has turned on us . <br>

			<p>I&rsquo;m more worried about the scenario of a likely McCain win and the reaction of blacks.  President Bush needs to order a curfew in heavily black areas after the polls close on election day.  There also needs to be massive mobilization of law enforcement and even the military in chocolate cities.  </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s called FLIR (Foward Looking Infrared)and I saw the same documentary.  I have videos of the incident, but it was also played on cable television several times not too long ago.  Some of the best experts in the world verified unequivocally that the light flashes were coming from troops firing their weapons on fully automatic from the rear of the tanks, as infantry do, at the people fleeing the burning buildings and the CS gas.</p>
<p>Those that weren&rsquo;t machined gun down were run over by the tanks, proven by the photos of obviously tank-smashed victims.</p>
<p>If you will recall, the government disingenuously testified that it was the victims in the buildings that started the fires in a mass suicide, fully aware it was the highly flammable, and illegal, CS gas that ignited when it was shot into the dwellings, which contained lanterns.  It was when the women, children, and men attempted to flee the buildings that they were met with machine gun fire.  There is no better proof of government corruption than the Waco videos. </p>
<p>A free society has more protection against government criminals than any other, but a free society is not free of crime committed by government officials, as we found out after Watergate, and many incidents since then.  </p>
<p>American citizens are so engrossed in trying to survive on a day to day basis they become as sleeping watchmen on the wall, oftentimes allowing miscreants influence and control.  While many administrations are honest, obviously not all are, and the Clinton administration with Reno as AG, was one of the most corrupt.</p>
<p>As the FBI becomes more &#8220;diversified,&#8221; with non-whites who have proven high incidences of unethical conduct, look for the organization to further deteriorate. </p>
<p>And as the government continues to grow, look for even less concern for what the citizenry has to say about various matters, as is evident by how many in Congress are now disregarding 78% of the population&rsquo;s desire for curtailing immigration and not awarding amnesty to illegal aliens. </p>
<p>We fought a bloody revolution, because we had taxation without representation.  Politicians today do what they want or what their party wants, not what the people they are supposed to represent want.  They&rsquo;re ignored mostly.  Taking the attitude they do, Congress ignores the will of the people, and we again, once more, have taxation without representation. </p>
<p>And it will get worse.</p>

			<p>Atlanta and San Fran are 2 cities which thrived with black mayors. People here conveniently pick Detroit despite the fact that Detroit&rsquo;s problems have more to do with the decline of the auto-industry than anything else. <br>
As I see it, this is just a repeat of the Al Campanis style predictions which said blacks did not have the mental capacity to be major league managers. We now know how misguided those notions were.<br>
In any case, no one can possibly perform worse than Dubya has done over the past 8 years.</p>

			<p>Spike Lee is a good movie director, but he&rsquo;s completely wrong about the nature of the universe. Heaven forbid the President of the United States ever talk-down to a typical black person. The typical black person must be more influential than the president. More infallible than the Pope in the Vatican. Surely the stars themselves may fall on us.

			<p>Vince Taylor, your comment about good black mayors mentioned San Francisco. Willie Brown was mayor of San Francisco. He has just written an amusing book, very honest, about his life. He ran the city like the Daleys ran Chicago.  He made alliances with whites, and did not run the city as a &#8220;black&#8221; mayor. He is from the old school of New Deal Democrats. Like their policies or not, he did not play the race card, and worried about Willie Brown and his ability to govern with broad support. He is highly unusual for a black mayor. Willie was also Speaker of the California Assembly, and won with primarily white support including from farm and blue collar communities.</p>
<p>Obama might, might, be like Willie Brown, but I doubt it given his elitist outlook and rush to identify as an &#8220;African American&#8221; as seen by the stupid church he joined. Also, since Willie Brown&rsquo;s heyday, PC intellectuals, teachers and health care professionals have replaced workers as the backbone of thte party.</p>
<p> San Francisco doesn&rsquo;t have much of either a black or white working class, interested in good wages and safe neighborhoods. It is a mess of homos, Chinese, PC Liberals who think Roe V Wade is the most important issue we face along with multicultural education. SF now has an aduturous sleazy PC Liberal for Mayor who placates the sex-crazy rabble that are the majority of the once great city.  This libertine now wants to be Governor of California. If he promises to make Spanish the state language and provide every immigrant regardless of legality with state protection and a state job, he will probably win. Perhaps he&rsquo;ll propose that 20% of all teaching jobs be reserved for homos. (I&rsquo;m not PC, to me &#8220;gay&#8221; means happy, even if that nice word was stolen by perverts and their cheerleaders in the press and publishing industry).</p>
<p>So Willie Brown is a good guy. And obsolete. They don&rsquo;t make black politicians, or many white politicians either,  like him anymore.</p>

			<p>I truly wonder why any rational person would ever give any credence whatsoever to Spike Lee.  The question remains if Spike Lee would have ever received any recognition whatsoever if he were not black; and, the corollary, how much of Spike Lee&rsquo;s work was actually done by Spike Lee? Hollywood insiders tell a different story about the creation of the great Spike Lee movies.</p>
<p>Similarily, one would also have to wonder just who is actually running Senator Obama&rsquo;s campaign. Yes, I know that Senator Obama can act white, eat white, talk white, sleep white, and live white, while nominally remaining black; but, as in the case with Lee, how much of what we hear from Senator Obama is actually from Senator Obama. My guess is not much!</p>
<p>Senator Obama is a scrubbed, fluffed, sanitized, and perfumed African - American replete with his tiny Harvard Law Degree proudly displayed on his office wall, so he can legitimize the liberal whites&rsquo; need for moral superiority without subjecting them to a typical African American who acts like&hellip; well,  a typical African American. </p>
<p>Remember one can take the African out of the jungle but never the jungle out of the African. Senator Obama may fool the liberals all of the time, but he will never fool me any of the time!</p>

<p>Atlanta is a pesthole. San Francisco has only a small black population. As counter examples to the worldwide proliferation of black misrule (not only Detroit but virtually everywhere blacks yield considerable political influence) these are not terribly compelling. I notice you&rsquo;ve also stopped touting South Africa as a black success story. How come?</p>
<p>&#8220;In any case, no one can possibly perform worse than Dubya has done over the past 8 years.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Don&rsquo;t you think Obama&rsquo;s campaign cooked up this ridiculous controversy with &#8220;the Rev.&#8221; Jackson? (Obama&rsquo;s not sufficiently addressing black concerns?! What&rsquo;s left for him to promise them? To use the Army against whitey?! To&ldquo;equitably&#8221; redistribute white women?) They put Jesse up to this little tiff to make Obama seem less devoted to blacks and thus more palatable to whites. Obama&rsquo;s even trying to &#8220;sound&#8221; as white as possible to snow whitey.</p>
<p>No matter what, over 90% of blacks will vote for Obama. But he must somehow delude a sizeable share of whites. So Jackson is just helping Obama seem not quite a complete anti-white racist, and somewhat less than utterly devoted to blacks and other minorities. More psychological warfare is coming.</p>

			<p>PM, Your comments are very insightful and erudite, but referring to blacks, orwhite liberals  &mdash;  -but ESPECIALLY BLACKS  &mdash;  as &#8220;comrades&#8221; is annoying and just doesn&rsquo;t fit, even as derision. I have never been an afficiando of the communist party, but the term &#8220;comrade&#8221; does, or did, have a brotherly ring to it, suggesting a deliberate and thought out decision to hang together for a common goal putting aside personal wishes. Some Europeans and Asians actually did that. Blacks, African, American or otherwise, have never committed themselves to that European Christian-Jewish creation called Communism. With a few rare exceptions they never understood it as they never understood or cared about any idealogy.</p>

<p>Listen up:  As absurd as this quote sounds, <i>most blacks will believe this</i> by the time the election rolls around.  Everything Spike Lee is saying will be gospel in the black community by October; they&rsquo;ll expect Obama&rsquo;s election to be the most important event in the history of America, the new dawn of man, the black &#8220;Age of Aquarius&#8221;&hellip;  </p>

<p>Great post, Jill.  I heartily agree.</p>
<p>I just might add that it won&rsquo;t matter if the National Guard and the entire Army and Marine Corps are mobilized, because there&rsquo;s no way they could make more than a small difference in keeping millions of people from each other&rsquo;s throats.  Besides, if it comes to that, the military and police will have already chosen sides.</p>
<p>No government on earth in any nation on earth could ever halt the populace when they are hell bent on fighting each other.</p>
<p>The police, military, and the government are strong only so long as the people support them.  When that support goes, so does the country.</p>
