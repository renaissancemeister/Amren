<h1>Governor Deval Patrick: &#8220;Together We Can&#8221; Have Racial Preferences</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Matthew Richer, VDARE.com, July 30, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Those who wonder what to expect from a Barack Obama White House should start paying attention to Massachusetts <a href="http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=gov3utilities&amp;sid=Agov3&amp;U=Agov3_Deval_Patrick_welcome_msg">Governor Deval Patrick</a>, currently the nation&rsquo;s only elected black governor.</p>
<p>Governor Patrick and Senator Barack Obama have long been close friends and political allies. In fact, Obama was recently accused of plagiarism for <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Vote2008/story?id=4310143">excessively <b>&#8220;borrowing&#8221;</b></a> from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dboIpZ8ool8">speech Deval Patrick delivered</a> during the 2006 Massachusetts gubernatorial campaign. Obama even modeled his campaign motto <b>&#8220;Yes, We Can&#8221;</b> on the Patrick campaign&rsquo;s motto <b>&#8220;Together We Can&#8221;</b> although Patrick did not have a Spanish language version, as Obama does (<b>&#8221; Si, se puede&#8221;</b>).</p>
<p>Deval Patrick was born and raised in Chicago&rsquo;s South Side, near where Barack Obama now lives. In the eighth grade, he won a minority scholarship to prestigious Milton Academy in Massachusetts, and from there went on to Harvard University and Harvard Law School.</p>
<p>After law school, Patrick worked for the NAACP where he befriended then Governor Bill Clinton when the NAACP sued the state of Arkansas over an alleged voting rights violation. He then joined, and eventually became a partner, in the respected Boston law firm of Hill &amp; Barlow (famous for having represented Sacco &amp; Vanzetti ). In 1993, after Lani Guinier&rsquo;s nomination for Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights collapsed, President Clinton offered the position to Deval Patrick.</p>
<p><b>&#8220;You have had the best that American education can give you,&#8221;</b> said Senator Diane Feinstein to Deval Patrick during his confirmation hearings. <b>&#8220;You are articulate. You are handsome. You are young. You have the opportunity to provide a unique level of leadership.&#8221;</b></p>
<p>What was most strikingly unique about Assistant Attorney General Deval Patrick&rsquo;s leadership was the degree to which he used the power of his office to intimidate American citizens into conforming with his vision of civil rights. Patrick knew well that most cities, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=site%3Avdare.com+%20hazleton">towns,</a> and small businesses cannot afford to defend themselves against a Justice Department lawsuit. All it often took was for Patrick to initiate a Justice Department <b>&#8220;probe&#8221;</b> of some civil organization, and then he could bend it to his vision of justice.</p>
<p>During his confirmation hearings, of course, Deval Patrick claimed that he did not believe in racial quotas. But once confirmed, Patrick arrogantly began to impose racial preferences in the guise of law enforcement. He was especially opposed to cognitive examinations for prospective police officers and firemen alleging that they result in an unjustly high failure rate for black applicants. Patrick then tried to force municipalities to adopt a Justice Department-approved employment exam that amounted to a non-cognitive personality test (much of it administered by video). The exam was specifically designed to assure a high score among minority test takers. In fact, the vice president of the company that produced the test (<a href="http://www.aon.com/default.jsp">Aon Consulting, Inc</a>) described it as <b>&#8220;more than satisfactory if you assume a cop will never have to write a coherent sentence or interpret what someone else has written.&#8221;</b> [Testimony Of Linda S. Gottfredson, MAY 20, 1997]</p>
<p>The exam questions remain secret, except for two sample questions:</p>
<blockquote>When you were in high school, you were a member of a sports team.<br> A. Yes<br> B. No
<p>Which of the following statements is most like you &mdash; A or B?<br> A. I&rsquo;m always in a hurry at work to get things done.<br> B. At work, I think of myself as part of a smooth running machine.</blockquote></p>
<p>Some local governments capitulated and adopted some form of the exam. But a few fought back. The Justice Department&rsquo;s Civil Rights Division had to reimburse the city of Torrance, CA  $1.8 million in legal fees after suing them for alleged discriminatory hiring and losing.</p>
<p>Most troubling of all, however, was Deval Patrick&rsquo;s involvement with <i>Piscataway v. Taxman.</i> In 1989, the Piscataway, New Jersey Board of Education decided to lay off faculty due to declining enrollment. Their standard practice had been to lay off teachers with the least seniority, and if there were two teachers of equal seniority, to cast lots. However, in this case, there was a choice between a white teacher and a black teacher who had both been hired on the same day and worked in the same department. Rather than toss a coin, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/affirm/stories/aaop100596.htm">administrators fired the white teacher,</a> Sharon Taxman, and retained the black teacher for the sake of <a href="http://www.aclu.org/scotus/1997/22797lgl19970825.html"><b>&#8220;faculty diversity.&#8221;</b></a> Moreover, they sought to preserve not just the diversity of the overall school faculty, but of the individual department itself (business education). Ms. Taxman then sued and the Justice Department under President George H.W. Bush supported her claim. The courts <a href="http://www.adversity.net/Alito/pages/02_taxman.htm">eventually ruled in Taxman&rsquo;s favor</a> and ordered that she be rehired and paid $144,000 in back pay.</p>
<p>However, the Piscataway Board of Education appealed and when the <a href="http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=6320">Clinton Justice Department</a> inherited the case in 1994, Assistant Attorney General Deval Patrick ordered the Justice Department to reverse itself and take the side of the Piscataway Board of Education <i>against</i> Sharon Taxman. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals, however, was not impressed with this reversal and they terminated the Justice Department&rsquo;s role as a co-plaintiff in the case.</p>
<p>So fanatical was Deval Patrick in his desire to take Sharon Taxman&rsquo;s job that he forced the Justice Department to back a case that was a sure loser. In fact, the NAACP later had to persuade the Piscataway Board of Education to drop a proposed appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court because their likely defeat might have proven a death blow to affirmative action. The Rev. Jesse Jackson and the NAACP also quickly helped to raise a large settlement for Sharon Taxman.</p>
<p>The <i>Taxman</i> case is no doubt the reason Patrick&rsquo;s successor, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=site%3Avdare.com+%20Bill+Lann+Lee%2C">Bill Lann Lee,</a> had to settle for a recess appointment at the Justice Department after the Senate showed zero interest in confirming him. Indeed, Senator Orrin Hatch gave a speech on the Senate floor claiming that he could not support the nomination of another <b>&#8220;liberal civil rights ideologue&#8221;</b> like Deval Patrick. [<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/affirm/docs/hatch.htm">November 4, 1997</a>]</p>
<p>After leaving the Justice Department, Patrick returned to private practice in Boston and began making a <a href="http://olimu.com/WebJournalism/2001/Texts/RaceOnWallSt.htm">good living off discrimination lawsuits.</a> Indeed, the curious thing about Deval Patrick is his habit of suing an organization for discrimination, then parlaying the relationship into a coveted position with the same organization later on, just as he once worked on a lawsuit against Governor Bill Clinton, and then later acquired a federal appointment <a href="http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2008/04/01/deval_patrick_the_audacity_of_hype/">after Clinton became president.</a></p>
<p>For example, in 1997 Deval Patrick chaired the task force that administered the settlement of <a href="http://www.adversity.net/c14_tbd.htm">a $176 million racial discrimination lawsuit against Texaco</a>, then the largest ever settlement of its kind. While Patrick was still on the task force, however, Texaco&rsquo;s CEO offered him the position of vice-president and general counsel, with oversight over Texaco&rsquo;s hiring practices. As Assistant Attorney General, Patrick sued several alleged <b>&#8220;discriminatory lenders&#8221;</b> such as Fleet Bank and Ameriquest Mortgage &mdash; <b>&#8220;Loans should be based on risk, not race&#8221;</b> <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/1996/May96/211.cr.htm">said Patrick</a> at the time. But several years later he joined the board of directors of Ameriquest&rsquo;s parent company, ACC Capital Holdings, earning $360,000 a year for apparently little work. This, despite the fact that Ameriquest is alleged to be one of the most egregious <b>&#8220;predatory lenders&#8221;</b> in the country.</p>
<p>On immigration, Deval Patrick is about as open borders as any public official in the country. Patrick supports <a href="http://www.thesocialcontract.com/artman2/publish/tsc0604/article_565.shtml">multilingual voting ballots</a> (<b>&#8220;minority languages&#8221;</b> as he calls them), drivers licenses and in-state tuition for illegal aliens, and a state-wide sanctuary policy. His predecessor, Governor Mitt Romney, had initiated an agreement with the federal government to allow certain state troopers to determine if arrested criminal suspects are illegal aliens. But within days of taking office, Governor Patrick withdrew the state from the program.</p>
<p>In 1994, when the California Coalition for Immigration Reform (CCIR) was campaigning for Proposition 187, then Assistant Attorney General Deval Patrick sent the FBI to interview its leader, Barbara Coe, on the grounds that CCIR planned to engage in <b>&#8220;voter intimidation.&#8221;</b> The source of the allegation was a letter sent by the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund ( MALDEF ) to Patrick&rsquo;s office accusing Coe and CCIR of conspiring to violate the Voting Rights Act. The purported violation was a plan to hold signs near polling places that reminded people that it is a crime for non-citizens to vote.</p>
<p>In due course, then, and without warning, two FBI agents knocked on the front door of Mrs. Coe&rsquo;s home and grilled her on Proposition 187, her organizational tactics, and even asked if her children supported her positions. Coe was so appalled that she demanded that the agents leave her home.</p>
<p>In contrast, some Latino groups publicly threatened <a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_n22_v46/ai_15999871/print?tag=artBody;col1">actual violence</a> if Proposition 187 ever passed. (It did pass, but Gray Davis sabotaged it.) But Deval Patrick never investigated them for voter intimidation.</p>
<p>All of these facts were largely glossed over or buried when Deval Patrick ran for governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in 2006. Indeed, the local intelligentsia had placed enormous pressure on the voters to elect a black governor. The general attitude, as expressed in particular by the <a href="http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/magazine/articles/2008/01/13/the_mis_education_of_deval_patrick/">establishmentarian <i>Boston Globe</i></a>, was that electing Deval Patrick would allow the state, and the city of Boston in particular, to put a large part of its racist past behind it and give the region an opportunity to <b>&#8220;move forward.&#8221;</b></p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s no secret that the practice of racial guilt mongering is stronger in Massachusetts than in most places. Many claim it stems from Boston&rsquo;s forced busing imbroglio of the 1970s. However, the truth is the politics of racial guilt have long been a part of the academic and elitist culture of Massachusetts. It was actually more a cause, than a consequence, of the experiment in forced busing. Moreover, the Bay State liberals who indulge such racial paternalism do not feel guilty personally &mdash; they just like to remind themselves that others are not as open-minded as they.</p>
<p>In other words, Deval Patrick&rsquo;s job is not so much to govern, but to advertise the open-mindedness of his supporters. Perhaps that helps to explain why Governor Patrick has been largely manhandled by the Massachusetts political establishment, despite the fact that his party holds an enormous majority in the state legislature. His tenure in office has thus far been a series of embarrassing moments.</p>
<p>Deval Patrick, like Barack Obama, campaigned as a <b>&#8220;bridge builder&#8221;</b> who would put an end to <b>&#8220;politics as usual.&#8221;</b> The biggest problem with black elites, however, is that they tend to have an even stronger sense of entitlement than white elites. And if Deval Patrick has an Achilles heel, it is his enormous ego and sense of entitlement.</p>
<p>Unlike his predecessors, Governor Patrick chose to have not one, but seven inaugural receptions for himself across the Commonwealth. He then quickly upgraded the governor&rsquo;s state car from a Chrysler Crown Victoria to a much more expensive <a href="http://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;sourceid=deskbar&amp;q=%22cadillac+deval">Cadillac Deville</a> &mdash; earning him the moniker <b>&#8220;Deville Patrick&#8221;</b> from one local pundit. And when he tires of getting chauffeured around in his new Cadillac, Governor Patrick likes to use the state police helicopter to fly across tiny Massachusetts. In his first month in office, Patrick used the state police helicopter more than his predecessor did during the previous <i>four years</i>. (The state&rsquo;s last Democratic governor, Mike Dukakis, preferred to <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,967281-2,00.html">ride the subway to work</a> .)</p>
<p>Most embarrassing of all has been Deval Patrick&rsquo;s grand plan to reduce the commonwealth&rsquo;s billion dollar budget deficit: a proposal to have statewide <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2007/10/11/in_bill_patrick_controls_casino_panel/">casino gambling</a>. This very controversial proposal went virtually unmentioned during the campaign, and Governor Patrick was incapable of making any sensible case for it. Soon many citizens began to wonder how our <b>&#8220;bridge builder&#8221;</b> of a governor could have such a tin ear toward the electorate.</p>
<p>Certainly, no one was surprised when the Democratically-controlled legislature crushed Governor Patrick&rsquo;s casino proposal last spring. What surprised people was how indifferent he seemed to the defeat. Indeed, on the very day of the vote, Deval Patrick flew to Manhattan to negotiate a $1.35 million book deal for his life story. Even better, in his pitch letter, Patrick boasted of his enormous popularity, claiming that <b>&#8220;I was able to fill the Boston Common recently with ten thousand people eager to hear my dreams for the future.&#8221;</b> Patrick was actually referring to the moment last fall when 10,000 people showed up at <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2007/10/24/for_obama_support_from_a_kindred_political_spirit/">a Barack Obama campaign rally</a> and he introduced the senator to the assembled crowd.</p>
<p>However, Deval Patrick&rsquo;s latest proposal, the <b>&#8221; <a href="http://www.commonwealthcompact.umb.edu/">Commonwealth Compact,</a>&#8221;</b> is the one that should worry us the most. It was devised by Patrick and a group of local academics and business leaders and its stated mission is to <b>&#8220;establish Massachusetts as a uniquely inclusive, honest and supportive community of &mdash; and for &mdash; diverse people.&#8221;</b> The Compact requires employers to commit to a diverse workplace and to post online the race data of their current workforce and new hires. Employers are not actually forced to sign on, but who can doubt they will feel pressured to do so, especially if Governor Patrick requires state contractors to be signatories.</p>
<p>One obvious impact of such forced racial preferences is to accelerate the growing exodus of citizens from the state. Indeed, despite its rich history Massachusetts has long been among the country&rsquo;s worst in terms of retaining its residents. I call them <b>&#8220;Bay State Refugees&#8221;</b> (and I am certainly one of them). Some 2.2 million native-born Bay Staters now live elsewhere. And the commonwealth is attracting fewer transplants from other states.</p>
<p>The most oft-cited reason for this <b>&#8220;mass emigration&#8221;</b> is the state&rsquo;s high cost of living. But the media will never mention the fact that the state&rsquo;s increasing diversity has also driven many to abandon it for good. Some 200,000 immigrants have moved into the Boston area since 2000 alone, pushing the state population up to nearly 15% foreign born. Tellingly, perhaps the most popular destination for Bay State Refugees is New Hampshire, with its low taxes, low cost of living, and low diversity.</p>
<p>Deval Patrick has no plans to stick around either. Rumor has it that he is already eyeing a position in future President Barack Obama&rsquo;s Cabinet. Most likely, he is seeking to become the first black Attorney General in <a href="http://www.infoplease.com/spot/bhmfirsts.html">American history</a>.</p>
<p>So if you are wondering just what to expect from a Barack Obama White House, just contemplate having an arrogant, aggressive racial bean counter like Deval Patrick as the top law enforcement official in the country.<br>

			<p>  If this article was placed on the front page of every newspaper in America, I fear that it wouldn&rsquo;t do any good. The American people, dragooned into line by the mainstream news media, appear determined to hand Barack Obama the White House, come hell or high water. I hope I&rsquo;m wrong, and I may be, considering that he doesn&rsquo;t seem able to pull away from John McCain to any appreciable lead.</p>
<p>  But the above article&rsquo;s description of Patrick&rsquo;s background sounds distressingly familiar to what we already know about Obama. And to all those people who think he&rsquo;ll make a wonderful president, I would like to ask them: Name me one city (let alone a whole state or country) in the world that is run by blacks, and is not also ridden by crime, corruption, and anti-White violence. You can&rsquo;t   &mdash;   because there aren&rsquo;t any.</p>

			<p>This is pretty scary stuff.  It makes me wonder just how blatantly biased against white or other nonblack applicants can an employer be, all in the guise of &#8220;fairness.&#8221;  And just how unintelligent and lacking in writing or other critical skills can black applicants really be, and still end up getting hired for jobs that they&rsquo;re not qualified to hold?   I believe that every person, no matter their intelligence level or skill level, should ideally be able to make a very modest living in some type of job.  Perhaps America doesn&rsquo;t have enough jobs for those of low levels of intelligence, if these people are being funneled towards jobs that they&rsquo;re not suitable for.  </p>

			<p>Every motive, every single goal, every policy, every program, everything that a black proposes in or out of office in any position of leadership, is based in some kind of scheme to benefit blacks some way.</p>
<p>For example, if they want more teachers in the school or more money, it&rsquo;s not because they believe it&rsquo;s necessary for all students it&rsquo;s because blacks can&rsquo;t learn, and they naively believe that placing a teacher next to every little black moron will somehow enable him to understand things in spite of his inability to learn due to low I.Q. Everytime one thing fails, they insist another will work.  Their nonsense never ends.</p>
<p>It is only blacks they&rsquo;re thinking of, not the country as a whole, if they suggest something like a program that has to do with training unemployable workers.  What they really want is to get more blacks in the workforce, caring not one whit for anybody of another race.<br>
  <br>
If they oppose a war, it&rsquo;s not because they believe it isn&rsquo;t in the interests of the country, it is because they want to waste the money used for warfare on some other kind of scheme trying to elevate blacks somehow.</p>
<p>When blacks consistently fail on tests, they insist the tests are inaccurate.  When it isn&rsquo;t possible to complain about the inaccuracy of the test, they maintain it isn&rsquo;t necessary.</p>
<p>This Patrick is guilty more so than most blacks in his pursuit of advancing only those things he believes is beneficial to blacks.  The whites who voted for him and those who vote for Obama are complete and utter fools, so out of touch with the real world they are detriments to all of us, and it would be better to be rid of them than the blacks themselves.</p>
<p>This current downturn in the economy might turn out to be the best thing to ever happen for whites.  As the money dwindles, so too will the nonsensical extra benefits and programs for non-whites.  As the work gets more scarce, it is the lower jobs that will fall by the way, affecting mostly non-whites.  And as the bread gets scarce, the fights will accelerate between the various non-whites in the lower tiers. </p>
<p>How intense the conflicts will be is going to be determined by how much the economy plummets.</p>
<p>A severe economic drop will mean administrative and labor work forces will be cut to the bone.  Affirmative action appointees will have to go in most instances in favor of keeping only those who can make things work.  Government money allotted for social engineering will be drastically reduced.  </p>
<p>The 1.3 million aliens who left the country this last year will accelerate to a possible 10 million per year or very possibly more, causing a possible 10% drop in the overall population of the US over, say, about a three year period.  Such a huge<br>
demographc shift would mean a recalculation of all the races here, and it is very likely whites could again assume an over 75% of the population once more.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t scoff, my friends, every aforementioned incident is highly probable if the US economy drops drastically, as some are predicting. It is indeed a sad note that we have to suffer throught viciously hard economic times in order to get our country back, at least to some degree.</p>

We have seen the last presidential campaign that does not include (at least) one black candidate, and - if McCain succumbs to the pressure of his handlers to select Jindal as his running mate - we may well have seen the last all-White presidential ticket.

			<p>Very informative and scary article.  This gives a pretty good insight into the probable appointments Obama would make if elected.  Obama and Patrick obviously think alike when it comes to shaping up Whitey and taking care of the poor blacks. <br>
We are getting a peek into what Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;change&#8221; is all about. <br>
Patrick had no qualms about using his office in the Clinton Administration to intimidate the Prop. 187 leaders.  Can you imagine what he could do as Obama&rsquo;s AG?<br>
Thanks to the MSM, Obama has been flying under the radar on many very important issues.  What we do know about him is that he is a rank rookie with little or no experience to qualify him for the most important job in the world. Despite his lack of qualification, he is arrogant and presumptuous to a fault.  <br>
This guy is nothing but a snake oil salesman and we had better wake up and smell the coffee or we will rue the day if this guy gets elected.</p>

			<p>Unfortunately, virtually all &#8220;minority&#8221; politicians, elected, appointed, or just aspiring, have a strong tendency to &#8220;unite&#8221; with other minorities against white majority in the U.S.</p>
<p>I know that AmRen is dissiminating research results, well supported by scientific evidence, that blacks and Hispanics are less likely to succeed on their own than are whites in America. But to all veracity of these arguments, I believe the main message that they convey is just a distraction from the main problem.</p>
<p>And the main problem is that blacks and other minorities just wait for the right moment to join aliance against whites, and to use our benevolence and the system that we (the whites) created against us. <b>And it wouldn&rsquo;t make me feel any better about their attempts to deprive us of the fruits of our work and ingenuity if they were twice as intelligent as we are, period.</b></p>

			<p>What a team, Obama and Patrick.  Both are big on civil rights (for blacks) and have made speeches indicating that they favor reparations and all kinds of preferences to compensate blacks for the treatment their slave ancesstors received. But, I am sure the reparations will apply to all blacks in the country with or without slavery ancesstors.   <br>
However, what I am most confused about is Obama&rsquo;s qualifications to be president with the power to appoint people like Deval Patrick.  Obama is in his first term in the senate and has spent most of that campaigning for president.  He has done absolutely nothing to distinguish himself in that body.  In the campaign he has changed his position almost daily, which must be what he means when he talks about change  He keeps mentioning his time as a community organizer as if it is a qualifier for the world&rsquo;s biggest job.  His initial key supporters are Jeremiah Wright, Louie Farrakhan and Bill Ayers, the terrorist. He seems to be in the mold of Jesse and Al and his &#8220;platform&#8221; seems to be just to bash Bush.  He obviously has no real platform of his own, except to surrender to the terrorists and raise taxes./His other ideas are half-baked and completely unworkable and subject to constant change.<br>
This is NOT the guy we need in the White House and I hope this is made clear in the time remaining before the election.  </p>

<p>Only when their ideas are made public (instead of privately held beliefs and theories discussed behind closed doors) will middle America see how outlandish these people are. I want to see their demands as headlines in every newspaper and the top story on the evening news.</p>
<p>Let them demand Afro-Centric education, reparations, free money to anyone for anything. The more absurd the demands, the greater the chance whites will open their eyes.</p>

			<p>Over 30 years ago, Los Angeles elected a Black mayor, Tom Bradley.  At the time, Los Angeles was a mostly White city.  There was not, as far as I know, the sort of monkeyshines we have come to expect from Black politicians.  I think that was because Bradley was a tool of liberals, not an independent executive.  His handlers had other things on their agenda, and couldn&rsquo;t have their rubber stamp mayor gumming up the works by misbehaving.  I think that BHO has been brought in to play the same role as Mayor Bradley,  an inoffensive front man for leftist interests.  His weakness as an administrator and his lack of leadership ability will leave him dependent on White &#8220;advisors&#8221;, who will not allow him to jeopardize their plans for us.  He will take the salutes, enjoy the privileges, live rent-free for life, and do his masters&rsquo; bidding.  <br>

<p>The downside to this is that Bamanation will be able to appoint ALOT of judges, bad ones, worse than Klinton.</p>

I always enjoy reading your insightful comments but I disagree with you on the following:<br>
&#8220;A severe economic drop will mean administrative and labor work forces will be cut to the bone. Affirmative action appointees will have to go in most instances in favor of keeping only those who can make things work. Government money allotted for social engineering will be drastically reduced.&#8221;</p>
<p>1., a severe economic drop is not only likely but inevitable for the US in the next decade; this &#8220;drop&#8221; will make the Depression of the 1930&rsquo;s look like a mild recession.  You are right to mention it.</p>
<p>2. you are also correct in saying that such an economic decline will make some cuts in the federal/state/local government unavoidable,  Where I think you are wrong is in expecting affirmative action appointees to be affected.  We will more likely have a reduction in the size of government in some areas but not in all, e.g. not in the state&rsquo;s military/police establishments for these will be essential for any government to continue to exist in the disorder which will follow a major economic collapse such as the one that is coming.</p>
<p>  Our government and elites are not entirely rational, if they were, they would not have acted as they have, viz. in a manner which ensures a major crises which will put them at risk.  It is more likely that they will maintain the core of their ideology and sacrifice efficiency to continue to support blacks and other official &#8220;minorities&#8221;.</p>
<p>Recall that the so called Great Depression which was sparked by the Wall Street crash of 1929 did not result in the shrinkage of the size of government, but the exact opposite, viz. the dramatic growth of the size and power of the federal government with FDR and friends.  Also, during the Great Depression, which is regarded as a time when unemployment was nearly universal, the actual percentage of the working population which was unemployed was only some 33% (basically 1 in 3 working men was unemployed, leaving 2 in 3 employed).</p>
<p>  I suspect that in the coming economic crises there will be much more unemployment but it will be unlikely to effect the governmental sector or its favorites(the minorities).  American history can be read as a process of continuing growth of the central government in reaction to various &#8220;crises&#8221;, both real and imaginary.  Why should this process work any differently in the coming economic depression?  Why should the same elites that have been targeting the white working and middle classes in so very many different ways (affirmative action, inflationary monetary policy, etc) act any differently during a major economic crisis?  </p>
<p>I agree that the numbers of skilled whites who will be leaving the country will quickly mount (the current numbers are already significant) but I do not believe that the governmental elites will act rationally in this regard.  Their past record strongly indicates that they are very capable of acting irrationally.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve raised some good points in your assessment, but I might point out that 1/3 of the work force out of work in this day and age of contenious tribal mayhem is an astounding number, enough to turn the 1 million existing gang members into bona fide militias to which whites will likely respond to by re-forming instantaneously just as they did in the mid-nineties.  The elites regard an unemployment rate of 10% as one that foretells of dire consequences.  33-1/3% is panic time in a big way.</p>
<p>Too, during the last depression the country was overwhelmingly white.  I know I don&rsquo;t have to mention to anyone on this board that even during boom times we were having great difficulties with tribal clashes, but I just might suggest that it is this existing condition that will act as a springboard for greater violence, as most of the restless natives are just waiting to grab a piece of the pie by force.  The resentment and hatred they project is absolutely awesome.  The more we give them, the more they hate us and disrespect us for our weakness.  When they don&rsquo;t have jobs they&rsquo;ll hate us more.  It&rsquo;s my opinion that probably millions will return to their countries of origins.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suspect that in the coming economic crises there will be much more unemployment but it will be unlikely to effect the governmental sector or its favorites(the minorities). American history can be read as a process of continuing growth of the central government in reaction to various &ldquo;crises&rdquo;, both real and imaginary. Why should this process work any differently in the coming economic depression? </p>
<p>Because government cannot exist without taxes, and fewer people in the work force translates to fewer people spending money, contributing to sales taxes, plus all other taxes, and all the consequences that flow from that.  Right this minute we are reading about state governors who are making humiliating admissions that their budgets are being drastically cut, yet we are at the very beginning.  If it gets as worse as some claim, government will shrink drastically to just skeleton crews.  They might want more people on the job, but unless they can get them to work for free they won&rsquo;t be there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should the same elites that have been targeting the white working and middle classes in so very many different ways (affirmative action, inflationary monetary policy, etc) act any differently during a major economic crisis?&#8221; </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll have any choice.  Many white couch potatos will be up and around, paying strict attention to current events, and they will be exerting tremendous pressure on the politicos every time they learn of a hint of a minority being favored over a more qualified white to fill a position. </p>
<p>And it is almost a certainty they will experience non-white aggression against them and their families, as will the elites who are concerned more with survival than their careers, which won&rsquo;t look so promising anymore. Most of them don&rsquo;t really believe this diversity tripe forced on them anyway, and a good portion of those that do will be shocked out of their state of mind by stark reality. </p>
<p>Again, the conditions and climate now, as opposed to the first depression, are far more apt to send almost everything and everybody in violent disarray.  </p>
<p>When the banks foreclosed on properties in the last depression the only real violent opposition to it all was a few gutsy types who robbed them and burned mortgage papers.  Today the entire bank would be burnt to the ground and the employees hanged on the lamp post in front, which would be followed up with a phone call claiming credit for the incident by some group like the New Africa in the US Movement.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, if we endure a severe economic plummet that lasts a long while, I firmly believe there will be a great racial awakening for whites who will finally unify to some extent, and if the contentious masses provoke violence I think that unity will be much greater and that most whites will move forward under a single purpose that could very well result in a racial partition of this country.  </p>
<p>But at the very least I think white unity will be regained in any event, and that after the smoke clears, favoring political correctness or diversity could result in great bodily harm for the person(s) who is seeking to take up where the disgusting concept left off.</p>

<p>I completely agree with your statement that current conditions are far different from those which obtained during the Great Depression of the 1930&rsquo;s.  As you correctly point out, the racial composition of the country then was very, very different from that of today(we were a nearly completely white society in the 30&rsquo;s  &mdash;  in the preceding decade strict race based immigration reform had been passed, etc).  We were also a different people with different values who had not yet become dependent on the nanny state.  Our monetary system was still the gold standard.  We had no significant federal deficit or trade imbalance (unlike the current federal deficit of trillions of increasingly worthless dollars).  These and many other fundamental differences can be found when one compares contemporary America with that of the 30&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I believe that you are also right when you say that there is a much greater probability (near certainty) of massive violence in the coming financial crisis for many reasons, but particularly because of the large numbers of minorities, especially blacks, who vehemently hate whites.  Such hatred is sure to find expression through violence towards whites.  What I meant was that during the initial stages of the coming crisis the elites are likely to attempt to maintain or even enlarge the racial spoils system.  They will ultimately fail because whites will finally be forced to develop a sense of racial solidarity in the face of very real violence directed at them by minorities.  It will no longer be possible to be white and not racially conscious as such individuals will very quickly be eliminated in what will effectively be CWII.</p>
<p>Thus, I ultimately agree with you.  Our differences may well relate only to the initial stages of the coming crisis.  During that period (the duration of which may be very short) I believe that the elites will persist in their self destructive behavior(both in terms of growth of government and affirmative action).  Ultimately the collapse will sweep them away and with them will go their absurd ideologies of multiracialism, egalitarianism, and the rest of the intellectual rubbish.  The only real question is what the result of CWII will likely be, not if, but when it occurs.  I believe that whites will ultimately win and reconstruct a new, racially conscious and homogeneous culture and state.  Unfortunately, the price will be very high, but the price of not doing so will be much higher still.</p>

<p>We are in total agreement here Mr. Kelly along, no doubt, with other readers. I have many (legal) weapons and ammo and I do in fact believe that in the very near future, there will be roving bands of criminals (ala road warrior) who will be up to the usual looting, pillaging, raping and so forth. They will not all be black either as there are quite a number of white low lifes too. I saw men die in Viet-Nam because they could not pull a trigger and that may be the end result in the coming civil conflict if a man or woman cannot pull a trigger too. We cannot end up like the Rhodesian and SA whites. </p>

			<p>  I know I&rsquo;ve said this before on Amren, but I just can&rsquo;t help myself . When new technology began claiming our jobs with a big corporation in the South, we were given these aptitude test . I am sure many of you know the routine, no correct or incorrect answers, they cannot discuss the results with you except to tell you whether you passed or failed . Lo and behold I was the only one to fail ( many of my contemporaries, or more accurately, my competitors- were black ) I had a half dozen supervisors stop by to tell me I failed . I finally started protesting the results by saying,&#8221; if I failed then show me what I missed.&#8221; They would reply, &#8220;we can&rsquo;t do that.&#8221;To which I would reply, &#8221; then I do not believe I failed.&#8221;Finally the personnel manager(who was black but a very fair-minded person) came to me and said,&#8221;all I can tell is, that it is now being fought in the courts.&#8221; Which could have only meant that I did not fail, it was affirmative action . My point is that as soon as enough minorities assume enough key positions, whites start failing the test .The test are designed to allow them to literally decide who passes and fails .And unless you live in an area that has a large minority population, you will never, ever, even know what is going on . People in 80 to 95 % white states just do not have a clue . But the way demographics are changing they are going to find out .    </p>

			<p>It is only when the majority of whites begin to understand that the federal government is not only a parasite, but also their enemy, that they will begin to act in their own best interests instead of automatically saluting the flag and &#8220;doing their patriotic duty&#8221;.  Once we get to that point, the needed changes can occur.  Once the ground is prepared, the leaders will step forward.  I know you&rsquo;ve heard the cliché before, but it gets darkest before dawn.  </p>
