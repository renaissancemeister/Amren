						<p>Muslims in the Scottish district of Tayside are outraged by the appearance of a wide-eyed, 6-week-old puppy on postcards distributed by the local police force, according to the Daily Mail.</p>
<p>Postcards showing police dog-in-training Rebel, a German shepherd born in early December, are causing a furor among the region&rsquo;s Muslims who believe dogs are &#8220;ritually unclean,&#8221; the Daily Mail reports.</p>
<p>The cute cards {snip} have become a flashpoint for a clash of cultures. Shopkeepers are refusing to display the offending ad and a Dundee city councilor is calling for an investigation.</p>
<p>&#8220;My concern was that it&rsquo;s not welcomed by all communities, with the dog on the cards,&#8221; said Dundee councilor Mohammed Asif, according to the report.</p>

			<p>What is it with Muslims &amp; the anti-dog thing? Last week in the UK they demanded to be exempted from being sniffed at &amp; potentially brushed against by sniffer dogs [it&rsquo;s what sniffer dogs do, Mohammed, get over it] in airport line-ups etc., This week a publicity photo of a cute little black pup sitting on a policeman&rsquo;s hat sends them into fits of rage &amp; the police authorities in Tayside are taken to task by a Muslim councillor for being insensitive.</p>
<p>These folks have come a long way to be insulted [Pakistan to be precise] and are highly sensitives when it suits them, I don&rsquo;t hear no Muslim complaints about their sensitivities when kuffar heads roll after a kidnapping &amp; execution. But then I&rsquo;m forgetting, this behaviour is sanctioned by the Koran, the immutable word of Allah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be accused of being a tad insensitive myself here so I&rsquo;m trying to choose my language very carefully, but the point I wish to make is &hellip; if living in the kuffar world upsets you &hellip; then move to Dar-al-Islam right now &hellip; and purchase yourself a nice clean camel with no dirty habits &hellip; and whatever you do, don&rsquo;t call him Mohammed or Ali for the love of Mike &hellip; those Wackistanis will go ballistic &hellip; </p>

After being shocked at yesterday&rsquo;s story of 900,000 Australians fleeing Melbourne to escape the flood of immigrants, I read this story today. Scottish Muslims? With enough influence to shout down a postcard with a puppy on it? I had no idea.</p>
<p>This is genocide, a forced march of white culture into twighlight.</p>

			<p>Show us the links to articles that nearly a million whites are fleeing Melbourne.  I find this rather hard to believe.</p>
<p>You would think that Australia would be the bastion of white rule.  I don&rsquo;t understand any open border concept of a civilized nation and I am especially bewildered to why the Australian government would open its borders to Muslims especially after what happened in Bali.  This attitude is the most wrong approach since slavery.  I&rsquo;ve always hoped that slave merchants and traders are burning alive in hell.  Now, I&rsquo;m starting to wish the same to happen to officials allowing the corruption of Western civilization.</p>

			<p>Briton, I believe Michael Scott means that by definition if you are Muslim then you are not Scottish, not that there are no Muslims residing within the borders of Scotland. They don&rsquo;t share the religion, culture or blood of the Scottish people. It takes more to be Scottish than just because it says you are on a piece of paper or in a computer data bank. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the Duke of Wellington is purported to have said in response to his being born in Ireland, &ldquo;Being born in a stable does not make one a horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Being born or living in Scotland does not make these Muslims Scottish. </p>

			<p>The western world&rsquo;s appreciation for dogs and the love and loyalty they offer us is not shared by Islamic cultures. It takes an evil mindset to call these wonderful creatures offensive and unclean.</p>

			<p>  I suspect that there is a dearth of Muslims in the various British Humane societies. In Islamic culture dogs are considered unclean and disease spreaders. If you accept these Muslim immigrants under multiculturalism, you are required (by diversity liberals) to accept and even praise their customs and beliefs. Diversity is their strength. </p>

			<p>I really can not figure out the reason of muslims traveling to settle in Scotland. How are these migrations financed?<br>
But I can&rsquo;t afford to do so. I&rsquo;m suspicious, is this all just happening by chance?</p>
<p>I would love to visit Scotland, I&rsquo;m not Scottish but the language and culture (gaelic highlanders esp) is precious to me.<br>
The Scottish people have given the western culture so much from James Clerk Maxwell among others.</p>
<p>I would feel a deep loss if after surviving for millenia from assaults on their heritage the Scottish people are destroyed by an invasion of such clearly incompatible people as muslims seem to be.</p>

			<p>Here are possible tactics for making Britain as unappealing as possible to Muslim immigrants and thereby quelling the invasion:  </p>
<p>Realize that the preservation of your native born white population, the traditional Briton for thousands of years, is your first priority.  Be smart and do not offer the Muslims any more than they would offer you if you went to live in their countries.  For example, withdraw all tax-funded social services for non-white non-Christians.  Display signs of Christianity everywhere, such as crosses, Christian music, and the ringing of church bells four times a day.  Do not allow the wearing of the burqua until the day Saudi Arabia allows the wearing of short pants.  Do not allow the building of mosques until Saudi Arabia allows Christian churches.  </p>
<p>Every Englishman and woman needs a dog or two.  Teach all young women self-defense tactics and warn them that Muslims consider them impure infidels and may want to use or abuse them.  Have cute depictions of dogs and pigs as corporate logos, on postage stamps, as mascots for sports teams, etc. ad infinitum.  </p>
<p>Keep your homeland a safe haven for people of traditional British ancestry.  It is your land and there is no reason you to share it with strangers who want to remake Britain into a Muslim satellite country.  These are the stakes:  If you lose your country to non-whites and become endangered, where will you go by the millions?  Saudi Arabia?</p>
<p>As it stands, your guests are badgering you in your own home.   This is intolerable.  Send them packing!</p>

The British government settle many African and Middle Eastern refugees in Scotland (Glasgow especially). The socialist and liberal elite promote a multicultural Scotland by saying the only true Scottish are the picts, the rest are decendants of vikings and Irish.<br>
To Anglo-Protestant American<br>
I see what you mean but the Scots are to PC to say that! Scotland also has one of the lowest birth rates in the west so they have to be careful otherwise they will loose their ancient country.  </p>

			<p>Most dogs have an inherent dislike for blacks. </p>
<p>And the feelings are mutual. Blacks have a fear of dogs that would appear to most whites to be irrational.</p>
<p>Far fewer blacks own dogs. And look at how that millionaire football player treated his dogs? That wasn&rsquo;t an exception. Many blacks mistreat dogs on purpose because they think it will make a better guard dog if it is vicious.</p>
<p>Which only points to the stupidity of the owner if they do that&hellip;</p>
<p>Most middle easterners to me appear to be a mix of Caucasian and black. So maybe this is where their dislike of dogs comes from?</p>
<p>And maybe all those thousands of years of dog breeding in the British Isles programmed in an inherent preference for whites among dogs?<br>

			<p>Firstly, the reason that this particular dog was used is because it<br>
was bred to be a police dog, though still a puppy, it is now being trained by going out on patrol with  its trainer and it is hugely<br>
successful and extremely popular with NORMAL people. The only thing that stinks about this story is that the cowardly wimpy police chief apologized for not running it past his &#8220;diversity&#8221; expert. I am still waiting for the experts opinion on the recent police statement that the British flag is racist and the statement that<br>
Christianity could not be preached in certain areas.<br>

			<p>Why do Scottish women (among the world&rsquo;s most lovely, I might add) have a need to marry these awful Muslims and then, to top it off, convert to their vile religion?  Is it that Scottish men can&rsquo;t satisfy them?  What&rsquo;s going on?  The Scots are perhaps the preeminent of all nations in warfare.  And I don&rsquo;t have to see &#8220;Braveheart&#8221; or &#8220;Rob Roy&#8221; on TV to realize that.  To be a Scot is to be masculine.  Are Scots women suddenly stupid?   </p>
<p>Scots women   &mdash;   do not marry or even have sex with a Muslim.  Look to your own people.  As Sean Connery puts it:  &#8220;Scotland forever!&#8221;  No Muslim can legitimately make that claim.</p>

<p>Be greatful there are not a lot of dogs in the Mideast. It&rsquo;s pretty hot there. The US military should be ashamed of having bomb sniffers there outside of Dec - March.</p>
<p>Jehovah&rsquo;s witnesses came to our house on a saturday a few weeks ago. They brought with them a witness they said was from Africa. He was pretty scared of the family dog when he was let out. Perhaps fear isn&rsquo;t the word, but he held up both hands in front of him backing up saying &#8216;no&rsquo; or something. He just didn&rsquo;t want to be injured, which he thought was a good possiblity judging by the dogs demeanor. I gather there aren&rsquo;t too many dogs from where ever he was from in Africa. There&rsquo;s a good chance whatever they have is quite frightening. <br>

<p>Good point.  What really astonishes me is Muslims crying about dogs being unclean when most of them come from countries where no one uses toilet paper!  Apparently they clean by swishing water out of a communal water container with their bare hand.  Can you imagine how filthy that water vessel gets?  And I&rsquo;m not even going to speculate about their hand.  <i>Yuck!</i>  </p>
<p>In spite of their constant whining about avoiding the &#8220;unclean&#8221;, no one has ever come up with the phrase, &#8220;as clean as a Muslim&#8221;.  I think I know why&hellip;</p>

			<p>Dan D,</p>
<p>The mass immigration being forced on every Western white nation is most definitely by design. In Europe it is designed by the &#8216;ex-Marxists&rsquo; in charge of the EU to destroy these nations by miscgenation &amp; the prolific breeding habits of the immigrant third-worlders, making it easier to facilitate integration into the emerging enlarge EUSSR superstate which will include Muslim Turkey &amp; North Africa &amp; leave the European countries mere regions instead of independent nation-states. Yes, multiculturalism, as every good general knows, is the best way to destroy a nation.</p>
<p>The USSR Mark I which collapsed on itself was the NWO/Marxist&rsquo;s first attempt at one-world-government &amp; the new European superstate will be EU[SSR] Mark II. As I have said before on this site, &amp; I think it bears repeating, the Communist state may have passed away but the European Marxists have simply morphed into their various front groups, as these creatures of the night always do, such as Fabians/Socialists/Greens/Labour &amp; dozens of other Marxist organisations &amp; parties.<br>
Don&rsquo;t take my word for it, there is enough evidence on the web to confirm it a hundred times over. And here are a just a few &#8216;ex-Marxists&rsquo; off the top of my head, that hover at the top or near the top of the EU greasy pole. There are many, many more. </p>
<p>Daniel Cohen-Bendit, Germany, now a &lsquo;respectable&rsquo; German Green MEP &amp; leader of the Green grouping in the Euro Parliament. Anyone who can remember the 60&rsquo;s will  remember him as the Marxist student leader &lsquo;Danny the Red&rsquo; who spawned a thousand imitators &amp; helped unleash the student riots in Paris in 1968. As is now well-known, Green is the new Red. No need to ask if the Red favours Turkey in an enlarged EU superstate.</p>
<p>Angela Merkel. Germany, Chancellor, ex-East German politician</p>
<p>Javier Solano, ex-Marxist, ex-EU Commissioner President, Spain</p>
<p>Hillary Benn, UK, Fabian Socialist [Marxism in slow motion]</p>
<p>Charles Clarke, MP, ex-Marxist, ex Cabinet Minister, UK</p>
<p>John Reid, MP, ex-Marxist, ex-Cabinet Minister, UK</p>
<p>Jack Straw, UK, ex-Marxist, Cabinet Minister,<br>
 <br>
David Miliband UK Foreign Secrertary, potential future PM, brother Andrew, Junior Cabinet Minister, third-generation closet Marxists, sons of LSE Marxist lecturers, Adolphe [Ralph] &amp; Margaret Miliband. The Milibands are a family extraordinaire of nation-wreckers, google grandfather Samuel Miliband, a Polish Jew &amp; Marxist who left Warsaw &amp; joined the invading Red Army in 1920.</p>
<p>This is just a few to start you off. Don&rsquo;t forget these NWO types are implementing the exact same scenario for Canada, USA &amp; Mexico.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Postcards showing police dog-in-training Rebel, a German shepherd born in early December, are causing a furor among the region&rsquo;s Muslims who believe dogs are &ldquo;ritually unclean&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Even man&rsquo;s best friend is feared and despised by the Muslim culture. </p>
<p>The problem here, of course, is not dogs, but instead a mentally unclean, sociopathic and homicidally superstitous religion.</p>

			<p>Muslims are less than 1% of the population in Scotland and most Scots despise them. The outspoken big mouths amongst them don&rsquo;t realise the risk they&rsquo;re taking by stoking resentment against themselves, living in small numbers amongst maybe the most aggressive tribalist people of North-western Europe.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I hope the Scots have more backbone then the English and tell them where to get off. By the way there is no such thing as &ldquo;Scottish muslims&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The Scots are ruled from London and are not allowed to make laws that &#8216;discriminate&rsquo; against the non-white immigrants the Elite rulers of the UK love. In Scotland, it is legal to discriminate against Scottish culture and its adherents but not agaisnt foreign cultures what hate Scottish culture.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;&hellip;Muslims who believe dogs are &ldquo;ritually unclean,&rdquo; the Daily Mail reports.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have seen photographs of acts committed by muslims that can only be described as the most vile and dirtiest acts of what I will loosely call humans, committed upon other human beings. The photographs were of severed human heads with their chopped-off genitalia stuffed in their mouths. My question is: Was the genitalia chopped off before the heads were chopped off or vice versa. You don&rsquo;t get any more despicable or dirty than this.<br>

			<p>&#8220;Why do Scottish women (among the world&rsquo;s most lovely, I might add) have a need to marry these awful Muslims and then, to top it off, convert to their vile religion? Is it that Scottish men can&rsquo;t satisfy them? What&rsquo;s going on? The Scots are perhaps the preeminent of all nations in warfare. And I don&rsquo;t have to see &ldquo;Braveheart&rdquo; or &ldquo;Rob Roy&rdquo; on TV to realize that. To be a Scot is to be masculine. Are Scots women suddenly stupid?&#8221;</p>
<p>Most Scots women or americnan ones for that matter, do not marry muslims. However, yes there are stupid women(and men) that do. </p>

			<p>Hmmm.  Makes me wonder if B. Hussein Obama is going to break with presidential tradition and skip the &#8221;White House dog&#8221; routine.  I somewhat remember seeing an interview with he and his wife.  She seemed insistent on getting the girls a dog, but he sure came across as less than enthused.  Of course his excuse for not wanting a dog was that he didn&rsquo;t think his daughters were responsible enough to take care of it and that the duties would therefore fall onto him.  Now that we see the low opinion Muslims have for man&rsquo;s best friend, B. Hussein&rsquo;s decision to not allow his daughters a dog makes more sense.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the Scottish Nationalist Party [SNP] who govern the devolved Scottish Parliament are an even bigger bunch of liberal multi-culti wimps than the lib/lab/con Westmister politicians &amp; are not a &#8216;nationalist&rsquo; party in any meaningful sense of the word. Their policy is to dance to the EU tune by implementing EU multicultural/diversity policies like large-scale immigration from third-world countries. The devolved Scottish Parliament actually asked the UK government to send up from England third-world immigrants that English local authorities were having problems absorbing because of their numbers &amp; their Scottish counterparts are receiving funding from Westminster for absorbing these immigrants. The SNP plan seems to be to &#8216;sneak into the EU as a nation separate from the UK&rsquo; but it will not be as an independent nation-state but as a region of the future enlarged EU superstate because nation-states are being covertly abolished step-by-step &amp; their populations altered irrevocably by third-world mass immigration. The SNP are fooling themselves but their EU masters will most certainly grant them their wish in order to make the break-up of the United Kingdom into EU regions easier to accomplish. A plague on both their Houses.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m one of those Scottish Patriots (though American by birth) who has been aware for many years that his Celtic homeland was going to the dogs (I can&rsquo;t believe I said that..no offense to the dogs), even if then at a slower pace than the USA. The pace has quickened.  How far are Scotland and Ireland from England in going totally down the tubes?  With such nonsense going on in Scotland, I won&rsquo;t have any place of refuge left.  What happened to the spirit of the Scots who fought for Wallace and Bruce? </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m wondering myself about the dog hate thing. The Amir of Kuwait has several huge dogs that run free inside his beach front palace in Kuwait City, and a person walking along a road anywhere in Iraq, kuwait and Jordan will be assaulted, barked at and chased by household dogs. CATS!! there are more cats wandering around over here than I saw on the island of Rhodes, Greece (anyone been there knows what I mean)But the dog thing is just another thing used at the convenience of the Muslims. If they don&rsquo;t yield to dog sniffing at airports!! there are return flights to wherever it is that they just came from.</p>

			<p>Does this mean they would accept a Japanese First Lady and declare war on England?</p>
<p>We got as far south as Derby the last time.  I would promise to use less than 20 nukes on England and the rest of Europe.  Perhaps 600 at sea, more if the US intervened.  A nuke strike on a carrier group with ICBM reentry vehicles would be interesting.  Sea strikes do not leave craters.</p>

			<p>Michael C. Scott is exactly right.  As I have noted repeatedly, other than perhaps a tiny handful of eccentrics and malcontents who have converted, there is no such thing as a Scottish Muslim.  There are only Muslims who have been foolishly given permission to reside in Scotland.</p>

<p>It seems to me that though there is an unacceptable consideration for muslim sensitivities by the native state, the media saying that the ad has sparked anger in the muslim community is untrue.</p>

			<p>Having thought some, I think what I posted earlier may be misunderstood. If it did not seem so, what I meant is that it does not seem to me that the muslims were &#8220;outraged&#8221; about the ad. I think the article I posted is fairly wishy-washy, but having read along with it several variations of the original article, I can see how the recommendations of an advisor could be arranged to contrive an image of &#8220;outraged&#8221; muslims   &mdash;   &#8220;outraged&#8221; suggesting a certain degree of anger, a super-angry, spittle-flying, on-the-streets-making-a-ruckus type anger, that just didn&rsquo;t seem to be present. It seems, instead, that some muslims simply did not use the card, and that the native state, being a multiculturist wimp, showed the usual unacceptable consideration for forien culture by apologizing.</p>

			<p><i>The devolved Scottish Parliament actually asked the UK government to send up from England third-world immigrants that English local authorities were having problems absorbing &hellip;.<br>
 <br>
The SNP plan seems to be to  &lsquo;sneak into the EU as a nation separate from the UK&rsquo;  but it will not be as an independent nation-state but as a region of the future enlarged EU superstate because nation-states are being covertly abolished step-by-step &amp; their populations altered irrevocably by third-world mass immigration. </i><br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.<br>
An incredible story!   (But I believe you.)  The British (at least the political class) seem to have truly gone mad.</p>
<p>By the time the Scots &#8220;sneak into the EU as a nation&#8221;, they will no longer be a nation but a racial/cultural mishmash of everything and nothing.  </p>
<p>It has always been my strong belief that the British Isles  (<i>ALL</i> of them!) should all hang together, or they will all hang separately.  Only when they were politically as one were they together a significant power in the world. There may not have been an equitable distribution of power,admittedly, but that problem could have been corrected WITHIN the British union, rather than shattering it.  Separately, they are just little island states in a great, big world that will overwhelm them (and is currently doing so).  The destruction of the British Empire was the second item on the Marxist agenda (after the  separation of Ireland), and those goals being now achieved, next comes the dismemberment of the UK  and the abolition of England (&hellip;and ultimately of Scotland and Ireland too, make no mistake of it). </p>
<p>While the more zealous nationalists of each may rejoice at witnessing the destruction of the other, they don&rsquo;t see their own impending doom looming right around the corner.</p>
<p>How pathetic.</p>
