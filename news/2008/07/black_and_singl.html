						<p>Mrs. Allen had it all.</p>
<p>A career she enjoyed, a nice home, two adorable children and a husband. She shared her tools for success with me at an early age. She went to college, got married and waited until she was 26 to have her first child.</p>
<p>The perfect life. The perfect plan. It was one I decided to model.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And there are millions more like me. Forty-five percent of black women in America have never been married, compared with 23 percent of white women, according to the U.S. Census Bureau&rsquo;s American Community Survey in 2006. {snip}</p>
<p>The difference between Mrs. Allen and me: She was white.</p>
<p>The numbers, undeniably, are not in my favor. But they have never been. Born black, raised in a single-parent home and primarily educated in low-performing public schools, I am not supposed to be a success story. But giving weight to statistics in my personal life only contributes to a culture of fear surrounding marriage.</p>
<p>This fear causes some women to make hasty decisions like staying in unfulfilling relationships that lead to unsuccessful marriages, which end in divorce (another dismal statistic). Or just the opposite: Women become so fearful of making the wrong choice, they find themselves surrounded by a moat with no bridge to their final destination: marriage.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Why are you still single? I hate that question. {snip}</p>
<p>One reason: personal responsibility. Among the men I have dated, there were definitely some who were ready for something a little more significant than I was willing to give. Did I drag my feet because I wasn&rsquo;t ready? Or was it because those men weren&rsquo;t right for me? It&rsquo;s debatable and probably a combination of the two.</p>
<p>Mrs. Allen was white, but she was also part of a generation of people, like my parents, who married at an earlier age. Today, black women outnumber black men almost 2-to-1 in higher education. But white women are also surpassing white men in college enrollment and completion, according to the National Center on Education Statistics.</p>
<p>What is a rooted example in the black community is also sprouting legs among America&rsquo;s other racial groups. I am part of a generation of Americans who are choosing to postpone marriage while they pursue their careers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On a macro level, the horizon is grim, but my personal experience reflects stories of black women and men who are married or very seriously considering it. Social and economic conditions are very strong influences, but so is the desire for love.</p>
<p>If I remain in my current statistical category, a single black woman, it will be because I missed someone while gazing at the ancient obelisks of Egypt&rsquo;s Karnak Temple, partying with expats in Hong Kong or simply spending time with family and friends in America.</p>

			<p>She says she may be single because men in her life were ready for something more significant.  In reality, she is an educated well to do women who can&rsquo;t find a black man as competent as her. </p>

<p>I find that hard to believe. Every black woman I know is in a relationship with another married black man, or she is married, and her husband is carrying on a parallel relationship with at least 1 other woman. Sometimes the women know each other and are on terms, sometimes they just know of it and only know the the other womans name. Afraid of making the wrong choice? Well, maybe this is something they don&rsquo;t consider to be a wrong choice.</p>

Yeah, I hate that question too. I don&rsquo;t mind being single (yet), but it&rsquo;s a little scary to be 27, not all that bad looking, and still just &#8220;hanging out&#8221; with guys. Fortunately I have a lot of girlfriends to help supply social interaction. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong I love my fellow Amreners, but I&rsquo;ll probably never meet a-one of you!</p>

			<p>Yes, this is a subject not presenting much anywhere.</p>
<p>The reality is that college educated Black women have lower marriage and birth rates than almost anyone including, if this can be possible - (over) College and Graduate School educated White American women.</p>
<p>Seems that Western liberal education is the great birth control, anti sex force in human history.</p>
<p>What man wants to be with an American college educated woman? Talk about no fun, bitter, hostile women.</p>
<p>Well, all is fair in love and war and with the West losing big time to the Muslim hordes, maybe we should find a way to get most Muslim women to &#8220;submit&#8221; to American, Western style (brainwashing) feminist college education - the Muslim birth rate will then go down to zero.</p>
<p>I bet Muslim men would prefer if we just used Nukes or mustard gas against them over turning their women into Hillary style feminists.<br/>

			<p>What a bunch of malarkey. The reason so many blacks don&rsquo;t get married is they&rsquo;re not up to marriage. Marriage is a very difficult lifestle and we know blacks don&rsquo;t do difficult. They just go through life as if it&rsquo;s always summertime and the living is easy. Nothing easy about marriage.</p>

			<p>there is a socioeconomic factor in my opinion. I have owned investment properties for 20+ years. a marriage/relationship among lower class whites is usually a precursor to misery for all involved.</p>

			<p>This is not by choice. A very large number of black women can not get married because they can&rsquo;t find enough black men to marry them, and they can&rsquo;t find non black men to marry them either. It&rsquo;s the same situation with Asian american men, so many of asian american women are marrying non-asian american men, there aren&rsquo;t enough asian american women for asian american men to marry, and we can&rsquo;t find many non-asian women to marry. This is why you see such a high number of single black women and asian american men in this country, unfortunately, there is no attraction or much interaction between the two groups&hellip;.. The dating and reproduction game in this country is very tough. It&rsquo;s a dream come true game for black and other dark skin males, because women perfer stronger and bigger dark skin men who takes higher risks. It&rsquo;s a tough dating game for conservative and weaker white males, and toughest for black women and asian men&hellip; </p>

<p> Really funny, sense it makes almost no sense at all.</p>
<p>Well, you want to be extra careful of the choices you make, because with so many black males in the slammer you could well be celebrating your anniversaries in the visitors section.</p>
<p>Too, consider the ones who are unavailable because they&rsquo;re chasing white women who are MUCH more attractive than black ones.</p>
<p>The world has not been kind to black women.</p>

			<p>Man From the East, part of the problem is that non-Asian males tend to be taller than Asian males.  Not putting you down, just stating a fact.  Even really tiny women like guys who are 6 feet and taller.  </p>
<p>And as a white woman who is 6&rsquo;1&#8221;, I can say that (when I was still attempting to date) I had a similar problem but from the opposite direction&hellip; many men, even the big ones, didn&rsquo;t want to date a woman my size&hellip; and I did used to be slim and fairly decent-looking as a young woman (I&rsquo;m almost 55).</p>
<p>Also, in high school, some guys would stop flirting if they knew I&rsquo;d made the honor roll.  I guess a lot of guys like their women dumber.  </p>
<p>I know of a few Asian men married to white women&hellip; that might be an option if you find a white woman who is willing to date inter-racially. </p>
<p>Answers?  I don&rsquo;t have any for you.  Yeah, the dating game in this country *is* tough, no doubt about it.  Good luck.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Is Marriage Really for White People?&#8221;</p>
<p>When a civilization reaches the level of a certain maturity and sophistication, animal instincts become more suppressed and a more noble nature emerges among the people. Their actions on many things becomes more and more evident of that. From a behavior standpoint, this includes respect for others, the care and concern of others, modesty, and personal sacrifice. It flows into other areas of behavior, actions, and inventiveness like the type of dance, i.e.) Waltzes; the type of music, i.e.) Classical; the type of entertainment, i.e.) Ballet and Opera; the type of writers, i.e.) Shakespeare. Ultimately and ideally, civilization transforms the chaotic and spontaneous into pleasantries and structure, continuously framing the mind for higher and higher pursuits. Marriage thrives in these types of cultures.</p>
<p>When a civilization has yet to reach the level of a certain maturity and sophistication, animal instincts overwhelm restraint. Their actions on many things becomes more and more evident of that. From a behavior standpoint, this includes lack of respect for others, selfishness, braggadocio, and sacrificing others to your own petty whims. It flows into other areas of behavior, actions, and inventiveness like the type of dance, i.e.) Bump&rsquo;n Grind; the type of music, i.e.) Gangsta Rap; the type of entertainment, i.e.) Dog fighting; the type of authors, i.e.) Michael Eric Dyson. Ultimately and ideally, civilization has yet to transform from the chaotic and spontaneous into pleasantries and structure, continuously framing the mind for pursuits based upon pure instinct instead of contemplative restraint. Marriage is an alien concept in these types of cultures.</p>

			<p>Man from the East (this is the tall woman again):  It&rsquo;s not just Asian men who find dating and mating tough in this country.  </p>
<p>I have several short male friends, and they all have the same problem.  They have a tough getting dates even with short women.  Some of these short guys, for some reason, really like us Amazons.  And many of them are really nice men. </p>
<p>Sorry all you Asians and other short men are having such a hard time getting dates and mates.  I wish it were different. </p>

<p>Are you an Asian male?  Yes for some reason there are many white men who dig Asian women, even if she happens to be a less than attractive one.  </p>
<p>I heard, that &#8220;there are not enough women to choose from&#8221; is an excuse.  It is not my opinion.  If the Asian man or the black woman knows what he is doing, he or she can literally choose from eligible bachelors and ladies.  </p>

			<p>Marriage and monogamy aren&rsquo;t really black male strongpoints. I used to work with a whole bunch of black guys. They were all married or more like married/common-law relationship. They all had about three, four five or even six other black women &#8216;on the side&rsquo; as they liked to call it. The women were ALWAYS calling at work to talk to them. Didn&rsquo;t they ever wonder WHY the guy never gave them his home address phone number?</p>

			<p>Whenever I see a black woman dating a white man (Which is not too common here in flyover country), she usually has her act together. Clothes, hair, nails, shoes, etc. are perfect and she carries herself in a dignified manner. Smart black women tend to outnumber the men and my guess as to why she is dating Mr. Whitey pretty much boils down to utter frustration with black men who are lazy and irresponsible. These women at least have a clue that Mr. Whitey is not responsible for the utter breakdown going on around them. </p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s a few stats that were overlooked by the author, black unmarried fems average @ 3 illegitimate kids, they are receiving a variety of gov. subsidies, they have been, are presently, or will become addicted to an illegal drug, they  have less education than white, asian, or other fems their age, and there&rsquo;s still people wondering why they can&rsquo;t get a husband.</p>

			<p>Seems a lot of black males resist the idea of growing up. The thugged-out hip hop images they embrace as teens are something they often carry with them well into adulthood. Many black females are attracted to those types, especially when they are  young. But when they reach an age where they want to settle down, they have to own up to the fact that these types of males hardly make ideal marriage partners. A 30ish male decked out in baggy clothes, who fancies himself as a player, is neither employable or marriage material. This is even more true, for a black woman with a higher education. However, there are also many black females, who start having kid&rsquo;s young, and out of wedlock, and sometimes make a habit of it. Those types, wind up married to the government, and have a snowballs chance, of finding a man willing to support a brood of kid&rsquo;s that aren&rsquo;t his.</p>

<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s because when they reach the age where they want to settle down they are around 17 years old.</p>

			<p>Marriage has been largely discredited for males of any race.  There is nothing in it for men.  We can get sex without marriage.  And if I get married and she decides, for any reason whatsoever, to leave, I lose half my stuff and end up paying child support and alimony.  No thank you. </p>

<p>It seems like you are confirming what several other posters on this board have been saying, usually when you see a Black woman/White man couple, they tend to be upscale, attractive and sophisitcated.</p>
<p>In my experiences, (I live in the northeast), I would say that this is the case.</p>

			<p>I would not have agreed wtih some of you like Howard W. Campbell making these comments several years ago. But now, I do have to admit that I have seen some very attractive, sophistcated Black women with equally handsome, sophisitcaated Black men. </p>
<p>I live in a cosmopolitan area and many of these couples are indeed quite attractive.</p>

<p>Look closer.  When you see a black/white relationship and then take a second look, you will almost always find that the &#8220;white&#8221; partner is, in fact, jewish.  They race mix, FAR more than white people do. </p>

			<p>Cathy, I don&rsquo;t know where you get your info but I see many asian/white couples in my city and I am amazed at the type of men who go for average looking asian woman. Usually the guys I would think would go for the blonde bombshell types puzzlingly are squiring around some petite little asian girl.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember seeing many black male/northeast asian female or white male/black female or ne asian male/black female combo very much. The se asians I&rsquo;ve seen with some blacks and some whites. </p>
<p>Most asian female/white male that I&rsquo;ve talked to have been high income professional couples. I don&rsquo;t see that many emasculated white males with asians, in fact the opposite. One very successful young white man in finance told me that he was very lucky to have met and married his high powered, well educated, and attractive asian wife. He says in his circle it is a sign of prestige to marry someone like this but not if you marry some low class asian or se asian. </p>
<p>The black female w/white male seemed to be less ghetto from what I could tell, but still had those ghetto criminal relatives.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Man From the East, part of the problem is that non-Asian males tend to be taller than Asian males. Not putting you down, just stating a fact. Even really tiny women like guys who are 6 feet and taller. </p>
<p>And as a white woman who is 6&rsquo;1&rdquo;, I can say that (when I was still attempting to date) I had a similar problem but from the opposite direction… many men, even the big ones, didn&rsquo;t want to date a woman my size… and I did used to be slim and fairly decent-looking as a young woman (I&rsquo;m almost 55).</p>
<p>Also, in high school, some guys would stop flirting if they knew I&rsquo;d made the honor roll. I guess a lot of guys like their women dumber. </p>
<p>I know of a few Asian men married to white women… that might be an option if you find a white woman who is willing to date inter-racially. </p>
<p>Answers? I don&rsquo;t have any for you. Yeah, the dating game in this country *is* tough, no doubt about it. Good luck.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well ma&rsquo;am, I wouldn&rsquo;t have any trouble dating a girl who is my height and made the honour roll.  I am your height and I am Korean.  I was not in honour roll.  I always received very low marks for English.  I came to Canada when I was fourteen and I had to work really hard to improve my language skills but still was never able to be where I wanted to be.  Still not there to this day.  I did write a few math contests, and I did do well enough to receive a letter who recognized and congratulated me for my result and receive invitation to write another math contest.  I was a qualified tutor to teach math to kids of younger grades.  (Guess what, being good at math certainly helps in the dating world! girls come to you for help with their math.  Being skilled in computers also helps, believe it or not!!) </p>
<p>I am not angry but, I started to conclude that about 15% of all AmRen threads and posts are regarding the fact that &#8220;Asian men can&rsquo;t get women&#8221;</p>
<p>I am not angry.  I started to be amused rather!!</p>
<p>And regarding &#8220;boys like their girls dumb&#8221; maybe some boys like girls with equal intelligence to their own!! and dumber, simpler girls are easier to manipulate, and the boys are afraid that the smart girl might be disappointed to find out his lower intelligence.  I once read that boys do not ask out some of the most beautiful girls because the boys are afraid of being rejected.  </p>

<p>Having seen the African American section on Topix, I know that many black women often claim, that white women who are married to white men, tend to be unattractive and overweight, while Black women are all &#8216;dimes&rsquo; and very beautiful. I have also noticed that many white women who are married to black men, tend to be less attractive than white women with white men. But since so few married black women, and an even smaller number of them who marry whites,  I just can&rsquo;t say whether that is really the case or not, since I truly don&rsquo;t see black women paired up interracially (with anyone) that often. Hollywood, is different though. Sure, birracial Halle Berry is beautiful, and she is with a white male model. But I never considered Whoppi Goldberg any prize for Frank Langella, nor could I ever consider Heidi Klum too unattractive for Seal.</p>

			<p>Whenever I see a black woman dating a white man (Which is not too common here in flyover country), she usually has her act together. Clothes, hair, nails, shoes, etc. are perfect and she carries herself in a dignified manner. </p>
<p>Regardless of their class or station in life, most black women are very concerned with having their hair, and nails done. This does not always mean in a classy manner. The nails can be dragon lady length, and multicolored, and the hair could even be blue, but the black hair care business is a billion dollar industry, and you will rarely see a black woman who does not have a manicure, even when she is poor.  Many black women, no matter what their economic background. love designer shoes and handbags, because of they are status symbols to them. I still remember the black female after hurricane Katrina, who used her 2 thousand dollar debit card to buy a designer handbag. Which just goes to show, designer duds does not automatically equal class.</p>

<p>That is definitely the mind-set of many black American males. Most of them are more than up-front in their adolescent feelings that women are just for sex, and they can get it anywhere. This is why AIDS is so rampant in the black community. And many of these males become fathers several times over, to many women. They just hate it when the baby mama knows they are the daddy, and demands a paternity test. Heaven forbid, they get asked to pay child support, and give up some of their &#8220;stuff&#8221;</p>

			<p>There&rsquo;s a massive propaganda campaign out there to encourage interracial relationships, not only in the media but I believe there are many &#8220;actors&#8221; out there in the public to give people the impression it&rsquo;s more common than it really is and that the public should give it a try.  I&rsquo;ve made comments before that many of these people don&rsquo;t actually look quite White to me and one posters comments about them being non gentiles would certainly explain it. </p>

			<p>   Monogamous marriage is a fairly alien concept to most tribal societies in sub-Saharan Africa. Adult males usually have a &ldquo;right&rdquo; to sleep with multiple partners and can have multiple &ldquo;wives.&rdquo; African &ldquo;Americans&rdquo; here in the US have had Western concepts of marriage forced on them over the centuries but like the old saying goes, &ldquo;You can take the African out of the jungle, but you can&rsquo;t take the jungle out of the African.&rdquo; </p>

			<p>To Mr. Tall Korean:</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Well, sir, if you and I had met way back when, we might have dated.  But in my high school, there were few Asians of any sort, and most of the ones I did meet over the years were a lot smaller than I am. </p>
<p>Glad to hear that you are not put off by intelligence in a woman.  I have met a fair number of men who prefer their women less intelligent than themselves and also a lot smaller.  Have also met a number of other women who can tell similar stories of being rejected when the guys found out how intelligent they really were. </p>
<p>I have met a few men who preferred us Amazons, but most of those men were shorter than 6 feet.  </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I was not in honour roll. I always received very low marks for English. I came to Canada when I was fourteen and I had to work really hard to improve my language skills but still was never able to be where I wanted to be. Still not there to this day.</p>
<p>I do medical transcription for a living, and I have to deal with many different accents.  It seems to me that learning English (especially pronunciation) is very difficult for first-generation Asians&hellip; I can definitely tell the difference between the first-generation immigrants and Asian-descent folks who were born here. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(Guess what, being good at math certainly helps in the dating world! girls come to you for help with their math. Being skilled in computers also helps, believe it or not!!)</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.  Most women I know like smart men.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I am not angry but, I started to conclude that about 15% of all AmRen threads and posts are regarding the fact that &ldquo;Asian men can&rsquo;t get women&rdquo;  I am not angry. I started to be amused rather!!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my impression that at least some Asian men are pissed off that so many white men and Asian women get together&hellip; from what I&rsquo;ve read and heard. </p>
<p>Look&hellip; if most women go for tall men, and if most Asian men are not tall, that might give them trouble.  Most short American-born men I&rsquo;ve known have trouble getting dates.  Even really tiny women will mostly go for the 6-foot guy over the one who is 5-ft. 6-in.  &mdash;  no matter how wonderful the guy is, some women will overlook him because he&rsquo;s short, and he will have to work harder at the mating game.  Unfortunate, but it seems true. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I once read that boys do not ask out some of the most beautiful girls because the boys are afraid of being rejected.</p>
<p>Heck, some of the real lookers in high school intimidated me, and I am a straight woman!  I agree that it is tough on men out there&hellip; you&rsquo;re still expected to be the initiators, and you may face a lot of rejection when you ask women out. <br/>

			<p>Oprah tackled the subject of single black women not too long ago. On it many black women were saying the solution was to do like their men have been doing, and seek out partners from outside their race. In other words, they can&rsquo;t fix their problems from within, and need to seek solutions outside their race. Instead they should look at their 70% out of wedlock birthrate, and how they are raising them, so that more of their black sons wind up in the prision cells than in college dorms.</p>

			<p>  I feel sorry for many of the highly educated black women who can&rsquo;t find men. Many young black men are both spoiled and irresponsible. It certainly doesn&rsquo;t help blacks that so many of their best and brightest aren&rsquo;t reproducing. </p>
<p>As for as Asian men, I think most seek traditional women, and many American women, outside their ethnic group, are more self-centered and independent. Why a small but significant percentage of American East Asian go with white men is a mystery to me. East Asian men are generally faithful, hard working, intelligent, and good family men. </p>

			<p>My guess would be that a society&rsquo;s rate of marriage is directly proportionate to their rate of illegitimacy.  As my mom used to say, &#8220;Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?&#8221;  </p>
<p>Despite what feminists would have you believe, men are not going to respect you enough to marry you if you keep on popping out illegitimate babies for them with absolutely no consequences. Black women need to wake up and realize that this is a problem of their own making.  Stop sleeping around so much, use birth control, insist on a monogamous relationship.  It&rsquo;s not that complicated.  If the men knew that they would not be getting laid unless they were able to commit to, and take care of you, I promise you find a better class of men to select from.  </p>
<p>If your standards are as low as humanly possible, then do not be shocked when you are presented with a poor selection.   </p>

			<p>I just retired Thank God from 40 years of working for a government agency.  The first few years were before the horrors of affirmative action.  The white women I worked with were lady like, well mannered and efficient.  We treated other decently.</p>
<p>Then around 1972 the agency hired only affirmative action blacks, mostly women.  After all those years of listening to their babbling and screeching, being harassed by their bullying and intimadation tactics (totally backed up by HR) observing their work habits of working about 1 hour per day and spending the rest of the day complaining, intriguing, gossipping, making up lies about co workers, defying supervisors who nicely asked them to do some work, I hope never to see or hear another black woman for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t stand to go to the post office because black women staff my local.  I am so glad that the social security and medicare offices are now staffed by affirmative action hispanic and asian women.  If I were dependent on black women for medicare and getting my social security benefits I know it would be a nightmare of inefficiency and rudeness.</p>
<p>No wonder black men avoid black women.  After 40 years of close association with black female government workers, I can tell you that they are just 300 pound volcanoes of testostorone, hatred, agression and domination.</p>
<p>I think the solution might be to give black women massive implants of female hormones.  That might turn them into women instead of  what they are now.</p>
<p>I cringe whenever I am out and about and hear a black woman screechig and cackling.</p>
<p>What black man in his right mind would want to marry 300 pounds of hatred and agression?</p>

I fully agree with you about how many black females are highly aggressive. Perhaps, not as physically aggressive as their male counterparts, but definitely more verbally aggressive, with loud volatile temperments. And I can see why black men, (or any race of men) would want to avoid that. Which is why I was amused when I found a thread over the internet where black women were saying that since so many black men were pursuing non-black women, and since so many Asian women were marrying outside their race, that Black women and Asian men would make natural choices as partners. I tried to imagine why Asian men, who&rsquo;s culture, traditionally appreciates women who are polite, and non-aggressive, would want to entertain the thought, of getting involved with women who tend to be loud, aggressive, rude, and demanding? No matter how proud they are of being &#8220;Strong black women&#8221;. I just don&rsquo;t see that happening. And as long as black women continue to act as they do, and take pride in it, most will remain single.</p>

You might not expect a white female, Ameren reader to defend white men who date Asian women, but I have to take issue with what you said. My fiance is white, and very goodlooking, and keeps himself in great shape. He also has a good job. He has a brother, who is also good looking, keeps himself fit, and has a good paying job. They look, and are, so much alike they might as well be twins. Only difference is, my boyfriend is with me ( a white female) while his brother is married to an American female of Chinese descent. He did not seek her out over-seas, but met her at a party, and hit it off with her instantly. Up until that point, he had always dated white women. According to my brother, he did not seek her out because she was Asian, they simpley fell for one another. And to be honest, I like her very much! She is very Americanized, and not passive and meek, but modern minded, but still very feminine. I don&rsquo;t know what leads you to conclude, that the real white male catches go for black women, when there are many more white men with Asian women, and still far, far more white men with white women, and I mean from all walks of life. Few black women are even married, and fewer still are married to white men, or non-black men.</p>

			<p>I work with a lot of young Asian doctors, residents and interns.</p>
<p>They open up and talk to me a lot because I am older and willing to listen.  Many of them plan on arranged marriages.  Dating and courting, especially for a medical student or intern is a lot of trouble.  Asian women do go for white men, although it is difficult to find any white men working in hospitals any more.</p>
<p>So the Asian men are happy enough to consent to their parents finding them a bride.  Many of the brides come from the old country.  Their are matchmaking services that provide videos and all sorts of medical, financial and family history checks.  And many of the American born Asians arrange marriages among themselves.  If you are around Asians a lot, you hear a lot of things.  I grew up in San Francisco and I know a lot of the San Francisco Chinese and Koreans have arranged marriages.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It all fits in with the asian work ethic.  Spend your life from about age 12 to 30 studying and working 100 hours per work and your parents or grandparents will reward you with a beautiful, well educated, ladylike wife who will arrange a nice home, raise the children properly and be easy to get along with.</p>
<p>Most of the Chinese guys want wives from a certain area of China.  I can&rsquo;t pronounce it or spell it.  But the main attraction of women from this area is that they have white skin and are tallish and slim.</p>

			<p>&gt;This is not by choice. A very large number of black women can not get married because they can&rsquo;t find enough black men to marry them, and they can&rsquo;t find non black men to marry them either. </p>
<p>I am an Asian man, I think at least 95% of Asian men don&rsquo;t find black women attractive. There IS gorgeous black woman like Beyoncee but she is like, what, 1 in a million? And there is &#8220;black&#8221; woman like Alicia Keys which will not be half as pretty as she is now if both of her parents were black.</p>
<p>&gt;It&rsquo;s the same situation with Asian american men, so many of asian american women are marrying non-asian american men, there aren&rsquo;t enough asian american women for asian american men to marry, and we can&rsquo;t find many non-asian women to marry. This is why you see such a high number of single black women and asian american men in this country, unfortunately, there is no attraction or much interaction between the two groups….. </p>
<p>I assure you both groups will not want to have anything to do with one another. Both groups view each other as unattractive and that both groups will be better off if both groups minimize interaction with one another.</p>
<p>&gt;The dating and reproduction game in this country is very tough. It&rsquo;s a dream come true game for black and other dark skin males, because women perfer stronger and bigger dark skin men who takes higher risks. It&rsquo;s a tough dating game for conservative and weaker white males, and toughest for black women and asian men… </p>
<p>Being celibate is not such a terrible thing, especially if one consider what few unattractive choice one have, black woman or celibacy? Celibacy all the way. <br/>
Besides, the fewer people procreate the better, this planet is quite full already. </p>

<p>I am surprised that Asian men would prefer &#8220;tallish&#8221; wives, because many of the non-Asian men I&rsquo;ve met who go for Asian women seem to like them partly *because* Asian women tend to be on the small side. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my understanding that there is a region of China where people do grow very large (Manchuria, but also one other province?).  I saw one of these women once at a college in Long Beach, California.  She was at least 6&rsquo;4&#8221;; I&rsquo;m a big woman, but she made me look small. </p>
