<h1>New Data Show Dropout Rate Much Worse</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>KGTV (San Diego), July 16, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Nearly a quarter of San Diego public high school students dropped out in the 2006-07 school year, according to figures released Wednesday by the California Department of Education.</p>
<p>According to the CDE&rsquo;s report, 22.8 percent of ninth- through 12th-grade students within the San Diego Unified School District dropped out during the 2006-07 academic year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Throughout California, 24.2 percent of public school students dropped out in 2006-07, according to the CDE.</p>
<p>&#8220;Twenty-four percent of students dropping out is not good news,&#8221; State Superintendent of Public Instruction Jack O&rsquo;Connell said. &#8220;In fact, any student dropping out of school is one too many, and the data reveal(s) a disturbingly high dropout rate for Latinos and African Americans.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to O&rsquo;Connell, the dropout rate among African Americans is 41.6 percent statewide, and 30.3 percent for Latinos.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last year&rsquo;s estimate placed the dropout rate at 13 percent. O&rsquo;Connell said it would be a &#8220;mistake&#8221; to compare the two figures, however, because they were based on different information.</p>

															<h2>VVUHSD Worst Dropout Rate In County</h2>
											<p>
							<i>Victorville (California) Daily Press, July 16, 2008</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>{snip}</p>
<p>However, the state&rsquo;s average of a 24.2 percent dropout rate pales in comparison to the 54.5 percent within the Victor Valley Union High School District &mdash; the district is home to the worst dropout rates in the county.</p>
<p>District officials place the blame on a number of things including student frustration in meeting class requirements, according to Duneen DeBruhl, VVUHSD assistant superintendent of educational services.</p>
<p>&#8220;If students didn&rsquo;t feel they&rsquo;d have enough credits to graduate with the state required exit exam, they will feel more inclined to drop out,&#8221; said DeBruhl. &#8220;We&rsquo;ve also had an increase of special needs students and students learning English as a second language.&#8221;</p>
<p>The district far exceeds the state and county average in high school dropouts and holds the highest dropout rate within the Victor Valley.</p>
<p>Apple Valley Unified is second highest at 28.9, one percentage point lower than the county average.</p>
<p>&#8220;Families I encounter that come to the High Desert have a weak support system and the family&rsquo;s educational background is sometimes very weak as well,&#8221; said Chico Garza, special assistant to San Bernardino County Superintendent of Schools. &#8220;Youths I run into who are thinking about dropping out sometimes don&rsquo;t so much want to get out of school, but sometimes get out of their home. If they drop out and are frustrated on top of that, it can lead them to fall into gangs and get trapped in minimum wage jobs.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The data was compiled from a newly implemented tracking system that issues each student an identifier number. The number enables officials to monitor each student as he or she progresses through school, allowing for a more accurate accounting.</p>
<p>The new data revealed high dropout rates for minority students: 41.3 percent of black students, 31.3 percent of Native Americans, 30.3 percent of Hispanics, and 27.9 percent of Pacific Islanders. White students had a 15.2 percent dropout rate, while Asians had a 10.2 percent rate.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The state is downplaying the dropout rate by overestimating student withdrawals &mdash; those who transfer, move or earn GEDs normally make up a tiny fraction of enrollment, he said.</p>
<p>The state is also not including middle-school dropouts, which Bonsteel put at 4 percent, to come up with a total dropout rate of 37 percent.</p>

			<p>All states lie about their graduation rates in order to keep the federal (white) tax dollars flowing.<br/>
I read some reliable statistics for LA that indicates the Aztecs are dropping out at a 70% rate, not 24%.<br/>
This makes sense because the Aztecs coming here aren&rsquo;t the sharpest tools in the shed. These rural indian folks never even learned to speak Spanish and probably have IQs lower than American blacks.</p>

			<p>They drop out at alarming numbers, then talk about how whites keep them down and hold them back. Great always having whitey to blame for your own weaknesses and failings, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

			<p>This country due to the influx of minorities for the last 50 years is going to self-implode. Does anyone ever talk about how these people are NOT going to be PAYING taxes, but taking the taxes of the few Whites left who work?  They will all be criminals and too stupid to even hold the kind of job that runs a country, let alone pay any taxes to keep it going. Can you just see what our military is going to look like in 20 years? That is, if we even have a military? </p>

			<p>At least Detroit is ahead of someone in some category, even though it&rsquo;s in the area of social breakdown.  The dropout rate in Detroit schools in nearly as high as their teen pregnancy rate of over %70. </p>
<p>One thing the parents and their black social activist overseers know: someone will be court ordered to hire them or the overseers will demand and get a racial quota if the company they target is large enough. Government at all levels already does this in their hiring.  </p>
<p>Blacks, as a group, believe that being educated is &#8220;acting white&#8221;, and while I thank them for the compliment, they also know that they really don&rsquo;t need an education. The government will not just provide for them, it will demand they be hired.  </p>
<p>As the late &#8220;Sage of Baltimore&#8221;, H.L. Mencken, said, &#8220;we get the government we ask for, good and hard&#8221;.  </p>

			<p>In case anyone missed it:</p>
<p>Those drop-out statistics are almost perfect matches to the pattern of ethnic IQ statistics. </p>
<p>This is yet another layer of evidence that The Bell Curve was (and always has been) correct in its central thesis.</p>

			<p>Sure the drop rate is high. It was 30 years ago when I went to Highland Park High School in Topeka, Ks. This was a school in East Topeka with a large concentration of blacks. Before school they would gather at a Kwik Shop across from the school, do their stealing there and take turns tying up traffic on California Avenue while acting like they were crossing the street to to school. That was the black thing in 1978 and the extent of their education. Those that did actually attend class showed little ability to learn anything. However they sure learned to identify and hit on the weak minded white girls on a regular basis. They were a pathetic group in those days and I would think even worse now since in 1978 the drive by and crack hadn&rsquo;t been discovered yet. </p>

			<p>How can you possibly expect to get a half-decent job without even a high-school education? And high school is the barest minimum. Even with college there are tough times in the job market. But, of course, its all &#8220;Whitey&rsquo;s&#8221; fault.</p>

<p>It starts in the first grade,all that jumping around they never get the basics.Then they continue disrupting classes so that tests can&rsquo;t be taken and less can be taught.There&rsquo;s a method to their madness it takes a while to measure what they have accumulated in knowledge. calling them frustated is very polite.</p>

			<p>What is really sad is not only the West coast but all our major cities have 50 to 80 % of the blacks not graduating from high school, hence what a burden on the rest of us as they will be on welfare, in prison, or the government will give them a make-work job. I am an old man, but I feel for the next generation. This country is going to really suck before long.</p>

			<p>I know this seems counterintuitive but I wish  the white dropout rate was 100%.Then our young white people wouldn&rsquo;t be the enstupidated automatons that so many of them are. My children have never gone to school and that has made all the difference in their maturity, character and intelligence. Never forget, the obvious and well advanced degradation of our people was planned long ago by people with names like Dewey,Peabody,Carnagie,Rockefeller,etc. And don&rsquo;t think that half measures like school vouchers will solve anything- they will only destroy what&rsquo;s left of truly private education- that&rsquo;s why the neocommies are pushing them-so that a thug with a moucher can go to the same school you work like a slave to send your kids to.WE must demand nothing less than the repeal of all compulsory schooling laws and the end of all state involvement in the education of our posterity. It&rsquo;s either that or more of the slow death we have been enduring for at least the last 50 years now. There is no other alternative. We must have spiritual freedom- or we will face extinction.<br/>

			<p>If they drop out and are frustrated on top of that, it can lead them to FALL into gangs and get TRAPPED in minimum wage jobs.&rdquo;<br/>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -<br/>
Yeah, those poor Mexicans and Blacks. Always &#8220;falling into&#8221; vicious crime like rape and murder. Always getting &#8220;trapped&#8221; in low-paying work.<br/>
 Good God, how do they even survive to age thirteen, what with their propensity to &#8220;fall,&#8221; and get &#8220;trapped.&#8221; You gotta&rsquo; remind these people to BREATHE every once in a while, so they don&rsquo;t die of hypoxia! (Or so such patronizing Liberal rhetoric would suggest)&#8221;<br/>
Uh, no. NO, NO, NO! These people do not &#8220;fall, or are they &#8220;trapped&#8221;, except by their own genetics,or perhaps their choices. <br/>
But given that a liberal or academic, or politician, or clergyman could not possibly admit that, on average, third-worlders are trapped by their genes, then the aforementioned delusionals must one day have to admit that neither are the third-worlders &#8220;trapped&#8221; by circiumstances. <br/>
Either they are DNA-disadvantaged, or they are RESPONSIBLE FOR THEMSELVES. But given that the aforementioned delusionals-in their millions- are so deranged, it will be a cold day in hell when they admit that their most cherished fantasies of multicult kumbaya-ness&hellip;were manifestations of mental illness. It&rsquo;s pretty hard to convince a psychotic that they&rsquo;re hallucinating.<br/>
 <br/>
Bitter? oh, just a bit. I just can&rsquo;t believe how endlessly stupid my own people are, perpetuating this MADNESS about third-worlders, and their plight. Every possible contortion, every concievable perversion of objectivity, reality, truth and sense.<br/>
ANYTHING, God help us, but the way things really are.<br/>

<p>Posted by at 9:13 PM on July 17 </p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say what it will be in 20 years but right now I can say with some expertise, that the military now is pretty high quality which would include the blacks (overall) and the hispanics, but these people are those that have chosen to do other than crime and blame it on white oppression. Most come from poor families as I did and none have chosen to use the old &#8220;I was born in poverty&#8221; excuse to become criminals. So I will say that despite my white nationalist leanings in recent years, I am proud to serve with these men and women in the military over here, but acknowledge that these people are NOT representative of their respective races.</p>

			<p>After dropping out, what they do with their lives is a story itself, the rest of us pay a majority of their upkeep, their illegitimate kids, drug rehab, their criminal activities, and then total support during their prison term.</p>

			<p>Think about all the money that is spent on these dropouts at a younger age.  These kids are the ones getting all the title programs, special tutoring, etc, then they drop out.  Meanwhile schooling for others is constantly being dumbed down.  The average to superior student does not get the schooling they deserve because of the catering to minorities.</p>

			<p>Everyone seems to decry the dropout rate. I think it should be considerably higher for all races, esp. for Blacks and Mexican aliens, with more emphasis on trades. Schools would then much improved, much less disruption in classes and capable students would learn much faster. </p>
<p>We try to do the impossible in the country, we try to educate everyone. Many of these dropouts know well that school is not for them – after testing (including IQ)  and some counseling, let them go! For the sake of everyone and for higher educational standards, let them drop out at even at 14 or 15 and stop punishing the students that really belong.</p>
<p>Black politicians will scream but they know the truth; they want black youths to be babysitted as long as possible to keep them out of trouble and the expense of all other groups. Stop paying attention to them.   <br/>

			<p>CA Education Sup&rsquo;t.  Jack O&rsquo;Connell is quoted here.  He&rsquo;s the one who came out recently and said that non-white children can&rsquo;t learn anything because of white teachers.</p>
<p>The reason he said that is that he wants to be Governor, wants all those non-white votes, and once he thinks he&rsquo;s in the Governor&rsquo;s mansion, the White House isn&rsquo;t that far off.</p>

<p>Yes, the government schools must go- they were designed to succeed, by failing. Children are kidnapped by the &#8220;state&#8221; for 12 years- like being put into the &#8220;cooler&#8221; in one of those nazi movies.</p>
<p>Involuntary servitude for sure.  The biggest mistake Americans ever made was allowing government into education.</p>
<p>There is no way this hunpty dumpty can ever to put back together.  It is time for radical dropping out (secession) and non support of satanic d.c.  Associate only with Whites.  Never speak to anyone else.  Do business with Whites only.  Stop using the existing &#8220;bank&#8221; setup and FRNs.  The glue that holds it together is tax withholding, thanks to &#8220;libertarian&#8221;  milton friedman</p>

			<p>How can one expect these people to act any different than they do. Most of them come from single parent homes and have no parental role models. The biggest black scam is the unwed mother scam. Instead of working for a living, they become illegitimate baby factories. When the government quits rewarding them for the production of babies then possibly things will change. By the way, don&rsquo;t ya just love Jesse with his pants down. </p>

			<p>Why go to school? </p>
<p>You get free food = food stamps<br/>
you get free health care = emergency rooms<br/>
you get free housing = Section 8 vouchers</p>
<p>Why go to school? Why work? Live of the racist white race.</p>
<p>Jose doesn&rsquo;t need an education to run a weed-wacker or dish-washer or cut meat at a beef plant. Why do you think he was hired and the white kid wasn&rsquo;t? The large corporations DO NOT WANT intelligent workers. They want Jose. The car plants, the chicken plants the hotel industry want the stupid illegals. THEY ARE CHEAPER. That&rsquo;s the point.  And, </p>
<p>Conception doesn&rsquo;t need an education to spread her legs for Jose.</p>

			<p>The problem with vo-tech classes as a solution to the dropout rate is that vo-tech classes are generally only free to students who are still enrolled in high school.  In Boulder, Colorado, that was the case in the early 1980s.  Anyone else had to pay.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the soft job market, compounded by illegal immigration.  Some friends of mine very foolishly allowed their kid to drop out.  His first problem was that illegal Mexicans had monopolized the construction labor market.  His second problem is that the construction industry has evaporated.  Now he&rsquo;s 24, has no education to speak of, and possesses only some trade skills in an industry that has gone belly-up.</p>
<p>He should have stayed in school, taken trade classes, and gotten himself ASE certified; people aren&rsquo;t going to stop having car trouble.</p>

			<p>&#8220;District officials place the blame on a number of things including student frustration in meeting class requirements, according to Duneen DeBruhl, VVUHSD assistant superintendent of educational services.&#8221;</p>
<p>Could it be that students who are unable to meet class requirements are below average in intelligence?  What is the school system supposed to do, give them good grades and a diploma for not meeting class requirements?  </p>

			<p>&#8220;I can&rsquo;t say what it will be in 20 years but right now I can say with some expertise, that the military now is pretty high quality which would include the blacks (overall) and the hispanics, but these people are those that have chosen to do other than crime and blame it on white oppression.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most of what you write I agree with, and you bring up some really good points, but the black acceptance standards for the military have always been low, with a few exceptions.  Today it is even worse.  They&rsquo;re accepting those with criminal records now and less education, so the military affirmative action program has transitioned from about medium to intense.</p>
<p>For many years now the push has been on to get as many blacks as possible into the officer ranks and high tech jobs, and they&rsquo;ve pushed the envelope so far as to truly endanger efficiency, which will undoubtedly cost lives, all for the sake of being able to dodge any whining from black leadership by pointing to the numbers of blacks in these roles.</p>
<p>To anyone who is thinking of joining the US military:  DON&rsquo;T!  Some incompetent black could well cost you your life, and believe me my friends that is no exaggeration.  It&rsquo;s an honest evaluation of what I have observed first hand, and I&rsquo;ve observed a lot.</p>
<p>Regarding technological fields, most blacks have been square pegs fitted into round holes at great effort and much turmoil.  A friend of mine was an instructor who went through sensitivity training, along with many others doing the same work, wherein documentary type videos were shown describing how much of a disadvantage &#8220;poor&#8221; people were at, when it came to learning&hellip;&hellip;. and get this:  It was all due to poverty&hellip;&hellip; and not intelligence or ability.</p>
<p>He said teaching blacks was the most difficult job he ever encountered during his tour of duty.</p>
<p>And the whole AA program is just bean counting to keep the black leadership from howling about no blacks in tech positions, and officer slots, even though they shouldn&rsquo;t be there.</p>
<p>Our military is a disaster waiting to happen.  The multicults went to far when they caused our defense systems to become less capable for the sake of social engineering.  We haven&rsquo;t come up against anything but fourth and fifth rate militaries that don&rsquo;t even have the assets to defend themselves, so these politically correct appointments have not been noticeable to outsiders.</p>
<p>But the rest of our likely future military opponents are getting stronger and more advanced.  It&rsquo;s my opinion that we will suffer one of the most horrendous military defeats in the history of the country in the foreseeable future, and just like the sub-prime collapse, due to qualifying unqualified non-whites which has almost wrecked the US economy, our military disaster will eventually be traced right back to pushing unqualified people into slots they shouldn&rsquo;t have been working.</p>

			<p>Honestly, I&rsquo;ve seen independent estimates placing it overall at closer to half.</p>
<p>The California Dropout Research Project identified seventy-three high schools with a dropout rates greater than 50 percent, for example. Twenty-five of them were in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>I mean even Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said he believes the dropout rate at Los Angeles schools is even worse than the dismal 33 percent estimated by state officials. </p>
<p>Villaraigosa said the new state figures released Wednesday did not take into account all relevant factors. For example, he said, the state report did not count students who dropped out before ninth grade. </p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m heartened they are highlighting the dropout issue but I know it is higher than they are saying,&#8221; Villaraigosa said. &#8220;We know it&rsquo;s 50 to 60 percent and in some parts of the city 65 or 70 percent.&#8221; </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t drink the koolaid. If you live in Los Angeles, you KNOW it&rsquo;s worse.</p>

			<p>Skip, I retired from the Navy last year and I just can&rsquo;t agree with what your saying.  I came in the service in the mid eighties and the quality of people was pretty good.  Just in the past 6 years or so it&rsquo;s been deteriorating and it&rsquo;s not just the minorities either.  Fewer college educated, no work ethic and no morals.  Many of these young guys have been raised in single parent homes or with lesbian couples and they&rsquo;re damaged psychologically.  No self esteem, wimpy, shy, untrainable; not the kind of people who would be able to hold down a regular job on the outside.  </p>

			<p>Steve and Skip,</p>
<p>What happened is in 1982 under then President Ronald Reagen, the military implemented a sweeping new directive called &#8216;Project Upgrade&rsquo; which included close evaluations of military personnel, changes in training, mandatory random urinalysis testing, etc&hellip;</p>
<p>The end result of this was that the bottom 15% of military personnel were discharged from the military OTH in 1983 bringing to an end the post Vietnam era substandardness that existed before 1982. </p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re both correct. You have to look at it historically in context with 1982 being the dividing line when things got dramatically better. </p>

<p>Do you think these &#8220;minorities&#8221; realize and appreciate the fact that their lifestyle is almost wholly supported by White taxpayers?    <br/>
Sometimes I wish the White middle-class would collectively stop paying taxes for just one year.  Just to show how much these people live off of us.  I know it&rsquo;ll never happen but one can dream&hellip;      </p>

<p>Amen!  Absolutely right on.  Those of us still connected to the military are holding on by our finger tips to get our retirement pay, but it gets harder every year.  There is no happy face to today&rsquo;s once proud fighting forces I&rsquo;m very sorry to have to say. </p>

			<p>Well maybe if they drop out of high school, there will be more opportunities for whites to go to college, after all, there are some standards, and one plus one is an equation they may not understand if they don&rsquo;t study in school.  </p>
<p>On the serious side, we do have some issues in this country with some of the minority groups not acknowledging that they are the problem, not the years of so called oppression.  Give me a break, I am sick of their complaints.  </p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t flown to Europe and stood outside a castle demanding compensation from some descendant of a medieval Lord because my ancestors may have been serfs.  Course my daughter said who knows, we may have been in the castle, not in the huts&hellip;  She always has a humorous side.  </p>

			<p>I suggest John McWhorter&rsquo;s book LOsing the Race:Self-Sabotage in Black America, which sheds light on the massive failure of black students in public schools.  (He&rsquo;s a black UCB linguistics professor).  Why in the world should we expect blacks to do well in school, when they fiercely cling to the view that education is a &#8220;white&#8221; thing, something that white society is imposing upon them?  (Harriet Tubman turn over in your grave: early freed slaves died at the hands of whites because they had the audacity to insist that education was for blacks too).  Why in the world should we expect them to do well, when they are groomed from early ages by their depraved ghetto culture, to value criminal accomplishments and the gangster lifestyle?  Why in the world would anyone want to do well in school, if his goal is to be a badass and live his life out in prison?  Also if you think about it, there is just so much less risk for black youth if they don&rsquo;t even try to do well in school. If they try to succeed, they might end up discovering that they don&rsquo;t have adequate intelligence, will power, or other qualities necessary to succeed. If they don&rsquo;t even try, but choose to just drop out, they risk nothing.  <br/>
Here&rsquo;s an idea: Parents of students who drop out of high school should be fined a monthly fine to apply indefinitely into the future, commensurate with their demonstration of complete social irresponsibiliy. The fine being calculated as part of the cost to the whole society of a person who has nothing positive to contribute and can only grow up to be a leech sucking on the achievements of the rest of us, or a predator criminally preying on the rest.  </p>

<p>Voila.  You hit the nail right on the head with that part of your excellent post.</p>
<p>The only thing I might add is that, in my opinion, I&rsquo;m certain blacks have ALREADY tried to do the work, and when they realize they can&rsquo;t they develop an attitude of denigrating it as the work of fools in order to save face.  Their only alternative is to go along with the program and suffer failure, which would be devastating to their huge egos.</p>
<p>As the talking heads keep telling us, the entire black male population is in danger of an extermination of sorts, because they&rsquo;re turning to crime and going to prison.  If that&rsquo;s the choice they want to make instead of being manly enough to admit the truth, then they certainly deserve being warehoused away from civilized people.</p>
<p>My opinion is that they won&rsquo;t apply the necessary effort and dedication to learning a trade, because they believe they&rsquo;re too good for it.  Lying to them that they&rsquo;re as intelligent as every other race on earth just makes their attitudes worse, and it serves to exacerbate the problem.</p>
<p>Obama wants more money, private tutors, more teachers, more benefits, with everybody bowing and worshipping the black icons, because he sees such things as making them &#8220;equal.&#8221;  But it&rsquo;s been attempted now for decades and the bottom line is screaming out to us that you can&rsquo;t make a silk purse out of a sow&rsquo;s ear.  You can&rsquo;t put a sign on a pig and call it a horse.</p>
<p>His efforts will fail to have what he wants too.  And it will all be the fault of someone other than the blacks themselves, but all the black talking heads will be on all the talk shows saying so&hellip;over and over and over and over&hellip;&hellip;.as they do now.</p>

<p>Ranger:</p>
<p>What you wrote is exactly what black high school and middle school students do  &mdash;  and it is where the term &#8216;acting White&rsquo; comes from.  Many blacks are simply not able to handle school work past a rudimentary level  &mdash;  very basic reading and math, certainly not Algebra, Geometry, literature or Biology; they simply do not have the brain power to master these subjects  &mdash;   it is insanity for the government to insist that they take these courses to complete high school.  The reality is that they more often than not fail repeatedly and eventually drop out, angry, bitter, blaming Whites, as usual, for &#8216;trying to keep black people down!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I am writing from 20+ years of experience in the government schools and have seen this ad nauseum. Government schools have twisted themselves into pretzels catering to blacks and offering up every excuse for their failures except the real one: intractable IQs of 80.</p>
<p>Thomas Sowell writes that when non-qualified blacks arrive at college and realize quickly that they are in over their heads they do one of two things:  drop out or, more likely, scream &#8216;Institutional Racism!&rsquo; and loudly demonstrate, threatening violence if the university doesn&rsquo;t capitulate to their demands, as they did in the 60s  &mdash;  insisting on the creation of &#8216;black studies&rsquo; departments, separate black facilities and activities (paid for with student funds, of course), an overhaul of the professorial staff to include more blacks (effectively shutting out more qualified Whites)  &mdash;  demands that were generally met.</p>
<p>Women, hispanics and other self-described aggrieved groups, wanted in on the ethnic/racial/sexual spoils with demands of their own  &mdash;  Feminist/women&rsquo;s studies, chicano studies, trans-gender studies, separate facilities and activities for them (paid for with student funds) and so on  &mdash;  demands that were met, of course.</p>
<p>In California, I&rsquo;m hearing reports about Pacific Islanders now wanting in on the racial spoils  &mdash;  demanding separate studies, separate graduations, separate activities, paid for with student funds, of course.</p>
<p>Wonder who&rsquo;s next:  You can be very sure it won&rsquo;t be Whites.</p>
