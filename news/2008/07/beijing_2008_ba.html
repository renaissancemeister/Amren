<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>For &#8220;reasons of safety&#8221;, bars are forbidden to serve &#8220;blacks&#8221; and Mongolians or place tables in the street. Street musicians are being banned, and so is buying medicines containing &#8220;stimulants&#8221; without a prescription. Prohibitions are on the rise for the Olympic capital, while the first leaks reveal a grandiose fireworks display for the inauguration.</p>
<p>Bar owners around the Workers&rsquo; Stadium in downtown Beijing say that public security officials are telling them not to let in &#8220;blacks&#8221; and Mongolians, and many of them have even had to sign a pledge. The official reason is the fight against drugs and prostitution, dominated in the past by Mongolians and persons of colour. Moreover, public places must close by 2 a.m., for security reasons, and the bar owners are being asked to remind their clients that they must always have an identification document with them. There is even doubt over whether the bars within a radius of two kilometres from the Olympic buildings will be able operate, or whether they will have to shut down for the entire period. In some areas, tables are not permitted outside, because &#8220;the presence of too many foreigners gathered outside could create problems&#8221;. There is also an attempt to shut down outdoor musical concerts, to prevent disorder.</p>
<p>Jazz musician David Mitchell says that it is increasingly difficult for his band to find places to play in Beijing &#8220;Everything is aimed at creating stability, but they don&rsquo;t understand that is precisely the unfounded prejudice that foreigners have of Chinese society &mdash; that it is a highly controlled and not a very cultural place. It seems completely self-defeating&#8221;.</p>
<p>To guarantee a &#8220;clean&#8221; Olympics, a doctor&rsquo;s prescription is now required for 1,993 commonly used medicines, or the package must show a warning that the product contains substances believed to be stimulating and not permitted for the athletes. One must go to a hospital to get a prescription, but many of the hospitals ask for as much as 100 yuan for each prescription, causing problems for the elderly and the poor most of all.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as of July 20 a new regulation will go into effect prohibiting everyday circulation for millions of vehicles, but the three new underground lines are not yet working, and Zhou Zhengyu, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Committee of Communications, is unable to say when they will be opened.</p>
<p>But the inauguration on August 8 will be very well prepared. The programme is &#8220;secret&#8221;, but it is hard to hide a fireworks display, and those who live near the Bird&rsquo;s Nest stadium and have seen the trial runs say they are impressed. The director Zhang Yimou has been preparing the show for three years with artists from all over the world: there was a general rehearsal on July 10, with hundreds of police standing guard to guarantee secrecy.<br>

<p>In the West, the elite and liberal-idiots call this racial profiling. I urge China to press on with their &#8216;prejudice&rsquo; for the good of their land and their society. Learn from the dismantlement of U.S. &#8216;prejudices&rsquo;.</p>

			<p>Makes sense to me. I don&rsquo;t know about Mongolians, but blacks do cause a lot of problems. I didnt&rsquo; know there were blacks in China, (aside from foreign athletes). Maybe the Chinese are being extreme with some of their security measures, but there wont be many muggings, rapes, or murders. Compare that to when Atlanta hosted the Olympics. People were setting off bombs. (And yes, I know the Olympic Bomber was white. I&rsquo;m just using that to illustrate a point). When a nation has almost 2 billion people, a lot of freedoms have to be taken away for security reasons. Americans should see this as a warning for what&rsquo;s to come in our country. If we continue to let third world immigrants over-populate our country, pretty soon we&rsquo;ll be living like this.</p>

			<p>I;ve never heard of Mongolians lowering people&rsquo;s property values. but the Chinese have a long and troubled history with them just as we have with the Blacks. They have their reasons and the right to impose limits on outsiders.</p>

			<p>Since America self-destructed starting with its unconstitution anti-white, racist laws named &#8221; Civil Rights laws &#8221; and the passage of the racist and communistic and genocidal : 1965 Immigration and Reform act. We should bring these Chinese communists to run our corrupt government the same way. Blacks banned from anything that they didn&rsquo;t own or create, how wonderful and safe this idea sounds.</p>

			<p>There are black criminals all over East Asia.  It sounds ridiculous, but blacks from Africa immigrate to places like Thailand and Vietnam and end up living the same kind of criminal life styles they do in America.  This behavior is genetic for them.  </p>
<p>Blacks might go to China to study at a university and then drop out and become drug dealers.  The same thing happens in Russia.  Also, they rape women.  </p>

No drinking or whoring or partying or spontaneous celebration will be allowed, &amp; certainly no joy of any kind. Just serious, serious business; it&rsquo;s China, after all.  </p>

			<p>The Chinese are not patheticaly decadent as our governmant is.. their not worried about feelings as much as they are about civilized behavior and safety. Hopefuly they will not bend to the outcry thats likely to come from infected western nations that are busy destroying themselves.</p>

<p>What an ignoramous. Compare this stupid and UNCULTURED remark from a pretentious gasbag like Mitchell with Chinese Novelist Amy Tan who said that &#8220;Asia, in general, and China in particular, has a genius for community.&#8221;<br>
Which more than implies order and stability.</p>
<p>Also - to be Cultured does NOT mean that one quotes Shakespeare at cocktail parties.  And though a post is no place to go into just what is meant by that word, it is enough to say that a truly cultured man or woman can think for themself and don&rsquo;t need to walk around mouthing PC-Think while assuming a pose of being &#8220;cultured&#8221; and with it.<br>

<p>  What rubbish, just because the Chinese do not listen to the trash spewed by black bands does not mean it does not have culture. China has contributed more to human civilisation than what blacks of the world combined. Why do blacks think that culture means only jazz or hip hop or some screaming black woman? Eurasians and Native Americans have lived for thousands of years without black &#8216;culture&rsquo;.</p>

			<p> Yes there are a lot of African Blacks in China. I live in GuangZhou and in my complex (over 100 buildings) about 3-5% are blacks. It is quite interesting to watch them. They harass the young Chinese girls; on hot days smell bad; about 60% of the time Chinese will not ride in elevator with them; they are much ruder than Chinese; if the cops are called or there are drugs blacks are involved; many are Muslims; Chinese as a general rule do not like them; it is very rare to see Chinese woman with African man; their woman for the most part are severely overweight; they walk with the typical African swagger. Many speak Mandarin well. After several hundred years in America a black person is STILL like an African Black. THAT was most astonishing. Every white American should observe the best and the bright from Africa, THEN they would understand that their is no assimilation. Dressing up an African,Chinese, or any other race in Western clothing does not mean they have assimilated or even UNDERSTAND Western-White Culture.  It is the same as putting clothes on a monkey and thinking he is cute little child. The monkey is still a monkey.</p>
<p>It is also of interest that the Africans, Chinese and all other Asians I have met are VERY aware of their race and proud of even their failures. Only the White Man is ashamed of his race and full of self-hatred and shame. Only the White Man has abandoned his racial identity. It is so funny to watch the expats  from the West. They are clueless when they first arrive, then notice something is different, then after about six months notice that they are white and they are the only ones that are NOT aware of their race and racial heritage. The Globalist being the exception as he hates all races, all cultures and seeks to only exploit, destroy and rule over the weaker ones who love their race and culture.</p>
<p>And as usual, the vast majority of the Chinese understand the West and America through the eyes of the lies and half truths propagated through HollyWood movies and TV shows that are on DVDs and QQ for free. </p>
<p>But these are just my opinions and observations.<br>

			<p>Why is the term &#8220;black&#8221; always in quotation marks in this, I wonder. Is this term perhaps used differently in this region, are the Mongolians &#8220;black&#8221;?  Or is it maybe just a new term for them.  Just curious.</p>

			<p>Is there some reason No One seems to care for blacks or want to be around them? I notice even new immigrants to America seem to develop a bad taste in their mouth for &#8220;blacks&#8221; very quickly. Is everyone else wrong and only the blacks are right as far as them being like other people?</p>

<p>WOW, I must say I never realized this before today.  I always thought the East Asians had more sense than the West with regards to importing dark-complected 3rd World types. Are they tring their best to emulate us that they&rsquo;re even engaging in our most self-destructive behaviors?      </p>

			<p>&#8220;For &ldquo;reasons of safety&rdquo;, bars are forbidden to serve &ldquo;blacks&rdquo; and Mongolians or place tables in the street.&#8221;</p>
<p>     I&rsquo;m astonished to hear that Mongolians are responsible for such criminal behavior. Honestly, I never knew. </p>
<p>&#8220;Chinese as a general rule do not like them; it is very rare to see Chinese woman with African man&#8221; Michael Smith</p>
<p>  It is rare to see Chinese, Korean or Japanese women with black men in the United States as well. Over the last thirty years, I&rsquo;ve seen very few. </p>

<p>My question is:<br>
What do those whites who come to realize that they wre the only ones not aware of their heritage&hellip; what do those white come to feel about their heritage after realizing it? Do they come to appreciate their heritage or are they simply aware of it in a detached manner?</p>
<p>I would like to hear from anyone who could answer this question in a knowledgeable way.<br>

<p>I have only lived in China almost five years and have found quite the opposite.</p>
<p> They don&rsquo;t like US government policy but this is for sure: The Chinese spend millions of dollars on their woman with special creams to LOOK like white woman, American White Woman. The Chinese woman dress to look sexy and cute to LOOK like American White Woman. Without White Men working as Expats in China business would collapse and become more chaotic and inefficient.</p>
<p>Middle class Chinese spend millions to have apartments that LOOK like White Western apartments.  Rich Chinese spend millions to have homes that LOOK like White American homes. Everywhere you go you see the desire and copying of White Western Culture. </p>
<p>Are there some Chines that don&rsquo;t like White Americans? Yes the number is growing&hellip;  As the Chinese live in a very large shadow of White America. Young people are asking: What happen to us??</p>
<p>Imagine leaving your whole live as a Chinese man and then you notice that your whole race and culture has been nearly destroyed by communism and NOW White Western Culture DOMINATES you. The fastest growing restaurants are White Western. The fastest growing car companies are White Western Cars or Copies. The fastest growing clothing business is White Western LOOK. The fastest growing job industry is White Western banking and financial institutions or COPIES. ALL PROGRESS in China is to become MORE like WHITE WESTERN MAN. Fast growing industry: WHITE Western Weddings, containing wedding pictures where yellow skin is turned to white. The greatest stars in China project WHITE looking skin and style&hellip; Music is nothing but regurgitated pop and rock from the White West&hellip;Can ANYONE take a skinny effeminate Chinese boy performing Hip HOP and Rap serious???? etc. etc. etc&hellip;    </p>
<p>China as MOST of the world wants to LOOK and have the FEELING of the MODERN society created by WESTERN WHITES&hellip; and show it with their pocket books and actions.. every day.  </p>
<p>NObody wants to LOOK Black. NObody wants to LOOK Korean. Nobody considers acting like American Indians progress. NObody is spending millions on makeup and hair color to LOOK like Chinese. BUT all around the world, billions want to be and try to LOOK like Western Whites. </p>
<p>All progress, all modernization is to be like White Western Culture&hellip;  even in it&rsquo;s decline it is envied by the world..  Maybe OBAMA will change that.. but so far the trend is strongly intact. Progress equals White Western. </p>

			<p>Michael Smith, fair skin among its people has always been favored by the Chinese - today and in the past when Europe was still in the stone age, likely before Chinese Civ even knew white people existed at all. I seriously, seriously doubt they are intentionally trying to look like another race as you claim.</p>
<p>In regards to the other issue you raised, know that modernization does not automatically imply Westernization. Today we are seeing China&rsquo;s development in full force and it is seemingly analogous to both the Industrial Revolution and the Renaissance combined. I have been there, it is more modern but remains unmistakeably, positively Chinese.</p>

			<p>I wish that what Michael Smith wrote is the meaning behind e asian behavior but I fear that it is just surface covering. I believe that the e asians are truly different in thinking and behavior just as they have opposite traits from many africans. </p>
<p>I believe as the barbarians aped roman habits and romans took on many greek ideas, these people are trying on different &#8216;clothing&rsquo; to enrich their society. They truly have no desire to change but to assimilate into their culture whatever appears to be &#8216;good&rsquo; in modernity. </p>
<p>They secretly don&rsquo;t like much about the white man but only take advantage of what is there to enhance their lives and their culture. In a few thousand years, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if many aspects of the western cultures have blended seamlessly into the asian civilization without creating major fundamental changes, whereas the whites are mixed to a muddy brown and unaware that they are the decendents of the creators of western civilization. I hope MS is right and that I&rsquo;m wrong. </p>
<p>We need to end our immigrant policy.</p>

			<p>It is easy for a Chinese bar owner to keep blacks out of bars.  But how do Chinese bar owners keep Mongols out of bars when they of the same Asian race as the Chinese?  Mongols are an entirely different people and culture than the Chinese, but if a Mongol walks into bar, apart from a government I.D. card, how is a Chinese bar to tell a Mongol apart, from a Chinese person, and ask him to leave the bar?</p>
<p>To everyone reading this post, I would recommend you see the movie &#8220;Mongol&#8221;.  It is a great film!  Genghis Kahn was a ruthless, but highly intelligent conquerer who helped build a great Mongol civilization.  So I would not compare the Mongol horse culture to that of the primitive black African cultures that never were able to advance very far.  The Mongols once had an empire that stretched from Asia to eastern Europe.</p>
<p>China in Marco Polo&rsquo;s time was a much further advanced civilation than that of Medievel Europe.  The Chinese invented gun powder, the use of coal, pasta, printing presses, and other advancements before that of white European civilization.  The Chinese even discovered how to vaccinate themselves from small pox, by sniffing small pox scabs.</p>

			<p>NOW I am starting to really understand how the Chinese are overtaking the USA in so many area&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s because they are SMARTER THAN WE ARE and they ACT upon their knowledge, they know the spoiler and they limit his access. We will do better when we go back to doing the same. If we ever do?</p>

			<p>The very same prejudice against dark skin was equally prevalent in Europe until the 1900&rsquo;s and is still to some extent practiced in the Mediterranean region. It has nothing to do with race. Farm labourers working outside all day, be it China or Europe tend to tan more, unless on was a soldier or explorer, a dark tan indicated social class. Even in North America, if you see a woman with an umbrella on a sunny day, she is likely to be Chinese.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m of two minds on this. I am generally opposed to discrimination on race developed as a policy, but I also love balance in all things. Given the very great lengths and overreaching manner in which we in the US have gone to try to eliminate discrimination against blacks or other nonwhite persons, even to where a private property owner renting out a room in their own house cannot discriminate on the basis of race, and we&rsquo;ve instituted discriminatory race-based quotas to try to undo discrimination, to hear that someone somewhere in the world is blatanly discriminating based on race, seems less offensive than an honest representation of part of human nature.  I would like to find a balance between finding policies that do not oppress or encourage violence toward particular groups, while also allowing people space to be themselves and protect their own cultures.  I found it interesting to look into the history of my 100 year old house in Oakland.  Back in the first half of the 20th century, my neighborhood fell under &#8220;Community Race Restrictions&#8221; which would have kept black people from being able to buy houses here.  Berkeley also had a &#8220;sundowner&#8221; law that barred blacks from being in certain areas after sundown.  It gives one pause to realize that when we as white residents struck down these kinds of laws, we simultaneously proved ourselves fairminded and open, as well as guaranteed our victimization at the hands of black predators.  Area crime reports reveal that over 98% of the street crime (robbery, drug dealing, assaults, petty thefts or burglaries where the burglar was seen and can be identified by race) plaguing these neighborhoods at the present time is committed by black people, generally black males age 14-25.   </p>

			<p>&#8220;Mongols are an entirely different people and culture than the Chinese, but if a Mongol walks into bar, apart from a government I.D. card, how is a Chinese bar to tell a Mongol apart, from a Chinese person, and ask him to leave the bar?&#8221;</p>

			<p>It is reasonable to say that Chinese consider fair skin one of the markers of beauty for a woman. Same for most other Asians I believe. Asian women will walk around with an umbrella on a <i>sunny</i> day. As many of you have pointed out, this pretty much has nothing to do with the spread of Western cultural norms to the East<br>
However it behoves me to point out that while Chinese admire fair skin, most Chinese prefer their own complexion and skin quality over the &#8216;white&rsquo; skin of white women. The smooth unblemished skin of the average Chinese woman (and particularly Japanese) is rare to most white women. Furthermore Chinese women will naturally maintain their skin quality to a much greater age than the average white woman. I have seen white woman about 35 who a Hong Kong girlfriend mistook for someone in her 50s. Admittedly this could have something to do with the predilection of white women for tanning.</p>
<p>So while fair skin is prized in Chinese culture - that certainly by no means means Asian women want skin like that of white women. Chinese women openly consider their complexion and skin quality to be the best, while acknowledging that European women beat Chinese women in breast size.<br>

			<p>It&rsquo;s no secret that the Chinese have a low opinion of blacks.

			<p>How is a Chinese to distinguish a Mongol from a Han Chinese?  I don&rsquo;t know, but they do.  I can generally tell a Southeast Asia from a Northeast Asian, but that&rsquo;s about it.  But when an American supermarket chain had ads featuring a happy Oriental family, there was an uproar among Northeast Asians because the ad showed Chinese and Japanese models as part of the same family.  I can&rsquo;t tell the difference, but they can.  </p>

			<p>Just my two cents:<br>
The Chinese swam in rivers of their own blood, as much or more than did the Soviets. They were smashed under brutal communism, and of course they had to participate, for this to happen. <br>
As much as they are better than Africans, they have a very long way to go before they outgrow what ailed them, what allowed them to undergo the brutal insanity of their revolution. There&rsquo;s something dark and twisted there. <br>
Now, as Western culture poisons itself (and I hope it will cease it&rsquo;s suicide), maybe China is growing up. I don&rsquo;t know. But don&rsquo;t admire them too much. They have a LOT of blood on their hands.</p>

<p>Just a WAG here, but maybe there lies a lingering multigeneral resentmant against Mongols for their having occupied China once upon a time.</p>
<p>In the Forbidden City the names and/or uses of the various royal buildings are labeled in both Chinese and Mongolian script. Done in bas-relief stone if I recall correctly.</p>
<p>Also, the Mongols were one reason for child marriages. As yearly tribute to Genghis Kahn there were gold, grains and a certain number of virgins. They got around this by declaring that the married girls were soiled. So, they got the daughters  of peasants who couldn&rsquo;t buy themselves an arranged wedding.</p>

If it were racism, why not bar whites? We are not Chinese either. When blacks stop misbehaving, they will find that the public opinion of them changes.</p>

<p>This is a complete fallacy.  Only the Africans at the top are interested in Chinese intervention; they are the ones who get paid.  There have been a series of riots in Chinese operated, black staffed operations in Africa because the Chinese rulers expected the same docile, compliance from the Africans that they get from their own slave laborers at home (and probably moreso). For whatever else it is worth, China is still a COMMUNIST country, whereas most African countries are now democracies, albeit highly inefficient, corrupt ones. The average Chinese factory worker works 6-12 hour days for an average of about 48 cents an hour in dangerous conditions and dies young.  This is why their goods are so cheap, not any intrinsic genius of the people. </p>
<p>Another fallacy is that the average Chinese rural-urban worker has a better lifestyle than that of the Average African; again not true.  The major difference in lifestyle in Africa compared to most of China is natural diseases (as well as the spread of AIDS).  Both groups are seen as human cattle by their respective governments, and any treaty is uneasy an unwanted from both sides each of whom have little mutual respect.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where the hell do they get the drugs? Do they conjure them up from thin air?</p>
<p>Of course not! Whitey forces them to sell drugs (whitey conjures them up from thin air).&#8221;</p>
<p>You scoff at this, but it is an interesting question.  If poor Africans immigrate to China to go to school and a few years later become major drug dealers, where did they get the drugs?  Somewhere down the line, there would have to be some whites/Chinese who actually brought the drugs to them.  I would suspect it works the same here.</p>

			<p>Mongols don&rsquo;t look Chinese to answer the question asked by the person who thinks that Mongols can be mistaken for Chinese. An East Asian person can tell the difference between a Korean, a Japanese, a Chinese, a Mongol, and so on. White people(and people of other races) well acquainted with East Asians can do the same. Mongols and Chinese are not the same ethnically. Chinese are not unified ethnically though, although many Chinese are Hans.</p>

<p>That could be part of it, but they&rsquo;re without question trouble makers.  Not as bad as blacks, but still much worse than the average Chinese.</p>
<p>What the Chinese need is a good military strategist in propaganda warfare.  He would see that violent criminal incidents and other crimes involving blacks make it to the newspapers throughout the world every time they commit some kind of sordid act in China.  Then when they issue an edict like this one, it doesn&rsquo;t leave a lot of room for criticizing.</p>

			<p>Many posters here have asked about Sino-Mongolian hostilities, and what Bantus are doing in China, Russia and the old Soviet bloc. I may have some answers.</p>
<p>Genghis Khan conquered China in the Middle Ages, true enough. The Chinese have long memories, but that isn&rsquo;t the whole story. If you look at a globe, you will note that Mongolia is sandwiched between Russia and China. Even though Mongolians, in outward appearance, resemble the Chinese, they have been closer to the USSR-Russians, POLITICALLY. Consider:</p>
<p>In 1921, Mongolia declared its independence - with strong Soviet backing. They did not want to become a Chinese satellite state, and allowed the USSR to deploy troops there, for decades. During the Sino-Soviet ideological disputes, Mongolia always supported the USSR. In 1971, Lin Piao, who was regarded as Chairman Mao&rsquo;s successor, failed in a coup attempt, and escaped to the USSR. He died when his plane crashed in Mongolia. The Chinese have never forgotten this.</p>
<p>As to why many Bantus are in China, that goes back to the days of the Communist Internationale, when the Soviet bloc and Chinese governments would blather on and on about how men were brothers, etc. Many African regimes were intrigued with the state owning the means of production, as well as holding political power. They swallowed the East&rsquo;s &#8220;success&#8221; stories, hook, line and sinker. Throw in the fact that China and the Soviet bloc supported the &#8220;liberation&#8221; struggles in Portuguese- held colonies, and Southern Africa.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t ask me how they did it, but the African regimes warm to the concept of &#8220;socialism&#8221;, identified their most promising students, and sent them to be educated in Soviet-bloc and Chinese universities. They were unable to provide an education in the outhouses that pass for Bantu universities. Add to that, the Soviet-bloc and Chinese made these students an offer they couldn&rsquo;t refuse - free tuition.</p>
<p>Just because their government welcomed them, the average Chinese Wang and Nang did not welcome the Bantus, necessarily. A few years ago, Bantu students from Mali were raping Chinese women in their dorm rooms, in a Beijing university, I believe. When Chinese men came and beat up the Malians in retaliation, the Bantus howled &#8220;racism&#8221;.</p>
<p>In the Soviet bloc, Ivan and Tatiana Citizen had no use for Bongodisha and Lakesha either. These Bantu students were foisted on them, by their own governments.</p>
<p>Sounds kinda familiar, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the value of a doctorate from Timbuktu University, anyway?      </p>

<p>Absolutely.  And that means that the first thing we learn how to do is actually TALK to each other.  I still don&rsquo;t think we know how to do it. We are still at some sort of awkward stage, and I include myself.  <br>
In a way, this is a very good sign. Whites are, after all, smart enough and sensitive* enough to BE confused. Only Stupid People are absolutely convinced they are right.<br>
Regardless, our confusion IS a stage we are going to have to work past - asap.  <br>
A huge part of our problem, maybe time will show it to be THE problem, is not simply what is being done to us, but the fact that we have, as yet, no organizing principle.  <br>
At this moment, finding one is, I think, our proper task.</p>

<p>Sorry, but wrong again, I know you wish that would be true, but the sheer reality is, is that your are dead wrong. Most blacks as well as whites are law-abiding citizens, no problems. There are enough self-respecting women that would go out with any guy, be it white, black, whatever, but then again, I speak Japanese fluently, never had a problem and again, been around the country and what you are saying is 80% untrue, yes, you do have some Japanese women that will not date Blacks, or Whites or anyone non-Japanese, so instead of presenting weak arguments that have no substantial merit, try not to worry about with whom or what another non-white woman wants to be with. </p>
