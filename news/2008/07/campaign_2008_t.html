<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>It is one of our fondest political myths that elections allow us collectively to settle the &#8220;big issues.&#8221; The truth is that there&rsquo;s often a bipartisan consensus to avoid the big issues, because they involve unpopular choices and conflicts. Elections become exercises in mass evasion; that certainly applies so far to the 2008 campaign. A case in point is America&rsquo;s population transformation. Few issues matter more for the country&rsquo;s future &mdash; and yet, it&rsquo;s mostly ignored.</p>
<p>Two changes dominate &mdash; aging and immigration &mdash; and they intersect. In 2005, 12 percent of the population was over 65; by 2050, that will be almost 20 percent. Meanwhile, immigration is driving population growth. By 2050, the population may exceed 430 million, up from about 300 million now. About four-fifths of the increase will reflect immigrants and their children and grandchildren, estimates the Pew Hispanic Center. The potential for conflict is obvious. Older retirees and younger and poorer immigrants &mdash; heavily Hispanic &mdash; will compete for government social services and benefits. Squeezed in between will be middle-class and middle-aged workers, facing higher taxes.</p>
<p>What do John McCain and Barack Obama say about these looming problems? Well, not much. Of course, they&rsquo;re against poverty and fiscal irresponsibility. They oppose illegal immigration and favor &#8220;reform.&#8221; But beyond these platitudes, they&rsquo;re mostly mute. {snip}</p>
<p>Similarly, immigration is widely studied. Pew projects that immigrants will constitute 19 percent of Americans in 2050, up from 12 percent in 2005. The Hispanic share of the population will double, from 14 percent to 29 percent. If most immigrants assimilated rapidly, this wouldn&rsquo;t be worrisome. But many, especially Hispanics, don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Consider a new study of Mexican-Americans by sociologists Edward Telles and Vilma Ortiz of UCLA. Compared with their parents, the children of immigrants did make progress, Telles and Ortiz found. Incomes increased; English-language skills spread; intermarriage rose. But after the first generation, gains were grudging. Third-generation Mexican-Americans were only 30 percent as likely as non-Hispanics to have completed college. In the fourth generation, about 20 percent still had incomes below the government poverty line. &#8220;Assimilation, where it occurred, was far slower than it was for European-Americans,&#8221; write Telles and Ortiz.</p>
<p>Because government policies might mute these problems, they ought to be subjects of campaign debate. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} To discuss these issues candidly might be political suicide. It could alienate crucial blocs of voters: retirees, Hispanics. Blunt talk would expose a candidate to charges of being mean-spirited (against retirees) or racist (against Hispanics). What political consultant advises such a course?</p>
<p>People complain about governmental gridlock. {snip} The stalemates on immigration and retirement spending are typical. We avoid messy problems; we embrace inconsistent and unrealistic ambitions. {snip}</p>
<p>By and large, Americans want to be told what government will do for them &mdash; as individuals, families, consumers &mdash; and not what it will do for the country&rsquo;s long-term well-being, especially if that imposes some immediate cost or inconvenience. Grasping this, our leading politicians engage in a consensual censorship to skip issues that involve distasteful choices or that require deferred gratification. {snip}<br>

			<p>The two &#8220;LEADING LIARS&#8221; (a.k.a. McCain and Obama) are pandering their rear ends off to the Mexicans to buy votes. The two are enough to gag the proverbial maggot.</p>
<p>What really gets me is Phony Obama. He can&rsquo;t be dumb enough to not understand his Blacks are the first impacted by illegal immigration. Losing jobs to the Mexicans. So WHY would Obama kiss up to La Raza, to LULAC and the other open border groups?</p>
<p>McCain, understandably owes his soul to the growers who helped finance him. But Obama? You can only laugh at the utterly simple-minded Blacks supporting Phony Obama. Since apparently they don&rsquo;t have the brainpower to grasp Obama is supporting what Blacks can only view an enemy (job competitors).</p>

			<p>&#8220;Or that require delayed gratification&#8221;  I can`t think of any project that would require more delayed gratification than say the Brooklyn Bridge. Or maybe the Hoover Dam. How did these get built? They were started when the enviromental laws were not yet  a strangle hold and America was not yet a mish mash of competing ethnic groups all looking out for No. 1. Expect to see more and more of this &#8220;governmental gridlock&#8221; when no one group can push any agenda through. Nothing gets built, nothing gets done. Not even the arguing about it.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s fairly obvious why politicians don&rsquo;t want to discuss immigration.  It&rsquo;s a topic that if they can avoid they will.  They avoid it because the only possible answer to what it&rsquo;s doing to our country is to stop it - ASAP.  However, if they propose doing that, they will risk the wrath of the media and what that media - and also the AIPAC lobby will do to their careers.  They worry first and foremost about themselves and their livelihoods, not the people they represent.  </p>

How would it ever be &#8220;in our favor&#8221; when both candidates are latino-pandering hacks?<br>
IF a majority wrote in &#8220;Ron Paul&#8221; for president on their ballot, we might finally have a voice in the oval office, one that truly wants what is best for the sovereignty of the USA.<br>

			<p>I &#8220;sort of&#8221; saw all this coming, and that&rsquo;s why I didn&rsquo;t have children.  I use as much water, power, and gasoline as I need to make sure I live an extremely comfortable lifestyle.  I water the hell out of my lawn during the summer, and I crank the A/C.  During the winter, I light two (2) fireplaces and keep things toasty.  And I keep my outdoor hottub running 24 hours a day.  I&rsquo;ve been known to run the dishwasher when it had only a few dishes in it.  When I leave the room, I turn ON lights.  I drive a Jaguar XJ6 that absolutely sucks down the petrol.  Our politicians, by allowing the mass importation of crime and poverty, have shown that my selfish, soliptistic lifestyle choices are rational.  The US will continue, but not in a form that anyone would deem worth fighting for.  I&rsquo;m not going to preserve our natural resources, and reduce my comfort during my few short precious years on earth, for a bunch of people who never, ever should have been allowed into this country.  If I&rsquo;m wrong, tell me why. </p>

			<p>The only difference between Obama and McCain is that McCain, at least, is paying some lip service to enforcement before opening the flood gates and Obama doesn&rsquo;t seem to want to be bothered with enforcement.  <br>
Based on the projections in the near future, we will have at least two separate cultures and languages.  Taxes will skyrocket and elderly whites may be looking at some tough sledding in their old age.</p>
<p>It is totally amazing to me that this country, unlike any other,  refuses to enforce our borders and regulate immigration in a halfway intelligent fashion.    How stupid is that? This speaks volumns about our elected &#8220;leaders&#8221;.</p>
<p>When the late Congresswoman Barbara Jordan was in the House, she was appointed Chair of the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform.</p>
<p>After investigations and hearings, Congresswoman Jordan made important findings that that could be summed up in a nutshell:</p>
<p>&#8220;It is both a right and a responsibility of a democratic society to manage immigration so it SERVES THE NATIONAL INTEREST.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is clear to me that our new &#8220;leaders&#8221; are not going to be any better.   Beam me up!</p>

			<p>Just one more proof that the presidential election process has been carefully staged and <i>We the People</i> have about as much to chose from as Russians had during the elections in Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The behind-the-scenes directors, similarly to the Politburo of the Soviet Communist Party, decided what our choices will be, and they look rather miserable. I can&rsquo;t help not noticing that this Soviet-style manipulation rooted itself in American politics right after a huge wave of post-WWII immigration from Soviet Union and its satelites.</p>
<p>Can it be the case that Mexican Hispanics are not the only ones who try to replicate the system that they emigrated from?<br>

			<p>Fast food, instant gratification and stupid ignorant people do not make a great nation.  It is hard to look at USA and see what it has become in the last 25 years!   American identity is lost,<br>
the immigrants proudly announce they are making history having babies.  It appears they are correct.  Politicians will get away with what ever they can.  The PEOPLE have made no demands of them this year.  The politicians control the economy and to avoid the tough debates they create OTHER problems.  RISE UP or be swallowed! Who are the Amercian people??  Better get organized.  V</p>

			<p>Amren readers realize that there is virtually no difference between John McCain and Barack Obama when it comes to immigration, illegal or legal.  The general public, on the other hand, tends to perceive a greater difference between the two.</p>
<p>This is what the liberal/neocon alliance wants.  It wants to DIVIDE AND CONQUER average American voters by exaggerating, through the mainstream media, tiny differences between McCain and Obama on immigration policy so that voters don&rsquo;t feel compelled to look elsewhere. </p>

Unfortunately, Bobby, the most Americans value materialism over patriotism or sacrifice.  Not all, certainly, but most.  Just look at all of the fancy houses and cars that Americans buy but can&rsquo;t really afford.  A half-century ago, Americans tended to live within their means.  Not so today.  Just look at all of the housing foreclosures across the country since 2006.  It&rsquo;s unprecedented in American history. </p>

<p>What&rsquo;s happening is that Obama is baiting McCain. Obama&rsquo;s base either wants amnesty or doesn&rsquo;t care; McCain&rsquo;s base gets angry everytime he brings it up. McCain (#894 out of 899 of his USNA graduating class) is too stupid to notice. One would think his well-paid staff might bother to tell him, though. Or maybe when they do he&rsquo;s telling them what he told Senator Cornyn: &#8220;F%^& You!&#8221;</p>
<p><i>As such, it&rsquo;s making immigration an issue again, which may well alter the downballot races in our favor.</i></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope. That Chris Cannon defeat was the rare sweet taste of victory.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;To discuss these issues candidly might be political suicide. It could alienate crucial blocs of voters: retirees, Hispanics. Blunt talk would expose a candidate to charges of being mean-spirited (against retirees) or racist (against Hispanics). What political consultant advises such a course?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To put an amusing perspective on the above (even if darkly so,) is to note that this author, Mr. Samuelson, is missing the larger point of his own article. It is all well and good, to point out that it could be considered &ldquo;racist&rdquo; to make a political issue of &ldquo;immigration&rdquo; and &ldquo;undocumented migrations,&rdquo; but it is the only real issue of concern and potential disaster here. The fact is, he is considering an increase in the age 65 and over population of only 8 points (from 12% to 20%) by 2050, but an increase in the overall nonwhite population from about 35% today to about 53% or better of the total population in 2050; that is taking a white population of approximately 200 million and dividing it by a total of the projected 430 million, to obtain that percentage for 2050. </p>
<p>He is lightly touching on the racial aspects of these projected demographic shifts, as he discusses the poor assimilation outcomes for Hispanics, but refuses to consider just how poorly other nonwhites have preformed in this regard, and continue to do so. For almost every nonwhite group in this country (from native born blacks to even East Asians, the oft cited &ldquo;model minority&rdquo; in terms of assimilation) there is a propensity to want to shift away from &ldquo;equality&rdquo; demands, to &ldquo;entitlement&rdquo; extortions. </p>
<p>In fact, one might call this movement from &ldquo;equality&rdquo; demands to &ldquo;entitlement&rdquo; extortions, a form of negative or even<br>
multicultural &ldquo;assimilation&rdquo; for nonwhites; by this I mean, no matter how poorly or achieving nonwhites are in terms of education and socioeconomics in relation to whites in the USA, there is a conscious movement toward being classified as in the &ldquo;aggrieved&rdquo; and &ldquo;oppressed&rdquo; class, to obtain preferential treatment. Or put another way, negative or multicultural &ldquo;assimilation,&rdquo; amounts to jumping on the &ldquo;victimized&rdquo; by &ldquo;white privilege&rdquo; bandwagon/gravy train of today, while also obtaining the larger and more longstanding sociopolitical advantages of living in a Western country.</p>
<p>In the absurd social construct of multiculturalism, that is the sine qua non for nonwhites &ldquo;functioning&rdquo; in a white society, while also &ldquo;enriching&rdquo; it as well with the even more odiously intangible social mythology of diversity. Or put another way again, they can&rsquo;t lose and whites can&rsquo;t win, since we do not represent a race, but an oppressive and objectified social construct to host such nonsense.</p>
<p>Thus, the crux of the problem that Mr. Samuelson whishes to address but just can&rsquo;t fully bring himself to join in battle. Ironically, it is probably the point that he would most enthusiastically bash the white septuagenarian Comrade McCain over, but would be quite cautious in doing the same in reverse to the mulatto &ldquo;wunderkind&rdquo; Comrade Obama over in his &ldquo;dialectic.&rdquo; </p>
<p>This being that the white population (or any other racial grouping, for that matter) in this country that has achieved retirement age, should be of paramount concern in regards to the social safety net as citizens, when measured against the newly arrived and &ldquo;enriching?&rdquo;  Moreover, given overpopulation versus &ldquo;humanitarian&rdquo; considerations in terms of resource &ldquo;distributions&rdquo; for any country, has not the USA overextended itself at 300 million already in these &ldquo;golden years&rdquo; citizens versus Third World &ldquo;immigrants&rdquo; arguments?</p>
<p>For all the &ldquo;economic planning&rdquo; the Reds pride themselves on, this obvious failure does seem to be a poorly sanitized brainwash, even for them &ldquo;what is&rdquo; down on the collective farm.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

			<p>80%+ of the American public wants an immediate sealing of the borders with Mexico with all illegals returned.</p>
<p>80%+ of the American public wants an immediate withdrawal from the ever-deepening quagmire in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Neither of the presidential front-runners have shown any inclination to act on what the vast bulk of the voting public wants.</p>

			<p>Why should Obama and McCain bother to debate immigration when they agree?  Both want amnesty for illegals, both want to overpopulate the country and make whites a minority.  Bringing the matter up would only drive more people to &#8220;third party&#8221; candidates.  Chuck Baldwin of the Constitution Party is adamantly against illegal immigration.  He gets my vote.<br>

			<p>We don&rsquo;t have a Democracy and we never did. The founders of this great nation never intended for it to be a democracy because they understood that a democracy is a bad form of government ( mob rule). I don&rsquo;t know who decided to start calling it a democracy but our government was ment to be a representative republic. If the people actually had representation this would be a good thing but they don&rsquo;t. Only special interest groups have representation and this leaves most of us out in the cold. </p>
<p>You can waste your time voting if you wish but the fix is in no matter who wins and the Anerican public needs to understand this. We have a sham government that gives people a warm and fuzzy feeling because they think they are part of the decision making process but it&rsquo;s all just a joke. Again the fix is in.</p>
<p>The only thing to do with a rotten apple is to use it as fertilizer to grow new apples. The founders of our nation understood very well that the goverment would be rotten to the core in a matter of years and that a second and even third revolution would be necesssary if any sort of freedom were to be maintained. </p>
<p>A revolution is only a short term solution there is no long term solutions to the corrupting influence of power. </p>
<p>The American people have sold off their freedoms for safety and prosperity but soon they will have neither. Just go back and read the works of Franklin, Jefferson, Madison or almost anyone from the late 18th or early 19th century. People were a lot more realistic back then. </p>

			<p>Excellent post, Daniel!</p>
<p>Our two &#8220;presidential candidates&#8221; know only too well how the overwhelming majority of Americans feel about this Mexican invasion; yet, they&rsquo;re both willing to completely ignore the will of the American people.  This &#8220;fix&#8221; is in to the point that our &#8220;reps&#8221; no longer have to even pretend!</p>
<p>We stopped having a &#8220;representative republic&#8221; decades ago!  Our &#8220;representatives&#8221; have been hijacked by Big Business and Special Interest Groups, since these groups have the big-dollar funds they need to pay for their never-ending re-election campaigns!  </p>
<p>Just follow the money&hellip;</p>

It makes me sad&hellip;And aggravated that we&rsquo;ve been made impotent, and thus complicit in our own distruction.  Well, we are the fools.  One could argue that we deserve to be distroyed and then replaced by populations who are more adaptive (ie: less disposed to capitulating when threatened by &#8220;guilt&#8221;).<br>

			<p>The persistent trend of hispanics to be below the poverty line   &mdash;   even when they are fourth generation   &mdash;   has nothing to do the failures of integration.  Rather, it has to do with race, IQ and genetically determined behavior.  Hispanics can be here hundreds of years and, like the blacks who came before them, will continue to be a drain on our society and economy.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;When I leave the room I turn ON lights&#8221;  Oh my God! So do I. For almost the same reasons. I tell  my girlfriend that electricity was INVENTED to keep lights on, not off! And that we should be limiting USERS, not use!  I like to blaze the house up when I`m there. The one thing I can`t waste though  is gas. That scene in Battle of The Bulge made too much of an impression on me. The one where the Panzer commander and his adjutant dive in a ditch to avoid strafing planes. The NCO left the engine running. The Panzer Commander chastizes him saying, &#8220;Remember! Petrol is blood&hellip;&#8221; </p>

			<p>I remember reading a George Gilder book for the 1960&rsquo;s or 70&rsquo;s. He mentioned America&rsquo;s number one goal has got to be keeping Hispanics from following along with blacks down into a &#8216;black hole&rsquo; -if I may say. In truth, the entire world has fallen under the spell of black culture to one degree or another, for good or bad, but I do think there&rsquo;s been a bit of Hispanic racial consciousness emerging in regards to blacks. Maybe it&rsquo;s just an effort to have Hispanic girls keep their knees together, who knows, but a racial consciousness against &#8216;blacks&rsquo; is there to some degree. In the long term, politically, I do believe it will be blacks and hispancs against whites. Poor whites do often hate blacks more than their &#8216;capitalist oppressors&rsquo; and Hispanics really do reside under the thumb of evil affirmative action blacks, so maybe there&rsquo;s some &#8216;hope&rsquo; there. </p>

			<p>Could it be any clearer that human problems are no longer amendable through political manipulation?</p>
<p>Could it be any clearer that as an Institution it has simply outlived its usefulness. Even more so today, when the masses, coming from all directions, and looking at the State like a Parent, find sepertation from it unthinkable and intolerable - thereby ADDING to its problems by overloading it with quantity before it can modify its quality, ie; its ability to function as an Institution.</p>
<p>You want to know how I look at Government today as an Institution?  Do you remember that famous footage of a helicopter during the Fall of Saigon that couldn&rsquo;t get off the ground because there were too many people in it?</p>
<p>That.</p>

You&rsquo;re not only wrong,  Mr. Self-centered Hedonist,  you&rsquo;re immoral.  I found your post disgusting.  Even if you don&rsquo;t have children,  in your selfishness and your spite, you&rsquo;re doing harm to everyone else&rsquo;s grandchildren.  Not everyone is preparing for abject surrender, like you!</p>

Thanks, Daniel.  Good post.  So we have a government today that is not representative of  &#8220;The People&#8221; but of the special interests.  A bunch of paid, pandering hacks and  lifetime professional politicians fawning on the hands that feed them.  This is what the great experiment of Franklin and Jefferson has come to!   It was a noble try, worth preserving.    What can we do to salvage it?</p>

			<p>&ldquo;The will to &ldquo;avoid distasteful choices&rdquo;, is a sign that Americans don&rsquo;t care about the future, the fate of their heirs&hellip;&#8221;<br>

  &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;   <br>
That&rsquo;s very close, Bobby. But I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s so much that they don&rsquo;t care about the future   &mdash;    but rather, they don&rsquo;t even THINK about it.  They don&rsquo;t WANT to think about it because it&rsquo;s ugly and  painful, so they blot it out. They figure they&rsquo;ll cross that bridge when they come to it. Well, someone will have to cross it anyway, but they will be gone by then so it won&rsquo;t be their problem.</p>
<p>Maybe, too, it stems from a lack of any historical sense.  If you don&rsquo;t know the past, you can&rsquo;t envision the future.  Hence, as Old Vic says, they are living hedonistically for the moment, living beyond their means, without a thought to the future.</p>
