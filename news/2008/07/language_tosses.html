						<p>At the National Botanical Gardens, office windows are cracked, doors are broken and two greenhouses have collapsed in recent years.</p>
<p>The reason for the decrepitude is that the gardens lie in a Dutch-speaking part of Belgium, and French-speaking lawmakers won&rsquo;t approve the money for improvements.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just one of many signs that Belgium&rsquo;s perennial language time bomb is again approaching critical mass. It has plunged the country into a constitutional crisis that makes some wonder if Belgium can &mdash; or should &mdash; survive in its present rancorous jigsaw-puzzle shape.</p>
<p>Authorities in the Flemish towns of Zaventem and Vilvoorde limit social housing to Dutch-speakers; nearby Overijse encourages citizens to denounce shopkeepers who advertise in languages other than Dutch, and the mayor has sent letters to citizens asking them to take down signs in English or French.</p>
<p>The local council in Liedekerke drew widespread criticism for suggesting only Dutch-speaking kids could use municipal playgrounds.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the 1960s, when Belgium was cut up into separate language regions &mdash; leaving only Brussels officially bilingual &mdash; French-speakers in Linkebeek and five other Flemish towns outside the capital received special rights to use French in dealing with their local councils.</p>
<p>These towns have since become bedroom suburbs for French-speakers who work in Brussels, and Flemish authorities are fighting back by demanding that the towns conduct official business in Dutch only.</p>
<p>Linkebeek&rsquo;s Thiery and two other French-speaking mayors have refused to comply. Flemish authorities have blocked their nomination even though they were legally elected, leaving the local councils in legal limbo.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Flemish say &lsquo;you are on our territory, so you have no say,&rsquo;&#8221; complains Thiery. &#8220;The Flemish politicians have become more and more intolerant.&#8221;</p>
<p>At its heart, the quarrel is economic. Flanders is richer than French-speaking Wallonia, and resents its taxes going toward subsidizing a territory that is Belgium&rsquo;s rust belt with 15 percent unemployment, triple the rate in Flanders.</p>
<p>At the same time, they believe the influx of French-speaking commuters from Brussels is eroding their cultural heritage.</p>
<p>French-speakers say enough powers have been devolved, and accuse the Flemish of trying to cut Wallonia loose.</p>

			<p>I personally witnessed an incident that perfectly illustrates the enmity between the Flemish and French speaking Belgians.</p>
<p>I refer to an incident that occurred between May 8, 1945 when the German Army still several million strong, for the second time in one generation, laid down their arms in surrender, and May 11th when the demarcation lines between the British &amp; Soviet armies had solidified, during which time-period a number of German units crossed into our lines in order to escape being sent off to forced labour to rebuild what they had so wantonly destroyed.</p>
<p>Among those asylum-demanders escaping from what was coming to them, was a Belgian (mainly Flemish) Waffen-SS unit of the German Army, and of all British units to surrender to they happened upon my unit, a choice they soon had reason to regret for our battalion had a Belgian (mainly French) company attached to it whose grim-faced captain made it quite clear that they would deal with these traitors in their own fashion and would brook no interference from anyone.  </p>
<p>And what did the French-Belgians wearing British Army uniforms complete with Belgian insignia do to the Flemish-Belgians wearing German Army uniforms complete with Waffen-SS insignia?  Daft question that.  Our Belgians did to their Belgians what their Belgians would have done to our Belgians if the boot (hobnailed and iron-heeled) had been on the other foot (and believe me, it wasn&rsquo;t pretty).</p>
<p>And what did the rest of us do?  Nothing!  Those SS thugs had it coming.  Besides, it is never a good idea to get involved in other people&rsquo;s domestic disputes.</p>

			<p>I was taking a bus the other day and I noticed an ad with rainbow hued (immigrant, not tourist) children that had &#8220;Welcome!&#8221; written in a half dozen languages, one of which looked like Sanskrit  &mdash;  -I have no idea what the hell it was.  </p>
<p>If a difference in language can create a massive rift between peoples who are of the same bloodline (as it does in Canada, where I  &mdash;  -a person with a French surname and mainly French blood  &mdash;  -and many others of my ilk would sooner be shot than spend more than a short period of time in predominantly French speaking Quebec), then what does that say about the prospects for integrating different languages AND races together?  It&rsquo;s a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>If you want to move to an area, the LEAST you&rsquo;d better be willing to do is learn the language.</p>

			<p>Peoples who consider themselves different can not live together in harmony. Proven time and time again in many countries all over the world.<br>
American politicians are trying very hard to bring in as many different groups into the country, and they know full well that this will cause friction. Their intention is to further divide an already severely divided country. </p>

			<p>There is a lesson here for America. Two languages are FATAL to a country. Bilingualism is a disaster. Something for Americans to think about with the rapid growth of Spanish and the seeming creation of permanent (and growing) Spanish-speaking enclaves in much of America. Unilingualism is a core component of national identity and inner strength for any nation. Canada also suffers from a major French-language split. It would have been better off in every way if its Francophones had been assimilated in the nineteenth century. Bilingualism is a Trojan horse. America should BEWARE the creeping growth of Spanish.</p>

			<p>Belgium was never a real nation. It was an artificial creation of the Great Powers to check the power of a United Netherlands. It&rsquo;s dissolution would be a welcome development. </p>

			<p>In a recent post a European asked we cousins not to give up on them. I think the person was English. When I look to Europe I see the birthplace of my heritage. The slaughter we have inflicted upon ourselves over the ages leaves me feeling wretched. I wish all white people could drop their grievances and realize that it behooves us to start looking after each other. </p>

			<p>Seems to me, Flanders has more genuine complaints than Wallonia. I mean, if the French Wallonians are so worried about maintaining their culture - why not do it with their own blood, sweat, tears and money?</p>
<p>Same deal in Canada - the main leech on the body politic is Quebec (followed imo closely by the Maritimes)</p>

<p>Besides being a tiresome, depressingly trite WWII anecdote, I don&rsquo;t see your point.  The Flemish unit were attacked primarily for being Waffen-SS, not for simply being Flemish.  </p>

Interesting post -  From what I learned while living in former Yugoslavia for a few years in the late &rsquo;90s, there was a great deal of vengeance going on against collaborators everywhere in the years just after the war.  In Yugoslavia, it was a actual civil war.  In France, it was a bit like a medeival witch hunt or a second reign of terror.  What I understood is that in both places many scores between families or rivals - scores that had existed even before the war - were &#8220;settled&#8221; during this time. <br>

			<p>Here is a great example of how Whites can&rsquo;t even get along with each other.  There are many White Americans that want all the non-whites out of the US and yet you can&rsquo;t even get along with other Whites.  The fact is, that even if the USA was an all White nation people will find something different to fight about. </p>

<p>That, by definition is a war crime. And by quietly looking on, you became an accomplice.</p>
<p>Yes, Allied POWs were also murdered by German units. True. But the leaders of those units were later dealt with by war crime tribunals &hellip; and usually hanged.</p>
<p>How many Allied officers were prosecuted for war crimes after WWII? None   &mdash;   and it wasn&rsquo;t because our side didn&rsquo;t commit any. Our crimes were quietly forgotten or never even reported, like the one you witnessed. I suspect if we added up the deaths from our forgotten or unreported war crimes, the total would be surprisingly high.</p>
<p>Remember, the war crime tribunals were conducted on the principle of equal and fair punishment for any transgressor. If that principle was a sham, they deserve no place of honor in our history books. <br>

<p>You&rsquo;re absolutely right.  I was born and raised in Cape Breton, and while I come from a set of hard working, welfare loathing family lines, those lines are clearly rarer than they should be on this coast.  Many people here have a tendency to blame their sometimes less-than-ideal stations in life on the &#8220;have&#8221; provinces (there&rsquo;s an almost visceral hatred in some for the city of Toronto), instead of taking any type of real responsibility for their own lives.  It&rsquo;s depressing and embarrassing.</p>

<p>True to your handle - unable to see that everyone has a right to wish to maintain their culture and the French were in Canada before the British.  Isn&rsquo;t that a great deal of what this site is about - White cultural survival - or don&rsquo;t French Canadians count as Whites in your book?</p>
<p>As far as the blood, sweat and tears go, I can&rsquo;t see where Quebecois or Wallonians haven&rsquo;t given their share throughout history.  You must be referring to the rock band, which always did their music in English.</p>
<p>As a student of European culture for life, what I perceive is the confusion and brainwashing via the old Roman Church against the North.  Rome conquered and occupied as much of what was north of them as they could and when the ancient empire fell, the Roman Catholic Church took over.  By the time the North rebelled against it, Christianity was too entrenched - it having stamped out by any and all means, the religions of the indigenous whites - so they came up with Protestantism and all the joys that has brought.  It has gone on for so long that the players hardly recognize the causes, citing culture and language as problems, not perceiving they are actors in a long extinct, but still damaging empire&rsquo;s death throws.  The sooner all Europeans and those of European descent throw off Christianity and the cultural damage it continues to do in Europe through its divisive nature (Son shall rise up against father and brother shall fight brother) along with its penchant for martydom, the better the chances for White survival will be.  Let others die for their religions!</p>

			<p>Language is the greatest cohesion to any culture. Civilized advanced nations are built around common language. Language is vital to survival common laws.  How else can a people and legal system survive??   This is why more than one language always decreases cohesion and often tears civil obediance apart.<br>
Language defines behaviors and patterns of thinking. The first act of destruction of a nation is to include different languages.<br>
Dilution of language/vocabulary reduces the abilites of common people to communicate advanced thoughts. It was those advanced ideas that created the USA Constitution.  V</p>

Excellent advice.  We should have followed it. <br>
Didn&rsquo;t we get involved in Europe&rsquo;s  &#8220;domestic dispute&#8221;?</p>
