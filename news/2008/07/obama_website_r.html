<h1>Obama Website Riles Muslims</h1>
					<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Beth Reinhard, Miami Herald, July 6, 2008</i></p>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Vanessa Alikhan was at a Democratic &#8220;unity party&#8221; when she overheard another guest indignantly refute the rumor that Barack Obama is Muslim, as if it were a racial slur. She later recounted the conversation to a friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;She told me that this is politics and that I should just deal with it,&#8221; said Alikhan, a Fort Lauderdale graphic artist who converted to Islam about five years ago. &#8220;To me this is the same as telling an African American or a Jewish person they should deal with discrimination because people aren&rsquo;t ready to embrace them as a group.&#8221;</p>
<p>She and other American Muslims are speaking out, as the Obama campaign pushes back on widely e-mailed and patently false claims that he is tied to Islamic terrorists. The rumor could be particularly damaging in a must-win state like Florida, which has a large Jewish population.</p>
<p>{snip} While Muslim leaders understand the campaign&rsquo;s responsibility to counter misinformation, they say the classification of being Muslim as a &#8220;smear&#8221; goes too far.</p>
<p>Their outrage peaked when the Obama campaign asked two women wearing head scarves to move away from the candidate &mdash; and the television cameras &mdash; at a rally last month in Detroit. Obama personally apologized to the women, but the incident reflected the difficulties of balancing hard-nosed political calculations with the campaign&rsquo;s overall message of change and unity.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But some Muslim leaders said Obama needs to do more to make it clear that he welcomes their support in his campaign. Though he&rsquo;s spoken at many churches and synagogues &mdash; including a conservative congregation in Boca Raton &mdash; he has never visited a mosque, said Altaf Ali, executive director of the South Florida chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. There are between 200,000 and 400,000 Muslims in Florida and about seven million nationwide.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Saif Ishoof, president of the Center for Voter Advocacy, a nonpartisan group that educates Muslims about the political process, said Republican John McCain also needs to show more sensitivity.</p>
<p>Ishoof, a lifelong Republican, said he bristles when McCain consistently refers to &#8220;Islamic terrorists.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Though the Muslim community pales in comparison to other religious voting blocs in Florida, Ishoof noted that it is concentrated in central Florida, the battleground region of the state.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Muslim voters could make the difference in several states crucial to winning the White House, including Michigan, Ohio and Virginia.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every vote is going to be critical,&#8221; Ishoof said.</p>

<p>Well then, what are they? They&rsquo;re NOT Islamic?  Are they Buddhists? Zoroastrians? Wiccans? What are they, Ishoof? Why don&rsquo;t these people get it? We Do Not want a Muslim president.  </p>

			<p>All of the offended Muslims should not vote for Obama. That is the best solution, in my eyes. </p>

			<p>A big problem with a country that has no national unity or identity is that whenever you take a position, you are bound to offend a segment of society.</p>

			<p>I knew this was coming when a news story about Obama&rsquo;s web site &#8220;Stop the Smears dot com&#8221; had this item to refute  &mdash;   &#8220;Obama is a Muslim.&#8221;  That&rsquo;s a smear?</p>
<p>For normal Americans, it would indeed be a &#8220;smear&#8221; to say a non-Muslim is a Muslim. But in ultra-sensitive Democratic Political Correctness Land, you can&rsquo;t imply that there is anythning wrong with being a Muslim.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t understand offended muslims who should be groveling for forgiveness for the evil caused by their brethran in this foolish religion. Our world seems like &#8216;Alice in Wonderland&rsquo; topsy turvy fantasy land. I am offended when &#8216;Islamic terrorists&rsquo;<br>
kill innocent people. And no, they are muslims who adhere to Islam and therefore called Islamic terrorists. We would call them &#8216;Buddhist terrorist monks&rsquo; if they were running around blowing up people.</p>

			<p>The religion of perpetual outrage are killing non-muslims throughout the world.  They (Islamists) are responsibility for death and destruction in all 21 wars currently raging worldwide.</p>
<p>I have no use for Islam, they are haters and have no intentions of of peace. </p>

			<p>If the term used is &#8220;Radical Muslim&#8221;, it cannot be called a smear.  It is a fact of life that these are crazy murderers intent on taking over the World.  Incidentally, in England a woman has just been jailed for 3 years for helping a radical Muslim bomber escape justice by dressing him as a woman in a Bhurka.   He was one involved in the bus bombings in London</p>

			<p>Wonderful! Another group comes to understand just WHY so many White Americans think of him as &#8220;PHONY OBAMA.&#8221; He changes his church(es). or story, to suit the occasion. This carricature of a human being is supposed to be the great leader bringing change to America? I&rsquo;d just as soon hang my socks up and wait for Santa Claus to come and fill them.</p>

			<p>The young people of this country have no idea what&rsquo;s coming after they vote for the Obamination. Hugh Hewitt does; however, and even wrote a pamphlet titled &#8216;Letter to a Young Obama Supporter&rsquo;.
