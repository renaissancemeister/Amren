<h1>Black Soldiers Get Apology for WWII Convictions</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, July 27, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Army formally apologized Saturday for the wrongful conviction of 28 black soldiers accused of rioting and lynching an Italian prisoner of war in Seattle more than six decades ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had not done right by these soldiers,&#8221; Ronald James, assistant secretary of the Army for manpower and reserve affairs, said Saturday. &#8220;The Army is genuinely sorry. I am genuinely sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Relatives of the soldiers joined elected officials, military officers and one of the defense lawyers to hear James give the apology before hundreds of people in a meadow near the old Fort Lawton parade grounds and chapel in Discovery Park.</p>
<p>In addition, the soldiers&rsquo; convictions were set aside, their dishonorable discharges were changed to honorable discharges and they and their survivors were awarded back pay for their time in the brig.</p>
<p>All but two of the soldiers are dead. One, Samuel Snow of Leesburg, Fla., planned to attend the ceremony but wound up in the hospital instead because of a problem with his pacemaker.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dozens were injured in the melee that started with a scuffle between an Italian prisoner of war and a black soldier from the segregated barracks near the POW housing. A POW, Guglielmo Olivotto, was found hanged at the bottom of a bluff the next day.</p>
<p>The Army prosecutor was Leon Jaworski, who went on to become special prosecutor in the Watergate scandal of the early 1970s.</p>
<p>Forty-three black soldiers were charged with rioting and three also were charged with murder. Two defense lawyers were assigned to the case and given two weeks to prepare without ever being shown an Army investigation criticizing the way the riot was handled.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the ensuing trial 28 men were convicted.</p>

			<p>As  a  follow up  to the  first  comment by briton. here is  a  description of  one  of  the crimes committed  by  a  black private named William  harrison Jnr. for which he was duly and deservedly hanged. <br>
&#8220;William Harrison sexually assaulted and strangled 7 year old Patricia Wylie in Killycolpy Co. Tyrone, Northern Ireland. Patricia was the daughter of a couple who had shown friendship to him. On the pretext of buying them a thank you present he took Patricia shopping with him on the afternoon of September the 26th 1944. His trial took place on the 18th of November 1944 and he was hanged on the 7th of April 1945.&#8221;<br>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t this so often the case!  This story is so time-worn, you could just change the names and dates and it would fit so many other like cases.  </p>
<p>More gullible, well-meaning whites!  And, generation after generation, they never learn. Not until it&rsquo;s too late, that is.</p>
<p>And    &mdash;    it has to be said!   &mdash;    one reason they never learn is because of the media, which desperately tries to suppress or minimize such stories.</p>

			<p>The interchange of characters in the story could be so much so that you could even place a white perpetrator in place of William Harrison and still have a story that has unfortunately happened time-and-time again in the past. &#8220;Gullible, well-meaning&#8221; people should think twice about who they bring into their lives and into their homes - period - especially when there are children at home.</p>
