<p>In an infamous 1931 case, several black youths were arrested in Alabama and charged with raping two white women. Those young men &mdash; eventually called the Scottsboro Boys &mdash; could have been executed for the crime. Newspapers throughout the south wrote about the case as if the defendants&rsquo; innocence was inconceivable. It perfectly fit the reigning stereotypes &mdash; white women were virtuous and black men were vicious sexual predators.</p>
<p>As it turned out, the accusers had lied. The women were sure they could play on the prejudices of law-enforcement officials to cover up their own indiscretions, so they made up a story. Good work by dedicated defense attorneys ripped apart the prosecution&rsquo;s case and the defendants were freed.</p>
<p>The Duke lacrosse case of 2006 &mdash; 07 mirrored the Scottsboro incident. A black woman, Crystal Mangum, hired as a stripper (almost always referred to in the media as an &#8220;exotic dancer&#8221;) at a party thrown by the captains of the Duke University lacrosse team, showed up so drunk that she passed out after just a few minutes. Later, to avoid possible legal consequences from her drunkenness &mdash; she had two young children &mdash; she told a nurse that she had been raped at the party. The nurse, eager to credit the story, said that some of Crystal&rsquo;s injuries were consistent with rape.</p>
<p>After that, the case grew like a wildly malignant cancer. A police official with an animosity toward Duke students got his hooks into the case and drove it relentlessly, but never with any interest in finding out what actually occurred. Then the district attorney, Mike Nifong, a white man who desperately wanted to win favor with the predominantly black electorate in Durham, seized on the case as his salvation. He never bothered to investigate the accuser&rsquo;s veracity &mdash; she told several different and inconsistent versions of the alleged crime &mdash; but instead took to calling her &#8220;my victim.&#8221; Flagrantly violating prosecutorial rules, he rushed to indict three Duke lacrosse players.</p>
<p>The media had a field day with the case. Story after story in papers ranging from the New York Times to the Durham Herald-Sun excoriated the accused players with ideologically tendentious pieces that presumed not just guilt but racism. Yet that was nothing compared to the academic left on campus &mdash; Duke&rsquo;s and many others. To leftist professors, the case seemed to be the perfect validation of their worldview that America&rsquo;s evils stem from oppression on the basis of race, gender, and class. Their speeches and articles seethed with righteous indignation over the alleged crime.</p>
<p><cite>Until Proven Innocent</cite> is a thorough recounting of the case by veteran political columnist Stuart Taylor and Brooklyn College history professor KC (Robert) Johnson. In exasperating detail we learn about the shoddy police work and abuses of prosecutorial power by DA Nifong. By the time Taylor and Johnson reach the climax of the story &mdash; Nifong&rsquo;s disbarment and removal from office &mdash; readers will yearn for condign justice to be meted out to the many villains of the piece.</p>
<p>Alas, there was no justice for the Duke officials who went along with the lynch mob, nor for the professors who eagerly pronounced guilt and demanded punishment of students who had committed no crime at all. The authors make it clear that in the minds of many of those academics, the concept of guilt has little to do with individual conduct. White male students from well-to-do families are necessarily complicit in the whole oppressive, exploitative class structure of America, so punishing some of them is good, whether or not they actually committed any crime.</p>
<p>One big lesson from the book is how poorly our justice system works. Police and prosecutors often have their own agendas and will obliterate the truth if it suits them. Perhaps the fact that the vicious Nifong has been disbarred and branded as a criminal himself for lying in court will cause prosecutors to think twice before trying to railroad defendants into prison just to make themselves look good. But maybe they&rsquo;ll think it was just a fluke that he got caught.</p>
<p>The other big lesson is that many university professors who incessantly proclaim their dedication to &#8220;social justice&#8221; don&rsquo;t care a whit about true justice. Even after the case unraveled as a hoax, many of them continued to defend their previous statements, claiming that &#8220;the narrative&#8221; about how dominant classes oppress the subservient classes must remain vital.</p>
<p>What the case demonstrates, however, is that injustice doesn&rsquo;t fall along the lines of race, class, and gender. It falls along different lines &mdash; those who wield coercive power and those who don&rsquo;t. Thus the book not only tells a crucial story, but also supports the libertarian critique of modern society.<br>

			<p>Dept. of Justice statistics state that in 2005 over 37,000 white women were raped by black men in the U.S., and virtually ZERO black women were raped by white men!</p>
<p><a href="/bjs/pub/pdf/cvus/current/cv0542.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/cvus/current/cv0542.pdf</a></p>
<p>But didn&rsquo;t that ZERO black woman who was (not) raped by white men get a lot of media attention, and didn&rsquo;t the 37,000 white women who WERE raped by blacks get very little (virtually ZERO, in fact!) media attention?</p>
<p>But please, don&rsquo;t all you &#8220;racists&#8221; misunderstand the significance of the DOJ stats. They show that white men are racist and black men aren&rsquo;t. White racism keeps white men from having any interest in black women, and black men harbor no such racist prejudices against white women.</p>
<p>P.S. Don&rsquo;t be surprised if in 40 years many people vaguely recall that there was a notorious rape of a black woman by white athletes at Duke. Despite the claims of white &#8220;racists&#8221; 40 years hence that such a rape never happened.<br>

<p><br>
But the biggest villain, without which all the other villainy would not exist, will never receive justice - black voters -  unless we can someday, somehow take away the right to vote that they&rsquo;ve shown, time and time again, they don&rsquo;t deserve.</p>

			<p>We need to do a better job of bringing these things to public awareness.  If every white knew about black crime, as it happened and it became impossible to cover it up, only a few short years would pass before every black and every liberal was swinging from a gallows.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ignorance, not apathy that is the problem.</p>

			<p>A bit off-topic but worth mentioning. This whole farce would never have become the media-circus it did if the stripper had been White. There is a lesson here. If your going to have a stag, frat party or whatever and your going to have some strippers there, MAKE SURE THEY ARE WHITE.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s around 200 black women that are raped by white men every year in the USA. When you look at the campus environment, and this Duke case, you&rsquo;d think a lot more than 200 would be accused of rape.</p>
<p>Looking at the numbers, any given black male is around 600 times more likely to commit one of these interracial rapes. That should prove of interest to those ever busy uncovering racial stats. The difference between the Duke rapists and the Scottsboro boys is that black men really are raping white women in significant numbers. It would take more than a few fictional stories like &#8216;To kill a mockingbird&rsquo; to cover up - well, invert, this fact. Well, maybe not. </p>

			<p>There are some notable differences.  </p>
<p>In the Scottsboro case, two of the black men confessed and one of the black men claimed the other black men were guilty.  So when you have a confession, is it really a surpise they would be charged? I don&rsquo;t think there is much of a comparison to the Duke case.  Also, the author has to go back to 1931. Whenever whites refer to black crime they never have to refer back eight decades. </p>
<p>In the Duke case they accused steadfastly maintained they were innocent.  They agreed to answer any questions the police had.  They even offered to meet with the prosecutor and answer any questions he had.  One of the accused could even prove he wasn&rsquo;t at the party.  He proved by security photo and security card recorder, he was in his dorm.  In the Duke case the stripper had no credibility whatsoever.  Every inconsistency was quickly covered up and attributed to her being traumatized.  But photos taken during her visit and while she was leaving the party showed her laughing broadly.  She accused the second stripper of taking part in the rape by holding her down.  The accusor said she had no sex other than the rapes.  But DNA evidence showed she had sex not with those she was accusing but with black men who were acquaintances of hers.  The whole thing was obviously a farce. </p>

			<p>The media tried desperately to &#8220;prove&#8221; that White males are racist rapists. That way they could get points with the race-hucksters AND the feminazis. They failed here, but will keep on trying.</p>

			<p>IF you are just catching on to the fact there is No Real Justice in Life Period, you must have a very low IQ? But white people in general have let these minorities get away with too much too long, will we ever wise up? Who Knows. They often think.. Well it don&rsquo;t affect me so who cares if my white brothers and sisters get dumped on.. but my friend by the time it does affect you.</p>

			<p>There is a common thread to almost every single rape hoax of the last 40 years. In every one of these cases there is a &#8220;Rape Nurse&#8221; assigned to the case who will say that, as the article stated, the accuser&rsquo;s &#8220;injuries were consistent with rape.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the early &#8216;70&rsquo;s when radical feminist pressure groups started demanding that every rape accusation be treated as gospel, law enforcement repeatedly said that they couldn&rsquo;t do that because their records showed that 15% of accusations were false. That&rsquo;s false mind you, not unfounded, many more cases showed that the accuser was probably lying but it couldn&rsquo;t be proven that she was.</p>
<p>The feminists insisted that rape accusations were no different than any other accusation and the &#8220;false report&#8221; percentage was consistent with all other crimes, which was - and is - 2%.</p>
<p>Since that time false reports of rapes - particularly where White men are the accused - hover around 60%.</p>
<p>These &#8220;rape nurses&#8221; know this yet every exam they conduct comes back positive. Clearly they are either incompetent or they have an agenda.</p>

			<p>I have always believed that the Scottsboro boys were guilty as charged.</p>
<p>(1) The Scottsboro boys invaded a box car containing 2 white girls and several white boys.  They immediately threw the white boys off the train.  There was no confrontation, no words exchanged, the feral predators just attacked.</p>
<p>(2) The Scottsboro boys admitted sex took place but said that the girls immediately offered themselves to the Scottsboro boys.</p>
<p>(3) Medical exams proved that the girls had sperm deposited in them in the hours between when the white boys were thrown off the train and the train was stopped.</p>
<p>I arrived at the conclusion that the Scottsboro boys were guilty when I began work in law enforcement and quickly realized that with blacks only 10 percent of the population of my county, they committed more than 99 percent of the rapes.  In 15 years of having a rape case load, I honestly cannot remember a white, hispanic, or asian rapist.</p>
<p>Consider that the communist party of the United States quickly took up the cause.  The reason was to raise money for the party.  The ruble was so low against other currencies that the Commitentern ordered the non Russian parties to raise their own money as rubles could not be exchanged for other currencies.</p>
<p>American communists found that the easiest way to raise money was to find a criminal case, set up a Legal defense fund and committee, use a bit of the money for the criminal case and funnel the bulk of money raised into the communist party funds.</p>
<p>The defense lawyers cost nothing.  Most were communists or fellow travelers who had been told not to join the party but work for it as an ostensible outsider. Nearly all were the sons of the &#8220;white alien&#8221; russians who invaded the country between 1980 and 1924 when thank God!!! the anti immigration McCarran act was passed</p>
<p>In the twenties we had Sacco Vanzetti (guilty as charged). In the thirties we had the Scottsboro boys (guilty as charged).  </p>
<p>In the forties we had the Sleepy Lagoon case.  Some hispanic gangsters in E. Los Angeles had a major battle.  Several were murdered and dumped in a lagoon in a city park.  The police had lots of informers in the gangs.  They soon arrested the murderers.  The local communists ranted and raved about the evil white police, ignoriing the hispanics who murdered other hispanics for disrespecting them.  The local communist party made a fortune out of the legal defense fund.</p>
<p>Last but not least, there were 6 Scottsboro boys.  But the communist party had 8 Scottsboro boys Mothers touring the country to raise money for the defense and the CPUSA.</p>

			<p>The so-called Duke rape case mainly proves two things:</p>
<p>One, the criminal justice system often has no particular interest in justice, only in politically popular convictions. As a correlary to this point, District Attorneys and other judicial system officials should be appointed, not elected.</p>
<p>Two, higher &#8220;education&#8221; has become a perverse farce consisting mainly of Marxist, feminist, sexist, and various other istic indoctrination schemes.</p>
<p>Were I a parent with a student at Duke when this story broke I would have yanked him/her off that campus instantly.  And were I an athlete on scholarship at Duke I would have dropped out and gone elsewhere.  And finally, were I either the parent of a high-school senior or the student himself, Duke would not get a nano-second of consideration as my school of choice.</p>

			<p>I always felt the stripper/hooker should have been sent to prision for her lie. Sure, they found evidence she had sex with several men from the DNA, but none of it matched the accused. She was looking for a fast buck, and nearly destroyed 3 lives because of it. Plus, forced the parents to pay enormous court costs to defend their sons. Even today, Tawana Brawley&rsquo;s Mother still complains her family never got rich from the story. I&rsquo;m glad it all finally caught up with Nifong, but a lot of other people have skated clean for nearly destroying these students and athletes. Our PC society is all too willing to throw away due process, and forget about (innocent until proven guilty), if the accuser is black, and the accused is white. All too ironic, when most crimes are black on white.</p>

<p>No, the DOJ statistics estimate actually ZERO black women raped by white men in 2005. (I&rsquo;m not certain beyond any possible doubt, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure you&rsquo;re interpreting the statistical footnote to the datum incorrectly).</p>

<p><br>
Duke (RAPISTS) VS Scottsboro (BOYS)? It was bad enough the 3 Duke students were being called rapists, before the case even went to trial. But now that the whole world knows the truth about Nifong, and the promiscuous and unclean stripper who slept with several men (including her driver)before even arriving at the frat party. The case was dismissed, and Nifong was disbarred. So call them Duke Boy&rsquo;s, young men, students, or athletes! But don&rsquo;t call them rapists. <br>
