<h1><a href="http://www6.comcast.net/articles/news-politics/20080701/Hispanic.Voters/">Hispanic Voters Gaining Strength in Key States</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, July 1, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Voting by Hispanics surged in the last congressional elections, showing strength that could swing this year&rsquo;s presidential vote in closely contested states like Colorado, Nevada and New Mexico.</p>
<p>A government report released Tuesday shows that 5.6 million Hispanics voted in the 2006 general election, an increase of 18 percent over 2002, the previous year for a federal election without a presidential race on the ballot. That compares to a 7 percent increase among white voters and a 5 percent increase for black voters.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Luis Vera, general counsel for the League of United Latin American Citizens, or LULAC] said the debate over illegal immigration has energized Hispanic voters, a trend he expects to continue this year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hispanics made up only 6 percent of American voters in 2006, according to the report by the Census Bureau. But their numbers are big enough to be decisive in several battleground states, especially in a tight race.</p>
<p>Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico and Florida all have a significant number of Hispanic voters. President Bush narrowly won all four states in 2004, and they could all be hotly contested this year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hispanics, long considered part of the Democratic base, have become swing voters in recent elections. President Bush did well among Hispanic voters in his two presidential victories. But many swung back to the Democrats in 2006, when many Republicans staked out tough positions against illegal immigration. The Democrats regain control of both houses of Congress.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A recent AP-Yahoo News poll showed that Obama leads McCain among Hispanics, 47 percent to 22 percent with 26 percent undecided.</p>
<p>Still, Obama, who is trying to become the first black president, doesn&rsquo;t have a lock on the Hispanic vote. During the Democratic primary, Hispanics preferred rival Hillary Rodham Clinton to Obama by nearly 2-to-1.</p>
<p>The Census data comes from a national survey which asks 50,000 residents after each federal election whether they were registered to vote and whether they voted. The survey does not ask about candidate preferences or political affiliations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Just looking at the demographics, whichever party ends up winning the Latino vote will be the majority party in the 21st century,&#8221; Rosenberg [Simon Rosenberg, head of a think tank called NDN, formerly the New Democrat Network] said.</p>

I think you&rsquo;re right, Roman Holiday.  This exactly the way the liberal/neocon alliance is playing it.  These ghouls want to destroy the American middle class, and they are using Mestizos to help accomplish their insidious goal. </p>

			<p>Although it definitely sucks demographically, I will say I still would prefer life in the southwest over the East Coast.  The reason is quite obvious..very few blacks.  Go to Albuquerque/El Paso and see how many black enclaves there are..NONE!  So even if you put into perspective the high mestizo/native population, the violent crime isn&rsquo;t what it could be.  Just because a place looks like a dump in someplace like Ajo AZ doesn&rsquo;t mean the violent crime is higher than a cesspit like Pine Hills, FL despite the manicured lawns.  Remember that east coast people!!!</p>
<p>Also look at the white numbers in most southwestern cities..they&rsquo;re actually higher than alot of places in the east.  Plus alot of the mestizos in NM/AZ are from there originally and many share more in common with whites than ghetto people.  I&rsquo;d even argue american bred hispanics hate illegals more than your average white when you get more than an hour north of the border.  Of course you have your share of homies, but after being in FL I&rsquo;d rather deal them and their shaved monkey heads over a bunch of blacks who are so volatile regarding random victims it&rsquo;s scary.</p>

			<p>Liberals and elitists must have the Scarlet O&rsquo;Hara syndrome- <br>
&#8216;I won&rsquo;t think about it now. I&rsquo;ll think about it tomorrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But, that tomorrow will never come because once all of this nonsense was started, there&rsquo;s no end in sight. They must think all that is destroying the middle-class would never impact their lives. (I wonder if their children will feel the same.) I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ve never had to experience what they&rsquo;re throwing on the rest of the country. </p>
<p>(I&rsquo;d rather be the bitter, pessimistic, conservative-like-my-daddy, God-fearing, young female from the South that I am rather than to be a useless, unknowing, diversity-loving, spineless liberal&hellip;&hellip;. Anyday and twice on Sunday!)</p>

			<p>&#8220;American Renaissance readers, please explain to me why either the liberals or neo-cons want to destroy the middle class? I am not questioning, I really want to know.&#8221; </p>
<p>There are many reasons that several groups are working overtime to destroy the middle class, but here are a few of them:</p>
<p>Liberals dislike white people because of our race&rsquo;s history of colonialism, segregation, etc.  They feel we as a race must make amends for any injustices our ancestors perpetrated on non-whites.  Since whites make up most of the middle class, destroying it would force most whites to become poor, less powerful politically and perhaps lower our perceived status as a group.  (Won&rsquo;t work for me!  I will always think the white race is fabulous and magnificent, even if we have to wear rags while working on a chain gang!  But I digress &hellip; .)  </p>
<p>Liberals feel that everything whites have achieved in this world must be because of white privilege.  They want to suppress us as they lift up non-whites to our level of achievement.  They don&rsquo;t want to believe there are actual differences in temperament, I.Q., altruism, ambition, creativity, etc. between the races, as we all developed on different continents with different challenges through the centuries.  The races are not exactly the same.)</p>
<p> <br>
As far as neocons, they want to destroy the middle class (aka whites) in order that our country will have a large population of &#8220;serfs&#8221; who the elite can then hire and pay minimal wages to.  This will maximize the wealthy elite&rsquo;s money and power, similar to Mexico&rsquo;s situation where the upper class are super rich and live like kings, there is a small middle class, and vast legions of poor.  </p>
<p>Those who want to eliminate us are doing so by making us poorer (raising taxes, sending manufacturing jobs overseas, importing foreigners for the remaining jobs, upsetting the trade balance which raises our national debt) and by flooding our land with non-whites who often resent us, are uneducated and crime-prone, and have many more babies than we do.</p>
<p>Also, I think Marxism is playing a large role, but I&rsquo;ll chat about that one later!</p>

<p>A positive outcome of this scenario however is, we can all carry guns openly, wear fatigues and gun down our rivals or neighbors and that can&rsquo;t be all bad&hellip;..can it?</p>

			<p>Maybe these liberals and open-borders activists should have something to do besides try to destroy our country and white people.<br>
I&rsquo;ve been poor. My husband and I worked 25 hours a day, 8 days a week to pull ourselves out of the poverty we were born in and work our way up into the middle class and give our children a better life. We did it! Thank God we were born white Americans with the ambition and brains to do it. <br>
Now these liberals are trying their level best to drag our grandchildren back down, dumb down the schools and reserve all the jobs for the minorities. <br>
I&rsquo;m sure there are many like us out there who are absolutely outraged at the wild left turn this once great nation has taken. WE HAVE TO TAKE BACK OUR COUNTRY OR WE ARE DOOMED!<br>
If it takes building a fence, stopping all immigration, deporting all the illegals and their multitudinous offspring, and locking up all the predators, so be it. White people are tired of taking care of everybody else first!</p>

<p>  Friendly white person this is an excellent summary of the views of our privileged elite. I couldn&rsquo;t agree more.  </p>

			<p>11:21 PM and Friendly White Person: Most liberals are ignorant puppets, they may repeat that White guilt nonsense, but few of them are willing to put their own kids in a school with more than a sprinkling of Blacks or Cholos.  And the puppet masters, the creators of those anti-White lies, don&rsquo;t believe a word of it.  Multiculturalism is simply a way to conquer what was once the wealthiest and most free nation on Earth, a means to get control of the people and extract their wealth.  By replacing the Whites with a variety of other races, the traditional rights of Americans will fade away, as they come to be seen as archaic and alien by the usurping peoples.  Try to convince a Chinese or a Mexican that the right to speak your mind outweighs any interest of the government.  It&rsquo;s hard enough to get real Americans to respect that principle sometimes, the foreigners will never buy it.  But when we Whites are reduced to a small, hated, minority, nothing will stand in the way of the sort of power-crazed people who rule most of the world already.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;Hispanics could determine election outcome in Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico.&#8221;</p>
<p>If anybody really believes that is true, I&rsquo;d like them to run for office in any of those areas without the white vote and see if they could win.</p>
<p>Too, let them run without the 2nd amendment advocates and see how far they get.</p>
<p>I think whenever the MSM bring up some leftist group like Hispanics, blacks, feminist women, etc., stating that it is they a politician must have to win, what they&rsquo;re doing really is trying to inculcate into people&rsquo;s minds, and the minds of the politicians themselves, that these groups HAVE to be catered to And that they are so powerful it is only their vote that is important.</p>
<p>If whites ever unite, these kinds of statements will be dead forever, because NOBODY will win without the white vote, erxcept those few areas that are controlled by non-whites.</p>

			<p>This story lucidly explains the antics of McCain and Obama in kissing up to La Raza and the other illegal immigration advocacy groups. Shamelessly playing up to, pandering to these groups.</p>
<p>One question, if you please:  Given the reality illegals are loaded with false documentation, what&rsquo;s to keep illegals from the voting booths? Even NPR RADIO, that bastion of misguided liberality brought this up a couple of years back. Since corruption, crime and theft is so much a part of the Hispanic/Mexican culture, is it really unreasonable to assume voter fraud to also be part of their many undesirable tendencies as a racial group?</p>

&#8220;&hellip;why either the liberals or neo-cons want to destroy the middle class? I am not questioning, I really want to know&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>Posted by at 11:21 PM on July 2 </p>
<p>Friendly White Person Writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Liberals feel that everything Whites have achieved in this world must be because of White privilege&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I would add this to your fine post:</p>
<p>Non-Whites feel that everything Whites have achieved in this world has been stolen from them (non-Whites) or achieved at their expense; or as they like to wrongly cry:  &#8220;This country was created on the backs of blacks on browns!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This couldn&rsquo;t be further from the truth.</p>
<p>I believe three of the most damaging measures to American Whites, handed down by the courts, were the following : </p>
<p>1.) Disparate Impact (Griggs vs. Duke Power, 1971):   Roughly, the idea that if blacks do not score the same as Whites on tests, the tests are therefore racist and invalid.  Equal outcome for all, in other words.  This flows out of pseudo-science such as that promulgated by Stephen Jay Gould (all races have equal IQs), the Frankfurt School and Franz Boas (race is a social construct).  Dadeleas wrote a wonderful post about this a few days ago.</p>
<p>http://www.vdare.com/fulford/071023_fulford_file.htm</p>
<p>2.)  Brown vs. Board of Education:  The beginnings of Legislation by Judicial Fiat  &mdash;   tyrannical, often unelected judges handing down decisions that they &#8216;feel&rsquo; are right rather than interpreting existing law.  This decision directly led to the destruction of White communities and schools through forced busing.</p>
<p>Jared Taylor writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Judicial orders should never preempt law-making by elected representatives; republican government has been badly eroded by the process set in motion by Brown&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p> <a href="/ar/2004/07.html" rel="nofollow">/ar/2004/07/</a></p>
<p>3.) Hart-Celler Act/INS Act of 1965:  Remember, Ted Kennedy was the Front Man for the operation.  I believe this legislation, against the wishes of the American people, was the single most destructive thing ever to happen to the White middle class.  This act opened up the immigration floodgates to third-world non-Whites and has changed the demographics of the US, permanently and disastrously. Because of this one act, Whites in the US, the country they created, will be a minority by 2050  &mdash;  or sooner as many predict.</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;Since the 1965 Immigration Act went into effect, more than 30 million immigrants, most from non-European, Third World countries have poured into the United States. Today, most of the U.S. population growth is due to these immigrants&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>Professor McDonald has plenty to say as well, especially about those who believe a White majority will inevitably lead to the rise of a Fourth Reich:</p>

<p>I know there are other reasons as to the decline of Whites in the US, but I think those are the main ones.  I strongly suggest you read the vdare.com and amren.com articles linked above for better and lengthier answers to your query.</p>

			<p>Everytime I hear a commment on Hispanics determining the outcome of upcoming national elections it makes no sense to me. &#8220;Most&#8221; hispanics are not eligable to vote because they are either:</p>
<p>1)Too young </p>
<p>2)are here illegally </p>
