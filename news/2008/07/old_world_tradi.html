<p>The quinceañera &mdash; quince años, meaning 15 years &mdash; is a ritual in Mexico and some Central American countries. And as more immigrants from Spanish-speaking nations settle in Tennessee and Georgia, they have brought such Old Country traditions to their new home.</p>
<p>&#8220;A quinceañera is about the girl, it&rsquo;s pretty much a passageway from childhood to becoming an adult,&#8221; said Andrea, a 10th grader at Southeast High School. &#8220;A lot of people like to compare quinceañeras to weddings because it&rsquo;s the size of a wedding, but they are totally different.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over the last five years, quinceañeras have grown in popularity across the country, said Cindy Benavides, owner of Strategic Events, a large event-planning company based in Texas.</p>
<p>The tradition started with immigrant families and has expanded to families with children born in the United States but with Latin American roots, she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There are 400,000 Hispanic girls turning 15 every year in the United States, Ms. Benavides said, with quinceañeras generating millions of dollars annually.</p>
<p>Families nationwide spent a estimated $400 million on quinceañeras in 2007, according to Quince Girl, a magazine dedicated to the event.</p>
<p>In Dalton, quinceañeras are held almost every weekend, according to residents. Sometimes families must schedule the mass outside of Dalton to book a date.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Businesses nationwide and in the region have started catering to quinceañeras, local business owners said. Since Brenda Davenport, owner of Brides of Dalton, expanded her services to quinceañeras about four years ago, her quinceañera business has almost doubled.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Next to bridals, Jennifer White, owner of Cup a Dee Cakes in Tunnel Hill, Ga., said quinceañeras are the largest business area she wants to grow.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a good business for me and for the entire community, and it&rsquo;s year round,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Although private parties at the Northwest Georgia Trade and Convention Center make up less than 10 percent of its total number of events, quinceañeras have surpassed weddings, said Daniel Farrow, event coordinator with the center.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The cost for a small quinceañera ranges from $5,000 to $10,000, Mrs. Benavides said. Medium-size quinceañeras range from $10,000 to $18,000 and large-scale events can be $25,000 and up, she said.</p>
<p>The Pimentel family spent around $12,000 on Andrea&rsquo;s quinceañera &mdash; about $4,000 on the dinner, $1,000 on the dress, $1,000 for the hall at the trade center, and the rest on decorations, cake, invitations, hair and make-up, accessories, a mariachi band, photography and video and the disc jockey.</p>

			<p>Quinceanera is a formal recognition that a young Mexican girl is available for sex.  </p>
<p>Thoughtful Mexicans resist the ceremony and all of the adult accoutrement, because they know it hastens their daughter&rsquo;s sexual activity and ultimately her out of wedlock pregnancy.</p>
<p>The daughters, on the other hand, love the idea of advertising their sexual availability to Mexican bloods at 15 and and they fight to keep the quinceanera.  Its sort of the human equivalent of the various animal signals of being in rut.</p>
<p>The daughters are winning.  Mexicans have a 50% bastardy rate in the USA, much higher than in Mexico.</p>

			<p>So what.  Every culture has coming of age ceremonies.  Oops, I forgot.  Whites don&rsquo;t.  White Marxists believe we should remain children until at least age 30.  As long as the girl isn&rsquo;t screwing around or in a gang, then I say welcome to adulthood.  Maybe White teens should learn to grow up too.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m amazed at the level of opulent social entertaining that can be derived from the incomes of people &#8220;doing the jobs Americans refuse to do&#8221; while still sending 20-30% of that same income back to Mexico.  Maybe there is some sort of secret WIC voucher program that will pay for these parties.</p>

			<p>Excuse me, but who cares outside of greedy businesses how much money is generated by hundreds of thousands of illegal alien girls turning fifteen every year,especially when the thought that many will soon be on welfare with one or more dependents. </p>

<p>(scoffs)</p>
<p>Really, these people should be viewed as traitors by any unbrainwashed true Americans remaining.</p>
<p>PLEASE read some older non-PC US history books before they&rsquo;re all banned or destroyed!</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a bit impossible isn&rsquo;t it? Can a book, printed in, say, NYC, survive 160 years? But it truth, information has always been controlled, hasn&rsquo;t it? I&rsquo;ll admit tho, during the last 50 years or so, for the most part, only insanity has made it to print. </p>

			<p>I want to know how they can afford to pay $5,000 for their daughter&rsquo;s party when they can&rsquo;t afford to pay rent, car insurance, utilities&hellip; oh yeah, cos they live 20 in a house and get welfare so they can steal all the copper in the area and sell it for cash. </p>

<p>My parents threw a &#8220;Sweet 16&#8221; party for my sister in 1966.  It was coed,  I was next and as a male, they just made it a party for me with invited friends - all male.  But it worked for my sister who gave birth to a bastardette in 1967 -  white and all.  The only good thing to report is that she eventually married the father - after he survived Viet Nam - and had two legitimate children.  They are still together today.</p>

<p>The reporter obviously failed basic arithmetic&hellip;</p>
<p>$400,000,000 / 400,000 girls = $1,000 per girl, NOT $12,000 or so stated subsequently.</p>
<p>I trust that businesses that plan their activities around these festivities are much better at arithmetic&hellip;  They better be or they&rsquo;ll be broke!</p>

			<p>If ANYONE still believes that saw about Mexicans taking only menial jobs &#8220;that Whites won&rsquo;t take&#8221;&hellip; let me hear from you. Have I got a great used car bargain for you.</p>
<p>FACE UP TO IT AMERICA! The damned illegals and their adult anchor babies are stealing jobs out from under our Americans! The now adult anchor babies are competing with you, your own adult kids FOR AMERICAN JOBS! Between outsourcing and the immigrants stealing our jobs&hellip; what does that leave our future generations?</p>

<p>Right!! my daughter&rsquo;s history book had only a few paragraphs of WWII in it, a rather significant happening in history, nothing on the Viet-Nam war, but page after page on MLK</p>

			<p>Just crack down on employers including big companies like Comcast and Verizon who use Hispanic subcontractors and their illegal laborers to dig lines and install fiber optics in thousands of communities. All done under local licensing regulations. Local pols don&rsquo;t have the guts to say no to regulated industries or to govt contractors who use illegals. Prince William County Va is the rare place with guts to stand up to big media like the Washington Post that accuse Prince William&rsquo;s people of being racist because they don&rsquo;t want to live next to backyards littered with beer bottles, neighbors who rape little girls, wifebeaters and parasites who drive education costs skyward while schools decline into mush for all students, including the kids of long-term residents.</p>
<p>Starve these people out. And don&rsquo;t give them food stamps, emergency medical care, or a penny of federal money. Don&rsquo;t let private charities subsidize them either; yank the nonprofit tax exemption of any church or nonprofit that finances or shelters these leeches. </p>
<p>Finally, it&rsquo;s not just the Spanish illegals. We need to restore immigration quotas by region; we do not need anybody from Africa which has nothing to offer this nation. Even quotas from India should be cut; we need to force our lazy kids to study science and medicine or starve. There are plenty of good jobs filled by Asians that Americans can fill if they would realize they must pass hard courses or starve.</p>
<p>McCain is a nice guy and I respect his military record. But he lacks the guts to do what needs to be done to save American culture. He has no conception of American culture as a European variation. As for Barry Hussein Obama, what can anyone say except Aloha and whatever the word for goodbye is in Swahili. co   ery </p>

			<p>Quinceaneras are the Iberian Peninsula&rsquo;s equivalent of the debutante ball. The comparison to a wedding isn&rsquo;t quite right.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Quinceanera is a formal recognition that a young Mexican girl is available for sex.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very rude and ignorant statement. A quinceanera is comparable to a Sweet Sixteen, a Cotillion, a society &#8220;coming out&#8221; party, or a Bat Mitzvah.<br>
