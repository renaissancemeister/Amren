						<p>Officials of a rural Maryland town illegally discriminated against a Muslim group by barring them from building a mosque and holding annual conventions on land zoned for farming, the property&rsquo;s owner claims in a federal lawsuit.</p>
<p>Developer David Moxley and his father had planned to sell 224 acres in Walkersville to the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community USA for about $6 million. The Silver Spring-based religious group canceled the deal earlier this year after the town&rsquo;s three-member Board of Zoning Appeals voted unanimously to reject their request for a special exception to land-use restrictions.</p>
<p>Officials of the town of 5,600 based their denial largely on open space preservation concerns and fears that the thousands of people attending the group&rsquo;s annual, three-day Jalsa Salana national convention would overwhelm the community&rsquo;s roads and emergency services.</p>
<p>Moxley said the convention each June draws an average of 4,500 people. This year&rsquo;s gathering, held in Harrisburg, Pa., drew nearly 10,000 to see the group&rsquo;s spiritual leader making a rare U.S. visit, event coordinator Harris Zafar said.</p>
<p>David and Robert Moxleys&rsquo; complaint, to be filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Baltimore, alleges that town leaders conspired to block the Ahmadis by adopting new agricultural land-use restrictions, including one barring places of worship, after the group publicly announced its plans for the site.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Storzer [Roman P. Storzer, the Moxleys&rsquo; lawyer] said the lawsuit seeks a court order forcing the town to permit the uses sought by the Ahmadis, a declaration that the town violated civil-rights protections and payment of unspecified damages to the Moxleys.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Ahmadiyya, or Ahamdis, believe that their spiritual leader, Hadhrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, who died in 1908, was a prophet of God. They regard themselves as Muslims but they have been barred from practicing their faith in Pakistan, resulting in violent clashes with hard-line Muslims.<br>

			<p>&#8220;Officials of a rural Maryland town illegally discriminated against a Muslim group by barring them from building a mosque and holding annual conventions on land zoned for farming, the property&rsquo;s owner claims in a federal lawsuit.&#8221;</p>
<p>That the officials might rightly perceive a threat from these people, since many mosques teach violent jihad, doesn&rsquo;t seem to be taken into consideration as it should, since experience has shown here and abroad that home-grown terrorist cells spring up from mosques being used as anti-Christian/ anti-Western training and propaganda centers.</p>
<p>Laws need to be passed stipulating that mosque permits can only be approved if the principles involved prove they have no radical elements that might preach crime and violence, and the women aren&rsquo;t allowed to cover their faces and the men must shave their beards, and all of them must consent to being fingerprinted, and donating DNA samples.</p>
<p>One last requirement must be that they swear, under oath to Allah, that they will not carry on a practice of cruelty to animals, since their past track record is so dismal and horrendous in that regard.<br>

			<p>Let them build it just prohibit the use of non-combustable materials.  Mosques in Antwerp can&rsquo;t even get insurance anymore.  Problem solved.</p>

<p><br>
So, let me see if I understand this. MUSLIMS can run MUSLIMS out of a MUSLIM country, but Christians can&rsquo;t run them off from a CHRISTIAN community!! do I have that right? Maybe they need to start having some violent clashes with Christian Militias and see if they run away to Mexico or Canada</p>

			<p>Looks like another case of reverse discrimination, and look who&rsquo;s claiming discrimination. I&rsquo;ll bet Mr Moxley doesn&rsquo;t give a rats whether there is any discrimination going on, except for a little 6 million dollar problem. Why don&rsquo;t they get up a petition to disallow it claiming whatever pretext it takes? Better yet build a large hog farm. The smell would be less offensive than than a mosque, and ten thousand hate mongers.  </p>
