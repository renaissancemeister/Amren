<p>Results of the Pew Hispanic Center survey show Obama with 66 percent of the Hispanic vote to McCain&rsquo;s 23 percent.</p>
<p>The results represent a &#8220;sharp reversal&#8221; in Obama&rsquo;s fortunes from the primaries, when he lost the Latino vote to Clinton by nearly 2-1, prompting speculation that Hispanics were leery of voting for a black candidate, said Susan Minushkin, the center&rsquo;s deputy director.</p>
<p>Instead, the survey found that three times as many respondents said being black would help Obama with Hispanic voters, as opposed to those who said it would hurt. And 53 percent said his race would make no difference.</p>
<p>The poll by the nonpartisan research organization is based on a telephone survey of 2,015 Hispanics, 892 of whom were registered voters. Interviews were conducted June 9 through July 13. The overall survey has a margin of error of 2.8 percentage points, and the margin of error for registered voters is 4.4 percentage points.</p>
<p>COURTING THE VOTE</p>
<p>The poll comes as both campaigns are making a concerted effort to woo Hispanic voters: McCain has been advertising for six weeks on Spanish-language radio in Florida, along with Colorado, New Mexico and Nevada, the four battle ground states with sizable Hispanic populations. And Obama&rsquo;s campaign Wednesday unveiled its first Spanish-language ad in Florida.</p>
<p>Both candidates have appeared before leading Hispanic groups to pledge support for a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. But McCain has faced a steep climb: critics have accused him of softening his stance on his own immigration legislation during the GOP primary, when his support for immigration reform threatened to derail his candidacy as his rivals and parts of the GOP base assailed the effort.</p>
<p>The poll suggests the GOP brand is sinking with Latinos, even as it suggests that immigration is not a driving factor for the Hispanic electorate.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>IN LINE WITH PAST</p>
<p>The poll shows Obama attracting Hispanic support at about the same level as John Kerry in 2004, and McCain underperforming compared with President Bush, who was pulling 32 percent of the Hispanic vote in a similar Pew poll in July 2004. Bush garnered about 40 percent of the Hispanic vote in the 2004 election, a record for a GOP presidential candidate.</p>

			<p>The IRONY being that the damned illegal immigrants ARE CROWDING AFRO-AMERICANS OUT OF THE BOTTOM LEVEL, MANUAL LABOR JOBS!</p>
<p>Are our Afro-Americans really that dumb? That they can&rsquo;t see or understand what the wave of illegal immigrants mean to them? Businesses will ten time rather hire Mexicans than Blacks. Blacks have THAT BAD a reputation as working only when watched.</p>

			<p>&#8221;It&rsquo;s certainly something the campaign needs to recognize and deal with,&#8221; said Miami Republican Rep. David Rivera, a former strategist with the Republican Party of Florida. &#8220;But once they get his message out on his record in Arizona, his support for immigration and free trade, I think the numbers will tighten.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pure nonsense.  Mestizos know full well about McCain&rsquo;s pandering to them, but the vast majority will always vote for a non-white over a white.  This country is steeped in hard core racial politics for the most part, and any politician who ignores that is ignoring reality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the goofy Harry Reids, Kennedys, Pelosis, et al, who are just too gullible and naive to understand that they are disliked by most non-whites simply because they&rsquo;re white.  It is exactly those types who opened up the country to white-hating non-whites to begin with who are also objects of jealousy and resentment, the same as all whites.  That they believe otherwise reveals just how incompetent they are as politicians and how unaware and out-of-touch with reality they are as individuals.</p>
<p>Case in point:  Gore, in front of the cameras supporting immigration, lays his hand on the shoulder of a mestizo, asking him what he thought when he saw the Statue of Liberty, to which the mestizo reacted as if he were getting too choked up to answer, but unless the Statue of Liberty has been moved to the Rio Grande River, the mestizo probably never laid eyes on it, so how naive is our boy Gore, as he turned toward the camera with a look that said, &#8220;See what I mean?&#8221;?  </p>
<p>How gullible and naive is he to expect that mestizos care about anything but using this country to earn money, as they fly their Mex rag in their yards and declare their pride in their failed state, while proclaiming for all to hear that this land is their land?</p>
<p>The unfortunate truth is that the white elites have completely abandoned their race, their country, culture, traditions, and will always consistently give them up if they perceive they will gain enough support to get them elected or to keep them in office.</p>
<p>It pains me to say that every white fighting man this country lost in every war we&rsquo;ve ever fought died in vain.  He fought for the preservation of our country and way of life and for the promise of a better future for his children and their heirs only to have his great sacrifices regarded by the elites who followed as absolutely nothing to be concerned with.</p>
<p>This crop of politicians these last several years have constantly pandered to non-whites, rejecting white social conservatives in favor of the non-white vote, and in almost every election they have gained only a wee percentage of non-whites and lost a tremendous number of white social conservatives.  Obviously they need advisors who are not so dim witted, but they never get them, because their policies never change.</p>
<p>That Obama is going to get the lion&rsquo;s share of non-white votes is a no brainer to people who are aware of just exactly what is going on in this country today.  The unfortunate thing is that the McCain types will never understand that and will continue with their abysmal pandering to people who would like to see them ousted in favor of a non-white.</p>

			<p>This article is precisely why I will NEVER understand how Republicans could support amnesty and open borders.  Doing so was political suicide for the Republican party in the long run.<br>
As demographics have changed these past 30 years, we have gone from choosing between a conservative and liberal, to choosing between a liberal and liberal lite.  Republicans, having held the White House for all but 8 of the last 28 years, are as much to blame as anybody, if not moreso.  They have handed Democrats a gift by way of a HUGE voting bloc as a direct result of their appeasement to the open borders crowd.<br>
As was correctly pointed out on AmRen a few days ago, over 50% of children under the age of 5 are now non-white.  The damage has been done by this fact alone.  Even if we whites showed solidarity, which we don&rsquo;t, its just a matter of time.  As far as Republicans are concerned, elections are close now, but in the long run Republicans will have no choice but to become more liberal (anti-white) in order to compete with Democrats for this voting bloc that they have helped bring to our shores.  America is no longer the America we knew and loved.  May their treachery be judged harshly.</p>

			<p>The &#8220;minorities&#8221; are slowly learning how to unite against the majority in this country (this is why so many support Obama).</p>

			<p>In spite of the animosity between blacks and Hispanics, I predict Obama will get a big majority of the &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; vote.  First off, east coast Hispanics are largely partly or entirely Afro-Caribbean, and thus will vote Obama for racial loyalty.  But even among Chicano-Mestizo Hispanics, they will vote Obama and Democrat simply because the Democrats are better at spending money and enacting social welfare programs.</p>

			<p>Because both parties enable them, Hispanics are coming to realize that they do not need to vote Republican to enjoy their way of life. It is only under the Democrats, however, that are they pampered with infinite social services such as welfare, medical care, education, etc&hellip; </p>
<p>The more they learn about church-going Obama and his ultraliberal voting record, the more they will come to realize that an administration under him will be one big welfare bonanza! They no longer feel threatened by blacks for handouts because the vast majority of Hispanics are generally more intelligent and willing to work than blacks.</p>
<p>Hispanic voters are about to make a paradigm shift in the way they vote. They realize that the government, whether Democrat or Republican, will neither penalize nor deport them. Thus, their only question now is which party will give them the most handouts?</p>

			<p>I hope these types of polling results forever end the ignorant statements from Republican / neo-conservative &#8220;strategists&#8221; that:</p>
<p>&#8220;The hispanic vote is up for grabs&#8221;</p>
<p>Forget it &hellip; the hispanics are going vote for the Democratic candidate who will panders to them the most, and promises the most government benefits &hellip; period, end of discussion.</p>
<p>Perhaps, even in our lifetimes, the same Republican / neo-conservative &#8220;strategists&#8221; will also quit blabbering about hispanic &#8220;family values&#8221;.  I have no idea if these &#8220;strategists&#8221; are delusional, or do they assume that conservatives are just a bunch of idiots who can be easily lied to.  Those &#8220;family values&#8221; can surely be found in the &#8220;Edenic&#8221; country of Mexico.</p>

			<p>Hispanics as a whole will not vote for the black barbarian presidential candidate.  At the very least, most Hispanics still possess an innate sense of civilization and culture derived from their Spanish European heritage, and a legacy in Latin America in which the blacks, indians, and mestizos, were always subject to white Spanish rule.  </p>
<p>I wish readers of this publication understood this truth and also stopped believing the lie of Hispanics (I am not referring to Chicanos or other such barbarians) as non-white, non-Western.  </p>

			<p>   I told you these people are democrats. That&rsquo;s why the liberal left media is for open borders. With the flood of Mexicans into the U.S. Republican candidates and also conservative causes are finished. Done! Finito! It will always be democrats winning the important positions. Also liberal causes will sail through the legislature. Democrats are traitors to America&rsquo;s middle class. Marxism is here!</p>

			<p>I hope when President Obama halts all construction on the border fence, he&rsquo;ll remove the one around the White House. Give us all an equal chance to protect ourselves against the criminals, and good luck to all.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t believe any polls, especially those coming from the mainstream media.  Blacks and Hispanics do not like each other and I find it hard to believe that Obama has a huge Hispanic following.</p>
<p>Nor do I believe all those smiling white faces sitting behind Obama everytime he makes a speech.  The media wants us to believe that the majority white folk in this country have no problem with electing a black man.  I don&rsquo;t believe it.  People say one thing but it&rsquo;s a totally different ball game when they get in that voting booth.  </p>

<p>Posted by White is Beautiful Robert at 6:42 PM on July 28</p>
<p> - Absolutely true, Robert. It&rsquo;s also high comedy watching Republicans expecting Hispanics to vote for them election after election - while the Democrat Party promises new ways to raid our public Treasury, thus continuing to buy Hispanic votes - offering them free money seems to work very well with minorities.</p>
<p>This cycle is like an itelligence test that the Republicans flunk every election, with McCain and his Amnesty scheme (more voters for Democrats) easily winning his party&rsquo;s quadrennial booby prize.  </p>
