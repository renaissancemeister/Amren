<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>One of the most appealing features of the Barack Obama candidacy is the idea that Obama is &#8220;postracial&#8221; &mdash; that he is a candidate who is black and does not practice the adversarial politics of Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton. {snip}</p>
<p>But a story in the Honolulu Star-Bulletin raises serious questions about Obama&rsquo;s postracialism. The paper describes an Obama appearance at Unity &lsquo;08, &#8220;a convention of four minority journalism associations&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote>&#8220;I personally would want to see our tragic history, or the tragic elements of our history, acknowledged,&#8221; the Democratic presidential hopeful said.
<p> &#8220;I consistently believe that when it comes to whether it&rsquo;s Native Americans or African-American issues or reparations, the most important thing for the U.S. government to do is not just offer words, but offer deeds.&#8221;</blockquote></p>
<p>Exactly what Obama is advocating here cannot be determined, but it seems to be something of an endorsement of the idea of &#8220;reparations for slavery,&#8221; which is usually taken to mean cash payments. In this view, the following deeds are insufficient to balance the ledger between America and the descendants of slaves: the Civil War, the ratification of the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments, Brown v. Board of Education, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the continuing practice of racial preferences.</p>
<p>The idea of reparations is highly unpopular, and with good reason. {snip} The idea of the government cutting checks to compensate people for a wrong that they did not personally suffer is unlikely to appeal to anyone except perhaps those who stand to receive those checks.</p>
<p>The politics of this are rather odd. There is little for Obama to gain by endorsing reparations. If ever there was a candidate who has no need to pander to the descendants of slaves, it is Barack Obama. Democratic presidential candidates can usually count on upward of 90% of the black vote, and Obama racked up similar percentages in a hard-fought primary battle.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in order to attract votes among nonblacks, Obama needs to guard carefully his postracial credentials. It&rsquo;s one thing to endorse racial preferences, a conventionally liberal if unpopular view. But reparations remains a fringe idea &mdash; the sort of idea a presidential nominee would normally be careful to stay away from.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

			<p>Being &#8220;post racial&#8221; is an impossibility for any candidate, even this one.</p>
<p>Sen. Obama&rsquo;s race is the only reason his candidacy has generated so much interest.  Were he another liberal white Democrat Sen. Clinton would have made short work of him.</p>
<p>Because Obama is an intelligent black politician who can act white he attracts the support of whites who share his views or just want &#8220;change&#8221; (whatever that is), and do not feel threatened.  His race is what set him apart.</p>
<p>Blacks see a BLACK candidate who will look out for their group interests.  His race is their bond with him.</p>

			<p>If in fact white people are voting for Obama to satisfy a debt they believe we owe black people.If whites believe by voting for Obama blacks will lower their demands then why shouldn&rsquo;t Obama go for as much as he can get for blacks.We can look to a whole history of foolish white decisions.Can you blame black people to get what they can from dumb whitey.</p>

<p>I disagree. Blacks will surely expect Obama to work on reparations eventually if he gets elected, although he is admittedly showing his hand a little early.</p>

			<p>And by &#8220;deeds,&#8221; Barak Hussein Obama really means &#8220;money.&#8221;  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not fooled one bit by the phony &#8220;rivalry&#8221; between Je$$e and BHO -they are the Coke and Pepsi of race-hustlin&rsquo; shakedown artists, each with a slightly different approach to the same basic formula.  The only reason the media pumped Je$$e&rsquo;s comments about BHO is to dupe Whites into thinking Obama is of a different stripe.  He ain&rsquo;t.  I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;ll soon find out the hard way.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not odd for Obama to say something like he did about reparations, if it&rsquo;s understood that his enitre purpose for wanting to be president is to try to benefit blacks someway, first and foremost before any other consideration, including protecting the country against attack.</p>
<p>Mostly he keeps his true intent quiet, but he&rsquo;s only human and when he gets tired the truth will leak out sometimes.  </p>
<p>Does anybody believe that he paticipated in the festivities and programs of the Trinity United Church for 22 years without being committed heart and soul to the hatred of whites and to consider blacks before all else and to regard his African motherland as his true home?</p>
<p>It is only white fools who are duped by this man.  The blacks know full well what he&rsquo;s all about.  Otherwise, how could he garner 95% of the black vote?</p>

			<p>Obamas black ancestors were not slaves, and his white ancestors were slave owners.</p>
<p>So does he get paid or have to pay?  And how much money is going to be spent researching the genealogy of Americans to determine if they are guilty or not?</p>
<p>Liberalism sounds more and more like totalitarianism every single day.</p>

<p>Laughable, who ever gave Mr. Taranto the idea that Obama isn&rsquo;t a fringe candidate, just brimming with fringe ideas?</p>
<p>Here the Machiavelli in me would agree with those who feel that worse is better; if that wretched Mau Mau Obama is stupid enough to overplay his hand and actually attempts to push for reparations, he may very well start the racial civil war that he is supposed to symbolically represent as a multicultural &#8220;impossibility.&#8221; Even if that were not to occur, perhaps it will be enough to &#8220;wake up&#8221; the sleeping white giant in the USA. If not out of pure outrage at the abominable act itself, then in reaction to the swaggeringly triumphant black mobs, who will undoubtedly take the payments as a &#8220;signal&#8221; to rampage against the &#8220;white oppressors&#8221; while chanting: &#8216;Yes we can, Comrade Obama say so whitey&hellip;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t that be an irony of &#8220;hope&#8221; and &#8220;change&#8221;<br>

			<p>Reperations?  NO,I do not think Obama is speaking of cash reperations, he is talking about what has been done in several African nations, whites surrendering their homes, farms and businesses to BLACKS.  Militant Black Liberation states that Whites must volentarily give Blacks what they want, or Blacks will take it by force.<br>

			<p>Yes, Obama wants reparations and more.</p>
<p>When he was preaching his Father&rsquo;s day sermon he spoke of implementing many entitlements that would benefit the single black father.</p>
<p>The following question was asked on 2-15-08 by the US News and World Report and here is Obama&rsquo;s answer.</p>
<p>Question: Do you think that, in the end, race will be an impediment to your being elected?</p>
<p>Answer:  Look, I have no doubt that there are some people who won&rsquo;t vote for me because I&rsquo;m black. There would also be some people who won&rsquo;t vote for me because I&rsquo;m young, because I&rsquo;ve got big ears&hellip;or they don&rsquo;t like my political philosophy.<br>
This country made profound changes after 1960 &mdash; I was born in 1961 &mdash; essentially in my lifetime. We have made some profound changes in attitude. Now that is not to suggest that my election provides us racial reconciliation on the cheap. There are deep-rooted, institutional barriers to success for minority groups. Not just African-Americans but also Latinos. And those barriers &mdash; some of them cultural, some of them institutional &mdash; aren&rsquo;t going to go away anytime soon, unless we make some serious investments in improving our schools and opening up job opportunities and enforcing nondiscrimination laws more effectively than we have.<br>

			<p>Obama is writing a very large check to minorities that there is no way he will be able to cash.  Heck, after his speeches in Europe and his bill to fund the UN at taxpayers expense, I would say hes writing rubber checks all over the world, typical black person.  </p>

			<p>Obama is keeping his cards close to his chest.  We ain&rsquo;t seen nothin&rsquo; yet!  Hopefully a reporter will ask him point blank &#8220;Senator Obama, are you for reparations for slavery&#8221;? I believe this issue will come up and will force his hand.  However, given how much negative press has come out and so many whites refuse to believe it  &mdash;  it won&rsquo;t matter anyway.  They are messmerized and can&rsquo;t wait to cast a ballot for the messiah.<br>

			<p>It&rsquo;s impossible to be post-racial. That&rsquo;s like denying being seven feet tall, or four feet tall; or denying being a genius, or an idiot. It&rsquo;s part of life. History is still with us, as is evolution.</p>
<p>Obama is a shyster. If he were a white guy, we&rsquo;d see it. Like Bill Clinton, he promises better &#8220;race relations,&#8221; although pluralism is still an insoluble proposition. As a result, it&rsquo;s more smoke and mirrors/dog and pony show to distract the herd while the profit goes out the back door.</p>
<p>In another two years, President Obama will still be popular, except among the smarter people who supported him. They will see that there&rsquo;s not much he can do. Why is that? It costs $1bn to run a presidential campaign   &mdash;   the same lobbyists own all candidates. Further, the political system is so calcified at this point that it emphasizes compromise more than getting anything productive done.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to start the USA over. I&rsquo;d settle for a chunk of it where northwestern European descended people of middle class genetics, values and history can hang out and be productive. The rest nature will take care of.</p>

<p>I like this article.  But the one problem I have with it is from the above excerpt.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;to compensate people for a wrong that they did not personally suffer&hellip;.&#8221;  </p>
<p>No problem there.  In fact, there is not sufficient contempt in the world for people who want something for nothing.  Whether it&rsquo;s money or unconditional love that, of course, always goes unanswered.  Meaning, loving someone unconditionally will garuntee that they will become spoiled and never learn to love in return.</p>
<p>No, the problem I have is what is NOT said.  So, allow me to re-write the sentence.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;to compensate people for a wrong they did not personally suffer from is bad enough.  But to have them compensated by people who had nothing whatsoever to do with what they (Blacks of today) didn&rsquo;t suffer from is placing one absurdity on top of another.&#8221;</p>
<p>THAT&rsquo;S what it should read.  But it doesn&rsquo;t, for a reason.</p>
<p>Also, Property is a very, very important concept among Americans. And this was especially true back then. Blacks were property and treated with much more care - overall - than were the Irish and Chinese who built our Railroads and Buildings (many of whom were buried under those buildings, figuratively and literally - as there were no burial insurance or benefits of any kind). <br>
The White ruling Elite of the day was in serious competition WITH EACH OTHER.  So they were, for the most part, careful with what they were using to compete.  Today the Ruling Elite are doing the EXACT same thing.  They have merely reversed the order, that&rsquo;s all.<br>
But more importantly.  How in the WORLD can Blacks go on and on about how they built this country from the sweat of their backs if they were constantly being beaten and abused?  That there was mistreatment is not denied (though I for one feel ZERO guilt, for a reason!).  But what also can not be denied is the fact that we have been engaged ever since in one big, long, protracted, and hysterical, historical exaggeration hitherto unknown to Mankind.  In fact, it&rsquo;s nothing less than the psychic dis-ease of our age and continuing to indulge in it is making us lose our sanity!  And, for WHAT?!?!<br>

			<p>Obamination is an Affirmative Action beneficiary all the way.</p>
<p>And he will be the first Affirmative Action prez if elected, and we cannot afford to let that happen.  He is not very smart or intelligent and has been dumbed down just like the rest of the country.  He is told what to say and how to think by his many advisors (I&rsquo;ve heard a couple of hundred at least).   How can anyone be so stupid to think that just because he went to &#8220;Harvard&#8221;  lol  that he somehow is better educated??   He does&rsquo;t even know how many states there are, lol, and can&rsquo;t speak properly, the word is &#8220;to&#8221;  not &#8220;ta&#8221; BHO,  duh.  Listen to the words and decipher what he is actually trying to not let you know.  </p>
<p>He is a placement without the required experience for the JOB, he&rsquo;s getting all this media attention so his named is drilled into the heads of stupid people so they can only say he is for HOPE and CHANGE,   which in itself is an empty message!</p>

			<p>&#8220;There are deep-rooted, institutional barriers to success for minority groups. Not just African-Americans but also Latinos.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are no deep-rooted, institutional barriers for Latinos in the twenty odd Latino nation states in Central and South America. Why should the United States change its structure when Latinos already have so many other options available to them? The barriers for African-Americans are not institutional either. They are evolutionary barriers. Nothing but the destruction of civilization itself will bring about economic and social equality for blacks; in other words, the neo-Marxist agenda. </p>

			<p>Reparations for descendents of slaves, although unwarranted and unjust taking into account decades of handouts and preferences and this simple fact that the U.S. is a country of individual rights and NOT group rights, are at least debatable. Slaves performed involuntary work for which they weren&rsquo;t paid off, so their heirs may have a civil law claim against those who owed them wages. </p>
<p>But reparations to American Indians is an utterly absurd proposition.</p>
<p><b>Neither we nor our ancestirs didn&rsquo;t rip Amerindians off the fruits of their work and ingenuity, so there is NOTHING that we may even consider paying.</b> Period.<br>

			<p>I encourage everyone to recognize and understand that we are embroiled in a cold war of ideas and races in America. I challenge everyone to reevaluate your lives and look for all legal ways to circumvent diversity and affirmative action as much as possible. </p>
<p>Here are a few examples of things you can do to ensure you are not an unwitting participant in your own destruction.</p>
<p>- When shopping, seek out White-owned establishments that do not tout diversity/multiculturalism/affirmative action. Avoid stores and products that advertise using multicultural themes. Punish them by withholding your patronage and commerce.</p>
<p>- If you&rsquo;re shopping for new furniture, a new car, or a new home, or any &#8220;big-ticket&#8221; items, make sure you buy them from a White person who probably shares your views. Do not unwittingly give commissions or sales to minorities or help them to look good in front of their bosses.</p>
<p>- Do no take any actions that make the lives of minorities easier or their burdens less.</p>
<p>- Aggressively look for legal tax deductions. Don&rsquo;t fund the existence of minorities and AA any more than is legally required.</p>
<p>Pay White kids to mow your lawns and wash your vehicles, not minorities. And make sure you&rsquo;re paying those White kids more than the minorities are earning. If not, just do such chores yourself.</p>
<p>- Avoid interacting with minorities in every possible way.</p>
<p>- When you give to charities, go to a White church with 100% White membership. Ensure you receive a receipt from the Church for the IRS, and make sure the Church is an authorized charity that is recognized by the IRS.</p>
<p>- Get to know your local political candidates before you contribute money to their campaigns or vote for them. Ensure that they understand that you are interested in your culture as a White American and that you are opposed to the threat that minorities represent to western civilization. Do not be afraid to say it like that! If the candidate is shocked or offended, we do not need them. Ensure they understand the kind of change our side wants. No money and no votes for wrong-thinkers!</p>
<p>- In subtle ways, teach others about the reality of Black crime, STDs, and their other undesirable qualities that harm society. Cite examples of how they harm Whites and destroy the fabric of society.</p>
<p>- Most of all&hellip; Remember that we are fighting against the ideas of a relatively small group of elite Whites. Our primary fight is not with Blacks or Hispanics or Muslims. Those groups are merely the undesirable tools that the most elite Whites use to harm Whites of lower means. Do not let hatred for other races consume you. Remain focused and use your intelligence wisely to focus on the primary threat! Allow your money to speak for you!!!</p>
<p>Let your money talk, my friends. Do not yield! Resist! Do not make it easy for the purveyors of your destruction to succeed!</p>
<p>Good luck! <br>

			<p>I am a racist who decided a couple of months ago to vote for Obama because McCain is a warmonger who is going to get us in a war with Iran.  However in the last week or so as Obama starts talking about leaving the option open of a premptive strike on Iran, McCain is coming into focus again as a somewhat more viable candidate. War or peace is whats going to win this election not economics or race.</p>

			<p>Whites are voting for Obama because he is LEFT of center, and has &#8216;charisma&rsquo;. They are not voting out of white guilt, that is just silly. If he was a REAL black, like his dad, he would scare everyone away, and would not get any votes. Even Jesse, and Al have more white blood than Obamas daddy.</p>
<p>Obamas leftist agenda does not frighten the left, DUH!, its what alot of democrats want, and after years of RHINO Bush, of course they rush to vote this guy in. Bill Clinton was a CENTRIST, semi-Republican on alot of issues, including welfare.</p>
<p>The bigger issue, is why do the so called &#8216;Republicans&rsquo; keep putting up Rhinos for office? Is that not as bad or worse than Obamanation is to the Democrats? Obama is a true liberal, AND a &#8220;Near-black&#8221;, fulfilling the prophecy of &#8216;black equality&rsquo;. Of course, Bama is only 1/2 black, his 1/2 white mom is related to Bush and Cheney.</p>

			<p>Kenya was not involved with slavery, so Obama is off the hook for that, that is, his ancestors likeley did not buy and sell other black Africans to the west, but maybe the sellers who sold slaves(IE: drug dealer) should be responsible for selling the blacks to whites. (Aka drug dealer pushing product, whites are mearly the addict to cheap labor)</p>
<p>So yes, lets have reparations. Slaves were often DEFEATED warriors and their people. So after you defeat your rivals, and there is no one to sell them to (Whites or Arabs) what do you do with them? You KILL them. So Slavery saved millions of blacks.</p>
<p>And we are so blessed with these ancestors of &#8216;loosers&rsquo;, literally. So blacks living today owe their lives to white slave owners. How can they repay whites, or should it just be the decendants of slave owners that get paid? If your ancestor never owned slaves, should you as a white really be entitled to reparations?</p>
<p>And this is the thanks we get?</p>

He will have to decide if he wants to push afirmative action, reparations, national health care, etc.  He cannot do all of them.  If her were to push for reparations his candadacy would go into the toilet.  Plus they will never get them anyway.  </p>

Apparently you&rsquo;re right. There was a fascinating article about that by Craig Roberts (?) or Steve Sailer (?).   [Can&rsquo;t find it now.]   It seems that the two families are old friends and part of the same tight little social circle of Chicago&rsquo;s  ruling-class blacks.  Obama&rsquo;s wife, Michelle,  was once a baby sitter for the Jacksons and she is best friends with Jackson&rsquo;s daughter, Santita, who sang at their wedding.   Well, well!</p>
<p>  &#8220;She grew up in Jesse Jackson Sr&rsquo;s home. Michelle Laverne Robinson, and Jackson&rsquo;s daughter, Santita, were best friends and remain so. Jackson&rsquo;s daughter is godmother to one of the Obama kids. Meanwhile Jesse Jackson&rsquo;s son is Obama&rsquo;s top national chair for his election campaign&hellip;&#8221;<br>

<p>  &#8220;His wife, Michelle, grew up on Chicago&rsquo;s South Side and<br>
went to a magnet high school with Santita Jackson, the reverend&rsquo;s<br>
oldest child. Frank Watkins remembers frequently seeing Michelle at the Jacksons&rsquo; house in the &rsquo;70s* when he&rsquo;d go there to play<br>
basketball with the reverend. &ldquo;Michelle and Santita kind of babysat for Junior and Yusef and Jonathan [the third Jackson son] and oversaw the kids when the parents were gone,&rdquo;  When the Obamas were married in 1992, Santita was a bridesmaid,  and Jesse Jr. (who once half-jokingly confessed to having had a boyhood crush on Michelle) was one of the guests at their wedding. In a way, the Jacksons were now part of Obama&rsquo;s family.&#8221;<br>

			<p>THE AGE OF OBAMA ARRIVES</p>
<p>Turn on a TV..notice the explosion of black faces on the advertising. 12% of the population but at least 50% of the faces on TV. Advertising for insurance, beer, cars..all show<br>
blacks as Corporate Execs, lawyers, scientists&hellip;all running the world. Big Media has certainly gotten on the bandwagon.</p>

			<p>An Obama presidency would be the very height of a racial administration.<br>
It will involve reparations as well as far greater wealth transfers from whites to blacks.<br>
Such is the essence of Obama&rsquo;s existence, his attempt to deal with his racial identity as a true black man.  Just ask his affirmative action wife who has never before, during all those years of tax funded special treatment at Princeton and law school, had any respect for her country.</p>

			<p>Obama is not a joke. He is dangerous. He hates white people, and so does his wife  &mdash;  </p>
<p>There is a new book that was discussed on several radio shows today, detailing his communist agenda. No, I am not being hysterical. Communist agenda. Get OBAMA NATION by Dr. Corsi. Corsi is looking evil straight in the eye.</p>

			<p>So someone termed Obamanation to turn a buck? Good for them! </p>
<p>Yes, Obama is a commie racialist. What else could possibly wake America up? Has communism ever succeeded? Now Obama is pounding the war drum, the left never learns. Its not the candidate, its who is behind him. He is the left equivillent of Bush. He will have an 8 month honeymoon, then it may get worse, depending on the press. We may have to read foreign papers to get the real news on him though.</p>

<p>You are right, but scarily enough, it is both Obama and McCain.  They are both useless puppets who have been put in place and are being controlled by their Marxist Commie advisors.  Either way, whoever is pulling the strings will decide who wins, Obama or McCain.  It&rsquo;s not the American people deciding-that&rsquo;s for sure.  We really don&rsquo;t have a choice, we are just given a vote to make it look like we are.  Trust me, the powers that be already know who&rsquo;s going to win.</p>

			<p>Warning: the following is sarcastic.</p>
<p>Lets be clear here. All white people are not descendants of whites who owned slaves. Should these non slave owner descendants be taxed a reparation when they are totally innocent? How about the whites who fought and died in the War of Secession on behalf of the Union? They collaterally, fought and died to &#8220;free&#8221; the slaves. Should their descendants be taxed with reparations or perhaps should they be on the receiving side?</p>
<p>That leaves the descendants of the Confederacy? Not all Southerners had slaves - actually only about one in six to one in ten did (depending upon your source). Should those Southerners who are descendants from non slave holders be taxed with this reparation as well? How about those Southerners who sided with the Union? </p>
<p>And, how does one identify the actual descendants of slaves anyway? Being black alone is clearly not enough to grant standing in any court of law! Many blacks have arrived here after slavery i.e. the Hatians. Should every person with a dark skin receive money?</p>
<p>What about the white descendants of individuals who worked harder in the sweat shops of New England than did any slave in the South? Should they receive compensation also? Should the New England slave trader descendants be taxed? How about the New England plants that used the southern cotton? Did they benefit?</p>
<p>Who built the Intercontinental Railroad anyway? How many yellow men had to die in developing this country? Just how did these Chinese get here anyway? Does anyone think they just arrived here for the work? Or did opium have something to do with it? Why don&rsquo;t we owe the descendants of the Chinese who were often in the same position as slaves themselves - who lived and died for the white man&rsquo;s greed? Shouldn&rsquo;t they be paid as well?   </p>
<p>So now, as some allege, the noble red man once again, has no rights does he? The white man comes, takes his land by force, destroys his pristine forests, destroys his game [there was a time when the wild geese would completely cover the sky for hours during their migrations, the wild buffalo would cover the ground for fifty or more miles when they traveled, the wild trout filled the streams, and the water was pure] and turns his land into a concrete, asphalt, plastic, polluted, high rise, drug infested nightmare. Does anyone think that twenty dollars and some beads is a fair price for Manhattan?  </p>
<p>After one hundred years the black man has had his freedom returned. His descendants were free; and, they live today on the red man&rsquo;s land and the white man&rsquo;s financial support. They (the African - Americans), along with the Whites, owe the red man reparations. And, in all fairness, the red man&rsquo;s land needs to be returned to him immediately as well! After all, in an environmentally friendly world, clearly the red man was, and is, a better steward of the land than is the greedy white. We (excuse me) well they (the red men), wouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about carbon credits and footprints since they would leave none.             </p>
<p>Now President Obama&rsquo;s comment. What he did was twofold: One, he had to signal the blacks that he would be getting them their money; and, (2) he had to be purposely vague enough not to make the middle of the road whitey (who of course will be footing the bill) nervous. He did both.</p>
<p>Make no mistake. Senator Obama is one smart, sleek, young, well dressed, and brilliantly handled cookie! He plays the race card every day in every way and has virtually eliminated any hard criticism. In the debates, Senator McCain will come across as one old, un hip, short, fat, unattractive, and anchored in the past anachronism while Senator Obama will be the combination of JKF and MLK. </p>
<p>Those under thirty, for the most part, are not interested in reality, only in appearance. They will vote appearance. Senator Obama is scrubbed, fluffed, perfumed, and prepped. He is photogenic and charismatic. In the presence of whites he doesn&rsquo;t act, react, talk, or sound black. But he is black enough to grant the morally superior high ground to all of his white supporters. Once in office however, President Obama will prove to be the parvenu he is. In point of fact, he doesn&rsquo;t have a clue!</p>
<p>The thing that makes me the most nervous about all of this reparations talk is that the same race that is forever bitching about being mistreated is the same race that is forever holding its hand out for money. It seems incongruous doesn&rsquo;t it? </p>
<p>In short, I come from a well known Southern family that DID own slaves and I,for one, feel absolutely no obligation whatsoever to any of their descendants   &mdash;   much less descendants of other slaves with whom I have no connection whatsoever.   </p>

And it&rsquo;s a nice racket too.  Do you know how much actors make for one of those commercials?  You wouldn&rsquo;t believe!   And they continue getting  &#8220;residuals&#8221;  over and over for every time it&rsquo;s played.</p>
<p>Sure beats welfare!</p>

			<p>Most of my family and many of my friends and associates are life long Democrats up here in Michigan.  My family intends on voting for McCain and my friends are either going for McCain or they just don&rsquo;t know at this point.  If this is any indication of any national or state trend then Obama is in serious trouble.</p>

			<p><i>But reparations remains a fringe idea &mdash; the sort of idea a presidential nominee would normally be careful to stay away from.</i></p>
<p>Nobody should be complacent about this.  Time and time again we&rsquo;ve seen fringe issues from the left become mainstream dogma enforced with the full weight of the law.  Not so long ago homosexual marriage was a fringe issue.   Right now marriage between a man and a consenting sheep is a fringe issue, but mark my words, it will eventually become a mainstream issue advocated by all right thinking people.  &#8220;Tolerance&#8221; knows no limits.<br>
