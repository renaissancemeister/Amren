						<p>Looks like Rev. Slick has copped a plea. So to speak.</p>
<p>The US Attorney&rsquo;s Office has called off a criminal probe of Al Sharpton&rsquo;s mysterious personal and professional finances, accepting instead the reverend&rsquo;s promise to make good on up to $9 million in unpaid back taxes, interest and penalties.</p>
<p>Sharpton&rsquo;s word being what it is, the G-men better have it in writing &mdash; with multiple copies.</p>
<p>Even so, New York authorities &mdash; who have stood aside as the feds proceeded &mdash; will now be stepping up to the plate.</p>
<p>Criminal charges are said to be unlikely &mdash; but The Rev owes Albany gazillions, too, so there&rsquo;s more to come on this story.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Two fires &mdash; six years apart &mdash; conveniently destroyed Sharpton&rsquo;s financial records just as he was about to turn them over to government officials.</p>
<p>Clearly, the Rev. Al was feeling a different sort of heat &mdash; which is why last month he tried to enlist House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers to investigate his &#8220;harassment&#8221; at the hands of the IRS.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re sorry the feds have decided that no criminal charges were warranted. (That&rsquo;s our right, of course &mdash; Sharpton isn&rsquo;t the only one allowed to object to the outcome of criminal proceedings.)</p>
<p>As to why the feds decided to settle things civilly, who knows?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Or maybe those corporations recently reported by the The Post to have been paying Sharpton handsomely &mdash; right on the heels of his threats to target them with &#8220;racism&#8221; demonstrations &mdash; decided not to cooperate.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Then again, maybe the feds simply held the threat of an indictment over Sharpton&rsquo;s head until he agreed to a figure the IRS thought adequate.</p>
<p>Now, where might they have come up with that idea?<br>

<p>Yes that is a paradox. I cant figure out why they would let the black &#8220;reverand&#8221; off lightly either. We all know it has nothing to do with his race. Heck, Im white and Im sure if I owed $9 million in back taxes, they would let me off with a promise that I would pay up. Someday. </p>
<p>So what could it be?</p>

			<p>Two convenient fires and the asking of John Conyers to investigate his &#8220;harassment&#8221; at the hands of the IRS speaks volumns.   This guy has been getting away with murder ever since the Tawany Brawley hoax and the outrageous slander of Steven Pagones.  Sharpton also played a key role in leading a protest and a boycott against Freddy&rsquo;s Clothing store in Harlem.  A store owned by a Jewish man.  Because of the Sharpton led boycott and protest, the store was burned and 7 people were killed. <br>
These incidents were clearly based on racial animosity but Sharpton now hold himself out as a civil rights leader who recomended the firing of Don Imus because of a stupid joke.</p>
<p>The big question is why the IRS cutting Sharpton any slack at all. </p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;accepting instead the reverend&rsquo;s promise to make good on up to $9 million in unpaid back taxes, interest and penalties&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah, just like he paid the judgment to Steve Pagones in the Tawana Brawley case:</p>
<p>According to Larry Elder:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;A jury unanimously concluded that Sharpton defamed Pagones, ordering Sharpton to pay $65,000 to Pagones. The Reverend promptly announced his intention not to pay. A couple years later, Sharpton&rsquo;s buddies passed the hat and paid off Sharpton&rsquo;s debt, which totaled $87,000 with interest and penalties. To this day, never having paid one penny of his own to Pagones, Sharpton refuses to apologize, &#8216;I did what I believed&hellip;.They are asking me to grovel&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The increasingly irrelevant MSM has given this White-hating charlatan pass after pass after pass&hellip;</p>
<p>William Anderson from LewRockwell.com concludes this about rev sharpton:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;the media never tire of hearing lies from Al Sharpton and his allies. Sharpton&rsquo;s criminal &mdash; yes, criminal &mdash; role in the Brawley case should have disqualified him from ever being quoted again in any decent publication&hellip;Instead, Sharpton is constantly feted as a hero, makes a grand living&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Thank God for the Internet.  Peter Brimlowe from vdare.com believes it is as important an invention as the printing press.</p>

			<p>Where exactly will he get the $9 million he owes the IRS?  From extorting hard-working &#8220;white&#8221; Americans of course.</p>
<p>We need to setup a web site listing all of the corporations that donate to Sharpton and Jackson and start our own boycott.</p>

			<p>I said in another tax related post that I owed less than $8,000.00 and the IRS was ruthless and threatening about paying up. The IRS didn&rsquo;t negotiate with Al Capone or John Gotti about paying up and those men would have been able to have the families of the IRS agents killed!!!! so what does the Al have on these people that they would fear more than having their families murdered????</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m just happy what Sharpton and Jackson have done to the title of reverend. It&rsquo;s not only meaningless it has a negative connotation associated with it now, especially for a black reverend.</p>

			<p>LET me see if I got this right.  The IRS is willing to take Sharpton&rsquo;s promise to make good on up to $9 million in unpaid back taxes?</p>
<p>HIS PROMISE TO MAKE GOOD?????  Everything we hear about the IRS collections of unpaid taxes is anything but accepting a &#8220;PROMISE&#8221; to make good some at undetermined time in the future.  </p>
<p>It took Sharpton years and years to pay the judgment on his defamation case on the Tawana Brawley case.&#92;   </p>
<p><br>
The IRS usually levies on any property the taxpayer has to satisfy the back taxes.  They will slap a lien on any remaining property.  In lesser cases they may set up a payment schedule and a strict installment plan and woe be the taxpayer if he misses payments.  THen they will levy everything he owns, including his retirement accounts.</p>
<p>The hard line should apply to Sharpton after he has had not one but two fires destroying his records.  AND if you believe that &hellip;</p>
<p>The bottom line is that the IRS is afraid of Al and Jesse and therefore they can do anything they want.  <br>
I&rsquo;m sure both Al and Jesse agree with what Leona Helmsley said, &#8220;We don&rsquo;t pay taxes.  Only little people pay taxes.&#8221;</p>

			<p>I see no reason why the IRS or FBI has to be afraid of these high profile black race hustlers. Sure there would be some fuss and some name calling on the current administration (&#8220;anti-black&#8221;, &#8220;racist&#8221;, etc. ) if they went after them like they would anyone else, but it is really only cowardice and perceived political expediency that lets these con artists get off with minimal trouble. </p>
<p>The problem has never been &#8220;black power&#8221; but White patronization &amp; cravenness. To pay the IRS back - if he decides to get around to it - I suspect he&rsquo;ll just make even more intimidation extortions from White controlled corporations. </p>
<p>Letting these &#8220;black leaders&#8221; off the hook only encourages more ripoffs by race-hustlers - most irresponsible.  </p>

			<p>Well my foolish white brothers and sisters, now you have seen more of the Preview Of Things To Come, the tip of the iceburg so to speak. Wait to see the good old USA if this Obama gets elected, and for him to get elected WHITES would have to vote him in. Go to Detroit and you will see a very good example of Black Leadership in action. Even the tought of it is an obamanation to me..</p>
