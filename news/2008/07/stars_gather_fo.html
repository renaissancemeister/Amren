<h1>Stars Gather for Nelson Mandela Birthday Show</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jill Lawless, AP, June 27, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Queen, Leona Lewis, Amy Winehouse and a host of African stars joined tens of thousands of music fans Friday to salute Nelson Mandela at a concert honoring the South African statesman&rsquo;s 90th birthday.</p>
<p>The outdoor show in London&rsquo;s Hyde Park opened in eclectic style with Jivan Gasparyan, an Armenian master of the duduk wooden flute, followed by British band Razorlight.</p>
<p>Organizers said Bono and The Edge from the Irish band U2 had recorded a version of &#8220;Happy Birthday&#8221; that would be shown on big screens during the show.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Proceeds from the show &mdash; which organizers hope would be attended by 46,664 people &mdash; will go to 46664, the AIDS charity named for the number Mandela wore while imprisoned for opposing South Africa&rsquo;s apartheid regime.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Josh Groban and the Soweto Gospel Choir were also lined up for the event, hosted by Will Smith and held to mark Mandela&rsquo;s birthday on July 18.</p>
<p>It also came 20 years after a 70th birthday concert at Wembley Stadium that helped press South Africa&rsquo;s apartheid authorities for Mandela&rsquo;s freedom.</p>
<p>Queen guitarist Brian May said the event was &#8220;as important and as joyful as anything we&rsquo;ve done in our lives, and has a great serious significance as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Annie Lennox, who performed at the 1988 show as part of Eurythmics, was scheduled to sing Friday. Also on the lineup are reggae star Eddy Grant, girl group Sugababes and African artists including Emmanuel Jal, Johnny Clegg and Papa Wemba.</p>
<p>Jim Kerr of Scottish band Simple Minds, which also played the 1988 show and was due to perform again Friday, said the mood was very different 20 years on.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was angry the last time,&#8221; Kerr said. &#8220;It was very much a protest concert. This is a joyful occasion.&#8221;<br>

<p>Jim Kerr of the Scottish band Simple Minds? I think that says it all.</p>
<p>You know, far from being tolerant and enlightened, the society we live in has got to be one of the most brutal and unthinking societies in history.</p>
<p>Here we have a bunch drug-addicted, washed up, three chord barbarians partying on down with a man who is considered by many to be the greatest man alive  &mdash;  if not the greatest man who ever lived  &mdash;  and I can guarantee that no one other than us sees the absurdity of this.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Statesman, Joyful&#8221;, why is he not celebrating in South Africa? I guess living in White areas is what he now prefers, same as the beloved Rev. Wright moving to an all White area in Chigago as he gives the finger to the beloved Blacks he leaves behind.</p>

&#8220;&hellip;This is a joyful occasion&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Spoken by Jim Kerr of the appropriately named Simple Minds.</p>
<p>Yes, for simple leftist minds there is much to celebrate!  SA is SO much better off since Mandela wrested control of the government from Evil White Racists, is it not?</p>
<p>Discover the Network reports on the great accomplishments of the ANC since 1994:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;Since then, the largely unsuccessful administrations of Mandela and his hand-picked successor, Thabo Mbeki, have plunged what was once an orderly and somewhat prosperous country into an abyss of crime and poverty&hellip;.More economic difficulty looms as black businesses attempt to expropriate the wealth and property of white-owned enterprises.</p>
<p>Crime has been rampant and largely underreported by the press&hellip;. The rate of rape against women, both white and black, has been extraordinary.  The rape of children, sometimes in exchange for cash payments to the parents, has also been on the rise.  Crimes against white farmers have been on the increase, with at least 6,000 attacks leading to 1,600 murders and innumerable rapes and assaults reported since the end of apartheid.  Overall estimates of those killed in all violent crimes in the country since 1991 total 230,000.</p>
<p>Incidents of HIV infection have been rising steadily, fueled in part by the declaration of Mandela&rsquo;s successor, President Mbeki, that AIDS is not linked to the HIV virus.  The country&rsquo;s hospitals have, for the most part, deteriorated, and diseases long thought to be cured have returned.  Much of the road system, sewer systems, and the electrical grid have fallen into decay. ..&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gee, who wouldn&rsquo;t want to immigrate to the &lsquo;joyous&rsquo; ANC paradise of SA after Mandela took control?</p>

			<p>&#8220;Isn&rsquo;t the &#8220;Queen&#8221; of Queens dead?&#8221; posted by 6:44 PM.</p>
<p>Freddie Mercury (Farrokh Bulsara), lead singer of Queen, was a bisexual who died 24 Nov 1991 of complications from AIDs.  Mercury&rsquo;s ashes are at Kensal Green Cemetery, where also rest the remains of other greats such as Wilkie Collins, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, William Makepeace Thackery, and Anthony Trollope, among others.  John Deacon retired from Queen following Mercury&rsquo;s death, but Brian May and Roger Taylor have attempted to revive the rock group in recent years with a replacement singer.  If memory serves, Mercury got his start selling bric-a-brac and second-hand clothes from an antique stall on Portobello Road.  It is a supreme irony that &#8220;moderate&#8221; Islamic groups engineered the cancellation of Mercury&rsquo;s (posthumous) 60th birthday celebration, on grounds that his sexual orientation was incompatible with Islam.  The insult to this great rock star was gratuitous, because the man was not Muslim   &mdash;  he was of Persian and Zoroastrian heritage and proud of his British citizenship.  It should also be noted that Freddie Mercury and Queen were blacklisted by the United Nations because they violated the UN boycott of white South Africa by performing at Sun City, which was then located in one of the former apartheid Bantustans. </p>

I expect Rice WILL be in SA shortly, to accompany Mbeke to the inaugural ball of Mugabe&rsquo;s landslide victory in the presidential election. And she will say glowing things of all the African leaders of course, and pay homage to Mandela. hahahaha</p>

No African can even understand the true meaning of peaceful resistance since they are not an advanced race, it&rsquo;s not in them. MLK didn&rsquo;t advocate violence but he knew that the tough no nonsense whites would have really taken care of rioters, murderers, and looters with relish if they tried this back then. </p>

			<p>Maybe old Nelson can get up on stage and &#8220;necklace&#8221; a few of his competitors for old time sake. He can start with Bonehead and go on from there. Won&rsquo;t need lights and it&rsquo;ll give the whole affair that proper authenticity that our liberal friends worship.</p>

			<p>   According to the Human Rights Commission, during the 46 year Apartheid era 1948-94, 21,000 Africans died in political violence, of which 92% died as a result of black on black inter-tribal political violence. <br>
 In the 6 year post Apartheid period, 1994-2000, according to the South African government&rsquo;s site at that time, 174,220 people died violently in SA. See: https://www.saps.org.za. God knows how many more have died in the 8 years since 2000, but the Government of Mbeki won&rsquo;t release the current figures.<br>
  This is a tragedy of massive proportions and yet the world is strangely mute. They continue to rejoice over the transitioned South Africa, birthday parties and rock singers and dancing. The Simple Minds fella says he is not angry at this concert like he was at the last one. Why not? Don&rsquo;t 174,000 plus dead Africans mean anything to him? <br>
 Mandela should have been encouraged to celebrate his birthday quietly and with dignity, not like this while his fellow countrymen are dropping like flies.<br>
 <br>
It&rsquo;s this kind of carry on confirms my belief that people who led all those boycotts and demonstrations years ago cared nothing whatsoever for Africans, they only bore hatred for White Capitalists. <br>
Nauseating.<br>

			<p>Yeah, the two things about this that stick out are, </p>
<p>1- That no one is comparing post-Apartheid with pre-Apartheid South Africa.</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>2- That the celebration is, as others here have noted, being held in fashionable London and not in crime-ridden and deadly dangerous Johanesburg.</p>
<p>This is no small thing.</p>
<p>Here they all are, these people who were protesting on his behalf for years and years.  What better way to show what a good thing it was that they did.  What better way to show that were a part of &#8220;History&#8221; and that releasing this man was a good thing, then to go to South Africa and honor him in HIS Country!.</p>
<p>But no, they are so pathologically dishonest and f-ing creepy with their addiction to self-righteousness (which ALWAYS demands an &#8220;enemy&#8221;) that they ignore the failure that IS South Africa, but at the same time partcipate in the demonization of James Watson for the speaking the truth.  A truth based on experience with a subject those who denounced him know nothing about!!!!!!<br>
Could this be the reason Mr. Self-Righteousness himself, Bono, didn&rsquo;t attend?  <br>
Either way, it wasn&rsquo;t exactly an A-list.  But then, Celebrity has degenerated so much now that there is no more A-list.<br>

			<p>&#8220;Maybe old Nelson can get up on stage and &ldquo;necklace&rdquo; a few of his competitors for old time sake.&#8221;</p>
<p>No, he&rsquo;d be castigated by Bono for increasing his carbon footprint.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;How funny, No nation or culture has been more violent and brutalized, tortured and wiped out other nations and cultures than Whites, yea, advance in the art of killing and deception, you are 100% right on that one&hellip;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Superior IQs produce superior weapons. Germs introduced by Whites helped as well.</p>
<p>What with our history of violence and brutality you&rsquo;d think non-Whites would want to keep away from us by &#8216;any means necessary.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Why do you think non-Whites risk life and limb to enter White-created countries?  Why would any non-White want to live around Whites?</p>
<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t non-Whites shun and scorn everything  Whites have created  &mdash;  our First World cities, our modern technology, clean water, modern medicine, financial systems that work?</p>
<p>Why is it that non-Whites are not able to create a First World society for themselves?  They are not even capable of copying what we&rsquo;ve done to re-create our societies without falling completely apart  &mdash;  SA and Zim are fine examples.</p>
<p>Oh Yeah!  Must be White high IQ AND creativity at work.</p>

			<p>Nelson Mandela is an international socialist propaganda tool of the power elitists on London and Wallstreet.<br>
After imposing Socialism and communism on South Africa they were able to exploit South Africa&rsquo;s mineral wealth after overiding the country with blacks.<br>
Two long term goals now achieved.</p>

			<p><i>&hellip;imprisoned for opposing South Africa&rsquo;s apartheid regime.</i></p>
<p>No, he was imprisoned because he was caught with tons (literally) of weapons lovingly supplied by the Soviet Union. His reasons are irrelevant. He was charged and convicted of a crime and sentenced accordingly. Nobody has ever called it trumped up charges or a show-trial. Mandela is a killer and a criminal. Nothing more.</p>

			<p>This is a celebration that stupidity has won the day and possibly the era of stupidity is in ascendancy.  Hooray!          obama &#8216;08/tire necklaces &#8216;09</p>
