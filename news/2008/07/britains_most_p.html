						<p>Some of Britain&rsquo;s most popular television programmes including the Vicar of Dibley and Who Wants to be a Millionaire have been criticised for being &#8220;too white&#8221; in a report led by Trevor Phillips, the equality chief.</p>
<p>The research found that Black and Asian viewers felt that despite the growing number of ethnic minorities living in the UK, they still felt under-represented on hit television shows.</p>
<p>When non-whites did appear in dramas and soaps, they said they were often &#8220;token&#8221; characters who were stereotyped as Asian shopkeepers, such as the character Dev in Coronation Street, and black single mothers like Denise in EastEnders.</p>
<p>Viewers praised reality shows like the X Factor, Strictly Come Dancing and The Apprentice, in which ethnic minorities were defined by their talents rather than their skin colour.</p>
<p>However, they criticised shows such as Hollyoaks, Who Wants To Be a Millionaire, Friends and the Vicar of Dibley for consistently not having enough ethnic minority characters.</p>
<p>Mr Phillips, the chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said that all the evidence showed that television was still &#8220;hideously white where it matters&#8221;, a reference to those in senior roles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most ethnic minority participants felt the media had a responsibility to reflect Britain&rsquo;s diversity across all genres and was failing to do so in three main ways: by relying on tokenistic and stereotyped representation of characters; by representing extreme and exaggerated characters; and by failing to reflect the realities of contemporary ethnic minority culture,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;All these shortcomings were attributed to some extent to the perceived lack of a representative power base within UK media.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study was commissioned by Channel 4 following the Celebrity Big Brother race row last year when Jade Goody and glamour model Danielle Lloyd rounded on Shilpa Shetty, the Bollywood star.</p>
<p>Black and Asian viewers said they were concerned that white viewers got the wrong impression of ethnic minority groups because they were often inaccurately portrayed on screen.</p>
<p>Muslim respondents said that a recent episode of Wife Swap featured a Muslim family where the mother was &#8220;completely over the top&#8221;, while Asian dramas often focused on arranged marriages.</p>
<p>One Indian woman told researchers: &#8220;We would like to see a more realistic view of Asians. A lot of Asians are professionals and educated and we don&rsquo;t just work in corner shops.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another black Caribbean man said: &#8220;They don&rsquo;t portray black people doing different roles and in every aspect of every field, like doctors, lawyers and architects.&#8221;</p>
<p>The research comes only weeks after Dr Samir Shah, a non-executive director at the BBC, accused broadcasters of rampant tokenism in their programming.</p>
<p>He claimed that a &#8220;tick-box approach&#8221; to showing non-whites had left minority viewers feeling embarrassed and irritated.</p>
<p>His comments echoed those of Lenny Henry, the comedian, who claimed that television was still being dominated by white faces.</p>
<p>He said that urgent steps were needed to give people who did not benefit from an Oxbridge education the chance to get a job in the industry.</p>
<p>In 2001, Greg Dyke, the former BBC director general, attacked the corporation seven years ago for being &#8220;hideously white&#8221; and promised to make it more diverse.<br>

			<p>Not only are their shows forced to meet a demographic quota, but they have to place them in roles which potray non-whites in only the rosiest light, as higher ups in the professional world. No matter how much they like to claim otherwise, most African do not arrive in Britain with degrees in hand. London and South East England is teeming with unemployed, uneducated, minorities and asylum seekers. As for Trevor Phillips, he is a British born black who works for Labour and pushing multiculturalism on the masses. He even wrote a book titled Windbrush: Irresistable rise of multiculturalism in Britain.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t know how it works over there, but can&rsquo;t they start their own networks?  The minute these &#8220;hit shows&#8221; are overrun with unrealistic portrayals of minorities, they will cease to be hits.</p>

			<p>If the popular shows are white, perhaps there is a reason for it.  I suspect when the viewers return home from a day of having &#8220;diversity&#8221; shoved down their throats, the last thing they want when they turn on the telly is more of the same.</p>

 It made me think. I never really thought of it, but in a way The French Resistence was fighting it`s own government as well as the Nazis. The British never needed a resistence movement, but there must be some Commando blood out there somewhere.</p>

			<p>At least they haven&rsquo;t started editing older shows, changing skin tones and facial features. The Soviets did something like that after Stalin died, and they started removing him from all the old propaganda movies. Of course this wasn&rsquo;t easy for the technology of the time, and it usually looked incredibly cheesy, but still they did it.<br>
I wonder if Clive Anderson is still allowed to be on television over there. That is one beautifully fair man, even if he has no neck and hair!</p>

			<p>Nothing more unbelievable than a black man living in a white country and getting knighted by a white queen, for complaining everything he sees is hideously white. I find Zimbabwe hideously black. Must be why it also hideously hungry. Think Mugabe will bestow a wonderous title on me for it?</p>

			<p>From this side of the &#8220;pond&#8221;, it&rsquo;s difficult to conduct a fair analysis of British T.V., but I suspect Trevor Phillips, the so-called &#8220;equality chief&#8221; is just following the mandate of his <i>Orwellian</i> job description and needs to stir up the <i>racial animosity pot</i> simply to satisfy his social-engineering bosses.</p>
<p>But, is there flip-side to this story that contains an <a href="https://elliotlakenews.wordpress.com/2007/05/10/institutional-racism-in-britain/" rel="nofollow"><br>
anti-white bias </a> as well?</p>

			<p>Back when I was growing up we were taught geography.  Britain is white.  Africa is black.  China is oriental.  If blacks want to see a lot of blacks, they can go to africa.  If the chinese want some really authentic chinese culture, well, there&rsquo;s China or Taiwan, or even Singapore.  </p>
<p>The race hustlers bitch and moan so the cowed whites put a few colored faces on TV.  Then the race hustlers cry tokenism.  When will Whites wake up and say, &#8220;get out of my land!!!&#8221;???</p>

			<p>&#8220;Hideously white&#8221;  &mdash;    What would Malcolm X or some other black power type have said about brainwashing and self-hate if a black person had referred to something as &#8220;hideously black&#8221;.  Racially awakened whites have to confront people like Mr. Phillips with their mental illness.  </p>

			<p>What is so hideous about Whites is they still cling to their imposed guilts and suppress any meaningful thoughts about being superior in any endeavour.  The reason blacks and muslims don&rsquo;t have any hit shows is because they are inferior writers and thinkers.  Case closed.</p>

			<p>This is ridiculous! The UK is 92% white, and none of the minorities in the country make up more than 2% on there own. How much screen time should they get? The Vicar of Dibley is set in an area of England that is mostly white, just liked the rest of England, and it&rsquo;s set in a village! (places I looked in the area it is meant to be set are around 98% white) What would you expect! </p>

			<p>It is against the law for whites to keep to themselves   &mdash;   even when they do it over the airwaves.</p>
<p>Freedom of association has been dead for a long time. But are we now witnessing the death knell of freedom of speech and expression? Is British TV going to follow the trend in children&rsquo;s media where every book, video, DVD or whatever has to have several blacks, Asians, Hispanics etc?</p>
<p>Benny Hill, the Goodies, Dad&rsquo;s Army, All Creatures Great and Small, Masterpiece Theatre and many other British TV productions are classics for a number of reasons, one of which is their celebration of white European culture. The diversity nazis have to be stopped before they can destroy what&rsquo;s left of our civilization.</p>

			<p>Funny, I&rsquo;ve been thinking how over-represented blacks are on UK TV - they are only 2% of the population.  Who Wants To Be A Millionaire is a general knowledge quiz. To get into the chair you need a very fast mental reaction time to put a number of items in order.  I&rsquo;ve never seen a black face on this show. There are a number of other EASY money-winning quizzes which ALWAYS have black people on.  In 25 years I&rsquo;ve never seen a black face on Countdown, an anagram/maths quiz. Personally I find music programmes and sports contain far too many blacks - more diversity there, please, Mr Phillips.  On reflection, there are so many blacks on UK TV, you would think the main channels represented London, not the whole country.  There are some programmes that are unwatchable they are so absurdly PC. The Bill is a cop show, supposedly set in a region of London. I would say a fantasy region of London since many of the police and forensics experts are black whereas all the criminals are white - a complete reversal of the reality.  </p>
<p>Clever Trevor Phillips should get together with other blacks from the hood and create a black TV channel.  I&rsquo;m starting to think blacks see whites as their parents whose job it is to satisfy their every whim.</p>
<p>Write to me, Trevor, we need to talk about this music/sport problem.</p>

			<p>Great Britain was on the winning side of WWII yes?  No one has forced them to take every third world refugee that can muster transport to the UK.  The good thing is I read this article on the Dailymail website and I could have sworn I was reading AMREN based on the comments.  People are waking up to how destructive this absurd notion of multicult really is. Mr. Trevor &#8220;Hideously Black&#8221; Philips needs to understand that England is not his country and never will be, he just happens to be taking up space there.</p>

			<p>There&rsquo;s reason for hope.  &#8216;Family Guy&rsquo; is now shown on BBC3.  Cleveland Brown enjoys a great deal of screen time.  In addition FG is responsible for presenting Brian&rsquo;s interracial/interspecies love affair with Shauna Parks.  As Mr. Phillips (and Stewie) might say, &#8216;That&rsquo;s the good stuff.&rsquo;</p>

			<p>I bet if one examined T.V. shows in Africa, he&rsquo;d find that all of them are &#8220;hideously black&#8221;.  In the Middle East, they&rsquo;d be &#8220;hideously Arab&#8221;.  In East Asia they&rsquo;d be &#8220;hideously Asian&#8221;.  Other races don&rsquo;t seem to have a problem representing their own ethnicity through their media so why should whites?</p>

			<p>The reason is simple.  It is a commercial decision where people will watch what they want to watch.  There are now about 200 plus channels on British satellite TV and it is so easy to press a button to another channel if you do not like what is on.  there are stations for Muslims, blacks with US comedies and mediocre (to us) Nigerian films and programmes for the many Nigerians living in Britain; Asian programmes including Indian news channels and so on.   </p>
<p>But the masses will not be entertained by a programme just because the participants are non-white. They have to be entertaining because they are, no other reasons.   That is a fact so Mr. Philips, live with it unless you can make black programmes attractive to the masses without their freedom of choice being usurped.   </p>
<p>Also, I am sure that the law has been broken in the UK by calling programmes &#8220;hideously white&#8221;,  Try calling some hideously black, and the first to scream would be Mr Phillips who has a job paid for by taxpayers to ensure there are no racial problems in the UK, but here he is causing one.</p>

			<p>I suppose that one way Mr. Trevor Phillips will resolve this affront is to use &#8216;War Veterans&rsquo; to seize the land of white British farmers, ala Mugabe.  </p>
<p>Give them the fullness of time.  This will come up and will happen.  </p>
<p>British farmers murdered, their families raped and murdered, their barns burned to the ground, their cattle and sheep slaughtered, their tractors and equipment destroyed.  Columns of thick black smoke raising into the air over Scotland, Wales, the Lake District. </p>
<p>And not a peep will appear in London newspapers as to do so would not be politically correct.  Not to mention that those same London newspapers will only be available in Urdu, Swahili and Arabic.  </p>

<p>It always goes one way. Overrepresented is OK . under represented is not.</p>
<p>Why not just get rid of all the whites?</p>

			<p>I suppose this is the &#8220;hideous&#8221; sort of comment you&rsquo;d expect from someone whose raison d&rsquo;etre consists of making incendiary comments against British Eurowhites. The depth of his depravity was observed as he laughed heartily over a &#8220;hideous&#8221; joke about dancing with the queen and her colostomy bag. Mr. Phillips should follow his roots and go back to Guyana and search for Jonestown which might have a few hovels left for his miserable existence.</p>

<p>Being too White in England being a normal and allowed criticism is the final doom of Britain and the White race.  If they in England cannot see what this means and don&rsquo;t act on it, the notion of being too White in the world will soon follow.  We are already a world minority.</p>

			<p>Knighting a blackman who criticizes whites for being white will be the downfall of the British Monarchy.  Does Queen Elizabeth ll want her great, great grandchildren to be mulatto?  We may soon have a break dancing mulatto president, will the Royals feel pressured to keep up?  Has it really come to that?</p>

			<p>If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, Dawn French, the&#8221;star&#8221; of the Vicar of Dibley is married to a semi-talented black &#8220;comedian&#8221;. Not even race traitors are good enough for our thought police.</p>

			<p>To say that something is &#8216;hideously white&rsquo; is to imply that &#8216;white is hideous.&rsquo; Racial blasphemy.</p>

			<p>JTaverner, what you&rsquo;re saying is that Buchanan&rsquo;s thesis in his latest book is right on target.  The decadent West was led by fools and blunderers. You see the results now.</p>

			<p>&#8220;<i>To get into the chair you need a very fast mental reaction time to put a number of items in order. I&rsquo;ve never seen a black face on this show.</i>&#8221; By Eugene at 11:12 PM on July 17</p>
<p>The U.S. quiz show named &#8220;Jeopardy&#8221; also has a noticeable absence of Black folks despite numbering about 40 million people in the country. On the rare occurrence when a Black does succeed in becoming a contestant, it becomes a rather noticeable anomaly if one pays attention to these politically-incorrect details.</p>
<p>Of course, to make up for that glaring short-fall, the producers have a black woman offering the <i>answer-clue</i> to contestants through short video clips on occasion.</p>

			<p>What&rsquo;s good about this though is all the comments by the Brits on the Telegraph&rsquo;s website. The anti-racists are predictably over pleying their hand consistently, especially the dumb non-white component. They just keep making our point for us over and over.</p>

			<p>&#8221;The research found that Black and Asian viewers felt that despite the growing number of ethnic minorities living in the UK, they still felt under-represented on hit television shows&#8221;.</p>
<p>A year or two ago, &#8216;ex-Marxist&rsquo; Trevor Phillips, son of Guyanese immigrants &amp; for decades one of the UK&rsquo;s keenest proponents of diversity/equality, declared, with a straight face, what the vast majority of Britons had known for decades, that multiculturalism in the UK wasn&rsquo;t working. Instead of falling on his sword this racist money-grubbing hustler and his New Labour cronies came up with a few cosmetic changes and renamed this pseudo-Marxist institution The Equalities and Human Rights Commission, and, like the blind leading the blind, proceeded to carry on with business as usual. I guess poor oppressed Trev can&rsquo;t hack it in the real world as he went from Communist student radical to government appointee with a six-figure salary without ever having a proper job. I suppose he would give us that old race-hustler&rsquo;s maxim that he is a &#8216;work in progress, whom God isn&rsquo;t finished with yet&rsquo;. His own EHRC is entirely staffed with minority appointees. I guess it&rsquo;s too much to expect this holier-than-thou Marxist hypocrite to practise what he preaches. Ethnic minorities, especially blacks are vastly over-represented in the UK media and I guess this latest initiative is a ploy to put blacks in charge of the media. I don&rsquo;t think even the brainwashed British public could tolerate a deluge of Zimbabwe-style &#8216;black entertainment programs&rsquo; run by these brothers.</p>
<p>If Mr. Phillips would perhaps leave our homeland and use his experience in the &#8216;race relations industry&rsquo; &amp; go back to Guyana, he might witness the violence in that country where maurauding black gangs continually attack Asians forcing many of them to immigrate. It seems like these same people that cry oppression by whites in the UK are at each other&rsquo;s throats when ole whitey isn&rsquo;t there to take the blame. And while he&rsquo;s there, could he please tell us how many race-relations organisations for white people are established in that South American beacon of enlightenment.</p>

			<p>Not strictly on-topic, but The Vicar of Dibley isn&rsquo;t &#8220;hideously white&#8221;; it&rsquo;s just hideously unfunny.</p>
<p>Still, back on-topic, it&rsquo;s incredible to me that a man supposedly responsible for &#8220;equality&#8221; (however that slippery term might be interpreted) can feel free to use a blatantly racial slur against one ethnic group in UK society (admittedly the largest, longest-settled and, until recently, culturally dominant) which he would be the first to condemn were anyone else to use it against any other group. </p>
<p>He is clearly using Marxist categories to justify this unequal treatment, i.e. assuming that the whites (as a &#8220;hegemonic&#8221; group) cannot be the victims of racism (including his own).</p>

			<p>&#8220;Britain&rsquo;s Most Popular Television Programmes &lsquo;Too White&rsquo;, Says Trevor Phillips,&#8221;</p>
<p>Does that mean he thinks the Zimbabwe and South African governments are too black?  </p>
<p>If not, why not?</p>
<p>If so, what&rsquo;s he doing about it?</p>

			<p>I absolutely &#8220;LOVE&#8221; that British comedy series running locally on PBS, called: LAST OF THE SUMMER WINE!</p>
<p>It is Brit humor at its best. If they had tried to introduce Blacks into the cast, instead of the longest-running (30+ years) comedy series, it would undoubtedly have been a dismal failure. They do have one Black   &mdash;   a constable. But more than that would have been absurd, considering locale, time frame, etc.</p>
