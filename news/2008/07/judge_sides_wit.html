						<p>The Washington Redskins have won the latest round in a 16-year court battle against a group of American Indians, prevailing on a technicality that again skirts the issue of whether the team&rsquo;s nickname is racially offensive.</p>
<p>In a ruling dated June 25 and first circulated Thursday, U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly ruled that the youngest of the seven Native American plaintiffs waited too long after turning 18 to file the lawsuit that attempts to revoke the Redskins trademarks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[The lead plaintiff, Suzan Shown Harjo] and her fellow plaintiffs have been working since 1992 to have the Redskins trademarks declared invalid. They initially won &mdash; the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office panel canceled the trademarks in 1999 &mdash; but Kollar-Kotelly overturned the ruling in 2003 in part because the suit was filed decades after the first Redskins trademark was issued in 1967.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The judge did not address whether the Redskins name is offensive or racist. She wrote that her decision was not based on the larger issue of &#8220;the appropriateness of Native American imagery for team names.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The case now heads back to the U.S. Court of Appeals. Should it agree that Harjo&rsquo;s group was too old to sue, she has a backup plan: A group of six American Indians ranging in age from 18 to 24 filed essentially the same lawsuit two years ago. That suit is on hold until Harjo&rsquo;s case is resolved.</p>
<p>Harjo therefore anticipates that one day, a court will have to decide once and for all whether the Redskins name is offensive.</p>

			<p>Got to love the USA.  We all have to wait until a judge can tell us whether or not we should be offended by the term &#8220;Redskin&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Good Ruling But .. The Native American has never been our problem. My question is when are these judges going to grow some gonads when it comes to blacks and illegals??</p>

			<p>I would be great if the Redskin name was barred.  This would be one of the few times where Washington gets a taste of the dictatorship they impose on the rest of the country. </p>

If they don&rsquo;t get what they want now, they will later.</p>
<p>But to what end? Will it change their station in life? Will they regain lost respect?</p>
<p>Even if they get their victory, nothing will change. These are silly and meaningless actions. They might be funny if they didn&rsquo;t actually believe this would make a difference in their daily lives.</p>

			<p>This is one of those issues where there&rsquo;s a total disconnect between a group of people and those who claim to speak for them. Every Indian I&rsquo;ve ever talked to about the subject either liked the Indian mascots or didn&rsquo;t really care one way or the other.</p>
<p>The biggest Redskins fan I ever met was a Navajo woman who was my boss. There&rsquo;s even an Indian reservation around here whose high school football team is named&hellip;yep, you guessed it: &#8220;the Redskins.&#8221;</p>

			<p>The team should drop the &#8220;Redskins&#8221; nickname and change it to the Washington &#8220;Cavalry.&#8221;  Oh, and how long before the city name of &#8220;Washington&#8221; is dropped, didn&rsquo;t he own slaves or something?</p>

			<p>I used to know some Navajo Indians and the Redskins were their favorite team. They considered the Cowboys vs. Redskins game the biggest of the year and more important than the Superbowl.</p>

<p>You forget licensed products, the popularity of the team logo and the team itself. Give some thought also to the many franchised sports apparel companies and then, THEN!! think nothing will change. I suspect a lot of money will change hands instead of having to change the entire Redskins logo and licensing distribution network. Anybody ever see the museum of the &#8220;Pequot&#8221; Indians in Groton, Conn?? the museum display is of lightly tanned caucasions while the picture of the current Pequot Indian population appear to be a bunch of blacks in front of a mobile home on blocks.</p>

<p>Can&rsquo;t get more in-your-face than that.</p>

			<p>While I don&rsquo;t support legislation to ban team names, I do see how the name &#8220;Redskins&#8221; can be offensive.  Imagine if there was some football team that was majority-nonwhite that called themselves the &#8220;Whiteskins&#8221;.</p>

			<p>As a Washingtonian my whole life, I&rsquo;ve never had a problem with the name Redskins.</p>
<p>Of course I&rsquo;m not a redskin.</p>
<p>The entire issue of race is no business of the federal government, and this is why anti-discrimination laws are so immoral.  How does the federal government have the right to tell me what I can call my football team?</p>
<p>What next?  Is the imagery associated with the &#8220;Vikings&#8221; offensive?</p>

			<p>The greatest example of this Indian idiocy was the case of Stanford University, which changed its athletic nickname from the indians to the cardinals. What people wouldnt want the name of their group associated with one of the finest universities in the world???</p>

			<p>I am partly Amerind - 3/16.  I was once called a &#8220;quarter-breed blanket head&#8221;.  That was intended to be mildly offensive, but was no big deal.  It&rsquo;s like calling me a &#8220;cheap-*ssed Scotsman.&#8221;  The only fighting words where my own self is concerned are calling me a liar or a coward.  I AM (almost) a quarter-breed &#8220;blanket-head&#8221;.  I AM a &#8220;cheap-*ssed Scotsman.  I am not a liar or a coward.</p>
<p>My hair is sandy brown, my eyes are gray, my complexion is Gaelic-fair and I grow a good moustache and beard (slowly), but I tan quickly - a dark reddish brown.</p>
<p>These folks are complaining about nothing.</p>
