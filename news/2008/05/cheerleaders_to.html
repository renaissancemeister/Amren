						<p>Two London cheerleaders hired to entertain crowds at India&rsquo;s Twenty20 cricket premier league have accused organisers of racism.</p>
<p>Ellesha Newton and Sherinne Anderson say they were banned from performing because they had &#8220;dark skin&#8221; and told to sit out of the opening routine at the India Premier League&rsquo;s inaugural match in Chandigarh.</p>
<p>They said they were left sobbing as Team Chennai and Team Mohali took to the field and that event organisers told them only &#8220;white girls&#8221; would be allowed to perform.</p>
<p>Ms Newton, 22, from Islington, said they had been called &#8220;n*****s&#8221; and banned from performing.</p>
<p>She said: &#8220;An organiser pulled us away. He said the people here don&rsquo;t want to see dark people. The n***** word was used and they said they only wanted beautiful white girls.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ms Anderson, 25, from Hayes, added: &#8220;This kind of thing has never happened to us not in Europe, not here, nowhere. We are offended.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girls had been hired by Fierce Performance Productions which has offices in London and Bombay.</p>
<p>Director Jorge Aldana said the girls were eventually allowed to take part as cheerleaders after he intervened with local officials.</p>
<p>Several of India&rsquo;sTwenty20 cricket teams have hired American and British cheerleaders, including a number of black African-Americans, but this is the first allegation of racism.</p>
<p>The raunchy routines have caused outrage in the country, where protesters condemned their introduction as an insult to traditional Indian modesty.</p>
<p>Now India&rsquo;s Twenty20 organisers are braced for a fresh and potentially more damaging row over the cheerleaders&rsquo; allegations. Women&rsquo;s rights groups in India have condemned the organisers, and called for action to be taken.</p>
<p>The All India Democratic Women&rsquo;s Association, said: &#8220;Stopping anyone performing on the basis of colour of skin is not only illegal but unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Racism is rarely discussed in India, but African visitors, immigrants from Nepal face regular abuse.</p>
<p>The event management firm Wizcraft today denied the allegations and accused the women of having &#8220;an ulterior motive&#8221; for making them. A spokesman said: &#8220;They are totally fabricated.&#8221;</p>

			<p>  Anyone who has seen Bollywood pictures knows Indians don&rsquo;t like dark skinned women in their movies. The ideal type is the Punjabi who could easily pass for a Turk or Southern Italian. India is one of the most color conscious societies on earth. Any Indian who says otherwise is parroting political correct nonsense.  More than a few Indians have told me that Sophia Loren is their ideal women, and in the Punjab you can actually see some women like this.  </p>

			<p>Sherinne is cute as hell!  They can perform for my team anytime! I am not a great fan of black people, but there are some very nice people who are black and this young woman is a beautiful lady.  She and her co-cheerleader have been severely insulted in this case. She is a total babe regardless of race and I hope something is done about the people who insulted them. If Indians do not appreciate women like Sherinne, they have a real problem!  This is plain wrong!</p>

			<p>Why should other countries be forced to accept races they don&rsquo;t want.  It is obvious that White girls are much more prettier, have better shapes, prettier hair &amp; facial features then blacks.<br>
I have seen blacks preform &amp; they are the most vulgar cheerleaders I have ever seen.  A White girl can do the same rauncy routine &amp; still not look as nasty as a black girl.  Even though I oppose any raunchy dance routines, I rather see a White girl do it, then a black.<br>

			<p>Why are the Indians so upset.  We all know that their caste system puts the lightest at the top and the untouchable Dalits are the darkest, dark brown.</p>
<p>But this girl is obviously of African descent.  That is what Africans look like.</p>

<p>In fact, we had a situation here a few years back where the cheerleaders were engaging in such suggestive, overt behavior that they were suspended from performing for two games and were warned to tone down their dance routines.</p>
<p>I live in predominately White area of the nation and all of the cheerleders except for one (she was Latino) were White.</p>

			<p>The fact is most Indians find black Africans ugly (both men and women). Indians consider themselves a reasonably attractive race but do admire Iranians, Europeans etc&hellip; as well. Some years back when I was living in a student hall in my University with some other desi (S. Asian) friends in England. Oneday we were chatting near the window when we saw a black women wearing mini skirts walking by. As was our habit of staring at women wearing mini skirts we stared, and one of my friend said &#8220;Abbe, Isko kya dekh rahe ho, kawwa ant me kawwa hi hata hai&#8221; which translated in English is &#8220;Why are you guys staring at her, a crow at the end of the day is still a crow&#8221;. <br>
  Even though Indian men do find White women very attarctive (quite a lot find East Asians attractive as well), most Indians have a high opinion about subcon women. For a long time Aishwarya Rai was considered by many to be the most attractive woman ever, much more than any white woman. </p>

			<p>White people in general(men and women) are better looking. This is why Bollywood prefers lighter women as someone already mentioned. Even the darker, lower caste people prefer them.  Those girls are good looking for Black women. But, they are not good looking for South Asians.  And many South Asian women would look terrible to Whites while they would not look terrible me for my kinsmen and I. Unfortunately, the &#8220;White Man&rsquo;s Disease&#8221;(racial egalitarianism and other forms of state mandated egalitarianism) have come to India, but the masses don&rsquo;t believe in it nearly as much they do in Western countries.  </p>

			<p>9:22 PM: I don&rsquo;t watch raunchy routines, but if they are to be done, I&rsquo;d prefer that they be done by Blacks.  Public self-debasement is revolting by anyone, but I especially hate to see women of my own race bumping and grinding for the entertainment of juvenile yahoos.</p>

			<p>It is not a question of what colour they are and they are obviously gorgeous.  It is a question of those who pay the piper can legally call the tune.  Forget about the n&hellip;. comment; that is a ploy for sympathy and maybe a planned suit for massive damages.  The n-word is not at all common in Europe or especially Asia so is very unlikely to have been used.</p>

			<p>Only a very small proportion of black women are attractive, and even they detract from the uniformity of a lineup of women dancing as a team.</p>
<p>The Rockettes were openly all-white well into the 1980s, on artistic grounds: the whole point of the troupe is the visual style of seemingly identical women from end to end, stepping and kicking in perfect unison.  A black woman in the lineup is a jarring distraction, ruining the look.</p>
<p>No matter, the Rockettes were soon hammered into conformity.  Nothing is more important than the complaints of blacks, after all.</p>
<p>Same deal with showgirls, ballet companies, and all the rest.  Cheerleaders squads were no different.</p>
<p>Incidentally, has anyone noticed the &#8220;Bring It On&#8221; franchise of movies, in which evil white cheerleaders are defeated by black cheerleaders? </p>

<p>No, in fact it could get a White person arrested in Britain and in other parts of Europe. But still, Blacks love nothing more than blaming all forms of colorism, or racism on Whites. Not long ago, I caught one of Indias Fair and lovely advertisments on Youtube, and Blacks were ranting and raving about Indias favoritism for lighter skin, blaming it on colonialsim, and insisting that Whites have brainwashed them into favoring light skin. How ironic that when some Blacks are faced with these biases in India, the first thing they do is act shocked, and say that this sort of thing never happens in Europe.<br>

<p>That might be your take on it, but you can&rsquo;t legislate what a given culture should find attractive. It&rsquo;s common knowledge that most Indians find fair skinned women more desirable, which is why all of their female Bollywood icons are light skinned. If they won&rsquo;t even use dark skinned Indian women as models or actresses, why is it surprising they would not be interested in being entertained by Black British women of African descent?</p>

<p>-no the word for caste, varna, when properly translated, means &#8220;group&#8221;, and society was divided into four groups based on profession. </p>

			<p>As an Indian I must say that it never ceases to amaze me that blacks always wonder why other races find them ugly and repulsive. They protest and groan but they never question why their own black men find black women unattractive and lust after non-black women be it Europeans, Asian or Latino.</p>
<p>I must also add that that picture of the two of them disgusts me. It should not be considered wrong of me to have that opinion&hellip;..unless we are living in George Orwell&rsquo;s 1984 and I have committed a thought crime against cultural Marxism?</p>

			<p>Sherinne is adorable, and so is the other cute girl!  Surely the Indians can see that, even if they are not the traditional Indian standards for beauty.  The girls never should have been treated that way and they have my sympathy.      </p>
<p>On another note, thank goodness it wasn&rsquo;t whites who acted like this.  If it were we would never hear the end of it!  But you Amreners already know that. </p>

			<p>Yes, the Hindu Indians are race, color conscious, always have been.</p>
<p>Study the original caste system set up by the Northern Aryan invaders, conquerors (a people closely related to the Greeks and Trojans at the time of the Trojan war - similar gods).</p>
<p>The caste system was/is based on varna &#8220;color&#8221;, each caste, group is give honor and respect and presented with a positive life to do their best given their dharma - duty. Teachers teach, workers work, merchants sell, warriors fight, priests do the religious/spiritual ceremonies needed to keep the social system, individual souls in harmony with the holy order.</p>
<p>In bad, decaying time cycles the caste system breaks down, women mate outside of their caste (race mixing) and evil sweeps the world until the entire world is so corrupt and vile that the world is destroyed, in a positive way, a cleansing fire and a new, positive, clean world in harmony with nature&rsquo;s laws begins a new time cycle&hellip;</p>
<p>The Hindu religious laws, beliefs with strict prohibitions against race mixing and where Whiter is higher - it&rsquo;s a good system, Whites in the West should/have considered chucking the whole Middle Eastern Judeo X&rsquo;tian, Muslim Jihadist cults that demand that the whole world must be united under their exclusively race-less, nationless, anti nature cult.</p>
<p>But, also understand the White racial situation looks better in Missouri than in India and good White European Christians have managed to make their faith work OK to support our race and our culture.</p>

<p>Predominately white area of the nation? I can&rsquo;t even think of many predominately white cities, or towns any longer, since multiculturalism is spreading almost everywhere these days. In fact, even when a town is mostly white, it&rsquo;s public schools are usually filled with non-whites, where whites are an extreme minority. These days, white parents are either opting for home schooling or private schooling. So I have no clue where you saw all those white cheerleaders?</p>

			<p>They are clearly not even Indian Dravidians but are both of African descent, likely by way of Jamaica, and use a lot of hair-relaxer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got nice smiles, and I feel sorry for them that they were treated this way, but the one thing the multi-cultists simply do not understand is that folks really are wired differently.  Attempting to ignore this only results in disaster.</p>
<p>Furthermore, from my associations with both subcontintal Indians and the Chinese who knew - and disliked them - they really, *really* hate it when they are grouped with African blacks.</p>
<p>This was culturally so &#8220;insensitive&#8221; that I believe the local Diversity Commissar should be prosecuted under whatever &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; statutes prevail.</p>
<p>Things should be kept fair, after all.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The caste system was/is based on varna &ldquo;color&rdquo;, each caste, group is give honor and respect and presented with a positive life to do their best given their dharma - duty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Got two things wrong there.  Varna means color in the sense of &#8220;quality&#8221; (like the quality of a person&rsquo;s profession), not in actual skin color however much you may like to think that.  And dharma meaning duty is a common error in translation,  it is best defined as ones natural law.    </p>

<p>Did you check out anonymous post at 9:02 PM on May 23 with the link to an unaltered pic?  They&rsquo;re both average and her companion looks to be a bit chunky.

even ashwarya is not punjabi. it is not just the colour of skin it is features and hair that matters. african features and hair are not considered attractive.

<p>I have seen some Indians who truly are as dark as some African Americans, although I do not agree with many Blacks who insist they look just like them except for the straight hair, or especially those blacks who insist they even are the same race. However, if you look at the Bollywood women whose names you brought up, they really aren&rsquo;t that dark at all. Certainly not by Black standards, or even darker Indian standards. Even to most whites, these women would be better described as olive complected, or slightly exotic, but definitely dark skinned. Since most of them are much lighter than some very famous African American actresses, who are mixed or are often called light skinned, like Halle Berry or Beyonce.  Below are some pictures of the women you named.http://www.freshnews.in/tag/ajay-devgan <br>

<p>Believe it or not, there are Blacks who call themselves Welsh, or Scottish, in the same way they do in other European countries where they call themselves French, Polish or what have you. But it is true, that few of them call themselves English since it conjurs up such an White Anglo Saxon image. This is also why many Blacks in the UK, snidely call Whites Little Englanders, if they like to refer to themselves as English, because they feel it excludes them.</p>

<p>There is a difference between &#8220;being attracted&#8221; and &#8220;recognizing the beauty&#8221;.  When I see a beautiful black woman, it is mostly recognizing the beauty, in a similar way as when I recognize the beauty of a latest brand new Mercedes convertible or a masterpiece painting.  We can recognize the beauty of someone, or an object, without being sexually attracted to.  I am very positive when an AmRen member says a black woman is beautiful, it is mostly recognizing the beauty.  Same here.  I do recognize the beauty of a black woman every now and then, but it is rare when I feel sexual attraction.  </p>

<p>In my opinion that was the most wisest, kindest, yet very practical post in this thread.  Being rude is a way of wasting one&rsquo;s time and energy.  </p>
<p>And what pisses me off (sorry about my language) is when a group of dark skinned men dressed in less than fine outfits say extremely rude things to white women, the white women cannot dare fight back because first she is afraid of being called a racist and second of all the authorities will not do a thing, whereas, if gentle, truly polite white men and recently East Asian men ever make oh so slightly sexual comment, the white woman will call the police, and call for the punishment immediately and the white men and/or East Asian men basically have to beg for forgiveness on their knees.  I saw this countless times.  I had to do this more than a few times.  Those AmRen members among you who have been following my posts must know that I am a Christian.  I am a part of a Christian fellowship named IVCF at my school, and there is IVCF in virtually every university in North America.  I am also responsible to take pictures at Ryerson IVCF and polish them with Adobe Photoshop and put the pictures online.  A couple of years <br>
we had a retreat once, and IVCFs around Toronto, namely University of Toronto, York University, Ryerson University, gathered and had a retreat.  There was a white woman, and I told her my name and saw that she had a ring in her ring finger and casually asked if she was engaged.  That was it.  I walked away from her.  And a few hours later a staff worker approached her gave me a warning.  A staff worker is usually someone older, sometimes a graduate student, who is in charge of leading and managing the IVCF.      </p>
<p>After the retreat, I quit coming to Ryerson IVCF.  I emailed the staff worker and stated that no matter how many times I think about it, there is nothing wrong or inappropriate about asking a woman if she was engaged, I asked how she define inappropriateness, and I explicitly described how a white woman I knew was sexually abused by a group of muslim general labour workers, and asked if asking a woman is engaged is inappropriate, then what do we call what those men have done to that woman, and I stated that there was no need for you to treat me as if I am a f*ing pervert, and I also see other men getting away with unspeakable behaviour everyday, and a couple of weeks later, Ryerson IVCF assured there will no longer be any warnings like that ever again and asked me to come back and I came back.  </p>

<p>I think you would be hard pressed to find any top Bollywood actresses as dark as the black cheerleaders. Aishwarya Rai is their top actress, and whether Punjabi or not? She is famous for her fair skin, and her light eyes. You can google images of Bollywood actresses, and almost all of them are light to tanned skinned at best. As for their models? India just introduced their own Vogue magazine. And on their first issue, they placed a blue eyed blonde European girl, front and center of the cover, standing next to other Indian models.   </p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s true the media does alter black female celebrities appearance to tone down or hide their African features.  I suspect Sherinne and her girlfriend and the company they work for are guilty of false advertising which led to this whole ruckus in the first place. If that&rsquo;s the case the clients should demand a refund or seek legal advice.  Black women should stick to marketing themselves to the only audience that would want it, black men.  White people have no appreciation for black &#8220;beauty&#8221; and aren&rsquo;t interested in seeing your masculine faces while you shake your usually large behinds to rap music.  </p>

<p>  Yes, Korean what you say is certainly true at American Universities and colleges.  I work at a university and I have seen Black students get away with some extremely rude come-ons to White women and East Asian women that would get a university professor, staff member, or White or East Asian student disciplined, if not dismissed.  There is certainly a double standard at work here among students. </p>

			<p>I feel that westernized European standard has been stressed around the world through conquering and opposition. Take slavery for example&hellip; The slave were considered inferior based on skin color and features, but they were the victim of sexual abuse, due to master&rsquo;s curiousity and lust. The wives of these slave owners, were told that lighter toned slave has rare skin conditions. Some believed it&hellip; Black people have had to bare to burden of stereotypes since they were introduced to a society separate from  their own. One of the stereotypes is being &#8220;overly sexed.&#8221; How could that be? Especially when blacks have been the victim of sexual abuse for hundreds/thousands of years. Dark and mysterious, unique and exotic will always be out casted in some form or another. </p>
<p>In my opinion, many don&rsquo;t believe that darker skin is not beautiful. They just want to create the false illusion that they believe their skin is more beautiful. How many dark skin women are in India? I feel that darker skinned women are just as beautiful as the women you seen in Bollywood films. When the people in places like India, stop trying to cater to a standard in which not many belong and start loving themselves and their diversity as a people, they will be better off. </p>

<p>And I feel you are just dishing out the same worn out excuses to blame Whitey for all the ills of the world. For starters, long before colonialism took place in India, Indian writters were waxing poetic about the beauty of Indian women with white lotus petal complexions. And since slavery in America or rape of slave women had nothing to do with India, to bring that up is pointless. Rape stats weren&rsquo;t even kept then. But you can&rsquo;t bet they didn&rsquo;t begin to compare with the Black on White rapes that go on today. White on Black rape is almost non-existant by comparison. </p>
<p>Finally, there have been studies done on Black toddlers ask to choose between a White doll and a Black one, and in most cases they will select a white one. How much media brainwashing can effect a 3 year old that profoundly? </p>
<p>I seriously believe that it is natural for most to find a classic example of Westernized beauty like this agreeable <br>
<a href="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/08_01/GraceKellyBlue_468x739.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/08_01/GraceKellyBlue_468x739.jpg</a>  </p>
<p>Than say an a tribalized African ideal of beauty like this.</p>
<p><br>
http://picasaweb.google.com/jsimpson103/FacesOfSouthernEthiopia/photo#5165745455813330930 </p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t believe the media has anything to do with it. </p>
<p>You could argue, that such an image isn&rsquo;t fair and there are African beauty queens who do not look tribal, but most have adopted Westernized beauty standards, to achieve the look. Such as with this woman, with her color treated relaxed hair, and westernized gown. Who also has been influenced by white westernized beauty standards, since the origins of her hair style and clothing are western influenced.</p>

   Women as well as men have testosterone although at lower     <br>
levels than men.<br>
   black women have higher levels than white or asian women<br>
   and therefore look more manly because they are more male.<br>
   this makes them less attractive to men who are appreciative<br>

<p></p>
<p>Dare I say, the stereotype of being over-sexed, could have something to do with the remarkably high cases of HIV and STD&rsquo;s found in the black community? Not just in the US, but all over the world. And what&rsquo;s this about blacks being victims of sexual abuse for not just hundreds, but THOUSANDS of years, no less? If you&rsquo;re accusing whites of enslaving and raping blacks that long ago? I would like to see you back that one up. Most black sexual abuse victims, are victims to their own. Rapes of both women and children are out of control in Africa. And how is dark skin, unique,  mysterious, and exotic, when there are far more dark skinned people on the planet, than light skinned ones? World wide, whites are the true minority, and perhaps that is why white skin is so highly valued in other cultures. Because it truly is rare.</p>

<p>European beauty is prized in almost every corner of the world, even in places that were never conquered by the West. Mexico, Central America, South America, Indian subcontinent, Middle East, Far East and even Africa. In most of the areas there are practically no Whites or they are a minority.  Exactly how are they imposing their standard of beauty in these countries?  In contrast, no one is adopting African standards of beauty including sharpening their teeth with metal files and putting cow poop in their hair.    </p>

			<p>In my opinion, many don&rsquo;t believe that darker skin is not beautiful. They just want to create the false illusion that they believe their skin is more beautiful. How many dark skin women are in India? I feel that darker skinned women are just as beautiful as the women you seen in Bollywood films. When the people in places like India, stop trying to cater to a standard in which not many belong and start loving themselves and their diversity as a people, they will be better off. </p>

Even if India did not favor light skin, there would still be caste system. And the caste system is not just about light skin, even though most light skinned Northern Indians tend to be among the higher castes (Brahmins) There are also darker ones. Ghandi, for example was born into a high caste despite his dark skin. Hinduism teaches it&rsquo;s followers that people are born into whatever caste they fall into through reincarnation. And believe that lower caste Indians such as the untouchables, were placed there through karma, due to some sins in their past lives, and therefore are religated to the lowest paying jobs, and the most degrading types of work. British colonials had nothing to do with this, since Hinduism was not practised or dicated by them.  So do not try and imply that whites are to blame for whatever prejudices exist in India. It&rsquo;s and absoulte falsehood.</p>
