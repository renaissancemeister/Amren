						<p>Professor Stephen Hawking, who has devoted his career to finding the origins of the universe, is to begin a new search &mdash; for Africa&rsquo;s answer to Einstein.</p>
<p>Despite suffering from motor neurone disease which has left him almost completely paralysed, Hawking, 66, has made the journey to South Africa to launch the project today.</p>
<p>Some of the world&rsquo;s leading high-tech entrepreneurs and scientists have backed the £75m plan to create Africa&rsquo;s first postgraduate centres for advanced maths and physics, after the British government declined to provide funding.</p>
<p>Hawking will be joined by eminent physicists and mathematicians including two Nobel laureates in physics, David Gross and George Smoot, and Michael Griffin, the head of Nasa. Naledi Pandor, South Africa&rsquo;s education minister, will also speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;The world of science needs Africa&rsquo;s brilliant talents and I look forward to meeting prospective young Einsteins from Africa,&#8221; said Hawking.</p>
<p>Neil Turok, founder of the project and professor of mathematical physics at Cambridge University, where he is a close colleague of Hawking, said the aim of the centres was to &#8220;unlock and nurture scientific talent&#8221; across Africa. &#8220;Apart from an African Einstein, we want to find the African Bill Gates and the Sergey Brins and Larry Pages of the future,&#8221; said Turok, referring to the founders of Microsoft and Google.</p>
<p>The 15 new centres will be modelled on the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (Aims) which was founded by Turok in Muizenberg, near Cape Town, four years ago. It has produced 160 graduates from 30 African countries, many of whom have gone on to take science doctorates. Another 53 will graduate shortly.</p>
<p>Among them is Buthaina Adam, whose mathematical skills shone out in Sudan&rsquo;s war-torn Darfur province where she grew up. With a physics degree from the University of Khartoum, she hoped to become a nuclear physicist, but shortage of money and opportunities left her career on hold until she was offered a place at Aims in 2006.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aims gave me a life, opened doors for me,&#8221; said Adam, who hopes to return to Darfur and teach after completing a PhD.</p>
<p>Turok decided to push for 15 more Aims institutes after winning the £50,000 Technology, Entertainment and Design prize in America earlier this year. He donated the money to Aims.</p>
<p>He has since been offered support potentially worth tens of millions of pounds. Google, the Gates Foundation and Sun Microsystems are among those that have expressed interest.</p>
<p>Turok and Hawking hope that Aims&rsquo;s students will help to overturn the negative stereotypes of Africa that were recently given expression by James Watson, the co-discoverer of DNA.</p>
<p>Watson lost his job as director of the Cold Spring Harbor laboratories in America after suggesting that Africans were less intelligent than Europeans. A subsequent analysis of his own DNA showed that he had part-African ancestry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Watson&rsquo;s views were simply ridiculous,&#8221; said Turok. &#8220;The quality of students we are seeing at Aims is extremely high. What they need is an opportunity to learn.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hawking&rsquo;s keynote lecture this afternoon is expected to be the highpoint of the ceremonies in Cape Town. When he gave a talk at the Caltech campus in Pasadena in the United States, he was wheeled out of the auditorium to a standing ovation and took a victory lap in his wheel-chair while the crowd shouted: &#8220;We love you, Stephen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hawking is expected to repeat his call for a global effort to enable humanity to colonise space, starting with the moon and then Mars. Turok&rsquo;s hopes are more down to earth: he wants to persuade the British government to rethink its refusal to fund the Aims project.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Department for International Development spends £1.5 billion of taxpayers&rsquo; money on aid to Africa every year but there is precious little to show for it. The people who will make Africa rich are the brightest people because they will generate wealth,&#8221; Turok said.</p>
<p>Andrew Mitchell, shadow development secretary, was equally critical: &#8220;There is much more to Africa than poverty and starvation. This is an extremely important initiative and I&rsquo;m going to see how the next Conservative government could support it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The international development department said it preferred to focus on projects to fight poverty.<br>

<p>Watson had part African ancestry? That&rsquo;s hard to believe. But, even if he was 1% black that does not make him black. Not in my book.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;ll perfect the origins of the Big Bang and the Unified Particle Theory before he finds Africa&rsquo;s answer to Einstein.  Such a genius cannot seem to accept the possibility that some of the genetic science he might have heard about in passing might apply to human racial groupings.  Believing that the Universe was created in a week takes more faith than believing in racial equality.</p>

<p>This further confirms that NASA is nothing more than white collar welfare for blacks. If the shuttle occasionally crashes, they&rsquo;ll look into it, but diversity training and learning to love the blacks they hire is their main goal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure NASA will be holding positions open for these geniuses until they get their PHD&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>No doubt the next Werner Von Braun is working on his fusion powered rocket in some grass hut.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s the last straw. Our race is doomed. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just hand our civilization over the Afrocentrists right now. </p>
<p>Plato, Caesar, Dante, Michelangelo, Da Vinci, Galileo, Shakespeare, Newton, Mozart, Beethoven and Darwin are nothing when compared to Miles Davis and Nelson Mandela.</p>
<p>The Afrocentrists and extreme Multiculturalist are right (for the wrong reasons of course). </p>
<p>A race of people, let alone its &#8220;best and brightest,&#8221; who would even entertain the possibilty of racial equality in this day and age is NOT fit for survival.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t care if Hawking and his idiot pals are just pretending to believe in equality to give Africans hope.</p>

<p>There is an old belief that the very booksmart/brainy types have very little common sense. It goes without saying that Hawking is the ultimate brainiac, so therefore he must have the least amount of common sense of anybody on the planet according to this belief. I believe that quote backs up my claim.</p>

			<p>Out of the whole population of Africa, there are undoubtedly a few dozen who qualify for an advanced education in the sciences. I tend to do pretty well on multiple guess tests myself, even for a white boy, but I&rsquo;m unable to comprehend how educating a few dozen very bright Africans will dispel the negative stereotypes that run-of-the-mill Africans work so hard to create.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also puzzled as to why a woman from Darfur wants to study nuclear physics. It just doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a useful skill in a place where most boys attend the University Of Kalashnikov. You don&rsquo;t suppose that her real intention is to bug out to a first world country at her earliest opportunity, do you? Yeah, I know I&rsquo;m a filthy racist for even thinking such a thing.</p>

<p>Stereotypes always have some element of truth.I think Mr. Turok is nothing but a hustler out to defraud the British taxpayer of a few billion dollars a year.Its the same with all of these NGOs out to eliminate poverty in the third world.I bet the next project Mr. Turok will begin is to disprove the ridiculous assertion by James Watson that if you crossbreed a swine with an eagle you will not create a flying pig.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m convinced we&rsquo;re going to have to plod through every theory yet unimagined until all theories are exhausted and we&rsquo;re left with the only answer that was there all along: race is real.</p>
<p>I welcome this effort. Only I know that when their efforts fail, what we will be left with is not the truth, but yet another theory to explain why their efforts failed.</p>
<p>Do-gooders are a cornucopia of theories and excuses.<br>

<p>You will, quite possible, find a few at the very, very, narrow upper end of the black intelligence distribution curve, but I must say this:</p>
<p>With all your exalted intelligence, YOU ARE LIVING IN A COMIC-BOOK WORLD. Any person who knows reality will tell you that you will have more luck in finding Bigfoot or Nessie!</p>
<p>Turok and Andar  &mdash;  you must find your way back to your real world!     </p>

			<p>From what I have gathered about Steven Hawking and I really have not spent much time gathering much about him I would describe him as a Lyndon Larouchite/scientologist.  Sort of a global utopianist or survivalist.  He would seem to have many beliefs in line with Lyndon Larouche and Scientology.  The elimination of national borders, a central authority, first world resources pouring into the third world equalizing the world (aka global communism), you get the picture. Sort of a Star Trek world visionary. Then of course space travel and exploration which I personally find fascinating. </p>

			<p>After scouring 30 countries, they come up with 160 graduates.  That&rsquo;s hardly enough to refute Dr Watson&rsquo;s views.  Nobody said that there are no intelligent Africans, just that there are very few of them, not enough to sustain an economy and infrastructure equal to England&rsquo;s in 1800, certainly not enough to compete with any White nation today.  </p>

			<p>As any serious scientist in the field of intelligence studies will tell you people of all races can be found all along the distribution of intellectual ability.  What is different is the mean and the distribution of intelligence amongst the races.  The average IQ of Blacks in America is 85 wich is one standard deviation below the average of 100.  This fact does not mean that there are no high IQ blacks, just that there will be fewer of them in relation to Whites and people of East Asian decent.  The Black IQ distribution that has a mean that is one standard deviation below the mean results in only 1 in 6 Blacks having an IQ above 100.</p>
<p>IQ scores for Africans have typically been lower than that of American Blacks.  This fact will make it difficult for any group looking for African Einsteins to find a large number of individuals with high IQ&rsquo;s.  The money this group is spending would probably be better allocated where it could do more good such as providing infrastructure.  It is difficult to advance economically without good infrastructure (roads, bridges, sewage, etc.).  Economic development could then lead to an environment where a high IQ was better rewarded.</p>

			<p>One question: why is it necessary for whites to seek out and nurture African &#8220;genius&#8221; if, after all these thousands of years, it hasn&rsquo;t come to light of its own accord? Especially since genius has sprung naturally from European countries? Also, isn&rsquo;t it kind of racist for whites to presume that they have to save Africans from themselves?</p>
<p><i>Watson lost his job as director of the Cold Spring Harbor laboratories in America after suggesting that Africans were less intelligent than Europeans. A subsequent analysis of his own DNA showed that he had part-African ancestry.</i></p>
<p>What has that got to do with anything? If anything, that should make him more qualified to speak on the subject. It would if he were identified as black. And isn&rsquo;t it funny that this and other writers see nothing sinister in the fact that someone was fired simply for speaking his conscious?</p>

<p>That is a lie.  Watson stated that, on average, whites have higher IQ scores.  That does not equate to saying all whites are smarter than all blacks.  This is how the MSM likes to twist things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry Mr. Hawking, finding a few brilliant blacks is not going to overturn the numerous studies showing blacks to have lower mean IQ&rsquo;s than whites.</p>

			<p>How come the original Einstein and Gates didn&rsquo;t need to be &#8220;found&#8221;?<br>
What a waste of 150 million dollars.  The USA has probably thrown a trillion dollars at blacks, and hasn&rsquo;t managed to civilize them.  Out of the 800 million black africans there are probably a thousand or so with PhD level intelligence.

You can predict the litany of excuses that will be offered to explain why there isn&rsquo;t a gusher of Einsteins coming out of this institution:</p>
<p>  &mdash;   We don&rsquo;t have enough funding.<br>
  &mdash;   We know they&rsquo;re out there, but we don&rsquo;t have the resources to go out and find them.<br>
  &mdash;   Young talent in Africa is not provided with the right opportunities at the elementary school level.<br>
  &mdash;   Malnutrition is cutting off their education before it can even start.<br>
  &mdash;   Prejudice against girls is preventing girls from pursuing careers in math and science.<br>
  &mdash;   The elementary school teachers aren&rsquo;t getting the right training.<br>
  &mdash;   Wars and disease are stopping them from coming forward.<br>
  &mdash;   We haven&rsquo;t been able to get the word out to the right people.</p>
<p>You can add to the list. Or, just wait for the stories to appear in about two or three years.<br>

			<p>People can do whatever they want with their own money. I hope it helps the small percentage of smarter africans. Everyone who are able and willing to work hard should be given some assistance. I still doubt we are going to get an &#8216;african Einstein etc&hellip;&rsquo; though.</p>

<p>Well, he did so well on finding the origins of the universe it&rsquo;s no wonder he wants to embark on a more difficult project.  I mean his discovery IS in the textbooks, isnt it?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t anybody tell him that even if he did find such a black, that wouldn&rsquo;t change the fact that blacks are the least intelligent human species on the planet, as a group.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t be surprised if he announces next year he&rsquo;s found bigfoot.  I have no doubt the old boy is in the initial stages of dementia.  </p>

   As someone above said, why does the African Einstein need to be &#8220;found&#8221;? If one existed, wouldn&rsquo;t he have emerged on his own already? If Africa where capable of producing such people, Africans wouldn&rsquo;t need whites to come and help them in the first place. This is a fool&rsquo;s errand. Perhaps Mr. Hawking can team up with Don Quixote for his next quest. </p>

			<p>Shame on you all.  Having lived in South Africa for 24 years, there must be some potential or actual geniuses left who have not been driven out by the affirmative actions of the new Marxist government.  Many are still getting out as they are refused jobs or earned promotion because of the colour of their skins.   (Over 20% of the white population has left SA.)</p>
<p>So the whites will probably not get a look-in as the South African government will make sure that only blacks can apply or are introduced.  Let us hope that Prof. Hawking reports the truth and is not hoodwinked easily.</p>

			<p>Brilliant!  After realizing that it is impossible to actually visit a black hole in outer space, Hawking discovered the &#8220;African black hole&#8221; into which billions and billions of dollars have been sunk.  The African black hole is so dense that not even light can escape, much less the money that is thrown into it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that even a man as intelligent as Hawking can buy into the leftist ideology which states the following:</p>
<p>&#8220;We must ignore the concept of overlapping bell curves when it comes to race.  It is incumbent upon us to reduce the law of averages to absolutes (ie. all blacks are stupid and all whites are smart) for, by doing so, we set up a straw man.&#8221; The Leftist Bible pg. 304</p>

white professors,  2000 of the 3000 students wanted to join the study. As for the average intellectual abilities, I despair. After having carefully trained a maid to set the dinner table for six, that is where to put all the knives, forks, spoons, various kind of plates and glasses, she managed to do the job quite well after a week or so. The experiment came to nought when we rearranged the dining room furniture. the table had been turned 90 degrees, we arrived home to find two place settings on each of the<br>
ends and one each in the middle of the long side.</p>

			<p>Apart from suffering from motor neurone disease, Hawkings also appears to be having his judgment and common sense severely impaired. He might just want to compare notes with Oprah Wimfrey, who also started a school in Africa not too long ago.</p>
<p>As utterly ridiculous and Quiotic a quest this is, I am shocked a man of Hawking&rsquo;s stature would waste time, much less money on something this improbable.</p>
<p>I agree wholeheartedly with the poster who suggested that if an African Einstein existed, he&rsquo;d have alread surfaced. It might be pointed out in closing that Whites AND Blacks started on a level playing field at the end of the Last Ice Age, 50 to 60 thousand years ago.</p>
<p>Does it not occur to Hawking, that all the learning, the sciences and incredible amount of knowledge the human race acquired since the Ice Age&hellip; NONE of it was by Black thinkers. That Africa NEVER produced an Archimedes, a Pythagoras, an Aristotle, a Galileo, an Einstein, an Isaac Newton, or a William Herschel. That it is highly unlikely the Blacks EVER will.</p>
<p>Blacks have had a half-century or more since the end of Colonialism and White Rule to advance themselves. The picture of today&rsquo;s Africa speaks for itself&hellip; Crime, Disease, Abysmall Poverty and the ignorance that leads Africans into murdering each other over the most simple reasons.</p>
<p>I am sorry, but I have lost all respect for Stephen Hawking. He has clearly lost his mind.</p>

			<p>Exactly what drugs is Hawkins on?  Just because he does well at physics does not imply anything about his talent for the absurd, i.e. finding an Einstein in black Africa.<br>
The chances are very remote, indeed, what with a mean IQ of 70.  In fact the history of the world and its cultures is a refutation to the entire project of Hawkins and his friends.  In ten thousand years black Africa has produced nothing of worth  &mdash;  -that is quite a record and is completely consistent with their mean IQ.</p>

			<p>Remarkable that Stephen Hawkings feels it necessary to find examples of black genius on the Dark Continent, a quality that has somehow eluded discovery and exploitation for tens of thousands of years.  One would have thought that such an expedition would prove much more productive in East or Central Asia or in the former Soviet satellite countries.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not quite clear to me whether Hawkings is seeking to tap a mother lode of human genius for the benefit of all mankind or whether he&rsquo;s trying to fire up a new affirmative action program at the ultimate source of all other such programs.</p>

			<p>Someone should have reminded the esteemed Stephen Hawking that the most noteworthy developments coming out of Africa since throwing off their &#8220;colonial oppressors&#8221; included hacking the arms off children and adults for the crime of belonging to another tribe. Or implementing CANNIBALISM as a means of terrorism during tribal wars and feuds. Also murdering young children to use their organs in voodoo and black magic rituals. Then there&rsquo;s also that charming African custom of tying the victim, then placing a gasoline soaked tire around his neck and lighting it.</p>

			<p>After scouring the continent, he may well find a few hundred bright students. After all, the stats says he has to. Will he find another Einstein? Highly unlikely. And since when does one actually look for an Einstein? I mean, wouldn&rsquo;t they appear of their own accord with some lofty ideas that few people can understand. One poster pointed out that many of the &#8220;Africans&#8221; may turn out to be White. That reminds me of a headline I saw in the paper a few years ago, titled (in rather large print) &#8220;First African in Space&#8221;. The photo accompanying the article was of a White guy. For a few seconds I wondered what that picture was doing within the border of the article. Within moments, of course, I learned the &#8220;African&#8221; was Mark Shuttleworth, a White South African who is as white as you can get (and the funder and developer of Ubuntu, one of the most popular Linux distributions)</p>

			<p>Well, I must say this is the best laugh I have had all week!</p>
<p>Here we go, with the one sentence that really takes the cake:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The world of science needs Africa&rsquo;s brilliant talents and I look forward to meeting prospective young Einsteins from Africa,&rsquo; said Hawking&rdquo; </p>
<p>Keep looking into this black hole Comrade Hawking, you might just see the origins of the universe and Karl Marx too?</p>
<p>The British government was quite correct not to waste it&rsquo;s money on this boondoggle of blackness; also, Comrade Hawking has clearly begun to have his mind degrade, to the point where it will soon resemble his withered and worthless body. Normally, I am reluctant to make such insensitive remarks about the handicapped, but not here. I must say, not in the least at all here, either; Comrade Hawking has clearly made the choice to join the irrational Multi Cult, and that cannot be ignored. </p>
<p>Moreover, this statement below:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hawking is expected to repeat his call for a global effort to enable humanity to colonise space, starting with the moon and then Mars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Is simply put, even more ludicrous then the rest of this stupid and abhorrently naive article. Comrade Hawking&rsquo;s call for this effort on &ldquo;humanity&rsquo;s&rdquo; part, simply boils down to allowing the Third World parasites access to feeding off of the West&rsquo;s (particularly the USA&rsquo;s) future accomplishments in space, as they do here on Earth in the present. Come on folks, let&rsquo;s face it, who will colonize Mars and the Moon, should this ever happen?</p>
<p>India?</p>
<p>China?</p>
<p>Zimbabwe?</p>
<p>Mexico?</p>
<p>Or would it be the USA?</p>
<p>Yes, perhaps: Russia, Japan, or Europe, might give us a run for our money; or even cooperate with us in such an endeavor, but would they ever beat us to the punch? Think about it, and then ask yourself what these Western countries might not be able to offer, that Angola or Cuba will?</p>
<p>The only thing I can think of for these latter two (or China, India, and Zimbabwe too) is that &ldquo;magic&rdquo; substance called diversity. We landed on the Moon without it (conspicuously so) and I would believe that future colonization projects to there or Mars, would be possible without it as well. </p>
<p>In fact, given the state of affairs in Detroit or LA at present, I should say in spite of it?</p>
<p>In ending here, I will state the obvious. This being, that in an effort to dispel all thought on Dr. James Watson&rsquo;s prescient observations about the noble African, £75 million will be wasted. No African Albert Einstein or Bill Gates will be found, since they do not exist; if they did, the Western &ldquo;business&rdquo; fools would not be employing Comrade Hawking and £75 million to find them.</p>
<p>We would be employing him and the money, to compete with them!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!</p>

			<p>Looking for an Einstein-level genius in deepest, darkest Africa is, to paraphrase quantum physics pioneer Edwin Schroedinger, like a blind man in a dark room searching for a black cat that isn&rsquo;t there.<br>
Given the average African intelligence level of IQ 70, with IQ 54 prevalent (see work by Richard Lynn) in some parts of the Congo Basin, the probability of a true African genius IQ of 160 or above being discovered would be a 6- or 7-sigma event - an event so improbable that normal Gaussiam statistics become unreliable, an event on the order of one out of ten- to one hundred million.<br>
Good luck, Steven!</p>

			<p>Lonely Jew your comment on looking for an Einstein is so timely. There is an article in Men&rsquo;s Journal magazine about a physicist who has introduced a grand unifying theory not based on strings. It is based on a 248 dimensional object mathematicians call E8. His name is Garrett Lisi and he is a ski/surf bum who got his PHD in theoretical physics awhile back but never did academia or the work/slave route. Kinda like Einstein doing his best work just hanging around the empty patent office.</p>
<p>Some physicists think he is deluded some are warming to it. Time will tell. Even he admits, however, that it may not be provable.<br>

People with superior mental abilities will stand out from whatever crowd they happen to be in.  Transport Einstein back 10,000 years, and you&rsquo;d find him making the best bows and arrows anyone had ever seen.

			<p>Hopefully Stephen Hawking will also delve into that incredible history of Black Africa&hellip; predating the onset of the slave trade. After all, we are &#8216;informed&rsquo; Africa was the &#8216;cradle of civilization.&rsquo; That magnificent universities and centers of higher education were found all over Ethiopia and Zimbabwe. That early Black Africans discovered, learned, invented and found out everything and anything our modern European civilization really rests on. Bearing in mind of course, those noble Africans were simply far too modest to actually make claims for amassing the knowledge, learning and technology we enjoy today.</p>

			<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;ll just find someone with something like 135 IQ,&#8221;</p>
<p>Lettuce take a look.  135 minus 67 (median IQ of sub-Sahara Afreeka) = 68 IQ points difference.  </p>
<p>Assuming 15 points for one SD, 68/15 = 4.53 SD&rsquo;s, or approximately one of 300,000.</p>
<p>Assuming 12 points for one SD, 68/12 = 5.67 SD&rsquo;s. or approximately one 0f 143,000,000</p>
<p>(SD means standard deviation)</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t hold your breath waiting to find one.</p>

			<p>This is interesting, because I am 3.5 standard deviation points above the US norm of 100, as tested by the feds.  Hawking is looking for 4.5 standard deviation points.  How would one test for that in the chaos in Africa?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why the  IQ estimates for  Africa  are  just wrong.  After  all, there many more  than 6 living Africans  with  doctorates in  Physics and  Mathematics. Google &#8220;Mathematicians of the African Diaspora&#8221; for  just a small  self-reporting sample of Africans  just in the  area of mathematics.</p>

			<p>Mordechai: Einstein played the violin.  I seriously doubt that he was so fumble-fingered that he couldn&rsquo;t tie his shoes.  More generally, there is a peculiar anomaly in Jewish mental abilities.  While Ashkenazi Jews have an average IQ of 115, doing well on both math and verbal sections, they are relatively deficient in the quality known as spacial relations, exactly the thing needed for tying shoes.  As for the manual skills of scientists in general, they are superior, though nowadays they are not likely to be trained in any practical art.  Back in the early part of the last century, British scientists were taught to build their own scientific apparatus. For example, the scientists who developed and improved radar throughout WW2 created their own machines from scratch.  <br>
     I still maintain, a person of superior mental ability will tend to seek an outlet that employs their mind fully, and that if you wish to find such people in primitive societies, look for the well-built canoe or the most beautiful pottery.  Perhaps in Africa, the most finely honed machete.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Exactly what drugs is Hawkins on? &hellip;. finding an Einstein in black Africa. The chances are very remote, indeed, what with a mean IQ of 70.  <br>
In fact, the history of the world and its cultures is a refutation to the entire project. In ten thousand years black Africa has produced nothing of worth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Remarkable that Hawkings feels it necessary to find examples of black genius on the Dark Continent, a quality that has somehow eluded discovery and exploitation for tens of thousands of years.&#8221;<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -<br>
And why, anyway, does he find it necessary to <i>go looking for  </i>genius specifically in Africa?   Is that  kind of selectivity not being &#8220;racist&#8221; in itself?   It&rsquo;s like special blacks-only beauty contests where they don&rsquo;t have to compete with others.  If he were truly color-blind, wouldn&rsquo;t it be sufficient to find talent wherever it exists?</p>
<p>They are going to be combing the savannahs and jungles of Africa in search of a black genius, squandering a fortune on this fool&rsquo;s errand, while depriving a potential Newton or daVinci right at home, who is not of the right color.</p>
<p>Also, the fact that he has to mount a <i>deliberate </i> search for genius, focused <i>exclusively  </i>on black Africa, is a tacit admission  that Africa has spectacularly failed to produce any without this special coaxing.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t discredit Hawking yet.  Racial equality is a pretty acceptable theory nowadays (though not in this community obviously).  And theories need to be tested.  Seems to be what these guys are doing.  Let&rsquo;s just follow the outcome.</p>

			<p><i>&ldquo;Some of the world&rsquo;s leading high-tech entrepreneurs and scientists have backed the £75m plan to create Africa&rsquo;s first postgraduate centres for advanced maths and physics, after the British government declined to provide funding.&rdquo; </i></p>

			<p>Here is a calculator for Z scores:</p>
<p>https://www.danielsoper.com/statcalc/calc02.aspx </p>
<p>For example, enter 3.5.  The answer is .9997673 (99.98% have lower IQ&rsquo;s).  Subtract this from from one, to the result .0002327.  Take the reciprocal (1/X on the pocket calc) or divide into one.  1/.0002327 equals one of 4297.</p>
<p>So, a group of 430,000 (assume median IQ = 100) would have 100 members with IQ&rsquo;s 152 or higher.</p>

			<p>More to say.  From the White median IQ of 100, 135 is 2.33 SD&rsquo;s away.  This is one of fifty (traditional Mensa cutoff- upper two percent).</p>
<p>One of fifty (White) vs. one of three-hundred thousand (black African):</p>
<p>There are SIX-THOUSAND times more Whites with IQ&rsquo;s &gt;= 135 than there are africans with IQ&rsquo;s &gt;= 135.  (Rates per million, not absolute numbers).</p>
<p>And this assumes the african bell curve is as wide as the White (SD = 15)&hellip;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Mordechai: The talent of Africa is seen everywhere &mdash; they are surviving and reproducing; we are not.&#8221;</p>
<p>Interesting observation, Mordechai. According to nature, the only measure of the superiority of a species, is its ability to reproduce itself and increase its numbers. Using that measure, rats and mice are, by nature&rsquo;s biological standard, vastly superior to tigers. The number of rats and mice is booming, while tigers are endangered.</p>
<p>In a recent column, Pat Buchanan revealed the results of a recent study, that showed that the black population will increase by 300 percent by 2070. On the other hand, the white population is projected to decline by a horrifying 200 million people by that time, due to failure to produce babies.</p>
<p>In the early 1900s, whites were nearly 40 percent of the world&rsquo;s population. In 2070, whites will be less than 10 percent of the world&rsquo;s people. With massive third world immigration, whites may not even have majorities in their own countries.</p>
<p>Civilizations have come and gone over the millennia, but the white race has survived. The health of a race is always more important than material things, which soon crumble into dust. If whites cannot arrest the decline of their numbers in the coming decades, then, by nature&rsquo;s standard, they will have proven themselves less fit. And the blacks, mestizos and other races, will have the last laugh.  </p>

<p>No, clearly our efforts to hold these geniuses back in our own country by making them sit through curricula that&rsquo;s below their intellectual level is the explanation for their disruptive classroom behavior here.</p>
<p>Besides, I&rsquo;m curious to see how &#8220;advanced math and physics&#8221; fares as an oral tradition.</p>

<p>But no, a quest even more challenging, more filled with the romance of the impossible, will focus our energies and attention: finding &#8220;an African Einstein&#8221;!</p>
<p>Where will the search for this lost treasure begin  &mdash;  the Congo? Sudan? Cameroon? This quest will make Dr. Livingstone&rsquo;s adventures pale.</p>

			<p>Occam continues to promote &#8220;mathematicians of the African diaspora&#8221; even though the thoroughly unimportant quality of their work has been exhaustively pointed out to him on these boards by a university mathematician. What on earth is the point of maintaining that black Africa is a treasure house of talent in mathematics and science?</p>
<p>Belle Kerve&rsquo;s IQ figures for Africa are accurate and have been established by the same mathematics Occam wants to believe Africans master to the same level and extent as everyone else. </p>

Among all the excellent comments above, those of Mordechai and Von Wagner, which took a different perspective, stood out.  </p>
<p>We must realize that the blacks and browns are having the last laugh, and having it at our expense. We are actually subsidizing their birth booms with our aid, our medicines, all our social programs, and ultimately by inviting them into our countries to replace us (while even suppressing and punishing any complaints from the original inhabitants). </p>
<p>Yes, truly &#8220;demography is destiny&#8221;, and &#8220;the fertile shall inherit the earth&#8221; &hellip; while those who have lost the will to survive, or defend their territory, will become extinct.</p>
<p>Even insects will fiercely defend their territory. I can&rsquo;t think of ANY examples in nature where a species of creature invites in another to replace it. Something extremely strange is going on here.</p>
