						<p>When you&rsquo;re the only person from your high school to qualify for the state meet, chances are you&rsquo;re not exactly gunning for the title. But over two days last weekend, Bonnie Richardson, a junior at Rochelle High School in Rochelle, Texas, jumped, ran, and, er, discus-ed her way to the Texas 1A high school team track title &mdash; all by her lonesome.</p>
<p>Bonnie, whose high school doesn&rsquo;t even have a proper track, braved two days of 90-plus-degree Texas heat to singlehandedly beat teams from all over the state. Officials told reporters that, as far as they knew, this was the first time a single athlete had won a girls&rsquo; team title. (The last time it happened for the boys was way back in the 70&rsquo;s.)</p>

			<p>Of course, whites in track tend to be better at track events that are combinations of multiple events, such as decathlon.  If she were only a sprinter, and only competed in sprinting, she probably wouldn&rsquo;t have won.  If she were purely discus, she probably would have won.  But she&rsquo;s a self-selecting sample of track athletes that compete in multiple events, so she has to stagger herself to compete well in many events.</p>

			<p>That&rsquo;s one tough gal! Excellent job Bonnie!  White females are getting more and more physicaly advanced every year.  We just had this discussion this morning at the coffee shop. One does not have to look long or hard to see white women with better physiques than white young men or black men.  Their shoulders, arms and legs are much more muscular than many of their male counter parts. Their self discipline and maturity is much better than many of their male counter parts. While the white male has been beat down by years of the dumbing down and being made to feel guilty for every problem there is on the planet, the white women has excelled and progressed.  That is the best hope for the white race right now and maybe some day the white males will notice and match their female counterparts and take their place on the planet as they once held.  Just search sports pages on the WEB, and you will find young white women winning against males in wrestling, boxing and many other sports that used to be male only.  The white gal is coming of age and this young woman is just another example!  Way to go!</p>

			<p>I haved worked in Austin, as a 5-star hotel valet, during the Texas Relays.  There is hardly a White face to be seen, so this story is a great one.  Imagine all those future ball players and aspiring rap artists sent home with the knowledge that they were beat by one(1) White girl.</p>
<p>Congratulations are in order here.</p>

			<p>Setting aside race. Is that a Bonnie or a Bob? There&rsquo;s some HGH at play here.</p>

			<p>This girl is definitely an outstanding all-round athlete and has a good future in the heptathlon.  She is unique in that she is quite good at running, jumping, and throwing, whereas most of the multi-event athletes struggle in the throwing events, or, if good at throwing, are relatively weaker in the running and jumping events.  This girl is a uniquely talented athlete.</p>
<p>But, Divison 1A is the smallest schools division in Texas and there are many who can run faster, jump farther, and throw farther in the bigger school divisions.  At a larger school she would have had to specialize more to be competitive at the state championship level.</p>

			<p>If you thought the average white male Amren poster was going to unabashedly admire/support this white female, you were wrong!</p>
<p>Witness comments above (&#8220;Bonnie or Bob?&#8221;).  Many of your male posters have a compulsion to tear the white female down or at the least downplay her achievements.  Some of you feel a need to strike back or are just too immature   &mdash;   in the real sense of the word   &mdash;   to see that you&rsquo;re hurting your cause.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not male-bashing, Amren.  Strong, intelligent women are part of the cultural success story and particularly the American story.  But many of your men on here just won&rsquo;t acknowledge it.  Who would be your female counterpart in a &#8220;white nation&#8221; if you don&rsquo;t support your women?  </p>
<p>Strong, healthy, attractive girl.  What type of female would be better to people a nation and raise your children (according to your nationalistic philosophy?)</p>

			<p>If this girl were black, her story would have been all over the MSM outlets. Don&rsquo;t deny it either. She was for the most part ignored by Dyestat, Track and Field News and the rest of the main players in track and field reporting. However, true to form, blacks and other non-whites who have done less have received more praise and attention all year. </p>

			<p>Wonderful.  <br>
The liberal progressive left tries to make whites a third class, but Bonnie shut them down.</p>
<p>The Minor Stream Media will be at a loss if they report on this wonderful accomplishment.</p>
<p>Good luck in all you do in the future, Bonnie.  God Bless YOu.  </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m against the Bonnie-hope story here. Here&rsquo;s why. I fear that building up too much faith in &#8216;Bonnie&rsquo; is just setting-her-up for a fall. Perhaps as a means for professional women&rsquo;s sport to suck money and adoration out of all whites girls at some later date. Perhaps turning them into a life-time consumer of this inane cult-of-the-sports-champion. Then they might get fat watching sports on the couch (Ok, little joke their). Personally, I think serious sporting competitions should be segregated by race. In my opinion anyone who thinks otherwise is not trying to protect white citizens at all. The same could be said for protecting whites in the larger world, as well. My simple, original comment that serious sports competition should be segregated was &#8216;censored&rsquo; and didn&rsquo;t make it to print here. But if you must set-straight an angry and immature WN man, why not have it be me?    </p>

			<p>I thought that this was one place where the forced-to-be-nice PC speech was actively discouraged, and people could say plainly what they could see with their own two eyes.</p>
<p>Congratulations on Bonnie&rsquo;s success, but it is clear from her photo what genetic advantage she possessed to assist her in beating the rest of the girls.  From her facial and body type you can see that she has elevated levels of testosterone compared to the average woman which give her greater power and stamina than the rest of the field.  Women with these traits are beginning more and more to dominate women&rsquo;s sports at the top levels as their extra muscle gives them a massive advantage.</p>
<p>That is the bare naked truth.  It may seem unpleasant to the posters above but what I have said is a hard fact that can be verified with an endocrine test.</p>
