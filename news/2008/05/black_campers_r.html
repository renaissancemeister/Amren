						<p>The throngs filling campgrounds across America this weekend will include hardy outdoors types and those who prefer creature comforts, but they&rsquo;ll have at least one important thing in common: Nearly all of them are white.</p>
<p>A small but committed group of campers is trying to change that by growing a generation of black campers, one person at a time.</p>
<p>The National African-American RVers Association is composed almost exclusively of black people who camp, although it includes a few whites and Hispanics. The group doesn&rsquo;t have much money to buy ads or solicit new members.</p>
<p>Instead, it always holds its major national gathering in July when schools are out so children and grandchildren can come along.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Getting more blacks into the woods would mean breaking decades of stereotypes and overcoming a long-standing leeriness that members say many have about camping. Bad things happen to black people in the woods, the story goes, and they can&rsquo;t afford recreational vehicles.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lemuel Horton, Southern regional director for the black campers&rsquo; group, said that for years many blacks were simply afraid to camp.</p>
<p>&#8220;They felt like a black person out by yourself just wasn&rsquo;t personally safe,&#8221; said Horton, of Decatur, Ga. &#8220;But traveling all over the United States and Canada since the 1970s, I&rsquo;ve had no problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joseph [Lawrence Joseph, a black camper] said the idea of camping creates an uneasiness among some blacks that&rsquo;s strong enough to prevent many from ever venturing into the outdoors, yet difficult to explain.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s just a feeling that it&rsquo;s not somewhere they ought to be,&#8221; said Joseph.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>States including Washington and California have launched programs to get minorities interested in outdoors recreation including camping, and so has the National Park Service.</p>
<p>Longtime park ranger Shelton Johnson, who is black, said he began telling the story of black buffalo soldiers at Yosemite National Park in California partly to lure more black visitors. Johnson has seen more minority visitors in recent years, but there&rsquo;s still not many.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Founded by a small group of enthusiasts 16 years ago, the National African-American RVers Association has about 3,000 member families nationwide. Most are in the warm-weather South, and hundreds of rigs show up at regional gatherings called rallies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a feeling that it&rsquo;s not somewhere they ought to be,&rdquo; said Joseph&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..I get the feeling that the reason blacks fear going into the woods has to do with evolution.They have not evolved that much beyond being a prey animal for large carnivores. A good point would be the story of how blacks seem to be unable to deal with man eating lions as in the story of the Ghost and The Darkness.It took a white hunter to kill these maneaters.That is the reason large cats have become extinct in europe yet still exist in the rest of the old world until recently.So blacks still retain the instinct that they might be eaten by large carnivores.</p>

					<p>Blacks are right to be afraid to go camping. It&rsquo;s not so much that anything would happen to them out in the woods but there isn&rsquo;t going to be anything there when they get home. The other brothers watch when a black leaves home. </p>

					<p>R-Vers arn&rsquo;t really campers.  They drive motel rooms on wheels.</p>
<p>Our camping gear fills the trunk of my 1995 Saturn SL-2, and that includes the cooler for meat, cheese and cider.</p>
<p>One tent, two sleeping bags, pads, inflatable pillows, and spare jackets in tied-off plastic bags in a duffel bag.  </p>
<p>Cooking gear, spare toilet paper in a tied-off plastic bag, a lantern, 50-50 lantern/citronella oil, <span class="caps">MRE</span>s, a machete, two tarps, rope, a &#8220;Letherman&#8221; multi-tool, spices, instant coffee, strike-anywhere matches in a tied-off plastic bag, clean, dry underwear and socks in tied-off plastic bags, and a hatchet, all in a plastic box.</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;ve been camping when it rained, so some dry clothes and dry toilet paper are very nice!</p>

					<p>I noticed long ago that you rarely see Blacks at campsites. They all like to think of themselves as urban types by nature. And their favorite form of an insult towards a white person is to call them backwoods. All this is too ironic considering how undeveloped most of the continent of Africa remains to this day. All other modern buildings and structures are mostly due to Whites or Arabs and other non-Blacks. This could be why so many Afrocentric minded blacks spend so much time trying to place themselves and history outside of the continent of Africa, except for Egypt. Those in the west hate anything rural or back to nature. </p>

					<p>Blacks are unable to survive in any climate that hasn&rsquo;t been conquered and tamed for them by whites.  That&rsquo;s why they never ventured outside the lush paradise of Africa before whites came.  And it&rsquo;s the source of the unease.  They know, deep down inside, that if something happened&hellip;.for example, they got lost in the woods&hellip;.they would not be able to figure out how to survive the ordeal.</p>
<p>If the white man disappeared from the globe tomorrow, the black man would disappear the week afterward.</p>

					<p>Even Kirby Puckett was afraid of the woods.  There is a story that he was at a campfire with a (white) friend and asked what that rustle in the brush was.  The friend said, &#8220;probably a bear,&#8221; and Kirby was back at the cabin in the time it would take him to field a fly ball.</p>

					<p>&#8220;Bad things happen to black people in the woods, the story goes, and they can&rsquo;t afford recreational vehicles.&#8221;</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t afford <span class="caps">RV&rsquo;</span>s?  Wasn&rsquo;t it just the other day it was claimed that 22% of blacks earn over $100,000 per household?  That means there must be another 30 or 40% who earn over $35,000, which certainly is as much as a good percentage of white outdoorsmen earn, and more than a large number of blue collar whites earn who love mother nature.</p>
<p>And, what is this &#8220;Bad things happen to blacks in the woods?&#8221;  More whinings of victimization?  Like the nooses that meant nothing to 99% of them until some liberal dork and Jesse and Al told them it did?</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is this:  Blacks would rather be in a controlled, close environment, where they&rsquo;re around other members of the group, as in Africa where they lived for thousands and thousand of years in a tribal environment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same reason they form gangs so easily.  It&rsquo;s just a continuation of their tribal existence.  Beating whites in mob attacks is further evidence of tribal societies.</p>
<p>If blacks have any bad feelings about rural environments it&rsquo;s because black criminals have always been easily caught in the woods after committing an atrocity or robbery or some other felony.  </p>

<p>This statement could be said for what whites feel in black dominated urban areas and public transport. However out concerns are more than justified. I wonder when the neo-cons are going to start groups to try to get whites to visit the ghetto- oh, wait all the &#8220;myths&#8221; about black on white crime are true, never mind.</p>

A while back AmRen posted an item about Hispanics being reluctant to use the National Parks system. Now we learn that blacks don&rsquo;t like camping because bears will eat them. </p>
<p>Myself, I&rsquo;ve always preferred vacationing in cities rather than the country   &mdash;   but it now appears the Great Outdoors offers better company. Might have to go buy me a tent, a sleeping bag, a kerosene lantern, a rod and a reel. </p>
<p>Until we get meaningful freedom-from-association laws, we&rsquo;ll just to keep going wherever they&rsquo;re not. <br>

					<p>I go to Yosemite many times a year and the lack of Africans is one of the draws for me; I hope it stays as it is.  Blacks are tremendously self-absorbed and parochial, and find as little beauty in Yosemite and other natural wonders as they do in the museums and symphony halls they avoid so regularly.  <br>
But, to cut to the chase&hellip;.it&rsquo;s <span class="caps">BEARS</span>!  </p>
<p>I have spoken to blacks about camping in general and Yosemite in particular, and they fear the bears like they fear ghosts and witch doctors.  It isn&rsquo;t a bit of worry, it&rsquo;s a wide-eyed visceral fear of the bears that attack approximately zero of the millions of park visitors every year.</p>
<p>Note to white parents:  dress your daughters up in bear suits.</p>

					<p>Different racial /ethnic groups have different orientations and no amount of conditioning, or money spent (wasted) will change that.  How shall I put it&hellip;the vast majority of blacks (and hispanics for that matter) just do not appreciate nature the way whites do.  We see beauty, and experience a drawing curiosity for the mysteries of nature.  They just know that it is cold outside.</p>
<p>Of course, do not expect much funding for the National Parks under a Barak Obama administration.</p>

					<p>Totally true stereotype.  I grew up around urban blacks.  Their fear of the unknown (anything but the ghetto, mostly) is hilarious.  You should see them at the beach.  They wade knee-deep as racially aware white southerners laugh up their sleeves.</p>

					<p>Most likely the type of black person who is likely to go camping in order to enjoy nature is the same type of person most of us would easily get along with.  Certainly there are some blacks who live in an alternate reality and truly believe they are in danger of attacks by whites (maybe they watch too many movies and <span class="caps">T.V.</span>) but the main reason so few blacks go camping is probably that there&rsquo;s a general disregard for nature in black society.  Look at environmental groups and their protests. How many black faces do you see among them?  Look at those who voluntarily recycle, volunteer for road cleanup, donate to conservation groups.  How many of them are black?  By the same token we see a huge amount of littering among blacks and almost no concern about buying &#8220;Earth-friendly&#8221; products.  Yes, I&rsquo;m sounding like an environmentalist - but really I&rsquo;m just pointing out a cultural reality.</p>

 I think there are two factors that affect this:</p>
<p>  1) that blacks are generally more materialistic than<br>
     are other ethnic groups;</p>
<p>  2) that blacks are generally ethnocentric, such that<br>
     they tend to avoid any environment in which there<br><br>
     are few others of the same race.</p>

					<p>I will have to play the devils advocate here. And I agree with jewamongyou.   20ish, actually more like 25ish years ago I sold RVs. Probably 95% of the customers were middle age to retirement age whites, at least middle class and more often professional and upper class. But we got a few blacks and I must say that every one of them I got to know were utterly and completely different from the stereotypical black we discuss here. In fact they were the most white acting blacks I ever saw. I even count among my freinds a black dentist that was a  active RVer and who was very active in the RV travel club of which I am not sure if he was the only black or not. He would bring in his unit for servicing and just write a check never arguing or acting black when it came to paying the bill.  I knew a few others less well who also were valued customers.  I guess these were in the upper 10% of the 10% of the blacks that can compete on a even keel with whites. If more were like these we would have no troubles at all with them.  Kingfish      </p>

					<p>&#8220;Blacks are perfectly content to <span class="caps">FISH </span>in out of the way places, not even paying attention to whose property they are fishing on.That the author feels Blacks are unsafe camping doesn&rsquo;t ring true.&#8221;</p>
<p>  This is very true in the rural South. Blacks love to fish, and while not camping, they do get out and fish in out of the way places. A certain percentage of blacks enjoy hunting in the South as well. Maybe, Southern blacks are different in this regard from their Northern urban cousins. </p>

					<p>Not somewhere they ought to be? My god, weren&rsquo;t Africans and Native Americans mostly  hunter gatherers until whites gave them the accoutrements of modern society? </p>

					<p>I&rsquo;ve got to side with the blacks on this one.  I never noted that black troopers ever showed any particular fear of &#8220;camping out&#8221; in Vietnam.  In two tours there, one with a rifle company and one with the 5th Special Forces, blacks seemed to have no more fear of the dark or spending the night in pitch-black triple canopy jungle than whites.</p>
<p>As for their reluctance to go &#8220;camping&#8221; here at home, I&rsquo;ve never figured out what motivates some people to forego bathing, a soft bed, a snug house (on which they&rsquo;re making mortgage payments), a well-stocked kitchen, and a hi-def flat screen for sleeping on the ground, insects, potential inundation in a thunderstorm, <span class="caps">MRE</span>s, or the canned commercial equivalent of C-Rations.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re black and reading this and you&rsquo;re baffled that whites would want to go camping, that makes two of us.</p>

					<p>Kingfisher I live California which probably has the most diverse black population in the country and I&rsquo;ve only ever come across one person in my whole life who would come across as camping material.  Blacks with money either act uppity like camping outdoors is too good for them.  You also have the ones who haven&rsquo;t cut their cultural ties with the ghetto.  They like stepping out in big baggy white silk suits, bling bling and polka dotted hankerchiefs on their heads (worn Aunt Jemimah style) while cruising in their pimped out <span class="caps">SUV.  </span></p>

					<p>&#8220;This is great. In the past week I have learned that camp grounds, swimming pools and auto racing events are the safest place for my family.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that country music and equestrian events are two other things blacks avoid.  It&rsquo;s getting harder and harder to enjoy any kind of outing without them ruining it with their rap music and their rudeness, (cutting in line, etc.,) so we have to take what we can get.  I live in Southern California, and the theme parks have been completely ruined.</p>

					<p>&#8216;Of course, do not expect much funding for the National Parks under a Barak Obama administration&#8221;.</p>
<p>Or even worse. In the <span class="caps">UK,</span> Lottery funding was denied outdoor groups &amp; organisations because they failed to attract enough minority participation. Strange but true.</p>

					<p>Well this is just great, now we can look forward to being mugged on some remote trail, just when we thought we were<br>
away from it all.</p>

					<p>What I like most about camping is the ability to be alone and have time to reflect on things. It is great for introspection. You also have a wonderful chance to really appreciate nature.</p>
<p>Now blacks are generally self-absorbed and not known for self-reflection. As for nature, given the way blacks litter, (look at the trash they leave everywhere) they have little concern for nature or the environment. I have never seen a black face at any environmental rally or group I belonged to. Blacks would rather &#8220;keep it real&#8221; in the hood.</p>

					<p>Blacks are petrified of snakes for some reason. Even big Black males will squeal like a little girl if you get a snake within ten feet of them! It&rsquo;s hilarious.</p>
