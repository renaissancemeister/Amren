				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeff Shields, Philadelphia Inquirer, May 21, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Racist posters put up in Port Richmond and Northeast Philadelphia were &#8220;repugnant,&#8221; but still legal, the city&rsquo;s Commission on Human Relations said yesterday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The poster also shows three other white Philadelphia police officers killed in the line of duty, and the three black men charged in their deaths. It reads: &#8220;Guns don&rsquo;t kill people. Dangerous minorities do. How much longer can you ignore this?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;While we find their message of hate to be repugnant and their attempt to connect their motives and message to the death of Sgt. Liczbinski even more disgraceful, we live in a country that allows for certain freedoms of expression,&#8221; the commission stated in a news release yesterday. &#8220;At present, it appears that this group has not broken any laws.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mayor Nutter had asked the commission to investigate the posters. {snip}</p>

			<p>Of course the posters are legal.  Everyone has a right to say and publish whatever they feel.</p>
<p>If anything should be made illegal it should be the anti-white racist version of history that is taught in American public schools.</p>
<p>After all, there are no lies or misstatements of fact on the posters in question.</p>

			<p>They must of missed all the posters promoting: gay sex with little boys, beastiality, coked-up strip joints, &#8220;escort&#8221; services, S&M; porn shops, necrophilia, 2 Girls 1 Cup, Britney Spears CDs, Gangsta Rap CDs, drug use, and Marxist mass murderers, or else they would of &#8220;investigated&#8221; those too. </p>
<p>Right? Wrong.</p>
<p>Our so-called &#8220;leaders&#8221; don&rsquo;t care about any of those things. They care about one thing and one thing only, and that&rsquo;s keeping their paychecks. </p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got a good thing going for themselves and they don&rsquo;t want to mess it up. Our &#8220;leaders&#8221; do NOT want things to change. And that means that they have to suppress rational and intelligent dissent. </p>
<p>Which at this point is ONLY coming from the &#8220;far right.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Oh, I see how it is: when white police officers kill black criminals (usually in the line of duty and with justification) riots break out where property is destroyed and people&rsquo;s lives are threatened - yet those riots are &#8220;racist&#8221;.  But, when black criminals kill white police officers, simply pointed that fact out is &#8220;racist&#8221;.  I&rsquo;ve said this before and I&rsquo;ll say it again: white people need to learn how to riot again.  Obviously rioting is the only form of communication the authorities respect.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Guns don&rsquo;t kill people. Dangerous minorities do. &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.Funny I heard this phrase on television when they were doing a parody of the N.R.A. The fact is to say that blacks are inherantly dangerous is no different than saying that white people are inherantly racist.Something the left says all the time</p>

<p>Much to their chagrin.  If they had their way, those who put up these posters would face far worse legal punishment than the black thugs the posters reference.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Guns don&rsquo;t kill people. Dangerous minorities do. How much longer can you ignore this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Part of the unwritten style manual of the urban MSM is the term &#8220;gun violence&#8221; used in connection with crimes committed WITH firearms.  (with, not by)  Used often enough people might get the impression that guns, or the presence of them, cause violence.</p>
<p>States like Maine, Vermont, West Virginia, and North and South Dakota have some of the highest rates of gun ownership in the United States and &hellip; very low per capita homicide rates.  North and South Dakota and Vermont are in the vicinity of 1.3 per 100,000.  These states are also overwhelmingly white, as are Maine and West Virginia.</p>
<p>Philadelphia is the exact opposite.  If there were not a single firearm within the city limits its inhabitants would find something else with which to stab, stomp, or bludgeon people to death with.</p>

			<p>KSS strikes again. Of course, they will be called racist and &#8220;White Supremacists&#8221; even though they are not. The Nation of Islam started in Philadelphia, I wonder if Malcolm X was ever investigated by the &#8220;Human Right&rsquo;s Commision&#8221;.<br>

			<p> Four White police officers have been murdered in the line of duty. Three blacks have been arrested in their murders. Black males commit a hugely disproportionate share of the murders in the U.S. as a whole.</p>
<p> Where is the &#8220;racism&#8221; and &#8220;hate&#8221; in those statements? Sounds like just the facts, ma&rsquo;am, just the facts, to me. Typical of the bleeding hearts that instead of looking at such posters and thinking, &#8220;You know, maybe they&rsquo;ve got something there,&#8221; they fly into a rage and try to hush up the ones who are speaking the truth.</p>

<p>Why is it always a &ldquo;repugnant&rdquo; message of &ldquo;hate,&rdquo; to simply point out the races of black murderers and those of their white victims? Certainly, since we are all &ldquo;equal,&rdquo; there is enough of this both ways to go around, right?</p>
<p>Well, The Color of Crime took care of that myth!</p>
<p>Here are the hard facts of life, posters like this must be investigated and denounced, simply because they tell a horrible and (to some) a painful truth. This truth being, that minorities are dangerous to whites, they do not &ldquo;enrich&rdquo; us, and we would be better off without them in our midst. Moreover, given the &ldquo;solidarity&rdquo; of these &ldquo;communities of color&rdquo; in support of their criminal classes, retribution should be rather collective when taken. </p>
<p>Time again, for my favorite quotation from Niccolo Machiavelli&rsquo;s The Prince: </p>
<p>&ldquo;Here a question arises: whether it is better to be loved than feared, or the reverse. The answer is of course, that it would be best to be both loved and feared. But since the two rarely come together, anyone compelled to choose will find greater security in being feared than in being loved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They will never love us &ldquo;white devils&rdquo; but perhaps they should relearn to fear us, like they once did (before we became obsessed with making them &ldquo;love&rdquo; us)  or even more so from now on? That is the solution to this country&rsquo;s race problems: not asking for forgiveness, not paying them off, not bending to every one of their ever increasing and horrendously dim-witted demands!</p>
<p>Let them know without compunction, &lsquo;one of our kind dies at the hands of one of yours, those hands will be amputated a million fold.&rsquo;</p>
<p>End of story!</p>

			<p>If the posters are legal, how does the city justify using paid public servants&rsquo; time &#8220;investigating&#8221; the matter?  Are we to assume that this means the officials involved are completely caught up on the rest of their work?</p>

<p>While I find it repugnant that blacks are overwhelmingly responsible for murder, rape and related thuggery, I find it even more repugnant that politically-correct media outlets and election-sensitive politicians show more &#8220;outrage and moral indignation&#8221; about the accurate descriptions of murderers, rapists and thugs. </p>

			<p>Many middle-class blacks don&rsquo;t entirely agree with Louis Farrakhan, but they defend him all the same.  They feel that although Farrakhan&rsquo;s style is often controversial, the truth in his speeches and writings should be acknowledged and respected.</p>
<p>Well, what goes around, comes around. Two can play that game. I think what these controversial posters are stating is basically  true. The FBI&rsquo;s Uniform Crime Report statistics can back up the message in the posters.</p>
<p>Philadelphia&rsquo;s Commission on Human Relations said the posters were &#8220;repugnant.&#8221;  What is more repugnant to me is the violent crime perpetrated by inner-city blacks. I doubt this Commission would condemn the lyrics that a lot of rap groups put out. Typical hypocrisy. </p>

			<p>What is repugnant and disgraceful is that black on white violence goes on unabated and only a small few will call it what it really is. Good old Mayor Nutter will investigate and monitor the group proclaiming the truth and in the meantime the real hate crimes will keep occuring. &#8220;How much longer can you ignore this&#8221;? What a crying shame it is that we &#8220;live in a country that allows for certain freedoms of expression&#8221;. Were the perps expressing their opinions when they pulled the trigger and gunned down the cops? Let brutha Hussein get in the oval office and just wait and see how brazen they will be then. Just wait and see how much freedom of expression you will have then. Then &#8220;Americas chickens&#8221; will really have come home to roost.     </p>

			<p>Other than offending the &#8220;delicate&#8221; sensibilities of the black residents of Philadelphia - what is wrong with these posters? </p>
<p>(A) The message on the posters is true.<br>
(B) They don&rsquo;t contain profanity.<br>
(C) They ask whites to snap-out of their collective media-induced coma and think.</p>
<p>The only problem is that this message is considered to be &#8220;repugnant&#8221; to everything PC. In Mayor Nutter&rsquo;s world: If we don&rsquo;t like the truth, we&rsquo;ll just persecute those who dare to present it.</p>
<p>In the original article, tipsters are encouraged to e-mail or call with information. I guess there aren&rsquo;t any unsolved murders in Philadelphia that require police attention. </p>

			<p>If they are not racist and are legal as they must be for they have been judged as legal and just stating a fact, what right has the media et al to call them &#8220;racist&#8221;.  Grounds for suing?  At least demands for apologies should be forthcoming:  Unless of course the word was used as &#8220;racist&#8221; in the Press, or &#8220;so-called racist&#8221; on the radio etc.</p>

			<p>The truth always hurts. Blacks are responsible for most of the violent crime in urban america. Look at their culture and leaders and you&rsquo;ll know it&rsquo;s true. Their &#8220;leaders&#8221; if not violent criminals themselves, run around trying to get other black criminals off the hook. Their so called spiritual leaders have them believe that whitey is the devil and their Rap, well you know what that is all about. </p>

			<p>This will expose my hidden fascist streak, for which I feel guilty. But I secretly think no one should be allowed to put posters up on public property of any kind, expressing any view, because they damage public property. </p>
<p>Beyond that, however, free speech is free speech, people should be able to put up whatever they like, short of obscene sexual material. </p>
<p>That said, if it were my kid putting those posters up I would punish him. No one needs the stigma attached to those who express such views. I feel guilty about this, too. I&rsquo;m a hypocrite when it comes to free speech. </p>

			<p>&ldquo;While we find their message of hate to be repugnant and their attempt to connect their motives and message to the death of Sgt. Liczbinski even more disgraceful, we live in a country that allows for certain freedoms of expression,&rdquo; the commission stated in a news release yesterday. &ldquo;At present, it appears that this group has not broken any laws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Notice that the commission&rsquo;s statement above nowhere concedes that the posters are based in fact. Instead, it launches ad hominem attacks on the messengers, and ends with the almost sorrowful conclusion that &#8220;At present, it appears that this group has not broken any laws.&#8221; i.e., this leftist commission was unable to invent a justification to launch another inquistion. </p>
<p>This provides another good look into the moral-posturing, tyrannical liberal attitude, which is anything but &#8216;liberal.&rsquo;  </p>

			<p>To &#8220;GuiltyLiberal&#8221; I would suggest a Fleet enema, available at most drug stores. I see NOTHING WRONG with those posters which simply are in protest of that ridiculous &#8220;gun grab&#8221; instigated by a number of Black preachers, ministers, etc.</p>
<p>Those ministers were pressuring State officials in Harrisburg, stupidly blaming &#8220;gun availability&#8221; for Black kids shooting each other in the inner city slums. Gun availability was not and could hardly be blamed for the killings. The Black SHOOTERS are the blame. Not a single gun used by these punks was bought legally in a legitimate gun store. They either were stolen during earlier burglaries, were bought from each other or through straw man buyers who posed as legitimate gun purchasing customers!</p>
<p>That mindless killing, rape, violence is an integral part of Black culture is inarguable. A racial trait as well demonstrated today by Afro-Americans as it is by Blacks in EVERY Black nation back on the African Continent or by Blacks who immigrated to Europe!</p>
<p>Given that indisputable TRUTH, why that ridiculous hysteria over the posters? Surely the Officer was murdered by the Blacks charged with the crime. So again, what&rsquo;s the big deal? The posters do nothing but tell the hard, uncomfortable truth about Blacks in general.</p>

			<p>We should put up posters like this, with facts like these, in every black city in America.</p>
<p>The blacks will go bananas, and it will force media attention.</p>
<p>The more straight to the point and factual the posters and fliers are the better - with sources.</p>

			<p><i>Racist Posters in Parts of Phila. Deemed Legal</i></p>
<p>Our liberal would-be masters at their most Orwellian: fabricate in the mind of the uncritical reader a connection between crime and racism; suggest that normality equates the two; frame the issue of racism as one teetering on the brink of legality; use this connection to imply that racists are, ipso facto, borderline criminals; suggest that the &#8220;technical&#8221; legality constitutes malfeasance; progress will soon correct this oversight.</p>
<p>Corporate journalists are prostitutes.  I hesitate to use this metaphor out of respect for prostitutes.</p>

			<p>An unkind metaphor I would not have chosen, Svigor.  A prostitute generally provides the customer with what he is paying for; we expect corporate journalists to provide us with news, and instead receive a steady stream of half-truths, distortions, and falsehoods.<br>

			<p>There was a news conference shortly after the most recent officer slaying.  The black chief of police and Mayor Nutter first stated that the black man who shot the officer had been convicted of SEVENTEEN&hellip;that&rsquo;s 17&hellip;.previous crimes.  Within 30 seconds of stating this, they launched in to a call for more gun control because that&rsquo;s what killed the officer.  Couldn&rsquo;t be a collapse of the criminal justice system that lets a person with SEVENTEEN previous convictions go free.  By the way, he possessed the gun illegally even though there already gun control laws that &#8220;prevent&#8221; him from owning the gun.  INSANITY.</p>
<p>Where can I get some of these posters?  Actually they&rsquo;re probably superfluous out here in redneck country Pennsylvania, we already know the facts.</p>

<p>Mr. Scott, I regard the handful of elites who employ these prostitutes (journalists) as their customers, not the millions of dupes who uncritically read their work; in this sense, the urinalists are providing the customer with <i>precisely</i> what he wants.</p>

			<p>What should be illegal is the Commission, which casued a business owner to spend a lot of money to find that he had done nothing wrong in asking people to order in English!</p>

			<p>Though you have pointed out quite the distinction: prostitution is a victimless crime; urinalism is not.</p>

			<p>Reading PHILLY.COM this morning, one sees another half-dozen shootings reported. Now the burning question:  Were ANY of the perps white? Of course not. Simply more killing of Blacks BY Blacks. Yet the dimwits keep the myth going that Whites are Blacks worst enemies.</p>
<p>Reading more news items&hellip; I see more violence back home on the Mother Continent, AFRICA&hellip; by Blacks, of course, against Blacks. Go figure, as the saying goes.</p>

			<p>Didn&rsquo;t AmRen report on a story a while back about some black guy who wanted 10,000 (not sure about that number) black volunteers to patrol Philly to help reduce crime? Was it just another all-talk-no-action black bust?</p>
