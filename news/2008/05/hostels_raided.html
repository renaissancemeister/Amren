						<p>South African police and military units raided three hostels Thursday in a clampdown on xenophobic attacks that have left more than 40 dead, authorities said.</p>
<p>Twenty-eight people were arrested in the &#8220;extremely successful&#8221; first joint operation, according to a statement from the South African police and South African National Defence Force.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police said 42 people have been killed in the violence, which began last week in Johannesburg&rsquo;s Alexandra Township and has been concentrated in the city&rsquo;s poorest areas.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The country has also seen a disturbing throwback to the 1980s apartheid-era lynching tactic of &#8220;necklacing,&#8221; which was widely used in the townships at the time.</p>
<p>Used on suspected informants, the &#8220;necklace&#8221; is a car tire, filled with petrol, put around the person&rsquo;s neck and set alight.</p>
<p>The victims are mainly immigrants and refugees from other parts of Africa, including Zimbabwe, where a devastated economy has sent at least two million people across the border in search of a better life.</p>
<p>Some say the attacks stem from a long-standing feeling among locals that the number of immigrants in South Africa results in shortages of jobs and essential needs.</p>
<p>Inadequate housing, a lack of running water and electricity, the rising prices of food, and escalating crime &mdash; nearly 20,000 people were slain in South Africa last year &mdash; add to the resentment. Video Watch analysis of reasons behind xenophobic attacks »</p>
<p>South Africa&rsquo;s army has been patrolling riot-hit townships to restore calm as the country counts the cost of the xenophobic attacks.</p>
<p>Brigadier General Kwena Mangope of the South African Department of Defense said troops were assisting the South African Police Service, the national police.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some say that millions have recently fled to South Africa from Zimbabwe because of violence there since the county&rsquo;s stalled election.</p>

     <br>
&#8220;Police said 42 people have been killed in the violence, which began last week&hellip;The country has also seen a disturbing throwback to the 1980s apartheid-era lynching tactic of &ldquo;necklacing,&rdquo; which was widely used in the townships at the time.&#8221;</i><br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br>
It seems that people (especially blacks) always need a scapegoat for their failings    &mdash;   someone to blame  all their troubles upon.  Blacks, being everywhere at the botton of the ladder, have the most grudges and jealousy to vent.  Right now, it&rsquo;s other blacks that they vent their rage on.  In the black townships, those are the most immediately accessible victims.  But make no mistake, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before they get around to doing this to whites. We&rsquo;ll be seeing this in our lifetimes.  Blacks have been propagandized and indoctrinated for many years now to see the White Man as the source and cause of all their troubles. That  training cannot fail to bear poisonous fruit when the time is ripe.</p>
<p>When that happens, it won&rsquo;t come as a historical precedent. It has happened before, in places such as Haiti where all the whites were either killed or forced to flee for their lives. The  Obama-loving leftist media and  the dewy-eyed cheerleaders of &#8220;black liberation&#8221; choose to play this fact down and bury it in history,  but how will they explain it away when it&rsquo;s happening under our noses in today&rsquo;s world?   </p>
<p>We&rsquo;re coming to it.  It&rsquo;s inevitable.  And who knows where it will start?  It won&rsquo;t be only  in South Africa.  And when it starts,  once it does, it could race like wildfire from one country to another.  Just as we&rsquo;ve seen within the past year or two, the utterly new phenomenon of  Moslem riots and threats in the streets of our capital cities, a spectable that we never saw  in Western countries before,  when will riots turn from<br>
mere threats to real murders and outright mayhem?  Encouraged to new acts of brazenness by the observable spinelessness of our pusillanimous &#8220;leaders&#8221;, it is inevitable.  I say again, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s  already plenty of black crime that the authorities and media hush up right now.  Of course, those are individual black crimes on an personal scale, which they can claim  are just atypical anomalies.  When there is massive and rampant black crime occurring on a large scale, it&rsquo;s difficult to imagine how they  (the authorities and media) will manage to ignore it or explain it away.</p>

			<p>Just another normal day in good ole SA! </p>
<p>Sadly it helps to keep the daily rates of provable illegal killings up to the 85 average since 1994.  President Mbeki must be also held responsible for not censuring Mugabe in the last few years thus causing the flood of Zim. refugees (officially estimated at 3 million) that were not given special refugee status in SA.</p>
<p>Take a look at www.spainvia.com/evilapartheid.htm if you are interested in seeing how evil Apartheid was NOT.   One day, honest historians will perhaps grudgingly write that it would probably been the best route to take for the SA blacks and the continent in view of what has (then) happened.  If they are not too scared of being accused of racism even then.</p>
