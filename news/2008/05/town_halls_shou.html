						<p>More than 10 million people are to have their everyday disputes, their politics and their business lives checked by new &#8220;tension monitoring&#8221; committees.</p>
<p>The committees are to be set up to try to cut the risk of riots or disturbances in the aftermath of terrorist outrages or outbreaks of local racial trouble.</p>
<p>They will ask for and file reports on named troublemakers whose political activities are considered to be raising community tensions.</p>
<p>Reports on the behaviour and attitudes of local residents will be collected by community workers, neighbourhood wardens, local councillors and provided by voluntary organisations, according to a paper published by Communities Secretary Hazel Blears today.</p>
<p>It will then be considered by the monitoring committees run by town halls.</p>
<p>A sample &#8220;tension monitoring form&#8221; for use in checking on the likelihood of local racial or religious trouble asks for details of individuals considered to be making political trouble.</p>
<p>The monitoring committees will ask for information on those identified as troublemakers with includes &#8220;age, gender, ethnicity and faith&#8221; of those being reported on.</p>
<p>The call for monitoring of everyday life in the cause of &#8220;community cohesion contingency planning&#8221; was made by Mrs Blears in a paper aiming to help identify &#8220;tension hotspots&#8221; and improve cohesion &mdash; the Government&rsquo;s buzzword for reducing racial and religious strife.</p>
<p>The word was adopted in 2006 after the once-dominating left-wing doctrine of multiculturalism was dropped by Labour because it made tensions worse rather than better.</p>
<p>But the establishment of monitoring committees in town halls is likely to generate new concerns about spying and surveillance by local councils.</p>
<p>Concerns have deepened in recent weeks after the Daily Mail revealed that Poole council in Dorset had spied on a family&rsquo;s life for three weeks because it wrongly suspected the parents of abusing rules on school catchment areas.</p>
<p>There are also worries over the spread of new council quasi-police forces, like the bin police that recently gave a criminal record to a bus driver in Cumbria who left the lid of his family wheelie bin open by four inches.</p>
<p>Mrs Blears&rsquo; paper said that a recent survey by her department found that 81 per cent of the population feel that people from different backgrounds get on well in her area.</p>
<p>However, that means that nearly one in five people &mdash; more than 11 million &mdash; live in areas where the new tension monitoring committees will operate.</p>
<p>The Communities Secretary said: &#8220;The overwhelming majority of people in this country live successfully side by side but we cannot take this for granted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Challenges to cohesion do exist &mdash; this might be between different ethnic or faith groups or new migrants and longer-term residents &mdash; but things can be done to address problems at the earliest opportunity and stop things escalating.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said town halls would get an extra £50 million to help them set up and run the new tension monitoring committees, each of which will be run by a senior local authority official.</p>
<p>The committees will include representatives from housing authorities, schools, the NHS, the fire brigade, community workers and neighbourhood wardens in area which have them. Voluntary, community and faith groups will also be asked to provide information.</p>
<p>They will record &#8220;qualitative community intelligence&#8221; alongside reports of race incidents, gang and turf conflicts, disputes between neighbours, complaints about noise, and examples of low local trust, including low trust in politicians.</p>
<p>Economic activity, including business investment, and housing demand will also be monitored. So will political extremism.</p>
<p>The &#8220;sample tension monitoring form&#8221; provided by civil servants as a model for councils to follow in recording information calls for the name of the monitor and his or her organisation to be filed.</p>
<p>It asks for an assessment of whether levels of community tension are high, medium or low.</p>
<p>Under the heading &#8220;political&#8221; monitors are asked to provide &#8220;details of situation/incident (ie where, when, who (age, gender, ethnicity, faith), and what (useful to specify whether &lsquo;experienced, evidence, or potential).&#8221;</p>
<p>Councils are told that under data protection law they are allowed to record details of individuals as long as the material is &#8220;fairly&#8221; gathered and stored.<br>

			<p>They could simply put up a crime map to identify all the activity that is usually described as &#8216;tensions&rsquo;. That seems pretty unlikely tho. Instead the tension area&rsquo;s where whites become victims will instead be written about in such a way as to propagate even more white paralysis.</p>

<p>Yes, and then suspects will be brought in who are thought to have harbored bad thoughts, and they will be required to go before the truth commission.</p>
<p>Anyone found not having his/her mind &#8220;right,&#8221; will be required to undergo extensive sensitivity training in one of the work camps to be set up.</p>
<p>There recordings will be aired, describing the joys of diversity, and everyone will be expected to participate.  Anyone not doing so will be marked for the &#8220;truth&#8221; room, where he will undergo severe and intensive conditioning to help him improve his thinking and correct his errant behavior until he is in line with accepted thought and behavior.</p>
<p>Those not succombing to &#8220;assistance&#8221; will disappear from the face of the earth.</p>
<p>It is change we need.  And hope!  To become a great &#8220;unified&#8221; society where classism, racism and the like are unheard of.</p>
<p>It is what WE think is best for you, because WE are so much smarter.  All three of our candidates have the exact same agenda to help you along.</p>
<p>[Yes, it is your worst nightmare come true and it is here with us now.  Will you succomb like a timid wimp?]</p>

<p>So, when &#8220;NGOs&#8221; do it, it&rsquo;s not totalitarianism? </p>
<p>This new &#8220;neoliberal&#8221; totalitarianism is much worse than any of its previous incarnations. </p>
<p>At least with the Nazism and communism people knew when the state was &#8220;stepping on their neck.&#8221; </p>
<p>But neoliberalism is more deceptive, more conscious of the possible reactions of its subjects, less predictable and therefore much more dangerous. </p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s time for us to reconsider our support for &#8220;free markets&#8221; and &#8220;limited government,&#8221; because they are destroying our race.</p>

			<p>I can hardly believe what I&rsquo;m reading. Hitler, Stalin, and Mao would be exceedingly proud of what the U.K. is doing to itself in the name of &#8216;cohesion&rsquo;. When was the last time someone in the &#8216;government&rsquo; considered the words &#8216;personal freedom&rsquo;? It seems that freedom is something the U.K. &#8216;government&rsquo; considers irrelevant anymore. The average white Brit and what his fathers fought and died for for centuries is unimportant. The average white Brit and his values, culture, children, and hopes for the future mean nothing to the ruling elites. All that does matter to the elitists is their leftist, communistic agenda and the application of the crushing power of the state grinding down all white opposition to their disenfranchisment and disinheritance of the white race. After all, what could be more important than &#8216;cohesion&rsquo;? Surely, not the survival of the white race and the British culture and nation. That would be selfish of us, wouldn&rsquo;t it?</p>

			<p>But on the plus side, none of this will work. Tension will continue to grow between &#8216;communities&rsquo; and communities will continue to isolate themselves from each other and eventually there will be an almighty dust up. That&rsquo;s what usually happens doesn&rsquo;t it? Then why should this be any different?</p>

			<p>1984 was a bit late in arriving, but it&rsquo;s here now. Big brother is watching you, and it&rsquo;s all perfectly legal as long as it is &#8220;fairly&#8221; done.  That includes &ldquo;qualitative community intelligence&rdquo; (newspeak for &#8220;gossip&#8221; and &#8220;subjective opinions&#8221;). And woe betide any anti-social elements found guilty by this process of political extremism, lack of &#8220;cohesion&#8221; or low trust.</p>
<p>How did it get to this?</p>

			<p>The cold war may have ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union, but the marxists and their beliefs are still very much alive and are at the root of much of this. They are also represented in the environmental movement, and you will notice that the Golobal Warming &#8220;solutions&#8221; are set up to harm the economies of western nations, while ignoring the alledged impact of communist nations. We must reject all of this nonsense. This article details big brotherism and is a last ditch effort to force peoples to get along that cannot, and will result in even more hostility and resentment. Nobody likes a snitching busybody.</p>

			<p>As so many professional articles and comments by posters have made clear, diversity is a losing proposition, and can&rsquo;t even operate in any adequate way, without massive governmental interference. This interference will inevitably lead to a tyrannical central government, that always &#8220;knows what is right&#8221; and must &#8220;keep the peace&#8221;, regardless of the concern, or rights, consequences to the citizens.</p>

<p>The above is exactly what the Marxist one-worlders have largely succeeded in trying to achieve. We can call them all the names I&rsquo;ve listed below in order to distinguish who our enemies are but should never forget, thought the names are different, the NWO/marxist agenda is still the same.</p>
<p>The Cold War may have ended but cultural marxism is still very much on the agenda. Marxists don&rsquo;t fade away, they simply metamorphosise into liberals/greens/anti-fascists/ socialists/Fabians etc., &amp; the latest brainwashing scheme in the UK, Common Purpose &amp; many other terms they use to conceal their agenda. They are the zealots in the one-world mass immigration nation-wrecking EU/one world crew leading the naive useful idiots to their fantasy one-world Utopia. U.S. &#8216;liberals&rsquo; told us that Castro wasn&rsquo;t a Marxist but an agraraian reformer. The British Labour Party is full of &#8216;ex-Marxists&rsquo; &amp; Fabian socialists as are many European left-wing parties. Google [potential future UK PM] British Foreign Secretary David Miliband, his father Adolphe [Ralph] Miliband &amp; his grandfather Samuel Miliband &amp; you&rsquo;ll soon discover whether Marxism is dead &amp; buried or not. It lives on through its many proxy groups &amp; front organisations &amp; is still achieving its ends through more subtle means.<br>
