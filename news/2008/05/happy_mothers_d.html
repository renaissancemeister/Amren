						<p>It&rsquo;s a happy Mother&rsquo;s Day for an Arkansas woman &mdash; she&rsquo;s pregnant with her 18th child. Michelle Duggar, 41, is due on New Year&rsquo;s Day, and the latest addition will join seven sisters and 10 brothers. There are two sets of twins.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve had three in January, three in December. Those two months are a busy time for us,&#8221; she said, laughing.</p>
<p>The Duggars&rsquo; oldest child, Josh, is 20, and the youngest, Jennifer, is nine months old.</p>
<p>The fast-growing family lives in Tontitown in northwest Arkansas in a 7,000-square-foot home. All the children &mdash; whose names start with the letter J &mdash; are home-schooled.</p>
<p>Duggar has been been pregnant for more than 11 years of her life, and the family is in the process of filming another series for Discovery Health.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Duggar said she&rsquo;s six weeks along and the pregnancy is going well. She and her husband, Jim Bob Duggar, said they&rsquo;ll keep having children as long as God wills it.</p>

			<p>  The Duggars demonstrate, as do many of the Mormons, Amish and Orthodox Jews, that being White doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to stop at 1.8 children per married couple. If only each White couple would have just one or two more children   &mdash;   three or four instead of just two, or one, or none   &mdash;   we could not only keep up with the blacks and Hispanics in this country demographically, but stay ahead of them, since we tend to take better care of our families than they do. Hats off to Jim Bob, Michelle and their wonderful, still-growing family! </p>

			<p>I also sincerely hope that the Duggars stand tall against the inevitable onslaught of criticism from the left.  After all, they are white, conservative, and Christian.  That makes them a target of the egalitarian, anti-liberty left.</p>
<p>The Duggars seem like truly decent, dignified people.  It would be a shame if the leftists try to vilify them. </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m sure that there will be comments here in this thread about this story bashing them for procreating a lot, and some of this bashing will come from self-proclaimed white racialists.  Let me point out the sad reality that for every couple like the Duggars, there are probably more than 18 white couples who will have no children.</p>

			<p>This family procreates all much as the typical black female.  Except in this case all the children are from one father, he takes care of his young, and the family is not on welfare.</p>

And what a huge difference from an increasing number of WHITE families as well.  The girls wear dresses, and the boys have short haircuts.  Not a single tattoo to be seen.  What a truly refreshing sight.</p>

			<p>With a 7000 (!) square-foot house, it can be safely assumed Mr. Duggar is very successful at what he does for a living.  Interesting, is it not, that a large white family can pay its own way, without being a burden on even the public school system, while still paying the taxes that keep things running for the less-productive.</p>

			<p>I am really happy for Michelle and Jim Bob.. and by the way, They are members of an evangelical Christian movement called Quiverful, which holds that children are a blessing from God and that husbands and wives should gladly accept all the children they are given. My husband and I have 3 children, unfortunately we can have no more.. but, if we could, we would have a houseful.<br>
I think it is great that the girls dress like girls, wearing  skirts or dresses,. and the boys look like boys  no sagging pants or tattoos..just clean wholesome kids..</p>

			<p>I was going to post a comment that this type of family is not manageable or liveable with most incomes. I think the children are raised to not feel the need to satisfy excessive material wants. I wondered where the money came from to support 18 children.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re conservative Baptists and followers of the Quiverfull movement. This viewpoint eagerly receives children as blessings from God, eschewing all forms of common sense, including natural family planning and sterilization. Jim Duggar is a former state legislator and now a real estate agent with commercial property.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re doing right. But it doesn&rsquo;t seem that most white couples would have this much faith to be able to raise a family of this magnitude. </p>

			<p>Large families of Whites do exist, I personally have a mini-clan of 10 cousin offspring growing in the NE USA. Their range of careers go from mildly skilled blue collar to well-paid doctorate degree levels, but that is America to the core and the path that families have followed for centuries. They are starting families of their own and following their own paths, as American families do.</p>
<p>Whether they agree with Amren or not, it does not matter. Their children are worth much more than future lawnmowers or toilet cleaners who refuse to accept the language or customs of the land they exploit. They are ultimately the real Americans, not the anchor baby spawn of illegal opportunists.</p>

			<p>Congratulations to the Duggars.  Looking at the picture,I&rsquo;d say that God has showered a world of blessings on this family.  I&rsquo;m sure they have their share of typical family problems but at least they aren&rsquo;t on welfare and as one poster noted above. ALL of the children have the same father and mother.  </p>
<p>I am wishing them the best of everything.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s their choice, but I think it&rsquo;s wrong. You simply cannot give a child the attention they deserve when there are 17 others clamoring for attention. </p>
<p>When you&rsquo;ve got this many kids you end up with a Hilary Clinton mentality &#8220;It takes a village&#8221;. This woman may not be trying to get neighbors to help raise her kids, but I guarantee these older sisters are doing a LOT of the parenting, which isn&rsquo;t fair to them. </p>
<p>Plus, it&rsquo;s kinda creepy that they won&rsquo;t let the girls wear pants and cut their hair. </p>

<p>Then they are disobeying the Word of God, Jaqui.</p>
<p>My wife strives, even in winter, to wear a dress or skirt to work. Only when it goes below zero, does she wear slacks- but only feminine, tailored, slacks. Never jeans, or &#8216;androgynous&rsquo; clothes. <br>
One, because it is professional.<br>
Two, because it is biblical.<br>
Three, because it is societally making a statement.<br>
and Four, NO, I NEVER said she should dress this way. She was dressing as a woman for two decades before I ever met her!</p>
<p>Henry Makow has had a number of posts over at his website (www.henrymakow.com) on an article called, &#8220;THE RELENTLESS MARCH OF DANISH COMMUNISM/FEMINISM BY PHILIP JONES&#8221; about how UGLY women in slacks are to men. Women, get a clue.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, I see more grace, civility, and NORMALITY in the Duggars than all the &#8216;trendy liberals&rsquo; here in LOON-land (MN).</p>
<p>I would be so blessed to have ten families like this in my parish. Instead we are starting to see overt HATRED by WHITES for their own genetic replacement,[https://hearth  &mdash;  stone.blogspot.com/<br>
2008/04/white-mans-heresy.html] which is merely an indication that the &#8216;mental disorder formerly known as liberalism&rsquo; goes far beyond the political. And that means, your/my neighbors are more &#8216;looney&rsquo; than you at first surmised&hellip;..</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve seen them on TV before. And I say congrats to them, and have a few more.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve known other White families over the years with lots of kids, and used to wonder why they&rsquo;d want so many. I thought they were crazy, or simply overdoing it, and felt that way about ANYONE who wanted so many kids. That was before I met up with a black woman I used to know who had eight pregnancies (one miscarriage and one stillbirth - net result six kids), from at least three different fathers, on welfare, and totally irresponsible. One of her kids died as a result of neglect or abuse, and now she and one of the fathers are in prison for it. Then I saw the Duggars on TV, and my thinking totally changed. I&rsquo;d rather see a White family have as many kids as possible and take good care of them, not abusing the system, than any black person with even one child on welfare. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got two daughters myself from my first marriage, both adults now, and though I wouldn&rsquo;t mind siring more, I&rsquo;m starting to get too old for it (I&rsquo;d be over 65 by the time any more children of mine graduated high school if I started again now).</p>
<p>One final comment - I&rsquo;m a Master&rsquo;s degree student, and I&rsquo;ve often thought when sitting in class that the students in my class are the kind of people who should be having many children rather than the welfare abusers who currently do. Most of us are White, all at least reasonably, if not highly, intelligent, and all with excellent earning potential to take care of our own. If something doesn&rsquo;t change relatively soon, our society is going to crash, as there will be too many dumb people and not enough smart ones.</p>

			<p>So much for the &#8220;theory&#8221; that White women aren&rsquo;t as &#8220;fertile&#8221; as hispanic or black women and that there&rsquo;s &#8220;no way&#8221; we could ever &#8220;keep up with them&#8221;. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve actually read from some White women on THIS forum.</p>
<p>It all depends on what&rsquo;s really important, I guess, family or career&hellip;you can&rsquo;t have both&hellip;and on what type of man you choose as your husband as there are countless men like her husband out there to choose from.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Mrs. Duggar. Your life decisions have displayed a down-to-earth wisdom that is all-too-lacking today and it has rewarded you with an abundance, literally. You are an inspiration to us all.</p>

			<p>The means of &#8220;re&#8221;production, and not production is what shapes social relations and dynamics. Whites are striking out because of the pill and its demographic diasaster. I call this time frame, the &#8220;post pill period&#8221; This theory of the pill&rsquo;s impact explains almost everything from why illegal immigrant numbers are welcomed by business and labor to rampant pornography. Women can pursue selfish pleasure to their heart&rsquo;s content without fear of pregnancy, even though selection eliminates their genes from the pool forever. The genie is out of the pill bottle.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, sincere congratulations to Mrs. Duggars </p>

			<p>Contrary to what many modern experts say, a large family is very important for the well-being of women. Women who give to a lot of children tend to be healthier and attractive in their old age and it keeps cancer of the ovaries at bay just as breast feeding keeps breast cancer at bay. No wonder these two types of cancer are so common today.</p>
<p>This is one of the best books I have read which promotes large families<br>

<a href="https://www.anthonymludovici.com/nh_06.htm" rel="nofollow">https://www.anthonymludovici.com/nh_06.htm</a></p>
<p>Thus a youthful marriage is quite important especially for women.<br>

			<p>Congratulations!  This warms my heart.  I trust from the above posters they aren&rsquo;t on welfare and earned this right for themselves.  And as a member of a big family, it&rsquo;s a joy to have lots of brothers and sisters taking care of you / to take care of, it isn&rsquo;t unfair to them, it&rsquo;s unfair to single children who never know what a family really is.</p>

			<p>Congratulations to the Dugger family! If only more whites would follow their fine example. Many American whites claim they cannot afford more children, its really a matter of priorities. Blacks and Mexicans have huge families even when they have much less money than white families do. </p>
<p>White people need to make whatever sacrifices are necessary to have as many children as possible. We are less than 12% of the world population, and the non white birth rate is exploding. Unless whites start having more children like the Dugger family, we face extinction.</p>
<p>The Dugger family discredits the stereotype propagated by liberal anti children intellectuals who claim that only ignorant white trash have large families, the Duggers look healthy, intelligent, and their children look happy. We need more people like them.</p>

<p>Not true. If person has siblings, on average each one shares 1/2 their genes. If they have cousins, on average each one shares 1/4 of their genes. Second cousins share on average 1/8 and so on.</p>

<p>Seen it. Funny movie. Unfortunately it makes it seem funny if the world (or at least the USA) is taken over by idiots. The problem is it won&rsquo;t be funny. It will be tragic. And there wouldn&rsquo;t be anywhere near as many White people as the movie makes it appear.</p>
<p>I have an IQ consistently tested to be over 130. Maybe I should donate to a sperm bank or something, since I really don&rsquo;t want any more children of my own to raise. At least a few of them probably will have an above-average IQ.</p>

			<p>This is one wonderful family&hellip;&hellip;but mex&rsquo;s and blacks have plenty too but thats only cause they get more welfare which this family The Duggers DO  NOT&hellip;..and when the blacks or latino &hellip;.families get to a certain age&hellip;most of them are in prison for an assortment of crimes&hellip;you know the usual&hellip;rape, robbery, murder&hellip;.fraud&hellip;.well you get what I mean.  All of the Duggers will make fine upstanding citizens&hellip;.the other rainbow colors&hellip;will not.  Why can&rsquo;t more families be like the Duggers???? All it takes is work and plenty of love!</p>

			<p>&#8220;When you&rsquo;ve got this many kids you end up with a Hilary Clinton mentality &ldquo;It takes a village&rdquo;.&#8221; </p>

<p><br>
I prefer &#8220;it takes a village&#8221; over &#8220;it takes a government&#8221; any day of the week.  </p>
<p>Hillary Clinton might be a flaming liberal, but she wasn&rsquo;t wrong with regards to her &#8220;village&#8221; comment.  Just a few decades ago, when neighbors actually looked out for each others&rsquo; safety and well-being (and were allowed, within reasonable limits, to discipline neighborhood children even if they weren&rsquo;t their own), neighborhoods (even non-white ones) tended to be safer and less dysfunctional than neighborhoods today. </p>
<p>That, to me, constitutes a &#8220;village&#8221; mentality that we could use more of in today&rsquo;s greedy, hedonistic times.</p>

			<p>I speak as part of a large Mormon family   &mdash;   my mother was one of seven, and my father one of five.  I&rsquo;ve managed to have three kids of my own, since starting at the age of 32, when I felt I was financially able to support a family.</p>
<p>Having deep roots in Utah (tracing both sides of my family to the 1840&rsquo;s pioneers), I can attest to the beauty of the people being produced out here!  Lots of blond, blue-eyed children, with strong morals and the desire to produce strong, familiy-oriented descendants.</p>
<p>Utah is what the United States should have been!</p>

			<p>I am usually not confrontational when I post here, but I have to get something off my chest.  </p>
<p>Why do some of you posters have a problem with the girls wearing dresses?  I am not going to quote scripture here, but the Bible clearly states that males and females are NOT to dress alike.  Since the Duggars are clearly and unequivocally Christian, it seems to me that their style of dress is consistent with their beliefs.  </p>
<p>Maybe their mode of dress is similar to the FLDS group in Texas (vilified by the liberal media), but so what??  Would you really be happier if these girls wore tight jeans or mini-skirts designed from Madison Avenue?</p>
<p>What if they were your daughters?</p>

			<p>I dress very similarly to the Duggars and feel that men are more respectful of me when I am in public. My husband is against having a large family but is starting to come around. To the person who says that it is priorites that keep people from having children I think it is finances, especially if you are white. Minorities seem to be able to get assistance to have as many kids as they see fit while hard working whites struggle to have more than 2. </p>

			<p>  I must take issue with one poster, and agree wholeheartedly with another. The person who said there was &#8220;no way Michelle could take care of all those children alone&#8221; and that some of the older daughters had to be helping and that was &#8220;not fair to them,&#8221; is missing the point. No, Michelle couldn&rsquo;t take care of 18 children by herself. But for one thing, don&rsquo;t you think Jim Bob helps her at all? And of course so do the older girls (and boys   &mdash;   you must just assume they do nothing to help). My mother was the fourth of 13 children, and she helped my grandmother to raise nine younger siblings. That&rsquo;s the way it is in a big family: One person doesn&rsquo;t have to struggle to do it all; everyone pitches in and helps   &mdash;   if they&rsquo;re people like the Duggars, or my mother&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p>  And when Grandma and Grandpa celebrated their 50th anniversary, she was still slim and very attractive for a lady 65 years old. That proves the point that the other poster made about having a large family being good for a woman. Yes, Grandpa and Grandma got married when she was 14 and he was 18; they stayed married until the day he died, 60 years later; and all of their kids turned out reasonably well.</p>

ONE: I am an atheist. Have been my whole life, with the exception of an experimental phase in my late teens, and that was with Wicca. I stopped when I realized how retarded religion is, and that I have no use for an imaginary friend. If you feel that religion and morality are inseparable, then take a look at me and my athiest friends. I&rsquo;m not shooting up schools, robbing banks, or doing drugs. I don&rsquo;t have godless orgies, sacrifice animals, or worship &#8220;the devil&#8221;. <br>
TWO: If men and women are not allowed to dress the same, then why is it that for thousands of years before, and hundreds of years after Christ, men wore flowing, loose fitting garments, and dare I say it - SKIRTS? If men and women are Biblically required to dress differently, then I say there is just as much room to argue that men are dressing incorrectly, and women are the ones who are supposed to &#8220;wear the pants&#8221; around here.</p>
<p>Lydia: I recently turned twenty-seven. I have had enough dates, boyfriends and lovers from the various parts of the country to determine that men don&rsquo;t want to get married. Marriage means responsibility and commitment, and neither is conducive to a life frivolity and selfishness. and hiding in school until the age of forty, racking up degrees, but never getting a real job, or simply just hanging out in cyberspace, playing WoW, and talking about the latest trend in female body piercings. I wash my hands of all of them. Whenever I feel lonely, I just remember how all my previous attempts at romance fared, and how much it hurts. I cry a little, and then I read a book. I have too much to do to dwell on my own failures for too long.</p>

<p><br>
    As with many large white families, these are religious Christian folk. In my experience, religious families have more children and more defined roles for the sexes. It seems like many highly educated, feminist-inclined women are the ones not having children. Some end up middle-aged without the prospect of marriage or family life. Maybe, a husband and family are not right for every American women.</p>

<p>&gt; Well, sort of&hellip;..  We still have a world population problem and nice Christians like these always seem to feel compelled to go out and fix it.  It would be interesting to track the lives of the children as they grow up.  When I was growing up it was the preachers kids who were often the wildest.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this illustrates the what the strength of religious belief and order is;  Rather than the actual validity of the faith, which many Christians have been getting way off purpose in recent decades by insisting on the fact of historical Christianity as claimed in the Gospels, it is the social order that ANY religion provides that is most valuable.  The only real fact is that most people need the guidance of relgious rules in their lives because the rule of law in a secular state is limited - usually to civil interations not personal conduct and ethics.  Another factor is the problem of the influence materialism and wealth.  The era of almost limitless wealth or the expectation of it, may be coming to an end for most people.  With that will be a return to organized religion as we are already seeing to an extent - and a decrease in the value of cheap material goods - especially since most those goods have really become cheap garbage (thanks to Chinese capitalism).</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with a return to simplicity and the values that come with it.  However, there will be and already is a cost to us as a whole.  We will have less infrastructure, less or no space programs that bring us many more benefits than we know, such as the many early warning systems that warn us of impending disasters (and there are plenty to watch).  Our recent ancestors routinely had as many as eighteen children.  My fourth great grandfather had eighteen, but only nine survived more than a year.  With a return to simplicity will come a return to infant mortality, poorer medical assistance, earlier death for more, etc.  But in the end, the entire world may need to do this to survive in the long run.</p>
<p>At a time where in many regions cell phones have messed up honey bees so much that hives are empty and blossoms aren&rsquo;t pollinated, nature seems to be putting on the brakes despite us and all our particulars about race and genetic survival.<br>

White women, faced with a generation of belligerently irresponsible men, are hesitant to have children with these boy-men. The difference between white women and other women is that we think about what we are bringing our children into.&#8221;</p>
<p>From an evolutionary, naturalistic perspective I think we guys, given the little investment in time and resources required to reproduce, have always been promiscuous compared to females. From a moral point of view this is labeled &#8220;irresponsible&#8221; or more to the point &#8220;lecherous&#8221;? But these labels are largely control devices? </p>
<p>Probably the greatest accomplishment of women was to civilize us to the degree achieved until the pill came along. Now  there&rsquo;s no holding back anyone anymore. The right to kill fetuses was only a matter of time to guarantee that women had no reproductive impediments to their new  Post-pill Period lifestyle. </p>
<p>If men are more hesitant today to have offspring, the pill and subsequent paternity uncertainty is a major factor. Now if a woman gets pregnant, the guy is likely to say, &#8220;how do I know it&rsquo;s mine?&#8221;. Of course we have DNA testing, but that&rsquo;s beside the point.</p>
<p>In the Pre-pill Period when sexual restraint was more the norm, and a guy was reasonably sure the child was his and would reluctantly marry and often for his own good. In the long run, I believe we guys have been the losers for the family life we sacrificed for easy sex. That&rsquo;s why the women&rsquo;s movement succeeded without a shot fired because men understood an opportunity for easy sex.</p>
<p>I understand that Black males have several times more testoserone level than White males, but I&rsquo;ve always wondered about Black females? I suspect by their behavior it must be a somewhat high T-level? That could partly explain their reproductive behavior. </p>
<p>Qwerty, you&rsquo;re technically right that even non-reproductive females have their genes passed on by relatives, but like those blondes mentioned in a previous Amren article, their genes are becoming rarified. I haven&rsquo;t read Fukuyama yet, but I did read Lionel Tiger&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Decline of Males&rdquo;. I was read it for discussion of the pill, but I don&rsquo;t think he stressed it&rsquo;s impact and barely mentioned it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a youngish man at 30, and I can say the same thing about most Western, modern-day, younger women.  They hate men, they think we&rsquo;re all sexist (especially white men), and these women just want to use their looks and lead guys on to get what they want, they&rsquo;ll only date men with lots of money, they want just sex, they don&rsquo;t want a relationship (&#8220;I&rsquo;m happy being single!&#8221; they say) and so forth</p>

<p>  Yes, but if this is the case, why are so many women imitating men in the same &#8220;belligerently irresponsible&#8221; behavior? I think of the &ldquo;milk bottles&rdquo; who travel to Africa and the Caribbean.<br>

<p>Thanks for the correction. I should have said several percent rather than several times. The range goes from about 3% to 20% with probably Black males under 25 on the high end. If the human body does average about 5 liters of blood. The younger White male would have about 100 nanograms to the Black 120. </p>
<p>If White males have about a 10-1 ratio of T-level to females, then a young Black female might have 12 nanograms per liter.  In that case, I wouldn&rsquo;t think that White male libido is comparable to Black female as I speculate above? </p>

<p>Actually, if I&rsquo;m not mistaken the most recent research shows no difference.  But, I didn&rsquo;t read it, just the headline, and it&rsquo;s likely the difference in androgen receptor levels (which translates into &#8220;effective testosterone&#8221; if you will) remains.</p>

<p>And the post-menopausal sex-tourist matrons from the U.K. would be seeking men in China (great male-to-female ration there too), not sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

			<p>I would love to have Michelle Duggar&rsquo;s &#8220;golden eggs&#8221;!  Unfortunatly we can&rsquo;t have kids.  So we are trying to adopt&hellip;.a White child I may add.<br>
The Duggar family is a very good example of a wholesome, God-fearing Christian family.  YOu can see that they have instilled morals &amp; values in their kids.<br>
I wish more people would follow their example &amp; maybe this country wouldn&rsquo;t be in such a rut.  <br>
The only critisim I saw in the comments (a quick overview) were people complaining about the girls wearing dresses/skirts.  What is wrong with girls dressing modestly?  Even the boys were dressed decent.  Isn&rsquo;t anyone tired of seeing young men &amp; ladies dressings like trash?  Be glad that some parents have instilled their kids to dress modestly.<br>
This family is probably much better off then most of us in our everyday lives.  God bless them all!!!  </p>

Even without the theocratic overtones, this &#8220;quiverfull&#8221; movement is ludicrous.  We don&rsquo;t need our nation&rsquo;s population to hit 500 million or a billion.  300 million is enough.  Keep all nonwhite immigrants out.</p>

			<p>I think that it is wonderful news, and I wish the entire Duggar family every happiness in the world. If my husband and I had met when we were young, we would surely have had at least ten children. As it is, we are the proud parents of three kids who are all under the age of three. I find it very stressful at times, and I admire the Duggars for sticking with it. It is clear that they were meant to be the parents of such a large brood. </p>
<p>The key is to find a man who shares the same goals and values, and who loves you enough to weather the tough times. Children are a blessing, but it&rsquo;s not all wine and roses. There are many honorable men out there, but you must be what you wish to attract. I was 34 when my Prince Charming finally showed up (finally!), so single girls needn&rsquo;t fret. Your time will come.</p>

			<p>If the Duggar kids were in public school, the girls might be teased about their clothes, but as they are home-schooled and appear to have absorbed their parents&rsquo; values (from what I have seen on TV,) I doubt that they are crying themselves to sleep over wearing dresses instead of jeans.  The only thing that made me cringe was watching the kids help build the family&rsquo;s new home.  The girls either should have been wearing jeans &amp; T-shirts, or they should NOT have using power tools, IMHO.</p>
<p>There was a news piece a while back about couples in China using fertility drugs EVEN THOUGH they didn&rsquo;t have fertility problems.  This is because China fines you for having a child from a second pregnancy, while if you can have quintuplets with the first pregnancy, you are not fined.  The Chinese women were taking a fertility drug that cost about $5 or $10 a cycle, and since the women using the drug were NOT infertile and were generally in their 20s, they probably got pregnant on the 1st to 3rd cycle.  This might become a usuable technique for middle-class Americans.  Have two sets of triplets eighteen months apart, and Mom stays home until the younger set is six or eight years old.  It would be murder when they kids were tiny, but far more efficient than spreading them out and paying day care fees for one child at a time.</p>
