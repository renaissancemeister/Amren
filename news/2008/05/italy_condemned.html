<h1><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7423165.stm">Italy Condemned for &lsquo;Racism Wave&rsquo;</a></h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Human rights group Amnesty International has said it is extremely alarmed by what it calls a &#8220;climate of discrimination&#8221; in Italy.</p>
<p>The Italian section of the rights body said recent tough new immigration measures were a worrying trend.</p>
<p>It added that politicians from both sides of the spectrum were legitimising the use of racist language.</p>
<p>Last week, Italy&rsquo;s new centre-right government introduced a series of measures aimed at improving security.</p>
<p>Illegal immigration will become punishable by up to four years in prison, it will be easier to expel illegal immigrants and there will be a three-year prison sentence for using minors to beg for money.</p>
<p><b>Attacks on Roma</b></p>
<p>But the head of Amnesty International in Italy, Daniela Carboni, said the moves represented &#8220;heavy restrictions and new crimes that will target, above all, immigrants&#8221;.</p>
<p>She said the organisation was particularly worried by the measure that would mean attempted illegal immigrants could be held for up to 18 months in a detention centre.</p>
<p>&#8220;Amnesty International is extremely alarmed both by the contents and haste of these measures .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and by the climate of discrimination which preceded them,&#8221; Ms Carboni said in the report.</p>
<p>There is deep suspicion throughout the country of the Roma community, whom many Italians blame for a disproportionate amount of crime.</p>
<p>In mid-May Italian police were forced to intervene to protect Roma Gypsies who came under attack from local residents in Naples, who set their camps alight.</p>
<p>Ms Carboni urged the Italian government to investigate fully the torching of the two Roma slum communities.</p>
<p>In April&rsquo;s national elections the centre-right coalition led by Silvio Berlusconi &mdash; which includes the anti-immigration Northern League and the post-Fascist Alleanza Nazionale &mdash; swept to victory, pledging to tackle illegal immigration.</p>
<p>In Rome, Gianni Alemanno, also of the Alleanza Nazionale, was elected mayor on a pledge to expel 20,000 people.<br>

if Italy didn&rsquo;t have any immigrants in the first place.</p>

<p>Italians can generally be trusted about all &#8220;White&#8221; groups to take the White side.</p>

			<p>The Italians are reacting in a sensible and moral way to the &#8220;racism wave&#8221; currently bearing down upon them. I&rsquo;d support the League of the North and Berlusconi if I could legally do so.</p>

<p>The Marxists at Amnesty want to see all global wealth redistributed, and is counter to the Marxist agenda. </p>

			<p>What did Italy expect when their birthrates are one the lowest in the world? If they TRULY want to solve the problem of unwanted immigrants, HAVE MORE CHILDREN. If you don&rsquo;t, then the elites will continue to bring in third-worlders to do the work.</p>

			<p>I commend the Italians for their courage, pride and commitment!! Hopefully, this will influence other European nations to stand up for themselves!</p>
<p>I grew up in Cleveland,Ohio and Little Italy was the safest neighborhood in town. You NEVER saw a minority there and blacks still drive through quickly with their windows up and doors locked&hellip;It was well known the paisanos had their own way of dealing with troublemakers&hellip;</p>

			<p>(from the article): <i>Illegal immigration will become punishable by up to four years in prison, it will be easier to expel illegal immigrants and there will be a three-year prison sentence for using minors to beg for money.</i></p>
<p>Why imprison the illegals (with the taxpayers footing the bill) at all? Just expel them immediately, after confiscating whatever property they may have had. Use military cargo planes or cargo ships to transport them cheaply and with minimal comfort.</p>
<p>Also note that weasel word &#8220;Roma&#8221; to describe the Gypsies again.</p>

			<p>Why don&rsquo;t these &ldquo;human rights&rdquo; clowns EVER go to South Africa or Zimbabwe? <br>
Why don&rsquo;t they also go to Saudi Arabia or Kuwait? I also suggest the U.S. nationalize all of the foreign interests in the U.S. as the Arabs did in their countries. U.S. citizens cannot own property in most foreign countries but those citizens can buy property in our countries.</p>

			<p>The Marxist stooges at Amnesty International are a fifth-column bent on achieving Marxism&rsquo;s stated aim, the destruction of Western Civilisation. We have many Marxist politicians in the EU countries. But, thank God, Italians have seen the light concerning these nation-wreckers &amp; have had enough, &amp; almost since the advent of Communism, no Marxists in their various guises  are in the present Italian parliament. May this trend become as popular as pizza throughout the Western nations.</p>
<p>Viva Italia<br>

			<p>Amnesty International is a genocidal Bolshevik type group.  They are from the same mold as the Nazis in many ways - only that the Nazis practiced open genocide while Amnesty International creates genocide against whites but covertly.</p>

<p>I hope so!  No one ever voted to give Amnesty International power in any sovereign nation.  They are led by Marxists who have the one world utopia aim.  Aside from the impossibility of such a utopia, they seek to give power to those for the purpose of corrupting various societies and cultures.  Out of that they think a pure socialism will emerge.  Nonsense, only a new dark age will occur.  In the end, all nations have to learn how to regulate themselves successfully.  Neither the U.S. government, the UN, or Amnesty International can teach people how to government themselves by coersion and international courts.</p>

			<p>Amnesty international is only concerned with keeping non-whites comfortable, and fat and sassy in white countries. They never complained when white farmers in Zimbabwe were being slaughtered for their land. In fact, their only input was to critisize world leaders for not doing enough to improve the situation for blacks there today. </p>
