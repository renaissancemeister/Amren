						<p>{snip} Racial slurs, particularly fueled against Hispanics, has found a home on right-wing radio, which claims 91 percent of radio airwaves. The nation&rsquo;s leading Hispanic advocacy group, National Council of La Raza, launched a campaign earlier this year decrying right-wing radio for its &#8220;rhetoric that demonizes immigrants and Hispanic Americans.&#8221; &#8220;Talk like Savage&rsquo;s, or Limbaugh&rsquo;s or O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s, has become routine, even systematic, and certainly a big business. {snip} Progressive radio host Mario Solis-Marich wrote Tuesday, &#8220;As a member of the largest minority ethnic group and a member of the media, I am continually puzzled and outraged by the idea that anyone can say anything about Latinos without fearing any consequence.&#8221;</p>
<p>DEMAGOGUING IMMIGRATION: A study by the Project for Excellence in Journalism found, &#8220;Thanks to energetic opposition from Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, and Michael Savage, immigration was the biggest topic, at 16%, on conservative talk radio in the second quarter&#8221; of last year &mdash; when conservative radio led the effort to defeat congressional comprehensive immigration reform, largely by resorting to fear and hatred. Radio host Neal Boortz urged listeners to help defeat &#8220;this illegal alien amnesty bill&#8221; and &#8220;yank out the welcome mat.&#8221; {snip} CNN&rsquo;s Glenn Beck, who also has a radio show, took particular issue with Sen. John McCain&rsquo;s (R-AZ) support for the immigration bill (though McCain has since changed positions), deriding the senator as &#8220;Juan McCain.&#8221; Beck called McCain&rsquo;s support for the bill and the fact that his national director of Hispanic outreach was of Mexican background &#8220;an audacious slap in the face.&#8221;</p>
<p>A &lsquo;RACE WAR&rsquo;: {snip} Discussing a pro-immigrant parade in L.A., O&rsquo;Reilly said, &#8220;So now, it&rsquo;s becoming a race war.&#8221; O&rsquo;Reilly also accused supporters of immigration &mdash; &#8221;who hate America .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. because it&rsquo;s run primarily by white, Christian men&#8221; &mdash; of seeking &#8220;to change the complexion .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of America.&#8221; These hatemongers have made clear their primary concern: maintaining a white majority. Just this year, Fox News&rsquo;s John Gibson gave &#8220;a big round of applause&#8221; on his radio show to the &#8220;non-Hispanic white women&#8221; who were having babies, which he said vindicated his call on &#8220;the dominant, or largest population sector, which is Caucasians,&#8221; to &#8220;make more babies.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>HEALTH SCARE: Right-wing radio hosts have also &mdash; wrongly &mdash; claimed that illegal immigrants should be kept out of the United States because they bring strange diseases in. O&rsquo;Reilly agreed with a caller into his radio show who said that illegal immigration &#8220;surpasses the impact of 9/11&#8221; because &#8220;each one of these people is a biological weapon.&#8221; The caller claimed that that &#8220;illegals crossing the border&#8221; are bringing &#8220;tuberculosis, syphilis, leprosy.&#8221; O&rsquo;Reilly agreed, and said there was &#8220;an absolutely airtight case&#8221; that more Americans &#8220;have either been killed or injured, based upon the 11 million illegals who are here,&#8221; than died on 9/11. {snip}<br>

					<p>It&rsquo;s good to know these bigots are whining, but I doubt that they have much clout with anybody.</p>
<p>This is just another indication that non-whites&rsquo; only desire in coming to this country is to take over and push whites out of their native land.  They don&rsquo;t want equality.  They want power and domination.</p>
<p>Just another radical anti-white org that needs to be added to the list.</p>

Why it should have taken <span class="caps">SIX </span>people to write (or perhaps copy/paste) this boilerplate antiwhite nonsense about &#8220;hispanics&#8221; baffles me, but just for the record, here are their names: </p>
<p><br>
Faiz Shakir, Amanda Terkel, Satyam Khanna, Matt Corley, Ali Frick, and Benjamin Armbruster</p>
<p><br>
Please note this team of mestizo defenders sounds 50% middle-eastern (and/or black), 50% anglo (and/or black), and <span class="caps">ZERO PERCENT </span>hispanic. </p>
<p>Draw your own conclusions. </p>
<p>Also, their claims that &#8220;right-wing radio claims 91 percent of radio airwaves&#8221; is preposterous on its face. It doesn&rsquo;t claim anything close to 91% of the AM band, and virtually <span class="caps">NONE </span>of the FM band. So these authors are either liars or morons or both. <br>

					<p>&ldquo;These hatemongers have made clear their primary concern: maintaining a white majority. Just this year, Fox News&rsquo;s John Gibson gave &lsquo;a big round of applause&rsquo; on his radio show to the &lsquo;non-Hispanic white women&rsquo; who were having babies, which he said vindicated his call on &lsquo;the dominant, or largest population sector, which is Caucasians,&rsquo; to &lsquo;make more babies.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I would ask these hopelessly hate filled Marxist &ldquo;authors&rdquo; of this ludicrous report, what do you feel is so wrong about maintaining a white majority? Just what is it in your &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; agenda Comrades: Faiz Shakir, Amanda Terkel, Satyam Khanna, Matt Corley, Ali Frick, and Benjamin Armbruster, that requires the white majority be reduced to simply a large but still shrinking minority by 2025? These are particularly burning questions, considering that so much of your insanely radical agenda (from population control to verdant ecomania) is tabled, so as to achieve it. Is &ldquo;diversity&rsquo; so much more important, that even Mother Earth must be sacrificed for it Comrades?</p>
<p>After all, America and Americans are said to be the world&rsquo;s most avaricious consumers of declining resources. We currently only have a replacement population level of 2.5 children on average; white Americans being among the lowest in the pack, at about 1.8 children on average. Thus, by adding &ldquo;new&rdquo; Americans, be they the &ldquo;holy undocumented&rdquo; or otherwise, does seem to be defeating that purpose. Certainly, had there never been a single &ldquo;migration&rdquo; of them to this country, we would only be at a population of 245 to 250 million today and not 305 million, or better. </p>
<p>But of course, an America of 245 or 250 million would still be 81% to 79% white, and not the current 65% or less. Hence, we must conclude that &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; is so important, it is worth destroying the white majority in the <span class="caps">USA, </span>even if it means the planet is destroyed also.</p>
<p>Moreover, you are so frenzied in the pursuit of &ldquo;diversity,&rdquo; that you forget it is a &ldquo;strength&rdquo; and &ldquo;enrichment,&rdquo; that perhaps you are greedily forgetting your higher social and global responsibilities for. This is doubly troubling, since could not these &ldquo;talented and hardworking&rdquo; nonwhites be better serving their &ldquo;developing&rdquo; homelands? Is not their eagerness to become &ldquo;Americans,&rdquo; an admission of equally deplorable monetary and consumer gluttony on their part, that reflects your own misguided lusts in importing limitless &ldquo;diversity?&rdquo; </p>
<p>Perhaps, this dichotomy in thought, which is clearly clouding your collective judgments, is why you ever so eerily include the erratic drug fiend Rush Limbaugh and the equally racially nebulous Sean Hannity in your list of patriotic &ldquo;hatemongers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

					<p>It&rsquo;s a legitimate concern on the part of the non-hispanic peoples who are voicing their anger and opposition to the hispanicization of the <span class="caps">U.S. </span> I imagine if Whites were pouring into Mexico illegally, transforming the very fabric of their society, demanding English be spoken, sapping up resources, costing taxpayers money, and the like, we&rsquo;d hear the same rhetoric.</p>

<p>Gee, that&rsquo;s funny.  People can say any wicked things they like about whites without fearing any consequences.  In fact its a proven way to get tenure in our college liberal arts departments.</p>
<p>It sure is interesting how Hispanics are now our largest minority group.  Maybe that&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;ve been invading our country in huge numbers for the past few decades, and having too many kids once they get here.  It is usually the case that the native people of a country have a low opinion of invaders.  That this is an invasion is not the figment of our imagination.  Mexicans openly boast about creating Atzlan via La Reconquista.  There are increasingly many municipalities in this country where you can&rsquo;t get a government job without speaking Spanish.  Why shouldn&rsquo;t we object to that? </p>
<p><i>Right-wing radio hosts have also &mdash; wrongly &mdash; claimed that illegal immigrants should be kept out of the United States because they bring strange diseases in.</i></p>
<p>&#8220;Wrongly?&#8221;  They are quite correct.  Illegals have brought into our country Chaga&rsquo;s disease, leprosy, tuberculosis, and no doubt many other diseases. <br>

<p>&#8220;Have we not the right to favor our own people over the swarms of foreigners that come here and demand equality, and even preference? <b> YES WE DO!</b></p>

					<p>Are the blockheads at La Raza aware of the anti-white racial epithets routinely used by radical Latinos who protest on behalf of illegal immigration?  Of course they are, but they condone the racism of their own people.   </p>
<p>Criticism of illegals by Limbaugh, <span class="caps">O&rsquo;R</span>eilly and other neo-conservative media types is milquetoast at best.  They oppose illegal immigration on legal, and not racial grounds and all are 100% in favor of our anti-white and anti-American legal immigration policies.  Occasionally, <span class="caps">O&rsquo;R</span>eilly lightly touches on the dangers this all poses for white people, but usually gets off the subject in a hurry.  Rush worships economic prosperity and the theory of trickle down economics and thinks all non-whites who live a middle class existence are closet conservative Republicans.  </p>
<p>The minions at La Raza are free to return to Mexico anytime, but life is too cozy to leave.  Besides, this country can never have too many minority race baiters.</p>

					<p>I&rsquo;ll keep it simple. All nations including ours have the right to borders, culture and language. Nobody wants to assimulate today, they just bring their invading cultures with them. There is no room for a multi-cultural society in America. Either assimilate or get out.It&rsquo;s also interesting that all these folks run out of their countries as quickly as they can and then get hear and expect us to adopt to their ways.You want to fly a mexican flag, speak spanish &amp; celebrate toco de mayo day then head south and don&rsquo;t let the door hit you in the backside.</p>

					<p>What is wrong with the current majority wanting to remain a majority?  It is the right of the majority to set general directions for the nation.  We have heretofore been imperfect, but self critical enough to strive to attain the ideals expressed in our founding documents.  If we chose to maintain a majority position in the body politic, it is our right.  We still strive to give more and correct more wrongs than any nation ever.  </p>

					<p>It&rsquo;s really sad that virtually 100% of the liberal-Left in the US is totally behind this mad illegal alien invasion of our land. I&rsquo;m a Leftist and a member of the Communist Party <span class="caps">USA, </span>and I want all 20 million of these illegals the heck out of my country. Not now, yesterday. At the very least, illegal immigration is implacably hostile to US workers, especially the working class. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have anything against Hispanics, and properly and judiciously chosen, they should be no problem than any other non-refugee legal immigrants. The whole problem is that they are completely non-screened. Australia and many other nations have rigorous criteria for immigrants - they make them prove in a grueling process that they will benefit and not harm the land they are coming to. We would do well to mimic this wise policy. Your nation is your home. My front door is well-screened, and I choose very carefully who gets in. Ought to be the same way with immigration. Mass illegal immigration is like leaving your front door open and inviting scores of strangers into your home to do whatever they feel like doing while you don&rsquo;t wave a finger to stop them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s absolute madness.</p>
<p>I also think that Whites have a right to be proud, like any other race. For this harmless <span class="caps">POV,</span> I am continuously vilified as some kind of Nazi and a couple of stores have threatened to ban me for making comments like that. Why must we Whites hate ourselves? We are not bad people! I look in the mirror and like what I see. I like my people and our history and culture. This makes me a Nazi?!</p>

					<p>David T, Mexico, a failed state, fails to collect about 85% of the taxes it is due. For all intents and purposes, the largely White ruling class pays just about zero in taxes. You guys may think that these White Mexicans are your brethren, but they really are the enemy. They refuse to share even one penny of their fortunes with the whole rest of the country and deal with it by exporting the 90% non-elite of the nation to the <span class="caps">US.</span> Great people!</p>

					<p>Even if they primary concern of &#8220;hate radio&#8221; (which is the furthest thing from what it is)is keeping a white majority, how is this any different from the explicit comments made by Mexican celebrities, politicians, and LA <span class="caps">RAZA </span>groups when they brag about how Mexico and Mexicans will determine the course of the United States. At least whites have the excuse that the nations founding, progress, and greatness was due to the European values they built the nation up with. What is wrong with wanting to preserver this? How is this hate? Should Mexico change from being distinctly Mexican? </p>

					<p>&#8220;Racial slurs, particularly fueled against Hispanics, has found a home on right-wing radio, which claims 91 percent of radio airwaves.&#8221;</p>
<p>91% of what?  The waves themselves, the photons, the wavelengths?  If it&rsquo;s wavelengths, then certainly that&rsquo;s unfair to AM radio, since it is measured in kilohertz, and FM is measured in megahertz.</p>
<p>Of course, it could actually be 91% of all stations, but how would that work?  Would a radio station with a radius of 10 miles count the same as a radio station with a reach of 30 miles?</p>

<p>Blacks use the same logic. If a school is majority white, the school must be made black; which includes hiring black teachers and administrators. If the school is majority black, it must remain a black majority and that includes hiring more black teachers and administrators. Once it goes black, there&rsquo;s no going back.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s non-white logic.<br>

All three leading candidates for president have stated they would reimpose the &#8220;fairness doctrine&#8221; This would kill off talk radio. None of the candidates are friends of the consitution This is the kind of action that these race baiting &#8220;progressives&#8221; would like to have take place.

<p>&#8220;Largetst&#8221; minority ethnic group.  So, you should pay attention to them because of their numbers, because soon they will be the largest group period.  But they are angry because we are now.  So, when its good for them they are a minority, then, the largest minority, then, the largest group period. </p>
<p>I have extensive experience with Latin America, and the two principle features of their peoeple are&hellip;</p>
<p>1 - Immaturity</p>
<p>2- Corruption</p>
<p>Psychologists say that dysfunctional families are&hellip;</p>
<p>Chaotic, Confused, and Corrupt.  </p>
<p>They are either one or all of the above.  See John Bradshaws &#8220;Creating Love&#8221; for a detailed study (and simply apply it to these clowns). Forgive him some of the corny parts and some of the shameless PC pandering (this was the late 80&rsquo; early 90&rsquo;s) which I&rsquo;m sure he <span class="caps">HAD </span>to do in order to be published at all.</p>
<p>It is but a step from dysfunctional families to dysfunctional cultures. And, in an age when &#8220;Culture&#8221; is bathed in this mystical, magical aura, we should begin to examine them all, East, West, North, South, Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hispanic, Black, White, Gay, Straight, from <span class="caps">THIS </span>perspective.  </p>
<p>And we should be a Power of Example and begin with ourselves. If the <span class="caps">USA </span>is dysfunctional, and it obviously is, then one reason lies in its willingness to become the worlds whipping boy.  That is <span class="caps">NOT </span>a healthy way to live, and it will solve no ones problems.  We have simply <span class="caps">GOT </span>to get this Corrupt, Chaotic, and Confused Hispanics and their Cheering Section in the Press <span class="caps">OFF OUR BACKS</span>!</p>

<p>Also, what is wrong with hating the invaders?

Those of us that object to drug dealers, murderers, rapists, thieves, terrorists, child molesters, scam artists and other criminals that cross our borders every day while loading up our jails, sucking the budgets dry of once thriving cities with all the freebies that American citizens don&rsquo;t get while refusing to speak our language and draining the health care system while the American tax-payer pays for all their illegal babies, somehow we have no right to object to all that. Oh! I forgot to mention the millions of tons of trash that illegals leave at the borders of property owners and in our state forests.  Oh! gee I forgot to mention how the illegal alien drug dealers set fires to our once beautiful National Forests simply to divert border agents to another area so they can smuggle their drugs. Not to mention the diseases the illegals bring and on and on. <br>

					<p>Talk Radio is one of the few places less regulated by the PC liberals (the other being the internet), and it needs to stay that way. Considering how much hatred towards white men, lies, and political poison they put out in tv, movies, schoolbooks, newspapers, etc- there needs to be somewhere where people are still allowed to have their constitutional freedom to question what is being said and done.</p>

<p>That he worked to elect now-State Sen. Jeff Smith is not surprising.  Smith is an uber-liberal, however, what&rsquo;s strange is that he hinted that he might vote for anti-immigration bills in the Missouri State House.  Smith is white, and his district is heavily black.  </p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more surprising is that Khanna worked on Claire McCaskill&rsquo;s Senate Campaign.  If Khanna is signing an article denouncing &#8220;anti-Hispanic bigotry,&#8221; then he should note that Claire McCaskill actually wielded influence to stop &#8220;Comprehensive Immigration Reform&#8221; last year, and tried to stop the big business shill Julie Myers from becoming the head of <span class="caps">ICE. </span> CMcC is certainly more vociferous and strident on the anti-amnesty issue than the Republican incumbent she defeated in 2006, Jim Talent.</p>

					<p>Hello <span class="caps">HD.</span> I vote Democrat. I&rsquo;m also a member of the Green Party. I was thrown out of the local <span class="caps">CPUSA </span>chapter for supporting social democracy, but that&rsquo;s just capitalism. They also said I&rsquo;m not a real Communist. I&rsquo;m a modern neo-Commie like the Vietnamese, Raul Castro, the Chinese <span class="caps">CP, </span>the Lao <span class="caps">CP,</span> Hugo Chavez, the Maoists in Nepal, the Sandinistas. We&rsquo;re all allowing a lot of capitalism these days and a lot of us are even supporting various amounts of democracy.</p>
<p><span class="caps">CPUSA,</span> I think, like the entire Left, is open borders pro-immigration. You can&rsquo;t be a leftwing or even liberal party or movement in the US anymore and oppose immigration or even want to regulate it in any way.</p>
<p>My main concern is economics. I&rsquo;m a socialist. Obviously, I would not be happy in any party on the Right. But it really annoys me that there are no socialist parties out there talking a sane stance on immigration. There is a movement out there called National Bolsheviks that is pretty interesting, but it frightens me with fascist leanings.</p>
<p>Since my main project is economic, obviously I want to see the US move in a Left-liberal direction. The downside to this is the the entire US Left-liberal movement is Open Borders, which to me means the end of this great nation.</p>
<p>I am starting to wonder if it is internationalism that needs to be chucked. All Left parties are internationalist. What that means in practice is that you can&rsquo;t really oppose any workers anywhere on Earth &#8220;migrating&#8221; to this or that country looking for work or better pay. You can&rsquo;t favor your own workers over those  of Mexico, because all the workers of the world are one nation. This is classic doctrine right out of Marx, but maybe we need to chuck it.</p>
<p><span class="caps">OTOH,</span> I don&rsquo;t really like nationalism either. I prefer something  like patriotism or citizenism.</p>
<p>There really isn&rsquo;t any party for me out there and it&rsquo;s lonely in that sense.</p>
<p><span class="caps">CPUSA </span>was the fastest growing party on the Left from 1980-1990. I think it went from 10,000-50,000. It&rsquo;s still a very small party and has little to no influence or much of anything. They recruit <strong>very</strong> heavily among Blacks and Hispanics, like all US <span class="caps">CP&rsquo;</span>s. Their economic project is pretty reasonable and they have always supported &#8220;Bill of Rights Socialism&#8221; as Gus Hall called it. What that means is that due to the long tradition of civil liberties in the <span class="caps">US, </span>the <span class="caps">CPUSA </span>has to respect that and all full civil liberties as part of their project. They do have close ties with the Chinese CP though. I&rsquo;ve spoken to some of the top members of the party.</p>
<p>You have to understand that <span class="caps">CPUSA </span>is much more Old Left than New  Left. They were very close to the <span class="caps">CCCP </span>in the <span class="caps">USSR, </span>and that was a socially conservative party.</p>

<p>Only rich people are required to pay income tax in Mexico. The government owns all subsoil resources, and that&rsquo;s where most of its revenue comes from. Pemex is a huge cash cow that&rsquo;s just about been milked dry, as the Cantarell Field recently peaked a few years ago. </p>

<p>It would be nice if we little people had the power to do so, but the fact is, we don&rsquo;t. Not even close. Too, it&rsquo;s not only the Left that are internationalists, so are the economic free-marketers in the Republican party. They&rsquo;re all for unfettered free trade with almost anyone on the planet.

					<p>I have never and will never hire a non-white immigrant to work on my farm! I have five full time employees that are paid very well and I have no problem finding extra white workers when the need arises. If I contract an out side business to do work for me I will put it in the contract and make it very clear that if they show up with a Mexican crew that the contract is null and void. If I can do this and still operate at a profit, why can&rsquo;t everyone else that operates a business?</p>
<p>The biggest problem I see with others crying that they can&rsquo;t find white workers is a simple thing called greed. I have invested over $2.5 million in equipment and technology in the last ten years to keep from having to hire puddle-jumpers and it has paid me back tenfold and the combines, the planters and the automated milking machines don&rsquo;t sue me when I do something they don&rsquo;t like and they don&rsquo;t get drunk every night and call me to bail them out of jail&hellip;&hellip;greed and illegal criminal aliens will be the death of America!</p>

					<p>      From a labor point of view, all illegals are scabs. They<br>
inevitable bring down wages. That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re brought in. How<br><br>
can you negotiate with companies if you have no leverage-the abi-<br><br>
lity to strike? Illegal immigration takes away that leverage. <br><br>
That many of the big unions support these people just shows how<br><br>
ridiculously corrupt they are. They have no reason to exist any-<br><br>
more now that they&rsquo;ve betrayed their workers. You can&rsquo;t help ev-<br><br>
eryone all at once. You need a closed system in order to create<br><br>
force. This is the principle behind the combustion engine- a con-<br><br>
troled explosion. Illegal immigrants release the pressure and<br><br>
thus no protest &#8220;work&#8221; can be accomplished. That explains why Che<br><br>
Gueverra used to alert authorities to any illegals he knew about.</p>

<p>Marxists are the same the world over. Always infiltrating other parties. One party aint enough for these socialist brothers, they gotta hog three or four. Don&rsquo;t you worry yourself, Comrade Lindsay, do what all radical socialists do, form your own socialist party. The perks are great &amp; you get to wear a snazzy outfit just like Fidel.</p>
<p>&#8221;CPUSA, I think, like the entire Left, is open borders pro-immigration. You can&rsquo;t be a leftwing or even liberal party or movement in the US anymore and oppose immigration or even want to regulate it in any way&#8221;  Robert Lindsay</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a radical idea. Do you think that possibly the people that are doing the above restricting are maybe of the Left &hellip; Communists even. After all the Left are the people working throughout the world for one-world government &amp; have been working towards it since the advent of Communism.</p>
<p>Why would anyone in their right mind listen to a party that was funded by a foreign power [USSR] for 60 years &amp; continued to deny this right up to the collapse of the same <span class="caps">USSR</span>?</p>

<p>Just one point. I think that you are too narrow in your indictment of just immigrants for the death of America. You cannot omit the out of control, murdering, raping, robbing, looting and generally sociopathic Black males who constitute a sizeable segment of the Black male population as a whole.</p>

					<p>To Robert Lindsay, regarding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Leftist and a member of the Communist Party <span class="caps">USA, </span>and I want all 20 million of these illegals the heck out of my country. Not now, yesterday. At the very least, illegal immigration is implacably hostile to US workers, especially the working class.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just wondering, are you not the Red who once made the absurd claim that the <span class="caps">USA </span>did not have a white majority until the late 1800s?</p>
<p>How ironic if this is the case, since you did seem to at least be making the case for untrammeled Third World &ldquo;immigration&rdquo; of all kinds in that piece of anti-white hate screed. You seemed to be indicating the usual rubbish about how we are the world&rsquo;s &ldquo;country&rdquo; and not our own. Also, your admission that you are a member of the CP  &mdash;  USA is equally curious as well.</p>
<p>Have you not grasped that Marxism as you know it is dead, outside of the history and philosophy departments in most Western universities? Multiculturalism is the new dialectical shimmy of the day, if you have not noticed. That, and if you accept the new Chinese model of Communism, slave labor by the many for the benefit of the few in toy and textile sweatshops. </p>
<p>Just wondering where you are coming from, Comrade Lindsay?</p>

&#8220;I have never and will never hire a non-white immigrant to work on my farm! I have five full time employees that are paid very well and I have no problem finding extra white workers when the need arises. If I contract an out side business to do work for me I will put it in the contract and make it very clear that if they show up with a Mexican crew that the contract is null and void. If I can do this and still operate at a profit, why can&rsquo;t everyone else that operates a business?</p>
<p>&#8220;The biggest problem I see with others crying that they can&rsquo;t find white workers is a simple thing called greed. I have invested over $2.5 million in equipment and technology in the last ten years to keep from having to hire puddle-jumpers and it has paid me back tenfold and the combines, the planters and the automated milking machines don&rsquo;t sue me when I do something they don&rsquo;t like and they don&rsquo;t get drunk every night and call me to bail them out of jail&hellip;&hellip;greed and illegal criminal aliens will be the death of America!<br>

&hellip;First, bless you all and all that you do for doing it the American way! I live in California, and the answer to immigration is automation (of course, with automation comes an <span class="caps">INFERRED </span>reduction in overall population and thus immigration as labor is less of a requirement or demand!). In fact, it was said in the 1990s that when the perfected strawberry picking robot was invented, the agg labor from Mexico would begin drying up permanently. Only now, it is not agg jobs to be had by the invaders&hellip;.I see sixty year old mezzos with their 40 year old sons mowing lawns like an American fifteen year old would have done as a career inducting practice so common in America prior to the 1980-90s. This holds triple true for any fast-food jobs as well, where Americas next workforce was once expected to cut their future workforce teeth!</p>

					<p>There would be no hate/discrimination involved if Hispanic American citizens identified with Americans instead of Mexican invaders! And since they are entering illegally without screening - yes they are totally responsible for exposing Americans to disease and crime. Corporations want cheap labor both illegal and with visas. This means the supply is great, demand is down, and the American worker has no leverage for wages. They also want free trade so that the job can be done cheaply elsewhere and shipped into the country without tariffs. If Democrats get national health care - it will be a &#8220;right&#8221; and of course these &#8220;rights&#8221; can&rsquo;t be denied to illegals. We&rsquo;ll be forced to pay into insurance for <span class="caps">EVERYONE </span>- companies won&rsquo;t have to pay for employees. The health &#8220;budget&#8221; will go broke every year, so forget needing medical attention after summer&hellip;</p>

					<p>I post here nearly every day, and advocate wiring and mining the border.  Only about half my posts make it past the editor.  Even <strong>I</strong> do not hate Hispanics.  I was in prison for three years, most of that time in Texas, and the Mexicans were about the nicest, most generous guys there.  If a white guy was straight with them, and got into trouble, they would <strong>all</strong> come running to help.  One of my friends was doing a dime for running marijuana.  He used to share a cigarette with me while wtalked about places we&rsquo;d been.  One of his grandfathers was a white county sheriff. </p>
<p>If one counts Portugese Brazil as &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; and leaves out Argentina, I find 19 Hispanic nations in the Western Hemisphere&rsquo;s mainland.  As for their partly Amerind ancestry, <strong>I</strong> am 3/16 Amerind so I suppose with my grey eyes, fair skin and brown hair, I&rsquo;m a &#8220;Mestizo&#8221; too, but with different European and different Indian ancestry.</p>
<p>If middle-class Mexicans with values similar to mine wanted to legally immigrate to my country, I would have no problem.  I do not believe that my country should be a dumping ground for the world&rsquo;s poor.  I don&rsquo;t hate Hispanics; I just don&rsquo;t want their poor and criminals here.</p>

					<p>To Michael Scott: Time for some studies. Hispanics are divided into 2 vast groups - group  A, an assimilated group that is doing great and acts like you and me, and group B, an Underclass that is an utter screaming nightmare. The latter tend to be the children of immigrants, often illegals. The former tend to have much deeper roots. The latter are often darker and the former lighter, but there are no hard rules.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s make Hispanic immigrants submit to rigorous and grueling processes to run the gauntlet to get into this still-fine land. Make them renounce any claim that Mexico owns the southwest. Order them to learn English. Force them to prove that they will join group A and not group B. Do studies to try to figure out which will join group A and which will join group B.</p>
<p>The notion that even 85% of legal Hispanics are de facto traitors for supporting Open Borders and their illegal invader brethren is painful but correct.</p>

					<p>A few things here:</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t care much about race at all. My positions on Hispanics closely mirror those of Michael Scott. As a native Californian, I grew up with these people. They were our friends, best friends and girlfriends (or mine anyway). I was taking Spanish classes at age six. We have been to Mexico many times. I had 5-6 years of Spanish in school. Our mothers learned to cook great Mexican food and we love Mexican restaurants. This state used to be part of Mexico. The streets, cities and geography have Spanish names. </p>
<p>As far as why a Leftist like me turns against the illegal invasion, you guys don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like. We feel this invasion <strong>in our bones</strong> in a way that the rest of you cannot understand. Look at the paragraph above for the Spanish/Mexican roots of this place. On the ground here, it feels like a <strong>reversion</strong>. It&rsquo;s downright terrifying for any sane White person.</p>
<p>To John PM: I still say that my people are not the majority founding stock of this land, and that Blacks, Mexicans and Amerindians are part of the founding stock. <span class="caps">FWIW.</span> Of course that doesn&rsquo;t follow that we need Open Borders insanity to let 2 billion 3rd worlders flood in and turn the US into Calcutta of the Americas. Australia, Japan and many other decent countries have sane immigration policies. Why not us? If we act like them, we are racist? <span class="caps">WTH</span>?</p>
<p>Marxism is not dead at all. All of the wealthy countries of the world have socialism to one degree or another going on. The Chinese model is much misunderstood. Indian capitalism kills 4 million a year by not following the Chinese model in 1949. Also they could have controlled their population. China is going too far, but most enterprises are still owned by the workers ultimately. Secondarily, they are owned by municipalities and labor collectives. Almost all housing is state-owned. </p>
<p>Most govt decisions are undertaken with the interests of the majority in mind. It&rsquo;s really just a gigantic and confusing mixed economy with vast amounts of socialism in it. Most of the economic growth coming out of Chinese-owned firms is coming out of the non-capitalist sector (worker-, municipality- and labor collective-owned firms). The media never tells you this because  that would smash their whole &#8220;socialism doesn&rsquo;t work&#8221; lie.</p>
<p>Cultural Marxism is garbage. These ppl have given up on class struggle in the interest of gender, race, sex orientation and other identity politics. The Old Left and its regimes were quite socially conservative. You can make an excellent case that the <span class="caps">USSR </span>and E Europe was better for Whites that the Cultural Marxism of W Europe and the <span class="caps">US. </span></p>

<p>The question is not &#8220;land&#8221; but &#8220;nation,&#8221; namely the United States. Apart from a very few free blacks, not one of these groups had a thing to do with the founding of this nation. There were no Mexicans in the US at all in 1776 (and the nation of Mexico did not exist in 1776), and black slaves and Amerinds were not citizens. I know that the Census of 1825 belies this contention, but I&rsquo;m willing to run afoul of bogus, manufactured data. Whites are the sole founding stock of the <span class="caps">US.</span></p>

					<p>Recall, that to the elites who think it only reasonable to have world government, that the age of the nation state is over, all talk of immigration restrictions is nonsense; after all,  do not all human beings have a plethora of international, supranational human rights as expressed in multiple international agreements, most signed by the US?  If so, then they have a right to live in whatever &#8220;country&#8221; they like and those who oppose immigration to the <span class="caps">US, </span>be it legal or illegal, are barbarians.</p>
<p>This is the logic of their argument.  It is the same argument that was used by Lincoln and the radical Republicans in 1861 when they launched a bloody war of conquest against the South.  Why?, because the South did not recognize that we had moved beyond the provincialism of confederated &#8220;states&#8221; and had finally achieved the level of the nation state.  Those who object to the unconstitutional notion of a dominant central government will have their homes and families destroyed, their country invaded and themselves put to death at the point of a bayonet.</p>
<p>There is a great deal of similarity between today&rsquo;s supra-nationalist elites and the nationalist elites of days gone by  &mdash;  -universalism and centralization as the central principles of the state.</p>

					<p>&#8220;I am starting to wonder if it is internationalism that needs to be chucked. All Left parties are internationalist. What that means in practice is that you can&rsquo;t really oppose any workers anywhere on Earth &ldquo;migrating&rdquo; to this or that country looking for work or better pay. You can&rsquo;t favor your own workers over those of Mexico, because all the workers of the world are one nation. This is classic doctrine right out of Marx, but maybe we need to chuck it.&#8221; (Posted by Robert Lindsay at 6:40 PM on May 10)</p>
<p>This is extremely important. One question is what kind of economic system a people will have, and a separate question is whether or not that people will maintain themselves as a people, whatever economic system they have. </p>
<p>That the second question, &#8220;will a people maintain themselves as a people,&#8221; is an important one is borne out by the feeling you said you have in your bones. No fancy intellectual argument is needed to support the proposition that a people should strive to maintain their identity as a people  &mdash;  this is something that humans just naturally do, when not impeded, as much as eating and loving.</p>
<p>But for reasons historical or ideological, &#8220;All Left parties are internationalist,&#8221; as you say, and the persons who have been most instrumental in pressing collectivist economic theory upon the world have also succeeded in overriding, in the white countries, this natural impulse of a people to maintain its identity. </p>
<p>So of course internationalism should be chucked  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s an unnatural thwarting of the natural human impulse to cluster with one&rsquo;s group, and has been imposed by people who profit from it financially and regard any human instinct that doesn&rsquo;t put money in their pockets as an unprofitable diversion of human energy. </p>
<p>(Ah, that last part felt good  &mdash;  I&rsquo;ve missed my old lefty days!)</p>
<p>It should also be said that the urge of peoples to maintain their own identity should be catered to not simply because that urge is a universal human desire, but also because, it still existing as a universal human desire, it must certainly have had evolutionary survival value. That that is indeed the case is strongly indicated by just looking at what is happening in (formerly) white countries everywhere, now that that group survival urge has been overridden.</p>
<p>A chief impediment to whites recapturing their expression of this fundamental urge (which all other ethnic groups in the world still retain) is that they are blocked by the word, &#8220;racism.&#8221; Whites are now called &#8220;racist&#8221; at any sign of their having the same group feeling that all other groups feel and express freely. (In our own country, just listen to other groups&rsquo; talk, and look at the names of their organizations).</p>
<p>And whites have been trained (and this didn&rsquo;t &#8220;just happen,&#8221; but that&rsquo;s another topic) to feel that there is nothing more shameful than to be racist. That is, there is nothing more shameful than to feel and express the same attachment to one&rsquo;s ethnic group that all other ethnic groups in the world now and in the past feel and have felt without shame.</p>
<p>A very, very bizarre mental hammerlock has been placed upon us.</p>
<p>Robert, I&rsquo;ve followed many of your posts here with interest for sometime, and I suspect you&rsquo;re still in that hammerlock, that you can&rsquo;t quite bring yourself to give up the feeling of being &#8220;virtuous,&#8221; and deal with the shaming, that will be directed your way if you give up the struggle to be &#8220;good,&#8221; and just go with that natural human feeling of group survival you feel in your bones.</p>
<p>I hope you&rsquo;ll forgive me for addressing you in that manner  &mdash;  it is done in a spirit of friendliness, and with full realization that I might be completely mistaken in my impressions of you.</p>
<p>You also write, &#8220;There really isn&rsquo;t any party for me out there and it&rsquo;s lonely in that sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>Believe me, there&rsquo;s plenty of us (as you no doubt notice) that feel we fit nowhere, and are lonely. That&rsquo;s to be expected in a society that&rsquo;s disintegrating.</p>
<p>Fifty years ago, when I was living in Alabama, I fit in and I didn&rsquo;t feel lonely. I was living in a functioning society then.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the thing.  They can&rsquo;t assimilate, as they are a different people.  They&rsquo;ll only blend in when America becomes that of nothingness: no identity other than a racial mix with no dominant majority.</p>
<p>Different races can&rsquo;t assimilate, for assimilation is related to feelings of sameness and togetherness.  These &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; don&rsquo;t see nor feel like they are the same, nor do white Americans see them as such, so they&rsquo;re not going to assimilate.  It&rsquo;s impossible for different races to assimilate.  Only people of the majority race can, over-time, assimilate.  Hence, this is why all the Europeans were able to assimilate, and still are. <br>

					<p>To Comrade Lindsay:</p>
<p>Your capacity for doublethink and doublespeak is certainly in keeping with your Red ideology. To begin with had it not been for the British establishing the 13 Colonies, there never would have been a United States of America; they (the English colonists) were the unifying cultural, political, and socioeconomic force that is primarily responsible for establishing this country. The &ldquo;Native Americans&rdquo; would not even be calling themselves this had it not been for white development of this country, because they would remain most likely to this day disunited warring tribes such as the: Cherokees, Creeks, Choctaw, Apaches, etc. As for blacks they contributed next to nothing and Mexicans played absolutely no role whatsoever, in founding this country. To say otherwise, demonstrates a tenable hold on history and reality, that is at best pitiable.</p>
<p>We agree on immigration to a point, but I would hold that all Western colonial nations such as the <span class="caps">USA </span>and Australia, should stick to very racially oriented immigration policies as the Japanese do. In short, this view is summed up as whites only; we owe utterly nothing to: Asians, Latinos, Africans, Arabs, or any other Third World rabble you can think of. The strict controls of the early 1900s would not begin to illustrate, just how firm and reactive our laws should be toward the flood of so-called refugees and migrants, that are allowed to enter this country. They are of no value to this nation, and contribute nothing but resource depletion, overpopulation, and social chaos to the <span class="caps">USA.</span> Much what they contribute in their home countries, but here I digress.</p>
<p>As for your absurd and obtuse positions on Communism, what else is to be expected from an admitted Red? You can make your arguments about the glorious land of Mao, but you have yet to emigrate there. Why might that be? Perhaps, it is the knowledge that 100s of millions have died there since 1949? And if I am not mistaken, you are in your 50s and easily could have moved to the Soviet Block in the 70s or 80s; why didn&rsquo;t you? Maybe it is the knowledge that 10s of millions were murdered under those Bolshevik butchers?</p>
<p>As for the &ldquo;socialism&rdquo; and mixed economies of the West, how much of that foolishness would be needed, if &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; was progressively removed from these countries? Certainly there would be some &ldquo;social programming,&rdquo; but it would be nothing like this abhorrent &ldquo;redistributive&rdquo; model where whites provide their opportunities and resources, as appeasement to the nonwhite &ldquo;entitlement&rdquo; automatons.</p>
<p>What this country needs (and all the West for that matter) is a return to economic and social freedoms for whites, with nonwhites being allowed only such freedoms that they can handle or deserve. If they do not like it, they always have the same freedom that you do; that is, move to China or Zimbabwe where Marxism breeds a quality of life unknown in all of human history, and for good reason!</p>

					<p>&#8220;Recall, that to the elites who think it only reasonable to have world government, that the age of the nation state is over, all talk of immigration restrictions is nonsense; after all, do not all human beings have a plethora of international, supranational human rights as expressed in multiple international agreements, most signed by the US? If so, then they have a right to live in whatever &ldquo;country&rdquo; they like and those who oppose immigration to the <span class="caps">US, </span>be it legal or illegal, are barbarians.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
from UN Declaration of Human Rights:</p>
<p>Article 13.<br>
(1) Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state. <br><br>
(2) Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country. </p>
<p><br>
Article 14.<br><br>
(1) Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution. <br><br>
(2) This right may not be invoked in the case of prosecutions genuinely arising from non-political crimes or from acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations. </p>
<p><br>
Article 15.<br><br>
(1) Everyone has the right to a nationality. <br><br>
(2) No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his nationality nor denied the right to change his nationality. <br><br>
