						<p>An indoctrination program that was shut down at the University of Delaware last year after it was revealed the teachings included, &#8220;All whites are racist,&#8221; now is being revived, and an organization monitoring such educational behavior is concerned there will be violations similar to those of a year ago.</p>
<p>Adam Kissell, a spokesman for The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, told WND his worry is that this year&rsquo;s &#8220;program&#8221; for incoming students at Delaware has the same &#8220;learning outcomes&#8221; as a year ago, the same administrators are running it, and components appear simply to have been renamed, instead of changed.</p>
<p>WND reported a year ago when a series of teachings mandated for all residence halls told students &#8220;all whites are racists.&#8221;</p>
<p>FIRE had written to university President Patrick Harker about its concerns, including its worries that &#8220;somehow, the University of Delaware seems terrifyingly unaware that a state-sponsored institution of higher education in the United States does not have the legal right to engage in a program of systematic thought reform.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that time, Samantha Harria, FIRE&rsquo;s director of legal and public advocacy, suggested, &#8220;The First Amendment protests the rights of freedom of conscience .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the right to keep our innermost thoughts free from governmental intrusion.&#8221;</p>
<p>She cited a school teaching that told students: &#8220;A RACIST: A racist is one who is both privileged and socialized on the basis of race by a white supremacist (racist) system. &lsquo;The term applies to all white people.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Students came forward &#8220;in droves&#8221; in 2007 to complain, FIRE said, also citing concerns over indoctrination about homosexuality and environmentalism.</p>
<p>Under the program documentation revealed then, student managers of residence halls were told to summon students for one-on-one questioning during which they were instructed to respond to questions such as: &#8220;When did you discover your sexual identity?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kissell told WND today FIRE is concerned that some of the labels may have been changed in the program, but the underlying indoctrination plans remain.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He noted that Harker, in his announcement earlier about the controversial program, said it was being suspended and officials would work together on making changes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;These are the same people who called the program a &lsquo;treatment&rsquo; for students who ResLife has tagged as morally and ideologically deficient,&#8221; [Kissel] wrote in an analysis of the work.</p>
<p>Of special concern are the &#8220;conversations&#8221; that are between student residence hall managers and students, Kissell said.</p>
<p>&#8220;What will the oversight be? Will RAs know not to ask invasive questions? Will they be instructed to focus on diversity and tolerance and sustainability, or will they genuinely listen and respond to what each student actually wants to talk about?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

Epiphany! You student idiots! You just answered their subscription drive! They wanted you to come forward&hellip; in droves&hellip; to complain. What they want to do with you now is open to debate, but you just showed your hand. As well as  who you are. And  where your emotional handle is located.</p>

What a definition of convenience! Automatically exempts minorities from a word with an automatically bad connotation. Reputable dictionaries tend to define &#8220;racism&#8221; as below:<br><br>
&#8220;1. The belief that race accounts for differences in human character or ability and that a particular race is superior to others.<br><br>
2. Discrimination or prejudice based on race.&#8221;   &mdash;   American Heritage Dictionary.<br><br>

&#8220;WND reported a year ago when a series of teachings mandated for all residence halls told students &ldquo;all whites are racists.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
If all whites were racist, then it stands to reason that we whites would <span class="caps">NOT EVEN ALLOW </span>anti-white indoctrination programs to exist. The very fact that this kind of anti-white nonsense is permitted   &mdash;   and carried out mostly BY <span class="caps">WHITES </span>  &mdash;   is proof that the entire program is based on a maliciously false assessment of the white character. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, did I say &#8220;stands to reason&#8221;? Silly me. I referred to an obsolete white concept called &#8220;reason.&#8221; <br>

					<p>If whites weren&rsquo;t so afraid of criticizing policies that are discriminatory and denigrating towards them, and rightly complained as any other group would do, this entire anti-white mantra from all quarters would come to a screeching halt.</p>
<p>But, as it is, whites feel too intimidated to even call a violent act against them a racist one, when it clearly is.</p>

I hate petty lawsuits based on political intimidation but it seems as if we&rsquo;re going to have to fight fire with fire for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>I believe a strong argument could be made that such programs endanger, threaten, intimidate, and otherwise present a very real hostile and dangerous environment for white students.</p>
<p>If they go ahead with this program and a white student is attacked in any way, the family will have an easy win in court.</p>
<p>Frame the argument that way and watch the university fold.<br>

					<p>Many posters here have said, in effect, &#8220;we need to fight back&#8221;.  You are all correct - this needs to be nipped in the bud.  But talking about it won&rsquo;t help, and as we can see, appealing to public opinion hasn&rsquo;t helped much, either.  Suing might help, but the courts aren&rsquo;t very sympathetic, either. Your enemies, as you can see, are relentless.</p>
<p>As a resident of South Africa, which was just one lost battle in the course of a much bigger war, it terrifies me to see how the war is being lost in exactly the same way. If America is lost, we are all lost.  You dare not lose.</p>
<p>Please, I beg you, read this article. Spread it around.  You don&rsquo;t have much time left.</p>

<p>It needs to be fought in the banks. Hit them at the altar of the one thing they worship with religious zeal: their bottom line.</p>
<p>Or even better, don&rsquo;t send our kids there. Deprive them of an enemy, and they will begin to feed on themselves (witness the Shrillary vs. Obambi soap opera).</p>

					<p>I think this hardens the view that whites are superior since only they can be &#8220;racist&#8221; and they can overcome this while the other races being like the pleasant natives in those first contact stories.  Of course it would be fun to hear some self hating white person declare that whites are untermensch.  I&rsquo;m sure that person could quote the storytelling Jared Diamond about the mean palefaced mudpeople who conquered a planet with germs and guns.</p>

<p>The best minds at Delaware think they need to be intimidated some more. Perhaps some more &#8216;immigrants&rsquo; could help with that too? </p>

					<p>Whites are not inately racist by nature of being white. This is a behavior acquired by association with certain ethnic groups. Orientals are accorded a high degree of respect among many whites. This is because they work hard. raise famlies where both parents are present and view government handouts as demeaning. Some other minorities well, their actions tell the whole story. Some minorities would suck the white race dry these days because they aren&rsquo;t smart enough to fend for themselves. Instead they choose to commit wholesale murder, robbery, larcenly &amp; rape upon each other.</p>

					<p>Here lies the truth, racism is not in and of itself inherently evil, rather a fact of nature bestowed upon all creatures great and small. It can be seen manifest in the makeup of every living breathing being on earth. Often referred to as the survival of the fittest, or the preservation of all species of life form. Those who are against their ilk are doomed to extinction.</p>

					<p>I know the term &#8220;racist&#8221; has eeeeevil connotations, but if Jared et al are correct, then it is natural to be &#8220;racist,&#8221; no? Logically, anything that paints a whole group of people as such, while malicious in intent, can only lead to greater racial awareness across the board, which will help our cause immensely.</p>

					<p> Whites in Delaware already talk and act just like the blacks. Might as well write that state off. Its the first state but i wonder what state it is in non white states. Starting to add up fast with the government help. Anybody have any nos. to the lost states. What cracks me up is the blacks say the government is against them. Are they kidding?</p>
