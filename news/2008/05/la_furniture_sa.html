						<p>A New Orleans furniture salesman pleaded guilty Tuesday to spying for the Chinese government and providing Beijing with secret information on military relations between the U.S. and Taiwan.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Tai Shen Kuo, a naturalized U.S. citizen with prominent family connections in Taiwan,] pleaded guilty to a single count of espionage in U.S. District Court in Alexandria. In court papers, Kuo admitted that he received $50,000 from the Chinese government for his efforts.</p>
<p>Kuo provided the defense analyst, Gregg W. Bergersen, several thousand dollars in gambling money on trips the pair took to Las Vegas, as well as promises of employment at a company Kuo hoped to establish. Bergersen, of Alexandria, Va., pleaded guilty to his role in March and faces up to 10 years in prison.</p>
<p>The information Kuo obtained from Bergersen included updates on Taiwan&rsquo;s new Po Sheng or &#8220;Broad Victory&#8221; air defense system, which is a key part of Taiwan&rsquo;s defenses against a possible attack by China. He also received projections of U.S. weapons sales to Taiwan over the next five years.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A third person charged in the case, Chinese national Yu Xin Kang, who allegedly acted as a go-between for Kuo and Chinese agents, is in jail awaiting trial.</p>
<p>Kuo&rsquo;s guilty plea &#8220;is the latest demonstration of the serious threat posed by international espionage networks,&#8221; said Patrick Rowan, acting assistant attorney general for national security.</p>
<p>In 2006, former Pentagon intelligence analyst Ronald N. Montaperto was sentenced in Alexandria to three months in jail for unlawful retention of classified documents after admitting he had contacts with two Chinese intelligence officers from as early as 1983 and as recently as 2001.</p>
<p>In February, former Boeing Co. engineer Dongfan &#8220;Greg&#8221; Chung was arrested in Los Angeles and charged with stealing military and aerospace trade secrets regarding the space shuttle and other programs on China&rsquo;s behalf. He has pleaded not guilty.</p>

			<p>With each passing year of my life the whole American experiment - the uber-pluralistic utopia, melting pot, etc. - seems to make less and less sense. Of course, this country&rsquo;s founders could never have imagined the path we have taken, in opening the country&rsquo;s front door to not only every possible variety of disparate human beings, from every corner of the globe. But now, we hardly seem to care that our own way of life is threatened, our laws challenged, our culture(such as it is)torn asunder and calously replaced, our history denigrated, etc&hellip;and this is from the immigrants - it doesn&rsquo;t matter of they are legal or illegal - most Americans have WELCOMED into our midst by the tens of millions!! How could we not see how this was going to end up? What kind of &#8220;nation&#8221; is made by nothing but a polyglot hodgepodge of dubiously compatible nationalities?<br>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t know that these people can rightly be called &#8220;naturalized Americans&#8221; since they took the oath of allegiance in bad faith.  They are, of course, sent here from China for this purpose.  I could see that China, like Mexico, would like to dump its numerous  peasants on the U.S., but why would they send us their educated people?  Good people are the greatest resource that any nation has, why export them?  The only benefit to China is if these people exploit us on China&rsquo;s behalf, which is what we see here.  At a minimum, we need to deport all Mandarin speakers and their offspring.  We could sort through the Cantonese and other pre-1900 Chinese later.</p>

			<p>You, Americans, will not believe me. Yet, some years back the late colonel Houthorn, said, that if we have 50,000 Chinese in the USA, we have 45,000 spies. I, who most of my life lived under the Communist government in Russia, say: the colonel was dead wrong. If we have 50,000 Chinese, we have 50,000 spies. I stay at every letter of  this statement, because I know how 8o-year-old grandmothers work for intelligence.<br>
Chinese engineers, dont confuse with Japanese, without Russian help couldn&rsquo;t built a toaster. 99.9 percent of knowledge China has now is stolen, mostly from the USA.<br>
And, it is a point for a special article the real harm is much-much-much worse.</p>

			<p>The behavior of the Chinese comes straight from their culture.  Our ancestors who had first contact with them understood this.</p>

			<p>Is there really anybody besides a zonked out leftist do-gooder who thinks by crossing the US border immigrants automatically  switch allegience to the US over their own country?</p>
<p>I mean, I KNOW what the politicos pretend.  But is anybody really dumb enough to expect these people will not show loyalty to their country of origin over this nation given a choice?</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Bergersen, of Alexandria, Va., pleaded guilty to his role in March and faces up to 10 years in prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laughable, bitterly laughable!</p>
<p>Comrade Bergersen the traitor, should be handed over to experts in &ldquo;information extraction.&rdquo; Then, he should be paraded around the country in a cage, to be spat upon and worse.</p>
<p>The ungrateful &ldquo;immigrant&rdquo; Comrade Kuo, should be introduced to even worse still.</p>
<p>And then China, should be introduced to 25 mushroom clouds and the subsequently black glassy craters that they once called &ldquo;cities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Enough said!</p>

			<p>Why don&rsquo;t the Chinese just wait it out?  Why risk rousing slumbering Americans?  With the trajectory America is on, they&rsquo;re sure to inherit the earth.  Sun Tzu must be turning in his grave.</p>
<p>Ranger, yes, there are <i>plenty</i> of people willing to believe three years is sufficient to accumulate undying loyalty to the US   &mdash;   not for nothing is the American boob known as the American boob.</p>

			<p>I wonder how many American professors, businessmen and engineers are spying for the US in China. How many Chinese, who go back to China after having studied in the US, are on the payroll of the CIA? Do you seriously think that the US is not doing exactly the same thing in China? <br>

<p>The quote, above, hit the nail on the head!  For example, would you expect an American who lives in China or Iraq for 5 years to side with their new country if war broke out?  If you had been living in Iraq for 5 years and in 2000, came across a downed &amp; wounded American pilot, would you hide him or turn him over to Saddam Husein? Why do you think that recent immigrants are any different?  Most hold loyalty to their old country and their race/religin, and this loyalty can continue for 2 generations.   </p>

<p>In response to the post (above):  Yes, but who is better at it, and who has profited from it?  China had nothing we wanted.  America possessed amazing technology that China wanted.  Although the West basically invented all of modern technology, we gave it away to China &amp; India for free.  In fact, our business leaders could not move fast enough to set up modern factories throughout the world, for a few Dollars profit.  We shipped 75 years of technology to those Third World nations, we pay for the factories, and bring management teams, and set up the entire process from management training to plumbing, and then, low-and-behold they outcompete us, causing the Dollar &amp; our economy to tailspin.  This is like teaching your pet pit bull to eat human flesh, and then leaving it alone with your baby.  We do the same thing with transfer of agriculture technology   &mdash;   look how Brazil and Mexico are now using our technology to produce cheaper crops.  We had the world in our hand, and basically gave it away.  Our children will suffer for it.  Who was it who decided to move American factories and knowledge overseas?  Traitors!</p>

			<p>Watch Saving Private Ryan, and consider how many strong and courageous European and American men died in World War II, taking their genes with them. The post war generations have been hedonistic weaklings, more concerned about pleasing minorities than about defending their lands from invasion.</p>
<p>At least Europe is being invaded by Arabs. Arabs maintained empires while Europe was in the dark ages and have backbone, unlike the purfumed dandies of post war Europe.</p>
<p>America has hispanics and blacks- you connect the dots&hellip;</p>

			<p>7:57 AM: How many Americans, aside from tourists, are in China?  Are there cities in China that have been repopulated with Americans, as we have cities dominated by Chinese?  Does China allow American professors, engineers and businessmen to become Chinese nationals and hold sensitive positions with access to technological and political secrets?  <br>
     As for Chinese students, about 90% of them  do not return to China after graduating.  Instead, they get jobs here that offer them a much higher standard of living that they&rsquo;ll ever have back home, and they move to one of those Chinese colonies where they can be among their own kind.  When China chooses to permit these people to come here, they know that most of them won&rsquo;t be coming back, and they expect to benefit in other ways.  The only reason to allow their people to study in the U.S. is to place them in positions where they can help out the mother country.  </p>

			<p>Dear Vercingetorix&hellip;.I agree with you a hundred percent&hellip;my family (all of whom were born in the states,,,after their parents immigrated the right way through Ellis Island) fought in the WW2, Korea, Vietnam&hellip;ect&hellip;all on the side of the country they loved&hellip;..THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA&hellip;many of our friends and family, did not come back alive&hellip;.but they paid the price for freedom, and what we have now in this country of ours&hellip;.is chaos&hellip;brought on by the morons who make the laws in washington and could care less what or who they let into this country.  It is not a melting pot&hellip;.this pot now of days, contains something that I cannot mention on this site&hellip;but you get the idea. </p>

			<p>In Britain. traitors and spies used to be hung or shot in the old Tower of London.  Should be the standard again throughout the West.  It is in countries like Russia an China.  Many spies rely on the fact that the West is too soft now.</p>

			<p>As for the Chinese graduate student business. China watches our every move. It knows what professors in what schools are teaching technologies that they want to acquire. China then sends graduate students to the USA with the precise mission to take classes with these professors. The goal is to become a Teaching Assistant and for a couple years take notes, make copies and send everything back to China. On graduation the Chinese student disappears back to China and a job in the military-industrial sector where he puts the knowledge paid for by American taxpayers to good use building weapons to, you guessed it, kill Americans.</p>

			<p>We are living in a delusional world where we accept anyone from around the world and expect them to care about this country as their home. We shouldn&rsquo;t be naturalizing everybody just because they pass a minor test. People need to be screened very carefully and watched which also means that there can&rsquo;t be too many immigrants. </p>

			<p>Just about everyone in america will tell you that sending west coast Japanese to internment camps during WWII was wrong, but that is only because they don&rsquo;t know any better. The Japanese had 3 factors that made it imperative to isolate them, their race, their religion and their national origin, anyone one of which justified questioning their loyalty, and the same is true today, they are no more american than I am japanese/chinese/israli. regardless if they passed a test or were born here, being an american comes from the heart, and they just don&rsquo;t have it and never will</p>
