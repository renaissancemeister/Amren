<h1><a href="http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=58&amp;aid=143231">The Messy Truth of Race, Rape, and Class</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Keith Woods, (Cleveland) Plain Dealer, May 13, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In her remarkable story, &#8220;Beyond Rape: A Survivor&rsquo;s Journey&#8221; Joanna Connors, a reporter at The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer, writes about her experiences getting raped. But the story isn&rsquo;t just about rape. It also addresses important issues of race and class.</p>
<p>The essential tension resides in a simple and explosive event, now 20 years old: A black man raped a white woman. The history of that potent narrative is packed with truth and lies, racist injustice and racial suspicion, cliché and mythology.</p>
<p>This story lurches powerfully into race in the first of five chapters, as Connors speculates that she might have run away in the awkward moments before David Francis attacked her had it not been for the fear that she&rsquo;d appear racist. A few paragraphs later, readers learn that the rapist taunted Connors, asking if she&rsquo;d fantasized about sex with a black man. That&rsquo;s a pretty raw entrée into race in what was already a bold step into another taboo.</p>
<p>Then things really get interesting. Connors tracks down Francis&rsquo; family and interweaves her story with theirs. As I followed her into the black and poor side of Cleveland, I found myself bracing. Would some misguided liberal guilt cause her to ennoble this man and his family, with their hard upbringing and harder lives, now that she&rsquo;d seen up close the truth of the country&rsquo;s racial and class divide? Would she stumble into stereotype or worse? Would this become part of a long list of bleeding-heart tales that end with, &#8220;and I found out these poor black people were just like me&#8221;?</p>
<p>No. No. And no.</p>
<p>{snip} I had a lingering question when I was done, which I sent to Stuart Warner, the editor who called my attention to the piece:</p>
<p>[Connors] spoke one simple truth that I think I&rsquo;d wanted to hear more about: That it was her desire to not appear to be a bigot that might most be responsible for the decision to go into that theater [where Francis raped her]. That&rsquo;s a much scarier racial truth, to me, than the more mundane, &lsquo;I found myself afraid of all black men&rsquo; truth that she was hesitant to speak. Because if white women &mdash; or white people in general &mdash; were to act on the first notion, that you question your racial motivations at your great peril, then in a way we&rsquo;ll encourage more acts of exclusion and outright prejudice.</p>

			<p>This reminds me of an article that was posted on AmRen not too long ago, the article about the British person who, despite being mugged several times by black thugs and nearly had his life taken from him, didn&rsquo;t learn a lesson: That blacks are inheritely more dangerous than whites.</p>
<p>I think the same will hold true for the rape-victim in the above article: Still out of fear of being &#8220;prejudiced,&#8221; she still won&rsquo;t protect herself in the future if a similar situation arises. Truely, the whole anti-racism madness must be a mental disorder.</p>

			<p>I would like to clue everyone here on a great  bestselling book, &#8220;The Gift Of Fear.&#8221; It teaches men and women to rely on their gut instincts and also teaches the basic ways that criminals glean their victims co-operation. Hurling accusastions of racism is one way that gets the perp just the amount of indecision  time needed to subdue the victim. The book opens with the story of a womans rape and where and how she went wrong at every avenue to avoid the ordeal. <br>
  One of the tactics criminals use that I recall is called &#8220;False Teamwork.&#8221; An example given is a woman waiting at the bus stop late at night. The thug in waiting walks up and says, &#8220;Looks like we missed the bus&hellip; What`ll WE do now?&#8221;  The correct reponse would be, &#8221; We are NOT together!! I have already called my husband, he will be here in minutes.&#8221; <br>
  The best part of the book was an imaginary rant  from a woman approached in an underground parking garage who lets the persistent helper in on why a woman in today`s world should show a healthy fear of strangers. . I`ll let you read that one for yourself. One last point the author made was how a person in danger is usually  more annoyed  or afraid at a stranger warning them that their behavior is putting them at risk then they are with the person that &#8220;accosted&#8221; them to begin with. Get the book and read it. It will change your life and might help save it.</p>

<p>And no.&#8221;</p>
<p>That is one helluva way for this poor White rape victim to find out an answer about Africans that most on here intuitively know like the backs of our hands.</p>
<p>Like every other victim of African rape, this woman will have this imprinted in her brain the rest of her life.  If only other White women can learn from her the easy way.</p>

			<p>&#8220;That it was her desire to not appear to be a bigot that might most be responsible for the decision to go into that theater [where Francis raped her].&#8221;</p>
<p>Merriam-Websters Online Dictionary defines &#8220;bigot&#8221; as:</p>
<p>a person obstinately or intolerantly devoted to his or her own opinions and prejudices; especially : one who regards or treats the members of a group (as a racial or ethnic group) with hatred and intolerance</p>
<p>Merriam-Websters Online Dictionary defines &#8220;prejudice&#8221; as:</p>
<p>(1) preconceived judgment or opinion (2): an adverse opinion or leaning formed without just grounds or before sufficient knowledge b: an instance of such judgment or opinion c: an irrational attitude of hostility directed against an individual, a group, a race, or their supposed characteristics</p>
<p>This lady obviously had an adverse opinion of the man who soon after raped her.  If she was afraid because he was black and they were alone in an area, her fear was not the result of prejudice (and thus she was not acting out of bigotry) because there is a RATIONAL BASIS for people to be suspect of black men in situations such as she described.  </p>
<p>See, e.g., the Uniform Crime Reports and the web page for the Bureau of Justice Statistics.  Young black men commit crimes of violence (homicide, rape, robbery, assault) at rates well out of proportion to their percentage of the population.</p>

			<p>I read the whole article; it&rsquo;s mostly rambling, especially towards the end. However, it does entail some importance. </p>
<p>Most White men need to straighten up. We need to protect our women when they are vulnerable; we need a spine. We must not allow our women to be manipulated by foreign races and race-traitors. It can be something as simple as a boycott. For example, Sports Illustrated presented pictures of Black men &#8220;playing&#8221; with the three best White models in the issue! We must boycott SI, and make a voice. </p>
<p>We, sensible Whites, male and female, must take back our own society. </p>
<p>(Sorry for the digression, but I am afraid an Obama presidency will increase the incidence of White women and Black men having sex and romantic relationships. But I am willing to look at other aspects of an Obama presidency (i.e. &#8220;Worse is Better,&#8221; etc.)). </p>

			<p>Raped by a black man because of a desire to avoid appearing &#8220;bigoted.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a perfect metaphor for what&rsquo;s been happening to our PC, multi-culti nation. Rape.</p>

			<p> &#8220;A black man raped a white woman. The history of that potent narrative is packed with truth and lies, racist injustice and racial suspicion, cliché and mythology.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed. The fact that millions of white women have been targeted for rape by black men is one of the greatest racial injustices of our time. Nobody, outside of AR, tells the truth about this crime. </p>
<p>Yet let a black woman even allege a gang rape by white kids at Duke and the media (and politicians, religious leaders, the academy and the law) goes into overdrive.</p>
<p>That is the face of racism in our time. Only AR has the nerve to tell the truth and speak truth to power.<br>

			<p>Articles like this always fill me with a range of emotions from sadness and rage, to simple and absolute disgust! This is the emodiment of the moral cowardice of modern White people; a symbolic molestation of not just the body, but the mind as well. This collective delusion regarding race, where truth means nothing, where dubious excuses pass for reason, where science, empirical evidence and rational thought are all stripped away or stood on their head&hellip;this is a willful psychosis! It&rsquo;s just disgusting to behold&hellip;is it any wonder we are in the state we are in as a people?    </p>

<p>The Black Panthers would rape White women and mock them the same way Connors was. I have read an interview of Eldridge Cleaver where he admits as much. Some would say that you really can&rsquo;t accuse a black man of rape because they do not understand the concept of rape.<br>

			<p>Well thank God this liberal dingbat escaped without appearing &#8220;racist&#8221;.  Getting brutalized and having to wonder what venereal diseases she might have caught is one thing, perhaps with some torture, too, before being stuffed into a garbage can and left to die, but the social stigma of being perceived as a &#8220;racist&#8221; would have been too much to bear.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s an awful convoluted &#8216;first notion&rsquo; for someone to have. Leave it to the Plain Dealer (Plain Lie) to turn a rape of a white woman into a scary exposition of racism, prejudice and stereo-typing - on the part of whites.   </p>

			<p>This is a good example of the very real harm that can come from the guilt conditioning that whites (and only whites) are subjected to in this country. Since the 1960&rsquo;s, our leaders decided that down is up, and that false is true. Perhaps they didn&rsquo;t all believe it themselves, but it was and is politically expedient for whatever purpose they chose to use it for. </p>
<p>This is a betrayal of our common sense, life experience, and instincts. I trust nothing if it comes from any &#8220;respected&#8221; establishment source in our society. The price of alienating the public is a justifiable distrust that the public feels toward its media, educational system, and politicians. The distrust is a scar, and the &#8220;respectable&#8221; establishment is to blame.</p>

			<p>  This is so stupid, it has to be true. What has society eroded to, when people will put themselves in danger of God only knows what just so they won&rsquo;t be viewed as racist? I think they should take him, or any other man, regardless of race, out to a public place and hang him. I guarntee that would start to deter alot of this kind of crime. We had better wake up soon and start defending our families, or they will all be victims of crime.</p>

			<p>[&lsquo;I found myself afraid of all black men&rsquo; truth that she was hesitant to speak.]</p>
<p>Since black on white rapes are so numerous wouldn&rsquo;t it be stupid of her not to fear any black man she might encounter, because of that?  I mean, it&rsquo;s perfectly natural to be afraid of going fast in an automobile after having a traumatic crash.  Getting bit viciously by a dog makes people a bit nervous around dogs, etc.</p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;m positive that black/white rapes would increase considerably if blacks had more access to white women.  Sorry, but there&rsquo;s every reason to believe that&rsquo;s a very true statement, judging from the numerous black on white attacks that occur every year.  If the situation evolves where more white women are available to blacks, black on white rapes will increase.</p>
<p>Also to be taken into consideration is that white women are far more attractive than black women, which I&rsquo;m positive is the main reason for black on white rapes, instead of black on black. And, of course this can be verified by the huge number of black men who reject black women in favor of fanatically pursuing white ones.</p>
<p>For any woman to put herself through some kind of racial trip for reacting naturally says a lot about her mental conditioning which has disabled her ability to consider the matter in a rational light.</p>
<p>Brainwashing gullible whites has resulted in more women getting raped and killed, and has placed many gullible whites of both sexes in danger of being killed.  A case in point is the kids who were lost in Flint, Mich., and naively walked up to a few blacks, asking for help and winding up raped, viciously assaulted, and some were killed, because Hollywood, the MSM, and academia has brainwashed them into believing blacks aren&rsquo;t predisposed to crime and anti-white hatred.  They were of the opinion only whites are racist, as they were propagandized to believe.<br>

			<p> The moral of the story; always trust your&rsquo;e initial gut instincts.<br>
  If she had acted on the sense of true danger that she sensed, she possibly could have escaped the attack. Instead she trusted in the lies she had been told, and it nearly cost her her life.<br>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve seen black men harass white women, calling them racist because they don&rsquo;t want to go out with them.  This is how most white women who end up dating or marrying blacks get roped into it, they&rsquo;re afraid of being called racist.  Only once have I seen a white woman look the black in the eye and say, &#8220;I don&rsquo;t date black men, period.&#8221;  My wife and I taught our daughter from an early age that it was completely unacceptable to date blacks, and she never did.  All it takes in most cases are parents who are willing to speak up, but so many parents are also afraid of being called racists.  It&rsquo;s pathetic.  </p>

<p>&#8220;[Connors] spoke one simple truth that I think I&rsquo;d wanted to hear more about: That it was her desire to not appear to be a bigot that might most be responsible for the decision to go into that theater [where Francis raped her]. That&rsquo;s a much scarier racial truth, to me, than the more mundane, &lsquo;I found myself afraid of all black men&rsquo; truth that she was hesitant to speak. Because if white women &mdash; or white people in general &mdash; were to act on the first notion, that you question your racial motivations at your great peril, then in a way we&rsquo;ll encourage more acts of exclusion and outright prejudice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Put simply, it&rsquo;s better to be a victim than a bigot. Even if it kills you. Liberal values 101. Leftism is based upon the idea of sacrifice as the pinnacle of moral perfection.</p>

Perfect anti-civilizational nihilism.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not easy to say that worst is best because there will be terrible suffering involved, but maybe an Obama presidency and the full flowering of black savagery is what it will take to wake whites from the fog of lies in which we wander to our doom.</p>

<p>  Another important thing for white women to remember is to beware elevators.  There have been attacks and rapes on these women for going into an elevator with a lone black man ( could actually happen with a degenerate white man, but not as likely).  If you find yourself in this situation, always act like you forgot something or have to go back where you were at, do not get on the elevator in a risky situation.  It happened to a number of white women in a big office building, where a black guy followed them on the elevator and then raped them, because they were alone.  And he was never even caught. We have to worry.</p>

			<p>  In this &#8220;multiracial&#8221; society we live in where we are pretty much forced into &#8220;integration&#8221;, it is very difficult to &#8220;protect&#8221; White women from contact with Black men, as has been suggested by some posters.<br>
   In this situation, any attempt by White men to pre-emptively protect White women from  contact with Black men would<br>
 surely be viewed as &#8220;racist&#8221; at best, at worst a &#8220;hate crime&#8221; wich may result in some form of legal prosecution.<br>
   This unfortunate situation means that the only recourse We  have is education. White women must be made aware of the dangers of who they may come in contact with. Not just for themselves, but for the future of the society at large.</p>

			<p>I truly mourn and lament the fate of the Anglo-Saxon people. For the most part other ethnic Europeans do not give quarter to blacks, nor do they feel sympathy for their manufactured &#8220;plights&#8221;. I notice Slavs and Mediterraneans know how to protect their neighborhoods and interests far better. <br>
I truly cannot fathom why Anglos, are abetting their own displacement. <br>
I do not believe this egalitarian lunacy would ever take hold in places like Russia, or Serbia, or Bulgaria, or Romania, or Greece, or Italy. Yet somehow American and Canadian and British Anglos are being manipulated so thoroughly that they lost all sense of pride and dignity - ironically they have the most reasons to feel pride!<br>
America is finished. Anglos will become a subject people in their own lands, kowtowing to abusive feral blacks. What other people in history have financed their own displacement? <br>
Have provided for an army of illegitimate black babies that will grow to become a de facto militant force, surrounding, soon to be unarmed, white enclaves? <br>
This article above is sickening, and is symptomatic of the much larger problem of the voluntary displacement underway. The way a woman can be conditioned to ignore her basic survival instincts is no different than the way an entire people can be conditioned to commit cultural suicide. <br>
I am not Anglo but I feel great rage when I fathom the gross injustice and subterfuge being perpetrated here.     <br>

			<p>Normally I am bothered by belonging to a special class protected by hate crime laws because I think that they are unfair.  However, I am not above taking advantage of the fact that I am a lesbian to get any black thug who attacked me charged with a hate crime for gay bashing.  That would be the only way to get anyone to see past the fact that I am a white person.  </p>
<p>I think too many women have been raped because they didn&rsquo;t want to be rude to a man who was up to no good.  </p>

			<p>The &#8220;good girl tape&#8221;.  That&rsquo;s amazing.  This girl writes her natural instinct was to avoid this black man on first sight.  But a tape recording in her head told her that would be racist.  I think that may be the answer to Jared Taylor&rsquo;s $64 dollar question:  Why are white&rsquo;s not working for white interests?</p>
<p>Answer:  Because white people have a tape recording playing in their head saying it would be racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, etc., if they don&rsquo;t behave in a certain way.  They&rsquo;ve been brainwashed.  Where did these tape recordings come from?  They are imprinted by the media:  movies, TV, music, classroom documentaries, popular culture.  Now the question is who created the tape recording?  Was it a deliberate attempt to change American culture starting in the 1950&rsquo;s?  Or was it random.  I think a combination of both.  </p>
<p>If this theory is true, our obvious goal must be to de-program white people and get rid of these tape recordings playing in their heads, and/or replace them with more healthy tape recordings.  Before the advent of television, all people alread had tape recordings playing in their heads.  These were the tape recordings imprinted by their parents and early childhood experiences.  But starting in the 1950&rsquo;s the television set replaced the parent.  Children watched many hours of TV everyday, long into adulthood and for the rest of their lives. </p>
<p>Now the process has gone to the next level.  Even if someone throws away their TV it&rsquo;s hard to free themself of racial delusions because they are living in a society where most everyone around them are brainwashed.  </p>
<p>I think this entire theory is the answer to the question people in the pro-white movement always ask:  Why are not more white people openly working for white interests?  </p>

There&rsquo;s probably a good deal of truth to that Edward. It&rsquo;s said this has been going on, especially in poor white area&rsquo;s, urban area&rsquo;s whites lived in, since the 1950&rsquo;s. Perhaps even longer. Perhaps since white and blacks have been in America. One could even say there&rsquo;s a one-sided access to white women, the kind the enlightened people must constantly Tell us happened during terrible evil times&hellip;</p>
<p>And yet each year 20,000 white women are raped by black men, while around 200 black woman are raped by white men, a ratio, adjusted for population, over 600 times greater, all the while us regular citizens must Learn about hate-crimes and injustices perpetrated by whites.  </p>

<p>As an armed self defense instructor, there is only one answer to this question; &#8220;Have you ever fantasized about a 38 bullet in the face?&#8221;</p>
<p>The same desire to avoid reality that prevented her from carrying a gun to defend herself is the same reality avoidance she felt and ignored to go into the theater in the first place. I have learned something here. Liberal idiots have the same warning feelings and instincts we all have (I&rsquo;m being stalked! or &#8220;I&rsquo;m in trouble!&#8221;) but they have decided to either ignore or disparage these feelings as &#8220;racial sterotypes&#8221;. Sometimes they are right and they feel superior for being better than the rest of us. Other times they pay the price and get raped or die.</p>

			<p>Here is some text from a response by University of Michigan professor Patricia Gurin to one of her critics:</p>
<blockquote>
In one class session, a white woman student who had grown up in a homogeneously white town in Michigan expressed, with considerable emotion, that she was tired of being categorized as white. &#8220;I&rsquo;m just an individual. No one knows if I hold similar beliefs to those of other white students just by looking at me. I hate being seen just as white.&#8221; She ended in tears. An African-American male student who had grown up in a virtually all white city in Connecticut replied as he walked toward her across the classroom. &#8220;I just want to be an individual also. But every day as I walk across this campus  &mdash;  just as I am walking across this room right now  &mdash;  I am categorized. No one knows what my thoughts are, or if my thoughts align with other African- American students. They just see me as a black male. And at night, they often change their pace to stay away from me. The point is  &mdash;  groups do matter. They matter in my life and (as he approached the other student whose hand he then took), they matter in your life.&#8221; There was silence in the room. The students learned about the meaning of groups and the meaning of individuals in a way that they won&rsquo;t soon forget. 
</blockquote>
<p>She adds (italics in original), <i>&#8220;I could not have taught this from a lecture. Real interaction with diverse others in a classroom makes this learning powerful and indelible.&#8221;</i> </p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the whole point and the whole problem&hellip;.</p>

   You know there was another terrible story that happened in some state ( can&rsquo;t remember where ), where a black thug posed as a meter reader and asked the white woman who was home alone to go with him to the basement to find the water meter.  He then beat her and raped her.  They will use alot of ruses in their never ending quest to get even with us.  Always ask to call a Utility company to verify the call, before letting them in.</p>
<p>   I had a minor incident happen around here a couple years ago where this group of blacks came around our neighborhood trying to sell vacuum cleaners .  When the one came up to me and asked if he could demonstrate the vacuum cleaner for me, I just said no.  His manager came up to us and said &#8221; What&rsquo;s the problem &#8221; to him. I just walked away and the other one told him &#8221; no problem &#8220;.  You have to watch all their games trying to attack us or force us to buy something.</p>

<p>I strongly agree, this is why I don&rsquo;t have altercations with africans:</p>
<p>Not only can a confrontation turn deadly with one of them, I do not have the right to defend myself, in this present age,  against a violent  attack if I had given a dose of reality to one of these retarded idiots before the assault commenced.  It&rsquo;s not that I am afraid of them. I am afraid of liberal white prosecutors who will cry discrimination provoked the attack and use the justice machinery full throttle to take your wealth and put you in prison for a steady diet of african rape 5 times a day, then look the other way while you endure torture.  I hate the traitors who use the dead weight of government to enforce this damn insanity.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;This article above is sickening, and is symptomatic of the much larger problem of the voluntary displacement underway. The way a woman can be conditioned to ignore her basic survival instincts is no different than the way an entire people can be conditioned to commit cultural suicide.&#8221; Posted by at 1:22 AM on May 16 </p>
<p>RK: That&rsquo;s exactly what this amounts to.  That says it in a nutshell. You have it right on. I&rsquo;d like to offer an expansion on that. </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no difference in a person inculcated with the tenants of political correctness and one indoctrinated with a fanatical belief in some far out cult theory that is hammered into their minds to the point where an individual&rsquo;s entire mental base can only evaluate and react to information that has been repetitiously pounded into his/her head, and he/she reacts automatically. Like Pavolv&rsquo;s lab dogs really.  If the proper stimulus is provided, the reaction will be a conditioned response.  </p>
<p>Look at the James Jones cult where almost a thousand people lined up to drink poisonous kool aid.  Or the one recently that fanatically believed that the mother ship would soon come to earth to take them to colonies on Jupiter.  </p>
<p>Politically correct brainwashed and conditioned adherents are almost identical to people in far out sects in so far as to how they have been repetitiously brainwashed into a particular ideology and accept it whole-heartedly, to the point of attacking anyone who dares to tell them what they believe is absolute nonsense.</p>
<p>Cult members will kill themselves and others, in many cases,  and do anything short of that, if those in control suggest or order that they do so, as we have learned from the above referenced examples.</p>
<p>Also, we know from news reports of numerous times politically correct fanatics have chained themselves together, fought with police, thrown excrement and molotov cocktails at authority and pies in the faces of conservative speakers or rushed the stage to keep them from speaking.</p>
<p>Psychologists/psychiatrists who specialize in techniques of deprogramming can effectively reverse those not too far gone.  But access to the subject is important.  Very few willingly opt for therapy.  Almost all of them have to be restrained, and some of them will try to kill even family members who are trying to help them. </p>
<p>I believe those indoctrinated with years of political correctness can involve people who are fanatically mouth-frothing cultists down to those just lightly effected; however, those in this affected group can&rsquo;t be restrained, of course, so some other means is necessary to reach them, which is why the problem will never be resolved short of armed conflict between the sick&hellip;.and their co-horts&hellip;. and the healthy, because the politically correct dominate the organs of entertainment, communications, and politics, just like in Europe.</p>
<p>Shock is the only way outside of therapy politically correct indoctrination can be reversed, as, for example, in a major limited tribal conflict where masses of people are shocked by seeing and experiencing stark examples of the harsh reality of the failure of political correctness, which could erupt as a result of a man-made or natural disaster:  The &#8220;Big One&#8221; in California, The Yellowstone volcano erupting, an economic meltdown, severe food and water shortages, to name but a few.  </p>
<p>Otherwise look for more of the same in years to come, as we continue towards a Brazil-type society with a clear delineation between the wealthy in gated communities and the poor who rule the streets.   </p>
<p>The answer to many will be guarded communities in remote areas of the country, set up as self-sufficient enclaves, until an implosion occurs, which may or may not affect them.</p>
<p>This evil cult of political correctness is far worse than Nazism or communism, and involves much darker omens of our degeneration than an example of the indoctrination of a raped woman, because it forces us to destroy ourselves from within, and allows its growing numbers of adherents to feel good about it in the process, because they&rsquo;re &#8220;doing the Lord&rsquo;s work,&#8221; so to speak, in the name of love and tolerance.</p>

<p>Where did you get these statistics? The latest statistics from the Dept. of Justice are for 2005 (as far as I know), in which year DOJ reports that 37,460 White women were raped by Black men, and  (&#8220;based on about 10 or fewer sample cases&#8221;) estimates that ZERO  &mdash;  that&rsquo;s ZERO! ZERO! ZERO!  &mdash;  Black women were raped by White men!:</p>

<p>Which didn&rsquo;t deter our national media from going into a frenzy about that ZERO Black woman that was NOT raped by White men  &mdash;  the Duke University non-rape, while ignoring the 37,460 White women that were raped by Black men.</p>
<p>THAT&rsquo;S ODD, ISN&rsquo;T IT???????? And please don&rsquo;t tell me that this was just a case of &#8220;man bites dog,&#8221; as opposed to &#8220;dog bites man,&#8221; news reporting  &mdash;  the Duke (non)rape was reported as being very much just another of the endless injustices and outrages committed by Whites against Blacks.</p>
<p>And prison rape has similar &#8220;proportions&#8221;, as reported by the lefty group, Human Rights Watch  &mdash;  scroll down to the section &ldquo;Race and Ethnicity&rdquo; at:</p>

<p>Thanks, Bobby  &mdash;  you&rsquo;ve given me another good response to the question, &#8220;Don&rsquo;t you think you&rsquo;re being racist?&#8221;</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;ll reply, &#8220;I don&rsquo;t use that word, because I don&rsquo;t agree with the agenda it represents.&#8221;</p>
<p>Its agenda of course is to block us from looking, seeing, thinking, or acting on the topics that are discussed on this site (violent black crime, destruction of schools and neighborhoods, the incivility of everyday life because of constantly expressed black hatred of whites  &mdash;  and whites&rsquo; cowering fear of acknowledging the reality of that hatred; the lowering competence of organizations  &mdash;  and discrimination against more qualified whites  &mdash;  due to affirmative action hires; etc. etc.etc.) and to instead remain in our trance and follow the hypnotic suggestions of media, academia, etc. to &#8220;perceive,&#8221; &#8220;think,&#8221; and act according to the false reality they present to us.</p>
<p>That false reality is the ridiculous notion that the most notable feature of race relations in the U.S today is Whites&rsquo; oppression of Blacks  &mdash;  &#8220;racism,&#8221; in other words. A phony word for a phony idea.</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;That is one helluva way for this poor White rape victim to find out an answer about Africans that most on here intuitively know like the backs of our hands&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>You brought up a very important point Annoyed:  Most of us here intuitively know about Africans due to years of first-hand unpleasant experiences around them in the workplace and in our communities. We here on Amren are steeped in DOJ statistics and articles about black-on-White crimes (that the MSM refuse to print)  &mdash;  some of us have been victims of black crime. </p>
<p>Certainly none of this vital information is being taught in the schools.</p>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t educate our children as to black predators with a &#8216;hunter&rsquo;s mentality&rsquo; who will?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s our young people, especially our young ladies, that I worry the most about.  They have been inculcated with a curriculum that explicitly teaches them that Whites are evil and blacks are noble and good.</p>
<p>Just yesterday, I drove my middle daughter and three of her (White and Asian) friends home from the local high school.  Next year all four of them will be going away to college.  I looked at them, young, happy, beautiful, naive, full of Marxist teachings of equality  &mdash;  not one weighed over 120 lbs., and wondered if Channon Christenson were the exact same way.  </p>
<p>What defense (or knowledge) do they have against black predators?<br>
 <br>
The girls&rsquo; topic of conversation was the AP US History lesson they&rsquo;d had for the past two days  &mdash;  Emmett Till, and how he had been hunted down and lynched &#8216;for doing nothing&rsquo; by racist, evil, White bigots who (to this day) populate the South, and how Till, an innocent child,  was The Catalyst for the Civil Rights movement.  Till, according to the teacher was a Noble Black Martyr, representing (still) out of control White violence directed at blacks (teacher is a young White Marxist, BTW).</p>
<p>Do you see what we parents of young girls are up against?</p>
<p>I have tried to talk to my daughter about the dangers of black men  &mdash;  going so far as to show her hard facts and statistics of black-on-White rapes (there are very few blacks in my community).  At the moment, she&rsquo;s having none of it  &mdash;  I suppose I should have started earlier.  I do not want my daughter or her friends  &mdash;  or any White girl for that matter  &mdash;  to become another black-on-White rape statistic, so I have a lot of work ahead of me. I hope other parents are warning their daughters as well.</p>
<p>Does anyone know:  Are blacks targeting Asian females as well?</p>

<p>Yes.  I believe the final stage of white racial awareness is religious/psychological.  In essence, one internalizes the fact that one is now sane, that the world is insane, and this constitutes abnormality.</p>
<p>In other words, sanity is abnormal.</p>
<p>It is here that one realizes that terms like &#8220;white nationalism,&#8221; &#8220;white racial awareness,&#8221; etc., are not only designed to communicate with the insane, but are themselves insane.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a shrink who has to play along with his patient&rsquo;s delusions in the short term to help him reach sanity in the long term.</p>
<p>Obviously, there could be another stage beyond this but I haven&rsquo;t seen any hint of it yet.</p>

			<p>Another important thing for white women to remember is to beware elevators. There have been attacks and rapes on these women for going into an elevator with a lone black man ( could actually happen with a degenerate white man, but not as likely). If you find yourself in this situation, always act like you forgot something or have to go back where you were at, do not get on the elevator in a risky situation. It happened to a number of white women in a big office building, where a black guy followed them on the elevator and then raped them, because they were alone. And he was never even caught. We have to worry.</p>

<p>This is a good post.  I would add, pretend like you&rsquo;ve just gotten a text on your cell phone, and learn how to text message yourself.  You can send yourself a text message on your own cell phone with descriptions of people, their license plate numbers, and other important information you will have right at hand if you need it later for the police.  And you can forward that message to friends.  Just beware; many criminals can&rsquo;t get cell phones, so they will steal them.  I personally wouldn&rsquo;t get on an elevator with very many men, period, and definitely not in a situation where I was the only woman.  That &#8220;Gift of Fear&#8221; book is a good one, too, except to me, it seems like &#8220;Fear&#8221; is a short word for &#8220;listening to observations gained over time&#8221;.</p>

			<p>This brings to mind a more recent event. (although rape motiviation hasn&rsquo;t been mentioned as a component of this black on white violent crime, yet)</p>
<p>UNC-Chapel Hill student body president and card carrying, Kool Aid drinking, Kumbaya singing, multi-culturalist Eve Carson&rsquo;s proximate cause of death (at the hands of two, possibly more, feral black felon &#8220;youfs&#8221; on &#8220;cruise control supervised probation&#8221; by the out-of-control black controlled Durham County Office of NC Probation and Parole) in the final analysis was most surely &#8220;SSSS&#8221;  &mdash;  &#8220;Street Smarts Suppression Syndrome&#8221;.  </p>
<p>And since we have touched on the subject of the Durham County Office of NC Probation and Parole, I thought that my fellow Amreners would like to know a little more about current events regarding same. My work brings me into contact with NC Probation and Parole Officers in a neighboring county. There is a stealth &#8220;on the down low&#8221; administrative action proposal that is receiving serious consideration in the State Central Probation and Parole Office in Raleigh. This plan consists of temporarily assigning Probation Officers from surrounding counties that have relatively functional probation offices to the Durham County Office of Probation and Parole to provide remedial &#8220;mentoring services&#8221; to that office. But the real kicker to this that really knocks one&rsquo;s socks off is (that in response to complaints from the Durham County Probation and Parole Office that they have &#8220;excess case loads&#8221; [all urban NC counties have &#8220;excess case loads&#8221;]) that this propasal also includes a 5% pay raise for Durham County employees of Probation and Parole ONLY, to the exclusion of the other 99 NC counties!</p>

<p>I doubt I can think of anything you haven&rsquo;t already thought of, but one thing occurs to me: Possibly there are photos of the mutilated bodies in the Channon crime somewhere online? Probably not, but possibly photos of victims in some equivalent crime could be found online, along with photos of the corresponding perps looking &#8220;normal&#8221; on Myface or wherever  &mdash;  the juxtaposition might make an impression.</p>
<p>Something graphic of course is what usually seems to make people blink. Anyone who&rsquo;s happened upon the scene of a very bad car wreck will drive more carefully for a considerable time afterward, whereas just being told about the accident doesn&rsquo;t seem to have much effect.</p>
<p>These colleges  &mdash;  as part of their freshmen orientation, they should have rape victims  sharing their anguish, instead of whatever diversity nonsense is probably part of those orientations.</p>

			<p>BonBon: Do not send your daughter away to college.  No White should send their kids away to college.  Let them stay in town, get a job, go to the local jr college.  If your children are not ready to face the world on their own, why send them off to be indoctrinated by our enemies?  You may as well indenture them to a pimp. The whole point of college is not to educate, but to corrupt young people, particularly the most intelligent.  When they are a few years older and begin to show some sense, then maybe you could agree to help pay tuition.  </p>

<p>Thanks, Tim McHugh. I will try to get the book. Sounds like a great read.</p>
<p>Something well known to police psychologists is that there is a great deal of denial surrounding  the subject of victims and crime. Sort of a &#8220;blame the victim&#8221;  mental reaction. To be frank: people don&rsquo;t like victims. Victims make us feel uncomfortable. Victims remind us of what could happen to  ourselves.  People don&rsquo;t want to identify with victims; they want to see victims as different.</p>
<p>People desperately try to reassure themselves that such a thing would never happen to them because they are too street-savvy, or well armed, or  prepared, or alert, or whatever.  They reason that the victim basically got what he/she deserved because the victim was stupid, or naive, or looked like easy prey, or shouldn&rsquo;t&rsquo; have been out at that hour, or on that street, or dressed that way. The poor dumb fool was a crime waiting to happen. He/she should have known better!  What a sap!  He/she was just asking for it!  Serves &#8216;em right!  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very easy for these Monday morning quarterbacks to second guess crime victims after the fact and to offer their solutions as to what the victim SHOULD have done when confronted with a gun or a knife on the spur of the moment.</p>
<p>They try to reassure themselves that the victim became a victim through his/her own faults; but this could NEVER happen to THEM because they are too smart.  False confidence!  But it makes them feel better, more invulnerable   &mdash;   until their turn comes.</p>

Very sensible advice from our wise Mr. Dumpty!</p>
<p>Some years ago, I was approached on the street in New York by a young black man seeking directions.  This was  after a number of previous such encounters had  &#8220;educated&#8221; this former liberal into a bristling, race-aware, street-savvy  individual stripped of all  starry-eyed PC illusions.</p>
<p>He wanted directions to the subway or something.  Expecting the worst and without giving him even a chance to finish his sentence, I instantly  tensed up and jumped back, assuming a fighting stance. Having been through the routine before, I was ready for anything he was likely to try.  He backed off in alarm, saying, &#8220;OK, OK!  Just calm down!  Never mind. Forget it!&#8221;  He probably assumed I was some kind of a nut who was going to pull a gun and go crazy on him.  No. I wasn&rsquo;t going to go crazy.  But  I had enough experience with his kind that I was no longer naive either, and I was not taking chances with a young black stranger who approached me on the street. I was prepared to defend my life and wallet, and as Humpty said, to think about it later.</p>
<p>Afterward, I realized that this fellow truly was an innocent person who was just asking directions, but I did not feel sorry about it. I was only following my survival instincts. My behavior was the product of harsh experience and was not without justification. If anyone had regrets, he should have felt sorry that his racial &#8220;brothers&#8221; had taught me to be so leery of him in the first place.  Yes, it was unfortunate, but if an occasional misjudgment is the price of staying alive,  I have no cause for apologies or regrets.  I put my safety before his feelings  (which is what the rape victim above should have done); and as the saying goes, &#8220;better safe than sorry&#8221;.</p>
<p>H. Dumpty further adds: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t use that word (racist), because I don&rsquo;t agree with the agenda it represents. A phony word for a phony idea.&rdquo;</p>

Have patience with her, Bon.   You can&rsquo;t live her life for her, you can only try to impart some wisdom; and you&rsquo;re up against a formidable  propaganda apparatus (the educational establishment).   Your lessons can take a long while to sink in. Plant them carefully.  But once planted, the seeds will in time grow. I too was one who &#8220;knew it all&#8221; when in my teens (don&rsquo;t we all?) and in my  twenties too.  But as I grow older, I find myself more and more  coming around to see my mother&rsquo;s more mature point of view. (And in her case, I&rsquo;m not even talking about race here   &mdash;    just about everything in general.) It takes time.  </p>
<p>You daughter will have to learn about life for herself, but your message, once imparted, will always be with her. Someday, she will see it your way and will thank you.<br>

<p>     Unfortunately, the women&rsquo;s movement on campus does have such programs, but they warn the co-eds against middle class white students (Duke Lacrosse Players) not black affirmative action thugs and violent criminal football players. These campus feminists frighten the women about white males, one of the least likely groups to commit date rape. Minority crime is a forbidden subject at most universities.</p>

I would much rather not be a crime statistic, thank you very much. As to black males saying White women are &#8220;racists&#8221; for not going out with them, this is sheer base manipulation. A woman doesn&rsquo;t have to explain herself or justify her feelings as to who she chooses to become involved with, particularly to some obnoxious black male. It reminds me of the old childhood saying &#8220;sticks and stones will,, well you know the rest.</p>

A very attractive white female friend of mine used to take night school courses, and discovered the classes to be very &#8220;diverse&#8221;. She once complained to me that there were a couple of black men there that were constantly hitting on her, and asking her out. She would say that she was not interested in them, but would always qualify it by saying she wasn&rsquo;t racist</p>

<p>Accusing racism is always an effective tool to get what they want from whites, including getting white females, especially when they are young and naive. But another common approach is for many of them to tell girls who are of Italian, Greek, Spanish or of any Southern European extraction that they aren&rsquo;t really white. And that therefore, it is perfectly natural for them to date blacks. Blacks often insist that Moors were black and that they conquered and mixed with all Europeans in the Mediterranean. Of course it&rsquo;s bogus, but you wouldn&rsquo;t believe how many Blacks claim this to be case, and use it as an excuse to justify race mixing. It&rsquo;s even more unbelievable how many Blacks believe most Sicilians are primarily of African origins.</p>

			<p>American blacks are taught from birth that whenever they are denied anything by a member of another race or rebuked for anything by a member of another race it is because they are black and for no other reason.  This is one reason why they hate all other races.  The other reason is envy of the intellectual superiority and more attractive physical attributes of most other races.  This jealousy and subsequent self-loathing is reinforced daily every time they look in a mirror&hellip; </p>

<p>I hear ya Brother. But that comes with a few qualifications. First, as Aristotle tells us, there is a big difference between Brave and Foolhearty.  I&rsquo;ll give you an example of both.<br>
1- I was walking on 2nd Avenue in NYC back in 1994 with my girlfriend. It was freezing and we were arm and arm. We passed a High School loaded with Blacks and Hispanics and one of them while walking past slammed into my girlfriend and without skipping a beat she held tight and we pulled each other through the crowd.  She wasn&rsquo;t hurt, we got out of there, and I never felt bad about it and neither did she. She knew what would have happened if I said anything.<br>
2- a Puerto Rican lunged toward my same girlfriend while I was coming down stairs from where I worked. I saw the whole thing, went up to him and decked him. The Police were called and I was questioned for hitting him. And the Police (also Hispanic) wanted me to give the guy I hit, my name and address. I can&rsquo;t believe that were that stupid to ask.  <br>
THIS is what we are up against. Then, there is what would follow if I HAD done something.  From the Activist Groups to the MSM who would all line up against me, or any White man who stood up for his woman. That&rsquo;s if he even lived to tell the tale.  But, let me add something else.  After I decked the guy, do you know my girlfriend said?</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you do it?  I&rsquo;m not impressed you hit someone for me!&#8221;</p>
<p>Needless to say, she instantly became me EX-girlfriend. As if I was trying to impress her!  Pressure situations are where you see the true, well, colors.  One more second with that woman and I would have been the idiot, not her.</p>
