						<p>A group of Muslim workers allege they were fired by a New Brighton tortilla factory for refusing to wear uniforms that they say were immodest by Islamic standards.</p>
<p>Six Somali women claim they were ordered by a manager to wear pants and shirts to work instead of their traditional Islamic clothing of loose-fitting skirts and scarves, according to the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a civil liberties group that is representing the women.</p>
<p>The women have filed a religious discrimination complaint with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</p>
<p>&#8220;For these women, wearing tight-fitting pants is like being naked,&#8221; said Valerie Shirley, a spokeswoman for the Minnesota chapter of CAIR. &#8220;It&rsquo;s simply not an option.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gruma Corp., the Irving, Texas-based parent company of Mission Foods, released a written statement Tuesday denying that any employees were terminated or disciplined at the New Brighton plant. However, the company made clear the six women have been relieved of their responsibilities for the time being, and may ultimately lose their jobs if they don&rsquo;t wear uniforms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Should these employees choose to adhere to the current Mission Foods uniform policy, they may return to their positions with the company,&#8221; the company statement said. &#8220;However, these positions will need to be filled as soon as possible and cannot be held indefinitely.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Latest dispute</b></p>
<p>Such disputes have intensified as the American Muslim community grows in numbers and becomes more politically organized, said Thomas Berg, a law professor at the University of St. Thomas. &#8220;After 9/11, both the number of conflicts arose but also the sense among Muslims that they needed to stand together &mdash; at least to oppose unjustified actions,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Last year, some Muslim cashiers at Target Corp. were shifted to other positions inside stores after they refused to scan pork products because doing so would violate their religious beliefs. And in 2005, 26 workers were either fired or suspended by an Arden Hills electronics manufacturer for violating the company&rsquo;s prayer rules, which set limits on the times they could break for prayers.</p>

					<p>Surely working in factories with machinery present, the wearing of  loose-fitting clothing is a safety hazard.  If the employees refuse to obey safety regulations they automatically declare themselves fired.  Nothing to do with religion, just common sense and the rules are for their own good.  Apart from that,the problem is the Muslim men whose insistence on their women being covered up completely is a reflection on their paranoia about other men &#8220;stealing&#8221; their wives.  There is nothing in the Koran about women having to cover up.  It came later for the reason above plus to protect the women from the sun and wind-blown sand.</p>

					<p>While I loathe much of corporate America, the bottom line is still the bottom line.  </p>
<p>The Koran merely enjoins women not to dress &#8220;immodestly&#8221;.  This is open to wide interpretation.  When I was living in Sydney, Australia, an Iranian soccer team came to play.  Persian girls  greeted them near the airport wearing bikinis, waving Iranian flags.  They were alarmingly pretty.  The soccer team went into pop-eyed shock.</p>
<p>Is &#8220;immodest&#8221; wearing lots of gold, or maybe a Rolex watch, whatever the style of clothing?</p>
<p>If God, Creator of the Universe sees us all, He would care far more about what is in our hearts than what we wear.</p>

					<p>Hmmm.  If you don&rsquo;t like a company&rsquo;s dress code - don&rsquo;t work there!  However, there is something to be said for modesty and the Western world has lost its bearing on that front.</p>

					<p>Good.  I bet there is not one, not even one white American working in that factory.  I hope those immigrant labor employees get sued for the next 40 years about this.</p>
<p>It is disgusting.  I went to the main branch of my city library yesterday.  It&rsquo;s a big library with a snack bar and security guards.  The workers in the snack bar, the security guards and the janitor crew that arrived around 4/pm are all hispanics who barely speak English, most probably illegals.  Most of the other employees were hispanic as well.</p>
<p>And who spends many days in the library? American homeless people, some black, some white.  Why can&rsquo;t the illegals be deported and some of those American homeless clean the library?</p>

					<p>Somalis from Auckland to Helsinki know that they don&rsquo;t have to work at all.  They are consistently the highest number to take welfare.  In England they are 40% unemployed, and the women are breeding machines.  </p>
<p>Even if they do work a few years at menial jobs, they&rsquo;ll take more out of the economy than they ever put back, in education, health care, benefit payments and policing. The males are particularly drawn to criminal behavior involving drugs. They are clannish and will always be Somalis regardless of how long they live in exile in the West. </p>

					<p>The women have filed a religious discrimination complaint with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</p>
<p>When did practicing religion take priority to the rights of business owners conducting their business? No one is forcing those women to take jobs that require uniforms! And taking a job working with the public in a society that eats pork means you&rsquo;ll be exposed to it. Driving a car means having your photograph taken with your face exposed for your driver&rsquo;s licesnse. </p>
<p>This is a white created civilization and society. Civil rights meant that other races and minorities would not be denied the opportunity to participate. When did it become perverted to the point that it means not participation, but the right to live in their own society, practicing their own civilization at the expense of ours?!!</p>

					<p>Its a shame that Muslims of all people put Christians to shame when it comes to modesty. (A woman doesn&rsquo;t have to go to the extreme some Muslims go to though to be modest) I can&rsquo;t recall the last time I heard a sermon about modesty or chastity. I guess I need to find an Independent Fundamental Baptist Church (I hear most of them promote modesty)</p>
<p>With Muslims as an exception, there seems to be an interesting equation: the more clothing the more civilized, the less clothing the less civilized   &mdash;   Contrast a modestly attired Victorian populace to Papua New Guinea. The idea that all of the degeneracy of modern western civilization empowers women is absurd and vile. Modesty and chastity empowers women. One would think that all the fashion designers (I have heard that many are black men) today must be perverted men who design their clothes to reveal what wicked men want to see. Indecency is just one of the evils that the social Marxists are pushing.</p>
<p>If any ladies are looking for modest clothing they can go to www.modestapparelusa.com -, an extra bonus: their clothing is all made in the <span class="caps">USA.</span></p>

					<p>Maybe Islamic men should wear headscarves. I heard from a returning veteran from Iraq that over there &#8220;men are for pleasure, women are for babies.&#8221; No surprise that Michael Jackson moved to a Muslim county. I&rsquo;ve heard that many of the sheiks there have lots of little boys in their &#8220;service&#8221;.</p>

					<p>Just dont take a job where you have to wear a uniform if the uniform violates your religious beliefs. I have turned down a couple of jobs where I would have to wear pants since I only wear skirts. I asked politely if I could wear a skirt of a pair of long baggy shorts and if I was turned down I would politely tell them that I could not accept the job.</p>

					<p>I find this obsessive Muslim &#8220;modesty&#8221; ridiculous! While I do not condone the silly extremes of the &#8220;girls gone wild&#8221; generation or the need to go about in public half-naked, I also think that it was good to finally be rid to a large degree, of the more prudish, puritanical shame we were taught to feel about our bodies for centuries. You can cloak youself in bolts of cloth&hellip;we are all naked underneath and all those past puberty pretty much understand what that looks like! Hiding this behind some hyper-religious &#8220;modesty&#8221; is just childish and backward.  </p>
<p>This whole thing is just a political power play if you ask me. Alien people, practicing an alien religion and culture, and demanding that <span class="caps">WE, </span>the host nation, cater to them&hellip;what could be more mad?!</p>

					<p>&#8220;Why should there be a tortilla factory in Minnesota?&#8221;</p>
<p>Big tortillas make great pizza crusts.  Pizza nights, I make one for myself with three-cheese spaghetti sauce, bacon and saurkraut, and one for my wife with olive oil, chicken, olives, sliced peppers, artichoke and Tone&rsquo;s &#8220;spicy spaghetti&#8221; seasoning.  Pepper jack cheese on both.</p>
<p>We all know the real reason there is a tortilla factory in Minnestota, but one can always make the best of it.</p>

					<p>Poor Irving! They have made the news recently in their fight against being overrun by illegal aliens, now the Muslims are up in arms. I am fast becoming an isolatioist. Immigrants of old, for the most part, were grateful for just being in this country. They were not given handouts, they had to learn English, they were willing to make a contribution to their new home. Now, it seems whoever can sneak in, or get in on some trumped up reasons, not only are not grateful, they start whining, demanding, and wanting things their way. Beggars can&rsquo;t be choosers used to be the old saying. No more. Oh, for the good old days! And, I&rsquo;m really glad we moved from Irving years ago. It&rsquo;s no longer the city I knew.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Exactly. This is a practical measure, intended for the employees&rsquo; own good.  The  dress rules are not there to interfere with anyone&rsquo;s religion or beliefs.  (I doubt if the employers could care less.)</p>
<p>The rules are there strictly for the purpose of safety   &mdash;    to protect the employee from harm, and to protect the employer from medical bills and lawsuits.</p>
<p>In life you have to choose your battles. This one is nonsense.<br>

We have our traditions and cultural inheritance. We believe<br><br>
it is what made us great. We believe it is what made the entire world want to come here. If we change to suit alien cultures<br><br>
