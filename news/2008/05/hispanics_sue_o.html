						<p>Four Hispanic families are suing St. Anne&rsquo;s Catholic School [Catholic Diocese of Wichita] over a policy that requires students to speak English at all times while at school.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed Monday, calls for an end to the policy and asks for an order barring similar policies at other diocese schools. It seeks the return of one student to the school who was allegedly kicked out for refusing to sign the &#8220;English only&#8221; pledge. And it asks for court costs and unspecified damages for discrimination and emotional suffering.</p>
<p>&#8220;Language is an essential characteristic of one&rsquo;s national origin,&#8221; according to the complaint filed in the case. &#8220;The ban on Spanish at St. Anne&rsquo;s created an atmosphere of intimidation, inferiority and isolation for Hispanic students.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The diocese has said the school enacted the policy in response to four students who were using Spanish to bully others and to put down teachers and administrators.</p>
<p>The majority of the school&rsquo;s 243 students are white. It has 75 Hispanic students, 27 Asian students and two who are black.</p>
<p>The parents claim in their lawsuit that since the school receives federal money for its free and reduced-price lunch program, it is subject to federal anti-discrimination laws. The district contends it is the students who receive the federal funding.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lawyers for the Hispanic families contend bullying was not the initial reason the school enacted the policy, citing a letter the school sent saying that the more students are immersed in the English language the better their chance for improvement and success.</p>

					<p>I used to think Quebec&rsquo;s french-only language policy was absurd and discriminatory. Now I view it as common sense. English is the de facto official language of the United States, and if Hispanics don&rsquo;t like it, they can take advantage of American freedom and democracy and get out of the nation. Let them move to Mexico, where they can conduct discourse in Spanish as often as they like. But not in the United States!</p>

					<p>This infuriates me. Why in the name of God should St. Anne&rsquo;s, or <span class="caps">ANY AMERICAN SCHOOL, </span>change their language policy to accomodate foreign students?! Learn English, people. It&rsquo;s that simple.</p>

					<p>Not being allowed to speak Spanish in the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>is a very important issue with illegal aliens and more so with their LA <span class="caps">RAZA, LULAC, MECHA, </span>and <span class="caps">MALDEF,</span>etc. enablers. They understand, even if stupid Americans don&rsquo;t, the importance language has in any nation in the world one cares to mention. Takeover, baby, that&rsquo;s the name of the game and LA <span class="caps">RAZA </span>has all but shouted it from the hilltops.</p>

					<p>It&rsquo;s a private school, if you don&rsquo;t like the policy, stop paying tuition and take your kid out.  Are you going to sue the local liquor store because it doesn&rsquo;t carry Corona beer?  <br>
As for the acceptance of Federal funds, it is a legal fact that the lunch money goes to the kids, not the school.  Otherwise, they could not teach religion, which they do.  </p>

They can speak spanish at home all they like just like my grandparents and my parents spoke polish at home and with their friends and neighbors. No one in my family can remember anyone of Polish extraction insisting their children be allowed to speak polish in school. It was never considered. The consensuses of the Polish community was that they had moved to the United States and they made sure their kids learned english for their own future success and to help translate for parents.<br><br>

					<p>The solution for the school is simple. Refuse the federal lunch money (and any other govt. funding, whether federal or state). Then tell the Spanish-speakers to either learn English or get lost.</p>
<p>The administrators of this school should have known better than to accept that federal &#8220;largesse&#8221; in the first place. Once you take that first cent, they own you.</p>

					<p>I hope they eliminate the free lunches, so then the 75 Hispanics will have to bring their own lunches while they speak English.</p>
<p>Catholic schools used to be an affordable alternative to public school because nuns were used as teachers. There are far less women becoming nuns now&hellip;</p>

					<p>You have got to be kidding me??  Last I looked this was a English speaking country?  So how can the private Catholic school be discriminatory?  Isn&rsquo;t that the whole reason in paying a high price for a private school?  I thought private schools were private, in order to keep out the riff-raff?  If these poor little Mexicans feel like the Whites are bullying them&hellip;.then leave.<br>
My little brother went to a exclusive all-White private Catholic high school.  There were only 3 Blacks &amp; one Mexican.  <br><br>
The Mexican knew he couldn&rsquo;t play the race card.  The students throughout the school did not put up with it.  My little brother said several of his classmates threatened the Mexican with deportation!!  <br><br>
Our Dad paid several thousands of dollars every year to keep my brother from having to go to public school with the riff-raff.  Tell me again why we are being the bad guy?  </p>

					<p>I would like to add to this post.  Do you think if one&rsquo;s origian has to do with their language&hellip;then stay in the country of origian!! <br>
I am sick &amp; tired&hellip;beyond sick &amp; tired of seeing everyday products printed in English &amp; spanish!!!!!!   Our country is English speaking.  Many of our ancestors came over from Europe, not knowing any English &amp; nobody to help them.  Our ancestors learned it anyway!  They were proud to be here &amp; didn&rsquo;t try to milk the system.  Let&rsquo;s go to Mexico &amp; sue the entire country because they are Spanish speaking only!!!!1</p>

					<p>&#8220;the more the students are emmersed in the English language, the better their chances for improvement and success&#8221;.  What&rsquo;s wrong with that statement!  When I was young, in the 50s &amp; 60s a Catholic School student(my wife included) had to obey all the rules and if the parents or students didn&rsquo;t like it they were asked to leave. Nobody complained and nobody cared if you did, nobody sued. How many people in this world today are intimidated, made to feel inferior and are isolated from others and they learn to live with it and cope and it makes them stronger. Society today is producing a bunch of babies. God help us when these spoiled brats become adults.  </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s quite simple:  If you don&rsquo;t like the rules of this school, <span class="caps">LEAVE</span>!  Also, if you don&rsquo;t like the rules of this country, <span class="caps">LEAVE</span>!  </p>

					<p>I play a computer game over the internet. While people from all over the world play they had to virtually ban non-english in the public chatrooms. Most people probably don&rsquo;t know the reason this rule came about, however, words cannot accurately describe how maddening it could be before the change was made. </p>

					<p>Ridiculous.  It&rsquo;s a private school, they certainly should be able to require English at all times.  If you don&rsquo;t like it, then leave.  Also, it&rsquo;s no different than a french/spanish teacher requiring that no one speak english in there class and that is very common in private and public schools.  Maybe they should go to a all spanish speaking school and see how far that gets them in life.</p>

					<p>I am German, when I was 10 years old I hated my parents with a passion. Since my family was  intent on leaving the country, they sent me to an English boarding school, despite the fact I did not know a word of the language. This was not to long after the war, most of the kids in school had lost someone in their family, for which I was personally held responsible. Six months later I spoke<br>
impeccable English, today most people assume I am British the minute I open my mouth. The point of this story is that the nuns<br><br>
know quite well that language is best learned when young and the only way to do so is to live the language, not just learn it.</p>

					<p>Maybe the Wichita diocese is innocent of any past hispandering, I don&rsquo;t know, and if so, I apologize,   &mdash;   but in view of the catering to illegals the Catholic Church in general is guilty of (such as demanding what really amounts to amnesty during sermons in that priests are telling Catholics the bible instructs them to welcome newcomers, providing sanctuary to illegal aliens to frustrate <span class="caps">ICE </span>enforcement efforts, etc.,) could it be the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> Catholic Church is now reaping what it&rsquo;s sown and is finding out that all this &#8220;diversity&#8221; stuff is not so hot, after all?  If so, I say <span class="caps">HAH</span>!  You brought it on yourselves!  Hope you enjoy it!</p>

					<p>A nice try, but when the Mpls/St. Paul Archdiocese <span class="caps">MANDATED </span>that <span class="caps">ALL </span>clergy in her purview, begin learning Spanish, some 8 or so years ago, I saw the writing on the wall had come true, that had begun so auspiciously in 1965, with the implementation of the decrees of Vatican <span class="caps">II, </span>and the doctrine of &#8216;inculturation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I left that communion in 1980, when I saw it sliding into immorality, apostasy, etc. in my town. All of which is chronicled in the book, &#8220;Goodbye, Good Men&#8221; by Michael S. Rose. I read this book, and realized I had not been &#8216;making this up&rsquo; as many in my family said.</p>
<p>The immorality of it all, is that the Hispanics deem <span class="caps">THEIR </span>rights supercede the rights of the <span class="caps">INDIGEOUS CATHOLICS </span>in this land. Last time I read it, none of the Midwest was part of <span class="caps">AZTLAN.</span> Nor shall it ever be!</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t hold much hope that the <span class="caps">RCC </span>will stand up for Anglo&rsquo;s rights, after the current pontiff&rsquo;s visit clearly paved the way for unlimited illegal immigration from south of the border. </p>
<p>I once wondered why the Calvinist Puritan/Pilgrim majority were so adamant about &#8216;ethnic dilution&rsquo; when the Irish anti-catholic sentiments abounded in the mid-late 1800&rsquo;s, when MY family came over the pond. At least the Irish managed to assimilate, for they were of the same ethnicity. Hispanics are not. And therein lies the confirmation of all of Blanshard&rsquo;s &#8216;anti-catholic&rsquo; tomes, from the 1950&rsquo;s&hellip;..</p>

					<p>  What is wrong with this is that our politicians have <span class="caps">FAILED </span>to make English the <span class="caps">ONLY </span>language of the <span class="caps">USA.</span><br>
  The Federal government should require that all public facilities conduct <span class="caps">ALL </span>business in English so <span class="caps">ALL AMERICANS </span>can understand. <br><br>
  No foreigner or student should be admitted to the <span class="caps">US, </span>except as a tourist, who does not speak and write fluent understandable English.<br><br>

					<p>A non issue. Language isn&rsquo;t the problem. Any Whites who think that everything will be OK if the entire world speaks English, watches American TV and movies and tries a bit to &#8220;be like us&#8221;, I have some farm land in Rhodesia I want to sell you.</p>
<p>Mugabe, Jeremiah Wright, the Bloods, Crips, Central Park Wilding rapists, Knoxville Horror torturers, these non Whites all speak English.</p>
<p>Our problems are racial and cultural problems and the biggest problem we have is that our people are soft, lazy, foolish, can&rsquo;t understand basic human differences between &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;them&#8221;.</p>
