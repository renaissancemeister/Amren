				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Richard Edwards, London Telegraph, May 22, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Julie Spence, Chief Constable of Cambridgeshire, said her officers were already struggling to cope with the consequences of migration and warned that if the economic downturn continued, it would heighten tensions in communities with large numbers of migrant workers.</p>
<p>Speaking at the Police Federation conference in Bournemouth on Wednesday, Mrs Spence said: &#8220;We do wonder what is going to happen as the credit crunch starts to bite. We have already seen [claims that] &lsquo;people are taking our jobs&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&#8220;What does the future hold? We have to be very alive and alert to that as police officers if we want to live in cohesive communities.&#8221;</p>
<p>The police chief claimed that &#8220;poor&#8221; Government figures on migrant numbers could not be trusted.</p>
<p>Ministers had underestimated the number of Eastern Europeans in the UK by up to two thirds, she said, adding that her own research suggested there were as many as 1.4 million living in Britain.</p>
<p>According to official statistics published this week, 845,000 Eastern European migrants have applied for the Worker Registration Scheme.</p>
<p>Mrs Spence told delegates at the Bournemouth conference that reports that some migrants were returning home were wrong. She gave a series of examples of new problems faced by her officers as a result of the growing migrant population.</p>
<p>They included violence breaking out between people from Iraq and Pakistan following confrontations over young women. Mrs Spence, who is due to give evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee next month on the impact of migrants in Cambridgeshire, labelled the Migrant Impact Forum, the Government&rsquo;s advisory body, as a &#8220;talking shop&#8221; and criticised ministers&rsquo; response to the issue.</p>
<p>She said: &#8220;They need to get their act together because there has been a rapid change and no real response from government apart from a pat on the head.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs Spence said in Peterborough alone, 93 cultures were now represented and 100 languages spoken.</p>
<p>She added: &#8220;There are foreign nationals in our cells every day of the week.&#8221;</p>
<p>The police chief called for a European-wide convictions database and gave the example of one man who was violent towards police after crashing his car in Cambridgeshire. They later discovered from Polish authorities that he had been convicted of murder in his homeland.<br>

			<p>What is this thing with the British that they feel free to criticize the Eastern Europeans while never is anything said about the much wider problem with blacks and Asians?</p>

			<p>Get rid of your leaders, job 1.</p>
<p>Get leaders that represent traditional british values.</p>
<p>Start the exportation process after a complete halt to new immigration.</p>
<p>It is a bit late and it is going to be painful.</p>
<p>It is either bite the bullet now or buy your prayer rug.</p>

			<p>They are aware that no extremely pluralistic country in the history of mankind has survived intact&hellip;..and those breaking up into communities as in Switzerland don&rsquo;t count, because they are autonomous nation-states for all intents and purposes&hellip;..yet they foolishly continue on with some hare-brained idea that they need these contentious elements or their country will cease to exist.</p>
<p>I wonder if they realize that if they had invested in the money, time and effort to encourage population increases from their white population, that they have poured into importing killers, thieves, beggars, and welfare frauds their country of origin didn&rsquo;t want, they would not only solve their population problem, but they wouldn&rsquo;t be creating any more for themselves?</p>

			<p>The age of multiculturalism is slowly breaking down, what comes next a revival or anarchy.</p>

			<p>The &#8220;credit crunch&#8221; will possibly cause ethnic violence? A bit like saying turning your kitchen water tap on will surely cause higher than normal tides&hellip; </p>
<p>Immigration (read non-White IMMIGRANTS) causes eventual ethnic violence. Because African and/or Muslim immigrants do not need an excuse for mindless violence and crime. The tendency to engage in criminal behavior is hardwired into their brains&hellip; call it a genetic factor. Before calling me a racist (or a liar) read the horror stories about the crime and violence committed in Africa BY AFRICANS AGAINST AFRICANS for the last fifty or sixty years alone. Read about the ourageous crimes by Muslims over the same time period.</p>
<p>I recall a news item in our Houston paper&hellip; about African mercenaries engaging in CANNIBALISM&hellip; eating captured Africans for the purpose of instilling fear and cowardice in the local people. Using cannibalism as but another instrument of terrorism&hellip; like rapes and mutilation of locals, for example.</p>

			<p>The irony is that a serious economic downturn is the one thing left that might put an end to the invasion. If - when? - the eocnomy gets bad enough there will be in the West plenty of whites glad to do those jobs that &#8220;whites won&rsquo;t do.&#8221;</p>

			<p>It has long been known that multiculturalism is best tolerated in affluent societies and when those societies start to go through periods of economic stress things rapidly break down.</p>
<p>Look at Germany in the 1930s - great economic distress as their economy was closely tied to the US economy and went in to a depression that could be described as a 1930s version of Zimbabwe with cab fares costing in the billions.  Did the Germans say hey tough luck?  No, they sought and were given someone to blame.  </p>
<p>Today, why are the South Africans killing foreigners?  Xenophobia?  Nope, they are &#8220;stealing our jobs&#8221;.  </p>

<p>Its not a thing with the British but the politicians and media.</p>
<p>Its a free shot to have a go at white European Christians. No-body will accuse them of racism, whereas to have a go at muslims, asians, arabs, blacks, gypsies etc results is a lynch mob from the liberals.</p>
<p>Be assured that the British, with a few exceptions, have no problem with fellow Europeans but have major problems with Third World immigrants - its just that its now very dangerous to say so and avoid a jail sentence.<br>

<p>You don&rsquo;t know why?  That&rsquo;s an easy one.  </p>
<p>The &#8220;Eastern Europeans&#8221; are white   &mdash;   thus are not one of the  sacred-cow minorities. <br>
 <br>
Since Eastern Europeans are not -  ahem -  &#8220;people of color,&#8221;  you are free to criticize them all you like.  That takes the heat off the protected non-white &#8220;minorities&#8221; who are above all criticism.</p>
