						<p>Afrikaners have joined an international organisation fighting for the rights of minorities, Freedom Front Plus leader Pieter Mulder said on Monday.</p>
<p>The Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO), at its General Assembly in Brussels over the weekend, accepted the Afrikaner people as one of its 70 members which include Australia&rsquo;s Aboriginals, the Maasai of Kenya and Tanzania and Tibetan monks.</p>
<p>According to the FF Plus, the inclusion in this international pressure group was one of the parties&rsquo; greatest achievement&rsquo;s to date.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you look at the situation in South Africa at the moment, it would be unwise for a group such as the Afrikaner not to consider other options, and one of those options is to internationalize our case,&#8221; Mulder told reporters at a press conference in Pretoria.</p>
<p>UNPO&rsquo;s membership consists of indigenous peoples, minorities, and unrecognised or occupied territories.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is an organisation that fights for the right of the world&rsquo;s silent voices,&#8221; Mulder said.</p>
<p>It has grown from its original fifteen founders, to representing almost 70 Members worldwide.</p>
<p>Except for minority groupings, it also includes countries that have declared independence and have not been recognised internationally such as Somaliland which is part of Somalia, and Iraq&rsquo;s Kurdistan.</p>
<p>The organisation lobbies internationally for the rights of these communities and countries including at the United Nations and European Parliament.</p>
<p>It counts the recognition of Kosovo as one of its successes.<br>

			<p>Definitely a step in the right direction.  The first step to solving a problem is recognizing it exists and that is what&rsquo;s being done.  Leftists the world over will shrug their shoulders and say, &#8220;I don&rsquo;t care about the Afrikaners because they supported apartheid and persecuted blacks&#8221;.  Leftists can&rsquo;t help it because such collectivist guilt attitudes are part of their mental illness.</p>

			<p>I see this as a positive thing, but I almost afraid to say that because there&rsquo;s always someone here ready to put as negative a spin on it as possible, in some way. To me, it shows that not every political/social body in the world is howling for white blood. Some  even seem to be fair-minded.</p>

			<p>What took them this long?  Afrikaaners have their own language and their own, distinct culture, so of course they qualify.</p>

			<p>Logically, this should be done. In the very near future   &mdash;   if not already   &mdash;   whites worldwide will have to understand that their status on this earth has become that of an endangered and persecuted minority. Whites must accept that they have fallen, ever before they can hope to survive and rebuild.</p>

			<p>This will not benefit the Afrikaners one bit - except when the inevitable race war breaks out the Afrikaners will be able to say that they asked the international community for help and found only hatred.</p>
<p>Have the recent events in SA not vindicated the Afrikaner&rsquo;s history ??</p>

			<p>Seems to me that American Southerners, (actual Southrons; not just anyone who happens to be living in a certain geographical region), should join this group as well. We have our own language and we certainly have our own culture. Both are being chipped away daily by immigration and by people watching the idiot box.  </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m a white American from the south and I have come to believe that it is vitally important for us to watch what happens to the Afrikaners for what happens to them today may well happen to us by the middle of this century. Certainly the excuses used by the average American liberals and their socialist political leaders to destroy Rhodesia and South Africa are equally true of white southerners.  We once supported government enforced racial segregation. If that is an valid reason to turn a blind eye to government sponsored repression of whites in South Africa, then it is logically applicable to all whites in the former Confederate States of America.</p>
<p>The only reason why white southerners are not being raped, murdered, disenfranchised, and disposed at the level that the South African whites are experiencing is that there are more of us and many of us are very well armed.  Even in America you can see the incentive effect that the MSM and governments refusal to deal openly and decisively with black hate crimes against whites has had on INCREASING levels of violence against whites.   </p>
<p>We saw how the brutal and bestial torture murders of Channon Christian and Christopher Newsome by a gang of American blacks was almost completely ignored or minimized by the media and by government.  This at the same time that the Duke Lacross players were being vilified by their college professors, the national media and every racial spoils flim flam artist in the country.</p>
<p>Then earlier this year we had two beautiful promising young college students, Lauren Burk of Auburn University and Eve Carson of UNC-Chapel Hill, shot down like dogs in the street by black street thugs.   Eve was a native of Athens, Georgia where I live and there was a great outpouring of grief in our town.   What I noticed was that nobody dared to tell the truth about these tragic deaths, that they were the result of violent black racist &#8220;street justice&#8221; where being a young, attractive college student is in itself justification for being murdered.   White Americans better wake up and start defending their children.  Watch South Africa closely because what happens to whites there is also starting to happen here.</p>

I thought the same thing as I was reading this article!</p>
<p>It would be a stretch though I&rsquo;m afraid.  What clearly defines a Southerner?  Many are born in the South, yet have no familial roots in the respective states.  Many claim very old Southern heritage (such as myself) but were born well outside of the South.  Not to mention we only have a dialect, not a language.</p>
<p>Worth a try though!  We have had seccionist tendencies in the past, certainly that qualifies?<br>

			<p>International recognition is only the start. eventually when South Africa becomes like Zimbabwe and the Zulu Xhosa And Sotho decimate eachother then we the forgotten whites in Africa will have our own Independant country.Faith Volk en Vaderland</p>

			<p>Does that mean that Afrikaaners can now seek to be sponsored to become &#8216;immigrants&rsquo; to the USA? </p>
<p>I, for one, would gladly sponsor educated Afrikaaners over any other nationality, ANYTIME!</p>
