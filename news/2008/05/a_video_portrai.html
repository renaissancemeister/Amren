			<p>It is a VERY DANGEROUS state of affairs that I will be forced to vote for McCain only to keep this Marxist, anti-American, would-be usurper out of office.  As a life-long Republican, I was ready to endorse Hillary, who seems less married to global issues and immigration that either McCain or Obama.  Hillary has actually become the most Buchananite of the three candidates.  I can deal with some of he silly government projects if they are designed with a spirit to help the American working classes.  But with Obama we will have four years of a couple who will do everything possible to destroy Western culture from the top down - and this at a time when Europe is gearing for its next civil war against Islam and the possible collapse of the EU.</p>
<p>I urge all paleocons and everyone disenchanted with the neocons and Bush to not get carried away and endorse Obama out of spite.  Hillary is a risk we can take to purge the GOP of the neocons; Obama is not.</p>

			<p>What&rsquo;s the problem?  Half or more of so-called pro-whites agree 100% with Obama and the Islamists and Marxists and their lust to see America defeated and humiliated in Iraq and beyond.  They rage against McCain and his call for victory, for crushing our enemies.</p>
<p>Sure, McCain is awful on immigration, but all the candidates are.</p>
<p>No, what really animates far too many &#8220;pro-whites&#8221; is a bizarre confluence of views with the mortal enemies of the white West.</p>

<p>But I cannot for the life of me even begin to fathom what the &#8220;blue state&#8221; plutocracy sees in him. </p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re making a big mistake supporting this guy.</p>

 If Mr. Hendershot is being honest, then he must be outraged whenever Rodham is inserted between Hillary and Clinton, or perhaps it is being factual about Obama that is so troubling to so many Liberals.<br>
 History has shown that once totalitarians gain power, and Obama is one, they move to destroy any competition. Lenin, Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Ho all did this. One of the first groups targeted has always been the &#8220;intellectual class&#8221;. They cannot forsee that they will be viewed as dangerous to those in power.<br>
 That&rsquo;s why Lenin called those in the West &#8220;useful idiots&#8221;.</p>

			<p>The propaganda war is heating up, people.  The evil white racists are at it again, but as the savior Obama has explained, it&rsquo;s just typical white people being typical.  This guy is bad news.  Scoff, laugh or call me crazy, but I think he truly exhibits traits of an anti-christ.</p>

			<p>Given his lack of experience and massive support, if he wins, he will be both the most incompetent and the most protected President in History.</p>
<p>In short, he will be exactly the kind of President that will make it obvious what should have been obvious years ago.  That the Office of the President of the United States just does not mean what it used to.  </p>
<p>Simply look at Cultural History, as John Ruskin pointed out in the 19th Century and Joseph Campbell in the 20th, read the buildings.  The biggest buildings are Corporate buildings that drive the affairs of the other Institutions, Educational and Ideological (ie; Arts and Sciences), Government and even Religious.  They even effect the UN since it was only ever effective by setting up UNESCO which was a Corporation.</p>
<p>In fact, the irony is that the MSM that is praising him to the skies as if they are beneath him, are the part of the Power Elite high above him, though they are just the Public Relations Department, so to speak.  <br>

  I understand, and am sympathetic with, those who are concerned about Obama taking us down.  But a President can&rsquo;t do that.  He is a SYMPTOM, a symptom of a very long cultural de-evolution.  One that all of us, in one way or another, are all a part of. </p>
<p>Hey, have you ever noticed that places like AR, and VDARE, never - NEVER - talk about organizing, getting together, talking with each other, especially VDARE.  I once read a letter to VDARE where the person asked a very sensible question concerning some matter having to do with Race, and the best Steve Sailer could do is respond with rude, and adolescent, sarcasm.  And his answer was no answer.  It really turned me off, but at the same time, shined a light on the matter, for me at least.  I&rsquo;ve never looked at that website the same since, even though I still read it from time to time and do appreciate its work and writers.<br>
I guess in some way all of us are kind of stuck and can&rsquo;t do much.  I just think its funny they put all that time into a website and NEVER talk about how we can improve communication amongst ourselves and get organized.  Maybe we&rsquo;re just like the Stoics during the fall of Rome, who could only DESCRIBE what was happening, but were powerless to change it.</p>

			<p>Hillary is a feminaze who shares the beliefs of the far left:  what we can expect from her as president is much more of the same, i.e. massive expansion of the federal government, tax hikes for &#8220;the wealthy&#8221;(meaning everyone whose combined family income is $100K or greater); much of this will be done through executive orders, the rest through a Democratic congress.  Hillary is an ideologue, she actually believes in her absurd brand of socialism and she is therefore dangerous.</p>
<p>Obama combines everything that is evil about Hillary and adds to it a profound racial animus against whites.  He too is an ideologue.  What can we expect under an Obama presidency?  Clearly the country will be the forum for this mulatto&rsquo;s racial identity crisis which means more widespread and forceful discrimination against whites, reparations for slavery (even though he has no such history in his family), etc.</p>
<p>McCain is really a RINO who will embrace the game plan of the left.  He is also old and relatively unstable mentally.  Were he to win, he would complete the fusion of the two parties into one authoritarian leftist party.</p>
<p>This is where the long march through the institutions has brought us.</p>
<p>Any white person who votes for Obama is a fool.</p>
<p>The one up side to an Obama presidency is that he will preside over America&rsquo;s greatest economic depression  &mdash;  for which he will be blamed and will never be elected to a second term.  In four years McCain may well be far too old and/or sick to run and the Republicans might just once nominate someone like Ron Paul who would be a two term president and would actually change things.</p>

			<p>No, if Barak HUSSEIN Obama would get elected, we will NOT be sitting around melodiously singing &#8220;KUMBAYA.&#8221; Crime (Black on White) will probably be escalating. Blacks feeling with a brotha in the White House, they can do whatever strikes their fancy.</p>
<p>Immigration will still continue to result in job losses (displacements) suffered by American workers. With the heaviest impact on under-skilled, under-educated Blacks. Having admitted he favors open borders, don&rsquo;t expect the Mulatto Messiah to do anything to stem the tide.</p>
<p>Blacks will still be steeped in poverty   &mdash;   in spite of Obama demanding more money be spent [wasted] on new schools in Black areas of our cities and towns. Reminding one of the old adage: You can lead a horse to water&hellip; but can&rsquo;t force him to drink.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly BHO will be throwing taxpayer money around like the proverbial drunken sailor. Whether any of this money will do much appreciable good&hellip; Your guess is as good as mine.</p>
<p>I urge every thinking person to either write in a presidential candidate name, or at worst, vote for McCain. Hawkish Mccain is hardly one iota better than BHO, but at least you&rsquo;re sending a message to the Democratic party. That they shot themselves in the foot over their choice of their standard-bearer.</p>

			<p>Re: An Ally in NYC and Irish</p>
<p>Are you kidding?  Do you think any paleoconservative worth his salt is going to support a boot-licking neo-con like McCain?  McCain is a traitor to his people and Western Civilization.  The best thing that can happen to the Republican party is a landslide defeat, so that genuine conservatives can re-take control of the party and send the neo-cons packing back to the radical left where they belong.</p>

			<p>Gee, shucks, aint that Obama a saintly fellow. Though his campaign workers are daily insulted by the evil white racists [strange that not one of the whites said anything about being upset by his 20 years attending a hate-whitey church, they just were being their normal everday racists like we all know whites are] the Great Saviour pours balm on the wounds with his soothing words of togetherness &amp; brotherly love. Then I&rsquo;m sure he went to his church &amp; neath the stain-glass window received much comfort &amp; blessings from his pastor, a great black holy man, whom I believe is also a great comforter of troubled souls &hellip; then the band played &#8216;Believe It If you Like&rsquo;.</p>

			<p>And this is the guy that many in the white nationalist movement are wanting as president just because he is against the war???? As I said under the other thread, I understand why you guys want him as president if you are following the &#8220;worse is better&#8221; way of thinking, but some of you are starting to claim he has certain positive virtues that McCain lacks.  This is what I don&rsquo;t understand.  </p>

<p>The real reason is hinted at all the time in the media and by Obama but it never really comes out.  It has very little to do with him being black.  Obama is anti-semitic along with a lot of the far left.  They want him in office to smash the influence that AIPAC has on American foreign policy and to get our troops out of Iraq.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I understand why the &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; hoi polloi supports Obama. They&rsquo;re brainwashed morons. &#8220;</p>
<p>Hoi Polloi actually refers to the lower class; not those who consider themselves high class. I think you meant to say &#8220;Hoitsy Toitsy&#8221; a slang expression referring to people who truly believe that they are better than the rest of us.</p>

  <br>
Oh, and Obama is gonna tax us into oblivion.</p>
