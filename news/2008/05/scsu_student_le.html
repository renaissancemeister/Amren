<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>A St. Cloud State University student in a teacher-training program at Technical High School left the school in late April because he says he feared for the safety of his service dog.</p>
<p>The school district calls it a misunderstanding, and officials there say they hoped Tyler Hurd, a 23-year-old junior from Mahtomedi who aspires to teach special education, would continue his training in the district.</p>
<p>Hurd said a student threatened to kill his service dog named Emmitt. The black lab is trained to protect Hurd when he has seizures.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The threat came from a Somali student who is Muslim, according to Hurd, St. Cloud State and school district officials.</p>
<p>The Muslim faith, which is the dominant faith of Somali immigrants, forbids the touching of dogs.</p>
<p>Hurd trained at Talahi Community School and Tech. He said his experience at Talahi was good. The Somali students there warmed to the dog and eventually petted him using paper to keep their hands off his fur, Hurd said.</p>
<p>Things didn&rsquo;t go as well at Tech, Hurd said. Students there taunted his dog, and he finally felt he had to leave after he was told a student made a threat. Hurd met with Lockhart but said he did not feel comfortable continuing.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Steffens [Kate Steffens, dean of the college of education at St. Cloud State] said it is important to respect different cultures and the rights of disabled students.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think this is part of the growth process when we become more diverse,&#8221; Steffens said.</p>

			<p>The headline wouldn&rsquo;t give you a clue to the story.  You have to go halfway down in the article to find out that the student is being *driven out* at the hands of Somali Muslim fanatics.  Others are asking why didn&rsquo;t the school discipline those who made the threats?  The answer is at the end of the sentence before last.</p>

			<p>The Muslim who made the threat is the one who should have been sent packing!!  </p>
<p>Muslims repeatedly demonstrate both that they are unwilling to assimilate, and that their unwillingness and hostility and violent propensity is the source of endless pain, suffering, and mass-murder.  </p>
<p>Muslims should be wholly deported from all Western countries.   </p>

&ldquo;I think this is part of the growth process when we become more diverse,&rdquo; Steffens said.</p>
<p><br>
Aside from being a hilarious punchline to the above nonsense, I&rsquo;m sure all AmRenners would agree with me that if &#8220;diversity&#8221; meant embracing and treating with full respect the disabled, the blind, etc, every one of us here would support the notion. Because   &mdash;   although we Right-wingers are routinely smeared as heartless greedheads who pine for the good old days when you could still send children down coal mines and other inhuman acts   &mdash;   we of course know we&rsquo;re not nearly so hard-hearted as that. </p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s NOT what &#8220;diversity&#8221; means today, is it? The trouble is that today &#8220;diversity&#8221; means embracing, treating with full respect, and NEVER criticizing, every pre-Medieval religious crackpot who&rsquo;s figured out how to fill out some paperwork and board an airplane. </p>
<p>And THAT&rsquo;S when we discover that, in our desire to be fair to everyone (and to sample tasty new treats from around the globe), we&rsquo;ve imported a frighteningly large bunch of uncouth, uneducated, unenlightened aliens with whom we have NOTHING in common, with whom we quite simply CAN&rsquo;T GET ALONG   &mdash;   including some who are unambiguously COMMITTED TO OUR EXTINCTION. </p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re supposed to believe this is a &#8220;growth process&#8221;? If so, then was the Fall of Rome also a growth process? </p>
<p>For the immigrants, maybe. </p>
<p>For the Romans, not so much. <br>

			<p>I see alot of Muslim women on my dog walking route and noticed they cross the street when they see us coming.  I try to cross at the same time, and if they don&rsquo;t retreat back to the other side, I say to them, &#8220;Good evening ladies,&#8221; with the expected dirty, ugly looks.  Then again I think this is what they always look like.</p>

			<p>It is OK for diversity to cause us white folk unlimited problems, we see this everyday. But, when two entitled diversities collide, Mr. Hurd is a Handicapper (deserving special protections and priviliges), then the problems start. When an irresistable force acts on an immovable object, which one prevails?</p>

<p>So it&rsquo;s all right to touch a dog as long as there&rsquo;s a thing piece of paper between you and its fur? That makes about as much sense as the rest of the Muslim religion.</p>

			<p>     Wait until Christmas. The Muslims will say that religious displays in your own yard offend them. Some cookoo judge will agree with them and all Christmas displays will be banned. It&rsquo;s time to get out the shotguns, rifles, and pistols - not for the Muslims, but for the white idiots who agree with them.</p>

			<p>     Choosing between Dogs and Muslims-easy, Dogs. Dogs don&rsquo;t<br>
blow up buildings and beat woman. Dogs are friendly and useful.<br>
Muslims are not. To Muslims, Dogs are dirty and calling someone<br>
a Dog is an insult. I say Dogs are clean if their master is and<br>
that Muslims have dirty minds. They are not worthy to touch the<br>
pad of my dog&rsquo;s paw.</p>

			<p>     Much of the world doesn&rsquo;t like dogs-we do. That&rsquo;s putting<br>
it mildly. We are crazy about dogs; they are our surrogate<br>
children (unfortunately). Just as the Hindus have the Cow, we<br>
have the Dog. And any violence against our sacred animal will<br>
be met with murderous rage.</p>

I haven&rsquo;t paid much attention to African wars of late but I&rsquo;m getting a lot more sympathetic to whoever was fighting them.<br>

			<p>The one time I was questioned by a cop with a K-9 partner was in college. The dog lay on my doorstep and it was a mixed-sex dorm floor. I wanted to close the door to get dressed, so I tossed my head at the German Shepherd, and it backed up a bit.  I closed the door, got completely dressed, and when I opened the door, the dog blocked the entry again, shortly before the police woman came back to not arrest me.  </p>
<p>That dog was cool.  Why would ayone want to hurt a dog?</p>

<p>Oh, no. In Minnesota, as in the REST OF THE USA, the group most invovled with the destruction of the Homogenous racial character of the USA is the LUTHERANS, with the Lutheran Social(ist) Service at the top of the charts here in MN.</p>

			<p>These people should not be allowed to see your fear of them, and they should not be allowed to hide behind their religion.  When they are not made to assimilate, they will go further and further with threats, intimidation and violence all in the name of Allah.  Imagine if this was a white man threatening a disabled person&rsquo;s service dog.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;The threat came from a Somali student who is Muslim, according to Hurd, St. Cloud State and school district officials.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, here is my scorecard on this topic and it is very objective, since I thankfully once had a pet Labrador, and now unfortunately have regular passing contact with Somalis.</p>
<p>So here goes:  </p>
<p>1.) Labradors, intelligent and graceful.</p>
<p>Somalis, obtuse and shambling;</p>
<p>2.) Labradors, loyal and sociable;</p>
<p>Somalis, Muslims and typically so;</p>
<p>3.) Labradors, protective and helpful;</p>
<p>Somalis, hostile and obnoxious; </p>
<p>4.) Labradors, good with children;</p>
<p>Somalis, not even good with themselves;</p>
<p>5.) Labradors, fond of pork chops and bacon;</p>
<p>Somalis, antagonistic toward swine and even wine; </p>
<p>6.) Labradors, reasonably respectful of house rules;</p>
<p>Somalis, arrogantly ignorant of house rules;</p>
<p>7.) Labradors, grateful for kindness and inclusion;</p>
<p>Somalis, ungrateful and intrusive to the same;</p>
<p>And</p>
<p>8.) Labradors, tolerant of all religions;</p>
<p>Somalis, freakishly intolerant in the name of &ldquo;the prophet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, draw your own conclusions from here in this &ldquo;growth process&rdquo; and as Porky Pig would say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all folks&hellip;&rdquo;<br>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree more.  For an organization purportedly devoted to a White racial movement and consciousness, why is the lonely plight of one of our greatest, contemporary heroes being met with a deafening SILENCE here at AmRen? Professor MacDonald is an intellectual of the highest calibre and one of our most ardent defenders of white ethnocentrism, and yet the ongoing concerted attack by the deceitfully misnamed Southern Poverty Law Center has NEVER been addressed here.  Why are we throwing him to the wolves? He needs and deserves our fervent support:</p>
