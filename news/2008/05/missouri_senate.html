						<p>The Missouri Senate has passed a wide-ranging illegal immigration bill.</p>
<p>It would bar so-called &#8220;sanctuary cities,&#8221; authorize state troopers to be trained to enforce federal immigration laws, and require driver&rsquo;s license tests be given in English.</p>
<p>But it also contains an amendment that leaders in the State House don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>That amendment would fine employers who misclassify undocumented workers as &#8220;contractors&#8221; up to $50,000.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>House and Senate leaders have until 6:PM Friday to pass a final version of the immigration bill.</p>
<p>If they don&rsquo;t, Governor Matt Blunt has promised to call a special session.</p>
<p>{snip}<br>

			<p>Sanctuary cities are a violation of existing U.S. immigration law. The Mayors, Governors, City Councils, Senators, Judges, and Congresspeople who are doing nothing about this, need to be immediately arrested and jailed for gross derilection of duty and violation of their oaths of office. Their arrests should have taken place years ago.</p>

			<p>In other words, since the Feds don&rsquo;t want to crack down on sanctuary cities, the state will have to.  Since the Feds don&rsquo;t want to spend the resources to apprehend illegal aliens to the extent that they should, the state will have to.</p>
<p>Gov. Blunt is making motions that he will sign these bills, but I&rsquo;m not so sure.  He&rsquo;s kind of inexperienced who seems to rely on Republican Party pied pipers (i.e. the cheap labor lobby).  One could say that he is thinking about re-election this year, but he&rsquo;s  not running for re-election.</p>
<p>I also hope the General Assembly could pass MCRI as a matter of legislation so that we don&rsquo;t have to pound the pavement for signatures in another 2 years.</p>

			<p>Excellent. Well done.</p>
<p>The key here is that we have solid successes at the State and Local level. That is where we must work. </p>
<p>Please, everyone stop pushing these long shot, no shot Presidential bids by &#8220;patriots&#8221; who will somehow manage to win the US Presidency and make everything OK again. It doesn&rsquo;t work that way, it just makes our cause look hopeless, foolish when old, out of touch patriots waste all their time and money promoting the Presidential candidacy of Libertarian, Constitutionalist who never win more than 3% of any thing.</p>
<p>Go local. Work to win. We can win, we are winning and we must win somewhere, build on successes and move on to more successes.</p>
<p>We have a great mayor of Rome, Oklahoma state house of Representatives looks good. Do it in your town and state.</p>

			<p>I hope this is a legislative trend that will catch on throughout the nation. These laws are aimed solely at illegals aliens period. Anybody harboring or aiding them needs to be arrested as they are aiding in the commission of a crime. And this would also include the churches that use these illegals to replenish their diminishing congregations and fill their collection plates.</p>

			<p>Sanctuary cities are crimes against the American people.  Those who harbor these invaders need to lose their property which needs to be auctioned off and put in a fund that will be used to help with the needed and massive deportations, hospital, criminal justice system, and other costs incrued on the American people by foreign invaders.  If a multi-million dollar church is a sanctuary then seize it.  </p>

			<p>The only thing i don&rsquo;t like about this bill is that, if passed, the illegals in Missouri will flood my home state of Illinois, where our corrupt governor does squat about the problem.</p>
