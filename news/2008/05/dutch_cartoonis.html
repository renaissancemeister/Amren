						<p>A Dutch political cartoonist was arrested this week on suspicion of insulting people because of their race or religion through his work, authorities said Friday.</p>
<p>The cartoonist, who works under the pseudonym Gregorius Nekschot, was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of violating hate speech laws and held overnight before being released, a spokeswoman for his publisher Uitgeverij Xtra said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was arrested with a great show of force, by around 10 policemen,&rdquo; the spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>She asked that her name not be used, and declined to give Nekschot&rsquo;s real name, because the cartoonist and publisher have both received death threats.</p>
<p>Nekschot is known primarily for cartoons mocking Muslims and leftists, though the spokeswoman said he is a satirist who targets &ldquo;any strong ideology.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amsterdam public prosecutor spokeswoman Sanne van Meteren said Nekschot remains a suspect in a criminal investigation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We suspect him of insulting people on the basis of their race or belief, and possibly also of inciting hate,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Each is a crime punishable by up to a year in prison under Dutch hate speech laws &mdash; or two years for multiple offenses.</p>

			<p>Poor Mrs. Whittles and her 7th grade History class. Try as she might I never learned what a carpetbagger or a scalawag was. That is until now. Using the Dutch model as an example,let me showcase my knowledge. A carpetbagger is a Muslim outsider  who comes to Holland to take advatage of its people, morally and finacially. A scalawag is a guy like the prosecutor. Helping the invader subjugate  and enslave his own people. I do remember from 40 years ago which was the more hated. One guess and carpetbagger doesn`t count.  </p>

			<p>Well, something&rsquo;s got to be done to show opposition to what one believes is destroying one&rsquo;s society. Most of the media is already swayed left. Most in politics are too scared of making someone uncomfortable with a rational decision. Countries have gotten too soft in dealing with those who are outnumbering and pushing around the natural citizens. This has all got to be a bad nightmare. <br>

			<p>I am upset.</p>
<p>How come this Dutch cartoonist got arrested for PC thought crimes for insulting the Religion of Peace and I didn&rsquo;t with my much, much more insulting, and I think funnier mockery of the 8th Century Cult of murder and mayhem?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7n731ujoR2Q" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7n731ujoR2Q</a></p>
<p>Well, I did quote the American First Amendment which is a good thing. Europeans in the cursed EU do not have the American First Amendment.</p>
<p>So I believe we should all fight tooth and nail to defend our American free speech rights even to make fun of very unfunny people like crazed, Islamic Jihadists and equally unfunny PC Eurocrats.</p>
<p>One last point:</p>
<p>I really admire all the great Dutch people on the Liberal Left who risk their jobs and their lives standing up to the Jihadist invaders and the PC thought police who take the Muslim side.</p>
<p>In particular I honor:</p>
<p>Pym Fortuyn (martyred)<br>
Theo Van Gogh (martyred)<br>
Geert Wilders (still going strong) <br>
and this cartoonist -  Gregorius Nekschot (pseudonym)</p>
<p>Keep the faith.</p>
<p>John Robinson (pseudonym - don&rsquo;t let either the Jihadists or the PC thought police get your legal name, place of employment, house of residence, credit card numbers, social security number etc)</p>

			<p>The Netherlands was one of the first countries in the West to attempt cultural suicide by embracing the third world &#8220;exotic&#8221; long before Germany, Sweden, Canada and the US. That their liberalism has crushed one of their own proves to me that you reap what you sow. </p>

			<p>I can see the Dutch government has taken &#8220;Fahrenheit 451&#8221; to heart.  How about some book burnings like the Nazis did?  All of this to protect the Muslims who have openly stated that they want to conquer the Netherlands???  The denial mentality of some Western Europeans continues to amaze me&hellip;they will not know reality until they are roasted like animals on a spit.</p>

			<p>Experience tells us that the only way to hold together a patchwork society is by force.  Start with the old Soviet Union and Yugoslavia.  And more than likely, it&rsquo;s coming to the English-speaking nations, on both sides of the Atlantic.  All in the divine name of diversity.</p>
<p>I imagine that the Dutch must be wondering why they fought a four year guerrilla war to oust the Nazis during the Second World War.  Was it Pogo who said:  &#8220;We have met the enemy, and he is us.&#8221;</p>

			<p>There are several thousand people in Europe in prison right now for &#8220;hate speech.&#8221;  The leader of the National Front and founder of the British National Party, John Tyndall, served a prison sentence for &#8220;hate speech&#8221; in the 80&rsquo;s.  This is nothing new over there and will not stop nationalism from growing.</p>

			<p>  This reminds me of Stalinist Russia where &#8220;political offenders&#8221; (Article 58) were punished much more harshly than common thieves, murderers, rapists, child molesters, etc. In fact, the criminals (urkas) were put in charge of the Gulag camps over the politicals. Evidently, according to Amsterdamsky, &#8220;hate speech&#8221; is considered a more serious crime than the rape of a young girl.</p>

That is a very good observation!   When there is no bond of blood to hold together the nation, the only binder in a  &#8220;diverse&#8221; society becomes force. It&rsquo;s inevitable.</p>
<p>As far as wondering about WW 2, some Dutch might get away with wondering privately, but I doubt they would be allowed to wonder publicly   &mdash;   although you can certainly do just about anything else in Holland, at least where sex or drugs are concerned. But don&rsquo;t mess with politics!   Don&rsquo;t touch where The Power is!</p>

			<p>Other than clucking our tongues and wringing our hands, what is there that we can do to express our disapproval of the repressive ways of the Dutch government? Unlike the Moslems who riot and apply economic pressure, we just stand aside politely and wag our heads in disapproval. We need to apply some kind of pressure too. That is what they understand, when the dollars stop coming in.  Boycott Heineken beer?  Shun Amsterdam airport?  Don&rsquo;t shop in Royal-Ahold supermarkets (Giant Foods, Stop&Shop;, etc)?   Dont buy Gouda cheese?  Shell gasoline? What can we do?<br>
Any suggestions? </p>

			<p>Sex in public parks goes against our Christian and western cultural sensibilities - so therefore they must be allowed.</p>
<p>It all makes sense if you understand that those in power in the west are the ones who want to destroy us.</p>
<p>Now of course, why would anyone want to destroy themselves? And the answer is obvious. Those behind all this in the west do not consider themselves white or Christian.</p>

Unfortunately, I do not think it is very obvious. Otherwise not so many people would be so baffled at what&rsquo;s going on.   And I don&rsquo;t think they (those in power) want to destroy THEMSELVES.  They want to destroy YOU.  They want to de-construct your entire society and remake it and replace you in the process. That&rsquo;s what is obvious.</p>

			<p>What we have here is an alliance of the Marxists on the Left with Islam. Both are ruthless, controlling, totalitarian ideologies that attract people with personality disorders both as leaders and acolytes; leaders like Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot, Sadaam Hussein and the rest. Acolytes like the Hippies, cult followers, the &#8216;citizens of the world&rsquo;, the needy, the shiftless, jobless and rootless people that having no historical grounding, no traditional religion,no guidance or morality, no racial or national allegiance,  all these types will be swayed by promises of Utopia, Heavenly rewards here on earth and Welfare from cradle to grave.  We all know how Hitler allied with Islam by promising to remove all Jews from the Middle East in return for their help; So the Left today are still selling out to whoever they can find to give them a boost to power, Bear in mind that both of these groups are members of historically ruthless and murderous ideologies,and as in the past,they both know that they can take care of any opposing views within their alliance later.<br>
 The Left will do anything for to gain power. They don&rsquo;t see nation states,races,individuals, only obstacles to one world International Socialism. They are, collectively, like those fanatical control freaks who must have everything in their home &#8216;just so&rsquo;, all the hangars lined up, every blade of grass cleaned off the mower; any deviation causes them enormous stress and angst.  It&rsquo;s a mental condition, they cannot be wrong they will never concede, they will not tolerate dissent, they cannot abide any deviation from their goal, because they KNOW, as surely as a the result of a drug induced Hippy delusion, that if only they can implement their ideology the way it really, really should be, then they will be proven correct. We individualists, realists, regular folk do not have this vision, so we are unable to recognise it, we must be shut up and fored stop meddling. If we won&rsquo;t shut up voluntarily then we will be forced to, with jail or worse, just like every other totalitarian nightmare state. </p>
<p>Our best hope is that there are still enough people like us who, thanks to the internet and talk radio etc can spread the word. No other generation in history has had this opportunity to stop oppression, lets use it.<br>
Arc.<br>

<p>That was pretty good!. Apparently the masses can be fooled, or more likely browbeaten, into thinking this is all about &#8216;tolerance&rsquo; or sensitivity or diversity, or whatever word they&rsquo;re using, or even that it&rsquo;s all about some kind of higher morality or fairness. I&rsquo;m not fooled. Isn&rsquo;t this insulting and &#8216;ridiculing&rsquo; the exact thing the left has done to whites, men, and to old fashioned values?</p>
<p>Apparently, from their viewpoint, the double standard must exist because Arabs and leftists are better people and their morals are superior to ours. If a multicultural society must come, at our expense, we should at least receive the same treatment as do the other groups making up the all-necessary multicult. That would be a good start.  </p>

<p>JR&rsquo;s slide show is nice, but &#8220;more insulting&#8221; and &#8220;more funny&#8221; than Gregorius&rsquo; cartoons? I doubt that very much. </p>
<p>Frank does not like the use of pseudonyms. Well, as long if you&rsquo;re not in Gregorius&rsquo; shoes, I suggest you refrain from judgements. The Dutch police &amp; justice have in fact signed the cartoonist&rsquo;s death sentence, that is, if it comes to a trial and his name will become public.</p>

			<p>Meanwhile 5 Moroccan &ldquo;youths&rdquo; get suspended sentences for gang raping a 15 year old Dutch girl in The Hague. </p>
<p><br>
Yet another European country on the verge of self-destruction. It&rsquo;s laws are designed to punish indigenous whites who offend non whites. Meanwhile, the coddle non white criminals. There are very few European countries I haven&rsquo;t lost respect for these days, much less a feeling of hope that they will remain European.</p>

			<p>Well, by now we know 3 of the 8 cartoons which are supposedly racist en insulting to minorities in the eyes of the Dutch justice system. They were published in a newspaper today.</p>
<p>Cartoon 1: a bearded Muslim sitting comfortably. Text: &#8216;Nowhere in the Quran it says I have to return the favour of having received sociale benefits and child allowances for 30 years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cartoon 2: A black guy pointing 2 guns at a white guy, demanding money. The white guy: &#8216;This is only the 2nd generation&rsquo;. Caption: &#8216;Dutch progressives still very optimistic.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cartoon 3: statue of white man with ethnic women on his back. Caption: &#8216;Finally a slavery monument for the white tax payer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it folks. Outrageous to have arrested an artist in his own home for this with 10 policemen and the district attorney! Outrageous to have taken his computer, cell phone and personal papers.  <br>
Some legal experts write that the justice system has no case at all. It&rsquo;s impossible to prove that Gregorius Nekschot has insulted all Muslims or all Black people.</p>
<p>The frightening aspect, apart from the attack on free speech, is that any Mohammedan fanatic will know who is behind this alias and issue a fatwa, a death sentence. We all know what that means in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>It is getting more absurd by the day.</p>
