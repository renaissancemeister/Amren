						<p>What we&rsquo;ve got here is failure to contextualize. If nothing else, Jeremiah Wright&rsquo;s defenders and enablers are right about that. To fully understand those &#8220;sound bites&#8221; and &#8220;snippets&#8221; calling on God to damn America, accusing the U.S. government of intentionally spreading HIV among blacks, and blaming 9/11 on America&rsquo;s allegedly terrorist history and foreign policy, we do need more context.</p>
<p>Far from exonerating Wright, however, removing those notorious sermon-segments from their endless video loop and firmly placing them in their social, political, historical, and theological context is even more damning (you&rsquo;ll forgive the expression) than the original YouTube videos. The full story of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright&rsquo;s theology and church adds considerable urgency to already-pressing questions about Barack Obama&rsquo;s judgment in choosing this man as his mentor and pastor.</p>
<p>Wright&rsquo;s defenders have portrayed Chicago&rsquo;s Trinity United Church of Christ as &#8220;well within the mainstream of the black church&#8221; while downplaying its militancy and politicization. In fact, Wright&rsquo;s church is not only thoroughly politicized, but is arguably the most radical black church in the country. The substance and style of Wright&rsquo;s infamous remarks are part and parcel of a broader, and proudly radical, theology. The bold denunciations are not distractions or somehow beside the point, but are the culmination and justification of Wright&rsquo;s prophetic vocation. Even his famous &#8220;Audacity to Hope&#8221; sermon, which led to Obama&rsquo;s conversion and baptism, fits into this framework.</p>
<p>A scarcely concealed, Marxist-inspired indictment of American capitalism pervades contemporary &#8220;black-liberation theology.&#8221; Far from the mainstream, Trinity (and the relatively small band of other churches that share its worldview) sees itself as marginalized and radical, struggling in the face of an overwhelming rejection of its political theology by mainstream black churches.</p>
<p><b>The Founder</b></p>
<p>James H. Cone, founder and leading light of black-liberation theology, is the Charles A. Briggs Distinguished Professor of Systematic Theology at Union Theological Seminary, New York. Wright acknowledges Cone&rsquo;s work as the basis of Trinity&rsquo;s perspective, and Cone points to Trinity as the church that best exemplifies his message. Cone&rsquo;s 1969 book <cite>Black Theology and Black Power</cite> is the founding text of black-liberation theology, predating even much of the influential, Marxist-inspired liberation theology that swept Latin America in the 1970s. Cone&rsquo;s work is repeatedly echoed in Wright&rsquo;s sermons and statements. While Wright and Cone differ on some minor issues, Cone&rsquo;s theology is the first and best place to look for the intellectual context within which Wright&rsquo; s views took shape.</p>
<p>Cone credits Malcolm X &mdash; particularly his famous dismissal of Christianity as the white man&rsquo;s religion &mdash; with shaking him out of his theological complacency. In Malcolm&rsquo;s words: &#8220;The white man has brainwashed us black people to fasten our gaze upon a blond-haired, blue-eyed Jesus! We&rsquo;re worshiping a Jesus that doesn&rsquo;t even look like us! Oh, yes! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The blond-haired, blue-eyed white man has taught you and me to worship a white Jesus, and to shout and sing and pray to this God that&rsquo;s his God, the white man&rsquo;s God. The white man has taught us to shout and sing and pray until we die, to wait until death, for some dreamy heaven-in-the-hereafter .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. while this white man has his milk and honey in the streets paved with golden dollars here on this earth!??&#8221; In the late 1960s, Malcolm X&rsquo;s criticisms (Wright calls them &#8220;devastating&#8221;) were adopted by the founders of the black-power movement, such as Stokely Carmichael, the Black Panthers, and Ron Karenga. Shaken by Malcolm&rsquo;s rejection of Christianity and taken with the movement for black power, Cone, a young theologian and initially a devout follower of Martin Luther King Jr., set out to reconcile black power with Christianity. He did not reject Malcolm&rsquo;s disdain for a &#8220;blond-haired, blue-eyed Jesus&#8221; &mdash; rather, he came to believe that Jesus was black, and that an authentic Christianity, grounded in Jesus&rsquo;s blackness, would focus with full force on black liberation. Authentic Christianity would bring radical social and political transformation and, if necessary, violent revolution in the here and now.</p>
<p>Cone understood his task as both &#8220;radical&#8221; and &#8220;prophetic.&#8221; It was radical in demanding deep transformation in the structure of society and prophetic in its determinedly angry and denunciatory tone. Black Theology and Black Power, says Cone in the book&rsquo;s introduction, is &#8220;written with a definite attitude, the attitude of an angry black man.&#8221; Cone demands and commends anger, criticizes contemporary theologians for the &#8220;coolness&#8221; of their writings, and notes that &#8220;there is some evidence that Jesus got angry.&#8221; In the book, Cone sometimes addresses or refers to whites as simply &#8220;the oppressor&#8221; or &#8220;Whitey.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;The blond-haired, blue-eyed white man has taught you and me to worship a white Jesus, and to shout and sing and pray to this God that&rsquo;s his God, the white man&rsquo;s God.&#8221;</p>
<p>Has anybody ever seen a Jesus icon with blond hair and blue eyes?  Me neither.  It&rsquo;s really ludicrous that these black morons fixate so much on blond hair and blue eyes. </p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s blacks or Linda Chavez speaking of a blond Jesus, condemning whites for depicting him as in their image, or whether it&rsquo;s the moronic black haters, both groups make it unequivocally clear that it is in their image that they insist that Jesus be cast, because they refuse to honor ANYONE who doesn&rsquo;t look like them, because they&rsquo;re so biased and racist in favor of their own tribal members they could never really accept anyone different from them.</p>
<p>Honoring Jesus, and depicting him as what he truly was, which is a Semitic caucasoid, would be unbearable for them.  He must be mestizo or black or he&rsquo;s unworthy of their worship.</p>
<p>There is much racism and hate throughout this country, but it is mostly centered in the non-white tribal factions, which makes me even more disgusted when I hear those pigs whine about white racism, which has never come close to touching their sorry lives.</p>

			<p>I very much doubt Jesus was blond-haired and blue-eyed.  Since he was a Palestinian Jew, Jesus would likely have had black hair and brown eyes.  In short, he would have looked like a Greek or southern Italian.</p>
<p>As a non-Christian who regards Jesus Christ as an important historical figure but not someone who can &#8220;save&#8221; my soul, it is fairly easy to be objective about him.  He was angry about the abuses of the Hebrew clergy - like moneylenders operating out of the temples.  Unless I am terribly mistaken, he never intended to start his own religion, much less be worshipped.</p>
<p>He was anything but the &#8220;Prince of Peace&#8221;.  One of my favorites of his quotes is &#8220;Let he who has no sword sell his clothes and buy one.&#8221;  My own ancestors at that time, much to the northwest, fought naked after getting ripped on hallucinogenic liquor and painting themselves with woad, so that quote stands out.  The Romans didn&rsquo;t like their habit of eating defeated enemies, either.  Eventually the Romans had to build a wall to keep them out, which still closely defines the border between England and Scotland.</p>
<p>My understanding of Christianity is that Jesus Christ is the son of the same Allmighty who created the universe and everything in it.  As such, Christ would be inherently non-racial, unless he was chosen to be made that way.  Did the Creator - because even science breaks down before Planck Time, so there will never be any way of knowing what caused the universe - make Christ an olive-skinned Meditteranean Caucasian on purpose, or was it an &#8220;accident&#8221; because he had two parents who looked more or less like him?</p>
<p>If I were all-powerful and all-knowing, I would design a &#8220;savior&#8221; for my creations a little differently.  I&rsquo;d have arranged that My Message should be heeded, rather than My Messenger worshipped.</p>
<p>Reverend Wright obviously hates whites, and he uses his religion as an excuse - that is all it is - to propogate his hatred.  Even the Jesus Christ he imagines he serves wouldn&rsquo;t want that.</p>

<p>Discussing this mans rants is as nonsensical as the rants themselves.</p>
<p>The points he puts forth are so unintelligent and illogical they&rsquo;re not worthy of discussion.  His theology is a rambling discourse of unclear, confused, unintelligent babble. </p>
<p>To write about it, except for ridiculing and informing people how stupid and illogical it is, is really a waste of time and ink.</p>

<p>Anyone here should know the answers. No and yes. There is no need to explain the first, and as to the second: National Review has been senile longer than its favorite hero was. So no one should be surprised that its views show arrested development.</p>

			<p>One good thing (there are many) that has come from the Rev. Wright controversy is that it has helped to magnify or at least add proportion to the equally goofy beliefs of people who regularly write for National Review and other mainstream rags. </p>

			<p>What&rsquo;s scary is not that an angry deranged man like Mr Wright goes off like he does, but that thousands and thousands of people follow after him, join his church, and applaud his rants.  I&rsquo;d like Time Magazine or something to do an expose on &#8216;Inside the Black Church&rsquo;.  Is Wright an aberration or the norm?</p>

<p>This conspiracy theory of the white man teaching Christianity in order to suppress blacks is indicative of the black man&rsquo;s paranoid delusions. What religion does NOT teach about an afterlife? How about Islam with its 72 virgins? I have heard rants like this many times from blacks and they are ALWAYS riddled with logical fallacies. I gave up trying to reason with them a long time ago as I realized it is impossible, especially when they get excited (which is often at the drop of a hat).</p>

			<p>In the meantime, no doubt encouraged by this kind of relentless black racist lunatic HATE propaganda, on a daily basis all across this country there are unspeakable black racial atrocities committed against people of light, stories hidden by the media. Just a taste of what is going on in the streets of America, completely censored:<br>
Last month in Indianapolis, a white teller, pregnant with twins, was deliberately and senselessly shot in the abdomen by two blacks for no reason at all: Her twin white unborn babies died and she is now clinging to life.<br>
Last month a Chinese graduate student at Columbia University, Minghui Yu, was attacked for no reason by a racist black mob who chased him into traffic where he was killed.<br>
Last October in Philadelphia a black by the name of Mustafa Ali shot two white armored car guards, Joseph Alullo and William Widmaier, from behind, execution style.<br>
Last December in Lake Wales FL, near Orlando a black male by the name of Leon Davis kidnapped two Hispanic female strangers, Juanita Luciano (23) and Ivonne Bustamante (26 and pregnant), locked them in a room, doused them down with a flammable liquid AND BURNED THEM ALIVE!!! This black male, Leon Davis, has been responsible for a LONG STRING of attacks and robberies upon Hispanics in the area. A week earlier he murdered two Asian Indian Hindus in Lake Alfred FL.</p>
<p>You tell me, WHO are the REAL racial OPPRESSORS in this country today?<br>

<p>The name of the 30 year old white female victim, who was 5 month&rsquo;s pregnant when deliberately shot specifically in her bulging abdomen by the two black racist killers, was Katherin Shuffield. In case you want to google the horrible details about this yet another atrocity committed by black racist street terrorists.</p>

			<p>This guy is truly a false preacher, because when talking of &#8220;Whites&#8221; he only discusses what he believes to be their  negative aspects. How about the positivie aspects? What kind of religion is Wright talking about that is so one-sided? It would be like considering God(the good one) without considering the devil,(the evil one)his opposite. It is easy to discern why Wright does this  &mdash;  he is addicted to hating everything he considers to have a connection with &#8220;White People&#8221;. But I&rsquo;m sure non of it rubbed off on Obama, after twenty years of his attending Wrights Church. Noooo waaay. Just couldn&rsquo;t be.</p>

<p>Huh?  If they are not in the mainstream of black churches they certainly in the maintream of black rhetoric.  Anyone with any experience with Chicago blacks would probably agree.  This is why the issue will not go away.</p>

			<p>Jesus, whether blonde-haired, blue eyed or not, is the Savior of our souls.  &#8220;No one comes unto the Father except through me.&#8221;  were his words.  </p>
<p>Had I been sitting in a church for 20 years listening to these hate-filled sermons, I would have left a long time ago.  Should the pastor of my church ever start sermonizing from the pulpit that homosexuality is an alternative lifestyle, should my church begin marrying and recognizing same sex unions, I would leave that church.</p>
<p>While horrible things have been perpetrated in the name of Christianity, no other living soul has had more influence on the world than Jesus Christ.  </p>
<p>As with all things, it is much easier to destroy from within than from the outside.  I see these black radical churches and churches that are now recognizing homosexual unions as nothing more than an infiltration by those who wish to destroy the church and it&rsquo;s moral teachings from within.</p>

<p>Well, I for one am ready to admit they&rsquo;ve finally found us out, so we might as well admit this easy life of luxury we&rsquo;ve been living at the expense of blacks has got to change, because we have oppressed them enough.</p>
<p>No more going through life getting things handed to us while blacks slave away in school, if you will pardon the expression,  earning multiple degrees, getting qualified as skilled craftsmen, yet never being able to get ahead because of evil whites.</p>
<p>Well, it couldn&rsquo;t last forever.  Now it is the black man&rsquo;s turn.  We have to take our collective foot off their necks and let them partake of all this easy living on our golden streets for a while.</p>
<p>As for me, I&rsquo;m going to sit under the big oak shade tree, drink a mint julep, while I watch the neighborhood blacks toiling away, trying to make a living, doing work they&rsquo;re over qualified for, because whites have all the good jobs, which they got by picking up the phone and talking to another like-minded white.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I might take my yacht out or fly to Monte Carlo and play Baccarat, I&rsquo;m not sure yet.  But whatever I decide it will be something that is easy and luxurious, because that&rsquo;s the normal white lifestyle.  </p>

			<p>Rev. Wright teachs race hate.  He provides the justification for black folks to murder white folks. Not that it takes very much.</p>
<p>When he says &#8220;America&#8221; has done something evil, he means &#8220;white people&#8221;.  He uses this euphemism when he speaks to mixed audiences.  When he is being direct (i.e. speaking to predominately black audiences such as the NAACP) he can drop the pretense and speak plainly of &#8220;the white man&#8221; or &#8220;white people&#8221;.</p>
<p>They share his hate and enjoy his racial attacks. Black folks like their racism straight and unalloyed with the base hypocrisy of euphemism.</p>

			<p>Whether this rubbed off on Obama is irrelevant.  He had his children at these services, when as a adult, he should have known better and as a parent he should have cared what his daughters were being raised to think.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad someone else here realizes that what Reverend Wright and those like him say about &#8220;white devils&#8221; has real consequences for innocent men, women and children.</p>
<p>If it was Jews Wright hated so much, Obama&rsquo;s campaign would have been stillborn, but it is Jews, too.  Without the exhortation of folks like Wright, Louis Farrakhan and Jesse Jackson, an innocent young man named Yankel Rosenbaum, a Hassidic Jew in traditional attire who could not possibly have been mistaken for anything else, would not have been beaten to death by a black mob.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;A scarcely concealed, Marxist-inspired indictment of American capitalism pervades contemporary &lsquo;black-liberation theology.&rsquo; Far from the mainstream, Trinity (and the relatively small band of other churches that share its worldview) sees itself as marginalized and radical, struggling in the face of an overwhelming rejection of its political theology by mainstream black churches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here, we must ask ourselves two very important questions. </p>
<p>The first being, that in understanding that Marxism is a total rejection of God and all civilized principles, how could any form of it, this &ldquo;black-liberation theology&rdquo; nonsense or so-called multiculturalism included, be anything other than undiluted 200 proof evil? </p>
<p>The second being, that given Comrade Obama&rsquo;s strong support of this church, where Marxism and not Christianity is the coin of the &ldquo;rectory,&rdquo; and that this Comrade Reverend Wright who lives there is his &ldquo;spiritual father&rdquo; and mentor, just how dangerous and malevolent is he? This second query, should be taken within the full context of asking why the &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; media (a secularized  Marxist and viciously anti-white multicultural propaganda oracle, if there ever was one) has rapturously continued to embrace Comrade Obama in the face of this religious/political  abyss of his? Moreover, one must further ask why there also has been this excruciatingly: slow, surgical, and obsessive conducting of a very sterile and  forced amputation of Comrade Wright away from Comrade Obama&rsquo;s political body, and the equally agonizing and ongoing methodical autopsy of this Red voodoo guru he originally found his epiphany with, by those same multicultural &ldquo;high priests&rdquo; in the &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; media?</p>
<p>The answer to the first question, might seem obvious to most regular AR readers but to newcomers, it may not? That is why it must be reviewed here. In short, to all those befuddled by or unread in Marxist secular &ldquo;theology,&rdquo; it all boils down to the &ldquo;proletariat&rdquo; or working/producing classes, overthrowing the &ldquo;bourgeoisie and aristocracies&rdquo; (respectively the middle and upper class owners of the means of production, and their more entrenched noble/royal landed predecessors) through an &ldquo;enlightened&rdquo; revolutionary or hyper-Darwinian &ldquo;class struggle,&rdquo; that will see a utopia of equality achieved by the semi-educated through the uneducated. Or put another way, the &ldquo;intellectualized&rdquo;  drones will violently dispose of the rest of the hive through the worker bees, and cease to be drones and become honey queens all, by way of abilities and needs more droningly calculated at the expense of the now worker camp bees. </p>
<p>Laughably arrogant and at best adolescent in appeal, it is a form of abhorrently bizarre socioeconomic and political &ldquo;theocracy&rdquo; that appeals to the most disaffected and perplexed in the upper and middle classes, who then infect like a particularly virulent malignancy the working and lower classes in any society, with their doppelganger angst of avaricious morbidity. </p>
<p>Multiculturalism, works much the same way; it is godless and plundering in an ever so &ldquo;fashionable&rdquo; manner, that allows middle and upper class whites in the West to feel sanctimoniously and hypocritically good about themselves at the expense of those &ldquo;ignorant&ldquo; whites: below, equal to, or above them, who lack their &ldquo;enlightenment&rdquo; regarding all pigmented persons. It also gives the added thrill of &ldquo;romanticizing&rdquo; and &ldquo;empowering,&rdquo; these less able and more loutish nonwhite aliens then themselves, to &ldquo;work&rdquo; toward achieving their &ldquo;utopia of equality&rdquo; through obliteration.</p>
<p>In summary, it is all audaciously &ldquo;hopeful,&rdquo; but also abominably apocalyptic, in translation from primordial &ldquo;theory&rdquo; to evolving, if also, &ldquo;unperfected practice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second question, which must be peeled like an onion, is best begun at the core, so that the outer layers fall away more rapidly.</p>
<p>A.) Why are these &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; media types, so suddenly focused on the Comrade Reverend Wright&rsquo;s obviously: anti-white, anti-American, and anti-Western political/religious pathogens? That on the surface is easy answer, as it provides a cloyingly ebony-gray reflection of both their most sincerely embraced affirmative assumptions about themselves, along with their most despondently recognized truths about nonwhites, which they refuse to admit publicly. Two primary examples of this are MSNBC&rsquo;s Chris Matthews the host of &ldquo;Hardball&rdquo; and  Mika Brzezinski co-host  with Joe Scarborough on the show &ldquo;Morning Joe.&rdquo; Both of these fools gush and simper like smitten schoolgirls (in Comrade Matthews&rsquo; case it is particularly nauseating to watch) over Comrade Obama; both of these swine squeal and whimper openly, when a crucial primary such as Ohio or Pennsylvania goes to Hillary. Both of these multicultural propagandists also, seem to be simply fascinated with and constantly &ldquo;explaining away&rdquo; the Comrade Reverend Wright&rsquo;s endless gift for racial &ldquo;faux pas.&rdquo;  </p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>It reflects, both their: sadistic racial hatreds of fellow whites, and their equally masochistic Marxist proclivities; it also simmers that mentally dichotomist casserole into a particularly mushy stew, that is more easily digestible by them. By focusing on Comrade Reverend Wright&rsquo;s absurd positions, they &ldquo;analyze&rdquo; and &ldquo;process&rdquo; their own equally absurd conjectures. Hence, they may realize the good Comrade Reverend Wright is a hateful freak and is destroying their mulatto demigod for his own purposes, but they also find succor in the fact that he is more an oddity than they, or the mulatto they would have be Zeus of a sullied pantheon.</p>
<p>B.) Next comes the rapture.</p>
<p>Comrade General Secretary  &mdash;  to be  &mdash;  Obama, has distanced himself from the Comrade Reverend Wright&rsquo;s positions; that at least, is what the Chris Matthews and  Mika Brzezinskis of the world would have us believe. They certainly seem to want our beliefs here, as well as our audacious hopes too? However, they continue to enjoy the spectacle of the little dog and pony show Comrade Reverend Wright offers, even if it hurts Comrade General Secretary  &mdash;  to be  &mdash;  Obama and the plausibility of his growingly aggressive denunciations, of at least those dogs and ponies in the Comrade Reverend Wright&rsquo;s tent of championed anti-white terrorism. </p>
<p>Here we have the core of their sickness, they understand right from wrong, only they still refuse to accept that wrong cannot ever be right, or Wright.</p>
<p>C.) Finally, the circle closes.</p>
<p>Comrade General Secretary  &mdash;  to be  &mdash;  Obama, is a ghastly threat to Western Civilization in the USA; he is an aberrational nonentity that is expected of, and also typifies, our times. Where he does have convictions, they are all steeped in a bloody godlessness Marxism, that masks as Christianity. That is what we are to have as our president in 2008?</p>
<p>It shouldn&rsquo;t be, but it could be; it would be the accumulation of Marxist stupidity that has been the vanguard of what passes for &ldquo;thought,&rdquo; that has marked the last 62 years!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!</p>

You will see God and Adam.</p>
<p>They are definitely white.</p>
<p>Not even vaguely Semitic.</p>
<p>But yet, that God pictured is Y*HW*H.</p>
<p>The creator of the Hebrews.</p>
<p>The God of Abraham.</p>
<p>Not the creator of Prometheus, Yggdrasil, Buddha.</p>
<p>Not the God of Kunta-Kinta.</p>
<p>Only a true multiculturalist would insist on everybody having the same God.</p>
<p>Let the brothers have their afro-Jesus.</p>
<p>Instead of dying on a cross, afro-Jesus dies in a fusillade of bullets.</p>
<p>Before getting all insulted, let me ask you a couple of questions. Would you accept yourself as being in God&rsquo;s image if God looked like Snoop Dog? Would you accept Christ as your personal savior if he resembled 50 Cent? Somehow I really doubt it. And if it makes no difference, then you should have no problem with putting a black man in the White House.</p>

<p>The videos came from DVDs that were purchased from the church&rsquo;s website, therefore I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s very likely that the camera crew was black. </p>

			<p>I had read where Jesus did have blue eyes and brownish hair lightened by the sun. He had perfect skin and features. There, of course, are those that will dispute this for their own agendas. Flavius Josephus has written a description among two others of that day. The usual suspects try to tell us it is not true and try to discredit that document as a &#8220;forgery&#8221;, etc. </p>

<p>I am not a Christian, and I do not believe Our Creator was clothed in human flesh.  The glory of kindness was given to us as a gift, but not to us alone.  Have you ever seen a mother bird fight to protect her nest?  Have you watched robins mob a hawk?</p>
<p>I once saw one of the worst men in the world risk his life to save someone else.  He was a child-abuser and a wife-beater, and he didn&rsquo;t hesitate.</p>
<p>Our Creator gave us the powe of independant thinking.  We can imagine He looks like anything.  By definition, He can do anything He wants.</p>

			<p>      I grew up Catholic. And during the decade of my youth and<br>
the decades previous to that, Jesus was always portrayed with<br>
light brown hair and blue eyes. Not semetic at all but very <br>
Northern European. Is this &#8220;blonde&#8221;? I never thought so, but as<br>
our society darkens, even light brown hair is now called blonde.<br>
There are very few blonde men anymore and even though women are<br>
blonder than men apparently, many of them are of course, fake.<br>
      Spiritually, people have the &#8220;right&#8221; to portray Jesus as<br>
their own race. But factually, he was a semite and unlikely to<br>
have light hair and definely not Black at all. Some say the Gal-<br>
ileans had foreign, possibly Celtic blood. So the light hair is<br>
possible but unproven at best.</p>

			<p>This is a letter that I had planned to send to Murray Weiss of the NY Post regarding the Smiley Face killings that have gained quite a bit of attention as of late. I trust that all AMREN readers are aware of these deaths, over 100 young male, mostly White college students have been found drowned in what were originally beleived to be accidental deaths related to excessive alcohol consumption. two NYPD detectives (I believe  retired) have taken it upon themselves to investigate these deaths and have come to the conclusion that these were murders. I decided not to send the letter by email because my address contains my name and due to the Social Fascist society in which we live it seemed imprudent.</p>
<p>Mr. Weiss,<br>
I&rsquo;ve been following this &#8220;Smiley Face&#8221; killing story for several weeks now. Has anyone considered what seems to me to be an obvious pattern? Reports state that at least ninety percent of the victims are White. No mention has been made of the other ten percent. The only deaths discussed seem to be the ones involving White college students. Given the PC climate today I can&rsquo;t help but suspect that the other ten percent is merely a red herring to dispel any suspicion on the part of the public that this is a campaign directed against White males, who have lately been demonized as the most evil group on the face of the earth.<br>
If the victims had all been Black there would be an immediate investigation into the possibility that some White supremacist group was responsible and that these killings were definitely hate crimes.<br>
Given the fact that there is a precedent for anti- White crimes such as the Zebra killings and the Yaweh murders and when you have hate mongers such as the &#8220;Reverend&#8221; Wright, Luis Farrakhan and his acolyte, the late Khalid Muhammed and  countless others like the so called &#8220;Professor&#8221; Kambon  who in a speech, called for the extermination of the White race from the earth, I am surprised that this angle hasn&rsquo;t received any public attention.</p>
<p><br>
I&rsquo;d like to get your feedback on this subject. As far as I know there hasn&rsquo;t been an article on AMREN concerning these killings.</p>

			<p>There is no healing in this Wright character, only more animosity between the races. This is all done to enrich himself and the Shartons and Jacksons. I watched a good portion of his NAACP speech and National press conference and just could not believe what was passing for intelligence, and all the people present applauding this bafoon. Had Obama not become a presidential candidate, Wright would be unknown beyond his pulpit of race hate. </p>

			<p>Here in Memphis, I had the pleasure of knowing a man who sat on the City Council. He was a Christian gentleman. And the whole time I knew the man, he had no hate for anyone. He was a fellow American and a Southerner. I only wish we had millions more just like him. He stepped down from his seat on the City Council to become Bishop of the Church of God in Christ (COGIC), which I understand is based in Memphis. His name was Gilbert Patterson and he represented all that was good in the black church in America, many of which are Baptist.</p>
<p>Rev. Wright and Trinity does not represent the black church in America, nor are they an example of the black church. It is a terrible insult to suggest that Trinity (and Wright) are merely typical of the black church. This is not true. Trinity is no more Christian than Malcolm X and Louis Farakhan. They are heretics and blasphemers. It speaks volumes that Obama did not become &#8220;Christian&#8221; until he joined Trinity. He is still not a Christian.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Cone credits Malcolm X &mdash; particularly his famous dismissal of Christianity as the white man&rsquo;s religion &mdash; with shaking him out of his theological complacency. In Malcolm&rsquo;s words: &ldquo;The white man has brainwashed us black people to fasten our gaze upon a blond-haired, blue-eyed Jesus!&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
People like Cone come a dime a dozen&hellip;.he only used a snipped of Malcolm X ( who was killed because the truth of God was revealed to him and it contradicted the falsehoods of the so-called prophet Elijah Mohammed who used Allah to further his reign of deception) to further his own personal political agenda.</p>
<p>Malcolm X also said that &ldquo;you can blame a man for knocking you down but you can&rsquo;t blame him if you refuse to get up.&rdquo; But they forgot about this because it would do away with the victicrat mentality which is big business for the so-called (black) elite.</p>
<p>Cone and his fellow travelers like Mr. Wright are 21 Century hypocrites obsessed with race and power. They will use everything at their disposal including crippling the minds of the innocent to satisfy their selfish desires. Sound authoritarian to me&hellip;.the same mindset that Jesus was up against in his days. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care about what Jesus looked like&hellip;.the facts is that he warned us about the Pharisees and the hypocrites who followed the letter of the law while at the same time violating the spirit of the law. He sacrificed himself and established a new covenant to set us free from tyranny and ask us to worship God in spirit and in truth to bring an end to the inhumane divide and conquer among his brethren&hellip;..that&rsquo;s good enough for me&hellip;..and I say Glory to the Christ!<br>

			<p>If our leaders were truly interested in confronting and removing racism from our society, they could do it by simply confronting everybody over racist attitudes and not just whites.  The political correctness surrounding race issues is all about undermining and sabotaging the liberties of the white majority by kowtowing to the bigotry of minorities and facilitated by exploiting the obsessive inferiority complexes of women of and gays to build an effective anti-white, anti-male, anti-family coalition in the public.</p>
<p>Once the majority has been disempowered and isolated like family-oriented white men have become, it is easy for a small group of elites to rob everybody blind.  Divide and conquer, redivide and maintain.  The core institution of cohesive, white families that built this nation is all but dead.  Nobody can fully trust anybody any more, including those under their own roofs.</p>

			<p>For all the visceral hatred of whites that Wright (who looks more white than black himself) has preached, he is now moving into a 2 million dollar mansion his church bought for him in a lily white super rich gated community, as far from those blacks he used to preach to as he could get: And the gates will KEEP them out, just to make sure. He is also getting something like a 10 MILLION DOLLAR stipend from his church.<br>
Wright is a snake oil salesman: And is snake oil was RACIAL HATRED. Something that always sells in the black community.<br>

<p>Ummm, no. First. Jesus was NOT a Palestinian Jew, as the term &#8220;Jew&#8221; did not appear in the Bible until the 17th Century! </p>
<p>Secondly, the people that call themselves &#8220;Jews&#8221; today, have clearly stated (by their own!) that the &#8220;Jew&#8221; of Today is not ETHNICALLY/GENETICALLY related to the Bibilical Hebrews of former eras (Freedman, Koestler, the Encyclopedia Judaica)</p>

<p>Yes and Mayor Mike Nutter called again for more gun control when in fact what is needed in Philadelphia and beyond is Black Male control. And that&rsquo;s something that will never be acknowleged by any politician.  This country is quickly becoming Zimbabwe West vis a vis the ever increasing violence level on the part of Blacks. When the immigration of the lowest rung of Mexican and Central American society is thrown into the mix, it&rsquo;s a recipe for disaster. The only end that I can see will be all out civil conflict between the races.<br>
White Americans need to be at DEFCON 5. There&rsquo;s no time to lose.</p>

Yes, blacks are  simply obsessed with it.  It reveals their mental unhealth.</p>
<p>In artistic depictions, holy figures are shown through the artist&rsquo;s eye, according to however he envisions them. You can portray them any way you wish.  Every picture is different. There is no official picture of Jesus!  No one  is forcing such an image upon anyone.  Most paintings show him with European features simply because most painters were Europeans, and that was the look that they knew. </p>
<p>In fact, it happens that there are shrines to the Black Madonna in countries such as Spain, France, and Poland. I don&rsquo;t hear anyone  protesting against this. A statue can be in any color.   These are only artistic representations.  Whites don&rsquo;t get upset about this. Who are the real racists here, anyway?</p>

			<p>This rabble-rousing  fool (Wright) who has attracted so much fame,  power, and even wealth, has probably never worked at a useful, productive job one day in his life.  He should be recognized for what he is:  a troublemaker and a parasite.  </p>
<p>These charlatans are the fools that gullible blacks put on a pedestal and make rich. What does that say about THEM?</p>

			<p>The blond-haired blue-eyed white man? What a kook. Just how many white people in the past have had blond hair along with blue eyes? What an ignorant statement that perfectly reveals the mentality of this &#8220;preacher&#8221;.</p>
