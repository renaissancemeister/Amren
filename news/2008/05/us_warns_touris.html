<h1>US Warns Tourists of &lsquo;Small-Unit Combat&rsquo; at Mexico Border</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Penny Starr, Cyber News Service, May 16, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The U.S. State Department has issued an alert, warning travelers that the &#8220;equivalent to military small-unit combat&#8221; is taking place across the southern U.S. border in Mexico and that Americans are being kidnapped and murdered there.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The State Department particularly urged that Americans be wary when traveling in that part of Mexico closest to the United States. &#8220;U.S. citizens are urged to be especially alert to safety and security concerns when visiting the border region,&#8221; said the alert.</p>
<p>Murder and kidnapping of Americans has become routine in Tijuana, which sits just across the border from San Diego, California, according to the State Department, and sometimes heavily armed attackers wear the uniforms of the Mexican police or military.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The alert also warns Americans to avoid areas where drugs and prostitution are evident and to &#8220;refrain from displaying expensive-looking jewelry, large amounts of money and other valuable items.&#8221;</p>

Dozens of Americans Murdered or Kidnapped on our border in 2007? </p>
<p>Murder of Americans &#8220;routine&#8221;!? </p>
<p>Small unit combat along our border? Combatants wearing police and military uniforms? If it wasn&rsquo;t a U.S. Government warning I would have thought this was a press release from some tin-foil hat cult predicting the end of the world.</p>
<p>NOTHING about this in the MSM! </p>

			<p>I was on a Navy ship that put into Acapulco in the late 1940&rsquo;s. The first thing I noticed was the stench. I always walked through the cities I visited while in the service. I figured I would see and know more about them than if I had taken a cab. I walked from the dock up to the spot where the cliff divers put on their show. I noticed that I was being followed the whole way by two men. As I was about to reboard my ship. one of the men came up to me and introduced himself. It turned out that he was a cop. They had orders to follow every American sailor to make sure no harm came to any of them. He explained that Acapulco was located in the state of Guerrero. It was known as the &rsquo; bandit state&rsquo; because of the frequent robberies of foreign tourists. So, even then, Mexico was an almost lawless place. I never went back there.</p>

			<p>So now we have an ungovernable zone similar to the Tribal Territories of Pakistan right on our border.  The problem is very similar to the one our troops face in Afghanistan, everyone knows that our enemies are encamped in Pakistan but we can&rsquo;t cross the border and deal with them without risking further destabilization of our &#8220;ally&#8221;.  We have continuously ignored repeated incursions across our border by the out of control renegade Mexican military units because our current political leaders lack the resolve to enforce our borders.  What will it take to awaken the American people to the fact that we have been betrayed by the elites that run this country?  </p>
<p>Even our PRESIDENT clearly does not believe in the sovereignty that he has sworn to protect.  In EIGHT years he has not done a single thing to strengthen our border with Mexico and protect this country from the chaos.   The leaders of our nation in both parties have sold out to the international corporations that have left American behind in their endless search for cheaper labor and less restriction on their activities.  American is rapidly becoming an empty shell, no factories, no decent jobs, nothing but debt as we all continue to consume like we were still the most productive nation in the world.  Meanwhile the country falls apart around us.  What will it take before we can name these globalist, socialist and liberal &#8220;useful idiots&#8221; TRAITORS to our nation? </p>
<p>The chaos that is northern Mexico is mirrored in hundreds of cities across our land where the hordes of illegal immigrants have brought their culture of crime and reconquista.    Already there are areas in all of our cities that are not safe for white Americans to enter, places that for all practical purposes are barely governed.  Tell me this doesn&rsquo;t sound like any city in this country: </p>
<p>&#8220;The alert also warns Americans to avoid areas where drugs and prostitution are evident and to &ldquo;refrain from displaying expensive-looking jewelry, large amounts of money and other valuable items.&rdquo;&#8221; </p>
<p>Nor are we guiltless in allowing things to reach this point.  Everyone that has ever purchased illegal drugs has helped to fund the Narco-terrorists cabals that have turned northern Mexico into a war zone.   Everyone that has voted for a liberal democrat or republican sell outs like McCain or Bush has tacitly approved the globalist agenda of the destruction of our national sovereignty, the erasure of our borders and the destruction of America&rsquo;s white majority and culture. </p>
<p>We need to wake up and build a new white nationalist political party in this nation.  You can start by voting for a third party candidate in November.  Don&rsquo;t just stay home as the pollsters and analyst will just count you as part of the brain dead sleeping majority.  Write your local legislators and let them know that we will no longer accept Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb candidates.  Talk to your misguided &#8220;Reagan democrat&#8221; friends and let them know that we need their help.</p>

			<p>Excellent article, Enough. We have a President and elected officials who&rsquo;ve sacrificed us to the greed of big business. And they simply don&rsquo;t care. &#8220;Traitors&#8221; is the correct word to use. Years ago, when we had responsible leaders, these people would have been publically condemmed and brought to justice. Now the people with the authority to do that, are the ones committing the crime of not &#8220;protecting and defending&#8221; this country and its citizens..</p>

			<p>I can add but one point to that excellent post by &#8220;Enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barak Obama, Hillary Clinton AND McCain ALL are pro-open border, pro-Amnesty! BECAUSE ALL THREE OF THESE WHORES pocket substantial campaign contributions from big business interests&hellip; who need, who demand access to unlimited cheap labor. Those endless cries from growers&hellip; &#8220;the food will rot if we can&rsquo;t get Mexican pickers&#8221;&hellip; </p>
<p>What NO ONE stops to realize is that of those millions of illegal immigrants&hellip; damned few, a miniscule percentage, will actually work very long, if at all, for the agricultural concerns. Instead, they go to where the pay is better, the work less demanding, the welfare handouts more readily available!</p>
<p>Like that amnesty bill Feinstein is trying to sneak in. NO guarantee the &#8216;temporary&rsquo; workers will ever be temporary, much less working ONLY at what they&rsquo;re supposed to be allowed to come here to do.</p>
<p>I hate to say it, but this country is becoming ripe for a revolution. To restore the concept of an American government, OF THE PEOPLE, FOR THE PEOPLE, AND BY THE PEOPLE! To bring back our Constitution that so many Americans suffered and died for in during the Revolutionary War. Not government by a pack of greedy whores working for the special interest groups, whatever their name might be!<br>

			<p>Good grief!  Is this what our grand-fathers stormed the beaches of Normandy for?  Looking at the US and Europe today I must say that in many ways I just don&rsquo;t see what the point of fighting in WW I &amp; II was for.  Those sacrifices have been squandered away.  This is absolutely outrageous that our leaders allow such things. America is not being run by Americans but by soul-less globalists intent on fragmenting the America our forefathers toiled to create.</p>

			<p>This is a low intensity conflict that has gotten larger with each passing year, and, because of the tremendous amounts of money to be made in drugs, it will contine on at it&rsquo;s accelerated pace.</p>
<p>Drug money once ruled Columbia almost entirely during Pablo Escobar&rsquo;s hey day, but it still is rife throughout the government and at all levels of society and could achieve the almost total control it once had.   Mexican drug strife is now growing in the same manner as Columbia did years ago, but the one great difference is that the drug gangs in Mexico are more numerous, better armed, and mimic the unconscionable viciousness of Escobar, if not surpassing his evil in many ways.  </p>
<p>Too, the Mexican gangs have numerous troops besides the Zetas who have been trained in the military, which gives them a bit of an edge when comparing them to the Columbians.</p>
<p>Right now, drug money is in the pockets of politicians on the US side up many miles north of the border, and gang influence is getting incrementally stronger every year in the US as well.</p>
<p>All this, with the help of multiculturalism, the US carcass is dying, and the vultures are now gathering to wait their opportunity to pick the bones clean.</p>

			<p>What does Fred Reed have to say about this?  I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;d dismiss it as more hyper-ventilating by uptight WASP Nervous Nellies who just aren&rsquo;t as savvy about the slightly more colorful and rough-hewn areas of the world as he is.</p>

			<p>Americans visiting Mexico do so at their own risk. Government AND police alike are steeped in corruption. Bribery the accepted way of life. Travel to Mexico and you might as well wear a sign on your back: &#8220;I&rsquo;m a rich Gringo. Feel free to rob me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mexicans being such notorious thieves to begin with, it&rsquo;s only natural for them to seek wealthier prey&hellip;  Americans carrying money, jewelry, driving American cars&hellip; the prey of choice.</p>
<p>What amazes me is the number of gullible Americans also taking cruise liners. Rape and robbery of vulnerable (female) passengers by low paid third-world crewmembers far from unheard of. (The operators and travel agents cooperating in hiding this from the general public. Bad for business, you understand.) But it DOES happen. And, based on several stories in our newspapers over the last few years&hellip; far from UNCOMMON!</p>
<p>Americans need to wake the hell up! The third-world primitives, eaten up with jealousy and envy&hellip; see wealthy White Americans (AND Europeans) as sheep to be shorn. A female traveller hoping to snag a desirable spouse is vulnerable to rape by a third-worlder. Who then can easily stay out of sight in ship areas not visited by tourists. If identified, the victim&rsquo;s word against the third-worlder who will claim she was willing&hellip; enticed or even PAID him for sexual favors.</p>
<p>Nor is pilferage of tourists&rsquo; belongings as rare as claimed. A co-worker visited a Mexican resort. Went to the beach. Came back to find his new laptop PC, camera, items of clothing having been STOLEN! Wake up people. Spend your money at home! Let the damned corrupt thieving Mexicans get as little of your cash as possible!</p>

			<p>The alert also warns Americans to avoid areas where drugs and prostitution are evident and to &ldquo;refrain from displaying expensive-looking jewelry, large amounts of money and other valuable items.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This alert has just warned American citizens away from almost all of Americas big cities and also sounds like the goings on here in Iraq.</p>
