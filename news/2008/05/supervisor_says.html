						<p>According to new data from the Department of Public Social Services, nearly twenty five percent of Los Angeles County&rsquo;s welfare and food stamp benefits goes directly to the children of illegal aliens, at a cost of $36 million a month &mdash; for a projected annual cost of $432 million.</p>

					<p>American citizens are selfish.  Don&rsquo;t they realize that families in Mexico are large and that it is almost impossible for many Mexican parents to support such large families.  By coming to the <span class="caps">USA,</span> Mexicans can have a much higher standard of living.  Yes it does cost a lot of money to support these new immigrants, and it  does raise taxes for every American household.  However, American citizens could have fewer children.  That would save them money and allow more charity toward needy immigrants.  Also, if American citizens would not have children, that would provide more room for not only Mexicans, but all the poor people of the Third World.  Americans need to stop being so greedy and selfish   &mdash;   they need to start thinking about others.  By forgoing reproduction, they can make more room and provide more resources for the large families of people from Mexico, India, Somalia, Haiti, and a hundred other nations.  </p>

					<p>&ldquo;The total cost for illegal immigrants to County taxpayers far exceeds $1 billion a year &mdash; not including the millions of dollars for education,&rdquo; said Antonovich&#8221;</p>
<p>And many millions more for the justice system, bankrupt hospitals, lower wages, the lives lost to drunk drivers and the cost for car insurance rates because of the uninsured Mexicans.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the obvious, there&rsquo;s more.  Lost culture, more litter, crowded highways, stolen cars, drugs, lost jobs, overcrowded houses, crime-ridden neigborhoods, abandoned foreclosures, gangbangers, graffitti, press one for English, the reintroduction of third-world diseases etc. etc. and the list goes on.</p>
<p>But the absolute <span class="caps">BEST </span>part of all this, is getting to hear how this is a racist gringo country, it&rsquo;s all the white man&rsquo;s fault and the elected officials are wanting to promote the immigration debate, and introduce comprehensive immigration reform because they&rsquo;re all God&rsquo;s children&hellip; while Rome burns.</p>

<p>California is sinking as a direct result of this massive and out-of-control illegal alien invasion!  It is time for all tax-paying citizens to vote out all of these clowns and vote in honest patriots who will do the jobs they&rsquo;re sworn to do - to protect and serve the American people!</p>

<p>Good list, although it&rsquo;s missing some of the most important issues. What we also get with this &#8220;immigration&#8221; is Mexican politicos being elected to American governents of all levels (Nunez, Villaraigosa, Grijalva, etc.) and a growing tide of revolutionary Marxism.<br>

					<p>This is really a losing battle.  The Mayor of Los Angeles, Antonio Villaraigosa is a dedicated &#8220;Reconquista&#8221; who supports the invasion from Mexico.  Mayor Reconquista happily declares that Los Angeles is a sanctuary city that welcomes illegals.<br>
Special Order 40 prevents the police from inquiring into a suspect&rsquo;s legal status, this includes <span class="caps">MS13 </span>gang members. The speaker of the state assembly, Fabian Nunez, is also a proud Reconquista who works hard to shape legislation that benefits illegals.   Recent immigration raids have outraged Villaraigosa and Nunez and they have vowed to put a stop to them.  With the current leadership in Washington, they will probably be successful.</p>

					<p>I confess I did not read any further on this article than the first few sentences. When I saw the name Mike Antonovich, everything became clear. He is the <span class="caps">ONLY L.A.</span> County Supervisor with the gutts to tell the citizenry the truth about the tremendous mindboggling drain on California and <span class="caps">L.A.</span> County taxpayers because of illegal immigration. He deserves the highest praise. The rest of the <span class="caps">L.A.</span> County Board of Supervisors are a joke. An absolute joke.</p>

					<p>If the government claims a certain number about &#8221; total numbers of negative things&#8221;; then you know that the real number is much, much worse. Be it inter-racial crime, excessive socialistic handouts (all unconstituional), minorities, illegal parasitic invaders(see prior),exotic third world imported diseases into Western countries.</p>

					<p>I just read an article on <span class="caps">VDARE, </span>that stated in the 80&rsquo;s, janitors in LA were native and unionized, their average pay was $12 an hour.  Now, janitors are employed by subcontractors and mostly illegal, their pay, 20 years later, $7 an hour.  And the taxpayer gets to subsidize the illegals with all the handouts.  Who can live in LA on $7 an hour?  Not just welfare to the illegals, but also to the huge corporations that employee these illegals. So, if you go to LA and stay at a nice hotel, that pays their cleaning staff around 50% less than they had to 20 years ago, do you get 50% off the 1980 rate?</p>

					<p>And so the Reconquista continues at tax payer expense.  What is lost in all of these figures is the fact that this is our country, not a proposition nation, not a world wide dumping ground for Mexico and the world&rsquo;s excess population.  It is The Camp of the Saints for real this time.  At least that is the logical conclusion of the premiss of open borders.</p>
<p>  The federal reserve can continue to print money without end to cover the costs of illegals and their anchor babies,  unconstitutional wars, bailing out the subprime crises(banks and mortgage holders),  etc but all this does is hasten the collapse of the financial system by causing hyperinflation and the downward spiral of the dollar.  It is very similar to the economic dynamic  which created the Weimar Republic and its demise.  It may not be that bad right now, but it will progressively deteriorate.  The Weimar Republic lasted only a little more than one decade from the end of the great war until the rise of national socialism.  We finally completely went off the modified gold standard in August of 1971.  There has never been a country with a fiat currency which did not end in economic collapse of that currency.</p>

					<p>The reader, above, who said that, &#8220;American citizens should have fewer children&#8221; was being sarcastic.  However, in fact, that is exactly the result of government-supported massive illegal immigration into the <span class="caps">USA. </span> This is because (as every economic analysis shows), illegals (and many legal immigrants) place a massive strain on government services, requiring higher taxes.  The extremely high <span class="caps">USA </span>tax rate (about 50% of your earnings) causes both parents to have to work and to often delay or forgo additional children.  Although your Federal income tax rate may only be at 20%, in fact, when you add up all the hidden taxes, fees, and charges (State, county, &amp; city taxes, Social Security, Medicare, gas tax, phone tax, sales tax, hotel and visitor taxes, parking &amp; toll fees, car, boat, gun, horse, dog registration fees, building and business fees, etc. etc., you soon realize that nearly 50% of what you make goes to the government, which then distributes it for their social programs.  <br>
     How many American citizens would have had more children (or started earlier) if they had been able to keep more of their money?  Our government takes money from <span class="caps">USA </span>citizens and gives that money to illegal immigrants (education, health care, food stamps, subsidized housing). This puts a strain on American families, causing them to have fewer children.  Then the government tells us we need to import more immigrants, because our population is not growing fast enough.</p>

<p>Well, I for one, am shocked. After all the parades, hard work and dedicated corruption and yabber from the Los Angeles Mayor and his seedy hispanic flunkees to turn LA into the illegal Mexican capital of the world&hellip;it&rsquo;s only twenty five percent?</p>
<p>Still, fans of the illegal alien welfare invasion (like John McCain, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama) can always look forward to next year - when it could easily be thirty-three percent. Onward and downward. </p>

The bottom line, which you need to know for your own bottom line, is that <span class="caps">U.S. </span>taxpayers are giving more than $9,000 a year in cash or benefits to each immigrant, a third of whom are in the country illegally. That&rsquo;s $36,000 for each immigrant household of four. <br><br>
Because the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>has 37 million immigrants, legal and illegal, the national cost was more than $346 billion last year, which was twice our fiscal deficit. The cost of immigrants is so high because immigrants are poorer, pay less tax and are more likely to receive public benefits than natives.<br><br>
The financial burden immigrants impose on education starts with the 3.8 million K-12 students enrolled in more-expensive classes for the non-English-speaking. When we add up the costs of hiring specialized teachers, training regular teachers, student identification and assessment, and administration costs, the total amounts to an estimated $1,030 per pupil, or $3.9 billion.</p>
<p>Then we have to obvious costs of hospitals and prisons.</p>
<p><br>
Despite these budget breaking costs, John McCain is reneging on his promise to enforce the border first and is jumping back into bed with La Raza and the other groups supporting amnesty for up to 20 million illegals.  Sen McAmnesty now says that the illegal invasion should be addressed  with a comprehensive approach rather than a piecemeal approach such as building a border fence first, or as he calls it &#8220;that goddamned fence.&#8221;</p>
<p>It should be noted here that Obama also believes in the McCain approach.</p>

<p>That is very true, another thing about that is that they were mostly black, and many of them had AA contracts with the local governments that they lost to the hispanics. You would think blacks would be outraged, but they&rsquo;re not. Although the recent race riots at Locke High School might suggest otherwise. I drove past the <span class="caps">LAX</span> Hilton yesterday, and the workers were on strike, again, or still. All the other hotels in the Lost Angeles airport area struck a deal with the city to pay their maids and what not a &#8220;livable wage&#8221; of $10.39 an hour. I&rsquo;m not sure where in LA someone can live on that wage, considering the median priced home in Watts is around $300,000. All these people can&rsquo;t seem to understand the basic law of supply and demand. The area is flooded with unskilled, uneducated laborers, which means they aren&rsquo;t really worth that much. Why pay someone $10.39 an hour when you have a stack of applicants willing to work for $8? I think $8 is the current minimum wage in the Peoples Republic of California, which is a complete joke, someone who makes $8 an hour nets less than what my apartment costs, but if you try to explain to them supply and demand and that they are doing to themselves for supporting all the illegals, they call you a racist, redneck or <span class="caps">NAZI </span>and tell you to go back to your trailer park.<br>

<p>What will happen then is exactly what the Left is pushing for: a leftist revolution. By that time, the Malthusian population (those, like &#8220;Latinos&#8221;, who turn every increase of their living standards into more breeding) will have enough clout to claim all political power. And those who control them will rule the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>just like Stalin, Hitler, Mussolini, Castro (you name them)ruled their socialist countries.</p>
<p>To make things worse, the most populous regions of the world, SE Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America will pass that point of no return as well. And all the genocide that will follow should be blamed on today&rsquo;s &#8220;bleeding heart&#8221; Liberals (who are very generous for the poor and the oppressed, however, from someone else&rsquo;s pocket) with their misdirected compassion and competitive altruism without which the Malthusian populations of the world would not be able to multiply.</p>

<p>Define &#8220;live.&#8221;  If, using the modern white middle class standard, you mean owning a 1500-2000 sf house on about 0.25 acres of land, two cars, annual vacations of relatively great distance, reliable electricity and other utilities, then obviously the answer to that is no, SoCal or elsewhere.</p>
<p>However, Mexicans tend to be satisfied with a lot less, with living almost cheek-to-jaw in small domiciles, with communal ownership of automobiles, and so on.  It might not be what we expect, but it&rsquo;s a lot better from where they came from.  With that in mind, of course one can &#8220;live&#8221; in <span class="caps">L.A. </span>on $7 an hour, because you will be one of many in your domicile earning that wage.</p>
<p>The point is the elimination of the working middle class.</p>
