						<p>More than 30 state schools in England are made up solely of ethnic minority pupils with no white children on the roll, according to government figures.</p>
<p>The finding follows a warning from Britain&rsquo;s race watchdog that schools are becoming increasingly segregated along racial lines.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s school census, carried out in January, found that 27 primaries and four secondaries were entirely non-white.</p>
<p>The schools, which were not identified, are likely to include England&rsquo;s nine state Muslim schools and two state Sikh schools.</p>
<p>The remaining 20, all primaries, are likely to be in areas with large ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>Trevor Phillips, the chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, who has claimed that Britain is &#8220;sleepwalking into segregation&#8221;, said last year that there was a disturbing trend for schools to become either mainly white or mainly black.</p>
<p>He pinned the blame on the phenomenon of &#8220;white flight&#8221; from racially mixed areas, saying: &#8220;To put it crudely, white parents, particularly, are unhappy about putting children in schools where they think their children are going to be in a minority.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new figures, released under the Freedom of Information Act, show that entirely non-white schools can be found in 10 education authority areas: Bradford, Kirklees and Calderdale in West Yorkshire; Lancashire, Oldham and Blackburn; the London boroughs of Tower Hamlets, Ealing and Hillingdon; and Birmingham.</p>
<p>Groups which are counted as &#8220;white&#8221; include white British, Irish, traveller, gipsy/Roma or &#8220;any other white&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Department for Children, Schools and Families said that some white pupils could have been placed into some of the other categories.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman added: &#8220;Every school is responsible for ensuring that children are educated about the diverse makeup of British society.&#8221;</p>
<p>Earlier research carried out at Bristol University found that schools were more segregated than the communities around them.</p>
<p>In one London borough 17 schools had more than 90 per cent Bangladeshi pupils, while nine others had fewer than 10 per cent.</p>
<p>Commenting on the earlier research, Mr Phillips said: &#8220;We think this is a serious problem because it does not help to prepare the children in those schools for the real world, to interact with people who are not like themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>The latest findings come days after official data showed that almost 500,000 children in primary schools and a further 350,000 in secondary schools have English as a second language.</p>
<p>They account for one in seven of Britain&rsquo;s total school population.</p>
<p>The National Association of Head Teachers and the Association of Teachers and Lecturers have raised concerns about the situation, with the latter calling for extra funds to &#8220;meet the extra educational demands on schools brought about by the recent influx of children of refugee and EU migrant families&#8221;.<br>

<p><p>Fancy white parents &#8220;crudely&#8221; caring about whether their children are a besieged minority within the boundaries of their ancestral nation, harassed and brutalized by imported Third World children of color, who have been taught to hate whites as &#8220;oppressors&#8221; and &#8220;racists&#8221; by the very schools the white children are forced to attend!  How dare they!  Don&rsquo;t these white parents realize that their children are not their own to tend or care for, much less scions of the white race, but mere laboratory subjects in some unelected apparatchik&rsquo;s experiment with &#8220;diversity&#8221; and &#8220;anti-racism&#8221;?  The sheer indelicacy of these rotters!</p></p>

			<p>Something tells me they will find a way for these white kids to experience the &#8216;tolerance&rsquo;, &#8216;diversity&rsquo;, and &#8216;sensitivity&rsquo; they are missing out on. </p>

<p>To put it bluntly, they don&rsquo;t want their children beat up and killed. <br>
In LA the blacks are running from Hispanic gangs. Black flight? </p>

			<p>I think that it is telling that all of the schools are primaries. White Brits are not having enough children to populate the schools.</p>

			<p>Oh my queen, you mean there are not enough innocent white girls to be pimped out and/or gangraped by &#8216;minorities&rsquo;? What a shame, these people who flee minorites should be tried for treason to muliti-cultism, and of course, then drawn and quartered. THAT will teach these white &#8216;isolationists&rsquo; to question the judgment of the chosen leader! As readers of AMREN understand, its only a matter of time.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t you just love it?  I mean, these diversity mental cases screw up a society beyond all recognition then they wonder why whites flee what has been forced on them by the mentally and emotionally disturbed who are convinced they know what is best for everybody.  </p>
<p>In their next report they want everybody to know that the non-white crime rate is sky-rocketing, with numerous hare-brained solutions to curtail it, all sounding like they&rsquo;re competing with the village idiot for top honors on the stupidity list, never once connecting both situations to white flight.  Instead they ask what they can do about white racism.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had our little moment of fame in history&rsquo;s annals.  Now it&rsquo;s time to implode and start all over again, until the next time when we embark upon the same cycle of oppression, war, bloodshed, peace, prosperity, then complacency, which leads directly to allowing societies biggest imbeciles to assume control with one of their ideologies, which will then bring us full cycle into war and bloodshed again.  </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t do anything except enjoy yourselves to the fullest, because there&rsquo;s nothing we can do to change human stupidity.</p>

			<p>It is not white flight that is to blame. It is very poor immigration policies that throw open the door to violent poor non-white immigrants who immediately set upon us, our culture, and our families. It&rsquo;s either fight or leave so whites historically choose to leave. </p>

			<p>The British Isles are the place to watch my friends, in the near future.  Britain is probably the country that is furthest along the politically correct road, i.e., the road to destruction.  The worst trouble will begin there and has begun there already.  The MSM though, will attempt to keep it under wraps when the real shindig begins.  The British are history and collectively they do not realize it.  When the Muslims are in full force and power they&rsquo;ll be emigrating to places like the U.S. - which by the way - they&rsquo;ve already started doing.  They&rsquo;re divided and deluded.</p>

			<p>Apparently, there are but two races: &#8216;White&rsquo; and &#8216;non-White&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Trevor Phillips is quoted saying, &#8220;We think this is a serious problem because it does not help to prepare the children in those schools for the real world, to interact with people who are not like themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How ever do the children in Bangladesh, Pakistan, India or China &#8216;prepare for the real world&rsquo; when they grow up in racially homogeneous schools?  Not having been exposed to diversity doesn&rsquo;t disqualify them for immigration to Britain, does it Mr. Phillips?</p>

			<p>In the real world, we don&rsquo;t interact with people of other races either.  We go to different churches, we marry our own, our friends are all the same race, etc, etc.  For a few hours each day, maybe, we must work alongside someone of a different race, but it&rsquo;s easy enough to just bottle up and concentrate on your work, rather than be yourself and let loose.  I wouldn&rsquo;t say wearing a mask all your life during work &#8216;interacting.&rsquo;  Unless they mean that we must practice in school as little children how to lie, deceive, and wear masks about what we really think about diversity, so we won&rsquo;t get sued or fired at the workplace&hellip;</p>

			<p>I am a white man who had nothing to do with minorities my whole life except starting my business in Japan and retiring to SE Asia. Being ignorant of people of color did not hinder me in the least. What are they talking about not being dragged down by hispanics and blacks is a disadvantage? If these government lackies had jobs in the private sector, they would sing a different tune.</p>

<p>Wow! Such insight! Maybe this Trevor Phillips guy ought to change his name to Sherlock. I&rsquo;m envious. Why can&rsquo;t I pull a six or seven figure salary for stating the obvious? Is it because I&rsquo;m white?</p>
<p>Nah! It&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;d also indiscreetly mention some obvious facts that Phillips would not. For example, I might mention that the third worlders in Britain and the U.S. prefer to congregate in areas where they&rsquo;re the majority because they don&rsquo;t like us any better than we like them. I might even call these areas ghettoes. I might mention that the third worlders find ways to make whites feel both unwelcome and unsafe in areas they occupy. I might even ask some hypocrital liberals why they don&rsquo;t live in the ghetto. I&rsquo;d get canned in a New York minute.</p>

			<p>Actually,the OTHER point of view would be that the fact that schools are dividing along racial lines shows &#8220;progress&#8221;.</p>
<p> Birds of a feather, flock together. </p>
<p>Your multi-racial (Anti-White/nativist)society is failing at an alarming rate. All the kings horses and all the kings men, wont be able to put it back together (again). Why would Whites want some other persons culture (multi-culture) to RUN THEIR LIVES???)</p>
<p>Multi-cultism is now the new &#8216;conservative&rsquo; agenda. </p>

<p>Not &#8220;sleepwalking&#8221; Mr. Phillips, Britons are quite reasonably fleeing the grotesque personal debasement forced on them and their children by the British government&rsquo;s despicable social experimentation on its founding population.</p>
<p>Actually, it is the British government that is sleepwalking the British people into oblivion. </p>

			<p>To the state, a good parent is one who sits back passively and sends her own child into a multi-culti meat-grinder everyday just to prove that they &#8220;accept&#8221; people who openly hate whites.  What the hell is wrong with the govts. in the West?  Are they just trying to invoke an ethnic cleansing of whites?  Or are they actually stupid enough to not see the blatent race hatred expressed towards whites on a daily basis?</p>

<p>It certainly should! Funny. </p>
<p>If not having diversity puts an individual in such dire straights&hellip; how come this same watch dog group isn&rsquo;t being paid to examine diversity in the schools where the immigrants come from?</p>

			<p>Britain is &#8221;sleepwalking into segregation&#8221; caused by &#8221;white flight&#8221;. Just like you diversity freaks walked into multiculturalism in the first place? With your eyes shut &amp; your Marxist pea-brain closed down. How ironic that, &#8221;ex-Marxist&#8221; Trevor Phillips, one of the architects of multiculturalism in the U.K. accepts no blame whatsoever for its failure &amp; tries to shift the blame onto the white victims of his own insane policy. This fake Briton has all the gall of an Al Sharpton &amp; the slickness of an itinerant medicine man. You&rsquo;d have thought this son of Guyanese immigrants would have learned enough about the endemic racial hatred between Blacks &amp; Indians in his South American ancestral homeland to keep his big Marxist nose out of the affairs of the indigenous British people. But no, I guess the fat salary &amp; large pension on offer to one who has never had a proper job in the real world was too good an offer to refuse. Because of their brainwashing, Cultural Marxists, unlike ordinary people, cannot learn from life&rsquo;s experiences &amp; are doomed to repeat their mistakes ad infinitum. And these people are the so-called elite who govern our countries &amp; our lives. These Marxist/liberal/Fabians are a clique of useless wasters who would make ideal tinpot dictators in some third-world banana republic, which is where they belong.</p>
