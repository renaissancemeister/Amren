						<p>Just 12 per cent of Chinese immigrants, and 22 per cent of Lithuanians, are &lsquo;highly integrated&rsquo; into Irish society, according to a major study by researchers at UCD. </p>
<p>The report, Getting On, assessed the experience of four migrant groups &mdash; Nigerians, Chinese, Indians and Lithuanians &mdash; across a selection of political, economic and social indicators. </p>
<p>It found that more than 90 per cent of Indian respondents and over 70 per cent of Nigerians indicated medium to high levels of integration. However, half of Chinese respondents showed low or very low integration levels, while almost 40 per cent of Lithuanians were placed in the same category. </p>
<p>The research identified a person&rsquo;s immigration status as one of the key determinants of integration. Although Chinese respondents had very low rates of involvement in trade unions, the figures for all other groups were higher: 7 per cent of Indians, 8 per cent of Lithuanians and 25 per cent of Nigerians. </p>
<p>There were noticeable differences in employment rates, with Lithuanian and Indian respondents having significantly higher levels than those from the other groups. </p>
<p>The report was commissioned by the Immigrant Council of Ireland and carried out by 12 researchers at UCD. </p>
<p>It found that while Indians worked in similar occupations in Ireland as in their home country, there was evidence of &lsquo;de-skilling&rsquo; across all four groups. </p>
<p>This was most apparent for Nigerians, who experienced a significant change from managerial, business and government occupations to services and childcare. </p>
<p>Despite this, however, a significant majority in each group believed its financial situation had improved since coming to Ireland. </p>
<p>Chinese nationals were least convinced of a positive change, and this group also reported the lowest levels of income, with 59 per cent earning an average annual income of less than EUR 14,400. That may be connected to their status, since student visa holders may only legally work for 20 hours a week. </p>
<p>Indian respondents had the highest incomes, with 67 per cent reporting an average annual income of greater than EUR 31,720. </p>
<p>Respondents highlighted young people as a source of anti-immigrant sentiment, with some interviewees reporting that young people had thrown stones or eggs at them. Others had friends who had been physically assaulted. </p>
<p>Overall, the report finds a clear desire &mdash; if not the opportunity &mdash; among migrants for social interaction with fellow residents. </p>
<p>The immigrant council makes 27 detailed recommendations in the report, including in areas such as family reunification, naturalisation procedures and English language training.<br/>

			<p>With less than 4 million, Ireland needs to wake up fast! Especially with their very attractive women and cute children, I would hate to see the Irish go extinct. Go Irish! Wake up, before it&rsquo;s too late. (Also make sure the number of foreigners is limited in Northern Ireland.)</p>

			<p>1)Family reunification? Translated = bring in more immigrants.</p>
<p>Followed by the reunification of the relatives brought in by the first reunification.</p>
<p>Total insanity.</p>
<p>2)It would appear the immigrants are a) claiming how badly they are mistreated and b) they want to bring more of their family into a country where they are mistreated. Kind of ironic.</p>

			<p>I thought that the Irish had already made their views known through the national referendum some 8-10 years ago which restricted Nigerian immigration(at a point when 1/3 of the children born at the National Maternity Hospital Dublin were Nigerian) and once again in the 2004 citizenship act which made it more difficult to obtain Irish citizenship.  If the natives throw stones at you, this might be an indication that you are not wanted.  One would think that Indians would be intelligent enough to grasp that message.  It is my sincere hope that Ireland will successfully maintain its racial and cultural heritage instead of squandering it like so much of the rest of Europe.  When push comes to shove on immigration, the Irish have a mechanism of letting their feelings be known which we lack in the US, viz. the national referendum.  Perhaps it is time for another referendum of the Irish people regarding future immigration.</p>

			<p>      This would follow the traditional Chinese pattern. The<br/>
immigrants are stuck inside a self created ghetto due to language<br/>
and cultural differences. And then their children soar to the<br/>
highest levels of education and achievement. Don&rsquo;t worry Ireland,<br/>
the Chinese will take over if you let eneough of them in. Or you<br/>
could let the South Asians or Nigerians take over. In any case,<br/>
like the rest of the White world, you are slaves in search of<br/>
Masters.</p>

			<p>There&rsquo;s an old saying - &#8220;Where there are Africans, there is Africa.&#8221; The same can be said of Chinese, and indeed every other nationality on the face of the planet. The fact is that demographics is everything, and the more of a certain kind of people there are in a foreign place, the more they&rsquo;re likely to bind together and preserve &#8220;their&#8221; culture and way of life. Usually this is because it is frankly difficult to live amongst totally alian people. These things are to be expected. What is not to be expected and is unusual, today and historically, is the absolute vigour with which white &#8220;liberals&#8221; pursue open borders immigration with cultures that are so unlike us, that assimilation coupled with massive immigration becomes an impossilbility. It is here where the problem lies. It is the the white liberal who is the problem. </p>
<p>East is East and West is West, and never the Twain shall meet. </p>

			<p>I posted about this study on my blog   &mdash;   here&rsquo;s part of what I had to say:</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to read the entire thing yet, but from what I gather the survey was very much a &#8216;self-assessment&rsquo; by the immigrants who were interviewed. The researchers didn&rsquo;t actually ask the respondents &#8220;how well integrated into Irish society do you feel you are?&#8221;, but they may as well have. Some of the questions looked like this:</p>
<p>&#8220;11. Are your (educational and vocational) qualifications fully recognized (through appropriate job title/pay) in your current (primary) job? -Yes -No -Don&rsquo;t Know&#8221;</p>
<p>/rolleyes</p>
<p>As the authors of the report point out:</p>
<p>&#8220;This report focuses on the experiences and attitudes of migrants to Ireland. This is just one aspect to integration. Future research needs to address the experiences and attitudes of the host society. [pg. 45]&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed.</p>

			<p>Just 80 years ago the Irish Revolution was over land and absentee landlords who owned all of Ireland.  The freestate was formed to insure Ireland would always be Irish.  What have they done.   They are a small culture that will be overwhelmed by Chinese and Lithuanians.  </p>

Right you are!   Ireland has less than 4 million, while China has OVER A BILLION!</p>
<p>China could swamp Ireland with millions and not even notice the loss. For any country so tiny as Ireland to be accepting immigration from a goliath like China is sheer madness.  In fact, for such aa small country, densely settled for thousands of years, accepting ANY immigration at all is madness.</p>

			<p>In todays age of deceit and lies we should first consider the source of the study before making judgement.UCD is Irelands premier university where institutional leftwing brainwash has taken deep roots among its &#8220;elite professors and pundits.&#8221; Hence we should take their findings with a grain of salt. Their idea of integration may be very much different from that of the common man. Indians with their barbaric customs of arranging marriages and female infanticide and nigerians with female genital mutilation are according to UCD university &#8220;experts&#8221; very much in line with irish culture while eastern europeans and chinese with no such gifts are a bad thing for ireland.<br/>
Ireland is clearly taking example of Great Britain where we are bombarded on daily basis about how progressive indians and pakistanis are enriching british culture even if everyday experience is proving otherwise while eastern europeans are depicted as aliens in britain. Next time you come across one of those surly indian faces in ireland do not be fooled be the appearance deep inside a progressive mind is hiding. </p>

			<p>I used to live in Vancouver, and the Hong Kong immigrants to that city showed absolutely no signs of wanting to integrate into the majority culture. Many in fact have no intention of learning any more English than is necessary to gain admission into colleges/universities. Whites have largely left Vancouver, and it&rsquo;s now an Asian outpost in North America instead of a true Canadian city.</p>

			<p>&#8220;the more of a certain kind of people there are in a foreign place, the more they&rsquo;re likely to bind together and preserve &ldquo;their&rdquo; culture and way of life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Binding together and preserviing and promoting themselves is considered the height of enlightened multiculturalism. Unless the people in question are white. Then, the desperately pale culture doesn&rsquo;t need preserved at all but is in need of enrichment. And don&rsquo;t forget, the culture isn&rsquo;t &#8216;theirs&rsquo; in the first place. </p>
<p>For whites to even think about doing what non-whites do as a matter or course, as the height of unassailable progess&hellip; is to do what is the ultimate evil - for whites. </p>
<p><br/>
 &#8220;Just 80 years ago the Irish Revolution was over land and absentee landlords who owned all of Ireland.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over land and absentee landlords? That may be true, if you believe what we are told about history. I don&rsquo;t   </p>

<p>All the sadder when you consider that  these Celtic islands on the outer periphery of Europe, squeezed up against the rocky shore of the stormy North Atlantic, are the remnants of what once was a great Celtic empire that predated Rome.   And these last little pieces  are all that&rsquo;s left of it now,  about to go under and be lost forever.</p>
<p>Furthermore, one wonders: is this an ominous forewarning of what waits in turn  to befall the white race itself   &mdash;   pushed farther and farther to the outer limits by the in-rushing tide of Third World humanity, before  succumbing to utter extinction?</p>
<p>Surely, what is left of these tiny nations, which have given so much to the world, is worth preserving?   Surely, burgeoning monster nations that count their numbers in the hundreds of millions, and even billions, do not need to grow still more by swallowing these last few survivors?</p>
<p>Our well meaning, socially concerned liberals  agitate and agonize over  every &#8220;endangered species&#8221;  whether a snail or a caterpillar, but where is their concern for endangered peoples, endangered cultures?  Don&rsquo;t humans count?</p>

<p>Not quite. Chinese women always, always do their best to integrate with White males.  I&rsquo;m sure they have their eyes fixed firmly on the attractive Irish laddies.  This article merely laments that the miscegenation isn&rsquo;t proceeding fast enough, probably it&rsquo;s just the Chinese grandmas and grandpas who have come along with their miscegenating young folk to live off Whitey&rsquo;s largess that keep to themselves.  Not to worry though, liberal Irishmen like Geldof and Bono are there to sow the seeds of White guilt into their Irish countrymen and hence direct them toward race-mixing to cleanse the Whiteness from their genes and souls. They will sit back and sigh in liberal contentment when every White Irishman has produced an Asian family and every White  Irish lass is pushing a stroller with a mulatto.</p>
