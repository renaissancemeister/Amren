<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Civil rights advocates said Sunday that a recent incident in which a high-ranking black police official was ordered out of his car by a white officer points out ongoing racial problems in the city&rsquo;s Police Department.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Chief Douglas Zeigler, the head of the NYPD&rsquo;s Community Affairs Bureau and the highest uniformed black officer on the force, was off duty and sitting in his department-issued SUV on a Queens street May 2 when two white police officers approached the vehicle and confronted him.</p>
<p>The details of what happened next aren&rsquo;t completely clear, but a department spokesman confirmed a report in the Daily News that the encounter turned testy, and one of the officers tried to open Zeigler&rsquo;s door, even after the three-star chief had identified himself.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The officer, Michael Granahan, was stripped of his gun and badge Friday pending a departmental investigation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Granahan&rsquo;s father, Richard, blamed Zeigler for the incident. He told the Daily News for an article in Sunday&rsquo;s editions that Zeigler was parked at a hydrant in Corona, Queens, with the SUV&rsquo;s windows rolled up and the engine off.</p>
<p>The father said that Granahan&rsquo;s partner saw the driver fumble at his waistband and hollered, &#8220;Gun!&#8221; As Granahan grabbed the door handle, Zeigler stepped out and &#8220;smacked Michael&rsquo;s hand,&#8221; Richard Granahan said.</p>
<p>Zeigler&rsquo;s wife, Neldra, is the NYPD&rsquo;s deputy commissioner for equal employment opportunity.<br>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t nepotism against the law in NYC?  Oh, yeah, I forgot.  Like St. Louis, nepotism is only against the law if you&rsquo;re a white employee of the governmental unit.</p>
<p>If the telling of this story by the black chief is true, then I think the white cops on the force might have a grudge against him for one reason or another.  I&rsquo;m betting affirmative action.  Or he, like his wife, is an Equality Commissar that picks on white cops.</p>

			<p>OMG, the wife is the &#8220;deputy commissioner for equal employment opportunity&#8221;  &mdash;  that means, she&rsquo;s the one in charge of making sure white males are pushed out of the department to make way for unqualified minorities and women.  Her very JOB is to violate the civil rights of white men.</p>
<p>These two poor white cops are screwed unless some miracle takes place.  &#8220;Diversity&#8221; means the dystopia of Orwellian Marxism trumps all common sense and logic and justice.  </p>

I&rsquo;ve said it before; blacks can misinterpret the most harmless and casual interaction as a slap in the face. Hence the issue of &#8216;dissin&rsquo; (disrespecting to those of you who speak English) which can lead to violent and fatal confrontations.</p>
<p>I can imagine Chief Zeigler being questioned, even for a legitimate infraction (the article says he was parked in front of a hydrant), and becoming confrontational. While we&rsquo;ll have to wait for the details, I can see this racial interplay going bad quickly. It&rsquo;s almost certain that each side saw this in racial terms; the white cop seeing a black man breaking the law and the black man seeing the white man harassing him for simply being black (regardless of the fact he was committing an infraction).</p>
<p>The fact that his wife is the NYPD&rsquo;s deputy commissioner for equal employment opportunity offers us insight into the hyper-racial-consciousness of the Zeiglers.</p>

<p>Th only thing obvious right now is that someone was in a really big hurry to start shrieking &#8220;racism&#8221;.</p>

			<p>For all we know there is racism involved here&hellip; black on white racism. What were the circumstances surrounding the incident? Why was he pulled over? Arbitrarily? Doubtful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite likely that this patrolman had the misfortune of attempting to enforce the law on the wrong man. A black man in a position of authority, a black man who&rsquo;s using both his position and his racial privilege to defend himself. </p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re demonizing the policeman.</p>

_______ _______ _________<br>
This is the real story:  is Zeigler&rsquo;s &#8220;deputy commissioner for equal employement opportunity&#8221; wife an example of nepotism, is this a make-work position for the hard core unemployable, or is she an affirmative action hire, or all three?</p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s a great example of an urban area that is increasingly getting close to imploding due to the adverse, unqualified people being awarded positions based on color rather than ability.</p>
<p>This is an example of a multiracial society that is slowly becoming dysfyunctional with every addition to the organization of non-whites.  Soon areas such as this will be very close to what South Africa is experiencing now, where crime is out of control, aids is rampant, and corruption is so systemic it cannot be reversed unless the country is rid of its burden of black criminals within the governing authority.</p>
<p>Many US cities are fast degenerating to the deplorable depths of incompetent black control or influence.  Both are recipes for disaster.</p>

			<p>Michael Granahan&rsquo;a parner shouted &#8220;gun&#8221; as Zeigler fumbled with his mid-section.   The article is unclear if this was before Zeigler actually showed some hard ID.  Cops on the street have learned to take quick action to control the situation before you take the time to sort everything out. The street cops apparently had sufficient reason to approach the car and the facts are not too clear after that.  Until the complete facts are known, it is much too early to declare racism controlled the whole situation.</p>

			<p>When I was in the service, I halted officers at gunpoint three times while on guard duty at night.  Twice, I made them jump through all the hoops before I&rsquo;d let them pass, and they commended me for doing my duty properly.  The other time, I recognized the officer&rsquo;s voice and simply said, &#8220;Colonel, this is my guard post, you can&rsquo;t come this way&#8221;.  He  apologized for his carelessness, saying he was just out for a walk, and went back the way he came.  I had my duty and they knew it, and accepted my authority.  Chief Douglas Zeigler is a punk for giving the patrolmen a hard time.  I have difficulty believing that two street cops would knowingly harass a chief.  My ex-brother-in-law, a cop, told me years ago how to get through a police stop with minimal hassle.  &#8220;Do what they say.  If you&rsquo;re clean, they don&rsquo;t want to waste time on you, so make both of your lives easier.&#8221;  Chief Zeigler knows all this, and chose to get chesty anyway, and I&rsquo;ll bet that the White Chiefs know it too.</p>

			<p>I once had an interview with Chief Ziegler. I was referred there for a promotion by a helpful friend in personnel who was retiring and was trying to do me a favor, I guess. I had no idea, from the name, that Ziegler was black until I was ushered into his office. He is very.</p>
<p>To be fair, he impressed me as on-the-ball, articulate and sharp. But from the start, I sensed a prickly, somewhat hostile attitude and I suspected that a white male would not be comfortable or have a future there. I got out of it by claiming that I was underqualified to handle the challenge.</p>
<p>I had absolutely no idea that his wife is Commissioner for EEO!</p>

			<p>Police show favoritism when they encounter other police officers, or their families, on the job. Some small amount of favoritism could be expected but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be near-official.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Chief Douglas Zeigler, the head of the NYPD&rsquo;s Community Affairs Bureau and the highest uniformed black officer on the force&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Chief Zeigler replaces another black, Wilhemina Holiday, who was for a number of years the Deputy Commissioner of Community Affairs, a powerful position, and who was a black Jew. (There was an article about her background in a local Jewish magazine.)  From Chief Zeigler&rsquo;s improbable name (for a black), it would seem there&rsquo;s a good chance that her replacement is too. The position carries a lot of clout in local affairs and politics. </p>

<p><i><b>Cop who stopped chief isn&rsquo;t racists, (sic) parents say</b></i></p>
<p><b>&#8220;Michael&rsquo;s girlfriend is black,&#8221;</b> she [Officer Granahan&rsquo;s mother] said. &#8220;We didn&rsquo;t raise our kids to be prejudiced. We&rsquo;re from the Bronx. We have every nationality around us.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t Chief Zeigler also be under suspension for smacking the policeman&rsquo;s hand in the performance of his duties? If that person was anyone else&hellip; this action would be considered an assault.</p>
<p>Why would Granahan risk retribution [as he&rsquo;s now experiencing] by allowing the incident to escalate to this degree if Zeigler had already identified himself? To have Zeigler&rsquo;s wife as NYPD&rsquo;s deputy commissioner for equal employment opportunity, this white cop doesn&rsquo;t stand a chance in this stacked deck. Was Zeigler promoted before or after his wife attained her equally lofty position?</p>

			<p>As a retired cop who often worked in plain clothes, I was approached many times by patrol officers that thought I was suspicious.  I never had to say anything more than &#8220;I&rsquo;m on the job.  My shield and ID are in my pocket.&#8221; to avoid a physical confrontation.</p>
<p>Perhaps the Chief was sick the day that was taught at the academy.</p>

<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>The officer saw a car parked in front of a hydrant and the officer acted appropriately. Should the Chief pull rank after committing an infraction? Should the officer be reprimanded for doing his job? Should the officer take at face value the verbal identification of a man he doesn&rsquo;t know?</p>
<p>This whole episode stinks to high heaven. It&rsquo;s the chief who should be questioned about being parked illegally, slapping the hand of an officer during the commission of his duty, and pulling rank.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope someone pursues this. </p>

Do you remember that incident with the Haitian, Abner Louima?   The cop involved [Volpe] in that incident (eventually convicted anyway) suddenly came up with a black girlfriend too.   Despite the new black fiancée, it didn&rsquo;t do him any good.</p>

			<p>The slapping of the officers wrist is an assault and the officers should have arrested him immediately. His employment and rank is meaningless. That would have put the ball into their park for sure, not meaning they would not have a political battle, but the law would be on their side.  No one is going to get out of a car and slap my hand, they will not even get close enought to do something stupid like that.  Maybe these officers do not need to be on the job if they are that lax!</p>

			<p>There was a case similar to this in North Fla several years ago. An older black high ranking member of a South Fla PD was stopped for speeding by two young White Sheriff&rsquo;s Deputies &amp; proceeded to act like an arrogant fool. Lucky for the Deputies they had the incident recorded by a dash mounted camera. He was clearly the instigator of the incident &amp; was arrested with the case goin to trial. Unlucky for this fool was the fact that he was far out of his jurisdiction and did not have the clout that this Chief in NYC has. As a retiried Officer I know full well that any Officer of any Dept with a quarter of a brain would never disrespect such high ranking officals of their&rsquo;s or any other Dept. You really have to feel for these young white male cops of today especially in places like NYC or Philly</p>

Before the law?  Fine!  Schoolteacher&rsquo;s point was that (if the girlfriend story is true) he has forfeited our sympathy and support.  Yes, let him be treated appropriately BY THE LAW.  But that gives him no claim on any sympathy from US, the white public.  He can&rsquo;t play TWO SIDES of the fence: claiming sympathy from us, and looking for sympathy from the blacks too.   That&rsquo;s being two-faced, like a man with a wife and a secret girlfriend on the side, assuring each one that he loves her.</p>

			<p>Rich: As a civilized man, I believe in doing my duty.  My duty to my students is to teach them, regardless of race, sex, etc.  If I cannot carry out that responsibility, then it would be my duty to find another school.  If I were to be on a jury, my responsibility would be to judge according to the evidence, regardless of race.  But if some fool chooses to quit the White race, I am under no obligation to care about him or extend myself for his benefit.  As a juryman, I would judge him according to the law.  I might teach his kids, and I would not fault them for their father&rsquo;s feeblemindedness, but I do not have to respect him.  His problems are not my concern.  He has fouled his nest, and embraced multiculturalism.  Let him sleep in it.  </p>

			<p>I am surprised that Rich so totally missed the point. I completely agree with Schoolteacher.  Yes, of course, the accused cop is entitled to equal justice   &mdash;   before <i>the <b>law.</b></i>  But having turned his back on his own people (meaning us), he is not entitled to any sympathy <i>from <b>us. </b></i></p>
<p>Let the justice system grind its wheels, and let the decision fall where it may, but we owe him nothing.  Let him look for support to the blacks whom he&rsquo;s now courting.</p>

			<p>First law of politically correct police forces: Whenever an suspicious looking Afro-American is questioned by a White police officer, no matter HOW suspicious his appearance or the circumstances&hellip; IT IS ALWAYS BLATANT RACISM!</p>
<p>Second law of politically correct police forces: Whenever a Black perp wounds or kills a White police officer; it&rsquo;s the officer&rsquo;s own fault   &mdash;   for not assuming the Black suspect just might be a criminal fleeing his crime.</p>
<p>Does anyone have a problem understanding this reasoning? If NOT, perhaps you could explain this reasoning to me. Since I do not agree with it.</p>
