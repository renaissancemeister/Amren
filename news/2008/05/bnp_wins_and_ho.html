<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>The British National Party has shown solid steady growth in all areas of the country in the regions where local elections have been held, taking seats from mainly traditional Labour areas, as that party&rsquo;s vote collapses everywhere.</p>
<p>Before today, the BNP held 84 council seats at all levels. With almost all results in, this figure has now reached 100, and could still exceed that number.</p>
<p>In Rotherham, the BNP took two seats, including that of the Labour Party mayor. In Amber Valley, the BNP took two seats, and was an astonishing one vote off taking a further seat on that council.</p>
<p>In Thurrock, the BNP had a runaway victory by taking 40 percent of the vote, beating all the other parties hands down.</p>
<p>Two new BNP councillors grace Nuneaton &mdash; a running start for that area from zero, and a number of good places there bode well for the future.</p>
<p>In Pendle, Marsden ward, the BNP also beat all oncomers, polling double the Labour candidate and beating the Lib Dems into a humiliating fourth place.</p>
<p>In Three Rivers DC Ashridge ward, near Watford, the BNP gained a seat, which in Daventry&rsquo;s Drayton Ward, the BNP polled 31% of the vote, coming a close second to the Tories and leaving Labour in third place.</p>
<p>In Halifax, the BNP took a seat with a whopping 300 majority, while in Stoke, another three seats fell to the BNP, pushing the party&rsquo;s representation on that town council up to nine in all.</p>
<p>In Loughton, the BNP held one seat but lost two to a ferocious onslaught, a loss which was however ameliorated by the election of no less than 5 BNP representatives to the Loughton town council.</p>
<p>BNP national treasurer John Walker pulled off a surprise victory by being elected to the Mancot ward of Hawarden community council. This brings the total number of councillors for the BNP up to 100 countrywide.</p>
<p>There were also a large number of excellent second places countrywide. In Barnsely, no less than seven BNP candidates came a close second. In Swansea, the BNP trounced the Tories, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems, and in the spiritual Labour heartland of Jarrow, South Tyneside, a place where the Labour Party promised &#8220;there would never even be a BNP candidate&#8221;, the BNP polled 33% of the vote, beating the Tories into third place.<br>

			<p>Many on this website and abroad always have the most dark and cynical views of Britain. Many even saying it shall become a multicultural cesspit that would be hailed as a living example to all other nations of the consequences of &#8220;Diversity&#8221;, and that Native Britons can do nothing about it.</p>
<p>To these people, what do you think now?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said this once before. If anything, despite the heavier amount of PCness (which subsequently gives birth to the very resentment that helps us), Britain has a party firmly standing up for its people, and succeeding. </p>
<p>Just think of it, what will be Labour or any other party for that matter&rsquo;s retaliation? Yet more cries of racism and race pandering. Yet more stabbing the back of Brits. Which, as the left stupidly does not see, will help the BNP even further.</p>
<p>The tide is slowly but surly beginning to turn.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;d be surprised if the mainstream media <i>did</i> mention these results.  I&rsquo;m sure the ruling power is very, very afraid, and will take every step possible to stop further advances of the BNP.  Censorship is the first line of defense.  There are two parties in Great Britain   &mdash;   the BNP, and the Conservative-Liberal-Labour Party.  The ruling party wants there to be only one.</p>
<p>Here in the USA we&rsquo;ve been a one party state for a long, long time and there&rsquo;s no BNP equivalent in sight.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my prediction, and remember you read it here first on Amren.  The BNP will continue to make gains at the ballot box, until finally the ruling party finds some excuse to make them outright illegal.  This usurpation of democracy will be done in the name of &#8220;human rights&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Good on the BNP!  Excellent results as they are proving more and more to be a viable third party.  And therein lies the problem.</p>
<p>I hate to be cynical, but look for the following headlines in the paper soon:</p>

<p>&#8220;Auditor Uncovers Financial Irregularities in BNP&#8221;</p>

<p>A third party challenging the current two party dictatorship can simply not be permitted, especially one that espouses such un-PC views.</p>

			<p>How about a mention of Boris Johnson being elected Mayor of London? He defeated Red Ken Livingstone handily. Johnson writes a regular column in the *Daily Telegraph.* Read it online: www.telegraph.co.uk; it&rsquo;s the only half-way decent daily newspaper in Britain. His column is witty, elegant and definitely not PC.</p>

Although the race for Mayor of London was a win for the Conservatives rather than the BNP, we should nevertheless be celebrating the de-throning of &#8220;Red Ken&#8221; Livingstone. It&rsquo;s now official that Red Ken has LOST to Tory Boris Johnson! At long last, Livingstone is OUTTA HERE! Better still   &mdash;   it happened on May Day! <br>
 <br>
Yes, friends: that Jew-baiting terrorist-loving commie fruitcake Livingstone   &mdash;   who&rsquo;s been a pox on my Motherland for DECADES   &mdash;   has been decisively deposed by a man whose election promise was that:<br>
 <br>
&#8220;Voting Conservative will make your wife&rsquo;s breasts bigger and greatly increase your chances of owning a BMW M3.&#8221; <br>

<p>   Actually, they didn&rsquo;t announce the additional BNP seats on the BBC webpage the day after the election. The controlled media made it seem like a total defeat for the BNP. I think the BNP is on the right track with their new moderate image.  I support their efforts. Maybe formerly Great Britain can become if not great, at least green and pleasant again. </p>

<p>True, many American nationalists, especially those whose thinking is influenced by neoconservatism have a problem with calling the kettle black.  A lot of people here still see politics, even in other countries as &#8220;Republicans good, Democrats bad.&#8221;  They try to fit everything on to that template. </p>
<p>This comment is in a similar vein:</p>
<p>&#8220;It appears that finally, even some of the die-hard Labourites are coming to their senses. If things continue as they are the U.K. will not be recognizable as a european country.

<p>Yes, EVEN some of the proles are voting BNP now.  Shocking.  Most of the BNP votes come from working class ex-Labor voters.  This guy probably thinks rich Tories are backbone of nationalism in the UK.  </p>

			<p>&#8221;The victory will undoubtedly send shockwaves through the establishment, and comes in spite of tampering with the ballot boxes, generally hostile media coverage and a huge (and probably illegal) third-party campaign against the BNP, run by the Communist extremist front organisations, working on behalf of the other parties&#8221;. - from the BNP website.</p>
<p>The criminal governing political elite secretly fund the United Against Fascism [UAF], Searchlight &amp; other communist front organisations run by convicted marxist criminals, who, throughout these council elections in large areas of England &amp; Wales have attempted to intimidate voters by smear campaigns &amp; lies [illegal]. Their rent-a-mob of mostly deluded teenagers, hysterical feminists, &amp; minority hustlers cajoled &amp; threatened BNP members &amp; supporters throughout the election process [also illegal]. And these graceless Establishment totalitarians, including new London Mayor Boris [I&rsquo;m proud of my muslim heritage] Johnston, have the nerve to walk off the platform &amp; exit the hall, when unfazed, newly-elected London Assembly member, BNP candidate Richard Barnbrook made his speech. It&rsquo;s obvious that amongst the left&rsquo;s multitude of sins they also have absolutely no sense of irony whatsoever. But the lid has finally blown off the kettle, once &amp; for all, &amp; no longer can the MSM continue to ignore the BNP.</p>

			<p>And there was widespread electoral fraud against the BNP every step of the way. 400,000 votes were spoiled in London - that&rsquo;s right, 400,000!! And although former mayor Red Ken Livingstone lost to Boris Johnson by less than 200,000 votes he mentioned not a peep about the spoiled 400,000. Now why was that? Maybe he knew that the 400,000 spoiled votes weren&rsquo;t votes for him but for the BNP! Otherwise, why would he not want some sort of enquiry into why all those votes were spoiled (15% of the total!!) and whether some candidates were more adversely effected than others.</p>

Glenn, do you really mean equality or special, preferential treatment?</p>
<p>When a guest comes into my home, <i>he </i> is the guest and <i> I </i> am the owner.  It is MY home.  He is, of course, treated with courtesy and civility;  but the fact remains that he is the guest and I am the master of the house. There is a difference between the two,  and the guest should have the sense to know it. A guest should never presume to think that he is equivalent to the owner. If he abuses my hospitality, then he has exhausted his welcome.</p>

I don&rsquo;t know about anyone <i>else&rsquo;s </i> wife, but I do know that <i> his </i> wife is half-Indian (Sikh) and his grandfather was the child of the Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire (Turk).  Born in New York to a rich cosmopolitan family, he is a living example of the one-world multiculture in practice. He and his upper-crust international family are very much a part of that culture and are  surrounded by it.  Therefore, we mustn&rsquo;t applaud too hysterically; but he is surely better than &#8220;Red Ken&#8221;.  I am hopeful for Britain..</p>

And these graceless Establishment totalitarians, <b>including new London Mayor Boris Johnston [&#8220;I&rsquo;m proud of my muslim heritage&#8221;] </b>had the nerve to walk off the platform &amp; exit the hall, when&hellip; BNP candidate Richard Barnbrook made his speech.&#8221; </i></p>

			<p>Stephen, made the point in the direction I was thinking. As one of the biggest mass-murderers once said its not who votes but who counts them! They will do anything. Never underestimate the enemies ability to counter anyone getting in the way of  their agenda.The one that can get away by not playing by the rules will win! Its truly our weakness. We want to play by the rules when no one can win against a cheater except a better one! This was truly a victory against big odds,which is very telling.</p>

Oh, yes indeed!<br>
Or maybe:  &#8220;BNP unable to explain  missing funds. High-living leaders refuse to talk.&#8221;<br>
Or:  &#8220;Kinky Sex Trysts rumored at BNP headquarters&#8221;<br>
Or something such.  ANYTHING such!</p>
<p>In fact, the sleazy Daily Mail already tried such a semi-hatchet job on Richard Barnbrook, though it was not able to get away with much more than sly innuendo, implying that it had discovered  his &#8220;homoerotic past&#8221; and also his secret woman that he had hidden on the side   &mdash;   even though it turned that she was his separated wife of 10 years, in the process of getting a divorce. The entire disgusting article was dripping with sarcasm and innuendo (about his financee, his family relations, people who knew him, his past, even his looks). Although they were able to come up with no juicy scandal, they certainly tried to make it sound that way.   But they&rsquo;ll keep trying!  The British press is a disgrace.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;With a distinct sartorial style which worries even his most extremist supporters, and a background as a &#8220;visionary&#8221; artist whose most notable work was a homo-erotic film, Richard Barnbrook is an unusual Far Right leader, to say the least&hellip; this is the man who hopes to become the first neo-fascist mayor of London. Even when Barnbrook fails in that endeavour, as he most certainly will&hellip;.<br>
 <br>
Much has been made by would-be-Mayor Barnbrook of his recent engagement to Simone Clarke, the celebrated principal dancer of the English National Ballet&hellip;. the fact is that Mr Barnbrook already has a wife   &mdash;   albeit one that he is rather less keen to publicise. Little wonder, then, that Barnbrook has been so reluctant to volunteer her existence. . Now, though, we can shed some light on the strange private life of Richard Barnbrook.Their marriage broke down because of his &#8220;rotten politics.  She is appalled at the possibility of being recognised as the London BNP leader&rsquo;s wife. Certainly, if there is a more peculiar politician in the country, he has yet to emerge.  &#8220;He looks just like Hitler,&#8221; one person posted on the extreme Right-wing Stormfront website. &#8220;Whoever styles him needs a good kicking.&#8221; </i><br>
