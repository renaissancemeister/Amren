				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tanya Schevitz, San Francisco Chronicle, May 27, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>San Quentin State Prison inmate Lexy Good is white, hangs out with whites on the prison exercise yard and must be careful not to associate with blacks and Latinos. No cards, no basketball outside the color lines.</p>
<p>Those are the unwritten inmate rules of prison life. People stick to their own race.</p>
<p>Good, who&rsquo;s doing a short stretch for receiving stolen property, likes it that way.</p>
<p>&#8220;We segregate amongst ourselves because I&rsquo;d rather hang out with white people, and blacks would rather hang out with people of their own race,&#8221; said Good, 33, of Walnut Creek. &#8220;Look at suburbia. Look at Oakland. Look at Beverly Hills. People in society self-segregate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Soon that may change in the prisons.</p>
<p>San Quentin and 30 or so other state penal facilities are gearing up to carry out a federal court mediation agreement for integrating double cells and ending the use of race as the sole determining factor in making cell assignments.</p>
<p>Men in California&rsquo;s prisons have long been segregated in cells to quell racial tensions.</p>
<p>But Good, along with California&rsquo;s other 155,700 male inmates, may soon be forced to live in a 4-by-9-foot cell with an inmate of a different race.</p>
<p>A 1995 lawsuit filed by a black California inmate, Garrison Johnson, said that the California Department of Corrections&rsquo; practice of segregating prisoners by race violated his rights. A 2005 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court led to federal court mediation and the agreement that double cells would be desegregated.</p>
<p>While most inmates and correctional officials agree that it is a noble idea, many fear the worst.</p>
<p>&#8220;They should be thinking about what kind of war they are going to start,&#8221; said a San Quentin inmate who identified himself only as S. Styles, 36, of Vallejo. &#8220;It is like putting a cat and a dog in a cell together.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lt. Rudy Luna, assistant to the warden at San Quentin, said there is some concern among prison officials about the change because much of the violence is already based around racial gangs.</p>
<p><b>State mandate</b></p>
<p>{snip} [Luna said,] &#8220;I think we will have a spike in fighting because we have races that don&rsquo;t get along. If it was up to us, we&rsquo;d keep it the way it is. But it is a state mandate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Among the state&rsquo;s male inmates, about 28.9 percent are black, 39.3 percent are Latino, 25.9 percent are white, and 5.9 percent are classified as other, according to figures from the state Department of Corrections.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a lot of incidents in prison where you have a group of inmates going against another group of inmates,&#8221; said Terry Thornton, spokeswoman for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. &#8220;You have these groups aligned along race but it is about control. It is about criminal activities.&#8221;</p>
<p>As currently planned, the cell integration will begin July 1 as a pilot project at two prisons &mdash; Mule Creek State Prison in Ione (Amador County) and the Sierra Conservation Center in Jamestown (Tuolumne County). Next year, the plan calls for integration to begin at other prisons.</p>
<p>Interviewing inmates</p>
<p>In carrying out the plan, prison officials will interview and evaluate each inmate. Department of Corrections officials know some inmates cannot be placed with inmates of other races. {snip}</p>
<p>Inmate David Johnson said that all the races sit together peacefully in the prison church and they work together with few problems. But he wouldn&rsquo;t socialize with inmates of another race outside of those settings where he is forced to mingle.</p>
<p>Loyal to his race</p>
<p>&#8220;Prison politics&#8221; dictate that he stay loyal to his race, Johnson said. And the repercussions for a violation are swift and severe.</p>
<p>&#8220;You would be taken care of in some way. You could get stabbed or worse,&#8221; said Johnson, 38, of San Diego. &#8220;Whether you agree with the (unwritten) rules or not, you have to follow them.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>However, experts say it can work. The Texas prison system integrated its cells in the early 1990s and eventually saw a decline in racial tensions, said Professor Jim Marquart, chair of the criminology department at the University of Texas at Dallas, who studied the transition and is advising California during its process.</p>

			<p>Why not just give the inmates the freedom to choose who or what race they want to be with?Not all of them would choose to be with  members of their own race.It wont be done because it makes too much sense.</p>

			<p>Hospitals are under federal mandate to not segregate patients by race, creed,religion, etc. When you are recovering from your bypass surgery don&rsquo;t be surprised when your roommate is a drug dealer recovering from his/her bullet wounds. I bet Sandra Day O&rsquo;Connor or Justice Ginsburg have private rooms when they are recovering from their surgeries.</p>

			<p>It will take a few prison riots, and a few prisoners and guards killed, but eventually they will exhibit common sense once again.</p>
<p>This is but a small human sacrifice to the bloody <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moloch" rel="nofollow">Moloch</a> of Multiculturalism.</p>

&#8220;While most inmates and correctional officials agree that it is a noble idea, many fear the worst.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
The same could be said of integration in a multiracial society as a whole: a noble idea, but simply not workable on a large scale, and on a day-to-day basis. </p>
<p>A nation&rsquo;s prisons are, in fact, merely extreme versions of that nation as a whole. Concentrations. Microcosms. What happens under lock-and-key may be more compacted and compressed and severe than what happens on the outside, but it is not fundamentally different. </p>
<p>Which is why I, too, &#8220;fear the worst.&#8221;<br>

			<p>The change will hurt White inmates the most since they are the leasy likely to be racist going in to prison. They will not know to keep their guard up and will suffer the consequences.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s prison. They should get some of the worst punishment so as to hopefully not want to do anything harmful when they get out. But, no on can make someone like being around someone they don&rsquo;t want to be around. Don&rsquo;t worry about diversity in prisons.</p>
<p>Diversity doesn&rsquo;t stick. We are who we are.</p>
<p>The end times are slowly creeping up-universality</p>

			<p>  Lexy Good, White prison inmate, proves he has more solid common sense than trainloads of lawyers and judges. Most people like to associate with their own kind. What is so hard for the Left to understand about that? If segregation of prisoners by race reduces prison violence, wouldn&rsquo;t it seem to make sense to practice it? Just how does such segregation, assuming equal treatment in other respects, violate some black prisoner&rsquo;s &#8220;Constitutional rights&#8221;? Constitutional right to what? To have smaller, less muscular White boys around to rape and assault?</p>
<p>  And notice how the story has the happy ending required in any story about mixing the races in some way or other. Texas integrated its prison system in the 1990s and &#8220;eventually saw a decline in racial tensions.&#8221; Oh, sure. And the lion may lie down by the lamb, too. But the lamb won&rsquo;t get much sleep. </p>

			<p>This is just the culmination of a plan by the ACLU SPLC NOW ADL to put white inmates in a position where they can be easily killed.</p>
<p>It is illegal in California for more than 2 white inmates to speak with each other.  Contact between whites is allegedly evidence of belong to Aryan Brotherhood and other evil white organizations.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed by the son of Faye Stender.  She was a red diaper baby radical lawyer of the 1960&rsquo;s, lover of Huey Newton, defender of black murderers and part of the communist Charles Garry, Bob Truehaft crew of civil rights for all but whites attorneys.</p>
<p>Faye got hersthough, she was shot and disabled by one of her Black Guerilla Family convict/client/lovers.  She commited suicide because of the physical pain and humiliation.  How sad, how appropriate.</p>
<p>Then her son filed the &#8220;no white socialization&#8221; lawsuit and one of our racist, commie white hating california judges agreed.</p>

			<p>It is ILLEGAL for two White inmates to talk to each other?? But okay for Blacks, Mexicans, etc. to do the same? </p>
<p>Dear God, what is happening to the White race? They will implement this in society also! Also no marriage or co-habitation among Whites! No White births allowed! Many White prisoners are NOT criminals! How about those who had no money to pay the outrageous child support mandates being sent to prison?  God HELP YOUR WHITE RACE to wake up! We had better take some action NOW and quit waiting and waiting and waiting&hellip;.for WHAT, I might ask? </p>

			<p>The scheme will surely make California jails even less attractive to potential inmates.  The social engineers are at it again but who will explain the reasons for the increases in tensions and even deaths from violence.</p>

			<p>I did a landry business whe I was in federal prison, and I was the only guy there who would do black laundry.  I received four stamps a load, washed, dried and folded.  I was the unit GED teacher, so nobody wanted to hurt me.  I did it for free, except for the occasional cigarette.  Nobody bothered me, but my white cellies and I at least didn&rsquo;t have any weird emotional baggage standing between us.</p>
<p>I went to prison for three years.  The point does not seem to be either punishment or rehabilitation.  It is just warehousing folks who eventually return to your neighborhoods.  How badly messed up in the head do you want them, those of you who want them &#8220;punished.&#8221;</p>
<p>I went to federal prison for something I once said.  How much punishment do I need, along with my mother, my wife and my daughter?</p>

			<p>What possible benefit will come from integrating races (again on a forced basis like in the wider society)?</p>
<p>Advantages:<br>
Some diversity consultants, lawyers and other race hustlers will be happy.</p>
<p>Disadvantages:<br>
Increased violence<br>
Greater number of riots<br>
Increased incidents of &#8220;racism&#8221; (only white perpetrators, no doubt)</p>
<p>Does the warm fuzzy feeling some people get compensate for the list of severe disadvantages?</p>
<p>Instead of stopping racism, as the mantra says by being exposed to people of different races this brainless scheme will only serve to create and propagate more racial strife!  How very ironic!</p>

<p>Look what happened 35 years ago in Boston with forced busing.  And this was in our &#8220;Free&#8221; Society.</p>
<p>They are either absolutely stupid, or unforgivably cruel and cynical.</p>
<p>Personally I think it is the latter.  Just one more way they have found to go after Whites.  It&rsquo;s next on the list after Ruby Ridge, Waco, OKC Bombing, September 11th, and Boise, Idaho - the city the MSNBC told us is the next target of the &#8220;Terrorists&#8221;.   </p>
<p>They are like that Atlanta Falcons player with his Pitbulls.  </p>
<p>Hey guys!  I have an idea.  Let&rsquo;s form our own Society, with our own Law-Enforcement, from Police to Courts, find THEM guilty of cruel and unusual punishment and send THEM to jail.  Yeah, then the Prison Population will have a new demographic.  That&rsquo;s right, now it&rsquo;ll be a PERFECT reflection of society with - Blacks, Whites, Hispanics, Other, and GOOBERS!</p>
<p>Wonder what kind of tatoos they&rsquo;ll wear?  Doubt if they will need to do something to identify themselves. It&rsquo;ll be easy for them to spot each other.  It&rsquo;ll also be easy for the rest of the Prison Population to spot them too.  Yeah, I imagine they&rsquo;ll be very - VERY - popular, for as long as they last that is.  Yeah, they&rsquo;ll be just one notch BELOW Child-Molesters. <br>

			<p>Read between the lines folks.</p>
<p>When this law is enacted there will be others that follow and all of them will be designed to increase the likelihood that Whites go to jail.  For ex. they will say in so many words. &#8220;Whites can&rsquo;t say or do X, Y, and Z.  Like, yelling the &#8220;N&#8221; word while being attacked by a group of Blacks.  Like, even defending yourself while being attacked by a group of Blacks or other Non-Whites. And by discharging a firearm even in your own house while being attacked by a group of Non-Whites.  Anything they can think of.  These are just some, but one can think of others.  No doubt they are.  &#8220;They&#8221; meaning, the ones who are passing these &#8220;laws&#8221;.  <br>
They are EVIL! There is NO other word. They are the REAL Criminals.</p>

			<p>I am sure the Federal Judge, more than likely a kooky liberal since this is California, has spent a lot of day to day time around inmates.  The Judge should have been forced to do some on-the-job research at San Quentin before making the decision.  This integration was brought about because one whining Black inmate said his rights were being violated.  An easy fix would have been to integrate him, and put him in a cell with a large Aryan.  I am sure more than his rights would have been violated.</p>

			<p>As a former Liberal (with a capital &#8220;L&#8221;) I can only say that this article is only providing me with yet more validation and justification for my support and sympathy with Aryans in Prison.</p>
<p>And when it comes to Recovering Liberals, I know for a fact that I am not the only one.  It&rsquo;s just a matter of organizing.  And to do that we simply have to thin the WN herd and cleanse it of its riff raff (there&rsquo;s too many unstable types. they might be plants, but it doesn matter.  for WN to work we HAVE to purge these goons).  And right from the beginning we have to create the society within WN that we want for the future.  There are lots of potential out there for alliances among those we might consider to be hostiles.<br>
A little healthy self-criticism, but without being floor-mats or people-pleasers, that&rsquo;s what got us into this mess in the first place.  And all of those alliances should demonstrate in good faith their own capacity for self-criticism.  It&rsquo;ll show we are humble, imperfect, more honest than not, and that our Rights and Freedoms and our sense of disgust at what is happening today, are the uniting factors. The more we can do this the less buried hostilities we&rsquo;ll have - cause those will always be there, humans being what they are.  Better to START any Organization with that firmly in mind than to pretend and trip over ourselves before, during and after.<br>
Either way, we better get going, asap.</p>

<p>&gt; You are always so open, ready to list your name (real I assume) and allude occassionally to this incarceration you experienced - that it was a felony, etc.  Now you reveal it was for something you said.  You have my sympathy and your posts illustrate that not all prison inmates/former convicts are dull-witted barbarians, possessing low IQs.  But this description makes you a political prisoner, which is supposed to be impossible in the U.S.  I am really interested in how you could have been arrested for saying something and what that something was.  But I do not expect you to reveal it.  However, I am troubled at this information.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve been to prison, and while some readers believe that punishment should be a focus of that experience, these are folks who simply don&rsquo;t know what they are talking about.</p>
<p>One isn&rsquo;t prison to be punished.  Deliberate punishment of already maladjusted individuals would require that they not be let out later, because prisons would then be training camps for psychopaths.  Lexy Good is locked up for receiving stolen property.  Someday he&rsquo;ll be out, and he or someone very much like him will be living in a neighborhood near you.  Would you prefer a neighbor who is sorry he made a mistake to a violent lunatic?  I would.</p>
<p>One isn&rsquo;t in prison to be rehabilitated.  Other than A.A. and N.A. classes, there is usually no pre-release training of any sort available.  I was able to take a class on new and used vehicle sales, and then found out after my release that I could not get bonded and insured to do so, so with a degree in chemistry and 79 US and foreign patents, I ended up making sandwiches at Subway.  Nobody hires Americans as research chemists now, felony or no, multiple patents or no, so I am working on a welding certificate at Pikes Peak Community College.  All they did for us in federal prison was require high-school dropouts to finish a GED, and instruction was mediocre.  I know, because I was the one taking up the slack for the incompetant teachers, on my own time.  My students aced the math and science parts of the test.</p>
<p>One is in prison to be warehoused until that part of one&rsquo;s life that the court has decided to remove is gone.  That&rsquo;s all.  It will certainly change an individual.  One finds out who one&rsquo;s real friends are.  While I was locked up, the fellow I thought was my best friend was housesitting for me.  He stole everything that wasn&rsquo;t nailed down, and broke everything that was.  He was a TSA agent.  Now he&rsquo;s doing three-to-life with mandatory life on parole for molesting kids.  A former friend whom I had thought would never speak to me again wrote to me twice a month.  Old college friends sent me dozens of books, which I shared around the unit.  </p>
<p>Race relations were fairly good where I was locked up.  The shot-callers (bosses) simply didn&rsquo;t allow interracial violence, so race relations were guarded and careful, but cordial.  One of my gigs was doing laundry.  We were each expected to do our own laundry, but some inmates were lazy.  Others had never moved out of their mother&rsquo;s homes before being arrested and thought they had to separate whites from colors even in the drier.  It was four postage stamps or eight cigarettes a load, washed, dried and folded.  Some of my cusomers were black.  One just paid me to fold the laundry he did himself, because he said I folded it like his mom used to.  One stamp a load.  Another regular asked me my last evening in stir whether I could do his laundry the next day.  When I told him I was getting out, he looked annoyed at first, and then just grinned, shook my hand, and said he hoped he&rsquo;d never see me again.  I still do all the laundry at home.</p>
<p>The food started out pretty good - basically military chow, but rapidly got worse as the budget crisis deepened.  Issue clothing was one pair of steel-toed work shoes, and three each pairs of socks, boxer shorts, t-shirts, uniform trousers and uniform shirts.  I was allowed to choose two long-sleeved shirts and one short-sleeve shirt.  Coats were issued during the winter.  I bought my own sweatpants and sweatshirt and one pair of sneakers during those three years.  The sneakers eventually fell apart, despite my repeatedly sewing the uppers back onto the soles with dental floss (I did a lot of sewing work for other inmates, too.)  By the time my atheletic shoes gave up, I had scrounged another pair.  I used to stay up late in the dorm, and hit the &#8220;free stuff&#8221; shelf, late nights, mainly for the books that ended up there, but lots of shoes did as well.  One of my students got a nearly new pair of shoes in exactly his size, after I found them there.  I also gave him my alarm clock when I was released.  It is considered good prison manners to give away things one won&rsquo;t need on the outside, just before release.</p>
<p>I had contrived to be issued a new pair of work shoes, and never told my mother that she could send me release clothes, so I wore the new shoes out the gate (basically US navy &#8220;low quarters&#8221;) and they gave me a pair of &#8220;Rustler&#8221; blue jeans (now cutoffs, five years later) and a green Haynes pocket-T-shirt.  I kept the sweats handy, because my last month would be in a halfway house and I wanted something to sleep in.  The feds let me keep the socks and boxer shorts.  Those low-quarters are now a pair of dress shoes for occasions when my black Oxford wingtips are too good.  Most of the socks are gone, five years later.  The boxers are spare clothes at my mother&rsquo;s house.  </p>
<p>The things I missed the most in prison didn&rsquo;t include my home.  I&rsquo;d been away to college before, and lived in the dorms.  Prison in Ft. Worth was like being at a really bad state college.  I&rsquo;d lived in a one-room flat in Australia, and THEN I missed my home.  I most missed being able to get into my car and drive to the store to buy anything I wanted.  I missed quiet, until I discovered that by staying up late in the smoking room, I could be alone, drink coffee, smoke a cigarette, and write.  Yes, I smoked while I was in the feds.  I quit the evening before I walked out the gate.  I very much liked the combination of a cigarette and a cup of strong coffee, but nicotine never had much of a hold on me.  The only cigarettes I really liked were the first and the last each day.  I went through two packs a week.</p>
<p>I did three years of federal Supervised Release in reasonable peace, the city police here still think I&rsquo;m OK.  When I returned home, my P.O. walked around the neighborhood warning everyone I was back.  Some of the old-timers knocked on my door to say &#8220;welcome back&#8221;, but I still used to get the mail at night, just so nobody would see me. </p>
<p>Married now, with a daughter, I *still* can&rsquo;t drive to the store and buy anything I want, but it&rsquo;s a good thing now.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t harsh on the inmates too much.  Some of them are evil, but others are stupid, or merely unwise.</p>

			<p>&#8220;This integration was brought about because one whining Black inmate said his rights were being violated.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not really.  The ADL ACLU NOW SPLC crew looked long and hard for a black plaintiff.  They finally found one.</p>
<p>I spend many years in law enforcement.  Whenever any liberals start parroting the MSM propaganda about how unjust it is that so few whites are in prison, I simply tell them the truth.</p>
<p>By 1970 the blacks and their ADL ACLU lawyers were running the prisons.  The prospect of years of rape, torture and horror at the hands of the blacks and the judges and attorneys who enable them reformed many white criminals.</p>
<p>A white man was recently murdered by hispanics in Los Angeles city jail.  The hispanic guard left his post to deal with some laundry issues.  </p>
<p>Blacks and hispanics on the other hand, love prison.  </p>

<p>Posted by at 10:46 PM on May 27 </p>
<p>Correction:  &hellip;and ONE of HER racist, commie, White hating California judges agreed.</p>
<p>Note to &#8220;Just Say No&hellip;&#8221;  Your post is dead on the mark.  We can see it coming in so many ways.</p>
<p>This is already true in Great Britain where the long-ago disarmed citizenry (1920) are sitting ducks for their new multi-racial &#8220;mecca&#8221; and are prosecuted for even defending themselves during home invasions. You can see it coming here too as ALL the evidence points to it.  This was another planned step orchestrated by the usual subversives who intend the genocide of Whites just as is being done in Zimbabwe (mission almost complete there) and now South Africa. Start doing a little research of the history of those countries and learn how black Marxist rule was foisted on them, and in the case of South Africa with the threat of military warfare from our completely evil Western governments.  Research who the Marxists were in South Africa organizing the blacks who are themselves collectively too stupid to organize a tea party. </p>
<p>The whole sordid Jenna affair, the decades long suppression of black-on-white crime, demonizing Whites at every turn by those select few who own almost all our media (writer Michael Hoffman, himself a former reporter, has compiled an exemplary booklet of over 500 movies and television shows that cast Whites in the most hateful depictions imaginable that is itself criminal. It is NO accident, but by design for an agenda that has been long in the making. The implications are so horrific that most of us just refuse to connect-the-obvious dots or delve any further into it. </p>
<p>Make no mistake, this desegregation opinion will prove disasterous for the badly outnumbered Whites in prison, and as for those posters expressing no sympathy, remember this&hellip;There are hundreds of thousands of arbitrary laws on the books that enable our state and federal governments to go after just about anyone they see fit.  They are a hair&rsquo;s width away from criminalizing bloggers (google the &#8220;Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Commission&#8221; to see who the sponsors were) with their federalized relentless, odious &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; legislation already in existence in virtually every state.  It could very well be you next&hellip;    </p>
<p>Look at increasingly how employing &#8220;racist&#8221; language charges trumps ACTUAL physical crimes. The case cited below continues the long demonstrable propaganda by those who control our media of making any dubious claims that blacks make alleging racial epithets as the foregone gospel truth and thus mitigates ALL, while any motivational claims made by whites are instantly dismissed as &#8220;bogus.&#8221; </p>
<p>No matter how heinous the crime committed against Whites, the blacks by virtue of specious allegations of &#8220;shouting racial slurs&#8221; supported by the maim-stream establishment press, this female judge has once again sent the message that it&rsquo;s open season on Whitey. All&rsquo;s one has to do is falsely allege name-calling or noose plantings, and you can beat, rape, rob, maim and torture whites with abandon in the name of moral equivalency.</p>
<p>These infinite attacks from seemingly every conceivable angle by these Marxist PLANNERS are bankrolled with unimaginable wealth that is equal only to the perniciousness and racial hatred lurking in their supremacist souls.  </p>

			<p>There was no rape in the place I was locked up.  Really.  Nobody had ever heard of it actually happening.  There were some homosexuals who would pair up and do their thing, and one such pair were actually caught in a shower stall together.  They beat the write-up by saying that one was scrubbing the other&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>I was at a federal &#8220;low&#8221;.  That meant dormitory living.  We were locked into our buildings at night, and my unit had the top two floors.  The dorms at Ft. Worth were organized as follows: &#8220;Dallas&#8221; dorm was a hospice for terminally-ill inmates - AIDS, hepatitis-C, diabetes, and the like.  I was in there once to do some welding, and it smelled like dying people.  Not good.  &#8220;Ft. Worth&#8221; was for elderly and handicapped inmates, so it had wheelchair ramps and the like.  My four-story building had the other three dorms.  One floor - &#8220;San Antonio&#8221; was for drug offenders who were doing a 500-hour drug class as part of a sentence-reduction program.  &#8220;Austin&#8221; dorm, where I was was for healthy inmates who could work to maintain the complex.  This was on the top two floors and they were locked apart only during 4:00 PM count time.  The bottom floor of our building was &#8220;Houston&#8221; dorm, and these were guys like us who had messed up in one way or another, so they didn&rsquo;t have a pool table or as many TVs.</p>
<p>The other guys varied in background quite a bit.  One of my friends, a Jicarilla Apache, had been in for murder and mutiny since 1982.  He had killed two FBI agents on the reservation while deserting his post as an active-duty soldier.  His good behavior had allowed him to work down to a &#8220;low&#8221; cusody level.  Another friend had burned a cross on the lawn of a crack house, and since the state wouldn&rsquo;t prosecute him, the feds took the case as a civil rights violation.  My file says I taught a guy to read, but it isn&rsquo;t so.  My bunkmate could already read at a &#8220;Tip &amp; Mitten&#8221; level, and I merely brought him up to &#8220;Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology&#8221;.  He was built approximately like Frankenstein&rsquo;s monster, and had been caught driving to his meth cook&rsquo;s house with too much Sudafed (more than 500 pills).  This is a six-month federal misdemeanor.  He was also caught with illegal fireworks, a misdemeanor in Texas, but the feds called it a ten-year explosives enhacement, so he got 10.5 years on a pair of misdemeanors.  His public defender did a good job, and got him the max.  The fact that he was sent to a low and not a medium proves that he was not really considered dangerous.  </p>
<p>Most of us were non-violent offenders who were not camp-eligible.</p>
<p>The only serious inmate-on-inmate violence I recall was when a Puerto Rican called a Cuban a &#8220;snitch&#8221;.  The Cuban stabbed him right away.  That&rsquo;s also good prison manners: never snitch and never tolerate being called one.</p>
<p>To someone about to enter the system, I would offer the following advice: stay away from drugs, gambling, homosexuals, and blacks.  Some of the blacks are OK, but what about their friends?  Make a few close friends and stick with them like glue.  Wahr dich, wehr dich, wach auf.</p>

But in Western prisons world wide, ethnic minorities are 70%-80% of the total prison population. Wouldn&rsquo;t that make whites the minority in prison, so where are our extra rights? </p>
