<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu weighed in on the presidential campaign Tuesday in Chicago, praising America&rsquo;s ability to produce the first viable African-American presidential candidate while describing the nation as haunted by a racial divide that still offers blacks what he called only &#8220;the illusion of equality.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But he chided Americans for getting &#8220;very, very upset&#8221; with the pastor of Sen. Barack Obama, noting that Rev. Jeremiah Wright Jr. &#8220;may have said more crudely what, actually, almost every African-American would have wanted to say. I mean that is how they feel in your country, that race .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is a very, very real issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I think on the whole you keep trying to pretend it isn&rsquo;t,&#8221; he added, noting the issue will haunt Americans until there is a way to talk honestly about race, such as holding a reconciliation forum.</p>

					<p>I suppose these pontifications are meant to be prophetic, but Balaam&rsquo;s donkey made more sense. How can a sanctimonious gasbag like Archbishop Tutu possibly know what &#8220;almost every African-American would have wanted to say&#8221;? </p>
<p>My home is in a thoroughly multiracial neighborhood, and not one of the middle-class blacks I know well would identify the Rev. Dr. Jeremiah Wright as anything but a poisonous hypocrite, living comfortably at the expense of the system he works to destroy. </p>
<p>According to Tutu, &#8220;You [Americans] say to them [blacks], &#8216;You&rsquo;re equal, and the sky&rsquo;s the limit.&rsquo; And they keep bumping their heads against this thing that&rsquo;s stopping them from reaching out to the stars.&#8221;</p>
<p>Which &#8220;thing&#8221; is that? Whatever it is, it must be the very &#8220;thing&#8221; that cut off Michelle Obama with only two Ivy League degrees and a $300K-per-annum job as a diversity consultant, when she demanded the moon on a silver platter. </p>
<p>And while we&rsquo;re at it, let us think of the Rev. Dr. Jeremiah Wright&rsquo;s new megabuck house in a ritzy suburb. Oh, the frightful marginalization, the haunting need for a reconciliation forum! </p>

					<p>&#8220;I mean that is how they feel in your country, that race &hellip; is a very, very real issue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I think on the whole you keep trying to pretend it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he added, noting the issue will haunt Americans until there is a way to talk honestly about race, such as holding a reconciliation forum.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nobody white is trying to pretend that race isn&rsquo;t an issue, oh, mentally challenged one.  The majority of whites don&rsquo;t think much about it at all.  They&rsquo;re too busy with things much more important than constantly focusing on the crybaby whining that comes from nearly all blacks.</p>
<p>Only blacks concentrate on race to the exclusion of everything else, because they&rsquo;re incompetent and can&rsquo;t compete in a first world nation.  Raising the issue of racial injustice gives them an excuse for failing, and it gets their squeaky wheels oiled by white authority to the tune of affirmative action gimmes in school, work, and social benefits.  Racism is a profitable industry among black whiners.</p>
<p>Most whites go about their day to day business, struggling, trying to survive, caught up with the many problems that every day living and raising and maintaining their families entail.  If blacks could compete on an equal basis and could fit in with a civilized society, they would do the same.  But they can&rsquo;t, so they can&rsquo;t achieve the successes of other races.  Their racism industry is one that operates full force, 24/7, and that will continue on no matter if they were each awarded a million dollars.</p>
<p>Being black, this TuTu is on the exact same wave length as any other, so it is expected that he sing the same tune.  If they were honest, every black in this country, and elsewhere, would hold out his hand, palms up, every time he opened his mouth to make a public statement.  I mean, he might as well be truthful, it&rsquo;s very clear that everything he says is designed to get him something for free.<br>

<p>James Watson tried to talk honestly about race but look where it got him.  There will never be an honest open dialogue about race because all blacks want it that way. Any White that dares commit racial heresy by telling the truth will be crushed under the boot of the establishment.  </p>
<p>Reconciliation has many different meanings including understanding but also appeasement or settlement.  Whites have done quite enough of all three of these things and all blacks do is whine for more.  It&rsquo;s time to admit our differences are irreconcilable and go our separate ways.</p>

					<p>Equality is in fact an illusion, for it not to be an illusion blacks and whites would have to be equal in mental ability and behavior which they clearly are not. The <span class="caps">USA </span>offers blacks equal opportunity, equality on the other hand must be earned.</p>

					<p>What do you mean by equality?  If you mean the black class structure is being supported courtesy of the US Government and our tax dollars then I agree.  It not so much an illusion but artificial equality.  It doesn&rsquo;t come naturally from black talent, wealth creation or hard work.  </p>

					<p>Sub-Saharan Africa gained notoriety for its peoples&rsquo; slaughtering each other in hundred of thousands in tribal purges, yet Tutu gives himself a mandate to lecture and to judge the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>on &#8220;equality&#8221;.</p>
<p>Yet another absurd consequence of &#8220;Liberal&#8221; ideology and activism that submitted the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>to judgement of such narrow-minded individuals as Tutu.<br>

					<p>Expecting assimilation is not racist. If blacks would assimilate there would not be a need for an &#8220;honest&#8221; discussion of race. Reconciliation ends up being a one-sided diatribe that any disagreement with gets labeled as &#8220;racist.&#8221; </p>
<p>How about this..admit the opportunities are astounding here and that even our poverty is better than many other nations wealthy standards. Admit we are an industrious and inventive people and that you do benefit from it, and admit that if you did not view education as &#8220;white&#8221; you would have your share of the American Dream. <span class="caps">THEN </span>we could have an honest discussion of race.</p>
<p>I am willing to respect any man that acts like man, no matter his skin color. You can hate me all you want but if you are going to demand rights from the system my forefathers built then you must participate and contribute to it (if only that were still the standard.) Then we will get along, but until then we are not one nation under God and I do not owe you a thing except for the chance to participate. It is up to you to do so.</p>
<p>Being an uneducated (at least as concerns degrees) service worker there are many jobs that I do not get to do because the staff and management are black and do/will not hire whites, and you know what? That is natural and I probably wouldn&rsquo;t enjoy the loud work environment at those establishments anyway. No one makes them hire whites to keep the places diverse, no one looks into their hiring practices. Good. That is the way it should be for white and black..it is called freedom of association. Get over it.</p>
<p>If I were in a position of hiring people I would choose the one who is the most qualified, despite their race, because that makes good service and performance for whatever the business may be. If you can&rsquo;t keep up because you reject education as &#8220;white&#8221; that is your own racism and not mine.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s that for honest?</p>

					<p>Desmond Tutu has nothing to complain about in South Africa<br>
Blacks are Free at Last Free at Last..and have been running <br><br>
the country for 17 years. The results:<br><br>
1. Highest Murder rate in world<br><br>
2. Highest Rape rate in world<br><br>
3. Highest Child Rape rate in world (quite a state eh?)<br><br>
4. Highest <span class="caps">AIDS </span>rate in world<br><br>
5. 2nd Lowest Life expectancy rate in world 42 years  <br><br>
    (Black rule Zimbabwe has lowest..39 years!)<br><br>
6. Whites excluded from industries they built<br><br>
7. Infrastructure collapse, daily power outages<br><br>
8. Millons of rand gone missing as <span class="caps">ANC </span>enriches itself</p>

					<p>Sure Bishop Tutu, lets talk honestly about race for a change.  Despite all the self censorship, liberal wishful thinking and outright tyranny of a government that values diversity over truth, the scientific study of genes is proving that the African and their descendants have and will continue to have a disadvantageous intelligence gap when compared to whites or Asians.   No matter how much affirmative action is enforced, no matter how much the government tries to degrade the white race and our education systems so that we all become &#8220;equals, blacks will not reach the same average levels of accomplishments as whites because they have a lower intelligence level.  </p>
<p>Blacks themselves are starting to realize that and they desperately search for almost non-existent white racists to blame for their failings.  Because if you fail when everyone tells you that you are equal then their must be some evil conspiracy of whites that are making you fail.  Sorry but the truth is blacks in American fail because they don&rsquo;t value the personal habits and disciplines that make one successful in the modern world. The truth about the &#8220;average&#8221; white person is that  they don&rsquo;t think much about race.   Whites are the only culture on earth that doesn&rsquo;t put race and ethnicity first in their thoughts. </p>
<p>If we did think about ourselves and put our white race and culture first we wouldn&rsquo;t have betrayed our white brothers in Rhodesia and South Africa.   If we did put the welfare of the white race first we would have said the hell with Somolia and the Sudan and we would have put troops into Rhodesian and South Africa to stop the criminal genocidal attacks against white Africans by black criminals who are assisted by sympathetic black controlled governments.   Next time we want help in racial reconciliation from a representative of South Africa where your white minority is being disenfranchised, pushed from power, raped, murdered and stolen from we will be sure to give you a call.   </p>

					<p>So Desmond Tutu says that he, too, want to &#8220;talk honestly about race&#8221; in America? Somehow I rather doubt it.  I have yet to meet anyone in the &#8220;honest dialog about race&#8221; crowd who truly wants an honest dialog.  In fact, a good many of them want laws against &#8220;gate speech&#8221; to shut down honest discussion of race which does not conform to their ideological notions. </p>

					<p>I would have to trust the good Rev and believe what he say. I work in a very Afro dominated civil service environment. Blacks are the majority (there&rsquo;s also sizable Indian and Latin contingents-whitey is at best 25% of the workforce but probably get 65% of the work done but that&rsquo;s another story). Blacks do not hold back in front of me, they say what&rsquo;s on their minds. What they say is very Wrightish, black rage and white guilt served up as heavy as possible. There is no significant conservative voice in the black community so get over it-you may see Alan Keyes or Walter Williams talk sensibly and think wow there is hope for if that black person can be like that&hellip;but forget about it. They are rarities and insignificant in the grand scheme of things.  </p>

I agree, there is an &#8216;illusion of equality&rsquo; because we have created a wholly artificial system of social and political boondoggles that perpetuate the &#8216;illusion&rsquo; of equality.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t create equality in reality if &#8216;equality&rsquo; is only a politically correct driven illusion.</p>
<p>Believing equality is real and obtainable doesn&rsquo;t make it real and obtainable.<br>

					<p>But if someone like David Duke speaks for Whites in the same way, would the Archbishop think it&rsquo;s any different?</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t Americans face the facts?  One fact that is swept under the rug is black illegitimacy, which is the root cause of their familial and societal breakdown.</p>
<p>This is a root cause Rev. Wright could discuss rather than blaming others first.</p>

					<p>They refer to equality as though it is something automatically bestowed, yet they take no steps to improve themselves and still play the race card whenever they can. This shows a fundamental lack of brain development when wrongs of the past are perpetuated for their own sake. Instead of pulling themselves up, as many other groups have had to do, they loll about waiting for whitey to give them housing, pay them welfare and pay them to attend school. So even to a casual observer there is inequality yet it is because of no fault on the part of whites. </p>

					<p>There is certainly an illusion of equality.  The illusion is that American Blacks are in every way equal to Europeans in intellectual ability and work ethic fuels the push for illusory equal outcomes.  </p>

					<p>Rev. Wright doesn&rsquo;t say what other blacks would like to say, He says what they already say. And they can say it because they are black. A black who speaks against Whites is  Rev. So and so. A white who simply points out the truth is a Racist. That Mr. Tutu is equality in America.</p>

					<p>Desmond Tutu is not a Christian but a communist, anti-white, racist one in particular. Our Lord Jesus was for &#8221; equality &#8221; among people, not the immoral,unnatural &#8221; forced by the state &#8221; totaltarianism. Discrimmination is still discrimmination even when the &#8220;supposed &#8221; victim and oppressior are reversed.The white man is &#8221; breaking &#8221; under his self-imposed &#8221; burden &#8221; to elevated the non-white in every conceivable way. Non-whites have never imposed this &#8221; one way &#8221; task upon themselves and never will. Being totally dependant upon the west for &#8221; all the modern creature comforts &#8221; of a white-Christian society exposes minorities inferiority by their dependancy, then &#8221; shake down &#8221; attitude towards us.</p>

The last thing blacks want is an honest dialogue on race. What they want, as is exemplified by black &#8216;truth and reconciliation&rsquo; show trials, is an admission of guilt from whites.</p>
<p>Only after whites admit their &#8216;guilt&rsquo; will backs even consider talking to whites. And even after admitting their &#8216;guilt&rsquo; black resentment, demands, and reprisals only grow more intense.<br>

					<p>I think this whole &#8220;honest dialog about race&#8221; thing is a dishonest attempt by black leadership to squeeze more goodies, in the form of &#8220;reparations,&#8221; out of whitey.</p>
<p>If they can trick us into thinking it&rsquo;s safe to publically say what we think, they can scream &#8220;Racist!  See!  I told you so!&#8221;, and then pandering politicians will have an excuse to pass laws to openly transfer wealth from any white American who works for a living to every black person, who, of course &#8220;deserves&#8221; it for merely breathing.</p>
<p>Or, failing that, it&rsquo;ll give them the excuse to have the fun of rioting and looting.  Hey, from the black viewpoint, what&rsquo;s the downside?</p>

					<p>As usual, Tutu and others on the left say &#8220;equality&#8221; to really mean equal assets, whereas they pretend that they mean equal opportunity, a different thing entirely. For if we were truly to have an honest discussion on equal opportunity like Tutu says, we would have to address the laws, quotas, scholarships, media-bias, academia, social pressure to show favoritism in everyday life to minorities, etc- that give unequal <span class="caps">ADVANTAGE </span>to minorities. The unpleasant truth that America actually avoids talking about is that even after having 40 years of this shoved down white Americans&rsquo; throats, wrapped in delusional hypocritical lies, that blacks still are unable to keep up, and what all of the liberal nonsense actually shows is that it is due to their own inabilities.  </p>

					<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Sure Bishop Tutu, lets talk honestly about race for a change.</p>
<p>Honesty? From Desmond Tutu? You&rsquo;re jesting, right? He IS A <span class="caps">BLACK</span>! So never expect &#8220;honesty&#8221; from him. Particularly with his admission that <span class="caps">ALL</span> Black governed countries are dismal failures from every viewpoint. Crime, poverty, disease, always holding out their proverbial beggar-bowls to White nations being their &#8216;trademark.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We get this endless garbage Whites enslaved Africans. Whites held them down for centuries&hellip; etc., etc., ad nauseum. While the <span class="caps">TRUTH </span>is African were never able amount to much on their own. When Whites settled African lands, Blacks were indeed a minority, <span class="caps">NUMERICALLY</span>! Small scattered tribes. Their population growth explosion is a recent phenomenon! Blacks stupidly outbreeding their capability for producing food enough for themselves&hellip; <span class="caps">ANOTHER TRUTH</span> Tutu would hardly be willing to admit to.</p>
<p>Where are the fruits of Black intellectual genius, comparable to those of Whites over the centuries? A Black Aristotle or Pythagoras? A Black Da Vinci, a Black Newton, Edison, Stephenson? We get that garbage called &#8220;Black History&#8221; which turns out to be unsubstantiable claims. Telling us about those magnificent break-throughs, inventions, discoveries, etc. by those Black geniuses&hellip; Funny, how gullible people can actually <span class="caps">BELIEVE </span>that rot. No evidence, of course, no proof. Nothing supporting their outlandish claims to fame.</p>

					<p>I accept that Wright speaks for almost all blacks, and faithfully reflects their racist views. That in itself does not concern me. I am much more concerned that his thinking affects Obama enough that the Wright message will become the official black opinion during an Obama presidency.</p>
<p>Obama will give license to the national black thought process (who clearly speak with only one mind, as demonstrated by the near unanimity of their support for Obama) to expound on and elaborate the Wright views. These racist views may one day be considered mild once the nation and the liberal media officially accept black hate-speech as an official discourse on race as Tutu recommends. The outpouring of White guilt will be unbearable, and will be continuously stoked by a liberal media. The only way to assuage this grief will be through more governmental give-away programs, and reparations.</p>
<p>Just wait, within one month of Obama&rsquo;s inauguration there will be introduced into congress bills to provide reparations. The average White taxpayer will be asked, no, required, to give money to the likes of Oprah, Kobe Bryant, and Tiger Woods. Ten years after reparations are paid, there will be new charges of racism and demands for more give-aways to absolve the White race of its &#8220;racism&#8221;. And so it will go until America becomes the new South Africa.<br>

					<p>Why do they always say they want to talk about &#8220;race,&#8221; when they really want to talk about blacks? I&rsquo;m 40 YO and for my entire life, it seems like all Americans talk about is blacks and just how very horrible everything is for them. I mean seriously dude flip the frikkin record</p>

					<p>&#8220;Unlike in South Africa&rsquo;s apartheid era, he said, where blacks were treated as &#8220;nothing,&#8221; in America, &#8220;You say to them, &#8216;You&rsquo;re equal, and the sky&rsquo;s the limit.&rsquo; And they keep bumping their heads against this thing that&rsquo;s stopping them from reaching out to the stars.&#8221;</p>
<p>That thing they&rsquo;re bumping their heads against, old guy, is a little thing called &#8220;intelligence,&#8221; and they&rsquo;re restricted in what they can accomplish in a capitalist society because of it.  Every race in America has many people within their groups that succeed on their own except blacks.  </p>
<p>This Barack Obama also wants to invoke all sorts of extras for blacks only, because he complains that blacks aren&rsquo;t fully represented in US society.  Well, what is he going to do, grow them a new brain?  Or give them accreditation for the professions when they can&rsquo;t comprehend the subject matter? That&rsquo;s being done to a great extent right now, and the universities are burping out AA graduates who can barely read their diplomas.  </p>
<p> All the other races do better than blacks.  What has been done for them that hasn&rsquo;t been done for blacks?  As long as blacks and radical white liberals stay in denial, refusing to accept black inability, the black problem will remain.  However, blacks <span class="caps">CAN </span>find a place in the labor force, because many jobs are open to them, but they have proven time and again they would rather sell drugs or commit other crimes than dedicate themselves to learning a trade or occupation within their limited abilities.  Right now Hispanics are taking away all the jobs that blacks refuse to learn.</p>
<p>To claim that racism, poverty, or oppression holds blacks back is the greatest lie around today, and I&rsquo;m sick of hearing about it.  The bottom line is this:  Blacks can&rsquo;t get ahead, because the don&rsquo;t have the intelligence to be professionals, and they don&rsquo;t apply the dedication and discipline necessary to learn a trade or an occupation in the field of labor.<br>

					<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t Desmund mind his business in his own backyard. In fact, why don&rsquo;t all these pastors and popes and every other religious leader stick to matters of the spirit instead of telling us what we should be doing to correct matters of state. Their meddling has done enough damage! </p>

					<p>&ldquo;I mean that is how they feel in your country, that race &hellip; is a very, very real issue.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
Unlike South Africa, where race is not an issue.  For instance, there are no Black Empowerment mandates or racial quotas or anything like that in South Africa. Right, Des?</p>

					<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And I think on the whole you keep trying to pretend it isn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; he added, noting the issue will haunt Americans until there is a way to talk honestly about race, such as holding a reconciliation forum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking advice on American race relations from this wretched Red imp Comrade Tutu, would be like a mongoose seeking survival tips from a cobra. However, the godless old hyena does have one thing right, American whites must stop &ldquo;trying to pretend&rdquo; that race doesn&rsquo;t matter; quite the contrary, we must embrace the biological and societal significance of racial differences and act accordingly. </p>
<p>And that sure as hell does not mean holding a &ldquo;reconciliation forum,&rdquo; or whites apologizing for slavery!</p>
<p>We must stop deluding ourselves that our people are responsible for the &ldquo;state&rdquo; of African &ldquo;Americans,&rdquo; other than allowing them freedoms that they cannot and never will be able to handle. We must acknowledged, that their more base and primitive existence is not because of past &ldquo;white evils&rdquo; or the &ldquo;legacy of slavery,&rdquo; but because of intrinsic and unalterable inadequacies on the part of the black race as a group.</p>
<p>Then a logical solution should be employed to deal with this harsh reality; that solution would be called Apartheid, the most superb and equitable system for keeping blacks from devouring themselves, and whites as well.</p>
<p>End of story!<br>
