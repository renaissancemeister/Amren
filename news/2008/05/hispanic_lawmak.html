						<p>Rep. Joe Baca, chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, is steamed. Latinos have become a political &#8220;punching bag&#8221; this year, the California Democrat complained recently, attacked by &#8220;the misinformed&#8221; and &#8220;the misguided.&#8221;</p>
<p>Baca and other Latino lawmakers on Capitol Hill {snip} held a news conference on the steps of a House office building to denounce their leadership&rsquo;s willingness to cater to immigration critics by holding hearings on enforcement measures proposed by endangered Democratic moderates.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve threatened to block progress on immigration proposals backed by business interests and pushed by key Democrats, such as special visas for high-tech workers or agricultural help, unless leaders also move forward with comprehensive immigration legislation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lawmakers in the 20-member Hispanic Caucus know they are not going to get their political wish this year: another shot at comprehensive immigration legislation, something that died in the Senate last year. But they are frustrated that their party has not been aggressive at pushing back against the rhetoric of some conservatives.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Latino lawmakers are most upset about a proposal by conservative Democrat Heath Shuler, D-N.C., to step up border enforcement and tighten requirements forcing employers to verify the legal status of their workers. {snip}</p>
<p>Several dozen Democratic moderates, including Rep. Nick Lampson, D-Stafford, have angered the Hispanic caucus by signing the petition. In addition, Lampson has proposed legislation to double penalties against smugglers who bring criminals into the U.S.</p>
<p>The political consequences of a Hispanic rebellion &mdash; if it occurs &mdash; could be significant.</p>
<p>If alienated Latinos stay home from the polls in November, it could cost Democrats dearly in closely contested local elections in Texas, Arizona and other states. And if Hispanics conclude that their party is no different on immigration than presumptive Republican presidential candidate John McCain &mdash; a longtime supporter of comprehensive reform &mdash; it could tip the balance to the GOP in presidential contests in swing states such as New Mexico, Nevada and Colorado.<br>

			<p>   Since when has John McCain been a supporter of immigration reform? All he wanted to do was open the floodgates and allow 30+ million illegals to become citizens. John McCain  and Ted Kennedy were the two main conspirators behind that traitorous bill they tried to cram down our throats last year. THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A DEMOCRAT AND A REPUBLICAN ANYMORE!!!! We have been sold a bill of goods that are rotten at it&rsquo;s core. Look out America, the fat lady is no longer warming up, she has begun to sing. We have been sold out by our own government. Democrats and republicans both share the blame. Jorge Boosh is as guilty as Nancy Pelosi. I really think they should both go on a hunting trip with Dick Cheney.</p>

			<p>Hispanic lawmakers are upset with the Democrats, because the Democrats aren&rsquo;t working fast enough to make the United States into Mexico. Fools. The Democrats policies on immigration remind me of the high-tech workers that have to train their replacements in private industry. Idiots.</p>

			<p>Maybe Elvira Arellano could be on the ticket as Obama&rsquo;s VP? She&rsquo;s not a US citizen but in the times we live in it&rsquo;s seems almost trivial to follow the rule of law.  The Democratic Party had this election in their back pocket until Obama came along.  In my state the exit polls from that last primary polled two thirds of Whites who said they would stay home on Election Day if Obama is nominated.  This comes down to two choices; either pander to the black and brown hordes (10% and 6% of the electorate) and suffer probably the biggest defeat in US history or nominate Clinton for the shoe in.  Don&rsquo;t worry about the political fallout from the blacks.  They&rsquo;ve got no d**n place else to go and they know it!<br>

			<p>Clearly - only Hispanic access to our country is important here and attempting to manipulate candidates with their vote to get their way. They have no interest in the US and what is best for our country - only how to keep the floodgates open for their pillaging.</p>

			<p>Rep Joe Baca thinks that:</p>
<p>Latinos have become a political &ldquo;punching bag&rdquo; this year, the California Democrat complained recently, attacked by &ldquo;the misinformed&rdquo; and &ldquo;the misguided.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No Joe white Americans used to be &#8220;misinformed and misguided&#8221; but thanks to the increasing evidence provided by you and other shrill racial spoils champions we are waking up to what has really been going on in this country.  White America is starting to understand that if we don&rsquo;t put a stop to unlimited immigration and the racial spoils system that we will be doomed to live in a third world nation by the mid-21st century.  Guess what?  That is not in the interest of the white majority of this country OR the blacks who are being pushed down even further in the racial pecking order. </p>
<p>We are on to your little game of increasing your political power by promoting unlimited hispanic immigration and your goal of taking over large sections of the United States of America &#8220;por La Raza&#8221; and the expense of all &#8220;otras&#8221;.   Thanks to your organizers who showed us hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens waving Mexican flags and refusing to be &#8220;melted down&#8221; into loyal Americans.   Thanks to your rich and corrupt Mexican politicians who have made it clear that &#8220;where ever there is a Mexican is Mexico.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hey American farmers, if you haven&rsquo;t been completely corrupted by the promises of unlimited slave labor and ever soaring profits by the globalist schemers, please invest in more technology to pick those fruits and vegetables.  You know it exist and your children&rsquo;s children will bless you for it.  Hey politicians America is waking up to the global conspiracy that has thrown open the borders of the west.  Guess what not all of us are brain dead and some of us kind of LOVE and VALUE OUR TRADITIONAL FREEDOMS AND OUR AMERICAN NATION.  We aren&rsquo;t going to give it up without a fight you globalist traitors.</p>
<p>Write your congressman every week and tell them that we are way past the point where we are just going to demand a stop to illegal immigration.  Now nothing short of a ten year moratorium on ALL immigration is called for and don&rsquo;t think we aren&rsquo;t looking for all your little back door sneak attempts to increase legal immigration that takes jobs from Americans and depresses wages across the board.  Guess what, both conservative cultural Republican voters and blue collar working man Democratic voters can agree that what you traitors are doing to us is evil and against the will of the vast majority of this county. </p>

			<p>Better yet, why don&rsquo;t we tell all the disaffected Hispanics that if they don&rsquo;t like what&rsquo;s going on here. they can all go back to the hell-hole of a country they came from. Then they wouldn&rsquo;t have to sponge off the rest of us and then tell us that we&rsquo;re no good.</p>

<p>Upset. Angry. Get used to it, as law breaking illegal aliens will forever  find themselves unsuccessful and unwelcome in a first world society. Even hispanic &#8220;lawmakers&#8221; (almost an oxymoron) can&rsquo;t comprehend it, because they come from the same stock. The failed &#8216;civilization&rsquo; of mexico will never succeed, on either side of the border. It&rsquo;s the people, stupid. </p>
<p>Comply with our laws, and depart. Or be deported. Your choice. </p>

			<p>What a novel concept, enforce the border and check the legal status of workers. What will they think of next, enforcing all the laws? Democrat or Republican, they will pander to the little brown menace because a vote is a vote, right? This is an invasion of our country, and anyone who doesn&rsquo;t believe it should spend a day with me, on the front lines. They should have tanks and ifv&rsquo;s protecting that border. I thought this was a sovereign country.</p>

<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t agree with her politics, you must admit that any efforts that support this &#8216;voting block&rsquo; is at least a small step in the right direction for the white race.</p>

			<p>June is apparently correct if one looks at what American hispanics, elected to office routinely do. They are not Hispanic &#8220;lawmakers&#8221;, they are hispanic &#8220;lawbreakers&#8221;. Despite the fact that Mexico enjoys a priviledged status when it comes to &#8220;Legal Immigration&#8221;, it isn&rsquo;t enough for Joe Baca and the reconquistas. They clearly want to change the U.S. into Mexico. It ain&rsquo;t gonna happen.</p>

<p>I call it hilarious.  The hispanic vote will reach parity with the blacks by the next Presidential Election in 2012.  After that the voting gap will get wider and wider.  They won&rsquo;t be able to appease both of them so one will have to go.  With the higher growth in hispanics, it will be the blacks that get the shaft.  </p>

			<p>Since sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander, I think we should replace all our politicians with Mexicans and Indians on a new type of special visa.  They couldn&rsquo;t possibly do a worse job than ours, and we could pay them minimum wage.</p>
<p>Since we already have an H-1b visa for high-tech workers, we could call the politician visa the F-U2 visa, after its acronym.</p>

			<p>Hey Folks, This might be off topic concerning this article but not concerning those who visit AR.  Read between the lines with Hillarys comments about Whites. <br>
It&rsquo;s a strategy on the part of the Obama/Clinton &#8216;08 Campaign. This is what the PC crowd has been waiting for and the moment has arrived.  Non-Whites and Women (Non-White friendly, Anti-White Male, Feminists) running things.  After all didn&rsquo;t Bill Clinton publicly say that a Non-White America was a good thing and what we needed?  This would only fulfill HIS dream. <br>
So she makes this comment to show she cares for us, and we all know she positively does not care for us any more than her husband did. But she DOES have contempt for us, as does Obama.<br>
And THAT would justify the cynicism behind her attempt to identify with us, especially when she knows how desperate we are for some, even a little, Political representation.</p>
<p>No, her comments, following Obamas, was the brain-child of one of them or someone on their Staff, and then plotted out in a meeting room and hatched, like a new born chick, at the right moment, in the right order (first his comment, then hers) to their willing accomplices in the Press. Sheer head to toe Show Business.  The Campaign just like something on TV, part Soap Opera, part Sunday morning Political Program, to suit the mentality and intellectual ability of its audience, shallow (the Non-Whites) and pretentious (the &#8220;Enlightened&#8221; Whites). Though both share the same features. </p>
<p>No folks, it was just their carefully staged, choreographed attempt, to fool us all by having Obama and Clinton play a bit of &#8220;Good Cop - Bad Cop&#8221; to fool us into voting them into Office and thereby participating in our own destruction. Nothign more. Politics is all about favors, and there is NOTHING we&rsquo;re going to get from them in return for our votes.  Well, that&rsquo;s not entirely true. We&rsquo;re going to get something, but it won&rsquo;t be a favor. In an uncertain world that is something we can all count on.<br>
