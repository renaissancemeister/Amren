<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>The Houston rodeo has rejected a U.S. Justice Department offer to mediate disputes with minority groups who say it needs more minorities in high-ranking positions, doesn&rsquo;t give scholarships to noncitizens in the country legally and has stopped featuring Tejano performers on its main stages.</p>
<p>The Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo does not believe mediation is needed because it promotes diversity and does not engage in discrimination, said chief operating officer Leroy Shafer.</p>
<p>&#8220;At this point, we see no need to have a Justice Department mediator involved in this,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&rsquo;ve heard (the minority groups&rsquo;) issues. We think they are all pointless.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Boycott was urged</b></p>
<p>The officials and groups sought mediation after some of them protested the rodeo&rsquo;s decision not to include Tejano groups on main venues at this year&rsquo;s show. The groups also urged Hispanics to boycott the rodeo.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Justice Department has not launched an investigation of the rodeo, but is merely seeking to mediate the dispute.</p>
<p>If the rodeo and minority groups agreed, a nonbinding memorandum of understanding could be reached through mediation. It would lay out goals that the rodeo would try to attain.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Shafer said he doesn&rsquo;t know how many minorities serve on the board because the rodeo doesn&rsquo;t track members&rsquo; ethnicities.</p>
<p>The rodeo, he said, successfully has boosted the number of minorities who serve as volunteers during the past 25 years.</p>
<p>But volunteers are promoted in part based on years of service and donations, he said. Executive committee members have put in 37 years of volunteering, on average, he said.</p>
<p>Many minorities and women, meanwhile, are rising through the ranks, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would not be fair to people out here to have a quota system,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s just like you don&rsquo;t go to work for Exxon and say you want to be the president the next day. You&rsquo;ve got to work your way up there.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Got a late start</b></p>
<p>Mata said minorities can&rsquo;t match Anglos&rsquo; length of service because they didn&rsquo;t feel welcome at the rodeo years ago, and the rodeo should develop a process that would infuse more minorities into higher ranking posts.</p>
<p>Shafer defended the rodeo&rsquo;s practice of excluding noncitizens in the country legally from scholarship awards, a policy set by the executive committee. The rodeo, he said, receives a glut of scholarship applications.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Shafer said the rodeo stopped featuring Tejano music on main stages because &#8220;Tejano music is not selling. Everybody knows that except the Tejano artists producing it and a few activists.&#8221;<br>

			<p>Here we are. Beyond belief. The country is being flooded with illegal aliens and the &#8216;Justice Department&rsquo; is going after rodeo shows. Can this &#8216;government&rsquo; become more ridiculous???? </p>

			<p>Here is where the real problem begins:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shafer defended the rodeo&rsquo;s practice of excluding noncitizens in the country legally from scholarship awards, a policy set by the executive committee. The rodeo, he said, receives a glut of scholarship applications.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There should  not have to be any &ldquo;defense&rdquo; for excluding &ldquo;noncitizens&rdquo; (read, alien invaders) from anything. That even includes: exchange students, tourists, &ldquo;refugees,&rdquo; or  other legal &ldquo;residents&rdquo; and transients. Such people, are not citizens and thus do not have the rights of citizens. I do not care if that includes something as commonplace as access to a rodeo&rsquo;s employment, or as important as voting in our elections; they are not and never should be afforded such privileges, ever!</p>
<p>To say otherwise, to argue otherwise, is to demonstrate a form of idiocy or treason so abject, that no words could ever fully describe the mindset of the wretched curs so afflicted with it.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s hoping they&rsquo;re successful.  </p>
<p>Now if they can just convince them to boycott the US.<br>

<i>The groups also urged Hispanics to boycott the rodeo.</i></p>
<p>These people are so caught up in their own lies and propaganda that they believe they matter; that if they didn&rsquo;t show up, the rodeo (and by extension, the US) would come to a screeching halt.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s hoping they don&rsquo;t come. I&rsquo;m sure the rodeo will be far more enjoyable without them and their &#8216;jump throw my hoop&rsquo; demands.</p>

I would also say that this is an example of why minorities are increasingly despised.</p>
<p>The audacity of these people to come to our country, our neighborhoods, our schools, our events and tell us how they should be run&hellip;</p>
<p>I have some choice words but they won&rsquo;t make it past the filter or the moderator.</p>
<p>Start your own damn hispanic rodeo. Leave this one alone.<br>

			<p>     Ultimately, the Hispanics would want bullfights and horse<br>
tripping. But that&rsquo;s not rodeo. That&rsquo;s not our culture. They<br>
have eneough money to start their own &#8220;rodeos&#8221; and they should<br>
do that and stop trying to pervert our&rsquo;s. Good luck with the <br>
animal rights activists, who hate all people equally irrespective<br>
of color. </p>

			<p>The same kind of thing happens in the UK - tho&rsquo; not with rodeos fo course. But it&rsquo;s the same idiotic thinking that rules both countries - in fact it rules the West. </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve seen rodeo clowns who are clearly more intelligent than mata.  Yeah, let&rsquo;s force tejano music on people who clearly don&rsquo;t like this music, then we&rsquo;ll claim they&rsquo;re racist because they like other music better. I say do away with ALL scholarships in the U.S. except academic types.</p>

			<p>    Johnny Mata and LULAC actually did call for a Hispanic boycott of the rodeo earlier this year, but the boycott was widely ignored.  As a rule, and apart from the activists,  Hispanics in Houston seem well pleased with the Rodeo and the attendant festivities, given how many attend and participate.  Also, Chibueze Amanchukwu, the young man in the picture attached to the story, seems extremely disgruntled as he examines his scholarship check;  a check issued courtesy of the rodeo.  His father seems angry at the injustice as well.  </p>

			<p>It sure looks like the liberal/neocon alliance remains focused on its goal to &#8220;Hispanicise&#8221; America, in little ways as ell as big.  Make no mistake, these elites are using Hispanics (or &#8220;Latinos,&#8221; if you prefer) as a tool to exacerbate the decline of the middle class.</p>
<p>The liberal/neocon alliance hates the middle class and wants to see it destroyed. </p>

			<p>Good grief, what next? Demands for more immigrants in the country music hall of fame?  Rodeo is quintessentially American. Nobody&rsquo;s stopping these people from enjoying it, but they want to run it.  Actually, that complaint about scholarships for non-citizens is so far out, I think all they really want to do is make trouble.</p>

			<p>MINORITIES? When do Hispanics lose THAT label and the rights and privileges bestowed with it?</p>
<p>The idea that people should be entitled to an altered past is so illogical. Volunteering, service, and donations over four decades got people position on the boards. THIS developed their experience and qualifications! Hispanics have the opportunity to do the same, but they want a shortcut because back then they &#8220;didn&rsquo;t feel welcome&#8221;. That&rsquo;s just an assumption - I&rsquo;m sure this isn&rsquo;t coming from any actual Hispanics that were involved with the rodeo 40 years ago!</p>

			<p>What would happen if I went to Mexico and demanded a spot on the bullfight organization committee. Maybe they could use a spot of &#8216;diversity.&rsquo; Maybe I should go. </p>

			<p>When they say they are urging Hispanics to boycott what they mean is they are urging left wing racist latinos to boycott.  Hispanics are having a tough time in their own communities due to lack of trust and lack of solidarity since they are diverse and therefore solidarity amongst them is an illusion only.  Many Hispanics will look at this pointless temper tantrum by the radical racist and misguided latinos as another sad chapter.  Maybe the same racist latinos will promote imperialism by Yankees into their homeland countries as they try to promote latino imperialism here in the USA. </p>

			<p>The year was 1999 when I moved to L.A..  I was looking at a house that was for sale in Van Nuys and a Hispanic man approached me and said &#8220;This street is only for Mexicans&#8221;. I was too tired to argue with him and wasn&rsquo;t interested in the house so I just walked away.  The writing was on the wall in 1999. Apathy will be the demise of all American Citizens no matter what race they are.</p>

			<p>Are we really supposed to believe that the same people who feel just fine about demanding top managerial jobs at the rodeo now were the same ones who say they felt &#8220;uncomfortable&#8221; starting in on the ground floor 15 years ago?  That seems pretty thin to me.</p>
<p>My sister helps organize the &#8220;mutton bustin&#8221; event (little kids riding sheep) at the rodeo here.  She&rsquo;s been doing it, unpaid, for years, because she enjoys it.</p>

Actually yes. I will one up you. Dollars to doughnuts that this all started as a result of actions by la raza, maldef, or lulac. These groups get much of their fudning from US taxpayers. So our gov&rsquo;t is also using OUR $ to fund this nonsense. What a world.</p>
<p>One other note, I am from Texas. Rodeos are traditionally an anglo thing. See very few other races in the past. A few hispanics but no others (at least for the small town rodeos). So why is it fair that something that is dominated by whites (audience and participants) be forced to hire minorities disporportionate to their attendance? Really, at all but for arguments sake&hellip;. Why doesn&rsquo;t the jusitce dept force the NAACP or la raza to have a representative share of top leaders in their orgs? I won&rsquo;t hold my breath for a rational answer. The double standard is getting mighty tiresome for this old cowpoke.</p>
