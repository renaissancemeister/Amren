<h1><a href="https://www.axcessnews.com/index.php/articles/show/id/16046">New Report Examines Race, Gender Gaps in Academic Achievement</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sharise M. Darby, AXcess News, May 21, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Blacks and Hispanics are falling behind in academic achievement, according to a report issued this week. These two groups have proportionately fewer graduates from high school and college compared to whites and Asian-Americans.</p>
<p>In the report, the American Association of University Women analyzes girls&rsquo; academic achievement over the last 35 years and the differences in academic achievement by race and family income.</p>
<p>According to the report, blacks and Hispanics are less likely to graduate from high school and attend college than white students, and smaller percentages of black men earn college degrees compared to their proportion of the general population.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At Clemson University, in Clemson, S.C., the Charles H. Houston Center for the Study of the Black Experience in Education examines and addresses issues in education that affect blacks at all levels.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to make sure that our work and our issues are not just addressing the deficit that exists between African-Americans and other groups,&#8221; said Lamont Flowers, distinguished professor of educational leadership at Clemson and the center&rsquo;s director. &#8220;We take a systematic view of education, particularly for African-Americans, and we are trying to better understand what is happening to improve their education and outcomes,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The center conducts research and program evaluations, creates educational programs and pursues collaborations and partnerships.</p>
<p>By 2011, the center hopes to conduct research into academic, social, economic and historical issues that affect African-Americans in the state and the country.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Beyond race, students&rsquo; family income can also affect their academic achievement in high school and college.</p>
<p>The National Center for Education Statistics reported that children from lower-income families are less likely than children from higher-income families to graduate from high school. Sudents from lower-income families were approximately five times more likely than students from higher-income families to drop out of high school in 2003, the most recent year for which statistics were available.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poverty and income relate very closely to the type of educational experiences students receive,&#8221; Flowers said. &#8220;It also relates to the type of community a student may be in. In many disadvantaged communities, there are disadvantaged schools that follow. The economic factor is a very real indicator of achievement.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Over the past few years, the gaps in college graduation have decreased between women and men, but these gaps are still apparent through race and ethnicity.</p>
<p>Hill said that the report focuses on the decrease in the achievement gap between girls and boys, but she said African-Americans and Hispanics need attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;African-Americans and Hispanics are not getting the education they deserve and need,&#8221; Hill said. &#8220;Education is not a zero sum gain, so we should be improving education for all children.</p>

<p>Excuse me, but the tools of &#8220;education&#8221; are the SAME no matter where you go; a $75 book, time and an instructor to teach you the BASICS.</p>
<p>How on earth are &#8220;African-Americans and Hispanics&#8221; being denied that by ANYONE?</p>

			<p>To improve education, you have to increase the standards. There&rsquo;s the rub. Where does that leave the blacks and hispanics?<br>
Out in the cold I&rsquo;d guess.</p>

			<p>The America Association of University Women is a leftist, anti-male, hate group.  About ten years ago, they put out a report claiming the the reason that &#8220;only&#8221; 80% of women with breast cancer survived was that too many medical researchers were men, who didn&rsquo;t care enough about women.  They are without credibility.</p>

			<p>Hmm, where have I heard this lament before?   Let&rsquo;s see, I think I first heard it in 1964 (though I don&rsquo;t think Hispanics were mentioned then, 1965-66-67, right up to &#8216;08, every year, with monotonous regularity.  Blacks have always been denied educational opportunities.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t I believe this?  In fact, I doubt that anybody believes this, though it&rsquo;s established dogma to which we all must pay all due lip service, at least publicly.</p>

			<p>The whole jist of this, is as any sane person can see, is typical liberal insanity. It is absolutely impossible to give someone an education. They can only be offered one. Those offered must be capable of acheiving it. GOD is D  &mdash;    &mdash;  -g America.</p>

			<p>Can these twits find anyplace in the world where Blacks and Hispanics can educationally compete with Whites?  A large percentage of the Hispanics coming into the country now are illiterate in Spanish and have had almost no schooling.  Apparently we are supposed to wave our magic Whitey wand and fix the problem for them.  Blacks and Hispanics have overall lower intelligence then Whites coupled with the fact that Blacks and Hispanics don&rsquo;t study   &mdash;   but Blacks can spend hours playing basketball, video games  and listening to Rap music.  </p>

			<p>Actually, they are getting exactly what they deserve from their behavior. If you fail to get to school on time or at all, fail to do your homework and show up prepared, spend half your day listening to mindless pop music instead of paying attention and learning, have little to no concern for your own future, then you end up with a poor education which is exactly what one deserves who behaves like that no matter what their race. </p>

			<p>Another study, another factually puzzled &#8220;intellect.&#8221;  These studies only prove one thing to me, and it is that &#8220;people of color&#8221; would rather lie to themselves than accept fact.  One could almost see the missing cognitive reasoning abilities, or the absence of critical thinking skills, and even the lack of any sort of previous research that proves contradictory.  </p>
<p>Legitmate, factual science can not be disproven, and that causes these junk scientists and &#8220;intellects&#8221; to request even more of my tax dollars to fund even more of these assinine, repetitive, and worst of all, expensive studies.</p>

			<p>One can always hear blacks blaming the &#8220;inferior&#8221; education for the poor grades that they always get, but they never can explain why the asian kids who sit in the same classrooms get As, or how so many black students ostracise blacks who do get good grades because they are acting &#8216;white&#8221;.That kind of mentality is a good indicator of how much they hate whitey.</p>

<p>I concur. But having experienced the public school system in America, I must say some of the teachers are incompetent and/or really don&rsquo;t care. Also if a kid&rsquo;s parents criticizes you for giving his/her kid too much work, then you know the problem is even much bigger.  </p>

			<p>Society just doesn&rsquo;t get it.  How many more demonstrable studies/stories/occurrences do we have to endure before we realize there is a difference between the races when it comes to everything&hellip;.including intelligence.  Study after study after study: Whites and Asians at the top, blacks and hispanics at the bottom and everyone else in the middle.</p>

			<p>Children with married parents who believe in education and have good jobs out-perform all other groups in school. This explains why Asians are doing so well in school and blacks are doing so poorly.</p>
<p>Better families = Better students</p>
<p>Considering how poor it is here in SE Asia, it is amazing how good the students are. We have almost no divorce and everyone respects education. Sort of like the USA was back in the 1950&rsquo;s.</p>

They all sit in the same classroom, listening to the same lectures from the same teachers, reading the same books, doing the same assignments, under the same time constraints.</p>
<p>How are they not getting the education they deserve since everyone is getting the same eduction under the same conditions?</p>

			<p>I was forced to attend an Obama rally, and he mentioned that Whites were getting an &#8220;unfair&#8221; advantage over Blacks and Hispanics, in education. He spoke a few words and phrases in Spanish. A truly racist Hispanic politician attended the Obama rally. I think there is an intention to unite Blacks and Brown Hispanics in a coalition, against Whites. </p>
<p>Collective racial Non-White (especially Brown and Black)  Nationalism?</p>
<p>But something tells me, this &#8220;coalition&#8221; is not made to last forever, everywhere. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Blacks and Hispanics are falling behind in academic achievement, according to a report issued this week.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8216;Falling behind?&rsquo;  This wrongly implies that their achievements have diminished from a position of parity with their White and Asian counterparts. </p>

			<p>This type of blatant false propaganda must be fought by all who have the ability to reason correctly and who love their country and its future well-being.  Why is it so many Marxists, although many may not realise that they are espousing that failed system, think that the pursuit of mediocrity is better that the pursuit of excellence.  The latter is what has made the West, especially the USA, the advanced and great countries they are.</p>
<p>It is up to the students to work hard and overcome any problems they may have outside of the school.  I had to spend my first years in school in a country (England) that was being bombed most days by the Nazis. I remember seeing the V1s and the results of one V2 rocket bombs as well.  (Google if you do not know of these.) My parents were not well educated but they made sure that my brother and I were by insisting on hard work at school so we could have a better life than they did.  And we did.  I even worked as an engineer in the USA for two years while my government was buying 170 McDonnell Douglas Phantom fighter bombers.  Loved the place.</p>
<p>For all our sakes, do not let these propagandists do the same as has happened to South Africa where the Marxists persuaded the world that &#8220;evil Apartheid&#8221; had to go to be replaced with a regime that is now taking the country the same route as Mugabe&rsquo;s Zimbabwe.   Write to your newspapers and TV stations voicing your considered (polite) opinions, for volume mail will affect their opinons as well.  And write to these organisations suggesting that perhaps there is more to the failing black experience than they wish to admit, but eventually will have to so that steps can be effectively taken to resolve the situation economically and to the benefit of everybody.  That does not mean awarding unearned school certificates.  Please remember, &#8220;pursuit of excellence&#8221; is the governing criteria.</p>
<p>God Bless America. </p>

			<p>Here is how you can get the education you deserve: Sit down. Shut up. Open book. Read. Write.<br>
  Follow this and you will learn, no matter what you background or race is. Even stupid people can learn.<br>
   I just don&rsquo;t see blacks and hispanics doing this. </p>

			<p>Well my mom grew up poor in Mississippi. When she was young, they  had no electricity for awhile and used an outhouse. However, she said their small house was always clean, she and her brother were strictly disciplined by their parents who demanded moral behavior and good grades and that they go on to college.  My mom finished college with an A average and her parents scrimped and saved the small amount they had to send her. </p>

			<p>I notice how &#8220;they&#8221; say that minorities are not &#8220;GIVEN&#8221; this or that. They are not &#8220;given&#8221; an opportunity. They are not &#8220;given&#8221; money for school, they are not &#8220;given&#8221; an education.</p>
<p>You EARN these things.  </p>

			<p>I grew up in a run-down house without electricity, running water, or telephone, on a dirt road so narrow that the bushes on both side swept both sides of any car going up or down the road (if two cars met, one had to back up until  they came to a wider place in the road.  From our house you would look across our fields and see nothing but trees.  Neighbors were anyone who lived within two miles.</p>
<p>It took me ten years to et through college, but I got through and have since gotten a Masters.</p>
<p>Now these Black and Hispanic kids, who have been given everything on a silver platter, are complaining because the schools don&rsquo;t pay enough attention to them.  Well, la-de-da.  Let them learn that they have to work to get ahead just as much as I did.</p>

			<p>The underlying belief of liberalism is that all human beings are the same  &mdash;   not equal but the same. In other words there is no difference between the races or sexes and any differences that do show up are immediatly judged as &#8220;racist&#8221; or &#8220;sexist&#8221;. Whites and Asians do better academically, men do better at scientific and mathematic tasks than women with notable exceptions. You can have all of the special academic programs that you want but you cannot change innate behavior and inborn traits. </p>

			<p>I am so sick and tired of  the excuse liberal/progressives constantly use to excuse the poor academic performance of many minorities, namely, the lack of up to date educational resources, etc.</p>
<p>My attitude has always been that technology can do something for us yes, but without understanding the underlying logic in what the technology is doing, we are no different from a parrot who can count to ten minlessly pecking out the sequence that it has learned through conditioning.</p>
<p>Plato, Aristotle, and other great teachers throughout history taught and created geniuses without the help of computers, for example. Also, many of the students of genius throughout history came from very poor families, circumstances,etc., yet the liberal/progressives in the educational establishment alwyas try to make someones background some decisive reason for their academic failures.</p>

			<p>An observation from Russia.</p>
<p>This is am entrance examination at a Black college. In the room there is a wall with three apertures: round, square, and three-cornered. The object is to insert three figures: a cube, a triangle pyramid, and a ball into the  corresponding holes. <br>
The winners go in two groups: the super-intelligent and the super-strong. <br>

			<p>&#8220;According to the report, blacks and Hispanics are less likely to graduate from high school and attend college than white students, and smaller percentages of black men earn college degrees compared to their proportion of the general population.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hardly a news bulletin, since there has never been a time when this was not true. Liberal academia keeps inventing trendy new methods in their quest for different educational results - a bizarre symptom of the mental retardation that springs from their egalitarian (socialist) fanaticism.</p>
<p>The results will never improve, because the capability required is absent.</p>

			<p>&#8220;By 2011, the center hopes to conduct research into academic, social, economic and historical issues that affect African-Americans in the state and the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>As usual, the study glosses over cultural causes, which are the real reason.  Their perpetual failure is always someone else&rsquo;s fault.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Blacks and Hispanics are falling behind in academic achievement, according to a report issued this week. These two groups have proportionately fewer graduates from high school and college compared to whites and Asian-Americans.&#8221;</p>
<p>This can be attributed to dysgenics; i.e.,IQ is largely heritable and statistics reveal that people with the lowest IQ have higher birth rates than those with higher IQ. This phenomenon cuts across all races, btw. A glimpse of the future can be viewed via the movie &#8220;Idiocracy.&#8221; </p>
<p>So why waste time and money on misleading reports written by loopy liberals? The research has already been done. The results are in. It all can be found in &#8220;The Bell Curve&#8221; by Murray and Herrnstein. </p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an eye-opener for you folks! Black kids do poorly BECAUSE THEY&rsquo;RE BLACKS!!! But since they&rsquo;re more interested in filling their heads with trash (rap) music, Black History (fairy tales) about what magnificent geniuses came from Africans and Afro-Americans throughout the last 50,000 years&hellip; why bother LEARNING anything practical in school. With their gangsta culture currently in vogue,  only an idiot would actually have to WORK for a living, right? Nor does Blacks&rsquo; high family income automatically guarantee their children will follow their parents&rsquo; example. Guess again!</p>

			<p>What is the answer?  Special tutoring for minorities? That is the case in Howard County, MD and probably elsewhere. What was that about equal protection?</p>
