						<p>As San Francisco&rsquo;s population of African American residents has decreased in recent years, the population of black men and women locked up in the San Francisco County Jail has increased dramatically, Sheriff Michael Hennessey said.</p>
<p>More than 60 percent of all prisoners are African American, according to a survey of the city jail&rsquo;s population. And of the 282 female prisoners, 67 percent are black.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In contrast, 6.7 percent of San Francisco residents are black &mdash; a number that has been in steady decline, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>

<p>That wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad statistic if one didn&rsquo;t know that most others there SF residents are ultra-lib aging hippies, yippies, flippies, and dippies.</p>
<p>If it were up to the limo libs out there they would have a proportionate percentage of Africans that matched the U. S. population.</p>
<p>Oops, I almost forgot that it&rsquo;s those dratted open space laws and rent controls that keep those poor Africans out.  Could that be a coincidence? </p>

					<p>Thanks to <span class="caps">AMREN&rsquo;</span>s &#8220;Color of Crime&#8221; stats, this comes as no surprise.  AS we know, the Rev. Wright preached about how unfair the Criminal Justice System was to blacks and was especially upset about the three strike laws.  This is how most blacks  rationalize the phenomenon of this outrageous imbalance. Sen. Obama listened to these rants for 20 years and obviously believes them.  You can only speculate on what &#8220;President Obama&#8221; would do to address this perceived injustice.  Among other things, one obvious answer would be to appoint black supreme court justices.  However, in order to believe that all blacks are discriminated against in the court system, you would have to believe that all the courts in the country participate in the discrimination.  A giant conspiracy?</p>

					<p>I guess this is the White Man&rsquo;s fault.  We should be more sensative to the needs of Blacks.  The Police and courts have no business locking up poor blacks for robbery, rape, and murder.  This is the thinking of a majority of blacks.  Or maybe, in the words of the good Reverand Wright, the black community&rsquo;s chicken&rsquo;s have come home to roost.    </p>

					<p>Blacks are obsolete people. Every day that goes by, they become more and more superfluous to this society. The only thing left open to them is crime. Actually, the last time they had a real use here was during slavery. </p>
<p>If you read many of the interviews of former black slaves (Slave Narrative Collections) during the 1930&rsquo;s many of them said that they were far happier as slaves (not all of them of course) and thought that blacks weren&rsquo;t doing as well as free men as when they were slaves. </p>

					<p>&hellip;And, after all of this time, I thought San Francisco to be the epicenter of liberalism, tolerance and freedom?</p>
<p>Does San Francisco care to admit, after all of these years, that the majority of blacks might indeed be pathologically violent and not conducive to a stable social atmosphere?</p>
<p>Funny how the Chinese have come to San Francisco and thrived, as have Greeks, Italians, Irish, Jews and Hispanics&hellip;but leave it to blacks to thrive at the bottom of the barrel. </p>

					<p>The reason for the higher ratio of black inmates in San Francisco over other metropolitan areas (blacks are always higher anywhere you go) is because of the higher ratio of blacks who live in public housing.Public housing blacks are always the worst blacks that there are.They drive out people of other races, and they have a lot of babies because they have nothing else to do with all of the ample amount of free time that they have, since very few of them work.I think that Sheriff Hennessey, Pinko mayor Newsom,the board of stuporvisors, and all of the other city officials know this, but they are too afraid to say it because to do so is not politically correct.</p>

					<p>So many cab drivers are robbed by blacks in certain urban areas, the drivers oftentimes will refuse to pull over when hailed by a black. Blacks still refuse to criticize the vast amount of crime in their communities, and, most of the time, they excuse it and whine that the penalties for crimes by blacks are unfair, so obviously if black males can&rsquo;t get a cab it&rsquo;s nobody&rsquo;s fault but their own.  The driver doesn&rsquo;t want to take a chance on being robbed and killed by the tremendous number of black thugs prowling the urban streets at night.</p>
<p>To change that situation, the loony left, which includes blacks, but consists mostly of white airheads, thinks efforts should be made to root out white racism. </p>
<p>One within that group, a talking head <span class="caps">T.V. </span>journalist, remarked that he thought everyone&rsquo;s heart should go out to Obama, because here was a man who couldn&rsquo;t even flag down down a cab in Manhatten yet he has a chance to become president.  This pitiful example of humanity disguised as a journalist, is too foolish and/or dense to understand that cabs refuse to stop for blacks for very good reasons.  He called on Rush Limbaugh to lighten up on Obama, if he really wanted to do something good for the country.</p>
<p>I wonder if this same foolish journalist wants to overhaul the judicial system in San Francisco, because such a huge percentage of blacks are in jail.  I wonder if he&rsquo;s even, at any level, conscious of the fact that blacks commit more crimes than any other racial group, which accounts for their high incarceration figures?  </p>
<p>Do any of the other races have people within their ranks who are this stupid?  Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if he took a temporary job driving a taxi in an urban area to prove the other drivers wrong by picking up only black males?</p>

					<p>the funny thing is that the city of san francisco is actually thinking of ways to lure blacks back to the city.<br>
maybe an infomercial on <span class="caps">BET </span>showcasing the fine living conditions and views at the downtown jail, and the menu too, featuring &#8220;grits and jowls fridays&#8221;</p>

					<p>Liberals and environmentalists have come up with a fine solution. With zoning and regulations, they drive housing prices so high that only rich (i.e. productive white and Asian) people can live there   &mdash;   all the while whining about rich-poor inequality, etc.  So they get to have a good quality of life, and also feel morally superior at the same time.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t forget all the costs associated with actually putting these thugs through the court system, the probation/parole system, etc.</p>
<p>Does anyone know of a source for statistics of the real total costs for the system to support these criminals, from start to finish (per conviction)?</p>

					<p>The fact is, when then-Mayor Dianne Feinstein declared San Francisco to be the nation&rsquo;s first ever sanctuary city, Central Americans, Mexicans and Red Chinese (filipinos, south pacific islanders,etc.) poured in (along with many other 3rd worlders).  Blacks who had long been in the SF Bay Area area   &mdash;   2-3 generations   &mdash;   were forced out of unskilled and semi-skilled jobs that paid them enough to live and enjoy some benefits.  Stories were written in SF Chronicle/SF Examiner a decade+ ago about blacks headed back to their relatives&rsquo; farms in the Southeast because they had lost all to recent &#8220;immigrants.&#8221;   Feinstein and subsequent Mayors and SF Supervisors (most recently Gavin Newsom, who is open borders all the way) have done American blacks a terrible disservice, and have created crime waves through policies that disenfranchised American families and forced many to leave their long-time homes, and fall further down the labor ladder.  Let&rsquo;s just say this isn&rsquo;t a black and white issue.</p>

<p>I blame their environment. Frisco is the pervert capital of America. As blacks living there absorb its native nitwit culture of anti-establishmentarianism, for them it comes to mean not only that they can become socially admired for violating the laws of human nature, but actual laws too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the inevitable &#8220;go berserk by the bay&#8221; syndrome.</p>

<p>Actually San Fran has its remnant sixties freaks and assorted Castro District types (I&rsquo;m talking <span class="caps">LGTG </span>here)but has become pretty much an Asian city with more than 33% of the population Asian.  According to Wikipedia 39% are foreign born. It is very expensive to live there.<br>

					<p>Crime is the most obvious sign of social failure. Criminality represents pathology, people who are unable or unwilling to function or prosper in the normal rules and conditions of society. The very high rates of crime (especially violent crime) among blacks is the clearest sign of the fact that blacks are a pathological failed race. These high crime rates hold true all over the world, including places where there was never any slavery, Jim Crow etc. Look at Canada or Britain for instance.</p>
