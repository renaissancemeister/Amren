						<p>An afternoon march for immigration reform in Santa Ana drew roughly 200 participants Thursday. The group marched for an hour along a circular route through the city&rsquo;s downtown.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some blamed the small turnout on waning support and publicity from Spanish-language television and radio. Others attributed the decline to disappointment over the last two years&rsquo; protests, which they said resulted in no policy changes.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re disillusioned because we&rsquo;re not asking for much, but we still haven&rsquo;t heard an answer,&#8221; said Juana Ochoa, 38, who didn&rsquo;t hear about the march until a friend told her Thursday morning. Later that afternoon, she picked up her two sons from school and brought them to the demonstration. As she marched, she beckoned spectators inside office buildings and apartments to join in. Some of the marchers said their friends and families weren&rsquo;t willing to leave work to protest in a time of economic hardship.</p>

			<p>Instead of marching in a circle, make a straight line back across the border. </p>

			<p>  See what happens when ICE and other law enforcement people at least make an attempt to enforce our laws? Thank God, it is about time we started making them take their illegal butts back across the border. Now, let&rsquo;s REALLY make an effort to get them out. You want to come here, do it legally. </p>

			<p>Ah my friends! look at how they dance!</p>
<p>Dance around the real reason that is.</p>
<p>They will never accept that Americans simply do NOT support their illegal parasitic ways. They failed because their silly quest will never succeed.</p>

<p>The only thing more pathetic than this is, if an anti-immigration rally had been held even LESS people would have shown up!</p>

			<p>I give them at least enough credit to realize that they know that by drawing attention to themselves, they tremendously hurt their own cause 2 years ago.</p>
<p>So they are staying home.</p>
<p>But as soon as they have the numbers on their side, make no mistake they&rsquo;ll be flying their foreign flags in our faces.</p>

			<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re disillusioned because we&rsquo;re not asking for much, but we still haven&rsquo;t heard an answer.&#8221; Then open your ears. The American people have sent strong message after strong message that we don&rsquo;t want you and yours here. GET IT.</p>

			<p>According to news reports, 15,000 marched in Chicago. One of the signs clearly visible in the news photo read, &#8220;Our money is legal even if we are not.&#8221; So basically you have a large number of people admitting that they are lawbreakers (criminals) and nothing is being done about it. Only in a sick society.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re disillusioned because we&rsquo;re not asking for much,just the southwestern states, billions of your tax dollars, all your cities, preffered status in hiring, nation-wide bilingualism,&hellip;..</p>

			<p>This is not necessarily a good thing as the ORGANIZERS wised up and figured out that the sight of tens of thousands of illegals rampaging through the streets of America naturally engendered animosity towards them from Americans. Even people who weren&rsquo;t paying much attention to their presence before, suddenly awakened. </p>
<p>They&rsquo;re numbers are still increasing both by birthrate and migration, so they are content to simply bide their time, allowing selective mouthpieces to lobby on their behalf.</p>
<p>Make no mistake, they&rsquo;ve made their plans for a future America and see little in their way to hinder them&hellip;</p>

			<p>Folks, these people are going to receive amnesty. The method the present administration is using, will also be the same the next administration uses, to wit, to just keep prolonging the fence, deportations,scattered raids of illegal immigrants done in the most coarse way to elicit sympathy, until the American public can no longer stand the tension and doesn&rsquo;t care any longer. Let&rsquo;s face it,when it comes to patience,and persistence, in enforcing immmigration laws, most of the citizenry doesn&rsquo;t have any. Look how serious some states are, when blog after blog warns their citizens about what illegal immigration has done to California, Arizona, Texas, etc.,financially.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d think most citizens would be screaming by now. Nope, instead they vote in illegal alien enablers in Washington, California,(Boxer, Feinstein) Nevada,(Harry Reid) Arizona,(Napolitano)Utah(Chris Cannon),Texas(Perry, Hutchinson,etc)over and over. I&rsquo;ve just mentioned the Western States, there are  some real illegal immigration enthusiasts in the Eastern States. People talk of stopping illegal immigration through attrition. That is the strategy the administration is using to create an amnesty  &mdash;  the attrition of anyone and everyone who cares, by their prolonged unwillingness to take any real action to stop it.</p>

			<p>I think they&rsquo;re beyond street protests now.  They have sufficient numbers to just sit back, reproduce, and let mathematical certainty do the rest.  Demographically they constitute a &#8220;boom,&#8221; and when they become a majority, we will be voted into extinction.</p>

<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t think it is a lack of understanding.I believe they know how we the American people feel about them. These invaders just don&rsquo;t care what the American people think. They&rsquo;re just waiting it out until they outnumber us.</p>

			<p>The aztlan invaders are going to be a double whammy.  Not only will they achieve a de facto or de jure separation of the southwest US, but they will start to complain that they were &#8220;imported&#8221; to work for slave wages, that they were used and abused, and that they are owed &#8220;reparations.&#8221;  In short, they will make the same claims as our black population, and we have two &#8220;problem populations&#8221; instead of one.   Our country could have sort of limped along indefinately dealing with the problems of blacks, but coupled with the new invaders, I think we are going to experience a perfect storm of a huge, hostile non-native population and a bad economy, and things in the US are going to change for the worse very quickly.  I think once the wheels fall off, the changes will come rapidly.  It will sort of be like the Titanic.  A lot of little problems developed over weeks and hours, and when all these little problems came to a head, the ship sank VERY quickly.  The problems we will face will be a bunch of small things on a number of different fronts that will combine to foment revolution.  I don&rsquo;t any of the three presidential candidates will be prepared to deal with it.  </p>

			<p>All of the 3 remaining presidential candidates continue to favor amnesty for all the illegals, plus increased legal immigration. In the future they won&rsquo;t have to worry about illegals when it will be so easy to get here legally. If congress does not approve an amnesty program, they will continue to not enforce the laws so that we will get more and more Mexicans and Mestizos flooding in. In the more distant future we will have to cave in because by then they will vastly outnumber anyone else. Then either 1) the gradual cessation of the Southwest will begin, or 2) they will turn the US into a larger version of Brazil with a huge underclass, a ruling elite, and excessive violence with a lower standard of living. The whites by then will shrink into a small minority and eventually will become a target for the seething brown masses.</p>

			<p>How can anyone respect the law when they see illegal people marching down the street with the blessing of the government? So they support segments of the economy? Maybe Al Capone should have made the same defense.</p>

			<p>The &#8220;May Day&#8221; protests backfired. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the real reason why the numbers have dwindled. </p>
<p>Trust me, if they had had the desired effect, we would of seen a lot more people in the streets. </p>
<p>George Soros, The Ford Foundation, La Raza, the Council on Foreign Relations, Wall Street, and the mainstream media would of made SURE of it. </p>

			<p>You know what would be a great way to counter-protest these criminal-advocate clowns?</p>
<p>Laugh at them. </p>
<p>No, seriously. Laugh. Get all the people you can to counter-protest and laugh like they&rsquo;re watching the Marx Brothers and the Three Stooges in a pie fight. It may come hard at first but laughing is contagious once started.</p>
<p>Point at their stupid signs. Display banners with nasty caricatures of pro-illegal protesters. Repeat their chants in a Speedy Gonzales voice. Laugh and mock and mock and laugh until they start slinking back to the hideyholes they crawled out of to protest for their &#8216;rights.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Dear Lord how satisfying that would be!!!</p>

			<p>We may be well beyond the tipping point. Never mind all the illegal reconquistatores&hellip; what about the 10x more numerous _legal_ ones??  As one of the posters above said, at this point demography (the magic of compounding interest, I mean compounding birthrates) point to an easily-predictable ending to this movie.</p>
