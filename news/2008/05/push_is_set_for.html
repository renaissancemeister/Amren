<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Massachusetts civic leaders and business executives are preparing a major push to improve the diversity of the state&rsquo;s workforce by keeping closer track of the numbers of minority and female employees.</p>
<p>The new push comes less than a year after a detailed survey showed that the state&rsquo;s largest businesses and nonprofit institutions are led almost exclusively by white men.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Seventy-six institutions, from Wal-Mart to Bunker Hill Community College, have already signed on to the program &mdash; called the Commonwealth Compact &mdash; in advance of a public appeal set for Friday, when Governor Deval Patrick and Mayor Thomas M. Menino will back the effort. By joining the program, employers will be asked to make several commitments that will give the public some new insights into the diversity of the private workforce, organizers said.</p>
<p>Employers will agree to supply demographic data on their workforce, executive team, and applicant pool to a central database and commit to taking steps to improve their diversity. The Commonwealth Compact will, in turn, report to the public on the diversity of the state&rsquo;s workforce, categorized by the type of business or institution.</p>
<p>The public reports will not include details on each company&rsquo;s workforce, which one diversity specialist said weakened the initiative&rsquo;s potential impact. But Martin said the program is focused on &#8220;collective accountability,&#8221; and won&rsquo;t point the finger at individual employers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A study released in May 2007 by UMass-Boston showed that 94 percent of the board members of the state&rsquo;s largest corporations were white and about 87 percent of them were men. An earlier survey by the McCormack Graduate School found that a majority of respondents, including 75 percent of blacks and 67 percent of Latinos, believed race relations in the state were only fair or poor.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Eric Peterson, manager of diversity and inclusion initiatives for the Society of Human Resource Management, said he is not aware of any other states where companies have participated in similar projects. He said it could work, as long as institutions pay attention to more than just numbers of minority and female workers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Marc Bendick, a workforce diversity consultant based in Washington, D.C., said the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission already requires companies with more than 100 employees to report information on workforce diversity and those data are reported publicly in aggregate terms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Discrimination reported that way is a villainy without a villain,&#8221; Bendick said. &#8220;You cannot identify where the problem is. Until you put pressure on companies through shame or possible litigation to change their behavior, you&rsquo;re not really going to accomplish anything that&rsquo;s different from what&rsquo;s long prevailed under EEOC reporting requirements.&#8221;</p>

					<p>There is no such thing as &#8216;business as usual&rsquo; anymore. If a business is running too smoothly with competent workers, there must be something wrong. More anything-but-whites needed. What would actually get done at work if we didn&rsquo;t have these petty, unnecessary distractions to conted with?</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t people already walk around concerned about doing right - by way of minorities? Hell, even half the people on AmRen insist they are for what&rsquo;s best for blacks.</p>

					<p>80% of the employees at the <span class="caps">EEOC </span>are black. But that kinds of lack of diversity isn&rsquo;t a problem to liberals.</p>
<p>Now why do you think it is that small business is the engine of growth, innovation, and new jobs in America?</p>
<p>Small businesses under 100 employees don&rsquo;t have to hire minorities. After that, you are expected to carry around a bunch of dead weight - or worse incompetent employees - on the payroll.</p>

					<p>And so we see the truth: we were told anti-discrimination laws were all about, well, fighting discrimination. What they&rsquo;re <i>really about</i> is seizing property and eliminating freedom of speech.</p>
<p>There is nothing in the Constitution - no, not anywhere - that says anything about a right against discrimination by a private party. But the Consititution is supposed to protect our right to free speech and peacable assembly and from unjust/uncompensated seizure of property.</p>
<p>The Constitution has been turned on its head.</p>

					<p>In another article today we learned that Gov. Patterson pushed for a nonsensical law about displaying nooses, because he firmly believes his primary purpose as a black in a lead position is to p[ush for all things favorable only to blacks.</p>
<p>In this article we learned that another black Governor did the same for another state.  Is there anybody out there besides a black or a rabid, mentally-challenged leftist that doesn&rsquo;t believe blacks are concerned only for blacks, and that they hold allegiance to no one or no country but their own race wherever they might be?</p>

					<p>Looks like Massachusetts will have a job opening in the Senate in approximately one year.  The one that wholeheartedly, and practically single-handedly, brought about the destruction of this countries white majority, will finally be stepping aside so that a beloved minority can take his place.</p>

					<p>Could they please start with Kerry and Kennedy? &#8220;Unless you put pressure on companies through shame or litigation&#8221;? This just goes to show you that you don&rsquo;t really own anything in this country. Start up and manage a successful business and they will &#8220;shame and litigate&#8221; you to change what works, and force you to hire individuals that are not as qualified. Don&rsquo;t pay taxes on your company to fund a government that would destroy you and they take it all away. Don&rsquo;t conform and they will turn a blind eye as your competitor uses illegal aliens to crush you unfairly. I wonder why they are the States&rsquo; largest businesses? Could it be that they have the most qualified people running them? Of course, the report will be public, but it is all about &#8220;collective accountability&#8221;, no fingerpointing. Al and Jesse wouldn&rsquo;t point fingers, would they? Won&rsquo;t matter to Wal-Mart, though. They buy that Chinese junk so cheap that a little bungling at the top won&rsquo;t hurt profits that much.</p>

					<p>What a joke. These people operate on the premise that the whites occupying those positions somehow did nothing to deserve them. How do they know that those people didn&rsquo;t go to school, work hard and play by the rules to get their jobs? They seem to think there is some club somewhere that white people attend and are given their job simply for being white.</p>

<p>Hey, who cares if Obama is a racist?  Let&rsquo;s just put our cards on the table.  Everyone is for their own race and knows who they are, except for a high number of whites who practice a sort of reverse racism.  It is time to defuse the word, so let&rsquo;s not use it as the left does, enforcing its power.  Racism is good!  It helps you know who and what you are, and it helps you to survive.  Silly soft whites let the whinning get to them and have been giving away the work of white Western civilization for some time now, but everyone else is not letting up and is for their own race/people.</p>

<p>Although Kennedy is no friend to Whites, remember that he was the Front Man for the <span class="caps">USA</span>-destroying 1965 non-White immigrant flood bill.</p>
<p>https://www.vdare.com/macdonald/040619_1924_immigration.htm</p>
<p>https://www.vdare.com/macdonald/041027_immigration.htm</p>
<p>I have found no explanation better than that of Kevin McDonald (who the <span class="caps">SPLC </span>is currently trying to destroy). </p>
<p>His two articles linked above are required reading  &mdash;  I wonder if historians of the late great <span class="caps">USA </span>will use those articles in the future to explain what brought about our destruction. </p>
<p>Kennedy is a footnote in the whole sorry affair.</p>

<p>They do, indeed, my friend.  We have had them posting on here who have said as much.</p>
<p>What blacks are trying to do right now, and have been doing for about 40 years, is to intimidate whitey into giving up positions and transferring wealth to them, because they haven&rsquo;t been able to make any progress on their own, because of inability and lack of intelligence.  </p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t thwart their arrogance at all, because they believe all they have to do is occupy the position and they&rsquo;re home free, jus lak whitey been doing all these years.</p>
<p>They really believe that.<br>

					<p>Like his brothers, Teddy Kennedy will be carried out of political office in a coffin, instead of resigning now, with his age and malignant brain tumor. Only this time, we will have alternative choices and options to having to watch yet another funeral for a Dead Kennedy, presented by the broadcast networks. I for one, will be watching a cable station, as they wheel Ted Kennedy&rsquo;s funeral wagon through the streets of Washington <span class="caps">D.C.</span></p>

					<p>     Well, there&rsquo;ll be one less soon. It looks as<br>
if &#8220;Ted&#8221; will soon be appearing before the Heavenly<br><br>
Tribunal. I hope he has a good lawyer. He&rsquo;ll need<br><br>
one. No one single man has hurt America more than<br><br>
Ted Kennedy. In Irish, Kennedy means big head. But<br><br>
in Ted&rsquo;s case, there wasn&rsquo;t anything good to fill<br><br>
up that big head, just alot of vicious PC verbiage.<br><br>
Most of the space was probably just a resonant or<br><br>
wind chamber to increase the volume on the sound and<br><br>
the fury.</p>

					<p>The Soviet Union didn&rsquo;t die-it was transplanted over here while Boobus Americanus was busy watching ballgames. What the poor Russians had to suffer for 75 years under the Bolsheviks/Marxists will seem tame compared to what&rsquo;s in store for us when our elites drag another 50-100 million non-Whites in here and permit them to prey upon us with impunity. </p>
