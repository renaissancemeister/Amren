						<p>Is Oklahoma a haven for hate? Has the highly publicized movement to control illegal immigration spawned a climate that welcomes, even coddles extremist groups, providing opportunities to push their agendas?</p>
<p>Oklahoma long has been a &#8220;hotspot&#8221; for extremist activism, according to a national watchdog, and the latest data on the rise of such groups throughout the U.S. and in Oklahoma continue to be worrisome.</p>
<p><a href="/news/2007/06/report_says_kkk.html#splc" target="splc_does_not_check_for_accuracy">The Southern Poverty Law Center,</a> which tracks trends in hate movements, has found that the number of documented hate groups operating in the U.S. has grown 48 percent since 2000, up to 888 last year.</p>
<p>The increase is attributed to illegal immigration issues and is most notable in three border states: California, Arizona and Texas.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, the 888 total for the most part does not include an estimated 300 anti-immigration groups classified by SPLC as &#8220;nativist extremist,&#8221; formed in the last three years to harass and intimidate immigrants.</p>
<p>Oklahoma has seen a rise, too, from only five so-called hate groups in 2000 to 13 last year. That figure is down slightly from the 14 counted in Oklahoma in 2005, and the 16 detected in 2006.</p>
<p>Mark Potok, a Tulsa native who is director of the SPLC Intelligence Project, said the center attempts to ensure the hate groups it documents are true organizations, even if small. &#8220;We make an effort not to list a man, his dog and his computer,&#8221; said <a href="/news/2007/06/report_says_kkk.html#splc" target="splc_does_not_check_for_accuracy">Potok.</a></p>
<p>Extremist groups documented as active in Oklahoma in 2007 included;</p>
<p>    * Six Ku Klux Klan groups .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>    * Four neo-Nazi groups .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>    * The League of the South, a neo-Confederate, neo-secessionist group based in Bixby;</p>
<p>    * An Eastern Oklahoma multi-media outlet that provides, among other offerings, Christian Identity literature;</p>
<p>    * The European-American Unity and Rights Organization.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;In particular, they have played a really vile role in the immigration debate. A lot of the false, defamatory propaganda we hear in this debate first originated in hate groups,&#8221; [Potok] said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Illegal immigration,&#8221; Potok added, &#8220;has become almost the sole focus of these groups &mdash; you don&rsquo;t hear them talking about gays or blacks any more. It&rsquo;s all brown people.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hate groups also were the source of the myth about the alleged secret plan to merge the U.S., Canada and Mexico, as well as other wild and false assertions: that a third of all U.S. prison cells are filled by illegal aliens; that illegals murder 12 Americans a day.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One of the many ironic and false messages fueled by hate groups is that Latinos are more crime-prone than Americans, noted Potok. FBI statistics gathered from the states show hate crimes against Latinos rose 35 percent from 2003 to 2006. California, which has one of the most efficient reporting systems, put the rise at 54 percent during that time frame.</p>
<p>&#8220;Studies show that immigrants are substantially less criminal than Americans; they become more criminal over three generations,&#8221; said Potok. &#8220;In other words, the more American you become, the more criminal you become.&#8221;<br/>

			<p><i>&ldquo;We make an effort not to list a man, his dog and his computer,&rdquo; said Potok.</i></p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re almost doing just that, in order to arrive at a conclusion of an increasing number of hate groups.</p>
<p><i>One of the many ironic and false messages fueled by hate groups is that Latinos are more crime-prone than Americans, noted Potok.

<p>Probably at the hands of black suspects.  Ironically, a Latino who commits a hate crime will be counted as a white perp on the books.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Studies show that immigrants are substantially less criminal than Americans; they become more criminal over three generations,&rdquo; said Potok. &ldquo;In other words, the more American you become, the more criminal you become.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>He&rsquo;s right about that.  The newly-arrived illegals tend to be on good behavior, in order not to draw attention to themselves.  The succeeding generation of anchor baby citizens are more likely to gang up.</p>

<p><i>Oklahoma long has been a &ldquo;hotspot&rdquo; for extremist activism</i></p>
<p>The SPLC said last year that Vermont was a hotbed of right-wing extremism, citing multiple chapters of that white-sheet group in the state.  (A claim that the left-wing Vermont MSM picked apart easily).  I suppose anywhere where this any left-winger that could rub two nickels together, put them in an envelope and mail them to Morris Moneybags is going to be a hotbed of right-wing extremism.  Next we&rsquo;ll hear that that Berkeley, California is the new center of right-wing extremism.</p>
<p>Vermont.  Sheesh.</p>

			<p>The SPLC are professional witch hunters who make a nice living sniffing out &#8220;racism&#8221; and &#8220;anti-semitism.&#8221; It&rsquo;s rather amusing, in a cynical way, to note that there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a year in which they <i> didn&rsquo;t </i> find an increase in hate.</p>

<p>Deceitful word games.  He conflates &#8220;legal&#8221; and &#8220;illegal&#8221; immigrants, and his references to &#8220;Americans&#8221; is a reference to second and third generation immigrants.<p>Outrageous that this charlatan tries to equate being American with being criminal.</p></p></p>

<p>Well, where&rsquo;s the data proving any of this is wrong?  I mean every one of the above has been revealed on mainline internet sites that are in no way extreme.</p>
<p>The bottom line, of course, is that this pitiful Mark Potok does indeed call even a man and his computer a hate group.  Lou Dobbs said on more than one occassion, the SPLC is no more than a fund raising group.  Of course that&rsquo;s 100% accurate.</p>
<p>These MSM reporters are duped into running to this Marxist hate group for &#8220;expert&#8221; information, because they&rsquo;re too lazy to do their own research.</p>

			<p>I see the wealthy Marxists are at it again.  They&rsquo;ve been shaking the bushes trying to find hate and failing that, they now invented a few.  Now they&rsquo;ll look for ways to prosper from it.  </p>
<p>Race hustlers aren&rsquo;t just black and brown. A clue is that the SPLC&rsquo;s Mo Dees is personally very wealthy making big bucks off corporations and frightened legislators by yelling &#8220;racism&#8221; when there isn&rsquo;t any. That word &#8220;poverty&#8221; in their logo is a hoot, but man, is it ever effective.    </p>

<p>This is priceless. Notice that he said nothing about the crime rate <i>difference</i> between whites and hispanics after three generations in America. His point is like saying that we shouldn&rsquo;t be alarmed about a virus entering our country because it&rsquo;s initially benign  &mdash;  even though it can turn virulent and deadly after three generations.</p>

			<p>This may sound crazy, but in evolutionary terms I think the SPLC is basically the equivalent of a murderous cult.</p>
<p>The other day I was watching a documentary on Charles Manson and The Family. Manson and his fellow cult members had a name for the people they wanted to kill; they called them &#8220;pigs.&#8221; </p>
<p>The SPLC as we all know also have a name for the people they want to destroy: they are called white &#8220;racists.&#8221; </p>
<p>They may pretend to be concerned about black &#8220;racism&#8221; or Hispanic &#8220;racism,&#8221; but I think this is just a shield to help them accomplish their real goal of exterminating whites.</p>

			<p>How odd.  Previous immigrant groups as well as new ones not black or hispanic have done well assimilating peacefully.  Of course, these healthy groups couldn&rsquo;t or wouldn&rsquo;t dream of going on welfare, living off native people.  </p>

			<p>The Southern Poverty Law Center is a hate group.  They have been silent while hundreds of thousands of whites have been racially cleansed, robbed, stolen from, raped, and killed.  That evil group is very Bolshevistic and is a type of organization that essentially is aiding and abetting genocide against white people.  And don&rsquo;t be fooled by the fact that the SPLC have white faces.  Hitler and Stalin and Marx and Trotsky and Ted Kennedy also have white faces.  Keep fighting for your civil and human rights white man!  </p>

			<p>The SPLC is quick to label any organization against illegal immigration as racist and extremist.  They have no problem with The National Council of the Race, though.  The very mainstream Federation for American Immigration Reform has recently been labeled by the SPLC as a hate group.  The SPLC has a much longer list of people and organizations it hates than I do.  I&rsquo;m just amazed that the media continues to take them seriously.</p>
<p>The claim that illegal immigrants are less criminal than Americans is nonsense.  They break the law just by coming here.  They typically break other laws by using fake ID and not paying taxes.  And that&rsquo;s when they&rsquo;re not committing rape, assault, theft, or murder.  Also, the FBI counts Hispanics as whites when they commit the crimes, but as Hispanics when they are victims.  So of course it looks like Hispanics are saints.  Now working in Potok&rsquo;s favor is that blacks are included among native born Americans, which drives the native born crime rate way up.  Hispanics do look good compared to them.</p>

			<p>I am stunned and amazed that whites accept this vicious racism against them as normal!  After all, the major part of classically defined racism is believing that certain races have traits and certain behaviours, for good or ill.  By saying that there are only white hate groups (hate groups, another vaguely defined PC term that means whatever the prosecutor wants it to mean) the SPLC is themselves indulging in racist behaviour!</p>
<p>In any society of citizens able to critically think for themselves and apply logic, their shameless race hustling would long ago have been stripped bare as the purely ideologically and profit driven activity that it is, and Dees, Potok, Seligman et al would have been escorted to the border and warned never to return.</p>

			<p>If we ever get a handle on illegal immigration, and elect someone who puts us before them, I suggest we start filling buses with the members of the SPLC, La Raza, Hispanic politicians who are instrumental in aiding and abetting, the Los Angeles City Council, heads of sanctuary cities and anyone who is a traitor to this country by believing our laws should not be enforced against the criminals who are occupying this country.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The Southern Poverty Law Center which tracks trends in hate movements, has found that the number of documented hate groups operating in the U.S. has grown 48 percent since 2000, up to 888 last year&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>AND the number of ILLEGAL ALIENS operating in the U.S. has grown by the millions since 2000!!  </p>
<p>The SPLC should be SHUT DOWN for the Anti-White, Anti-American HATE Group that it is!</p>

			<p>I cannot for the life of me understand why Morris Dees and his despicable white-hating fellow communists henchmen at the SPLC are still in business.  These traitors clearly qualify as &#8220;domestic traitors to our Constitution&#8221; as referenced in the Oath of Office administered to every politician and member of the armed services.  Hence, the SPLC and its affiliates are fair game boys&hellip;</p>

			<p>&#8220;One of the many ironic and false messages fueled by hate groups is that Latinos are more crime-prone than Americans, noted Potok.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then why is my hometown paper&rsquo;s police report filled with latinos and blacks being arrested, especially for drug trafficking?</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you something interesting to watch out for regarding the idea of what I believe is not simply unlikely but an absolutely inevitable eventuality that being a political dissident will become at some point literally criminal, is property seizure.  Your seeing a trend right now with our Federal Government and our State and Local Governments to &#8220;progressively&#8221; make property seizure easier and easier and for non drug related offenses.  Thats right folks.  Carrying a large amount of cash and not havng any &#8220;proof&#8221;, pay stubs or bank statements on your person, can result in that cash being seized and never returned to you. If the drug dog scratches and barks at you or your luggage or your car without any drugs whatsoever being found at all and no history of any drug related offenses you could still lose your csr or whatever property is on your person. Do some research and see for yourself as well.  You know of course that a large number of elements in government and law enforcement want to make property seizure even easier.  The land of liberty ain&rsquo;t quite as free as it used to be is it folks. </p>

			<p>&#8220;&ldquo;Studies show that immigrants are substantially less criminal than Americans; they become more criminal over three generations,&rdquo; said Potok. &ldquo;In other words, the more American you become, the more criminal you become.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s right about that. The newly-arrived illegals tend to be on good behavior, in order not to draw attention to themselves. The succeeding generation of anchor baby citizens are more likely to gang up.&#8221;&#8220;</p>
<p>- A couple of comments&hellip;</p>
<p>Looking over several generations (which led to the liberal conclusion of getting worse due to &#8220;Americanization&#8221;) may not be an accurate way to examine the issue (not that facts ever stand in the way of a good liberal yarn&hellip;). Immigrants in the first wave after the 60&rsquo;s immigration reform tended to be above average compared to the buddies back home- more intelligent, harder working, etc- which is how they had the ways and means of coming here and making it. Not surprisingly, the top category of ANY population in these traits will be less crime-prone. This gave the commonplace idea that ALL the individuals of that given minority group were more intelligent, hardworking, free from crime, etc- because those were typically the only individuals of a given type that the typical American ever had met. Of course, the liberals have been more than happy to perpetuate this myth. Increasingly, though, we are getting immigrants who are closer to the average for their country. 1- its easier to get along here now- others of their communities are in all major cities, they don&rsquo;t have to be fluent in English, they don&rsquo;t have to be enterprising enough to establish a business of their own, etc. 2- Anchor baby phenomenon gives free passes 3- Visa Lotteries giving free passes to random immigrants was established 4- Even if the parents are well above average for their country/race, the offspring are going to be more likely to show regression towards the average in a given trait for their group. 5- Later generations (offspring) will not have lived in their parent&rsquo;s homeland to ever know how good they have it here compared to the societies their own kind has made, so won&rsquo;t feel the compulsion to avoid being sent away. 6- Later generations (offspring) who are born here are considered to be Americans, so don&rsquo;t run the risk of deportation if they screw up. </p>
<p>Thus, while the first generation immigrant may have shown exceptional tendencies, these factors give us a second or third generation immigrant who does not, and who in all likelihood will therefore be more crime prone.<br/>

			<p>I wonder, out loud, how the SPLC is able to get away with such blatent smearing, hypocrisy and lying&hellip;.and frankly why anyone listens to them anymore. I wish a counter organization would slap them with numerous libel and other lawsuits the same way they try to stifle expression with the threat of a  lawsuit (often a small muncipality must capitulate the the ACLU/SPLC because of the threat of legal fees. </p>

			<p>SPLC is one of the most extreme hate groups you can find.  They hate every group not believing in the SPLC doctrines.</p>
<p>Who cares what they think or what they do?  their rich donors who actually do hate America and want to see it destroyed.  That&rsquo;s who.</p>

<p>What a liar he is.  The SPLC makes me cringe.  They are anti-American, anti-White and the true hate-mongers in our society. The ADL amd SPLC represent civilization&rsquo;s worst aspects.</p>
