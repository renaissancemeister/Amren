<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>When her neighbor&rsquo;s roosters and chickens persisted in running through her yard, G. Stone took matters into her own hands.</p>
<p>She marched next door and issued a warning: Do something about the uninvited guests or the birds &#8220;were going in my pot.&#8221;</p>
<p>The incursions stopped. But Stone, a retired Los Angeles County librarian who lives northwest of Watts, shook her head in exasperation as she recalled the incident.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve lived here for 50 years,&#8221; she said. &#8220;All of a sudden, there&rsquo;s an influx of chickens. You&rsquo;re not supposed to have chickens in the city.&#8221;</p>
<p>For many, the image of South Los Angeles is that of a paved, parched, densely packed urban grid. But increasingly, it is also a place where untold numbers of barnyard animals &mdash; chickens, roosters, goats, geese, ducks, pigs and even the odd pony &mdash; are being tended in tiny backyard spaces.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most people don&rsquo;t realize just how many farm animals there are in the city,&#8221; said Ed Boks, the general manager of the city&rsquo;s Animal Services department.</p>
<p>Indeed, about a block from the beauty parlor where Stone was getting her hair done earlier this month, a pair of goats chewed something dark and unidentifiable as they stood placidly near the traffic whizzing by on Avalon Boulevard. A pit bull next door eyed them lazily.</p>
<p>The cacophony of cock-a-doodle-doos south of the 10 Freeway is one of the louder manifestations of a demographic change that has transformed South Los Angeles in the last few decades.</p>
<p>Once primarily an African American community &mdash; and still the cultural and political heart of the state&rsquo;s African American population &mdash; the area has absorbed tens of thousands of immigrants from Mexico and Central America and is now predominantly Latino. In Southeast L.A., the black population has dropped from 71% in 1980 to 24% in the 2000 census; the Latino population grew from 27% in 1980 to 74% in 2000.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But a few blocks away, Jose Luiz, 43, seemed surprised that anyone would be bothered by the noise.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s natural to have roosters,&#8221; he said as he surveyed a new community garden where corn, squash and tomatoes were growing. &#8220;I&rsquo;m Mexican. We are accustomed to hearing them.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In South Los Angeles, on the other hand, the crowing &mdash; and bleating, quacking, honking, oinking and neighing &mdash; has been a growing source of irritation, with callers lighting up city phone lines demanding that officials do something.</p>

			<p>Many municipalities already ban the keeping of roosters, just because of the noise, but this is nothing a few minutes&rsquo; work with an air rifle wouldn&rsquo;t fix.</p>
<p>This is unhealthy, as well as a noise nuisance.  The same flies that land on farm animal waste will also land on your dinner when you are eating oustide during the warmer months.</p>

<p>One must love the quote &ldquo;It&rsquo;s natural to have roosters.&rdquo;  Did anyone mention the this Darwinian that malaria, TB, and cancer are also &#8220;natural?&#8221;</p>

			<p>This is getting more and more common in my neighborhood. As more and more Hispanics move in the barnyard animals moved in too. We are only a township so stuff like that is technically legal here so there is nothing that can be done about it. As long as they keep the animals quiet and out of my yard I do not care. As far as the dude who said that he was &#8220;Mexican&#8221; he needs to go back there and take his barnyard with him. </p>

			<p>This must have caused astonishment among &#8220;Liberal&#8221; elites: Millions of Mexicans who crossed the American border did not become model members of the &#8220;proposition nation&#8221; but brought their culture and customs with them in order to peddle them here. How could the &#8220;Liberals&#8221; possibly predict that such unlikely thing was going to happen?</p>
<p>The future? The Mexican &#8220;immigrants&#8221; will keep electing bribes-taking inept morons as soon as they have a chance to cast a vote.<br>

			<p>&#8220;In South Los Angeles, on the other hand, the crowing &mdash; and bleating, quacking, honking, oinking and neighing &mdash; has been a growing source of irritation, with callers lighting up city phone lines demanding that officials do something.&#8221;</p>
<p>Officials ARE doing something. Working night and day at turning a first world nation into a dump. I imagine that awareness of that change will slowly sink in, the white minority will leave, and the calls will stop.    </p>
<p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s natural to have roosters,&rdquo; he said as he surveyed a new community garden where corn, squash and tomatoes were growing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Mexican.&#8221;</p>
<p>And there you have it. No &#8216;living in the shadows&rsquo;, no pretense, &#8216;wherever there is a Mexican, there is Mexico&rsquo;. They are at home.   </p>

			<p>The top priorities of this country for decades were to reduce poverty, improve education, increase the number of people completing higher education, reduce crime, strengthen the family unit, and reduce divorces and out of wedlock births, to name but a few.  In short, almost everybody agreed we wanted to make the country and its citizens better, while we continued to make impressive advances in the medical field and science in general.</p>
<p>Then up step the multicults, and other flakes, oddballs and misfits, and our priorities shifted to importing crime, poverty, non-whites, illiterates, and trouble makers of every sort.  And because of it, our dreams of a Mainstreet America are gone forever.  </p>
<p>I could say we are back to square one in almost every priority we used to have, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be accurate, because it&rsquo;s worse than that.  We&rsquo;re further behind than when we began years ago, especially with crime and education.  Our prisons are full of non-whites, and our kids have been dumbed down shamelessly in order to allow blacks and mestizos to catch up, but they haven&rsquo;t and they won&rsquo;t, and the entire process has us slipping from the top tier, globally, in every field, to well down in the rankings, closer to the bottom than the top.</p>
<p>The above article tells us only part of the story.  Increasing our population of people who believe sacrificing, harming, and torturing defenseless animals is normal, and <br>
turning our neighborhoods into barnyards, is only one small part of our degeneration.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s said when a person reaches the bottom the only way he can go is up or out. With countries, though, I think a third possibility is viable.  That would be, not up or out, but &#8220;apart,&#8221; as in an explosive split.  </p>

			<p>get this:<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lived here for 50 years,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;All of a sudden, there&rsquo;s an influx of chickens. You&rsquo;re not supposed to have chickens in the city.&rdquo;  Well, well&hellip; how does it feel?  You are not supposed to have crack head in the city either, but cops are told to stay away from them.</p>
<p>Why aren&rsquo;t black leaders crying foul? Oh, I forgot, they need the &#8220;browns&#8221; to assist in squashing the white.</p>
<p>One thing though, I think these Mexicans have the right idea in having their own chickens and gardens. At least they don&rsquo;t have to pay the people they don&rsquo;t like for their food.  </p>
<p>Question is, which would you prefer, Mexicans with their farms or blacks with their ghetto attitudes?</p>

			<p>Mexicans are comfortable with a standard of living that most Whites would call squalor.  To them, our public health standards are unreasonable, obsessive-compulsive behavior, and they see no reason to comply.  They have a high tolerance for sloth, lawlessness, and ignorance, and will drag any neighborhood down to their level.</p>

			<p>I guess that the restricton on barnyard animals in the city was one item not mentioned in those &#8220;comic books&#8221; which the Mexican government oh-so-helpfully gave out to would-be border crossers.  If they really wanted to get rid of their lower-class people so badly, they ought to have given them a few more pointers on how to get along ip here in <i>El Norte</i>. </p>

			<p>I live in Mexifornia, and the arrogance of the Mexican quoted in the article is typical.  If I moved to another country (which I would only do legally, in the first place,) I would try to fit in and not offend my new neighbors.  But then, I&rsquo;m white.  Mexicans couldn&rsquo;t care less what offends us gringos.  It&rsquo;s not only the chickens, it&rsquo;s the horrible loud music all night long, their kids running wild in the stores, abandoned shopping carts everywhere, trash and rusty old cars parked on front lawns, and open rudeness to Americans.  Even Mexican workers in stores are extremely rude&hellip;the checkout workers NEVER say &#8220;please&#8221; or &#8220;thank you&#8221; and the baggers shove my groceries at me without so much as a word.  The checkout person and the bagger will also jabber at each other in Spanish in front of customers.  I drive miles out of my way to a white neighborhood just so I can buy from a store with courteous, pleasant white employees.</p>
<p>I am certain that there has never been a group of &#8220;immigrants&#8221; to this country who&rsquo;ve been so rude, selfish, demanding, and arrogant.</p>

			<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Wherever there is a Mexican, there is Mexico.</p>
<p>This has got to drive the liberals crazy. Mexicans are simply too primitive to EVER really assimilate into a White culture. Nor are their American-born anchor babies much better than their illegal immigrant parents. Front yards are great for parking cars during the weekend back-yard beer party. The side yard? For getting rid of your beer when your body is done with it&hellip; who needs a toilet? That&rsquo;s a silly Anglo idea.</p>
<p>I would love to see some of our liberal posters FORCED to live next to the third-world trash from Mexico for a year. Their vaunted liberal thinking would evaporate in less than HALF that time. Chickens, cast-off furniture, piles of tires, old wrecks of cars&hellip; no telling WHAT the Mestizo down the street will keep in his yard. Sanitation? Health regulations? Just typical Anglo racism.</p>
<p>Sadly enough, it isn&rsquo;t just animals turning backyards into barnyards. Just got a call from the wife, out watering the flowers and grass in the front yard. The Mestizos nearby had a weekend party (pick your choice of occasions). The stench from their trash (Monday being a holiday, trash not picked up) is hanging over the neighborhood. (Not unlike the odor hanging over the White House from 1983 until early January, 2001.) What is it with Mexicans? Are they really THAT ignorant and stupid that they can&rsquo;t properly bag trash, spray it with disinfectant and put it in closed cans. I keep being told how nice, how beautiful Mexico is supposed to be&hellip; Then view the Mexican &#8216;trash&rsquo; on our street, paper, garbage, half eaten food remnants, beer cans and bottles, candy wrappers&hellip; you name it. I can only surmise Mexicans have a different sense of how to define beauty. The stench of urine from the wall of the party house does not help the aroma either, I might add.<br>

Quite true. And not just for Mexicans, but all over Latin America. Indeed, all over the Third World.  No doubt,  they think  we &#8220;westerners&#8221;  [is that the new PC term for whites, since race has been abolished?]   are ridiculously picky about such silly niceties as tidiness and toilets.  Sanitation is just obsessive-compulsive behavior to them.  They have no patience with such nonsense!  Just throw the garbage where you like and let it fall where it may.    </p>
<p>And to heck with health codes!  They are devices for racial oppression,  racist inventions meant to harass non-&#8220;anglos&#8221;. </p>
<p>I  still recall Bob Grant pointing out on his radio program years ago that different cultures have different standards as to what is dirt.  So true.  He was talking about roaches, I believe, which  whites tend to go crazy over, but which some cultures just take for granted as background scenery.  They can&rsquo;t see what all the fuss is about.  To them, you&rsquo;re nuts!</p>

			<p><i>If they want chickens in their yard, they should stay in mexico.</i></p>
<p>Just one question: when in the hell did it become a bad thing to keep farm animals in our yards?</p>
<p>I guess when boring suburbs became the norm.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not defending Mexicans - I&rsquo;m just defending normal life from the stale boredom of suburbia.</p>
<p>As far as I&rsquo;m concerned no American male ever grows to manhood without knowing how to kill his own chicken and clean it for dinner. Thinking chicken comes breaded in a plastic bucket from KFC does not qualify.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t understand what I&rsquo;m talking about, read Fred Reed&rsquo;s classic column, <a href="https://www.fredoneverything.net/Liddy.shtml" rel="nofollow">The Suicide of Marlboro Man.</a> Then you will.</p>

			<p>Sorry folks but why is this a story at all?  I just don&rsquo;t get it.  The Mexicans overpopulated Mexico due to their large families.  They come here looking for living space and jobs and whatever Uncle Sam will hand them at the expense of their Bolshevik buddies here.  Still they are poor and bring chickens.  Big deal.  We Americans in the meantime spend federal money on many Gov&rsquo;t programs and the DOD that is borrowed from our grand children who have no vote.  We have in essense enslaved them.  Americans will one day have chickens in many of their yards also.  </p>
