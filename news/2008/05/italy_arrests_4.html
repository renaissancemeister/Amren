<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Italian police announced on Thursday the arrest of hundreds of suspected illegal immigrants in a sign of the new right-wing government&rsquo;s determination to clamp down.</p>
<p>Police arrested 383 people including 268 foreigners, with 53 immediately taken to the border for expulsion, in a week-long operation stretching from northern Italy to the Naples area.</p>
<p>Silvio Berlusconi swept back to power for a third term as prime minister last week promising to get tough on illegal immigrants, blamed by many for crime. He is readying new laws to screen immigrants and jail or expel those breaking the law.</p>
<p>Those arrested came from Eastern Europe, Albania, Greece, North Africa and China and face charges ranging from illegal entry into Italy to prostitution, drug trafficking and robbery.</p>
<p>In Libya, police have arrested 240 would-be illegal migrants from several African countries over the past four days as they prepared to sail to Italy, the Interior Ministry said.</p>
<p>Libya is a springboard for hundreds of thousands of Africans trying to reach Europe via Italy on board unseaworthy boats.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>MIGRANT MISERY</p>
<p>Illegal Roma camps in Naples had to be evacuated by police this week after local people, angry at an alleged baby-snatching incident involving a 17-year-old Roma girl, set fire to their shacks repeatedly during the night. Nobody was injured.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Italy&rsquo;s new interior minister, Roberto Maroni from the anti-immigrant Northern League party, is rushing out emergency laws to bring back passport checks on Italy&rsquo;s EU borders, despite its membership of the Schengen passport-free zone.</p>
<p>&#8220;This operation against illegal immigrants is good because, it&rsquo;s what people want. They ask us for security and we have to give it to them,&#8221; [Umberto Bossi, League leader] told reporters in parliament.</p>

			<p>This is the way it should be everywhere. Illegals didn&rsquo;t have any help getting in the country. They shouldn&rsquo;t have any help leaving the country (after being expelled at the border). </p>

<p>Interesting point! I confess I didn&rsquo;t catch that.<br>
Yes, all whites and near-whites!</p>
<p>Probably blacks were avoided in order to escape the predictable howls of &#8220;racism&#8221;.  To the Left, they are the holiest of the holy.  (Being the most opposite of whites.)<br>

<p>Police announced the arrests of 383 people, including some 270 foreign citizens - mainly Romanians and North Africans - since May 7. They had also expelled 53 people, most of them Nigerians or Albanians, the Interior Ministry said. Most are suspected of robberies, illegal immigration, human trafficking for prostitution and drug trafficking, officials said.</p>

			<p>First of all albanians arent white, the romanians they are deporting arent ethnic romanians but Gypsys who are as dark as any Indian do a google on them, and need i say anything about moroccans also the current arrests stem from this attack on gypsy camps in naples people have had enough.</p>

<p>How refreshing!  Government officials actually responding to the will of the people on a subject which is sacrosanct to the Left  &mdash;  -unlike the rest of the Western world, the US and Canada where the voice of the people is meaningless and only what is politically correct among the elites is ever acted on.</p>

			<p>I have a theory that I am hoping I will eventually be able to prove, perhaps others will also look into this. Gaddafi recently announced that Europe will soon be Muslim and he looks forward to that day. Thousands upon thousands of African illegals cross the Mediterranean every year, they have done so for the last twenty years. Most come from Libya, a complete police state, you could not  enter that country illegally any easier than you could enter the pentagon. Nor or there any roads or any other forms of transport crossing the great Libyan desert to the southern countries from where most of the illegals come. In fact, the only thing going on in the southern desert is one of the worlds largest engineering project, designed by none other than our friends Haliburton, who conveniently registered the company doing the job in Ireland, since at the time (1983)  Libya was an out and out terrorist and<br>
Americans were forbidden to have anything to do with them. Google the great man made river project. In my experience, Arabs consider physical work below their<br>
dignity, that is for what kaffirs were created by Allah. I am sure all those thousands were working on this project, their pay was a leaky boat and one way ticket to Europe.</p>

			<p>I see that Spain&rsquo;s leftist government is all bent out of shape about this, and is scolding Italy.  How the heck is this any of Spain&rsquo;s business?</p>
<p>Anyway, it prompts me to wonder:  what if Italy (or any other country, for that matter) really starting rounding up and deporting these aliens en masse?   Would the  outraged EU  (and USA) send in planes to bomb Italian cities, doing the kind of job on them as was done to Serbia? It seems the EU is more interested in protecting the imported aliens than in protecting and preserving its own native inhabitants, does it not? You&rsquo;ve gotta wonder who is really running this show. </p>
