				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeff Heinrich, Montreal Gazette, May 17, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Learn more English, be nicer to Muslims, get better informed.</p>
<p>Those are just some of the ways the unhappy French-Canadian majority in Quebec can shake off its angst about minorities and help build a truly open society in a globalized world, say the authors of a much-anticipated report for the Liberal government on the &#8220;reasonable accommodation&#8221; of minorities.</p>
<p>In several chapters of the final draft obtained by The Gazette, Gérard Bouchard and Charles Taylor argue the &#8220;discontent of a large part of the population&#8221; over demands by Muslims, Jews and other religious minorities &#8220;seems to us the result of partial information and false perceptions.&#8221; The chairpersons of the $5-million commission address a number of what they call &#8220;unfounded objections&#8221; to the role of religion in Quebec society, mostly voiced by old-stock francophones during three months of highly publicized hearings last fall.</p>
<p>Rebutting those objections, Bouchard, a prominent Chicoutimi sociologist and historian, and Taylor, a world-renowned Montreal philosopher, lay out their vision of a new Quebec coming to terms with kirpans, hijabs, kosher food and other expressions of non-Christian cultures.</p>
<p>In Quebec, they say, everyone should feel welcome and the majority should no longer feel under threat by newcomers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think it is possible to re-concile Quebecers &mdash; franco-phones and others &mdash; with practices of harmonization, once it has been shown that: a) these practices respect our society&rsquo;s fundamental values, notably the equality of men and women.</p>
<p>b) they don&rsquo;t aim to create privileges but, rather, equality that is well understood and that respects everyone&rsquo;s rights.</p>
<p>c) they encourage integration and not marginalization.</p>
<p>d) they&rsquo;re framed by guidelines and protected against spiralling out of control.</p>
<p>e) they&rsquo;re founded on the principle of reciprocity.</p>
<p>f) they don&rsquo;t play the game of fundamentalism.</p>
<p>g) they don&rsquo;t compromise the gains of the Quiet Revolution.&#8221; The final draft is dated March 19, two weeks before the commission announced on its website that the writing of the report was finished and that, after adding a series of recommendations, proofreading the document and translating it into English, it would be sent to the printers.</p>
<p>The official report is now in the hands of Premier Jean Charest, who is to present it to cabinet on Wednesday. After a budget-style &#8220;lock-up&#8221; behind closed doors for journalists Friday morning, the commissioners will hold a news conference to discuss their findings.</p>
<p>Broken down into half-a-dozen parts, the voluminous report has more than a dozen chapters and almost as many annexes consisting of a series of research reports, independently produced under special order by the commission.</p>
<p>Their subjects relate to the accommodation debate, including media coverage, ethnic ghettos and French-language training for immigrants.</p>
<p>In their report, Bouchard and Taylor &mdash; but mainly Bouchard, who did the bulk of the writing, insiders say- argue that the responsibility for open-mindedness and desire for change lie mainly with one people: the French Canadians themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s principally from this milieu that the crisis arose,&#8221; the commissioners write, adding that many French Canadians &#8220;have a strong feeling of insecurity for the survival of their culture.&#8221; They fear losing their &#8220;values, language, tradition and customs&#8221; and of eventually &#8220;disappearing&#8221; entirely as a French-speaking minority in North America.</p>
<p>Self-doubt and &#8220;the fear of the Other&#8221; &mdash; are &#8220;the two great hindrances from the French-Canadian past,&#8221; the commissioners write.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the past, the threat came mainly from the anglophone. Before that, it was the lifestyle brought on by industrialization. Today, for many, it&rsquo;s the immigrant.&#8221; What Quebec now faces is not the traditional &#8220;deux solitudes&#8221; of French and English, but rather &#8220;deux inquiètudes&#8221; &mdash; the twin anxieties of the majority and the new minorities, the commissioners say.</p>
<p>The &#8220;members of a strong ethnocultural majority fear being submerged by minorities who themselves are fragile and worried about the future, especially immigrants trying to find their feet in their adoptive society,&#8221; write the scholars, who in footnotes liberally quote from oral testimony as well as written briefs presented at the hearings last fall.</p>
<p>Bouchard and Taylor also compare Quebec&rsquo;s immigration situation with that of other provinces, noting that Quebec has far fewer immigrants (11.5 per cent per capita, compared with 28 per cent in Ontario and British Columbia, and 16 per cent in Alberta) and far fewer ethnocultural minorities generally (21 per cent in metropolitan Montreal vs. 46 per cent in Toronto and 40 per cent in Vancouver).</p>
<p>Quebec&rsquo;s accommodation crisis dates to March 2006, when the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in favour of a Montreal Sikh teenager who wanted to keep wearing his kirpan, the traditional ceremonial dagger of baptized orthodox Sikh men, to school.</p>
<p>A series of media-fuelled controversies over demands for accommodation by religious minorities followed.</p>
<p>For example: The Association of Maritime Employers agreed to re-examine its workplace rules after orthodox Sikh truck drivers objected to wearing safety helmets instead of their turbans at the Port of Montreal.</p>
<p>A Montreal YMCA frosted the windows of an exercise room so that ultraorthodox Jewish neighbours wouldn&rsquo;t have to watch women exercising.</p>
<p>And Montreal policewomen were advised in a training brochure to let their male colleagues take charge when visiting Hasidic neighborhoods.</p>
<p>The &#8220;scandals&#8221; came to a head in January 2007 with the publication of a &#8220;code of life&#8221; by the village council of Hérouxville in the Mauricie region, in which foreigners were advised that public stonings and female circumcision were not allowed in the community.</p>
<p>Faced with the polemic over that declaration and fearing unrest over immigrants and religious minorities on the eve of a provincial election campaign, Charest quickly announced the formation of a special commission to look into accommodations and defuse the crisis: the Bouchard-Taylor commission.</p>
<p>In their report, the commissioners say that in hindsight the accommodation crisis was largely a media phenomenon &mdash; but, they add, it was no invention.</p>
<p>&#8220;The media didn&rsquo;t create the crisis over accommodations, but their message fell on fertile ground.&#8221; Elsewhere, they call on the media to show more &#8220;self-discipline&#8221; and rigour in reporting on ethnic communities and their representatives, some of whom &mdash; like deported Tunisian imam Saïd Jaziri &mdash; got wide coverage despite having little or no credibility.</p>
<p>Although &#8220;what has happened in Quebec sometimes gives the impression of being a showdown between two groups of minorities (French Canadians and the ethnic minorities), each of whom wants the other to accommodate it,&#8221; there are many ways to avoid a fatal confrontation, the commissioners say.</p>
<p>People should get used to the idea that &#8220;Quebec is made up of diverse ethnic groups, each of which, as is its right and in its own way, cultivates its own memory&#8221; &mdash; in other words, none is more valuable than the other.</p>
<p>The two commissioners &mdash; who each collected a salary of $380,000 for their work &mdash; also: Declare themselves in favour of more funding for community groups that try to bring cultures together.</p>
<p>Argue against race-based projects that segregate people from mainstream society (such as a proposed all-black school).</p>
<p>Lament the &#8220;wasted careers&#8221; of foreign professionals who can&rsquo;t find work here because their credentials aren&rsquo;t recognized.</p>
<p>Deplore that only three per cent of Quebec public-service jobs are held by immigrants, &#8220;one of the worst situations in North America.&#8221; Blame the Quebec media for being generally &#8220;very &lsquo;old-stock,&rsquo; very &lsquo;white&rsquo; (and) by consequence, they broadcast an often biased image of a (multicultural) reality that a lot of people don&rsquo;t know well enough.&#8221; But Bouchard and Taylor also &mdash; surprisingly &mdash; come to the defence of Hérouxville, which made headlines around the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a very awkward and excessive way, the Hérouxville text expressed a tension, an ambivalence many French-Canadian Quebecers have,&#8221; the commissioners write.</p>
<p>Finally, they make a plea for better understanding of Quebec&rsquo;s Muslims, &#8220;who only make up two per cent of the Quebec population, about 130,000 people,&#8221; who are &#8220;massively francophone and highly educated,&#8221; who are &#8220;among the least devoutly religious of all immigrants,&#8221; and who are &#8220;the least ghettoized&#8221; geographically in Montreal.</p>
<p>&#8220;The way to overcome Islamophobia is to get closer to Muslims, not to run away from them,&#8221; the commissioners state.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mistrust breeds mistrust. Just like fear, it winds up feeding on itself.&#8221;<br>

			<p>&#8220;Just get better informed and multi-culturalism will work just fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>The multicult governmental elites are in the process, over the entire West, of frantically trying to solve problems and make myriad adjustments to the failure of multiculturalism.  From race riots, to welfare drain, to jihadist bombings, to screams of hatred for their adopted countries, as they destroy infrastructure and torch cars, immigrants&hellip;.. first, second and more&hellip;.. are having big problems with their Western lifestyles and they are not only refusing to assimilate they&rsquo;re working dilligently to try to get their old country&rsquo;s ways, laws and religions, to replace those of their host countries.</p>
<p>The situation looks grim and it is set to get worse and worse with each passing month.</p>
<p>And, after all this, isn&rsquo;t it hilarious that these same elitists loudly declare that diversity is their strength?</p>

			<p>Quebecois are supposed to acquiesce in their own dispossession, is what this amounts to.  Given the sort of people who rule the West these days, I can&rsquo;t see why Marshal Petain and his Vichy collaborators are not held up as international heros.</p>

			<p>I can understand why the Quebeckers are concerned.  Look what happened to their cousins in New Orleans.  There&rsquo;s little French identity left there.  </p>

			<p>I have found Quebecers to be arragent, vain, and ethnocentric. That&rsquo;s why I love them! If Moslems stay away from Quebec, I plan to move there, and learn French as fast as possible. The food is great and the medicines are low cost. Viva Quebec! </p>

			<p>The impression I recieved after relocating back to Montreal from Ontario was that French-Quebecers are too tolerant of the growing population of visible minorities, but that was only my second impression. My first reaction was disgust at how this once beautifully clean city had changed for the worst. The parks and subways strewn with garbage and graffitti, and the people just didn&rsquo;t seem as friendly and trusting as they once were. Multi-culturalism has really ruined this place, and now they will blaim the French for not being, &#8220;reasonably accommodating.&#8221; Well, if there is one thing I have learned from the above article, I will have to stop debating with my friends in Toronto over who has the most visible minorities. You guys win&hellip;</p>

			<p>Okay, Friends&hellip; here&rsquo;s a challenge for you all:</p>
<p>Can ANYONE show me a White nation, even a White city or town, which ACTUALLY BENEFITTED from an influx of Blacks, Muslims and other non-Whites? In other words, an area where crime, dirt, garbage, destruction WENT DOWN, INSEAD OF UP following the arrival of non-White immigrants? Where non-White immigrants were honest, decent, clean-living, industrious people readily meshing into their adopted society, WITHOUT creating endless social problems, WITHOUT incessant demands for this, for that, for more welfare?</p>
<p>I keep hearing how &#8220;good&#8221; multi-cultural diversity is supposed to be&hellip; so PULEEZE, answer my question. Come up with a concrete, verifiable example!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m waiting&hellip;</p>

			<p>This is absolutely outragoues that the multi-culturalists are tryng to meddle with Quebec.  Really - why can&rsquo;t Quebec be left alone to enjoy their culture?  Why must it be changed?  That&rsquo;s my question to these fanatics.  And that&rsquo;s what they are - fanatics. By demanding to multi-culturalize a society it means judgement has been passed on that society that there&rsquo;s something wrong with it. Apparently to some people it&rsquo;s an immoral act to have an all white country, state, company, group or dare I say family!</p>

			<p>I am Quebecois by origin although my great grandfather was born in what became part of New York in the U.S. once the final U.S. Canadian border was settled.  Our family became American via a border that crossed us! (Ha! I find that a little amusing).  I have no problem being American (well, I have lately, since I am of a despised race and gender as a white male).  Although raised in California, I always tried to keep some French identity about me and studied French, even taking a course last year at a local community college to brush up.  I have had a secret solace in thinking that the strong Quebecois seperatist movement would enhance the probability that Quebec would resist the multicultural destruction of at least one group of white people.  I now can see that this was a vain hope.  There seems to be no Western culture, no memory that the super liberals aren&rsquo;t out to destroy.</p>
<p>They may destroy all that is Western in a short time, but what they will have left will be a miserable &#8220;Bladerunner&#8221; style population living like rodents in the once great West.</p>

			<p>As a Canadian I can&rsquo;t help but feel a touch of irony, even schadenfreude at the Quebecers plight. It was the Federal Liberal party that was WHOLLY responsible for changing the racial composition of Canada. Prior to the late 1960&rsquo;s Canada was about 98.9% White (Aboriginals comprised about 1%). It was the Liberals who changed all this and Quebec gave this party unconditional support keeping it in power in election after election. Above all Quebecois Pierre Trudeau was responsible for the violent upset in Canadian demographics. He was quoted as saying &#8220;it doesn&rsquo;t matter where the immigrants come from&#8221;. For making that one statement he showed he was unfit to be Prime Minister. Quebec single-handedly saved his bacon in the 1972 election when English-speaking Canadians utterly repudiated him. Now Quebec is reaping the grim harvest it has sown. Almost all immigrants to Canada eventually become English-speakers and this reduces the proportion of Francophones. Quebec&rsquo;s entire demographic position in Canada is being undermined by immigration. It should have opposed it vehemenently from day one. Instead it gave a blank cheque of support to the very party that embraced the policy. Do Francophones actually think Chinese in Vancouver are going to learn their langauge? Or Sikhs in Brampton are going to appreciate their culture? In 1867 Quebec had 65 of 181 seats in the House of Commons. Today 75 seats in 308. This is slated to change to 75 seats in 330. Quebec is fading away. Immigration to Canada is a key cause of this and Quebec did more then anything to support the party that has been the overwhelming cause of its own decline. Ironic indeed.</p>

			<p>&#8220;<i>Can ANYONE show me a White nation, even a White city or town, which ACTUALLY BENEFITED from an influx of Blacks, Muslims and other non-Whites? In other words, an area where crime, dirt, garbage, destruction WENT DOWN, INSTEAD OF UP following the arrival of non-White immigrants?&#8221;</i> Posted by Fed-Up</p>
<p>The once-great city of Toronto is a prime example of this deterioration. Toronto&rsquo;s White population went from 83% in 1986 to an abysmal 53% in only <b>twenty years</b>! Amazing, is it not?</p>
<p>This unprecedented and radical shift in demographics during this exceptionally short time has transformed this prime piece of Canadian real estate into a confusing &#8220;spoils system&#8221; that is up for grabs by invading armies of non-white 3rd world peoples&hellip;..and we allow this to happen because white Canadians have been disarmed by accusations of &#8220;racism&#8221; if <i>&#8220;thou dost protest too much&#8221;</i>.</p>
<p>Most Canadians are unaware that world&rsquo;s population is already inhabited by about 90% NON-white people and that they&rsquo;re &#8220;The Target&#8221; for replacement within their own country. </p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll often read about visible-minorities gleefully announcing that by 2050, the whole of Canada will resemble what Toronto looks like today. </p>

			<p>&#8220;The mainstream media needs to stop telling people what to do and just report the news&#8221;,,,, </p>
<p> That is an excellent point. The media has no interest in just giving the great unwashed the news and facts. It wants to shape public opinion and reaction to the news. The media is just another agent of propaganda for the powers that be.</p>

<p>The only non-whites capable of that are Asians. Chinese, Japanese and Koreans in general are very peaceful and clean. A part of Montreal called Chinatown where the Chinese community are is actually a very nice place with very few crimes. And it&rsquo;s clean too. ^^</p>
<p>As for blacks and muslims there are no good example in the whole white world i&rsquo;m afraid, only very bad ones.</p>
