						<p>I am a black Republican. I have a confession to make. I am an Obama &#8220;girl.&#8221; Most black Republicans who support John McCain won&rsquo;t tell you this &mdash; but if Barack Obama is the nominee for the Democratic ticket, they will go into the voting booth in November and vote for Obama.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>His friend was Sen. Barack Obama. All I knew about this light-skinned, cute boyish face-looking, kind of tall, lanky man was his great speech at the Democratic national convention and his position against the war in Iraq.</p>
<p>When we met, I identified myself as a Republican and began to discuss with him the work I did around the world on behalf of our government. I also told him I served President Bush as an appointee and had known him since 1998.</p>
<p>Obama nodded, taking it all in. He asked a few questions about my international experience. He asked me to be in touch with his office. When we finished talking, I walked away like a fan who met her favorite rock star after a concert. Giggly, I said to myself: &#8220;Yes, he is in the wrong party, but wouldn&rsquo;t that be great if he ran for president someday?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It is often very emotional for me. When he is attacked racially, I think of the times my father, grandfather and other close black men have been attacked, and I take it personally. When he first struggled through his explanation about his relationship with the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., I felt the emotion. I knew this would not be good enough for white America. He always has to balance his blackness, and this is hard. Obama, like many of us, still has to go above and beyond to prove himself.</p>
<p>Most blacks won&rsquo;t admit this to the average white person, but Obama&rsquo;s fight, we feel, is our fight. Proving his worthiness on a daily basis has become our fight to prove our worthiness.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nearly all blacks knew that when Wright went &#8220;gangsta&#8221; on Obama, the senator had to retaliate, showing us, white and brown America, that he was not soft.</p>
<p>Ironically, while many of us were quite satisfied in what Obama had to do denouncing his former pastor, we still felt the embarrassment that the attack by Wright and the Obama response was a symbolic form of black-on-black crime &mdash; something I&rsquo;m sure Wright has spoken out vehemently against during his liberation ministry.</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s run for the White House is redefining the image of the black man globally. He is changing past stereotypes that have haunted them. When I mentor young black males, I now tell them to &#8220;Baracratize.&#8221; They can do this without losing their identity. Obama&rsquo;s run might signify the end of the old-guard leadership of the Revs. Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton, who have championed the cause of blacks while making lots of money for doing so.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Obama, like many of us, still has to go above and beyond to prove himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the quintessential black delusion. They think they are going &#8216;above and beyond&rsquo; when somebody at the exact same level of competence with a white skin would be serving in some low level position in city or county government - not being a serious contender for President.A black skin puts most black people &#8216;above and beyond&rsquo; their actual capabilities, which is why they fail so miserably.<br>

			<p>Okay, time to clear the air about many black &#8220;Republicans.&#8221;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not really &#8220;Republicans.&#8221;  They are, as us right-wing political professionals call them, &#8220;line-jumpers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re a relatively young black man or woman living in a heavily black area.  And you&rsquo;re politically interested, and you want to become politically involved, and you want to become a celebrity in the field.</p>
<p>In the inner cities, almost all blacks are already Democrat.  So if you cut your teeth in the local Democrat organizations, you will have a long time to go, a lot of work to do, and a lot of dues to pay, until you get to be someone.  That&rsquo;s because the line is so long in urban Democrat organizations.</p>
<p>So you look around, and there&rsquo;s the Republican Party.  Which have almost no blacks, yet the party pandering big-wigs really wish they had some, and are spending an insane amount of resources to get them.  So if you cut your teeth among the Republicans, there&rsquo;s hardly any line, and you get to be someone a lot sooner.  All you have to do is feign a little bit of quasi-conservatism every once in awhile.</p>
<p>So, is it really much of a surprise that those who do the Republican option would then &#8220;turn around&#8221; and endorse Obama?  There&rsquo;s no &#8220;turning&#8221; and no &#8220;treason.&#8221;  They were Obamaites all along.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m sure the 60% of Clinton Democrats and Hispanics who will defect to John McCain if Obama is the candidate will more than makeup the 11% of  blacks who voted for Bush in the last election.</p>

			<p>[&#8220;Obama&rsquo;s run for the White House is redefining the image of the black man globally&#8221;]</p>
<p>&#8220;Baracratize&#8221;   &mdash;   does this mean to try and run for president on emotions of white guilt and black solidarity? What&rsquo;s the difference between this and Affirmative Action? Nothing!</p>
<p>So, I guess nothing really needs to &#8220;change&#8221; with young blacks then, does it Miss Davis? </p>
<p>Furthermore, it doesn&rsquo;t sound like the &#8220;image&#8221; of the black man is being &#8220;redefined&#8221; either. The only tool blacks have to manipulate in order to make up for their own shortcomings is White Guilt. Everybody the world over knows this. </p>

			<p>Though I have long-since abandoned any hope for the Republican party personally, this speaks volumes about just who and what makes up that political party today, and why it is the collective enemy of Whites, alsmost every bit as much as the Democrats&hellip;no matter how emphatically the talk-radio loudmouths try to convince you otherwise!! </p>

			<p>Baracratize.<br>
v. Entymology - 2008 Presidential Campaign by Barack Hussein Obama.</p>
<p>Definitions:<br>
1) To marry a mouthy, bitter woman<br>
2) To be or become dangerously unqualified<br>
3) To say or act according to what is most expedient at the time<br>
4) To invent the most outrageous lies to excuse past and current deeds<br>
5) To enjoy overwhelming popularity due to efforts of others<br>
6) To speak in empty, vague terms</p>
<p>Eg. Barack Obama baracratized the United States Presidential election.</p>

			<p>This is the point. If whites split 50-50, all blacks, regardless of any party, will vote for the Hussein, and he wins.</p>

The final sentence:</p>
<p>&#8220;Obama&rsquo;s run might signify the end of the old-guard leadership of the Revs. Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton, who have championed the cause of blacks while making lots of money for doing so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&hellip;is the only flicker of hope in an otherwise dismal and depressing (yet entirely predictable) piece of skin solidarity. That Obama might lessen the importance of Jackson and Sharpton could be the only positive white people get out of the sick spectacle that is this year&rsquo;s Presidential experiment. And even that&rsquo;s nothing more than a Maybe. </p>
<p>I called the article depressing and here&rsquo;s why: Because if even halfway-sensible black Republicans like this one feel the atavistic pull as soon as some smoov-talkin&rsquo; bruvva gets some momentum behind him, then all is truly lost for African-Americans as respect-worthy citizens and voters. </p>
<p>BTW, AmRen&rsquo;s own subtitle for the article is &#8220;Race trumps party.&#8221; Indeed. What white America is learning from The Great Obama Scare of 2008 is that race seems to trump EVERYTHING. <br>

<p>Yes, but what will &#8220;Obama&#8221; replace them with? </p>
<p>Who here has not noticed the creepy religious undertones of Obama&rsquo;s campaign propaganda? </p>
<p>If this is any indication of the type of regime that the Obama camp wants to bring in, the country and more importantly we are in big trouble. </p>
<p>An Obama presidency will turn this country into an Afrocentric theocracy.</p>
<p>Sigh&hellip;</p>
<p>What am I talking about? In many ways it already is one. </p>
<p>What else explains the vastly disproportionate influence blacks have on our political, social, cultural, and educational institutions? </p>

			<p>Which begs the question&hellip;what if Barack Obama does NOT get the nomination?</p>
<p>The same seething hate which was ready to erupt if O.J. Simpson was convicted or if Rodney King&rsquo;s arresting officers were not sent o jail, is there and is WORSE than ever. </p>
<p>There is quite open muttering of massive race riots if Barack Obama is &ldquo;denied&rdquo; the nomination.</p>
<p>If he does get the nomination and doesn&rsquo;t win, can we expect a Congolese/Haitian uprising of all the non-Whites?</p>
<p>The non-whites have gotten their way for such a long time that they can&rsquo;t be denied!<br>

			<p>Comrade Davis notes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most blacks won&rsquo;t admit this to the average white person, but Obama&rsquo;s fight, we feel, is our fight. Proving his worthiness on a daily basis has become our fight to prove our worthiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ironically, I will not pillory Comrade Davis for her insights, but instead applaud them!</p>
<p>However, those applause should be seen as coming from an implacable opponent, who recognizes some truth in her words and then applies them to his own people. In my case, this would not be: mulattos, blacks, browns, Asians or Reds, but only decent white Americans; or as I like to simply call them, Americans.</p>
<p>In many respects, the election of 2008 will only be about symbolism. Comrade McCain and the Red Queen Hillary, are not politically much different from Comrade Obama the &ldquo;Omniscient.&rdquo; We all know this in the AR community; however, most in the media do not, or at least will not admit as much. The same goes for the beguiled white fools that have in the past or will in the future, vote for  Comrade Obama the &ldquo;Omniscient.&rdquo; </p>
<p>We are now voting for a way of life that is being eroded, but should be preserved at all costs. That is the American (or white) way of life. No Brains or the Red Queen no longer represent their &ldquo;politics&rdquo; only anymore, but our race&rsquo;s suzerainty as well and unfortunately. It cannot be otherwise, and the consolation prize is that they also represent the &ldquo;Baby Boomers,&rdquo; who are hopefully going to end their misguided &ldquo;reign&rdquo; rapidly sooner, rather than later. </p>
<p>In some respects, Comrade Obama (his only positive) is sort of a harbinger of that eventuality. But, he is the multicultural incarnation of it, not the American manifestation.</p>
<p>In time, this will sort out for the better; the Boomers will be gone and only real Americans will battle the multicultural automatons that are their heirs, and the &ldquo;of color&rdquo; diversity types they had once championed. Then, Red idiocy and affirmative action will be utterly smashed, along with so-called &ldquo;tolerance&rdquo; and &ldquo;diversity.&rdquo; </p>
<p>If not, then God help us all!!!<br>

			<p>Just an example of the fact that being &#8220;Republican&#8221; means nothing (sometimes it even means Ninguna! or Nada). </p>
<p>It is really quite appalling that in the year 2008 the political debate is codified, in our de facto bi-party system, so pathetically. If there is a lesser of two evils it is very, very slight. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the American public is made up of such pathetic lemmings that a Third Party alternative seems to be a distant dream.  </p>

<p>You&rsquo;re not surprising anybody here, lady.  We know full well where your loyalties lie, and it will always be that way.</p>
<p>Race trumps everything with blacks and Hispanics.  Only whites have a &#8220;silly&#8221; element that thinks feeling morally superior is something to strive for.<br>

<p>I hate to break it to her, but many Whites could care less about Wright and Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;gangsta&#8221;-style conflict by that time. He blew it the first time around, when the initial Wright story got MSM coverage. He basically told everyone to take a hike, he was not going to denounce his pastor no matter what.</p>
<p>His rebuttal a few weeks later was exposed as pure political damage control done out of desperation, nothing more.</p>
<p>It was actually amusing to observe from afar, though. It sort of reminded me of one of those moronic East Coast vs. West Coast rapper face-offs that end in a hail of bullets over completely trivial nonsense.</p>

			<p>&#8220;He always has to balance his blackness, and this is hard. Obama, like many of us, still has to go above and beyond to prove himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>This? From a lady republican? Unless this entire thing is a lie, merely done for effect (and in either case it&rsquo;s still all a big fat lie)&hellip; if this is serious, it just proves that all blacks are insane. Obama, and other blacks, have to work twice as hard and be twice as clean in order to get half the credit?</p>

			<p>I have to seriously wonder if these people are working toward seeing a few million Americans die in a race war. That would be quite a show for the rest of the world, that indeed, these diversity guides, and Jared Taylor, are right: people prefer their own kind first. And that the more diverse a society becomes the more conflict there will be. </p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with anyone voting for Obama but this woman has to know what she is writing here is complete fantasy. Who is the intended audience for this woman and the Houston Chronicle? Perhaps the powers-that-be are confident they can keep whites from noticing what is before their very eyes ad-infinitum&hellip; Our entire society seems dedicated to the interests, and the racism, of blacks as tho whites do not exist. Black carry on, tho, as if none of this is true and as if they believe exactly the way this woman does. When will blacks open their eyes? It won&rsquo;t be after reading this&hellip; The great unifier, filtered thru the mass media, is simply unifying us all in being at opposite polar extremes.</p>

			<p>Nothing new here. Chicago media have been featuring snippets of (usually) self-proclaimed black &#8220;conservatives&#8221; announcing their support of B. Hussein Obama; it&rsquo;s usually something simple, like &#8220;I&rsquo;m conservative but I support Obama.&#8221; BHO doesn&rsquo;t advocate a single conservative position on anything, therefore the support of such people is racial, first and only.</p>

			<p>Anyone thinking about voting for Obama might better think about his bill, S2433 &#8220;The Global Poverty Act&#8221;. This bill is the opening salvo in his attempt to levy a 7% tax on Americans for a global welfare plan. He wants to reach into your pockets to throw your money down a dark hole in Africa. Yet another tax to feed millions of new parasites. It can get a lot worse before it gets better.</p>

			<p>As someone who is Traditionalist Catholic, young, Conservative and black (or, more correctly) mulatto, I have always voted Republican. </p>
<p>However, for those of my political ilk, irrespective of race or other sundry differences, reality and history have amply shown that McCain does not best represent our interests. Whether he believes in conservative principles at heart and owing to political expediency presents a liberal public face, is not for me to judge.  </p>
<p>The differences between McCain and Clinton-Obama is a matter of degree, not type. Substantively, they are the same.</p>
<p>Objectively, Ron Paul truly represents the best interests of ALL Americans, I think.  But, as he apparently stands no chance of a win, unfortunately it appears to be a moot point.</p>

			<p>How old is comrade Davis?  I ask because her writing is that of a teenaged girl, transported by contact with her favorite idol.  All this talk of emotions, and descriptions of Obama&rsquo;s face, etc.  All this is appropriate to the actions and emotions of a 14 year old in the presence of her favorite rock star, and is hardly serious political speech.  It was enough to make me feel physically ill and to cringe at the thought that such people actually exist and vote in this country</p>
<p>.  What do we learn that we did not before?  We already knew that blacks overwhelmingly voted either Democratic or on the basis of race directly, so there is no surprise that this black female &#8220;Republican&#8221; will be voting for her black ideal.  As far as Sharpton and Jesse, don&rsquo;t worry, Obama will find them a place in his administration which will look a lot more like sub-saharan Africa than America.</p>
<p>Perhaps with this blatant black racism, it will eventually become politically possible for whites to identify with their race.  This may become more likely as they are likely to be attacked with more strongly than usual by a black, Obama, administration.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;In time, this will sort out for the better; the Boomers will be gone and only real Americans will battle the multicultural automatons that are their heirs, and the &ldquo;of color&rdquo; diversity types they had once championed&rsquo; John &ldquo;God save us all&rdquo;</p>
<p>I take offense to that.  Not all of us Boomers were joining hands at Civil Rights marches singing Kumbayah, smoking pot and passing out free love.  The American people weren&rsquo;t give a voice on the big issues of the 60s; immigration, so called civil rights, etc.  It was rammed down our throats by the stroke of a White House pen.  </p>

<p>   I hope your right. Most of the college faculty remain flaming flakes all their lives. I see the college youth much in favor of Senator Obama.  </p>

			<p>I honestly don&rsquo;t understand why some blacks are Republicans.  Even the successful ones have lived off Affirmative Action, quota benefits and set asides, all fruits brought to them by the Democratic Party.  Even black Republican leaders are less than inspiring.  Colin Powell was booed at the Republican Convention for saying he supported discrimination against Whites (Affirmative Action).  Look at all the fuss they made over Condoleeza Rice when she was appointed Secretary of State.  Upon close inspection of her credentials it turns out she was little more than a glorified house black (putting it nicely.)</p>

			<p>If a large potion of blacks believe that the government invented AIDS &amp; crack cocaine &amp; blew up the Twin Towers, and that the government tried to railroad &#8220;innocent O.J.,&#8221; etc., then if/when it becomes clear that Obama will NOT be elected (either at the Democratic Convention, or after the November elections) there are going to be riots.  Blacks are NOT going to believe that the process was fair.  This is the first election that a lot of blacks have ever been interested in, and their disappointment and anger is going to be intense if they feel that they have been cheated.  If Barack Obama loses at any point, Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson will be on TV and the radio talking about irregularities at different precincts, paper ballots vs. electronic ballots, polls not staying open late when the weather was extremely bad in some areas, etc., and making impossible demands for a &#8220;re-vote.&#8221;  The Bush v. Gore election with all of the problems in Florida, with the Supreme Court getting involved, etc., would have turned even uglier than it did if Gore had been black, and I think that we might well be headed for a real crisis this time around.</p>
<p>If you live in a mixed-race area, you should stock up on food and water before the convention, and (depending on how the election goes) before the election.</p>

<p>Ok then.. thats six votes for Obama.. </p>
<p>My ethnic white democrat friends in IL tell me that they will go McCain, for the exact same reason. </p>
<p> And theres a whole lot more of them, than GOP blacks. </p>

			<p>And we have to be reminded that Barack Hussein Obama is the charismatic leader who will effect a reconciliation (by what means?) of disparate ethnic groups and political faiths, who can give us hope for a fresh and infinitely better future&hellip;. In this instance, his pigmentation and racial profile make the difference when one of his &#8220;own&#8221; supports his candidacy.  All of this from the &#8220;educated&#8221; black citizen who has professed Republican loyalties (namely to Bush) in the past.  If Obama does bring about a reconciliation at the national level, it will be the extreme left-wing factions of the Democratic party; the Clintonistas will desert either to McCain or to apathy.  And that will be several millions votes off the plate.  It will hard to win under those conditions.</p>
<p>Pat Buchanan is beginning to parse the racial divide on MSNBC.  He has cast a pall over the politically correct syncophants who demean Clinton and deify Obama on a nightly basis.  My guess is that he won&rsquo;t last long with that type of rhetoric.  He does have guts, and that&rsquo;s unusual on TV.</p>

			<p>Obama is a socialist.  He is the most left wing member of the Senate.  Considering that the Senate includes Ted Kennedy, that&rsquo;s saying a lot.  So for a black Republican to vote for Obama just proves that race trumps all political ideologies.  Granted, now that Paul&rsquo;s campaign has fizzled out there are few places for anti-war conservatives to go.  There is the Constitution Party.  However, the Constitution Party&rsquo;s candidate is white, so naturally this black &#8220;Republican&#8221; is going for Obama.<br>
