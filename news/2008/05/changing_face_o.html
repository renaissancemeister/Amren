<h1>Changing Face of Student Populations</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rachel Byrd, Victorville (California) Daily Press, May 23, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Some 15 years ago, the local parent population within the Victor Elementary School District consisted largely of those in the service at George Air Force Base, according to superintendent Ralph Baker.</p>
<p>But since the base closed, there have been some major changes in the local school &#8220;clients,&#8221; Baker said.</p>
<p>&#8220;That well-disciplined and orderly part of our population has been replaced with a percentage of our population that are either attached to somebody within the prison, or that person has been released from a prison to this area,&#8221; Baker said. &#8220;They tend to be more anti-authoritarian.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now parents are quicker to threaten schools with lawsuits rather than work out the problem, Baker said.</p>
<p>There are other factors to consider as well.</p>
<p>Hesperia Unified School District Superintendent Mark McKinney attributes the change in demographics to the number of people coming to the area for affordable housing, and not necessarily because they have a family member serving time.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When the district was unified about 20 years ago, there were about 200 English language learners and Hispanics made up about 15 to 20 percent of the Hesperia district population, McKinney said. Now, there are more than 5,000 English language learners, and 56 percent of the population is Hispanic.</p>
<p>Teachers have had to adjust to the shift in demographics by changing their daily lessons so that they are understandable to English language learners, McKinney said.</p>
<p>They have also had to adjust to the fact that in many families, both parents work to make ends meet and don&rsquo;t have as much time to sit down and help their kids with their homework &mdash; a practice that was more common 20 years ago.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While the demographics have changed dramatically in the last 20 years, improvements in teaching methodologies has meant that the needs of all students continue to be met, according to Baker.</p>

			<p>Oh, the great memories I have of driving to Las Vegas as a child and going through Victorville(which is right along I-15 on the way to Vegas). The Mexicans and White meth users, what a great city only surpassed in greatness by Barstow. Another mestizo stronghold.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;In interviews with eight parents of black students at the school, complaints include an unwelcome environment at the school and overt racism. And they say the school refuses to alter its teaching to take into account cultural learning differences that contribute to the achievement gap nationwide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How utterly laughable!</p>
<p>How utterly abjectly laughable!</p>
<p>And of course, how abjectly and utterly laughably bizarre!</p>
<p>Just &ldquo;how&rdquo; does one calculate an &ldquo;unwelcome environment &ldquo; or &ldquo;overt racism&rdquo; at a school?</p>
<p>Is it the teachers not allowing the attacking of white children by near feral black whelps in the former or the latter cases? Or is it simply, the teachers acting middle of the road in both? Is it the expulsion of a black 19-year-old in the 8th grade with a prison record from middle school, being kicked out, that does not &ldquo;take into account cultural learning differences?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If this were a fortune cookie question&rsquo;s answer, I guess it would read: &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a lack of understanding and compassion, that is like a dragon with a dog in its throat, chasing its &ldquo;unified&rdquo; tails.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

<p>Too, he should note that those moving in won&rsquo;t have far to go when it&rsquo;s they&rsquo;re turn to be sentenced to the slammer.  Also, their family members and neighbors, not yet sentenced, will be nearby for visitation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Teachers have had to adjust to the shift in demographics by changing their daily lessons so that they are understandable to English language learners, McKinney said.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, they must make great students too.  They&rsquo;re too dense or too lazy to learn English, yet they enroll in a class to learn something else they likely intend to pursue with the same gusto they embraced in their quest to communicate, in the new country they sneaked into.</p>
<p>America is so rich with diversity.</p>

			<p>Can anyone tell me why a superpower like the US can be invaded and colonized by third world criminals? If there is a good reason, I&rsquo;d certainly like to know. If it&rsquo;s because they work cheaper, it also means they pay lower taxes. How will they keep our politicians in the style to which they&rsquo;ve become accustomed? Sure seems like they&rsquo;d be looking for all the PhDs they could find rather than many who can&rsquo;t even speak their own languages correctly. Do the mighty in Washington want to reign over a balkanized country with hundreds of languages spoken? Seems to me to keep up with this would cost a fortune to pay translators and bring paperwork up to par with all the various dialects. And, laws will certainly have to be changed to allow for all the various cultures, such as an article I saw recently where Los Angeles is having to get used to barnyard animals in the city. Gee, what about animal sacrifices, violations of women&rsquo;s rights as some cultures hold dear, and gang violence intensifying? I&rsquo;m sure everyone can think of something they don&rsquo;t want in their country, much less their backyard. It&rsquo;s going to be interesting when our government makes the final thrust of turning us into the NAU. Interesting, indeed. I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m old enough to remember a kinder and gentler America.</p>

			<p>I hate what my country is becoming with rampant and unchecked immigration.  The large corporations are ruining this country with their greed and desire for a constant flow of cheap workers and a constantly increasing population to stimulate the economy.  We&rsquo;ve given our industrial knowledge to the Chinese just so we can have cheap prices at WalMart.  It&rsquo;s time for some massive deportations to clean up this country.  Let&rsquo;s make our products here and put the Chinese and Indians out of business!</p>

			<p>My cowboy hero growing up in the 1950&rsquo;s A.d. was Roy Rogers. I like his style, morality,mentioning God and his Nudie Cohn sleek cowboy outfits, especially his fancy cowboy pants and twin holsters. Because of victorville&rsquo;s changed culture from American legal Anglo to Mexican indian/hispanic; Roy&rsquo;s family moved his museum from Mexifornia to a still recognizable American state of Missouri. Mexicans have been quoted they don&rsquo;t support an American media cowboy star because he wasn&rsquo;t Mexican; such allowable racism on the invaders part.</p>

			<p>Both Victorville and Hesperia have seen massive increases in their Mestizo populations.  The white population, as a percentage, has plummetted over the past fifteen years.  The entire Victor Valley, as a whole, is probably only around 60-65% white, which seems high for Southern California, but which is much, much lower than the 80-90 percentage white ranges the area supported in the 70s and 80s.  </p>
<p>Only Apple Valley has a majority white school system, and it is somewhere between the 50 and 60 percent mark.  Compared to Victorville and Hesperia, it also has a considerably lower number of Mestizos in its schools, though it is much higher than it used to be.</p>
<p>I wish people would come out and say it: Non-whites into a White area destroy the integrity and cultural sustainability of an area, as well as the economic vitality of the area.  It destroys the feeling of togetherness, of being part of a larger community, and this &#8220;forces&#8221; whites to flee when they see it no longer resembling nor feeling what is like home.</p>
<p>Greater Los Angeles is overwhelmingly non-white in about half of all areas.  Shouldn&rsquo;t it be okay to say: &#8220;This small little area, can&rsquo;t we at least have and protect from non-white intrusion?  After all, this whole basin and desert was once nearly all-white.  What&rsquo;s the harm in saying this little pocket is ours, considering that nearly everything has been taken from us&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Twenty years ago I knew a family with three small children in Salt Lake whose neighborhood got shot up by some of the increasing diversity (yes, in Salt Lake). They had family in Victorville so they moved out there thinking they were escaping this plague. I don&rsquo;t know how the move turned out, but maybe the kids got through school and they were able to leave town before the real downturn hit.</p>
<p>Where to next? That&rsquo;s the big question for us nowadays. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Can anyone tell me why a superpower like the US can be invaded and colonized by third world criminals?&#8221;</p>
<p>Because the country is a fading power.  All the signs are there.  When you have to borrow money from other countries to support a military operation or get a tax rebate, then the writing is on the wall.   </p>

<p>June, my answer, and I&rsquo;m not being disrespectful or trite, would simply be  &mdash;  because the elite in this nation want the invasion.</p>
<p>The business elite, the New World Order Crowd,(probably one and the same)represented by Bush, Cheney,etc., the Senate, and much of the Congress, simply are allowing it, regardless of the  consequences to, or the rights and wishes of the American citizenry. They only make it obvious, every single day, that they couldn&rsquo;t care less what Americans think. They see the citizenry as weak, and stupid. When some of the more concerned among the citizenry can&rsquo;t stand it any longer and start to fight back, then these very same elected &#8220;representatives&#8221; call them racists, and vigilantes. This is the game they play with the American citizenry to achieve the plans of the elite whom they serve. It will continue as long as they see weak, divided, complacent and therefore, ineffectual Americans. </p>

<p>I wonder how you teach literature classes in mime?  Maybe you point at a Shakespeare collection and make dramatic facial expressions while pretending to hold a skull?  </p>
<p>Seriously: How could English speaking teachers teach anything to non-English speakers other than sports or certain vocational lessons that can be mimed.  Unless you are teaching budding geniuses, even math lessons require verbal or written explanations.  </p>
<p>Non-English speakers are just marking time in &#8220;mainstreamed&#8221; (non-ESL) classes until they pick up enough English on the playground to be able to understand the teacher.  Add the fact that the Mexican kids have sub-average IQs and illiterate parents&hellip;  What a waste of time and tax money!!  </p>
