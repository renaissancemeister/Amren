						<p>As thousands of immigrant workers and their supporters prepared to march through downtown Los Angeles today, some powerful new allies &mdash; business leaders &mdash; will be joining the call for an end to blanket immigration raids on work sites.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, joined by labor and political leaders at a news conference this morning, renewed its call for immigration reform that includes more worker visas and a path to legalization for undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>Chamber officials will be armed with a new study by the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp., scheduled for release today, showing that tens of thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in revenue could be lost if continued raids forced businesses to flee the state. They said the government should concentrate its limited resources and enforcement efforts on those companies with a clear history of exploitation of workers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The raids are frightening workers. They are worrying employers,&#8221; [said Samuel Garrison, the chamber of commerce&rsquo;s vice president of public policy]. &#8220;I think it&rsquo;s going to cause of lot of businesses to think twice about coming to Los Angeles.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Virginia Kice, spokeswoman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said officials would not stop enforcing the law. &#8220;It&rsquo;s ICE&rsquo;s sworn duty to enforce our nation&rsquo;s immigration and customs law and the agency is going to aggressively pursue that mandate,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This year, the May Day marches are expected to be smaller &mdash; about 20,000 in Los Angeles &mdash; and quieter. Nationwide marches are still expected to commemorate what has come to be known as International Workers&rsquo; Day. But widespread fear of government raids, along with the immigrant movement&rsquo;s shift in focus from marches to civic participation and a decision not to push a boycott this year, are expected to dampen turnout, immigrant advocates say.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Although march organizers have split in the last two years over whether to urge a boycott of work, school and consumer spending on May Day, they agreed this year to put aside boycott calls in favor of a united front on stopping the raids and working for comprehensive immigration reform, according to Angelica Salas of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The county employment development corporation study, conducted by its chief economist Jack Kyser, analyzed three industries thought to employ high numbers of immigrant workers &mdash; fashion, food and furniture manufacturing &mdash; and found that about 10,000 businesses created nearly 500,000 direct and indirect jobs and produced $18.3 billion in annual wages. If 15% of those firms left &mdash; and several are being aggressively wooed by out-of-state business recruiters, Kyser said &mdash; the region would lose nearly 75,000 jobs, the report found.</p>
<p>&#8220;The immigrant worker built Southern California and the L.A. economy,&#8221; Garrison said. &#8220;At the end of the day, they benefit everyone, whether legal or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, school officials in Los Angeles have prepared for possible May Day student walkouts with a broad-ranging plan emphasizing safety over disciplinary actions.</p>
<p>Walking out of school to participate in a march or rally will not result in an automatic suspension. Instead, school staff members intend to accompany student marchers to keep them as safe and monitored as possible. To return students to school, the district has stationed buses at seven locations, including in downtown, Sun Valley, the Harbor area and Van Nuys.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;The raids are frightening workers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Should have thought about that before dodging the border patrol and sneaking in the back door. Burglars deserve no sympathy if they are frightened by the arrival of the police. They are frightened because they know that what they are doing is wrong. They aren&rsquo;t afraid of imaginary &#8216;civil rights&rsquo; violations. They are afraid of justice.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are worrying employers,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wrong. I imagine many at AmRen will know this better than I, but as I recall, the employer/employee relationships is a contract, created only where the conduct is lawful. There is no law permitting &#8216;employment&rsquo; of illegal aliens. On the contrary, the law prohibits such practices and provides criminal penalties. For both parties. Two criminals do not enjoy the protection of law the during the course of conducting an illegal enterprise. These aren&rsquo;t employees and they aren&rsquo;t employers, but guess the chamber of commerce is happy to ignore illegal conduct, as long as someone profits.  </p>
<p>We should be deporting one party and handcuffing the other, not writing sob stories about how criminals are a benefit to society. But then again, this is the LA Times. </p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;&rsquo;The immigrant worker built Southern California and the L.A. economy,&rsquo; Garrison said&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, those immigrant workers certainly created, built and maintained the aerospace, defense and rocket science industries in Southern California.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;I think it&rsquo;s going to cause of lot of businesses to think twice about coming to Los Angeles&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>They already are avoiding LA due to abysmal schools, decreasing quality of life, grid-locked freeways, punishing taxes, punitive business-killing regulations, shuttered hospitals, unaffordable housing (if one cares to live in a safe (( read: White)) area, 1/3 of all new housing in LA is gated) and plenty of promises of more taxes, taxes, taxes  &mdash;  excuse me, in California, they&rsquo;re called FEES, not taxes.</p>
<p>Jack Kyser himself wondered recently if the leftists in Sacramento sit around dreaming up ways to drive businesses out of California.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;This year, the May Day marches are expected to be smaller &mdash; about 20,000 in Los Angeles&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Why in the hell are they allowed to march on a weekday downtown inconveniencing thousands of people? Imagine if the LA Marathon were held on a weekday  &mdash;  there would be unmitigated outrage.</p>
<p>Is there any hope left for this once beautiful city?</p>

			<p>Why not have a parade with criminals? The corrections officers and police could join them with the theme that thousands of jobs would be lost without criminals. Why not have a parade with welfare clients? The social workers could join them.</p>

<p>In years past the corporate world elites always concerned themselves with their bottom line above all, but they never lost sight of the fact that they were Americans first and profiteers second. Now they place profits above all other considerations, and they are as apt to use foreign workers over American workers as they are to move their factories to foreign countries no matter how slight their profits might increase just so long as they do increase.  </p>
<p>These recent corporate types have become transnationalists who hold no loyalty to anyplace, anything or anybody, except the almighty dollar.  Their greed knows no bounds anymore.  Multimillions in unearned bonuses seem to just whet their appetites for more.  That we see a few now and then who are led away by the police in handcuffs for bilking their businesses for millions doesn&rsquo;t seem to deter the rest one iota, because they continue on with the same dishonest policies as they always have. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always supported capitalism, but these last few years I can see that there has to be some kind of checks and balances on the free enterprise system on the corporate level, because many of these business elites are far worse than common criminals, and they have been more responsible for our conversion to a globalist society than even the leftist multicultural radicals. Oftentimes they ruin thousands of lives in their unethical quests to accumulate wealth at the expense of anything and anybody.</p>
<p>The founders would be appalled if somehow they came back for a week or a month and were versed on the present situation.  No matter how perfect a system is made in the beginning, humans will always find some way of screwing it up.  </p>

			<p>Samuel Garrison says that &#8220;the immigrant worker built Southern California and the L.A. economy.&#8221;  He is an unflinching liar.  Was the aerospace industry built by unskilled Spanish speakers?  The oil industry?  Hollywood?  After the Day of Reckoning, the easiest job in the world will be Prosecutor in the Court of Blood Treason.  These people have no defense except lies that cannot withstand any challenge.  I have never met anyone who could actually make a case for immigration face to face, not even libertarians.  If you ask them directly why they favor immigration, they either have to spout nonsense, or reveal their visceral hatred of White civilization.  </p>

We will sacrifice ANYTHING today, as long as those in power convince enough of us that some financial harm may be felt if we resist! &#8220;The Economy&#8221; is our God and all must bow before it, no matter that the sacrifice we offer is ourselves! </p>

			<p>I read this morning of the marches in Dallas. The Hispanic politicians welcomed the illegals and their supporters. One was quoted as saying, &#8220;this is your home, the door is open.&#8221; Well, he was half right. The old saying, &#8220;beggars can&rsquo;t be choosers&#8221; has been proven wrong with illegal aliens. They choose to break in and then demand to be amnestied. Never has their been a group of people who has a more glorified sense of entitlement and who think the US owes them a living. What happened to the famous &#8220;macho&#8221; image? They, and their leaders have no pride whatsoever. My daughter, when a very little girl, always declared, &#8220;I&rsquo;ll do it myself.&#8221; Not Mexico - their mantra is that, &#8220;the US should do it for us.&#8221; And the sad part is, our government will do exactly what they demand.</p>

			<p>Ranger is right.<br>
Greed has long overcome any sense of loyalty to country.  It becomes increasingly difficult to truly profess loyalty to &#8220;a proposition nation&#8221;, which is the current incorrect formulation of our national character.  The founders realized that the nation that they created was more than a set of beliefs, in fact it was a nation of European whites with their own culture, beliefs, and blood.  This concept, the true definition of our country, as a racially homogeneous group of european descended peoples has been under attack for over a century.  We can now see the results of the incessant attacks.</p>

			<p>Naturalization is the process by which people can become citizens of a country they were not born in. The United States Constitution grants Congress the power &#8220;to establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization&#8221; (Article I, section 8, clause 4). Soon after the Constitution was ratified Congress passed the Naturalization Act of 1790 (1 Stat. 103). The act provided </p>
<p>that any alien, being a free white person, who shall have resided within the limits and under the jurisdiction of the United States for the term of two years, may be admitted to become a citizen thereof, on application to any common law court of record, in any one of the States wherein he shall have resided for the term of one year at least, and making proof to the satisfaction of such court, that&hellip;<br>

			<p>Names - we need names, addresses, photos, phone numbers, e-mail addresses of these chamber of commerce traitors - and understand they will all be rich traitors. We need to do to these traitors what we did to South Carolina traitor senator Lindsey Graham - we outed him, let every member of his congressional staff know that he was a scoundrel and it worked.. We took Lindsey Graham down. It can be done again and again. It must be done.</p>
<p>Also understand it is much easier to attack, fight rich traitors than poor criminals, poor people who betray our people just to get some kind of job, some money to get by. The rich have no such excuses and it&rsquo;s much more fun to fight them.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do it.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a truthful version of Mr. Garrison&rsquo;s premeditated outburst:</p>
<p>&hellip;Law enforcement is frightening people who are here illegally. It worries felonious employers. [(should have) said Samuel Garrison, the chamber of commerce&rsquo;s vice president of public hypocrisy]. I think it&rsquo;s going to cause of lot of businesses who commit public crimes by hiring illegals to think twice about sculking into to Los Angeles.</p>

They are encouraging this!   Entering the country illegally is, well,  ILLEGAL. Those who support them are &#8220;aiding and abetting&#8221; illegal behavior&#8221; . </p>
<p>Also I note here (once again!) the continual blurring of any distinction between legal and illegal.</p>
<p>PS. Will students henceforth be able to &#8220;walk out&#8221; to participate in ANY march or rally?  I suspect not.</p>
