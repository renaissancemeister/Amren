<h1><a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0501/p01s01-uspo.html">Blacks Wrestle With Obama-Wright Rift</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ariel Sabar, Christian Science Monitor, May 1, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In disowning his former pastor Tuesday, a month after saying he could never do so, Sen. Barack Obama walked a very fine line: He had to renounce a prominent black preacher who had become a political problem without alienating African-American voters, a bedrock of his support, for whom churches are often a center of community life.</p>
<p>Senator Obama&rsquo;s break with the Rev. Jeremiah Wright Jr. &mdash; who officiated at his wedding and baptized his two daughters &mdash; could turn off some poorer and older, civil rights-era blacks who may already wonder about Obama&rsquo;s ability to identify with their lives, say experts in black politics and some black voters.</p>
<p>But younger and more affluent blacks say that whether or not they agree with Mr. Wright, they see the rupture as a political necessity for a man seeking to become the first African-American president.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Michael Durrah, a third-shift security guard at a Washington hotel, says Obama has more explaining to do.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your pastor is your No. 1 man in the neighborhood,&#8221; says Mr. Durrah, a Democrat who says neither Obama nor Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton had inspired him enough to vote in the District of Columbia primary.</p>
<p>&#8220;But Obama stepped backwards on&#8221; Wright, Durrah said early Wednesday on his walk home from work. &#8220;I&rsquo;m wondering why he&rsquo;s cutting ties with the man.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some see the renunciation as helping Obama with the working-class white voters he has struggled to attract. But it could soften support among African-Americans, prompting some to stay home in the general election if it helps crystallize a picture of him as out of touch, analysts say.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Says Eric McDaniel, an expert on black politics and religion at the University of Texas at Austin: &#8220;It gets back to the &lsquo;is he black enough?&rsquo; question.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s remarks Tuesday were a marked shift from his wide-ranging speech on race in Philadelphia on March 18. He distanced himself then from some of Wright&rsquo;s more inflammatory remarks but asked Americans to see the pastor as a member of an older generation of blacks stung by firsthand experiences of hate and segregation. &#8220;I can no more disown him than I can disown the black community,&#8221; Obama had said.</p>
<p>Many African-Americans will understand Obama&rsquo;s breach with Wright as a political inevitability, says Kenneth Edmonds, publisher of The Carolina Times, an African-American newspaper in Durham, N.C. &#8220;They will look and say, &lsquo;This is what he has to do,&rsquo;&#8221; Mr. Edmonds says. &#8220;African-Americans understand that when you go out and deal with white America, you have to be prepared to treat them in a certain way to make sure they are comfortable.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This is a part of life being an African-American.&#8221;</p>

			<p>One expects that ninety per cent of the black vote will go to the Democratic presidential candidate regardless of who he, she, or it might be. Considering that the Republican party is fielding a candidate who favors <i>la reconquista</i>, increased entitlement spending, an endless war from which Americans can derive no benefit, and endless deficit spending, a much more interesting question would be whether any candidate will appear whom normally intelligent white Americans can support.</p>

&ldquo;But Obama stepped backwards on&rdquo; Wright, Durrah said early Wednesday on his walk home from work. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m wondering why he&rsquo;s cutting ties with the man.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
It amazes me that anybody would NEED an explanation for why Obama &#8220;stepped backwards on&#8221; his reckless, loudmouthed, career-killing priest   &mdash;   but if Mr. Durrah sincerely doesn&rsquo;t comprehend the situation, then I will explain: </p>
<p>Obama HAD to distance himself from Rev. Wright (however belatedly) because Rev. Wright is a lunatic whose hatred of white people stops just short of recommending that we all be lined up and shot for our various sins against Victims of Color. And, although we have a LOT of mentally-ill white people in America today, most of us STILL aren&rsquo;t quite ready to be lined up and shot. </p>
<p>This leaves only the much smaller subset of white people who DON&rsquo;T object to being lined up and shot and/or eagerly await it: the self-flagellating racial masochists of the Far, Far Left; and the occasional female groupie swooning from jungle fever, like &#8220;Obama Girl&#8221; of Youtube fame. </p>
<p>At under 15% of the US population, Obama OBVIOUSLY can&rsquo;t win on black support alone. Even if 100% of them voted for him   &mdash;   instead of the 92% who have so far   &mdash;   it still wouldn&rsquo;t be nearly enough to blast their boyee into the White Hizzizzle all by deyselfs. </p>
<p>Therefore, Mr. Durrah, whether you like the idea or not, Obama NEEDS us &#8220;Typical White People.&#8221; </p>
<p>As Rev. Wright would say, &#8220;Capiche?&#8221; <br>

			<p>Again, with the &#8220;Razzle Dazzle Em.&#8221;  There is no rift, because Obama, Wright and Sharpton agree on virtually everything.  Triangulation, people.  Look it up.</p>
<p>Look at it this way   &mdash;   Obama is taking great pains to &#8220;distance&#8221; himself from Wright.  But even if he&rsquo;s genuine about it, and people genuinely believe Obama, would it really make a difference in the realm of practical politics?  If Jeremiah Wright were the U.S. Senator instead of Obama, would the voting record be any different?  If Jeremiah Wright became President instead of the &#8220;anti-Wright&#8221; Obama, would the White House policies be any different?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting rationalization, but is it really true? As far as  I can see, younger blacks are even more hostile towards white society than older blacks are. Certainly the crime rate of blacks has, if anything, only gone up over time, if that&rsquo;s any indication. The constant drumbeat of the Liberals of what a horrible, racist society this is can only serve to keep hostilities perpetually inflamed.</p>

			<p>He&rsquo;s black enough for me to vote for the other guy, no matter whom it is.  </p>
<p>You want to bet when the election is over and Obama heads back to Chicago with his tail between his legs that he will apologize to the reverend?</p>

			<p>This article is exhibit A that the majority of blacks hold the Rev Wright&rsquo;s views and are essentially at war with White America. Notice that even those who agree with his going against Wright only say he should do it as a political maneuver. They KNOW that Obama holds the noxious views of his pastor. </p>
<p>Maybe, finally enough whites will realize this. Probably some but not enough. </p>

			<p>Will these cretins ever rise above color and ask themselves if this Obama guy is prepared for office?  Oh no.</p>
<p>The answer is my last word in the previous paragraph.  I&rsquo;ve studied history my entire life, taught it for 33 years and can&rsquo;t recall a nominated candidate who was as little prepared for the Oval Office as Obama is.</p>
<p>As goofy as they were, Kerry, Gore, Mondale, Ford, and McGovern at least had been in Washington and gotten their hands dirty seeing how things operated.</p>
<p>As well, Carter, Dukakis, and Stevenson had been chief executives of fairly large states.</p>
<p>This guy from Illinois (Lord how I hate saying that), has no executive experience, very little legislative expertise, and even kess military know-how.</p>
<p>In short, a disaster waiting to happen for the nation.</p>

			<p>&#8216;I can no more disown him than I can disown the black community.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Obama is 50% white and 50% black. His white mother raised him while his black father was absent a lot. He is thought to be more black than white because of his skin coloring. We humans will never get past external appearances. He was more readily accepted by the black community. I&rsquo;ve posted before that the blacks in this country will not get from Obama what they expect. He cannot relate to their &#8216;struggle&rsquo;. (I was so glad to hear of his comments in PN and San Francisco.)</p>
<p>&#8216;I&rsquo;m wondering why he&rsquo;s cutting ties with the man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Other than the obvious racial ranting, Obama probably chose Rev. Wright&rsquo;s big church on the right side of town in south Chicago for reasons other than spiritual reasons. I think he did it for the political connections and because of his wife&rsquo;s influence. (She wept when Obama disowned Rev. Wright.)</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s been on fire to move up in the political rankings. It  would be foolish to let his comments or his associations slide. <br>
(But, we are talking about 21st century U.S. politics here.)</p>

			<p>It is getting tougher and tougher for the media talking heads to explain just what the Hell it is that most Blacks in this country actually support and believe&hellip;and what they allegedly do not! This seems to include Obama himself, though of course all in the media continue to insist he himself doesn&rsquo;t hold those(Wright&rsquo;s)beliefs&hellip;although it is increasingly difficult, if not impossible to explain exactly HOW that would be possible given their decades long, family-wide intimate relationship. </p>
<p>All this is obvious fraud - only the truly and willfully blind cannot see it&hellip;or just don&rsquo;t care one way or the other.</p>

			<p>The thing I don&rsquo;t get is&hellip; Wright must be 85% white. Heck, my Irish sister-in-law is darker than he is!</p>
<p>So why would he go around talking about how blacks are genetically predisposed to learn this way or act that way? Does being one tenth of one percent black negate all of a person&rsquo;s white genes?! Does it make it obligatory for one to adopt &#8220;black&#8221; attitudes and politics?</p>
<p>Wright ought to be glad he himself has got enough white genes to make him somewhat halfway intelligent. And Obama  &mdash;  also not exactly the blackest of folks  &mdash;  will have to drop him for no other reason than that Wright is bringing nonsensical matters into the political discourse while serving as a terrible political liability.</p>

<p>One of the big reasons younger blacks are more hostile towards White people than older blacks is by and large, younger blacks are without any marketable skills. They can&rsquo;t make it in this society and their violent acts reflect that. They have no worth. They&rsquo;re obsolete just as they&rsquo;re born. So, they have to have someone or something to blame for their plight, so they blame White society. </p>
<p>In the past, blacks knew somewhat how to work. Not anymore. You can see them at all hours of the day, just hanging around doing nothing. In a situation like that, it&rsquo;s a very short walk to trouble, whether it be violent or otherwise. People, of any color need a reason to exist. Unfortuneatly, for blacks, they have no reason for their existance in this country anymore.</p>

			<p>99% of all black Americans believe the following: Aids was invented to ruin black America because Africans have no built in resistance to it: Crack Cocaine was invented by the CIA to fund the Contra War and since only black communities would be infected, it was a win win situation for Reagan and his racist buddies: The government sanctions gun running into the black Ghettos. No blacks companies make guns and the gun lobby needs to sell guns so like crack it is a win win for republican racists. Rich whites make money off the guns and blacks off each other with the guns.<br>
     Now that Obama is openly dissing this nonsense, he is betraying his race {?} and acting white. Obam`s vote in North Carolina will drop by about 10% as blacks stay home rather than vote for another white phoney democrat.<br>

			<p>The evidence is that Obama is a Black power leftist.<br>
Consider his wife&rsquo;s remarks, Jeremiah Wright&rsquo;s statements, etc, etc.</p>
<p>He refuses to wear a flag pin and put his hand over<br>

<p>Obama is without question a White America hater<br>
trying to infiltrate the Oval office.</p>
<p>White people had better WAKE UP and realize<br>
this is how A LOT of blacks think and feel.<br>
Hate America. And REALLY hate whites.</p>
<p>I only wish blacks would simply move to Africa.<br>
Then maybe they might appreciate America and<br>
stop their whining and victimhood mentality (blame whites)</p>

<p>Ye gods, is there such a thing?  Is this supposed to be higher education?  Couldn&rsquo;t he find something useful to study?  Like, say, Hobbitology?</p>

Wow, talk about distilling an issue down to its very essence. Congrats Jack, that is one quotable quote you got there! </p>
<p>The only thing I would add to this terrific aphorism is: </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;and that fact should indicate just HOW FAR APART blacks and whites really are!&#8221; <br>

			<p>&#8220;One of the big reasons younger blacks are more hostile towards White people than older blacks is by and large, younger blacks are without any marketable skills. They can&rsquo;t make it in this society and their violent acts reflect that. They have no worth. They&rsquo;re obsolete just as they&rsquo;re born. So, they have to have someone or something to blame for their plight, so they blame White society.&#8221;</p>
<p>The jobs their grandparents did didn&rsquo;t require any skill.  Bell hops, train porters, shoeshiners, maids, farmhands, etc.  Society has made it too easy for blacks to get by without working.  Cut off the welfare and if they don&rsquo;t want to work, let them starve.   </p>
