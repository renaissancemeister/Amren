						<p>Canadian authorities cannot find 41,000 people who were classified as security risks or illegal immigrants and ordered to leave the country, an official watchdog reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Auditor-General Sheila Fraser] also said a police database of those told to leave Canada is riddled with errors, and said computer problems mean authorities have only a limited ability to track offenders.</p>
<p>The revelations are likely to embarrass the Conservative government, which won power in January 2006 on a pledge to boost law and order.</p>
<p>Fraser said that in September 2007, some 63,000 people had been served with immigration warrants ordering them to leave Canada. The Border Services Agency &mdash; responsible for expelling those deemed undesirable &mdash; knew the location of 22,000.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Canada&rsquo;s lack of exit controls means there is no way of knowing how many of the 41,000 were in Canada. Fraser said most were refugees whose applications had been rejected.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Critics, particularly some in the United States, have long complained that Canada is too lax about cracking down on illegal immigrants and others who could pose a security risk.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jack Layton, leader of the opposition New Democrats, said the government was inept.</p>
<p>Fraser said computer problems meant &#8220;the agency&rsquo;s ability to track individuals in the detention and removal process remains limited.&#8221; A check last October of a police database detailing the removal orders found several thousand errors.</p>
<p>In 2003, opposition legislators criticized the previous Liberal government after Fraser&rsquo;s office estimated that 36,000 people who should have been kicked out were still in Canada.</p>
<p>&#8220;There remains a growing number of individuals who might be in Canada illegally &mdash; whose whereabouts are unknown &mdash; thereby jeopardizing the integrity of Canada&rsquo;s immigration program,&#8221; Fraser wrote.<br>

					<p>But I&rsquo;ll bet they would have no difficulty finding (and prosecuting) anyone who gave a speech or wrote a tract about this.  &#8220;Hate crime&#8221; violations will get enforced, even if immigration violations won&rsquo;t.</p>

					<p>Canadian authorities had no problem tracking down Ernst Zundel, a legal resident of Canada for 40 some years and then shipping him back to his birthplace of Germany. He now sits in jail as a political prisoner. </p>
<p>If millions of illegals aliens are still walking the streets of United States causing violent deaths of <span class="caps">U.S. </span>citizens, would Canada be experiencing the same trauma, but on a smaller scale? Obviously, <span class="caps">YES</span>!</p>
<p>In the <span class="caps">U.S., </span><i>illegal</i> aliens cause about 25 deaths <i>every</i> day according to this article.</p>

					<p>This article doesn&rsquo;t even touch the number of those who have successfully been deported only to return at a later date. </p>
<p>Also, for all the Americans who have difficulty visiting Canada, you should know that it is a two way street. I, too, cannot cross over to your country. About 12 years back I tried to cross the border to visit old friends. On a greyhound bus that was full, about 60 passengers, only four were White, and I was refused entry. My parents emmigrated to the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>when I was two yrs. old. I went to school there, pledged allegiance to your flag, became a Boy Scout, and considered myself a proud American. Although French was my first language, I recall telling my parents to speak English whenever my fiends were visiting. I love both countries, Canada and the United States, but, to us an old quote, fear both of our governments.</p>
<p>Also, &#8220;Canadian authorities had no problem tracking down Ernst Zundel,&#8221; (Posted by at 10:23 PM), because American <span class="caps">INS </span>agents handed him over to them. </p>

  &mdash;      &mdash;      &mdash;      &mdash;      &mdash;      &mdash;       &mdash;  <br><br>
That is so very true!   Not just singularly inept, but <i><b> strangely</b></i>   inept.  I remember maybe -  oh, back 20 years or so yrs. ago - that some West African country (Ghana, I think) which was more prosperous than its neighbors and had attracted many illegal aliens had resolved to expell all its illegal &#8220;workers&#8221; from other African countries.  They were promptly rounded up by the hundreds of thousands and summarily  <span class="caps">DEPORTED </span>with no further ado.   There was no African <span class="caps">ADL </span>or <span class="caps">ACLU </span>wringing its hands and wailing about racism and xemophobia, and the need for more diversity.</p>
<p>If Ghana can do it, why can&rsquo;t we?   Yet, our helpless authorities, even the US president, wring their hands and  insist that this is unrealistic and would be an impossibility. They never tire of reminding us that America was &#8220;built by its immigrants&#8221; and &#8220;diversity is our strength&#8221;, in a script that was probably penned for them by the <span class="caps">SPLC </span>or <span class="caps">ADL.   </span></p>
<p>Nonsense!  Where there&rsquo;s a will there&rsquo;s a way. Do we need Ghana to show us how?  Thanks Bobby.</p>

					<p>&#8220;Canadian authorities cannot find 41,000 people who were classified as security risks or illegal immigrants and ordered to leave the country,&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Canada, like the US has lost control not only of its borders, but the entire country, in so far as immigration is concerned.<br>
The same subversive elements that are pushing diversity in the US have been at work in Canada, and they have been far more successful there.</p>
<p>The degeneration of both countries is proceeding at a slow but steady pace; however, their immigration and internal policies are unsustainable.  When critical mass is reached, the resulting implosion will rock the world, and the rest of the West will follow suit.  </p>
<p>I read a couple of far right web sites today that encouraged advocates to save the country by taking action.  They&rsquo;re obviously unaware that they&rsquo;ll get what they want by doing nothing and concentrating on being prepared, because the country is on an irreversable path to destruction with degeneration steadily occurring with or without their help.  The only uncertainty is when it will occur.</p>
