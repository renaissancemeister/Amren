<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>The gipsy mother who forced her daughter of 13 to marry a 14-year-old boy yesterday dismissed British values as irrelevant to her.</p>
<p>Renata Gural said she was unconcerned by the outrage over the teenagers&rsquo; Romany wedding ceremony at a pub in East London.</p>
<p>Mrs Gural, 31, who is pregnant with her sixth child, said: &#8220;I&rsquo;m not bothered what anyone thinks.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ll be the one who decides if my daughter is old enough to marry. I got married when I was 14 in such a ceremony and it hasn&rsquo;t done me any harm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just because I live in Britain doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;ve got to behave the way you lot think is right. I&rsquo;ll live my life the way I want and that includes the way I bring up my kids.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t care what the neighbours think, or social services. It&rsquo;s not my problem people around here don&rsquo;t understand our culture and values.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Daily Mail revealed earlier this month how her daughter, Bozena, married Bezo, the son of another gipsy family originally from Poland, in front of 150 guests at the Central pub in East Ham.</p>
<p>A community elder clasped the couple to his chest, bound their hands in a scarf, kissed them both on the lips and pronounced them man and wife.</p>
<p>The guests then danced all night as a Polish band played raucous gipsy music.</p>
<p>Bozena said yesterday she was &#8220;really happy&#8221; with married life, adding: &#8220;For the first time in my life I feel like a proper grown-up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before I was just a little girl and then suddenly there I was &mdash; married. That&rsquo;s every girl&rsquo;s dream isn&rsquo;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bozena continues to share a cramped two-bedroom terraced house in East Ham, with 14 relatives. Her parents do not make her, or any of her siblings, go to school.</p>
<p>Neighbours say the family, who live on benefits and do not pay rent, are terrorising the street by playing loud music late at night, throwing rubbish into neighbours&rsquo; gardens and spitting on their windows.</p>
<p>Bezo wants his young bride Bozena to move in with him and his parents two miles away in Manor Park.</p>
<p>But she wants to stay at home, saying she would miss her mother if she left.</p>
<p>Her mother insisted the young couple had not consummated the marriage and that she will not allow her daughter to have sex until she is 18.</p>
<p>Their marriage is not recognised under British law, but there are fears that similar underground ceremonies could become common as the number of gypsies in Britain rises following the eastwards expansion of the EU.</p>
<p>Romania and Poland, which have large Romany gipsy (or Roma) populations, have taken a tough stance on such weddings by threatening prosecutions on underage sex charges.</p>
<p>This has led to concerns that they may move to the UK instead.</p>
<p>Liberal Democrat peer Baroness Nicholson, a long-time campaigner against child weddings, claimed the young couple would &#8220;be scarred for life&#8221; by the experience.</p>
<p>They married on April 28 after a deal stuck between their fathers soon after they arrived in Britain three years ago.</p>
<p>There are estimated to be nearly 100,000 Roma in Britain, although no figures are available for how many have arrived from Eastern Europe. For centuries they have encouraged their children to marry young.</p>
<p>Often girls are &#8220;promised&#8221; to a boy from the age of seven or eight in return for a cash dowry. It is considered essential that the girl is a virgin.<br>

			<p>This sort of thing is common with Muslims too. It does not sound like the girl is being abused in any way since she is not being forced to have sex with her 14 year old husband. I do have a problem with nobody going to school, taking assistance when the family is more than likely running some sort of money making scam and terrorizing the neighborhood. </p>

<p>And just because you live in Britain doesn&rsquo;t mean you can live any way YOU believe is right.</p>
<p>This should make everyone question why these people are coming to the west. They could stay in their own Islamic nations and live by their own religious laws and customs yet they move here by choice and don&rsquo;t believe they should live by the standards of their new home.</p>
<p>Ominous, troubling, and telling.</p>

			<p>Gypsies are a blight, born criminals and adversaries of whatever country they live in.  We ought carve out a piece of Africa for them and deport every last Gypsy from Europe and North America.  See how long they last with no one to steal from except each other.  </p>

			<p>The UK, like the US, has imported the dregs of the world, which is bringing both countries ungodly problems.</p>
<p>No nation can survive a pluralistic society, especially if it is made up of the losers and cast offs from other cultures.</p>
<p>Homogeneity is an obvious strength, known by every thinking person, and diversity is a dangerous weakness that spawns contentious inter-tribal fights, squabbles and out-and-out violence.</p>
<p>The West will implode at some point, but not before the native inhabitants of each country are made miserable by the blacks, flakes, oddballs, illiterates and misfits, from around the world.</p>
<p>China must feel very smug now, knowing that a multicultural/multiracial society is a recipe for disaster and that their sensible homogeneity will likely see them through many trials and tribulations.  Japan will be the same, as Russia may likely be if Putin&rsquo;s influence is felt for another ten years.  </p>
<p>Although the West will probably survive its experiment with diversity, it will be severely decimated, divided into ethnic enclaves, and will not be part of the super power structure in the world of the second half of the 21st century.</p>

			<p>Gypsies are NOT muslims, they are christians- sort of. They also don&rsquo;t come from Africa. Speculation is they are originally from India. Nobody knows for sure.<br>
Just because you&rsquo;re a bigot doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t be an educated and informed bigot.<br>
There are other things to consider. There are gipsies all over Europe and they are not all the same. Most of France/Spain/Portugal and Hungary&rsquo;s Romas are like the local population. Very advanced, assimilated and VERY much part of the local culture, with a very big contribuion to the countries&rsquo; cultures and arts. One of the most problematic group of gipsies is the one from Romania that has mostly resisted the country&rsquo;s efforts (esp. the Communist regime&rsquo;s efforts) to put an end to  their centuries old cutomes.</p>
<p>That said, maybe this woman thinks she doesn&rsquo;t have to abide to British norms but she sure as hell has to abide to the British laws. It&rsquo;s the country&rsquo;s responsibility to enforce the laws and send those kids to school or their parents to jail.<br>
Why Britain accepted them in, supports their idle way of life and their lawlessness, I have no idea. Send them back to where they came from along with anyone who doesn&rsquo;t respect the law of the land. </p>

<p>I think that much is obvious.   More importantly, we should be questioning why the West is ALLOWING these people to come in and abuse us and parasitize us.  (Perhaps &#8220;encouraging&#8221; would be the better word.)</p>

I just watched the film  &#8220;Idiocracy&#8221; last night [everyone should], and it is still vivid in my mind.  This above story perfectly confirms the central premise of &#8220;Idiocracy:&#8221;   that the spongers, the misfits, the irresponsible, the parasites, the criminals and the retards are multiplying uncontrollably with every generation,  blessed by the establishment and paid for by the taxpayers,  while those responsible citizens who must support them and furnish them with (free) services are dwindling to the point of eventual extinction.  </p>
<p>While the film presents it as comedy, of course, [how could they do it otherwise?] the message is clear. The end result will be social degeneracy, economic collapse, mayhem and utter chaos.  It&rsquo;s as obvious as two plus two equal four.</p>

<p>People like them will break the back of the British welfare system.  It will only end when men of ability withdraw their consent to be governed, and refuse to support those of no ability.</p>

           There isn&rsquo;t a shadow of doubt that Gypsies came from India - this is based on incontrovertible DNA evidence plus the evidence of language similarity and of history - they were unknown in Europe prior to the 14th century.<br>
To say &#8216;nobody knows for sure&rsquo; only highlights your ignorance, for it *is* known for sure - as certain as anything in this World is.</p>

			<p>That might be a Gypsy immigrants from Czechia - the name Bozena (more correctly transcribed as Bozhena) is an old Czech name and also the name of the mother -  Renata - is in the form used here (equivalent of Renée).</p>

			<p>You cannot have a welfare society and immigration.  If you need immigrants, you need them for their labor, not for their taking of the hardworking taxpayer.  Why Europe, Canada, Australia, and the US insist on importing people that will never appreciate or assimilate to our culture is mind boggling.  The only assimilation they do is to the welfare system.  </p>

			<p>I knew that the gypsies are at least nominally Christian. What I was getting at is that the Muslims are doing the same thing at much higher numbers. I knew of a Muslim family that got a 12 year old girl married since she was living in a step family environment and it would be &#8220;inapropriate&#8221; for her step brother to see her without a headscarf. She immediatly went to live with her &#8220;husband&#8221; unlike this girl and was pregnant at 13 and a mother at 14. She probibly has 8-9 kids by now and who of us can keep up with a birthrate like that. </p>

			<p>My wife is from the Czech and Slovak republics and they hate gypsies. Gypsies are the scourge of their societies (I guess every country has their low life minorities). Most all of them live on the gov&rsquo;t dole (like this low life), scam, cheat, and steal. No pride whatsoever. Which makes me wonder why in the world any sane gov&rsquo;t, like the UK, would allow a leach to immigrate to their country? I mean come on, what possible benefit is this parasite to the people of Britain? If Western countries had any intelligence, or b*lls, they would deport every single immigrant from the past 40 years that is not a productive member of society (ie working a steady job and paying taxes in excess of the gov&rsquo;t largesse they receive). Not doing so only encourages all of the nonproductive leaches from poor countires to immigrate for a better life while doing nothing in return.</p>

			<p>Reply to come-on at 9:51 PM:</p>
<p> &#8220;Gypsies&#8221; do INDEED come from India. They come from the north of the country. Linguists long ago proved this by studying their language. The Europeans in the Balkans called them &#8220;Gypsies&#8221; because they thought they came from Egypt with their darker complexions. Gypsies have been nothing but a curse, plague and parasites to Europeans since the first day of their arrival. They have never contributed anything to Europe or the world. How many Gypsy poets, writers, philosophers, scientists etc, can you think of? Their entire culture is based on the principal of parasitism.</p>

			<p>Likewise &#8216;Idiocracy&rsquo; is a favorite of mine too, a very prolific film. I&rsquo;ve shown it to all my friends describing it as a Sci-Fi (being set 500 years in the future).<br>
Even my fiercely liberal mother thought it was scarey because it&rsquo;s comming true.</p>
<p>We all know here that the lower the IQ, depressingily the more off spring that are produced. But I also find it interesting that the higher the cultures have the highest suicide rates i.e. Japan has an estimated 30,000 suicide websites and conversely Africa&rsquo;s apparently very low.   </p>

			<p>      They aren&rsquo;t Westerners so why foist our values on them?<br>
Let them marry when they want and consumate it too. Who cares?<br>
The main point is a negative: don&rsquo;t subsidize them at all. They&rsquo;ll leave just like fleas leave a dog with a new flea collar.<br>
When you get into silly situations you are bound to get into im-<br>
possible conundrums like what to do with absurdly prolific gyp-<br>
sies on welfare. The answer is simple: get out of the situation;<br>
refuse to play by the leftist rules. There are no literally no<br>
answers to these questions the way they are framed by the fourth<br>

			<p>The film &#8220;Idiocracy&#8221; was said to have been squelched by the film industry.  It was given zero publicity, no critics screenings, was restricted to just a few theaters, and then was withdrawn from showing.  The big question: WHY?   Well, when you see it, that&rsquo;s not hard to guess.</p>

			<p>@ Schoolteacher - the Romanian Minister of Foreign Affairs in a fit of rage said exactly what you said, that the Gypsies should be sent to North Africa. Now he is the &#8216;former&rsquo; Minister of Foreign Affairs&hellip;. </p>
<p>Gypsies are aggressive. If they sense fear you&rsquo;re in trouble. They sense a lot of fear and girly attitudes in democracies, and they thrive in this system. They survived in communism too, but they were too intimidated to pull the audacious stunts and mocking behavior they&rsquo;re pulling now. They are running amock throughout Europe and nobody stops them. </p>

			<p>That gypsy woman succinctly sums WHY the native populations tend to RESENT the influx of immigrants! IT&rsquo;S THE STUBBORN REFUSAL OF IMMIGRANTS TO LIVE LIKE THEIR [NORMAL] NEIGHBORS!</p>
<p>What sane person wants a bunch of ragtag freeloading newcomers blasting loud music, flinging trash around. Blatantly refusing to consider the effect of their lifestyle on the native population? WHY are these people allowed to live rent free? WHY is the government subsidizing them? Is there no work   &mdash;   sweeping streets, even   &mdash;   so these gypsies can at least make a pretense of earning their free ride.</p>
<p>What in the name of hell is wrong with the British (or any EUROPEAN government) officials to allow the influx of immigrants into their respective country, therefer to be subsidized and supported by the taxpaying citizens into perpetuity? If the immigrants do not have (verifiable) promised jobs or sponsors, they SHOULD NOT BE ACCEPTED AS IMMIGRANTS! If for no other reason, it not being fair to the White taxpaying population.</p>

From the article (about the arrogant attitude of Gypsies towards those who have accepted them ((willing or not)) into their countries, i.e. the UK):</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;&rsquo;I don&rsquo;t care what the neighbours think, or social services. It&rsquo;s not my problem people around here don&rsquo;t understand our culture and values.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Steve Sailer writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;the Gypsy culture trains its children from a very early age to be economic parasites. The Gypsies possess a classic &#8216;in-group morality.&rsquo; While extremely loyal to their clan, their culture inculcates in them an almost sociopathic disregard for the rights of outsiders&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And lest you think this problem is limited to the wealthier countries of the EU (who cannot deport their Gypsies), this from Rochester NY, courtesy of Lutheran Refugee Resettlement program:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;A Monroe County grand jury is about to hear the story of a Rochester teenager who says her mother sold her for $3,000 to another family that forced her to do household chores and have sex with a 21-year-old man&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;The father of the family got sick, and received about a million dollars worth of medical care, after which he passed away anyhow. The congregation made sure that the house &mdash; where the alleged rape took place &mdash; was completely furnished by donations&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The family is ROMA, imported into Rochester from Albania by do-gooder refugee settlement idiots who when asked WHY they would deign to import such a different culture replied:  &lsquo;The love of God is in our hearts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>http://www.vdare.com/fulford/refugee_industry.htm</p>
<p>Yes, dump these third worlders iinto settled communities &rsquo;for the love of God&rsquo; and expect the taxpayers to foot the bill  &mdash;  and tolerate their deviancies  &mdash;  for generations and generations to come  &mdash;  when will these &#8216;resettlement&rsquo; industries by made to answer for the destruction they are wrecking?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how anyone could contribute to the Lutheran (or Catholic) church when both seem hell-bent on destroying the historic American population.</p>

<p>Good grief!  I would change that word from &#8220;love&#8221; to &#8220;idiocy&#8221;.<br>
No doubt these saints must feel very good about themselves   &mdash;    at everyone else&rsquo;s expense!</p>
<p>I heartily agree that the Lutherans (or ANY OTHER such deluded group of do-gooders) should be made to pay for whatever wreckage they cause. Far from &#8220;doing good&#8221;, they are socially irresponsible and idiotically short-sighted.  Ultimately, these busy-body enablers are just as bad as the criminals whom they enable. And they should be held just as responsible for any crimes or damage that result from their misguided actions.</p>

			<p>&#8220;And lest you think this problem is limited to the wealthier countries of the EU (who cannot deport their Gypsies), this from Rochester NY, courtesy of Lutheran Refugee Resettlement program:&#8221;</p>
<p>They do have gypsies here in the US(called travelers) though they are not nearly as numerous in numbers  as in Europe. They would go from state to state staging fake accidents and pulling insurance scams to get money. One woman even sued a hotel for lax security by faking rape. She had a one night stand with a man she picked up(so their would be evidence to back her up}, then went to the hospital and said she was raped. She claimed it happened in her hotel room and sued the hotel. Her family was in on the scam. She and her family were caught and charged with fraud. Then she claims she has &#8220;found religion&#8221; and has changed. Yeah, right.</p>
