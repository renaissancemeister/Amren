<p>The principal at Prairie View Middle School allowed a group of Muslim students to have a separate lunch table to accommodate religious observances during the month of Ramadan, but rejected a similar request by Catholic students for Lent, The Chicago Daily Southtown reported Wednesday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Principal Joe Martin said he never intended to set a double standard for students, particularly along religious lines. Rather, Martin said he rejected the request of Catholic students because they failed to make it before the Lenten season began.</p>

			<p>The issue has momentarily been resolved.  The school gave in and allowed the Catholic kids a spearate table during Lent and other religious holidays.</p>
<p>This only occurred, however, after much pressure from the parents of the Catholic kids.</p>
<p>Let this be a lesson to White people everywhere: school administrators are extremely pusillanimous.  Put pressure on them and they break down.  </p>
<p>Their whole philosophy of performing their job is &#8220;how will this make us look?&#8221;.  It&rsquo;s not right or wrong but public perception.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to see what might now happen if the Buddhist students, Protestants, Jews, atheists, Taoists and those of the Bahai faith want preferential treatment.</p>

			<p>I smell a lawsuit and hope that the Catholic students bankrupt the entire school system where Prairie View Middle School resides. Unfortunately, only the threat of lawsuits will get the attention of the Diversitoids and force them to end the double standards.</p>

			<p>I well remember nine eleven, when I saw mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers and loved ones of every type forced to jump from the World Trade Center to avoid a horrible flaming death beyond description. Meaningful lives cut short by the blind hate of Muslims. Muslims permitted by their faith to lie to intergrate themselved into civilized societies. Why do nations like the U.S. allow Muslims into the country. Is it so hard to realize Muslims will never assimilate because their evil faith forbids it. Do those who think there are peaceful Muslims ever imagine what life would be like in a society dominated and ruled by Islam and Sharia law. Wake up West, the hour is late.</p>

			<p>Mr Martin!  You&rsquo;re the Principal!  Why do you need a long lead time for something so simple?  All you have to do is ask how they plan to arrange it, and say &#8220;Yes&#8221;.  If you are not flexible enough to get something done on short notice, particularly something that does not need your direct supervision, you have no business working with kids.  Have you never noticed that they are often late?  Do you generally cancel activities that don&rsquo;t begin promptly?  You may not be anti-Catholic, but if not, you are a poor choice for a middle school principal.</p>

<p>Horsepucky.  He did set a double standard because he was afraid that CAIR and the diversity gestapo would kill his career, and that the nice, peaceful Muuuuuslims would saw his head off with a dirty scimitar.  But he also bet that the uncivilized, belligerent, and violent(hah!) Catholics would hardly make a peep.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s high time the erstwhile Western dhimmis start making some very loud and threatening peeps against the tide of Islam, among other spreading cancers&hellip;</p>

			<p>I see this same thing at the University of Maryland Baltimore County all of the time. When that Ramalamadingdong holiday ends, the Moslems have a big feast. ALL students in my class were told to bring a non-offending dish to the celebration so that ALL could celebrate.  A special room was set up as some eastern-facing prayer room for these same Moslems. Christmas was on its way, but that was considered oppresive and profane   &mdash;   forbiddn by the university. ALLAH can kiss my&hellip;.</p>

			<p>OH MY GOD! As a teacher in a Catholic school, I have seen the exact same double standard concerning students of different racial backgrounds.  </p>
<p>In March, two of our white students were reported by another student to have possessed &#8220;prescription drugs&#8221; (oxycotin that one of them had stolen from his father&rsquo;s medicine cabinet)on campus. The students admitted that they had taken the drugs off campus before school.  These students had a &#8220;hearing&#8221; and were promptly expelled. These students were seniors about to graduate in a few months. </p>
<p>A month later, a black student attended a school dance with a soda can filled with gin.  The intoxicated student was given a &#8220;time-out&#8221; at the dance, and was &#8220;excused.&#8221;  This student had his hearing and was readmitted because he and his grandmother were &#8220;apologetic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last month, a black student&rsquo;s locker was searched revealing illegal drugs. The student admitted his intent to sell. The municipal cops were called and the student was handcuffed and arrested right on campus in front of other students.  Last Monday, he returned to school with no administrative explanation.  </p>
<p>People need to know that this double-standard is the status quo in our schools, and I, for one, am sick of it.   </p>

			<p>&ldquo;The threat came from a Somali student who is Muslim, according to Hurd, St. Cloud State and school district officials.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, here is my scorecard on this topic and it is very objective, since I thankfully once had a pet Labrador, and now unfortunately have regular contact with Somalis.</p>
<p>So here goes:  </p>
<p>1.) Labradors, intelligent and graceful.</p>
<p>Somalis, obtuse and shambling;</p>
<p>2.) Labradors, loyal and sociable;</p>
<p>Somalis, Muslims and typically so;</p>
<p>3.) Labradors, protective and helpful;</p>
<p>Somalis, hostile and obnoxious; </p>
<p>4.) Labradors, good with children;</p>
<p>Somalis, not even good with themselves;</p>
<p>5.) Labradors, fond of pork chops and bacon;</p>
<p>Somalis, antagonistic toward swine and even wine; </p>
<p>6.) Labradors, reasonably respectful of house rules;</p>
<p>Somalis, irrationally ignorant of house rules;</p>
<p>7.) Labradors, grateful for kindness and inclusion;</p>
<p>Somalis, ungrateful and intrusive to the same;</p>
<p>And</p>
<p>8.) Labradors, tolerant of all religions;</p>
<p>Somalis, freakishly intolerant in the name of &ldquo;the prophet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, draw your own conclusions from here in this &ldquo;growth process&rdquo; and as Porky Pig would say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all folks&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

			<p>Princpal Joe Martin should be fired.His school should lose all federal and state funding.The ideal answer would be to close down the public school system and replace it with a voucher system so parents could choose what they consider a good education for their kids.Excellence in academics would be mandatory.Govermental control and political correctness would not.Diversity?That would be up to the parent.The only true requirement should be academic excellence and patriotism.Any school that does not adhere to these simple principals should receive no public funding.Our children are being fed the globalist agenda.It is time to take back America or watch it die.It is up to us.None of the three stooges running for president will help us.</p>

			<p>You&rsquo;re no poet, John PM.  Neither am I when it comes to Gregor.  He was mauled once by a cougar, which I horribly beat with three feet of heay chain untl I broke every bone in it&rsquo;s rear body.  I was really bloody angry.  It later died and I have the skull.  My mother was upset Gregor was bleeding all over and wanted to put him out to die.  I brought him back in over and over again and wrapped up his head and neck and put him on an old bunch of rags in the basement, and petted him while I sat with him.  He came out of it OK.  He liked my sister better for the most part, as she talked to him more, but on his last night, he hopped up onto my lap and slept there.</p>
<p>The fight was a 20-pound schnauzer, a 120-pound cougar, a 100-pound kid, and a 10-pound chain.  The lock on the end of that chain tore huge chunks of meat out of that cougar, and I used it two-handed.  The chain was for locking up my bike.</p>
<p>Gregor von sum Barking Schnauzer</p>
<p>Senstive, and afraid of fireworks.</p>

			<p>Great bit of writing there John PM. I think the comparison of dogs with Muslims is particularly apt bearing in mind their attitude towards our four legged friends.<br>
 <br>
labradors,love their owners unconditionally,<br>
Somalis, hate all infidels unconditionally.</p>
