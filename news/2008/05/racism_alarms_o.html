<p>Here&rsquo;s the worst: In Muncie, a factory town in the east-central part of Indiana, Ross and her cohorts were soliciting support for Obama at malls, on street corners and in a Wal-Mart parking lot, and they ran into &#8220;a horrible response,&#8221; as Ross put it, a level of anti-black sentiment that none of them had anticipated.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first person I encountered was like, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll never vote for a black person,&rsquo;&#8221; recalled [Danielle] Ross [a canvasser for Barack Obama], who is white and just turned 20. &#8220;People just weren&rsquo;t receptive.&#8221;</p>
<p>For all the hope and excitement Obama&rsquo;s candidacy is generating, some of his field workers, phone-bank volunteers and campaign surrogates are encountering a raw racism and hostility that have gone largely unnoticed &mdash; and unreported &mdash; this election season. Doors have been slammed in their faces. They&rsquo;ve been called racially derogatory names (including the white volunteers). And they&rsquo;ve endured malicious rants and ugly stereotyping from people who can&rsquo;t fathom that the senator from Illinois could become the first African American president.</p>
<p>The contrast between the large, adoring crowds Obama draws at public events and the gritty street-level work to win votes is stark. The candidate is largely insulated from the mean-spiritedness that some of his foot soldiers deal with away from the media spotlight.</p>
<p><b>Meeting cruel reaction</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Documentary filmmaker Rory Kennedy, the daughter of the late Robert F. Kennedy, said she, too, came across &#8220;a lot of racism&#8221; when campaigning for Obama in Pennsylvania. One Pittsburgh union organizer told her he would not vote for Obama because he is black, and a white voter, she said, offered this frank reason for not backing Obama: &#8220;White people look out for white people, and black people look out for black people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obama campaign officials say such incidents are isolated, that the experience of most volunteers and staffers has been overwhelmingly positive.</p>
<p>The campaign released this statement in response to questions about encounters with racism: &#8220;After campaigning for 15 months in nearly all 50 states, Barack Obama and our entire campaign have been nothing but impressed and encouraged by the core decency, kindness, and generosity of Americans from all walks of life. The last year has only reinforced Senator Obama&rsquo;s view that this country is not as divided as our politics suggest.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Election Day in Kokomo, a group of black high school students were holding up Obama signs along U.S. 31, a major thoroughfare. As drivers cruised by, a number of them rolled down their windows and yelled out a common racial slur for African Americans, according to Obama campaign staffers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Vandalism, bomb threats</b></p>
<p>The bigotry has gone beyond words. In Vincennes, the Obama campaign office was vandalized at 2 a.m. on the eve of the primary, according to police. A large plate-glass window was smashed, an American flag stolen. Other windows were spray-painted with references to Obama&rsquo;s controversial former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, and other political messages: &#8220;Hamas votes BHO&#8221; and &#8220;We don&rsquo;t cling to guns or religion. Goddamn Wright.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama has not spoken much about racism during this campaign. He has sought to emphasize connections among Americans rather than divisions. He shrugged off safety concerns that led to early Secret Service protection and has told black senior citizens who worry that racists will do him harm: Don&rsquo;t fret. Earlier in the campaign, a 68-year-old woman in Carson City, Nev., voiced concern that the country was not ready to elect an African American president.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will there be some folks who probably won&rsquo;t vote for me because I am black? Of course,&#8221; Obama said, &#8220;just like there may be somebody who won&rsquo;t vote for Hillary because she&rsquo;s a woman or wouldn&rsquo;t vote for John Edwards because they don&rsquo;t like his accent. But the question is, &lsquo;Can we get a majority of the American people to give us a fair hearing?&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Skilled at bridging divides</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For the most part, Obama campaign workers say, the 2008 election cycle has been exhilarating. On the ground, the Obama campaign is being driven by youngsters, many of whom are imbued with an optimism undeterred by racial intolerance. &#8220;We&rsquo;ve grown up in a different world,&#8221; says Danielle Ross. Field offices are staffed by 20-somethings who hold positions &mdash; state director, regional field director, field organizer &mdash; that are typically off limits to newcomers to presidential politics.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a letter to the editor published in a local paper, Tunkhannock Borough Mayor Norm Ball explained his support of Hillary Clinton this way: &#8220;Barack Hussein Obama and all of his talk will do nothing for our country. There is so much that people don&rsquo;t know about his upbringing in the Muslim world. His stepfather was a radical Muslim and the ranting of his minister against the white America, you can&rsquo;t convince me that some of that didn&rsquo;t rub off on him.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I want a president that will salute our flag, and put their hand on the Bible when they take the oath of office.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Racial attitudes difficult to measure</b></p>
<p>Pollsters have found it difficult to accurately measure racial attitudes, as some voters are unwilling to acknowledge the role that race plays in their thinking. But some are not. Susan Dzimian, a Clinton supporter who owns residential properties, said outside a polling location in Kokomo that race was a factor in how she viewed Obama. &#8220;I think if it was somebody other than him, I&rsquo;d accept it,&#8221; she said of a black candidate. &#8220;If Colin Powell had run, I would be willing to accept him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The previous evening, Dondra Ewing was driving the neighborhoods of Kokomo, looking to turn around voters like Dzimian. Ewing, 47, is a chain-smoking middle school guidance counselor, a black single mother of two and one of the most fiercely vigilant Obama volunteers in Kokomo, which was once a Ku Klux Klan stronghold. On July 4, 1923, Kokomo hosted the largest Klan gathering in history &mdash; an estimated 200,000 followers flocked to a local park. But these are not the 1920s, and Ewing believes she can persuade anybody to back Obama. Her mother, after all, was the first African American elected at-large to the school board in a community that is 10 percent black.</p>

			<p>This article makes it sound like there are a lot of racially conscious whites out there after all.  Whites that have had experience with blacks and prefer not to be near them.  I&rsquo;ll admit it, this is a rare &#8216;feel good&rsquo; article among a slew of mostly depressing ones.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to meet Danielle Ross in about 30 years and see if she still views blacks in a positive light.  We here on Amren all know the answer.  Her opinion will probably change in less than 10.<br>

<p>Nothing like good old fashion common sense to wake people up. If our roles were switched and blacks were the majority, a White presidential candidate would never see the light of day.</p>

I believe this person is paraphraseing Napoleon Bonaparte.I would love to ask one of these Obama supporters why as a voter he should not support David Duke for president.It is clear to me that Barack Obama hates america and hates white people.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Obama has not spoken much about racism during this campaign.&#8221;</p>
<p>What has this clown been smoking?</p>
<p>How about Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;typical White person&#8221; grandmother?<br>
How about the rantings of his simian wife?<br>
How about 20 years of silence in front of his hateful preacher?<br>
And how about all the passages from his two &#8220;books&#8221; that relate to his harrassment of Whites?</p>
<p>Oh no, he&rsquo;s not about racism at all.  And he&rsquo;s had more than enough of a &#8220;fair hearing&#8221;.  </p>
<p>The verdict is in: Barry Obama and his wife are ultra-lib, socialist, race baiters.  Those White people who haven&rsquo;t gotten the message by now never will.</p>

			<p>I think this article is a typical hit piece served up by this liberal rag. First off I think in a divisive campaign you will always find hatred directed at political candidates. Second, imagine if the reporter class followed Mccain supporters or any white Republican candidate working an inner city neighborhood. Words would be the least of the troubles.</p>
<p>Also this race does spotlight race. How come an Afro colleague of mine can post a big Vote Obama placard on her work desk? </p>

			<p>This racial double-standard will never, ever end. Even when the day comes that white Americans are but a small minority of the population, if they dare pipe-up and bemoan their staggering disposition and fall from grace, they will immediately be denounced as so many filthy bigots!  </p>

			<p>Rural Pennsylvania is a hotbed of white racism, according to WaPo.  I&rsquo;m not buying.  These people get 99% of their exposure to blacks from television.  On television, blacks are uber-competent, -benign, Earthy, brilliant, noble doctors, lawyers, and scientists.  At worst they&rsquo;re victims of whitey.  The average rural Pennsylvanian is probably as anti-black as Oprah.</p>
<p>My mother&rsquo;s kin all live in the Susquehanna region.  In my youth we visited them every summer to escape the Georgia heat.  The first time they came down to see us instead, they were exposed to the antics of large numbers of typical blacks for the first time.  We were in Wal-Mart or K-Mart or something, and the looks on their faces were priceless.  They looked like the first Pennsylvanians on the Moon.  They stared (while trying not to seem to stare) agog at the antics of blacks shouting to one another across the store while walking backwards obesely, shucking and jiving, singing loudly, etc.  No frowns or looks of disgust (I think television had taught them better), just wide-eyed wonder; who were these creatures?  Television hadn&rsquo;t prepared them for flora and fauna of this Wild Kingdom.</p>
<p>I have no reason to think my ill-prepared northern kin were exceptional in their racial mores; their naivete is reflected in racially ignorant/neutered whites everywhere.</p>

			<p>We will go down the wrong path if Obama is elected.  A poster wrote on these pages a few months ago that America is being re-evaluated by other countries, and I think that poster is absolutely correct.  Obama will do nothing to improve our standing abroad. </p>

			<p>Danielle Ross: &#8220;People just weren&rsquo;t receptive.&#8221;</p>
<p>What weren&rsquo;t they receptive to? The indoctrinated fantasy world that you live in? It&rsquo;s called a college education for those of you who haven&rsquo;t noticed.</p>
<p>&hellip;You know, I&rsquo;ll admit it, the &#8220;I heard he&rsquo;s a Muslim&#8221; crowd aren&rsquo;t exactly the kind of people I&rsquo;d like to have dinner with (unless I felt like boring myself to death), but they are still 1000x more appealing to me than this brainwashed twit.</p>

			<p>This tripe is so one-sided I couldn&rsquo;t stand to read beyond a few paragraphs.</p>
<p>92% of blacks vote for Obama; he belongs to one of the most racist churches in the country, and has numerous anti-white black friends and acquaintenances; he was a racist community organizer that employed racist, underhanded tactics typical of anti-American activists, and he has given every indication that he wants the power of the presidency solely for the purpose of instituting a pro-black agenda based in a socialistic structure of government, yet this dork from the Washington Post can see nothing but white racism on the landscape.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beyond bizarre, and it is a sad testament to the degeneration that has taken place in the MSM.</p>

			<p>Many years ago, I briefly had a job driving a taxi.  My friends assured me that I&rsquo;d hear lots of conversations about sex, because people needed to talk about the things they were afraid to share publicly.  My friends were right, to a point.  People do need to talk about the things on their mind, and will turn to a stranger if the things on their mind are taboo.  But I heard no sex talk, the secrets I heard were about race.  If I controlled the media, I could reverse this nation&rsquo;s course in a few months.  As soon as people realized that it was OK to be pro-White, their true feelings would come out, and no politician could stand before the deluge of animosity towards the invaders and their supporters.  </p>

			<p>Whites  vote 60-40 for Clinton = ugly racism</p>
<p>Blacks vote 92-8 for Obama = if you notice than that means you are a racist.</p>
<p>Typical double standard. Same old racism.</p>
<p>Oh, and notice how the vandalism that the Obama headquarters allegedly experienced is assumed by the media to have been done by whites and not by black racist hoaxers.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;a horrible response,&rdquo; as Ross put it, a level of anti-black sentiment that none of them had anticipated.</p>
<p>Not a horrible response, just one that Ross either didn&rsquo;t agree with or didn&rsquo;t want to hear.  Don&rsquo;t you just hate it when people have a  opinion different than yours? </p>
<p>Documentary filmmaker Rory Kennedy, the daughter of the late Robert F. Kennedy, said she, too, came across &ldquo;a lot of racism&rdquo; when campaigning for Obama in Pennsylvania</p>
<p>Those Kennedy apples never fall far from the liberal tree. I don&rsquo;t know where these folks experiencing all of this racism have really been. The media shows white folks falling all over themselves to support the candidate with the mouthy minister.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s important for whites to not deny that voting against Obama is racist.  Racism is normal and right.  Racism is healthy.  All other races are extremely racist and most are violent and evil.  Whites need to wake up to these facts if we want any hope of not becoming victims of racists voting for Obama.</p>
<p>Put another way.  Racist whites will keep Obama out of office to make sure our country is still fair and just.  While racist blacks will try to put Obama into office so that they can steal from and dominate whites.</p>
<p>This is an extremely important distinction.  Racism is normal for all races.  But whites are good.  Other races, especially blacks and most mexicans who have invaded our country are extremely evil and malevolent.  It&rsquo;s not their racism that is bad.  It&rsquo;s what they plan to do with it.  White racism is NOT bad.  It&rsquo;s not bad because whites are good.</p>
<p>It really is as simple as that.  The problem is, many whites are ignorant.  They think white racism is an excuse to engage in evil behaviors.  That is a vile lie.  One white people need to vigorously defend against.</p>

And they&rsquo;ve endured malicious rants and ugly stereotyping from people who can&rsquo;t fathom that the senator from Illinois could become the first African American president.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sky is falling, the sky is falling, &ldquo;racism&rdquo; by the white &ldquo;troglodytes&rdquo; might stop the election of Comrade Obama the Omniscient and the creation of the Utopian Sultanates of Audacity. </p>
<p>That is after all, what is motivating these white fools who support him with a such a blazing cultic fervor. Why shouldn&rsquo;t they, it is to them the logical extension of the &ldquo;different world&rdquo; that some of us have been forced to endure, but they willingly embrace with a mindless mania that is normally experienced only through either kaleidoscopic drug induced epiphanies, or the spasmodic phantasmagorias of a florid  psychosis. </p>
<p>These are nevertheless, also his little army of lily white &ldquo;20-something&rdquo;  brown ponchos and their aging, Red beret sporting, countercultural misfit predecessors who we are talking about here. People, who think it is &ldquo;revolutionary&rdquo; to read a &ldquo;biography&rdquo; about Saint Che while sipping a caramel cinnamon marshmallow latté in a Starbucks. Indeed, these are the: tolerant, hopeful, and effusively changeable, squirt troopers of diversity&rsquo;s vanguard.</p>
<p>So what else is really expected of these &ldquo;fearsome&rdquo; warriors of  our eerie zeitgeist?</p>
<p>Exactly what is detailed above, denunciations of &ldquo;racism&rdquo; and &ldquo;hate&rdquo; when any gauche white Kulak or uncouth petite bourgeois taxpayer, has the unmitigated gall to question: &lsquo;just what is the hoped for &ldquo;change&rdquo; going to involve?&rsquo;</p>
<p>When cotton candy platitudes and saccharine sermons don&rsquo;t cut it in response, it has to be the &ldquo;ossified bigotry&rdquo; and &ldquo;deranged prejudices&rdquo; of these whites that is at the &ldquo;root rot&rdquo; of the &ldquo;utopia&rdquo; hopefully lost!</p>
<p>As always, God (not a demigod) help us all!</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;d like to believe that there are alot of racially conscious Whites out there but I have doubts.  I heard on talk radio last month that the Obama campaign would use White guilt as a means of getting Whites to vote for him.  If it&rsquo;s true then the establishment has swallowed its own kool-aid if they think this weak strategy will work.</p>

Yes, Obama, there will. But not nearly as many as WILL vote for you for that same reason. </p>
<p>And you well know it, my half-white, &#8220;black-identified&#8221; friend. </p>
<p>Indeed, your entire candidacy is predicated upon this cynical, white-guilt-exploiting equation. This and precious little else. <br>

<p>I would offer all readers this suggestion. We need to STOP OBAMA! Not because he is Black but because he would do more damage to our Nation in four years of his inept, incompetent and inexperienced administration than Jimmy Carter did during his four-year debacle!</p>
<p>Put this on ALL your e-mails&hellip;</p>
<p>SAVE OUR AMERICA&hellip; STOP THE OBAMINATION!</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s been my experience exactly in talking to white people in private or in a low voice in public. Most are close to the views of the people on this site and many are right on.  The difference is, unlike us activists, most whites go along to get along.  Make no mistake about it, though, if the situation gets out-of-hand or if a particularly explosive situation were to develope, whites would unite once again.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s going to take something pretty drastic to get them up in arms.</p>

			<p>Voters are very apprehensive about putting a black man in the White House.  As we have always seen, black people vote in a bloc fashion and the chances are that a black president would continue to assert the black agenda.  Concentrating on a black agenda would be desastrous to our county when so many life and death issues should control.  Blacks make up a relative small percentage of the population and a black president as the helm, with the overwhelming attitude of &#8220;victimhood&#8221; obviously  give pause to most white voters.  Not only are the blacks very hositle to whites but Barak&rsquo;s wife, Michelle, seems &#8220;extremely&#8221; hostile to whites.  The &#8220;race&#8221; issue should NOT control the agenda in this very hostile world. </p>

			<p>&#8220;If our roles were switched and blacks were the majority, a White presidential candidate would never see the light of day.&#8221;</p>
<p>I disagree with that statement. Gone are the days when the white minority was simply killed or driven off - at least for nations if not for cities and area&rsquo;s. White, half-white and Asian politicians probably do better than they should in black majority countries today. However, I do find it hard to believe a black majority America would be more pleasant toward rank and file whites than it is now - and that&rsquo;s not very pleasant. </p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s exactly because too many Americans, and everyone else for that matter, can not, do not, or will not, talk about Family that we get all of this talk about Race, and all of this crazy, non-stop, Shaming Parent behavior from the mouthpiece of the Power Elite, the MSM.</p>
<p>Obama is not just an excellent example of this, he is THE example.  He is the center of attention BECAUSE he&rsquo;s Black; actually, half Black.  He therefore is the living embodiment of RACIAL harmony.  But the harmony lasted about as long as it took for his biological parents to MAKE Obama.  I don&rsquo;t wish to be crude.  In fact, the opposite.  Obama is the product of a BROKEN HOME!!!!!!! And his supporters can hide their head in the sand and refuse to talk about it, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t know all there is to know about the devestating effects of abandonment. And happily, the information we have is high in both quantity and quality. But it&rsquo;s gathering dust, thanks to, well, just about everybody.  <br>
I know first hand about it and am happy to share it. I have suffered from its effects but fortunately hit bottom and got help and have since gone on to help others.  I have a good life today as a result.  Make no mistake about it folks, Obama represents the bottom we&rsquo;re going to hit as a result of turning our back on Reality for too long.  He is the straw about to break the camels back.  Of that I have no doubt.<br>
Abandonment IS abuse and neglect (we&rsquo;re not talking about physical abuse in his case). It leads to, Dependency, Non-logical, Egocentric and Magical thinking; the Development of a False Self to conceal the intense psychological and emotional rupture resulting from abandonment (which explains Americas fascination with Celebrity, and the relation between Celebrities and Politicians). Fort Knox-type Ego-defenses (as witnessed in this article, ie; agree with us, love Obama, or else, because if not I&rsquo;ll just die; Don&rsquo;t abandon me). It is virtually the blueprint of all dysfunctional families, like mine, Obamas, the Kennedys, Clintons, Bushes, and millions of other, and probably yours. <br>
But for our purposes now, above all, it leads to a Fantasy Bond with ANYTHING that gives you the ILLUSION of connectedness. Or, &#8220;Obama is our only hope.&#8221;</p>
<p>From this perspective Obama is the crowning acheivement of Codependency&rsquo;s, for now, all-encomposing victory over the hearts and minds of Americans, and not just America.  Virtually EVERYTHING happening around Obama now fits with perfect exactness to any thorough study on Codependency.  But don&rsquo;t take me word for it, see for yourself.</p>

They run back to their gated compounds, their chalets in Aspen, their walled Palm Beach estates, their Eastside Condos with guards out side the entrance.

			<p>I think White realists who oppose Obama are short-sighted.  What is the alternative&hellip;McCain?  All a John McCain presidency will do is guarantee more of the same, giving complacent Whites an excuse to continue to back the GOP because they supposedly represent the lesser of two evils.  Meanwhile, the country will continue to deteriorate as the illegals pour in and what is left of our culture fades into oblivion.</p>
<p>An Obama presidency would at least provide a glimmer of hope for an awakening of overt White racial consciousness, which is essential to the salvation of this country if it is ever to come.  That awakening isn&rsquo;t guaranteed by any means, and the chances of Obama coming right out of the gate to stomp the White man are slim.  But the blacks who voted for Obama en masse will feel a sense of entitlement like never before, and eventually he will have to pay them notice.  If nothing else, this will help decide once and for all if the White man ever has any intention of fighting for this country.  </p>
<p>If the words of the Patriots who founded the United States mean anything to us today, we should wish to confront our fate now, while there is still some semblence of our nation and our culture left.  If we drag on for another 20 or 30 years just electing the White guy, however loathsome and treasonous he may be, all we will do is fall farther behind in the demographic and political battle to take control of the future.  If, on the other hand, we are willing to confront the worst possible scenario now, there may be enough of a latent White resistance to form a potent political force.</p>
<p>To summarize, we either continue our current trajectory to ruin, or something politically or economically huge happens to push us off course.  An Obama presidency could provide that push.  A McCain presidency will not.<br>

			<p>&#8220;Rural Pennsylvania is a hotbed of white racism, according to WaPo. I&rsquo;m not buying. These people get 99% of their exposure to blacks from television. On television, blacks are uber-competent, -benign, Earthy, brilliant, noble doctors, lawyers, and scientists. At worst they&rsquo;re victims of whitey. The average rural Pennsylvanian is probably as anti-black as Oprah&#8221;</p>
<p>My relatives get a steady feed of Black crime from all areas of PA by way of local news cable fed into the rural areas. I doubt these people are that gullible to buy the &#8220;Hollywood&#8221; Black image.</p>

			<p>Obama&rsquo;s candidacy is quite hypocritical.  He aligned himself with racists and his compaigners are shocked at the anger and racism they are encountering.  But if Colin Powell was running for President I doubt his campaign would arouse so much anger and racism.  Colin Powell could actually win the nominations and be President.  </p>

<p>Though I didn&rsquo;t campaign for Ron Paul and I do regret not doing so. In my area I encountered the exact same sort of responses from white libersls in my area.  They know fully well that Ron Paul is not a &#8220;progressive&#8221; communist.  That is what the &#8220;progressive&#8221; agenda is all about. <br>
It&rsquo;s about progressively growing and changing the state to the point that it controls all aspects of our lives.  Most people truly have difficulty grasping the very concept of progressive.  That&rsquo;s why it is so much easier to take freedoms away in a piecemeal  fashion bit by bit than all at once.  I will add that I have decided to become involoved in my local and state <br>
Libertarian party.  I admittedly have been very pessimistic about a political solution to the utter and vast corruption that plagues us but I think it would be a good start. </p>

			<p>Though I do not share his views, I can see the advantages of voting for Obama. But it&rsquo;s definitely a gamble, that&rsquo;s for sure.  </p>
<p>My bet is that the media will cover up every fumble an Obama presidency would make.  And any nasty legislation or political push Obama makes at Euro-American expense would be done so in the dark. </p>
<p>The other thing is, Obama might push European countries around, and actually enjoy a presidency where stuff seemed to go overall well, thus those conditions would be attributed to him, much like the Clinton years. At least with McCain, you can pretty much bet he&rsquo;ll only run once.</p>

<p>It is an interesting idea - to vote for Obama in hopes that his tenure will cause the &#8220;revolution&#8221; to begin.  This idea that white people will actually put down the potato chip bag, turn off their televisions, get up from their couches, leave their computer monitors and become a viable revolutionary movement somehow seems remote.  That is the problem, historically, it requires extreme abuses over a long period to cause a real revolution.  I&rsquo;am not saying that it won&rsquo;t happen and that I don&rsquo;t want it to happen.  But I wonder how the real thing would unfold and where the leadership would arise from.  So far, I have only seen members of the American Nazi Party willing to face the public and declare themselves.  They never get anywhere, too many whites find them repugnant regardless of any feelings they may habor concerning the need for white survival.</p>
<p>The other risk of voting in Borak Obama is that the much heralded damage that he is set to reek on the nation may not materialize.  He might have a moderately successful presidency. After all, people have put up with eight years of incredible corruption, lying and mismanagement in our leadership.  That would likely put a dead stop to just about all cries of White Nationalism.</p>
<p>Being proven wrong on something this basic ought to worry us all.  What a tightrope we are walking!</p>

If Obama gets the Democratic nomination, it&rsquo;s a lose/ lose proposition. If he beats McCain, we lose because, well&hellip;then he would be the president. If he loses, we also lose due to the inevitable RIOTS. Self-defense, my friends. Don&rsquo;t wait until tomorrow to prepare, start this second.</p>

In addition, a McCain presidency will render amnesty a done deal, since many Republicans will give him a &#8220;honeymoon period&#8221; and support his proposals, even if they are leftist in nature.  </p>

And he&rsquo;s talkin&rsquo; about Pop Music!  Do you think the elections today are an accident. I&rsquo;ll tell ya, the Obama thing worries me, ok, scares me sometimes. Because I think there is NO conincidence that our choices are an old White man and a young half-white man. <br>
They rigged the elections for Bush, because he was their guy for that moment.  Now they will for Obama, though don&rsquo;t expect the Left/Liberal/Neocons to say a word about it.<br>
And it&rsquo;s pretty obvious and they just don&rsquo;t care. The next President will probably be Hispanic. <br>
The message from the Power Elite could not be any clearer.  &#8220;You aren&rsquo;t wanted anymore&#8221;.  I mean, how much more evidence do we need? <br>
The sad thing is, this is all possible because we didnt seem to care about each other.  But things might turn around. I don&rsquo;t know, stranger things have happened in History.

 Clinton took no chances, played Spin Doctor constantly and avoided decisions&hellip;all on the long road to 9-11. Bush did nothing for 8 years but the War on Terror. He did nothing about <br>
Housing Crises, Energy Crises, Global Warming&hellip;nothing<br>

The pols pay attention to numbers, they may make public statements and tsk- tsk this or that, but if they think the voters will really raise hell; laws get bottled up in committees and we need more study on this issue. Vote against Obama and his supporters. Vote against the Obama wantabees. Remember, in the absence of federal law; state and local laws apply. Pass laws to stop as much of the coming socialism of a Obama adminstration. Build and exercise our political power at every level and were ever we can. Repete as needed.</p>
