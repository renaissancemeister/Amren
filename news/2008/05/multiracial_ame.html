<h1><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24542138/">Multiracial Americans Surge in Number, Voice</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mike Stuckey, MSNBC, May 28, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the same time that the nation&rsquo;s growing diversity and changing social attitudes are helping to swell the ranks of multiracial Americans at 10 times the rate of the white population, the presidential candidacy of Barack Obama, son of a black man and a white woman, has brought new attention, curiosity and discussion to their experiences.</p>
<p>Obama has faced an endless barrage of questions anchored to issues of race and class, from his ties to the Rev. Jeremiah Wright to whether, in his own words, he is &#8220;too black&#8221; or &#8220;not black enough.&#8221; As Gut Check America engaged msnbc.com readers in this re-emerging national conversation on race, it became clear that multiracial Americans offered unique perspectives on the topic and that the nation is far from entering a &#8220;post-race&#8221; era.</p>
<p>[Mike] Gong, 33, is on the leading edge of what he calls the &#8220;modern multiracial movement.&#8221; A founder of the Mixed Heritage Center, a Web-based resource collection for multiracial Americans, Gong is also vice president and a key spokesman for the Mavin Foundation, a Seattle-based advocacy group for mixed-race people and families. As the educational resources director for the Muckleshoot Indian tribe&rsquo;s college near Seattle, he is able to tailor programs to Native Americans of mixed heritage. He teaches classes and workshops on the topic and is helping prepare a museum exhibit on the mixed-race experience set to open in Seattle in the fall.</p>
<p><b>Obama candidacy drives new interest</b></p>
<p>As Gong&rsquo;s schedule attests, it&rsquo;s a busy, exciting time for folks who have worked for years to win understanding and acceptance of the unique path trod by multiracial Americans. &#8220;Barack Obama has stepped into the picture now and is shining a floodlight on these issues,&#8221; Gong told msnbc.com.</p>
<p>With interracial marriage illegal in 16 states until 1967 and racist sentiments against it remaining to this day in some places, the number of biracial and multiracial Americans is relatively small at less than 5 million. Although it includes a number of high-profile celebrities and athletes like Tiger Woods, Mariah Carey, Derek Jeter, Vin Diesel and Halle Berry, it&rsquo;s well under 2 percent of the nation&rsquo;s current 302 million residents.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s kind of a lot of hype that makes people think there&rsquo;s more, but there aren&rsquo;t,&#8221; said demographer William H. Frey, a senior fellow with the Brookings Institution.</p>
<p>Officially, the number was even a mystery until 2000, the first year the U.S. Census Bureau allowed Americans to say they were of mixed race.</p>
<p><b>Census counts vary</b></p>
<p>Even now, there is confusion over various tallies offered by the federal agency. Some surveys, including the 2000 Census, allow respondents to choose &#8220;some other race&#8221; in addition to every possible combination of all recognized races. That inflated the count of multiracial Americans to 6.8 million.</p>
<p>But the agency&rsquo;s annual Population Estimate Program, considered its most current breakdown, does not include &#8220;some other race&#8221; and results in a count of Americans who claim to be of &#8220;two or more races.&#8221; Based on birth, death and tax records, the figure &#8220;really is our official estimate of total population and population by race,&#8221; said Census spokesman Robert Burnstein.</p>
<p>The most recent data, released May 1, shows the number of Americans of &#8220;two or more races&#8221; was 4,856,136 as of last July. The headline, though, is growth. Up from 4,711,932 the previous year, the tally indicates a 3 percent gain, which is 10 times the 0.3 percent growth of the white population in the same period and three times the overall U.S. population growth of about 1 percent. It&rsquo;s about the same as the growth rates of the Hispanic and Asian populations.</p>
<p>America&rsquo;s mixed-race population is up 25 percent since it was first calculated in 2000, while the nation&rsquo;s overall population has grown 7 percent in that time. Although still small in real numbers, the multiracial category is larger that the combined total of Native American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders.</p>
<p><b>One thing in common: marginalization</b></p>
<p>Such statistical exercises bring a warning from Gong.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The only thing that bonds us together as a group is the common ways that we&rsquo;re marginalized,&#8221; said Gong, who himself &#8220;had a very dynamic experience with race&#8221; while growing up. Reared on tribal lands by his paternal Chinese grandfather and Nooksack grandmother, his home life was steeped in Native American culture and tradition. At school, &#8220;I was poked and prodded&#8221; into a more Asian identity because of his last name.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Despite their growing numbers, multiracial Americans and their family members say society&rsquo;s response to them often remains a mixture of ignorance, judgment and downright rudeness.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Confusion over racial identity a common issue</b></p>
<p>For many, the confusion of others over their racial identity is the biggest, and thorniest, issue.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Non-mixed members of multiracial families face their own special struggles. &#8220;When you&rsquo;re in a biracial family, you have a choice to be white or not,&#8221; said Mary Semela, a white mom of two biracial sons who is married to a black immigrant from South Africa. Semela, who lives in Ellicott City, Md., said some members of multiracial families can grow so weary of stares and questions when they are with their relatives of different colors that they&rsquo;ll intentionally go to public places alone at times. &#8220;You have that choice just to walk away from your family,&#8221; she said, adding that she would not do so herself.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Despite that, her older son, 20, a scholarship student at Colgate, &#8220;feels very anchored as an African-American,&#8221; which is in keeping with the view of Semela and many other American parents of biracial black and white children that &#8220;as soon as your kids are old enough, they are black people in America, they are not half of anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>New resources, support seen</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A tricky issue for organizers like Gong is apprehension among some leaders of minority communities that a new focus on multiracial identities could lessen their numbers.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we look at what was important for communities of color during the civil rights movement, it was solidarity,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Solidarity served African-Americans and Native Americans very well in the past so now we see a desire to maintain ethnic solidarity still playing out, especially among older folks. We&rsquo;re worried that we&rsquo;re going to dilute the voice we have if people identify as being black and white or Native American and black.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Inspiration drawn from Obama candidacy</b></p>
<p>But Americans from multiracial backgrounds and families (some 5 million Americans are married across racial lines and millions more are members of racially blended families) seem universally happy and proud that a biracial man is the front-runner for a major party&rsquo;s presidential nomination. Over and over again, in e-mail and interviews, regardless of whether they agree with his politics or intend to vote for him, &#8220;Gut Check&#8221; respondents said they were heartened by Obama&rsquo;s candidacy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Despite the positive feelings from the Obama candidacy and other strides, ambiguity and confusion over racial identity will persist for many mixed-race Americans, said Gong, a fact experienced even in families such as his own that have been multiracial for generations. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Mixed race isn&rsquo;t post race. It&rsquo;s not less race. It&rsquo;s more race,&#8221; Gong said. &#8220;In order to dialog about mixed race, we need more understanding. It&rsquo;s not a dialog to forget about issues of race.&#8221;<br>

			<p>I&rsquo;m predicting that in the not too distant future &#8220;mixed race&#8221; will be considered aside and apart from any race the individual might favor in order to be more accurate, and will be a category all its own on various government, employment, and census forms, and there will be rules governing the inclusion into that group.</p>
<p>After all, who could legitimately call mulattoes, who have light skin and straight hair, blacks and really be accurate?  As much as Obama, Haille Berry and others want to give the impression of being black, they just don&rsquo;t measure up to the average black in many ways.  </p>
<p>A black/white mating usually still has the kinky haired offspring, but that offspring pairing with a white, most likely will have straight haired children with anywhere from a light tan to a white complexion and certainly Caucasian features.  There are exceptions. Further pairings with whites will mean even whiter-looking children.</p>
<p>Look at O.J. Simpson&rsquo;s kids.  They&rsquo;re mulattoes, with a light skinned black father who has obviously white blood too, but their hair is straight and they are light skinned with mostly Cacausaian features.  If they marry whites, likely their offspring will look white. Likewise, Obamas kids seem to have straight hair and they do not look like conventional blacks, and they&rsquo;re just a fraction white.  One quarter, I believe.</p>
<p>My point is that nobody ever raises the possibility that it could well be blacks that are ethnically cleansed for all intents and purposes.  We hear a lot about how the white race is going to get &#8220;tanned&#8221; out of existence, but I believe it will be the smaller numbers of blacks, compared to whites, that will be &#8220;lightened&#8221; out of existence.  </p>
<p>Look at how just a few thousand Spanish conquistadors created so many white-looking people south of the border, many of whom look as white as any other European.  </p>

			<p>  If one had to sum up this long, rambling, opinionated MSNBC article, it might be like this: Miscegenation is wonderful! Barack Obama is wonderful! And won&rsquo;t it be wonderful when there is not one identifiably Caucasion person left in the U.S.A.?</p>

			<p>There&rsquo;s the only statistical trick of using percentages to represent something paltry as spreading like wildfire. The intention is to manipulate white women into thinking &#8216;hey, everybody is doing it, you should, too.&rsquo; The only thing white women gain from having biracial children is the joy of raising a kid with behavioral disorders alone.</p>

			<p>I suspect that for many black men, a white women is just a white trophy used for display purposes only&hellip; much like a white hunter mounting a deer-head on his wall. </p>
<p>For many white women, the attraction may be the &#8220;forbidden fruit&#8221; aspect and who eagerly flaunt their <i>liberal ideology</i> in a public fashion, as well.</p>

			<p>Being a mulatto will be the new trendy thing if Obama wins the Presidency. Just as multi-racial adoptions are now. I am at the point to where I pray God ends it all by any means necessary. We have become a &#8220;fallen&#8221; people to buy into this &#8220;tolerance&#8221; thing and everyone and every culture is equal,propaganda! I don&rsquo;t want to live in another Brazil!

<p>Well I know a number of multiracial people, including one woman whose father is Japaneese and Hawaiian and her mother is Native American and Black.</p>
<p>She identifies as Black. In fact a number of multi racial people who have Black blood in them acknowledge themselves as either Black or biracial. Rarely do they say they are White.  </p>

			<p>All blacks in the US are &#8216;multiracial&rsquo; to some extent.  They still seem to have a huge number of problems.</p>
<p>However, whites and North-Asians are quite compatible and produce very able offspring.  Because we are both civilized and intelligent races, we get along well, and most Asians who are immigrants recognize the value of Western ideals or they would not be here.  In fact, I think that most want to be &#8216;American&rsquo; and leave their stifling confucian cultures behind to a large extent, especially if they grew up here.</p>
<p>I know of many mixed white-Asian kids in my area and I think at some point, white Americans will really accept Asians as at least their equals in ability.  I foresee the big gap being between whites and Asians on the one hand and blacks and hispanics/indigenous peoples on the other.  Whites, Asians, and their offspring will be successful and civilized while the rest will continue to struggle with violence and poverty&hellip;</p>

			<p>You belong to whatever race you look most like. I saw a piece on television the other day about a very white looking biracial lady who was married to a black man. She was horribly abused for many many years and finally got away. It struck me that he made her call him &#8220;master&#8221; when she talked to him on the telephone.

			<p>10 times to 1? In war, or even in political persuasion, a ratio of that nature would be considered big news. With Multiracial population growth alone 10 times greater than that of whites (and who knows how much greater the black, hispanic and asian rate) all this guy can do is talk about racism committed by whites? I have a hard time imagining a newspaper taking such a tack - outside of a german paper reporting during nazi germany.</p>

Don&rsquo;t bother us and try to infect your pro-miscegenation points of view here. Your relatives are a part of the problem, especially when Whites do not reproduce above the fertility rate. There are more than enough brown people(and mixed people in general) in the world to prove the point that races must not reproduce with each other. The half-Chinese person has clearly has had his genetic makeup ruined whether you see it or not. If you reproduce(which you hopefully will not), you will see it in front of your eyes. By the way, if we are totally wrong, why do the most mixed nations(brown ones) have cultures and civilization that collapse and stagnate for thousands of years? Oriental women who whore themselves out to White men are just as much to blame for this problem, since women pick the mates. The person who can find it in their heart for their niece to be nice, should not find it in his heart to be nice to the parents that gave birth to a mixed child. If Whites do not ostracize and push out people who racially-mix for their lives, Whites will live worse lives and probably be reduced to a point where they can never come back as a people.</p>

			<p>At this point, I am convinced that every mixed-race person in America is offered an open Hollywood contract to appear on television at birth. At least every third person you see on the tv is some type of mixed-race offspring, and clearly the favored blending &#8220;ingredient&#8221; is a black one! Add this to the astonishing number of proper Blacks and an ever increasing dose of Hispanics, Asians, etc., and one would conclude from television that America were already at least 80% non-white. </p>

			<p>As admirable as Gaurav Ahuja&rsquo;s concern for the white race is (especially for a person of Indian descent), I wonder if such a harsh response is the most effective way to counsel against miscegenation.  </p>
<p>Surely a better approach would be to remind people of the positive reasons for marrying within their race.  White racial consciousness is very much a taboo outlook at the present time, so a moderate approach to the issues relevant to white people is all important.  Demonising people in mixed relationships as &#8216;whores&rsquo; and wishing sterility upon their children sadly reinforces the mass media&rsquo;s association of white nationalism with &#8216;extremism&rsquo;. You could deliver the same message simply by emphasising that people should marry within their race in order to preserve their heritage and to avoid the risk of their children either having a conflicted identity or actively rejecting their whiteness in favour of their ethnic side.  </p>
<p>In this particular case, I say good for James for unashamedly identifying with the white side of his heritage.  He ought to be encouraged rather than be told that he&rsquo;s faulty goods.</p>
<p>PS. I believe that it&rsquo;s a popular line among Jews who are involved in combatting their high rates of intermarriage that &#8216;you catch more flies with honey and vinegar&rsquo;.  So don&rsquo;t take my word for it - listen to the experts!</p>

<p>In order to get used to your niece, you had to consciously and actively override your normal, natural, and healthy mental processes. Your initial repugnance is what is normal, natural, and healthy. What you are describing is self-brainwashing.</p>
<p>No matter how much you try to convince yourself how beautify and wonderful your niece is, you&rsquo;re always going to have the normal, natural, and healthy part of your brain telling you in your deepest subconscious that your mixed race niece isn&rsquo;t as beautiful as you want to convince yourself she is.</p>

The concept of whiteness is very much diluted in the USA, many american &#8220;whites&#8221; would be surprised if they knew they would not be considered whites but rather brown darkies in Europe. Since white personality traits and mental abilities seems to be mostly governed by recessive genes, the european attitude is the only proper one. </p>

Now they want to be tan, hate their own colors and worship other races big butts, lips and dark colors.  Picking a spouse because they are exotic may provide them a thrill but the price will be paid in the next generation.

At the local school which is mostly white you see white moms with their non-white kids proudly pushing them around like they&rsquo;re some kind of trophy.  I would say it seems that mixed marriages/kids are around 20-30% of what you see here. On the flip side I do see lots of white families with 3 kids.</p>

			<p>My father came from Spain, and my mother was born in Honduras of  Catalan parents, hence I can trace my entire lineage back to Castille and Catalonia. The conquistadors left mainly a bunch of mestizos who are of neither race. Look at Latin America, and the only civilized nations you&rsquo;ll find (Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay)were nations built by whites. </p>
<p>Even the Cubans who came to Miami in &#8216;59 weren&rsquo;t multi-racial, but mainly individuals whose parents or grandparents came from Spain.  </p>
<p>Here are the dangers I&rsquo;ve seen of miscegenation in my family and my wife&rsquo;s:</p>
<p>In my family in Honduras, everyone decided to mix with an Indian, and now we&rsquo;ve got a bunch of little mestizos running around the place. Funny enough, my brother and I (and one cousin) are the only three to grow up in the US, and the only ones with white children!</p>
<p>My wife came from a pretty close-knit Irish-American family. I remember getting a lot of flack in the beginning because I wasn&rsquo;t Irish. However, if you look at my wife&rsquo;s three siblings, her two brothers married Jewesses, and her younger sister is marrying some Muslim guy from Afghanistan. Instead of getting together for X-mas they get together for the &#8216;Holidays&rsquo;. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sad but there&rsquo;s also a bit of poetic justice knowing that this Spaniard they were so cool about in the beginning is the only reason they have white, Christian grandchildren.</p>
<p>BTW: I get along fine with the relatives, but I only see them once in a blue moon &hellip; God save us all.</p>

<p>&gt; But if James here breeds with a white woman, a completely Chinese looking offspring can easily occur.  Even a lilly white person can carry a black gene if a grandparent were black and it is not expressed in their own look.  A mixed race baby is a possibility for anyone who is of mixed ancestry several generations on and rarer beyond.<br>

			<p>Mr. Gaurav Ahuja,</p>
<p>I am not trying to &#8220;infect&#8221; anyone with pro-miscegenation propaganda.  If anything, I am sympathetic to the racial preservationist perspective and believe Richard McCulloch to be the most insightful and ethical &#8220;White Nationalist&#8221; out there.  If I could have chosen my brother&rsquo;s spouse, I would have certainly picked a white wife as I believe the world is a better place with whites in it and wonder whether family reunions should look like United Nations conventions.  I hope no one on this site has to go through the soul searching and pain that I went through because of my brother&rsquo;s choices.  But I only have one brother and will not &#8220;ostracize&#8221; him because he doesn&rsquo;t value the existence of his race the same as I do.  Also, your name suggests you likely have mixed heritage.  Without miscegenation (Aryan and Dravidian) would your existence be possible?     <br>

			<p>&#8220;A black/white mating usually still has the kinky haired offspring, but that offspring pairing with a white, most likely will have straight haired children with anywhere from a light tan to a white complexion and certainly Caucasian features. There are exceptions. Further pairings with whites will mean even whiter-looking children.&#8221;</p>
<p>These watered down blacks are still not White and they don&rsquo;t look White.  You can water a black down until they look like gypsies but they don&rsquo;t belong to our race.</p>

			<p>&#8220;However, whites and North-Asians are quite compatible and produce very able offspring.&#8221;</p>
<p>With all due respect that is absolute lunacy.  Yes, the offspring may have a comparatively high intelligence, but with no loyalty to the white component. A nation comprised of mixed white-Asian will have a markedly different character, world outlook and racial loyalties than one composed primarily of unsullied European genes.</p>

			<p>It is neither necessary to  ostracize nor noble to celebrate those who mix.  Left to natural inclinations, most people won&rsquo;t; and those that do will not change the tides of history.  </p>
<p>I would hope that the powerful will not be cruel, but also that the deviant will not be held up as an ideal for some &#8220;new normality&#8221;.  One way shows man trying to control  other men, which offends freedom; the other shows man trying to usurp nature, which offends- well, nature.  </p>
<p>By the way, a certain measure of &#8220;deviance&#8221; is normal in any population.  Again, this  does not derail the population as a whole.</p>
<p>The far larger pressure on the white population comes from being forced to support the unproductive, who are disproportionally of other races, which simultaneously makes it easier for the supported ( &#8220;parasites&#8221; would be an appropriate term here) population to grow &amp; harder for the white population to grow, while also being inundated by non-white immigration. </p>
<p>It is policies such as these, apparently aimed at making America &#8220;look like&#8221; the rest of the world, that are suffocating the white population more than anything.  </p>
<p>Why the hell America, which is the greatest success story in history and the saviour &amp; guardian of freedom &amp; (relative) peace and stability in our era, as well as the vanguard of a way of life that has lifted tens of millions around the globe out of poverty and continues to add to the blessings of many millions of lives all the time, should need to or accept being driven down to the level of the rest of the world rather than encouraged and assisted to lead the way into a brighter future for all mankind- is a mystery to me. </p>
<p>By the way, I don&rsquo;t hate anybody &amp; I&rsquo;m not that worried about the white race, because I don&rsquo;t believe the media lies about our shortcomings &amp; imminent demise. We will meet our problems &amp; overcome them.  We will succeed, just as we always have. </p>
<p>Simply let every man have his freedom (with malice towards none),  and whites will lead the way, as we always have. </p>

The pure blacks will also disapear ( much earlier them the pure whites)<br>
The middle class are having only two kids, but at the bright side: <br>
The brightest, the very rich, are having 3, 4 or 5 kids. The brightest will not disapear and civilization will be preserved. <br>
The whites are disapearing. <br>
But look: <br>
The &#8220;latinos&#8221;, that are partially white, are reproducing at a fast rate them the blacks.<br>
And also: <br>
By sexual selection and miscigenation, after each generation the blacks will become whiter.<br>
The asiatic (5% of the population) will merge with the whites<br>
In the future the United States will be at least 50% mixed, and, as a consequence, there will be a strong argument against afirmative actions&hellip; <br>

<p>Blacks watered down through a process of inter-breeding do indeed look white.  But the point I was making in my post had nothing to do with that. It was for the purpose of pointing out that whites are constantly being intimidated with accusations that they are being watered out of existence. My point was to show that these same accusers have never considered that it is blacks and other non-whites that are more apt to be altered completely or eliminated altogether than whites, because their numbers are much smaller, when I wrote, &#8220;My point is that nobody ever raises the possibility that it could well be blacks that are ethnically cleansed for all intents and purposes. We hear a lot about how the white race is going to get &ldquo;tanned&rdquo; out of existence, but I believe it will be the smaller numbers of blacks, compared to whites, that will be &ldquo;lightened&rdquo; out of existence. </p>
<p>&#8220;Look at how just a few thousand Spanish conquistadors created so many white-looking people south of the border, many of whom look as white as any other European.&#8221;</p>

			<p>A bit of history:<br>
Up until the time of the Civil War, these were the racial classifications used:</p>
<p>mulatto  &mdash;   half black<br>
quadroon   &mdash;   one quarter bclack<br>
octoroon   &mdash;   one eighth black</p>
<p>The terms may seem quaint by our standards but were probably more accurate.</p>
<p>(I wonder how many &#8220;quadroons&#8221; or &#8220;octoroons&#8221; chose to pass for white.)</p>
<p>Not all states had one-drop statutes, and white mixed race marriages did occur some places (in fact I recall reading about a rench Creole man in New Orleans who married an &#8220;octoroon&#8221;  &mdash;   aparently being &#8220;7/8&#8221; White was an asset) but beginning in 1910, more and more states started to adopt one drop statutes, esp in the south.<br>

Since white personality traits and mental abilities seems to be mostly governed by recessive genes, the european attitude is the only proper one.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many White Americans would be considered &#8220;darkies&#8221; in Europe as a whole, as opposed to particular European countries (a lot of Italian- or Greek-Americans might be viewed that way in Iceland or Finland, for example). <br>
White Americans are no darker on average than Northern Europeans with similar sun exposure levels, and are lighter-skinned on average than Southern Europeans (not surprising, as White Americans are of primarily Northern European descent).<br>
Arabs and other Middle Eastern/North African people are only a small percentage (5% at most) of &#8220;White Americans&#8221; and (with the exception of Christian Arabs and Sephardi Jews) are considered White only by the Census Bureau. People with some Amerindian ancestry also make up a (larger) minority of White Americans, but even most White Nationalist groups allow members who are 1/8 or less Amerindian as long as they don&rsquo;t discuss it too much.<br>
And your statement that &#8220;white personality traits and mental abilities seems to be mostly governed by recessive genes&#8221; is a pretty sweeping assertion. Can you identify any of these traits and abilities that is unique to Whites AND the gene that causes it?</p>

<p>When was the last time the Chinese instigated an armed conflict with anyone?  During Jesus&rsquo; lifetime?  You are attributing, European warlike/dominate and destroy policies to a Taoist/Confucian society that values conflict negotiation over war.  Sorry folks, that&rsquo;s the way it is.

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying this because I&rsquo;m some sort of Sinophile, it&rsquo;s just the way history has shown it. It seems a lot of you are just itching to see a massacre of poor unarmed starving Africans, but if it happens it will probably be at the hands of each other.</p>

What will be the race of the daughter of Halle Berry,  since the father is almost nordic ? Belonging to the upper class and being white-looking will she consider herself black in the year 2028???  </p>

			<p>Some people are speculating that the future black population will amalgamate into extinction in America, but they seem to be uninformed about the fact that Blacks have the lowest rate of interracial cohabitation and reproduction in America.</p>

			<p>&#8220;We hear a lot about how the white race is going to get &ldquo;tanned&rdquo; out of existence, but I believe it will be the smaller numbers of blacks, compared to whites, that will be &ldquo;lightened&rdquo; out of existence.&#8221;</p>
<p>That means destroying our gene pool and ending up as quadroons.  People are already less intelligent and unhealthy looking than they were a generation ago and bad breeding is partially to blame.  Ever been to Brazil?  It&rsquo;s not a very pretty picture.  Besides, White/black pairings aren&rsquo;t all that common and there are probably more people working in the Sears Tower than there are White male/black female couples in the US.   <br>

<p>She must have paid a pretty penny for him.  Your operating under the assumption that race is an illusion, something that can be bestowed on someone like a title.  Class has nothing to do with race.  Race is a biological reality and having White skin doesn&rsquo;t mean that person is White.  There are plenty of White skinned Arabs/Berbers/North Africans/Asians but that doesn&rsquo;t make them White.  </p>

<p>Quadroons are one quarter African based.<br>
Octoroons are one eighth African based.<br>

<p>LOL.  Read your own source.  There are 80,000 White male/black female couples.</p>

			<p>A lower IQ mixed race populace is easy for A White racist guerilla force to fight. History shows the thing that defeats other White men is other White men. A mixed race Brazilian style military would be much dumber and disorganized. The US will also be much more unstable, like most of South America. Victory of racial seperatists is assured.<br>

			<p>My kids are half Korean and consider themselves Asian and (as far as I know) have no trouble with their mixed heritage.<br>
But I really want to comment on the attitude of the Korean American community about the election.  I have heard many times Koreans saying that &#8220;I&rsquo;ll move back to Korea if Obama wins.&#8221;  and &#8220;America should have a white president.&#8221;<br>
Also it is interesting to hear Koreans talking about a neighborhood and saying, &#8220;Walnut Creek (or another place) is mostly white, we want to move there.&#8221;<br>
I understand more of the Korean language than people think so I don&rsquo;t think these things are being said just for my benefit.</p>

<p>Actually there are about 10,000 people working in the Sears Tower.  A more accurate analogy would be that the University of Phoenix Stadium seats more people during a sporting event than there are White men married to a black woman.  There are 73,000 seats versus about 58,500 White men with a &#8220;sista&#8221;.  I don&rsquo;t know where your coming up with 234,000.  Maybe wishful thinking?   </p>

<p>The graph shows that there are 117,000 white husband- black wife parings that makes 117,000 white males and 117,000 black females.  </p>
<p>Including couples &#8220;dating&#8221;, cohabitating, engaged, and whatever else I would probably quadruple that which makes one hell of a football stadium.</p>

			<p> &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re in a biracial family, you have a choice to be white or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
- The fact that so few do choose to celebrate their white heritage, and instead fall overboard celebrating their non-white heritage shows who is actually being discriminated against in this day and age. People gravitate towards privileges, benefits and what they feel others will treat them positively for.</p>
