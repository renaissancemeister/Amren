<h1>Raza Studies Gives Rise to Racial Hostility</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Ward, Tucson Citizen, May 21, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As a former teacher in Tucson Unified School District&rsquo;s hotly debated ethnic studies department, I submit my perspective for the public&rsquo;s consideration.</p>
<p>During the 2002-2003 school year, I taught a U.S. history course with a Mexican-American perspective. The course was part of the Raza/Chicano studies department.</p>
<p>Within one week of the course beginning, I was told that I was a &#8220;teacher of record,&#8221; meaning that I was expected only to assign grades. The Raza studies department staff would teach the class.</p>
<p>I was assigned to be a &#8220;teacher of record&#8221; because some members of the Raza studies staff lacked teaching certificates. It was a convenient way of circumventing the rules.</p>
<p>I stated that {snip} I expected to be involved in teaching the class. The department was less than enthusiastic but agreed.</p>
<p>Immediately it was clear that the class was not a U.S. history course, which the state of Arizona requires for graduation. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The basic theme of the curriculum was that Mexican-Americans were and continue to be victims of a racist American society driven by the interests of middle and upper-class whites.</p>
<p>In this narrative, whites are able to maintain their influence only if minorities are held down. Thus, social, political and economic events in America must be understood through this lens.</p>
<p>This biased and sole paradigm justified teaching that our community police officers are an extension of the white power structure and that they are the strongmen used &#8220;to keep minorities in their ghettos.&#8221;</p>
<p>It justified telling the class that there are fewer Mexican-Americans in Tucson Magnet High School&rsquo;s advanced placement courses because their &#8220;white teachers&#8221; do not believe they are capable and do not want them to get ahead.</p>
<p>It justified teaching that the Southwestern United States was taken from Mexicans because of the insatiable greed of the Yankee who acquired his values from the corrupted ethos of Western civilization.</p>
<p>It was taught that the Southwest is &#8220;Atzlan,&#8221; the ancient homeland of the Aztecs, and still rightfully belongs to their descendants &mdash; to all people of indigenous Mexican heritage.</p>
<p>As an educator, I refused to be complicit in a curriculum that engendered racial hostility, irresponsibly demeaned America&rsquo;s civil institutions, undermined our public servants, discounted any virtues in Western civilization and taught disdain for American sovereignty.</p>
<p>When I raised these concerns, I was told that I was a &#8220;racist,&#8221; despite being Hispanic. Acknowledging my heritage, the Raza studies staff also informed me that I was a vendido, the Spanish term for &#8220;sellout.&#8221;</p>
<p>The culmination of my challenge to the department&rsquo;s curriculum was my removal from that particular class. The Raza studies department and its district-level allies pressured the Tucson High administration to silence my concerns through reassignment to another class during that one period.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I am not the only one to have been intimidated by the Raza studies department in this way.</p>
<p>The diplomatic and flattering language that the department and its proponents use to describe the Raza studies program is an attempt to avoid public scrutiny. {snip}</p>
<p>The proponents of this program may conceal its reality to the public. But as a former teacher in the program, I am witness to its ugly underbelly.</p>

			<p>&#8220;SELL-OUT&#8221;, the &#8220;magic&#8221; word used by the African National Congress terrorists as they justified the several public necklacing of poor blacks who questioned their evil motives always in public as an example to scare the masses in South Africa while they were spewing out Marxist propaganda to paint the whites as evil.  We saw one day photos in the national Press where a young black woman had been pulled from the crowd at a meeting that no one dare not to attend in one of the black townships.  She was beaten and insulted by the terrorist speakers and then a car-tire was placed around her neck, petrol poured into it and set on fire.   </p>
<p>How anyone can support such evil people?  One only can guess.  Usually due to pure fear and that is what the Marxist barbarians use.  The disproved system of Karl Marx should be universally taught in schools as an evil dead system.  It is possible for it to be taught without students realising what it is called. That is one way it was back in the 50s and 60s until the teachers were found out and fired.</p>

			<p>As a former Arizonan myself, I can testify 100% to the kind of Third World wasteland that Arizona and the entire Southwest has become and is becoming more so every day, which this article exemplifies.  Raza studies are little more than the tip of the iceberg that is bringing down the whole region as a viable economic and cultural bloc.</p>
<p>Exceeded only by Southern California, with its entrenched Chicano gangs, Arizona has now become the &#8220;northern arm&#8221; of a deadly and organized Latino criminal wave  &mdash;   in which the drug dealers and money launderers have far more power than the authorities.  This has become commonplace in Mexico and now it&rsquo;s overtaken California but especially Arizona, as well as New Mexico and even much of Texas.  When I go to visit my few remaining White friends still in Arizona, all I see are blighted neighborhoods, vandalism, graffiti, litter everywhere, violent and petty crime overtaking entire city blocks, failing schools and a place that resembles Guatemala more than any Western nation.</p>
<p>In fact, as Arizona demographically becomes an outpost of Central America more than an outpost of the West, the social and economic structures of the state are following suit.  In Arizona schools, White students are now well less than half the population, and for the sixth grade and under, whites are less than 40%  &mdash;   in fact, less than 1/3 of the students in primary school and dwindling more every year, with most of the balance being Chicano or African-American.  Even this awful statistic understates Arizona&rsquo;s dismal demographic future  &mdash;   millions of young Latinos never attend school since they&rsquo;re off the grid, out in the fields.  So Arizona will be majority non-White in about 5 years, and by the year 2020, it will be overwhelmingly Chicano, a little Central American banana republic with all its dysfunction.</p>
<p>There are two reactions that my White friends and their families have taken to this horrid state of affairs:<br>
1. Many are moving to the few remaining White states in the USA, chiefly Idaho and Wyoming (which are basically becoming repopulated with transplants from Arizona and California) but also to Upper South states like Kentucky or Tennessee, or in a few cases to Oregon and Washington in the Pacific Northwest, depending on their line of work.  Unfortunately, the entire USA is moving in the direction of Arizona at varying rates, which has made the second option increasingly popular among my fellow White Arizona refugees:</p>
<p>2. Leaving the USA entirely and taking their families with them.  There is a lot of variation from country to country, with Canada, Australia, Sweden, France, Russia and Britain if anything even worse than the USA in terms of their demographic collapse.  However, there&rsquo;s a surprisingly large subsection of the Western World that&rsquo;s showing a lot of backbone on this issue and determined to remain demographically White and Christian, with tough immigration laws that favor co-ethnics overseas while excluding the Global South, and a strong sense of ethnic and cultural solidarity.  Many of my old friends and neighbors have been emigrating to go there.</p>
<p>Main examples: The so-called &#8220;Alpine corridor&#8221; in Europe, consisting of Switzerland, Germany, Austria and Italy, extending out to Hungary and part of Romania.  A very popular option.  My best friend from college, a civil engineer in Ohio, learned some German and took his wife and five children to NW Austria where he now lives and runs a business (commuting between Austria and Germany).  Another ex-neighbor from Arizona took his wife and three children to southern Germany, another from Tennessee went to Italy.  Most have had some German/Nordic ancestry somewhere in the family tree but this is very common  &mdash;   if you just learn a bit of German, sprinkle in some Italian in there, play up your skills, you can move and raise your children there.  Also, while it helps to have lots of education and special skills, you basically just need to be hard-working and have some kind of craft.  Most of my friends there aren&rsquo;t computer programmers or scientists, they&rsquo;re folks like metalworkers, glass-blowers, mechanics, basically just people with practical skills and small businessmen willing to work hard.</p>
<p>Other options: White South America  &mdash;   Uruguay, Paraguay, Argentina, Chile, very White and non-mestizo, among the most European countries in the world and where a good few of my old friends are now raising their families.  You have to learn the language but it&rsquo;s easy to emigrate, as in the Alpine corridor, just work hard, learn some kind of trade or craft, start a business, whatever.  Also Scandinavia outside of Sweden  &mdash;   Denmark, Norway, Finland, another increasingly popular destination, seems it helps to know some German plus the local language, but hard to beat as far as raising your kids there.  The lesson is fairly obvious, once again  &mdash;   White families prefer to live in places where we can raise our children among our own kind, and instill our own values and historical consciousness.  This used to be something obvious even to elites in government  &mdash;   now, telling even such an obvious truth has become a revolutionary act.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;In this narrative, whites are able to maintain their influence only if minorities are held down. Thus, social, political and economic events in America must be understood through this lens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Utterly and shockingly laughable!</p>
<p>What is particularly appalling here, is that Mr. Ward (an odd name for a Hispanic, to be sure) totally misses the multicultural Neo-Marxist slant this rubbish called a &ldquo;curriculum&rdquo; takes. I mean, I hate to ever insinuate that I am even mildly naïve about this topic; but are there really &ldquo;educated&rdquo; people that stupid in this country, so as to miss the actual Red ideological underpinnings of such terrorist groups as: La Raza, the Nation of Islam, or even the Tucson Unified School District?</p>
<p>No wonder we get called &ldquo;Fascists&rdquo; or &ldquo;Nazis,&rdquo; if that is the case. Certainly, even Hillary Clinton would be considered quite close to the same, under these circumstances?</p>
<p>Of course, that would never happen; just ask Comrade Obama and his groupies, to say nothing of his wife.</p>
<p>Welcome to the &ldquo;real&rdquo; world of an emerging &ldquo;utopia,&rdquo; Mr. Ward!</p>
<p>And of course, as always, God help us all!!! <br>

			<p>The lesson here is that someone assigned as a &#8220;teacher of record&#8221; because the real instructors do not possess the teaching credentials required by the state is at best being set up, and at worst conspiring to violate state law.</p>

			<p>This is the group to which presidentail candidate John McCain is now kowtowing? We now see who are the real racists. La Raza never gives any thought to the corruption of the Mexican government that is forcing them to flee an oil rich nation. No mention of how Mexico treats illegal aliens from South America. </p>

			<p>Is there anyone who still thinks that minority peoples are just trying to get their &#8220;rights&#8221;? In the history of the world, has there ever been any rising people who, of their own volition, have said, &#8220;Okay, we have our fair share now, let&rsquo;s stop&#8221;?</p>

			<p>  Why is this being allowed to happen in U.S. schools? I could understand this being taught in Mexico, but not here. The first thing that needs to happen would be to fire the school board and school superintendent. Next, fire all teachers that have a problem with the others being fired. Clean out all those whom would teach this sort of poison to our children. And last, but foremost, clean out all students of hispanic descent that are not whole-heartedly willing to assimilate, legal and illegal.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve wondered about Chile as a possible place to live, but I recently saw a news film from Chile of a classroom of high school Chileans being taught Chinese (!) by a teacher from China, and I was surprised that the students appeared mestizo.</p>
<p>Any more info about Chile from you or from others?</p>

			<p>Tucson Magnet High School is a hotbed of cultural Marxism. As a former student (class of &#8216;07) I tried for four years to expose and report every single lie, every anti-white or anti-Semitic slur and every attempt at censorship at expressing pro-American ideas, to no avail.</p>
<p>My advice: homeschool your kids. It&rsquo;s the best thing you could ever do for them, especially if they live in TUSD.</p>

			<p>Now I understand the looks of scorn and hatred I regularly experience from Mexos.  The schools are also limiting vocabularies to less than 50 words so ESL students can compete.<br>
English speaking children are taught to learn limited English and Spanish rather than a fully developed English curiculum.<br>
Just listen, read and talk with those under 30.  English language skills are rapidly declining.   </p>

			<p>The reality is if you are inferior you either have to accept that or blame someone else.  If you are not inferior on the other hand you have to recognize their reality and help educate the remainder of the non inferior to it.  Keeping silent to avoid being called a racist is accepting defeat by these people.</p>

			<p>But ultimately these &#8220;graduates&#8221; will have to compete in a global economy whether or not they think it is fair; that, or work menial labor and become socially impotent. The latter possibility, I think, becomes the more likely one and that is foreseen by the Raza-supporters. They realize they aren&rsquo;t going to be competitive and their time to be big and proud is early on in life&hellip;the defeats will come later. So, naturally they hype themselves in high school and anywhere else they can fit it in. Sooner or later they&rsquo;ll just be poor old Joes scratching out a living.</p>

			<p>Some of the Southern Arizona-based posters seeking refuge need look only a couple of hundred miles north to Prescott, a place still as white as can be. The locals don&rsquo;t really want any more transplants or growth, but I point the place out for the sake of argument.</p>
<p>Also have to point out, reluctantly, that some of the dumbest low-life people I ever met in my life have been the locals there, especially in the two surrounding communities whose names I won&rsquo;t mention but that any Arizonan would know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny how certain types of white people step right up and fill the role of disenfranchised chip-on-the-shoulder/can&rsquo;t-cut-the-mustard minority when there aren&rsquo;t any real minorities around.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s plenty to say about obnoxiously ethnocentric hispanics  &mdash;  I work for one who is a particularly annoying combination of arrogance and incompetence  &mdash;  but will confine my post this time to a critique of those who think a place without minorities is a Nirvana of harmony.</p>

			<p>The duplicity of fallacious arguments raised by razists (members of La Raza) is mind boggling. I find it astonishing that the Liberal-controlled mass media were able to desensitize half of this nation to &#8220;Latinos&#8221; attempts of establishing ethnic hegemony in the U.S.  All this nonsense is possible because many of those who control the media &#8220;are morons who refuse to see duplicity of the Mexican invaders and their American collaborators. Morons who take the invaders&rsquo; claims for granted, no matter how much evidence of hypocrisy and deceit is presented to them. Idiots who suggest that there is symmetry between the invading hordes and the lawful residents of this country, and even try to extend citizens&rsquo; rights on the intruders&#8221; (quotation from<br>
 <br>
http://www.geocities.com/readerswrite/commentaries/Who_is_local_here.htm ).</p>
<p>What makes of this ridiculous situation a grave danger for this country is the nature (genes and culture) of vast majority of Mexican &#8220;immigrants&#8221; (blood-thirsty Aztecs&rsquo; descendents) who seem to attempt to reproduce progress made by national socialists and fascists in Europe 3/4 century ago. Just look at MEChA logo and &#8220;Plan de Aztlan&#8221; to see how much did they borrow from Mussolini. And La Raza irredentism &#8220;has a striking similarity to claims made by Hitler who insisted that certain Eastern European lands (for instance, western parts of Poland and Czechoslovakia) belonged to German nation solely on basis of ethnicity&#8221; (quotation from</p>
<p>http://www.geocities.com/readerswrite/commentaries/Cucpic.htm ).</p>
<p>Like socialist philosophy of 19th century resulted in Stalin, Mussolini, and Hitler, like the American &#8220;Liberalism&#8221; is on its way to produce similarly disastrous results. The &#8220;Latinos&#8221; do not command economies that the three mentioned above dictators did, but wait until &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; puts Hispanic spies on behalf of their aggressive nation at the helm of the U.S. armed forces. If this happens, atrocities of WWII will be dwarfed by what they will do to the Western world.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re absolutely right. I think Nietzche said it best.</p>
<p>Beware of the Preachers of Equality, for in them lies - Revenge.</p>
<p>But this is not revenge for anything we&rsquo;ve done.  It&rsquo;s simple revenge for who we ARE, or rather, who we WERE or even, who we could BE if we lived up to our potential.  But that ship has sailed.  Though I do believe that not only White survival, but growth and propserity - in every conceivable way, but especially spiritually - is still very much possible, it has a number of obstacles.  And the number one obstacle today is that as soon as we begin to mount an impressive effort toward large-scale organization, the Power Elite will have us slaughtered in droves and people from Bill Maher, to Chris Matthews and Keith Olbermann in the Press, and John McCain to Barak Obama in Government will not only NOT do anything about it, they will encourage, validate and justify it.<br>
Or, can you say, Zimbabwe?<br>
This is why websites like AR and VDARE can ONLY engage in a heroic description of exactly how the Power Elite is sticking it to us. But organize? Not a word.  Or has anyone not noticed this glaring fact?</p>

			<p>&#8220;Any more info about Chile from you or from others?&#8221;</p>
<p>I used to travel to Chile on business about 10 years. I went there off and on for 3 years. I was in the capital, Santiago, and a small town up north called Arica.I absolutely loved it!</p>
<p>If I were younger and had the means I would not hesitate to move there. Santiago and Arica are almost all White. The culture is definitely European. As a matter of fact, the first time I saw Santiago I thought I was back in Madrid. There&rsquo;s also a city south of Chile that is very German in character right down to the architecture. I can&rsquo;t think of the name of it right now, but I&rsquo;m sure you could look it up. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about the news film you saw, but I don&rsquo;t think there are many Indians there. There&rsquo;s so much propaganda on the news. I guess they want us to think that all people from South America are mestizo. Or maybe they&rsquo;re afraid we&rsquo;ll all move there!</p>
<p>I would definitely check into Chile.   </p>

			<p>Re: living in Chile</p>
<p>I went to high school in Santiago, Chile, in the late 60&rsquo;s. The upper class and middle class were a mixture of European nationalities: Spanish, Italian, German, English, Yugoslavian, etc. They lived very separate lives with separate schools and country clubs. There was an Italian school, English school (which I went to), German school, French school. </p>
<p>Overall, the vast majority were very Latin with the characteristics of that group. Very disorganized, unreliable, always late. They totally disregarded traffic laws. I suffered from relentless harassment from the men (and I was usually wearing a frumpy school uniform). Most people had black hair and tended to have large, beaky noses (from the Moors in Spain?)  There were some Germans there, and they were very polite and hard-working, but there were too few of them! The working class and lower class were mestizo. Our maid was Indian. </p>
<p>We lived in a large house surrounded by a high wall covered with broken glass. We were in a good neighborhood, but we had thieves stealing from our yard at night and the hubcaps on our new car didn&rsquo;t last a week.  And this was in 1965-68. I doubt things have improved. We spent three years there and I could hardly wait to get out. I would not recommend Chile.<br>

			<p>&#8220;Why is this being allowed to happen in U.S. schools? I could understand this being taught in Mexico, but not here. The first thing that needs to happen would be to fire the school board and school superintendent. Next, fire all teachers that have a problem with the others being fired. Clean out all those whom would teach this sort of poison to our children. And last, but foremost, clean out all students of hispanic descent that are not whole-heartedly willing to assimilate, legal and illegal.&#8221;</p>

It is not in the beast interests of the liberal/neocon alliance to get Hispanics to assimilate.  The Hispanics themselves are being used to harm America&rsquo;s white middle class.  Cheap labor is only a part of it. </p>

			<p>I can sympathize with Jupiter who says we should stay and fight to prevent our country from becoming Hispanic. However, even if we halt all immigration tomorrow (which isn&rsquo;t going to happen, politically), the demographic changes that have already occurred make it impossible to go back to the predominantly white nation that we were a short 20 years ago. </p>
<p>I read somewhere that in 2005, only 53% of the babies born in the U.S. were white. Given the cowardice and pandering of our politicians (and the need to raise millions for campaigns) it will continue to get worse. Much as I love democracy and our Constitution, only a dictatorship could reverse this and expel non-white citizens, or carve out a European sector of the US. I don&rsquo;t know what the solution is. I support NumbersUSA.com, but it feels more like a holding action, slowing the inevitable.</p>

			<p>I think there is a myth about &#8220;white South American&#8221; countries.<br>
It&rsquo;s true that some of those countries have significant white populations, but they also have significant mestizo and Indian populations. It would be interesting to see the numbers on that. Countries like Chile, Uruguay and Argentina have a lot more white citizens than Mexico or Guatemala, but they are not &#8220;white countries&#8221;. Also, there is such a stigma about Indian blood in those countries that many mestizos are in denial and consider themselves white. Therefore, any statistics coming from those countries about percentages of whites are probably suspect.</p>

			<p>What really bothers me is that with the influx of illegals coupled with our own home grown minorities is that the schools are forced to lower their scholastic standards. This is because the schools want to get these people through as soon as possible. After all, a 25 year old freshmen looks badly for everybody. KCMO schools are as bad as it gets. A minority dominated schoolboard with no qualifacations other than being a minority. Armed guards in the schools to keep students from killing each other. This, plus the schoolboard changes superintendants like I change underware. Sorta start to look like Zimbabwe in the inner-city these days.</p>

			<p>Jupiter, my White Nationalist friend of mine, who left the USA and now lives in very White Uruguay (with his Australian wife and three children), would strongly object to your characterization of his act as being &#8220;cowardly&#8221; or not &#8220;staying and fighting.&#8221;  As he told me, it&rsquo;s just a matter of choosing which battle to fight  &mdash;   one that, per his assessment, is far more winnable and where the cultural elements are far more on our side where he currently is.  I&rsquo;m with you 100% about the need to stay strong and stand our ground, but even the most stalwart fighters have to choose their battles carefully so as to not waste scarce resources.  Determination must coexist with strategic soundness.  I don&rsquo;t know whether my friend&rsquo;s decision about Uruguay in particular was the right one, and I often ask him about it.  OTOH, I don&rsquo;t see how anyone could argue with my old friends who now live in Alpine European countries like Austria, Switzerland and Germany, or in Denmark  &mdash;   greater than 97% White, surprisingly nationalist, a high culture of great achievement and innovation, with tough immigration laws that restrict immigration to co-ethnics and with a cultural coherence and solidarity we can only imagine here.  Perhaps because these countries had to fight Ottoman invasions for their very survival in previous centuries!</p>
<p>In any case, as the post following yours points out, even without further immigration  &mdash;   legal or illegal  &mdash;   the USA will be majority non-White by 2025 or 2030, due simply to the momentum of fertility rates from different groups already here.  Anyone who&rsquo;s done teaching or media services at American schools throughout the country, as I and perhaps many others here have, will appreciate this conclusion  &mdash;   among elementary schools in the USA, Whites are already in the minority and dwindling fast.  And this is even without further legal or illegal immigration, which continues at a high pace.  (Moreover, all 3 Presidential contenders  &mdash;   McCain, Obama and Clinton  &mdash;   are in favor of further immigration and amnesty, so it&rsquo;s only going to become much, much worse.)  Again, it isn&rsquo;t just the USA in this fix.  If anything, it&rsquo;s even worse in Australia and Canada, let alone in Sweden, Russia and Britain.  </p>
<p>So, again, it&rsquo;s just a matter of choosing one&rsquo;s battles, and the kind of antagonistic attitude you take in your post is unhelpful to say the least.  Most White Nationalists I know, whether staying in the USA or moving to raise their kids in an Alpine country, in Uruguay, or in Denmark or Finland, very much care about the survival of our people, but they&rsquo;ve done hard-headed analyses that have pushed them in one direction or another.  As for me personally, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to go to South America due to both personal and professional reasons, but I won&rsquo;t question my friends who have so long as they&rsquo;ve made an informed choice.  OTOH, I myself have contemplated a move to an Alpine country for reasons both personal and philosophical  &mdash;   that European Continent is where *we* are indigenous, after all, the brain and heart of our people&rsquo;s body.  And if we lose the brain and heart, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what other land we inhabit  &mdash;   we become a people without roots, the heartland of our collective memory stripped away from us, and then we slowly die as a people.  So if anything, it would seem that in the hierarchy of our battles, maintaining a strong demographic presence in the European Continent may be the most important, more so even than in the Americas, so I wholeheartedly support those who choose to go there.  OTOH I&rsquo;m also receptive to arguments about the need to stay and fight here, which I am currently doing albeit with decreasing success and increasing frustration.  We need to support our people anywhere they may be, whichever particular battle they may be waging.</p>

Absolutely correct.  The illegal alien population is skewed towards younger people in their reproductive prime, while the white population is rapidly aging.  This can be unscientifically confirmed by observing hispanics in traffic or at the store.  They are mostly young people.   In other words, the demographic time bomb has already exploded, and there is nothing we can do to get back to the demographics when America was at its prime.  I believe that America has peaked, and that we are now witnessing a downhill slide that will increase until we reach a perfect storm of political or military disasters, at which point our lives are going to change for the worse. <br>

			<p>I am very curious why those of you who deplore Hispanic culture in the United States would want to move to Argentina? I used to live and work there. While it is true that Argentina (as well as Uruguay and to some extent also Chile, though not Paraguay) has many people of European (mostly Italian and Spanish) descent, as a result of mass migration from Southern Europe at the turn of the last century, Argentina is a Spanish-speaking society with a very Latin culture that has far more in common with Mexico and other Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America. I would think that would be obvious. In the past century, it has been considerably less stable politically than Mexico, with plenty of brutal military dictatorships and corrupt governments, as well as recurring economic crises. Also, the European element in the country has been diluted in recent years by many Indian and mestizo migrants from Peru and Bolivia. </p>
<p>If you wish to move to Argentina, by all means to do so, but prepare for your children to speak only Spanish, and to have a reduced standard of living compared to middle-class life in the USA. <br>

<p>Not in Argentina there isn&rsquo;t. They are almost entirely of Italian and Spanish ancestry, with a little Welsh, German, even Irish.  The Indians are harmless, as are all the people for that matter, and are in the far northwest of Salta and Jujuy.  And the women, though for the most part stark raving mad, are drop dead gorgeous like you won&rsquo;t find anywhere.  </p>
<p>If people are thinking of leaving I would go there, quietly, especially if you are fortunate enough to have some money tucked away.  I&rsquo;m not so fortunate, no rich uncle. But I did find a job and stayed there for almost 4 years. Wonderful place, lots of problems, but you could do a lot worse.</p>
<p>The USA? It IS going the way of Zimbabwe for Whites, and LA and New Orleans is the beginning of a pattern for Blacks.  All of the political rhetoric can not cover the fact that Blacks and Hispanics are Oil and Water.  It&rsquo;s just not going to happen. And the scary thing about Whites is, like the one poster said, if we begin to organize we will probably be slaughtered. <br>
Personally, Whites need to learn how to talk to each other.<br>
Does anyone think people like Brenda Walker or anyone else at VDARE, fine a write as she is, knows how to talk to the common White folk? No way. They write their immigration papers and that&rsquo;s it.</p>

<p>The socialist/communist movement from the 30&rsquo;s, 40&rsquo;s and 50&rsquo;s have pretty much achieved their goals.  &#8220;The Communist Manifesto&#8221; instructs to infiltrate the schools first.  What a better place than where young minds are molded?  Seeing what the schools are turning out, I&rsquo;d say they&rsquo;ve done a pretty good job of indoctrination.  Anyone disagree?  The teachers unions are full of left-wing socialist minded lemmings.  And which candidate do you think receives the most support from the teachers unions - none other than socialist minded Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most of the parents of today&rsquo;s school age children are just &#8220;red diaper doper babies&#8221; themselves.  That one little darling they decided to have was already being indoctrinated the minute it entered the world.</p>
<p>We are so far down the road to socialism and nobody seems to care.  It&rsquo;s all about what can the all powerful government do for me.

They realize they aren&rsquo;t going to be competitive and their time to be big and proud is early on in life&hellip;the defeats will come later.

			<p>OK, I agree with the poster above that probably 90% of Argentines are primarily of European descent (mostly Spanish and Italian, with some British, German, and Polish mixed in), but their political and social culture is definitely Latin and much closer to that of Mexico than that of the United States. I&rsquo;ve worked in all three countries (USA, Mexico, and Argentina), as well as several other places in Latin America, so I can assure you this is true. If you are used to living in the United States rather than Mexico, you will have cultural adaptation problems.</p>
<p>For that matter, Colombia also has a fairly large white population (perhaps about half of Colombians), though it also has lots of mestizos and blacks, and it is the archetypal Latin culture. Many upper-class Mexicans are also white (remember Mexico is second-largest Latin country after Brazil), though for various reasons the indigenous element remains extraordinarily strong in the country as well. Most Latin American countries have a well-defined class system, with those of European descent on top and indigenous peoples at the bottom. Argentina, which also has vast wealth disparities, is different only that the working class and poor are also mostly white   &mdash;   even many of the street children selling flowers in Buenos Aires are white, in fact.</p>
<p>Hope that helps! :) (BTW, I live in Los Angeles and I&rsquo;m perfectly English/Spanish bilingual, so I don&rsquo;t exactly worry about Spanish becoming predominant in this state.)</p>

Simple Gayle, it&rsquo;s because they don&rsquo;t love them as much as they profess. </p>
<p>I came from a family that didn&rsquo;t walk the talk, at all. That had an effect on me, to put it mildly. Long story short, I went into Counseling for Adult-Children of Alcoholics, and for other programs that dealt with Abuse and Neglect (and I worked almost exclusively with White children, because that&rsquo;s what I wanted to do).  And not just with poor children either. Well, all I can say for now in a post is, you would not believe the level of, what they refer to as &#8220;sincere denial&#8221; which = Delusion, among the Parents.  Except for a few cases I don&rsquo;t know their politics. But to guess I&rsquo;d say that there&rsquo;s representation from both Conservative and Liberal.

			<p>&#8220;Argentina is a Spanish-speaking society with a very Latin culture that has far more in common with Mexico. I  would think that would be obvious. In the past century, it has been considerably less stable politically than Mexico, with plenty of brutal military dictatorships and corrupt governments, as well as recurring economic crises.&#8221; <br>
Posted by at 6:15 AM on May 26 </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry Anonymous, but this just isn&rsquo;t accurate. There&rsquo;s some truth, but overall your post misrepresents Argentina. <br>
Yes, you would have to learn Spanish, but English thrives here and many of the people love speaking it. <br>
And there have been dictatorships, the last one from 1976 to 1981, ending with their disasterous &#8220;conflict&#8221; in the Falklands when England laid them over a railing and beat &#8216;em like a dusty rug in no time flat.<br>
They may even be headed for another one with Christina, the wife of the last President (the WIFE of the last President! What does THAT tell ya?).  But Argentina is a threat to no one, except maybe themselves.  </p>
<p>But the economic crisis you&rsquo;re talking about is happening in the States too, and is going to get worse.  And to money problems you can add racial problems (which Argentina just does not have right now and for the forseeable future).  <br>
I&rsquo;ll tell ya, if an AR type community could get itself started and off the ground I would come back and be a part of it. <br>
But does anyone honestly see that happening?<br>
I was living in three different Big Cities in the USA and almost got killed for being White at least once, in all of them.<br>
I just did not get the impression that the Whites cared about each other or knew what to do.  So I left.</p>

			<p>Argentina and Chile are both 80% White and 20% Indian. The Argentines have 3% Black too. The average Argentine is 78% White, 19% Indian and 3% Black. Almost all Argentines have Indian blood, all the way from 1% to 83% in one recent study of 100 Argentines. The Chileans are almost all Mestizos. They are 80% White and 20% Indian. The upper classes are 15% Indian and the lower classes are 25% Indian. Those are really both just 20% Indian Mestizo countries. Be careful what you wish for.</p>

JohnPM said: <i>are there really &ldquo;educated&rdquo; people that stupid in this country?<i></i></i></p>
<p>Yes I believe there are John.  I used to ask the same question and from what I&rsquo;ve observed, higher ed. degrees are fairly easy to obtain from any institution provided you are prepared to proffer the same Socialist talking points that the lecturer makes. Combine this with the fact that Socialist ideology is extremely undemanding, frequently resorting to solving complex problems with simplistic sloganeering. Presenting the case for Conservatism and Capitalism is far more complicated and requires a depth of understanding that emotive talking points lack.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Educated&rsquo;? Well yes, in such time-honoured and demanding disciplines as Peace Studies, Conflict Resolution, Women&rsquo;s studies and the like. </p>
<p>Speaking of education, Subway is conducting a writing contest. Check out at the bottom just who is excluded; also check out the spelling of &lsquo;United States&rsquo; at the lower edge, the spelling of the word &lsquo;basket&rsquo; in the right hand panel.  The author says he had an eye operation just before he wrote the sign, hence the splelloing errors, so that&rsquo;s ok then.<br>

			<p>Any &#8220;White Nationalist&#8221; who is seriously thinking about leaving America for a hispanic nation should just stop posting comments here. You folks have already quit the struggle. So what is the point of posting here?</p>
<p>There is aleady strong resistance to post-1965 immigration policy. It is growing with each passing year. Compared to 1990, it is night and day. However, to stop the complete racial and economic dispossession of the majority Native Born White American population, a fierce what-ever-it-takes racial conciousness has to take hold in the Native Born White American population. This will happen when America is hit with concurrent major catastrophies.</p>
<p>At that point in time when millions of Native Born Americans relaize that their children have no future, the game will be up. There will be no incentive to continue tolerating the beltway consensus about the blessings of diversity. Let me tell you something. Thei consensus dam near broke down on 9/11 and the weeks afterwood. The Republican and Democratic traitors were very worried. The lid blew off very briefly. When the lid final is blown off the completely, Native Born White Americans are going to be faced with two choices:1)deportation of all illegals,revocation of US citienship to their &#8220;American&#8221; born children,LEGAL immigration shutdown completely to 0 and the deportation of fifth column elements from asia-silicon valley and its suburbs- and the middle east&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;or&hellip;&hellip;.2)a loss of large tracts of American territory to Mexico,China,India and Pakistan and eventually complete racial and economic dispossession within the borders of America.These are the only two options.</p>
<p>If there is a collapse of the White Middle class the game is over.</p>

			<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;As long as I get my check every month and I don&rsquo;t have to do anything for it.</p>
<p>Gail, you might want to consider that HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS of American taxpayers and workers were required BY LAW to pay into the social security program, as were their employers. In short, we HAD NO OPTION to invest those funds privately. Nor did our employers, for that matter. So please retract that cheap shot with which you slander millions of retired Americans.</p>
<p>The government&rsquo;s tendency to &#8216;borrow&rsquo; the money collected by the Social Security Program put us in a hole. As did those unneeded wars Bush decided to launch on a bed of lies. Note I also include the 911 incidents into that &#8216;bed of lies&rsquo; comment. Those wars left us and our descendants with debt of trillions of dollars to eventually pay off. NOT, as you imply, those honorable retirees.</p>

Sure, they can have my head   &mdash;   should it come to that. But the price being 25 of THEIR heads before taking mine. Bet YOUR LIFE on it, amigos.

			<p><i>probably 90% of Argentines are primarily of European descent (mostly Spanish and Italian &hellip;)</i></p>
<p>The question of whether Argentinians are of &#8220;European descent&#8221; or not is a divertion from the one that should be asked: what exactly is their genetic and cultural background? If they are Spanish Catholics then they will build another Mexico. If they are Southern Italian, Cosa Nostra and vendetta are likely to root themselves there. If they are from Russia, expect pro-socialist sympathies among the populace.</p>
<p>The U.S. was founded and build from scratch by Anglo protestants, and according to Max Weber, these very &#8220;ingreadients&#8221; (genes, culture, and religion) were necessary for the success of this nation. In other words it&rsquo;s not enought to be just of &#8220;European descent&#8221; in order to build a great country like the U.S. - one needs to be a very special kind of European descendent in order to succeed in doing so.</p>
<p>Just like it&rsquo;s not enough for a man to mary a woman (as opposed to, say, giraffe) in order to build a happy family. She needs to be a right kind of woman.<br>

<p><i>But without organization, which neither AR or VDARE say ONE WORD about (aside from AR&rsquo;s harmless conferences), both amount to Hi-Tech Cry Baby Websites.</i></p>
<p>So, again, what do you propose?</p>
<p>Well, there you have the conundrum. From where I stand, there are only two courses of action available right now: the political, and the violent, and neither seems particularly promising.</p>
<p>On the political front, obviously no amount of pressure we put on our current crop of libs/neocons in office is going to be of much use. It would simply amount to running to the people responsible for the problem and begging them to fix it for us. There is always the possibility of putting new politicians in who would help us deal with these problems, and I highly recommend &#8220;cleaning house&#8221; with congress. But the downside is that for this to work, huge amounts of money, organization, and above all time, will be required. Time is the real kicker, as it may very well take more than we have left before America has become politically and fiscally insolvent altogether.</p>
<p>The violence option never fails to reach one on an emotional level, particularly when one has watched armed Mexican gangs take over and terrorize parts of towns and cities that were once nice places to live. But the realities on the ground are not so sanguine (or perhaps could be, since the Latin root of &#8220;sanguine&#8221; actually means &#8220;bloody&#8221;). The fact is that battle requires much sacrifice, is easily botched, and in this case would be met with superior (and likely insurmountable) force, not from the gangs and criminals infesting our towns and cities, but from the aforementioned politicians who let them in. It doesn&rsquo;t help that much of the citizenry will view decent white people protecting their turf from violent criminal invaders as &#8220;racists&#8221; and &#8220;evil.&#8221;</p>
<p>In short, we still have much more to lose by fighting than we do by simply packing up and moving on. While I reckon that conflict is probably inevitable in the long run, it won&rsquo;t happen until this has changed. It&rsquo;s not a scenario to which I&rsquo;m looking forward.</p>

			<p>The other day my wife and I went to the mall in this affluent majority white area.  Well things have changed.  The mall didn&rsquo;t reflect what the local demographic statistics claim.  And it felt so foreign just walking through the mall.  There were foreigners from everywhere, of course they were all from third world countries and of course speaking their foreign tongue.  After going to the mall I&rsquo;m feeling more motivated to move out of the US.  It pains me to see that the country my grand fathers fought for is being pissed away.  My grand-father didn&rsquo;t storm the beaches of Normandy so America can be handed away to some third world immigrant who wants satellite TV and an Escalade with shiny rims.  He fought that war for his son, for me and for my children - his offspring.</p>
<p>My wife and I have been struggling with whether we should move to Europe.  In the past my wife used to be quite liberal and accepting in these issues but even now she can&rsquo;t deny what her eyes see and she&rsquo;s very interested in moving to Europe.  She&rsquo;s had enough too. It&rsquo;s gotten to the point where I don&rsquo;t even like going out anymore.  And I&rsquo;m tired of feeling uneasy when my wife goes out.</p>
<p>We have a lot of kids and we want our kids to live in a safe area that celebrates who they are.  </p>
<p>Looking at the demographic and educational stats, it truly appears that it&rsquo;s over for the US.  Sure, there will be huge white enclaves and a few white states but still, and life will go on as normal for many whites I believe but why support a system that doesn&rsquo;t value you?</p>
<p>You only live once, why not put your energies toward a country that&rsquo;ll celebrate you and your children?</p>

			<p>&gt;&gt; Argentina and Chile are both 80% White and 20% Indian.<br>
&gt;&gt; The average Argentine is 78% White, 19% Indian and 3% Black.</p>
<p>I know plenty of Argentines, though, especially in Buenos Aires, where all 4 grandparents were born in Europe (usually Italy).<br>
For example, out of my four best Argentine friends:<br>
one had all four parents born in Italy,<br>
another is French Swiss-Italian-Lebanese,<br>
another is English-Argentine mix (grandfather came to Argentine from England in the 1930&rsquo;s),<br>
another is Lithuanian-Russian descent</p>
<p>Of course Argentina also has lots of mestizos. There was once a large black community, as in Brazil, but it has disappeared (whether they were killed or simply assimilated through intermarriage is something of a mystery).</p>

			<p>An Outline of a White Nationalist Party.<br>
1. For the majority of our nations history America <br>
has been 80-90% white.<br>
2. For the majority of our national history their have<br>
been racial quotas to preserve our national identity.<br>
An identification of America with white European history<br>
has been HISTORICALLY the norm. <br>
3. National identity is just that NATIONALIST. We are under <br>
no obligation moral or otherwise to solve other countries<br>
population problems, their failed economies, or their political<br>
disasters. <br>
4. Diversity beyond a certain point does not bring &#8220;strength&#8221; it brings irresolvable conflict and economic burden. No nation<br>
can be all things to all people. <br>

			<p>If and when the situation of whites in America becomes so untenable, so obviously untenable that the majority of whites demand what Jupiter proposes, the deportation of illegal aliens and the shutting down of legal immigration to zero   &mdash;   how will it be done? The government, both parties, is committed to just the opposite. That the government is insane hardly matters. It is as committed to racial and national suicide as white nationalists are to survival. So how is it to be done? Not by peaceful means. Even if, by some miracle, the electorate were to succeed in wresting control of the executive and legislative branches via the ballot, the judges would remain to rule the necessary changes &#8220;unconstitutional.&#8221; Which leaves only revolution. Violent revolution. But as long as whites remain comfortable economically revolution won&rsquo;t happen. A middle class, even a very stressed middle class, doesn&rsquo;t make a revolution. And white America is overwhelmingly middle class, that is to say, relatively comfortable. Barring a great depression the revolution that might save America for whites just ain&rsquo;t gonna happen.  </p>

			<p>Of course Argentina also has lots of mestizos. There was once a large black community, as in Brazil, but it has disappeared (whether they were killed or simply assimilated through intermarriage is something of a mystery).</p>
<p>Posted by hello at 5:12 PM on May 27 </p>
<p>They were killed, slaughtered, to be more precise.  And it&rsquo;s no mystery down here.</p>
<p>Come down here, it&rsquo;s great.  Be discreet, polite and learn some Spanish. God forbid you should learn another language. I can&rsquo;t believe people who talk about their connection to Europe, where most educated people speak English and other languages, complain about learning spanish. Please, these same people also DONT even bother to read the great books from their own culture, so&hellip;</p>
<p>In the USA I look at it like this. Whites in the next generation will stand as much chance of survival as Whites in a Prison where they are the minority. UNLESS they organize. But as we all know, they are making that illegal. Hell, they are making it illegal to call illegals illegal.  They are going to make being White a criminal offense.  How else could you explain Noel Ignatievs presence at - HARVARD!  <br>
Wake up folks and use those muscles of innovation Whites are famous for. Embrace an alternative and make it happen.</p>

<p>If the left/liberal environmentalist had gotten their way years ago, almost all sprawl would have come to end. If this had happened, post 1965 LEGAL immigration would have been shut down to 0 a long time ago. </p>
<p>I believe the future holds concurrent catastrophes, both economic and environmental. It may take ecocide in California before the message sinks in. Post-1965 non-whites are hell-bent  on expanidng their numbers very rapidly in California. California&rsquo;s endangered species-many of them are them are species that occur no where else on the planet will go extinct. I write this with one hundred percent certainty. This will be noticed by Native Born White Americans living in other states. My prediction is that at some point in time opposition to post-1965 immigration policy will be extremely fierce and brutal. Look at what is happening in South Africa.</p>

			<p>&#8220;ricpic&#8221; is right, of course. Although I would expect a different turn of events. That when &#8216;critical mass&rsquo; is reached with respect to immigration (legal OR illegal), Americans will take action with their own hands. Probably violent attacks on non-White immigrants of all stripes. Torching cars, smashing windows. Physical attacks. Torching businesses owned by immigrants. Torching businesses employing immigrants. Just a guess, of course, but things like this have happened in the past. Given the scenario ENOUGH Americans get outraged enough, it can well happen again. (Or worse.)</p>
<p>Would it happen? Your guess is a good as mine. Since not all Americans are spineless couch potatoes, I&rsquo;d suggest the possibility is quite real. Time will tell if I guessed right or not.</p>

<p>&gt; You are right.  It seems that there is no longer anyone with real power who is for the quickly shrinking majority white U.S.  I suspect that we are viewed by both the capitalist corporation and the social Marxists as expendable.</p>
<p>America is dying a slow, ugly death and both conservative and liberal are to blame.</p>

<p>&gt; A Great Depression may well be in store within the next decade, maybe sooner - perhaps later.  But eventually it will happen and be worldwide.  When that happens, which is inevitable because of the unsustainability of human population growth, it will be a racial, national and even class driven debacle.  All this will be helped along by worldwide disease pandemics.  This was predicted by some intellectuals as early as 1980, one of whom was Issac Asimov the physicist and science fiction writer.</p>
<p>Biblical?  Some will invariably claim it, but it will happen nonetheless - and Jesus won&rsquo;t be coming to the party.  The human race will disappear or nearly so and the planet will slowly recover from all the poison and imbalance our species has put it through.  It is a matter of debate whether any humans will be left or if human like beings will ever rise again.</p>
<p>Many will hate me for writing this, but it is a statistical and biological certainty.<br>

			<p>I suppose I am a &#8220;mestizo&#8221; with 3/16 Cherokee and Tuskarora blood.  I thought I was white until I was 30.  With fair skin, gray eyes and brown hair, I look white.</p>
<p>You can pour a fair bit of orange juice into lemonade and still have lemonade.  Pouring coffee into it doesn&rsquo;t work as well.</p>

Please phone, fax, e-mail them and express your anger at US tax dollars being used to fund this treason, terrorism. Follow up by e-mailing them this article. Learn how to do this, teach others. This is how we beat back the mass illegal alien amnesty.&#8221;</p>

			<p>I think there is a myth about &ldquo;white South American&rdquo; countries.<br>
It&rsquo;s true that some of those countries have significant white populations, but they also have significant mestizo and Indian populations. It would be interesting to see the numbers on that. Countries like Chile, Uruguay and Argentina have a lot more white citizens than Mexico or Guatemala, but they are not &ldquo;white countries&rdquo;. Also, there is such a stigma about Indian blood in those countries that many mestizos are in denial and consider themselves white. Therefore, any statistics coming from those countries about percentages of whites are probably suspect.</p>
<p>Posted by at 2:48 PM on May 25 </p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe some of these posts.  What people need to do is go down there and see how &#8220;mestizo&#8221; countries like Argentina and Uruguay are.  I am of European descent, half of it Italian and most Argentineans are of European descent.  It does not compare to Mexico (which is a ridiculous statement) and they are not mestizos posing as whites as they do sometimes in the USA. The average Argentinean is not 20% Amerindian.  Every nation has its unique culture.  Don&rsquo;t compare Argentina to Mexico or Peru, for example.  It&rsquo;s a very inaccurate thing to state.  It&rsquo;s also very ignorant.</p>
<p>I suggest to the average American to get on a plane and see for yourself.  I tell that to everyone since people just make up fantasies of what the world is like but have never traveled to some of these countries.  See Patagonia in both Argentina and Chile.  Visit a Welsh tea house there.  See something.</p>
<p>La Raza is a tool used to destroy what&rsquo;s left of eurocentricity in the USA.  Let&rsquo;s focus on exposing these people - or better - the people who are using them as that tool.</p>
