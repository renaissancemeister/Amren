<h1>Mexican Lawmakers Decriminalize Migrants</h1>
									<div align="left">
						<i>Mark Stevenson, AP, April 30, 2008</i></font> 
					</div>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Migrant rights activists applauded a vote by Mexico&rsquo;s Congress to remove long-standing criminal penalties for undocumented migrants found in the country.</p>
<p>The measure passed unanimously in the lower house on Tuesday, a day after Senate approval. President Felipe Calderon&rsquo;s office declined to say whether he would sign the popular measure into law.</p>
<p>Mexican lawmakers saw the harsh penalties as an anachronism, and some noted Mexico also owes migrants better treatment.</p>
<p>Immigrants here, mostly Central Americans trying to reach the U.S., are often robbed, mistreated and subject to extortion by bandits and even police.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Current law lays out punishments of 1 1/2 to 6 years, while the new measure makes undocumented immigration a minor offense punishable by fines equivalent to about US$475 (euro300) to US$2,400 (euro1,535).</p>
<p>Some Mexican officials acknowledged that the current harsh penalties weakened Mexico&rsquo;s position in arguing for better treatment of its own migrants in the United States.</p>

			<p>Mexico has had Bush in its pocket for years.  They play him like a fiddle and he always  rolls over on anything the Mexicans want including prosecuting Border Patrolmen.  This is just another ploy to justify pushing  more and more illegals into the U.S. <br>
Bush&rsquo;s current approval rate is 28%, which is much too high considerating the devastating damage he has done to our country.  The &#8220;brilliant&#8221; Bush is attempting to completely change the U.S. without even consulting American citizens or members of the congress.  Bush has obviously decided that it&rsquo;s time America joined the global community and forfeit our sovereignty in favor of a world government.<br>

			<p>I am 20 miles from the Mexican border.</p>
<p>The truth is that the White elite in Mexico handles their Mestizo, Indian, non Whites, criminals better than we Whites in America do. Mexico is a third world country and the rich, middle class Whites in Mexico understand this, they are not idiots trying to make everyone in Mexico, Mexico/Central America equal, one nation. Horrible things happen in Mexico, but the Whites react better after the fact. </p>
<p>Just last week in TJ drug gangs had a gun battle in broad daylight, scores were killed. In a couple of days, Mexican government sends in Mexican army, tanks solider with their best weapons, uniforms. The word is out that those who did the shootings will be hunted down and killed. Good.</p>
<p>In Contrast in my old neighborhood in Chicago, similar gang shootings by Blacks is met by response from media and chief of police that the problem is guns and also gangs were upset that some of their leaders had been arrested and put in jail. So we&rsquo;re supposed to understand the anger of the gangs. Then the cursed Chicago SUn Times runs a big photo op of White people with their backs turned saying it is all White rich, middle class fault for turning their backs on the non White poor.</p>
<p>Yep, Mexico does it better. Also, TJ has legal prostitution and I see no evidence of feminists like Hillary or half African half White Lefty mom bastard children being promoted for President of Mexico.</p>
<p>Yep, Mexico looks better and better, USA worse and worse.</p>
<p>Also, Mexico seems to have less idiot X&rsquo;tian preachers, televangelists.</p>

			<p>Does that mean Mexican law enforcement will stop murdering and raping illegals that enter THEIR country?  Hmmm.  I wonder how they will react to the fact that most of those people will now settle in Mexico, once they find out there is a giant wall preventing them from getting into the US.</p>
<p>Not well, I think.</p>

			<p>This is just a show.  Mexican officials admit its just to enhance their negotiating position with the US.  I mean, come on, how many &#8220;migrants&#8221; are actually prosecuted in Mexico?  They&rsquo;re beaten, raped, robbed, and sent on their merry way to the US border.  Mexico doesn&rsquo;t waste time and money prosecuting them.  So in effect, nothing will change, but Mexican politicians can point to their new lenient migration policies and badger the US to do the same.  </p>

			<p>Unfortunately, this ends Mexico&rsquo;s role filtering out illegals from farther south: Guatemala, etc, and will force the US to become even stricter about border-control.</p>
