						<p>A high school student says he may file a lawsuit against a physical education teacher who took a Mexican flag he had brought for Cinco de Mayo and put it in the garbage.</p>
<p>Clint Straatman denies Froylan Camelo&rsquo;s version of events but said he took the flag Monday because &#8220;white kids&#8221; might have hurt the 16-year- old. He said he put it in a garbage can because he had no place else to keep it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Camelo and others brought Mexican flags to the south-central Idaho school to celebrate Cinco de Mayo, the May 5 recognition of Mexico&rsquo;s victory over the French army on that day in 1862. About a third of the student body is Hispanic.</p>
<p>Straatman denied saying the words Camelo attributed to him, and said the student may have misunderstood him because of his poor English skills. He said he took the flag from Camelo after Camelo had been waving it in the school gym, and denied withholding it later.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had to confiscate it so it wouldn&rsquo;t escalate any problems in class,&#8221; Straatman told The Times-News. &#8220;We&rsquo;re worried about that stuff all the time. We always have kids saying stuff to each other, and we have a lot of fights between kids.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott Rogers, superintendent of the Minidoka County Joint School District, said an investigation has been started. He said he could not comment specifically about personnel decisions.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe in nondiscriminatory practices and cultural sensitivity,&#8221; [Scott Rogers, superintendent of the Minidoka County Joint School District] said. &#8220;We train for that and talk about that. If there is a teacher making derogatory comments we don&rsquo;t approve of that. We also don&rsquo;t approve of a student disrupting the classroom.&#8221;</p>

					<p>Got to go with the kid on this one. He should have given the flag back after class. Disrespecting the Mexican flag was a big no-no. Even on our turf. People died for that one too. Even enemies respect each others rank and nationality. At least we should. Nobodys flag belongs in the trash. On the other hand I`ve worked with kids. Lots of times their story is altered to cover themselves, or set an agenda. They are too young to realize the ramifications that lying can have about the adults involved&hellip;</p>

<p>Good!  Now hold your Mexican students to the same standards and let them be sensitive to the American students whose forefathers died for the right of American citizens to enjoy life, libery and the pursuit of happiness.</p>
<p>It is illegal in Mexico for foreign visitors to participate in any form of political speech and I believe it is also illegal for them to wave foreign flags. Oh.. and Mexico does not tolerate illegal immigrants, even if they are just passing through.</p>
<p>So how about holding these Mexican students to Mexican standards too!</p>
<p>Hold them to some kind of standard other than <span class="caps">VICTIMS.</span></p>

					<p>I&rsquo;m hoping this teacher isn&rsquo;t being totally honest, and it had something to do with patriotism. Once, and I emphasize if, Hussein is elected, and he passes the directive he&rsquo;s promised on hate crimes, this would likely be a crime punishable by death, or at least life imprisonment. I wonder who he&rsquo;d appoint to head the department of the thought police? Maybe a payback to the rev. J. awwWRIGHT.  P. S. {good post Ozzy}</p>

					<p>I remember a few years ago the cover on Time Magazine: an American flag in trashcan. And when many patriotic Americans protested such offensive picture, the &#8220;Liberal&#8221; press defended it as an artistic expression and an exercise of free speech. They claimed they couldn&rsquo;t see anything offensive in it.</p>
<p>They (the &#8220;Liberal&#8221; press) changed their testimony, I guess.<br>

<p>Camelo sounds like a troublemaker that might have been baiting <span class="caps">AMERICAN </span>students in gym by waving the Mexican Flag in their faces. In any case the teacher was wrong to take it away rather than burning it. Nothing like a lesson that lasts.</p>

					<p>How times have changed. In the old days, the teacher would have let the students beat him up. This would have been called a &#8220;Learning experience.&#8221; Instead of appreciating the beating that he missed, the junior reconquista will probably sue the school.</p>

					<p>He put the flag where it belongs. In the garbage. Minidoka County schools are more likely 4% non-White than 4% White. This county is in southern Idaho near the Utah border southwest of Pocatello. That whole area is about 95% White.</p>

					<p>Ah, Ozzie Ozzie Ozzie!<br>
 The point is that I <span class="caps">DON</span>`T go to their country and wave their flag around. Just because a child acts a fool in my presence doesn`t mean it follows that I do too or approve of his actions.  I  don`t act like an eleven year old boy myself  just because one in my own class does. And finally as for choosing which side I`m on&hellip; At this point  I`m not really on the side of a country that treats ME like a second class citizen. Which leaves me on Tim Mc Hughs side. Acting like an adult. Which is what the real  issue is here . And I guess that doesn`t leave me on <span class="caps">YOUR </span>side. Fair enough, cowboy! And finally Ozzie, if you want my respect try signing your full legal name. <br><br>

					<p>We have only two flags here: the Stars &amp; Bars and Old Glory.  Schools are allowed to insist students remove offensive items from their property.</p>
<p>If I had been the teacher, I&rsquo;d have asked this jerk whether he thought May 5 was the anniversary of Mexican independance from France, or Mexican independance from Idaho.  I&rsquo;d have still taken the flag away, but given it back at the end of the day, out of respect for someone else&rsquo;s property, perhaps with a long essay about the diffrence between being a US resident and a US citizen, written in English, due in two days.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not so simple. I remember reading about Czech immigrants to the <span class="caps">USA </span>and South America. They worked hard, they respected their new lands, but they kept some traditions (community life, food, folksinging) of their old European homeland, and, yes, occassionally they also wawed its flag. And they did it even in third generation, which hardly spoke any Czech&hellip;</p>

					<p>The difference between displaying a Czech flag and a Mexican flag is that Mexico is an enemy of the United States.  The war has not been declared because our government is in the hands of anti-White traitors, but we are in fact engaged in low-intensity war with Mexico.  </p>

					<p>Hey, how&rsquo;s this one for <span class="caps">MEXICAN PATRIOTISM AND FAMILY VALUES </span>in Idaho? Yes, <span class="caps">IDAHO, </span>of all places&hellip; </p>
<p>I could hardly believe the story, part of which is excerpted below took place in <span class="caps">IDAHO.</span> Our country is going down fast now.</p>
<p>Mexicans <span class="caps">RAPING </span>woman and/or children? Not that uncommon in Houston&rsquo;s news. Child molestation, rape, incest by Mexicans with family members   &mdash;   disgusting, abominable crimes that seem have <span class="caps">ALL </span>turned up in our news with sickening regularity over the last few years. (Look up <span class="caps">CRIMESTOPPER </span>home page for Houston, TX sometimes.) Houston is &#8220;blessed&#8221; with a large Mexican population. Read this: the link will be under the excerpt:</p>
<p>10-year-old gives birth in Idaho; Suspected illegal immigrant charged with rape</p>
<p><br>
Bookingphotos A 37-year-old man is charged with raping a 10-year-old girl who gave birth last month in Idaho.</p>
<p>&#8220;St. Anthony Police said they were notified of the young girl&rsquo;s pregnancy by medical personnel after she went in for treatment at a doctor&rsquo;s office,&#8221; KIFI-TV reports on its website. </p>
<p>    http://blogs.usatoday.com/ondeadline/2008/05/10-year-old-giv.html?csp=34</p>
<p>And we Americans are called &#8220;racists&#8221; for not wanting the Mexican trash population <span class="caps">INFESTING </span>our country. Mark my words.  No, not a racist rant   &mdash;   but a bitter truth verifiable all-too-readily, if you pay attention to the news, check the Internet news (horror) stories, and hear what police officer acquaintances can tell you.</p>
<p>One more thing to cogitate over: For every crime (or sex-crime) by a Mexican that hits the news&hellip; <span class="caps">HOW MANY </span>do we <span class="caps">NOT </span>hear about? Locally the media will never comment on a carjacking, much less a burglary or robbery   &mdash;   unless someone got hurt. Because those crimes are simply too commonplace anymore to raise an eyebrow. (Which explains why I carry, and urge everyone to be armed.)</p>

					<p>I would lke to make one more clarification of my position on this issue. First, I withdraw my assertion that someone must sign his real name to earn my respect. If a person wants to use a pseudo-name that`s their business. In fact, I think some of the nom de guerres carry more insight than a real legal name. That being said&hellip;<br>
 For me anyway the story can be summarized thus. A coach, in a position of authority over a child, took away said child`s property and then (according to the child) refused to give it back and ridiculed him in the process in front of his peers. If this is a victory for our side forgive me for not celebrating it. The coach should have in my opinion, acted in the following manner. One, he should have informed the child to quit waving the flag and disrupting class. If the child was incapable of  exhibiting  said self control, the coach should have taken away the flag put it in or behind his desk and given it back after class without further comment. By taking the flag away and then making political comments, the coach engaged the child in discourse as if he was an adult when the boy clearly wasn`t. Also throwing the flag in the trash was clearly meant to either enrage or antagonize  the child or&hellip; I don`t know what. The coach had no right to engage the boy as a man  with verbal sparring no more than he had the right to engage him in fisticuffs. Thus in my opinion the coach was acting as childish as the student. Simply unacceptable. Finally, how many readers who approve of this action would feel good about a policeman tearing off a bumpersticker on their car because it was offensive to the cop. The coach was acting as a bully against someone who couldn`t fight back.<br><br>
 Lastly Ozzie proclaimed that I needed to choose sides in this war or someone would choose sides for me. I am a not only a grown man but somewhat of an overweight one. I make my own decisions&hellip; at least until the rifle ammunition in the hall closet runs out. Thanks for listening </p>

<p><span class="caps">OK. </span> Therefore, this frivolous lawsuit should be immediately dismissed, no matter what the cheap-labor crowd (liberal/neocon alliance) thinks.</p>
<p>If the little spoiled brat is so damned offended, he can choose to live in Mexico, and be inundated with Mexican flags as far as his eyes can see.</p>

					<p>This is a basic case of lack of respect of personal property for someone perceived to be in a subordinate position. You don&rsquo;t just take someone&rsquo;s property and trash it because you disagree with it. We are all human beings and we deserve dignity and respect. That&rsquo;s what I hope some of the people here in Amren will learn. It won&rsquo;t lessen your cause to begin to respect another kind of person.  I am glad that at least Tim Mc Hugh can see this. Believe me he is not any less on your side. </p>
<p>&ldquo;From my travels there are very few places in America that resemble what most of America looked like up until the 80&rsquo;s or even early 90&rsquo;s.&rdquo;<br>
This country doesn&rsquo;t look anything like what American Indians called home either. Times are going to change. As I have said on other threads, White people can not really expect America to be the land of the pearly White because the moral title belongs to Indian people. Before you take my comment completely out of context this has nothing to do with preventing you all from preserving your culture and values. If you dislike the total moral decay of this country then you and I have more alike than you think. Perhaps there are groups that share some of your interests that could partner with you to achieve your goals. Believe it or not there are Black, Latino, and Indian people and organizations that are working to address crime, drug use, and the disintegration of the family. I am one such person. While my traditional values are different from yours for sure I am willing to bet there are points we can agree one. For example I hate the sex, drugs, and violence of the TV these days. As a parent I find it an uphill battle trying to regulate my children&rsquo;s TV and internet use without feeling like a total control freak. In fact I do monitor despite the feeling. I&rsquo;m willing to bet there are others with the same concerns. Instead of racist ranting how you can&rsquo;t figure out how to engage other groups with respect and dignity? However, you first have to get to know us.  <br><br>

					<p>Forget for a moment that the flag was Mexican. I am sure you can imagine several flags where everyone would agree that the student had no business trying to provoke fellow classmates with his flag.</p>
<p>Listen kids, if they can ban the Confederate flag from Old Miss and dozens of other campuses in the South, I know good and well they can refuse to entertain a Mexican flag in the classroom. If the boy did not fish the flag out of the trash can, then the most he should expect is $2.95 from the teacher for the loss of his property. Of course, I rather doubt such payment is routine for all the other items confiscated in the classrooms (and trashed) so no payment may be due at all.</p>
<p>The Mexican kid should learn an important lesson from this experience. (Isn&rsquo;t that why he is going to school?)</p>
<p>As for respecting foreign flags on American soil, I must strongly disagree. Such behavior is considered an act of war&hellip;&hellip;invasion. If we cannot see foreign flags on American soil as invasion, then we no longer have a country, and the next <span class="caps">SOB </span>to plant a foreign flag on this country can rightly claim it. </p>
<p>Oh yes, tell Wal-Mart to stop selling Mexican flags to their customers&hellip;..that would be a good &#8220;first step&#8221;. We can work on the illegal alien problem after that.</p>

					<p>When I went to school I didn&rsquo;t have many teachers that acted like real adults.  There is an old saying, either you teach or you do, those that can&rsquo;t do, teach.  Most teachers that I remember weren&rsquo;t living in the real world, most acted like the students they were teaching, with a few exceptions. It&rsquo;s easy to act like Joe the bad ass to a bunch of kids.  Most teachers, including gym teachers, wouldn&rsquo;t make it with that kind of attitude in a job where you have to actually <span class="caps">WORK </span>to make a living. Blisters on your hands, soaked in sweat everyday, sore back, keep on working.</p>

					<p>&#8220;the teacher&rsquo;s comment about the trash being the only place he could keep the flag is horse*&^% too. Please, he couldn&rsquo;t have stored it in a drawer or taken it to the front office? It&rsquo;s insulting to one&rsquo;s intelligence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Something bothered me about that. I knew the teacher was wrong somehow but I wasn&rsquo;t sure how to explain it. TY for breaking that down for me and putting it into words. </p>

					<p>We have foreign flags in our home: the flags of Ireland, Wales, Scotland, and Germany (the pre-1918 Hohenzollern version) adorn our basement walls, along with the Stars &amp; Bars, the Japanese navy sunburst and a Harvard University flag an uncle stole off a flagpole there.  These are not for display outside, out of sensitivity to our neighbors, but for our own enjoyment and the way they brighten up bare concrete walls.</p>

					<p>&hellip;&hellip;.&#8221;But on <span class="caps">WHAT </span>grounds do they delude themselves that they&rsquo;ve got any kind of a claim to <span class="caps">IDAHO</span>?&#8221;</p>

<p>The fact is that Mexico and Mexicans have no legitimate claim on any <span class="caps">U.S. </span>state or territory.  The entire issue was settled by treaties and payments in the 19th century.  This story is just one of many that illustrate the completely false nature of the &#8220;Reconquesta&#8221; claims.  The entire thing is nothing but a justification for invidividuals from Mexico to do what seems expedient to their own interests.  It&rsquo;s called &#8220;rationalizing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&gt; I have always liked flags too.  They are colorful and relfect history and sometimes personal heritage.  We have 10 flags ourselves and three of the ones you list as in your home.</p>

					<p>Between the ages of two and twenty-one, my parents and I were legal, green card holding, French Canadians residing in the United States. We were proud of our heritage, but we understood that we were guests living in another country. My parents bought a few acres of land where we had a home, and my father worked hard to make sure that our neighbours were happy living beside us. He worked a shift at the mill and would come home and put another four or more hours into the yard. People would go on Sunday drives back then, and I remember seeing folks slow down to marvel at our property while I was playing with friends in the yard. We had a flagpole in the yard, and guess what flag was flying in the yard of the proud, French Canadians? The <span class="caps">AMERICAN </span>flag, Old Glory, the <span class="caps">RED WHITE </span>and <span class="caps">BLUE.</span> We understood the first rule of being a guest; Do honor and respect your hosts. These Mexicans are acting like conquerors not grateful guests. They have no right to fly their flag in your land, or demand that you speak Spanish, unless they are planning to overthrow you. </p>

					<p>To Tim Mc Hugh </p>
<p>My comments about choosing sides was a little over the top, incorrect and counter productive. I apologize about that.</p>
<p>But I guess my point that I was trying to make was, what would happen to an American kid in Mexico waving an American flag? There would certainly be no lawsuit. He would be lucky if the teacher took it from him before alot of people saw him with it. They would certainly beat him to pulp.</p>
<p>The other point is we need to respect our own veterans before we respect others. And when you fly a foreign flag in our land it is disrespectful to our veterans. </p>
<p>So I agree with the teacher. I am glad he threw it in the trash. That should be the norm. Also, all illegals should be rounded up and deported. All magnets that draw them should be dealt with. No more welfare. No more amnesty. No more birthright citizien ship. Companies that hire illegals get seriuosly fined. Their execs do some jail time. Etc.  and if the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>cannot do this peacefully then what does that tell you? A nation that cannot enforce it&rsquo;s own immigration laws is not a nation at all. If we are going down a path of civil war (which no one in their right mind wants), then better sooner then later. The longer it festers the bigger tragedy it will be. </p>
<p>Ok, that was kind of a tangent, but it is all related to the flag incident, because the more numbers that they get, the more disrespectful they become. When they are over 50% of the southwest, why should it stay a part of the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>why not merge with Mexico? After all America &#8216;stole&rsquo; it from them anyways.<br>
