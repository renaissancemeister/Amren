						<p>AUSTRALIA is undergoing an unparalleled movement of people and ethnic change through &ldquo;hidden immigration&rdquo;, but lacks a comprehensive policy to deal with it, according to an eminent demographer.</p>
<p>Monash University professor Andrew Markus said raw immigration numbers masked the magnitude of a demographic revolution that had produced a population where one in four residents was born overseas. </p>
<p>At 24 per cent, the overseas-born proportion of the population is twice that of the US at 12 per cent, and three times that of England and Wales at 8 per cent, where racial tensions have flared again. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Opinion polls in England in July 2007 and March 2008 indicated that immigration and race issues are the main concern of electors,&rdquo; Professor Markus said. </p>
<p>He said that while Australians had been tolerant and migrants committed to their new home, strong political leadership was required to convince the nation of the benefits to all of high immigration to avoid a backlash. </p>
<p>Professor Markus presented his analysis at this week&rsquo;s Australian Davos Connection Future Summit. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The elements of a policy to promote social cohesion within communities characterised by diversity of language and culture are well known &mdash; and difficult to implement,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;At present, Australia lacks full clarity of vision, coherence and consistency &mdash; while the largest movement of people in the country&rsquo;s history is under way.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Speaking to The Australian yesterday, Professor Markus said that although many Australians regarded the rate of immigration as high, they probably had little idea that the transformation was far bigger than they imagined. The usually quoted &ldquo;headline&rdquo; number of permanent arrivals &mdash; people successfully applying each year for permanent residency from overseas &mdash; rose 67 per cent between 1999 and last year, from 84,000 to 140,000. But Professor Markus said this figure failed to include on-shore &ldquo;conversions&rdquo; from foreigners on student or temporary work visas to permanent residence. </p>
<p>That number rose from 15,000 in 1999 to 52,000 last year. Taking those figures into account, the annual increase in new permanent residents nearly doubled over the past nine years, from 99,000 to 192,000. </p>
<p>The number of permanent departures &mdash; Australians leaving the country without any immediate intention of return &mdash; doubled from 35,000 in 1999 to 72,000 last year. </p>
<p>Many of those departing were taking highly sought skills to more highly paid jobs overseas, Professor Markus said. </p>
<p>Added to an ageing population, future economic growth would require filling Australia&rsquo;s skills shortage largely from overseas. But the result would accelerate the pace of ethnic change, and because immigration had been skewed towards &ldquo;magnet&rdquo; destinations, in some areas the transition would be extraordinary, he said. </p>
<p>&ldquo;With the uneven distribution of the overseas born, this translates to 34.5 per cent of Sydney&rsquo;s population, 31 per cent of Melbourne&rsquo;s, and over 70 per cent in some urban localities,&rdquo; Professor Markus said. </p>
<p>He proposed several measures towards a national policy to make immigration work. </p>
<p>These included challenging disadvantage in education and employment, tackling institutional discrimination, and a &ldquo;consistent set of policies to be implemented at the community level to promote inter-cultural understanding, bridge building and participation&rdquo;. <br>

			<p>I was in Oz about a year ago and spoke to many people, including immigrants.  In my experience, the countries of origin of most immigrants were, in descending order:  the UK; NZ; and the US.  Maybe I just didn&rsquo;t get into western Sydney, where most of the third-worlders end up.<br>

			<p>&#8220;Australia currently experiencing a &ldquo;demographic revolution.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>So?  What&rsquo;s new?  Every Western nation is doing the same, and every one of them will implode at some point because of it.  That&rsquo;s not even a point of contention among those who have I.Q&rsquo;s above single digits. </p>

<p>Here we go again! Every single white western country in the whole freaking WORLD seems to have an aging population problem that can only be cured by importing millions of third-worlders. These reporters really need to come up with a new lie, this one has been used to death.</p>

			<p>Lots of people on this board loved former Aussie PM John Howard when he talked tough. But I looked at the data and knew what was really happening in OZ: per capita it has a much higehr rate of immigration than the US does.</p>

<p>&#8216;Ethnic change&rsquo; is ethnic cleansing and displacement of indigenous whites. </p>

			<p>&#8220;I was in Oz about a year ago and spoke to many people, including immigrants. In my experience, the countries of origin of most immigrants were, in descending order: the UK; NZ; and the US. Maybe I just didn&rsquo;t get into western Sydney, where most of the third-worlders end up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although over recent years Australia (like the US, Canada, UK, New Zealand, and Western Europe) has been culturally turned on its head with the influx of third-worlders, there has been a dramatic change in Australia over the last few months, coinciding with the election of KRudd as our (Chinese-speaker) &#8216;leader&rsquo;.  </p>
<p>I live in Sydney and am becoming so concerned about the amount of Indians, black Africans, Muslims, S-E Asians and what seems like countless other &#8216;gems&rsquo; materialising recently that I&rsquo;m becoming consumed in finding a way to cope with this massive change in the social landscape of my city.  It is unrecognisable to the city I grew up in the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
<p>Most of this lot live in the south-western and western suburbs of Sydney.  Tourists don&rsquo;t usually get to share in the joys of having to see these invaders on a daily basis, overloading our trains, having numerous babies, and draining our welfare.</p>
<p>Large parts of Sydney are now foreign terrority to most whites, however, most white Australians appear not to notice what&rsquo;s going on, which is incredible for me to comprehend.  Unfortunately, the majority of white Australians are obsessed with one thing: materialism.  Going hand-in-hand with this is a complete lack of desire to have babies.   </p>
<p>Predictions say that things will get far worse, however, I&rsquo;m not certain whether white people have the fighting spirit that will be required to repel the invaders.   <br>

<p>Translated into plain talk: apparently the nation does not see any benefits for their everyday life, but more the problems. Let&rsquo;s do some more brainwashing.</p>

<p>how about give incentives to native white westerners to have more babies and stop immigration?  or is that just a &#8220;racist&#8221; and &#8220;hateful&#8221; thought?</p>

<p>I disagree. My IQ is above that. These societies will not &#8216;implode&rsquo;. A higher IQ might recognize that it in part this very statement that keeps whites from joining your cause. Why rebuff fellow whites who want to join you? Every white man in America is a WN&rsquo;s at heart, and indeed every civilization across the globe is more than happy to indulge your fantasies of white-supremacy (why remains to be seen) and yet, still, you fail to advance your cause. </p>
<p>Western societies will not &#8216;implode&rsquo; under the weight of immigrants. It&rsquo;s human nature to take ones own demise as a sign of something larger. Non-whites taking over will learn from our mistakes, and our failed resolve. They&rsquo;ll learn from experience to keep out and out murder of whites below a certain limit. The world will continue without us whites, but really, does it make a difference? Does it really make a difference, to us, what the world will be like after we are gone? Perhaps we should focus on an agreeable way to prevent that from happening in the first place? It&rsquo;s not a crime to ask what&rsquo;s best for whites or even an individual white person.</p>
