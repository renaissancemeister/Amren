						<p>A fight between rival groups of black and Latino students at Locke High School quickly escalated into a campus-wide melee Friday, with as many as 600 students brawling until police restored calm with billy clubs.</p>
<p>The troubled campus in South Los Angeles was locked down after the fight broke out at 12:55 p.m., as students returned from lunch to their fifth-period classes. Overwhelmed school officials called Los Angeles police for help, but students and faculty said it took about half an hour before dozens of officers, many in riot gear, restored order.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Los Angeles Unified School District police said that there are only two officers assigned to Locke but that the school police force brought in about 60 officers after receiving word of the brawl. The Los Angeles Police Department also dispatched more than a dozen patrol cars and about 50 officers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The campus at 111th and San Pedro streets has long been one of the city&rsquo;s most troubled. This school year has been particularly difficult, with near-daily fights &mdash; albeit on a much smaller scale &mdash; during much of the fall and winter. Locke is about to be reorganized as a cluster of charter schools run by Green Dot Public Schools, which will take over in July, and some faculty and staff have accused the district of letting the campus drift in its final year as a traditional public school.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But then came Friday&rsquo;s melee, which students and teachers said was by far the worst of the year, perhaps the worst in years.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sherlock, who said he saw police use pepper spray during the melee, said tensions between African American and Latino students have not been a serious problem at the school. With an enrollment of 2,600, Locke is 65% Latino and 35% African American.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not the way it&rsquo;s portrayed in the media; that&rsquo;s not what it&rsquo;s like at all,&#8221; said Sherlock, who is black. Another black student, Ronald White, said African American and Latino students commonly divide along ethnic lines but aren&rsquo;t necessarily hostile. &#8220;Everybody usually just sticks to themselves,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Senior Victor Wong, 18, said the brawl grew out of a fight two days earlier between a Latino student and an African American student. Wong said Latino students who are friends of his asked him to participate in a fight planned for Friday that was to pit 10 Latino students against 10 African American students.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In recent years, melees have broken out periodically at many campuses with a black and Latino presence, including in Los Angeles, Lynwood and Compton. There have been fights between Latinos and Armenians in other areas that led to campus lockdowns.</p>

			<p>I thought the media told us that there were no black-Hispanic tensions in L.A.  E.g.:</p>
<p><i>Sherlock, who said he saw police use pepper spray during the melee, said tensions between African American and Latino students have not been a serious problem at the school.</i></p>
<p>If a 600-person fight that caused a lockdown is an example of &#8220;not serious tensions,&#8221; then what has to happen before Sherlock Holmes thinks it is serious?</p>

<p>Holy Cow! People this not only happened at a HIGH SCHOOL, it involved 600 students and required riot police using clubs to restore &#8220;calm&#8221;!! These were 14, 15, 16 year old kids! The worst thing I saw at my high school was a fist fight between two black guys in the hallway because one stepped on the other&rsquo;s shoe!</p>

			<p>The black activists in Los Angeles, like Earl Ofari Hutchinson, a writer who is stuck in a 1960&rsquo;s time warp, couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to call it a racial brawl, even after the school district itself characterized it as such. The delusions of many black &#8220;leaders&#8221; are not going to help black people at all as time goes by and Mexicans become more brazen against blacks. Of course, I can&rsquo;t say I feel particularly sad, many blacks were responsible for driving white peeple right out of their old neighborhoods because of theft aggressive behavior and other unpleasant things.</p>

			<p>People have been talking about race war for generations now.  The assumption has usually been that war would be between whites and blacks.  And certainly, blacks have been waging de facto low level race war against whites for quite some time now.  Until recently, most whites have been ignorant of this because of a massive coverup by our media.  Thousands of victims and casualties but you simply don&rsquo;t read about it in the newspaper (and if you do, you almost never get the full story).  The internet has made this coverup impossible.  More and more people are learning the truth.  They are starting to ask questions like, how come this wasn&rsquo;t on the front page of today&rsquo;s paper?  After you have THAT experience a few dozen times, you realize there is a serious conspiracy going on.</p>
<p>It is becoming increasingly clear that race war is coming (and soon)&hellip;.but between blacks and hispanics.  And by war, I mean WAR&hellip;.large scale engagements involving hundreds, if not thousand of people armed with guns.  We are seeing the beginnings of this already.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see what reaction this situation will bring among whites, particularly liberals (who are the ones that tend to live near these groups).  The US has become balkanized.  These groups are violent and increasingly depraved.  And there are very real limits to our ability to control them.</p>
<p>Today, a massive deployment of police stopped the violence&hellip;.this time.  But soon, those police are going to show up and be slaughtered by superior numbers.  The result will be a military style deployment.  But that will only be a bandaid.</p>
<p>Our country is going to be FORCED to address this issue.  And there are no good solutions.</p>

			<p>&#8220;How do you build anything here when something happens and adds to the negativity?&#8221; asked band leader Smith. </p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t.  You just prepare for the coming civil conflagration, and they won&rsquo;t need a band leader for that; however, you might keep really busy as an ammo bearer.</p>
<p>Or you might brush up on your communication skills and learn to lie a lot by alleging that everything&rsquo;s fine and you&rsquo;re all part of the people of color bandwagon, then you could be the information officer.<br>

			<p>I wonder for whom &#8220;Locke&#8221;  High School is named?  John Locke?   If so, what would he think if he could read today&rsquo;s news?   Surely he would find it beyond believing.</p>
<p>(I&rsquo;ll bet those &#8220;students&#8221; couldn&rsquo;t tell you who Locke was if you asked them.)</p>
<p>Anyway, with that racial imbalance, it&rsquo;s obviously just a matter of time before it&rsquo;s changed to either Cesar Chavez or Martin Luther King.   Perhaps  Antonio Villaraigosa.  At most ten or fifteen years. Probably half that.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, that choice could be cause for another riot.</p>

			<p>It seems that the Armenians don&rsquo;t like the Hispanics, but it also seems to me they act a lot alike.  I will say that the Armenians are self-consciously White.  You will see the word &#8220;European&#8221; on the signs outside their businesses, and they don&rsquo;t mean Continental.         </p>

<p>Which is a tacit admission that blacks&rsquo; and Latinos&rsquo; memes are incompatible with traditional public schools. They need special treatment, right? So much for the absurd notion that &#8220;race is only a social construct.&#8221; <br>

			<p>Seems like this stuff happens a lot in California between hispanics and black students but also in the prisons between hispanics and black and also white prisoners which is spreading out onto the streets especially between black and hispanic street gangs, if it continues we could be looking at L.A. riots part 2 this team with two sides fighting each other and police.</p>

<p>Um, Armenians are white.  You should thank us for supporting the white cause here in California.  Dukemajian, California&rsquo;s greatest governor, have you heard of him?  I am half white and half Armenian, though I look white I identify as Armenian.  We Armenians are what make this country great-hard working, loyal, industrious, strong, INTEGRATED.  </p>

			<p>I think all these &#8220;kids&#8221; should be locked up in something I call prison school from the age of 12-18. The only time these people learn the three R&rsquo;s is when they are forced to do so by a prison guard. I knew someone who was a corrections officer who told me the first these guys ever picked up a book was in prison because they didnt have the temptation of freedom(women,drugs,sex and mayhem) to distract them. Sad but true.</p>

<p>Maybe not.  With those demographics, the black population is already dwarfed in California.  I think the blacks will just pickup and head east.  Alot of them are already doing just that.</p>

Dear Friend: I have no wish to argue with you, and have nothing against Armenians.  As far as my own opinion is concerned, I consider Armenians to be Caucasians without question.  But do you notice the contradiction in your above statement?</p>

			<p> Armenians most definately are White. They are I believe part of the Mediterranean branch of the White Race. True Hispanics and Latinos are also White. What are called &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; and &#8220;Latinos&#8221; in this country are actually Mestizos, primarily &#8220;Amerindian&#8221;, wich is a branch of the Mongoloid Race.<br>
   Eventually the larger numbers of so called &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; will absorb the Black population, this is what happened to the Black population in Latin America. They were called &#8220;Mayates&#8221;, by the Mexicans and have been almost entirely absorbed into the Mongrel population of Mexico, thier history and identity as a distinct people long forgotten.</p>

			<p>In terms of appearance, Armenians generally resemble southern Europeans, especially Greeks or southern Italians. They are virtually all Christian and speak an Indo-European language. Armenians were the backbone of the Byzantine army and formed a major component of the Christian forces in the Crusades. Armenia may not technically be in Europe, but it is on the border. <br>
There are strong rivalries between the Armenian community and Hispanic gangs. In the late 80s or early 90s when Armenians from the former Soviet Union started emigrating to LA, some young Armenian immigrants started a gang called Armenian Power to protect themselves against Hispanic gangs that were picking on them. <br>
Currently, Armenian organized crime tends to be more focused on fraud (medicare, credit cards, etc.) than on drugs or violence. AP and the organized crime groups represent a small minority of the population but they have given the whole group a bad reputation. <br>
That leads to the conclusion that people are more willing to talk about the &#8220;bad apples&#8221; in a small White ethnic group than about the much larger and deeper-rooted gang and violent crime problems among the Hispanic and Black populations. <br>
I am not a white nationalist by any means, but I don&rsquo;t like that sort of hypocrisy and double standards.</p>

			<p>Mick is correct, and furthermore, Armenians were the first Christians and suffered greatly because of it. The Armenians I went to school with many moons ago, were decent people,from decent, well educated families who were successful in whatever occupation they were involved in.</p>

<p>Very well, I&rsquo;ll still bet most of those students couldn&rsquo;t tell you who Locke was if you asked them.  But they could tell you who LL Cool J is, no doubt.<br>

			<p>The poster at 10:10 p.m. is exactly right. The blacks are moving east just ahead of the wave of Mexicans moving east. For some reason, a lot of blacks are deciding on North Carolina, specifically Charlotte, as one of the go to places in the east. Mexicans are already moving into Arkansas, Louisiana, even some into the real black stronghold of MS, but they have a long way to go there. Even while blacks are STILL crowing about whites dwindling in this country they are losing at least some of their stranglehold. They may eventually ask whites for help..which of course they&rsquo;ll get.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t bet on it.  Isn&rsquo;t it odd that you don&rsquo;t have this kind of thing going on against Whites or any other racial group?  Sure, you have hispanic crime against Whites but not open urban warfare like this.  This is one of the residual benefits of mass immigration and lax border controls being carried out with the complacency of both political parties and the US Government. This isn&rsquo;t just about saving the White ruling class of Mexico, it&rsquo;s about the total elimination of black political and economic clout.  The last gasp of black America.  As one of many victims of black crime, all I can say is you&rsquo;ve got this coming to you.<br>

			<p>Student Sherlock actually has the cajones to say he&rsquo;s seen several fights, but nothing as bad as the 600-student fight. Then, he says it&rsquo;s not as bad as the media make it out to be.</p>
<p>Thewy weren&rsquo;t having a pep rally, if it took over 100 police to quell a disturbance involving 600 students.</p>
<p>Student Sherlock also says, &#8220;everybody sticks to themselves&#8221;. What a surprise! Maybe the school need to make Hispanics and Bantus to sit side by side in the cafeteria.It might promote greater interracial understanding.</p>
<p>I note nobody is saying this is a racial incident. That&rsquo;s because no Caucasians were involved.</p>
<p>The school administration should hold an assembly, at which &#8220;Kumbaya&#8221; must be sung in Spanish and Swahili. That might help these races to get along, as well. </p>
