						<p>The United States is facing a major obstacle in its efforts to deport thousands of illegal immigrants, including many convicted felons: Their home countries don&rsquo;t want them back.</p>
<p>[Sen. Arlen] Specter was stunned at the situation after touring several prisons in his home state of Pennsylvania, where taxpayer dollars are paying to house foreigners who have served their sentences but could not be deported. In response, he drafted legislation that would punish countries that refuse to take back illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He noted that once convicted felons serve their sentences in the U.S., they can be held for only six months before they are released into the general public.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The proposed legislation would require the Department of Homeland Security to report to Congress every 90 days on the countries that refuse repatriation. Those nations would automatically be denied all immigrant visas until they take their citizens back. The measure would also deny certain foreign aid to the countries.</p>
<p>As of February, at least eight countries were refusing to take back 139,000 illegal immigrants the U.S. has ordered deported, according to Specter&rsquo;s office: Vietnam, Jamaica, China, India, Ethiopia, Laos, Eritrea and Iran. They include 18,000 convicted felons.</p>

					<p>I am just really amazed that &#8220;we&#8221; aren&rsquo;t bringing their families here to the <span class="caps">USA </span>and supporting them so they could visit their loved ones in prison till they get totatly out of the jail system. </p>

					<p>Arlen Specter? Oh, now all of a sudden he sees the light? Whoopee! No, he doesn&rsquo;t.  He is a psuedo-repub in the first place and helped with the amnesty bill he so loves. So their countries won&rsquo;t take them back, heh? Send them all on a remote-controlled jet and their countries will have to shoot them down themselves and the blame is all on them. Why do we put up with the dictates of these 3rd world tin pot rulers in the first place? <span class="caps">STOP </span>all aid and trade with any country that does not take their own people back and <span class="caps">SEW </span>up the border <span class="caps">NOW</span>!</p>

					<p> One of my main arguments for years has been that as long as we refuse to demand respect for our borders we would become the dumping ground for all the human garbage all over the world.<br>
 I personally cannot blame these countries for not wanting the criminals back. The United States will not lift a finger against them and therfore it&rsquo;s a win- win situation for them.</p>

					<p>Just put them in small boats outside the 3 mile limit.  Or, in the case of landlocked countries, drop them by parachute.  No negotiations, no compromise.  If they want to make a stink, slap a 50% tariff on imports.  Of course, our Masters will never do this, which is another reason we owe no allegiance to the <span class="caps">USSA.</span></p>

					<p>A far simpler solution would be to simply fly a plane over the offending country and kick deportees out the door wearing a parachute.  After that, it&rsquo;s their problem.</p>

					<p>Excuse me, &#8220;punish&#8221;?!</p>
<p>We should use our Armed Forces to forcefully deliver the deportees to their countries of origin, if these countries refuse to take them back. Period.<br>

					<p>The title is perhaps misleading with &#8220;May&#8221;.  Surely The <span class="caps">USA </span>every right to inflict some sort of penalty on a nation that refuses to take back its own citizens.  It needs discussing in the UN (the talk, talk, talk, shop) to legalise the procedure in everybody&rsquo;s mind, and then enacting by simply taking them by boat or plane and &#8220;dumping&#8221; them.  </p>
<p>Initially, just take them to the particular country&rsquo;s embassy and do the same as the embassies are by international agreement the soil of that country.   All that needs doing then is to guard the embassy so they cannot escape.  The country concerned will soon get the message especially when the overspill into the streets is evident.  </p>
<p>Tough decisions need tough actions.</p>
<p>The big problem is that the rest of the world, especially those that wanted their freedom from Western colonial rule, cannot now support the citizens by exercising good government and administration.  They have the cake but cannot eat it.  They must learn quickly as in many minds the intention is to take over the West and subjugate it.  After all many nations have given into terrorism before and set the precedent.</p>

					<p>Why..why do we need immigrants from these countries? Isnt 300 million enough? How long ago was 1970? The population has almost doubled in 35 years. And now we need more immigrants?<br>
More Algerian technical students with the gleam of Islamic hatred in their eyes? More Mexicans with 4th grade educations? <br><br>
More Guatemalans with 6 kids in tow? More Nigerians with <span class="caps">AIDS</span>?</p>
<p>When will the madness stop?</p>

					<p>If Reagan were president he&rsquo;d propose sending our criminals to them. That would get them to shut up in a hurry. What we need is someone like Douglas Macarthur as president. </p>

					<p>Western countries are considered a soft touch by third-world banana republics like Jamaica whose biggest exports is, always has been, &amp; always will be criminals &amp; coconuts. btw, why do blacks endeavour to gain entry to majority white countries &amp; live beside those &#8216;evil white racists?&rsquo; Denying them immigration visas &amp; foreign aid would quickly bring these tinpot banana republics to their knees &amp; lighten the financial load for the taxpayers by getting rid of these foreign freeloaders.</p>

<p>Not too bad of an idea, I must say. But, first we should make a big  effort to get their home country to take them back. Give them a time limit, like 30 days. That way, when one of these illegals bounces, as one inevitably will, we can blame their home country for not taking them back and forcing us to follow this course! Oh yeah, we should also bill them for the use of the plane and the parachute.</p>

					<p>Jamaica is the worst. By far. 60 % of Canadian violent crime comes from Jamaicans that enter under a Commonwealth passport.<br>
I can think of several mass shootings here in the <span class="caps">USA </span>by Jamaicans..Malvo the Beltway sniper being one. The entire national psyche of Jamaica is an almost religious hatred of the &#8220;white oppressors&#8221; The national Rastafarian cult is built on seeing themselves in a war with whites. As for their self rule the past 50 years, its the same old black story, massive debt, no education, and a per capita <span class="caps">GDP </span>of $2500 a year.<br><br>
All put together, the cultic indoctrination, the poverty and the self pity focuses on one thing..the white man is a legitimate target.</p>

<p>A country for a small family.  Adult male is a white US felon who&rsquo;s old profession was as the best research chemist in the world in the microelectronics industry.  Adult female is Japanese.  Minor child.  Coilgun, 82 conventional firearms and 40,000 rounds of ammunition, furniture and machine tools must accompany.</p>
<p>Nobody would take us! A breakup of the <span class="caps">USSA </span>into minicountries would be good for most people, but perfect for us.</p>

					<p>If America won&rsquo;t deport them before they enter our penal system I cannot blame a nation for not wanting them back after they are no longer of &#8220;value&#8221; to the <span class="caps">US.</span></p>
<p>When the US govt looks the other way to allow them to work they are treating them as citizens even though they are not.  The reason they aren&rsquo;t citizens is because of the huge outcry against it by the common man.  This is like a common law marriage.  A common law marriage of convenience.</p>

He must have been shocked beyond belief&hellip;.so Mr Specter&hellip;..take those morons, that MY tax money pays for&hellip;.and take them to the nearest air force base&hellip;.put them on a plane and dump them out over the Atlantic&hellip;.with no parachute&hellip;.they are nothing but crazy animals anyhow&hellip;no great loss to the human race&hellip;.like drowning a mad dog&hellip;.</p>

   <br><br>
     That was the policy of the Turkish Empire of old where criminals were used as frontline shock troops in war. </p>
<p>    These criminals should be given guns and be told to charge at the Iraqi resistance fighters. Helicopter gun ships and tanks behind their backs would ensure they follow orders. Those running back should be gunned down (like what the communists did to those unfortunate Soviet soldiers in the movie &lsquo;Enemy at the Gates&rsquo;)<br>

Yes, the precedent is being considered, it IS possible to repatriate these foreign thugs, whether the motherland wants them or not.
