						<p>This is an amazing story. The Democratic Party has a winner. It has a nominee. You know this because he has the most votes and the most elected delegates, and there&rsquo;s no way, mathematically, his opponent can get past him. Even after the worst two weeks of his campaign, he blew past her by 14 in North Carolina and came within two in Indiana.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got this thing. {snip}</p>
<p>The Democratic Party can&rsquo;t celebrate the triumph of Barack Obama because the Democratic Party is busy having a breakdown. You could call it a breakdown over the issues of race and gender, but its real source is simply Hillary Clinton. Whose entire campaign at this point is about exploiting race and gender.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the first place an outsider could see the tensions that have taken hold: on CNN Tuesday night, in the famous Brazile-Begala smackdown. Paul Begala wore the smile of the 1990s, the one in which there is no connection between the shape of the mouth and what the mouth says. All is mask. Donna Brazile was having none of it.</p>
<p>Mr. Begala more or less accused the Obama people of not caring about white voters: &#8220;[If] there&rsquo;s a new Democratic Party that somehow doesn&rsquo;t need or want white working-class people and Latinos, well, count me out.&#8221; And: &#8220;We cannot win with eggheads and African Americans.&#8221; That, he said, was the old, losing, Dukakis coalition.</p>
<p>&#8220;Paul, baby,&#8221; Ms. Brazile, who is undeclared, began her response, &#8220;we need to not divide and polarize the Democratic Party.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. So stop the divisions. Stop trying to split us into these groups, Paul, because you and I know .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. how Democrats win, and to simply suggest that Hillary&rsquo;s coalition is better than Obama&rsquo;s, Obama&rsquo;s is better than Hillary&rsquo;s &mdash; no. We have a big party, Paul.&#8221; And: &#8220;Just don&rsquo;t divide me and tell me I cannot stand in Hillary&rsquo;s camp because I&rsquo;m black, and I can&rsquo;t stand in Obama&rsquo;s camp because I&rsquo;m female. Because I&rsquo;m both.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Don&rsquo;t start with me, baby.&#8221; Finally: &#8220;It&rsquo;s our party, Paul. Don&rsquo;t say my party. It&rsquo;s our party. Because it&rsquo;s time that we bring the party back together, Paul.&#8221;</p>
<p>In case you didn&rsquo;t get what was behind that exchange, Mrs. Clinton spent this week making it clear. In a jaw-dropping interview in USA Today on Thursday, she said, &#8220;I have a much broader base to build a winning coalition on.&#8221; As evidence she cited an Associated Press report that, she said, &#8220;found how Sen. Obama&rsquo;s support among working, hard-working Americans, white Americans, is weakening again, and how whites in both states who had not completed college were supporting me.&#8221;</p>
<p>White Americans? Hard-working white Americans? &#8220;Even Richard Nixon didn&rsquo;t say white,&#8221; an Obama supporter said, &#8220;even with the Southern strategy.&#8221;</p>
<p>If John McCain said, &#8220;I got the white vote, baby!&#8221; his candidacy would be over. And rising in highest indignation against him would be the old Democratic Party.</p>
<p>To play the race card as Mrs. Clinton has, to highlight and encourage a sense that we are crudely divided as a nation, to make your argument a brute and cynical &#8220;the black guy can&rsquo;t win but the white girl can&#8221; is &mdash; well, so vulgar, so cynical, so cold, that once again a Clinton is making us turn off the television in case the children walk by.</p>
<p>&#8220;She has unleashed the gates of hell,&#8221; a longtime party leader told me. &#8220;She&rsquo;s saying, &lsquo;He&rsquo;s not one of us.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>She is trying to take Obama down in a new way, but also within a new context. In the past he was just the competitor. She could say, &#8220;All&rsquo;s fair.&#8221; But now he&rsquo;s the competitor who is going to be the nominee of his party. And she is still trying to do him in. And the party is watching.</p>

We are crucially divided as nation. The marxists are upset becasuse Hillary addressed &#8220;white people&#8221;. She recognized us as &#8220;white people&#8221;. This isn&rsquo;t about splitting the party ..or having one last dig at Obama. This is about HIllary acknowledging the collective ethnic interests of &#8220;white people&#8221;.<br><br>
It might lead to white people thinking &#8220;hey, I am part of a people that have our own interests.&#8221; and that is what scares our opposition. </p>

					<p>Would these be the same hardworking white voters who were absolutely appalled by her &#8220;Hillarycare&#8221; health plan in 1993?</p>
<p>The fact that she was mathematically eliminated from the nomination by a white-hating, America-hating mulatto speaks volumes about both the state of the Democratic party and what hard-working whites really think of Hillary.</p>

					<p>Too bad she this wasn&rsquo;t her tune 15 years ago. It&rsquo;s time for liberals to get used to hearing the word &#8216;white&rsquo; because that is how things are going to break down in the near future.</p>

					<p>To play the race card as Mrs. Clinton has, to highlight and encourage a sense that we are crudely divided as a nation, to make your argument a brute and cynical &ldquo;the black guy can&rsquo;t win but the white girl can&rdquo; is &mdash; well, so vulgar, so cynical, so cold, that once again a Clinton is making us turn off the television in case the children walk by.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am <span class="caps">VERY </span>surprised to hear that coming from Clinton.  Perhaps I should not be considering just how badly she has been stabbed in the back by both the far left and the black community.</p>
<p>What the article fails to understand or rather what the writer of the article desperately wants to deny is that she can win with that strategy.  There is a <span class="caps">REASON </span>voter turnout has been so low in elections for generations now.  That reason is no candidate has chosen to do what they should should be doing&hellip;..represent <span class="caps">WHITE </span>interests.  Were that to change.  It would change&hellip;..everything.</p>
<p>The time is ripe for it, I think.  Liberalism is, increasingly, being revealed as not only a lie&hellip;.but evil.  And multiculturalism is one of their most potent tools for harming people&hellip;.mostly whites.  There is a limit.  A limit to how many can be raped, robbed, murdered and assaulted by racist blacks and hispanics before whites realize that, as a group, they are evil and a threat to us.  And that their claims of racism are foul lies.  People are waking up to this.  Waking up to the fact that they&rsquo;ve been tricked.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, only a few people understood this and they were pariahs.  Today, everyone I know knows this (and I live in ultraliberal New Jersey&hellip;I can just imagine what it&rsquo;s like where the rednecks live).  People talk <span class="caps">OPENLY </span>about this.  And those conversations often include the n-word, not in unreasoning hatred but in well deserved anger.</p>
<p>Clinton <span class="caps">SHOULD </span>come out openly in support of white issues.  If she does and gets away with it, she could take the nomination from Obama and she could win against McCain.  Liberalism and multiculturalism and support for blacks, hispanics and open borders would be dead in this country.</p>
<p>Hell, I despise her almost as much as I despise Obama.  But, I&rsquo;d vote for her over McCain.</p>

<p>The Democratic party has tried and tried to sweep the race issue under the rug but here it comes out with a vengence and the mere mention of it threatens to destroy party unity.  This is the result of promoting non-Whites in almost every sector of society at the expense of Whites.  Working class Whites will not be able forget the race issue as long as it is pushed in their faces everywhere they look.</p>
<p>The Democrats are proving to be very fun to watch this season.  Hillary&rsquo;s words have shown the world an uncomfortable truth about her party.  Look for more division as the Democratic National Convention draws closer unless Hillary can be persuaded to drop out of the race.</p>

<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be the cruelest irony that Hillary Clinton might just get elected, if she keeps on talking like this. Of all the groups she has pandered to, she finally found the one that nobody has pandered to in a long time, and one that is starving for it and willing to believe it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget that <i>talking</i> is not <i>acting</i>. She will say anything and do anything to get elected. What she would do to us once she got into office wouldn&rsquo;t be allowed on TV unless it were pay-per-view.</p>

<p>Well, maybe he should have!</p>
<p>Maybe that heir of : &ldquo;McCarthyism,&rdquo; &ldquo;racism,&rdquo; and patriotism, should have smelled the coffee brewing for the 80s and 90s?</p>
<p>Maybe he should have heard, in his unmitigated historic &ldquo;foresight,&rdquo; the sirens&rsquo; call of multicultural madness for what it was, Marxism repackaged and called &ldquo;progress,&rdquo; and rejected it? Instead of continuing his détente with the Reds in less uncomfortable &ldquo;retirements&rdquo; than his own?</p>
<p>He rehabilitated himself, he did indeed?</p>
<p>Yet?</p>
<p>&ldquo;If John McCain said, &lsquo;I got the white vote, baby!&rsquo; his candidacy would be over. And rising in highest indignation against him would be the old Democratic Party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he does, in so many ways, he does.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t say it, he condescendingly asks: &lsquo;where else could you go? And if you could, you would never pick lettuce for $ 15.00 an hour, once you got there&hellip;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thus, is the state of the party of Nixon, and dare I say, Reagan and Goldwater too?</p>
<p>Sorry <span class="caps">MS.</span> Comrade Noonan,</p>

					<p>I don&rsquo;t think she played the race card.  I think she was tippytoeing around it, and thought she was safe refering to white people, but the truth is that whites can&rsquo;t even use the word &#8220;white&#8221; anymore.  We are told to simply pretend we are colorblind.</p>

					<p>Imagine saying the word &#8216;White&rsquo;!  It is atrocious!  Of course it was a woman that said it.  That&rsquo;s not so bad.  Women are victims.  Imagine a White heterosexual male referring to his <span class="caps">OWN </span>race.  Imagine.  Obama and Clinton.  Don&rsquo;t be surprised if Hillary winds up on the ticket as Obama&rsquo;s running mate.  The controlled media loves displaying a Black man next to a White woman   &mdash;   in any context whatsoever.  The ultimate triumph for the media and the liberals and the multiculturalists is for a Black man to have a White woman (with blond hair) as a running mate.  It is the media&rsquo;s  dream soon to become a reality.  Embrace it folks!  It&rsquo;s going to wake up a lot of us palefaces.<br>

<p>Hilarious. I actually thought her comments were rather mild. Of course, this is an era in which we can&rsquo;t utter even the mildest truths about race. Except, pundits <span class="caps">CAN </span>point out that 90% of the black vote is going to Obama, as long as they do so in purely statistical terms. That&rsquo;s all right. But as soon as we say that a certain percentage of whites might actually want to vote for another white, and that such a thing is perfectly understandable, then its outrageous. Hillary just lost her beloved title as the country&rsquo;s &ldquo;first black first lady.&rdquo;</p>

A few weeks ago Hillary was asked point-blank in a debate if she thought Obama could win, and she answered &#8220;yes .  .  . yes &hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>But with these more recent comments, she is essentially saying that she doesn&rsquo;t think Obama can win.  In the fall when Obama  leads the Democrats to defeat, she&rsquo;ll be able to say &#8220;I told you so.&#8221; Then, she might be seen as the more competent leader in the party.</p>

					<p>By uttering the seldom heard &#8220;white&#8221; word, Hillary has officially announced that such people actually exist. However, when the chips are down as in her case, she had no alternative but to play her ace card for a desperate last play at winning the hand. </p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really matter who wins the contest because this public display is for entertainment purposes only.  In reality, &#8220;presidents are selected, not elected.&#8221; We just don&rsquo;t know who has been given the tap on the shoulder yet.</p>

This election year   &mdash;   as ghastly as it&rsquo;s been to watch unfold, and as mind-blowingly, race-riotously <span class="caps">HORRIFIC </span>as it might yet get before the year is out   &mdash;   has nevertheless forced racial issues to the forefront. It&rsquo;s impossible to hold a high-profile mass-media slug-fest between a white woman and a black (or black-ish) man and <span class="caps">NOT </span>mention racial issues. </p>
<p>This is a good thing for folks who think the way we do. </p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s but one thing I&rsquo;m sure <span class="caps">EVERY</span> AmRen regular would agree on, it&rsquo;s that white issues   &mdash;   and indeed <span class="caps">ANY </span>sort of racial-consciousness among &#8220;People of Non-Color&#8221;   &mdash;   are routinely sidelined by the <span class="caps">MSM.</span> Sidelined, that is, when they&rsquo;re not being demonized. </p>
<p>As other posters have noted, this &#8220;outburst&#8221; of Hillary&rsquo;s is nothing more than the shocking nature of a white person talking about white people in public. That this harmless, factual, demonstrable   &mdash;   and indeed, <span class="caps">OBVIOUS </span>  &mdash;   remark of hers about her white support should become the subject of analysis and speculation, proves my point. </p>
<p>The Obamalamadingdong camp   &mdash;   which of course includes 99% of the <span class="caps">MSM </span>  &mdash;   goes into shocked-and-offended &#8220;How <span class="caps">DARE </span>you?&#8221; mode every time anybody utters the word &#8220;white.&#8221; </p>
<p>Well, when it&rsquo;s said by anybody <span class="caps">WHITE,</span> I mean. </p>
<p>A white person saying the W-word is now considered <span class="caps">ALMOST </span>as bad as a white person saying the N-word   &mdash;   and we all know there&rsquo;s <span class="caps">NOTHING </span>worse than a white person saying the N-word. (According to TV bounty hunter &#8220;Dog&#8221; Chapman, saying the N-word was &#8220;the worst thing he&rsquo;d ever done in his life&#8221;   &mdash;   worse, even, than any violence he&rsquo;d ever been involved with.) </p>
<p>The charismatic young Senator from Indonesia   &mdash;   oops, sorry, Illinois   &mdash;   has said he wants &#8220;a national conversation on race.&#8221; Yet as soon as one begins, he and his operatives try to shut it down   &mdash;   or at least dictate the terms of what may or may not be said. Mr. Jared Taylor has also been trying to promote such a conversation on race since he launched his American Renaissance magazine some 18 years ago. Mr. Taylor has never tried to silence anybody   &mdash;   and has fastidiously stuck to verifiable facts over smears and namecalling   &mdash;   yet has been, by turns, ignored and vilified for his noble efforts at truth-telling. </p>
<p>In a classic case of &#8220;Be careful what you wish for,&#8221; it now appears that Comrade Barry may be getting his &#8220;race conversation&#8221; after all. Unfortunately for him, it&rsquo;s not going to be the one-sided, didactic, and prescriptive &#8220;dialog&#8221; that The Great Non-White Hope had in mind. In the white race&rsquo;s present politically-correct predicament, <span class="caps">ANYTHING </span>that gets white people thinking and talking about the forbidden subject of Breathing While Caucasian will only help to keep us Caucasians breathing. <br>

					<p>White People have unique interests of their own.</p>
<p>Once a simple bumper sticker statement has made it&rsquo;s way into the general public consciousness everything will change. It has to be simple, something people can get their minds around and reinforce with matrix emotions. Propaganda, yes. The intelligent analysis, detail and explanation come afterward. It&rsquo;s just the way people are!</p>
<p>A statement like &#8220;White people have unique interests of their own&#8221; shouldn&rsquo;t be controversial. It shouldn&rsquo;t offend any reasonable person. It&rsquo;s a simple leap; a beachhead once entrenched, everything comes easy; like a password on your computer, once known and used everything opens before you.</p>
<p>Hillary&rsquo;s obvious attempt to find the intellectual formulation, the password, that would be simple, emotionally strong, and at the same time politically correct, is good news indeed! It has to come from a respectable source like her. It seems so difficult to us, so far, but it&rsquo;s really just an &#8216;Aha&rsquo; insight that could grab White People almost overnight in seemingly mass mystical experience. &#8220;Yes, it&rsquo;s alright to believe Whites have unique interests all of their own.&#8221; Once they could say that, everything would be different, and much would follow. </p>
<p>Hillary&rsquo;s attempt is fumbling and may fail, but it&rsquo;s a start; the next person may find the right phrase, password, under better  circumstances and succeed.</p>
<p>White salvation may come from a different direction than we expect, maybe from someone like Hillary as a leader. The character in Orwell&rsquo;s &#8216;1984&rsquo; speculated that any hope of over turning his nightmare world would have to come from the &#8216;proletariat&rsquo;. Don&rsquo;t forget that Communism was defeated by the working class unions in Poland. The key is separating the White working class from the non-whites thrown together in a unnatural, incongruous way. Their interests don&rsquo;t correspond.</p>
<p>Upton Sinclair&rsquo; novel &#8220;The Jungle&#8221;, describes how Blacks were brought in to break the Chicago labor strikes. The White working class has unique interests, but they&rsquo;re made impotent by parasite non-white ethnocentric groups that care only about their own group interests. Ever since then, Labor (and the left) has lost it&rsquo;s way.</p>
<p>But aren&rsquo;t I giving opportunistic Hillary too much credit? Yes and no. People are complex. They express contradictory opinions when they&rsquo;re with their church friends and when they&rsquo;re with their barroom buddies. They&rsquo;re not necessessily being hypocritical; The ambiance makes them sincere on each occasion. An idea can &#8216;dry up&rsquo; because it can go nowhere, or it can come to life when it will get a hearing. All of humanity is in each person. A hundred years ago almost everyone believed in White survival. What&rsquo;s different today? The opportunity to fight for that. But it&rsquo;s still there in the minds of virtually all White People, only in a dormant but live potential.   </p>

					<p>Perhaps I should run for President.</p>
<p>As President, I would order all foreign aid money and UN contributions impounded (a President can do this, and the money can not be spent until he relents).  I would issue blanket pardons to everyone convicted of having violated state or city handgun or &#8220;assault&#8221; weapons bans (on those charges alone).  I would issue blanket pardons for anyone convicted of violating the 1932, 1968 and 1986 National Firearms Acts (on those charges alone).  I would order the Mexican border sealed, wired and mined, except for a few easily-policed roads.  I would request Congress to overhaul the tax system as the total tax burden on the average American family, as a proportion of their income, doubled between 1963 and 1988.  I would press for cutbacks in the US army, by reducing forces deployed in Europe.  The surplus US Army personnel would be transferred to <span class="caps">ICE </span>for mass-roundups and expulsions of some 40 million illegal aliens here.  I would ask the Iraqis to hold plebiscite elections so they can partition a country that can not be fixed, and retain US forces there only until that was done, and no longer than that.  I would press for charges of crimes against humanity being filed at The Hague for &#8220;deliberate importation of alien peoples with the intention of displacing native peoples&#8221; for pro-fourth-world-immigration government officials and clergy in every developed state, even ours (yes, this is recognized as a crime against humanity, as it is related to genocide).  I would make khaki pants, polo shirts and loafers my daily dress, because as President, I would be in office to work, not to look like a Gentleman&rsquo;s Quarterly model.</p>
<p>I do not think the <span class="caps">USSA </span>is ready for either a convicted felon in the White House or a Japanese First Lady.</p>
<p>One Australian friend suggests that I should just be Dictator of the World instead.  I doubt that is an elected office.</p>

					<p>&#8220;The controlled media loves displaying a Black man next to a White woman  &mdash;  in any context whatsoever. The ultimate triumph for the media and the liberals and the multiculturalists is for a Black man to have a White woman (with blond hair) as a running mate. It is the media&rsquo;s dream soon to become a reality. Embrace it folks! It&rsquo;s going to wake up a lot of us palefaces.&#8221;</p>
<p>   -You hit the nail right on the head here! Yet having them both on the same ticket is not even neccessary. All they need is to place a Black male in the White House and this symbolism will already be driven home. America <span class="caps">ITSELF </span>is symbolic of the White female, so by &#8220;picking&#8221; Obama, the symbolism of the White female choosing the Black male will already be made.Even more strongly so, since Obama himself is the product of the White female choosing the  Black male. Twisted stuff, but this is all part of the pathology of these death throes that White America is going through.<br>

<p></p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t that the point of her saying what she did?  She is testing the waters to see if calling black people what they are, especially their leaders, like Obama, would in fact win her the election.</p>
<p>I think the answer to that question is yes.  Alot has changed since the days of David Duke.  It&rsquo;s not obvious because our media is so tightly controlled.  Whites (all whites) are right on the cusp of racial consciousness.  It won&rsquo;t take much to crystallize this for the vast majority.  Obama doesn&rsquo;t realize it, but he is the catalyst.</p>

					<p>Why is it that we can talk openly about &ldquo;the black vote&rdquo;, but using the word &ldquo;white&rdquo; causes a scandal?</p>
<p>Posted by at 11:05 PM on May 9 </p>
<p><br>
<span class="caps">EXACTLY</span>!  White people are not supposed to have any needs as a separate people.  We are supposed to be quiet and invisible, pay our taxes and politely hand over our forefather&rsquo;s country to non-whites.  You see, the People Who Run The World Behind The Scenes have decided whites are rather difficult to dominate, for various reasons.  It is easier to dominate lower IQ types who cannot understand abstract concepts nor are inventive.  </p>
<p>Once our numbers are down to 5% of the world population, and then down to 2%, do you think the media will be talking about what a tragedy it is to lose the wonderful white race?  They would definitely be lamenting this, of course, if it were any other race.  </p>

					<p>To Bobby, regarding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;John <span class="caps">PM, </span>correction, McCain said Americans wouldn&rsquo;t pick lettuce for fifty dollars an hour. I double checked the sources. Yes, he is that vile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, he is that vile and I understand this fully!</p>
<p>Please reread my paraphrase of what he said again; it was intended to be sardonic and humorous. Well, darkly humorous at any rate, given the sheer abysmal nature of this election. That fifty dollar crack was so disgusting and arrogant, it is beyond all belief. I went to school for 2 years beyond college and make about 60% of that amount an hour. I am not complaining mind you, only setting up the punch-line so to speak.</p>
<p>This being that this pig-dog McCain, will likely win this election on the backs of whites; yet he hates us so much, that he thinks we wouldn&rsquo;t pick lettuce for fifty dollars an hour and feels this would warrant his disgusting amnesty positions? </p>
<p>With this in mind, with this snide and hatefully arrogant remark fully recognized as his contempt for all white Americans, we should always hold a blood liable against the sewer that is Vietnam.</p>
<p>We should hold it against them, because they didn&rsquo;t put him down when they had the chance, and spare us his current graces. That omission can be seen as an act of warfare by stealth, should he become our next El Presidente.</p>
<p>And for that, we should drop 50 nuclear bombs on them once every year, on the anniversary of his return to our soil!<br>

<p>Everyone should go back and read this excellent post.  You might not agree with all of it, but that&rsquo;s no matter.  Well done anonymous, and may I humbly suggest you choose a name to post under, just so we can refer to you as something other than, anonymous.  It gives you at least some kind of identity.  And this whole thing does seem to be about a quest for identity; as opposed to our enemies trying to eliminate our identity.</p>
<p>But the one great thing you helped me see is that the writer is over doing it, which suggests panicking.  As you said, the <span class="caps">WSJ </span>writer has a hard time dealing with the fact that Hillary could win on this issue of openly identifying with Whites.  Just look at the adjectives and other words she uses to describe Hillary&rsquo;s mere mention of Whites (Never mind that the <span class="caps">MSM </span>can refer to Obama as a &#8220;Black Prince&#8221; and routinely refer to him with the politically correct &#8220;African-American&#8221; even though he is half White). &#8220;Vulgar&#8221; &#8220;Crude&#8221; &#8220;Brute&#8221; &#8220;Cynical&#8221; etc.  Wow, Ann Coulter was right, women <span class="caps">ARE </span>too vicious.  But I would like to use a word or two to describe Noonan, &#8220;Self-Righteous&#8221; &#8220;Hysterical&#8221; &#8220;Hypocritical&#8221; &#8220;Deluded&#8221; &#8220;Kept&#8221; &#8220;Bought and Paid for&#8221; &#8220;Organ-grinders dancing monkey&#8221; &#8220;Journalistic Assassin.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, let us not forget&hellip;. Whites today are not allowed to identify as White.  That is a quote from the late Mr. Rasberry, the Black Journalist who said there was no reason under any circumstance that Whites should be permitted to free assembly, none.</p>
<p><span class="caps">THIS </span>is what it&rsquo;s about. I was surprised this came from Peggy Noonan, but it did.  The Power Elite she works for absolutely do not want us gathering, aside from the harmless AR Conference or two.  But if we were to get behind Hillary, and she is the <span class="caps">ONLY </span>reasonable choice (sorry folks), then the Power Elite would probably get out the <span class="caps">SWAT</span> Team and Police Dogs and Riot Gear, etc.  I have no doubt about it.  And <span class="caps">ARE </span>eventually going to organize, and when we do, this is what will happen.  </p>

<p>The finalists will be Obama and McCain. So there is a black and a white canditate. Maybe the racial loyalty will make white democrats not to vote unless there is no white vice-president. So the next vice president is <span class="caps">HRC.</span></p>
<p>There are two after election scenaria. Obama will not denounce his christianity. This will spell him troubles as he has left islam. Leaving islam is a crime punishable by death. Another scenarium is that Obama proclaims he has been all the time a devoted muslim. This might not please white Americans and the Jews who still remember 911.</p>
<p>The most unlikely scenarium is that McCain wins. That would give the present US extension time. But eventually the political division wll go by the race of voters the democratic party being for non-whites and the <span class="caps">GOP </span>for whites.</p>

First Geraldine, now Hillary.  They strayed one step out of the dog house and were slapped back in.  What next?   </p>
<p>Yes, they are all taking orders from &#8220;the man behind the curtain&#8221;.  (Who feeds them?)</p>

					<p>This is actually <span class="caps">GOOD </span>news! As more and more racially aware/orientated minorites <span class="caps">GAIN </span>&#8216;political power&rsquo;, all the <span class="caps">WHITE </span>candidates will have to strategize that going after the <span class="caps">WHITE </span>vote is the <span class="caps">ONLY WAY</span> TO <span class="caps">GAIN POWER.</span> Blacks will prefer blacks, and Latinos will prefer latinos. So a white <span class="caps">DEM </span>or Neo-con running against a Latino candidate will have to use his race card. Latinos will vote less along racial lines than blacks, but it could still  be enough to make racial politics interesting. </p>
<p>Chickens comming home to roost. I have never figured out exactly why Clinton was the first &#8216;black&rsquo; president. He cut welfare moms off just like Reagan.</p>

That is very interesting, because what you&rsquo;re saying is that you <span class="caps">DESPISE </span>them <span class="caps">ALL</span>; but that you simply  despise her the least.</p>
<p>This confirms what I&rsquo;ve said before: that our elections have degenerated more and more into a contest between sell-outs and traitors, working against our interests but competing for our votes;  and we are given the choice of trying to figure out which one of them will be the <span class="caps">LEAST DANGEROUS </span>and the <span class="caps">LEAST DAMAGING </span>to our best interests.</p>
<p>Voting is no longer a matter of deciding  which candidate do we <span class="caps">WANT, </span>but  elminimating which candidates we most strongly  do <span class="caps">NOT </span>want.  It&rsquo;s choosing not which candidate do we <span class="caps">LIKE </span>the most,  but which candidate do we <span class="caps">HATE </span>the least!</p>
<p>In other words, this  is a pathetic commentary on the state of affairs in American politics today.  It&rsquo;s obvious that this  media-run illusion of democracy is <span class="caps">NOT  </span><b>government by, of, and for the people. </b><br>

					<p>We won&rsquo;t have a civil war.  We are a demoralized nation.  We will simply be taxed and legislated into obscurity and be replaced through demographics.</p>

					<p>It saddens me to see the lack of choice my American friends have to vote for. If it&rsquo;s any consolation, we, your neighbours to the north, have the same conundrum when we vote. </p>
<p>Now, my two cents; Hillary does not deserve the vote of the hard working, Whites, she claims are voting for her. She and her husband, &#8220;the first Black president,&#8221; have done nothing to deserve your loyalty. Vote for one of the lesser known candidates or don&rsquo;t vote at all. </p>
