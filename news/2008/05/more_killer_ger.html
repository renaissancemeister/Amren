						<p>The threat of death-defying bacteria, stubborn organisms that refuse to be conquered by antibiotic medicines, is growing more alarming.</p>
<p>Infectious microbes that used to be able to resist only one drug, such as penicillin or methicillin, now resist multiple drugs. Some can survive virtually every weapon in doctors&rsquo; medicine cabinets.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Two troubling recent developments:</p>
<p>* Some bacteria have acquired the ability to &#8220;eat&#8221; the very antibiotic medicines that are supposed to eat them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Almost all the drugs that we consider as our mainline defense against bacterial infections are at risk from bacteria that not only resist the drugs but eat them for breakfast,&#8221; George Church, a geneticist at Harvard Medical School in Boston, wrote in the April 4 issue of the journal Science.</p>
<p>* A lethal new form of tuberculosis, known as XDR-TB, that&rsquo;s virtually impossible to cure has exploded in Africa, Asia and. There are also a small number of cases in the United States.</p>
<p>These XDR-TB bacteria possess &#8220;such extensive drug resistance as to be nearly untreatable with currently available drugs,&#8221; Sarita Shah, a epidemiologist at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, reported in the Emerging Infectious Diseases journal.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Most of these TB germs are &#8220;multi-drug resistant,&#8221; or MDR-TB, because they resist many of the most popular medicines. The World Health Organization, based in Geneva, Switzerland, estimated that about 490,000 MDR-TB cases, including 116,000 deaths, occur each year, more than half of them in China, India and Russia.</p>
<p>In the last few years, however, an &#8220;extremely-drug resistant&#8221; strain, called XDR-TB for short, has exploded. XDR-TB infected about 27,000 people and caused about 16,000 deaths world-wide in 2006, the last year for which data is available, WHO reported.</p>
<p>The United States is not immune to the problem, which is particularly prevalent among immigrants. In 2006, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recorded 116 cases of MDR-TB and four cases of XDR-TB in this country. Incomplete data show two XDR-TB cases here in 2007.</p>

					<p>It won&rsquo;t be long&hellip;.our stupid government keeps letting in the trash of the planet&hellip;.there will be a germ worse than the plaque that will wipe us all out&hellip;including the idiots who allowed all this in the first place&hellip;God help us all!!</p>

					<p>Makes you want to go right out and rent a room in a shabby, Indian-run motel, doesn&rsquo;t it?  </p>
<p>The African connection here in particular is unsuprising.  With th prevalence of <span class="caps">HIV </span>here, and the resulting huge numbers of people with compromised immune systems, more aggresive strains of other diseases - like TB - would naturally emerge.  A disease organism that kills its host isn&rsquo;t doing its job properly, but if it can make up for this by spreading quickly - take cholera for instance - it will be asccessful species anyway.</p>
<p>Additionally, incompetant Third-World doctors are notorious for misusing antibiotics, which naturally produces resistant strains.</p>
<p>Celebrate diversity!</p>

					<p>This just adds to the long list of diseases brought by irrational and unmeasured mass imiigration (not that we don&rsquo;t have domestic ones):</p>
<p>Genetic tendency to gross over-breeding</p>
<p>Obesity</p>
<p>Low IQ</p>
<p>Socialism</p>
<p>Immorality</p>
<p>Crime</p>
<p>Social parasitism</p>
<p>Multiculturalism</p>
<p>Racial tensions</p>
<p>Bribery and corruption</p>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>When the refugees from Asia that run away from plague in medieval ages knocked to the ports of Europe asking for admitance, the Europeans could not just look at what was going on (the plague, that is) in the countries that these refugees came from, so some let them in. As a result, some 2/3 of Europe population&rsquo;s died. Quite a steep price just to show a compassion for a few hundreds refugees.</p>
<p>Now we can easily see what&rsquo;s going on in the countries that most of immigrants (legal and otherwise) are comming from, yet we (or our government) refuse to take a note of it. As a result, whatever is wrong over there, finds itself a way to the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>and roots itself here. As if the tragic lesson of misplaced compassion and the deadly plague that it brought on our heads did not teach us anything.<br>

					<p>May Sen. Ted Kennedy, the whole treasonous demo-rat-ic party, aka, anti-white-Christian communist party; come in contact with this &#8221; super-bug &#8221; and die. They (demo-rats) through being traitors to their white-Christian constituients who elected them to congress for &#8221; representation &#8221; but got non-representative &#8221; diversity &#8221; instead since 1965 <span class="caps">A.D. </span>have caused this problem with their no-borders policy and very little European immigration since 1965.</p>
