<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>The Home Secretary has come under pressure to investigate the behaviour of West Midlands Police, after the force issued a grovelling apology to documentary-makers who exposed extremism in Birmingham mosques.</p>
<p>MP Roger Godsiff (Lab Sparkbrook and Small Heath) called for an inquiry to discover why police had targeted Channel 4, broadcaster of the Dispatches documentary, instead of prosecuting the &ldquo;religious and racial hatred&rdquo; uncovered by the programme.</p>
<p>He sponsored a House of Commons motion urging Redditch MP Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, to launch an immediate investigation.</p>
<p>The documentary Dispatches: Undercover Mosque, broadcast in January 2007, showed preachers and teachers stating &ldquo;Allah created the woman deficient&rdquo; and &ldquo;by the age of 10, it becomes an obligation on us to force her (young girls) to wear hijab and if she doesn&rsquo;t wear hijab, we hit her&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Other statements included &ldquo;take that homosexual and throw him off the mountain&rdquo; and &ldquo;whoever changes his religion from Al Islam to anything else &mdash; kill him in the Islamic state&rdquo;.</p>
<p>One speaker in the programme was shown glorying in the Taliban&rsquo;s murder of a British Muslim soldier in Afghanistan, saying the real hero was &ldquo;one who separated his head from his shoulders&rdquo;.</p>
<p>West Midlands Police and the Crown Prosecution Service responded by issuing a press release claiming that the Dispatches programme misrepresented the views of Muslim preachers and clerics with misleading editing.</p>
<p>Police reported Channel 4 to TV watchdog Ofcom for &ldquo;heavily editing&rdquo; the words of Islamic imams to give them more sinister meaning.</p>
<p>But Ofcom dismissed the complaint &mdash; and Channel 4 sued the police for libel.</p>
<p>West Midlands Police and the Crown Prosecution Service issued a public apology after admitting they got it wrong.</p>
<p>Mr Godsiff said he welcomed the apology, but a Home Office inquiry was needed. He said: &ldquo;The individuals shown in the programme broadcast were using highly derogatory and racist language against a variety of non-Muslim groups which included Christians, Jews, homosexuals, lesbians and women; and were in clear in breach of existing legislation in respect of incitement to religious and racial hatred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The MP&rsquo;s motion states that the House of Commons &ldquo;calls on the Home Secretary to launch an immediate investigation into why the West Midlands Police and the Crown Prosecution Service chose to attack the programme makers at Channel 4 rather than investigating and prosecuting the individuals who were shown in the programme; and asserts that incitement to religious and racial hatred has no place in British society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Godsiff has consistently challenged West Midlands Police to justify their behaviour over the programme.</p>
<p>Lawyers acting for West Midlands Police and the Crown Prosecution Service issued the apology in a statement in the High Court in London. They said: &ldquo;Both defendants now accept that the allegations of distortion that were made in the press release were incorrect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are here by their counsel today publicly to withdraw these allegations and to apologise for the fact that they were made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both defendants accept, without reservation, the conclusions of Ofcom and accept that the programme accurately represented the material that had been gathered from the undercover filming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As an indication of the sincerity of this apology and as recognition of the seriousness of allegations of fakery for professional journalists and broadcasters, both defendants have agreed to pay substantial damages to the claimants and to pay their legal costs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a statement issued on its website, West Midlands Police said: &ldquo;Following an independent investigation by the broadcasting regulator Ofcom, we now accept that we were wrong to make these allegations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Channel 4 is to receive damages of £50,000, to be donated to the Rory Peck Trust for freelance news gatherers and their families in times of need, as well as £50,000 in costs.</p>
<p>Kevin Sutcliffe, deputy head of current affairs at Channel 4, said of today&rsquo;s [THURS] announcement: &ldquo;This is a total vindication of the programme team in exposing extreme views being preached in mainstream British mosques.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Police spent around £14,000 on investigating the Dispatches programme, which initially focused on whether the people portrayed in the documentary had broken any laws.</p>
<p>However, police then shifted their focus onto the documentary-makers, and considered whether they should be prosecuted for stirring up racial hatred. Eventually, officers settled for making a complaint to Ofcom instead.<br>

			<p>In the UK, Muslims are the &#8220;chosen people&#8221; simply because the global elites are trying to tear down England (and all white Western countries) and there is no better way to do this than to flood a white nation with nonwhites (such as Muslims) from the Middle East.<br>
These same global elites are of course doing the same thing here.  Instead of Muslims it&rsquo;s Mexians being the &#8220;chosen people&#8221; or should I say, the &#8220;chosen nation wreckers&#8221;.</p>
<p>My guess is these decisions were made by global elitists (such as the Rockefellers) sometime in the 1950&rsquo;s.  Basically, they sat in a room and said, &#8220;lets tear down the West&#8221; (or some words to that effect).  We see 1965 &amp; 1966 being a key time in their strategy since our immigration reform act was passed then (&#8216;65) as well as Canada, Australia, &amp; New Zealand passing similar immigration bills (I believe the UK passed their immigration bill a few years earlier).  Hmmmm&hellip;. conspiracy????  Of course.</p>

			<p>I think even the police of Britain would welcome a Home Office inquiry, because they&rsquo;ve been pressed into the role of ideological enforcers of multiculturalism.</p>

			<p>Whenever the frequent stories like this are published, I remember the case of the very young boy who was suspended from school and theordered to undergo counselling for drawing a gun in class.</p>
<p>There is only one conclusion I can draw for people defending such hatred and calls to violence against their host nation: the majority of the population is insane, and about the only thing that can be done is sit back with a stiff drink and chuckle at the lunacy.</p>

			<p>This case just shows what a monumentally messed up and sick society modern Britain is.<br>
The facts of the case are these:<br>
An independent TV company with a very good reputation in documentaries actually manages to film on tape actual instances of provocative and  deemed &#8216;unacceptable&rsquo; speech made bysenior members of Birmingham&rsquo;s muslim population.<br>
 The local police force are alerted to the video evidence.Strangely enough, they seek to &#8216;turn the tables&rsquo; on the journalists by instigating an investigation and prosecution against the journalists - in a purely biased, perverse and partisan way - trying to show that the &#8216;victimizers&rsquo; are the &#8216;victims&rsquo;!This is, of course, a terrible abuse of power and waste of taxpayers money.<br>
Fortunately the journalists and Channel 4 TV were vindicated at the end of this whole sordid affair that reflects very badly on the British state.</p>

			<p>This should not be surprising. When protestors marched in London streets prior to the 2005 bombings, they held placards and shouted out &#8220;bomb the UK&#8221; &#8220;death to Blair&#8221; &#8220;behead those who insult Islam&#8221; etc., and the police merely turned a blind eye and did nothing. The attitude is &#8220;dont offend the poor muslims&#8221;.<br>
Nothing has changed since Brown took over from Blair.</p>
<p>If you look at Undercover Mosque it is obvious the MP&rsquo;s, the police, the fire brigade etc are all trying to appease the very people who want to overthrow their government!</p>

			<p>How many of these &#8216;british&rsquo; police were pakistanis?</p>
<p>Plenty of them are in the police force, and plenty are moved into upper management in order to fill out their quota system.</p>

			<p>We have a very sick Britain that seems to be ruled now by brainwashed PC people with the rest, the majority, too lazy, stupid or scared to object despite the crazy things that are reported almost daily.  The British police are forced to follow the rules by the PC people who threaten the police leaders who do not seem to have the courage to tell them where to go (within the laws).  The rules the police work with need changing and the race hate laws explaining very simply so EVERYBODY knows what can and cannot be done and said.  Most of the threats work as people seem  too lazy to study the law to find out their rights.</p>
<p>The leaders of the British National Party (BNP, which is a legally registered political party in the UK and is slowly gaining ground with more supporters voting for them) had a similar action brought by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) about a year ago where they filmed secretly one of their public meetings subsequently bringing criminal charges against the two men concerned.  The Courts threw it out, quite rightly as no laws had been broken, but in the case of the radical Muslims preaching hate in the mosques, I have seen some video tapes on TV and the race-and religion hate-law was most definitely broken.   The bad thing was that the license payers paid for the costs as if you have a TV in Britain, you are forced to pay a lot for a compulsory licence every year even if you do not receive the BBC channels.   The cash, which amounts to many millions of dollars, is paid to the BBC.</p>
<p>Basically the race hate laws state that no person or persons must incite hatred against a person or group of another race where harm either physical or mental may be caused against that group.  The BNP at a public meeting described Islam as a wicked religion and they criticised the UK government for allowing unrestricted immigration.  Opinions such as those are allowed legally </p>

			<p>This is not really a police department, but an instrument of state terror against native Britons.  The fine of 50 thousand pounds is an insulting joke, as the department will simply pay it with public money, rather than the individuals responsible for making the decision.</p>
