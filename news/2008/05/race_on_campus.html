<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Walking into his &#8220;Race and Politics&#8221; class recently, David Sparks, a white Duke University political-science graduate student, considered whether to move from his usual seat in the group of white students who always clustered at one end of the seminar table to sit with the black students who typically sat at the other end.</p>
<p>Mr. Sparks didn&rsquo;t do it. &#8220;It would have felt too conspicuous,&#8221; he says. Still, on Tuesday&rsquo;s primary here, Mr. Sparks plans to vote for Sen. Barack Obama for president. That&rsquo;s an easier choice, he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you&rsquo;re actually trying to change your behavior, you are putting more on the line compared to voting in the privacy of the booth,&#8221; he says. &#8220;There are millions and millions of people voting for Obama. In no way are you sticking your neck out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Across the country, college campuses have become hotbeds of support for Sen. Obama. {snip}</p>
<p>But after classes &mdash; and after the occasional Obama rally &mdash; most black and white students on college campuses go their separate ways, living in separate dormitories, joining separate fraternities and sororities and attending separate parties.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jazmyn Singleton, a black Duke senior agrees, After living in a predominantly white dorm freshman year, she lives with five African-American women in an all-black dormitory. &#8220;Both communities tend to be very judgmental,&#8221; says Ms. Singleton, ruefully. &#8220;There is pressure to be black. The black community can be harsh. People will say there are 600 blacks on campus but only two-thirds are &lsquo;black&rsquo; because you can&rsquo;t count blacks who hang out with white people.&#8221;</p>
<p>The racial divisions among college students are striking both because of the fervor for Obama and the increasing diversity on campus. Colleges offer a unique opportunity for students to get to know each other in a relaxed atmosphere where many of the issues that often divide blacks and whites, like income and educational levels, are minimized amid the common goals of going to class, playing sports and going to parties.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Obama campaign has created another opportunity for blacks and whites on campuses to interact. At the University of North Carolina in nearby Chapel Hill, &#8220;seeing someone wearing an Obama pin is a reason for a connection,&#8221; says Tessa Bialek, a white junior. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a reason to wave to someone on the way to class.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But working or voting for an African-American running for president doesn&rsquo;t necessarily bridge differences &mdash; on campus or, later, in the workplace. Following a recent discussion in one of his classes about the campaign, in which most students expressed support for Sen. Obama, Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, a Duke sociologist, asked his white students how many had a black friend on campus. All the white students raised their hands.</p>
<p>He then asked the black students how many of them had a white friend on campus. None of them raised their hands.</p>
<p>The more he probed, Mr. Bonilla-Silva says, the more he realized that the definition of friendship was different. The white students considered a black a &#8220;friend&#8221; if they played basketball with him or shared a class. &#8220;It was more of an acquaintance,&#8221; recalls Mr. Bonilla-Silva.</p>
<p>Black students, by contrast, defined a friend as someone they would invite to their home for dinner. By that measure, none of the students had friends from the opposite race. Mr. Bonilla-Silva says when white college students were asked in series of 1998 surveys about the five people with whom they interacted most on a daily basis, about 68% said none of them were black. When asked if they had invited a black person to lunch or dinner recently, about 68% said &#8220;no.&#8221; He says his own research and more recent studies show similar results.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some blacks respond that black students &mdash; like all students &mdash; room with people they are comfortable with. What&rsquo;s more, they say living among backs eases some of the pressure and isolation of being a minority at a predominantly white institution.</p>

					<p>How is it an elite graduate school education, in political science (sic) no less, leaves a white student politically unconscious? If I returned to university for a Master&rsquo;s degree, I might consider that topic for my Thesis.</p>

					<p>&#8220;a Duke sociologist, asked his white students how many had a black friend on campus. All the white students raised their hands. He then asked the black students how many of them had a white friend on campus. None of them raised their hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re old enough to remember, comedians on TV made big fun of whites who would say, &#8220;I have plenty of black friends&#8221;. Saying such a thing was a sure sign you were a racist. Not much has changed at Duke university. I wish the world was a more perfect place.</p>
<p>In a perfect world, blacks, browns and yellows, would all fumble over themselves bragging of their white friends.</p>
<p>In a perfect world, us true believer AmRen posters would all have an important role to play. We&rsquo;d be heads of university departments, or commissions on race and politics, all with the ear of government industry and the media. </p>
<p>We&rsquo;d all get together and make up a nasty word to use on our opponents. We&rsquo;d say, anyone who doesn&rsquo;t believe the way we do is a &#8216;hatemonger&rsquo;. We&rsquo;d make &#8216;hatemongering&rsquo; the worst crime in America. Then we&rsquo;d say, only whites couldn&rsquo;t be hatemongers. Hardened criminals would be drug off to jail, pleading, &#8220;I&rsquo;m not a hatemonger please believe me&#8221;.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;d be links to Aryan Nation, right on the main page of &#8216;White is Right.com&rsquo; the nations number 1 web site. Every once in awhile, someone might ponder, whether or not whites could be hatemongers too, just to make it all seem fair.</p>
<p>And when some poor hispanic lady sobs, &#8220;I&rsquo;m not a hatemonger, I have lots of white friends&#8221;. We would all pronounce, ah ha This is the proof. Whites are all victims of hatemongers. In a perfect world. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure some sensitivity managers can be brought to bear on this problem. Extra diversity and sensitivity training should do it. Perhaps some of the black groups on campus can tackle this, or reaching out into the black community. <br>

					<p>This is all a bunch of baloney, but I&rsquo;d like to see a followup done in five years. Most of those White kids wouldn&rsquo;t be raising their hands saying they&rsquo;ve got a black &#8220;friend.&#8221; All it takes is a bit of experience to see that blacks aren&rsquo;t going to be your friend.</p>

					<p>We&rsquo;ve had 40 white presidents so far. We&rsquo;re free to vote for whoever we choose. I have nothing against these kids who want Obama. Good for them. What we need to do is concentrate on this anti-white propaganda, and anti-white policies that are completely seperate from Obama. At least with Obama, as opposed to Alan Keyes or someone like Thomas Sowell, you know where he stands for sure. </p>

Although Whites and blacks are both supporting Obama, they are doing so for different reasons. Whites are hoping for racial reconciliation. Blacks are hoping for power and payback.</p>
<p>So while blacks and whites show up at Obama rallies and their close proximity and intermingling appear to show unity (the only commonality being a win for Obama), each group has a different ultimate goal.</p>
<p>Most whites have no concept of what blacks really want. They may find out the hard way.<br>

<p>In turn, it means nearly 1/3 of white college students <b>did</b> interact with a black on a daily basis and invited a black to lunch etc.  That apparently isn&rsquo;t enough for the racial hucksters.  Only when all whites grovel, beg forgiveness, and become aracial drones will it be enough&hellip;maybe.</p>

					<p>&#8220;Across the country, college campuses have become hotbeds of support for Sen. Obama.&#8221;</p>
<p>Besides being hotbeds of Cultural Marxist propaganda and having faculties rife with self-hating, conditioned whites, the entire atmosphere <span class="caps">DICTATES </span>that anything black must be supported and honored above all things.  Even if a college student wasn&rsquo;t among the brainwashed masses, would it be wise for him to announce his independence or go along to get along in order to flee the endoctrination center, so he could get on to more important things in his life?  Wearing an Obama pin is a small price to pay when the alternative is facing hostile faculties and white-hating blacks that insist they be given priorities or else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is pressure to be black. The black community can be harsh. People will say there are 600 blacks on campus but only two-thirds are &lsquo;black&rsquo; because you can&rsquo;t count blacks who hang out with white people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Is there any better evidence of anti-white resentment, jealousy and even outright hatred than this?  Those students who aren&rsquo;t brainwashed don&rsquo;t want to be at odds with such a contingent of animosity represented by such primitives.  Though there are a <span class="caps">LOT </span>of brainwashed whites on campus, I wonder how many wear an Obama pin to keep the rabid elements from targeting them, because they just don&rsquo;t want any hassles?  I mean the same kind of hassles that blacks think are a part of their lives and pursue them mindlessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Colleges offer a unique opportunity for students to get to know each other in a relaxed atmosphere where many of the issues that often divide blacks and whites, like income and educational levels, are minimized amid the common goals of going to class, playing sports and going to parties.&#8221;</p>
<p>A relaxed atmosphere?  Didn&rsquo;t the author just write that there was a division among the races by choice?  That&rsquo;s a relaxed atmosphere?  And, how can educational levels be minimized in college?  Aren&rsquo;t many of them at the same level, or very close to it?  I wonder if he really means to write that many of the things that divide whites and blacks is not educational level, but intelligence level.  </p>
<p>And, also, I would like to ask for the umpteenth time, why the concentration on whites and blacks, since there are tens of thousands of other races in college right now, like Asians and Hispanics?  Are we supposed to believe that there are only white/black difference when we know full well blacks are at odds, and have a &#8220;gap,&#8221; with the other races besides whites?  Why are those in the <span class="caps">MSM </span>afraid to bring those points out?</p>
<p>&#8220;He then asked the black students how many of them had a white friend on campus. None of them raised their hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the reason for that was in the way each group defines friendship?  Yeah, sure.  Do you have a bridge in Brooklyn you would like to sell me too?</p>

					<p>As much as I think that she is being really stupid for the &#8220;you cant count the blacks who hang around with White people as black&#8221; when the situation is reversed, most Whites would not want to count as White the &#8220;White&#8221; people who hang around with blacks. </p>

					<p>In many respects, this article is the expected vacillating piece of &ldquo;diversity is our strength&rdquo; garbage, that passes for &ldquo;journalism,&rdquo; in this country and the West as a whole on racial issues.</p>
<p>It has all of the accusatory elements of well intentioned but superficial whites, faced with their more savvy and practical black peers. Certainly, there is a cosmetic &ldquo;deliberative&rdquo; aspect to this screed, in that blacks and whites both seem to fail in recognizing their &ldquo;common&rdquo; and &ldquo;comfortable&rdquo; safe haven of the university &ldquo;utopia&rdquo; experience, or spasmodically &ldquo;shared&rdquo; Obamania. However, whites are seen as the &ldquo;racist&rdquo; fools, while blacks understandably retreat to their logical tribal &ldquo;safe zones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet, this excerpt does hit the cord of unmistakable truth:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The more he probed, Mr. Bonilla-Silva says, the more he realized that the definition of friendship was different. The white students considered a black a &lsquo;friend&rsquo; if they played basketball with him or shared a class. &lsquo;It was more of an acquaintance,&rsquo; recalls Mr. Bonilla-Silva.</p>
<p>Black students, by contrast, defined a friend as someone they would invite to their home for dinner. By that measure, none of the students had friends from the opposite race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here I would hold, that had it been a room full of sincere AR race realists (and not a bunch of multicultural mealy-mouthed and near diversity delusional undergraduate white &ldquo;intellectuals&rdquo;)  and blacks, both would have admitted a definition of friendship that was far more candid. </p>
<p>Now, why might that be?</p>
<p>Well here goes, like it or not, we and the vast majority of blacks in this country honestly do not view racial differences as a &ldquo;social construct.&rdquo; For us and them, it is a reality; we do not approach the reality in the same terms, but we at least recognize it as being a hard fact of life. On the surface to some, what I have wrote above might be appalling or even nauseating; however, think hard about it, really hard. </p>
<p>Do we have more in common with blacks in terms of sociopolitical reasoning in terms of racial reality, or more with some dewy-eyed and obsequious white idiot who can vote for our mulatto Comrade Mugabe &ldquo;Lite&rdquo; without nary a reservation, and yet admit he or she would not want to look &ldquo;too conspicuous,&rdquo; because they sat next to a group of blacks? That is simply put, hyper cognitive dissonance at best and outright mentally flexible-ossification at worst. Add to this the fact, that you would be so abjectly indifferent to this state of  dichotomous cranial acrobatics, that &ldquo;friendship&rdquo; is reduced to a chat in the hall or a romp on a basketball court, here and there?</p>
<p>If that is the case, I have more friends than my social calendar will ever allow for in the next ten years!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!<br>

					<p>Well, do blacks and whites have different social rules? Of course they do, so its about how can white people interact with blacks and be black enough. Problem is, white people are so uncool, ezpecially these silly whites who want to &#8216;reach out and touch&rsquo; some black people. Blacks look down on that type of white behavior. </p>

					<p>White ding-bat panderers should realize no matter how much they pander to blacks, blacks will still spit in their face in return. The epitome of this is when a white female ding-a-ling came up to prominent black professor/&#8221;poet&#8221; Amiri Baraka, and in a sickening act of white pandering to a black racist, she asked him how she could help the &#8220;black cause&#8221;.

This article has a remarkable little part where the white students say they have black friends, but the black students say they don&rsquo;t have white friends.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s more to it than the explanation offered by the writer. White people feel that they <i>should</i> have a black friend  &mdash;   the message has been drilled into them, and so they feel guilty if they don&rsquo;t answer the question the right way.  Black people haven&rsquo;t been given a reason to feel guilty if they don&rsquo;t have white friends.  </p>
<p>So, whites will tend to answer the question with &#8220;<i>yes</i>, I do have black friends.&#8221; But they might not really want to have black friends all that much.<br>

					<p> Let me also add from something Henry Ford once said.lets atleast make it a fair playing field by having communications from both sides! Even people with high iq&rsquo;s can be ribbed into acting against someone who they have been convinced has done them wrong through enough propagada. So think what those with lower iq&rsquo;s will think and do with years of propaganda that whites have been the reason for all their failure.</p>

					<p>&#8220;When you&rsquo;re actually trying to change your behavior, you are putting more on the line compared to voting in the privacy of the booth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thank God for Democracy! </p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t think this is an isolated case. </p>
<p>No. </p>
<p>Not at all. </p>
<p>In fact, I bet the vast majority of white Obama supporters think this way. </p>
<p>And they seem to have the university degrees and college diplomas to prove it.</p>

					<p>&#8220;Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, a Duke sociologist, asked his white students how many had a black friend on campus. All the white students raised their hands.</p>
<p>He then asked the black students how many of them had a white friend on campus. None of them raised their hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wow. Could anything show more beautifully how whites are deluding themselves that our society is integrating itself nicely, while blacks are in fact psychically separating themselves to the maximum possible.</p>

					<p>&gt;&gt;The Obama campaign has created another opportunity for blacks and whites on campuses to interact.</p>
<p>Just wondering. Does that include the way that Lawrence Alvin Lovette Jr. &#8220;interacted&#8221; with Eve Marie Carson and the way that Orange Amir Taylor <span class="caps">III </span>&#8220;interacted&#8221; with Laura Dickinson? </p>

					<p>The Duke illustration demonstrates that &#8220;being black&#8221; is more than a racial description.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an attitude, a state of mind, characterized by overt hostility to whites, ill-mannered behavior, willful stupidity, ignorance, low achievement, and a general disrespect for civility and social norms.  </p>
<p>Thus, blacks celebrate failure and a general lack of achievement as being authentically black, which I suppose works for them in the world we currently inhabit.  They need not invent, achieve, create, or produce to enjoy the benefits of being in close proximity to more productive racial and ethnic groups, which perhaps foolishly continue to carry and tolerate them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for blacks, this can&rsquo;t go on indefinitely.</p>

					<p>Reading the pro-Obama drivel on Microsoft News   &mdash;   claiming he has a double-digit lead over McCain, I find myself torn&hellip; wondering whether we&rsquo;re simply being fed a pack of lies in hopes of supporting the <span class="caps">OBMANINATION.</span> . . or whether those &#8216;reporters&rsquo; are just a bunch of pot-smoking kooks, reminescent of the hippies of a generation or so back. In short, people <span class="caps">DUMB ENOUGH </span>to believe their own wishful thinking.</p>
<p>As contemptible as McCain is, Obama has to be a hundred-fold times <span class="caps">WORSE.</span> McCain, in his blundering stupidity is <span class="caps">FOR AMNESTY, FOR OPEN BORDERS.</span> Obama being, of course, the same, in addition to wanting to import countless millions of his impoverished Black kin from Africa. To be supported by White taxpayers. Who, as thanks for their &#8216;generosity,&rsquo; will have to put up with millions more Black criminals and misfits in our land.</p>
<p>As to &#8220;bridging&#8221; the racial divide. Why in hell would, I (or any <span class="caps">RATIONAL</span> White, want to have a Black as &#8220;best friend?&#8221; Much less that mulatto snake-oil salesman as president. Obama is a bungler, devoid of experience, and having amply demonstrated his poor judgment to be <span class="caps">PRESIDENT</span>? I should hope not!</p>
<p>I would bet that most of those people in that claimed double-digit lead over McCain will still end up voting <span class="caps">FOR</span> McCain, as the lesser evil, come November. Unless putting fluoride in the water has the effect of short-circuiting one&rsquo;s mental abilities.</p>

					<p>&#8220;we and the vast majority of blacks in this country honestly do not view racial differences as a &#8216;social construct&rsquo;.&#8221;</p>

					<p>Black &#8220;leaders&#8221; love to evoke the name of Martin Luther King jr. when it serves their own ends, but few blacks seem even remotely interested in ending racial chauvanism amongst themselves.  It&rsquo;s pretty clear that ending racism is not the goal of the blacks.  They just want to construct a racist state that works to their benefit only.</p>

					<p>One of the posters hit the nail on the head.</p>
<p>The whites who are voting for Obama are doing so because they believe it&rsquo;ll bring racial reconcilliation.  They envision a Kumbaya world of everyone holding hands and walking off into the sunset wherein Obama lovingly holds them tight and tells them it&rsquo;ll be alright.  This is totally pie in the sky fantasy.</p>
<p>Whereas the black population who supports Obama sees it as their chance to have one of their own running the show.  Which is really quite understandible.  </p>

					<p><i>The more he probed, Mr. Bonilla-Silva says, the more he realized that the definition of friendship was different.</i></p>
<p>This goes back to the ancient old lie/cliche of whites that &#8220;some of my best friends are black.&#8221; This cliche is invariably trotted out to prove that they are not &#8220;racist.&#8221; This brings up an interesting article in an old back issue of American Renaissance that pointed out the mental tricks that whites use to convince themselves that they have black &#8220;friends.&#8221; One is to count black co-workers  &mdash;  even if they never associate with them off the job. Some whites may even subconsciously convince themselves that blacks they see on television, like Oprah, are their &#8220;friends,&#8221; since, after all, they see them every day. The article concluded that, since so many whites claim black friends, and since blacks are only about 12% of the population, for whites&rsquo; claims to be true, every black in the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>would have to have about 15 or 20 white friends.</p>

					<p>This business of black folks on a college campus voluntarily segregating themselves on the basis of race is nothing new.</p>
<p>They were doing this when I was in college nearly forty years ago.</p>
<p>They are still doing it, for no better reason than it makes them feel superior to others, or something. </p>
<p>My experience has been that most of the racial animosity has been  on the part of black folks, not white folks. </p>
<p>Blacks seem to be determined to be perpetually offended by any and everything, or everybody.</p>

					<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve had 40 white presidents so far. We&rsquo;re free to vote for whoever we choose. I have nothing against these kids who want Obama. Good for them. What we need to do is concentrate on this anti-white propaganda, and anti-white policies that are completely seperate from Obama. At least with Obama, as opposed to Alan Keyes or someone like Thomas Sowell, you know where he stands for sure. &#8220;</p>
<p>What idiot could write this?  Obama may very well be the devil.  He&rsquo;s got ties with Farakhan, Wright, terrorists, his wife, and many other loonies.  Where does he stand?  Will he fight against affirmative racism aka affirmative action?  Will he march with white leader to protest black-on-white crimes and black-on-white racially cleansing out of thousands of formerly white neighborhoods?  Will he speak out against the black racist preachers of hate who are the root cause of black on white violence?  Will he stop the transfer of wealth from hard working whites to non-producing welfare blacks?  Will the racist Obama support reparations?  Will the racist Obama permit millions of blacks from around the worlds to migrate here to consolidate his voting base?  Will the racist Obama enable tens of millions of foreign invaders already here to become citizens and then bring their third world families here?  </p>
<p>OBama or Osama - take your pick.  </p>
<p>Noboday can save America.  We need to shout and fight for our white civil rights.  They are non-negotiable!</p>

					<p>It&rsquo;s just the old cafeteria test again, right?  At the northern third tier university at which I work, they tried this bogus &#8220;Daily Pause&#8221; lunchtime event througout campus, apparently in an attempt, to get the black and white students to all come together in unity daily, right? Well, the white students quickly stopped going to the SU entirely.   </p>

					<p>Blacks have always segregated themselves like that once they won their wish to be admitted to White schools. This is counter to the better thought-out wishes of Whites(remember those White families in the 60&rsquo;s who protested against school integration to no avail?)<br>
Their presense in a White school serves no one. It only causes the school to have to &#8220;dumb down&#8221; so that they can pass.</p>
