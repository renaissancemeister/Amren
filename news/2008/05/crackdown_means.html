						<p>The sandy streets of Sasabe are empty. Migrant smugglers have to hunt for business at border-town shelters. Many deported migrants give up after one try, taking their government up on free bus rides home.</p>
<p>A U.S. crackdown is causing the longest and most significant drop in illegal migration from Mexico since the Sept. 11 attacks. Officials say the U.S. economic downturn, tighter security and a more perilous and expensive journey are persuading many who try to sneak into the U.S. to give up sooner.</p>
<p>Border Patrol arrests are down 17 percent so far this year along the U.S.-Mexico border after falling 20 percent all of last fiscal year and 8 percent the year before that. While it&rsquo;s impossible to know how many people are crossing illegally, the Patrol uses apprehensions to estimate the ebb and flow of traffic.</p>
<p>The downturn in illegal immigration has created labor shortages throughout the United States and several states are considering temporary-worker programs, especially in agricultural fields, where produce is going bad.</p>
<p>Mexicans in the U.S. are starting to send less money home, too.</p>
<p>Money being sent back is down</p>
<p>Remittances soared in the early part of the decade to become Mexico&rsquo;s largest source of foreign income after oil exports. But they rose just 1 percent in 2007, reaching $24 billion and in the first quarter this year, they slipped almost 3 percent from the same period last year, Mexico&rsquo;s central bank said this week.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>U.S. authorities attribute the drop to tighter security and a new program in the Tucson sector that has prosecuted more than 3,000 migrants for crossing illegally since it started in January. They face jail sentences from a few days to six months.</p>
<p>But none of the migrants interviewed by The Associated Press knew about the new prosecution program. Those on their way home said the main deterrents were tougher security and the dangers of the desert, including bandits who rob and even rape migrants on both sides of the border.</p>
<p><b>More border security</b></p>
<p>The U.S. Border Patrol has added 200 officers since last year to the Tucson sector, and a total of 3,000 agents now search the vast desert for illegal migrants by truck, horse, ATV and helicopter. They now have four drones scanning for drug and migrant smugglers, as well as two newly built 12-foot walls with steel posts near Nogales and in Sasabe.</p>
<p>At the same time, Mexican drug smugglers have started to collect fees for access to the main routes into Arizona.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Smugglers losing money</b></p>
<p>Francisco Loureiro, who runs a migrant shelter in Nogales, said that when migrants began arriving in January, the start of the high season, he spotted smugglers trying to drum up business inside his shelter.</p>
<p>Now, local police visit the shelter three times a night.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>During earlier peak traffic seasons, overflowing vans and pickups would arrive in Sasabe and then head out to the drop-off points where migrants begin their long walk. The town of 1,500 people could see its population triple from migrants passing through.</p>
<p>Now businesses are closing and at least six safe houses and hotels have been left unfinished, said town administrator Ramona Flores. Border experts estimate that 70 percent of residents earn their living from migration.</p>

			<p>Wow. No doors being kicked in in the middle of the night. No screaming children being dragged away from crying parents. No economic collapse. All the things the Treason Lobby said would happen didn&rsquo;t. Enforcement works. Cut off the incentives to come here and they will stay home. Now, let&rsquo;s go a step further and cut off all the freebies that the ones who are still here are getting. </p>

			<p>In California, all of the construction jobs have a majority Mexican workforce, and most of them are illegal. Californias population grows by 500,000 yearly because of illegal immigration, anchor babies, and legal immigration.This will lead to s state that will be a tird world hellhole, and our politically correct politicians are the cause of this.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t believe it.  The damage is done.  The invaders have stormed the beach, scaled the cliffs, and established enclaves.  They are here to stay, and demographically they will overwhelm and replace our culture.  I am convinced that the future of our is now sealed, and we are in serious, serious trouble.  I predict that an hispanic Obama-like candidate will emerge in time for 2012, and he will prevail. </p>

			<p>Will the crackdown extend BEYOND this November&rsquo;s Election Day? Sorry to have to ask, but inquiring minds would sure like to know.</p>
<p>Of course we can STOP illegal immigration if our govenrment truly wants to. But those hypocritics and whores infesting BOTH Houses of Congress have a vested interest in going thru the motions, but not really doing much AGAINST illegal immigration!</p>
<p>Because any EFFECTIVE action would anger their corporate contributors who demand free and unrestricted access to cheap labor! And to hell with what the cost of illegal immigrants means to decent American citizens!</p>

			<p>We always here about &#8220;labor shortages&#8221; every time they attempt to enforce immigration law.  I guarantee there&rsquo;s a wage at which legal American citizens will line up for those jobs.  But the rule in this country is that the working class must never, ever, get a raise.  That&rsquo;s how they keep inflation low despite a galloping increase in the money supply.<br>

			<p>It&rsquo;s the economy, stupid. It has nothing to do with any so-called &#8220;crackdown&#8221;. I&rsquo;ll believe that there is a &#8220;crackdown&#8221; when I see a wall. They know it&rsquo;s the economy as well, it has been well documented by reasearchers that immigration ebbs and flows with the U.S. economy. There were three articles I read about that the other months by researchers by University of Arizona, I believe one was posted on Amren. When there&rsquo;s know jobs illegals don&rsquo;t come here. This is the government patting themselves on thier backs for something they did nothing about. It&rsquo;s funny how on Yahoo last week they had an article saying the opposite.</p>

			<p>Does this mean there will soon be less than 300 million people living in the USA? If not, it is too little, too late and makes a good article but does not indicate any real changes in the downward spiral caused by wide open borders.</p>

			<p>The reason I would consider myself an Immigration Realist is for the same reason I would consider my self a Race Realist, and to that you could add a Family Realist, in that I am interested in how Human Beings are socialized.  That process beginning at home. And, an Individual Realist because, everything begins and ends there, with the Individual. Which is why the West is the Best, it created the Soveriegn Individual. And even in those cases, such as severe abuse and neglect, when the Individual is NOT responsible for what they end up doing later as a result, they are none the less still accountable. <br>
In other words, the Offender can only do what Offenders do, victimize you.  Once you become a legitimate victim the Offender is the LAST person who can change you.  You have to change yourself. And the first step is - to get away from the Offender!  Easier said then done, but it&rsquo;s the first step.</p>
<p>In any event, with family you learn, or don&rsquo;t learn, how to draw boundries. If you do but are still walked over then the problem lies in society. Today we have an obvious boundry problem, quite literally, with our borders.  But, as any Race Realist knows, we have a boundry problem concerning Race, ie; No other Race is encouraged or expected to respect our boundries, at all.  Witness the story in Oakland about that dear 7 year old boy.</p>
<p>Good Boundries are where the doorknob is on the inside.  You chose when to open up, so to speak.  They are also there to protect something valuable.  It seems a shame that the people with clear, solid boundries today are those who are shallow, dependent, and needy; not to mention brutal, stupid, and arrogant. Welcome to the Inverted World of the 21st Century. </p>
<p>Bad boundries are with the doorknob on the outside.  And today this Predator Society predicated on what I refer to as a Gangster Theology demands that Whites live this way.  Or, preferably, in the third way, ie; with NO boundries at all.  </p>
<p>Naturally, the lifespan of an organism, society, person, etc. with no boundries is, well, they won&rsquo;t last long.  So, predictably, they are making it illegal for us to draw healthy boundries.  But here&rsquo;s the catch.  They are doing it while at the same time living with the expectation that we still provide for them through services and taxation, etc. In short to provide for them unconditionally. Including offering ourselves as human outlets for their violent rage; for their inability to observe and respect others boundries. Such behavior always has the absurd justification of some past injustice tacked on to it. First and foremost, it&rsquo;s absurd because we&rsquo;re not guilty.  Second, it&rsquo;s absurd, because as everyone knows, this is how they behave amongst themselves, and their insistance of attributing their violence to an Historical cause is merely an extension of the sort of corrupt thinking they learned at home, in their own cultures. And now we are back to why they are so stupid, brutal and arrogant.</p>
<p>Anyway, I could go on, and believe me, I want to.  I have a lot to say about all of this.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d like to leave you with this link.  It&rsquo;s the photo of Zachary Cataldo, the 7 year old mentioned above from the AR posting of April 25th.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/object/article?o=1&amp;f=/c/a/2008/04/24/MNPC10AK04.DTL" rel="nofollow">http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/object/article?o=1&f;=/c/a/2008/04/24/MNPC10AK04.DTL</a></p>
<p>Just do the Control C - Control V thing and view the photos of Zachary and see if it doesn&rsquo;t evoke an answering emotion.</p>
<p>Time to draw boundries, and get angry.<br>

			<p>No way near enough!  I am STILL waiting for the 854 miles of double-layered fence!  I&rsquo;m still waiting for the Federal E-Verify System to kick in!  I&rsquo;m still waiting for all of those &#8220;criminal&#8221; illegal aliens in our prisons and jails to be identified and deported!  I&rsquo;m still waiting for the rest of the criminal illegal aliens to self-deport through interior law enforcement such as the lack of jobs and benefits&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all a horse and pony &#8220;election year&#8221; stunt to have us &#8220;believe&#8221; that they&rsquo;re serious about enforcing our immigration laws!  </p>
<p>This government has been lying to us for at least 40 years!  So they throw us a couple of bones and expect us to be happy?  NO WAY!  </p>

<p>Inflation is &#8220;low&#8221; also because the government does not count energy or food prices in the official inflation rate.</p>

			<p>Will someone please tell me what jobs LEGAL aliens fill in this country? We bring a million LEGAL aliens in annually, as well as political and religious refugees. Don&rsquo;t they need jobs? Or are they on the dole? I don&rsquo;t see any reason for illegals with all the rest of the people our government stuffs into this nation.</p>
