			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Malcolm Moore, London Telegraph, April 30, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The new mayor of Rome has promised to purge the Italian capital of 20,000 illegal immigrants and to raze 85 gipsy camps.</p>
<p>Gianni Alemanno, 50, a firebrand neo-fascist and the first Right-wing mayor of the city since the Second World War, vowed to make Rome &#8220;secure&#8221; as he was sworn into office after his election at the weekend.</p>
<p>The election of Mr Alemanno confirmed a strong shift to the Right by Italians, who have been sickened by a spate of violent crimes committed by immigrants.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the centre-Right leader Silvio Berlusconi was re-elected as prime minister and will form a government in partnership with Umberto Bossi, the leader of the anti-immigration Northern League.</p>
<p>In a sign of things to come, after Mr Alemanno&rsquo;s election Mr Berlusconi declared: &#8220;We are the new Falange.&#8221;</p>
<p>The original Falange (or Phalanx) was the Spanish fascist party, founded in the 1930s, whose doctrine was adopted by General Franco.</p>
<p>Mr Alemanno&rsquo;s election was celebrated by hundreds of supporters chanting &#8220;Duce! Duce!&#8221; and raising their arms in Mussolini&rsquo;s fascist salute.</p>
<p>The new mayor said that his first action would be to begin &#8220;immediate expulsions&#8221; of the 20,000 immigrants in the city with criminal records.</p>
<p>&#8220;We cannot welcome them without discipline,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We will chase out the delinquents. There are 85 abusive nomad camps to destroy.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that he would visit the widower of Giovanna Reggiani, a 47-year-old woman who was beaten, raped and killed by a Romanian immigrant who lived at a such a camp last November. &#8220;I want to promise him that what happened to his wife would never happen again,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Walter Veltroni, his Left-wing predecessor, was widely criticised for paying more attention to ancient monuments and film festivals than to problems with the city&rsquo;s infrastructure and security.</p>
<p>Mr Alemanno was the youth leader of the fascist Italian Social Movement and wears a Celtic cross, a symbol of the extreme Right. However, he said he wore the cross only as a religious symbol, and in tribute to Paolo di Nella, a far-Right activist who was stoned to death in a Rome street protest 25 years ago.</p>
<p>Mr Alemanno said he was sick of the &#8220;continuing search for [my] dark side&#8221;, adding: &#8220;I am bitterly upset from a personal point of view at this demonisation.&#8221;</p>
<p>He promised to be a mayor for all Romans, and immediately sent letters to the Vatican and to Rome&rsquo;s Jewish community.</p>
<p>Graziano Halilovic, a spokesman for one of Rome&rsquo;s biggest settlements of Roma gipsies, said: &#8220;We fear there will be night-time raids on the camps. We want a safe city too. Some of our members have heard their parents&rsquo; stories of fascism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Bossi said on Wednesday that immigrants had to be hunted out, and that if reforms were not forthcoming, his followers would take up arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have no fear of taking things to the piazzas. We have 300,000 martyrs ready to come down from the mountains. Our rifles are always smoking,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Mr Alemanno has promised to tear down a £12 million museum around the Ara Pacis, an altar to the Emperor Augustus.</p>
<p>The sleek modernist building, designed by US architect Richard Meier, took more than a decade to build but was immediately labelled by one critic as resembling a &#8220;pizzeria&#8221;.<br>
