						<p>Hispanics now account for more than 15% of the U.S. population, and their surge is largely the result of births among people already in the country, according to new Census Bureau data.</p>
<p>In an annual report, the Census said there are 45.5 million Hispanics in the U.S., up from 35.7 million in 2000, when they made up 12.6% of the population. It said growth among Hispanics was responsible for half of the U.S. population gains between 2000 and 2007.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the 1990s, a flood of Hispanic immigrants explained most of the group&rsquo;s population rise. That has changed in recent years. Between 2006 and 2007, about 62% of the increase in Hispanics came from births.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hispanics increasingly are venturing beyond their traditional centers of population and moving to the Southeast and the Midwest, in search of better opportunities and a lower cost of living.</p>
<p><b>Key to Survival</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Latinos will become increasingly important because of their sheer numbers,&#8221; said Daranee Petsod of Grantmakers Concerned with Immigrants and Refugees, an advocacy group.</p>
<p>Growth in spending by Hispanics is likely to outstrip that of the general population in coming years. Hispanics control more disposable income than any other minority group. The figure stands at $860 billion a year and is expected to hit $1.3 trillion by 2012, according to Jeffrey Humphreys, who monitors Hispanic demographic and economic trends at the University of Georgia&rsquo;s Selig Center.</p>
<p>In recent years, consumer-goods companies such as Procter &amp; Gamble and other businesses have invested significantly more advertising dollars to reach Hispanics, both in Spanish and English.</p>
<p>Between 2000 and 2007, 16 states &mdash; among them West Virginia, Illinois and New Jersey &mdash; saw their white population decline, according to the new Census data. Over the same period, whites accounted for a majority of population growth in only 11 states.</p>
<p><b>Younger on Average</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hispanic families tend to have more children. The population is also younger on average, so the large number of births isn&rsquo;t balanced out by deaths. Between July 2000 and 2007, there were 8.4 Hispanic births for every death. African-Americans had 2.4 births per death. The ratio for whites was 1.6.</p>
<p>As Americans age and the baby boom generation retires, Hispanics may help buttress the economy and the Social Security system. The average white woman in the U.S. has 1.8 children, which is under the replacement rate of 2.1 necessary to maintain a stable population. Hispanic women, meanwhile, give birth on average to 2.8 children.</p>
<p>According to the Pew Research Center, whites are projected to make up only 45% of the working-age population in 2050, down from 68% in 2005. The center projects that the share of Hispanics in the working-age population will rise to 31% from 14%. The ratio of senior citizens to working-age people age 25 to 64 will grow to 411 seniors per 1,000 working-age people in 2030 from 250 per 1,000 in 2010, according to Dowell Myers, a demographer at the University of Southern California.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many immigrants are bypassing traditional gateway states in the Southwest, while many U.S.-born Hispanics have left states like California. &#8220;They are finding it more difficult to find work at the cost of living that&rsquo;s needed in some of the initial gateways&#8221; like California and Arizona, says William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. There are shifts within the gateway states, as well.</p>
<p><b>Settling in Small Towns</b></p>
<p>Hispanics have also settled in small towns, to take jobs in such industries as meatpacking, textiles and construction. The children of Latin American immigrants are helping offset a decline or slower growth in the school-age population in states such as Georgia and Iowa. In Minnesota, the Hispanic population grew 166% during the 1990s, almost three times the rate for the country overall.</p>
<p>Many of these Hispanic communities are now growing swiftly even without taking immigration into account. &#8220;The base population of Hispanics already here is so large that it is virtually impossible for immigration to play as important a role in population growth as it has historically,&#8221; said Mr. Humphreys of the University of Georgia.</p>
<p>The spreading out of Hispanic workers is causing changes in communities across the country, and some stresses. Communities must address language difficulties and educational needs of Hispanic students, who have historically scored lower on standardized tests than other students and recorded higher dropout rates.</p>

					<p>This is really scary.</p>
<p>The assertive invaders are on their way to &#8220;peacefully&#8221; take over America, and liberals and other morons are reading themselves to congratulate Mexicans their victory.</p>
<p>We all need to push for deporting every single illegal alien in the <span class="caps">U.S., </span>particularly all those who openly protest on the streets and bark threatening demands.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we all need to show them that they are not welcome here. Anything short of that would be a case of collaboration with the enemy.<br>

					<p>  We are now hopelessly swamped. Any hope of the United States ever being a &#8220;white&#8221; country again have vanished. Whites are already a minority in California and shrinking fast. With the declining white population, so goes the quality of life we Americans once took for granted not long ago.  Gone forever.</p>

					<p>As was pointed out in so many places, including blogs I have written, all through the 1970&rsquo;s Americans were told that overpopulation is a threat, and that it is irresponsible to have too many children.(Population Bomb,1968, Paul R. Erlich) As always, this doesn&rsquo;t apply to Mexicans, Chinese, Koreans, or any other group that has been coming to this nation and has, shall we say, a lot of kids.</p>
<p><span class="caps">P.S.</span> That&rsquo;s funny, I haven&rsquo;t heard a peep out of Erlich and other environmentalists for years now.  </p>

					<p>This is bad news. As their numbers grow, so does their influence. Canada is an example of what happens when there are two dominant and different linguistic groups in the same country, even if their cultural values are largely similar. The Hispanics will be able to demand recognition of Spanish as a defacto official language, most likely state by state. Proficiency in Spanish will become a requirement for politicians to succeed in federal office, thereby skewing American domestic - and foreign - policies considerably. And talk of separatism will inevitably brew (Aztlan, anyone?). Canada&rsquo;s seen all this with two linguistic groups, and it led to balkanization, economic turmoil, narrow misses re: breakup (twice officially), and as one Quebec politician put it, &#8220;a never ending trip to the dentist&rsquo;s office.&#8221;</p>
<p>Be warned, Americans, the end result of Hispanic dominance will not be pretty. And as Mexico is right next door, the potential for statewide separatism may be more likely than is the case for Quebec seceding from Canada.</p>

&#8220;&hellip;Hispanics may help buttress the economy and the Social Security system&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get it, what segment of the economy will the hispanics buttress?  How many sectors of the economy have a high demand for &#8216;illiterate, uneducated peasants?&rsquo; </p>
<p>According to Hispanics: A Statistical Portrait:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Hispanics drop out of high school at three times the White rate and twice the black rate. </p>
<p>Even third-generation Hispanics drop out of school at a higher rate than blacks and are less likely to be college graduates. </p>
<p>The average Hispanic 12th-grader reads and does math at the level of the average white 8th-grader&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p><a href="/reports/Hispanics/HispanicsReport.html" rel="nofollow">/reports/Hispanics/HispanicsReport.htm</a></p>
<p>Yes, those are certainly the requirements employers need for a high-tech, post-industrial, fiercely competitive global market.</p>
<p>As for the Ponzi-scheme Social Security system  &mdash;  I wonder how the hispanics and their anti-White, racist &#8216;leaders&rsquo; feel about their SS taxes used to support a largely White, elderly population?</p>

					<p>Well, as the old saying goes, figures don&rsquo;t lie but liars figure!</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the 1990s, a flood of Hispanic immigrants explained most of the group&rsquo;s population rise. That has changed in recent years. Between 2006 and 2007, about 62% of the increase in Hispanics came from births.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As should be obvious, this greater increase by way of births currently is directly related to the mistakes that allowed the flood of Hispanic &ldquo;immigrants&rdquo; or their whelps to become citizens, through such nonsense as amnesties and &ldquo;birth right&rdquo; dictates. In and through the 1980s keep in mind, Hispanics only made up about 3% to 8% of the population; from 1979 through 1989, the country was about 84% white in the beginning of the decade and down to about 77% white by its end. By the 1990 Census we made up 76% of the population and only 69% of it by the 2000 Census; today, we are at best 65% or 64% of the population in the <span class="caps">USA. </span></p>
<p>Or put another way, had the 2007 amnesty went through, the increase in the &ldquo;legal&rdquo; Hispanic population would be again through &ldquo;immigration&rdquo; and not births, then in the following years, should no other amnesties go on to become law, then births would  become the main source of increase for Hispanics, as they are supposedly now.  </p>
<p>The same holds true for the workforce age population. It might have been 68% white in 2005 and may be only 45% in 2050; however, had not an amnesty ever occurred, had not our immigration laws been revised in 1965, had not the country ever been less than 89% white by law instead, what percentage of the workforce would have been white then or probably forever into the future?</p>
<p>I would guess 92% or better?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

Call it a racist stereotype, but the majority of Latinos I see look like thugs that just got out of jail or on their way in.</p>
<p>Few (and I do mean few) young Latinos dress for success, at least in the business field. Most are decked out to look like gang bangers. None of the Latinos I see standing around are wearing suits and ties or even business casual.</p>

					<p>Whites need to have more children and encourage the poor to have less.  If a person can not feed or take care of their offspring then let Gov&rsquo;t give them rubbers or free abortions.  Don&rsquo;t have children if you are poor or especially single because WE <span class="caps">DON&rsquo;</span>t <span class="caps">WANT</span> TO <span class="caps">SUPPORT THEM. </span> Working white middle class people do not want to be enslaved with high taxes, non-white on white crime, and put up with Governmental laws that oppress their children by the racist laws that prevent opportunities for their children at the expense of free education for non-Americans, affirmative action racist policies, and the like.   </p>

<p>On the one hand you are right, the first thing you do when you are in a hole is stop digging. </p>
<p>On the other hand deporting illegals won&rsquo;t really change anything because as the article points out the massive birth rate of hispanics renders the immigration issue moot as they are taking over one way or another as their children are all non deportable full fledged citizens. The United States as you know it is effectively finished.</p>
<p>We are probably going to have to have all new nations sooner or later carved out of the dying nations of Europe and North America once everything goes to hell. This is what should be the long term goal.</p>

					<p>The Hispanic population can only climb so quickly only so long as A) there is a white populations large enough to pay taxes and provide them jobs to subsidize their babymaking and B) we are willing to tolerate them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure whether (A) or (B) will fail first, though I&rsquo;m guessing they&rsquo;ll fail roughly at the same time. Look at how pissed Americans have gotten just with the increase in the price of gas. Our economy is a house of cards and the slightest breeze will bring it down. Then people will be willing to deal with the uncomfortable issues facing us.</p>
<p>In the end, the 14th Amendment won&rsquo;t stand, and it&rsquo;s revocation will be retroactive.</p>

					<p>This site should also post the May 1, 2008 article from the New York Times that explains how a majority of children under 5 years of age are now basically majority non-White.  The future is already predetermined.  We have reached the point of no return.  We are losing our nation ever more rapidly.  The politicians in Washington seem almost glad to displace us with a new underclass.  What is left to do?</p>
<p>There is no where left to run.  Every corner of America is being overwhelmed with Third Worlders.  In effect we are being invaded and yet we are incapable of fighting back.</p>

					<p>This is why I&rsquo;ve been telling people for years that although American blacks are no picnic, the real threat comes from Latinos. I&rsquo;ll take an honest American black over some pushy, ungrateful, Latino foreignor any day of the week. Furthermore, whites are much more likely to intermarry with Latinos than they are with blacks. This is a key reason why Latinos pose the greater threat to the demographics of the <span class="caps">USA.</span> Off the top of my head I can rattle off a lengthy list of white male acquaintances with whom I grew up who are married to Latinas and can only think of one who married a black woman. As for me, I&rsquo;m still holding out for a decent white woman despite the fact that I&rsquo;ve had more than several Latinas show interest in me. </p>

If we ever get the guts to stop letting them in and deport the illegal ones (and some of the legal if it deems necessary), I want those bastard whites that enabled and supported them deported with them.  I rather see them these whites hanging from the streetlights but I know that will never happen.  In fact, these traitors get taken care of first!<br>

					<p>Before illegal immigration by Mexicans really went into <span class="caps">OVERDRIVE, </span>hospitals in communities along the <span class="caps">U.S.</span>-Mexican border, and especially in Texas, were driven to the brink of bankruptcy   &mdash;   by thousands of Mexican females wanting to birth their babies in those American hospitals. For the dual purpose of obtaining <span class="caps">FREE </span>natal care, and gaining a foothold in America through the &#8220;anchor baby.&#8221; </p>
<p>Before our Houston Chonicle caved in to the will of our burgeoning (and unwanted) Hispanic poulation   &mdash;   the Chronicle used to run stories detailing this outrage!</p>

					<p>Revolting article. I hope that there is a special outer chamber in Hades for the Global &#8220;Elite&#8221; (Illuminati?) who have engineered such massive destruction of which their ancestors assisted in creating. What is the purpose of destroying the High Cultures of the world? Is it to be able to more effectively dominate the &#8220;masses&#8221;? </p>
<p>When the &#8220;Elite&#8221; see the results of their horrible scheme, they will condemn themselves to an outer chamber of hell. </p>
<p>Appalling. All of this. And we as the Founding Race of the <span class="caps">USA </span>and Europe cannot stem the tide. <span class="caps">UNLESS</span> WE <span class="caps">BECOME VOCAL AND YES, EVEN BRUTAL.</span> Tancredo has countless quiet supporters but it is now or never to speak up and demand our nation back. The third-worlders are not ours and never could be.</p>

					<p>Has anyone noticed that the mainstream media continues to stick to the 12 million figure when talking about illegals? </p>
<p>When I got back to the US from France after 20 years there in 2004, the msm was using the 12m figure, even though that same msm was readily admitting that the annual illegal invasion rate is at least .5m (not counting legal immigration). A simple google search confirms this.  </p>
<p><span class="caps">WHY HAS THE</span> 12 <span class="caps">MILLION ILLEGAL ALIEN INVADER FIGURE NOT BEEN MODIFIED</span> TO <span class="caps">REFLECT REALITY</span>??  </p>
<p>By the msm&rsquo;s own admissions, the illegal invader figure should now be AT <span class="caps">LEAST</span> 14 million, a figure one would have to arrive at by their own logic.  Whereas in reality we all know that the figure is <span class="caps">MUCH MUCH HIGHER</span>: I would venture to say that <span class="caps">THERE ARE CURRENTLY</span> NO <span class="caps">FEWER THAN</span> 30 <span class="caps">MILLION ILLEGAL INVADER ALIEN PARASITES</span> IN <span class="caps">THE UNITED STATES, THE VAST SCREAMING MAJORITY</span> OF <span class="caps">WHICH ARE FROM MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA. </span></p>

					<p>Some of the fears are grounded in reality, others are not.  Unlike other minorities, some Hispanics have deep roots in Europe and are intelligent.  Most importantly, many have assimilated.  That&rsquo;s not to say there&rsquo;s not a huge problems in areas where illegals have invaded.</p>

					<p>It is clear that a combination of leftist ideology and business interests has won the day. This leaves whites in an almost impossible position. We cannot just stop immigration. We must either repatriate Latino (and Asian) citizens or lop off the Southwest and retreat to defensible white-majority States. But there would be a tremendous outcry if we tried to repatriate non-white citizens. We would probably need to amend the Constitution in order to counter the lawsuits. By the time we convince enough whites to defend themselves (assuming this is possible), the non-Hispanic white population could be less than 50% in the <span class="caps">US.</span> We may not have enough political power by then to do anything even if we wanted to.  <br>

					<p>These figures are nothing new.  At Numbers <span class="caps">USA </span>it has been know for a long time that at current rates of immigration, during this century the population of the US will reach the one half billion mark (up from 300 million today) and that all of the additional population will come from immigrants and their children.  This doubling of the population since 1965 will include only non-white, low skilled legal and illegals, most of who do not speak English.  This population boom will not pay for social security.  In fact because of its characteristics(low education, high HS drop out rates, etc) it will be the net recepient of a massive transfer of wealth from the white population which will become a minority as of mid-century.  Anyone who says that massive immigration of third world peoples is a cure for the entitlements of the aging baby boomers (social security and medicare) is simply a lier.  The effect of doubling the yearly immigration into the US would only add one extra worker paying into social security.  Remember, that for every additional immigrant the net purely financial cost approaches $100, 000 over their lifetime.  This does not, of course, include other costs such as social, cultural, etc.  Thus, just continuing the current system will bankrupt the country by mid-century and by the end of the century there will no longer be a country in any way identifiable as the United States that we were born into.<br>
Things to do are simple:<br><br>
1. A total complete halt  to all further immigration(including family reunification of those already here)<br><br>
2. Legislation which will eliminate the so-called &#8220;anchor baby&#8221; interpretation of the 14th amendment<br><br>
3. Vigorous enforcement and deportation of all illegals now.</p>
<p>Thus, we know what to do and we know what the consequences of not doing it will be.  Anyone who does not support these proposals is, in one word, a traitor.</p>

					<p>In the end, the 14th Amendment won&rsquo;t stand, and it&rsquo;s revocation will be retroactive.</p>

<p>I pray that you&rsquo;re right.  These Third World Invaders have been gaming the system for years, and now we&rsquo;re seeing the results.</p>
<p>America is truly at a tipping point.  It&rsquo;s either use it or lose it!  It&rsquo;s either now or never&hellip;  We must rise up and take our stand in no uncertain terms!</p>
<p>We can forget having an American President with the three bozos selected by our corporations, but we can gain control from the bottom up!  </p>
<p>As for Mayor Antonio (of LA)&hellip;  He should be fired and sent back to his home town of Tijuana!  Police Chief Bill Bratton and the LA City Council members can join him as well.</p>
