						<p>From his first day at Morehouse College &mdash; the country&rsquo;s only institution of higher learning dedicated to the education of black men &mdash; Joshua Packwood has been a standout.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s his skin that has made all of this an anomaly. This month, Packwood is set to take the stage and address his classmates as the first white valedictorian in Morehouse&rsquo;s 141-year history.</p>
<p>The 22-year-old from Kansas City, Mo., will graduate Sunday with a perfect 4.0 GPA and a degree in economics.</p>
<p>He could have gone elsewhere, to a school like Columbia, Stanford or Yale, but his four-year journey through Morehouse has taught him a few things that they could not, and he makes it clear that he has no regrets.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve been forced to see the world in a different perspective, that I don&rsquo;t think I could&rsquo;ve gotten anywhere else,&#8221; he said. &#8220;None of the Ivies, no matter how large their enrollment is, no matter how many Nobel laureates they have on their faculty .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. none of them could&rsquo;ve provided me with the perspective I have now.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Impressive credentials</b></p>
<p>When Packwood applied to Morehouse, he had frequent conversations with George Gray, an alumnus who was a recruiter at the school. Gray was impressed by Packwood&rsquo;s credentials and spent months trying to talk the sought-after senior into choosing Morehouse over other elite schools.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After several conversations, Packwood began to suspect that Gray had no idea that he was white. His suspicions were confirmed when one of Gray&rsquo;s calls caught Packwood in the middle of track practice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&rsquo;t let the white kids walk you down,&#8221; Gray quipped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; Packwood re-sponded. &#8220;You know I&rsquo;m white, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>Silence. Uneasy laughter. Confirmation.</p>
<p>&#8220;The challenge was to get the best student that we could, and Josh definitely fit that,&#8221; Gray said.</p>
<p>And for Packwood, knowing that he had been picked on his merits, and not as a token white recruit, made the difference.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It was not as if this was the first time Packwood experienced life in the minority. He was among the few white students in his class at Grandview Senior High School in suburban Kansas City, Mo. He has mixed-race siblings and his mother was married to an African-American. Packwood&rsquo;s experiences growing up have helped him navigate black culture while remaining comfortable with his own complexion.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Shortly after, his roommate arrived with his mother. Four years later, Packwood still can&rsquo;t get over the irony: After years of being one of a few blacks at majority-white schools in Dallas, Phillip Smithey had come to Morehouse to get the &#8220;black experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead, he was sharing a room with the only white guy in his class.</p>
<p>An honest voice</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Being surrounded by black men for his undergraduate career has taught him more about diversity, Packwood said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve been here for four years and yet, I cannot give you the definition of black,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I cannot tell you what a black man is. I really learned to look much deeper. It takes a lot of effort to know people.&#8221;<br>

<p>Wow. Can you imagine if a WHITE recruiter for some college said &#8220;Don&rsquo;t let the black kids walk you down.&#8221; to a prospective black student? He&rsquo;d be fired on the spot, make front-page news in the MSM and the only job he&rsquo;d ever be able to find again would be scrubbing toilets for minimum wage.</p>

			<p>There is a Black fixation among a lot of Whites, a stubborn belief that Blacks have access to some sort of special understanding, that they have &#8220;soul&#8221;.  I once knew a White guy who wanted to talk with Black prostitutes, in pursuit of this unknown quality.  It&rsquo;s as if they are trying to reconcile their belief in racial equality with the obvious inequality, by recourse to a spiritual g factor that Whites are sadly lacking.  </p>

			<p>I can&rsquo;t believe this guy spent four years roaming the &#8220;dark&#8221; corridors of Morehouse College. My hat goes off to him. I couldnt eat a meal in an all-black school cafeteria, never mind live amongst them for four years.</p>
<p>I know he&rsquo;ll never admit it in a million years, but he must realize how dim-witted the blacks are. Liberals in their lily-white communities never experience firsthand the black race and they always blame racism for problems of the black race. When you live and learn amongst them as this young fellow did, you will realize the truth.</p>

****************</p>
<p>Oh, see folks- it&rsquo;s ok. He only quipped it. It&rsquo;s just a cute and light-hearted comment from a college alumnus/recruiter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to know what prompted this racist to spew this gratuitous jab at whites in the first place, and during a school-sanctioned event no less.</p>
<p>Regardless, I&rsquo;m not surprised one bit by his comments, even as an educated black.</p>

			<p>  Of course this article was featured in Memphis&rsquo;s newspaper, &#8220;The Commercial Appeal&#8221;, commonly known to locals as the &#8220;Communist Appeal&#8221;. Anything anti-white and pro-minority is welcome and fits nicely with their format of demoralizing whites and uplifting nonwhites. This guy is just another race traitor-the die was cast in his life when his dear white mother succumbed to &#8220;jungle fever&#8221;-unfortunately for him after his mother produced him with a white man.</p>

			<p>It was probably SO easy to get a 4.0 at that &#8220;college&#8221;!  Look at who the competition was. If grades were on a bell curve, it was a cinch for him to be near the top.  Blacks just cannot compete in a meritocracy, as they don&rsquo;t have the intelligence to do so.  Black colleges are bastions of underachievement.  </p>

			<p>There are only a very few black institutions that it genuinely annoys me to see insulted. DON&rsquo;T EVER speak ill of the Tuskegee Airmen or General Benjamin O. Davis, and DON&rsquo;T down Morehouse College.</p>
<p>Morehouse does its best to produce genuinely educated, socially adjusted black men. The college accepts only those who show potential in the first place, and the potential is cultivated.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, there are hardly any other black educational institutions like it. And not surprisingly, a white student could spend four years there without being beaten, stabbed, mugged, hounded out, or even unduly harrassed.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to admire Joshua Packwood, and you&rsquo;ve got to admire Morehouse College. Wish there were more places like it, and more black males the caliber of its graduates. An upbeat story for a change here!</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let the white kids walk you down,&rdquo; Gray quipped.&#8221;</p>
<p>Its important to remember that this was said by a former alumni who now works as a recruiter.  Can you imagine if a white man said this to a black young person?  It would be international news.  The President would call for a moment of silence in order to meditate of white racism.</p>
<p>But now I ask you  &mdash;  Men of the West:</p>
<p>Are you prepared to live in a country where white people are the minority?  See Zimbabwe if you have any questions&hellip;</p>

			<p>  While I disagree with everyone here at AMREN about whites acting in a racially conscious manner I do dislike the term diversity. The term is nothing more than code for &#8220;Too many white guys.&#8221; Nobody ever complains about the lack of diversity in Harlem, the NBA, or any HBCU. It&rsquo;s just ridiculous how the language has been perverted. We need to start addressing the cultural rot liberalism has fostered the last 40 years then maybe we can get the country on the right track.</p>

			<p>To be effective, AmRen posters always need to tell the truth (and obey the law).  The truth is, there are a great many African-Americans and Hispanics who are smart, hard-working, and law-abiding, and who contribute to our nation.  Many of the students at Morehouse are in this category, and they should be recognized as such. </p>
<p>However, we also should tell the truth that Blacks, in general, have a lower IQ, act more on emotion than logic, are prone to amorality and criminality, and can&rsquo;t seem to delay gratification or work for the future.  These traits lead to poor choices and the abundant Black pathologies seen throughout Africa and everywhere else in the world where Africans congregate.  But, in spite of this, we should give Blacks (and Hispanics) their due, when it is deserved. </p>

<p>Of course his entrance was given to him.  All colleges, even &#8220;historically black&#8221; ones are under pressure to have a certain racial mix or they lose their government funding.  &#8220;Historically black&#8221; colleges also need nonblacks to boost the low graduation rates and raise the GPA average.  I would guarantee this guy only accepted after they offered to pay his tuition and other expenses.  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the faculty at Morehouse is going to deliberately create a situation where one White kid has better grades than the whole black student body.  After all, that would be embarrassing to the black students.  Oh wait, it already is. Maybe Whitey paid them off? </p>

<p>Moreover, many of their graduates go on to Ivy League Law schools Ph.D. programs, MBA programs, Medical schools  etc&hellip;<br>

			<p>Something sounds fishy about the story that the recruiter did not realize that Packwood was white, and it is this:  I can identify a black, with about 99% accuracy, just by the sound of their voice.  I&rsquo;ll assume that most blacks have same capability.</p>

			<p>I bet the recruiter from Goldman Sachs who brought him in for the interview thought he was going to satisfy his diversity hire quota.    </p>

			<p>This guy went to high school in the highly diverse Grandview area of Kansas City, which means he had plenty of &#8220;perspective&#8221; already.  He must have been immersed in black culture for a recruiter to think he was black over the phone - there are white people from black areas who talk and act black.  If he really wanted a new perspective, he should have gone to one of the Ivies, if it&rsquo;s really true that they would have taken him as the article states (I kind of doubt they were really interested in a Midwestern white boy from the Kansas City public schools, because that&rsquo;s the wrong kind of diversity).</p>

			<p>Darn, I should have gone to Grambling University - I probably would have been the class valedictorian there.</p>
<p>And to all of you jumping on Cassiodorus for what he said about the Special Olympics - so what?! It&rsquo;s not like the winner of the gold medal in wheelchair jai alai is going to appear on Letterman&rsquo;s show.</p>
