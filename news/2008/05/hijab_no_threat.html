						<p>The Muslim head scarf is no real threat to Quebec values and most women in the province wear it by choice, not out of coercion, concludes a commission on the integration of immigrants after a year of study costing $5-million.</p>
<p>In the final draft of their report &mdash; which was submitted to the provincial government yesterday and is expected to be made public at a news conference on Thursday &mdash; scholars Gerard Bouchard and Charles Taylor say Quebec society will have a lot to lose if it restricts the wearing of the Muslim head scarf strictly to the home and outdoors.</p>
<p>Saying the province&rsquo;s 130,000 Muslims, especially Arab Muslim immigrants, are &#8220;along with blacks, the group that is the most touched by different forms of discrimination&#8221; in Quebec, Mr. Bouchard and Mr. Taylor plead for an end to bickering over the hijab.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&rsquo;s finish with the head scarf, which has caused so much distress in the last few years,&#8221; the commission&rsquo;s chairmen say in their report, parts of which The Gazette obtained last week.</p>
<p>&#8220;In light of a great number of unequivocal testimonies, we can take it for granted &mdash; believe us &mdash; that the young girls or women who wear it give it various meanings and are motivated in contrasting ways, some of which, it&rsquo;s true, don&rsquo;t jibe with the dominant values of our society.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a footnote, the professors explain some of those different meanings: &#8220;Sometimes it signifies submission and oppression, pure and simple, sometimes prudishness, respectability and modesty, and sometimes a way of affirming one&rsquo;s identity or autonomy or even feminism.</p>
<p>&#8220;But by trying to combat these situations, isn&rsquo;t there a risk that we&rsquo;ll harm other citizens who made a perfectly clear choice? How is it possible to disentangle the two? And in the end, what happens to the freedom of each and every one to display her deeply held convictions, as long as they don&rsquo;t impinge on the rights of others and don&rsquo;t lead to anybody being put out?&#8221;</p>
<p>Devout Muslim women &mdash; a small minority of Quebec Muslims overall &mdash; suffer intimidation and discrimination in the Quebec job market for wearing the hijab &#8220;because employers fear getting demands for accommodations,&#8221; the commissioners say, recounting testimony from several Muslims in public hearings last fall.</p>
<p>They cite the case of a young hijab-wearing woman studying to be a pharmacist who &#8220;saw her job applications rejected by 50 pharmacies before she was finally able to land a job with an Arab pharmacist.&#8221;</p>
<p>The commissioners also write that the hijab is a lightning rod for a wide range of opponents in Quebec, all of whom see it in a negative light.</p>
<p>&#8220;Diverse voices are raised to denounce the Muslim head scarf: those of radical feminism, those of republican egalitarianism and &mdash; we heard various ways of it being expressed &mdash; also those of intolerance.&#8221;</p>
<p>That condemnation should not happen, they say.</p>
<p>&#8220;The freedom to manifest one&rsquo;s religion or one&rsquo;s conviction is recognized by all the great international legal conventions and by the Quebec charter [of human rights and freedoms],&#8221; they say in a footnote.</p>
<p>In another footnote, Messrs. Bouchard and Taylor talk of some Quebecers&rsquo; &#8220;often irrational&#8221; opposition to the hijab, which they see as a denial of a woman&rsquo;s femininity, a symbol of her submission to men and to God, or simply a restrictive piece of clothing better left in a drawer.</p>
<p>They quote from a brief submitted to them in November by a woman during their 17-city tour of the province: &#8220;In 2007, in Quebec, when a Muslim women wears the veil, I tremble,&#8221; the woman wrote.</p>
<p>The hijab should be greeted in day-to-day life as a possibility to connect with someone with a different way of life, according to Messrs. Bouchard and Taylor.</p>
<p>They also say it&rsquo;s wrong to think that all veiled Muslim women are somehow under a man&rsquo;s thumb. &#8220;There&rsquo;s a strong feminist current among Muslim women. It follows an original path and is a model that differs from Quebec feminism. It goes along with the wearing of the head scarf.&#8221;<br>

I can&rsquo;t say I feel any sympathy for hijab-wearing women encountering difficulties in the job-seeking and general public spheres. If I, as a man, showed up at a job interview wearing a dress and high heels, regardless of my qualifications, I doubt I would get hired. True, it would be my right to dress that way, and I couldn&rsquo;t get arrested, as Canadian law doesn&rsquo;t work that way re: cross-dressing. However, there are all sorts of unwritten rules that must be complied with in western society (and any society, for that matter), and appropriate attire is one of them. Hijab-wearing women are akin to dress-wearing men, in my opinion. It&rsquo;s unacceptable attire in Canada, and if you violate these sorts of codes of behavior, don&rsquo;t be surprised to find yourself excluded from employment and social circles. If these women really want to be accepted for wearing hijabs, they ought to leave Canada and move to the middle East.<br><br>

					<p>The swastika is no real threat to Quebec&rsquo;s values, and most women in the province wear it by choice, not out of coercion.<br>
Quebec&rsquo;s society will have a lot to lose if it restricts the wearing of the swastika.<br><br>

The swastika should be greeted in day-to-day life as a possibility to connect with someone with a different way of life.</p>
<p>If Moslems can have their symbols, why not Nazis too?</p>

					<p>Firstly: Submission is the very essence (and name) of Mohammedanism. How is it that they can so willfully submit on the one hand and act as if submission is tantamount to the rack on the other? Forgive me, that question should be: Doesn&rsquo;t it seem strange that a soul whose whole framework is based upon slavery* could have such a reaction to submission in other areas of life?<br>
Or is that a profane question?<br><br>
Maybe we should let those who wish to be worshipped answer it.</p>
<p>Secondly: It was mentioned in the squib beneath the title that opposition to the head-scarf was &#8220;irrational&#8221;. Frequently this is employed to silence criticism. We all well know that Araby did not suffer the delerium tremens of The Enlightment, but that isnt really an excuse for failure to recognize that not all parts of human life are governed by Reason, especially the best parts, such as Love and most of Metaphysics.<br>
The statement was made as though the group for whom they make special pleading are preeminently Rational, when it certainly appears that the contrary is true-even among the best of them.</p>
<p>Thirdly: Actually, lets skip this part. Pretzel Logic spoken in Academese makes my dinner sit uneasily on my stomach. If fatuity were a competition sport, we have some world class champions up there.</p>
<p>In parting, please allow me to notice outloud:<br>
This article tells us that a year long study was [perpetrated] to bring these things to light. Besides that, it cost $5,000,000.00.<br><br>
Lets see, if the diligent researchers got the weekend off during that year and a few scattered days off for &#8220;Winter Break&#8221; and the like, my mathematics tells me that that operation cost appx. $20,000.00 per day to run.<br><br>
I do not have the courage to figure what the hourly rate is, but Im sure one could hire a hotelroom of Dominatrices for less-even if the final effect is the same.</p>
<p>(*abject submission for commercial purposes)</p>

					<p>While Bouchard and Taylor are respected men (Bouchard is a sociologist and researcher of human genetics), their views have not been well received by the majority of Quebecois, who have a strong sense of ethnic-nationhood. </p>

<p><br>
I agree: it has caused a lot of distress, so let&rsquo;s finish with it. </p>
<p>Make all those who want to stay in Canada take off the scarf and start behaving like Canadians. And make all those determined to keep their scarf vacate the premises   &mdash;   and with no &#8220;right of return.&#8221; </p>

					<p>The headscarf is not a problem as it merely apparently symbolises the inability of Muslim men to control their rampant lust in public.   Apparently, covering up a woman&rsquo;s hair causes instant droopy feelings by the men who happen to see her!</p>
<p>Now the Burkah, the full covering, is another subject and must be resisted as criminals fleeing justice have escaped Britain, men dressed in such outfits, and as for driving a car in one, never on safety grounds.  After all, in countries that insist on them, the women generally are not allowed to drive anyway.   And when they say their religion states they must, ask them where in the Koran it says so.  Nowhere!</p>

					<p>The &#8216;veil&rsquo; is no threat whatsoever. We can all rest easy now. Best 5 million dollars ever spent. I suppose we should add on the subsidies to the journalism school. </p>

					<p>Apparently the women themselves think they are a threat. Despite the googly-gook above - women wear the veil out of modesty. Perhaps it&rsquo;s even all a part of their plan to conquer the West. </p>

					<p>These exotic foreigners shouldn&rsquo;t have been allowed into Canada (or any western country) in the first place. They should be told that if they live in the West, they should dress like Westerners. And since when has it been fashionable for women in our culture to cover their heads with scarves? Every time I see a muslim fanatic wearing one of those little headresses, I cringe. Quebec should follow France&rsquo;s lead and outlaw headscarves immediately! If you don&rsquo;t want to embrace Western values and culture, go back to where the hell you came from!!!!</p>

					<p>When you wear a headscarf you are effectively making a statement. The statement is &#8220;i am a muslim. I come from a culture that has totally different values from yours and if you don&rsquo;t like that, tough&#8221;. But I don&rsquo;t have to hire you either.</p>

					<p>I just can&rsquo;t wait til sharia rules in quebec.</p>
<p>I just can&rsquo;t wait til muslim is official language in quebec.</p>
<p>The quebecer&rsquo;s went after the english canadians for their bilingual rights.</p>
<p>Now they are going to be a minority in their own labelle province!</p>
<p>It will be funny to see a lumber jack wearing a hijab, and praying to mohamed on his prayer rug.</p>
<p>Maybe the young trudeau will finish the damage his marxist father started.</p>
<p>Just like the Kennedy&rsquo;s, traitors of the first order.</p>
