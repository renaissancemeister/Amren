						<p>As Maryland&rsquo;s white population shrinks, the number of minorities, and particularly Latinos, continues to increase, according to U.S. Census Bureau Figures released Thursday.</p>
<p>The figures indicate non-Hispanic whites in Maryland decreased by 21,428 between 2006 and 2007, while the Latino population of all races increased by 17,779.</p>
<p>Latinos now make up slightly more than 6 percent of the state&rsquo;s 5.6 million people, whose overall numbers inched up marginally in last year.</p>
<p>Whites represent 63.6 percent of Maryland&rsquo;s population, African-Americans 29.5 percent and Asians 5 percent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The growth of the Hispanic population in absolute terms in Maryland has exceeded the growth of the non-Hispanic population for the past three years.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Much of the growth in the Latino population can be attributed to immigration, Goldstein said. And, the number of minority births in Maryland has been creeping up since the beginning of the decade. During the past two years, minority births exceeded those of non-minorities.</p>
<p>Most children younger than 5 in Maryland are minorities, and public schools are majority-minority, meaning that minorities make up more than 50 percent of that population.</p>

<p>Is there some ironclad journalistic rule that prevents the use of &#8220;white&#8221; and &#8220;non-white&#8221; here?  Does the writer of this article realize how utterly absurd these sentences sound?</p>

			<p>Want to put a screeching halt to the non-white population explosion? It&rsquo;s very simple. STOP PAYING FOR IT! As the &#8220;majority&#8221; in this country we pay the lion&rsquo;s share of the programs that allow these people to have children at virtually no cost to themselves. Free food, healthcare, education, subsidized housing, daycare&hellip; all these things allow these people to reproduce prolifically with almost zero consequences. </p>

			<p>The last trip to Baltimore, Maryland was indicative of the descent of that state into demographic madness. Minorities stopping white pedestrians on the street and pestering them for change, cigarettes, and the offer of items for sale(stolen property?). My business, RV transfer driver, took me throughout southern Maryland, Washington D.C., and northern Virginia. </p>
<p>What seemed to be attracting ever greater numbers of these people was generous welfare, promoted by Maryland&rsquo;s left liberal, union dominated social and political ideology and the enormous government generated workforce that infested the suburbs around D.C. That workforce enjoying make work jobs, is extremely well paid. That promotes mobility. Metasticising of unhealthy population shifts is the result. </p>
<p>Due to the 60&rsquo;s ill conceived civil rights legislation, only white flight currently provides a way to escape the darkness spreading into Maryland.  </p>

<p>Maryland? Who would have ever thought Maryland would only be 58% White? I have not been to Maryland since 2000. Except for Baltimore all I saw was Whites. </p>

			<p>I understand simple arithmetic:<br>
6 + 63.6 + 29.5 + 5 = 104.1%<br>
meaning they are counting almost 2/3 (4.1/6) of the hispanics as both white and hispanic, otherwise they would not be able to hide the fact that whites are only 59.5% of the total:<br>
6 + 59.5 + 29.5 + 5 = 100%</p>
<p>Having a mixed race category might clear this up a little, it would sure help me fill out forms for my 2 Fil-Am children.</p>

			<p>Montgomery County, MD, sits right on top of the District of Columbia, is one of the most densely populated and fastest growing areas of the country, and hosts one of the fiercest and most active strongholds of MS-13.  </p>
<p>Added to the violent criminal El Salvadorans and the other unsavory grab-bag of illegal aliens from various dark continents are the untold numbers of black federal government employees and offspring that contribute to the rich, vibrant diversity of the area.</p>
<p>As a white male, every time I cross the Potomac river from Fairfax County, Virginia (no picnic either) into Montgomery County, MD, it&rsquo;s as if I&rsquo;m going from behind enemy lines further on into the very heart of darkness&hellip;the treatment I sometimes receive is downright hostile, and one occasion I actually had a nasty confrontation with a black guy in a restaurant who was almost shouting his opposition to the Iraq invasion, etc&hellip;I&rsquo;m certain that I&rsquo;ve encountered MS-13 members in other restaurants, too.</p>
<p>Journeying onward into Prince George&rsquo;s County, which occupies the Eastern edge of the District of Columbia, you might as well lock the car doors and stay on the beltway&hellip;PG County is about 80% black, and pubescent car thieves routinely steal cars in DC, only to cross into PG to evade capture.  Black public officials there seem to comprise a significant proportion of each week&rsquo;s arrest and corruption investigation reports in the Washington Post.</p>
<p>I was once asked &#8220;What&rsquo;s the longest bridge in the world?&#8221;  I didn&rsquo;t have the answer, so my associate provided it:  &#8220;It&rsquo;s the Woodrow Wilson Bridge (Alexandria, VA, across the Potomac to Prince George&rsquo;s County, MD)  &mdash;  it goes from Virginia all the way to Africa.&#8221;     </p>

			<p>Maryland has become a truly unpatriotic state.<br>
Its Socialist disease knows no bounds and its white population is an unspeakable shame.<br>
Even the Naval academy at Annapolis has become a state college lacking a basic warrior ethos after decades of social engineering.<br>
Recently a white officer was given a slap on the wrist after it was found she was moonligting as a prostitute for Pentagon staff.<br>
The only antidote to Marylands socialist status quo is Nationalism.<br>
Trajically, the people of the state will face a catastrophic emergency before the noton enters into mind.<br>

			<p>I spent a few months in Baltimore, the inner city is a disaster. Parts of it look like a scene from the movie &#8220;Escape From New York&#8221;. It&rsquo;s that way in parts of Los Angeles that once were nice areas also. (I grew up in Inglewood in the 50&rsquo;s). Everywhere the black man goes, things just get better, don&rsquo;t they?</p>

			<p>Howard in Las Vegas, I hope that you are being sarcastic because I have been living in Maryland since 1957, and I can&rsquo;t find any place here where all I can see is whites. Thanks to section 8, Harford County has fallen, its seat (Bel Air)a gang and drug infested dump. Montogomery and Howard Counties look like suburbs of Mexico City, Seoul and Calcutta. Annapolis is now overrun with black gangs and drugs. The Eastern Shore Counties and Southern Maryland have always been &#8220;historically black,&#8221; and are now almost as hispanic. All kinds of minorities are making their way to Carroll and Frederick Counties (how they can afford it - hmmmm) It&rsquo;s a small state. There&rsquo;s not much left!</p>

			<p>Western Maryland is actually quite nice and rural with fewer percentages of minorities.  </p>
<p>Poster at 7:12 on May 2:  The Census Bureau has been playing this sleight of hand trick for years.  It&rsquo;s just a deception to defuse White anxiety over immigration and changing demographics, nothing more.  I&rsquo;m not saying there aren&rsquo;t White hispanics but their numbers are a lot less than the 47% of hispanics who claim they are White.  When your driving on the Interstate and you see those small brown workers picking up trash off the highway, just remember they&rsquo;re classified as White so therefore they must be your racial brothers.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve lived in Maryland since 1966 and currently work in downtown Baltimore and live in Motngomery County.  It is true that PG County is a disaster area and that Baltimore is also a disaster area.  Montgomery County is not a disaster area but they&rsquo;re working on it as fast as they can.  </p>
<p>I actually had to chime in here becasue I have such intimate familiarity with D.C. and its Maryland suburbs.  I am bitterly opposed to illegal immigration or, at this point, any further legal immigration.  But I must say that the El Salvadoran population, which is quite dense and frankly excessive at this point, is not made up of criminal gang members. I know this MS-13 element is there, but this is just a lot of people you&rsquo;re talking about.  They are not hostile or unfriendly.  Our enemies are the Bush administration Wall Street Journal tyoes, and the left-lib creeps, who have prevented enforecement of sensible laws and reasonable limits. Noone in any country, at any time, should be made to endure an inundating tide of mass foreign migration at such a rapid pace that it transforms your nation overnight into an unrecognizable outpost of a foreign nation, contrary to overwhelming popular will and existing law.  It is offensive and intolerable.  But these people are just doing the most rational thing available to them, and on the whole are not hostile criminal trash as some psters seem to think.                </p>

			<p>I used to live in Northern Maryland near Thurmont and it was completely white.</p>
<p>In a few years, it will be overrun.</p>
<p>This is a sad thing.  If you know someone who has had an abortion or uses birth control, you should suggest that they not do those things any longer.  We need to stop this foolishness.  Support women who need it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not doing that well, folks.  Bring it in and make it work.</p>

			<p>Demographics is destiny. What will all these low-end Latinos do when they &#8216;mature&rsquo;? Start gang wars with the blacks, over home invasion territory (white property) Expect the smarter Latinos to come up with some real inventive ways to rip off the white people. They will probably have some gangland judges and lawyers by then, they have some of that now.  We all want it to end, but we need warm bodies in an &#8216;expanding&rsquo; economy. Problem is, the quality is not there. China and (upper cast)India would wipe the floor with our hispanics and blacks. </p>
<p>Time for a hispanic panic! Well, it seems its too late. It happened  SO quick. We must consider 40 million illegals with anchors.</p>

			<p>The Eastern Shore is getting less black due to all the whites who have moved here to get away from the blacks west of the Chesapeake Bay.  Hispanics chiefly live in any town on the Eastern Shore that has a chicken processing plant where they have replaced the blacks as the work force.  Otherwise, Hispanics are scattered about fairly lightly on the Shore as the only other jobs for them are as restaurant cooks, dishwashers and busboys.</p>

<p>Nicer areas are nicer not because they are &#8216;rural&rsquo;, but because they are white. Rural has NOTHING to do with it. Nothing!</p>
<p>As soon as these &#8216;rural&rsquo; areas are full of blacks, they will no longer be nice.</p>
<p>And if you can find one of the few densely populated areas left that is mostly white, you will also find that it is a &#8216;nice&rsquo; area - despite not being rural.</p>

			<p>I would never take a job in Washington DC.  There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any comfort zones (counties with over 90% White population) anywhere in the area within a reasonable commuting distance.  Maryland is out of the question and the bordering counties in Northern Va are in demographic flux.  Where do middle class Whites live? </p>

Yes, extreme western MD. is nice (white) as are a few spots east of the bay, but the politics here are punishing the white wage earner. 30% Black? yep, and it seems they all work in government. I have friends who work at the Social Security Headquarters complex, and for the D.C. Police Dept&hellip;man, the stories they can tell.</p>

			<p>Queen Anne&rsquo;s County, Maryland, the first county on the other side of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge, has dropped from 30 percent black in 1970 to about ten percent black today due to white migration.  As Maryland&rsquo;s Eastern Shore becomes both more exurban and a retirement area, it will become whiter still.  Home prices are reasonable.</p>
