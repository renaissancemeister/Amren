						<p>Hawaiian sovereignty activists calling themselves the &#8220;Hawaiian Kingdom Government&#8221; surrounded Iolani Palace this morning, refusing to let state employees either enter or exit the historical site, saying the palace and surrounding grounds are property of the &#8220;Hawaiian Kingdom.&#8221;</p>
<p>An unknown amount of state employees who work in the state archives division were trapped inside this morning, according to Russ Saito, head of the Department of Accounting and General Services, but since were allowed to leave, his office reports. The dozen employees who work there were sent home for the day. But several had their cars on site and cannot get them out of the palace parking lot. Saito says there are enough protesters to block with a human chain all five entrances and exits to the palace. They also locked the palace gates with their own locks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The palace&rsquo;s web site describes the palace as &#8220;A Hawaiian national treasure and the only official state residence of royalty in the United States, &lsquo;Iolani Palace was the official residence of the Hawaiian Kingdom&rsquo;s last two monarchs &mdash; King Kalakaua, who built the Palace in 1882, and his sister and successor, Queen Lili&rsquo;uokalani. During the monarchy period, the Palace was the center of social and political activity in the Kingdom of Hawaii. Though its grandeur was neglected after the overthrow of the monarchy, restoration began in the 1970s through efforts of concerned individuals. Restoration and preservation continues, and, as a result, today&rsquo;s visitors to this National Historic Landmark in downtown Honolulu enjoy one of the most precise historic restorations and learn much about Hawaiian history and heritage.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom McAuliffe, who works across the street, {snip} found the gates to the palace locked with signs posted saying the place now belongs to the &#8220;Reinstated Hawaiian Kingdom.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I asked to be allowed to pass on to the grounds and was told that only native Hawaiians were allowed in and that I needed to show an &lsquo;OHA registration card&rsquo; or recite my family genealogy. {snip}</p>

			<p>Does this mean they would rather be a satrapy of Japanese and Chinese money than a US state?</p>
<p>I hope Hawaii does become independent - really I do, because then the mountain west could also become independent.  We could charge &#8220;Aztlan&#8221; for the water what it is really worth, and retain the missile fields in Wyoming just in case someone didn&rsquo;t like it. There is no aguement like a W-79 to change someone&rsquo;s mind.</p>

			<p>It will be interesting to see if we will be able to muster the willpower to keep Hawaii as part of the United States.   The secessionist will keep pushing in Hawaii and may attempt some plebiscite effort to leave the country.   If we wish to maintain our historic borders we must prevent this as any cost because once we allow a precedent the deconstruction will begin and it is unlikely that we will be able to stop it.</p>
<p>The Mexicans are already openly planning to capture the southwest through immigration, both legal and illegal, and higher birth rates that will turn vast areas of the United States brown and hostile.   How long till someone in Alaska realizes they are sitting on a wealth of oil?  Don&rsquo;t think for a moment that we are immune to the forces that caused the Soviet Union to disintegrate.   It might be funny, if it wasn&rsquo;t going to be such a disaster, to see what happens to all the liberal elites that have worked so hard to destroy this nation and create a greater North American federation foiled when everything falls into chaos.  Who is going to protect all those useful idiot &#8220;citizens of the world&#8221; after they have destroyed the greatest free nation the world has ever known?</p>
<p>Enough pandering to multi-cultural balkanism.  Stop ALL IMMIGRATION today and stand up for white America.<br>

			<p>More interesting to me than the actual takeover are the several hundred comments on the Honolulu Star-Bulletin&rsquo;s article on this event.</p>
<p>Such virulent hatred, for Americans and the American government, spewing forth from the commenters. And what would an event like this be without stupid, foolish whites expressing their support and solidarity?</p>

<p>Personally, I feel its time to give them back their miserable nation. No alimony, no foreign aid, and we remove all bases. No right of immigration into the US either. When they sink back to primitive subsistence, as they were before the Western white devils showed up, when they have a living standard like Vanuatu, Samoa, Solomon Islands have today, we&rsquo;ll smile and say &#8220;You got what you wanted, now grow up!&#8221;.</p>
<p>Also, we should dump Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands, &#8220;American&#8221; Samoa, Guam, and the Northern Marianas while we&rsquo;re at it. <br>

			<p>Not allowed to leave the building? Isn&rsquo;t that forcible confinement? Isn&rsquo;t that against the law? Hawaii never, ever, should have been made a state. It was a bad mistake. Hawaii is just too different to be a good fit with the United States. They should have just given the islands their independence in 1959, like the Phillipinnes in 1948 and signed a 99-year naval lease for Pearl Harbor.</p>

			<p>In the lastest issue of &#8220;American Renaissance&#8221; writer Duncan Hengest suggested that the American government encourage Whites to move to Hawaii because in his opinion Hawaii is of vital military importance and &#8220;we can&rsquo;t give it up&#8221;. Well, I respectfully have to disagree. There ain&rsquo;t no way in hell I would move to an island filled with angry meth-addicted Hawaiians that are now seizing palaces and hunting Whites loike prey. &#8220;Kill haole(pro-nounced how-lee) day&#8221; and now this. Good luck Whites in Hawaii. I would not be surprised if Whites in Hawaii face the same fate as Captain Cook. </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve never understood why people love Hawaii so much. My pyschology professor loves Hawaii, but I point out to him that the natives do not want him or any Americans there. The whole point of course is to plant the seeds of nationalism, but it&rsquo;s not as easy with a mid-age Polish man from Detroit, who also has a doctorate in psychology.</p>

			<p>As a European, I have very little sympathy for US efforts to retain the non-White portions of its empire. Awakening national conscience in Hawaii is matched by awakening White consciousness in the continental US. Cut Hawaii and Puerto Rico loose! Our cause will never be credible if we claim our own freedom whilst denying the same to other movements in lands that have never been White.</p>

			<p>Hawaii is not part of the historical U.S.  Hawaii should not have been made a state.  Its people have nothing in common with Americans.  I wish them well; I don&rsquo;t care if native Hawaiians like or dislike white people.<br>
Secession and decentralization are more often good than not.  Next to go should be all the propectorates.  Then Vermont.</p>

			<p>Note to all you &#8220;just give Hawaii back to the natives&#8221; crowd, where will it stop?  Are we going to give North Carolina back to the Lumbees?  Montana, Wyoming, and Minnesota to the Sioux?  I wouldn&rsquo;t mind dropping the territories like Samoa, Guam and Puerto Rico especially if we could cease all welfare and developmental funds to these places.  Giving up states, however, is a horrible idea.  Thank GOD the southern filibusters decided to stop trying to push the United States all the way to the tip of South America. They did it just so we wouldn&rsquo;t bring hordes of brown brothers into a democracy with white America.  They knew that it would destroy the country and that the forced merger would be a disaster.   Too bad our current leaders don&rsquo;t understand our history better.   They must have seen the demographics regarding our population projections&hellip;what could they possibly be thinking?</p>

			<p>In 1941 Franklin Roosevelt ordered Commander in Chief, Pacific Fleet, Vice Admiral James Richardson to station the Pacific fleet at Hawaii.  The Admiral refused.  He wanted the fleet safely docked at San Pedro, California.  FDR relieved him of duty and replaced him with Admiral Husband Kimmel.</p>
<p>Kimmel followed FDR&rsquo;s order, and was undoubtedly deceived by FDR into leaving the Fleet under protected.  This led to the death of 2000 sailors and the destruction of the Pacific Fleet on December 7th, 1941.   Read the Pearl Harbor Myth by George Victor, (a FDR supporter), and Day of Deceit by Robert Stinnett.</p>
<p>The US government wastes billions of Americans&rsquo; money defending and guarding outposts which if they fell into enemy hands wouldn&rsquo;t matter one way or another.</p>
<p>Let me ask you this one question: How do you benefit by having Hawaii as a state?<br>

			<p>Don&rsquo;t the Hawaiian Police have riot gear? Police are famous for breaking up protests. Just ask anyone living in the 60&rsquo;s. This little &#8220;protest&#8221; could be broken up pretty quickly, I think,</p>

			<p>Hawaii joined the united states. At the time Japan was interested. If Japan had gained control, they would have massacred the natives and burned down the palace. This is what they did on Formosa in the 19th century. The US respected native customs and traditions, and encouraged them. I could care less about whether we should have the state that gave us B. Hussien, or give it independance, but the natives should understand that their ancestors made the best deal. </p>

			<p>Hard for me to read this article seeing as I&rsquo;m hawaiian, for the most part however I&rsquo;m very grateful that Hawaii became part of America. It is true that many hawaiians feel some anger toward the white man but few like me are not so bitter.</p>

			<p>I really don&rsquo;t see why the U.S. ever needed to make Hawaii a state in the first place. Unlike Alaska with its vast oil, gas, mineral and timber wealth, plus its rich fishing grounds, Hawaii has very little to commend itself economically. There is no significant Pacific power with the &#8216;reach&rsquo; or sealift capacity to even remotely threaten the west coast of America. Even if there was a tenuous military justification on geo-strategic grounds, a simple long-term naval lease should have been more then enough. Hawaii never had the pilgrims, the revolution, pioneers, wagon trains, the civil war, the transcontinental railroads; it was never a part of apple-pie old-school America. It has never had a White majority and it is culturally as alien to the American heartland as its flora and fauna is. It should not have been made a state in the first place. Hawaii as a state is like a saddle on a cow.</p>

			<p>I have to respectfully disagree with most of the posts here.  I say not only should we let Hawaiians have Hawaii we should let the so-called United States dissolve. (What exactly are we united about? That diversity is our strength?) The Hispanics will eventually overtake the southwest by shear numbers. Such is the nature of &#8220;democracy&#8221;. The question is where will we Whites retreat to.  I would gladly see the US become extinct if out of the ashes a 100% White nation can be established in, say, the northwest. I would rather live in a small White civilization than in a coast-to-coast polyglot nation of savages.  And if such a White nation could ever be formed the first law in its constitution should read:  This White Nation will NEVER again pick up the burden of trying to uplift the rest of humanity.       </p>

			<p>Maybe the US will finally listen and right the wrong done to the Hawaiian Nation. They were annexed, the Hawaiians never wanted to be a part of the US, it was done &#8220;for their own good&#8221;. Pretty much the same way the Native Americans were helped for their own good. The US took the best land, desecrated sacred places. Sound familiar. I say let Hawaii have Sovernity. Two US presidents have admitted we took Hawaii illegally. I guarantee that if the US had dealt with the Hawaiians fairly, this action would not have been pursued. I don&rsquo;t believe that whites in general will be treated badly in a new Soverign Hawaii. People get more radical when they are completely ignored. If you want to be welcome in a Soverign Hawaii, my suggestion would be to get some Aloha in your soul, and look at this problem from the side of the native population that is being priced right out of their own land, losing their culture and living in poverty while the whites and the japanese get rich off their ancestral lands.</p>

			<p>I have been to Hawaii a couple of times and I have to say it is quite beautiful.  Then again I don&rsquo;t live there so I can&rsquo;t say for sure that the native hawaiians harbor any type of resentment towards whites.  But the times that I have been there I have to say was quite pleasant. Although the only thing that bothered me is the commercialism specifically in Oahu.  I hate to see such a beautiful island being ruined with all that commercialism taking place.  In terms of scenery and just natural beauty, Hawaii arguably has the most on this earth. In fact this is a place where whites can seriously can establish a homeland or a colony once the revolution or whatever you call it takes place.   </p>

			<p>Hawaiians should consider that the very lucrative tourism industry exists mainly because it is a US state.  It is tropical and pretty, but one can spend dollars, the locals speak English, and the water is drinkable.  There are plenty of places where hotel rooms and food are cheaper.  For my own part, I&rsquo;d rather visit a place with some decent museums, like Vienna.  Austrians, being white themselves, don&rsquo;t openly hate me.</p>
<p>The food in northern Italy is better, and Greek beaches are every bit as good as Hawaiian ones.  For an exotic destination, Japan is a major improvement on Hawaii.  The locals don&rsquo;t hate you there, except for the occasional nightclub that doesn&rsquo;t allow gaijin - thanks to legions of misbehaving US servicemen, and language was never a problem for me; they were too eager to try their English out on me for my Japanese to get much of a workout.  </p>
<p>Even if I wanted to go someplace where I would be openly loathed, I think I&rsquo;d pick Tunisia, because the Roman ruins there are spectacular.</p>
<p>In the American states can be likened to a family, Hawaii would be the poodle: entertaining, noisy, and not really very important.</p>

			<p>All this wild talk of secession, while it would be perfectly legal, according to the constition, we rode that horse in the civil war. Although I doubt we could find anyone evil as dishonest Abe, who would be willing to start an actual war, to remove these people of their rights. There are vast differences here in the fact that, there are probably only a few real secessionists involved. States rights died at the hand of the union army. The outcome of that conflict,has, left a lot to be desired, in many ways.   </p>

			<p>One of the reasons native Hawaiians can get away with abusing the white minority is the fact that it has very restrictive gun laws. Every where CCW permits are granted crime has decreased. I would never live or visit a state that denies 2A rights to its citizens. Unfortunately there too many states that continue restrict 2A rights.</p>

			<p>Europeans built that Victorian palace as a gift for Hawaiian &#8220;royalty.&#8221;  That was payment for allowing the sugar cane barons to make kzillions planting sugar cane.  But the point is that this so-called Hawaiian &#8220;Royalty&#8221; lived in huts before that.  Compared to that, I am royalty and so are all of you!</p>
<p>But the hypocracy ought to stand out.  These natives always want what white man has built, and the wealth that goes with it, not just the land.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve got no special love for the place. I know people from there  - native Hawaiians, and Asians and they are nice people as individuals but viewed collectively I don&rsquo;t want to be around them nor have them in my nation. Who needs it? </p>
<p>Friends of my family who are white Alaskans moved to Maui in the early &rsquo;90s after a windfall of a commercial fishing season and their kids went to local public school there. One of the daughters revealed to me last time I saw her that in junior high the Samoan kids would beat up the other kids for their lunch money. Every time she was preyed upon in this way, even if a teacher witnessed the bullying and knew what was going on, it was she, the white kid, that had to do detention or miss recess while the actual perpetrator got to go scot free. Even though she was 13 at the time, the daughter knew she was being told she was not welcome there by the reaction of the teachers and staff to the problem. </p>
<p><br>
One thing that always irked me when in Hawaii was how the non-&#8220;haole&rsquo;s&#8221; there speak that abominable pidgin English and then wear it like a badge of pride, as if it&rsquo;s some great accomplishment that they sound stupid and butcher my languange in the process. Go find a cure for cancer first and then maybe you can have that haughty attitude. </p>
<p>What? You say the cancer research center won&rsquo;t hire someone who will only speak Pidgin! </p>
<p>Well congratulations morons, now you realize you have only yourselves to blame for your predicament, the evil &#8220;haoles&#8221; don&rsquo;t even enter into the picture. </p>
<p><br>
Having said all this I see both Taylor&rsquo;s side and those of the Hawaiian seperatists (and angry &#8220;haoles&#8221; like myself) who err on the side of the &#8220;good riddance&#8221; idea.) <br>
We illegally took over Hawaii in 1898, so I can totally see the rectitude in giving it back to them - without US aid afterward however. Taylor is thinking more strategically and geo-politically though and his argument I can also see. If we are going to remain a power in the Pacific and be prepared to challenge growing Chinese hegemony there, we will need Hawaii and its bases. A plan to re-populate Hawaii with Caucasians is a good option to secure this base area but isn&rsquo;t too likely. After all, with all the hatred of &#8220;haoles&#8221; they&rsquo;ve demonstrated for 110 years do you really think the non-whites of Hawaii are just going to step aside? Plus, white people world-wide are in a deomgraphic death spiral anyway which doesn&rsquo;t bode well for future outward moves to increase white progeny in hostile climes and locales. <br>

<p> Why do we need to be a power in the Pacific and challenge China? There are 12,000 miles of ocean between China and America. I see no need for the USA to be on the Asian Pacific littoral at all. We should leave South Korea and Japan and cut Taiwan loose. The USA is badly over-extended.</p>

<p>I agree with you ultimately. Yes, let&rsquo;s let go of these overextensions and &#8220;entangling alliances&#8221; (as Washington put it) and take care of our own. However, since the US has checked the expanding power of a rising China for so long, the government in Beijing may want us to get our come-uppence, particularly as we face rising debt and internal disunity due to run-away immigration. That being the case Hawaii could well be of strategic importance in the future - I didn&rsquo;t say immediately. I was merely opining that Taylor&rsquo;s viewpoint is not completely wrong-headed. I want what you want - the US opting out of the &#8220;world policeman&#8221; mode and all the encumberances (sp?) that that role brings. However, since we&rsquo;ve been on the tiger&rsquo;s back for so long, disengagement may not be so easily one and base areas - areas geographically close to the continental US mind you, I&rsquo;m not talking about lower Waziristan or even places in Japan or western Europe - may still be needed during such a demobilization. Just thinking out loud. </p>

<p> Why not give Hawaii its independence but sign a 99 year lease on Pearl Harbor. That should safeguard any legitimate defense interests while getting the Hawaiians out of our hair. There was serious talk in Washington in the late 1940&rsquo;s about making the Phillipinnes a state instead of giving them independence, as hard to imagine as that may be. Thankfully wiser counsel prevailed. Too bad that same logic wasn&rsquo;t extended to Hawaii.</p>
