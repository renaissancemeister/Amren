						<p>Musa Mogadi says he is better off since &#8220;the whites&#8221; came. He&rsquo;s got a new job, learned new farming skills, and he can chat on a mobile phone while zipping around the countryside on a motorbike.</p>
<p>Three years ago, Mr. Mogadi got by as a subsistence farmer. But he now earns a regular wage as a supervisor on one of this town&rsquo;s new commercial farms.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s applied skills he learned from some of the two dozen white Zimbabwean farmers who moved to Nigeria in 2005, after being kicked off their land by President Robert Mugabe and later attracted by large parcels of land on offer under 25-year leases and commitments of support from the Nigerian government.</p>
<p>Production on his farm is now up.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are starting to use fertilizers,&#8221; says Mogadi, explaining that he was encouraged to buy fertilizer after seeing yield benefits on the commercial farm. He&rsquo;s also started planting his maize in a more compact formation, like the Zimbabweans, increasing production from each field planted.</p>
<p>Before the Zimbabweans arrived, there was no mobile phone network in the area and so no reason to have a mobile phone. Now he and most of the other workers have snazzy cellphones, and many have bought motorbikes imported from China, often with a loan from their employer.</p>
<p>In the future, when the national power network reaches the Shonga farms, Mogadi is looking forward to having electricity in his home and village for the first time.</p>
<p>Kenny Oyewo, who works as a farm manager, thinks the lessons being learned in Shonga should be exported across Nigeria.</p>
<p>&#8220;If there were at least 20 white Zimbabwean farmers in each state,&#8221; says Mr. Oyewo, &#8220;Nigeria would become one of the most rich countries in the world and we would not even depend on our oil.&#8221; Nigeria is the largest crude producer in Africa, but despite the country&rsquo;s oil-wealth the majority of Nigerians exist on just a couple of dollars a day.</p>
<p><b>Key support from a governor</b></p>
<p>Bukola Saraki, governor of Kwara State, actively pursued the Zimbabwean farmers, approaching them through Zimbabwe&rsquo;s Commercial Farmers Union and paying for them to stay in a hotel in Kwara while they assessed several proposed sites.</p>
<p>To date, the governor remains personally involved in the project, visiting the farmers in their homes, taking their calls on his mobile phone and personally stepping in to help when Nigeria&rsquo;s confounding &mdash; and often corrupt &mdash; bureaucracy gets in the way.</p>
<p>The Zimbabwean farmers are all too aware how key Mr. Saraki&rsquo;s support is.</p>
<p>Another group of Zimbabwean farmers who set up in Nasarawa State, east of Nigeria&rsquo;s capital, Abuja, are close to abandoning their Nigerian venture.</p>
<p>There, farmers have not had strong support from the state authorities, a promised bridge to link their farms to the nearby capital has not been built and agreed-upon bank loans have not materialized.</p>
<p>But Saraki dismisses fears that the commercial farms may stumble with the end of his tenure in three years&rsquo; time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the project has sold itself,&#8221; says Saraki. &#8220;When we started there were a lot of people who did not believe in it. But I think by now, when we are employing about 3,000 people in Shonga, they are the ones that are going to defend it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oyewo, who is a university graduate and ne w to farming, says it&rsquo;s not just farm employees who are learning from the Zimbabweans. &#8220;Even local people have been encouraged to seek advice &mdash; and get it &mdash; from the farmers,&#8221; says Oyewo.</p>
<p>In the long term, veterinarian Abubakar Kannike sees great potential for collaboration to develop a new breed of dairy cow that could be exported throughout West Africa.</p>
<p>&#8220;The future for us is to develop our own dairy breed mixing the hardy local Fulani breed with the Zimbabweans&rsquo; high milk-producing Jersey cows,&#8221; says Mr. Kannike.</p>
<p><b>The lessons go both ways</b></p>
<p>But the lessons aren&rsquo;t all being passed in one direction. The Zimbabweans are learning how to deal with a new climate, a new way of doing things.</p>
<p>This area of Nigeria is a far cry from the cool sunny plateaus of Zimbabwe. It&rsquo;s relentlessly hot and close enough to the Sahara to be shrouded in dust-laden desert winds for months at a time. And in the low-lying tropics, farmers and their families are learning to cope with malaria.</p>
<p>White farmer Hunter Coetzee is paying close attention to Nigeria&rsquo;s weather patterns, earning a reputation among the rest of the groups as something of a meteorologist.</p>
<p>One of the steepest learning curves, farmers say, has been unearthing the hidden corrupt practices that mar Nigerian society.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our first year farming here, we bought our fertilizer off the market,&#8221; says farmer Irvine Reid. But when the yield was disappointing, they sent a sample of the fertilizer off for analysis. &#8220;There was next to no fertilizer, so little of the active ingredient in there, that we may as well not have bothered.&#8221;</p>
<p>But after a traumatic and often violent departure from Zimbabwe, the commercial farmers are learning about West African hospitality. &#8220;Everyone&rsquo;s been very welcoming,&#8221; says Reid, &#8220;and that&rsquo;s really nice.&#8221;<br>

<p>Oh, they&rsquo;ll be friendly for a while.  However, about the time whites make the country an acceptable civilization, there will be reports non-stop demonizing them with lies and boisterous claims that it was blacks who are responsible for it all.  </p>
<p>After that begins it won&rsquo;t be long before the whites will have to give-up their land again or be killed for it.<br>

					<p>I can&rsquo;t believe how stupid the whites are being.  Building an economic infrastructure <span class="caps">AGAIN </span>in africa.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an idea.  Move all the blacks out of the region and <span class="caps">THEN </span>build an economic infrastructure.  Use the money to buy advanced weapons and build up a military.  The next time a bunch of &#8220;war veterans&#8221; from the local black psychopaths militia show up, kill every single last one of them, then wipe out the capitol city of the offending party and put their leader&rsquo;s head on a pike.  When the UN clucks it&rsquo;s tongue at you, tell them to shut the hell up&hellip;.or else.</p>
<p><span class="caps">LEARN </span>from your mistakes people.  The price of not doing so&hellip;.well Mugabe and all the rest have made that clear.</p>

</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been told that this is not an uncommon mentality in Africa: the blacks are grateful for the jobs and affluence that whites bring to their communities, and do not mind admitting the superiority of the whites. Of course, this kind of mutually beneficial arrangement cannot last for long, because Marxist agitators will arrive sooner or later, teaching the natives to hate their benefactors.</p>

					<p>Whites show up in foreign lands and cultures and raise the living standards in just a few years. Blacks show up in foreign lands and cultures and become a permanent burden. And who gets villified? Left to their own devices blacks would be appreciative but their low IQs make them vulnerable to Marxists who stir the pot. </p>

<p>I tend to agree even though the naysayers here have a strong point in that such goodwill usually backfires.  Another thing we shouldn&rsquo;t forget is that it&rsquo;s to our benefit if blacks in Africa do well for themselves.  As long as Africa is a miserable hell hole, there will continue to be an exodus of blacks into other lands.  Left unchecked, this trend will eventually mean a world that is pretty much all black.</p>

					<p>I want to see these farmers do well, but I hope they learned to stay in contact with other whites, and always be armed. </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a very good reason why the British didn&rsquo;t put much effort into colonizing West Africa: it was too deadly. So dangerous in fact that the area was called &#8220;Black man&rsquo;s country, White man&rsquo;s grave&#8221;. The British sent convicts to penal colonies, and expected the prisoners to die there. Neat and Tidy.</p>

					<p>These Rhodesians will never learn. The truth is many White Africans love Africa and do not like leaving it. I knew one White South African who did not like life in England much. In Africa they had bigger houses, better weather and cheap servants. But I am really uneasy about these people going to Nigeria. </p>
<p>As someone who has come in contact with more than his share of blacks let me tell you, you can never trust them. Promises given by them are never to be trusted. This is definitely true about Nigerians, so much so that non Nigerian Africans are weary Nigerians. Most non Nigerian blacks do not trust Nigerians easily. They will make some of the grandest promises in the world and they use a mixture of charm and childlike behaviour to convince you. But they will deliver <span class="caps">NOTHING.</span> You will always loose something may it be money, time, life whatever. </p>
<p> I would consider Australia, Southern Brazil, New Zealand, Argentina, Uruguay and Chile as the best bets for White Africans. These places are similar to southern Africa in many ways. As far as Australia going over to the Chinese, well Africa is too. It will be much safer to farm and live in a Chinese dominated Australia which will always have a sizable White population than a place like Nigeria which has virtually no Whites. </p>
<p>And as far as the Earth becoming a black planet, forget about it. Asia and parts of Eastern Europe are guaranteed to remain non black.</p>

					<p>Most of the White ex-Rhodesians I have met routinely go into all sorts of contortions to assure me that they are not racists. They are, to be sure, barred from immigration to most White countries, whose traitor <span class="caps">NWO </span>regimes would like nothing better than to see them dead. Still, many Rhodesians cannot overcome their addiction to Africans, and some remain intensely proud of their World War II fighter pilots who helped shoot down what was perhaps the best and last hope for White racial survival worldwide. The Rhodesians in Nigeria will experience the same fate that they experienced in Rhodesia, and at the hands of the same destructive and envious primitives. </p>
<p>The Boers are a completely different case, thank God. What is it in the mentality of the Anglo-Saxons that causes them to invariably adopt the view &#8220;if you can&rsquo;t beat &#8216;em, join &#8216;em?&#8221;  <br>

By taking all their disciplined farming expertise/resources and amalgamating the same into a co-op business venture, would enable them to accomplish a better return on their labor in all these countries. </p>
<p>Although religiously-based, the Amish, Mennonites and Hutterites have done admirably well with their North American farming endeavors, and they too, were an oppressed people for different reasons.</p>

					<p>Perhaps here we can see a replication of how an advanced tribe, creative and innovative was eventually pushed out of Africa 50,000 years ago?  As we so often love to say, &#8220;History repeats itself.&#8221;  Eventually these whites will be pushed farther north where only the smart can survive against the harsher, colder climate.</p>

					<p>Yes,the White Zimbabweans will evenually make a paradise out of the hell hole that is Nigeria. After roads are built, elecrical lines are laid, cell phones and television sets become a norm, the same Marxists will make the native Blacks envious and resentful again - just like Black Zimbabweans did, who <span class="caps">BUTCHERED </span>their White farmers and drove them out - and the Black Nigereans will think they can run it. Within a couple of years&hellip;back to the Third World - this time for good. <br>
If I were one of those White farmers, I would have learned my lesson in Zimbabwe.</p>

<p> I agree, but somehow the <span class="caps">U.S </span>government is determined to make it harder for White Africans to go to the <span class="caps">U.S.A.</span> It would be easier for them to take up Spanish names and cross the <span class="caps">U.S</span>-Mexican border. Canada would rather have farmers from in rural India than White Africans, it seems.</p>
<p>  Anyways one more possible option is the vast expanse of Siberia. Of course the weather will be the exact opposite of Africa but there is hope there. I have heard many of my Russian friends say that they would want the &#8220;Right kind of immigration&#8221; which means Western Europeans and are tired of the &#8220;Wrong kind of immigration&#8221; which means the unwashed masses of Islamic Central Asia and the Caucasian mountains. Russians are leaving Siberia in droves for Moscow and St. Petersburg. The Russian government may be friendly to White settlers there to prevent Siberia from falling to the Chinese. I somehow feel Russia (and especially Siberia) will play a major role in the survival of the White race in the future. Maybe I should start taking classes in Russian.<br>

					<p>This is a very cruel joke. When the Mau Mau was at its peak, a lot of Kenyan whites left<br>
for Rhodesia and did they only thing they knew how to do, that was to plant tea. This<br><br>
was also the start of the Rhodesian tea industry. The greed of those wicked colonialists<br><br>
is only now coming to light.  When they planted maize, they needed a yield of 8-10 tons to support their lavish lifestyle, leaving no market for the indigenous farmer. Now<br><br>
that they are gone, their replacements are only growing an average of two 2 tons, thus ensuring that there is a market for every ear, currently selling at $100,000 each. </p>
