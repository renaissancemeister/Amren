						<p>Antonio Martinez used to pay smugglers thousands of dollars each year to sneak him into the United States to manage farm crews. Now, the work comes to him.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Martinez, now a legal employee of U.S.-owned VegPacker de Mexico, is exactly the kind of worker more American farm companies are seeking. Many have moved their fields to Mexico, where they can find qualified people, often with U.S. experience, who can&rsquo;t be deported.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>American companies now farm more than 45,000 acres of land in three Mexican states, employing about 11,000 people, a 2007 survey by the U.S. farm group Western Growers shows.</p>
<p>There were no earlier studies to document how much the acreage has grown. But U.S. direct investment in Mexican agriculture, which includes both American companies moving their operations to Mexico and setting up Mexican partnerships, has swelled sevenfold to $60 million since 2000, Mexico&rsquo;s Economy Department told The Associated Press.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the latest move south has been fueled by something new, farmers say: a way to continue to deliver cheap, fresh farm goods amid the current U.S. political standoff over an estimated 12 million undocumented immigrants, the majority from Mexico.</p>
<p>Recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids have targeted major agricultural producers, including Del Monte Fresh Produce in Portland, Oregon, and several large packing plants across the nation &mdash; scaring away immigrants and persuading many agricultural employers to clean up their hiring practices.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many of the growers, once based in California&rsquo;s Salinas Valley, are also heading south to escape high land prices and water shortages. Mexico is closer to eastern U.S. markets than California, they say. Shipping times to Atlanta are a day shorter from Mexico&rsquo;s central Guanajuato state.</p>
<p>Not everyone in Mexico has welcomed U.S. companies. Mexican farmers complain that they have driven up land rental prices. Many local growers worry they can&rsquo;t compete against big, foreign firms, said Felipe Sanchez, president of a farmers group in Guanajuato state.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Farm workers at U.S. companies in Mexico make two or three times Mexico&rsquo;s minimum wage of $4.80 a day. But they still earn far less than the average $9.60 an hour that field workers in the United States made in January 2008, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some experts argue that farmers simply refuse to raise U.S. wages to compete with other industries, something they say would help ease the labor crunch.</p>
<p>As the United States heads into a recession, more native-born workers might consider agricultural work if wages were high enough, said Harley Shaiken, director of the University of California at Berkeley&rsquo;s Center for Latin American Studies.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The problem is that cheaper labor in Mexico often is offset by lower productivity and high training costs, especially when it comes to enforcing U.S. food-safety standards.</p>

					<p>American farmers weren&rsquo;t hiring Americans anyway, so why do we care if they move their operations to Mexico?</p>
<p>This is what free trade was always supposed to be about: you don&rsquo;t have to import workers - you can manufacture overseas and import the products. The upside is that with importing the product you don&rsquo;t import more crime, more welfare cases, or more radical leftwing voters.</p>

					<p>Fine with me.  </p>
<p>Let our commercial farmers outsouce the work to where the labor is cheap.  Thus, the need to bring in Mexicans into the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>is that much diminished.  It is a win-win situation; cheap food for the American consumer without the &#8220;cheap&#8221; labor here in the <span class="caps">U.S.</span></p>
<p>But the real answer to many of our current maladies is to get real Americans to homestead our own rural areas.  Imagine owning several acres out-right with no mortgage and producing your own organic fresh food.  This is the real freedom Thomas Jefferson envisioned for his people.  Free independent farmers on their own land producing much of what they need free of government is what we should strive for.     </p>

					<p>Yep where Mexican farmers allow children as young as 8 to work in their fields.  There was a well documented case a few years ago about an 8 year old being run over by a tractor - just a few weeks ago they interviewed his 12 year old sister who still works on the same farm.</p>
<p>Anything for lower taxes!  No child labor in the US?  No problemo!</p>

					<p>Here is a thought.  I know it is radical.  Still, please consider.</p>
<p>How about the Federal Government enforcing immigration laws already on the books?</p>
<p>Maybe we should see how that works?</p>

					<p>You can&rsquo;t own land in Mexico.  Just a matter of time before some corrupt officials decides to return it to the glorious peoples republic of Mexico.</p>

					<p>In a just world, the parasitical looters running agribusiness would be forced to live in Mexico and the <span class="caps">I.T. </span>robber-barons forced to live in India.</p>
<p>As Alan said, they weren&rsquo;t hiring Americans anyway, so this one is a &#8220;no harm, no foul&#8221; in my playbook.</p>

					<p>All over California, there is a movement to grow things locally.  For the first time ever, I am setting up a veggie/fruit garden on my 2nd floor deck. Americans need to understand that we will have major problems feeding ourselves if we pay for fuel to truck our food from coast to coast.  Get your friends and neighbors to grow complementary items, and trade.  I am going to try to get some public areas (medians, etc) to be handed over to gardeners, with the city continuing to pay for water bills.</p>

					<p>I have written McCain and told him his stance on drilling for oil within our borders must change. He also needs to enforce the already existing immigration laws. I have yet to hear from his office. Sooner or later the people must stand up and take action. Once we show the world we will take care of our own oil problem the price of oil will drop. Once we enforce the immigration laws that already exist our nation will again be soverign. We the people must change the nation. We the people must remove the people from office that do not represent our best interest. </p>

					<p>It doesn&rsquo;t seem like a sound idea to for the US to rely on other countries to supply food.  I worry about the hygiene habits of Mexican laborers out in the fields.  In the US at least there are portable toilets but I kinda doubt that in Mexico.  Someone could squat in a field and wipe their hands on the lettuce, spinach or whatever else is growing.  I remember a story about contaminated strawberrys from Mexico a few years back.  They had been washed in dirty water.</p>
