						<p>Hispanics might be the most visible growing population here in Iowa, but it&rsquo;s not the only one. Another immigrant group in Iowa has grown even faster the past year. The African immigrants are still getting used to electricity and running water.</p>
<p>160 Burundian refugees have resettled in central Iowa in the past year. Back in 1972, many families escaped the ethnic violence and genocide taking place in Burundi, and resettled in refugee camps in neighboring Tanzania, another impoverished country that could provide earth to live on, but little else.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>All these Burundians, like Simon Bucumi, were selected by the US government to take part in the refugee program, a life-saving break. &#8220;In the refugee camp you don&rsquo;t know your future because you don&rsquo;t have any plan for your life and your family and your future,&#8221; said refugee Simon Bucumi. &#8220;People die young because of frustration.&#8221;</p>
<p>Simon and his son were lucky to be among the small percentage selected each year. Like all the Burundi Iowans, they have loved ones in Tanzania, and so far no way to find them in the massive camps. Their string of luck continued here in Iowa, where for the first time Simon has met people anxious to help.</p>

<i>&#8220;It&rsquo;s unbelievable to him. He can&rsquo;t believe somebody would waste their time and come over here and teach them and try to help them be self-sufficient in their life,&#8221; Bucumi&rsquo;s translator said.</i></p>
<p>Yes, he comes from a people who can&rsquo;t and don&rsquo;t help each other hence, the notion of helping others is alien. He also realizes it&rsquo;s a waste of time for the people who do help.</p>
<p>He knows his own people intimately.<br>

			<p>How much proof does one need that it is an official policy of our government to elminate regional pockets of remaining white culture?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the same thing locally here in NJ. Areas that were 99% white suddenly have &#8216;low income&rsquo; housing forced on them by the state.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t get it. How is it better for these people to bring them thousands of miles away from their homes and into a culture and climate that is completely alien to them? Why is it not better to leave them somewhere close to their homes and in a similar culture? Sounds like life in Tanzania must have been at least as good as where they were from. Crusaders and Do-Gooders usually wind up doing more damage than good.</p>

In my mind they&rsquo;ve got made- - living in a 90%+ White state. Then they vote Obama, then they IMPORT not only blacks, but black Africans. I see crime infested hell holes and LOTS of &#8220;bi-racial&#8221; babies [thanks to the gulible White girls in Iowa that don&rsquo;t want to appear &#8220;racissss!&#8221;] in Iowas VERY near future! I never would&rsquo;ve thought that I would see &#8220;no go&#8221; areas in IOWA!!!</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ll be blunt:  these types of people aren&rsquo;t entitled to a future.  They were born to people who couldn&rsquo;t control their reproductive tendencies.   A responsible person would not give birth to a child doomed to live in poverty in an unstable society.  They are surplus people who should be left to survive, or not, on their own.  Bringing them here only does a tremendous disservice to those of us who are legitimate members of our society.  </p>

			<p>Bring Brundians to the USA is extremely cruel for 2 reasons:  First is that every African-American will tell you that America is completely racists and that they have suffered from racism their entire lives.  Why would we ever take Africans from Africa (where there is no racism, because everyone is Black) and bring them to America, where they and their children will suffer racism every day for the rest of their lives?  This White racism will cause these Brundians to drop out of school, get pregnant, not marry, take drugs, etc.  The racist police will arrest them and the racist judges will throw them in prison.  It is immoral to make people suffer like this.</p>
<p>Secondly, it costs nearly $200,000 to integrate such a refugee into American society. This sum includes everything from immunizations, transport, resettlement counseling, English lessons, cultural training, food stamps, medical care, local transportation, section-8 housing, K-12 education, and police and prison costs.  The taxpayers pay for this.  However, that $200,000 (spent on a single person) would have fed an entire African village for 5 years.  So, Bleeding-heart liberals would rather provide $200,000 for a single person, than provide for an entire village.  This is immoral.  This is evil. I hope those UN-workers and Refugee-services workers rot in Hell for their cruelty.</p>

			<p>Just today I heard three different public service announcements on the radio about how I need to conserve our dwindling natural resources.  Like taking 30 second showers, turning off the water while I brush my teeth, turning the furnace down to 60 degrees  using only one square of toilet paper when I wipe, etc, etc..</p>
<p>Then we import more people who obviously don&rsquo;t belong to compete over these dwindling natural resources?  That would spell trouble to any sane(PC free) government!</p>

<p>The comment, above, is correct.  Democracy is a brilliant system that works, because it allows the will of the people to be followed.  When that process is thwarted (when the Constitution and the will of the people are ignored), it is the duty of every citizen to right that illegal wrong, and bring those responsible for deterring democracy to a swift and harsh justice.  Americans cannot allow democracy to be replaced by a dictatorship of elites.   </p>

			<p>Of course they and their many many children will receive racial preferences over you and your children. They will quickly adopt the black racist hate whitey ideology and sense of entitlement, and demand reparations for slavery. They will exhibit the same pathologies of wildly disproportionate eternal social dependency and crime of their black counterparts already here.</p>
<p>Over one million whites are victims of violence at the hands of blacks each year, twelve times the revese. There are fewer and fewer places to excape the plague of black street violence (terrorism). Apparently our government doesn&rsquo;t think that is enough.</p>
<p>Why is it the responsibility of the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Australia, and specifically the small white communities being dumped on, to take on the burden of refugees from black Africa&rsquo;s OWN endless INTERNAL strife ?<br>
There are DOZENS of sub-Sahara AFRICAN countries, rich in resources, and vast in territory where they could be resettled! And Western countries could help assist their resettlement IN AFRICA. And FAR MORE of these refugees could be helped for the same amount of money by resettling them in nearby black AFRICAN countries rather than trying to settle them halfway around the world into alien cultures where living costs are ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE more expensive.<br>
So the purpose of all this resettlement cannot be to really help the African refugees since dumping them halfway around the world is the LEAST efficient use of money and resources. No, the purpose is something else: TO USE THESE VIOLENT INCOMPATIBLE HOSTILE BLACK AFRICANS AS INSTRUMENTS TO UTTERLY DESTROY EVERY LAST REMAINING COHESIVE WHITE COMMUNITY.<br>

<p>On virtually all of the most essential points, they are already decided, and there is isn&rsquo;t a dime&rsquo;s worth of difference between them at all. There isn&rsquo;t even any discussion there, because that would be  &#8220;too controversial&#8221;.

<p>The President has stated that his eventual goal is a program that resettles 90,000 refugees in the United States each year, more than twice the total number of refugees resettled by all other developed countries combined in any year since the federal program began in 1980.</p>

<p>And just exactly who is the US government? WE are the US government! YOU are the US government. I am the US government. I can&rsquo;t speak for everyone, but I am sure that many of us would never establish an African refugee program in America&rsquo;s heartland if given the opportunity. </p>

			<p>I agree with WR the elder.  The United States Government hates whites and does all it can to discourage us.  As an education major in college, I applied for a federal program as an exchange student-teacher to teach in Europe.  Because I am white and was born in the US, my rejection letter implied that I am not representative enough of my nation&rsquo;s diversity.</p>
<p>So just wait.  The less that these dirty african immigrants do, the more the government will reward them.  They will get benefits and scholarships that the rest of us paid for, but for which we can never qualify.    </p>

			<p>Never undestimate the role of Christian charities, especially Lutherans and Catholics, in all this.  Creating a &#8220;need&#8221; for refugees gives these organizations a sense of importance.  This way, they can &#8220;rescue&#8221; people and at the same time enlighten the rest of the country that whites are merely one race in a glorious rainbow of many.  Ah, the power of self-flattery!   </p>
<p>I appeal to amren readers:  Ask your clergyman if a church is sponsoring refugee programs, directly or indirectly.  If he says &#8220;yes&#8221; or refuses to give you a straight answer, find another church.  These people are 10 times worse than the government.     </p>

			<p>Now wait a second. The good people of Iowa for fifty years have been in the forefront of efforts to integrate the South and America&rsquo;s larger cities, to bring the benefits of Black neighbors to other White Americans. It is only fair that the Iowans should finally have their turn to share in the joys and benefits of involuntary diversity. Serves &#8216;em right. Enjoy!!</p>

			<p>What would be the best way to stop the influx of African refugees in to the U.S.?  My suggestion would be a nationwide billboard campaign.  Before Americans can get angry enough to do something about the refugees, first they have to be sufficiently informed and billboards would be hard to miss.  I would willingly contribute to a billboard campaign, as I imagine most of you would, if someone with the knowhow would get such a project organized.   </p>

			<p>Read the articles.  The white girl pictured in the articles and others is &#8220;Jill Stuecker&#8221; a full time social worker for the Lutherans who are getting grants to import these aliens.  One article explained how Jill (in March) was desperately trying to get these aliens adjusted to Des Moines, and how she only had a few dollars left to spend on them.</p>
<p>The Lutherans, Catholics and Jews love to import these people for Federal grant money and then dump them on local taxpayers when the bucks run out.</p>
<p>They do NOT want to sponsor them or in any other way take actual financial responsibility for them,even though they know they will be a blight on every community they join.</p>
<p>Jill and her Lutheran friends refuse to tell people about the polygamy, the genital mutilation, and the grotesque fertility of these people, who have 6.4 children per woman, roughly 4 times as many as Iowans.  One out of every 5 or 10 has AIDS.</p>
<p>Burundians are as dumb as a box of rocks, having an AVERAGE IQ of 70 (59 by another measure), which means they are not full human beings according to the US Supreme Court. In other words, by law the average Burundian cannot be executed for murder since they are mentally deficient and cannot be expected to control your self like a normal human being.</p>
<p>The costs to even begin to educate these peasants will kill the Des Moines school system.  They will almost all wind up in Special Ed.  Their failure to learn as much as white kids will trigger No Child Left Behind, which mandates a free teacher/tutor for each one to follow them around from class to class, sit right by their side and attempt to teach them.</p>
<p>Remember, Rev. Wright told us and the NAACP just last week that black students learn differently, jump around like monkeys out of control and need special classes, teachers and schools.</p>
<p>The info below is from an Iowa website telling us what Jill and the Lutherans are doing next: </p>
<p>&#8220;Volunteers needed for incoming refugees<br>
Iowa is anticipating approximately 100 Burmese and 120 Iraqi refugees by the end of this year.<br>
 <br>
Volunteers needed: meeting them at the airport, moving into their new homes, finding jobs, learning American culture, etc.<br>

			<p>I forgot some of the other Burundi bits.</p>
<p>The men are lazy and force the women to do pretty much all of the work. They like to beat their women.  They keep their women stupid and uneducated, and are, in short, some of the nastiest sexists you would ever want to see.</p>
<p>It is the women who strap their own daughters down and saw and chop on their genitals, a habit that they are doubtless going to do in the USA.  </p>
<p>The Jill Stueckers in Des Moines will look the other way just like the Minneapolis social workers an Lutherans do when the Somali immigrant women hack on their daughters&rsquo; genitals.</p>
<p>Lik Minnesota Lutherans and social workers they will use the butchery as an opportunity to get more tax money to hire more social workers for Burundian &#8220;education&#8221;.</p>
<p>God help us all.</p>

			<p>Most of us here know why this is happening and has happened for the last 5 decades. It is plain and simple. White genocide. How much longer will we just sit at our keyboards and do nothing? When are we going to name the enemy and expose the enemy? Nothing will be solved until we do. You can&rsquo;t fight a war against an unseen enemy. This is war, but the White people don&rsquo;t even know that they are in a war. How stupid can they be?</p>

This is precisely the reason that I use as much electricity and water as I can.  I leave lights on, take long showers, run the AC, and so forth.

			<p>This amounts to nothing more than insanity. I&rsquo;m certain the local community wasn&rsquo;t consulted before resettlement plans were made and implemented. Imagine never having to worry about crime or property values then seeing crime go up and property values plumment overnight! It must be maddening. I know I&rsquo;d be MAD AS HELL. If I lived in those (all-White) communities, I&rsquo;d find out WHO was up to the resettlement insanity (with predictable resutls) and WHY.

<p>The fact is, gratitude    &mdash;   like &#8220;future thinking&#8221;, self-control, deferred gratification, and other racial/cultural traits   &mdash;   is a &#8220;white thing&#8221;.   It is simply not an African trait.</p>

<p>Expecting gratitude from blacks is an exercise in futility,  doomed to disappointment. Instead receiving of gratitude, what these deluded altruists will get will  be indignation, resentment, envy, and increased demands.</p>

These people have changed the face of many small American communities all out of some misguided guilt and Christian duty. Being a Christian does not mean losing common sense.

<p>That foolish notion of &#8220;so much room&#8221; is  entirely illusory. People who say that have not thought it out.  The fact is that the USA is presently  the breadbasket of the world.  When you cross those seemingly wide-open spaces in Kansas or Iowa, and see nothing around you but miles of wheat and cornfields and soybeans, it seems that there is plenty of room to fit in more people. There may be few towns or cities in sight, but that land is is use.  It is busy growing food to feed us, and a large part of the world.  Other areas, the high plains or deserts, may be ecologically fragile, or have thin or  poor soil, or suffer erosion, or lack water. There is a reason for their barenness. If they were fertile, they would be in use.</p>
<p>The bottom line is this: there is little more open space to be had. And every new mouth added to our population, puts new strans on our water supply, resources, sewage systems, landfills, highways, etc.   We already have too many.  With less, there would be more of everything to go around for everyone.</p>
