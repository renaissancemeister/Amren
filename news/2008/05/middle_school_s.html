<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>A staff member at Calverton Elementary/Middle was putting in extra hours at the West Baltimore school Sunday afternoon when two 13-year-old boys broke into the building and one tried to rape her, police confirmed yesterday.</p>
<p>Realizing that her attacker was unarmed, police said, the woman fought back, and both the boys &mdash; identified as students at the school &mdash; fled. When they returned for class Monday, they were arrested and charged as juveniles with attempted first-degree rape, attempted robbery, aggravated assault, burglary and trespassing, police said.</p>
<p>The attack highlighted continuing concerns about city students attacking staff members, and it raised new worries about the safety of the many city administrators and teachers who work in their buildings beyond school hours. While students have attacked staff members more than 100 times this academic year and one assault on a teacher was recently publicized on national news, this is the year&rsquo;s first case of an attempted sexual assault against a staff member, officials said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It kind of blew me away,&#8221; said the school police chief, Marshall &#8220;Toby&#8221; Goodwin. &#8220;The kids are just out of control. Any time a kid comes in and does something like this, it tells you about the family values at home. There are none.&#8221;</p>
<p>Goodwin said that any staff members who will be in an empty school building should notify both their principal and school police as a precaution. He said school police officers, who are on duty around the clock, are willing to escort them as they enter and exit the building.</p>
<p>Calverton, located at 1100 Whitmore Ave., is in a neighborhood known for gang conflicts where violence has been rampant in recent weeks. On April 15, Calverton was among the schools put on lockdown after a city police officer was shot outside nearby Alexander Hamilton Elementary/Middle. The next day, a student from Frederick Douglass High was shot in the face in the same area, and Calverton was placed on lockdown again.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While one of the boys rummaged through the building, the other attacked the staff member in an office, Goodwin said. But the woman was able to fight him off and sustained only minor physical injuries. She called police as soon as the boys had fled the building, around 3:30 p.m.</p>

					<p>Hummm now let me think&hellip;.was it black students or hispanics&hellip;.or both??? Hard to say..nawwwwwwww&hellip;.we don&rsquo;t need a picture of those &#8220;nice boys&#8221; to really know and they won&rsquo;t put that on the tv or news&hellip;..only if the perpitrators were white then it would be plastered all over the news, and in the papers&hellip;.those idiots and their parents should all go to prison&hellip;.then it might send some sort of message&hellip;.but then these people don&rsquo;t get it&hellip;.all whites are targets!!! </p>

					<p>Notice that white students in all of Maryland are not a majority.  This is not surprising considering how black Baltimore is, that they Maryland suburbs of <span class="caps">D.C. </span>are favored by blacks, and that Maryland is essentially a sanctuary state for illegals.</p>

					<p>Our children have to go to school with these creeps if they will attack a staff member or teacher then just think what they do other students who are trying to get ahead. This is the reason why test scores and attendance are so low because the students are scared of the other students who are gang members will attack them. We should have a policy of three strikes and you are out.</p>

					<p>The Baltimore Sun never identifies by race, but I know the area and I am sure the two punks are black.  Baltimore, once a thriving and beautiful city, is now a slum.</p>

<p>Baloney.  That young black criminals feel allowed to even seriously fantasize about doing such things, much less do them, tells you the degree to which white society is demoralized. White people could probably stop these problems tomorrow before noon, if they would only snap out of their trance.</p>
<p>White society is so bemused by the false notion of &#8220;racism&#8221; that it can&rsquo;t see, feel, or think. </p>
<p>Whites in the South eventually put a stop to the &#8220;impolite&#8221; black behavior that came with black &#8220;empowerment&#8221; during the Reconstruction period. There are solutions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Family values,&#8221; good grief  &mdash;  the problems with blacks have moved a bit beyond that stage. I know a busy white family that don&rsquo;t even have a dining room table, because they never sit down and eat together, which is terrible. But the children in that family are not trying to rape their teacher.</p>

					<p>I`m in a happy committed relationship.(Standard Spouse At Shoulder Disclaimer)But the one that got away from twenty years ago, (think Happy Days Al Delveccio, &#8220;Did I ever tell you about Rosa Colleti?&#8221;) is now a school psychologist working with black middle school kids after school. I asked her, &#8220;Are they just a hard luck race in need of a hand up, or are they  going to be perpetually in the  care of kind hearted  caring people like you?&#8221; She answered with an honest urgency &#8220;It`s the second!&#8221; that made all the old feelings come back. Theres no point to this story except that I worry about her and I`ll be quizzing her next time I see her  on what she perceives the dangers to be and if there`s anything I can do to give advice etc&hellip; She derives her satisfaction from helping, but doesn`t have any illusions about either the effects of that help or the risks involved.  </p>

<p>And to think teachers only had to put up with gum chewing in the 50&rsquo;s!</p>
<p>Look, no matter what anyone says, these guys are going to get off with a slap on the wrist. They are &#8220;youts&#8221; and thus are shielded from adult charges. </p>
<p>The families of the kids are pissed that they didn&rsquo;t attack whites, so they can charge &#8220;racism&#8221;.</p>

					<p>Having a large faction of people amounting to millions who are backward and unintelligent is a handicap for a nation for certain, but when these same people also, as a group, have a propensity to commit crime and violence far in excess of every other racial group on earth, then they constitute a problem that will eventually be insurmountable.</p>
<p>Add to such troublesome factions, the inclusion of large numbers of third world illiterates, and the problem becomes so horrendous even prosperity can&rsquo;t compensate for the imbalance.  That&rsquo;s where the US is at right now.  </p>
<p>Diversity will cause America&rsquo;s destruction, but not entirely alone, because much will have to do with a substantial number of the white population, who have bought into leftist ideology, and who have lost their racial identity and their will to fight.</p>
<p>That our days are numbered is no longer in question by serious followers of current events, the only unknown factor is when the final implosion will occur.  </p>

					<p>  Go figure.  with all the extra money thrown at these &#8220;magnet schools&#8221;, it still isn&rsquo;t any better. The only thing that will wake up the people running the show, will be the coming depression. Then things will start to change.</p>

<p>No it doesn&rsquo;t, Toby.  Plenty of white 13-year-olds have lousy values at home, but they don&rsquo;t do these types of things - it tells you about the race of the &#8220;boys&#8221; who did it.</p>

					<p>&#8220;Magnet&#8221; schools is a code word for attracting Whites and Asians to inner-city hell-hole schools in the hopes of increasing test scores. These &#8220;magnet&#8221; schools usually have state-of-the-art technology, excellent amenities, and good teachers. So, in this case, blacks can&rsquo;t be crying about how bad inner-city public schools are. They just don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Noting the % of students that are either White or Asian shows that the only &#8220;students&#8221; they are attracting are 13-year-old black thugs and that&rsquo;s probably because many of the teachers are probably brainwashed White females trying to &#8220;make a difference&#8221;.</p>
<p>They may as well as built this &#8220;magnet&#8221; school in the middle of Zimbabwe.</p>

					<p>I notice this middle school has a police chief!  While I don&rsquo;t blame the victim for being attacked, I do think she was insane for being alone in that school no matter what day of the week it was.  Personally, if the students act like they&rsquo;re already in reform school, why not just make it into one?</p>

<p>Isnt multiculturalism wonderful? We value the &#8220;benefits&#8221; and &#8220;joys&#8221; of diversity so much that we turn a blind eye when these joys start attacking. What is a hundred or so attacks on school staff by students at <span class="caps">ONE </span>middle school in one school year, or the &#8220;attempted first-degree rape, attempted robbery, aggravated assault, burglary and trespassing&#8221; against one female staffer when we are all so enriched by all this diversity? We are even willing to provide staffers with police escorts to save them from attack from 12,13 and 14 year olds&hellip;.Can anyone tell me just what it would take to shock a liberal into reality? These leftists want to force feed us their idea of a multicultural utopia even if it kills us. And it just might. <br>

<p>Yikes, I taught for 33 years (until 2005) in a hugely-White suburb 35 miles SW of Chicago and not <span class="caps">ONCE </span>was I or a colleague attacked.  I broke up a few fights to be sure but never once did a young person raise a fist, leg, or elbow, at me much less a weapon.  </p>
<p>Come to think of it, nobody ever even called me an <span class="caps">MF, </span>either.  I&rsquo;d like to have a dollar for every time that curse phrase is raised in the Baltimore magnet school.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;this is the year&rsquo;s first case of an attempted sexual assault against a staff member, officials said.&#8221;</p>

					<p>My husband works in corrections.  The prison he works at houses juveniles that have been tried as adults.  They are segregated from general population, and handed all kinds of special treatments, because they are just kids, after all.  He will do anything possible not to work around these juveniles.  He said they are the most vile of the population.  The best solution would be no segregation for the juveniles.  Let them exist in general population, and receive prison justice.  Today&rsquo;s kids, criminal or not, live in an unrealistic world.  Any dose of reality they can get has to be an improvement.</p>

					<p>In the early &#8216;80&rsquo;s, Raytown MO high school still only had a tiny black student population, but that&rsquo;s all it took: A white teacher alone in a classroom was attacked by a black male student who entered: He raped her and tried to strangle her. The Kansas City area black community as expected rallied in support of the young black student rapist and attempted killer of the married white teacher, staging marches. Her life was destroyed and she quit her job.</p>
