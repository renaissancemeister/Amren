						<p>I&rsquo;ve been mugged three times in London. Now, looking at it objectively, spread over 20 years of living in one of the world&rsquo;s most crowded cities, that&rsquo;s not a bad tally. The trouble is this: every time, the perpetrators were young, male and black. On the third and most serious occasion, I was clubbed on the head with a metal bar, dragged into an alley, and held with a knife to my neck by one guy while his accomplice raided £500 from my bank account.</p>
<p>What do I &#8220;do&#8221; with that? The progressive thing to do is, if not write it off as a statistical blip, at least place it in the context of wider sociological factors. But one&rsquo;s intellectual and visceral responses are two different things, and as a committed anti-racist I was shocked to find myself flinching every time a young black male (particularly if dressed in a particular fashion) passed me in the street. Maybe I shouldn&rsquo;t have thrown that victim counselling leaflet in the bin.</p>
<p>This is precisely why Love Music Hate Racism needs to exist. Will Self, answering a question about Martin Amis at a recent talk, opined that &#8220;everyone is a little bit racist&#8221;, and if even someone as scrupulously egalitarian as myself can experience such feelings, then it doesn&rsquo;t take a genius to work out how the combined effects of anecdotal incidents like mine, tabloid hysteria about gang warfare, and irresponsible politicians using words like &#8220;swamped&#8221; might drive large sections of the white working class into the all too eager arms of the BNP.</p>
<p>Not that an indie rock-dominated all-dayer, given that genre&rsquo;s bourgeois-skewed demographic, addresses the white working class as directly as it might, but it&rsquo;s a start. The timing is significant: not merely is it the 13th anniversary of the Rock Against Racism concert, but it was also a week in which hundreds of thousands of Londoners voted for a mayoral candidate who apparently feels it&rsquo;s appropriate to describe Africans as &#8220;piccaninnies&#8221; with &#8220;watermelon smiles&#8221;.</p>
<p>On a grey and intermittently drizzly day which starts with an Anti-Nazi League rally, Victoria Park hosts an afternoon which suffers from poor organisation (there&rsquo;s no schedule of bands in the programme) and heavy-handed security, with a constant edge of violence (sporadic fights). However, it still manages to provide some spine-tingling moments.</p>
<p>One of them isn&rsquo;t musical at all: the great Tony Benn, now so old that his granddaughter is standing for Parliament, tells a crowd a quarter of his age that they have &#8220;the technology and know-how to solve the problems of the human race&#8221;; that &#8220;race-hate is one of the greatest offences that can be committed&#8221;; and that &#8220;the BNP turns us against ourselves&#8221;, ending with the words &#8220;Thank you for coming. You&rsquo;re a very important generation.&nsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&#8221;.</p>
<p>The original Rock Against Racism generation is represented by a handful of survivors (Tom Robinson and Don Letts among them). Jimmy Pursey of Sham 69, who sang &#8220;White Riot&#8221; with the Clash in 1978 (a brave statement at a time when his own band had a significant skinhead following), saunters on as a guest of Babyshambles&rsquo; Drew McConnell, and does it again. Poly Styrene of X-Ray Spex, who opened the original RAR carnival, may look like a kindly old hippie nowadays, but she makes the hairs on your arms stand up with a paint-blistering &#8220;Oh Bondage, Up Yours!&#8221;.</p>
<p>The day&rsquo;s desired cultural crossover is, in practice, largely a one-way tide. There aren&rsquo;t many black faces watching The View, Get Cape. Wear Cape. Fly or The Paddingtons (and frankly, who can blame them), although there are plenty of white kids digging Wiley, Heartless Crew and Roll Deep (who have penned their own LMHR anthem in &#8220;Racist People&#8221;), and indeed Asian pop as represented by Jay Sean and Nihal.</p>
<p>Patrick Wolf covers X-Ray Spex&rsquo;s &#8220;Identity&#8221;, and reclaims the Union Jack from the racists by wearing a suit entirely made from them. (Union Jacks, that is, not racists.) The 36-year-old voice of Asbo youth Richard Archer (how did he get away with that perception for so long?) and his band Hard-Fi lift damp spirits with &#8220;Hard to Beat&#8221;. It&rsquo;s the headliners, though, who encapsulate the day&rsquo;s message.</p>
<p>Damon Albarn&rsquo;s The Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen are already filled with echoes of the late Seventies, both in a Derrida-esque &#8220;hauntological&#8221; sense and, in the presence of Paul Simonon, a literal one. The bassist, who headlined this park first time around as a member of the Clash, acknowledges: &#8220;It&rsquo;s good to be back.&#8221; The highlight comes when a visibly gleeful Damon is joined on stage by the gap-toothed grin of Jerry Dammers who, as the mastermind behind the Two Tone label and, with his band The Specials, an instigator of the ska revival, gave my generation its first lessons in anti-racist politics.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ghost Town&#8221; was a deeply pessimistic song when it soundtracked the riot-ruptured summer of 1981, but a quarter of a century later, still backed by the trombone of Jamaican veteran Rico Rodriguez, it feels like a strangely perfect finale, striking the correct note of combined celebration and apprehension.<br>

&#8220;I&rsquo;ve been mugged three times in London. Now, looking at it objectively, spread over 20 years of living in one of the world&rsquo;s most crowded cities, that&rsquo;s not a bad tally.&#8221;</p>
<p>In any 20-year period in London&rsquo;s 1000-year history, being mugged three times would count as an EXTREMELY bad tally. Any 20-year period, that is, EXCEPT the past 20 years of multicult mania. In any 20-year period back when London was WHITE, being the victim of violent street crime THREE TIMES was not &#8220;a statistical blip,&#8221; as this wimp terms it, but a statistical IMPOSSIBILITY.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;The trouble is this: every time, the perpetrators were young, male and black.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yup, that&rsquo;s the trouble, all right. That&rsquo;s your trouble right there, pal. Good of you to acknowledge it. The eagerness to take a metal bar to the skull of any &#8220;redlegs&#8221; who looks like he might be carrying a few quid in his wallet, is a problem that neither this lily-livered, yellow-bellied scribbler   &mdash;   nor sanctimonious old rockers like Paul Simonon and Poly Styrene, nor pompous younger rockers like Damon Albarn, nor senile Stalinist stooges like Tony Benn   &mdash;   has ANY IDEA how to solve.  <br>

<p>Writing it off as  a statistical blip or placing it in the context of wider sociological factors is fine for those who live in areas where they have little contact with the &#8220;Blacks&#8221;.  For those of us who live in close proximity to them, though, it could get us killed, especially if we are slow learners or fail to regard them warily as the &#8220;progressive&#8221; race mixers urge us to do.</p>

When he&rsquo;s lying there with a stab wound to his neck or body and his life&rsquo;s blood is draining out on the dirty ground, as he grows colder and his vision dims, will he feel the same way? It&rsquo;s hard to have an &#8220;intellectual&#8221; or &#8220;visceral&#8221; response when you are dead.</p>

			<p>What a pathetic suicide junkie.</p>
<p>After being mugged three times and his life nearly taken from him by blacks, Simon Price still refuses to come to the prudent realization that black people are inheritely more dangerous - <i>much</i> more dangerous - than white people.</p>
<p>If Simon Price suffers similar life-threatening incidents at the hands of malignant blacks in the future, I would have no sympathy for him. He should have already learned by now.</p>

			<p>This bothers the hell out of me. These liberals who think they can change the mind of other peoples&hellip; It&rsquo;s like inviting a pit bull to come play with your infant child. This is where otherwise intelligent human beings become stupid and immature, and I think that the word &#8216;immature&rsquo; is a perfect way to describe this so-called modern thought. Even the blacks know better!</p>

			<p>The PC weapons of &#8220;tolerance&#8221;, &#8220;anti-racism&#8221;, &amp; &#8220;diversity is our strength&#8221; are nothing more than ways for the global puppet masters to passify the dumb masses whilst they (the elite) tear down the Western world (by flooding the West with hoards of nonwhite 3rd world peoples).  Useful idiots like the guy featured in this article, surely must be viewed with a smile by the global puppet masters.</p>
<p>I would not be surprised if &#8220;Rock Against Racism&#8221; was the brainchild of the Ford Foundation or the Rockefeller Foundation.<br>

			<p>Mugged 3 times by blacks on the streets of London and still waffling about immigration? Oh wait you write for the Independent..whose ideological leftism is as doctrinaire and mindless as it comes. Well maybe the next time a &#8220;young black male&#8221; holds a knife to your throat while your ATM account is <br>
emptied will actually go through with and cut your throat&hellip;then, maybe then, for the 5 seconds of life left in you,  you will feel something more than &#8220;aprehension&#8221; at your politically incorrect thoughts&hellip;but probably not.</p>

			<p>Writing like this detracts from the message, because the writer is writing for himself by trying to sound clever rather than concentrating on being informative, which indicates he&rsquo;s hung up on himself quite badly. And, that&rsquo;s probably why he has held his morally superior views in spite of the reality of the racial situation likely staring him in the face almost everyday.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been dropped on his head once too often.</p>

			<p>I know just too many whites who have been assaulted, even a daughter raped, but none and not the daughter either, have learned the lesson of traveling less dangerous roads.  No, they seem to wear it like a badge.  I suppose they can be accepted and cool this way - as long as their encounters leave them alive.</p>

			<p>This is what multicult has lead to: the systematic deconditioning of millions of years of wired survival instincts because they are &#8220;racist&#8221;.</p>
<p>I have an inkling that despite being a fanatical anti-racist he lives in the whitest suburb he can afford, attends a majority white workplace and school, and associates with almost exclusively whites except for his token minority friends as an affirmation of his anti-racism.</p>

<p>&#8220;irresponsible politicians using words like swamped might drive large sections of the white working class into the all too eager arms of the BNP&#8221;.</p>
<p>So &#8220;most crowded cities&#8221; is fine but to use the word &#8220;swamped&#8221; is not? What does this loony lefty liberal writer think made London such a &#8220;crowded city&#8221; in the first place?</p>
<p>&#8220;I was clubbed on the head with a metal bar, dragged into an alley, and held with a knife to my neck by one guy while his accomplice raided £500 from my bank account&#8221;.</p>
<p>Being clubbed on the head with a metal bar is not simply a mugging, it is attempted murder.</p>
<p>London is now a place where you have to keep your wits about you. I live in London[although I am working on getting out as soon as possible], it was not like this ten or fifteen years ago, it was much safer but now with so many English and British people having fled the Capital City of London as white flight and with the Police a politically correct organisation, London is now a city of lawless foreigners, who know only too well that the Police cannot do anything to them because of political correctness.</p>
<p>If you are an American and you are thinking of visiting London, I advise you not to come here. If you do come here be very, very careful and understand that if you come to London, there are very, very, few indigenous people left in this once great city.</p>

Like the white females who after being raped by black males would read &#8220;Soul On Ice&#8221; (a guide for black males to rape white females as a political act) to &#8220;understand what happened to them&#8221;. <br>

I spent most of my time in the Central and West parts of London.  Nearest tube stops are Bethal Green and Hackney.  A to Z pages 48 to 49.</p>

			<p>Strange that Jimmy Pursey of Sham69 got a mention.<br>
Growing up in the fraught, tense England of the late 1970s, Sham69 were *the* Skinhead group and had a mass following of self-identified National Front Skinhead supporters.<br>
I believe this caused the left-wing Jimmy Pursey much embarrassment.<br>
I don&rsquo;t think Sham69 ever had a following in America - quite frankly they weren&rsquo;t very good.</p>

			<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget the posterboy for &#8216;Rock Against Racism&rsquo; is junkie-crackhead Pete Docherty, who seems to have thought the drug habit is all you need to be a pop star.  Keith Richard never missed a gig in 30 years of addictions.  David Bowie produced an impressive canon of music and entertainment in his own 70&rsquo;s chaos.  Doherty is nothing.</p>
<p>Oh, and as someone who saw the first of these events 30 years ago, I should let you know that the Clash&rsquo;s fans were throwing darts at reggae group &#8216;Steel Pulse&rsquo;. So much for solidarity.</p>

			<p><i>Will Self, answering a question about Martin Amis at a recent talk, opined that &ldquo;everyone is a little bit racist&rdquo;<i></i></i></p>
<p>As I see it, here&rsquo;s the problem with that statement; he&rsquo;s misusing the language, he&rsquo;s redefining the word &#8216;racist&rsquo;.  It&rsquo;s not racist to notice that your muggers on all three occasions are black. If they&rsquo;d been white would that have been racist too? We know the answer, but this is what the Orwellian Leftists do, they redefine the language to control the debate; &#8216;immigrant&rsquo; applies to anyone who enters a nation illegally, &#8216;refugee&rsquo; applies to anyone who wants to live in the West, &#8216;poverty&rsquo; means anyone living below an ideologically defined standard,&rsquo; Islam&rsquo; means peace, and in this case &#8216;racist&rsquo; means anyone who is not an active promoter of Multicult.</p>
<p>Note too this arrogant man&rsquo;s condescending tone with regard to the working people:</p>
<p>  <i>it doesn&rsquo;t take a genius to work out how the combined effects of anecdotal incidents like mine, tabloid hysteria about gang warfare, and irresponsible politicians using words like &ldquo;swamped&rdquo; might drive large sections of the white working class into the all too eager arms of the BNP<i></i></i></p>
<p>This translates to &ldquo;even an idiot can see that large sections of working class people don&rsquo;t think about issues, and they can be driven by emotional &amp; hysterical language to vote for racists&rsquo;.<br>
Arc.<br>

			<p>So being non racist now means to cheerfully serve as a walking, cash dispensing ATM for the underprivileged minorities when a steel ATM knife is inserted into your throat and a pin number is entered into your skull with a steel bar.  </p>
<p>Hey if it happens only once every six years what&rsquo;s the big deal???<br>

			<p>&#8220;I have an inkling that despite being a fanatical anti-racist he lives in the whitest suburb he can afford, attends a majority white workplace and school, and associates with almost exclusively whites except for his token minority friends as an affirmation of his anti-racism.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
That&rsquo;s why they are &#8216;anti-racist&rsquo;.</p>
<p>There was a huge effort at keeping working class whites &#8216;anti-racist&rsquo;, too. The very definition of Punk music and it&rsquo;s derivatives is it&rsquo;s left-wing politics.</p>
<p>Also, when evaluating this piece, it&rsquo;s useful to know he&rsquo;s being paid to write this even as he so bravely &#8216;fights the system&rsquo;. </p>

			<p>I lived in Paris for twenty years and was robbed many times, three times quite seriously. Each and every time though my attackers had two things in common: 1.) they were of african of north african extraction; 2.) they were very young. (Needless to say they were male - one doesn&rsquo;t see the african women in europe as prominently as their menfolk, who like to keep the ladies under wraps and in hiding). </p>
<p>To this day I bear the stigma of an unfortunate encounter with a young and feral african in the rue Dauphine: too young and naive at the time to properly fear this beast, I got too close and he head-butted me, a move I didn&rsquo;t even know existed. So 20 years on I still have the crooked shnozz,  à la Owen Wilson. </p>

			<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; that &ldquo;race-hate is one of the greatest offences that can be committed&rdquo;</p>
<p>IT IS? Geez, here I always thought it to be a natural reaction when you finally wake up and realize the INFERIOR RACES commit the majority of crimes in our respective nation!</p>
<p>Guess I must be a closet racist. Because I sure as hell am not bashful about stating the self-evident truth. That NON-WHITE RACES are the biggest problem White people ever saddled themselves with.</p>
<p>Might one be so bold as to inquire just HOW MUCH negative evidence must we have thrust in our faces, before being able to admit that politically unacceptable little truth?</p>
<p>P.S.  I have to concur with the comment &#8220;he must have been dropped on his head once too often.&#8221; I worked with a jackass like that. He was bashed one night by a Black with a tire iron. And STILL gushed on and on about how &#8220;racist&#8221; we are for looking at Blacks and seeing nothing but criminals and potential criminals. My personal belief was his brains got permanently scrambled by the Black thug that night. Or he&rsquo;d have more sense than wasting sympathy on that benighted race.</p>

			<p>This dumb white liberal deserves everything he gets. And more. The problem is instead of warning other whites to stay clear of these racist white-haters this dumb cluck probably dresses like a wigger &amp; mouths the marxist equivalent of &#8216;cool man&rsquo; as the vicious little black racists beat seven shades of sh  &mdash;   outta him. It is reminiscent of an old Monty Python tv sketch. &#8216;Did they beat you up?&rsquo; &#8216;Oh no, no, I tripped&rsquo;. &#8216;We have film of them nailing you to the floor&rsquo;. &#8216;Oh yea, well they had to do it, didn&rsquo;t they, sorta r-e-s-p-e-c-t thing, you know&rsquo;. Simon Price. &amp; he doesn&rsquo;t even try to hide his name. Shame on him for shaming the white race. Liberals like this spineless jellyfish have brought us to our present low state. &amp; this is what runs our countries. I won&rsquo;t say God help us. We will help ourselves.</p>

			<p>Another complete White moron. They would rather die at the hands of a nonwhite than to admit any truths about race. Like a poster said, &#8220;has the White race gone insane&#8221;?  My answer is yes and a thousand times YES! The herd needs to be culled. They are losers and should be the rejects on that purveyer belt.</p>

			<p>&#8220;After a fashion it looks like Victoria Park is in the Hackney area of London.&#8221;</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, Victoria Park forms the boundary between Tower Hamlets (now majority Bangladeshi) and Hackney; Hackney Marshes and the River Lea are just to its east, the old boundary between Middlesex and Essex. South Hackney still has a large English population, but North Hackney is extremely black, with a narrow area of gentrified whites just north of the park. I suspect that the author of the article is one of those gentrified whites: the white locals know their area better.</p>
<p>I was born in South Hackney and attended an excellent selective high school (a grammar school in British terminology) between Victoria Park and Bethnal Green tube. Even until the 1980s, there were many excellent schools in the area. Now I&rsquo;m a mathematician in Cambridge who, every time I return to my original home, sees that home a little more has been transformed. Of course, to discuss this honestly in my university would cause anathema.</p>

Absolutely correct.  Whatever his personal problems, Keith Richards, a white musician, has never missed a single gig.  </p>

			<p>I try not make more than one comment on an article, but after reading this one again I am still struck by how sick this man has become. On YouTube there is a series of videos featuring a ex-Soviet KGB agent. In the videos he describes the taking over of a country through, what he called, &#8220;demoralization&#8221;. Anyway, the videos are fascinating and are a must-see. He said something during one that has really rang true. He stated that in the target country you convince people to believe in an ideology that is bad for them and some people will become so sold on the ideology that they will refuse to disbelieve in it, even in the face of overwhelming evidence against it. The man who wrote this article fits that perfectly.</p>

			<p>This is the modern version of &#8216;duck and cover&rsquo; to survive a nuclear strike.<br>
The victim of 3 violent attacks needs a concert to help stop him being a racist. &#8216;Sorry I hurt your fist with my face, who shall I make the cheque out to&rsquo;?</p>
<p>This reminds me of that film &#8216;the matrix&rsquo;, when Neo works out reality is not reality but just a huge program which isn&rsquo;t real, and looking at all the sheep going about their day.</p>
<p>PS the last 3 times someone thew a punch at me they were all African (descent @ least) males,mind you I&rsquo;m in Australia where they are like 0.01% of the population (but our governments working on that too).<br>

			<p>&#8220;I know just too many whites who have been assaulted, even a daughter raped,..they seem to wear it like a badge&hellip;&#8221; (Posted by Whiteplight at 9:27 PM on May 5)</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m beginning to understand: They feel PROUD that the assaults they&rsquo;ve suffered have not turned them into &#8220;RACISTS.&#8221;</p>

			<p>If this idiotic fellow refuses to learn the obvious lessons of repeated muggings by Blacks then surely it would be better for him to be killed in the next attack and thereby prevented from spreading his addiction to victimhood and self-destruction to other Whites.</p>
<p>One mugging is bad enough, let alone being attacked with a metal bar. It just goes to show the liberal mental illness that can rationalise away any discomforting fact.</p>
<p>If these people get their way in 10 or 20 years it&rsquo;ll be &#8220;I&rsquo;ve been hijacked at gunpoint three times  but living in one of the world&rsquo;s most crowded cities, that&rsquo;s not a bad tally.&#8221; Later it will be &#8220;I&rsquo;ve had three friends shot dead in armed robberies, but living in one of the world&rsquo;s most crowded cities, that&rsquo;s not a bad tally.&#8221; Eventually &#8220;My wife has been raped and my son murdered, and my house has been redistributed to the formerly-colonised disadvantaged community, but living in one of the world&rsquo;s most diverse and crowded cities, that&rsquo;s not a bad tally.&#8221;<br>
It may seem ridiculous, but this has already happened in South Africa. In no more than 30 years South Africa has gone from one of the safest countries for whites to one of the most dangerous, yet there are still some white liberals there who rationalise it all away. </p>
<p>As for the &#8220;Love Music Hate Racism&#8221; carnival, this is laughable. On 1 May the Marxists behind the carnival stood for election in London as the Left List and were totally humiliated. Despite all their media publicity they got 0.92%. Meanwhile the BNP, despite all the carnivals against it and all the newspaper editorials telling people not to vote for the &#8220;Nazis&#8221; polled more than 5%.</p>
