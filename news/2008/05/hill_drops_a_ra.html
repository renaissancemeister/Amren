						<p>Hillary Rodham Clinton played the race card yesterday as she dismissed Barack Obama as a candidate who will have a hard time winning support from &#8220;white Americans.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the most starkly racial comment Clinton has made in the campaign, and drew quick condemnation from some Democrats.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s been on the defensive ever since Tuesday&rsquo;s big loss in North Carolina and narrow win in the Indiana primary &mdash; dismissing calls to drop out.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a much broader base to build a winning coalition on,&#8221; she told USA Today in an interview published yesterday.</p>
<p>She referred to an Associated Press story on Indiana and North Carolina exit polls &#8220;that found how Sen. Obama&rsquo;s support among working, hardworking Americans, white Americans, is weakening again, and how whites in both states who had not completed college were supporting me.&#8221;</p>
<p>She added, &#8220;There&rsquo;s a pattern emerging here.&#8221;</p>
<p>An analysis of racial breakdowns is always done behind the scenes by campaigns, but it&rsquo;s rarely discussed by a candidate openly.</p>
<p>The Obama campaign declined comment, referring to spokesman Bill Burton&rsquo;s statement to USA Today.</p>
<p>Burton, noting that Obama performed strongly among working-class voters in Indiana and did better with whites there than in Ohio, said the Illinois senator will appeal &#8220;to Americans from every background and all walks of life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;These statements from Sen. Clinton are not true and, frankly, disappointing,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Clinton&rsquo;s &#8220;white Americans&#8221; remark drew a swift rebuke from some superdelegates, and private dismay from several Democrats concerned about reuniting the factionalized party.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Also yesterday:</p>
<p>* The Rev. Al Sharpton told NY1 there&rsquo;s no scenario where Clinton can become the nominee without the &#8220;total destruction&#8221; of the party, adding, &#8220;It&rsquo;s over.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Come sing another day, but this show is over, Sen. Clinton.&#8221;</p>

The only reason she&rsquo;s getting all these white votes is that they fear Obama (and black street thug arrogance in the wake of Obama&rsquo;s success) more than they do her.

					<p>Hillary despises the White working class, like all leftists.  You cannot be on our side if you support affirmative action or non-White immigration.  She is simply desperate.  Her lust for power has overcome all her liberal scruples.  She&rsquo;d put on a white robe and a pointy hat if she thought it would get her elected.  </p>

					<p>Actually, what we&rsquo;re witnessing is the beginning of the end of liberal white control &amp; direction of the Democrat party.</p>
<p>Once a majority of Democrat voters are non-white, expect the dispossession of whites to accelerate with ever-more explicit anti-white laws and policies.</p>
<p>The Democrat party will be torn between Black &amp; Hispanic factions, each blatantly racialist (racist) and out for blood at the expense of whites and each other.</p>
<p>I suspect that white leftists will migrate out of the Democratic party, and go to the Greens or a similar party, once they understand that whites are no longer welcome.</p>
<p>Conservative Democrats (there are some, believe it or not) will leave as well, to the Republican party if the Republicans are able to purge the party of leftists like Bush (1 &amp; 2), McCain, and such.</p>
<p>If not, expect the Republican party to go the way of the Whigs or the Federalists, and to be supplanted like these parties were.</p>
<p>Stupid white liberals expected that they would be able to maintain control of the Democrat party, and the country, even with a rapidly-increasing minority population.</p>
<p>Ask Hillary Clinton what she thinks of that expectation now.</p>

Senator Clinton&rsquo;s statements are undeniably correct. They can&rsquo;t condemn her very much over this because she is repeating what the media commentators have been saying for weeks.</p>
<p>You may have noticed that it is okay to break down the electorate into racial groups. This is a tradition that goes back for decades. It has been going on so long that this is one area that is virtually immune from political correctness  &mdash;   pointing out that whites and blacks have different voting patterns.</p>

					<p>Here&rsquo;s the deal Hillary.  I&rsquo;m a lifelong Republican and I absolutely detest you but McCain is no better.  If you&rsquo;ll match your rhetoric with some actual campaign promises to help White America, I&rsquo;m sold.  You don&rsquo;t have to promise a great deal, simply cut back on immigration, enforce the border and end preferences.  I know that would put you at odds with some of your supporters but getting White votes would more than makeup for the loss of blacks and hispanics.  </p>
<p>&#8220;The Rev. Al Sharpton told <span class="caps">NY1 </span>there&rsquo;s no scenario where Clinton can become the nominee without the &ldquo;total destruction&rdquo; of the party, adding, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s over&hellip; . Come sing another day, but this show is over, Sen. Clinton.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Are you planning on crashing the <span class="caps">DNC </span>with a bomb strapped to your chest?  I don&rsquo;t think you marching through New York with your thugs and welfare mommas is going to destroy the party.    Stop making empty threats or your paymasters might just show you who the boss is.  The truth of the matter is blacks don&rsquo;t have anywhere else to go.  If Clinton gets nominated, they&rsquo;ll whine and whimper and maybe riot, but in the end they&rsquo;ll fall in line.  <br>

<p>Obama does best in states that are very black or hardly black.  It&rsquo;s the states with close to the national average of black citizens that <span class="caps">HRC </span>does best.  Whites in very white areas have little experience with diversity so they (if they lean left) gravitate toward Obama, while heavily black states like MS are ones where the whites are virtually all Republican in a reactionary sense.  States like MO and OH are ones that aren&rsquo;t so black to preclude the existence of white Democrats, but they&rsquo;re black enough to where enough whites have experience with diversity.  Hence <span class="caps">HRC </span>voters.</p>

					<p>&ldquo;Clinton&rsquo;s &lsquo;white Americans&rsquo; remark drew a swift rebuke from some superdelegates, and private dismay from several Democrats concerned about reuniting the factionalized party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The irony here is so deliciously succulent, that I savor it like a really good bratwurst and icy mug of beer at a Fourth of July cookout in an upturned manner, that a swishing and simpering Obama supporter must &ldquo;his&rdquo; glass of burgundy with brie and grapes, at a reading of the collective works of Marx by Rosie O&rsquo;Donnell, with Barbara Streisand providing turgidly pythonesque backup vocals. </p>
<p>The media and Democratic &ldquo;establishment,&rdquo; are doing their best to ignite a race war within their own party, not avoid one. Their obvious (near rapturously sexualized racial) preference for Comrade Obama and  &ldquo;tolerance&rdquo; of his shortcomings, is so bewildering to behold, that I doubt future generations will believe that &ldquo;professionals&rdquo; could behave so wantonly in public and still be taken seriously. They are not just orgasmic about him, they are multiply Obamasmic.</p>
<p>Once you go &ldquo;black&rdquo;&hellip;?</p>
<p>Indeed, they did that a long time ago, through the Mau Mau hole!</p>
<p>Watching the disgusting freak show on both <span class="caps">MSNBC </span>and <span class="caps">FOX</span> News Channel, as Hillary with 15 to 25% of the vote counted and 59% of the total in Indiana tabulated be declared &ldquo;too close to call,&rdquo; while Comrade Obama was announced the victor in North Carolina at 65% of the vote there with less than 1% of the vote counted was sincerely enlightening, to be sure. As the night progressed and he had only 56% in North Carolina in reality and she only 51% in Indiana, it became clear, all too clear. He had won a triumph along the lines of D-Day, and she a defeat of proportions to those of the Roman legions at the Totenberg Forest.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>But there is one catch.  I voted for Hillary in one of the big Midwestern primaries; I did so, with the unshakeable belief that worse is better than the worst!</p>
<p>God help us all, that we have come to this!</p>

<p>Anonymous, you just don&rsquo;t get it, do you?  You seem to believe there is some kind of relationship between what a candidate <span class="caps">SAYS </span>and what she does once elected.  In fact, there is no such relationship.  If there is a match here and there, it is purely chance.

<p>Be leery of any Clinton promises!  I remember that Bill came into office, with strong gay support, having given gays the promise to end discrimination in the military as his first act in the presidency. Once installed in the White House, he reneged and instead  (after much stalling and maneuvering) settled for  &#8220;Don&rsquo;t ask, don&rsquo;t tell&#8221; instead.   Gay groups sent bus loads of thousands to Washington to protest and appeal, but Bill &amp; Hill managed to be out of town on that weekend.  The protests went unheard, although gay contributions to his election campaign were not returned.</p>
<p>Moral of story:  A Clinton will do anything to get elected.  But a Clinton promise isn&rsquo;t worth a hill of beans.</p>

<p>In a last desperate gasp, Hillery discovers white folk. Can you say too little, too late?<br>

<p>Obama is winning the popular vote in the Democratic primaries because the Democratic Party is the party of non-whites. The Democrats have not won an election on the strength of white votes since Harry Truman in 1948.</p>

<p>Speaking of Indiana, did you notice that Gary did the usual black voter fraud trick of hold the count back until they found out how many votes they needed to fake to put Obama over the top?  For one reason or another, it didn&rsquo;t work, but this kind of thing goes on all the time in black areas.</p>
<p>This time, the difference was that a liberal Democrat (HRC) would have been the victim, and even the <span class="caps">MSM </span>picked up on it.</p>

					<p>What utter nonsense.  Would it be considered controversial if Obama&rsquo;s campaign said (maybe they have) that Hillary will never get the support of the majority of black Americans?  I doubt it.  I&rsquo;ve never been a supporter of the Clinton&rsquo;s, but at least on this Hillary speaks the truth, and she gets pummeled for it.  </p>

					<p>The Clintons led the charge to promote affirmative action and artifically elevate the Black race through their &#8220;Urban Empowerment initiatives&#8221; all through the 90s at the expense of White taxpayers. Yes, Bill and Hillary paved the way for people like Obama. She should be proud of his success at her expense. It&rsquo;s what she wanted. The chickens are coming home to roost.</p>
<p>Oh, and Pat Buchanan offers a glimpse of our future. God help White children.</p>

					<p>I agree w/Mike NY above, this could very well do in the Democratic Party, it has been leaning toward insanity for some time now, look at who supports them, middle America hard working Dems have nothing in common w/ left-wing wackos and will begin looking to other venues, as the wackos take over the party, its gonna be fun to watch.</p>

<p>Yet Hil says that about working-class whites and they want to lynch her. Haha. Talk about biting the hand that feeds you - this is what liberals get for pandering to blacks all these years. </p>

					<p>Blackvet:</p>
<p><span class="caps">LBJ </span>was the last President to win the majority of the white vote (1964).  Carter and Clinton didn&rsquo;t, but got enough white votes, plus non-white votes, to win.  For all intents and purposes, the 2000 election between Bush and Gore was tied, and Bush got 54.5% of the white vote.  Now, that number is a little higher, meaning that Republicans will have to get perhaps about 56% of the white vote.  Considering the gender gap, probably 61% of white men and 51% of white women.</p>
<p>In the 2006 mid-term elections, whites were split just about 50/50.  The non-white votes put it over the top for Dems.</p>

					<p>Now, now, readers of <span class="caps">AR. </span> Let&rsquo;s not be too hard on Hillary who, at least, has had the courage to delineate what we have known for the last sixteen months of campaigning (and years before that) that black Americans will always support their own in matters of economic and political preference.  Obama could have spent three or four years in a Hawaiian jail, smoked cocaine by the kilos, tatooed his body with anti-American graffiti, and they would still vote for him.  As one lucid black delegate opined, when would the African-Americans (politically correct here) get another chance to elect one of their own to the presidency (in thirty years, he suggested).  In their minds, it&rsquo;s now or never&hellip;full steam ahead.  The issue at hand is: just how &#8220;black&#8221; is a hybrid, biracial relapsed Muslim, converted (for political reasons) to Christianity, self-serving and pathologically ambitious minority going to be in office?? Surround himself with blacks only (mostly whites I would hazard), divert all foreign aid to Africa? and on and on.  The next question is: just how will the readership of AR take to this new mestizo on the political horizon? If he is reelected, that&rsquo;s eight years in the desert.  Every slip and flaw will be dissected, but that will not change the landscape: the blacks will be in power in a land where they represent only 12.9% of the population.  Maybe the next articles should deal with the benefits of immigration to a more receptive country.  I wouldn&rsquo;t even think about Canada or England.  We&rsquo;re not wanted in these places.  We are running out of time and space&hellip;.</p>

					<p>Ah, such conflicting emotions I feel about this one. On the one hand, Hillary&rsquo;s hand is being bitten big-time, and that&rsquo;s fun to watch. On the other hand, it shows the sad state of our country when she is castigated for saying the truth about white voters, yet Obama&rsquo;s smile at the 95% black vote for him is <span class="caps">OK. </span></p>
<p>In 2000, the Democrats shot themselves in the foot by nominating uber-elitist Al Gore, who didn&rsquo;t know who he was from day to day and relied on his female advisors to dress him properly.. In 2004, the Democrats kneecapped themselves by nominating John Kerry, another elitist and a Vietnam war hero fraud. In 2008, the Democrats have figuratively blown their brains out by nominating Obama. Under no circumstance can I see him winning, for reasons that this readership must already know.</p>

					<p>My friends, the convoluted way America functions is beyond understanding for many.</p>
<p>I will never believe that Africans were freed from slavery and allowed to remain in the United States due to White owners and the government making the noble decision that slavery was &#8220;wrong&#8221;.</p>
<p>Slavery, in and of itself, is a very messy business. It was far more economical for business men to coerce Blacks into working for them by offering them freedom and the means to provide for their basic human needs. Blacks, by nature, are extemely gullible and are still hooked on this arrangement to this day. </p>
<p>As the decades following slavery went by, the basic needs and demands of Blacks grew with their increased exposure to western standards, but their intellect and ability to reason did not.</p>
<p>Governments and the corporate world eventually refined their system to give Blacks the illusion of even more freedoms. The system was ultimately refined to the point that money could be shuttled from taxpayers (working whites) to Blacks via welfare, affirmative action, government health care, free education, and special government benefits exclusive to minorities.  Of course, Blacks, do not save or maximize the value of their benefits, so the money is returned immediately to the business owners. Do you follow this redistribution of wealth scheme? Be sure you do!</p>
<p>- Business owners pay the salaries of working Whites<br>
- Working White&rsquo;s salaries are taxed by the government<br><br>
- The government redistributes a large portion of the collected taxes to minorities in the form of cash and benefits<br><br>
- Blacks immediately return the cash to businesses, and they fail to use many of the benefits that were already paid for (which is even better for the business owners)</p>
<p>There is no way to organize and take physical action against this like in the days of old, because governments today are too strong, organized, and know everything we say or do if more than one person is involved.</p>

					<p>I now completely understand why Mr. Clinton committed adultery against his wife.  Hillary R. Clinton was once actually a rather pretty young woman - look at her wedding picture - and by all accounts quite intelligent, but appears to have been tragically flawed inside.  I notice that in her wedding picture she wasn&rsquo;t smiling.  Pretty, but not happy at the thought of sharing life with the man she &#8220;loved&#8221;.</p>
<p>This is a woman who believes nothing, and who will say anything.  Nothing she says should be believed by any rational adult.  Even her smiles now look forced.</p>

					<p>&#8220;After Obama had won 90% of the black vote and Hillary had won 60% of the white vote, the reporter came on hanging his head saying it&rsquo;s too bad the campaign has been tinged by race, as if it was Obama&rsquo;s campaign that has had to overcome blatant racism.&#8221;<br>

As 6:07 said, &#8220;Blacks have been voting their skin since the primaries began.&#8221;   Obama, if he were anything but black, would be an unheard of nobody   &mdash;    just as Geraldine Ferraro claimed only a month or two ago. She was right, of course,  and she was canned  for it the next day (officially, she &#8220;resigned&#8221;).  Now, Hillary is getting it herself, in turn.  I can&rsquo;t feel sorry, though.  In her case, it&rsquo;s richly deserved. <br><br>

Her only chance now is to play the race card, but highly unlikely given that she is a knee-jerk liberal. How ironic for her, it would be funny if not so sad.

<p>Agreed Michael but Hamlet did say something about the wisdom of bearing the ills that we have rather than to fly to others that we know not of.<br>
I think that her smiles look &#8220;forced&#8221; due to her awareness that she is losing to this unknown quantity simply because he has seduced the sniveling,pusillanimous White voters who seem to be thinking that maybe if they help to elect a Black/ half Black male regardless of qualification, ( what the Hell, why shouldn&rsquo;t Affirmative Action apply to the White House as well?) then maybe it will be proof that they&rsquo;re not racists and oppressors and  the criminal Black males will have an Epiphany and stop hurting them and raping their women.<br><br>

					<p>To Question Diversity, regarding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of Indiana, did you notice that Gary did the usual black voter fraud trick of hold the count back until they found out how many votes they needed to fake to put Obama over the top? For one reason or another, it didn&rsquo;t work, but this kind of thing goes on all the time in black areas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, I did notice that; the swine in the &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; media did not call the primary there until about 4:00 am. They waited until the very last minute to declare her the winner, and I think if they could have, they still wouldn&rsquo;t have called it to this very day for her.</p>
<p>Here is a thought, perhaps Hillary (who I hear is very vindictive) would be our best bet after all? Perhaps, she will remember (should she win) the media&rsquo;s and blacks&rsquo; sabotaging of her in these primaries and act accordingly?</p>

<p>How very true&hellip;. Obama is a convert from Islam to Christianity.  </p>
<p>After being elected he has two choices. He can reveal that he never converted and has been all to the time a muslim praying five times a day Allah. That would be a shock for white Americans and Jews living in the post 911 world.</p>
<p>Otherwise the muslims of all countries will regard Obama as a person who has done the biggest, worst crime ie. leaving islam. The punishment for that is death. And we can be sure there always are muslim fanatics willing to kill him.</p>

<p>   If Whites need a homeland, I suggest the 4 western Canadian provinces. There is enough water, farmland, and resources to sustain our race in more than a self sufficient exsistance. Forever.<br>

					<p>&#8220;if saying hard working &#8220;whites&#8221; are supporting her is offensive to some people like Sharpton and others, that only proves that Sharpton and others are the racists. These same moralists would not be bothered and indeed, have not been bothered in the past, when they have said hardworking blacks or hispanics support someone. What gives here?</p>

					<p>To ghw, regarding: </p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed it would! It would be simply intriguing. And great fun to watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the British say: Quite!</p>
<p>It would be fun to watch that Joe Stalin in drag, respectively giving the Trotsky and Kulak treatment to some currently smug and sanctimonious &ldquo;elites&rdquo; or those ebony pigmented parasites, who endlessly &ldquo;enrich&rdquo; us by way of the &ldquo;entitlements&rdquo; we supposedly owe them? </p>
<p>Probably wouldn&rsquo;t happen, but one always has the audacity of hope!</p>
<p>All the best to you ghw,</p>
<p>John PM!</p>

					<p>A version of rock-paper-scissors keeps going through my head.  Hillary is worse than McCain, who is worse than Obama, who is worse than Hillary.  Right now the nomination looks sewn up on the Democratic side, it&rsquo;s going to be Juan McAmnesty vs. Barrack Hussein Obama.  And to Lonely Jew, I think there&rsquo;s an excellent chance that Obama will win the presidency.  Eight years of Jorge Bush has destroyed the Republican party.  They have become the party of war, deficits, No Child Left Behind, illegal alien amnesty, and giant new unfunded entitlements.  That party did the best it could to suppress the only good candidate, Ron Paul, who would have wiped the floor with whichever socialist the Democrats picked.  I don&rsquo;t feel at all sorry for Clinton, she is reaping as she has sown.  I feel sorry for my country.<br>

					<p>We should appreciate Hillary for doing her bit to raise white consciousness. Her credibility is zero, just like that of her critic, the Tawana Brawley hoax perpetrator, &#8220;the Rev.&#8221; Al Sharpton. But we have to start somewhere to bring white interests to people&rsquo;s attention. It may take a PC liberal to broach the subject, in the same way they say only an anti-communist like Nixon could talk with Red China. How nice it would be if Hillary&rsquo;s desperate ploy pressured other prominent phonies to utter some words on behalf of whites, especially the so-called &#8220;conservative&#8221; McCain.</p>

					<p>To those, such as WR the elder, who say Obama has an excellent chance, I see your point but think (and hope) you are wrong. I am betting that in November, after months of chatter about race and Wright (if not by McCain, then by 527 groups)you will see the &#8220;Bradley Effect&#8221; kick in, perhaps just to the extent that Obama loses most states by a small margin but is kicked in the pants from an electoral vote standpoint. For me its an emotional issue. I really cannot stand <span class="caps">ANY </span>of the candidates, since none of them represent my interests, but I couldn&rsquo;t stand to see Obama and his Marxist white hating friends in the Presidential Mansion (&#8220;White House&#8221; just didn&rsquo;t sound right in this sentence).</p>

					<p>The only really appealing thing about an Obama Presidency is the zoo of crackpots and psychotics he would appoint to cabinet positions.  It would take real inspiration to come up with worse than Joycelyn Elders, Janet Reno and Condoleeza Rice, but if anyone can do it, Obama can.</p>
<p>I might even start watching TV again, for the political satires on Saturday Night Live.</p>

					<p>Most of the people running Obama&rsquo;s campaign are ex-Clintonites. They are white for the most part. Blacks could never get a black into office, or run a campaign like this. Brezinski wants Obama in for some reason, and is behind his campaign. Struck some sort of deal. Obama&rsquo;s speechwriter is a young white guy named Favreaux (I think that how you spell it) who used to write for Clinton. </p>

					<p>Is Maggie Haberman a shyster?  Is that shyster so politically coo coo that she doesn&rsquo;t believe in real and factual speech?  Obama is obamination.  He has supported a filthy racist african preacher and their ilk.  He has supported a racist african centered culture and set of ideas that is a third world mentality.  Why didn&rsquo;t the shyster Haberman not call africans racist for voting for Obama 90+ percent.  Statistically that is not probable.</p>
