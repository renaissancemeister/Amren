<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Fort Worth police earlier this week slapped the cuffs on a 21-year-old music biz wannabe who decided the best way to raise some venture capital was to cash a dodgy cheque for $360,000,000,000, NBC 5 reports.</p>
<p>Charles Ray FullerCharles Ray Fuller (pictured), of Crowley, made his move at a branch of Chase Bank with said cheque made out to &#8220;Fulla Comp and Entertainment&#8221; &mdash; the record company he planned to start. However, the wheels quickly came off the plan when the bank unsuprisingly decided to ring the person who&rsquo;d apparently issued the cheque &mdash; one Paula Prettyman &mdash; to see if it was legit.</p>
<p>Prettyman, it turned out, was the mother of Fuller&rsquo;s girlfriend, Andrea Greer, and she insisted the master fraudster was &#8220;not authorised to take or cash the check&#8221;.</p>
<p>Cue cop intervention, who arrested Fuller on suspicion of fraud, as well as unlawfully carrying a weapon and marijuana possession since he&rsquo;d decided to make his play while packing a pistol and a small amount of weed.</p>
<p>Ms Greer said of her boyfriend: &#8220;I wouldn&rsquo;t picture him doing something that stupid, I mean, hurting me and my family. I didn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d do this, something this dumb. I think it shocked everybody that knew him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Greer&rsquo;s grandmother Sharon Laird added to the mass disbelief with: &#8220;I said, &lsquo;Do what? Is he crazy? We were just in awe.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Laird concluded by noting that if her family did indeed have $360bn, she wouldn&rsquo;t be talking to NBC 5, but rather &#8220;somewhere drinking margaritas&#8221;.</p>
<p>Fuller was released yesterday after posting $3,750 bail.</p>

					<p>So he wanted to go into the music business.  Maybe his first business lesson should have been that no single human being that we&rsquo;ve heard of has $360 billion in liquid assets, much less any human being we haven&rsquo;t heard of.  Heck, no human being is worth $360 billion overall.  Not only does not one single branch of a bank has $360 billion in cash, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s US$360 billion of total cash in circulation in the country and world (not that the world wants our worthless money anymore).</p>

<p>An insurmountable problem to someone with a functioning brain, but he was probably going to ask for the cash in Billion Dollar notes, so he would only need to carry 360 of them.  Maybe he meant to write the check for ZimDollars? </p>

<p>This is actually good.  Not that any decent white man would be remotely interested in this girl, this purges our society of whites that aren&rsquo;t proud of their culture and heritage.  Same for white liberals as well.  I wish there was hope that they&rsquo;d change their mind, but it doesn&rsquo;t look good.</p>

					<p>Andrea Greer has a myspace page.  It is revealing to see her white, normal-appearing, extended family isn&rsquo;t shown sharing get-together&rsquo;s with Fuller&rsquo;s family.  Foretelling the future of Greer and Fuller&rsquo;s relationship?</p>
<p>Perhaps she will mature someday, and regretfully realize she&rsquo;s committed herself to living a &#8216;rap music moment&rsquo;.  Unlike a change of wardrobe and music styles, a child is forever.  </p>

<p>Thanks for the link.  It really provided some deep insight into the mind of a moron.  Notice her Graduation Date is &#8220;N/A,&#8221; her ghetto-loving mind makes it a point to spell &#8220;with&#8221; as &#8220;wit,&#8221; and she doesn&rsquo;t know &#8220;wha dat iz&#8221; when it comes to a bagel.  </p>

3. he planned to carry 360 bil in cash with him<br><br>
4. he was possessing a pistol and marijuana<br><br>
5. his white girlfriend is 1 out of 10 <br><br>
6. his face<br><br>
7. his white girlfriend has already given birth to a baby with this wonderful young black man before the age of 20<br><br>
8. the name of the company &#8220;fulla comp and entertainment&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just wondering who paid the bail fee<br>

<p>Yes, she&rsquo;s White&hellip; but judging from her myspace profile, she&rsquo;s just as stupid as her boyfriend. No self respecting White man would  want anything to do with the likes of her. Good riddance to her&hellip;too bad she managed to reproduce though </p>

<p>This ditzy thing  doesn&rsquo;t even know how to spell &#8220;that&#8221;.   Furthermore, she lists herself as &#8220;student&#8221;  [of what?    &mdash;   certainly not English!] and also with an income of $45,000.  [how?]</p>
<p>Btw, isn&rsquo;t there something called a Darwinian award? I nominate these two. Maybe they can both share it.</p>

					<p>Reminds me of a boxing story. A promoter had Joe Frazier and manager Yank Durham in for a meeting and offered them six hundred thousand for a fight. The boxer and manager had a huddle, whispering and writing and scribbling. The promoter wondered what they were talking about, then realized they couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to write out the amount in numbers.</p>
<p>Some things never change.</p>

<p>More than a lack of intelligence, the bigger problem with blacks is their tendency to be dishonest and heartless.  I&rsquo;d rather associate with Whites who have Down&rsquo;s Syndrome that your typical black.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure he was planning to pay her back many times over from the profits of his company. </p>
<p>Maybe he was inspired by John Lennon&rsquo;s song, &#8220;Imagine.&#8221; A family of butchers from Mexico City played that song for me at a cook-out in Mexico, and my present neighbor in the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>just placed outside my door a fake stone with Lennon&rsquo;s &#8220;Imagine&#8221; inscribed on it. </p>
<p>This song (I enjoy it as music) seems to have become an international anthem for the witless.</p>

Yes it sure has, hasn&rsquo;t it? The witless and the communistic (&ldquo;&hellip;AND <span class="caps">THE WORLD WOULD</span> BE AS <span class="caps">ONE</span>&rdquo;). Because a borderless world (&#8220;Imagine there&rsquo;s no countries&hellip;&#8221;) is the dream of the Left, not the Right. Lennon was a great musician, but   &mdash;   like many of his &rsquo;60s contemporaries   &mdash;   was totally out-to-lunch when it came to political matters. </p>
<p>Also, Lennon himself admiringly compared &#8220;Imagine&#8221; to Marx&rsquo;s &#8220;Communist Manifesto&#8221; (&#8220;Imagine no possessions, no religion too,&#8221; etc). The pugnacious Liverpudlian was reportedly quite pleased with himself that he&rsquo;d managed to euphemize revolutionary Leftist ideology into a pleasant, harmless-sounding chart-topper. Stealth socialism   &mdash;   in C major and 45 <span class="caps">RPM. </span></p>

					<p>Federal sentencing for bnk fraud runs on a sliding scale, based on the amount of money involved, and of course the judge&rsquo;s hands are tied in federal sentencing.  It would be quite entertaining to see the look on this guy&rsquo;s face when he gets sentenced.<br>

<p>Thanks mucho for the info. I wonder in what luxurious, expensive residence Lennon (and Yoko?) were living when he wrote his &#8220;Communist Manifesto&#8221;? And how many proles in need of shelter he offered refuge to in his residence to act as his muses for this song that inspired so many working men to throw up their lunches  &mdash;  uh, I mean, throw off their yoke of capitalist oppression (Boy, that stuff comes so easy after decades spent on the left!).</p>

<p>She knows she&rsquo;s white, of course.  It&rsquo;s just that there are some poor, brainless whites like her who like to pretend they belong to a favored minority group, especially Indians, because they have been ennobled by academia and the media.</p>
<p>Take my word for it she wanted a mulatto kid, because in her addled world it&rsquo;s an interesting conversation piece.  I mean, with her type it was either a pet or a half-breed kid.  This is the result of hours of brainwashing at mental conditioning institutes they refer to as schools nowadays, which are even worse than the entertainment industry.  </p>
<p>I can guarantee she knows absolutely nothing about how she has saddled herself with a mentally deficient kid that&rsquo;s going to be prone to crime and violence the older he gets, and it couldn&rsquo;t happen to a nicer person.</p>
<p>The big heartache coming down the road for these pitiful brainwashed white females like her is that society could well implode within 15 years, pitting whites and others against blacks, which will be a catastrophe for blacks, and this fad of having mulatto kids will not only come to an end it will create an atmosphere where they are disliked and ostracised by a large portion of whites.</p>
<p>Her problems are just beginning.</p>

					<p>Portions of a 1980 Lennon interview,</p>
<p><span class="caps">PLAYBOY</span>: Just to finish your favorite subject, what about the suggestion that the four of you put aside your personal feelings and regroup to give a mammoth concert for charity, some sort of giant benefit?</p>
<p><span class="caps">LENNON</span>: I don&rsquo;t want to have anything to do with benefits. I have been benefited to death.</p>
<p><span class="caps">PLAYBOY</span>: Why?</p>
<p><span class="caps">LENNON</span>: Because they&rsquo;re always rip-offs. I haven&rsquo;t performed for personal gain since 1966, when the Beatles last performed. Every concert since then, Yoko and I did for specific charities, except for a Toronto thing that was a rock-&#8216;n&rsquo;-roll revival. Every one of them was a mess or a rip-off. So now we give money to who we want. You&rsquo;ve heard of tithing?</p>
<p><span class="caps">PLAYBOY</span>: That&rsquo;s when you give away a fixed percentage of your income.</p>
<p><span class="caps">LENNON</span>: Right. I am just going to do it privately. I am not going to get locked into that business of saving the world on stage. The show is always a mess and the artist always comes off badly.</p>
<p><span class="caps">PLAYBOY</span>: What about the Bangladesh concert, in which George and other people such as Dylan performed?</p>
<p><span class="caps">LENNON</span>: Bangladesh was caca.</p>
<p><span class="caps">PLAYBOY</span>: You mean because of all the questions that were raised about where the money went?</p>
<p><span class="caps">LENNON</span>: Yeah, right. I can&rsquo;t even talk about it, because it&rsquo;s still a problem. You&rsquo;ll have to check with Mother [Yoko], because she knows the ins and outs of it, I don&rsquo;t. But it&rsquo;s all a rip-off. So forget about it. All of you who are reading this, don&rsquo;t bother sending me all that garbage about, &#8220;Just come and save the Indians, come and save the blacks, come and save the war veterans,&#8221; Anybody I want to save will be helped through our tithing, which is ten percent of whatever we earn.</p>
<p><span class="caps">PLAYBOY</span>: But that doesn&rsquo;t compare with what one promoter, Sid Bernstein, said you could raise by giving a world-wide televised concert   &mdash;   playing separately, as individuals, or together, as the Beatles. He estimated you could raise over $200,000,000 in one day.</p>
<p><span class="caps">LENNON</span>: That was a commercial for Sid Bernstein written with Jewish schmaltz and showbiz and tears, dropping on one knee. It was Al Jolson. <span class="caps">OK.</span> So I don&rsquo;t buy that. <span class="caps">OK.</span></p>
<p><span class="caps">PLAYBOY</span>: But the fact is, $200,000,000 to a poverty-stricken country in South America  &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p><span class="caps">LENNON</span>: Where do people get off saying the Beatles should give $200,000,000 to South America? You know, America has poured billions into places like that. It doesn&rsquo;t mean a damn thing. After they&rsquo;ve eaten that meal, then what? It lasts for only a day. After the $200,000,000 is gone, then what? It goes round and round in circles. You can pour money in forever. After Peru, then Harlem, then Britain. There is no one concert. We would have to dedicate the rest of our lives to one world concert tour, and I&rsquo;m not ready for it. Not in this lifetime, anyway. </p>

Alas, for all their success, only 2 survived at the end. They could have just tried to cash a billion dollar check and if they were caught, posted bail. : )</p>

					<p>&#8220;Stealth socialism&#8221; is actually Fabian Socialism.  It could be called stealth communism&hellip;All you thinkers here need to know about the Fabians&hellip;start right here:</p>
<p><span class="caps">ERIC</span> D. <span class="caps">BUTLER.</span> Melbourne, February, 1964. <br>
The Fabian Socialist Contribution to the Communist Advance </p>
<p>The great Lord Acton, famous for his observation that all power tends to corrupt, also made the penetrating statement that &#8220;Few discoveries are more irritating than those which expose the pedigree of ideas&#8221;. <br>
The purpose of this study is to trace the pedigree and the development of the ideas which have produced the Fabian Socialist movement as one of the principal contributions to the mounting forces of a world-wide revolution threatening the basic foundations of Western and Christian civilization. <br><br>
The very suggestion that the Fabian Socialist movement has played a vital role in furthering the Communist advance, still less has had any close connection with Communism, will naturally be regarded with great indignation by all those who have uncritically accepted the widespread view that the Fabians have been a &#8220;moderate&#8221; influence in politics and economics. And the very fact that the Fabians and other Socialist groups have been attacked by the Marxist-Leninists, is offered as sufficiently convincing evidence that so far from &#8220;moderate&#8221; Socialists assisting the Communist advance, they are in fact the only real barrier to Communism.</p>
<p>But as one of the famous architects of the British Welfare State, Sir William Beveridge, said, his programme was one of going &#8220;half-way to Moscow&#8221;. Beveridge was a leading Fabian. His description of Socialism is a realistic one; an admission that it is moving in the same direction as the Marxists, only not as fast, and, as many sincere Socialists believe, not as far.</p>

					<p>I just can&rsquo;t for the very life of me understand what&rsquo;s wrong with these young White girls (she&rsquo;s &#8220;White&#8221; but &#8220;Indian&#8221;???). To be young and have your whole life ahead of you, all those decades, so much potential, and to just throw it away by becoming a single mother. Worse yet, a single mother to a mixed-race kid, with a worthless father who provides nothing. Your romantic future is ruined. Your economic future is ruined. Why not go to college and get a good education and have a good career. How about meeting some upstanding young man from your own race and having a real relationship and marriage. What ever happened to the idea of a woman &#8220;marrying well&#8221;? I just don&rsquo;t get it at all. Are White girls really this stupid?</p>
