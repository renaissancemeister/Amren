				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The Age (Melbourne), May 12, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>African leaders have heaped praise upon the federal government for its apology to indigenous Australians, telling a senior Labor MP of their pleasure at Prime Minister Kevin Rudd&rsquo;s focus on human rights.</p>
<p>Parliamentary Secretary for Trade John Murphy held 14 bilateral meetings with African leaders during a visit to Ghana late last month for a United Nations trade and development conference.</p>
<p>Mr Murphy on Monday told Mr Rudd and his caucus colleagues of how leaders &mdash; including Sierra Leone&rsquo;s President Ernest Bai Koroma &mdash; were eager to congratulate the government for the apology.</p>
<p>&#8220;They all knew about Kevin Rudd and the new government, they all knew about the apology that he gave in the national parliament, and as I said to him today, that sent a very good message to Africa,&#8221; Mr Murphy told AAP.</p>
<p>&#8220;It really resonated, because it said &lsquo;here&rsquo;s a government that&rsquo;s concerned with human rights, here&rsquo;s a government concerned about the equality of all mankind, here&rsquo;s a government concerned about reconciliation, here&rsquo;s a government concerned with humanity&rsquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Murphy said African leaders obviously held Mr Rudd in high regard.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s pretty refreshing when they hear there&rsquo;s a country that&rsquo;s concerned about human rights, and that&rsquo;s the sort of message the apology sent across the African continent,&#8221; he said.</p>

			<p>First of all, what do African leaders know about civil rights in Australia when they don&rsquo;t know anything about them in their own countries where male dominance, woman and child abuse and class privilege are ways of life? </p>
<p>Now that the government has apologized, are they going to return the country to their aboriginal population and return to their indigenous lands?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re still part of the Commonwealth; did they also apologize to the white people whose ancestors were forced to an Australian hell because they couldn&rsquo;t pay their debts or were born Scottish or Irish?</p>
<p>Does anyone remember before the 1970s, Australia wouldn&rsquo;t admit immigrants of non-European descent?  Why the change-of-heart?  </p>

			<p>Only someone disgustingly petty would applaud one side, who did nothing wrong, for apoligizing to another side who was never wronged.</p>
<p>It is another excellent example of black submersion in victimhood, which is the last refuge of an incompetent.</p>

			<p>When are black Africans going to apologize for the centuries long genocide against the Bushmen (the original inhabitants of most of sub-Sahara Africa), the stealing of their lands, and their continuing oppression, all perpetrated by black Africans?</p>

			<p>Most people are not aware that (according to the latest info in Lynn&rsquo;s book on &#8220;Race Differences in Intelligence&#8221;) it is the Abos - and not the Africans generally - who have the lowest average IQs on the face of the earth: about 55. This figure is two standard deviations below the 85 level, which used to be considered in the US as the threshold for retardation; that is, until in the wake of the liberal &#8216;60&rsquo;s, it was realized that that meant that fully one half the American black population (average 22% white genes; average IQ 85) was retarded. Since that was clearly unacceptable politically, something had to be done. In 1973 a meeting was called. With the stroke of an emotional pen (actually a vote) and with no supoorting data, the Amer. Psychological Assn. moved the retardation threshold down a full standard deviation to 70, so that only one in six blacks are now considered retarded&hellip;.But back to the Abos&rsquo; IQ of 55: Only in some parts of the Congo River basin is this such a low IQ found in Africa. The Abos also have a three-layer skull, believed to have evolved in response to 40,000 years of beating each other on the head with clubs. This is not a joke; Google &#8216;aboriginal intelligence&rsquo; and follow the links, especially issue 1856 of New Scientist magazine, 16 January 1993, page 34, available online.<br>
So, given the general level of African stupidity, violence, and lack of contemporary or historical accomplishment, somehow it is just and fitting that the Abos and the Africans find a common ground for solidarity.</p>

			<p>I actually do feel sorry for the Abo&rsquo;s. They are not like us and will never fit into the white (mans?) world. And they are a broken people.They are more sad then angry. Unlike our huge growing refugee/immigrant population who just take, take, take.<br>
I&rsquo;m not saying lets throw more money at them, as that has repeatily failed.<br>
And what African&rsquo;s have to do with them I have no idea.<br>
Abo&rsquo;s are the oldest group of people on earth and have been so isolated that it takes only 2 generations to breed out their recessive genes.<br>
Here in Oz we have tried slaughtering them (it was legal to hunt them until the 1950&rsquo;s), assimulating them, educating them etc.<br>
None of it has worked so far. I think we just have appreciate that they are different and we can&rsquo;t put a square peg in round hole.<br>
And like most ethnic groups having one token member in a group of thirty whites may be interesting, adding colour, diversity and interesting new favors (& all the usual cliches that normally just equal spicey food &amp; dancing to crazy druming etc), may be charming a applease the average liberal.<br>
Once you go to their areas(prison included) and you&rsquo;re the out numbered one, you&rsquo;re toast.</p>

			<p>As a proud Aussie I can feel some irony and humor here.<br>
What about human rights in these basket cases of hell holes<br>
that make up more than half of the `dark` continent</p>
<p>As usual politicians,black and  white, all mouth pious platitudes  and pretend everything  is all OK now when it is obvious not when you look at black Africa and our own Aborigines </p>
<p>Sure I feel sorry for the Abos to some extent but left to their own devices they end up slaughtering and abusing themselves<br>
Just look at federal intervention last year which resulted in<br>
the army being sent into  Aboriginal areas to `save the children` from abuse while most of their parents wallowed<br>
in an daze of alcoholic disrepair and squalour.<br>
And to go further back in history we can look at  the fascinating story of William Buckley,the first recorded white man to live in an Aborigine community,who left to return to white society largely due to the abhorrence of witnessing fratricidal tribal slaughter between  Aborigines&hellip;so much for the myth of the `dreamtime` of Aborigines living in tribal bliss and harmony until the white man came&hellip;I would say this would be true of American Indians also.   </p>
<p>After some observation of both groups (Abos and Africans)<br>
I would tend to agree that the IQ of the latter is <br>
definitely one grade lower than the former.Also there appear<br>
to be proportionately a few more intelligent Africans<br>
than Abos&hellip;i.e odds of a full blooded Abo being a scientist<br>
doctor,engineer etc or any role using some type of intelligence  are far longer and  improbable than a black African   </p>
<p> Ok now we`ve said sorry lets now spend a billion dollars<br>
and wheelchair Professor  Stephen Hawking down here to find and fund our next Aboriginal scientist!  <br>
