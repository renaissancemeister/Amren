<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Two million British citizens have left the UK in a decade, the greatest exodus from this country in almost a century, new figures will show.</p>
<p>The Office for National Statistics (ONS) will release figures showing that more than 200,000 Britons emigrated during 2006. That will take the total number who left the country between 1997 and 2006 to 1.97 million.</p>
<p>Another 1.58 million foreign nationals resident in Britain left during the same period.</p>
<p>However, 3.9 million foreigners arrived over the decade, including more than 500,000 in 2006.</p>
<p>The body will publish the raft of immigration figures on Tuesday, as MPs prepare to dismiss the national statisticians&rsquo; data as &#8220;not fit for purpose&#8221; and demand an overhaul of the way population movements are measured.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the Treasury sub-committee of the House of Commons will conclude that the lack of reliable and up-to-date figures for immigrant populations is hampering Government policy both nationally and locally.</p>
<p>ONS figures only go back to 1991, but some historians say the departure of two million Britons in a decade is almost unparalleled in the country&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>According to figures compiled by Jay Winter, of Yale University, the last comparable exodus came between 1911 and 1914, when 2.4 million people left Britain. The other significant spike in emigration came in the late 1950s and early 1960s, when thousands of Britons left to start new lives in Australia, Canada and the United States.</p>
<p>The Institute for Public Policy Research, a think-tank, has estimated that there are more than 5.5 million British citizens living abroad.</p>
<p>Jill Rutter, a senior migration researcher at the IPPR, said the recent exodus marked &#8220;probably the greatest period of emigration we&rsquo;ve ever seen&#8221;.</p>
<p>She said: &#8220;A lot of this is people retiring abroad, which is a relatively new phenomenon and is only possible because we are all better off .</p>
<p>&#8220;There is also a much more internationalised labour market and workforce &mdash; it is now quite commonplace for people to go abroad to work for a year or more.&#8221; Immigrants who come to this country, gain citizenship and then leave also add to the total of British emigrants.</p>
<p>Opposition parties say that some emigrants have been driven out of Britain by its high levels of crime and taxation.</p>
<p>&#8220;This explosion in emigration is inevitably a reflection of the state of the country under a Labour government,&#8221; said David Davis, the shadow home secretary.<br>

					<p>How much more obvious does it have to be to the clowns running Great Britain? People are fleeing by the droves, not because they don&rsquo;t like what&rsquo;s on <span class="caps">T.V., </span>but because they feel betrayed and sold out by their socialist, totalitarian government.</p>

					<p>The significance of this really depends on what proportion of the 2 million emigrants were indigenous Anglos. This figure could be largely meaningless. But it might not. Further information is needed.</p>

					<p>What&rsquo;s really going on here?</p>
<p>Governments are refusing to represent white interests.  So whites are leaving for other lands where the governments choose more wisely.</p>
<p>I think what these governments will find out the hard way is that wealth, power, standard of living, enlightened societies and everything else that makes life good, happy and worth living, is contained in the <span class="caps">PEOPLE, </span>not the government.</p>
<p>The governments need the people, not the other way around.</p>
<p>And the people can leave.</p>

					<p>Remember the song &#8220;Rule Britannia, Britannia rules the waves?&#8221;</p>
<p>It should be rewritten for the 21st Century, something like &#8220;Flee Britannia, Britannia flees the waves of non-white third world immigrants&#8221;</p>
<p>It is sad to see a once great nation allow itself to fall apart.   First it became a non-competitive socialist hellhole &#8220;a place fit for heroes to live in&#8221; was the pitch after <span class="caps">WWII.  </span> Then it slipped into second world status and now it races towards complete disintegration.</p>

					<p>Over the last 10 years or so, I&rsquo;ve personally met a few British folks who&rsquo;ve emigrated to the United States from Britain. It seems they&rsquo;re becoming more commonplace where I live - A large liberal multicultural city on the East Coast with about 9 million people.  (Sorry I can&rsquo;t be more specific, but you get the general idea) I&rsquo;ve tried to engage them in conversation in an attempt to elicit the <span class="caps">REAL </span>reason for their leaving England. (We already know why they&rsquo;ve left) In not a single case could I get the truth.  They would always give some lame reason for their exit.  Never once saying that <span class="caps">THEIR </span>immigration problem was the cause; that they left because they were getting tired of the surveillance, the multiculturalism, the crime or even the loss of their identity as distinguishably British.  Britain is going to be one of the first countries in Europe, along with France to go down, and of course the media will attempt to keep a lid on it.  The clock is ticking.</p>

					<p> I just want to know where they are fleeing to? The Anglo-Saxons were once the virtual masters of the Earth, now they seem destined to wander the Earth  as a forlorn remnant of a once mighty nation. An &#8220;Anglo-diaspora&#8221;.</p>

					<p>The people departing are less liable to be voters for the ruling Labour party. Unlike the people it is giving British passport to.</p>
<p>Moreover the continuing increase in the English population has driven up property prices which has created the credit base that has help sustain the Labour parties running of the economy.</p>
<p>Wait for the to admit Turkey into the EU and the UK to be the first EU state to admit millions of Turks to get the housing market moving and Labour re-elected by more migrants with UK voting rights.</p>

					<p>I am living in Southern England now.  My opinion is the exodus is caused mostly by the government and only secondarily immigration (still caused by the government).  There is a law against <span class="caps">EVERYTHING </span>here with loads of police and high taxes to enforce all petty laws but largely ignoring violent crime.  If thew don&rsquo;t throw the bums out soon England will be in a death spiral.  Getting rid of Scotland would be a good start as they seem to be the ones keeping the clowns in power.</p>

					<p>In other words, there is a net population change of 6 million individuals or 10% of the British population per annum just through immigration.<br>
But it&rsquo;s much worse than that.Most of the change is concentrated in England and in particular London, not the rest of the <span class="caps">UK.A</span>lso no account is taken of the very big differential in birth/death rates of Whites/non-Whites (probably more indigenous English die than are born each year).<br><br>
So all being considered, it is very likely that England will achieve non_white majority status in a mere 20 years time.</p>

<p>It is too late for the US also.  We may not be exactly in the same place as the <span class="caps">UK,</span> France, Netherlands, etc. but we are closing in on them.  In my mind there is no other place left to go.  Both Canada and the US are becoming a swill of third- worlders and their socialist/communist fellow travelers.  Most institutions are lost, i.e. government, education, churches, even private corporations.  I do not know how I will apologise to my young children when all has been lost.   </p>

					<p>England used to have a policy of allowing those of British heritage<br>
preference in entering the country, but since this allowed those rotten racists from Rhodesia and South Africa to gain entrance, labour wisely abolished this policy. A lot of those leaving are retirees, whose money goes a lot further in most other countries,<br><br>
the rest are qualified tradesmen and professionals going largely to<br><br>
Canada, <span class="caps">N.Z.,</span> Australia and the states. Every couple of months the<br><br>
Alberta government sends a delegation there to recruit tradesmen, nurses and the like. Even in the states you will find an increase<br><br>
in British immigration, unfortunately the ethnic part of England<br><br>
does seem to be too keen to participate in this exodus.</p>

					<p>My wife and I were on vacation in Argentina and met quite a few British expats in Patagonia.  The cost of living there apparently is quite a deal compared with other retirement havens like Spain or Malta.  I got in a conversation with a couple in a bar and they mentioned the high taxes, crime, congestion and immigration as some reasons why they left.   </p>

					<p>I&rsquo;ll say it again&hellip;Anglos have dropped the ball. <br>
I mentioned last week, in a post, that Anglo-Saxons are nowhere near as vigilant or nationalistic as Slavs, or Mediterraneans. This is article is another example - rather than reclaim thier homeland they would rather jump ship. You don&rsquo;t hear of Russians thinking like this&hellip;in fact with Russians you hear the exact opposite, they won&rsquo;t allow the poisonous weed of multiculturalism to take root! </p>
<p>If Anglos you do not wake up America (both <span class="caps">USA </span>and Canada) are done for!  <br>
The scary thing is, when I try to confront my peers and colleagues who are Anglos with such issues as their unprecedented self-inflicted displacement, it is they who treat me (a non-anglo by-the way) as a bigot: What I hear is the same leftist tripe: we are all the same, colonialism is to blame, it&rsquo;s our fault, we made them this way, our careers our more important than having children, then they tell me they would rather adopt a child from Africa.<br><br>
It is so depressing!  <br><br>
God help the UK!</p>
