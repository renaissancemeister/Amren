				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Renato Gandia, Edmonton Sun, May 23, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An attack by a large group of men armed with clubs, knives and rocks left Cuma Yuksel bleeding and the Ankara cafe in shambles yesterday. The men broke through the window of the eatery, at 15960 109 Ave., and began attacking patrons. Three people were taken to hospital. (Jason Franson/Sun Media)</p>
<p>A mob rampaged through a west-end cafe in a bloody attack yesterday that sent three men to hospital.</p>
<p>After the bloodshed, angry Kurds pointed the finger at their Turkish neighbours.</p>
<p>&#8220;This attack is a well-organized hate crime against Kurds by racist people,&#8221; said Metin Yesilcimer, who rushed to the scene as soon as he heard about the violence.</p>
<p>Two men in their 40s and one in his 50s were taken to hospital with non life-threatening injuries after a group of 20 to 25 armed men stoned Ankara Cafe at 15960 109 Ave., and assaulted eight people with metal batons, knives and stones, said eyewitnesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are like Nazis. They are Turkish Nazis,&#8221; said Yesilcimer, who said he was speaking on behalf of the victims.</p>
<p>STORMED THE CAFE</p>
<p>Just before 4 p.m., about eight construction workers were playing cards, drinking coffee and watching television when the attackers suddenly stormed the cafe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody could have been killed here today,&#8221; Yesilcimer said.</p>
<p>Cuma Yuksel, 40, sustained a bloody cut above his left eye, Halil Ekinci, 50, had a swollen arm, and Riza Med, 42, had a bruised nose after they were beaten with wood and metal sticks.</p>
<p>The attackers fled before cops got to the scene.</p>
<p>The owners were left to clean up smashed glass, droplets of blood and broken chairs and tables.</p>
<p>Thirty minutes earlier, an unknown man surveyed the cafe, said Yesilcimer.</p>
<p>&#8220;He came, looked around and I was kinda feeling something bad was going to happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>He left the cafe and 30 minutes later, he got a call about the vicious assault.</p>
<p>Jalal Mardin, 31, said he was not surprised by the violence because of the history between Turks and Kurds. That&rsquo;s why he left Turkey six years ago and came to Canada as a refugee.</p>
<p>The Kurdistan Workers&rsquo; Party, or PKK, has fought for self-rule in Turkey&rsquo;s southeast since 1984.</p>
<p>The fighting has killed tens of thousands of people since then.</p>
<p>About 30 outraged Kurdish men met at the cafe last night to discuss their next move.</p>
<p>NO RETALIATION</p>
<p>Yesilcimer said they are not planning to retaliate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody can guarantee that, but some individuals would be too angry they might retaliate.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to be as peaceful as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mardin said most of the men at last night&rsquo;s meeting were refugees who wanted a new life in Canada.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of these people have lost their relatives back home. They know what war is. They suffered from our country and they don&rsquo;t want to see this kind of conflict again in Canada.&#8221;</p>
<p>Damarys Chavez, the 31-year-old wife of the cafe owner, said she now fears for the safety of her 2 1/2-year-old daughter who sometimes stays at the restaurant.</p>
<p>Police were investigating, but no arrests had been reported by the time of publication.<br>

			<p>This diversity is making Canada a much better place.  Diversity is their greatest strength.  They need to also import Chinese &amp; Tibetans, Albanians &amp; Serbs, Pakistanis and Hindus, Sri Lankans &amp; Tamals, etc., etc.  Oh, the joy and bliss of multiculturalism.  We can all gain so much from having these vibrant and interesting ethnic groups in our communities.</p>

			<p>Who said being a multi-cultural society is dull and boring. And just think. The more immigration (diversity) you get, the more the likelihood of incidents like this one&hellip; OR EVEN WORSE ONES can happen.</p>

			<p>The PKK is not a nice bunch of boys.  Check out the photos on Turkist websites about PKK activities.  These Kurds murder their fellow Kurds.</p>

			<p>Just think, before importing huge numbers of third world rabble, Canada was a homogeneous country, so dreary not much happened at all.</p>
<p>I wonder how they put up with it before the tumultuous hordes made life interesting.</p>
<p>How long will it be before we read of canibalism, voo doo rites and animal sacrifice?  I mean it&rsquo;s right here presently.  Why should they be spared such diversity? </p>

			<p>At Calgary today a woman at a bus stop right downtown at noon was assaulted by a black man.  Luckily a motorist witnessed the action and came to her help.</p>
<p>The black is still at large!</p>
<p>The color of our communities is changing and the crimes continue to escalate.</p>
<p>Who is bringing these people in here and why?</p>

			<p>There is some education needed here. Only white people can be racist and accusing Turks of it is a hate crime in Canada. Remember, the Turks did not murder millions of Armenians around the time of WWI, only whites can be guilty of holocausts.</p>

			<p>Yes, warring factions from around the world have discovered a new battleground on neutral territory called easy-going Canada &#8220;the wimp&#8221;. As a Canadian-born white guy, I&rsquo;ve seen our major cities (not the country) deteriorate into an unrecognizable conglomeration of colours, languages and religious during the past three decades that forced me out of my own city. </p>
<p>If Turks and Kurds want to do battle, then GO home and spill blood on your own turf because I much preferred the &#8220;boring&#8221; mono-culture of yesteryear. </p>

			<p>One major reason the Kurds do not have their own independent country is because their tribal leaders have made careers out of selling them out over the centuries.  Gary Brecher, who writes as &#8220;The War Nerd&#8221; has written two excellent articles on this:</p>

			<p>Let me run through the only regurgitated arguments for mass immigration again:</p>
<p>1) White culture is so boring!!!!11!!!</p>
<p>2) If there were no minorities, how could we get all those delicious foreign foods?</p>
<p>3) You can make new friends among people of different races and cultures.</p>
<p>Never mind the great burden to society by importing all of these fractious types who persist with their petty tribalism.</p>

			<p>I am reminded of a Jared Taylor interview which is posted on YouTube with a professor from Halifax. As I read this article, I kept seeing the professors shiny pate in my minds eye and wondering how he would &#8220;interpret&#8221; this. (In a very subtle and enlightened way, we can be sure!)<br>
The debates are posted at the top of this page also.<br>
Watch them if you have the stomach.</p>

			<p>We all make mistakes in life, and I&rsquo;m no different. I comfort myself with the fact that 1- my biggest mistake was made when I was in love and had my heart broken. 2- as Sam Shepard once said &#8220;There&rsquo;s nothing like a broken heart to drive a man insane.&#8221;<br>
3- I eventually pulled myself together by cleaning up MY SIDE of the street, not hers.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s this have to do with the article?  Well&hellip;</p>
<p>I was living in a foriegn country for a time and I fell in love with a beautiful woman. The first half of the relationship was Heaven on Earth. Then she went nuts, and I ignored all of the signals, as well as warnings from my friends who simply knew the women there better than I did.  So, long story short, she cheated on me and I STILL stayed with her. Something I would have never done back home, and would never do again.  Obviously I couldn&rsquo;t accept that what we once had was gone, never to come back, ever.<br>
So I clung. We are talking sheer HELL!  So, as a &#8220;remedy&#8221; I told my friends there and here in the States, &#8220;I just have to get her out of here and all will be well.  I just have to bring her to the States.&#8221;<br>
To which my friends, both here and there, said, &#8220;Why?  So she can do the same thing to you there?&#8221;<br>
I am very grateful though for the experience, because it didn&rsquo;t just wake me up to her and to myself with her. But EVERYTHING fell into place after that. <br>
Need I tell anyone here at AR that I was a big supporter of Multi-Culturalism. Well, living in another country, and seeing what I saw up close, including how I behaved, was the cure of all cures. I know this can happen anywhere with women and men.  But Ideals, like Love itself, die REALLY hard. I think it was the only thing that would have brought me to my senses. After that I started visiting sites like this in an attempt to look for some answers, since I was already suspicious of the MSM and was already beginning to have my doubts.<br>
The way we are doesn&rsquo;t change because we travel. It changes only if you are willing to kill off that part of yourself responsible for the mistakes you make. My own feeling about the matter is that I was able to clean up my side of the street because the West is the only cultural area that encourages self-reflection. So, instead of blaming her I blamed that part of me that refused to acknowledge that she was doing exactly what my buddies, her fellow countrymen, told me she was doing, ie; acting out a typical boy/girl power play drama to see who controled the relationship. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a control question&#8221; said one of my lady friends there. But I was going to show how enlightened I was and they said in a deadpan tone of voice. &#8220;But she is not playing by your rules. She doesn&rsquo;t even understand them. What she is doing might be primitive, but it&rsquo;s ok by her.&#8221;<br>
I think the only thing that will wake up most Whites is if Non-Whites and Non-North Americans start killing us in large numbers. But even then I have my doubts.  Time will tell.</p>

			<p>The same thing happens in London. Tamil (from Southern India) gangs fighting Pujabi (from Northern India) gangs, Somalis fighting West African gangs, Jamaicans fighting everybody (Virtually everybody including other blacks hate them it seems). My what bliss? The bliss of multiculturalism.</p>

			<p>This is why Canada, like its southern neighbor as well as the UK and Australia, is going down the tubes.  Canada once had a well-educated, hard-working White population, polite and among the friendliest anywhere.  Now, with the joys of &#8220;diversity&#8221; that come from importing a non-White majority, even Canada will soon be looking like Calcutta, Mexico City or one of the favela slums in Brazil.</p>
<p>Ironically, several of my Canadian friends have recently emigrated to South American countries like Uruguay or Chile, or to Alpine countries like Germany or Switzerland, if they can speak a bit of German or Spanish.  Notice, their destination countries are  &mdash;   gosh, shockers!  &mdash;   over 95% White, with tough immigration policies that make them determined to stay that way.  Unsurprisingly folks, yes, we prefer to live and stay among our own kind, and we want to raise our families in a Western nation, which soon Canada will no longer be.</p>

			<p>While we are on the subject of third-world immigrants bringing their old feuds with them to the West, does anyone remember the Air India flight, outbound from a Canadian airport that was blown up with all aboard killed by a bomb planted by Sikh terrorists?</p>
