	<p>Tim Brown for one</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t bother counting the Drivers in the photo [below] there are 33 ALL the drivers in Sunday&rsquo;s Indy 500 race including 2 women but just don&rsquo;t look for any BLACK drivers there aren&rsquo;t any in the Indy 500 AGAIN &amp; AGAIN</p>
<p>Welcome to Tim Brown&rsquo;s World. WHO IS TIM BROWN.</p>
<p>Obviously you are about to find out. For starters Brown is an African American as you would expect. And as you would also expect in the context of today&rsquo;s Box Tim Brown is  Racer Auto Racer if not a driver himself just like the 33 very successful and very rich Indy drivers above.</p>
<p>Now Tim Brown is a NASCAR man his company Tim Brown Racing and you are right the Indy 500 is not a NASCAR event. But the distinction is of little significance. There is no way Tim Brown would be in the Indy 500 no matter how much he might want. INDY or NASCAR it&rsquo;s all the same game for African Americans. Basically you need not apply.</p>
<p>But we can bring the Indy Speedway into this story quite nicely. Back in the summer of 2005 there in Indianapolis newly retired NFL wide receiver Tim Brown and Heisman Trophy winner announced he had formed Tim Brown Racing to compete in the highest reaches of NASCAR racing. How could he lose. Talented, successful, athlete, good business man, well heeled and MOTIVATED. What more did he need ???</p>
<p>Turns out SURPRISE SURPRISE. Tim Brown is missing White Skin. Oh yes here they come ALL the Nay Sayers. WHO is trying to keep African Americans out of auto racing. SHOW US the evidence. Solid proof. Some finger prints !!</p>
<p>OOOPs all we have is REALITY.</p>
<p>The fact  there are NO African Americans seriously involved in Auto Racing and NASCAR specifically except for some lone examples at the edges. Here is how the game is played. Auto Racing is very EXPENSIVE as a Sport and major sponsors are required even if you throw in your own Dough. In addition SPONSORSHIPS are the Coin of this Realm. Nobody takes anyone seriously who cannot attract Big Name corporate sponsors especially since there is more visible corporate money in auto racing than any other Sport on Earth.</p>
<p>Now watch the Corporate Sponsors RUN THE OTHER WAY when they see a Black Man coming. Nobody shouts N _ _ _ _ r in fact everyone is very friendly in a superficial way. But they NEVER invest or sponsor the African American owned or driven racing team. Do you have a better definition for RACISM. We don&rsquo;t. Not in the 21st century.</p>
<p>To make the matter even clearer the very powerful NASCAR organization could solve the problem in a moment. They could require something as simple as as non-threatening (sic)  rule that any corporation sponsoring NASCAR events or teams must contribute 5% of that sum to a special &#8220;minority&#8221; fund that NASCAR will use to supply sponsorship money to African American owned and/or driven racing teams. Problem solved.</p>
<p>Except NASCAR will never do it for 2 reasons 1) their own biased NASCAR culture, 2) aided and abetted by the corporate SPONSORS who don&rsquo;t want such a requirement. Case close AFRICAN Americans walk certainly they don&rsquo;t do NASCAR.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get back to Tim Brown</p>
<p>Because he is where the action is. It is one thing to talk in hypotheticals about African Americans in NASCAR but quite another with Tim Brown starring NASCAR in the face asking to be let in. Tim Brown Racing has all the accouterments of a first class racing business. Good looking business plan, strategic plan to get there, outstanding financials to make their case, operations center in Dallas, Texas. All they are missing is what dozens upon dozens of other NASCAR groups have overflowing. Investors and sponsors.</p>

			<p>Dude, sponsors are  in it for the money, not to promote social equality.  Black people don&rsquo;t need handouts to get into NASCAR, they need what corporate sponsors require from everybody, marketability.  They also need things like a proven record, good business credit, and the ability to sell themselves to corporate decision makers.  </p>
<p>So why aren&rsquo;t black corporations sponsoring a team?  That is the REAL question here.  Instead of demanding yet another handout program that white people have to pay for, why not ask why black people aren&rsquo;t sponsoring black people?</p>
<p>Grobbbbbbb</p>

			<p>Typical African attitude.  Never a mention if the black teams were better than the other teams, or if the black owners were asking for X amount of money, while the other owners were only asking for Y amount.  And notice he thinks the sponsors should have to contribute to a fund for &#8220;minorities.&#8221;  </p>
<p>The only reason &#8220;minorities&#8221; get upset by this is they see the amount of money involved and their eyes light up, much like when they see any other form of bling.  If I&rsquo;m a conservative Southern White man and I don&rsquo;t watch NASCAR, what are the odds that even 50% of the US&rsquo;s blacks(13% of the overall pop.) would even tune in.  </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t assume that black people flocked to the TVs once Tiger Woods came onto the PGA Tour.  The only people I know that talk of him in a good manner are white people.  The blacks I hear speak of him seem to mock him.</p>

<p>Somebody, PLEASE, make it stop!!  So help me, will there never be an end to this sort of thing?<br>
Maybe nobody invests in this guy because they don&rsquo;t want to make a bad investment  &mdash;  they are business men.  Why aren&rsquo;t black business people investing, huh?  <br>
And why, why, why is the &#8220;solution&#8221; to this phony problem always a free handout (paying for their &#8216;sponsorship&rsquo;)?  Go hit up some wealthy blacks, knock on Oprah&rsquo;s door.  <br>
Stop being a burden on everyone else.  I&rsquo;m ready to bust a gut.</p>

This blathering diatribe fails to address a critical question: can Tim Brown even drive good enough to be in the Indy 500? But the main point this bleating goat fails to realize is that 99.9% of blacks just aren&rsquo;t into vehicle-based sports in general and auto-racing in particular. Watch the Indy 500 and see how many black faces you can count in the bleachers. If the sport involves wheels, motors or sails; you&rsquo;ll rarely find black participants or fans. And the first claim is always racism and the second is always the same: it&rsquo;s a money issue. I don&rsquo;t buy that tripe. Take skateboarding, be it professional or amateur. I rarely see a black kid on a skateboard. I don&rsquo;t care how poor you are, anyone can afford a skateboard. It&rsquo;s just like classical music: if you don&rsquo;t like it, don&rsquo;t listen to it. But don&rsquo;t start whining because there&rsquo;s no black Beethoven.</p>

			<p>For purposes of my race realism education (course 101: amren.com), I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot of black publications lately: Ebony,Jet Magazine, Minority Report, etc. </p>
<p>The above article reminded me of some of the worst imaginable writing I have ever seen. One gets the impression that the author is either a child, mildly retarded, or both.  </p>
<p>Amrenners, please don&rsquo;t hate black people, pity them the old-fashioned way. That&rsquo;s how the Civil Rights Movement got started: decent Christian folks feeling sorry for a visibly pathetic group. The problem is very the same tyranny of good intentions that Jared Taylor talks about: the outpouring of pity went too far, and the receiving group was corrupted into hating the givers. </p>

			<p>What rubbish!  As a dedicated auto racing fan I can say that if anything auto racing at all levels is driven purely by skill.</p>
<p>Of course the author conveniently omits Lewis Hamilton current leader in the Formula 1 world championship who just happens to be black.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton</a></p>
<p>Also the author&rsquo;s thinking is really flawed.  Why do you need minority scholarships many of the Indycar drivers happen to be hispanic and from South America.  They certainly don&rsquo;t need &#8220;minority scholarships&#8221;.</p>
<p><br>
Tim Brown racing may not be a success but I think the author should look at other reasons before jumping to the conclusion that its racism.  NASCAR is a difficult and demanding sport and even ex Indycar team PPI Motorsports had difficultly succeeding in NASCAR,even though the team and significant sponsorship support and engineering experience.</p>

			<p>Pathetic. As a former USAC National midget driver (Ive raced with Tony Stewart, Jeff Gordon,Ryan Newman, John Andretti, Rich Vogler,Gary Bettenhausen and many other former NASCAR and Indy car drivers  etc) I have a few thoughts to share. There have been 2 black drivers at Indianapolis since 1993. Willy Ribbs in the 90s and George Mack in about 2003. Nobody starts a racing career unless they have money behind them. Usually their OWN. If they wish to go to a higher level with their racing, then you submit proposals to corporations as well as anyone else that might potantially underwrite your team. I know MANY talented white drivers that were never polished enough to secure the corporate $.  To get corporate money, your abilities on the track are sometimes secondary to your public relations skills. Tony Stewarts and Jeff Gordon types that get signed to big $ contracts right out of short track racing  are rare. Sometimes up and coming midget racers who show ability are signed to &#8216;driver development contracts&rsquo; by the big name NASCAR teams. If these drivers show potential in this area, then they might get a shot in the NASCAR truck or BGN series, which is a step below Nextel Cup. What racing experience does Tim Brown have? The guys Ive known would laugh their  behinds off at his &#8216;entiltled/victim mindset)..btw, seems corporate america is all too happy to sign &#8216;blacks&rsquo; as in Tiger Woods, Michael Jordan etc. So  Tim, arent their any wealthy black Businessman, entertainers or athletes that believe enough in you to underwrite your racing ventures? (Bill cosby Underwrote Willy Ribbs in the 90s)or do they see you as another black man in search of a &#8216;handout&rsquo; that just doesnt get it&hellip;btw, the article was FULL of typos. If this is representative of the &#8216;proposals&rsquo; Tim Brown is sending to corporate marketing people, I can guarantee they are ending up in the trash can. ps, the new up and rising star of the f-1 world, Lewis Hamilton is black. He was a go cart racing sensation, signed to a development contract in his teens by an f-1 team. </p>

			<p>When I was younger, I used to fence and ski, never saw any blacks there either. The world equestrian federation is equally racist.<br>
There were quite a few equestrians in Rwanda, when they went back<br>
to Europe, the African showed them how to handle horses. Stewed, with matoke (kind of breadfruit, looks like banana).</p>

The corp. money is a private money. They invest the money to gain profit. It is their right to make a choice.</p>

			<p>That is without a doubt the most poory written, laughably poorly written article I have ever read.  I could never understand if they are suggesting that Tim Brown, ex-football player, was a driver or an owner.  Really it made absolutely no sense. To race at the Indy 500 you must be at the absolute peak of racing skill, I doubt that a 40 year old ex-NFL player meets that requirement.  There is a black, or at least half black driver in the absolute peak of auto racing, being Formula 1, at the moment.  His name is Louis Hamilton, he is a very good driver, supremely talented and driven.  I doubt he needs a racing affirmative action and if Tim Brown and his crew were any good, they wouldn&rsquo;t need it either.</p>

			<p>White racing fans don&rsquo;t want to watch black drivers or listen to their minority concerns.  They&rsquo;re tired of having all barriers broken down (violated), and they want some cultural sanctuary for themselves and their kids.</p>
<p>The suggested 5% &#8220;minority&#8221; fund rule is anything but &#8220;non-threatening.&#8221;  It&rsquo;s nothing less than extortion; the same kind being exacted to integrate so many other facets of our society.<br>
&#8220;Problem solved&#8221;? Never, ever in this fashion.   </p>
<p>P.S. Besides the Afro-typically indignant &#8220;attitude,&#8221; the inferior grammar and punctuation found in this piece is infinitely appropriate for something called the Black Athlete Sports Network. </p>

			<p>  Give the minorities 5% of the sponsorship cash? Maybe if the sponsors&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t have to pay for minorities in so many other facets of their business, they could afford to do that.<br>
  So Tim Brown Racing has what it takes. How many major races has the team won or podiumed? What experience do his drivers have? Please tell me he didn&rsquo;t think you hang a shingle on a garage and  immediately play with the big boys with years of experience earned from an early age on local tracks. <br>
  I don&rsquo;t understand where anybody gets off thinking they are pre-ordained to get something without earning it. Must be the new welfare-to-racer program supported by the wonderful taxpayers.</p>

<p>The race hustlers Je$$e Jack$on and Al $hapton must be wringing their hands trying to figure out a way to say that it&rsquo;s pure racism that there are no black faces in racing.  They want to be in included in everything White (how pathetic)!</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t blacks come up with their very own special sport where they can feel some accomplishment ie.  spear throwing competition,  drum beating competition, african tribal dancing,  longest dreadlock&rsquo;s competition,  etc.   and just leave us White&rsquo;s alone.     </p>

			<p>They could require something as simple as as non-threatening (sic) rule that any corporation sponsoring NASCAR events or teams must contribute 5% of that sum to a special &ldquo;minority&rdquo; fund that NASCAR will use to supply sponsorship money to African American owned and/or driven racing teams. Problem solved.</p>
<p>This writer is pretty full of himself to suggest something retarded as this. blacks have already ruined football, baseball, and basketball, so why should we let them destroy NASCAR as well.<br>
Oh, and the &#8220;writer&#8221; does not know how to properly string words together to make a coherent sentence.</p>
<p>Case close AFRICAN Americans walk certainly they don&rsquo;t do NASCAR.<br>

			<p>Has there been any research into reaction times between whites and blacks? It would be natural to choose a white person if their reaction time was better than a black person as ultimately the companies who sponsor the race car want to win because they get more advertising time.</p>

<p>How about racing experience and a talent for driving at high speeds?</p>
<p>Here it is again, a black having trouble drawing proper parallels and making accurate comparisons, by thinking this black&rsquo;s few assets in things not connected in any way to racing qualify him to be a winner. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just more pitiful whining from one of a group of people that are sub-standard in every way, but stuffing a basketball through a hoop, whining about not being awarded affirmative slots in a field they can&rsquo;t qualify for on their own.</p>
<p>Reading the tripe this black writer thinks is a coherent, reasoned presentation offering valid points of view, it&rsquo;s quite obvious he doesn&rsquo;t anymore have any business trying to influence people by what he writes, than he, or his tribal kin, has of zooming around a race track.</p>
<p>The entire article would be a complete embarassment to anyone with the intelligence to know how stupid and racist it is.<br>
But, of course, a grinning idiot with the additional burden of arrogance, I&rsquo;m positive, is satisfied he&rsquo;s shown the honkies how clever and persuasive he can be.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m surprised we haven&rsquo;t seen him posting on this forum, telling us what a great scholar he is, advising us on what we can do to improve.</p>

<p>Good post, guy, but I have to disagree on one point.</p>
<p>While you expect more from the blacks, I think it&rsquo;s a perfect representation of a black who is college educated, because it sounds as if he is in the seventh grade, which is the black norm for reasoning and logic, as well as writing ability.</p>
<p>He comes across about the same as the ones we have posting on this site.</p>

I can&rsquo;t believe there aren&rsquo;t enough rich blacks around that they can&rsquo;t pool their funds and do it on their own. Just like in the fashion business- - &#8220;there aren&rsquo;t enough blacks on the runways, we DEMAND a piece of the pie!&#8221; WHEN ARE &#8220;YOU PEOPLE&#8221; GOING TO START MAKING YOUR OWN DAMN PIE? Everywhere you look, it&rsquo;s WHITES that are building houses for poor blacks,WHITES that are helping blacks in Africa,WHITES that create jobs that employ countless blacks thru-out the world!!!! What do blacks do in this world that REALLY matters? If all blacks disappeared tomorrow, would anyone really miss them? Can you imagine the money that would be saved world wide if that were to happen? Can you imagine what a paradise Africa would be if it were a White continent? Sorry for rambling on, but you get the picture!!!</p>

			<p>   Uhhh, the 5% rule is nothing short of extortion, as usual. Obviously he doesn&rsquo;t drive that well,and he doesn&rsquo;t have sponsors. Hell, let BET and some other black organizations sponsor. Talk to Je$$e Jack$on about some of his extorted money. The one thing that puzzles me is how he is going to drive with his helmet on backward.</p>

			<p>This guy has never hear of Louis Hamilton, a black guy who is a leading driver on the Grand Prix ciruit. Grand Prix racing is consider to be the toughest racing league in the world.<br>
   NASCAR has a program to encourage minority drivers and owners. Doesn&rsquo;t seem to work.<br>
   I feel that open wheel racing has given up on the great black hope. Women drivers are very popular. According to a poll 40% of racing fans are women. Sarah Fisher was voted the most popular driver by the fans. She was an average driver. Now that they have Danica Patrick who has the talent to be a winner, they are going crazy about her. <br>
   Just remember, white women have led more laps at indy than black men.</p>

<p># 10 - Have to sit upright while driving.</p>
<p># 9 - Pistol won&rsquo;t stay under front seat.</p>
<p># 8 - Engine noise drowns out the rap music.</p>
<p># 7 - Pit crew can&rsquo;t work on car while holding up pants at the same time.</p>
<p># 6 - They keep trying to carjack Dale Earnhardt Jr.</p>
<p># 5 - Police cars on track interfere with race.</p>
<p># 4 - No passenger seat for the Ho.</p>
<p># 3 - No Cadillacs approved for competition.</p>

			<p>NASCAR would LOVE to get more blacks and Hispanics involved in the sport. Did you watch the Coca-Cola 600? Did you see the ad with Juan Pablo Montoya and the Mexican music in the background? A black driver who can keep up with the white guys will be able to write his own ticket, because NASCAR has expanded from their southern roots to reach a nationwide audience. The biggest untapped audience for them is now minorities. And they really don&rsquo;t care about white, black, or brown, NASCAR is all about GREEN.</p>

			<p>Lets ignore the fact that drives make it because they&rsquo;ve proven they&rsquo;re qualified and can keep up with the big boys (in this case, white guys).</p>
<p>I say we let this writer hand pick all the blacks he believes that are being excluded because of their race. Let them race and see how they do.</p>
<p>In the likelihood they lose, you can bet this writer would be telling us the race was unfair; that these black drivers weren&rsquo;t given a fair deal because of some kind of undetectable racism and not because they couldn&rsquo;t cut it. </p>

(2) Affirmative action does not seem to apply to sports!</p>
<p>Look at a photograph of an NBA team or an NFL team. How, many whites start?</p>
<p>African Americans are certainly as capable of turning a steering wheel as white man (or white woman) - the bottom line is if they would win they would be in the picture.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed however that there seems to be a dearth of African - Americans in certain sports (i.e. swimming) and even in such quasi sports such as ballroom dancing and ice skating where a modicum of intelligence is required to learn a specific routine combined with the intrinsic discipline necessary to practice it.    </p>
<p>African - Americans seem to do much better in sports where instinctive reaction is more important that preparation and discipline. For example there are far more jazz saxophonists who are African American then there are classical musicians. </p>
