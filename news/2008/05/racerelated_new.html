						<p>RiseUp, a weekly magazine with race-related content, is set to launch June 22 in major newspapers, carrying a four million circulation.</p>
<p>&#8220;The mission of RiseUp is to provide an ongoing conversation for all races and ethnicities to better understand each other and to build stronger communities, cities, nations and a better world,&#8221; founder and executive editor Janice Ellis tells FOLIO:.</p>
<p>RiseUp, which will be driven by national advertising, has secured several newspapers &mdash; including the New York Daily News, Washington Post, Chicago Tribune and the Houston Chronicle &mdash; to distribute the magazine. Ellis says she plans to look for additional partnerships and to increase RiseUp&rsquo;s circulation to eight million this fall. By the first quarter 2009, circulation could be as high as 12 million, she says.</p>

			<p>Ah but will they print all reasonable opinions from all sides or will the politically correct Nazi-Marxists rule the day?  If the truth is rejected, than the paper must be also rejected as just another propaganda rag.</p>

			<p>My goodness, look at this and consider the ramifications?</p>
<p>&ldquo;RiseUp, a weekly magazine with race-related content, is set to launch June 22 in major newspapers, carrying a four million circulation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As appalling as this is, it appears that this will not be a true magazine, but little more than a diversity propaganda circular, similar to USA Today Weekend or Parade in real value. Something that is simply slipped in with the comics and sales papers; it might very well hit 25 million or more in circulation, but what impact will it have, other than being flipped through and then being used to line the bird cage, or help in changing the oil?</p>
<p>My guess is none or better still, the opposite of its intended effect?</p>
<p>After all, skimming through the real &ldquo;news,&rdquo; laden as it is with absurd multicultural contradictions, is enough to make any intelligent being vomit up the toast and coffee on a Sunday morn. Just what will something akin to MTV meets Oprah on paper induce, following that?</p>
<p>My guess is, a horrid case of the dry heaves!</p>

			<p>From the original article, I was struck by this:</p>
<p>&#8220;Racism, while as old as the human race, has managed to escape a sustained conversation in any media in the public domain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&hellip;translation to English: </p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve spent decades of time and billions of dollars explaining to white devils why they are white devils, and they obstinately refuse to respond with a respectful kiss to the hems of our garments, which is how we define &#8216;conversation&rsquo;. So we&rsquo;re gonna rebrand ourselves, hitch-hike on big-name newspapers, and try some fancy new graphics  &mdash;  and maybe then, a &#8216;conversation&rsquo; will occur&#8221;.</p>
<p>Prediction: this news &#8220;organ&#8221; will provide many amusing articles for AmRen readers and other non-brainwashed &#8220;unpersons&#8221;. I look forward to it.</p>

			<p>If your newspaper adds this magazine, cancel your subscription and call to tell them why.  These magazines are not &#8220;free&#8221; - they are paid by the newspapers that carry them.  Someone wanting to publish a weekly multi-culti drivel rag of distortions heavily larded with outright lies should be forced to find genuine individual subscribers, the way the newspapers themselves must.  I wouldn&rsquo;t allow something like RiseUp into my home, even if I had a birdcage that needed a new liner (the sports section is perfectly adequate for that.)</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t need a magazine to better understand races and ethnicities. I live in the real world. </p>
<p>The stronger communities that people turn to are segregated, like the ones they grew up in, where there is less threat. </p>

			<p>Apparently this publication&rsquo;s editorial content will be based on the fallacy that diversity is something to be desired, rather than causing all manner of problems as history illustrates. Sadly, there are probably enough deluded people to give this rag some success, at least initially. And it will be distributed by pro-diversity newspapers. But since its premise is based on an abundantly obvious lie I believe this publication will in time fail, as it should.</p>

			<p>As if the newspapers aren&rsquo;t promulgating the same ideology themselves?</p>
<p>Far from promoting the universal brotherhood of man, &#8220;RiseUp&#8221; will be blame whitey for everything.</p>
<p>BTW, why are they putting this mag in a daily newspaper?  The daily newspapers are declining in circulation and revenue quickly.  Perhaps this isn&rsquo;t one gift horse that should be looked in the mouth.</p>

			<p>&#8220;RiseUp, a weekly magazine with race-related content, is set to launch June 22 in major newspapers, carrying a four million circulation.&#8221;</p>
<p>I plan on handing out free copies to black and mestizo California High School students, because they have integrated so well and respect each other&rsquo;s culture so much 1000&rsquo;s are placed on lockdown repeatedly throughout the year.  </p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;d like to give copies to the Black Caucus, the Hispanic Caucus, and all the other groups that despise whites and America and want to edge them out and take over.</p>
<p>I hope the editors see fit to be fair and balanced and have well-researched articles of the racial and ethnic violence throughout history and the conflicts now in progress around the world, including the US, along with articles by Pat Buchanan, Jared Taylor, Sam Francis, William Lind and the dozens of other experts in the field of diversity.  And surely they will vigorously advertise La Raza&rsquo;s desire for Reconquista.</p>
<p>But mostly I hope they have a link printed on the front page for the Amren site, so their readers can read all about the wonderful world of diversity and what it means to all of us.</p>

			<p>This sounds like one of those throw-aways that will be buried in the middle of the Sunday paper, like Parade. I really don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t want to read about my own race, why would I want to read about some other race? Just more newspaper to throw away every week.</p>

<p>If that&rsquo;s true why didn&rsquo;t you give it a less confrontational title like &#8220;Rainbow World&#8221;?  RiseUp sounds like something you&rsquo;d equate with black power or hispanic militancy.  </p>

			<p>Isn&rsquo;t &#8220;RiseUp&#8221; the name of some sort of quasi-Marxist artist  collective group? </p>
<p>It is hard to believe that the press actually thinks we&rsquo;d WANT to read this sort of nonsense. But then they are rapidly losing readers - so it is fairly obvious that they are clueless about what we do want in a paper (like maybe some objective &amp; factual reporting).</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re already getting &#8216;diversity&rsquo; shoveled down our throats by the truckload in the regular dailies. As someone asked before: who is bank-rolling this latest brain washing scheme?  </p>

			<p>What they don&rsquo;t get about &#8220;having a real conversation about race&#8221; is that if we actually do have a real conversation about race, someone is going to get their feelings hurt. It won&rsquo;t be whitey either. Of course, that is not the real point of this rag.</p>

			<p>The magazine&rsquo;s name, RiseUp, sounds more like a revolutionary call to arms than a plea for better racial understanding.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably intended to serve minority communities with the kind of ego-empowerment pap they WANT to hear rather than provide any societal stabilization.</p>
<p>Repeat until fully programmed: &#8220;DIVERSITY = STRENGTH&#8221; </p>

			<p>I just did a little research on this publication and its figure head, Janice Ellis. Since my time is limited, I was unable to determine if Ms. Ellis is the same Janice Ellis who is a mayoral candidate in Kansas City, Mo.  Nonetheless, if interested, have a look at this site which seems to be their home base.<br>
https://riseup.net/<br>
Note the prominent red/black star at top/left.<br>
Be sure and have a look at the links at the bottom. These leave little doubt as to whom we are dealing with. If you follow the link paths, they all seem to coalesce around Hard Green sites, who I am guessing bankroll and steer RiseUp as a satellite operation.<br>
Hard Green always coalesces around ZPG or population reduction affinities, so, no surprise, the genocidalists are funding their own opposition in order to get closer to their mark. Doubtful? Consider how Planned Parenthood awarded MLK for his espousal of infanticide.<br>
Just a few things to think about.</p>

			<p>This nicely complements the &#8220;scholarly journal&#8221; that has been established a decade ago or so, <i>The Race Traitor</i>, in order to give voice to those calling for abolishment of white race.</p>
<p>Should we wonder wht AmRen did not receive this kind of promition and positive publicity?</p>
<p>&#8220;Liberalism&#8221; is winning battle by battle, mostly because of the legendary arrogance of its left-wing militants.</p>

			<p>Please allow me to substantiate some of the claims made in my above post. In order to show how much money (and therefore power and organizational acumen) is involved: Publishing, printing and distribution of magazines and newspapers is a very costly and labor intensive enterprise. To put this in perspective, If the 4,000,000 circulation figure above is accurate, this magazine would have an immediate circulation 5 places above People Magazine and on par with Ladies Home Journal (2007 figures)-or with Newspapers, the circulation of this publication will be only slightly less than the combined circulation of both USA Today AND Wall Street Journal. Even if printed on #4 14lb paperstock, it is hard to believe that each copy would cost the organization less than .75 each, which requires about $3,000,000 per edition without any payroll for writers or delivery figured in. Highly doubtful.<br>
Are we to believe that such wide distribution can be affected WITHOUT some very deep and well placed allies in the business/foundation confab?</p>

			<p>Diversity has been the most common &#8220;subtext&#8221; of post-WWII ideological propaganda. </p>
<p>Making it the main subject without causing a great deal of cognitive dissonace is going to be quite a task for the people running this country.</p>
<p>Glossy, self-righteous magazines like this one might actually help to create a backlash against diversity.  </p>
<p>Something that the so-called &#8220;White Nationalist&#8221; movement in its present state would never be able to do.</p>
<p>Which is why we should support RiseUp.</p>

			<p>Gary asks, &#8220;<i>Stop a moment and consider - what does &ldquo;RiseUp&rdquo; uniquely imply?</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>Good point. The term is usually used in the context of &#8220;rise up <i>against</i> something.&#8221; If we&rsquo;re talking about race relations and diversity, it implies that people should rise up against the current situation of race relations in the U.S.</p>
<p>But two can play at that game. I say that it is time for Americans to rise up against the left-wing propaganda and outright falsehoods that are promoted in America, from the Duke rape hoax, to the Jenna Six false propaganda, to the idea that a black president will bring &#8220;racial reconciliation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, let&rsquo;s rise up, and speak out. </p>

			<p>God, what has this country come to. Everywhere you look there is some minority whining or sueing the white man for something or the other. There are certain minorities I have no desire to have any type of relationship with because they are crude, obnonixous, have no concept of social graces, larcenous, muderous and many other undesireable traits. Others I have found to be just the opposite and enjoy a close dialogue with them. The very name &#8220;rise up&rsquo; infers an overthrow of an oppresive segment of society. Diversity is hogwash. It is a thinly veiled attempt to destroy the white race which fostered modern civilazation on this planet which all races have benefited from.</p>

			<p>I think this publication is in anticipation of Obama&rsquo;s victory in the fall and his ascension to the White House.  It will be, editorially and socially, a new landscape that readers of AR will be ill-equipped to adjust to. This will be only the tip of the iceberg when race-deniers and proponents of minority control get in power.  Rather than &#8220;bring us together,&#8221; the new credo will be &#8220;I told you so.&#8221;  Nothing will be the same; the dwindling European presence in our country will continue, if not accelerate.  Our future will be similar to that of Brazil within the next 20-30 years.  Gird your loins.</p>

I think Jared&rsquo;s article &#8220;Africa in our Midst, Lessons from Katrina&#8221; should be pushed for the Cover. The book section we can push the review &#8220;The Bell Curve&#8221; and the Movies and Entertainment section we can push for a review of &#8220;Othello, a white view on black rage.&#8221; </p>

			<p>I see George Soros&rsquo; money all over this project.  As has already been pointed out, the costs of bringing this magazine to fruition are substantial.  Without having someone with deep pockets to finance the startup costs of RiseUp, it would never get off the ground.  George Soros seems the perfect financier for such a left-wing, &#8216;progressive&rsquo; magazine as this one.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;George Soros seems the perfect financier for such a left-wing, &lsquo;progressive&rsquo; magazine as this one.&#8221;</p>
<p>All of these kinds of projects lose money though and eventually are shut down.  Look at Left wing talk radio. Look at the subscriptions of major left wing newspapers and how they&rsquo;re in a death spiral with people switching to more unbaised news outlets.  Look at the Motion Picture Industry.  From what I can observe, diversity doesn&rsquo;t sell!  So why are people like George Soros throwing money down a rat hole?  </p>
<p>On that thought, 25% of people in this country are liberals, 35% are conservative and the rest are in between.  With these kind of numbers how are liberals able to gain any traction in the culture war going on?  They have a monopoly in the media when clearly conservatives should dominate it.   <br>

			<p>Maybe it means rise up out of bed and go to work.<br>
Or maybe it means rise up you oppressed masses and take whatever you want from those evil White oppressors.<br>

			<p>Who&rsquo;s paying the bills?  </p>
<p>The age-old question arises once more.  Nobody starts up a magazine with an anticipated 4 million circulation unless he&rsquo;s backed by some serious moolah.  So what entity is behind this stupid multi-culti magazine?  Where are the millions of dollars coming from?  Oprah Winfrey?  A prominent black hedge-fund manager?  Questions&hellip;.</p>

			<p>My son attends a school in a suburb of Seattle and one of the magazines that our school psychologist (how much do we pay for that?!? and it&rsquo;s all Mexicans and blacks in there all the time) is COLORS.  Guess what kind of magazine that is?  Hmmm&hellip;they never talk about WHITE though&hellip; </p>

			<p>Like &#8220;DiversityInc.&#8221;, RiseUp will find it easy to sell advertising. If a company doesn&rsquo;t buy, it&rsquo;s racist!</p>

			<p>Normally I&rsquo;d think you&rsquo;d be right to target Oprah (as the money behind this diversity rag), Carl, but her own magazine &#8220;O&#8221; is rapidly losing readers and the viewers of her TV show are declining in number. These reversals seem to have happened after Oprah&rsquo;s endorsement of Obama. Attacking the preferred candidate (Hillary) of her own fan base wasn&rsquo;t such a good idea in retrospect.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to discover who is funding this nonsense, if only to directly confront them. </p>
<p>I used to think that newspaper fillers such as &#8220;Parade&#8221; were near the bottom of the barrel in journalism, but &#8220;Rise Up&#8221; will surpass &#8220;Parade&#8221; as the worst.</p>

			<p>Look at it this way; LIFE magazine used to be a freebie insert in the Chicago Tribune et al. newspapers. Even they went belly up and went back to their normal line of publications.</p>
