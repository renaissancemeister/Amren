						<p>A special U.N. human rights investigator will visit the United States this month to probe racism, an issue that has forced its way into the race to secure the Democratic Party&rsquo;s presidential nomination.</p>
<p>The United Nations said Doudou Diene would meet federal and local officials, as well as lawmakers and judicial authorities during the May 19-June 6 visit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The special rapporteur will &hellip; gather first-hand information on issues related to racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance,&rdquo; a U.N. statement said on Friday.</p>
<p>His three-week visit, at U.S. government invitation, will cover eight cities &mdash; Washington D.C., New York, Chicago, Omaha, Los Angeles, New Orleans, Miami and San Juan, Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Diene, a Senegalese lawyer who has served in the independent post since 2002, will report his findings to the U.N. Human Rights Council next year.</p>
<p>However, the United Nations has almost no clout when it comes to U.S. domestic affairs and is widely perceived by many as interfering. The United States is not among the 47 member states of the Geneva-based forum, but has observer status.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A U.N. panel which examined the U.S. record on racial discrimination last March urged the United States to halt racial profiling of Americans of Arab, Muslim and South Asian descent and to ensure immigrants and non-nationals are not mistreated.</p>
<p>It also said America should impose a moratorium on the death penalty and stop sentencing young offenders to life in prison until it can root out racial bias from its justice system.</p>
<p>Racial minorities were more likely than whites to be sentenced to death or to life without parole as juveniles, according to the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. It monitors compliance with an international treaty which Washington ratified in 1994.</p>
<p>U.S. officials told the body, made up of 18 independent experts, that they were combating hate crimes such as displays of hangman&rsquo;s nooses and police brutality against minorities.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t think of a more useless stupid organization than the UN. And to think that their concern is over &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; like the display of a noose, when it could be focused on real crimes like the murder of Channon Christian and Christopher Newsom! What an execrable, miserable, pathetic, shabby excuse for picking our citizens&rsquo; pockets!</p>
<p>The UN is nothing but a means to transfer wealth from poor people in rich countries to rich people in poor countries.</p>
<p>The US should get out of the UN and kick the UN out of the US.</p>

			<p>&#8220;It also said America should impose a moratorium on the death penalty and stop sentencing young offenders to life in prison until it can root out racial bias from its justice system.&#8221;</p>
<p>Such a complete lack of understanding and a display of hostile attitudes that incite hatred and militantcy in many whites.</p>
<p>If it were in my power, I&rsquo;d order every UN doplomat out of the country and level the UN building to the ground.  If any of the Africans complained about defending ourselves against black crime and violence, I&rsquo;d deport every black convicted of a crime straight to the country of the complainer.  If they wouldn&rsquo;[t take them in, they would have to be responsible to relocate them.  </p>

			<p>I wonder if this open-minded wonder boy will interview any groups of White Americans who have been grossly and disproportionately affected by crimes against them by fellow black countrymen?</p>
<p>For the most part, this Senegalese can stay on the other side of the Atlantic and away from affairs of sovereign America.  If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, Senegal has more of its own problems than it can handle. </p>

			<p>Doudou (what a name) and all his ilk have some nerve coming here and &#8216;probing&rsquo; us. Go to China and try to pull that stunt. <br>
As for immigrants and non-nationals being mistreated  &mdash;  laughable!!  If they believe this to be true, then why doesn&rsquo;t it ever stop any of them from coming here?</p>

			<p>Maybe he&rsquo;ll discover and note the widespread anti-White racism of blacks and hispanics, which includes disproportionate instances of crimes and murders and the use of racial epithets, and in the case of hispanics, involves talk of future genocide and cultural imperialism.  </p>

			<p><i>Racial minorities were more likely than whites to be sentenced to death or to life without parole as juveniles, according to the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.</i></p>
<p>Because minority older juveniles are far more likely than their white counterparts to commit first degree murder.</p>
<p><i>U.S. officials told the body, made up of 18 independent experts, that they were combating hate crimes such as displays of hangman&rsquo;s nooses&hellip;</i></p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s the worst that whites are doing to blacks, then they have it pretty good.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Racial minorities were more likely than whites to be sentenced to death or to life without parole as juveniles, according to the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. It monitors compliance with an international treaty which Washington ratified in 1994.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, once again, the U.N. proves just what an utterly useless and anti-white Marxist organization it really is. Did it ever occur to these sub-imbeciles, that the reason that racial minorities (primarily blacks) are sentenced to death or life without parole at greater rates than whites in the USA, is because they murder (often with unspeakably callous brutality) at greater rates than do whites? Conversely, did these pathetic little gilded ever bother to look at the race of the victims versus the race of the executed?</p>
<p>Of course not, the anti-capital punishment and &ldquo;anti-racist&rdquo; crowds never do!</p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t anymore then this so-called &ldquo;human rights investigator&rdquo; Comrade Doudou, will visit Duke University or Knoxville.</p>
<p>The elements of the government of  the USA (those individuals and agencies responsible for the &ldquo;invitation&rdquo; to the UN witch hunter) are guilty of an act of treasonous and craven appeasement, as far as I am concerned. Moreover, they demonstrate the usual and expected spineless contempt for American whites, that has become their collectively reflexive bon ton noir. </p>
<p>The United States &ldquo;government&rdquo; should withdraw all of its: financial, material, and human support, from this abysmally corrupt and abjectly inept organization.  </p>
<p>End of story!</p>

			<p>He&rsquo;s going to investigate noose incidents.<br>
Will he investigate 37, 460 annual black rapes of white women?</p>
<p><a href="/bjs/pub/pdf/cvus0502.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/cvus0502.pdf</a></p>
<p>Black offenders committed 37,460 rapes or sexual assaults against White women (taking the percentage from the total). The same chart shows that Whites committed 0 (zero to less than ten) sexual attacks against Black women.<br>

			<p>According to the University of Minnesota&rsquo;s Human Rights library, Senegal has been slipping into &#8220;democratic authoritarianism&#8221; since 1988. Also, religious leaders of the 95% population which is Muslim have imposed increasingly fundamentalist views on Senegal from their positions in the government. Perhaps the U.S. should send some &#8220;human rights investigators&#8221; their way.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what. Take this guy to southeast DC at night and make sure a white person is with him&hellip;let him see some real racism. The U.N. has no business coming to our land and telling us what to do. If they are so concerned about injustice let them visit some of the countries who make up the UN or go to South Africa. Any rule or law that this nation passes which defies the constitution based on anything the UN says will be ignored by myself and many others.</p>

			<p>All this is is an all expence paid [1st class no dought] 1 yr. tour of the U.S.of A for some little African nobody. And as most African &#8220;diplomats,&#8221; I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll spare no expence in his search to root out racism and will interview as many White hookers as possible in his hotel room to see if they&rsquo;re &#8220;racisss!&#8221; And all of us here already know what their &#8220;findings&#8221; will be. Like sister &#8220;kitty&#8221; said above, I&rsquo;d also like to see them pull this stunt in China [or the Middle East or- - gasp- - AFRICA!!!] where there&rsquo;s a REAL need for &#8220;human rights&#8221; investigators!! The sissies in D.C. are truly out to destroy this country, there is no other explanation!!!</p>

			<p>If this U.N. communist, globalist, parasite had any cintilla of decency, his first statement would be to denounce the genocidal holocaust of white-Christian countries, aka, Western Civilized/Cultured countries by diversity immigration instead of university constitutional democracy since the mid-sixties.</p>

			<p>It was Ron Paul who said we we should withdraw wholly and completely from Europe and the third world. Let them take care of themselves and we can get along just fine without them.<br>
But it will be Hussein Obama who will be President and we shall find ourselves in a banana republic in no time at all. Imagine a very big Haiti, it&rsquo;s coming in November.</p>

			<p>I cannot quite figure it out. Have they finished all whites in Senegal already, so now they have time to finish whites in the USA? Am I wrong?<br>
It is nice to know that Africa is a bastion of racial brotherhood from now on. This brings me another question. Why should blacks suffer racial discrimination in this ugly USA, if they can go all in Africa, the land of honey and milk?</p>

			<p>Mr. Doudou Diene can save himself a lot of time &amp; trouble, as well as traveling expenses, by simply collecting Je$$e Jackson and Al $harpton press releases and writing his report from them. I am sure his intention is to vilify/slander whites and this is the easiest way to do it.</p>

<p>What a joke. </p>
<p>The anti-white racism/classism of the establishment in this country has become so blatant, it&rsquo;s bloody ridiculous.</p>
<p>I mean, are we really supposed to believe that only white people can be &#8220;racist?&#8221; </p>

			<p>The only reason why they bother with sending these super-special racism investigators to white nations is because only citizens of white nations are mandated by law to publicly state that everyone is equal, and only white nations have the diversity secret police to punish transgressors.</p>
<p>I would prefer that these investigators carry on their witch hunt for racism in East Asia, where it is on the record that these countries view blacks as upright walking monkeys without tails.</p>

			<p>We already know what his findings will be.</p>
<p>(1)  If you visit a prison in Ohio, you will see a lot of black faces.  But if you visit an elite university in Ohio, you will see a lot of white faces.  Therefore, white society is steering blacks to prison and whites to college.</p>
<p>(2)  Harlem:  Poverty.  The Hamptons:  Prosperity.  Therefore, white society is not giving to blacks and giving to whites.</p>
<p>(3)  HIV/AIDS infection rate among blacks:  Whatever it is.  Among whites:  Whatever it is, which is surely much lower.  Therefore, white society is steering the HIV/AIDS virus towards blacks.</p>
<p>In other words, this &#8220;investigator&#8221; will merely catalog every practical racial difference, and blame the disparate impact on whites.</p>

			<p>This is not Doudou Diene&rsquo;s first appearance on AmRen. </p>
<p>There was an item sometime last year about his declaration that Islam (the religion that dominates him and his African nation) was to be OFF LIMITS for criticism or questioning OF ANY KIND. His totalitarian, speech-squelching edict   &mdash;   the kind of religious bigotry you expect from a radical imam or ayatollah, not from a purpoted diplomat   &mdash;   may have been in relation to the Danish cartoons, I can&rsquo;t recall. But what I do remember clearly is that Doudou&rsquo;s point was that Islam was NOT like other religions and that there would be righteous repercussions for Western infidels and racists who subject &#8220;The Religion of Pieces&#8221; to scrutiny or satire. </p>

			<p>So we are to be judged by the U.N?  What a joke!</p>
<p>The U.N. replaced America on its Human Rights Commission with Syria and Lybia. Think about that! A country where a black man and a woman are credibly running for president, replaced by countries where a 16-year old rape victim can be stoned to death! </p>
<p>The U.N. oversaw the Iraq OIL FOR FOOD program corruption - the biggest theft of public money in human history.<br>
After this fraud was exposed, the U.N. voted DOWN demands for an independent audit of its books.<br>
Countries SUPPORTING the audit provide 90% of the U.N. budget; countries BLOCKING the audit provide a combined total of 10% of U.N. funds!</p>
<p>The U.N. votes against America 85% to 90% of the time, while America pays 22% of its TOTAL budget, and 27% of its military budget.</p>
<p>The U.N. charter itself is fatally flawed: With each tiny made-up country having an equal vote, LESS THAN 10 per cent OF THE WORLD&rsquo;S POPULATION CAN PASS LAWS DICTATING THE CONDUCT OF THE OTHER NINETY!</p>
<p>The so-called United Nations is united in one purpose only: Weakening America souvereignity and seizing American money!</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get the US out the UN, and the UN out of the US!<br>
If we do that, the whole corrupt thing will collapse overnight.  <br>

			<p>500 years ago when the technology of ships made it possible for Columbus and others to travel to distant lands, could they ever have dreamed it would lead to this? Like the Aids virus, the sinister consequences were made all the worse by slowness of the rebound to manifest itself. Self-righteous fools like this, nursing their resentments all this time, now feel free to take advandage of our combination of good nature and dying confidence to judge us.</p>
<p>Like the introspective thoughts of an old man looking back on his life, trying to decide at what point he could have avoided his mistakes and been a different person: probably we should have developed inwardly instead of outwardly, &#8216;conquering&rsquo; the world. Ha ha, the world has conquered us, making us the victims of our own extrovertic intelligence.</p>
<p>Our technology opened up change! Change is fun, but has an unforeseen dynamic of it&rsquo;s own, tragic in our case. Whatever the subject is at the beginning, it wouldn&rsquo;t be at the end of the interminable sequence. </p>
<p>Better that we just stayed in our own lands, each generation being like the last to infinity, not being &#8220;probed&#8221; by outsiders. The truth is: you can&rsquo;t maintain the White Race,  and have &#8216;change&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s an illusion that won&rsquo;t stand the light of day for long. </p>
<p>Nature will eventually shake things down in it&rsquo;s own way. The White race or something close to it will find it&rsquo;s niche in the world, not because of politics or war, but because of organic growth in the nature of things, it can&rsquo;t help itself.    </p>

			<p>&#8220;The anti-white racism/classism of the establishment in this country has become so blatant, it&rsquo;s bloody ridiculous.&#8221;</p>
<p>That reminds me. We really need to come up with a word for this new brand of race-specific classism that our &#8220;leaders&#8221; all seem to be so fond of. </p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s more of a weird cocktail of classism and racism. It starts off as simple classism, then turns into race-specific classism, and finally morphs into anti-white racism. </p>
<p>It may sound funny, but the new anti-white white racism/classism is very similar to the &#8220;ironic,&#8221; &#8220;retributive&#8221; racism in old Blaxploitation films. Watch CNN (Roland Matin) closely and you will see what I mean: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-Fig_LoBy4" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-Fig_LoBy4</a> </p>
<p>And remember, the whites on CNN almost always AGREE with Martin. Even when he&rsquo;s not there.</p>
<p>*I&rsquo;ve noticed this anti-white racism/classism in a number of different places: </p>
<p>On television, especially CNN (Joe Klein, Carl Bernstein, and Fareed Zakaria are all masters at it), in newspapers (The Washington Post, The New York Times, The LA Times, &amp; The Wall Street Journal), and in &#8220;elite&#8221; magazines (Foreign Affairs, The New Yorker, The New Republic, &amp; Time).</p>

<p>If this &#8220;reporter&#8221; does decide to take reports, how about asking the founding peoples of this country what we think?  How about reporting the facts of blatant hatred and racism directly leveled at our race and our pocket books?  How about reporting the levels of crime directed at our people?</p>

			<p>You can be sure that there will be &#8220;findings&#8221; of some sort that will require a transfer of wealth to non-whites and programs that expedite the dispossession of whites.  The implication of this so called investigation is that America is a repressive place for non-whites who are victims of a discriminatory justice system. </p>
<p>Wonder if this Senegalese legal eagle will note the disproportionate violence committed by non-white, third world immigrants often against whites in Western nations?  Or the plight of whites in Zimbabwe and S. Africa?  Or, China&rsquo;s unofficial policy of genocide towards the Muslim Uigers by flooding the Xinjiang Province with non-Muslim Chinese? This  genocide through inundation is similar to what whites are suffering in America by the government allowing millions of mostly poor, illiterate Mexicans into this country annually.</p>
<p>The simple answer is for the aggrieved minorities to leave America forthwith and for blacks to stop committing so much violent crime. We can only dream.      </p>

Good point.   Since the USA is not a member of the U.N. Human Rights Council, it&rsquo;s hard to explain what authority he has here.  And is he coming here in response to a complaint, I wonder?  If so, by whom?</p>
<p>Incidentally, Canada is a member, and I notice that it is listed (curiously) among the European countries on the organization&rsquo;s website   &mdash;   not with the other countries of the Western Himisphere.  </p>

<p>Correction: the US Black population has by far the highest standard of living of any large group of blacks, working class or not, in the world.(this excludes the blacks who constitute the governmental kleptocracy in so many African nations, but they are small in relative numbers and do not represent the people in any of these countries.)</p>
<p>The UN along with all of the other supranational NGO&rsquo;s are a direct threat to our sovereignty and should not receive a dime in US support, much less encouragement.  We should have withdrawn from the UN many years ago.  The fact that this arrogant African dares to judge our country is an outrage and should not be tolerated.  There was a time in America, not long ago, when such a thing would have been unimaginable.  Today it is reality.  Something has changed and needs to be radically addressed now.</p>
