						<p>The President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, underlined here Monday that Islam is part and parcel of Europe and he also condemned the concept of clash of civilisations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Islam today is part of Europe. It is important to understand this. One should not see Islam as outside Europe. We already have an important presence of Islam and Muslims among our citizens,&#8221; Barroso told a press conference this afternoon after an informal dialogue between EU leaders and around twenty high-level representatives of Christianity, Judaism and Islam in Europe.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can be a European citizen being a Christian, being Jewish or Muslim or having no religion,&#8221; he noted.</p>
<p>On his part, the Grand Mufti of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Dr.Mustafa Ceric, said Islam is indeed part of Europe but unfortunately Turkey is not yet part of Europe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Following this logic Europe has to prove that Islam is part of Europe by not delaying the acceptance of Turkey to the EU,&#8221; Ceric told the joint press conference.</p>
<p>Many people in Turkey and the Muslim world believe that Turkey will not be accepted as an EU member because it is a Muslim country.</p>
<p>Mondays meeting was co-chaired by European Commission President Barroso, Slovenian Prime Minister and current President of the European Council, Janez Jansa, and the President of the European Parliament, Hans-Gert Pottering.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s meeting focused on two major challenges facing the European Union: Climate Change and Reconciliation.</p>
<p>This was the fourth such annual meeting with religious leaders and the second involving the Presidents of the three EU institutions. The initiative was launched by President Barroso in 2005.</p>
<p>Barroso said that the inter-faith dialogue proved that &#8220;preachers of clash of civilisations are wrong&#8221;.</p>
<p>Janez Jansa told reporters that &#8220;the environment is not only natural but also a sacred place. Community and loalty between man, nature and the Creator is a basic principle of Judaism, Christianity and Islam alike&#8221;.</p>
<p>Slovenia, he said, would like to create an Euro-Mediterranean university which will be a meeting place for young people coming from the Christian, Muslim and Jewish world.</p>
<p>A charter will be signed on 9 June in Slovenia, which holds the current EU Presidency, on creating this new university.</p>
<p>EP President Pottering said &#8220;intercultural dialogue is an important contribution to the European Union&rsquo;s relations with its neighbouring countries, in particular in the Mediterranean region&#8221;.</p>
<p>He noted that since the EU has declared 2008 as the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, the high-level meeting is a welcome opportunity to focus o on the topic of &#8220;Reconciliation through intercultural and inter-faith dialogue&#8221;.<br>

<p>The European Commission is not a part of Europe; it is a concept and an organization which stands condemned. </p>

					<p>Europe&rsquo;s answer to Ted Kennedy. With friends like him, who needs enemies. How do these people get into positions of power ?  Here all you need is someone like George Soros and a bought and paid for media to claim this guy is the greatest thing since sliced bread. The American people are so gullible.</p>

<p>(*&rsquo;he&rsquo; = Slovenian Prime Minister and current President of the European Council, Janez Jansa)</p>
<p>If this guy Jansa is suggesting that his dream university be placed in Slovenia, then he&rsquo;s a madman who failed to learn anything about the break-up of Yugoslavia.  Slovenia got out of Yugoslavia relatively unscathed, precisely because it was a mono-culture.  Meanwhile, the &#8216;culturally diverse&rsquo; south was torn to bits, with Kosovo now turning fully Muslim.  And now Jansa apparently seeks to invite the cancer of Islam right into his homeland, a heavily Catholic nation where Islam has no history and no business being a player.</p>
<p>Slovenia is a nation of 
<p>Jansa&rsquo;s dream will become Slovenia&rsquo;s nightmare.</p>

					<p>These multi country unions do nothing but destroy individual national idenity. How can this be a good thing. Individual national customs and ways of life are diluted when absorbed into larger unions until there is a hodgepodge of peoples with little in common. I believe the original intent of the European Union was to give more economic strenght to its members.Now some leaders want to intergrate cultures as well. And who benefits most? Muslims of course. The more they are accepted and involved in each country the more they are able to further their agenda, which is not economic but cultural and religious dominance. Islam is still not recognized for what it is, which is a faith that seeks to enslave, diminish individual stature, all women and create a world of no freedoms where the slightest infraction results in behedings and other sufferings. Muslims seek an entirely joyless world. Why isn&rsquo;t this seen when it is so obvious. </p>

&#8220;Many people in Turkey and the Muslim world believe that Turkey will not be accepted as an EU member because it is a Muslim country.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
It would be more accurate to say that Turkey <span class="caps">SHOULD </span>not be accepted as an EU member because it is a Muslim country   &mdash;   but considering the suicidal path the Continent is taking these days, it probably <span class="caps">WILL </span>be. </p>
<p>Despite the fact that Turkey is not now nor has ever been what could meaningfully be called European. </p>
<p>Also, please note that someone or something called a Grand Mufti is now dictating to Europeans what they must or must not do with their countries. His desire to see the Turks admitted is not phrased a request; it is phrased as an imperative. </p>
<p>What boobs like Barroso need to understand is: let Turkey in, and the various grand muftis, mullahs and ayatollahs of Islam Inc. will be calling the shots in Brussels even more than they currently do. <br>

					<p>Islam is a part of Europe, but should it be?</p>
<p>And why must all dialogue lead to reconciliation?  Couldn&rsquo;t familiarity breed contempt?  How about we talk about ayesha, the prophet&rsquo;s 6 year old bride?  Or female genital mutilation being approved of in the hadith?  Or how under Islam men can beat their wives when they&rsquo;re disobedient?  Fitna was also &#8216;dialogue.&rsquo;  It just depends whether people want to talk about airy nothings and lies, or about reality, facts, and the truth.</p>

					<p>Or&hellip;alternatively, the people of Europe say Muslims are not Europeans, we didn&rsquo;t vote for them to come here and we want them to leave.  Furthermore, this will be the case well after Snr. Jose Manuel Barroso has moved on to a multi-cultural paradise in the sky.  Just an alternative view, Snr. Barroso.  By the way, some of us favour a Europe without Spain.</p>

					<p>It&rsquo;s funny, if there&rsquo;s one thing that isn&rsquo;t the case, it&rsquo;s the notion that &#8220;Islam is a part of Europe.&#8221;  Of all the possible cases that can be made   &mdash;   that Christianity is a part of Europe as much as it is a part of the Middle East; that Judaism is a part of Europe as much as it is a part of the Middle East, etc., etc.   &mdash;   one cannot make that same claim for Islam.  In an alternate universe, it may have been.  But there was Tours.  So it didn&rsquo;t happen.  So what if there&rsquo;s a little influence in Spain.  So what if Turkey sits next to Europe.  By any objective measure, such a claim is just absurd. </p>

					<p>European history has been defined by repelling invasions from Asia and North Africa.  Religion is irrelevant, it&rsquo;s about White genetics defending against outsiders.  Resistance to genetic displacement is adaptive for any living thing.</p>
<p>If people like Charles Martel didn&rsquo;t stand and fight, there would probably be no civilization, just barbarism, and the White race would have long ago been diminished to nothing.    </p>

					<p>&#8220;Islam is part of Europe&#8221;<br>
It certainly is a bloody part of Europes history. Yes. I remember going on a vacation to Austria many years ago, and seeing the suits of armor in an Austrian museum,six thousand of them, that were worn by the brave knights that defeated the Islamic waves of attack that plauged Europe and were stopped at Vienna some three hundred years ago or so. Today, Austria is very liberal in allowing Islamic immigration. No comment. </p>

					<p>The irony is that Barroso is a Portuguese - and his ancestors were lorded over by muslims for over 500 years.When his christian ancestors got the upper hand, they lost no time whatsoever in either expelling the muslim invaders or forcefully converting them to christianity - and deliberately expunging every last trace and vestige of Islan from Iberia in an attempt to make-believe that the 500 year occupation was just a bad nightmare.<br>
How his ancestors must cringe from beyond the grave!</p>

					<p>I am more afraid that the rise of Islam in Europe will give hard-core secularists an excuse to condemn religion as a whole. Right now they are discussing, that if muslims can&rsquo;t shouldn&rsquo;t use af scarf in court, then crucifixes should be banned too! So, ten years of muslim history in my country, should overrule a thousand years of christian history?<br>
Don&rsquo;t worry about Turkey, though - it&rsquo;s hard-core secular, and I guess thats the lesser of two evils, but I&rsquo;m not comfortable that lutheran secular soceity risks replacement with a an atheists-controleled secular soceity, with the lame excuse of accomodating muslims!</p>

<p>Stalin once said that to realize global communism, first you have to create blocks of countries all around the globe, tell people they are &#8220;citizens&#8221; of that block and no longer citizens of their original country.  Well, nobody is going to feel too much patriotism for an economic block, hence over a couple generations, you&rsquo;ll erase the sovereignty of the nations which originally composed the block.<br>
Next you combine the first round of economic blocks into larger blocks, using the same technique.  Finally, you combine all the blocks into world gov&rsquo;t.<br><br>
Incrementalism at it&rsquo;s best; the standard technique of the radical left.<br><br>

Just a comment from an American: Until the last 10 years or so, given the darkening face of the rest of Europe, it was a pleasure to visit Spain because that was getting to look like the whitest country left in Western Europe. </p>
<p>Not so now, I&rsquo;m afraid. Their own invasion is under way, with blind men like Barroso looking on and seeing nothing but love and harmony while, he smiles on more immigration.   Have fools like him learned nothing from  their history?   Does  the year <span class="caps">AD711 </span>have no significance to them?</p>

You should be more worried about your spineless churchmen who are bending over backwards to be nice to the invaders.</p>

					<p><i>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not a good idea if for no other reason than tourism. Tourists want to see Holland of the windmills and wooden shoes, and London of Big Ben and changing of the guard. If those things go away, so do the tourists. &#8221;  <br>
Posted by 9:05 AM </i><br><br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..<br><br>
Most of those  sights have already gone, and tourists expecting to see the Old Europe will get a big surprise.  It&rsquo;s just like tourists who go to the US and expect to see cowboys and Indians everywhere.</p>
<p>The fact is, there are just a few windmills left in Holland, and they are preserved as national monuments. Tourists are taken there to get their pictures taken. They exist nowhere else. And nobody wears wooden shoes; you will never see them except in shops selling tourist trinkets.</p>
<p>And forget about little blond Dutch  boys and girls with golden locks. Except for a lingering few remnants, you will see a  dusky potpourri of humanity from every corner of the earth. That is the New Europe that the multicultists love so much and are creating under our noses.</p>
<p>The tourists will still come, but they will be different too.  I have right here before me a brochure  from Delta Airlines showing your &#8220;typical&#8221;  well-heeled mulatto tourists exploring the byways of Venice and enjoying the delights of multicultural London.  With all the West Indians there, I have known American blacks who have gone to London and practically thought they found Heaven.  I suppose Africans must think the same of Paris.</p>

					<p>What a terrible century for Europe.</p>
<p>They killed millions of each other in two ghastly wars.</p>
<p>They are now surrendering to the Islamic horde without firing a shot.</p>
<p>Even the Red Army eventually left Europe. The waves of illegal Islamic immigrants are coming to stay.</p>

					<p> &#8220;Almost 1300 years ago Charles Martel provided the answer to whether or not Muslims can also be European:&#8221;<br>
Posted by <span class="caps">ODDL</span><br><br>
  &mdash;      &mdash;      &mdash;      &mdash;      &mdash;      &mdash;      &mdash;  <br><br>
Where is a Martel or Joan of Arc today, when Europe is in such great need? </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even a question at this point of whether WE agree that Islam can live with us in our midst.  Our opinion is irrelevant. The greater, more pertinent, question is whether Islam can agree that it can live in peace and equality <i>with us. </i>  All history proves otherwise, and their Koran confirms it.  </p>
<p>The official position of Islam is that it alone is the True Religion, the &#8220;Perfect Religion&#8221;,  and that it alone (when given sufficient power) must be supreme over all others.  It has  no notion of equality, which  to them would be heretical.  All lesser faiths must bow down before Islam, and they can be tolerated so long as they acknowledge their submission.  Other faiths  (those not of &#8220;The Book&#8221;), plus pagans, atheists, polytheists, and unbelievers, <i>have no right to exist AT <span class="caps">ALL. </span></i>   </p>
<p>Some modern apologists may try to argue around that, but the fact remains that it is written in the Koran to hunt down the infidels and convert them or kill them; and until the Koran is revised  [not likely, since it is the word of Allah],  that will remain a core tenet of their religion.  Islam is more than just a religion, it is a political syatem for extending their power over others. The blunt fact is that they don&rsquo;t want to live <span class="caps">WITH </span>you; they want to rule <span class="caps">OVER </span>you.  Regardless of any personal feelings of any individual Moslems, their religion commands it.  </p>
<p>And traitorious fools like Barroso, with their utopian marxist notions,  are their useful idiots.</p>

<p>At a minimum (if they must be accepted at all), no professed Moslem should be granted residence or citizenship in any European country unless they sign a formal rejection of the above belief.  Any violation of their oath would be grounds for immediate expulsion and confiscation of any property they had acquired while there under such false pretenses.</p>

					<p>There is already a fully-fledged EU plan to enlarge and include fringe Mediterranean countries from N. Africa etc. Of course, allowing Turkey&rsquo;s entrance first, despite the fact that 97% of Turkey&rsquo;s land mass is in Asia Minor &amp; only 3% in Europe [a minor detail to these EU/NWO/Fabian/socialist/Red Fascists], would easier facillitate these muslim countries&rsquo; membership of the <span class="caps">EU.</span> The internet-awakening of many European whites has forced this bold stroke from our EU/NWO masters. They know that, a push &amp; a shove, &amp; there is no going back. Further mass immigration will see the end of Western civilisation &amp; white nation-states. And what&rsquo;s to stop further enlargements to include other African countries etc. With this stroke a main part of the <span class="caps">NWO </span>one-world plan is accomplished. The EU Red Fascist state [an iron fist in a velvet glove] has set up the new EU police force, Europol who have powers to operate in any EU state. They will have less qualms about cracking heads if it is not their own nationals. For proof of this see on youtube the beating of democratically-elected Vlams Blok [Flemish nationalist party in Belgium] politicians at a public meeting who had the nerve to say things against the multicultural <span class="caps">EU.</span> The unnecessary viciousness used against peaceful middle-aged Flemish nationalists was obviously ordered from above and in total contrast to the tiptoe-thru-the-tulips approach when confronting violent Muslim rioters. Incredibly the democratic Vlams Blok party was banned, [though they later re-formed as Vlams Belang] their democratic point of view deemed unsuitable in the multicultural Red Fascist <span class="caps">EU.</span> Thus are white nations marked for extinction.</p>

In his one year since taking office, Sarkozy has been all over the area repeatedly, proposing various partnerships and closer cooperation, even vacationing in Egypt during Christmas.  I&rsquo;m unaware that he&rsquo;s visited any place north of Paris (excepting London just last month).</p>
<p><i>And what&rsquo;s to stop further enlargements to include other African countries ?</i><br>
Exactly!  Sarkozy has been busily working on that, proposing in Dakar a union of &#8220;Eurafrique&#8221; that would not be based on &#8220;the sickness of racism&#8221;.  That was mentioned here back in Nov. or Dec.</p>

Obviously that&rsquo;s the whole idea!  Precisely.  It can&rsquo;t be emphasized enough.  Why do so few people get it?</p>

					<p>Of course, Manuel Barrossa is another &#8221;ex-Marxist&#8221; like most of these European Fabian/socialist/Marxist political traitors which includes, Zapatero, Blair, Mandelson, Miliband, Margaret Hodge nee Oppenheimer, Jack Straw, Merkel, Sarkozy &amp; many many others.</p>

<p>I hope not. I can think of more likely possibilities - which cannot be mentioned here. Fools and trolls like that are forever sowing discord among us.</p>
<p>There is always someone trying to poison the well.</p>
