				Is Worse Better? Some Surprising White Support for Obama
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i><a href="https://www.vdare.com/bradley/index.htm">Peter Bradley,</a> VDARE.com, May 5, 2008</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				If you pay a visit to Barack Obama&rsquo;s official campaign website, you will find a host of subgroups in the <b>&#8220;People&#8221;</b> section boosting his candidacy. The man who will help us overcome race has separate categories for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, Latinos, First Americans (he is not talking about the ancestors of <a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennewick_Man">Kennewick Man</a> ) and, of course, African Americans. If you are white and racist enough to notice you are not part of Obama&rsquo;s rainbow, don&rsquo;t worry. You can still join groups for students, women, veterans or the LGBT crowd.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you are just what Obama notoriously called a <b> &#8220;typical white person&#8221;</b> who is not part of these groups, then you are out of luck. But maybe not for much longer.
			</p>
			<p>
				A significant number of white race activists &mdash; they often call themselves <b>&#8220;white nationalists&#8221;</b>, analogous to black nationalists, Hispanic nationalists or Zionists and <i>not</i> the same thing as white supremacists &mdash; are supporting an Obama presidency as the lesser of two evils and, possibly, the catalyst for a wake up call for white America.
			</p>
			<p>
				Newhouse News reporter Jonathan Tilove covered the <a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="/conference/2008/index.html">2008 American Renaissance conference</a> in late February and quoted a number of whites who were ready to support the Senator from Illinois.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>&#8220;We are facing the election of Barack Obama, or, even worse, McCain,&#8221;</b> said Sam Dickson, Atlanta attorney and longtime racial activist during his closing speech. [<i>A View Of Obama From The Trenches Of White Nationalism</i>, February 27, 2008)]
			</p>
			<p>
				Maryland attorney Howard Fezell wondered if black racial loyalty to Obama could make some whites wonder why they can&rsquo;t do the same. <b>&#8220;Only white voters are expected to look beyond race,&#8221;</b> he said.
			</p>
			<p>
				Even Jared Taylor, editor of <i><a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="/conference/2008/index.html">American Renaissance</a></i>, praised Obama&rsquo;s campaign strategy and stated that he does not know who he will vote for in November.
			</p>
			<p>
				Paul Gottfried, who also spoke at the event, speculated that most of the over 250 people in attendance would most likely support Obama over McCain. <b>&#8220;Better a black who is honest about who he is than a conservative who is really delivering the liberal agenda,&#8221;</b> declared Gottfried.
			</p>
			<p>
				There seem to be three main reasons for this unexpected support for Obama&rsquo;s candidacy.
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				*&nbsp;&nbsp;First: <a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="https://search.atomz.com/search/?sp-q=%22john+McCain%22&amp;sp-a=sp0a298a00&amp;sp-advanced=1&amp;sp-p=all&amp;sp-w-control=1&amp;sp-w=alike&amp;sp-d=custom&amp;sp-date-range=-1&amp;sp-start-month=0&amp;sp-start-day=0&amp;sp-start-year=&amp;sp-end-month=0&amp;sp-end-day=0&amp;sp-end-year=&amp;sp-x=any&amp;sp-c=25&amp;s">John McCain</a>&rsquo;s stands on affirmative action, immigration, official English, the Confederate flag, and other racially-tinged issues are, in fact, pretty much the same as Obama&rsquo;s.
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				The Republican nominee recently <a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/04/AR2008040401741.html">told a black audience</a> that his vote against the <a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="https://search.atomz.com/search/?sp_q=%22martin+luther+king%22&amp;sp_a=sp0a298a00&amp;sp_f=iso-8859-1&amp;sp-advanced=1&amp;sp-p=all&amp;sp-w-control=1&amp;sp-w=alike&amp;sp-d=custom&amp;sp-date-range=-1&amp;sp-start-month=0&amp;sp-start-day=0&amp;sp-start-year=&amp;sp-end-month=0&amp;sp-end-day=0&amp;sp-end-y">MLK</a> holiday was the greatest mistake of his political career. He equates immigration reform with <b>&#8220;bigotry.&#8221;</b> As I write this, McCain is promising a renewed <b> &#8220;War on Poverty&#8221;</b> and <a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="https://www.amnation.com/vfr/archives/010446.html">criticizing an ad</a> by <a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="https://pages.citebite.com/q4b8v0o7jkqc">North Carolina Republicans </a> that draws attention to the race-baiting comments of Obama&rsquo;s spiritual mentor, Rev. Jeremiah Wright.
			</p>
			<p>
				Larry Auster of the mildly white-nationalist View from the Right blog <a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="https://amnation.com/vfr/archives/010050.html">writes</a>: <b>&#8220;at least the Democratic president, as he welcomes <a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="https://michellemalkin.com/2008/02/12/president-bush-welcomes-al-sharpton-to-the-white-house/">Al Sharpton</a> to the White House, won&rsquo;t be giving us lectures on &lsquo;true conservatism.&rsquo;&#8221;</b> Auster views McCain as a virtual death sentence for conservatism in America.
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				*&nbsp;&nbsp;Second: Iraq and <a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="https://search.atomz.com/search/?sp-q=neoconservatism&amp;sp-a=sp0a298a00&amp;sp-advanced=1&amp;sp-p=all&amp;sp-w-control=1&amp;sp-w=alike&amp;sp-d=custom&amp;sp-date-range=-1&amp;sp-start-month=0&amp;sp-start-day=0&amp;sp-start-year=&amp;sp-end-month=0&amp;sp-end-day=0&amp;sp-end-year=&amp;sp-x=any&amp;sp-c=25&amp;sp-">neoconservative</a> foreign policy. Almost all paleoconservatives and paleolibertarians are against the war and interventionism abroad.
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				If we must have race quotas and amnesties, at least a President Obama would get us out of a costly war. McCain could well get us into an even deadlier conflict with Iran.
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				*&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, and most important: an Obama presidency could shake up the current racial dynamics and bring about an end to white guilt and passivity over racial issues.
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				As Jared Taylor told Jonathan Tilove,<b>&#8220;I think many smarter, far-thinking blacks are going to be worried that any time they start talking about discrimination, certainly institutional racism, people are going to say, &lsquo;Hey, look, you&rsquo;ve got a black president for heaven&rsquo;s sake.&rsquo;&#8221;</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				TakiMag&rsquo;s Christopher Roach made the point that an Obama presidency could make whites more racially aware even more bluntly: <b>&#8220;a political equivalent of the O.J. Trial for four years might be the right catalyst for this sort of &lsquo;consciousness raising.&rsquo;&#8221;</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				The Obama record on race is eye-opening for those who will look. The racialism of his autobiography, the anti-white comments of his wife and of his spiritual mentor, his attendance at Louis Farrakhan&rsquo;s Million Man March, his support for the Jena Six race attackers, his insulting <b>&#8220;race speech&#8221;<span style="font-weight:normal"></b> and slurs about <b>&#8220;typical whites&#8221;</b> and <b>&#8220;bitter&#8221;</b> people in rural America all point to a man who has more in common with Al Sharpton than Ward Connerly. Marcus Epstein agrees on the potential for a white backlash. <b>&#8220;We can be sure that a president Obama will be push for the same anti-white policies of Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton, while posing as a post-racial unifier,&#8221;</b> he says. <b>&#8220;The question is whether or not the public will buy that facade.&#8221;</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				As director of <a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="https://www.theamericancause.org/">Pat Buchanan&rsquo;s American Cause,</a> Epstein receives quite a bit of feedback from blacks on the true meaning of an Obama presidency. One of the more printable responses came from a black man who told him:<b> &#8220;You [</b>presumably whites<b>] have had 100 </b>[<i>sic</i>] <b>presidents, why can&rsquo;t we have one?&#8221;</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				The whites who support Obama tend to be young, affluent liberals who truly believe the Obama campaign is about racial unity. But blacks are not supporting Obama so they can hold hands and sing Dave Matthews songs with rich white kids from the suburbs. (I recently saw a news clip of a free Dave Matthews concert given in support of Obama and <a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fbxq3PaEp4">literally every face in the crowd was white.</a>)
			</p>
			<p>
				Clearly these two main groups of Obama supporters are on a collision course.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is not hard to predict which race is in for a rude awakening.
			</p>
			<p>
				Personally, I plan to vote for the Constitution Party which just nominated Chuck Baldwin as its presidential candidate. Baldwin is an immigration patriot and a strong conservative on all issues. A vote for him will send a clear message to the GOP that the McCain-Bush type of Republican Party is unacceptable and unworthy of support.
			</p>
			<p>
				But an Obama presidency at least offers the possibility of an energized right wing movement in which paleos and whites of the Jared Taylor-Sam Francis school can find a home.
			</p>
			<p>
				Just as forced integration and busing woke up many northern white ethnics in the 1960s and 70s, a black race-driven president who uses his office to excuse black rioters and defend black gangs who attack white kids will be a real eye-opener for many a nice white liberal &mdash; to say nothing of the slumbering <b> &#8220;conservative&#8221;</b> masses.<br />

				Chuck Baldwin or Ron Paul are the <span class="caps">ONLY </span>choices for White voters. Yet the self-hating Whites are too stupid to even notice, much less care! What a bunch of hoof-diseased cattle we have in our midst.

				An Obama presidency would benefit our cause immensely.
			</p>
			<p>
				Although I think that the masses are incapable of true &#8220;racial consciousness.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				The racial attitudes of the masses are shaped only by their unconscious minds (white flight, race differences, etc.).
			</p>
			<p>
				Only a small minority of people in every race, especially our race, the White race, have an inborn &#8220;biological&#8221; or &#8220;racial&#8221; consciousness. (And I think this is a good thing)
			</p>
			<p>
				We can help bring out the unconscious racial attitudes of the masses, but that&rsquo;s about all.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am convinced that most White people only have a &#8220;social consciousness.&#8221; Which is the main reason why our race is in the trouble it is in.
			</p>
			<p>
				It&rsquo;s almost a sort of &#8220;biological&#8221; or &#8220;racial&#8221; mindblindness that many Whites seem to suffer from.
			</p>
			<p>
				I&rsquo;m sure some of you have noticed this.

				I was very disappointed when I read Jared&rsquo;s comments on Obama.I felt anyone with advanced white consciousness could <span class="caps">NEVER </span>support a leftist mulatto and would speak out in very forceful terms as to the major threat his election posed to our people.Hopefully, Taylor will completely change his tune. I detest McCain..but we can abstain from voting for president or vote for a third party.It is imperative for all racialists to oppose Obama and see it as an imperative that his election would be a <span class="caps">DISASTER </span>for our people.

				<br />
				Well said, my white brother. An excellent article overall &mdash; with extra bonus marks for making fun of Dave Matthews fans.
			</p>
			<p>
				I&rsquo;m generally not of the &#8220;worse is better&#8221; school. I can see the point of the &#8220;worse is better&#8221; crowd &mdash; I&rsquo;m just too worried about what &#8220;worse&#8221; might actually <span class="caps">MEAN </span>to take the chance.
			</p>
			<p>
				Yet there is, I admit, some logic to the theory that, if a large-scale racial reckoning is indeed inevitable &mdash; and I&rsquo;m sure every AmRenner thinks that at <span class="caps">SOME </span>point, <span class="caps">SOME </span>sort of clash will transpire, with or without widespread bloodshed &mdash; then maybe it&rsquo;s better to <span class="caps">GET</span> IT <span class="caps">OVER WITH. </span>&#8220;If it must be done, then &#8216;tis better &#8216;twere done quickly,&#8221; as Shakespeare teaches.
			</p>
			<p>
				Far as I can make out, the only positive outcome of Shoutbamalama becoming president, is that the country might repeat the experience of <span class="caps">NYC </span>in the early &rsquo;90s. Back then, sophisticated, urbane, ultraliberal New Yorkers thought that it would be the sophisticated, urbane, and ultraliberal thing to do to vote for David Dinkins. Turning over the keys to America&rsquo;s #1 city to a benign-appearing elderly colored gent &mdash; whom Jackie Mason hilariously compared to &#8220;a washroom attendant&#8221; and &#8220;a fancy schwartzer in a moustache&#8221; &mdash; seemed like a good idea at the time. But come re-election time &mdash; after the Crown Heights riots (and oh-so-much, <span class="caps">MUCH </span>more), prolonging the pain no longer seemed like such a good idea.
			</p>
			<p>
				The best thing about the Dinkins admin was that it lasted one term only. If elected, Obama, too, is certain to be a one-termer. And maybe &mdash; <span class="caps">MAYBE </span> &mdash; like the white people of <span class="caps">NYC, </span>maybe the white people of America would cure liberals of their mania to be ruled by a black man. You know: get it out of their system. New Yorkers tried it, they didn&rsquo;t like it, they&rsquo;ve never done it since &mdash; and they seem unlikely to do it again. If I could be <span class="caps">GUARANTEED </span>that the same would happen on the national level with Obama, then I might be brought round to the &#8220;worse is better&#8221; argument. But the amount of social damage &mdash; much of it probably irreversible &mdash; that Obama could do during four years, still strikes me as too much of a risk. So I&rsquo;m one of those holding my nose and reluctantly supporting Juan McAmnesty.
			</p>
			<p>
				At any rate, this much is beyond dispute: No presidential election has ever been more about <span class="caps">COLOR </span>than 2008. Obama&rsquo;s white supporters aren&rsquo;t &#8220;colorblind&#8221; &mdash; on the contrary, they are judging him by his color first and foremost. His complexion is the very <span class="caps">REASON </span>they support him. They have been duped into the wishful thinking that a black (or at least <span class="caps">NONWHITE</span>) president would finally bring blacks into the American family. Make them stop committing crime, stop dropping out of school. Make them get off welfare. And generally enable them to (belatedly) achieve their full potential.
			</p>
			<p>
				Needless to say, no such general transformation among African Americans will take place &mdash; either under <span class="caps">BHO </span>or anybody else. It just ain&rsquo;t on their schedule.
			</p>
			<p>
				What self-hating white Obamaniacs don&rsquo;t understand is that &#8220;full potential&#8221; for blacks, well, it just ain&rsquo;t all that full. If blacks truly had the same potential as whites, shouldn&rsquo;t we have seen more of it by now? Putting one of their own in the Oval Office can&rsquo;t make blacks more than what they are. It won&rsquo;t help them.
			</p>
			<p>
				But it sure could hurt the rest of us&hellip; <br />

				I want Obama to be the next President. I want every non-White dirtbag in the country to feel that they&rsquo;ve got a friend in the Brown House, I want every stupid liberal to have to explain why they voted for third world governance. I want the mob to riot when the freebies don&rsquo;t come fast enough. Those who fear a swarm of African immigrants should recall that the <span class="caps">GOP </span>is already importing Somalis and Burundians along with Mexico and China. I want a crisis, I want a collapse. In times of mortal danger, people who know what&rsquo;s going on have the advantage. Our people don&rsquo;t deserve to lose, but they deserve a whipping. Most of us learned from experience what multiculturalism means, not from reading. Whites need more experience, and soon, before we are too few to protect ourselves.

				&#8220;Worse is better&#8221; is gambling the country on voters&rsquo; future discontent with disastrous consequences of incompetent presidency. Are we so desperate that we have to gamble everything we have? What is the bet fails?
			</p>
			<p>
				I see many morons vocally supporting Obama without having one credible reason to believe that he is capable of running the country in direction of prosperity and freedom. I accept this as a result of failed federal and state policies that pay stupid people to have many kids (who aren&rsquo;t any smarter than their parent were). But when those who have some brains begin supporting Obama hoping that his win will open voters&rsquo; eyes on fallacies of liberalism and diversity, I wish I could tell them: &#8220;Are you, guys, nuts?!!!&#8221;.<br />

				Someone, <span class="caps">ANYONE, </span>puleeze explain to me how McCain, detestable as he is, could possibly be worse than the Mulato Messiah, a.i.a. <span class="caps">THE OBAMINATION</span>!
			</p>
			<p>
				Obama is a political newbie. Does <span class="caps">NOT </span>have a grasp on international politics. Does <span class="caps">NOT </span>have any real political leadership experience. <span class="caps">WOULD </span>favor all the negatives &mdash; <span class="caps">AMNESTY </span>and <span class="caps">OPEN BORDERS, </span>just like McCain. Plus Obama would open the doors wide to a flood of African primitives who can&rsquo;t wait to get their free ride, courtesy of the American Taxpayer, a.k.a., <span class="caps">YOU </span>and ME!
			</p>
			<p>
				Obama makes a lot of mileage out of claiming we need to unite &mdash; me, I fail to see a single grain of benefit, &#8220;uniting&#8221; with sociopathic, dysfunctional racial failures known as Afro-Americans or Blacks.

				-Not to punish the race traitors, but to awaken people. It&rsquo;s probably not going to get better until it gets worse - much worse, and it will with Obama as President. Many White Nationalists feel that it is better for Obama to become president than McCain. McCain is another side of the same coin, and the things he does will not contribute to the continuing awakening of White Europeans. Blacks are going to gain in confidence when/if Obama becomes president and they&rsquo;re going to go wild as they usually do when they gain some sort of advantage or perceived advantage over Whites. This will hurt in the short term, but it will be beneficial in the long term. Some people are actually beginning to think that we need an Obama Presidency for this purpose. Thanks.

				Well well, the fact Chuck Baldwin is going to be on the ballot has changed my decision of writing in ron paul, and just voting for him!. All whites should be voting for him to send a ncie clear message to McCain. Though this ofcourse wont be the case and despite the exposed rotten flesh of the sinister Obama campaign, he will be elected. It will help us out regardless.

				An Obama vote punishes the Republicans, gets white kids home from Iraq and may bring race issues to the front page for four years. Elect him and dump your stocks. Its Jimmy Carter all over again.

David Dinkins was so bad New York liberals voted twice for Rudolf Giuliani, a very tough law and order guy who would have been unthinkable as mayor 20 years before. White liberals need a good dose of black incompetency. Obama is their man. Let them have him. Let&rsquo;s give liberalism a friendly shove&hellip;down the stairs!

				I hate to sound like an optimist, but the 2008 election may be the last stand of the hard left in America. Naturally, like most God-fearing conservatives, I would sooner see the left defeated by the leadership of a Ronald Reagan.

				But there&rsquo;s a certain poetic justice in seeing the left tear itself to pieces over what&rsquo;s basically not all that different than a gang turf fight. Find me one principle in the Obama or Hillary campaigns other than &#8220;we&rsquo;re going to run the government and we know what&rsquo;s best for you.&#8221;

				<i> Auster views McCain as a virtual death sentence for conservatism in America.</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				On the other hand, a McCain presidency could cause a serious rift in the Republican party and finally, honest talk about what differentiates neoconservatives and paleoconservatives. It could even cause the Republican party to split up into two opposing camps. In other words, a McCain presidency could be a good thing in its own perverse way. It&rsquo;s impossible to predict the future with any certainty.

			</p>

				To quote Charleton Putnam in <i>Race and Reason</i> &#8220;But I fear you mistake the problem, including the depth of the hypnosis. What we learn from experience depends on how we interpret it.

Surely you realize that Northern riots have been used as an excuse for more appeasement and more White guilt.&#8221;

				I was wondering what the Amren community was saying about the current elections. Its really disappointing to see that after a couple of years away that I return to find the same rhetoric. Its ironic that most (98%) of the people who post on Amren have far more racist attitudes than Rev Right. Well, I have not actually heard any of his comments in full context so I can not really say he is racist, but I have listened to many of your arguments to conclusion. One thing that I hoped many of you would understand is that there is a difference between being proud of your race and cultural heritage, advocating for your community&rsquo;s interests, and being an all out bigot. I challenge you to stop the racism. Among Black socio-political views you will find assimilationist (those happy to be Americans first), pluralist (those that are proud to be Americans and Black), politically charged yet bankrupt (a new term I just coined for you to describe those that see only in Black and White, have no strategy, and are guilty of what you all call race baiting), and finally you have the conscious Black nationalist (those individuals who see themselves as Black first but takes a position based on ideology and interest not race). Contrary to what you may think the later typology is not racist. In fact, he or she is willing to recognize the challenges that are faced in Black communities and works toward real solutions. Historical injustices have to be acknowledge and present wrongs have to be righted. Example, in my daughter&rsquo;s history class there is an entire chapter dedicated to Pres. Andrew Jackson. From the American point of view he carved the position of the presidency bringing power to the executive branch. From an American Indian point of view he was a tyrant that went so far as to ignore a Supreme Court order to honor American treaty rights. He was responsible for the trail of tears that killed countless people. That is fact, no pandering, no baiting. You can&rsquo;t honestly present one side of the story in a history class and think your doing justice to history. In that same class breeze through American Indian history in less than a week and never quite made it to the African American experience. Come on, only a handful of the assimilationist are going to accept that. There are other past and present examples of wrongs that need real advocacy. Many of which have grave consequences on people of color. However, I have never seem the Amren community acknowledge or validate any Black, Hispanic, American Indian interest or concern. I have to tell you we can&rsquo;t live together in peace like that and I have to tell you that I see most of you (98%) as the white version of the Black racially charged and bankrupt.
			</p>

				I believe Obama is probably a pluralist according to my definition. He is in fact the ultimate example of a pluralist and that is the reason he gets White votes. While I believe he is proud to be Black, as a political candidate he is not for Black interest but rather American interests. I think he would be good for the country because he has a mild and humble character that will go along way at home and abroad. At first I was not planning to vote for Obama in fear that too many Black people would be under the false belief that &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve finally made it.&rdquo; If a win for Obama is a win for the nation it speaks nothing of furthering the interests of the Black community. So as a result, I guess I will vote for Obama because I believe him to be the best candidate.

				Is worse today better for whites in the long run? I guess I have mixed feelings on this subject. An Obama presidency could mean terrible and irreversible damage to white interests. The typical WN thinks this will deliver whites to our cause, but I&rsquo;m not so sure. I&rsquo;d like to believe that, but whites are so passive, apathetic, and clueless that I&rsquo;m beginning to think most of us are only fit for slavery or extinction.

				To add insult to injury, Hollywood celebrity Tom Hanks just officially endorsed Obama as have other celebs. Really, would black celebrities line up behind David Duke or Pat Buchanan?

				I don&rsquo;t agree with everything in the Constitution Party platform. But McCain and both of the Democrats are unthinkable, and Paul isn&rsquo;t going to be on the ballot, so Chuck Baldwin it is.
			</p>
			<p>
				An Obama presidency might wake up a few whites, but at the cost of doing irreversible damage to this country (an amnesty for 20 million illegals, which unfortunately Clinton and McCain also favor). Let&rsquo;s face it, most whites can&rsquo;t be woken up.
			</p>
			<p>
				To Tim in Indiana: It&rsquo;s nice to think that a McCain presidency would cause a rift in the Republican party and bring about a split into two parties. But if that was going to happen it would have happened with the disaster of the Bush presidency (there is scarcely any difference between the two). Republicans could have voted for their one real alternative (Paul) but only 9% of them did. The rest voted for men who all promised to be more like Bush than Bush.

				Actually I was engrossed in thought about the strategy of voting for Obama to wake up white people on the loss of power they are experiencing across the board in this nation. I am not talking about the elite whites. They will always have power. I&rsquo;m talking about regular hard working white folks who are discriminated against in almost every area of public life in the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> Then it finally hit me, of course Obama should <span class="caps">NOT </span>be supported. Why? Because the strategy of waking up whites will fail. Whites in this nation will never care about their disempowerment. They have been in general, so dumbed down that having a grass hut with a power line coming into it to the television and a couple dozen of six packs in the fridge is good enough for most of them. In order for people to be shocked into a different better mindset, they have to be aware they are in trouble to beginn with.

				Whites under black rule has worked out well under Mugabe. Maybe the worst is better crowd should have moved there 20yrs ago and witnessed how thats worked for the benifit of whites. The only awakening whites had was understanding that cowering to blacks was the norm for any chance of safety,and giving up all their land and what they had worked for all their lives-many loosing theirs lives. Is worst better when you let a people completely destroy your country when theres nothing left but waste? I guess that would finally be mission accomplished for the worst is better crowd. I personally think these are only excuses for those who wish to stand on the fense because of one thing,&#8221;FEAR&#8221;. McCain would be like voting for Ted the traitor Kennedy. Voting for Hillary would be no different.Voting for Obama would be no different. I&rsquo;ll waste my vote for a true conservative!

				Sandy I think you have to review your math. Don&rsquo;t just make off the cuff statements. Your comments are precisely why a single sided history is wrong. Are you even aware of the atrocities committed by western countries? For example, are you aware that western nations including the United States have promoted instability in developing nations by choosing political sides and arming the side of choice? In a real democracy the people should get to choose their leadership not a foreign government. Secondly, you&rsquo;ve pointed out failure but have completely left out examples of success.<br />
				Stuck in No Mans Land wrote &ldquo;If a white tries to outright say he wants to preserve his heritage, he is perceived as &ldquo;racist&rdquo; off the bat, no matter the circumstances.&rdquo;<br />
				<br />
				Well, this is what the Amren community could be working on addressing. The problem is that many people here appear to be virulent racists who compare human beings to cockroaches and other pests. This doesn&rsquo;t help your case. I think your argument for preserving White culture in places like Switzerland are good because Switzerland is a homogenous society that has never bothered anyone. Since the American Indians have a moral claim on the US and Africans have a moral claim on various African nations, I can not rationalize White people disproportionately controlling resources or single sidedness in these places. If your going to live in the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> I think your going to have to learn to live with us. You can structure your households according to your values and surround yourself with people who are similar to you. No one should tell you who to let in your home or who you should allow your daughter to date. However, white pride has historically translated into white superiority and privilege. That is what I believe is wrong. <br />
				<br />
				I have stuck around and I have processed what many people here have to say. I think listening to the Amren arguments as well as other so called white conservatives has definitely help me avoid the thinking error quagmires of the &ldquo;racially charged but bankrupt.&rdquo; What&rsquo;s unfortunate is I eventually felt as though I was wasting my time because people didn&rsquo;t seem interested in a dialogue, but rather just wanted to cling to the most absurd propositions. <span class="caps">I.E. </span>calling Obama a Muslim when he told you he was a Christian 50 times.

				The problem with the idea of electing Obama, and Democrats in general on the idea that they will scare the nation out of their sleep is that they could and will do great damage to this nation in the time allotted. They will act swiftly to institutionalize opression at all levels. Like a great ratchet, we will lurch to the left, never to return. How long have we been dealing with civil rights laws that were recognized as tyranny when they were passed and were designed to sunset. The sunset dates come and go, and the congress always renews them without hardly any public debate. There is a large contingency in this nation that would like to destroy it as we know it. irresponsibility seems to be the order of the day in Washington. We were promised by the Republicans a great push to get rid of leftist trash in our laws and institutions and shrink the size of the Federal government, and they sat on their thumbs the whole time. About all you can say is that they reformed welfare. But then if that&rsquo;s so, then what was going on in New Orleans during and after Hurricane Katrina? Wasn&rsquo;t what happened there a result of a still firmly entrenched welfare class? Mc Cain sent me an Email. He says he will appoint constructionist (honest) judges. But then he also said that he learned his lesson on amnesty. Yet, now he seems to be going back to his old position. Why wouldn&rsquo;t he? It&rsquo;s <span class="caps">HIS </span>issue. Will he appoint constructionist judges? Who knows? But we do know that Hillary and Obama won&rsquo;t. Many policies stand on the rulings of judicial activist judges, and as such are dishonest in nature. A lot of bad law could be unraveled if the right (honest) judges were to be put in place. Democrats know this and are trying (quite sucessfully) to stall judicial appointments until they can get their corrupt people in place. Remember when the Republicans threatened to rewrite the senate rules when the dems were blocking the senate confirmation process for judges? They should have just done it. But they just didn&rsquo;t have the &#8216;nads. Now they don&rsquo;t have the power. I will probably support Mc Cain, but with the understanding that either way, we&rsquo;re boned. The best thing that could happen is if the delegates at the Republican convention overthrew Mc Cain and put in someone who is a real constitutionalist. But in order for that to happen, Mc Cain would have to be caught doing something really bad with a goat or something. Not likely to happen. Like I said, we&rsquo;re boned.

				I believe two things fairly confidently: whoever is elected in November will preside over the most serious economic depression in the country&rsquo;s history and that there will be a racial conflict of <span class="caps">CWII </span>proportions within the next 10-20 years.
			</p>
			<p>
				Given this background, an Obama victory could be a &#8220;good&#8221; thing because he will be blamed for the economic depression (one which is likely to make the depression of the 30&rsquo;s look mild) and will be clearly identified with black racial interests on a national scale. Obama truly hates whites in a visceral sense and his administration will surely alienate them en mass by pushing the racial spoils system to the limit at a time of scarce resources. Obama, although he will try, is less likely to succeed at direct attacks at white culture such as banning the Confederate flag than <span class="caps">RINO&rsquo;</span>s such a McCain or even Marxists like Hilary.
			</p>
			<p>
				Hillary will be more of the same leftist garbage &mdash; open borders, extension of the welfare state, more taxes, class warfare, and what has become typical elitist corruption. McCain wil go out of his way to prove that he is not a bad racist and in doing so may well do more damage to whites than even Obama is capable of. His administration will be full of minorities and he will continue the war in Iraq with its resultant drain on the treasury and on American lives (mostly white). In effect he will be all that is bad about the current Bush mixed with a political outlook (excluding the war) of Nancy Pellosi. He will permanently destroy what is left of the Republican party (admittedly they is little left).
			</p>
			<p>
				Clearly Ron Paul would be the best of all possible worlds in the sense that he is the only hope of returning America to its founding principles and of maintaining its identity as a Western nation. He will not be on the ticket, however, so we are left with a meaningless write in, not voting or voting for one of the three major candidates. Obama is looking better and better all the time for reasons he will never understand.
			</p>
			<p>
				I personally detest Obama for all that he is and stands for, but I can understand how worse may well be better &mdash; if there is to be ethnic warfare in the <span class="caps">US, </span>the sooner it starts the better off whites will be, not only because the number of hispanics will only grow with time but also because the military will only become increasingly minority as well. We need the military with its heavy weapons to be predominantly on our side. Would you rather fight with 67% of the population white or with 51% white? Time is running out and Obama may well serve as the catalyst, together with the imminent economic depression, in sparking a real revolution. He may unintentionally be the savior of the white race in America. We will see.

McCain will continue the neocon practice of selling domestic liberalism, Wilsonian internationalism and corporate globalism as true conservatism and the majority of <span class="caps">GOP </span>voters will fall into line as they have in the past. A McCain defeat will be a defeat for the neocons-and <i>that</i> is necessary.

				There are reasons for supporting Obama over McCain that go beyond &#8216;worse is better.&rsquo; If McCain gets elected, he will quickly cut a bipartisan deal to amnesty the 20 million or so illegal immigrants. And many Republican senators and congressmen will go along because he&rsquo;s a &#8216;fellow&rsquo; Republican.
			</p>
			<p>
				If Obama gets elected, he will be much more constrained on the amnesty issue. Republican senators and congressmen will be much less likely to go along simply because he&rsquo;s a Democrat.
			</p>
			<p>
				Obama would also raise the minimum wage and enforce it. That, in itself, would eliminate one of the main incentives for employers to hire illegals.
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally, Obama would be president at a time when the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>is going into a recession. He would (unfairly) get the blame and very quickly become a lameduck president. In two years time, conditions would be ripe for the Republicans to take control of both the Senate and Congress.

				I will write in a candidate for <span class="caps">POTUS </span>(Tancredo/Hunter) or I will vote Constituion Party (Baldwin is dead set against amnesty). Most likely Constitution party since a strong showing by a 3rd party would validate the need for a conservative party (the <span class="caps">GOP </span>lost that tag long ago).
			</p>
			<p>
				I will not support mcamnesty. My reason? If mcamnesty gets elected, he will be the defacto Repub candidate in 2012 (if he is still alive). So we either get 8 years of liberal mcamnesty trying to ram amensty down our throats and calling us biggots if we oppose, validate the <span class="caps">GOP </span>drift leftward on issues, or we get a socialst democrat in 2012. Either way we will get hosed. If mcamnesty does not win the election in 2008, we will have a socialist lib to deal with for 4 years, but we would have the chance to put a real conservative up for the 2012 election (if the <span class="caps">GOP </span>wises up, which I doubt) or that will be more time for real conservative 3rd party to arise. Just my take on things. Supporting a 2 party system that is either socialist (dems) or left of center (GOP) is no longer palateable for me.

				&#8220;Far as I can make out, the only positive outcome of Shoutbamalama becoming president, is that the country might repeat the experience of <span class="caps">NYC </span>in the early &rsquo;90s. Back then, sophisticated, urbane, ultraliberal New Yorkers thought that it would be the sophisticated, urbane, and ultraliberal thing to do to vote for David Dinkins. Turning over the keys to America&rsquo;s #1 city to a benign-appearing elderly colored gent &mdash; whom Jackie Mason hilariously compared to &ldquo;a washroom attendant&rdquo; and &ldquo;a fancy schwartzer in a moustache&rdquo; &mdash; seemed like a good idea at the time.

			</p>
			<p>
				Same thing happened in Minneapolis in the mid-90s with Sharon Sayles Belton. She was a total disaster. Black crime exploded and the city became known a Murderapolis. Minneapolis voters went back to a white man after Belton. He&rsquo;s a liberal and black crime is still a problem (isn&rsquo;t it always) but it has been contained.

				Just who has made this argument? I don&rsquo;t recall anyone comparing blacks to cockroaches or vermin. We are an open forum, and allow most reasonable and non obscene or invective laced postings.

You are obviously creating a &#8220;straw man&#8221; opponent to knock down with such disingenuous criticisms.

				Are you a Native American? Do you believe in blood guilt and the sins of the fathers visited on the children?

				Yours are the same arguments many blacks use for handouts/affirmative action citing racism and the legacy of slavery. I&rsquo;m sorry as someone who has never owned a slave; I don&rsquo;t owe anything to someone who never was a slave. I feel the same way about Native Americans, I never fought them or killed them, I personally owe them nothing as a group. <br />

				We are well aware of the &#8220;atrocities&#8221; committed by western nations, they&rsquo;re only thrown in the publics face every chance possible, and its the fact you are so assertive on focusing on that that leads to blindness.
			</p>
			<p>
				Western countries are far from the only ones committing atrocities, you addressed sandy as needing to do her math, but she did bring up points you never really refuted, in fact, all you did to &#8220;refute&#8221; was point out &#8220;well western countries do bad things too!&#8221; something we hear endlessly about to begin with, so lets venture into her argument that you never thought to really do anything about.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is true there is unparalleled rape and murder in these african nations, do you actually contend the <span class="caps">US&rsquo;</span>s rates are anywhere near their own? if so, i ask politely to stop living under that rock.
			</p>
			<p>
				Zimbabwe, South Africa, etc. All black owned, are rife with murder rape and disease. These same nations, were doing at least moderately well under white rule, with these very same problems at lower rates. Does this mean i advocate whites ruling these nations? personally, no i do not. what i do advocate however is these black nations taking responsibility for their own blunders. Just like &#8220;whitey&#8221; is always racist, he also seems to be always to blame for anything, no matter if hes there or not. This is racial reality, that they screwed things up for themselves, yet in the heavily politically correct world we live in, the blame is shifted to whites, where it stays because of white guilt, false or not.
			</p>
			<p>
				Onto my next point, you believe the American Indians have a right to this land, Alright then, let me ask you, what is your opinion on Reconquista? If the land is yours, and the Mexicans believe it is their own, then whose right here? Or is it perhaps you think its for everyone except &#8220;evil whitey&#8221;, in some false rainbow coalition?
			</p>
			<p>
				Now onto this historical &#8220;white pride&#8221; privilege. Here we meet our conflict, here in Amren, we believe in racial reality, the concept that down to the genes, races tend to be different. You need only scroll up the list of articles on the homepage, to see one pertaining to this. what you view as &#8220;privilege&#8221; has often nothing to do with such a thing. If a certain race commits more crimes per their proportion than another, then it isn&rsquo;t &#8220;whitey&#8221; &#8216;s inane &#8220;privilege&#8221;, its simply a fact of life. (One among many pieces of evidence here: https://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/homicide/race.htm )
			</p>
			<p>
				Crime wise, there is no such thing. Now if you are speaking socially, whites preferring whites. Than you are a hypocrite.<br />
				You obviously prefer fellow American Indians to others no? blacks sure do with other blacks, and so on. So you can cut the &#8220;its evil&#8221; malarkey, thats part of the very double standard we are here to end, the very one you knowingly or unknowingly support, and that my friend, is part of the true problem in this society.
			</p>
			<p>
				You speak of &#8220;no one up for a dialogue&#8221;, but in truth, we are, its what we are doing now. But we cannot be blamed if you dismiss truth as &#8220;racist&#8221; then proclaim we &#8220;don&rsquo;t listen&#8221; when we don&rsquo;t believe in false doctrine that on this forum has been exposed dozens of times.

				There is nothing wrong with our will to preserve ourselves, and if defending that is &#8220;evil&#8221; than i suppose i am.

				You pull a gun on a would-be assailant, you have to be committed to using it. You have a story thought out well in advance: You were accosted, in mortal fear of your life by the thug(s). You shot believing it was the <span class="caps">ONLY WAY </span>to save your own life (or loved one). The anti-gun mentality you&rsquo;re pushing is made to order for the bad guys in our society.

				I&rsquo;ve never pulled any of my weapons on anyone, and would be mightily happy to live out the rest of my days without doing so. But you&rsquo;re right about one thing: should the unthinkable ever occur, and one is forced to defend self or family or home, you only draw the weapon if you mean to kill the target. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I figure your post was probably more of a statement against firearm ownership in general. But I guess even a broken watch is right twice a day.

You&rsquo;d have done better to point to Stalin&rsquo;s Russia as an example of mass murder and oppression under white rule, but even that would be debatable when you look at the persistent state of so much of Africa and indeed black-controlled areas all over the world. As to whether the same would exist here under Obama, I doubt it, given the overall make-up of the nation as a whole.

				There have been <span class="caps">MANY </span>things which &#8220;should&rsquo;ve&#8221; woken us up- Affirmative Action, Immigration reforms of the 60s, Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, OJ Simpson, 9/11, Jena 6, White Flight, Zimbabwe, South Africa,&hellip; the list goes on and on. Yet none of them seem to have done it. I don&rsquo;t particularly agree with this Rocky Balboa strategy of &#8220;lets win by letting them beat up even more on us&#8221;. Only works in the movies. I think much of white America is already awake, but is robbed of being able to collectively bargain or question the progressive ideology, because to do so labels them a racist (regardless of whether or not they are actually saying something bad about another race, or defending themselves against real racism), and they can lose their jobs or suffer other consequences. This won&rsquo;t change regardless of who the president is.
			</p>
			<p>
				I don&rsquo;t believe for one second that even if there was a black president, that minorities would stop whining that they are not receiving equal opportunity because they are not achieving as much. There have been plenty of black mayors, governors, other blacks put into positions of prominence and power (probably because of whites who bought into the Kumbayah nonsense), and nothing has changed. Most blacks still cannot achieve on merit, and still will not be able to in the future, so the need to blame whites and receive privileges will still be there. They also increasing are &#8220;justifying&#8221; things like Affirmative Action on a reparations-based ideology - making up for &#8220;past injustices&#8221; (never mind of course the role of blacks in slavery).

				One commenter above pointed out the problem of Supreme Court Packing.

				Of course, some have recognized this almost from the beginning of hte Obama campaign. I noted some time back that if Obama wins, there will be celebratory riots, if he loses, there will be riots by those feeling the system conspired to defeat the first black president due to his race. I may have been using irony to illustrate the point, but now it is being articulated in full, as in this article. Whatever happens for years into the future, it is going to be a wild ride.

				McCain will go out of his way to prove he is not a racist and in doing so may well do more damage to whites than even Obama is capable of [doing]. His administration will be full of minorities, and he will continue the war in Iraq with its resultant drain on the treasury and on American lives (mostly white)&hellip;. he will be all that is bad about Bush, mixed &hellip;with Nancy Pellosi. He will permanently destroy what is left of the Republican party&hellip; so we are left with a meaningless write in, not voting, or voting for one of the major three . <br />
				Time is running out, and Obama may well serve as the catalyst,&hellip; in sparking a real revolution. He may unintentionally be the savior of the white race in America.<br />

				It seems that you want to just exterminate white people. Maybe not outright but by telling us that we cannot preserve our culture and heritage and have to give up land that we fought and bled for. The Native Americans have their place and many of them do very well. I grew up in Oklahoma and that state is pretty much run by native Americans and some of the richest people that live there are Native American and they take care of their own. Europe would not be able to absorb all the White people if we were kicked out of the North American continent. I for one would fight to the death to prevent that from happening. If Obama is elected I am sure that he would implement laws that could turn this country into Zimbabwe pretty quickly. I would not be surprised if slavery reparations were implemented too.

You&rsquo;re looking at it as merely an either/or situation (is he or isn&rsquo;t he?), when it&rsquo;s considerably more nuanced. No matter what Obama claims to be now, he began life as a Moslem. I think that many people&rsquo;s concern is that he will still identify with Moslems. (And he has even said that he will.) The fact remains that he had a Moslem father, and a Moslem step-father, and went to a Moslem school, had Moslem training, and has Moslem relatives. Whether he is presently a practicing Moslem is therefore somewhat irrelevant.
			</p>
			<p>
				As for his supposed &#8220;Christianity&#8221;, his affiliation with that Black-Marxist church (the largest in Chicago, I understand), seems designed to ingratiate himself with Chicago&rsquo;s black electorate and win votes, and is an obviously shrewd political alliance &mdash; which has paid off handsomely.
			</p>
			<p>
				A further concern which people have is that, according to Islamic law, there is no such thing as a former Moslem. Once a Moslem always a Moslem &mdash; no matter what he may say otherwise, whether it&rsquo;s for convenience or whether it&rsquo;s true. They are also permitted to lie about it for the purpose of furthering Islam. Should people not be concerned? If he were truly an apostate from Islam, the Moslems would screaming with rage and would have a fatwa on his head. The curious fact that they do not, and that they are murmuring not a whimper against him, seems to say something, which makes many people uneasy.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thus, the question of whether he is presently a Moslem is somewhat irrelevant. The real question is with whom he identifies and where his sympathies lie.

				&#8220;You pull a gun on a would-be assailant, you have to be committed to using it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Fed up, if you&rsquo;ll re-read my post, this is exactly what I said. You do not pull a gun on a ghetto-dweller to scare him. There&rsquo;s a good chance he will not be totally scared. This leads to scuffles and you may loose the gun. A gun is a deterrent to a drunk white guy outside of a bar, but you don&rsquo;t pull a gun on a hardened ghetto criminal without emptying the clip. Period.

				As far as Obama is concerned; It is still the US congress that makes and ratifies laws in this country. I read all of this mania about reparations and African Aid and giving the country away to the blacks, but that is plain hysteria with roughly 500 of 535 members of congress being white. Obama is a somewhat marginal small-time politician without the connections of the Bush crime family. He would be in ineffective yet <span class="caps">FAR </span>less harmful president then Bush, Clinton, or even McAmnesty.

				Look at Obama&rsquo;s dismal support in the primaries. Only a third of White Democrats cast a vote for him. He&rsquo;s able to win big in Southern states because 50% or more of Democrats are black in these states! If you were a part of the liberal establishment and sensed possibly the biggest defeat since the Carter re-election fiasco, wouldn&rsquo;t you spread the &#8220;worse is better&#8221; idea to get out the vote?

				You have to look at who is behind Obama. He is going to be the figure head but they are the ones pulling the strings. The same goes with McCain and Hillary&hellip;who is giving them money&hellip;who are their advisors. Obama is less likely at least to get us in a war with Iran then McCain. They all are in favor of illegal immigration. It is up to the people to stop that.

Wakeing-up white people about anything is most difficult with the mainstream media in enemy hands, and they will surely spin Obama as the new &#8216;black&rsquo; <span class="caps">J.F.K. </span>in a new, misty-eyed colored Camelot. McCain is also the kiss-of-death for whites, so vote your conscience, and vote for Chuck Baldwin.

				Absolutely! But, I have to say this&hellip;.
			</p>
			<p>
				For example, I come from a large family. Big Irish Catholic Clan; and though I am the <span class="caps">ONLY </span>one who is openly White (that sounds funny ;) by sisters have all married Irish Catholics, none of them every even considered dating anyone other than a White man. Thank god.
			</p>
			<p>
				My brother and I were both going out with Asian women (by total conincidence). And one day I realized, as she and I were getting very serious, that if I was going to have a child I would want one that was White. I never really thought of it as much as I did during that time. So I told her. She cried and I definitely did not feel good about hurting her feelings. I still care for her and am happy that she is doing well today. But, I have to add this. She never <span class="caps">ONCE </span>brought up the word &#8220;racism&#8221;. And her mother spoke to me shortly after and said she was sad that her daughter and I had broken up, but she got it completely. They were Japanese after all, and they have no problem identifying with a decision like the one I had to make. But since then I have never given the idea of a mixed race child another thought. Whereas my brother already has a son from his marriage. In that case, I would not want to interfere because though I think it&rsquo;s important to be racially aware I think that the freedom to choose is even more important.

				to realist: first they have to find me in order to use their helicopters and tanks; a pistol in the basement is not what I intend to be armed with in any case; following your logic, the sheep should behave themselves on the way to the slaughter house; it does not take a large segment of the population, well armed(which does not mean tanks or helicopters), to paralyze a conventional military with advanced technology; defeatism is not a strategy and failure is not an option.

				If you&rsquo;ve ever visited any of the pro Hillary internet forums, you&rsquo;ll see a lot of whites who have just recently become racially conscious. It started with some of Obama&rsquo;s campaign tactics and then hit hard with Rev. Wright. I can imagine some of those posters finding their way to AmRen. These are people who until very recently were liberals with liberal views on race. They wanted blacks and whites to get along and be friends. But Obama&rsquo;s candidacy, with help from the mainstream media, has deeply disillusioned them.

				&#8220;Americans would make what the insurgents are doing in Iraq look like kid&rsquo;s play. Remember, Americans have already engaged in armed violence to secure an election post-World War <span class="caps">II, </span>the celebrated &ldquo;Battle of Athens.&rdquo; &#8220;<br />

				Well, good luck to you with that stash of ammo in your basement. I mean that sincerely. Really! I am on your side. But I remain a skeptic.

				There may be a few determined resisters like you. But how many? The great mass of the American sheeple - despite all the discrimination, and crime, and provocation they have endured, for half a century now - thus far have shown absolutely NO inclination to resistance. They gripe to the neighbors and write letters to the editor, nothing more. They don&rsquo;t even take action at the ballot box! They continue to elect the same traitors to office.

				Furthermore, the forces of the Fed. govt. do not have to ferret out and destroy <span class="caps">ALL </span>of you (even assuming there were many). They would make an example of a few (eg. Waco), broadcast that on national television (as they did with Waco), and let that be a lesson to the rest. Most of the rest would cave right in.

				&lsquo;An Obama presidency could be dangerous. What if someone shoots him?&rsquo;
			</p>
			<p>
				Good God, this would be the worst possible outcome. Do you want to create another national martyr? &hellip;. if Senator Obama is elected, let him serve as president in peace. I think with the problems we face and his solutions, he will only serve one term.<br />

				You&rsquo;ve misread him, I&rsquo;m sure. I don&rsquo;t think he &#8220;wants&#8221; any such thing. I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s in any way <span class="caps">SUGGESTING </span>that. He&rsquo;s just presenting it as a scary possibility. If such a thing were to happen, the country would see black riots such as nothing we&rsquo;ve ever seen before.

				[Obama] is inexperienced and probably quite naive, politically speaking. <br />
				Trust Obama with our foreign policy? He&rsquo;d make a bigger mess of it than our Village Idiot did &mdash; although the Village Idiot had <span class="caps">HIS </span>strings pulled by another country, a supposed ally of ours.<br />

				I wonder how the string-pullers will manipulate Obama. As you say, he is inexperienced and naive. That is all to their benefit. Apparently they expect to have no problem with him, as he would not have gotten this far without their tacit approval.

				<i>&ldquo;I would not want to interfere because though I think it&rsquo;s important to be racially aware I think that the freedom to choose is even more important.&rdquo; </i>
			</p>

				Freedom to choose fair enough, but only as long as it doesn&rsquo;t adversely affect the existence of others like the genetic survival and social well-being of a whole race of people, ie, one&rsquo;s own ethnic kin<br />

				I am very strongly in favor of protecting personal freedoms. But as the Greeks said, &#8220;All things in moderation.&#8221; While I agreed initially with Dedalus&rsquo; position on preserving freedom, I have to agree even more with Swain&rsquo;s position on preserving the race.

				I must say that I am disgusted by some of the logic being used here and some of the reasons given in this article on why white nationalists want to support Obama. What is Jared Taylor doing praising Obama&rsquo;s campaign strategy? What is there to praise?
			</p>
			<p>
				I am also not happy with the excuse dealing with the war. I sympathize with some white nationalist arguments against the war, such as &#8220;we should be protecting our own border&#8221;. I sympathize with that sort of statement fully actually. What I don&rsquo;t understand is why so many in this movement are so quick to side with the liberals on this issue as if they are our comrades.
			</p>
			<p>
				You guys don&rsquo;t seem to understand that the liberals are against the war for the most vile reasons such as &#8220;whites are evil imperialists who cause destruction wherever they go&#8221;. They are <span class="caps">NOT </span>against the war for the same reasons many of you are. They DO <span class="caps">NOT </span>have your interests at heart.
			</p>
			<p>
				If it was an intelligent white male liberal running saying that we need to put the troops on our own border, then I could fully understand the reasoning here. But why support a corrupt and incompetent black man who doesn&rsquo;t know anything about foreign policy just because you are against the war?
			</p>
			<p>
				Sometimes the rational used on this website doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me. I <span class="caps">WON&rsquo;T </span>be voting for Obama, and I am proud to say that. I guess many of you on this website feel that it is best to chop your entire arm off just because one of your fingers aren&rsquo;t functioning properly.

				I like this post browser, because it touches on a lot. But since we can&rsquo;t get into &#8220;a lot&#8221; in a post, I&rsquo;ll just mention what I think is important to keep in mind.
			</p>
			<p>
				First, I was speaking for myself, not for anyone else. Second, though I do agree with you in part, my commitment is not so much with Whites, or with Freedom, my number one commitment is to Reality. And the reality of our, and I think everyones, situation, is filled with some unpleasant facts. And those facts <span class="caps">MUST </span>be faced SO we can preserve our Freedoms, our Peoples, whoever they may be, etc.
			</p>
			<p>
				I will make a personal statement to help illustrate my point. <br />
				I am one of many children fathered by a man who apparently exhausted all of his courage fighting the Japanese in World War <span class="caps">II. </span> He was decorated for his bravery, but when he came home, &#8220;Class of 46&#8221; as they were called, he proceeded to act out the symptoms, not only of <span class="caps">PTSD, </span>but also, of what he experienced before leaving for Japan, while growing up, ie; Multi-Generational Abuse and Neglect. There was NO langauge for either that or the <span class="caps">PTSD, </span>and since life is impossible without explanation, a shamefully neglected Intellectual and Cultural point I plan to base my website on, the lack of explanation, or its complete absence, only added to the trauma. <br />
				<br />
				So, you have Physical, Intellectual, Psychological, Emotional, Social, and Spiritual trauma of the first rank, that is operating like an undiagnosed disease ripping at the core of our collective psyches and tearing the fabric of White society and everything Whites, Jewish or Gentile, control. The case with my father ended with him abandoning a house full of children and not contacting us again until 30 years later and to utter a &ldquo;on his way out the door&rdquo; apology before dying. He lived the life of an irresponsible coward. And, as any honest White person knows, my father is one of literally, and we know this, <span class="caps">MILLIONS</span>!!!!!
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="caps">AND YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT GROUP SOLIDARITY</span>!!!!!!
			</p>
			<p>
				How, when you fail to take the above in to account?
			</p>
			<p>
				How far do you expect to get?
			</p>
			<p>
				Are you even being serious, or sincere?<br />
				Also, if there is anyone who wants to fire off a cheap shot at my personal experience, go ahead. You will only prove me point! The people who visit and comment here and talk about group solidarity are <span class="caps">DELUSIONAL, </span>they are certainly wasting their time. Plus, there are plenty of people from all walks of life who have been screwed over – BY <span class="caps">THEIR OWN</span>! They too are finding it hard to be &ldquo;loyal&rdquo;. But the <span class="caps">MSM </span>is not interested in them. But then, neither are you guys, or most of you!<br />
				<br />
				The theme of Violation runs through a huge part of <span class="caps">OUR</span> History, Violation of Ourselves, of our sons and daughters and brothers and sisters. The quantity and quality of information we have is overwhelming, but it is also gathering dust for the most part and that should be a burded on the conscience of <span class="caps">ALL</span> Whites and Westerners of the Judeo-Christian-Secular-Humanist Tradition. That it isn&rsquo;t speaks to the absolute <span class="caps">CORE </span>of our problem. For every second you ignore this you are wasting your life; but to ignore it and then wax philosphic about Solidarity is to whistle in the wind blowing through the window of your room in an Insane Asylum.
