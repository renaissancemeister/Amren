						<p>Britain&rsquo;s Home Office tightened visa regulations for skilled workers Tuesday, forcing employers to prove they had no option before hiring a foreigner.</p>
<p>The change is part of a full overhaul of Britain&rsquo;s immigration system that will impact students, workers and temporary visitors and that is meant to make the process of choosing whom is allowed into the country more selective. It is modeled on Australia&rsquo;s strict point system for granting visas.</p>
<p>Under the new rules, potential workers will be evaluated based on their age and their ability to speak English, and the amount of money they earn. Potential migrants earning more than $48,000 would have a simpler time than those earning less.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The new regulations are part of government attempts to limit levels of immigration and will affect thousands of computer programmers, lab technicians, midwives and other skilled laborers that come to work in Britain annually. Another set of rules that covers students and temporary workers will be announced later in the year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The new rules will not affect the movement of people from within the European Union, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.<br>

					<p>I&rsquo;ve long admired the British and am happy to see they are finally coming to their senses on immigration. Prior to these rulings they were much too lenient and seemed to think, like the <span class="caps">U.S., </span>that welcoming the cast offs and lower classes of the third world would &#8220;enrich&#8221; them. So I hope the British mean what they say. The downside of course probably means more immigration of undesirables to America, where the ruling elites, led by the traitor in chief support any policy that destroys traditional America, especially immigration, almost exclusivelly of non whites.</p>

					<p>I&rsquo;ve got one small additional rule they should add: a $35,000 fee for bringing in said person. If you really need the person  that badly; if his skill is really that rare, then a $35,000 annual fee isn&rsquo;t too much too ask, is it?</p>

					<p>Funny how this was trumpeted a few days after New Labour were destroyed at the local elections.<br>
Well, its shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted.Since gaining office in 1997, New Labour has worked hard and consistently at dismantling all remaining immigration controls - leading to a very sharp increse in immigration.Former Home Secretary David Blunkett (the most worthlesly useless British cabinet minister of all time), enthused &#8220;There is no upward limit to immigration&#8221;.</p>

					<p>How about a total ban on visitors and immigrants from the countries in the Middle East that harbor millions of Western-hating angry religious fanatics?</p>

					<p><i>The new rules will not affect the movement of people from within the European Union, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland<i></i></i></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the rub. The third worlders only have to reach Spain, Italy or an EU Eastern European country, once established there, as a &#8216;refugee&rsquo; or resident, they can then move to Britain.  I have a feeling that they may be able to move directly to Britain, resident or not, perhaps someone else knows.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s too late as far as this applies to Islamists in Britain, the 5th column is already established there - and much of Europe too. The only answer is to expel them; we cannot rely on a loyalty oath because of the doctrine of Taquiya. Humane deportation and the establishment of laws that will establish Islam as a hostile, violent and evil ideology, the practice of which will result in deportation for its practitioners and their extended families is the only way to resolve this mess. It&rsquo;s harsh, and I never thought I would think this way, but is permitting my country and people to become subject to an evil ideology any less harsh?<br>
But what a sorry situation, that we have no alternative but to think this way. Are the Left proud of the legacy they have left the world I wonder? When they see the misery and wreckage of entire nations, do they even recognize what they&rsquo;ve done in their quest for power? <br><br>
Arc. <br><br>
