						<p>Florida is not as popular as it used to be among whites who are not Hispanic, according to a U.S. Census Bureau report released today.</p>
<p>As recently as 2005 the state held the No. 1 spot for growth among non-Hispanic whites, but today&rsquo;s report shows a major shift to the 29th spot.</p>
<p>In the one-year period between July 2006 and June 2007, the growth in the number of non-Hispanic whites came to a standstill, increasing a mere 4,833 people, the census reported.</p>
<p>The growth was a fraction of the 124,000 increase in the same group reported two years earlier.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s certainly true that the non-Hispanic white population in Florida is declining and will continue to decline,&#8221; said Stan Smith, director of the Bureau of Economic Business Research at the University of Florida.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Broward County&rsquo;s population became &#8220;majority minority&#8221; in 2005. Minorities now make up slightly more than half the population.</p>
<p>Palm Beach County is slightly more than one-third minority.</p>
<p>Mary Raynor said the makeup of her East Miramar neighborhood has changed dramatically in the 50 years that she&rsquo;s lived there.</p>
<p>&#8220;It used to be all white,&#8221; said Raynor, who lives in an enclave that was once mostly Italian. &#8220;Now, more than half of the people here are Hispanic or from the Caribbean.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Boca Raton, Realtor Barry Rothman said more people of color are inquiring about homes in neighborhoods they rarely asked about years ago.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At a time when the growth in the number of non-Hispanic whites has stalled, the state&rsquo;s minority population continues to rise.</p>
<p>Latest figures show Florida had the third-highest increase in Hispanics between 2006 and 2007. The Hispanic population grew by about 131,000, with only Texas and California drawing higher numbers.</p>
<p>Florida&rsquo;s black population increased as well, growing 43,000. It is third behind Texas. Georgia ranked highest.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a lot more complex than the idea of white flight,&#8221; said Richard Ogburn, with the South Florida Regional Planning Council.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>With some Baby Boomers on the cusp of retirement, Florida could once again regain popularity. But the state faces competition among retirees from other countries and southern states that offer a warm climate and lower cost of living.</p>

<p>Unlikely.  Retirees don&rsquo;t wan&rsquo;t to live around diversity either.  Ex-Floridian here from Lake County now living in East TN.  I got a job in Orlando about 4 years ago but coming from homogenous small town America, I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to move there and instead moved 50 miles north to Leesburg.  The commute was h*ll.  I previously had lived in Orlando in the late 80&rsquo;s and early 90s and it has changed tremendously. Way more blacks and Puerto Ricans and Colonial Dr has turned into a little Asia town with Buddha statues, foreign flags and Chinese lettering.  The traffic congestion is horrendous and getting home took about an hour.  Leesburg used to be a little rural hole in the wall 20 years ago.  Now, people are escaping Orlando to move there, including minorities.  Before I left in 2004, I read in the paper there were plans on building an expressway to Lake County from Orlando to make the commute easier.  My parents lived for 15 years in Ocala which is 75 miles from Orlando and they moved to Asheville NC because of the demographic changes going on there. </p>
<p>Bottom line is the state is not the laid back relaxed place it used to be mostly because of the foreign population growth.  They might still get a few White New Yorkers or New Jersians but I&rsquo;d say forget about any White Southerners moving down there because the state is going the way of California.  </p>

			<p>We should not look too closely at just 1 year&rsquo;s worth of data.  It would be more meaningful to compare 2007 with 2000, not with 2006.  Anything could cause a temporary hiccup in population change, like a hurricane.  </p>
<p>We should be more concerned with long-term change.  The bottom line is that South Florida in general has been losing its white population.  Time will tell whether the entire state as a whole will continue to have a net growth in its white population.  There is still substantial white growth in several mid-size counties around the state.</p>

			<p>Georgia has been discovered as a pleasant alternative to Florida, and many whites are evacuating for their neighbor to the north.  Unfortunately, blacks from the upper right hand portion of the country and from the west coast are also headed to Georgia, so it appears the state is going to have to make room for some people it would just as soon not have.  </p>

<p>Whites have literally inundated this area and were responsible for driving up the housing prices more than the real estate bubble.</p>

			<p>My wife and I moved our family out of Ft. Lauderdale ten years ago because we could not afford to send our children to private schools. After the sixth grade, to send a white child to Broward County schools was death. That was a decade ago. It is much worse now. Remember, always pay attention to school demographics. That is the future.</p>
<p>For example, where I live now is 90% white.</p>
<p>But the schools are 40% non-white.</p>
<p>What are the demographics a generation from now?</p>

			<p>If you&rsquo;e a white person moving to Florida or California (or to a whole lot of leftist run cities) you might as well arrive wearing a shirt saying &#8220;Mug me, I&rsquo;m white.&#8221; The politicians of those locales look at you as nothing but a bottomless kitty to raid to feed their piranha-like constituents. And you better have a gun-permit, because their police departments will be in no hurry to come to your aid.</p>

<p>Head north. Most of the savagery that threatens civilization doesn&rsquo;t do well in the cold. Try Maine, North/South Dakota, Idaho, Montana and the like. Taxes aren&rsquo;t too bad in most of these states as well. Good luck!</p>

			<p>Lydia, if you find that place, please let me know. How truly sad that we are being run out of our homes and schools. When it finally wakes up, our government will be shocked to find out that illegals certainly can&rsquo;t pay the taxes that keep our politicians in the style to which they&rsquo;ve become accustomed.</p>

			<p>   This demographic onslaught represents the death of our civilization.Don&rsquo;t we love our children anymore? We are leaving them a third world nation in which to live. Do you think they will be treated well? I don&rsquo;t. We must start by breaking the media&rsquo;s stranglehood over our public discourse. They are poisoning the well. Break the media or they will break us.</p>

			<p>I live in northern Florida and I can tell you it is the cheap place to retire to from years ago.  Crime is escalating (what else is new when you don&rsquo;t punish people properly) and the services are on the decline.  There is lots of fraud - especially with the elderly (which by the way, the State of Florida does not pursue).  You see poor hygiene in a restaurant and the health department won&rsquo;t even send an inspector (I&rsquo;ve gone through it first hand).  A company rips you off and there is no agency to assist you.  These are probably some of the reasons but we all know the Hispanic population to the south is exploding (and not the better kind of Hispanic like white Cubans or white South Americans).  And, the Haitians are bringing Port Au Prince here!</p>

			<p>Lydia and June, let me add my cry to yours.  I&rsquo;m stuck in Mexifornia, but don&rsquo;t know where to move.  It seems the invasion is everywhere now.  The only people who can live in majority white neighborhoods now are whites with lots of money, (or Obama&rsquo;s pastor!)</p>

<p>You live in the northern part of the state?  As a former long time resident I can testify that the changes in the population have been dramatic.  Alot of the hispanics are ok but there&rsquo;s a large number of swarthy looking characters out there.  The black population, like the article said, has grown quite a bit in the past decade.  The biggest problem areas were in South Florida and people were evacuating those areas and heading into the central part of the state where I lived. I believe the person that bought my house was either from Palm Beach or Fort Lauderdale.  Now that Central Florida is going to pot, I&rsquo;d like to know where they&rsquo;re going now.  Probably out of state like I did. </p>

			<p>Lydia,</p>
<p>If you can take the cold, North Dakota is where you want to be.  I have many relatives there and visiting them is like taking a time machine back to the 1950&rsquo;s in terms of demographics and family values.  </p>
<p>North Dakota the only state in America where I would send my kids to public schools.  Housing is affordable, neighborhoods are clean and orderly, and the citizens are educated, friendly and WHITE.  ND also has one of the healthiest state budgets due to a stable economy filled with productive law-abiding residents.  </p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s cold in the winter.  Very cold.  But there is a sense of camaraderie among people in severe winter climates that I&rsquo;ve always found warm and inviting.  Everyone is &#8220;in it together&#8221; and there are lots of indoor activities.   [I grew up in North Dakota and Minnesota]  </p>

<p>I&rsquo;d love to tell you a bunch of places but with the ADL and SPLC monitoring this website, they&rsquo;d be labeled as places of &#8220;hate&#8221; and their attorneys would be dispatched to the area with efforts to &#8220;diversify&#8221; them.  Stay out of the metro areas, even the suburbs.  Your better off in a small town with less than 30,000 people.  No interstate access, high unemployment, no public transit and few government jobs or government contracts.  </p>

<p>Census statistics say Florida is about 80% White.  That&rsquo;s the same percentage that Tennessee has.  I&rsquo;ve live in both states and there&rsquo;s a stark contrast between the White populations in these places.   </p>

			<p>Lydia, you aren&rsquo;t alone in seeking a community that isn&rsquo;t being over-run with non-whites. </p>
<p>Like you, my husband and I are seriously looking for somewhere to retire that isn&rsquo;t crime-infested and/or busy pandering to minorities. Cold weather wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem for us.</p>
<p>One thing we&rsquo;ve noticed is that whenever we locate such a &#8220;white-friendly&#8221; place, it seems that the powers-that-be (or some demented liberal church group) decide to plunk down a community of Third World immigrants right in that very area.</p>
<p>Our motto should be: &#8220;Diversity is Death&#8221; - because it is.</p>

			<p>Since Florida is now merely an extension of Cuba and Haiti, it comes as no suprise that whites aren&rsquo;t moving there; we aren&rsquo;t moving to Cuba or Haiti, either.</p>

			<p>I was born in Miami(1962)so you can imagine the changes that I&rsquo;ve seen.<br>
In the sixties we would simply close the screen door at night for ventilation - we wouldn&rsquo;t think of locking the front wooden door.<br>
From what I&rsquo;ve seen,TN or GA would be my next stop, but definitely far from any city.</p>
<p>One benefit to the rise in fuel prices is that it will be more difficult for minoriies who make a little more $ to commute to<br>
the suburbs.</p>
<p>Either way, there is a powerful large group of elites who are determined to destroying this nations genetic ID and they will succeed - we&rsquo;re doomed.</p>
