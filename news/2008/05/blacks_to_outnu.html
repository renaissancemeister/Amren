						<p>Blacks will outnumber whites in Brazil this year for the first time since slavery was abolished, but the income gap between the two groups may take another 50 years to bridge, according to a government study released Tuesday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Blacks generally earn 50 percent to 70 percent less than whites, and hold only 3.5 percent of management positions at Brazil&rsquo;s 500 largest companies, according to the labor-union statistics institute Diesse.</p>
<p>A 2004 study by the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro found the income gap between whites and blacks in Brazil was wider than in apartheid-era South Africa.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In recent years, Brazil has created a system of quotas at public universities that has bridged the gap somewhat. But quotas are complicated in Brazil because of the high degree of mixing between races, and some critics say light-skinned people are taking spots reserved for blacks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The government study was released Tuesday to coincide with the 120th anniversary of abolition in Brazil. In 1888, Brazil became the last country in the Western hemisphere to end slavery.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..<br>
And peacefully too.  I was going to comment that Cuba abolished slavery still later. But no.  On checking, I see that Cuba abolished it in 1886, by royal Spanish decree.  Also peacefully, I might add.  What a pity that we could not have done the same.</p>

			<p>In a world where older people of all races earn more money on average than younger ones, it&rsquo;s a bit disengenuous to try to equalize the wages of two different races. One with an average age around 40 years of age. The other with an average age closer to 20. Where is this information, for starters, in this piece examining the &#8216;income gap&rsquo;? </p>

			<p>Many, maybe most, whites in Brazil would not be considered white in the US due to their partial African ancestry.  I read that 75% of Brazilians have at least 10% African ancestry.</p>

			<p>Wherever blacks are, they breed like crazy.  It&rsquo;s not in their nature to create stable, nuclear family environments.  Instead, the males run around and procreate with as many females as they can find, then leave to repeat the process over again.  It&rsquo;s in their genes   &mdash;   just look at the jungles of africa or the neighborhoods near me in East Palo Alto.</p>

			<p>What a joke!</p>
<p>When I was in Brazil the large number of non-whites, who claimed to be White was truly amazing.</p>
<p>The White/black/indian mixes of zambos, mestizos. mulattos/quadroons/octoroons all claiming to be White could only be taken seriously in Latin America, certainly not at an AR convention.<br>

			<p>I&rsquo;m with Sissy White! It got very tiresome when I lived in South America to hear a bunch of dark-skinned people arguing over who was whiter. To me they were ALL &#8220;cholos&#8221;, as the Peruvians call people with dark skin and a lot of Indian blood.</p>
<p>Hardly a surprise to hear of blacks failing in Brazil despite being the majority, though. Black failure seems to be a cultural universal.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..<br>
But they see it differently. There, it&rsquo;s the reverse.   In Brazil, anyone with a drop of European blood is &#8220;white&#8221;, whereas here, anyone with a drop  of African blood is &#8220;black&#8221;. </p>
<p>There, mulattoes argue about who is whiter.  Here, semi-whites  like Farrakhan, Wright and Obama argue about who is blacker. That&rsquo;s because here it&rsquo;s become advantageous to be black.  None of their arguments are scientific, of course. Best to avoid the whole confused tangle in the first place by avoiding race-mixing altogether.</p>
<p>However, when I was in Brazil (and it&rsquo;s been some while) ALL of the upper classes were white. You look at a picture of the Brazilian senate (I don&rsquo;t know about at present) and all the faces are white.  As everywhere else, the pernicious influence of the USA and its pop culture has been gradually undermining this.</p>

			<p>I was in Brazil recently and whilst it is true that the majority of the white population is not quite as white as what they would like to be, in fact I would guess that the 100%<br>
white is less than 10% of the population, the upper crust is not only pure white, but quite determined to keep it that way.</p>

			<p>The three southern provinces of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, and Parana are mostly white&hellip; about as white as the average U.S. state, in fact. Sao Paulo state is about half white. The rest of the country is majority black and mulatto.</p>

My Grandmother came from Scottish/German/Irish stock and, she was one of 11. That&rsquo;s much larger than the typical black, of hispanic family of today. Apparently, that generation (pre-WWII) had families that large. It&rsquo;s not the number of kids you have, but your character.</p>

			<p>  In violent, poverty-ridden, environmentally damaged Brazil, we clearly see our own future. Yes, the great liberal dream of the elimination of racism throught miscegenation has been practiced in Brazil. Is racism absent? Is this the kind of society we want to become? </p>

<p>   Exactly, but I fear it is too late for us in America. I&rsquo;m more optimistic about parts of Europe.</p>

			<p>I suspect Brazil has been black majority for some time now.  Their racial classifications of placing any brown skinned kinky haired mulatto in the White category are ridiculous.  What&rsquo;s changed is that the mulattos pressed for the same quotas as the pure black population.  Presto chango, you now have a black majority.  The White southern part of Brazil is the center of the country&rsquo;s economic growth while the northern part is Haiti lite.  I&rsquo;ve heard rumors of a separatist movement gaining momentum in the south.  </p>

			<p>Brazil has enormous potential. It SHOULD be one of the world&rsquo;s leading states and very prosperous. Undoubtedly the backwardness of Brazil is a reflection of the stock of the people who comprise this state. Had Brazil been inhabited exclusively by northern Europeans or Japanese it would be an economic dynamo. </p>

As a White brazilian, i would like to make some points.In past many mestizos, around 92 milion, used to to call them selfs &#8220;white&#8221;, But this no long happens today.One of the reasons for blacks to outnumber whites in brazil in 2008( maybe, although this my not happen)is because many meztisos, are now classifying themselves as blacks or mutltirracial.Around  10 milion meztizos are no longer saying they are whites, and this as push the black, multirracial, meztizo population up. The current number of whites is more reasonable around 94 milion down from the artificial number of over 100 milion in 2000.There are many States in brazil whitch are as white as american states like vermont, Connecticut, Illinois,indiana.The South of brazil is more than 80% white(many cities in the south are over 90 % white), sao paulo is around 70 % white. Whites are the majority in minas gerais, mato grosso do sul, rio de janeiro. There are many whites in the north(farmers), and the northeast. Brazil does not have just mestizos, there are a lot of real whites, and they have a high birth rate compared to europe, around 3 to 4 children for family.Also brasil as the largest italian population outside italy, more then 30 milion and the second largest german population after the USA, more then 12 milion.I´m of german origin my self, and in my state espirito santo, there are many  people of german, italian, swiss, spanish and portuguese origin. Many cities are almost totaly white, especially in the moutains region</p>

			<p>&#8220;sao paulo is around 70 white&#8221;</p>
<p>Sorry, I&rsquo;ve been to Sao Paulo twice and there is no way there are that many whites if you define white as someone of full European descent.  I met people in Sao Paulo who absolutely considered themselves white but it was clear to me that they had a discernable amount of African ancestry and would not be considered white in the US.</p>

			<p>Im not talking about the city of sao paulo, but the State of sao paulo. Yes the city of sao paulo has many non whites, at the least half the population is mestizo, black, indian, asian, arab. In the interior of the state of sao paulo, there are many whites. Also many of the nom whites living in the cities of sao paulo and rio de janeiro are internal migrants from the north and northeast, living in slums,(favelas).</p>

			<p>America still can be save,because whites are still the majority.<br>
In Brazil the largest city Sao Paulo is terrible, crime, poverty, decadence, shanty towns inhabited by milions, yes milions of poor nordestinos, migrants from the north of brazil.<br>
Believe it or not, Sao paulo was the city of the italians. In the 1950 and 1960 people of italian origin where the clear majority, around 75%.Now because of massive internal migration, whites in general are only 50%,but current number could be even lower.</p>

			<p>After the abolition of slavery (1888), São Paulo received large numbers of immigrants, most of them coming from Italy. In 1897, Italians immigrants were over half of the city&rsquo;s population. In the beginning of the 20 Century italian was the most spoken language in the city of sao paulo,,more then portuguese the oficial language of brazil.Today this heritage has been destroyed. The italian identity the city of Sao Paulo was so proud his disappearing rapidly,is sad.</p>
