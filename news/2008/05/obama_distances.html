						<p>Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama said Thursday that he was &ldquo;deeply disappointed&rdquo; by a supporter&rsquo;s sermon at his church that mocked Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p>
<p>The Rev. Michael Pfleger, a Chicago activist, also apologized for last Sunday&rsquo;s sermon at Obama&rsquo;s church, in which he said Clinton&rsquo;s eyes welled with tears before the New Hampshire primary because she felt &ldquo;entitled&rdquo; to the Democratic nomination and because &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a black man stealing my show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama said he was &ldquo;deeply disappointed&rdquo; by Pfleger&rsquo;s comments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I have traveled this country, I&rsquo;ve been impressed not by what divides us, but by all that that unites us,&rdquo; he said in a statement. &ldquo;That is why I am deeply disappointed in Father Pfleger&rsquo;s divisive, backward-looking rhetoric, which doesn&rsquo;t reflect the country I see or the desire of people across America to come together in common cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pfleger, the white pastor of predominantly black Saint Sabina Roman Catholic Church on the city&rsquo;s Southwest side, said he regretted his choice of words.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In March, Pfleger invited Obama&rsquo;s embattled former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, to speak at Saint Sabina, embracing Wright in the church.</p>
<p>Obama recently broke with Wright, who had been his longtime pastor, after video of his sermons blaming U.S. policies for the Sept. 11 attacks and his calls of &ldquo;God damn America&rdquo; became fixtures on the Internet and cable news networks and created a political problem for the candidate.</p>
<p>Pfleger, known locally as a community activist and organizer, was arrested in June 2007 with the Rev. Jesse Jackson during a protest outside of a south suburban Chicago gun shop. The criminal trespass charges were later dropped.</p>
<p>He also has hosted Louis Farrakhan, the controversial leader of the Nation of Islam, at St. Sabina and has called him &ldquo;a gift from God to a sick, sick world.&rdquo;<br>

					<p>What I want to see from now to November is Jeremiah Wright<br>
sermons on television 24-7, interspersed with Malcom X sermons,and Louis Farrakhan sermons, with cuts for scenes from the LA riots, the Detroit riots, black carjackings, stick ups at convenience stores, hip hop song lyrics, Al Sharpton speeches<br><br>
etc..over and over and over so that America never stops forgetting what black culture is, and who Obama represents</p>

					<p>Obama is lying again&hellip;.If he has traveled this country all over and not seen the very real divided country we are now, then he is blind and too ignorant to be President. He knows he is only saying this to get the White vote, since most of those Whites who will vote for him are all loony leftists and love to feel all &#8220;warm and cuddly&#8221; when it comes to race. What a bad joke he is.</p>

					<p>&#8220;As I have travelled this country, I&rsquo;ve been impressed not by what divides us, but by all that unites us.  That is why I am deeply disappointed in Father Pfleger&rsquo;s divisive, backward-looking rhetoric, which doesn&rsquo;t reflect the country I see or the desire of people across America to come together in common cause&#8221;</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t have been more eloquent; would that it were the truth in his heart.  I&rsquo;m truly concerned that this silver-tongued &#8220;community organizer&#8221; may be our next President.  But I&rsquo;m even more disturbed to contemplate the possible biblical implications.</p>

					<p>There is an old saying where I come from, &#8220;tell me who your friends are and I&rsquo;ll tell you who you are&#8221;. Obama certainly likes to surround himself with racist thinking people who have no reservations when it comes to showing their hatred for &#8220;WHITEY&#8221; and their total disdain for America at every possible venue. I am led to believe by his associates and even his mate that he (Obama)is a racist and would love to take this country down the path of Democracy &#8220;South African style&#8221;.</p>
<p>As for his outspoken Catholic priest, it is past time for the catholic Church to be given the status of a for profit political organisation and lose its tax exempt status. By doing so the church would drop its favorite crusade of <span class="caps">AMNESTY </span>and stop providing sanctuary for Illegal Criminal Aliens and get back to more important issues like making money under the guise of doing Gods work.</p>

<p>First it was Illinois slimeball Rezko who&rsquo;s on trial now.  </p>
<p>Then it was Barry&rsquo;s  wife making cracks about her newly discovered &#8216;pride&rsquo;.</p>
<p>After that came Bill Ayers the 60&rsquo;s ultra-lib terrorist bomber claiming to be Obama&rsquo;s &#8216;acquaintance&rsquo;.</p>
<p>A month ago it was the reverend Jeremiah Wrong and his hate Whitey stuff.</p>
<p>Now, this demented poor excuse for as White man Pfleger spews trash.  Fun reaction from the 8,000 Africans sitting in the pews, too.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s next?  And what will it take to convince a nation what this empty suit is actually about?</p>

					<p>Yeah&hellip;.this one is going to hurt.  Clinton supporters, to the tune of nearly a third of the democratic base, are already threatening to either vote McCain or simply not vote at all, to protest Obama.  <span class="caps">BLATANT </span>disrespect like this, plus the not so subtle reference to black supremacy (by a white person no less&hellip;.lol) will have them running, not walking to McCain.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if the superdelegates stepped in and nominated Clinton, in order to head off a <span class="caps">DNC </span>meltdown.</p>

<p>Keep running Comrade Obama, but you are not going to find a hiding place outside of <span class="caps">MSNBC </span>or the New Your Times. The fact of the matter is, you are nothing but the typical black affirmative action case; you never would have gotten where you are without stupidly fawning whites, and that just grinds you. Plus, the blacks that &ldquo;support&rdquo; you from the &ldquo;hood&rdquo; are only going to help you so much. This includes white wannabe ghetto priests, as well; it is their jealousy of productive whites that drives them consciously, but subconsciously it is their jealousy of you that drives them with even more tenacity, to act out so brazenly idiotic.  </p>
<p>People driven by incompetent greed and wanton entitlement, never like to see anyone get ahead. That includes mulatto presidential pretenders like you, Comrade Obama.</p>
<p>As the old phrase goes: with &ldquo;friends&rdquo; like these Comrade <span class="caps">BO, </span>who needs enemies?<br>

<p>Sorry, old boy, but that&rsquo;s far short of what is necessary to square you with a lot of us who don&rsquo;t qualify as white morons.</p>
<p>You need to verbally pummel the entire church and it&rsquo;s evil congregation, telling them in no uncertain terms how disgusted you are with their anti-white, anti-American hatred.</p>
<p>And after that, you need to publicy berate your wife for her anti-American hatred.</p>
<p>Once that&rsquo;s done and you apologize to us over and over again vehemently, and the polls open in November, I&rsquo;ll stay home, because I don&rsquo;t like either you or McCain.  McCain is a fool, and anything you say can&rsquo;t be believed.  We all know you&rsquo;ll say anything just to be the first brutha elected to the office of pres.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d be heart attack surprised.  The dems would much rather do &#8220;righteous&#8221; thing and commit political suicide than the &#8220;ugly, racist&#8221; thing and get the blacks (and their bosom buddies, the media) in a total uproar.</p>
<p>Losing and casting themselves as &#8220;righteous martyrs&#8221; is the dems all over, psychologically.  Of course the dems are politically suicidal; why else would the have backed Obama this long?</p>
<p>Show of hands, anyone who doesn&rsquo;t believe losing for great reasons gets liberals rrreeeeaaallly excited?  Sorta like gays who want to get <span class="caps">AIDS </span>for the sympathy and doomed chic (not making that up)?</p>

					<p>He can distance himself from his clergyman as long as he wishes, he still will not win the presidency. Many people  do not want a black man for president (even though Obama is not really black)because black people  have way too much social problems such as crime, gangs, poverty and afrocentrism. And these problems are happenning under white rule so can you imagine what it&rsquo;s gonna be like when a black person will be in the oval office, especially given the past failures of black mayors in our major cities. </p>
<p>Obama will easily carry Massachussetts, Illinois and Hawaii. But that&rsquo;s as far as he will get. Heck, I don&rsquo;t even think California will vote for him. </p>

He is just a useful idiot to them,and he&rsquo;s too stupid to see it. When he&rsquo;s no longer useful, they will &#8220;do away&#8221; him.

					<p>To all you Euro-Americans who are going to stay home on election day,<br>
If you do that you may as well annoint Obama. If you aren&rsquo;t particularly thrilled with McCain, keep in mind that he has declared that he will go into office as a lame duck.  If he chooses a real Conservative VP running mate, we can certainly survive John for four years. <br><br>
Race is the ugly truth that has been swept under the carpet since the sixties. Aal debate has been successfully quelled due to White people&rsquo;s fear of being called a racist. Let&rsquo;s finally get some courage. A racist is nothing more than someone who verbalizes what every other white and Asian American already knows. It&rsquo;s out on the table now and it may be our last chance to save our country. We can also survive Hillary. I think that evens <span class="caps">SHE </span>has learned a lesson from this whole debacle. The very people that her husband has championed have turned on her. With the help of the bufoons Wright and Pfleger, the rest of White America has gotten the message about the way that Blacks really feel about us. If another Marcus Garvey comes on the scene with a &#8220;Back to Africa&#8221; program, let&rsquo;s all support it. It will be money well spent. What have they contributed to the betterment of society? <br><br>
Drive bys, Gang rape, Burlesque basketball, Rap, R. Kelly, <span class="caps">O.J. O.J</span> Simpson, the Karr Brothers, Mumiya Abu Jamal, Ruben Carter? The list of their accomplishments is too long to list here! </p>

					<p>Don&rsquo;t stay home.  Even if there is nothing appealing about either Obama or McCain, there are plenty of other things worth voting for or against: congressmen, ballot iniattives, judge retention, and so-on.  Moveover, if yo stay home, the <span class="caps">MSM </span>will merely report on &#8220;voter apathy&#8221;.  Vote for a Third Party Presedential candidate.  The corporate McNews folks can&rsquo;t invoke &#8220;voter apathy&#8221; to describe a record turnout for the Libertarians - or whomever, and the <span class="caps">GOP </span>may actually start paying attention to its coreconstituency - us - afterward.</p>
<p>I figure as long as we are voting for <strong>somebody</strong> it isn&rsquo;t &#8220;apathy&#8221;; it is a withdrawal of consent.</p>

					<p>&#8220;Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama said Thursday that he was &ldquo;deeply disappointed&rdquo; by a supporter&rsquo;s sermon at his church that mocked Hillary Rodham Clinton.&#8221;</p>
<p>But he said afterwards during a televised press conference that he resigned from Trinity Church, because the church employees were being harassed by the press, and he believed that would continue every time someone at the church, or its guest speakers, said anything that might be regarded as &#8220;controversial&#8221; by some, so long as he was still a member.   He made it sound as if they were victims of whites and the prying press.</p>
<p>He said he wasn&rsquo;t denouncing the church and that he had a deep affection for the new Pastor and the congregants.  This, of course, is the same pastor who agreed with the anti-white, hate-filled rhetoric of both Wright and Pfleger, and the same congregants who shouted with glee everytime a hate-filled diatribe against whites was screamed out by these two, and the same congregants that jumped to their feed in spontaneous applause, during the most heated and inflammatory, anti-white hate speech.</p>
<p>And as is usually the case, Juan Williams on Fox News and all the talking black heads on <span class="caps">CNN, </span>actually tried to put a justifiable spin on the situation, showing all of us the extent to which blacks support their tribesmen, just as they do in every case where a black is guilty of outright racism and/or some kind of criminal atrocity, like the <span class="caps">O.J. </span>murder of white people, afterwhich they showed their hatred of whites by applauding the not guilty verdicts of a mostly black jury.</p>
<p>Any white who supports a black is an absolute fool. <br>

<p>That&rsquo;s a wonderful selling point for a Presidential candidate to make.  I also like the fact that he&rsquo;s said he doesn&rsquo;t know much about economics either and let&rsquo;s not forget he flipped flopped on immigration again.  It&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s got a big sign on him that says don&rsquo;t vote for me.  He&rsquo;s either an ignorant moron or he&rsquo;s counting on a big defection of Democratic voters this November.  In his thinking he can afford to slap around Conservatives.  I say vote third party and it&rsquo;s not a lost cause either given the weakness of both candidates. </p>

<p>Also I don&rsquo;t know why they refer to these institutions as &#8220;churches&#8221;. The video of Pfleger looked more like something from Def Jam comedy jam rather than anything resembling a church. </p>
<p>I mean  really, other than the occasional exclamation of &#8220;Praise Jesus!&#8221; how does going to watch some pompous millionaire strutting about a stage, telling racist jokes, while the audience whoops and hollers and dances in the aisles constitute a &#8220;church&#8221;??? </p>

					<p>AP/UPI Washington:  At a press conference today in Washington de,ocratic contender Barack Hussain Obama announced that he has selected three of his Muslim Kenya-born half-brothers for the top spots in his cabinet.  Although they are foreign nationals they all hold US green cards and the time they have already served in a US prison for murder, rape and cannibalism qualifies them to hold public office.  Obama has stated he will give them all presidential pardons and commute their sentences, because he believes &#8220;everyone deserves a second chance&#8221;.   He says he hasn&rsquo;t yet decided which of the three he will pick as his Vice President.<br>

					<p>Robert Kelly, you reminded me of something about the verdict in the <span class="caps">O.J.</span> Case. The blacks not only applauded the not guilty verdict, but they were shown right on camera doing little jiggs and dancing with glee. I thought it sick then and still do.</p>

					<p>Obama showed that deep down he is a man without honor or guts and that he is no more qualified to be president than dead carp that washes up from the Chicago sewers every now and then.<br>
     He quit his church rather than try to bring Christian love back to the pulpit. If he would quit his church that helped propel him to the apex of world power, he will fold up at three o`clock in the morning.<br><br>
     How many of you <span class="caps">AMREN </span>fanatics would abandon your faith or your friends this side of the infernal regions? A large majority of us should go to the nearest vet and get gelded so we won`t pass on our worthless liberal genes.<br><br>
     Every day I secretly hope for a gonad busting depression that will force folks to return to honor, courage and self reliance. If we have no such calamity, we will continue our slow decline into a mongrelized third world existance where self trumps family and future.<br><br>

					<p>Is it just a coincidence that Senator Obama has distanced himself from his church after a sermon by a &#8220;white&#8221; priest? Is this the reason? Or the excuse?</p>

<p>&gt; I think we have a good chance of this happening, but it will also likely be accompanied by ecological collapse and a host of other problems as well such as uncontrollable disease pandemics.  It will be very horrible to live and die and many whites will die as well as non-whites.  The longer it takes to occur the more likely it is that I and people not very young will be vulnerable and most likely to go first.  Yet, I do not subscribe to the idea of the Christian Apocalypse.  I have long blamed people who do for non-action.  Being passive in the face of this guarantees extinction.</p>
