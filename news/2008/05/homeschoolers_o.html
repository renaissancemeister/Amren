						<p>When Dotty Barco&rsquo;s oldest son, Caleb, began to struggle with third-grade math, she remembered the statistic she&rsquo;d run across while writing a college paper.</p>
<p>According to the National Urban League, black male achievement begins to decline as early as fourth grade. Blacks continue to fall behind through high school, in test scores, grades and dropout rates. Fewer than half of black males graduate in four years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fourth grade, African-American males drop to the bottom &mdash; we can&rsquo;t find them anymore,&rdquo; said Barco, a former public school teacher and mother of four boys. &ldquo;I knew fourth grade was coming, [and] I couldn&rsquo;t have my son be a part of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That year, Barco pulled all her sons out of Vance Elementary School in Raleigh. She has been home-schooling them since. </p>
<p>The Barcos join an increasing number of black families in the Triangle and across the country who choose to home-school their children. Of the estimated 1.1 million home-schooled children in the U.S., about 10 percent are black, according to the most recent federal statistics from the U.S. Department of Education.</p>
<p>Blacks are the fastest-growing demographic among home-schoolers, said Jennifer James, a Boone mother of two who in 2003 founded the National African-American Homeschoolers Alliance, a nonreligious group that provides online information and support to about 3,000 home-schoolers.</p>
<p>Disappointed with the public school system, many black parents opt to home-school because they want more rigorous academics and a truly multicultural education, James said. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many black parents say they fear their children will be labeled as disruptive in public schools and believe they can provide an educational environment better suited to their children&rsquo;s learning styles. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Looking for role models</p>
<p>Nadja Bonhomme of Garner was troubled by the lack of black role models in public schools. &ldquo;The ethnicity of a teacher matters a lot for boys,&rdquo; said Bonhomme, who home-schooled her 13-year-old son, Anastasio, for two years. &ldquo;Boys should see teachers who represent them, what they see when they look in the mirror.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Parents also worry that their children will face troubling social pressures to fit in with negative stereotypes. </p>
<p>&ldquo;If they&rsquo;re successful academically, then people tell them they&rsquo;re acting like a white person. Then they&rsquo;re not doing well socially with kids of their own cultural heritage. Or they can get along well socially and not do well in school,&rdquo; said Louise Omoto Kessel of Pittsboro, an adoptive mother of two black children, ages 6 and 3.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Facing skeptics</p>
<p>Still, black home-schooling families say they face skepticism &mdash; even among friends and family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone has their eyebrows arched,&rdquo; said Kamela Heyward-Rotimi of Durham, who has been home-schooling her 9-year-old son, Kola, for six years. &ldquo;[Friends said] &lsquo;You&rsquo;re home-schooling? That&rsquo;s for really radical white Christians in the mountains!&rsquo; We questioned right along with them, [wondering], &lsquo;How is this going to work out?&rsquo; Well, my son did very well on the Iowa [standardized test]. Now, when people ask, &lsquo;How is that working for you?&rsquo; I can say confidently, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s working well.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>

					<p>All this article tells us is that Blacks want black teachers, teaching an Afrocentric curriculum; they want segregation back on their terms&hellip;they want a sign next to the door saying &#8220;No Whites Allowed&#8221;.<br>
&#8220;A truly multicultural education&#8221; means that public schools had too many non-black races who needed attention and a month of class time dedicated to the achievements of all the different races. In the black mind this is racist, as only blacks can make something &#8220;mulitcultural&#8221;. In fact they are so rich in culture that a 100% black school is considered multicultural; culture is the antioxidant found in human &#8220;dark chocolate!&#8221; <br><br>
Besides all that, as anyone who is a product of the American education system knows, only blacks are worthy of having a special month set aside for their achievements. Anything else is an insult to the memory of their ancestors bondage, naturally.</p>

<p>Yes, and they get dangerously close to learning something   &mdash;   how radical.  I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve all heard about the Subway/homeschool controversy.  Subway just admitted that they banned h/sers in order to give the public school students a chance to win.  After all, wouldn&rsquo;t want Olympic track athletes to enter an elementary school field day.</p>

					<p>If parents,of any race feel that they must homeschool their kids because the schools are so bad, they should at least <span class="caps">ATTEMPT </span>to steer the schools toward some kind of sanity.How many voters try to select school board members based on their merits?How many voters even vote at all in the school board elections?Very few, I suspect.In San Francisco, there have been a <span class="caps">FEW </span>really good candidates, but none of them ever got elected.The ones that do get in are usually leftist pinko types.Homeschooling without trying to correct the sad state of how the schools are run is just surrender without honor.</p>

					<p>     This is a valuable angle to explore because it<br>
exposes a large chink in our enemy&rsquo;s armor. Many<br><br>
Blacks and Hispanics are Christians and loathe the<br><br>
Left and Homosexuality. That they are Christian has<br><br>
worked against us up to this point because so many<br><br>
of our people are as well. But it could work for us<br><br>
if we expose the contraditions of this alliance. That<br><br>
there are huge contradictions is evident from the<br><br>
Hillary/Obama steel cage match. But let&rsquo;s unpack it<br><br>
issue by issue.</p>

<p>Blacks had plenty of role models in the classroon when they were segregated. She should be pushing for a return to segregation.</p>

					<p>&#8220;&hellip;..Casie Price of Clayton knew her 6-year-old son, Kemet, wouldn&rsquo;t excel in a traditional classroom. His IQ tested &#8220;off the charts,&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;ll just bet his <span class="caps">I.Q. </span>tested &#8220;off the charts.&#8221;  Off the charts on the left side if the Bell Curve. How many blacks have we had on this site claiming the same thing then writing a post that sounds almost illiterate, using unsound reasoning that is on about a fourth grade level?</p>
<p>But, in spite of that, good for blacks for trying something else besides the schools where they&rsquo;ve been unable to learn for the last 150 years.</p>

					<p>A perfect admission that the public school system has failed everyone.  Whenever one hears about proposals for socialized medicine, it pays to keep in mind that the same folks who destroyed our schools when they were federalized under the Department of Education would be the ones running health care.</p>

<p>Well then, I suppose that would apply to white boys too.  Why don&rsquo;t we say that publicly about whites and see how that goes over.</p>
<p>As for the concept itself I say, of course, all the power to them.</p>

					<p>I think this is a good thing because it takes more of these troublemakers out of the classrooms but I can&rsquo;t help but wonder if the parents, sorry parent, is doing this so she can give the kid a free pass on an &#8220;ejumakachun&#8221;.  After all, a curriculum top heavy with afrocentric history and black math would hardly be valuable to any kids future.  Anyhow, I don&rsquo;t care as long as they&rsquo;re gone, that&rsquo;s what really matters.</p>

What this article doesn&rsquo;t say:</p>
<p>Black middle class parents don&rsquo;t want their kids mixing in with the black lower class children, picking up terrible attitudes, and being dragged down by the dominant black culture. The negative influence of other black kids will overpower the influence of the parents if it goes unchecked. </p>

					<p>Of course Blacks should be in charge of their own education and destiny. As a White Nationalist, I think that Blacks are entitled to the same advantages I seek for my own race. Integration was wrong from the beginning, so home-schooling is a step in the right direction for both races. Home-schooling / tutoring is what I desperately needed when I was a lad; the public schools failed to educate me.</p>

					<p>Of course Blacks should be in charge of their own education and destiny. Blacks should govern themselves.</p>
<p>Both races were losers in the forced integration &#8216;solution.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Home-schooling is our best hope. It can lead us back in some areas of life to pre-integration days by helping each race build its own communities. </p>
<p>Building race-based communities is the first step toward reaching a political solution providing each race freedom from dominance and interference from competing groups.</p>
<p>I can assure you all that the public schools failed miserably to educate me properly, and what little I do know I learned on my own.</p>

					<p>Oh if the public school system had only &#8216;failed&rsquo; us.<br>
More succinctly, it has nigh killed us.<br><br>
None of the social pathologies we read about and discuss on this board are organic. <span class="caps">ALL </span>of them have been planned long ago, and we, unwitting and committed to being congenial at all times refused to believe that we were being made to dance a jig to the Progressive fiddle. Those of us who refuse have guns trained at our feet and told to rejoice OR <span class="caps">ELSE.</span><br><br>
But that is not what I wanted to comment about.<br><br>
My subject is the treacherous use of Stereotype.<br><br>
We have all been deeply steeped in the doctrines of Equanimity by our progressive form-givers (ie teachers)<br><br>
Equanimity demands that we at all times and at the greatest pains see every one and every thing without any reference whatsoever to prior understanding-as Tabula Rasa. This was a fundamental epistemological conviction of John Dewey and his cohort.<br><br>
Because of this, a good portion of the circuitry of our heads has been deliberately disabled-especially the deep programs that deal with survival and self preservation, which operate at mostly instinctual frequency. Almost all of the survival mode operates with direct interface with <span class="caps">EXPERIENCE, </span>prior understanding, received ideas, etc. These things were deemed &#8216;archaic&rsquo; by the architects of the Modern Mind, and so they designed programmatic software and downloaded it, so to speak, through the classroom.</p>
<p>The problem of course is that because the survival mode of the human psyche is so obdurately instinctual, that NO amount of &#8216;reasoning&rsquo; and persuasion can remove it from us. After a while it became obvious the Psyche Architects, so they did what they normally do in such cases;&#8221;co-opt what you cannot overcome&#8221;<br>
Now I will get to my point:<br><br>
Did you notice that &#8220;White radicals who live in the mountains&#8221; is itself a stereotype? That it seeks to &#8216;marginalize whole sections of the population, and deny them a voice&rsquo;?<br><br>
That is because IT IS entirely stereotypical, and is used by the same people who in the next breath will be breathlessly extolling the virtues of the brotherhood of man.<br><br>
Hypocrisy is of the very essence of modern Tolerence.*<br><br>
The communicants of the religion of Public School are as determined to wipe out Home Schooling** as the Calvinists were at eradicating Arminianism.<br><br>
Note, however, that while the naturally functioning psyche uses Stereotype (prior understanding, etc) at a mostly subconscious level and only for the purposes of self preservation, the Progressive type uses it fully consciously and for the seizure and maintenance of Power, wielding it even as a battle-axe.<br><br>
That is a difference worth paying attention to.</p>

					<p>I have two points:</p>
<p>1) The mother says that studies show that black academic achievement starts to drop off around the fourth grade.  It is known that blacks commence sexual development the earliest, so I would say that this drop is more likely due to the immediate onset of puberty as per Rushton where the older the black students, the higher the IQ gap between other races of students.</p>
<p>2) One of the unwritten functions of school is to mould the students into an effective workforce - staying still, learning to concentrate, doing what the authority figure tells you, learning to research, collate and think, etc.  If blacks can&rsquo;t tolerate this and are taught in a more racially suited fashion, then what preliminary skills will they learn to take to the workforce?  Black-specific methods will only lead to further black dysfunction and lack of integration with white society (although it really can&rsquo;t get much worse).</p>

					<p>This was in the original article:</p>
<p>Parents also worry that their children will face troubling social pressures to fit in with negative stereotypes. </p>
<p>&#8220;If they&rsquo;re successful academically, then people tell them they&rsquo;re acting like a white person. Then they&rsquo;re not doing well socially with kids of their own cultural heritage. Or they can get along well socially and not do well in school,&#8221; said Louise Omoto Kessel of Pittsboro, an adoptive mother of two black children, ages 6 and 3. </p>
<p>Home schooling means taking on a lot of work and indicates a real dedication to your children. I&rsquo;m sure in addition to the superior educational benefit, black children benefit from escaping the &#8220;crab pot syndrome&#8221;. (No crabs can climb out of the pot, because the other crabs pull them back in).</p>

<p>Terrible error here, the state ain&rsquo;t supposed to be doing these things (schools) in the first place.  Government is force, and only force.  So the question is- when should governmental force be used?  Why, against criminals- those who violate rights of others.</p>

<p>And maybe you&rsquo;re a black poster wanting someone to believe that all it takes for blacks to excel is home schooling, when a wealth of evidence from all over the world unequivocally proves that blacks cannot compete on an advanced level no matter what the circumstances are.</p>
<p>Why you people don&rsquo;t do something constructive to help your people out instead of naively believing you can fabricate stories to elevate them as a group is a mystery to me, unless scamming is just second nature to blacks as a group.</p>

<p>I saw an earlier comment of two home-schooled blacks going to Harvard and Stanford. I just find it hard to believe that they would benefit from this academically. Blacks need some sort of white influence academically to have any chance of succeeding. Whether it be white teachers or the structured environment of our school system. </p>

					<p>This has been going on for years. I knew a publisher of textbooks in the 80s. He started the business to supply textbooks and school materials to isolated rural cummunities. After a few years he found out that 75% of his sales went to the inner city.</p>
<p>You may not know this but in some places you can home school and still get credit. You have to make arrangements with a school principal. Occasionally a school official will visit and test the child. In the end the child will have a diploma like the other children even though they were rarely seen in the building. Ask if your community has this type of program. </p>

					<p>I say that home-schooling is the fittest idea for black families. The idea gives black students two major advantages.<br>
1. all knowledge in less time. Because the parents know nothing, and the kids want to know nothing, so where is nothing easier than to teach nothing. The system leaves the diligent black students more time to get the supplemental street-education.<br><br>
2. precise knowledge. The students would not have to learn the miserable white culture and acquire only the great African culture.<br><br>
All together is the best way to bring up an African Einstein. </p>

<p>Where in my post did you see where I claimed all blacks are dumb and all whites are smart, though that&rsquo;s not far from the truth if we use an IQ average of 85 regarding whites and one of 100 regarding blacks?  </p>
<p>You know I&rsquo;m getting sick of gullible whites like you who (if that&rsquo;s really what you are) just jump up in outrage defending the very people that try to fool them into believing what they want them to believe.  If this poster in question isn&rsquo;t a black imposter, as we have had on here many times before, I&rsquo;d be very surprised. The last one was a few days ago and there were a couple of outrages just like yours before those raising protests realized they had been duped and recognized the rheotoric and phraseology of the black poster who had tricked them.</p>
<p>You are not only defending blacks in general, you&rsquo;re promoting them in spite of the fact that they regard people they fool as white buffoons. That type of misguided, guillibility is why we are having a lot of the problems with blacks right now.  Those kinds of attitudes just make things worse.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I look at the horrid choice of candidates we have in the upcoming presidential election, and realize how many whites voted for them, I know that there are plenty of stupid white people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Your entire post seems highly bizarre for a white realist, making me think that we could well have the same black imposter taking on the handle that somebody else uses for the purpose of thinking it will allow him validity.  That has been done before.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read your posts in the past many times, and none of them took on the tenor of this last one, which is highly suspect.  And just as suspect is raising objections to points never made, then going into a tirade about how smart some blacks are and how there are a lot of dumb whites, which are exactly the hallmarks of our black imposter.</p>
<p>Cut it any way you want, but whether blacks are home-schooled or not won&rsquo;t act as some magical wand that can be waved over their heads to turn them into the white average, nor will it allow them to catch up with the other races either.</p>
<p>Home schooling for blacks is good in so far as it will teach them at least <span class="caps">SOMETHING </span>they couldn&rsquo;t learn in public school, and will get them out of the same environment with whites so that there will less chance of having a disruptive atmosphere which is detrimental to an atmosphere of learning for people who go to school to learn and not for the purposes of &#8220;strutting their stuff and causing disruptions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Color it any way you want, but blacks just don&rsquo;t belong in an advanced society, unless they learn to behave and are willing to learn those subjects they can do in the field of labor.  Home schooling won&rsquo;t change that.  Even the brightest blacks are not very bright when compared to the other races.</p>

From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;According to the National Urban League, black male achievement begins to decline as early as fourth grade. Blacks continue to fall behind through high school, in test scores, grades and dropout rates&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Not True.</p>
<p>Ian Jobling writes in &#8220;Fantasy and Fraud: No Child Left Behind&#8221;:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The racial gap starts even before students get to school&hellip;black preschoolers score considerably lower on ability tests than White preschoolers. Differences in social class or parents&rsquo; education do not explain the gap either&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s more bad news for black parents:</p>
<p>&#8221;..After intense early instruction, ghetto children did manage to improve their scores on achievement and even IQ tests. What is less well known is that these improvements could not be made to last. </p>
<p>Professor Arthur Jensen of Berkeley&hellip;. suspects that real, underlying intelligence  &mdash;  what he calls g  &mdash;  cannot be improved by instruction&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="/ar/1992/11.html" rel="nofollow">/ar/1992/11/</a></p>
<p>As for the typical black racist comment:</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s for really radical White Christians in the mountains!&#8221;</p>
<p>I belong to a home schooling coalition; the vast majority of the parents are highly educated professionals.</p>
<p>Most of the parents yanked their kids out of the government schools for the same reason I pulled out my youngest son:  A stifling, dumbed-down multi-cultural, White-hating, leftist curricula with which we profoundly disagree and which holds our children back (if not down).</p>
<p>My son is now able to study and learn without interference from disruptive, mainstreamed students  who destroy the educational progress of everyone in the room.</p>
<p><span class="caps">BTW</span>:  My home schooled son scored so high on his state science exam that he received a special commendation  &mdash;  he also scored 100% on his state math exam.</p>

					<p>Robert Kelly: <i>Where in my post did you see where I claimed all blacks are dumb and all whites are smart?</i></p>
<p>In response to a post by Roger you said: <i>And maybe you&rsquo;re a black poster wanting someone to believe that all it takes for blacks to excel is home schooling, when a wealth of evidence from all over the world unequivocally proves that blacks cannot compete on an advanced level no matter what the circumstances are.</i></p>
<p>The clear implication being that you felt home schooling would be useless for essentially all black students.  Roger made no claim that all blacks would excel if only they were home schooled, only that a couple of highly talented black kids did indeed do very well when they were home schooled, while they would probably have sunk with the rest of the class had they been dumped into a majority black public school.</p>
<p>I never said that home schooling would erase the differences between blacks and whites in educational attainment.  I merely pointed out that blacks with motivated parents are likely to benefit from home schooling, as are whites with motivated parents.  There are indeed some blacks who &#8220;compete on an advanced level&#8221;.  There are black mathematicians and black physicists.  Not very many of them, and generally not in the very top ranks of those fields, but they&rsquo;re smarter than 90% of the whites.  Like any civilized people, they should learn to behave, but there&rsquo;s no reason why they should have to be employed &#8220;in the field of labor&#8221;.</p>
<p>In the more libertarian society I would favor people would be allowed to associate with whom they want (and not associate with whom they don&rsquo;t want) and hire whom they want (and not hire whom they don&rsquo;t want) and schooling would be out of the incompetent hands of the government.  In such a society it would be indeed be the case that relatively more blacks would be in manual labor and more whites would be in more skilled positions (and there wouldn&rsquo;t be any such position as &#8220;diversity officer&#8221;) but it wouldn&rsquo;t be anything like the absolute division you imply.</p>
<p>And do get over your paranoia.  I am indeed the real WR the elder.  Nor would I leap to any assumptions that Roger is black.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve drank the kool-aid, my friend. The public school system isn&rsquo;t supposed to exist in the first place. The fact they are government run and thereby &#8220;protected&#8221; from standard market forces means their primary objective is to sustain and grow themselves, not to educate your children. At best, the latter will be unrelated to accomplishing the former. At worst, the two will be at odds.</p>

<p>WR elder: In response to a post by Roger you said: And maybe you&rsquo;re a black poster wanting someone to believe that all it takes for blacks to excel is home schooling, when a wealth of evidence from all over the world unequivocally proves that blacks cannot compete on an advanced level no matter what the circumstances are.&#8221;</p>
<p>RK:  And that assertion is unequivocally true, and has been talked about with much evidence provided on this forum many times.  &#8220;a wealth of evidence from all over the world unequivocally proves that blacks cannot compete on an advanced level no matter what the circumstances are.&#8221;</p>
<p>And from that simle statement you gleaned a plethora of additional information you somehow perceived was in there.  Amazing.  Please&hellip;.if you are taken in by these imposters on the site, keep it to yourself, eh?  Denigrating those of us who try to keep the black posters honest is absolutely deplorable.</p>
<p>WR:  The clear implication being that you felt home schooling would be useless for essentially all black students.</p>
<p>RK:  The clear implication is <span class="caps">EXACTLY </span>what is said, with no ulteror meaning. It is you that provided the implication, not me, and you have the audacity to expand and criticize something that was never intended.  It&rsquo;s not only wrong, it&rsquo;s completely uncalled for.</p>
<p>WR: Roger made no claim that all blacks would excel if only they were home schooled, only that a couple of highly talented black kids did indeed do very well when they were home schooled, </p>
<p>Roger, old boy, is a black imposter.  I can recognize his rhetoric and lack of logic anywhere.  Anybody that is taken in by him is evidencing a gullibility that has been harmful to whites for over 150 years now.  He has sent at least a couple of dozen emails to me saying basically the same thing trying to flim flam me into accepting such nonsense.  If you are not perceptive enough to know when an attempt at foolery is posted, please don&rsquo;t denigrate anybody with comments of being paranoid.  </p>
<p>I have much experience with this black imposter, and his prior attempt a couple of days ago, which I also pointed out,  finally became obvious to anybody not too gullible to know that he did indeed try to fool everybody into believing he was a boy genius in the sciences.  And before he did so, there was one other poster that denigrated me, just as you have done,  for bringing that out until he too finally saw the light after further comments by this man.  </p>
<p>WR: &hellip;while they would probably have sunk with the rest of the class had they been dumped into a majority black public school.&#8221;</p>
<p>RK:  How can you even hazard a guess about something like that?  And how strange you&rsquo;re so positive &#8220;Roger&#8221; is on the up and up and the alleged two black geniuses would not be geniuses if they had to learn that two plus equals four in the public school, instead of being home schooled, while you&rsquo;re totally unable to accept that the poster might very well be an imposter?</p>
<p>The imposter was trying to convince us that the problem with blacks in their lack of ability to learn is because of the way they&rsquo;ve been taught, rather than black ineptitude and a reluctance to apply themselves, probably discouraged by the fact that learning basic subjects reads to them like Greek.  That&rsquo;s not the case which has been proven time and again, and I&rsquo;m not going to sit by like a gullible fool without challenging the premise.  Sorry if you don&rsquo;t like it, but I&rsquo;ll do the same again if it&rsquo;s warranted.</p>
<p>WR: There are black mathematicians and black physicists. Not very many of them, and generally not in the very top ranks of those fields, but they&rsquo;re smarter than 90% of the whites. </p>
<p>RK:  And where did you get those figures?  Smarter than 90% of whites?  How do you know that?  There are a few who claim scientific credentials, but as we&rsquo;ve seen on this site, the articles they write sound as if they came from high schoolers and are bizarre and ludicrous.  Are you certain they aren&rsquo;t AA tokens, which I tend to believe is the case, with maybe rare exceptions?  </p>
<p><span class="caps">BUT </span>what I woulf really like to know is why you brought up a defense of black accomplishment when I never contested that?  And, please, no more with the &#8220;you implied&#8221; business, eh?  I never even came close to writing what you seem pressed to defend.  It nonsense.</p>
<p>The bottom line here is what I maintained to begin with is that my post was pretty innocuous and concerned blacks in general, just as other comments on here do, but you have read something into them that isn&rsquo;t there, and your entire presentation is appalling, and completely out of line.   </p>
<p>To posters who radically jump up eager to defend a group of people that dislikes and even hates them is beyond bizarre, especially over matters of no real consequence, against people they&rsquo;re supposed to support, and such unprovoked attacks are absolutely repugnant.</p>

					<p>&#8220;To say that no Black child is intelligent enough to be home schooled or is unable to learn is donwright foolish. You should certainly be aware of the fact that there are Black children that are able to learn effectively just as there are White children who are unable to learn and vice versa.&#8221; Posted by Pragmatic Race Man at 4:16 PM on June 2</p>
<p>People on here are referring to blacks as a group, mostly, and what they have to say is absolutely correct.</p>
<p>And what is downright foolish is the confusion some people have with assuming specific charges against every individual black is intended when one refers to blacvk inasbility to learn.  Must it spelled out specifically in order for you to understand that?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>
<p>RK: &#8220;And maybe you&rsquo;re a black poster wanting someone to believe that all it takes for blacks to excel is home schooling, when a wealth of evidence from all over the world unequivocally proves that blacks cannot compete on an advanced level no matter what the circumstances are.&#8221;</p>
<p>Where in there can it be perceived that specific allegations that there are no blacks above the black norm?</p>
<p>When we speak of &#8220;blacks&#8221; we&rsquo;re referring to blacks in general, and if you&rsquo;ve been keeping score I think you won&rsquo;t be able to disagree that the above statement has proven its validity by a wealth of evidence by the experts and considerable experience revealed in <span class="caps">MANY </span>news articles and studies.</p>

					<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s comments like Sunder&rsquo;s,WR the elder&rsquo;s (black impostor?), Pragmatic Race Man&rsquo;s, Gina&rsquo;s, et al, that demonstrates the blinding ignorence of race realism. Simply put, race realism means there is a biological basis that makes races separate and distinct. Maybe this link can clear up any confusion for those with the addled minds?&#8221;</p>
<p>The average IQ of a race is, by definition, the average of a selection of individuals&rsquo; IQ from a given race, with that selection being considered a large and typical enough representation, and being, as written, a <strong>selection</strong> of members, not the entiretly of them. Looking at it completely alone, it is somewhat useless, as it does not state the distibution of the IQ scores   &mdash;   precisely the numbers that went into the average   &mdash;   or whether the numbers, the individuals, that did go into it were typical. In the IQ average, there might be more very low IQ individuals and a few very high IQ individuals, or more very low IQ individuals and a certain number of average individuals, and so forth, and the amount of IQ to distribute might be less than it should be, for the selection perhaps being unrepresentitive of the whole. Simply, considered without other information, an average is meaningless, and frankly, the only reason I see for averaging something is to step from having valuable hard data   &mdash;     actual data   &mdash;   into having a ficticious number that gains any legitimate meaning only when it is supplemented with additional data, foremost of which is the actual data that was its basis. </p>
<p>There are, of course, all sorts of illegitimate uses for averages, like, for instance, suggesting that because numerous averages of black IQ scores have returned the number of 85 that all blacks have an IQ of 85, which is what is essentially done by a large number of people here, who don&rsquo;t &#8220;deny&#8221;, in a way, that there are average and intelligent blacks, but who really, yeah, actually do, by always telling people who seriously state that not all blacks are unintelligent that they need to step out of their delusion and get their facts strait, citing average black IQ scores or overexteded personal experience. Perhaps not that much overextended, and perhaps well-suited to the black population they may be immersed in, but still so, that they would deny that there is not anywhere a black who is not unintelligent.</p>
<p>To continue, having stated what I have about averages, I am not about to suggest that what are called the &#8220;differences in race&#8221; are not real, and that blacks are just like whites and that the differences found are fabrications of whack-job racist scientists or so forth. A &#8220;race&#8221; is a group of individuals, and that there are differences between groups of individuals is a given, because there are differences between individuals themselves. Based on my personal experience and some credible scientific evidence   &mdash;   in which averages are less the basis and more comments on the truth    &mdash;   the black race, the group of individuals with black skin, certainly does differ from the white race, the group of individuals with white skin, in that the black race contains more individuals with lower IQ than does the white race; or, to describe it more accurately, the black race has a lower spectrum of intelligence, with a lower IQ ceiling and fewer individuals spread amongst the average and high IQ fields.</p>
<p>I acknowledge this, but the proper course of action when doing so, the proper course of action as regarding a group with more individuals who are less intelligent, and where the lower intelligence of the individual is the problem, is not to blindly take action against the whole group as though skin color were the offensive trait needing different treatment, or as though skin color correlated perfectly to lower IQ individuals, but to instead take action against the individuals who have lower IQs in that group   &mdash;   an action which only the effective impossibility of doing would negate as an option, and which, simply, is perfectly capable of being done, and which likely would do itself. And to describe what I would do to the individuals of lower intelligence as &#8220;taking action against them&#8221; is to make it seem some sort of militant expulsion, when it merely describes that I would have them treated exactly as they are instead of being wrongfully being held higher.</p>
<p>I am not an unreasonable race realism denier, and neither are the others mentioned. This site needs more of them, I think.</p>

<p>RK: And where did you get those figures? Smarter than 90% of whites? How do you know that? </p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s do the math.  I think that I am being very conservative when I say that to succeed as a professional mathematician one needs an IQ of at least 125.  (The good ones are probably closer to 150.)  By &#8220;professional mathematician&#8221; I mean someone who makes his living proving theorems and getting them published in refereed journals.  90% of whites have an IQ that is at or below 1.3 standard deviations above the white mean.  Using a mean of 102 IQ points and a standard deviation of 15, that means that 90% of whites have an IQ below 122.  So if we assume that a typical black mathematician meets the minimum requirement for his profession of having a 125 <span class="caps">IQ, </span>then yes he&rsquo;s smarter than 90% of the white people.<br>

&#8220;There is terror in numbers,&#8221; writes Darrell Huff in How to Lie with Statistics. And nowhere does this terror translate to blind acceptance of authority more than in the slippery world of averages, correlations, graphs, and trends. Huff sought to break through &#8220;the daze that follows the collision of statistics with the human mind&#8221; with this slim volume, first published in 1954. The book remains relevant as a wake-up call for people unaccustomed to examining the endless flow of numbers pouring from Wall Street, Madison Avenue, and everywhere else someone has an axe to grind, a point to prove, or a product to sell. &#8220;The secret language of statistics, so appealing in a fact-minded culture, is employed to sensationalize, inflate, confuse, and oversimplify,&#8221; warns Huff.</p>
<p>Although many of the examples used in the book are charmingly dated, the cautions are timeless. Statistics are rife with opportunities for misuse, from &#8220;gee-whiz graphs&#8221; that add nonexistent drama to trends, to &#8220;results&#8221; detached from their method and meaning, to statistics&rsquo; ultimate bugaboo  &mdash;  faulty cause-and-effect reasoning. Huff&rsquo;s tone is tolerant and amused, but no-nonsense. Like a lecturing father, he expects you to learn something useful from the book, and start applying it every day. Never be a sucker again, he cries!</p>
<p>Even if you can&rsquo;t find a source of demonstrable bias, allow yourself some degree of skepticism about the results as long as there is a possibility of bias somewhere. There always is.</p>
<p>Read How to Lie with Statistics. Whether you encounter statistics at work, at school, or in advertising, you&rsquo;ll remember its simple lessons. Don&rsquo;t be terrorized by numbers, Huff implores. &#8220;The fact is that, despite its mathematical base, statistics is as much an art as it is a science.&#8221;   &mdash;  Therese Littleton</p>

					<p>I&rsquo;d like to know the average IQ of black parents who home school. My guess is they&rsquo;re (with very very few exceptions) all at the upper-reaches (20%) of blacks&rsquo; IQ distribution.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Sunder said: &#8220;Looking at it completely alone, it is somewhat useless, as it does not state the distribution of the IQ scores  &mdash;  precisely the numbers that went into the average  &mdash;  or whether the numbers, the individuals, that did go into it were typical. [&hellip;] not all blacks are unintelligent that they need to step out of their delusion and get their facts strait, citing average black IQ scores or overexteded personal experience&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunder, you seem very sincere but your contentions are a bit askew. 1.) Nobody here is saying there aren&rsquo;t any intelligent blacks. 2.) IQ tests in the <span class="caps">USA </span>has been taken over a long period of time, they&rsquo;re extensive, and the overall results are consistent; there&rsquo;s very little variation. 3.) There are good explanations why blacks and whites with the same IQ produce different results in real life. Whites with the same IQ as blacks invariably outperform them&hellip;and the reason isn&rsquo;t due to racism.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the facts:</p>

<p>I account for this as I always do. These are red herrings and very rare occurences. I respect and admire successful Blacks, but to point out one example out of many is a baseless argument and just distracts attention from the real issue. </p>
<p>By the way, Benjamin Banneker as well as countless other successful Blacks, were all greatly influenced by Whites. Go read up on Benjamin Benneker.</p>

<p>Robert Kelly:  <i>So youre assuming again, eh? I was hoping you wouldn&rsquo;t be resorting to that anymore. Thats about as naive as anything Ive read on here so far, except for your accepting the chicanery of our black imposter.</i></p>
<p><i>If you think these blacks are getting accreditation because they&rsquo;re able to do the course work, rather than as an affirmative action gimme, then I&rsquo;d suggest you go back and read some of their articles that have appeared here and elsewhere, that is, if you are capable of making an objective judgment.</i></p>
<p>It is you, not I, who fail the objectivity test.  Sure, we know that there are blacks of limited competence placed in their jobs to meet affirmative action quotas.  It is fair to say that entire university departments (gender studies, black studies, hispanic studies, etc.) have been created as intellectual sandboxes for the employment of people of the proper gender, sexual orientation, or race.  They serve a purely political purpose.</p>
<p>But, you can only go so far in faking your ability as a mathematician.  You either produce theorems that get accepted by refereed journals or you don&rsquo;t.  And unlike the journals of women&rsquo;s studies or black studies, the referees are mostly white and Asian men who have little patience for trivial or unimportant results.</p>
<p>Now, to name a few specific black mathematicians.  There is Kate Okikiolu, whose publication list is here.  There is <a href="http://www.math.gatech.edu/~gangbo/" rel="nofollow">Wilfrid Gangbo</a>, whose publication list is <a href="http://www.math.gatech.edu/%7Egangbo/publications/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  There is <a href="http://www.math.ucsb.edu/~agboola/" rel="nofollow">Adebisi Agboola</a>, whose publication list is <a href="http://www.math.ucsb.edu/~agboola/papers/papers.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  There is mathematical physicists <a href="http://physics.usc.edu/Faculty/Johnson/" rel="nofollow">Clifford Johnson</a>, whose publication list is <a href="http://physics.usc.edu/~johnson1/publications.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>I could go on but you get my drift.  Are you seriously going to claim that people who write papers like &#8220;Wrapped D-Branes as <span class="caps">BPS</span> Monopoles: The Moduli Space Perspective&#8221; or &#8220;On p-adic height pairings and locally free classgroups of Hopf orders&#8221; have an IQ less than 125?  I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll insist that these academics be placed in some psychologist&rsquo;s lab and given proper IQ tests before you&rsquo;ll believe that they have IQs above 100, but for me the proof is in the pudding   &mdash;   it is obvious that these are smart people.</p>
<p>RK: <i>But what does a tiny handful of blacks who score in the range of 120-125 have to do with the fact that &#8220;a wealth of evidence from all over the world unequivocally proves that blacks cannot compete on an advanced level no matter what the circumstances are.&#8221;  Is it necessary for me to include &#8220;most&#8221; in with that statement in order for it to be understood?</i></p>
<p>Yes, it would be helpful it you used accurate speech and included the &#8220;most&#8221; qualifier.  Especially in the context, in which you expressed incredulity that two home schooled black kids could actually get into Harvard on their own merits.  And no, those mathematicians&rsquo; IQs aren&rsquo;t 120-125, they are almost certainly well above that.  As I said, the 125 cutoff I used is very conservative.</p>
<p>RK: <i>To me, this level of debate is a waste of time.</i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m inclined to agree, since you seem to think that no race realist should ever acknowledge that there are some pretty damn smart black people out there, even if there are more very smart whites and Asians.<br>

<p>You see what I mean?  There again you&rsquo;re drawing an erroneous conclusion from something that was never raised as an issue.</p>
<p>You haven&rsquo;t proven anything, old guy.  You&rsquo;ve just expanded on your original blunder, and you&rsquo;ve tried to divert the debate to items of no consequence, without admitting you were wrong to begin with, which you were and you know it.</p>
<p>Your original rant was completely uncalled for and it had absolutely nothing to do with any issue I raised, and please&hellip;.don&rsquo;t give me this business of omitting a qualifier when using the word &#8220;blacks,&#8221; as an excuse in failing to understand something pointed out that involved blacks as a group.  You know full well what was meant, because the same phraseology is used on here time and again.  So don&rsquo;t pretend otherwise.

<p>WR: &#8220;Now, to name a few specific black mathematicians. There is Kate Okikiolu, whose publication list is here. There is Wilfrid Gangbo, whose publication list is here. There is Adebisi Agboola, whose publication list is here. There is mathematical physicists Clifford Johnson, whose publication list is here.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if what you&rsquo;re referring to is accurate or not, but I don&rsquo;t care.   My reference was to the fact that there are <span class="caps">MANY </span>blacks who are given their accreditation via <span class="caps">AA, </span>and <span class="caps">THAT&rsquo;S </span>an absolute fact.  That doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do with the above allegations, true or not.</p>
<p>And your initial act of white disunity was absolutely deplorable and was made far worse by your attempts at diversion.  Try as you may you can&rsquo;t get around that.</p>
<p>White disunity caused by a small number of malcontents is what <br>
has placed whites in the position they are today and is the <span class="caps">MAIN </span>reason whites can&rsquo;t come together as a group right now.</p>
