						<p>Some American companies &mdash; facing a crackdown on hiring illegal immigrants and difficulties in using temporaryworker programs &mdash; are venturing south to solve their labor woes, to Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>Puerto Rico is part of the United States, so its residents are American citizens.</p>
<p>It has been the focus of recruiting efforts in the past, especially for bilingual police officers and teachers, but the latest trend includes a greater variety of industries, such as hotels and resorts, hospitals, and meat-processing operations.</p>
<p>Luis De Rosa, president of the Puerto Rico Chamber of Commerce of South Florida, said requests from mainland companies to find workers on the island have increased significantly in the past three months, especially for seasonal employees.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Recent inquiries include those from construction companies, hotels, vacation resorts, and hospitals looking for nurses, he said.</p>
<p>De Rosa said it&rsquo;s a match made in heaven: Stateside companies get good, legal workers and Puerto Ricans earn money that they need. The unemployment rate on the island is about 10 percent, twice as high as on the U.S. mainland, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cargill Meat Solutions, a pork processor in Beardstown Ill., began recruiting workers from Puerto Rico last year.</p>
<p>They now have dozens of workers from the island, according to various news reports.</p>
<p>The Aspen Skiing Company, which operates four resorts in the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, was in a bind last fall when a problem with its applications for H-2B visas for temporary workers left it without a complete staff for the tourist season. The solution: a recruiting trip to San Juan, the capital of Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>Jeff Hanle, a spokesman for the company, said it was the first time that it had looked for workers on the island.</p>
<p>About 20 Puerto Rican men and women were recruited to work as maids, maintenance workers, and other hotel jobs.</p>
<p>They were all given discounted housing, much like other seasonal employees, Hanle said.</p>
<p>The situation was not ideal, however. The Puerto Ricans had a hard time adjusting to the snow and ice, making it unclear whether the company will use them as a &#8220;long-term solution,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It could be the start of a trend, similar to the one that brought thousands of Puerto Rican workers to the garment factories in New York and other cities in the 1950s, he added.</p>
<p>Those workers were vital to the apparel industry and replaced immigrants from Eastern Europe, Chishti added.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Chishti also said that Puerto Rico, with its limited labor pool, cannot begin to solve all the U.S. needs for workers. Puerto Rico has 3.9 million people, of whom 20 percent are under 15 years old.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the United States has an estimated 12 million illegal immigrants, many of them working, according to the Department of Homeland Security.</p>
<p>De Rosa, with the Puerto Rican Chamber of Commerce, said that the recruitment of workers in Puerto Rico is likely to escalate as the government continues to crack down on illegal immigration.</p>

<p>As I was reading this, I was wondering what would be the incentive for natives to leave Puerto Rico and then I got to the above sentence.</p>
<p>I maintain we don&rsquo;t have a labor shortage. What we have is a wage and benefits shortage which used to be supplied by these industries.</p>
<p>The only question is how low can wages and benefits fall before we can call this the new slavery.<br>

					<p>Good luck with this! Puerto Rico is not known for producing a vast number of people with an intense work ethic - just ask most white employers in the Northeastern <span class="caps">US. </span></p>
<p>Those Puerto Ricans who <span class="caps">ARE </span>motivated generally prefer to stay on the island.</p>

					<p>America better wake up and realize that this is a running battle that is never going to end. Businesses will <span class="caps">ALWAYS </span>utilize cheap labor until it&rsquo;s tapped out and then move on to the next available source. Until we make it no longer cost effective for them to do so, the battle will rage on.</p>

					<p>I&rsquo;m not sure, but I think the Puerto Ricans get some sort of a break on their income taxes ( do they pay income tax? ). This would make them even cheaper to hire.</p>

<p>Didn&rsquo;t there used to be a free Puerto Rico movement that wanted to secede from the United States?   Can we have a vote to set these people free? </p>
<p>Can we just <span class="caps">ONCE </span>think about what would be good for the citizens of our 50 states? Can we just free the real American <span class="caps">TAX PAYERS </span>from the endless welfare and other transfer payments to Puerto Rico?  Why do American politicians insist on standing on the shores of America shoveling piles of cash into the waves?  </p>

					<p>Fiorello LaGuardia brought Puerto Ricans to New York to win his mayoral bid.  It worked.  New York was innundated with thousands of Puerto Ricans.  He was never penalized for his actions either.  The American people were penalized with a slew of new welfare recipients and criminal Mestizos (albeit, a few were decent hard-working people - a very few).  Well, we all know the rest of the story.<br>

					<p>Actually Puerto Rico did have a referendum on independence,in the late 80&rsquo;s I believe.  Unfortunately, they voted overwhelmingly to keep receiving all the bennies they get from the Federal Gubmint rather than take on the daunting challenge of making Puerto Rico a financially independent country.  Of course, the referendum was for the wrong people.  Should have asked the Americans who pay for this worthless relic of Yankee Imperialism.</p>

					<p>  There are strong tax incentives for corporations to re-locate to Puerto Rico.  If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, companies pay reduced income tax down there. It isn&rsquo;t the workers, it&rsquo;s the tax structure. Corporations will go anywhere to maximize profits. As to hiring Puerto Ricans stateside, companies make affirmative action quotas and get cheap workers. </p>

					<p>&#8220;A match made in heaven&#8221;? Not the after life location I was thinking. Hmmm: The 1950&rsquo;s?. I seem to recall an incident where a bunch of those heavenly creatures broke into the congress and shot up the place. I guess we shouldn&rsquo;t talk about that should we? During my only trip to that God forsaken place, back in the 60&rsquo;s with the military, we were exposed to a lot of yankee go home grafitti, one finger waves, and one could only guess what they were screaming at us. Thank God we never gave them statehood. </p>

<p>Yes, the above story is really nothing new. It&rsquo;s been going on for many, many years, this tax-haven thing. Many companies have taken advantage of it.</p>
<p>I once had a friend who was a manager of a large American business there.  I recall that he commented to me that the corruption and pay-offs were unbelievable.  Very much in the Latin tradition, everyone had his hand out and was demanding a cut. You couldn&rsquo;t run a business without paying everyone off.</p>
<p>So what they save in taxes, I suppose they lose in pay-offs. Not to mention inefficiency and the general Latin attitude.</p>

<p><br>
These immigrants were also a huge boon to the aerosol paint industry. Prior to the mass importation of Puerto Ricans to <span class="caps">NYC </span>in the &rsquo;50s, the problem of graffiti was extremely minor   &mdash;   limited mostly to the occasional swear word scribbled in the occasional public bathroom. It was the Ricans who started the moronic and destructive social phenomenon we now know as &#8220;tagging.&#8221; </p>
<p>First, it was <span class="caps">NYC&rsquo;</span>s vacant buildings that got sprayed with the colorful gibberish&hellip; and then the city&rsquo;s occupied buildings&hellip; and then its subways&hellip; Eventually, the idiotic trend spread to blacks&hellip; and then to whites&hellip; and then finally took hold throughout <span class="caps">THE ENTIRE WESTERN WORLD. </span></p>
<p>Bringing these people to your town won&rsquo;t help anybody but your local hardware store. <br>

					<p>&#8220;Actually, I think Puerto Ricans are more Mulatto than Mestizo (see Roberto Clemente). They are a blend of Spanish, African, and Indian,  but I don&rsquo;t know what the word for that is.&#8221;<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..<br><br>
That is true. They are a mixture of the three &hellip; but not in equal parts.  It is important to bear that in mind.    They are probably  (just making an offhand guess here) something like  1/10th Indian,  3/10ths black African (including a few North African Moors sent there as slaves in the early years, the 1500s), and  6/10ths Spanish, including  a few other European elements (especially in the upper classes).   There are, for instance, many French names among the ruling element, evidently descendents of French planters who fled Haiti or the other French islands.   </p>
<p>You have the further factor of class   &mdash;   as in all Latin American countries (of which Puerto is one:  in its culture, attitudes, and demography).   It all depends which social class you&rsquo;re talking about.  The upper classes are virtually 100% white, while the bottom-most classes tend to be very dark   &mdash;   almost universally so.  The further down you go, the darker they get. This is just as in Brazil, or anywhere below the Rio Grande.</p>
<p>And, as elsewhere (in Latin America),  they proudly proclaim that they have no &#8220;racism&#8221;.   Well, perhaps it&rsquo;s not so self-conscious or of the same type as in North America, but  a foreigner looks around and sees evidence of it everywhere!  They claim it&rsquo;s only coincidental that the whites are the haves and the blacks are the have-nots, but racism is not involved.   It&rsquo;s amazing how they can be so blind to it among themselves.   Typical Latin denial and hypocrisy!</p>
<p>By the way, I don&rsquo;t know what the word is either  (for the mixture of the three races). If I knew it,  I can&rsquo;t remember.  They have many such words (more than in English) and they&rsquo;re not inhibited about using them, as we are. And I&rsquo;m sure there must be a word for it in Portuguese.  In Brazil there are all kinds of mixtures, each with a name.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..<br><br>
I don&rsquo;t have statistics at hand, but Puerto Rico is quite wealthy and advanced,  compared to the rest of Latin America (outside Chile and Argentina).  They enjoy  the benefits of US public health standards, post office, and so on. You can see this difference very dramatically   &mdash;   even from the air   &mdash;   when you fly from PR to the Dominican Republic, just next door. The absence of roads, lack of buildings and development, the many thatched shacks instead of houses, dirt streets instead of pavement,  contrasts strongly with the development that you see below in Puerto Rico.  However PR is poor by comparison to the US mainland, and probably poorer than the poorest American state.  But by Latin standards, it&rsquo;s well to do.</p>
<p>As far as independence goes, I have always maintained that any referendum or plebiscite should consult the wishes of <span class="caps">ALL </span>the parties concerned.   As in any marriage (which is what this union would be), did you ever hear of any wedding where the consent of only one party was asked, while the consent of the other was automatically assumed without that party being allowed to speak for him/herself?   When you think of it, that is bizarre!   </p>
<p>And our &#8220;leaders&#8221; love to boast of our democratic traditions that they want to force on the rest of the world!</p>
