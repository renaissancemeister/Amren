						<p>When members of an anti-illegal immigration group offered to sponsor litter cleanup on local roads, they never imagined California officials would offer them an Adopt-a-Highway stretch near a Border Patrol checkpoint on Interstate 5, the main artery carrying illegal migrants north from the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>
<p>On Friday, lawyers for the San Diego Minutemen told a federal judge that the state had no right to rescind the offer after state legislators complained to the California Department of Transportation. The group asked that its blue Adopt-a-Highway sign be put back where it stood without incident for about six weeks until the agency removed it in January.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were moved to silence our message in response to pressure from the open border advocates and the Latino caucus,&#8221; said Minutemen attorney Robert Fuselier. &#8220;It all comes down to one thing: We can&rsquo;t have our speech because if we do, people who don&rsquo;t like it might become unruly and unlawful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Attorneys for the state contend the sign was removed because of concerns that demonstrators or vandals could create safety hazards for the 160,000 drivers who pass the checkpoint daily and for Minutemen volunteers collecting litter by the roadside.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>State legislators, meanwhile, renamed the contested stretch of highway the &#8220;Rosa Parks Highway&#8221; in honor of the black woman arrested in 1955 when she refused to give up her seat to a white man on a city bus in Montgomery, Ala.</p>
<p>California assemblywoman Lori Saldana of San Diego said she was considering legislation that would stop the transportation department from accepting new sponsorships until it develops standards governing who qualified to participate in the highway adoption program.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want them to say what constitutes a legitimate group,&#8221; Saldana said after the hearing. &#8220;Do we want these people allowed on a highway near a security checkpoint?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}<br/>

<p>What an incredibly stupid statement! The Minutemen are not the ones breaking the law! &#8220;These people&#8221; are taxpaying citizens of the United States who want the law enforced and have volunteered, without pay, to assist the overwhelmed Border Patrol. They are hardly the ones you need to be &#8220;concerned&#8221; about them being near a checkpoint. </p>

			<p>A fight between rival groups of black and Latino students at Locke High School quickly escalated into a campus-wide melee Friday, with as many as 600 students brawling until police restored calm with billy clubs.</p>
<p>So what do they do? The state names the highway after a Black women. I&rsquo;m sure the Hispanics are going to love that one.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;We were moved to silence our message in response to pressure from the open border advocates and the Latino caucus,&rdquo; said Minutemen attorney Robert Fuselier. &ldquo;It all comes down to one thing: We can&rsquo;t have our speech because if we do, people who don&rsquo;t like it might become unruly and unlawful.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br/>
This whole business of restricting speech that might make certain ethnic groups &#8220;become unruly and unlawful&#8221; is terrifying in its implications. Now that CA&rsquo;s latino population has hit 50%   &mdash;   and is of course projected only to expand further   &mdash;   it will simply become impossible to say ANYTHING these people don&rsquo;t like. Especially if there&rsquo;s the constant threat of VIOLENCE every time they see or hear something that &#8220;offends&#8221; them. </p>
<p>If certain groups simply CAN&rsquo;T be persuaded to stop being &#8220;unruly and unlawful&#8221; this whole project called America will   &mdash;   after 200 years of spectacular success   &mdash;   finally FAIL. When our Founding Fathers wrote our founding documents, they were gambling that the American people would be mature enough to appreciate and to execute the unprecedented new rights and freedoms being proposed. And as long as the brave experiment of Washington, Jefferson, et al, was being carried out by a European-derived populace like them, then their gamble paid off handsomely: it DID work. People COULD live in freedom and behave themselves (well, most of the time) without the iron fist of monarchy constantly threatening them. </p>
<p>But if you attempt the same social experiment with a NON-Euro populace   &mdash;   like, say, indigenous, pre-industrial mestizos from Central America   &mdash;   well, with a drastic cast change like that, there&rsquo;s no guarantee the American experiment will work so well. </p>
<p>In fact, every indication screams that it WON&rsquo;T. Every indication is that they&rsquo;re simply not capable of functioning with the high levels of personal freedom   &mdash;   and personal responsibility   &mdash;   that come with being American. I don&rsquo;t think they can do it. I think if they could do it, we would have seen more evidence of it by now   &mdash;   both in the US and throughout Latin America. Instead what we&rsquo;ve seen from them is hundreds of years of strongmen, military dictatorships, and bloody coups d&rsquo;etat. Once they&rsquo;re in charge here, what reason is there to believe they&rsquo;ll behave like us   &mdash;   rather than like their same old corrupt, trigger-happy selves? </p>
<p>This wholesale hispanification of our country has to stop. Otherwise America&rsquo;s tombstone will read: &#8220;Built by whites, killed by nonwhites.&#8221; </p>

			<p>Well, everything in society comes down to who has the power and calls the shots. It&rsquo;s all about whose ox is being gored and whose purpose is being served.  What&rsquo;s good for one is bad for another. Which will prevail?</p>
<p>Who is in charge in San Diego? Who is (or is becoming) the majority (ie. ruling) group there? Who holds the  political/financial strings? Who controls the vote, and who manipulates what the voters think? That will determine who holds the ultimate &#8220;truth&#8221; and who is &#8220;right&#8221; versus who is &#8220;wrong&#8221;.</p>
<p>That will determine who sits in the halls of power and makes the laws; and who sits behind bars, reviled by &#8220;decent society&#8221; and branded as criminals. It will determine who gets the statues, the avenues and parks named for them, and who gets (after life) lifted to saintly status;  versus who gets scathing mention in the history books as society&rsquo;s degenerates and monsters.</p>
<p>Who was &#8220;right&#8221;? &hellip; George Washington or George the III?  Robespierre or Louis XVI?  Lenin or Czar Nicholas?  It all depends from which side you see it.</p>
<p>Are those who oppose the illegals &#8220;legitimate&#8221;?   Of course they&rsquo;re not! Not according to the illegals, that is.   The Minutemen are bigots, racists, and criminals! (they say).    If up to the illegals, the Minutemen should be banned. According to the Minutemen, it is  precisely the opposite as to who are the &#8220;razistas&#8221; and criminals.   Who is right?  Well, whose interests are being served?</p>
<p>If drug lords and prostitutes ran the show, their products would be advertised on evening television.  (We&rsquo;re getting closer to that btw, but that&rsquo;s another story not for here.)</p>
<p>And if the Mafia wielded sufficient power, it would be forbidden to criticize them or speak of them except in terms of lavish praise   &mdash;   or even to mention their existence at all. (That&rsquo;s also another story.)</p>
<p>And so on.</p>
<p>Most of these groups can only dream of such social power.   But, little by little, as the solidarity of the white European majority is whittled away and dissolved, some of these resentful groups are getting their way.</p>
<p>Demography is destiny; and numbers = power. </p>
<p>Of course, power isn&rsquo;t entirely about numbers alone. It can be (as in many countries) about who controls the military. It can be (in industrial/commercial countries) about who controls the money. But ultimately,  weapons or money regardless, it still boils down to the weight of sheer numbers. In the long run, no amount of money or soldiers can restrain a riotous, angry, resentful population whose numbers have gotten out of control   &mdash;   as an endless line of kings and dictators have learned to their grief throughout history.</p>
