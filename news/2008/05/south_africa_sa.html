						<p>South Africa&rsquo;s security chief on Friday accused rightwingers linked to the former apartheid government of fanning xenophobic violence that has spread to Cape Town, the second largest city and tourist centre.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Manala Manzini, head of the National Intelligence Agency, told Reuters people linked to former apartheid security forces were stoking the violence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Definitely there is a third hand involved. There is a deliberate effort, orchestrated, well-planned,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have information to the effect that elements that were involved in the pre-1994 election violence are in fact the same elements that have re-started contacts with people that they used in the past.&#8221;</p>
<p>Manzini said some of the violence emanated from worker hostels where Zulu migrants traditionally live.</p>
<p>Much of the township bloodshed in the final years of apartheid involved brutal clashes between supporters of the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) and the African National Congress, which has been in power since the end of white rule.</p>
<p>IFP fighters were widely believed to be clandestinely sponsored by the apartheid government.</p>

											<p>
							<i>AFP, May 23, 2008</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>A wave of anti-immigrant violence in South Africa spread to Cape Town on Friday, even as troops and police appeared to have quelled the unrest in the hotspot of Johannesburg.</p>
<p>Police reported attacks against immigrants and foreign-owned shops in a slum area of picturesque Cape Town.</p>
<p>The southern coastal city is a major draw for tourists and had thus far been spared the mob violence seen in Johannesburg.</p>
<p>At least 42 have been killed, more than 500 arrested and 16,000 displaced in the province of Gauteng, which includes Johannesburg and the capital Pretoria, since unrest broke out 12 days ago.</p>
<p>Police spokesman for the Cape Town area Billy Jones said a public meeting to address the danger of xenophobia in the Dunoon slum area 20 kilometres (12 miles) north of the city degenerated into violence on Thursday evening.</p>
<p>&#8220;Groups within the crowd started to loot shops owned by Zimbabweans and other foreigners,&#8221; he told AFP, saying 500 had since fled the area and were staying in community centres.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some people were assaulted, but mostly shops were looted.&#8221;</p>
<p>Police also reported pockets of overnight unrest in Durban in the KwaZulu Natal region, where an unidentified foreigner was shot, and in North West province where two Pakistanis were stabbed.</p>
<p>Pakistanis were also targeted in Free State on Thursday. Twenty two people were arrested after a group of people were seen throwing stones at their shops.</p>
<p>&#8220;The police are on high alert and we will not tolerate any violence,&#8221; said North West police spokesman Peter du Plessis. &#8220;What we are doing is identifying the areas where the foreigners are staying and then patrolling those areas.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Johannesburg, the raging violence of the last week and a half appeared to have been brought under control by police bolstered by specialist units trained in public order and the army.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s quiet,&#8221; said police spokesman for the Johannesburg area Govindsamy Mariemuthoo.</p>
<p>For the first time, soldiers deployed on Johannesburg&rsquo;s streets on Thursday to help stem the tide of violence that has seen mobs of armed youths attack foreigners in poor areas around the city.</p>
<p>About 200 soldiers assisted police with morning arrest and search operations in central Johannesburg on Thursday and remain on standby to offer back-up and logistical support.</p>
<p>Spokesman for the defence forces General Kwena Mangope told AFP Friday there had been no further army deployments.</p>
<p>President Thabo Mbeki bowed to pressure to call in the army on Wednesday after a request for support from the police force.</p>
<p>Foreigners in South Africa, many of whom have fled economic meltdown in neighbouring Zimbabwe, are being blamed for sky-high crime rates and depriving locals of jobs.</p>
<p>The violence, which has done untold damage to South African&rsquo;s reputation as the &#8220;Rainbow Nation,&#8221; is also taking its toll on the country&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>Unions and several mining companies reported Thursday that gold mines around Johannesburg, the country&rsquo;s economic heartland, had been hit by the unrest, with employees failing to show up for work.</p>
<p>South Africa&rsquo;s tourism industry has also warned of the impact on visitor numbers and a farming group raised alarm Thursday about the impact of xenophobia in the agricultural sector.</p>
<p>Politicians are increasingly blaming criminals for the anti-immigrant violence, as well as the insanitary and lawless conditions found in slum areas.</p>
<p>But a number of rights groups have said the government has failed to address the problem of xenophobia, with isolated incidents of attacks against foreigners reported since the end of the 1990s.</p>
<p>&#8220;These unpardonable acts bring to the fore the need to intensify the implementation of government&rsquo;s efforts to eradicate poverty and reinforce our housing and service delivery programmes,&#8221; Intelligence Minister Ronnie Kasrils told the National Assembly Friday, SAPA news agency reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must better educate our people in tolerance, resolutely dispelling any erroneous perceptions about foreign nationals, which are fuelled in circumstances of relative socio-economic disadvantage,&#8221; he added.<br>

			<p>If I have this straight, a country that has seen 20,000 murders in the last year and has the world&rsquo;s highest rape rate somehow requires a hidden, sinister band of provacateurs to &#8220;incite&#8221; violence.  Manzini appears to be packing his pipe a little too tight.</p>

			<p>We lived in SA until 1999 when we escaped seeing what the future was to be and is now going to be.  Another Marxist hell-hole.  The ex-terrorist, Marxist African National Congress will be blaming Apartheid for many years as the country sinks to Zimbabwe levels.  It is to be expected as they fail to administer and govern competently and was forecast.</p>
<p>The current problems have been caused by the despotic rule of &#8220;Robbing Mugabe&#8221; in Zimbabwe and compounded by all the African leaders not censuring him, especially President Mbeki of South Africa.  </p>
<p>Mbeki&rsquo;s continued lies about engaging in constructive talks with Mugabe in the last few years, meaning that he never publicly censured the murdering genocidal maniac, has led to an estimated (official figures) 3-million black Zimbabweans fleeing to South Africa so they would not starve after Mugabe stole the White&rsquo;s legally owned farms that fed Southern Africa for many decades.</p>
<p>The South African government needs challenging in the UN to stop blaming others for their own actions that have led to the current terrible murders and xenophobia.  It is a published fact that many times more blacks have been illegally killed since the end of Apartheid (16 years) than were ever killed by the Apartheid government in the 44 years of its existence.  So who is going to broadcast this in the UN?</p>
<p>STOP ALL THE KILLING NOW, African National Congress / SA Govt.</p>

			<p>Of course it is only as a result of apartheid that these peaceful South Africans are emulating Chaka Zulu. Is is only because of apartheid that they are raping 5 months old babies. This may sound like a sick joke but was one of the reasons given recently to explain the thousands of child rapes. Americans of all people should know the long-lingering effects oppression on blacks, after 150 years they have not yet overcome slavery. The fact that the Russian serfs have not suffered similar effects is because it is  a scientific fact that cold - Russia is cold - freezes the oppression gene. Serfdom was abolished at about the same time as slavery.</p>

			<p>The black South African government is loath to blame their own people for these attacks, and the few remaining whites are a handy bogeyman.  Besides, this demagoguery will only grease the wheels for Mugabe-like farm, land and property confiscation.</p>
<p>BTW, how ironic is it that black ZA natives are thumping black immigrants?  All the blacks in what is now ZA are descended from black immigrants.  Whites who settled ZA found it was virtually uninhabited, and when whites made something of it, blacks strolled in (with no small help from the white cheap labor fifth column), then after awhile complained about how the whites stole all this white-created prosperity from them.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The South African currency fell sharply earlier this week on the back of the violence before partly recovering on Thursday. <br>
The violence comes amid power shortages and growing discontent which have also rattled investors.&#8221;</p>
<p>The country is in the process of imploding right before our eyes.  We are witnessing a dramatic part of history, which is revealing yet another failed black run government.</p>

I don&rsquo;t know how much longer they&rsquo;ll be safe though with the hispanic influx. I&rsquo;m toying with the idea of leaving the country but there&rsquo;s so many concerns like finding good medical care and eventually me or my wife might need to be sent to a nursing home.   </p>

			<p>At the fall of civilization in South Africa in 1994, the &#8220;slum area&#8221; of Du Noon was a dairy farm. I live a few miles from there.  The ANC government built the slum from scratch as part of their &#8220;reconstruction and development plan&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Xenophobia&#8221; is just the government&rsquo;s buzz-word for a very old African institution formerly known as tribalism.  Nothing new or historic about what&rsquo;s going on here.  I&rsquo;ve been watching this process since the Belgian Congo in 1961.  So, with the greatest respect, I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m not as compassionate as Brian Deller;  these people got the government, and the society, that they asked for and deserve.  Go for it, guys, kill each other ad lib.</p>

			<p>28 years on Mugabe is still blaming Zimbabwe&rsquo;s problems on Rhodesian&rsquo;s seeking to roll back the magnificent revolutionary progress achieved by Zanu-PF.The ANC in South Africa has at least another 14 years worth of blaming Apartheid for all the problems occurring as a result of their incompetence and corruption.I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll ever get over,it such is the inherent deficiency of the average practitioner of ubuntu.</p>

<p>Yet another example of how &#8220;Liberal&#8221; theories of &#8220;noble minorities&#8221; that want peace and friendship for all distort the truth.</p>

<p>If you are indeed still living in South Africa, and have memories going back to 1961, then I think you are someone who could provide us Amren readers with a lot of interesting information and insights. I hope you can find the time to put thoughts and observations to paper, and maybe submit it to the Amren magazine for future publication.<br>

			<p>Africa is a barbarous continent inhabited by barbarians.The present &#8220;xenophobia&#8221; should be surprising to none. Brutality, rape, looting and murder are inbred characteristics, cultural norms.</p>
<p>Corruption, graft and repression are the African &#8220;big man&rsquo;s&#8221; stock in trade.</p>
<p>Those whites still living in Africa should not be surprised that their leaders are not little Englishmen, with Eurocentric morals and values.</p>
<p>They come from a long line of amoral sociopaths, and to expect civilised norms from them is, simply, unreasonable.</p>

<p> Mikey, you can see our future now. Look to Brazil with its high miscegenation, astronomical violent crime rate, huge disparities of rich and poor, environmental degradation and corrupt government.   And yet, even Brazil can, at times, be a fun place and the women are friendly and agreeable. Don&rsquo;t expect it to be that way for the United States.   We will be a Brazil without the fun &mdash; a grim, humorless Soviet style Brazil! </p>

			<p>For all those who are interested in the true recent history of sub-Saharan Africa as written by someone who still lives there, take a look at www.africancrisis.co.za/Home.php?Cat=0&.  Edited by Jan Lamprecht, he has written books and sells others very cheaply (even with the US $ being down a bit at this time)forecasting years ago what would happen and has and what is yet to come.  There is a great chance of a military coup there with the current SA Defence force (99% black) being riddled with 150 to HIV/AIDS, hepatitis as well as many other health problems including morbid obesity (officers) amongst its &#8220;affirmative action ranks&#8221; now.  The SA Govt. is even said to be trying to encourage back into the forces the older white former professionals who were kicked out when the ANC Govt.took over, the same stock as those who beat the Cuban Army and their black communist terrorists to a pulp in Angola in 1976.  The current forces cannot fulfil their duties with the existing staff of all ranks.  Tanks and other mechanical equipment are broken down due to poor servicing and lack of knowledge/skills in such great numbers that a coup, properly planned and executed could succeed.   No wonder the ANC Marxist Govt. is so paranoiac at this time and it can only get worse for them.<br>
Incidentally, my children and grandchildren still live there with their white African extended families whose ancestors were there 200 years ago so I wish for peace there.   The actual unlawful killings (murders) in SA are far higher than the official government statistics state as they play them down to try and make the country look good.  According to the South African Medical Council who have the actual numbers for the morgues, they AVERAGE 85 such deaths a day (every day) or over 31 000 a year.  It has been calculated by one SA person who has researched the facts that SA is 16 TIMES more dangerous to live in than the USA.  </p>
<p>So settle down folks in the USA, things are not so bad after all, or are they?  Another statistic is that one in three women (females, as some are only babies) will be raped at least once in their lifetime, but that is normal there now.</p>
<p>It was forecast by Nostradamus that a big war would occur in the Middle East about now and the anti-Christ will be beaten so badly they will take decades to them rise again.  So take heart.</p>
<p>God bless America and do not feel bad about Iraq.  The good Samaritan did not walk by on the other side of the road (to avoid the genocides in Iraq) did he?<br>

<p>I think the movie Mad Max shows a time after a nuclear war had taken place. One of the most interesting stories is one where Australia is captured alien colonists, with both sides eventually having a cease fire.  </p>
