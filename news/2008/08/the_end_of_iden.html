<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>In these times I am rarely surprised by most notions put forth by political pundits. But I must admit to being taken aback by the suppositions of Terry Michael in &#8220;Obama as the End of Identity Politics as We&rsquo;ve Known Them&#8221; (<a href="http://www.reason.com/news/show/126944.html" target="new"><i>Reason</i> magazine,</a> 6/10/08). Michael appears to believe that under an Obama presidency, we soon will be on &#8220;the beginnings of a journey away from the Great Society mind-set of the Democratic Party&#8221; and on a course that will put &#8220;the Jesse Jacksons, the Al Sharptons, and the white identity politics liberals out of business.&#8221;</p>
<p>Michael envisions the end of what he calls the peddling of black victimology, which will mean no more demands for &#8220;diversity training, minority contracts, or other tribal reparations.&#8221; For Michael, the myth that minorities cannot assimilate &#8220;dies when a majority white nation selects a leader of color.&#8221; How logical he is; how well-reasoned is his thesis. Yet it is clear that he has no clue as to who benefits, among blacks, from that &#8220;diversity training&#8221; and those &#8220;minority contracts.&#8221; It is the most powerful and influential who are recipients of victimology largesse.</p>
<p>Anyone who thinks that Al Sharpton or Jesse Jackson are going to be put out of business does not comprehend the manner in which these two men, and others like them, are protected by prosperous, influential middle class black elites &mdash; the major beneficiaries of most entitlement programs. Sharpton and his fake rowdiness is viewed by this middle class as their ace-in-the-hole. He is the go-to man, in charge of appearing to control the steam, so to speak.</p>
<p>It is the prosperous black bourgeoisie, who grew prosperous by fostering the &#8220;victim&#8221; mentality among blacks, who are most responsible for the current state of the underclass &mdash; for a multitude of reasons. Don&rsquo;t be fooled by the sporadic concern sometimes shown by members of the upper classes, like Bill Cosby, Juan Williams, and others. Their scolding proclamations to the lower class are due mainly to the embarrassment caused by scurrilous black behavior, which they feel reflects upon them.</p>
<p>Every time Reverend Al does his in-your-face, tough guy routine, sending out signals that the steam pipes could burst at any moment, a capitulation takes place, and well-behaved, non-threatening black elites reap the rewards and bounty. This symbiotic relationship will not come to an end with the entry of a black man into the White House.</p>
<p>As for those &#8220;other tribal reparations&#8221; that Michael speaks of, I&rsquo;d like to see Chief Obama dare to be dismissive of the items on that long laundry list of grievances that blacks keep compiling. In order to avoid another public verbal joust, as he recently engaged in with those Florida hecklers, Obama will have to be cautious that none of his words be interpreted as a rejection of the slavery Reparations crusade. This crusade, too, has a high representation of middle class blacks within it, especially in academia, and these folks are not going away.</p>
<p>Those who fantasize that under President Barack Obama there will be less of a push for &#8220;diversity&#8221; and affirmative action policies favorable to selected groups and a diminished call for whites to mend their evil racist ways, are setting themselves up for future disappointment. Along these lines, writer Jim Pinkerton offers an insightful observation. Putting aside his strange notion that Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell, a Democrat, might be scheming to undermine Barack Obama&rsquo;s presidential bid, Pinkerton is onto something when he claims that Rendell&rsquo;s recent creation of a &#8220;Chief Diversity Officer&#8221; to rule over an &#8220;Office of Diversity Management&#8221; is an &#8220;early warning indicator&#8221; of things to come.</p>
<p>Governor Rendell, eager to go to the front of the line in an Administration in which blacks will figure prominently, does his self-promoting with a can&rsquo;t lose &#8220;comprehensive&#8221; diversity program. He vows that his new office will &#8220;use the full force of state government&#8221; to &#8220;outlaw discrimination.&#8221; Or, to put it another way &mdash; to burden citizens with yet more race-based mandates. Rendell&rsquo;s political instincts tell him that the business of race will continue as usual, and he&rsquo;s learned how to make the right promises. Will President Obama dare promise any less?</p>
<p>[See the results of <a href="http://www.pafop38.com/2008/08/03/rendell-creates-108010-chief-diversity-officer-to-ensure-diversity-is-a-priority" target="new">Gil Spencer&rsquo;s</a> attempts to get clarification on just what Rendell&rsquo;s new Office of Diversity Management is expected to achieve that years of Affirmative Action policies have not.]</p>
<p>Matthew Biggs, writing for Reuters, is another optimist who wonders if the fact of an Obama presidency will put an earlier generation of &#8220;civil rights leaders&#8221; out of business. On the surface, he claims, &#8220;this might be expected, as political inclusion has been a key goal of the civil rights movement for half a century.&#8221;</p>
<p>Are not blacks already included in the political process? Is Biggs implying that only with the election of a black President comes proof of this inclusion? Does this mean that American Jews have been excluded all these years from the political process, along with Chinese-Americans, and members of sundry other groups, who have never witnessed one of their ethnic compatriots take command of the Oval Office?</p>
<p>It is surprising that after all these years, Mr. Biggs has not discovered that there is no sincerity in the stated goals of the civil rights establishment. Haven&rsquo;t any of these starry-eyed optimists read Thomas Sowell&rsquo;s serious works &mdash; I mean his books, not the syndicated column? If so, they would have learned that it&rsquo;s the CRUSADE for political inclusion, it&rsquo;s the CAMPAIGN for racial justice, and it&rsquo;s the PURSUIT of social acceptance, not the achievement of these ends, that drive those who profit off the lucrative race industry. In fact, any evidence of blacks being treated fairly must adamantly be denied. The goal, if there is one, is simply to keep whites confused and worried, as they meekly submit to the demands put forth by these cunning povereticians.</p>
<p>And here is a fantasy on the Danhop blog. This dreamer thinks that an Obama presidency &#8220;could effectively bring an end to affirmative action&#8221; and even possibly bring about the end of the NAACP. After all, he reasons, once blacks have reached the pinnacle, &#8220;There isn&rsquo;t much more to advance beyond the President of the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p>His views are probably representative of so many misguided whites, who see the ascendance of Obama as one more appeasement to get blacks to cease their persistent calls for still more &#8220;rights.&#8221; Have any of the other appeasements over the last four decades lessened the crusades for &#8220;justice&#8221; or diminished the demands for that &#8220;level playing field,&#8221; which only God can guarantee?</p>
<p>If you want to see the face of the future, look no further than the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ). Over the last couple of decades, there has been no fiercer interest group that has pushed for hiring and promotion based on race than this organization. Not even the NAACP has dared to push the envelope on some race demands to the degree of NABJ. There is no way that the resolutions that make up NABJ&rsquo;s platform can be mistaken for anything but demands for outright quotas.</p>
<p>From its inception in the 1970s, the leaders of this group have made no bones about their determination to see lots of black faces in every newsroom and on every newspaper beat. Now allied with UNITY, a coalition of other &#8220;journalists of color,&#8221; including Asians and Hispanics, NABJ is a serious pressure group within the mainstream media of newspapers and television newscasting.</p>
<p>Even while admitting to the crisis now faced by the newspaper industry, where staff is being fired left and right, and hundreds of print journalists have lost their jobs, the NABJ continues to scorn newspaper executives for &#8220;doing little to increase their percentage of minorities.&#8221; As if this single quest is all that the besieged overseers of this crippled industry should have on their minds.</p>
<p>In a recent press release, NABJ reminded industry chiefs that they &#8220;should not treat diversity like a passing fad.&#8221; That line is sure to become a motto to be passed on regularly to President Obama, who spoke at the organization&rsquo;s UNITY conference in July. The wise Obama assured his audience, for whom racial preferences is the core focus, that he is a supporter of Affirmative Action &#8220;when properly structured.&#8221; He knows that he&rsquo;d better get with the program, and these blacks are certain to send him daily reminders about their pet topic, while keeping tabs on his progress in their behalf. (I wonder who gets to decide what constitutes &#8220;properly structured.&#8221;)</p>
<p>That NABJ press release offered still more warnings to the heads of newspapers: &#8220;NABJ will hold you accountable if you do not consider diversity in your hiring and, particularly, firing practices.&#8221; In other words, think carefully before you fire a black. Also, NABJ will inform &#8220;every new generation of news management that minority hiring, promotion and retention are not disposable concepts.&#8221; As things appear now in this industry, it&rsquo;s uncertain that there will even be a new generation of news management. Do these journalists of color not yet see the handwriting on the wall?</p>
<p>&#8220;Diversity,&#8221; the NABJ news release chimes, &#8220;is a necessity for telling balanced news stories.&#8221; We are assured that reporting is bound to be more objective and balanced when seen through &#8220;the lens of minority journalists.&#8221; Might their fawning behavior towards Obama at that UNITY conference be an example of such balance?</p>
<p>Along with the bourgeois black professionals, President Obama also will have to assure &#8220;progressives&#8221; and militants, similar to <a href="http://issuesviews.blogspot.com/2008/07/showing-their-true-colors.html#detractors" target="new">Glen Ford and Larry Pinkney</a> and the likes of those Florida hecklers, that he will not ignore the ongoing push for their (mostly self-inflicted) grievances &mdash; that he has not forgotten &#8220;The Struggle.&#8221; Grassroots blacks have grown used to their community leaders going to bat for them, that is, taking their part in disputes with The Man &mdash; explaining away their bizarre conduct. Whether it&rsquo;s the neighborhood preacher, the local councilman, or the city&rsquo;s Mayor, display of such loyalty to the group is a given. No less loyalty will be expected from their Brother, the President.</p>
<p>If you think Americans walk on egg shells now in regard to race matters, it could be that the worst is yet to come. We already are getting a taste of how any form of criticism directed at Obama is taken personally by his advocates and supporters. Perhaps Peter Kirsanow&rsquo;s &#8220;You may be a racist, if .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; should not be taken lightly.</p>
<p>White Americans, over at least three decades, have had it drilled into their souls that &#8220;racism&#8221; is the world&rsquo;s worst sin. It&rsquo;s a far greater sin than those minor sins, you know, like the bombings of Dresden and Hiroshima, and the killings at Waco. The simple fact of harboring negative thoughts in one&rsquo;s head about a particular group &mdash; not acting on those thoughts, mind you, but just thinking them or expressing them to others &mdash; constitutes a crime fit for punishment. Western countries are now in a spasm of legislating &#8220;racism&#8221; as the worst of all crimes. Under an Obama presidency, we can probably count on people like Senator Ted Kennedy to finally succeed in the passage of a federal <a href="http://www.issues-views.com/index.php?article=1196" target="new">&#8220;hate crime&#8221;</a> law, which has failed to pass in the last couple of sessions of Congress. Once passed, the fun and games will really get underway, as we begin to replicate the new Canada, where government investigations into political opinion have now become routine. It&rsquo;s a back door to finishing off what&rsquo;s left of the First Amendment.</p>
<p>Americans are learning to adapt, as they master the art of dancing around those egg shells. As a blog commenter puts it, &#8220;I have had to learn to speak with more sugar coating now that I&rsquo;m only one of three white people in my workplace.&#8221; Get out those barrels of sugar. Here comes Obama.<br>

			<p>Why are we endlessly lectured about the folly of &#8220;appeasement&#8221; in international affairs when the sum total of our racial policy in this country is nothing other than appeasement?  <p>&#8220;Give &#8216;em an inch, they&rsquo;ll want a mile,&#8221; has always been true of so-called &#8220;civil rights&#8221; leaders and will be true notwithstanding an Obama presidency; indeed, their demands will grow bolder, more insistent, more presumptuous and more arrogant in such a case.</p></p>

			<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between a &#8220;liberal&#8221; and a &#8220;libertarian&#8221;?</p>
<p>Libertarians believe that &#8220;in theory&#8221; White Americans, White Zimbabweans, White South Africans should be able to live in safety and security, with private property rights as racial minorities in areas numerically and politically dominated by Black Africans, Black African Americans.</p>
<p>Of course, we don&rsquo;t live &#8220;in theory&#8221;, we live in reality.</p>
<p>In reality, White Libertarians&hellip; well White Libertarians just don&rsquo;t like to live in reality.</p>
<p>Amren published a great article: &#8220;Don&rsquo;t write off the Liberals&#8221; which showed the various ways Whites on the Liberal/Left can help our cause - especially White gays, Whites promoting birth control, abortion rights for the underclass, environmentalists for immigration control etc.</p>
<p>Now, Amren should publish another article:</p>
<p>Time to write off the Libertarians. </p>

			<p>It is very easy to vent one&rsquo;s frustration and anger at blacks, and clowns like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton in particular.  But the black race and their middle class activists have no power on their own.  They are tools of white marxists.  It is whites using the coercive power of government to destroy their own race and civilization.  They want us to be distracted by Jesse&rsquo;s minstrel show.  Don&rsquo;t be.  Focus on the real perps.</p>

			<p>Remember, this was the same bunch of thugs who gave Obama a standing ovation.  Now that&rsquo;s a show of objectivity!  And I&rsquo;m glad to know these pseudo-journalists will be reporting more objective and balanced when seen &#8220;through the lens of minorities&#8221;.<br>
If every newspaper in the country went out of business, these mis-fits would still be making threats and demands. <br>

<p>Sorry, but when I got to that line I couldn&rsquo;t read any further.  There&rsquo;s just so much nonsense in the beginning the entire article is bound to be the same way or worse.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult taking any kind of allegations like the above seriously, and the premise is so naive and childish it wouldn&rsquo;t be worth my time to rebut anything written.</p>
<p>I just can&rsquo;t believe there are people like that who claim to be sane and regard themselves as intelligent.  Amazing.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The simple fact of harboring negative thoughts in one&rsquo;s head about a particular group &mdash; not acting on those thoughts, mind you, but just thinking them or expressing them to others &mdash; constitutes a crime fit for punishment.&#8221;</p>
<p>It has already gone further than that.  Just being white is enough, regardless of the presence or lack of negative racial thoughts, let alone expressing any possible negative thoughts.</p>
<p>Since this is a WN site, many of you won&rsquo;t agree, but here goes:</p>
<p>One of the worst results of all this anti-white, pro-minority dreck is that it is turning completely non-racist whites into racists.  Remember, many of us had become color-blind, which is now categorized as &#8220;racism.&#8221;  Many color-blind whites I know are getting tired of being painted as racists simply because they happen to be white.  They are becoming resentful, and are becoming anti-minority almost against their will, and certainly against what they thought was goodwill toward others.</p>
<p>Not a good trend for people of color to pursue.  Just look at history for examples of white folks getting ticked off.  Not pretty, is it?</p>
<p>Elizabeth Wright&rsquo;s site makes for interesting, insightful reading.  Check it out if you haven&rsquo;t already done so.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve drilled it in my head that most african blacks and white Bolsheviks are the most racist people on earth.  And my model is proven each day.  I now know it is true.  I could care less anymore about America.  It is run by Bolsheviks and black racists and it is my enemy.  Not Arabs and not stupid white supremacists but white genocidal Bolsheviks and their black racist african masters.</p>

			<p>This poor creature, the scribe of the &lsquo;essay&rsquo;, is walking in a vicious circle, in the darkness of her mental disability, around the main point, holding a poster, which reads:<br>
&ldquo;Government, give America the law that would force all people to respect us = blacks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She is unable to understand that respect is an effect of her merits, behavior, hard work, social usefulness. </p>
<p>The law, she strives for in line with teddy-kennedies, will work the same as a law requesting people be happy, healthy, and rich.</p>
<p>She and Her People have got a beautiful rich continent in their disposal, which they have successfully ruined in a shortest possible time. Give them a planet, the Universe and they will turn them into Detroit-planet and Zimbabwe-universe.<br>

			<p>Actually, an election of Barack Obama would ingrain identity politics in the USA, which would be a good thing since it would finally force complacent Whites to realize that this is how everyone else here operates, and we&rsquo;d better wise up.  Barack Obama in the White House would be the splash of cold water that shocks White America out of this stultifying march to the destruction of our own civilization.</p>

			<p><i>If you want to see the face of the future, look no further than the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ).</i></p>
<p>Some years ago, the NABJ had it&rsquo;s convention in the city where I lived. One of the black &#8220;journalists&#8221; (I use that word advisedly) came up to me and asked if I knew where he could get some crack. I swear that this is a true story. You can&rsquo;t make this stuff up.</p>

			<p>JR you are very wrong about libertarianism.  Being a libertarian and a race-realist are not mutually exclusive.  On the contrary, they compliment each other on several fronts.  As flamethrower correctly pointed out, it&rsquo;s Marxists in the government (and those who support them) who are our real enemies.  Are there libertarians who are race-ignorant?  Of course - just as there are race-realists who are state-ignorant.</p>
<p>MikeNY and anonymous at 8:42 both suspect that Miss Wright and another black conservative are readers of Amren.  I have a suggestion - and I say this with the utmost humility in the hope others will not attack me for it - from now on, before we click the &#8220;post&#8221; button, let us ask ourselves if what we are about to post to this forum is what we would say to a person like Thomas Sowell were he standing in front of us. In other words, remember that what you post here is visible to the whole world and we should, as Mr. Taylor says, &#8220;be better than them&#8221;.  We should always be more civil in what we write - and yes, I know I could stand some improvement in that arena as well.  It&rsquo;s tough to get this point across without giving the wrong impression so I hope most of you understand what I&rsquo;m trying to say.  I&rsquo;m not saying we should tone down our message at all - just that we should act like gentlemen in how we post.</p>

			<p>This lady is absolutely correct, and I wrote the same thing a couple of weeks back here on this site. An Obama presidency is no way the end of &#8220;identity politics&#8221;, oh no, an Obama presidency is just the beginning of 4 yrs of race-hustling from the highest office. Obama, right now, is pretending to be above the race issue and trying to pass himself off as some kind of middle of the road candidate to get himself elected. But, I have no doubt if he manages to win it won&rsquo;t be long until that mask is yanked off and the real Obama appears. This is what black people are hoping for. </p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s sad but true.</p>
<p>AR is nothing but a grievance board.</p>
<p>We post our little grieveances, and that&rsquo;s about it.</p>
<p>None of us talk about organizing anything.</p>
<p>Ok, we get it.  Blacks want entrance into the State Leviathan. Which exists in part to eliminate &#8220;discrimination&#8221; which is code for eliminating Whites.</p>
<p>We have LONG passed the stage of needing to organize and yet, we post, and post, and post.</p>
<p>We are like that Committee in the Monty Python movie &#8220;Life of Brian&#8221;.</p>
<p>When everything they had been complaining about at their meetings finally starts to happen, one of their members enters and screams for them to DO SOMETHING.  &#8220;It&rsquo;s happening! Can&rsquo;t you see that.&#8221;  And they respond by saying, </p>
<p>&#8220;Right!  This calls for immediate discussion.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&ldquo;African-Americans aren&rsquo;t stupid from the political sense. The Government enforced &ldquo;Guilt Industry&rdquo; is a venerable cornocopia of endless free money, courtesy of the emasculated non-black population.<br>

<p><br>
Black Americans smart in politics???  Please, look back at the so called Black Movement, Black Politics, Black Powe movement, etc.., it is NOTHING but the laziness and weakness of White Men that allowed the rise in so called Black Power and special privileges of Blacks and Mexicans and Moslems. </p>
<p>Every so called gain made by the Black Man, the Mexican and even the Chinese has been built and supported through ONLY ONE group of treasonous haters of White Men: White Men! White men have been giving away OUR culture, OUR society, OUR country, OUR future. Nothing else!  Until White Men FACE the fact that nothing was stolen, nothing was taken, they weren&rsquo;t cheated, they weren&rsquo;t fooled WE will continue to sink into more decay, more political correctness, etc. <br>
Let us NEVER forget that government entities and large corporations controlled by rich and powerful White Men are the ROOT cause in creating the destructive forces at work against the White Man. It EASY to blame the Black Man, EASY to blame the Mexican, EASY to blame the Chinese, EASY to blame the Japanese, EASY to blame the Jew, EASY to blame the Arab, but ONLY one course of action has been consistent for the last fifty years: White Men in control of our large US/Global corporations have supported, financed, promoted, and ENFORCED all of the programs that are in place to destroy White Culture and the White Race in America&hellip;.    ALL have been given to the enemies of the White Man by White Men who run our world&hellip;  When we recognize our enemy, THEN we can fight the war with education and action. </p>

			<p>Modern libertarianism has been infiltrated by thy usual suspects.  Reason magazine used to be opposed to &#8220;the initiation of force&#8221;, but now opposes racism.  Cato is inside the beltway, and therefore inside the establishment (and vice-versa).  As Lenin put it:  &#8220;Opposition? We are the opposition.&#8221;  He meant we create fake debates, fake opposition, fake controversy, using partial truths.</p>
<p>One could call onself a classical liberal.  America was founded on liberty, and race- the naturalization act 0f 1790 calls for free WHITE persons&hellip;</p>

			<p>&#8220;MikeNY and anonymous at 8:42 both suspect that Miss Wright and another black conservative are readers of Amren. I have a suggestion - and I say this with the utmost humility in the hope others will not attack me for it - from now on, before we click the &ldquo;post&rdquo; button, let us ask ourselves if what we are about to post to this forum is what we would say to a person like Thomas Sowell were he standing in front of us.&#8221; posted by jewamongyou I&rsquo;m sure most people think about their posts here.What would I say in person? Simply this: Where are you few blacks in the public arena? Whites get very little MSM coverage unless it is to openly denigrate their views as racist.Blacks could have an impact if they would expose the Sharpton&rsquo;s and Je$$e&rsquo;s every single time they appear on the communist airwaves[cnn,msnbc,fox and others].A couple times per year we&rsquo;ll read salient articles by blacks in blogs or on WorldNetDaily.Whoopdeedoo!Everyone with an ounce of discernment knows that minorities-mostly blacks-enable thir brethren.We are at the point where it is too late to stop the racial juggernaut because it is but one ploy the llluminists use to debase Western Culture.So posting a venting rant here is not a sin in my humble opinion. Where were these black voices of reason when the following quotes were made by Leftist whites and racist blacks?  &#8220;Keep bashing the dead white males, and the live ones, and the females, too, until the social construct known as the white race is destroyed. Not deconstructed, but destroyed.&#8221;<br>
    &mdash;  - Noel Ignatiev, Jewish Harvard professor and editor of Race Traitor magazine (Washington Times, September 4, 2002)</p>
<p>&#8220;The white race is the cancer of human history.&#8221;  <br>
    &mdash;  - Susan Sontag (much-celebrated Jewish  &#8220;intellectual,&#8221; whose recent passing was lamented loudly in Jewish circles) </p>
<p> &#8220;I don&rsquo;t care about your idiot children.&#8221;<br>
    &mdash;  - Willie Brown (Mayor of San Francisco, to a white parent complaining that affirmative action would penalize his children), quoted in The Social Contract (Summer 1998, p. 290)</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s always illegitimate for white men to organize as white men.&#8221;  <br>
    &mdash;  - William Raspberry (black columnist), Dubiously Exclusive, (Washington Post, Nov. 24, 1995)</p>

A:  A world in which there aren&rsquo;t any white people&hellip; .&#8221;<br>

<p>&#8220;You guys have been practicing discrimination for years.  Now it is our turn.&#8221;<br>

			<p>Nice article.The writer has been around since 1985?Where are these blacks in the mainstream?Other than Bill Cosby,I never see or hear articulate blacks.Nor are they visible when the ebonic black leaders spout their racial hatred in newspapers,news shows,lectures,schools,courtroooms or elsewhere.The article is as useful as the venting done here and on other websites,forums,and blogs.It will amount to a hill of beans.To the jewamongus I say this: I would tell these people they need to educate their race.They need to come out in the open before there is rioting and anarchy in the streets.We can see that even the youth of this nation are finally fed up with the hate whitey indoctrination,which means the the powderkeg is ready to blow.Go to Yahoo Answers in the cultures and groups section and see how many white teens ask questions about the hate whitey issue.They are fed up with the guilt trip.<br>
So,as much as I appreciate the occasional black article that has a modicum of sanity,I certainly am not in awe of it.</p>

<p>&hellip; Well, I guess we could all march out and get crucified.  But I get your point.  The problem is the there are not enough whites who are awake and whites who try to wake up other whites are shunned, often by those whites they are trying to arouse.  Those who are saying that something, perhaps the election of Obama and his anticipated suppression of whites will unite whites and we will begin to act like a minority group in distress.  The problem is that our culture - our white American culture won&rsquo;t allow us to think that way.  Many, many more white Americans are going to have to suffer direct loss before they feel something must be done.  Most are living happy enough lives, meaning, they have enough money to distract themselves from these issues.</p>

			<p>An insightfull article by Ms.Wright. I particularly like how she warns of how &#8220;whites&#8221; are even deemed to be guilty of &#8220;thought crimes&#8221;, when they &#8220;think&#8221; about some groups a certain way. She is a very honest,and clear headed women and of course to the phony liberals, she&rsquo;s a racist, weird, and over the top.</p>

			<p>It may take years, if Obama gets in, for America to wake up, but the damage blacks will do in high office could be enormous. Appointing Judges will be the worst thing he can do, as they are the gift that keeps on giving. But sooner or later, we are going to have a bunch of goons in the &#8216;Supreme Court&rsquo;. If not with Obama, then with the next Democrat that gets in. Then they will start chipping away at your freedom, but the new generation of lemmings won&rsquo;t even know it.</p>

<p>When I wrote &#8220;Not for the first time, I get the impression that Miss Wright is a die-hard AmRen reader!&#8221;, I meant it somewhat tongue-in-cheek. Somewhat!</p>
<p>But seriously, I have read Miss Wright&rsquo;s works, and admired them, for years now. It must take quite a bit of courage for her, and other black conservatives, to write as they do. When one considers how far removed from current black mainstream thought these opinions are, it is clear that this small group deserves a figurative pat on the back for their openness, honesty, and search for the truth. It would be so easy for them to follow the party line, and receive accolades from their peers for doing so. Yet they persist.</p>
<p>I do not know why you perceive what I write to be offensive. Is what we read &amp; write on AmRen so beyond the pale that we must pull our intellectual punches so as to insure the &#8220;outside world&#8221; thinks nothing but good of ourselves? Are AmRen&rsquo;s offerings so injurious, so deviant, that we must talk in code?<br>
Is the prevailing viewpoint here so shocking and disturbing that, like incest and bestiality, it must be spoken of in hushed tones, and then only among a select few?</p>
<p>Were I so fortunate to have a conversation with, to use your example, Thomas Sowell, I would think that we would both be able to engage in an intellectual, adult conversation. I would never censor myself in the belief that Mr. Sowell is too fragile and delicate to hear certain ideas and thoughts. As if he were a delicate antebellum Southern belle confronted with bare table legs! ;)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll leave the patronizing uber-sensitivity to the liberals.<br>

			<p>A few people here have mentioned Elizabeth Wright and her AmRen-like prose.  When the Council of Conservative Citizens was receiving a media feeding frenzy in late 1998 and early 1999, Elizabeth Wright not only defended us by name, but I understand she contacted our upper leadership and specifically admonished them not to back peddle or back slide in our racial ideology, or she wouldn&rsquo;t defend us in her writings anymore.</p>

			<p>This whole piece of writing is crazy. I am sorry but blacks seemingly live in a parallel world where being a victim is a way of life. How can such people survive? The black experience or whatever you want to call it is mostly fantasy. I have lived a long time and I have never heard a single sane person go on and on about how he or she is a victim. Such thinking is simply too dysfunctional to be used by people who are coping with the world as it is.It suits the institutionalized to think along these lines but no-one else.</p>

There will be a great many Whites whome will say they are for barrak, but I think most dem&rsquo;s will get behind the curtain and think,  &#8221; that just me and just a few of us&#8221; will give McCain a small election win. But, I think it will be a trouncing of obama. Then, the future starts. </p>

<p>I admire your desire to want to do something, but save yourself the time and effort.  It won&rsquo;t be necessary.</p>
<p>Posting and maintaining contact, Mal, is the best thing to do right now.  We&rsquo;re far beyond effecting change by picking up signs and walking up and down the street.  We passed the point of no return long ago.</p>
<p>But, in reality, we don&rsquo;t really have to do anything right now.  Things are degenerating to the point that the situation will reach critical mass all by itself.</p>
<p>The best things for us to do is stay connected, be well-prepared, watch and wait. Unfortunaely the country is imploding all on its own.</p>
<p>And I can tell you my opinion is the result of much analysis and research and doesn&rsquo;t involve wishful thinking one iota.  I&rsquo;m not just a race realist I&rsquo;m a realist period.</p>

<p>I liked your post, and thanks for responding Ranger.</p>
<p>Actually, though not entirely, overall I agree with you.  I guess what I am really responding to are the nay-sayers and all of the &#8220;Chicken Littles&#8221; as Dedalus refered to them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s depressing and unmanly.</p>
<p>Plus, the West is what it is because of those members with its population who were qualified and select.  Remember, Nobility means placing demands on yourself. Ignobility means placing demands on others.  The Nobility was made up of those from every walk of life, it helped keep the Aristocracy viable.  Democracy is too Middle Class and the Middle Class promotes envy and jealousy and has paved the way for our destruction.<br>
The Aristocracy ran things, via the Nobility, for thousands of years, the Middle Class has been in control for much less than 200 years. And look.<br>
So, Ranger, as long as we&rsquo;re limited for the time being to thinking and talking and posting, we ought to use the time to think long and hard about what kind of world we want to live in. Obviously we can&rsquo;t go back in time. But perhaps we can rescue the best qualities of each of our social groups and begin to build something new. We&rsquo;ve got to do something.</p>
