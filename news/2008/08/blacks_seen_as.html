<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Eighty years after a man named Lloyd &#8220;Spud&#8221; Hughes, as legend has it, accidentally mixed his tobacco with menthol crystals, Congress is fighting over whether to ban these popular flavored cigarettes.</p>
<p>Mentholated cigarettes started out in the 1920s with such names as Spud, Listerine, the Original Eucalyptus Smoke and Snowball. Today they&rsquo;re sold as Newport, Kool and Marlboro Menthol, the smokes of choice among the black community.</p>
<p>Critics charge they are products designed specifically to lure young blacks into a lifetime of tobacco use.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Menthol critics point to studies that claim young blacks, who as a group are much more likely than whites to smoke menthols, have been targeted by marketing programs of cigarette manufacturers. Tobacco companies have forcefully denied targeting young people and are lobbying against any ban on menthols, which make up about a quarter of all cigarette sales.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Studies report that nearly three out of four black smokers prefer menthol brands, compared to three of 10 white smokers, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
<p><b>A troubling development</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Congressional Black Caucus, whose members represent many of the densely populated and largely black urban centers where menthol cigarettes are most popular, is split on the menthol question as well.</p>
<p>Ann Goldon, health education coordinator for the Genesee County Health Department, said the high levels of smoking in her county are probably influenced by economic stress in a community that has lost tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs in the past 25 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;But look at the marketing campaigns. They seem to be targeting the African-American community,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Along major commercial strips in black neighborhoods in Flint, the signs on liquor and convenience stores promote &#8220;Newport Pleasure!&#8221; &#8220;Kool&#8221; and other menthol brands. At a north side convenience store, more than 80 percent of the cigarette sales are menthol, said Nagibe Abu Eiea, the store&rsquo;s manager.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A 2002 report, &#8220;The African Americanization of menthol cigarette use in the United States,&#8221; found that tobacco companies nearly doubled their market share in the African-American community from the early 1960s through the late 1970s. Part of the campaign, the report said, was built on a perception that menthols are safer to smoke than non-menthol brands.</p>

			<p>I can understand why the Diversity Industry is split on this issue.  On the one hand, if you prohibit them, then you&rsquo;re depriving black people of their favorite cigarettes, which will be racism.  On the other hand, if you don&rsquo;t prohibit them, then you&rsquo;ll be targeting black people with that dastardly killer tobacco, which will be racism.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t win for losing when it comes to the Diversity Industry, so the best thing is to lose the Diversity Industry.</p>

			<p>Are they also targets of fried chicken? Ribs? Buffalo wings? Malt liquor?</p>
<p>Of course, if businesses WEREN&rsquo;T targeting them for various products, we&rsquo;d all be hearing about how we&rsquo;re discriminating against them by not catering to their needs,  how they&rsquo;re being marginalized by white society, blah blah blah.</p>

			<p>I agree with Mr. Clack about banning menthol cigarettes from urban areas.  In fact, there should be laws banning blacks from smoking menthols. Post signs on stores&rsquo; doors:  &#8220;You must be 18 and not black to buy menthol cigarettes.  Proof of race required.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Even better, ban blacks from smoking at all.  Just tell them it&rsquo;s for their own good and that white devils (and other races) deserve to die from cancer.  No doubt the AA community will be grateful for your concern and paternalistic molly-coddling.<br>
 <br>
In addition, require that ALL the models used in tobacco product advertisements be white.  Blond-haired and blue-eyed, preferably.  </p>
<p>When will people finally understand that more government regulations will solve the problems caused by freedom of choice in this country?  /s</p>
<p>This is just basic marketing strategy, Ms. Goldon.  It&rsquo;s not a plot to kill black people.  The tobacco companies would be happy to create an entire world of lifelong smokers.  </p>

			<p>Frankly, I do not get the drift of this article. I find menthol yucky (and I smoke like a blast furnace). As far as I know, it is not addictive.<br>
So what point is Mr. Jones trying to make? That poor blacks were lied to that it´s healthier? Gimme a break. If menthol is outlawed, he´s sure to roll the same data set into a &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; reefer.</p>

			<p>Cigarettes aren&rsquo;t any different from any other product blacks use.  Fried chicken is not healthy either.  If 3 out of 10 Whites prefer KFC original recipe and 7 out of 10 blacks eat extra crispy, are you going to ban extra crispy because it&rsquo;s  assumed to be less healthy and it appears to be targeting blacks?</p>

			<p>Well, well, well&hellip;</p>
<p>As I understand this article, is Mr. Jones saying that </p>
<p>1) If I own a Convenience Store, and</p>
<p>2) I want to cut down on the number of black customers I have drifting in and out of the store, then</p>
<p>3) I should knowingly NOT stock any menthol cigs?  When they know I don&rsquo;t sell what they want, they will go elsewhere?</p>
<p>4) Should I have a chain of such stores, can I name them &#8220;Plantation 7-11&#8221;?  The Song of the South&hellip;?</p>

<p>Yes, and besides that, retail outlets should be forced to take Angel Food Cake off the shelves, because it&rsquo;s white and is offensive to blacks who are flaunted with the image of the color white as being regarded as angelic.</p>
<p>So many injustices.  So little time.</p>

			<p>So after learning that most of their customers were black they sensibly ran ads in black areas. That proves they&rsquo;re &#8220;targeting&#8221; the &#8220;community&#8221;. How sinister!</p>
<p>Of course if they ignored blacks and spent their ad $ trying to attract new white customers they would be accused of &#8220;disrespecting&#8221; and &#8220;marginalizing&#8221; the community.</p>

			<p>Even the smell of menthol is gross. You can never get the smell out of your house. It lingers in the carpet and drapes. It&rsquo;s worse yet if a menthol addict lights up in your car. It used to be just disgusting in the break room at work. Menthol itself comes from slavery times. There&rsquo;s a lot about it people don&rsquo;t know.   <br>

			<p>I grew up in a black neighbourhood in DC. This is what the blacks smoked:</p>
<p>young blacks = Newports<br>
middle age blacks = Salems<br>
old blacks = Kools</p>
<p>But they all loved their fried chicken and bubble butts!</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t care how you slice this - they buy them because they&rsquo;re the cheapest brand. I&rsquo;ve know MANY who do it for this reason alone. When they have more moeny, they just buy more of that trash brand.<br>
Funniest thing is, nicotine addicted menthol smokers are getting less nicotine per cigarette, so they have to buy and smoke more of them. Idiots.</p>

			<p>I hear huge law suits by blacks of Tobacco companies for holding them in bondage to the Menthol cigarettes. These things and the reparations by Obama will change the financial structure of the U.S. with a new rich class. hahahahaaa</p>

			<p>I thought the menthol was added for the same reason cloves are added to certain cigarettes; to keep one&rsquo;s throat from becoming sore from the harsher tobacco in these products.</p>
<p>Tobacco companies add all sorts of weird stuff to cigarettes these days.  They&rsquo;re not in business to &#8220;target blacks&#8221;; they&rsquo;re in business to sell products to make money.  Blacks&rsquo; money isn&rsquo;t any greener than anyone else&rsquo;s, and what Notawn said above was spot-on; the companies would be delighted if everyone in the world smoked.  This is one reason why during World War Two, Korea and Vietnam, cigarettes were included in C-rations.  The tobacco companies knew the young servicemen would begin smoking them, and that most would remain lifelong smokers.</p>
<p>My favorite old tobacco advertisement was for &#8220;Regency&#8221; cigarettes, just because of the sheer outrageousness of the claim: &#8220;Scientifically formulated for pregnant women.&#8221;</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s just a trend within a certain group of people in a certain time period. It may be more appealing to their taste buds.???</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many times I heard younger blacks ask for Newport-short-in-the-box when I worked at a convenience store; probably as many times as I heard younger whites ask for Marlbo Light-in-the-box. Sometimes the box, as oppossed to soft pack, was more important than the actual flavor; same with tobacco-long cut or fine cut, the flavor didn&rsquo;t matter as much. </p>
<p>What about all of the older white men that still smoke Camel non-filter, Basic non-filter, or roll their own, etc., etc.?  That&rsquo;s what they grew up on. That&rsquo;s what their friends and their father smoked, so that&rsquo;s what they still smoke. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically just learned behavior, depending on the specific area. </p>

			<p>All of a sudden I&rsquo;m reminded of the hilarious 1971 film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_Turkey_(film)" rel="nofollow"><i>Cold Turkey</i></a>, in which a tobacco company offers $25 million to any town that can quit smoking <i>en masse</i>for 30 days. Just before midnight on the last day, the company airdrops thousands of cigarettes on everyone by helicopter. To hear these liberals whine, you&rsquo;d think planeloads of menthols were being dumped on Detroit, New Orleans, Birmingham, south Dallas, etc.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t smoked for nearly 35 years, but I do recall preferring menthols back then for just one reason   &mdash;   they tasted better.</p>
