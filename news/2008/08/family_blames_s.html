<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>San Francisco&rsquo;s immigrant sanctuary policies played a &#8220;substantial&#8221; role in the slayings of a father and two of his sons by allowing city officials to shield the alleged killer from deportation, despite his violent history, according to a legal claim filed Friday on behalf of the victims&rsquo; family.</p>
<p>The claim is likely to be followed by a wrongful death lawsuit in which the family of Tony Bologna and his sons could seek millions of dollars from the city.</p>
<p>Bologna, 48, and his sons Michael, 20, and Matthew, 16, were shot to death on a street in the Excelsior district June 22. Edwin Ramos, 21, of El Sobrante, who authorities say is a member of a street gang, has been charged with three counts of murder.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Chronicle reported that officials with the Juvenile Probation Department, relying on their interpretation of San Francisco&rsquo;s sanctuary city ordinance, had not referred Ramos to federal immigration authorities for possible deportation. The ordinance bars city officials from cooperating with federal crackdowns on illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>After other Chronicle stories on the city&rsquo;s practices appeared, however, City Attorney Dennis Herrera&rsquo;s office reiterated a 1994 legal opinion that nothing in the law prevented the city from handing over juveniles to federal immigration authorities, if the minors have committed felonies.</p>
<p>The city attorney has 45 days to respond to the Bologna family&rsquo;s claim. The city typically rejects such claims, after which plaintiffs are free to file suit.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The claim says the city knew that Ramos was an illegal immigrant and was part of a gang, the Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13), that attacked Latinos and African American men who were not members of the gang.</p>
<p>Police have theorized that Ramos shot the Bolognas because he mistook them for rival gang members. The father and his sons were shot in their car as they returned home from a Sunday afternoon family barbecue.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Bolognas&rsquo; claim asserts that the city knew that federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials were targeting illegal immigrant gang members for removal from the United States and would have sought to deport Ramos immediately had they known of his juvenile record.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The claim places blame on the city&rsquo;s Juvenile Probation Department for adopting &#8220;official and unofficial policies&#8221; that amounted to unlawfully harboring illegal immigrants who committed violent crimes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

			<p>We will never persuade ideological lefties like San Francisco&rsquo;s Mayor, but hitting them where it hurts financially could cause them to see the light. Last year in New York, actress Adrienne Shelley was killed by an illegal; I wish her family would similarly sue illegal-loving Mayor Bloomberg.</p>

			<p>Are half of these Mexicans blind, or what?In an East Bay city, about a year ago a Maxican gang banger just walked up to two young men who I think were woods (white) who were drinking some brewskies under a bridge, and just blew them away with gunshots to the head.Prosecutors will seek the death penalty, and I want him to get it.On the radio call in show of Brian Sussman, a caller said that if a city employee were to inform Federal Authorities that someone is an illegal, crime committed or not, they can lose their job.I hope the Bolognas get tens of millions.A city truck ran a red light a few years ago, hitting and killing a 5 year old. The eventual settlement was over 20 million.That was excessive, I believe, but if that is the case, then the Bolognas should get much more.</p>

			<p>Liberals knew that that would be the result, foresaw the result and went ahead anyway. That means they are responsible for the result.<br>
Too bad liberals don&rsquo;t accept the concept of personal responsibility, or they might give a darn.</p>

			<p>The Bologna family should file a civil suit for damages against each individual that aided and abetted the murderer.</p>
<p>The reason is that in a civil suit the evidentiary requirements are lower, and it is easy to prove damages.</p>
<p>I hope the Bolognas drive all these scoundrels into bankruptcy, they deserve no less.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t Nancy Pelosi from S.F.?  Does she by any chance have her dirty hands in this, also???</p>

			<p>Finally, somebody has sued one of these despicable government entities for one of the many crimes they commit annually, plus a wealth of neglect of various things.</p>
<p>Other suits should be filed naming employers, landlords, or anyone else who has knowingly aided and abetted an illegal who commits a crime, creating a tort on a citizen here.</p>
<p>The ONLY thing these enablers understand is naked power and force or action designed to break into their wealth.<br>

			<p>The only thing people value in this backwards, yet purportedly &#8220;progressive&#8221; part of the country is money.  Period.</p>
<p>If cities did not have Federal aid (CA alone gets $42 billion in Federal Aid for Health and Human Services) for not reporting immigration violations to the INS/ICE, then they would not be allowed Fed funds for a year, no warning.</p>
<p>If the fat, lazy bureaucrats would have their checks threatened, then something would happen.</p>
<p>The threat of losing real, cold, hard cash is the only thing that will bring the immigration debate to reason.  The Left wants to bring in needy voters who will eventually be Democrats and vote for free services and the Republicans (Note, not Conservatives) want the cheap, uninsured labor to boost profits.</p>

			<p>I hope Mrs. Bologna takes that sanctuary city and all its council members for everything it, and they, are worth. That probably won&rsquo;t change any minds about being pro-illegal cheerleaders, but at least it might change the law that allows murders like this to happen. The only excuse I&rsquo;ve ever heard for having a sanctuary city is that it will enable illegals to report crime without fear of being arrested. No illegal is going to cooperate or willingly talk to the police - in their coutries the law is also the outlaw - so that reason is not valid. No, those who want to protect illegals are sure to be getting a payoff from someone or some country. I&rsquo;ve decided that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s driving this whole thing. No one is doing it our of the goodness of their hearts.</p>

			<p>US Attorney Joseph Russinello needs to arrest the Mayor, DA etc. and prosecute them for aiding, abetting, transporting, harboring and sheltering illegal aliens instead of doing the talkshow circuit while he sits on his fat arse.</p>

			<p>Good for them; I hope they bankrupt the city.  I also hope they named city government officials individually in the lawsuit.  Nothing gets someone&rsquo;s attention quite like taking their house away from them.</p>

<p>I agree completely. It&rsquo;s horrible to think a family has been destroyed because an idiot/ultraliberal city tolerated a dangerous criminal lawbreaker in their midst. </p>

			<p>I haven&rsquo;t researched this, but if the plaintiffs can show that  the city acted &#8220;recklessly, with disregard for the law,&#8221; or some other such legal buzzwords, they just may be able to pierce the veil of governmental immunity. In any case, the city&rsquo; attorneys were stupid stupid stupid for ever agreeing to so-called sanctuary city status, since it was only a matter of time before this happened. In fact, &#8216;protected&rsquo; illegals have probably murdered dozens of times, but this was a triple and therefore got media attention.</p>

			<p>According to an interesting article by Brenda Walker on VDare:</p>
<p> &#8220;San Francisco is like an addict failing to reform from a bad habit because it doesn&rsquo;t really want to change. The city is so loaded with ultra-liberal politicans, judges, and social service providers that it is having trouble disengaging from the policy of protecting illegal alien criminals &hellip; even when the mayor has called for semi-normal law enforcement. Newsom originally voiced support for protecting foreign criminals&hellip; but flip-flopped &hellip;when he saw local polling on the issue. Now he looks unable to enforce his own new policy, reversed though it may be.</p>
<p> &#8220;Many in the city are outraged at the level of criminal anarchy that has been allowed to fester&hellip;.<b>One problem is the complete lack of responsible adults in positions of authority in San Francisco </b>   &mdash;   there is no bench of possible candidates for office who are not moonbats. For example,  <b>Newsom <i>was the moderate </i> in the last mayoral election </b>   &mdash;   the opposition was &hellip;commie Matt Gonzalez, who received 47 percent.  Years of left-wing politics have gutted public safety in San Francisco, and  <b>it is questionable whether the city can be fixed, given the available personnel.</b>&#8221;</p>

			<p>Hopefully the American family will get this great Civil Rights abuse by our churches and filthy rotten Gov&rsquo;t employees who permitted the criminal foreigners to live here corrected.  I&rsquo;d be looking for tens of millions in reparations and jail time for SF Gov&rsquo;t officials who failed to protect it citizenry from foreign invasion.</p>

			<p>Maybe all the Americans who have picked up tuberculosis can pick up a million or so from the feds for a willful failure to enforce the law and protect Americans from disease-bearing foreigners.</p>
