						<p>Work on &#8220;virtual fences&#8221; planned for Arizona&rsquo;s stretch of the U.S.-Mexican border has been brought to a halt.</p>
<p>The Interior Department has not granted the Homeland Security Department permission to use the land for constructing the surveillance towers that form the backbone of the virtual fences, said Barry Morrissey, spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Without authorization to use the land, no work could begin, which prompted agency officials to instruct the lead contractor on the project, Boeing Co., to suspend activities until further notice, Morrissey said.</p>
<p>No date has been set to resume work.</p>
<p>The suspension of work has forced at least one subcontractor, EOD Technology Inc., to lay off 40 security guards who already had been hired and trained, EOD spokesman Bill Pearse said. The company, based in Lenoir City, Tenn., with a small office in Tucson, had plans to hire a total of 100 security guards for the project, Pearse said. The guards were protecting Boeing personnel who were constructing equipment for the virtual fence as part of the SBInet project, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There is no definite date for work to resume, Morrissey said. Boeing told EOD Technology officials that the suspension of work could last until Jan. 1, 2009, Pearse said. He said EOD is &#8220;mildly optimistic&#8221; that the project will resume.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Government officials told Boeing officials to suspend activities until further notice but didn&rsquo;t give them a date on which to start again, said Deborah Bosick, Boeing SBInet coordinator.</p>
<p>In September 2006, Boeing was awarded the prime contract for the Secure Border Initiative. The company led a $20.6 million test project called Project 28 last year along the border flanking Sasabe, and it was delayed because of glitches and was plagued by problems, a Government Accountability Office report found.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Homeland Security will continue to work with the Interior Department to get permission, but it also will shift some focus to the ongoing construction of fences and vehicle barriers, Morrissey said.</p>
<p>The agency has until the end of the calendar year to construct the remaining 332 miles of primary fencing and vehicle barriers to meet the mandate of 670 miles of primary fencing and vehicle barriers established by the Secure Fence Act of 2006. Through last Wednesday, the agency had completed 338 miles.</p>
<p>The decision to suspend work stems from the Interior Department&rsquo;s decision not to sign off on Homeland Security&rsquo;s proposed finding of no significant impact in the environmental assessment for the Tucson West project, Morrissey said.</p>

			<p>Consider this a blessing.  The virtual fence would have been useless.  All it is are a bunch of useless unmanned aerial drones watching blurry images of people run across the desert.  As if we don&rsquo;t know that already.</p>

			<p>     One hand doesn&rsquo;t know what the other hand is doing. This is typical of our government. Close your eyes, bury your head in the sand, and just maybe the problem will go away by itself. Now you know why people say it will take ten years for newly found oil to make its way to the gas pump. Not only do the oil companies have to fight the government bureaucrats, they must do battle with the environmental crazies and their armies of lawyers. What gives the government the right to own and control so much land ? Sell it all off.</p>

			<p>Seven years after September 11th and the government has accomplished nothing. Except for harassing grandmothers at the airports and punishing the border patrol for doing their jobs. Sanctuary cities are ignored. Bureaucracy, snarled by even more bureaucracy, or so they pretend. Feds can&rsquo;t even express one word of feigned disappointment over their endless failures to build a simple fence. Or an apology for their neglect in defending America. </p>
<p>We managed to build fences for Egypt and Mexico. We can muster a serious response when the sovereign borders of Iraq, Korea, Georgia, or Poland are threatened, but not our own? </p>
<p>Ignore the Interior department. If they send more bureaucrats, then hand &#8216;em a shovel. Get back to work and build the fence. Every inch.  </p>

			<p>Did anybody ever take this seriously in the first place?  Just more diversion and stalling from the Bush administration. Who&rsquo;s kidding anyone?</p>

			<p>It is not that we can&rsquo;t build the fence, it&rsquo;s that we won&rsquo;t.</p>

			<p>Since this is federal land, it belongs to the American people. The Dept. of Interior does not own the land, they only management it for the American people. The American people want a fence built on their land to protect them.</p>
<p>Only under a Communist government does all property belong to the State. We are not a Communist government, yet.<br>

			<p>Since our government won&rsquo;t protect us, I have an alternative solution. How about taking all those government subsidized farmers and having them grow mountains of beans and rice which can be dumped at the south end of Mexico. What do you think?</p>

<p>This is not the Interior Department doing this, this is obviously George Bush ordering the Interior department to do this.</p>
<p>After the election it will be Obama or McCain ordering the Interior department to do this.</p>

			<p>As Edward says, our government gets all bent out of shape worrying about the borders of Iraq or Poland, is ready to go to war over the Caucasus, but is indifferent to protecting our own national boundaries.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Seven years after September 11th and the government has accomplished nothing.&#8221;  Indeed, we are still fumbling about in Afghanistan, allegedly looking for one man that we still can&rsquo;t find. Very strange!  All this in more time than it took us to win the Second World War.  </p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re told it may take another hundred years.</p>

			<p>Too bad, a virtual fence would have worked so well stopping all of the virtual illegals.</p>
