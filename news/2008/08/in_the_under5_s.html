						<p>A surge in Hispanic immigration over the past decade has dramatically altered the racial and ethnic composition of the region&rsquo;s youngest residents, according to U.S. Census Bureau figures released today.</p>
<p>As with minorities in general, immigrants tend to be younger than non-Hispanic whites and still in their childbearing years. As a result, in five suburban Washington counties, more than half of children age 4 and younger were minorities when the annual Census Bureau survey was taken a year ago.</p>
<p>In three of the counties &mdash; Prince William, Montgomery and Charles &mdash; the share reached about 60 percent. And in Prince George&rsquo;s, where Hispanic immigration has supplemented an even larger African American population, more than 90 percent of these children are minorities.</p>
<p>The implications for governments and communities are wide-ranging, demographers said. As the current crop of youngsters reaches kindergarten age, school systems that would otherwise be losing students will continue to grow or remain stable. They will also need to accommodate an ever-larger number of students who were raised in immigrant households where English was not spoken.</p>
<p>In addition, although most Hispanic children younger than 5 are native-born U.S. citizens and therefore eligible for government health care and other benefits, research indicates that if their parents are not U.S. citizens, they will be less likely to claim assistance, said Michael Fix, director of studies at the Washington-based Migration Policy Institute.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As these minority children mature, counties that until fairly recently were dominated by non-Hispanic whites are likely to shift to majority-minority status, said William Frey, a demographer with the Brookings Institution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bubbling up [of minorities] that we&rsquo;re now seeing at the younger ages will continue to move up through the age range, through the teenage years, the working-age years and then the housing-buying years,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The child population is really a microcosm of the future.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>Frey forgot to add that civic participation will drop, volunteerism will decline, state and national parks will close due to lack of interest, and the social services will be in distress due to an overwhelming burden of demands.  Sounds like a great future ahead&hellip;</p>

<p>Ah yes, one of my very favorite idiots to grace the AR news board&rsquo;s demographic articles, Comrade William Frey of the Buffoons Institution!</p>
<p>And what kind of &#8220;microcosm of the future&#8221; are we getting Comrade Frey? Is it a bright and happy future of diversity &#8220;dividends,&#8221; or a swirling quagmire of nonwhite social pathologies that we begin &#8220;seeing at the younger ages will continue to move up through the age range, through the teenage years, the working-age years and then the housing-buying years?&#8221; </p>
<p>Which is it that we are seeing &#8220;bubbling up&#8221; here?</p>
<p>Well, as most who regularly read my comments here would guess, I hold that it is the latter and not the former; we are overpopulating this country and not with productive &#8220;human resources,&#8221; but instead with utterly worthless resource consumers. They do not come here to really contribute anything, and educational and social &#8220;research&#8221; time and again finds them totally incompatible with the civilization they are infecting. While this &#8220;research&#8221; is often slanted and outright doctored to favor them through blaming the host for the parasites shortcomings and disparities, anyone with even an ounce of critical thinking skills can quickly dissect the politics from the facts. Much like cities before them, counties and states that become &#8220;minority-majority&#8221; do not have a very successful track record of demonstrating the &#8220;diversity&#8221; payoff, but instead lead to more excuse making and prevaricating as to why &#8220;endemic racism&#8221; and the need to defeat it are the &#8220;obvious&#8221; problems.</p>
<p>And on and on it goes, like most pyramid schemes: a few prosper, and most just get the shaft!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!</p>

			<p>Extermination stares us in the face, and liberals know it too.  Some are glad, they&rsquo;ve been hoping for the day.  Other liberals are worried, they thought they could control their foreign allies.  At what point will the Browns rise up against us, what event will spark their vengeance against the White Race, which they believe has held them down?  Or do they have the patience to wait for us all to die of heart disease?   </p>

<p>What? You mean the parents of all these anchor babies shun welfare and public assistance? Then why do they come to America? Surely not for the &#8220;vibrant diversity&#8221; alone.</p>
<p>Of course, they could be claiming all this money using stolen identities, but they won&rsquo;t admit to that. Even if they did, the media can&rsquo;t publish that because it might make Hispanics look bad.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m in total agreement with you JohnPM. The West has pretty much squandered any advantage it had to grow and prosper by letting these people into each and every white homeland. <br>
Whats to be done? I&rsquo;m getting tired of half answers from our &#8216;leaders&rsquo;. We need someone to lead us, but no-one dare step forward.<br>
 I don&rsquo;t know about you but all this &#8216;China booming&rsquo; news thats on now really makes me quite jealous of their attitude. Chinese are not in the least bit concerned about diversity, equality and the rest of the garbage our youth has been infected with. Chinese know they are smarter than most races, they don&rsquo;t run from that fact but embrace it.  Nor do they let mobs of third worlders into their country, they do what the Europeans used to do. They go to Africa,/ S America and get the locals to do the work and give them a wage and take their goods back off to China. Its called exploitation when whites do it. Shocking.<br>

			<p>I have to admit that I&rsquo;m pretty jealous of Hispanic men. No, not for their low IQ and wanton ignorance, their 5&rsquo;4&#8221; height, their style of dress (baggy jeans, white T-shirt and shaved heads), their prison record, or their propensity to buy a large, late model SUV and put 24&#8221; chrome rims on it that, altogether, cost more than the SUV itself.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m jealous of them because despite all of their lengthy, obvious and deep shortcomings, their women are <b>still</b> extremely loyal to them. The men are, perhaps, from an evolutionary perspective, the most unsuitable men of all races, yet they are dominating the race war (make no mistake about it, it&rsquo;s a race war.) This is overwhelmingly due to the loyalty of their women to their own race and to their own men. On the flip side of the coin, White men, perhaps, from an evolutionary perspective, are the <b>most</b> suitable men of all races, yet, our women, and I use the word &#8220;our&#8221; here very loosely, are the least loyal of all women.</p>
<p>This leads me to rethink evolution in that perhaps the most important trait is not really &#8220;survival of the fittest&#8221; but that only the loyal survive.</p>

			<p>White cultures have been continually assulted by others because we work, learn and prosper.  Once prosperity is achieved through much hard work then the commies come to usurp what they have not built.  It is so everywhere.  The founding fathers knew this and designed Constitutional restrictions on immigrations and citizenship.  It is the politics of the last 60 years that brought US to this place. USA is like any house; if you do not lock the doors and include only invited guests the robbers will soon occupy your house.  The amazing slice to USA invasion is  Congress &amp; Presidents invited them to take what we had. Now, most Americans are poorer than the immigrants of the last 10 years.   I know because my neighbors, who are likely illegals, have new cars,free food, medical, education and a house paid for by subprime first home buyer programs.  I had to work and pay for all of this myself and it took me 35 yrs to acquire what they have in 5 years.  How can this be? Because I paid for the food, medical,education, mortgage interests perks, and fewer job opps because they are took all this for fre</p>

			<p>Not just becoming  &mdash;   for kids of middle school age and below, Whites are already a distinct minority.  I did foot-soldier work for the 2000 census and you can&rsquo;t believe how horrendous it had already gotten then: Latino and African-American kids are often missed due to the difficulties of canvassing the neighborhoods, lack of school registration, working in agriculture and so forth.  Whites are already a small, and dwindling minority throughout US schools.  Especially in states like Arizona, New Mexico, Florida, California, Colorado, New Jersey, Michigan, New York, Illinois.  But increasingly even in Ohio, the Deep South, Pennsylvania  &mdash;   traditionally seen as &#8220;White states.&#8221;  The future in the USA is now, and it&rsquo;s majority non-White.  Sorry to be brutally honest, but it&rsquo;s the truth that anyone who&rsquo;s done census work, or taught in the school, can see in a heartbeat.</p>
<p>I sense that this diversity more than any other factor is starting to push up massive White emigration from the USA, as is being discussed in a lot of places (e.g., see the recent US N &amp; WR article on comments on massive White emigration levels: https://tinyurl.com/5snb4j )  It&rsquo;s the same reason that Whites are also leaving Britain, Australia, Canada, Sweden and Russia in droves  &mdash;   those countries are being demographically overwhelmed, and the people know it.  </p>
<p>I personally know well over a dozen emigres from the USA, and since my background is in statistics and engineering (and since over 100 million Americans have German/Germanic background), the Central European countries  &mdash;   particularly German-speaking ones like Switzerland, Germany and Austria but also Denmark, Hungary,  Finland, Estonia, even Italy and Greece for Italian-Americans and Greek-Americans  &mdash;   dominate the list of destinations.  They&rsquo;ve had to learn German (which is sort of a technical lingua franca for Europe even outside the central corridor), obviously Italian or  Danish if they live in the relevant places, but they&rsquo;re doing fine, and they&rsquo;re raising kids in a country that&rsquo;s not only 96% White, but has tough immigration policies to stay that way generations from now.  Even once-foolish countries like France, Belgium and the Netherlands are inclining toward the Denmark/Germany restrictive immigration model that favors ethnic Diaspora (albeit broadly defined  &mdash;   Germanic, north Celtic and Slavic, Baltic), and in fact the Dutch now have the toughest immigration policy in Europe next to Germany/Austria, with France rapidly moving in the same direction.  I&rsquo;m still skeptical about those two countries but maybe they really have gotten common sense.</p>
<p>The reasons puzzle me, but the English-speaking nations seem to have by far the weakest sense of nationalism and the most disastrous tendency to succumb to the internationalist, multiculturalist, politically-correct pap that makes them &#8220;nations of the world&#8221; or &#8220;proposition nations&#8221; with no ethnic solidarity.  It&rsquo;s as though they&rsquo;re so obsessed with saying, &#8220;hey, look, we&rsquo;re cosmopolitan, we&rsquo;re not racist&#8221; that they want to kill themselves to do it, and since businesses get cheap labor and lack of ethnic solidarity that prevents worker solidarity, they increase their short-term profit while killing the country in the medium term.  Canada is in many ways even worse than the USA in terms of the PC policies, affirmative action, even prosecution for saying anything against &#8220;visible minorities.&#8221;  (The French-speaking Quebecois are the most nationalistic in the country.)  </p>
<p>The United Kingdom is now basically a PC police state  &mdash;   anything even hinting at insulting even criminal non-whites in the UK, leads to jail.  Australia, even under John Howard, took in the highest proportion of African/Middle Eastern refugee population of any Western country (and 2nd only to USA in pure numbers)  &mdash;   despite the fact that most are economic migrants  &mdash;   and now under Kevin Rudd, Australia&rsquo;s intake of Sudanese, Malaysians, Filipinos, Pakistanis, Indians, Somalis and others is among the highest in the world.  So Australia now closely parallels the rate of demographic change in the USA.  South Africa needs little introduction  &mdash;   the Dutch-Boer descendants seemed the most race-realistic, while the British seemed much more inclined to believe fantasies, victimizing themselves in the process.  So as a result, seems like the whole Anglophone world is in a process of slow, inexorable self-destruction, all for the sake of sucking up to PC elites and increasing short-term profit margins.  So the consequence is that Whites in these countries are leaving by the tens of millions to repopulate their ancestral lands in Central Europe, while most of the Anglophone world heads toward White-minority countries and (in the best scenario) some form of partition, which would be the only way to preserve some remnant of Western civilization here.<br>

			<p>All we can do is try to speak with one voice.  When Obama lost the final primary elections in several states by double digits, the media were forced to consider the motivations of the white working class and why they were rejecting him.  By migrating to certain states and increasing our numbers, we can demonstrate with lower crime rates, more functional local government, and block voting against Leftists and liberals on the national level the superiority of traditionalist conservatism.  In the meantime, the best thing to do, in my opinion, is to distance yourself physically, emotionally, and economically from the Third Worlders in our midst and their white liberal apologists in every way possible.  You can&rsquo;t have rational discussions with the stupid or irrational.  It&rsquo;s like the adage about trying to teach a pig to sing   &mdash;   it wastes your time and annoys the pig.</p>

			<p>One of the last illusions Whites may have to give up is that we can maintain some control in a multiculural society by the traditional &#8216;divide and conquer&rsquo; strategy. Blacks and Latinos don&rsquo;t like one another, so we can depend on having one side or the other on our side on a critical issue. But polls show Latinos favor Obama by a lopsided number. Poof! The final illusion? This is an ominous development to notice. Perhaps it&rsquo;s rooted in envy.</p>
<p>Lowering the group on top makes one feel better, even if it lowers the whole general level. Self-aggrandizement feeds on comparison to others. General failure makes a miserable person feel better; it gives them a gut feeling they don&rsquo;t have to bear the burden of misery alone. More rationality, simple competition is involved.</p>
<p>Balance of power in Europe was maintained in Europe for centuries by not letting any one nation get too powerful. Coalitions formed against the powerful nation if that began to happen. That would probably happen to us, even in our traditional lands, if we lost our dominance. Real politic in the future will be race-based, not nation-based(land).</p>
<p>Non-whites will, for the most part, block vote; Whites divide their votes. Whites could finally (seeing what the game clearly is) wake up. Whites could coalesce first in opinion and then partitioned land areas. That Races clearly vote and act in their self-interest could no longer be hidden, even to the most willfully blind. It would be physically dangerous not to take sides. If one side played by the &#8216;rules&rsquo; of multiculturalism and one didn&rsquo;t, the side that did would lose. The loser usually wakes up in this kind of game.</p>

			<p>The thing about this is that extremely rich whites can always be sheltered from from minorities even when they live in areas like this, as they can live in exclusive communities like Potomac MD, Cevy Chase MD, McLean VA, etc etc. <br>
It is the poor, lower middle class whites and their children that have to bare the brunt of this.<br>
For example, a rich person can send their children to a overwhelmingly white school in LA county (25% white). While a poor white in, say, Oregon (80% white) might have to send their child to a majority hispanic school.</p>

<p>Why is it that all the white folks that push diversity and multiculturalism look like him or someone related to him.  You know, the ones filled with rhythm and cool&hellip;.. bookworms, nerds, tree huggers, geeks, professors, and scholars.  The very ones who are unable to actually communicate, even minimally, with the minorities they so lovingly adore.  The ones least likely to survive a bloody confrontation with them&hellip;..<br>

<p>Yep.  Two good posts that point to something very important.<br>
Just as a Family can have a Family Scapegoat, so too can a Society and Culture.<br>
There is no doubt that the Scapegoat since the second half of the 20th century was and remains, Poor Whites.  Poor Whites were not as fortunate as the Rich ones (which includes the Middle Class) and so, had to fight in a war no one wanted. <br>
There were those who fought because they felt it was their Patriotic duty. But either way, both lost.  And to who?</p>
<p>The function of the Vietnam War and the Civil Rights Movement was to use both to accomplish two things.</p>
<p>1 - To make all forms of Anti-Americanism a Sacred Cow.<br>
2 - To make anything White a Scapegoat.</p>
<p>Forty years is enough time to look back and see if there is any justice to this position.  I think it&rsquo;s obvious and irrefutable.</p>

			<p>GetBackJack, having gone through 5 years of college myself, I understand your points about the comrade Frey types. I met them, it seems, in every subject of study. I would only amend your comment about them being the types who can not communicate even minimally with the minorities they so lovingly adore, to &#8220;not being able to communicate, in a &#8220;COMMONSENSICAL WAY&#8221;, with anyone about normal everyday problems that don&rsquo;t involve charts, graphs, deep speculation, etc. Sometimes when I&rsquo;d try to communicate with the professor Frey types, all I got was a blank stare, followed by something like, well&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;well&hellip;&hellip; </p>

			<p>It seems to me that the key problem is to change the situation of anchor babies. What other country in the world gives immediate citizenship to the child of an illegal alien born in its territory? If something so obviously ridiculous as this can&rsquo;t be fixed, then I can&rsquo;t see how the overall problem can be dealt with.</p>

			<p>When non whites outnumber us, will they be still called minorities?</p>

			<p>I guess because I live in an area where I have always been around Hispanics, I don&rsquo;t feel the same alarm I do when I think of other groups.  I see a people who are polite, hard-working and who prefer to not draw attention to themselves. I am more concerned that America has a full-fledged refugee industry that is flooding us with peoples who will never contribute in any way to  - only drain resources and make demands as they blight the towns &#8220;gifted&#8221; with their presence by government or church programs (see Somali Bantu or Hmong immigration stories).  Particularly jarring is the attempt (failed so far) to give refugee status to Liberians - yes, the ones who left the evil, oppressive America to start their own glorious country (funded by America).  Who wants them back?   </p>
<p>America&rsquo;s immigration policy: give me your least intelligent, least capable, most demanding and criminal prone, your AIDS cases (refugee AIDS is ok!), the wretched refuse you are happy to get rid of, and in return you can take back the hardworking, the intelligent, the most likely to assimilate and contribute.  An America chalk full of dependent, backward people is a liberal&rsquo;s dream population. Finally they can lord their imagined moral and intellectual superiority over all and bask in the gratitude of the lesser who welcome their management.  </p>
<p>In spite of being in an area heavily populated by Hispanics, my children have never heard a peep about anything hispanic in school. No - instead it is slavery every single year.  They have studied the Swahili alphabet, African history and geography over and over. They reached sixth grade without once ever hearing about the Maya or Aztec cultures at school.   If I think about Western culture and ideas being subverted, it certainly isn&rsquo;t to the culture of Mexico or Central America.  The saddest thing to me is that Hispanics seem to be making the huge mistake of trying to emulate the blacks and their tactics, rather than forge their own path.  Any short term gain they enjoy by doing so will be bittersweet when they realize what they helped destroy.  <br>

			<p>What is generally overlooked is the fact that although the USA might be 66% White at present,a very large fraction of the aggregate White population is concentrated in the upper age cohorts.<br>
 Sadly, in the space of only a few decades most of them will pass away, and will, of course, be replaced by the heavily &#8216;minority&rsquo; younger age cohorts.Hence, once the trend is started, it accelerates much quicker than most people realise.</p>

			<p>  I know it&rsquo;s too hard to throw out all the minorities. The only solution for  whites is to segregate themselves. Don&rsquo;t let in any minorities into white neighborhoods. Keep them white. I know the government will try to interfere with that. That&rsquo;s when the much anticipated  second Revolution will begin. Let&rsquo;s get it underway!</p>
