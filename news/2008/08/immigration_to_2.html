						<p><b>Highlights</b></p>
<p>The findings of this study indicate that future levels of immigration will have a significant impact on efforts to reduce global CO2 emissions. Immigration to the United States significantly increases world-wide CO2 emissions because it transfers population from lower-polluting parts of the world to the United States, which is a higher-polluting country. On average immigrants increase their emissions four-fold by coming to America.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m all for many of these &#8216;liberal&rsquo; causes if the facts are indeed true, however the lack of studies going in another direction, like this one does, and the silence that will meet this study that was done, point to an unpleasant &#8216;reality&rsquo;. At the top, it&rsquo;s not really about calls to save the planet but calling out whites for their evil skin color. </p>

			<p>This is a taboo about race, immigration and ecology.  Of course, the average white person on Earth has a bigger carbon footprint, because the average white is more prosperous.  But, adjusting for prosperity, non-whites pollute more.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a landlord in St. Louis City, then you can tell many stories about black tenants&rsquo; inefficient use of natural gas in the winter.  You know, jack up the thermostat to 90, then plead poverty when they can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t pay the gas bill.  In these times of higher demand and restricted supply, even if they can afford to use that much gas, it still makes it more expensive for that elderly white retiree on a fixed income who keeps his or her thermostat at 68, because the Natural Gas utility must buy more to keep up with people who yank up their thermostats up to 90.  This increases demand, jacking up the price, and thus jacking up the rates for everyone.  Even the parsimonious consumers.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;because it transfers population from lower-polluting parts of the world to the United States, which is a higher-polluting country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Translation:  low-tech, overbreeding primitives are moving into high-tech United States, where they help themselves to U.S. modern conveniences, which results in higher pollution.</p>

			<p>From the source original newspaper, </p>
<p>&#8220;While many view the contentious border fence as a government fiasco, an animal rights group sees a rare opportunity. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals plans today to announce an unusual marketing pitch to the U.S. government: Rent us space on the fence for billboards warning illegal border crossers there is more to fear than the Border Patrol.&#8221;</p>
<p>Groups like PETA and SPCA (Society for the prevention of cruelty to animals) may not be a lost cause after all. </p>

			<p>I have encountered quite a few liberal types who embrace, at the same time, mass immigration AND an anti-capitalist, pro-sustainable living position.  When I have brought this obvious contradiction to their attention (using the point made in this article), they are momentarily stunned but maintain their position nonetheless.</p>
<p>The only explanation for me is that the demographic war takes precedence for the Left, and that the whole &#8220;Green&#8221;/sustainability movement is a secondary agenda, ostensibly motivated by environmental concerns, but in reality intended as a weapon to punish middle-class, suburban, Republican-voting whites.  Hispanics and other favored immigrants are simply not expected to abide by the same rules, much as non-white countries are never expected to obey the same emissions standards as white countries.  So the seeming contradiction is actually no contradiction at all   &mdash;   both are means of sticking it to the white middle class.</p>

			<p>All this unchecked immigration will lead to the destruction of our environment.  I&rsquo;ve been deep into the interior of Mexico three times.  Every place that can be inhabited in Mexico, is inhabited.  You will find people on the most remote beach and desert plain, and they live there.  Americans should be livid about what is going to happen to the United States.</p>

			<p> It would have to make sense .The 1970 census indicated the U.S. had something like 204 million people . In the mid 70s, I would say 1977, I remember hearing on the radio that the U.S. had achieved zero population growth . Up to this point ZPG was considered to be a good thing within liberal circles, oddly enough the liberals did a 180 degree turn here and began supporting unlimited U.S. population and no borders . But the point is, in thirty years we have picked up another 100 million in population. And since we had achieved ZPG in the mid 70s, those 100 million would almost have to be largely, immigrants . 100 million more people and you have to have 100 million more jobs, houses, services  and medical care . Plus that extra 100 million are for the most part, drivers . 100 million more drivers, requires more highways, more oil . All of this adds up to more pollution . So if you wonder why your favorite nephew, uncle etc is always chronically unemployed or under employed, just consider these numbers .We have sold our childrens birthright for the illusion of a more vibrant economy .</p>

			<p>Finally a glimer of hope and responsibility from the FAR left, wow. Watch George Sorros blow his top now. His White Eugenics policy is in jepardy now. Throw some money Gerioge. (George bought out the Sierra club for $100 million NOT to mention illegal immigration.) </p>
<p>I suppose this is a great way to get millions in windfall from good old George. Threaten to talk about illegal aliens. Or is your job done now George? Think of all the bulldozed TRACK HOUSING (trees), all the gas and oil, all the oil changes in the grass. Illegal immigration has been a disaster for left wing issues. Remember the litter issue in &#8216;liberal Boston? They dumped an anti-litter campaign because it was targeted at the illegal alien population. </p>
<p>Cross your fingers </p>

			<p>This information is further evidence that American &#8220;greens&#8221; practice hypocrisy at best. It&rsquo;s obvious that most environmentalists aren&rsquo;t serious about wanting to stop climate change since they don&rsquo;t even want to stop illegal immigrants contributing to runaway emissions.</p>

			<p>   The late Jacques Cousteau thought that population growth was the chief cause of environmental degradation. Today&rsquo;s diversity liberal &#8220;environmentalists&#8221; refuse to make the connection. Our population is now growing chiefly through immigration. This is threatening the environment  &mdash;  look at the Southwest&rsquo;s chronic lack of water. However, these same &ldquo;feel good&rdquo; corporate/Hollywood environmentalists refuse to work for a curtailment of immigration because this would be &#8220;racist&#8221;.  Their faux movement is a sham and ultimately will make no difference in the degrading of our environment and the extinction of our animals. </p>

			<p>This article is a real stretch, increased green house gasses? Gufaaaw. Oh well if they can keep them out for this insane reason, what the hey. The global warming idiots, and the inventer of the internet have poluted the brains of the brainwashed masses. Global warming = government control of the air and the water, if you have that, what else remains?</p>

			<p>Since I think Nativist, there is no such thing as an immigrant but only a foreign invader.  The Statue of Liberty only stands because we exterminated our true forefathers i.e. American Indians.  If a white man thinks like a Native then good.  March with me to get the Statue of Liberty removed.  It is a sign of invasion and foreign interests and represents a sad and horrible reality to American Indians and me.</p>

			<p>The old &#8220;Star Trek&#8221; series had an episode that involved a planet that was so overpopulated that the ruling party would do anything to get the population down. The ruler&rsquo;s daughter volunteered (with Kirk&rsquo;s inadvertant help) to bring a killer virus down to the planet thereby creating a plague to which the inhabitants had no natural immunity (sound familiar anyone) so I say, nature WILL find a way.</p>
