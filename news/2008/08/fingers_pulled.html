						<p>A woman caused uproar in court when she pulled two fingers from her handbag claiming they had belonged to one of her six children. </p>
<p>Remi Fakorede, who was convicted of a £925,000 tax credit fraud, told London&rsquo;s Snaresbrook Crown court they had fallen off following a curse. </p>
<p>She said the same voodoo curse had caused her to participate in the fraud. </p>
<p>The 46-year-old from Hackney was convicted of fraud committed between 1 August 2002 and 26 June 2007. </p>
<p>When the child&rsquo;s fingers were produced, one juror burst into tears while the judge immediately adjourned the case for the rest of the day. </p>
<p>Reporting of the incident, which happened during the trial, was only lifted once the guilty verdict was returned. </p>
<p>Police were called to the court and took a statement from the Nigerian-born defendant. </p>
<p>Social Services and the Child Protection Agency were also contacted. </p>
<p>Although it is understood one of her children had lost part of her hand after suffering renal problems and developing gangrene, DNA test results are now awaited to determine who the body parts belonged to. </p>
<p>Fakorede was convicted of one count of fraud totalling £925,933, while one of her daughters, 21-year-old Denise Shofolawe-Coker, was found guilty of laundering £70,000 of the stolen money. </p>
<p>Remanding them in custody and adjourning the case until 8 September for pre-sentence reports, Judge Jacqueline Beech warned the pair they faced &ldquo;inevitable&rdquo; imprisonment for their &ldquo;breathtaking&rdquo; dishonesty. </p>
<p>Lifting the reporting ban on the earlier &ldquo;fingers&rdquo; incident, the judge said it must have been &ldquo;unpleasant&rdquo; for the jury, and added: &ldquo;I have never experienced anything as horrific as this.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The court heard Fakorede, who holds joint Nigerian and British citizenship, invented 20 aliases to make 39 false tax credit claims over a five-year period. </p>
<p>She was found out when she then tried to claim childcare as well. </p>
<p>Fakorede blamed the fraud on unknown &ldquo;forces of darkness&rdquo;, who she said had placed a &ldquo;voodoo&rdquo; curse on her family. </p>
<p>She then produced the fingers as evidence, saying the magic was so strong it caused one of her children to lose them. <br/>

			<p>How could they be found guilty? This is just normal behavior for Nigerians. The ruling is racist. This could scare away more blacks from legally or illegally immigrating to Britain, and what a loss that would be.</p>

			<p>Yeah, there are so many &#8220;immigrants&#8221; coming to the U.S. that have so much honor, and integrity, and virtue. So many who &#8220;enrich us&#8221; in so many ways. That&rsquo;s what the progressives so enthusiastically proclaim.</p>

			<p>Well&hellip; that jury was certainly enriched by the joys of Diversity.  And there&rsquo;s so much more enrichment still to come!  We are sooooo very blessed to have such people among us, sharing their rich culture with us boring old white folks.<br/>

			<p>Theres a lot of VOODOO in America  &mdash;  why worry about Great Britain.Voodoo  is practiced in the U.S.Dept of Health in Washington D.C. Something your Government tries to hide.They are hiring third worlders to infiltrate Government Institutions.Maybe someone should tell Congress.Then again,maybe people can make money selling dead voodoo monkies.MONKEYBUSINESS.A familiar practice inwashington D.C. and Congress.B.M.</p>

			<p>What&rsquo;s really outrageous is that this is an entirely unacceptable way to introduce evidence during a hearing.  Evidence must be marked and identified.  In addition, this woman may have &#8220;chain of custody&#8221; issues.  </p>

			<p>I live in South Florida, which has the largest population of Haitians outside of the island. Cops get the strangest calls and see the weirdest things down here. From goat heads to chickens to human remains. Voodoo is still practiced right here in our country. I say still because our country had a history of voodoo being practiced by African slaves and Creole communities in Louisiana. But white youths are not exempt of these practices. Recent facination with vampires, goth dress (white faces, black fingernails), new age, wicken, crystals, etc., Our country has definately steered away from its original Judeo-Christian beliefs that our forefathers established.</p>

			<p>Hmmm Some more of the most feared of all diversity issues &hellip; none other than VOODOO diversity. Incredible as it seems, VOODOO diversity is even more feared than VAMPIRE diversity! The only question I have ia did the &#8220;fingers&#8221; come from a monkey?</p>

			<p>the unknown &ldquo;forces of darkness&rdquo; are in fact the Nigerians in Britain.  This woman was no small fry bending the law  &mdash;  she was convicted on (this does not mean that this is all the fraud that she committed) fraud totalling £925,933 (which is in today&rsquo;s dollars, $1,851,866.00).  This much fraud from one Nigerian female in Britain is simply amazing, almost as amazing as was her &#8220;defense&#8221;.  Isn&rsquo;t diversity wonderful?</p>

			<p>SORRY, Brit friends&hellip; but you (your government) ASKED for this kind of stuff. In other words, the MORE third worlders you admit to your formerly proud nation, the MORE these incidents will surface. Along with a commensurate increase in crime and violence by third-world immigrant trash.</p>
<p>I was fortunate enough to visit England in the 1970s on several trips there. When the country was still clean and WHITE. Today, if I was to walk around London with a bag full of expensive photography gear, I&rsquo;d probably be mugged and robbed before using up my first roll of film   &mdash;   by England&rsquo;s immigrant population.</p>
