						<p>More than one billion people worldwide have no toilet and defecate outside, while some have to be shamed into changing their habits when presented with conveniences, a conference was told.</p>
<p>Humanitarian organisations have for decades tried various ways &mdash; be it new systems, pumps or subsidies &mdash; of getting people in developing countries to stop defecating outdoors due to the serious health risks concerned.</p>
<p>But despite their efforts, an estimated 1.2 billion people, primarily in Asia and Africa, still don&rsquo;t use toilets to defecate, a forum of experts meeting in Stockholm was told.</p>
<p>For many extremely poor people who are given toilets by aid groups, it becomes the most precious item they own and therefore they use it as a religious shrine or a dry place to store firewood, international development consultant Kamal Kar said.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&rsquo;s becoming quite apparent is that the way you actually have an impact on health, development and poverty alleviation is when people adopt certain behaviours,&#8221; Clarissa Brocklehurst, the head of UNICEF&rsquo;s water, environment and sanitation programme, told AFP.</p>
<p>In recent years, experts have found that the best method has been to shame people into using some form of toilets, even the most primitive sort, to confine excreta.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s just a matter of getting them to understand that what is a long established habit is in fact harmful and that you can do something about it,&#8221; said Brocklehurst, one of 2,500 experts meeting in Stockholm to discuss water and sanitation issues at World Water Week.</p>
<p>She cited the example of India, where 48 percent of the population, or some 665 million people, still practice &#8220;open defecation&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We actually use shame. We go into communities and say to people: do you realise how fecally contaminated your community is?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We do &lsquo;walks of shame&rsquo; where you take a group of people and you walk around and you say, &lsquo;look, here&rsquo;s some human faeces here and somebody else has had a shit there and you do this community mapping where everybody comes and says where they defecate.&#8221;</p>
<p>The maps then show that there&rsquo;s faeces spread all over the community.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you get them to realise how disgusting this is, to live in an environment that is totally contaminated,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The sense of shame is then turned into empowerment, triggering community members to take control over their lives and come up with their own solutions that work for them.</p>
<p>&#8220;And once they start using a toilet, even if it&rsquo;s just a pit latrine, they refuse to go back to open defecation. So they begin to climb the sanitation ladder,&#8221; Kamal Kar said.</p>
<p>Such community-based projects, called Community Led Total Sanitation, started a few years ago in Bangladesh and have been &#8220;wildly successful&#8221; and are now implemented in 28 countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America, according to Kar.</p>
<p>He stressed that eliminating subsidies was one of the keys to the success of the projects.</p>
<p>&#8220;Families were spending money on treating diarrhoea and other diseases but would not spend money on installing a toilet because they expected to be given money for that by aid groups,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>But removing that option prompted change, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, the assumption is that everyone is a human being, everyone has self-respect. Help them to analyse their own situation, and no one in the world will after that choose to continue eating each other&rsquo;s shit,&#8221; Kar said.<br>

			<p>There is an aprophical story here in California that sometime in the early 1960s, hippies traveled to India to visit their Maharishi.  Well, they did more than that; they got giardia and brought it back to california.  They then went camping and communing with nature in our beautiful Sierra Nevadas and did just what 660 million Indians do, &#8220;open defecation&#8221; and the result was the introduction of Giardia to our pristine mountain streams.  So, no longer could we dip our canteens into the water and drink safely.  Now it is &#8220;planet giardia.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Gandhi spent quite a lot of his time promoting the use of simple latrines.  In his time, untold millions of children died of dysentery.  India, has, however, made substantial progress in the last sixty years.  Africa and America&rsquo;s inner cities have just gotten worse.</p>

			<p>I think they should all come over here and do it. The Indians already did it in my old neighborhood and we are very pleased with the results. We could never get the old Italians, Poles, Irish and Anglo-Saxon to do it and for decades the place was so boringly clean. Now there are Indo-Guyanese and Trinidadians and in a few short years they they made the place vibrant and interesting. I can´t wait to see what they do with Central Park and the Metropolitan Museum!</p>

			<p>On a slightly extraneous note, yet still [in my humble opinion] emblematic of Third World attitudinal stumbling blocks to prosperity, please ponder this snippet from an August 26, 2008 news story about Haitians&rsquo; rallying to action in the face of Hurricane Gustav: &#8220;Hundreds of people in coastal Les Cayes ignored government warnings to seek shelter, instead throwing rocks to protest the high cost of living in the Western Hemisphere&rsquo;s poorest country.&rdquo; Then, U.N. consultant Jean Gardy saliently added, &ldquo;If the rain continues, we&rsquo;ll be flooded.&rdquo; </p>

			<p>When I worked for the local housing department in Birmingham, England, in the 1980&rsquo;s we constantly had problems with muslim tenants who defecated everywhere. The toilets became blocked and then they used sinks and baths to do it in - even in their garden and streets around the houses.</p>
<p>To add to this they slaughtered animals in their kitchens and hosed the inside of the house down.</p>
<p>They then expected our maintenance staff to come around and clear it up - complaining about damp!</p>
<p>Oh the joys of diversity&hellip;&hellip;.</p>

			<p>Just what is the state of hookworm infestation amongst the Indians?<br>
Hookworms - extremely nasty inntestinal parasites are spread byhuman excrement when people defecate in the fields, ans someone (barefoot) later treads on the same spot - even if any trace of excrement has vanished many months later.<br>
The larvae can survive in the soil for many, many months and are able to detect human skin and bury themselves through the sole of the foot.</p>

<p>*****************<br>
What is their rate of infestation?   I would suppose it is nearly universal.  There and in large parts of Africa too.</p>
<p>K. Digby raises an excellent point that is not mentioned in the article. It does speak of &#8220;diarrhoea and other diseases&#8221;, but says nothing about parasites.  This slovenly, unsanitary practice is responsible for the transmission of various kinds of worms [there are many],  flukes,  and other  repulsive parasites which are the  plague of the Third World.  But being quite an ugly topic, none of that is Politicaly Correct to mention. So it is politely overlooked and rarely mentioned.   </p>

			<p>This reminds me of stories that my grandparents told me.  When poor people in British cities were moved out of the slums, into well equipped local authority housing, they used the baths to store coal.  They&rsquo;d never seen a bath tub before, and carried on as they always had, sitting in front of the fire, scrubbing themselves down in a tin bath in the front room. Anothet thing they told me was that new arrivals from India and Pakistan used to eat dog food, as it was the freshest and cheapest meat they had ever seen.</p>

			<p>About four years ago, a popular British leftist newspaper invited its readers&rsquo; sympathy for a Pakistani girl whose family had forcibly taken her for marriage to their home village. The headline ran &#8216;They took her from here (picture of a modern English city) to this (a ramshackle village) where a toilet is a hole in the ground shared by 1000 people. Our countries are being overrun by these uncivilised Moslems,etc who must view with wonder that intricate old European invention, the flush toilet</p>

<p><br>
So that&rsquo;s where the damned giardia came from.</p>
<p>I remember in the 80s, when I was still backpacking, having to buy newly-introduced water filters for our canteens because of the establishment of giardia in the California watershed, not just in the Sierra Nevadas. At the time, no one could figure out where giardia had come from and how it had spread throughout the state water system so quickly</p>
<p>I remember hearing a few tales around the campfire of those who had gotten this nasty little parasite, how debilitating it is and how hard it is to get rid of  &mdash;  no one had any idea what it was at first because we didn&rsquo;t have giardia in our once-pristine water supply.</p>
<p>Thanks for the information; what you wrote makes perfect sense.</p>

			<p>Using the restrooms at the San Francisco airport was always an adventure.  They were ultra-modern, but some of the folks using them had obviously never seen a toilet before.  (Auto-flush, by the way, is not a good introduction to the device, since it doesn&rsquo;t teach you to finish the job.)  </p>

Remember ol&rsquo; Jed Clampett, whose toilet he thought was a &#8216;foot washer&rsquo;? Of course, Granny, Ellie and the gang would forgo washing their podies because it would be more desirable as a fixture of some mystery. The Clampetts were a fictional, fantasy television family. Yet they epitomized what in the rest of the world is perhaps not so much ignorance of facts, rather than something more fundamental: S-T-U-P-I-D-I-T-Y.</p>

			<p>Recently I heard/read that many Mexicans come up here to El Norte, having no experience with toilets that flush.  They often shop in the discount stores here, take a dump, and then don&rsquo;t flush.  However, they do sometimes wipe themselves, but rather than throwing the used toilet paper in the toilet and flushing it, they throw the used TP in the trash can, on the floor, in the corners, on the walls  &mdash;  anywhere but actually in the toilet and flushing it.  </p>
<p>That explains why so many times, when I go into even a new discount store, the bathrooms are pigsties&hellip; because PIGS have been in there and took a dump and piss and were too stupid to flush the damned toilets after themselves. </p>

<p>Try using a toilet at a bus station in the southwest. And the comment of the people throwing toilet paper in the trash can and not in the toilet to flush it, it is more often than not done in the middle east and Asia, because the toilets that DO flush will not handle the bulk of paper. When I first encountered that it was, and of course still is, disgusting. This is STILL done here in the middle except for the westernized malls. A Kuwaiti girl i know told me that after a visit to the U.S. her parents came home and installed western toilets and it was fabulous she said.</p>

			<p>What a rich cultural vein we are mining here.  I can offer anecdotal confirmation of the poor sanitary habits of Mexicans.<br>
1. Years ago when I worked in a factory, the management had to summon all of us to a meeting to be informed, in English and two dialects of Spanish, that toilet paper belonged in the toilet, not on the floor.  I felt some pity for the guys who did the translating, because it had to be embarrassing to acknowledge that your own people were primitives that needed to be told such things.<br>
2. My wife went to Mexico on some do-gooder errand, and was too polite to refuse to swim in the local, murky, pool.  She and her companions took a month or two to recover from the various ailments that followed.<br>
3. No more than a year ago, a helpful Mexican parent, staggered at my ignorance of  progressive health practices, recommended that I de-worm myself twice a year.  He also helpfully suggested an over-the-counter product that worked well for him and his family.  I thanked him, wrote the name of the stuff down, and was grateful that I have a sink in my classroom.  I always wash my hands before leaving the room.  <br>
     Given my experience with Mexicans, I find it easy to believe these outwardly fantastic reports.</p>

			<p>It is not in Africa or Asia,or Mexico by the way,that those sorts of things are common place.I went to Brazil several times and it is exactly the same,even in the south of the country,but off course,in northern regions the situation it`s worse,by far.I went to Salvador,in Bahia,and i was amazed to see people urinating in daylight in front of hundreds of people,i went to bathrooms in restaurants and i was shocked for what i saw,i never saw anything so filthy in my life,the floor was a pool of urine,the seat of the toilets covered by feces&hellip;totally discusting!<br>
Another thing i saw,and this is valid for all Brazil,in private homes the people have the costume not to throw the toilet paper to the toilet,instead,they throw it to a bucket&hellip;i never understand their logic,since the feces could block the toilet more easily than the toilet paper. </p>

			<p>&#8220;I remember in the 80s, when I was still backpacking, having to buy newly-introduced water filters for our canteens because of the establishment of giardia in the California watershed, not just in the Sierra Nevadas. At the time, no one could figure out where giardia had come from and how it had spread throughout the state water system so quickly&#8221;</p>
<p>The giardia were already there. Beavers and other mammals carry them. A dutchman was the first to see them, in 1681, through his newly-invented microscope. Cysts have been found in the archaeological excavation of a pit toilet dating from the Crusades. </p>
<p>The thing is that until the late 1970&rsquo;s everyone believed that giardia was a harmless occupant of everyone&rsquo;s intestines. In the 70&rsquo;s someone finally figured out that the little buggers caused dysentery, and that&rsquo;s when you and your buddies discovered the need to filter those &#8220;pristine&#8221; mountain streams.</p>

			<p> <i>I went to bathrooms in restaurants  [in Brazil] and i was shocked by what i saw, i never saw anything so filthy in my life, the floor was a pool of urine, the seat of the toilets covered by feces &hellip; totally discusting! <br>
 <br>
Another thing i saw,and this is valid for all Brazil, in private homes the people have the custom not to throw the toilet paper imto the toilet, instead,they throw it in a bucket.</i><br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re entirely right. I know what you mean.  I&rsquo;ve seen the same thing in bars and restaurants in Venezuela and Colombia   &mdash;   even in  movie theaters.   In fact, in some places the urine was so deep that they put planks on the floor so that you didn&rsquo;t have to walk in it.   </p>
<p>As for the paper, in many Third World countries, you&rsquo;re not SUPPOSED to put the paper in the toilet because the paper is so course (sometimes they use cut up newspapers) that  the plumbing or septic systems can&rsquo;t handle it. That was the case even in Spain until it joined the EU and got more modernized.</p>
<p>By the way, those places (in South America) at least have plumbing or a pretense of it. They are NOTHING compared to a native-style bathroom in any  little out-of-the-way village in Morocco.  The  stench there was so hideous, I couldn&rsquo;t even venture inside. Nor even go near it. </p>
<p>Incidentally, the typical Arab (or Turkish) toilet is just a hole. Period. That&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re accustomed to. And apparently many must prefer using it.  I remember the main railway station  in Munich (Germany) used to have  both Western and Turkish-style restrooms, according to one&rsquo;s preference. That was years ago; I don&rsquo;t know if they still do.</p>

<p>I beg to differ with you about Spain. I lived there for 5 years in the sixties and you always threw the paper down the toilet. Yes, they used torn up newspaper in a lot of places, but it was no problem. </p>
<p>I was in Mexico many times in the nineties and stayed in nice hotels and there was no problem there. However, one time I went to a city up north and was surprised to see that at the doctor&rsquo;s office I visited (on business)there was a little receptacle next to the toilet for the soiled paper. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say that Spain in the sixties was a lot more civilized than Mexico in the nineties. </p>

			<p>Upmarket loos in the MidEast are a delight, honestly and truly; a sort of nifty microphone bumsquirter is at hand as well as plentiful toilet paper. Super-cleanliness for perhaps 5% of the population is the rule. As for low-class loos for the humbler classes of society [at Saudi wayside bus-refuelling-point restrooms etc.,] see all the comments about India and China. You need to eat lots of hardboiled eggs to keep your guts rock-solid if travelling from Dammam to Hail by bus.</p>
<p>Concerning countries like France and Spain 40 years ago and much of provincial Bulgaria today, the coarse loo paper, once used, is to be put with other people&rsquo;s poo-smeared loo paper in the far-from-fragrant plastic bucket or basket next to the loo because the diameter of the waste-pipe is much smaller than the plumbing in richer countries like the USA, the UK and northern Europe in general. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting thought that modern plumbing has probably saved - or prolonged - nearly as many lives in the developed world as modern medicine. </p>
<p>Until very recently even quite upscale neighbourhoods in Kyoto and Sakai were not connected to the mains sewage system and the arrival of the hydraulic-suction honeywagon on a warm summer day was a brief but very memorable assault on the sense of smell of the newcomer and visitor. </p>

No doubt of that.  I&rsquo;m reluctant to dwell further on this subject, but I made no comparison of the two. We are not in disagreement;  and I am glad that you confirm what I said about the newspaper.   I don&rsquo;t remember, after all this time, exactly which countries or locales used separate receptacles for the newsprint.  But it was a common thing.  Even Germany had very course toilet paper (or newsprint) during the 60s. I clearly remember a German friend&rsquo;s father remarking  (about &#8216;68) that she had been &#8220;spoiled&#8221; with luxuries [such as toilet paper]  because she had lived several years in England (there was still a big gap in standards of living then, something that&rsquo;s the reverse now).  </p>
<p>Certainly,  both Spain and Mexico were advanced compared with some places in South America or Morocco.  But even then, in  some out-of-the-way places in Spain (including, I think, railway stations)  they used the old-style Turkish toilets &hellip;  ie. a  simple hole in the floor.</p>
<p>My post was principally about the non-European world.  The reference to Spain was only in passing.</p>
<p>Of course, Spain today is vastly different compared to  what it was then. Investment from the EU has transformed it.  But even then it was European.  (Although Napoleon thought differently: &#8220;Europe ends at the Pyrenees.&#8221;)</p>

			<p>The reason why plumbing is or was excellent in Britain is due to chloera epidemics that raged in the mid 19th century.Although generally forgotten today the mortality and suffering caused was comparable to the mediaeval plagues.<br>
Cholera was imported into Britain from India, it was unknown before the 19t century.Epidemics raged in most big cities, and as the germ theory of disease was not known ten, no one really had a clue about its mode of contagion - until certain people hypothesised that contaminated water was the source.Preiuosly in London and elsewhere only a few had piped water (which was unchlorinated), most relied on wells in their back yard for water - which usually also contained a &#8216;privy&rsquo; that cross contaminated the drinking water.<br>
  This connection was realised and due to the extremely high mortality the Government allocated funds for a massive sewer network (&#8216;privies&rsquo; were banned and all houses were compulsoralyl connected to a W.C.) and simulateously a huge nework of piped mains water put a tap into every dwelling.<br>
 This early measure in public health worked, and cholera was extinguished in Britain.</p>

Most interesting.  England was far ahead of its time. I understand that London&rsquo;s water supply was innovative and outstanding, setting it apart from the rest of Europe.  </p>
<p>In France, it was not until the 1980s that every house had running water/indoor plumbing.  This was also achieved apparently through a massive government campaign. This explains the French/Continental penchant for bottled water (and wine). It&rsquo;s considered trendy in America now, the habit being brought back by movie stars, but It was a necessity in Europe. On the Continent, they used to say &#8220;Don&rsquo;t drink the water!&#8221;  for good reason.   Even in Milan today, I would not drink the water; I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s &#8220;safe&#8221;, but its full of strange white sediment and tastes terrible   &mdash;   even when boiled. I wouldn&rsquo;t use it even for cooking.   (In France, it&rsquo;s good .)</p>
