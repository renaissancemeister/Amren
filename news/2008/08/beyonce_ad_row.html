						<p>WHAT COLOUR is Beyoncé? She features in an ad for L&rsquo;Oréal hair dye, which has been accused by some websites of whitening her skin. It took three days for the mainstream press to pick up the story. The colour-code chart for skin, unlike hair, is a sensitive subject, so most newspapers waited for L&rsquo;Oréal&rsquo;s response.</p>
<p>The cosmetics firm denied any wrongdoing: &#8220;It is categorically untrue that L&rsquo;Oréal Paris altered Ms Knowles&rsquo;s features or skin tone in the campaign for Feria hair colour.&#8221;</p>
<p>That presumably excludes the usual lighting design and touching up, which turn flesh-and-blood mortals into ethereal objects of desire.</p>
<p>Her skin does look darker on the red carpet, but whether it has been lightened to give her more crosscultural appeal is a tough call. Did the artistic director want the colour-code chart to match her hair dye? It&rsquo;s not a black-and-white issue. There are many shades of grey or, in this case, golden brown.</p>
<p>For instance, Beyonce rarely has an afro .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. outside of an Austin Powers movie. Her hair is usually shorn from the head of some poor white girl. Still, it&rsquo;s a free market. Beyonce is either buying into the dominance of white consumer culture and/or simply wearing hair that is more manageable and fashionable.</p>
<p>Tyra Banks, who also wears weaves, has spoken about her &#8220;issues&#8221; of not letting her hair grow into an afro. She knows the media is white-centric for the same reason they&rsquo;re youth-centric and airbrush out wrinkles: corporations regard young, white folk as having the most disposable income.</p>
<p>Beyonce&rsquo;s ads will appear in magazines like Elle and Allure, which usually have white cover girls. Ask Naomi Campbell how many more covers she thinks she would have if she had been that beautiful .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and white, and how her supermodel pals had to help her fight for catwalk shows. (Ask her nicely.) Whitney Houston had the same problem. She was marketed to white teenagers, but blacks criticised her music for being too white. She was booed at the 1989 Soul Train Music Awards, and Keenen Ivory Wayans did a &#8220;Whitney Houston&rsquo;s Rhythmless Nation&#8221; sketch on the show In Living Colour .</p>
<p>Houston told Ebony magazine in 1991: &#8220;Don&rsquo;t say I don&rsquo;t have soul or what you consider to be blackness. I know what my colour is. I was raised in a black community with black people, so that has never been a thing with me. Yet, I&rsquo;ve gotten flak about being a pop success, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that I&rsquo;m white.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, she married and divorced &mdash; after allegations of drug use &mdash; bad boy singer Bobby Brown. Although she started as a gospel singer like her godmother Aretha Franklin, she cultivated an image and life with a dangerous edge, embracing the worst urban black stereotype. Her career never recovered.</p>
<p>In March, Barack Obama, the poster boy for a post-racial/bi-racial society, had the opposite problem to Beyonce when Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s campaign was accused of darkening his image in a negative ad campaign. The image on Clinton&rsquo;s website does appear darker than the original MSNBC debate.</p>
<p>But the colour-code of negative ads never has pastels or bright Technicolor hues with raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens, or girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes. They will be bathed in moodier shades and, if you have a non-Caucasian subject, he/she will inevitably look darker.</p>
<p>The Clinton camp blamed a &#8220;saturation-desaturation&#8221; production process. We&rsquo;ll never know. But what does all this suspicion say about us? Ever since Michael Jackson&rsquo;s alleged vitiligo, a skin condition causing the skin to lose pigmentation, the media regularly scans images of black figures to assess their colour.</p>
<p>When gossip magazines pore over images of white folk who look orange or brown or salmon pink, there are no cultural or racial incendiary devices hidden in the commentary. They are not subjected to the same loaded scrutiny as Beyonce, Naomi Campbell, Whitney Houston, Tyra Banks or Barack Obama.</p>
<p>The implication is that to be darker either creates an exotic supermodel like Alek Wek or alienates whiter people or ignites a negative stereotype. Commentators called the Obama picture &#8220;sinister&#8221; and &#8220;menacing&#8221;. But the very presumption behind this indignant accusation of prejudice feeds the prejudice itself.</p>
<p>Richard Dyer says in his book, White, that we are more race-obsessed than colour-obsessed: &#8220;The myriad of minute decisions that constitute the practices of the world are informed by judgments about people&rsquo;s capacities and worth, judgments based on what they look like, where they come from, how they speak, even what they eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>I had a former colleague whose mother is black and father is white. On our first day, the boss&rsquo;s PA gave us a form to fill out. We were faced with three boxes: &#8220;Black&#8221;, &#8220;White&#8221; or &#8220;Other&#8221;. I ticked &#8220;Other&#8221;. She ticked all three. We handed them back and counted how long it would take for the irate PA to return.</p>
<p>Caucasians appear to regard whiteness as tantamount to nothingness, a blank canvas devoid of colour against which all others compare. It&rsquo;s not that simple: my old colleague married a redhead and they have ginger, fair-skinned, blue-eyed kids.</p>
<p>Our cultural colour-code chart is clearly way beyond void.<br>

<p>In fact, I firmly believe Whitney hooked up the blacker than black Babby Brown solely to prove her blacker than blackness.  The eventual result was something just short of suicide.</p>
<p>Speaking of Whitney, how come the media never paid much attention to her anti-white tirade in Texas(?) just before she hooked up with Bobby?  Right, I already know the answer.<br>

			<p>The truth is that everyone in entertainment is fake.  The standard for beauty anymore is tan skin and full lips.  For instance I read Jessica Alba has pale skin and black hair but she is tan and has lighter hair in her photos.  The same is true for Jennifer Lopez and Mariah Carey.  Then you have all of these white women in entertainment who are tanned too so that they look exotic or mixed.  I think many whites believe tan looks healthier and many blacks believe lighter skin (tan) looks better.  This is all a blip in history.  Americans are going to be so strange looking in the future if they all melt together.  They all think mixed race is good looking because of what they see in the media.  I see alot of mixed race people in my college and they just aren&rsquo;t as good looking as whites or blacks.</p>

			<p>The cold hard truth is that blacks are made to look whiter because other blacks, not whites, find that more trustworthy and appealing.</p>
<p>Simply put, they know better than anyone else, the truthful negative associations with dark skin.</p>

			<p>Speaking of her ex husband Bobby Brown, this black yellow bellied coward once beat, (with the help of two of his much needed body guards) some white guy in a night club, because he objected to him hitting on his scantily clad wife who was there(not a smart move on their part). She really knows how to pick the losers.</p>

			<p> It took three days for the mainstream press to pick up the story. The colour-code chart for skin, unlike hair, is a sensitive subject </p>
<p>Focusing on her lighter looking skin was a way of projecting guilt on whites, for trying to white-wash her to look more appealing. But the real issue here is, why is a black woman who wears human hair lacefront wigs advertising hair color? It is no secret that Beyonce wears them, some photographs taken of her with high resolution cameras, have shown the lace at the hairline. Word has it, she wears the highest grade virgin (non-processed) human hair, in a golden brown shade. A natural color usually only found among the white race, so it is probably Russian/European. That long silky golden brown hair, has become her trademark, and there is no denying that it gives her a more Eurocentric look, but blacks tend to keep quiet about that, since hair is very sensitive topic among black women. So many of them wear human hair weaves and wigs these days, but few like to talk about it, when they do, they will lie and say white women wear them just as much, or that their hair comes in all textures, including straight. It&rsquo;s ridiculous that none of them have a problem with her pitching hair color, in her human hair wig made of Caucasian hair, but hone-in on the fact that her skin looks a few shades lighter in an ad, and try and say it is whites who are trying to project a more white-washed image on her. Although, Loreal does deserve some blame here, but it is mostly for false advertising.</p>

<p>There is a lot of truth to that. The current trend in the industry, seems to be one where they make everyone look like racial hybrids. Many blacks like to say that the white stars who tan their skin, and enlarge their lips are trying to appear black, while forgetting that the golden color of tanned skin, is exceptionally rare among blacks, and even among mulattos.But it can be achieved with the right amount of skin bleach, since Lil Kim&rsquo;s skin mysteriously changed from a true brown, to a golden tan color, while her black hair became straight and blonde, and her dark brown eyes changed to blue.  Blacks are proud of their full lips, because the industry hypes them as sexy. But they ignore the obvious fact that, few black women wear their hair in it&rsquo;s natural kinky texture these days. Of course, the industry also favors long silky, luxurious manes. So that the current trend is for all races of women to adopt ethnic traits which are not often found among their people. The look is one of  golden skin, full lips, high cheekbones, large, preferably light colored eyes, big firm gravity defying breasts, small waists, round backsides, and long silky hair. It is not about one race trying to look like another, but about ALL races extracting traits from other races. With white women enlarging their lips to ridiculous proportions, and black women gluing silky caucasian type hair to their heads, and Asian women having surgery to make their eyes appear rounder. These fake hybrid Barbie dolls, could be a part of our liberal media trying to brainwash all of us into embracing multiculturalism, and racemixing. Although few mixed races ever take on all of those traits.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve said it before and I&rsquo;ll say it again: the White woman is the most beautiful woman of all the races.  When people point out this or that black woman as being beautiful, it&rsquo;s always to the degree that they approximate and exemplify White standards of beauty.</p>
<p>Hence the procliviy of black women wearing hair weaves, or, more absurdly, dying their hair blond.</p>

			<p>Beyonce&rsquo;s woes notwithstanding, others have noted a disturbing trend in the greater entertainment world overall - making all women appear to be &#8220;of color&#8221; on some level. Fake tanners, too much sun, make-up and/or whatever they use, white women on TV and film are becoming darker and darker year upon year! Clearly, this is no accident or coincidnce, as America&rsquo;s love-affair with all things &#8220;Diverse&#8221; grows and grows - at least in the mainstream. </p>
<p>Just a note on the full lips some have mentioned. This has come up here before - many caucasian&rsquo;s have very full lips naturally. In fact, from Brigitte Bardot to Brad Pitt many of those considered the most beautiful of our race have naturally full lips. I believe the lip-plumping popular in Hollywood types, etc. is in response to that - not some misguided attempt to appear black, more exotic, or the like.</p>

			<p>Don&rsquo;t modeling shoots use quite a bit of lighting? If so, it&rsquo;s not surprising that Beyonce&rsquo;s skin would appear several shades lighter than in reality. Everyone&rsquo;s skin can appear lighter or darker depending on the light source. Some people are so obsessed with looking for racism that they&rsquo;re unable to stop for a minute and actually THINK.</p>

  Their attitudes are always the same, whether you mention Beyonce or Tyra or so many other black celebrities, they hate us and they let us know it.</p>
<p>   However I am always so thankful that I am white.  No matter how bad they treat us, that does give me a lot of comfort. Even though they have the power now, I would not change places with blacks, their obsession with color is all consuming. We should always remind ourselves that we were blessed by the gods and made to be white people. Very comforting, that.</p>

			<p>Whitney Houston had the same problem. She was marketed to white teenagers, but blacks criticised her music for being too white. She was booed at the 1989 Soul Train Music Awards&rdquo;<br>

<p>Yep, I always suspected she hooked up with Bobby Brown for the same reason. At the time she was seen as this fresh faced, and  GASP (wholesome) young black girl, with an amazing voice. And you bet, whites loved her back in the 80&rsquo;s. It wasn&rsquo;t long after being booed off Soultrain that she started dating bad boy Bobby Brown. Ironically if possible, I think she came to surpass him where negative image goes. If you judge her last public singing appearance her voice, is now shot. She cleans up well appearance-wise, but I doubt that voice will ever be quite the same. And even more ironic, Bobby Brown turned up on a reality show, and was seen flirting with the Whiter than White, former Marcia Brady,  where he also was attempting to become-Get this, a country western singer. Seems today, he is actually trying to distance himself from Whitney.</p>

			<p>  Standards of beauty away from the Western classical Ideal have been gaining ground in the last decade. Thicker lips and darker skin and hair, as well as muscular fuller figures (i.e. Angelina Jolie, Jessica Alba) are considered the most beautiful. The ethereal, delicate beauty of an Audrey Hepburn would be out of place in today&rsquo;s racial Hybrid crazed Hollywood/Television Industry.</p>

			<p>The beautiful &#8220;Women of Color&#8221; are hyped to the degree that they are simply BECAUSE they are unusual, not because all of them are gorgeous and must be considered mainstream, average American Beauty. The older models and actresses like Christie Brinkley and Pamela Anderson (yes, she&rsquo;s a nut-job but used to be pretty) are the beautiful blonde women that used to exemplify American ideal beauty  &mdash;  not Tyra Banks or reaching further back, that old haggard female, Naomi Campbell. Without getting too far into it, I&rsquo;d say the pushing of these women of color is another subtle way of brainwashing the average American teen or pre-teen. &#8220;If YOU can&rsquo;t be a model, have a mixed race daughter and SHE can be a model&#8221; is the message poisoned so delicately into those glossy magazines.</p>

<p>This is true, and while the media idealizes the racially ambiguous hybrid look. I still think it can&rsquo;t be compared to the delicate, and more refined beauty of stars Audrey Hepburn or Grace Kelly. Jolie, Alba, Jlo and Beyonce, all meet the beauty trends of today, but do not come close to the true classic beauties from Hollywoods golden age. Even so, we will continue to see more light skinned black women, and more overly tanned white women, and even more Latinas, as western countries continue to diversify, the media and advertisers will continue to try and capture this ever growing market.</p>

			<p>I have personally never seen what I would call an attractive black woman. Most become obese from not working, eating free food and spitting out welfare babies. Bdsides this they tend to me manlike and mouthy. This is why many black men seek out weaked minded white women. Weak minded can be the only explaination any white woman would be even seen with a black.</p>

Many of these wome stated that most blacks have low self esteem because of being black, mostly dark blacks.  They feel inferior to light skinned blacks.  These women also admitted that blacks can&rsquo;t get along &amp; they need to learn to get along.  These women even go so far as being critized by their own &#8220;sistas&#8221; because they choose to &#8220;stay natural&#8221;.  <br>
They felt that they are more inferior to their own kind verses to Whites.  I found their discussion rather interesting.  They even admitted that Whites are not to be blamed for most of their problems in the black &#8220;community&#8221;.   I was actually shocked!<br>
If it wasn&rsquo;t for the White liberals, we wouldn&rsquo;t be in this mess!</p>

			<p>Pam Anderson is a natural brunette who was made by God to have small boobs and normal sized lips. Yet she only became a star when she butchered her original self.</p>

			<p>L&rsquo;Oreal must be breathing a sigh of relief, that the media is more concerned with the fact that Beyonce&rsquo;s skin tone photographed a bit lighter, instead of having the media take them to task for using such an obvious fraudulant spokesmodel to pitch their haircare line. </p>
<p>Here is Beyonce looking as she normally does, with her glorious European hair. </p>

<p>And here she is at the airport returning from a flight, caught in the wee hours with her natural African hair. Notice if you will, even the black man standing next to her appears shocked at the state of her natural hair. </p>

<p>Hiring Beyonce to pitch L&rsquo;Oreal haircolor, is like hiring Brad Pitt to pitch FUBU </p>

<p>Improbability is not tantamount to impossibility. </p>

			<p>Two words, that characterize the standard of beauty for blacks (along with light skin,) good hair.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s been posted before, but black skin doesn&rsquo;t photograph well.  Yet another example of blacks getting the short end of the evolutionary stick.</p>

			<p>The penultimate line of the article was shocking - and quite disturbing, given that I assosciate all three feautures with European &#8216;purity&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&#8216;It doesn&rsquo;t say but if this colleague is black then it&rsquo;s not likely.<br>

<p>That&rsquo;s what I thought &hellip; if it is true it&rsquo;s phenomenal. Do you think he invented it just to hammer home his point in the article? I hope so- otherwise this is worrying, subverting the standards by which we class ourselves as white.</p>
<p>And I love redheads!</p>

Google &#8220;Simone Simons&#8221; and enjoy a very pretty white woman singer far more attractive than beyonce&rsquo;. </p>

			<p>read Malcolm X, blacks trying to be white started in the 60&rsquo;s. very sad. i guess being racist against whites isn&rsquo;t enough, they need to find &#8216;degrees&rsquo; of brownness, to degrade. Shows their intelligence.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s not so unlikely that Red Head/Blue Eyes + Dark Skin = Red Head/Blue Eyes. </p>
