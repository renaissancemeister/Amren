						<p>San Francisco schools earned bragging rights on state standardized tests again this year &mdash; performing better than the state as a whole across every grade in both math and English &mdash; but any celebration was clouded by the subpar proficiency of the district&rsquo;s African American students, who continued to fall further behind their peers.</p>
<p>Nearly all other categories of San Francisco students, regardless of ethnicity, income or English language ability, outscored the city&rsquo;s black students in California Standards Test results posted Thursday.</p>
<p>On the plus side, the scores of black students did go up about 1 percentage point in math proficiency and nearly 1 percentage point in English.</p>
<p>But that wasn&rsquo;t as much as everyone else, meaning the achievement gap in San Francisco got worse.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The number of white students who were proficient or better in both math and English was about 50 percentage points higher than the city&rsquo;s black students. In second-grade English, for example, 23 percent of blacks were proficient, compared to 74 percent of whites.</p>
<p>Special education students had slightly higher proficiency rates than black students in second-, third- and fourth-grade math as well as fourth-grade English.</p>
<p>The district tested 41,000 students, including 4,800 African Americans, in grades two through 11 in the spring.</p>
<p>San Francisco schools face a steep uphill battle in boosting the test results of black students, educators noted.</p>
<p>The test results are not surprising, said Omar Khalif, ombudsman for the city&rsquo;s Juvenile Probation Department and an advocate for education and children&rsquo;s issues. Khalif, who is running for a seat on the school board in November&rsquo;s election, said black students often face obstacles tied to neighborhood poverty, crime and broken families.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The San Francisco school board adopted a plan this year to identify schools where the achievement gap is widening. Those closing the gap will also be recognized and modeled.</p>
<p>Also, city voters in June approved a school parcel tax to raise an estimated $29 million annually, boosting teacher salaries, training staff on the needs of disadvantaged students, and providing incentives to teach in hard-to-staff schools &mdash; where students are more often than not black, Hispanic and poor.</p>

			<p>You figure, San Francisco is the vanguard of American liberalism, and their school system is no different, yet even these pure, magical liberals with nary a hint of racism or bigotry in their soul can&rsquo;t seem to get rid of the nagging &#8220;achievement gap.&#8221;  Yet, they seem to be blaming themselves, in the true tenets of the egalitarian faith.</p>

			<p>[&#8220;The achievement gap is the greatest civil rights issue facing our country today,&#8221; school Superintendent Carlos Garcia said in a statement.</p>
<p>[The number of white students who were proficient or better in both math and English was about 50 percentage points higher than the city&rsquo;s black students. In second-grade English, for example, 23 percent of blacks were proficient, compared to 74 percent of whites.]</p>
<p>The article mentioned that everyone was ahead of blacks, but as is usually the case this leftist journalistic yellow rag emphasized the gap as being between whites and blacks, even though the other races are also ahead of blacks and they now are more numerous than whites, especially in California.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to know why the gap between blacks and Hispanics is never written about since Hispanics outperform blacks also and are more numerous than whites in the schools in California.</p>
<p>And how about the black/Asian achievement gap which is about the same as the black/white gap, and, again, Asians constitute a LARGE number of students in California?</p>
<p>Even in states like California where whites are a minority the educational achievement gap concentrates on them and blacks, carefully avoiding making the same comparisons with other races and blacks.</p>
<p>White leftist self hate is ingrained in journalists coming out of the propagandized schools of indoctrination and can neither think objectively nor can they report that way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no wonder newspaper circulation is plummeting all overe the country and people now turn to the internet to get their news.</p>
<p>Newspapers, thankfully, are fast becoming passe in this country today, and good riddance to a bunch of liars who seek to indoctrinate, rather than fairly inform, as this biased article clearly reveals.</p>

<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>African PARENTS in San Francisco are the folks who face a struggle to improve testing scores which, of course, they won&rsquo;t man up to as they didn&rsquo;t in 1968, 1978, 1988, or 1998.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t be any different in 2018, either.</p>

			<p>As much as blacks&rsquo; achievement gap is a serious (unsolvable?) problem, there is something that concerns me much more about most of black population. They are much more likely to form <i>ad hoc aliances</i> directed against whites than whites are to engage in the so-called &#8220;racism&#8221; against blacks. </p>
<p>This spontaneous proneness of blacks to &#8220;unite&#8221; against whites is a disaster waiting to happen and needs to be exposed even before the achievement gap, IQ gap, etc.<br>

			<p>The scholastic gap between black students and all other students in San Francisco will continue to widen because the few remaining blacks in this city will be only the Public housing blacks, who are always the poorest, least intellegent, and most violent.And all of the egghead educrats will continue to scratch their noggins and ask why, but a lot of them really do know why, but they just do not want anyone to accuse them of racism.Hey Whiteplight, thanks for the Medal of Freedom award that you gave me a while back.I plan to keep it.</p>

<p>Yep. That&rsquo;ll fix things. Throw MORE money at the problem. Why didnt they think of that before? blacks would have been on a par with whites by now. Wouldnt they?</p>

<p>Waaaaa? Hasn&rsquo;t this allready been done time and again in cities all across the country? Mo&rsquo; Money to help the poor? And the SanFransikans voted for this?</p>
<p>Holy smokes, Liberals just can&rsquo;t wrap their tiny little minds around the concept that certain groups of people are simply incorrigible. American Blacks will never ascend to a higher moral/income level.  The best we can do is offer them 13 percent of the territory of the United States, as that is their population percentage, and allow those portions of the country to secede and create a new wonderful Black Nation.</p>
<p>I suggest allowing Mizzippi, Loozanna and Albama to secede from the Union and invite all American Blacks to partake in a wonderful Utopian blacks-only-brand-new-country. I mean, let&rsquo;s just get it over with. Give them all 40 acres and a mule, but far away from our industrial centers. They will destroy themselves in 20 years.</p>

			<p>I bought the Chronicle today just so I could see how they would spin this (it was the lead story). Not a hint that there might be inate intelligence differences between the races. </p>
<p>Blacks did terrible except at one school where the improved miraculously. I am sure those tests were &#8220;adjusted&#8221; by the black administrators.</p>
<p>The best thing I gleaned from the article was from the white superintendent&rsquo;s response. He said &#8220;We will have to redouble our efforts&#8221;. That, my friends, is how you hang on to the pension.</p>

			<p>Amazing!</p>
<p>An article on education in San Francisco that contains NOT ONE WORD about Asian students!</p>
<p>Kind of like writing an article about bread-making and not mentioning flour.</p>
<p>Is there any better proof of the hatred the mainstream media has towards whites?</p>
<p>Black students can&rsquo;t read, it&rsquo;s the fault of whites. Black students can&rsquo;t pass tests, it&rsquo;s the fault of whites. </p>
<p>Whenever blacks have trouble, it&rsquo;s the fault of whites.</p>
<p>And we should never, ever mention the fact that blacks slide to the bottom of any racial ranking. Thus, we must ignore the 200lb. hispanic elephant in the schoolroom, and we must ignore the 2,000lb. Asian elephant in the schoolroom.</p>
<p>Were we to look all around, and see that black students fall below hispanic, Asian, &amp; white students, the we must admit that the fault for black failure lies not with whites, but with BLACKS THEMSELVES!</p>
<p>And we really can&rsquo;t have that, can we?</p>

			<p>No human can change what is inherently designed by the Divine.  Within the racial genetic make-up of every human being is coded abilities.  One cannot exceed those genetic capabilities.  A dog cannot be more than a dog no matter how perfect of an external environment is provided.  If the genetic capabilities are there, they will be expressed no matter how difficult the external environment.  A recent European Nobel Prize winner was hungry, an orphan, and homeless during most of his childhood but he still succeed because of his genes. The environment is irrevelant except to the people who are leeching off taxpayer&rsquo;s hard earned money chasing after windmills.  </p>

			<p>The large sums of money specifically spent to close the achievement gap should be considered theft.</p>
<p>If I hired a contractor to fix my leaky roof, and he only managed to increase and decrease the flow but never actually stop the leak, do you think he should be paid?</p>
<p>Paying people to close any academic achievement gaps should be results based. No results? No money. Something tells me they would get smart about intelligence real quick. </p>

			<p>When are the liberals going to stop torturing these poor little African children by telling them that they must somehow measure up to the superior white children in their classes, when it has become blaringly obvious to everyone but the liberals that it is impossible? Telling them that they will all grow up to be doctors and scientists and professors is giving them an impossible dream, even with &#8220;dumbed down&#8221; tests, AA, and all the other preferences. Most of them are going to end up aimlessly wandering the streets, involved in drugs, gangs, prostitution and creating herds of more children like themselves. A good basic education in lower-blue-collar jobs they are capable of doing would help a lot. This wouldn&rsquo;t solve all the problems, but it would help not to give them impossible expectations and what (for them) are impossible goals.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;Special education students had slightly higher proficiency rates than black students in second-, third- and fourth-grade math as well as fourth-grade English.&#8221;</p>
<p>WHAT?  I had to read that twice.  The special-ed kids may be slightly above the black grade-schooler, but probably on an equal footing with black high-schoolers.  Pathetic.</p>

Speaking in defense of the failed &#8220;Black&#8221; race, they are at least as intelligent as are those apologists who write such articles and those who run the Government school industry who believe their &#8220;learning gap&#8221; with the other races can ever be &#8220;closed&#8221;. </p>

			<p>Doesnt matter. Take UC Berkeley, a typical respected college in California lists black students to be 7% of its population. Blacks are around 5-7% of California&rsquo;s overall population. Harvard has 9% of its students listed as african-american. Meanwhile white youth at Berkely or UCLA are listed to be 30%( at most) of its population with the roughly half of its student body as labeled asian. </p>
<p>How is it that black students can represent themselves at elite schools such as Berkeley, Princeton, Harvard etc but white american kids barely reflect their overall proportion of the population despite being less disadvantaged?</p>

			<p>and what about the white and asian students who have to share a classroom with these chronic &#8220;under-achievers&#8221;? how much do they suffer from being in a classroom where there are constant interruptions, vandelism and a generally hostile environment? how much more would they learn if their teacher didn&rsquo;t have to cater to the slowest students? how many students get drawn into &#8220;the life&#8221;? Any white/asian parent who allows their children to attend a school that has a black pop. of 5% or more is cheating them out of a decent education</p>

			<p>  No, black students will not &#8220;catch their peers.&#8221; Neither will huge additional spending work miracles in bringing blacks&rsquo; grades up to snuff. I can understand in a way why these politicians, educators, et al, will run to the end of the earth and back to avoid stating the bald truth: The blacks are less successful in school because, as a group, their IQs are significantly lower than those of Whites, Asians and even Hispanics.</p>
<p>  To admit that fact would take the monkey off the backs of the educationist mahatmas, in a way; but it would also probably precipitate rioting in the streets among the blacks whose excuses had been suddenly stripped from them. Poor educationists! They have hold of a tiger&rsquo;s tail, and they can neither continue to clutch it, nor let go.</p>

			<p>&#8220;How is it that black students can represent themselves at elite schools such as Berkeley, Princeton, Harvard etc but white american kids barely reflect their overall proportion of the population despite being less disadvantaged?&#8221;</p>

<p>How it is - is through the displacement of whites in favor of Asians in the SF region.  A nation that allows foreign arrivals to take over their schools is planning national suicide.  I have known some of these Asians.  All they care about is their nation of origin, be it China, the Philipines, etc.  They have little or no allegiance to the U.S.  </p>
<p>The futre Western U.S. = New China with Hispanic servants.  Whites for sex and other entertainment.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Nearly all other categories of San Francisco students, regardless of ethnicity, INCOME or English language ability, outscored the city&rsquo;s black students in California Standards Test results posted Thursday.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet they end up earmarking $29 million dollars to solve the problem.</p>
<p>Cognitive dissonance has become the foundation of our national psyche.  No wonder so many people are on anti-anxiety medication.</p>
<p>There are obviously other problems that have to be addressed.  Black culture is one of them.  Good luck with that, because no one&rsquo;s allowed to talk about that one.  </p>
<p>Jeremiah Wright and others have been saying that black kids learn differently.  If that really is true, then we need to create homogeneous learning environments that will meet different populations&rsquo; needs.  Screaming in horror at the idea of separating students isn&rsquo;t going to do any good.  Sounds like some hard, unpopular decisions have to be made and committed to.  </p>

			<p>How is it that black test scores in that liberal bastion of San Francisco still lags behind every other racial group? They can&rsquo;t use the &#8220;legacy of Jim Crow, or slavery&#8221;, as they might have done in the South. San Francisco is oner of the wealthiest cities in the USA - then why are black test scores no better than they are in Baltimore, Cleveland or Detroit?</p>
<p>Could it be that Dr. James Watson was absolutely correct? I&rsquo;d rather take absolute correctness over political correctness any day of  the week.</p>

			<p>The best we can do is offer them 13 percent of the territory of the United States, as that is their population percentage, and allow those portions of the country to secede and create a new wonderful Black Nation.I suggest allowing Mizzippi, Loozanna and Albama to secede from the Union and invite all American Blacks to partake in a wonderful Utopian blacks-only-brand-new-country. I mean, let&rsquo;s just get it over with. Give them all 40 acres and a mule, but far away from our industrial centers. They will destroy themselves in 20 years. </p>
<p>This is an unacceptable scenario. To start with, even though SA and Zim are different countries they flow into each other and spill their problems onto each other. They must be ISOLATED not separated. I suggest Hawaii! it is far away, can be very isolated (quarantined) and we don&rsquo;t really get anything from Hawaii anyway nor can most of us afford to go there e.g.! Useless. If it has to be mainland U.S. property, give them New Jersey, Long Island and Michiganistan. Also! the 29 million dollar figure comes from the anticipated skimming for the SPECIAL ED teachers which will be black, as will everyone else involved in this scam, and it is nothing less that those in that area deserve for their shameful conduct towards the U.S.M.C. earlier this year. We have not forgotten that BTW. </p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s something that probably hasn&rsquo;t occurred to the leftist high priests of San Fransisco and other cities: the inherent genetic I.Q. gap that exists between blacks and other races has been made much worse because of leftist policies.  Here&rsquo;s what leftists have done to increase the I.Q. disparity between the races:</p>
<p>1)  They have abolished forced ghettos/segregation.  This has allowed the smartest blacks to leave the ghettos for better areas, leaving the less intelligent blacks isolated in the ghettos where they are exposed only to their own kind, breed with their own kind and feed off each others dysfunctions.</p>
<p>2)  They have supported welfare programs that encourage the least intelligent blacks to breed like rats while those of higher education have fewer children.  Yes, this is a trend worldwide but government welfare has made it much worse.</p>
<p>3)  They have enabled less intelligent blacks to advance well beyond their natural abilities through affirmative action and hence to contaminate the gene pool of higher ups.  This has also served to normalize disfunctional behavior within wider society.</p>
<p>4)  They have glamourized ghetto &#8220;culture&#8221; and ghetto blacks to such an extent that black men are considered &#8220;cool&#8221; in the eyes of women and girls of every racial background.  This translates into a lot of babies between them who should never have been born - babies who carry inferior I.Q. genes.</p>
<p>5)  They have made it taboo to even mention the obvious I.Q. gap and thus impossible to address the problem.  When possible, they even make it illegal.</p>
<p>&hellip; and then, after artificially widening this gap, they have the audacity to complain about it and whine about it every day!</p>

			<p>I was in the SF area last May to attend a Berkeley graduation of a relative in the Education Dept. Had to sit through a rant by a black Prof about how everywhere the &ldquo;system is broke&rdquo; as proven by the fact that blacks are disproportionally failing in it. The achievement gap seemed to be the main concern there and everywhere the almost entirely white crowds were assured about how hard they are working on this gap problem. Of course, no mention ever of IQ, not even to dismiss it. What a performance.</p>
<p>What we have he folks is a powerful RACIAL GAP INDUSTRY, and it&rsquo;s the perfect industry to be employed in because</p>
<p>(1)	there is no solution to the racial gap phenomenon <br>
(2)	no one will dare mention why there&rsquo;s no solution<br>
(3)	accordingly funding will always be thrown into this industry which will always be called inadequate due to perennially poor results resulting in even more funding for implementations of &ldquo;new&rdquo; ideas, projects, initiatives, etc.<br>
(4)	this industry can&rsquo;t die since the truth (though quietly &amp; widely known)  is well understood to be absolutely forbidden to be even thought about. <br>
(5)	And to make extra sure this lucrative industry, which employs so many in so many ways, lives forever, angry black spokesmen will dutifully pop up when a sent of criticism is in the air to absurdly proclaim the gap a &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; issue.</p>
<p>What other industry that can deliver zip for results for decades and still keep getting lots of your tax money forever? But don&rsquo;t think it exists just to humor blacks, the thing is that very many whites in education and politics use it to make a good living. <br>

			<p>Black underachievement, and the rationalizations for it, have become an industry in which both whites and blacks richly benefit.  There are many such modern industries that have sprung up and exerted their tentacles through our social perceptions and institutions - &#8220;domestic violence&#8221; and &#8220;global warming&#8221; are just a few.  Chances are - if you see any advertisement anywhere that has an &#8220;Ad Council&#8221; logo at the bottom, it&rsquo;s serving one of these industries.  So far, none of these industries has done anything but grow larger and more pervasive.  </p>
<p>One result of the industry of black underachievment is that blacks are represented in elite colleges absurdly close to their proportion to their percentage of the population.  In the end, it&rsquo;s not about ideas, or rationality, or fairness, but about economic and political power.  Unless the unashamed desire within whites and especially white males for self-preservation can be reawakened, it will be over for us.</p>

			<p>What a shocker!  Who would have guessed that black students in San Francisco lag behind whites, Asians, and all other identifiable racial and ethnic groups.</p>
<p>All I can say is that we&rsquo;d better get down to identifying the root causes, which as we all know are white (and now Asian)racism and a &#8220;sense of hopelessness&#8221; among black students.</p>
<p>I mean, everybody knows, knows for an absolute fact, that race is merely a social construct and that races possess exactly the same levels of intelligence, motivation, and self-control, and that any evidence to the contrary is simply based on flawed data.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear that sterner measures are required to bring the black students up to white and Asian levels of achievement.  Perhaps the whites and Asians should be punished, even beaten, in an effort to drive the last vestiges of racism from their thoughts and utterances, which of course is the clear cause of the poor performance of the blacks.  Truly exceptional white and Asians should face possible expulsion for their thoughtless attempts to excel and humiliate their black brethren.</p>

<p>Closing the &#8220;racial gap&#8221; is not only dishonest - it&rsquo;s immoral.  There is no evidence that white students have reached the top of their potential, and that blacks haven&rsquo;t - and that arbitrary assumption is what all of this is based on.  In fact, tests show quite the opposite - whites gain much more than blacks when given extra attention and resources.  Closing the racial gap can only happen, in a limited fashion, by lavishing resources on blacks and ignoring whites.  </p>
<p>People have been so conditioned to accept racial discrimination in favor of blacks that they don&rsquo;t see the fundamental immorality of it.  But do a thought experiment and remove race from the picture.  Would it be moral to ignore red-headed students and lavish attention on blond students because blond students averaged lower test scores - and especially when red-headed students could gain as much or more by equal amounts of resources and attention?  So, in effect, the no child left behind program is just another assault in our government&rsquo;s war against whites.</p>

			<p>All the money in the world will not help black students learn anything.  It&rsquo;s true that genetics is involved, but when you combine that with the fact that they are taught from an early age that being a criminal is &#8220;cool&#8221; and learning anything useful and acting civilized is being &#8220;white&#8221; that is another big part of the problem. Then they are also taught at an early age to be racists, hate mongers, and bigots in Sunday school by those like the Rev. Jeremiah Wright.  <br>
    As a result you can put these black students in the best schools and they will tear them down in a week.  You can put them in a classroom with the best students and the best teachers and they will disrupt the classroom and threaten both the teachers and students with violence.  All the liberal whining and crying is not going to change a thing. They were never meant to be here and I had no part whatsoever in bringing them here and since they are so proud to be &#8220;AFRICAN&#8221; I don&rsquo;t see why they would have a problem with going back. Then they won&rsquo;t have to put up with us &#8220;white people&#8221; and our horrible culture of being civilized, intelligent, and productive.  All the above statements go for Mexicans and Hispanics as well.  If you all hate whites so bad, and our culture offends you so bad, and America offends you so bad, then &#8220;THE GET THE HELL OUT&#8221;.           </p>

<p>You are kidding aren&rsquo;t you? You do realize that the low scores of black students are a reflection of their average double-digit IQs of 85?</p>
<p>White teachers are under the gun to close the achievement gap between Whites/Asians and blacks/hispanics. The only way to do this is by cheating  &mdash;  and by this I mean teachers giving the kids the answers.  I&rsquo;ve heard many anecdotal stories that support this  &mdash;  especially when it comes to the 7th grade-level exit exam students must take in California to receive a high school diploma.</p>
<p>According to NCLB: &#8220;&hellip;all children should reach a proficient level of academic achievement by 2014 in math and reading. </p>
<p>The report declares this goal of 100 percent proficiency by 2014 to be &#8220;audacious &hellip; morally right &hellip; and attainable&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I would add laughable.</p>
<p>I cannot tell you how many useless, boring, pointless professional developments, teacher training, seminars, that I have been mandated to attend since the implementation of NCLB  &mdash;  all of it and I mean ALL OF IT directed at closing the intractable testing-score gap (which, OF COURSE, is blamed on teachers, White teachers in particular).</p>
<p>Schools are threatened constantly with &#8216;state take overs&rsquo; (whatever that means), dismissal of staff, demotions of administrators if test scores do not meet so-called NCLB mandates. Unbelievable amounts of money and time is wasted on this intractable issue.</p>

I went through the original article and found that they actually <i>don&rsquo;t</i> blame whites for the low educational achievement of blacks. &#8220;Obstacles,&#8221; yes, but whites, no.</p>
<p>Also found that the comments by readers of the SF Chronicle are generally in agreement with the comments of Amren posters. </p>

			<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine the frustration a capable teacher must feel trying to do right by the students who want to learn yet unable to get rid of the, let&rsquo;s call them what they are (Criminals)and their threats and trouble making conduct. Poor or disrespectful conduct towards a teacher when I went to school simply did not cross my mind. Caught in Paris, Texas in the 3rd grade throwing bottles on the highway, a highway patrol officer made me and my few friends also caught, sweep and pick up litter on 5 miles of that same highway. During that cleaning, we found several bicycles, weapons and 1 dead human being. I think we would have had to clean 10 miles if the dead body didn&rsquo;t bring our punishment to an end. Anyway, I don&rsquo;t throw bottles or disrespect teachers (never did desrespect teachers in any case)</p>

			<p>BonBon, Black kids that age don&rsquo;t have IQ&rsquo;s of 85. Even adult Blacks don&rsquo;t have 85 IQ&rsquo;s anymore. Adult Black IQ now is around 89. Those kids aged 7-9 I would wager that their IQ&rsquo;s are around 93 or so. OTOH, these may be public housing Blacks, so they may be the worst of the worst, and their IQ&rsquo;s may indeed be lower. But I would wager that nowadays the average 7-9 yr old Black kid has a 93 IQ. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been studying this forever, and US Black IQ&rsquo;s are just not that low anymore, esp compared to Blacks elsewhere. I don&rsquo;t understand why they do poorly in school and why they screw up so much, but I don&rsquo;t think lack of brains has much to do with it anymore. It&rsquo;s more in the nature of their personality. A lot of them just have no interest in learning anything whatsoever, period. Remember I taught them for years now.</p>

The point is that it doesn&rsquo;t work, so try something different for once already! What&rsquo;s that old saying? Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result? 40 years of doing the same thing over and over and not working ought to be enough to teach even the dimmest of school beaurocratsthat it&rsquo;s now time for something entirely new, not a revamp of the old &#8220;throw money at it&#8221; approach.</p>

<p>Are you sure you&rsquo;ve taken into account the possibility that black IQ is actually overstated because those blacks who make themselves available in settings where it is tested (i.e., not in prisons, not school drop-outs) tend to have higher IQ&rsquo;s than other blacks?  Also, keep in mind that the testers are impelled by an extraordinary selection bias to &#8220;boost&#8221; black IQ&rsquo;s.  This will happen, even if subconsciously.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;The achievement gap is the greatest civil rights issue facing our country today,&rdquo; school Superintendent Carlos Garcia said in a statement.</p>
<p>Typical.  Wrong!   Achievement is not a right, not any more than anybody in the Olympics has a &#8220;right&#8221; to a gold medal.  Freedom is.   What you achieve is up to you.  </p>
<p>Assuming, of course, that you are free to try, which whites are often not when faced with laws that prescribe discrimination against them in school &amp; job applications,  extra punishment for crimes, and even legal restrictions on their speech which does not apply to non-whites. </p>
<p>The greatest civil rights issue facing our country is the retention of the country itself. </p>
<p>White people are being dispossessed of their country and freedom, having their property (I include income in this definition)  confiscated by the government, and ever increasing restrictions on their movement and speech, as more of the country is taken over by those hostile to whites.  </p>

<p>Robert:</p>
<p>According to The paper, &#8216;Thirty Years of Research on Race Differences in Cognitive Ability,&rsquo; by J. Philippe Rushton of the University of Western Ontario and Arthur R. Jensen of the University of California:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The Black-White difference has been found consistently from the time of the massive World War I Army testing of 90 years ago to a massive study of over 6 million corporate, military, and higher-education test-takers in 2001</p>
<p>The Worldwide Pattern of IQ Scores&hellip;. for Whites, about 100; and for Blacks about 85 in the U.S. and 70 in sub-Saharan Africa. &hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Is there REALLY that much of a difference between an IQ of 85 and 89?  It is still in the double digits, greatly limiting the level of cognitive ability and achievement for these students  &mdash;  and mandates that the only way the government can &#8216;level the playing field&rsquo; is through specious programs such as AA, set-asides, dumbing down the school curriculum, twisting college applications to reflect such stupid things are &#8216;life experience&rsquo; over scholarship, &#8216;re-norming&rsquo; (read dumbing down) SAT tests, and more.  </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the latest ridiculous idea:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;UC&rsquo;s Board of Admissions and Relations with Schools (BOARS) wants to change the admission rules to their 10 schools, including lowering the minimum high school GPA to 2.8 and removing the requirement of two SAT Subject Tests&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="http://townhall.com/columnists/LarryElder/2007/12/20/how_to_make_an_un-level_playing_field_more_un-level" rel="nofollow">http://townhall.com/columnists/LarryElder/2007/12/20/how_to_make_an_un-level_playing_field_more_un-level</a></p>
<p>Why do you think the TOP higher education system in California is doing this?  To help White and Asian children?</p>
<p>I too taught black children for many years  &mdash;  many of whom were very bright, but most were not.  Testing scores, although rising in the elementary grades for years, are flat in middle and high school, despite billions of dollars being pitchforked into studies and (failed) practices as to how to close the &#8216;achievement gap&rsquo;:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;High schools tended to show worse performance than elementary and middle schools, one of several trends that Superintendent of Public Instruction Jack O&rsquo;Connell expressed concern about in a conference call with reporters Thursday&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dailynews.com/search/ci_10209694?IADID=Search-www.dailynews.com-www.dailynews.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailynews.com/search/ci_10209694?IADID=Search-www.dailynews.com-www.dailynews.com</a></p>
<p>Could this be because by high school the students with the double digit IQs have topped out?</p>
<p>Do you know how frustrating it is to sit in yet another professional development and told yet again that &#8216;something must be done to close the achievement-gap&rsquo;?  All the while knowing full well that the problem is that low IQs cannot achieve past a certain level. Of course, to speak of this is instant career suicide.</p>
<p>As Harvard historian Stephan Thernstrom and his wife, Manhattan Institute think-tanker Abigail explain:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Blacks nearing the end of their high school education perform a little worse than white eighth-graders in both reading and U.S. history, and a lot worse in math and geography&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>http://www.vdare.com/Sailer/no_excuses.htm</p>
<p>Of course, when those in charge of the educational-industrial complex spew this:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; Jack O&rsquo;Connell, California&rsquo;s top bureaucrat for schools&hellip;announced the bold discovery that lagging black and Hispanic test scores are not caused by poverty alone. One thing he&rsquo;s sure about: The problem is &#8216;absolutely, positively not genetic.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Let me ask this:  Is it fair to keep telling blacks that the can &#8216;be anything they want to be!&rsquo; knowing this is simply not possible?  Is it fair to continue to lower standards for college admissions so more unqualified blacks can attend, at the expense of White and Asians children?</p>
<p>Is it fair for White and Asian children, who have high SAT scores and grades to have to step aside as blacks with lesser qualifications are given limited slots for choice colleges?  What would you tell them, life isn&rsquo;t fair  &mdash;  to suck it up and get used to it?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more but I&rsquo;ll leave it at that for now.</p>

			<p>I agree with one previous poster who said black kids are more stupid or less mentally able than their white, asian or hispanic counterparts. When will the educators stop wringing their hands in a guilty response because a group of kids will not or cannot learn. Bill Cosby was right and black parents hate him for the truth he speaks. In the meantime big companies are looking for graduates with names like Robert, James and not Shaniqua and Le Bron. America&rsquo;s problem this black race and they will not be filing anyone&rsquo;s wildest hopes anytime soon. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s tough to discover the exact nature of a problem when it is forbidden to research that problem - or even to admit that it exists.  In the atmosphere of fear and repression that political correctness brings, there is little incentive to study race differences and every reason to avoid that topic.  Furthermore, once research is done, any results that don&rsquo;t mesh with the party line could destroy careers so we don&rsquo;t even know if we can trust the research coming out of major institutions (most of us do not trust them because of their obvious bias).</p>
<p>The concensus here (and my opinion) is that black underachievement is the result of both lower I.Q. and higher testosterone levels.  Add to this a culture of entitlement fostered by the leftist establishment and failure is to be expected.  Yes, of course black-American inner-city &#8220;culture&#8221; does a lot of damage and stifles education - but such a culture does not grow in isolation.  It thrives where genetics allow it to thrive and where wider society tolerates it.  Nature and nurture do not exist independently of each other.  They form a feedback loop for better or for worse.</p>

Just require ALL teachers, educrats, politicians, gubmint employees, union leaders, etal to send THEIR kids to these schools.  It won&rsquo;t close the &#8220;achievement gap&#8221;, but you will see a big change in the way our schools are run.</p>
<p>Any guesses how many of the above send their kids to private schools?  Last I heard it was above 90% for teachers, probably even higher in SF.</p>

			<p>Hideously White and Bonbon, I believe that Black adult IQ has been bumped up to 89 now and Black child IQ to 92 due to *changes in IQ norming in the US*. IQ tests for formerly normed on US Whites = 100. A couple years ago, I think they changed it to US population = 100. So now the US White adult IQ is 103 (kids 102) and the US Black adult IQ is 89 and child IQ is 92. So there is an 11 pt gap between B-W kids and a 14 pt gap between B-W adults. </p>
<p>Things haven&rsquo;t really changed much, just the whole scale has been bumped up. But even Murray and Rushton concede that the B-W gap has shrunk about 3 points in the last 30 years.</p>
<p>Bonbon is correct that with a 10-14 pt B-W IQ gap, &#8220;leveling the playing field) = equality of outcome, is not possible without much magic, fakery and nonsense.</p>
<p>Bonbon, keep in mind that Black IQ declines as Blacks age. With renorming, Black 5 yr olds may have IQ&rsquo;s of 98. That&rsquo;s going to drop to 89 by age 24. Black high schoolers have lower IQ&rsquo;s than Black elementary students, and this will reflect in scores.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not impressed with Linda Gottfriedson&rsquo;s work, cited above by Bonbon. Hardcore hereditarian. I&rsquo;ll take Charles Murray any day over her. She cherry-picks tests to come up with the tests reflect her &#8220;no progress&#8221; thing.</p>
<p>Plus, that &#8220;no progress&#8221; thing does not include Flynn Effect Black IQ rises of 20 pts since 1930. You can claim FE is not an intelligence rise, but Black skulls have gotten dramatically larger since 1900 to the point where they are dramatically different from African skulls. US White and US Black skulls now look more alike than either skull does to its ancestors 150 yrs ago. We really are smarter than our grandparents.</p>
<p>Before renorming, Black US 5 yr old IQ was 95. Dropped to 91 by age 12. Figures that age 6-9 sees an IQ around 93. You need to understand that this whole (Black IQ is 85!!) thing only applied to adults. Black kids always had higher IQ&rsquo;s than Black adults, even 150 yrs ago.</p>
<p>The B-W achievement gap has shrunk by 1/3 over the past 30 yrs and there is evidence the decline was related to spending. Obviously, given IQ realities, there is going to be a point of diminishing returns here.</p>

			<p>The government will never allow, especially with the next clown, the position that there are innate racial differences in IQ, as many in Government are said minorities. They simply cannot do this. How you can get around it is going to be important, because the money involved is being wasted by the billions in an economy that is competing with Asia, the &#8220;model&#8221; minority.</p>

			<p>There&rsquo;s a simple fact here which is quite obvious but to which while liberals seem to be immune. This is that whites have a compulsion to build and create while Blacks have a compulsion to murder and destroy. Watch the local news or read the morning paper in any major American city and this becomes quite apparent. The government has and will throw billions of dollars away in a wasted effort to educate these people. They are what they are and will never change.</p>

<p>&#8220;Both Flynn and Murray agree that a gap between average black and white scores on IQ tests remains, but since they are both looking at the same information, why don&rsquo;t they agree on whether the gap is closing or not? The difference turns on how they slice the data. Murray prefers to look at test scores by birth cohorts, e.g., how the scores of white and black 18-year olds stack up to one another. <i>Those data show no closing of the gap on tests administered since the late 1970s. It remains at about 15 IQ points</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Murray believes exactly the opposite of what you attribute to him. Shocking.</p>

			<p>Attempting to override nature is not going to work. If higher teacher salaries and school funding could solve this achievement gap, blacks in affluent suburban school districts would perform on par with whites, but they don&rsquo;t. Having gone to such a school, I can safely say that their shortcomings have nothing to do with racism and everything to do with genetics and culture. </p>
<p>If a culture where hard working black student were ostracized for &#8216;acting white&rsquo; and gangsters, thugs, pimps and drug dealers are the biggest role models weren&rsquo;t bad enough, most of them are just plain dumb. It has been proven that black Americans average an IQ of about 85- a very low score that puts most of them below the VAST majority of whites and asians. Very few of them have what it takes to excel in school or college. </p>
<p>Black dominance in the NBA is due to their &#8216;innate superiority&rsquo; at this game; this is fine but when whites dominate something, it can only be due to discrimination. </p>

			<p>         There is a problem with black genes if you ask me. Wherever blacks exist they tend to be outdone by others economically. Mexicans outperforming blacks in the U.S.A or South Asian Indians outperforming blacks in Guyana, it is the same story. <br>
But the best example is Madagascar.<br>
The island so close to Africa was originally settled by Malay/ Indonesians from South East Asia. One look at the map will make you aware how amazing this feat is as far as distance and maritime skills are concerned. Later they brought black Africans from the mainland. There has been extensive intermarriage between the two, blacks and Malays with a sprinkling of European, Indian, Chinese and Arab blood. The tribes with more Malay blood live in the mainland while the tribes with more black blood live in the coasts. But this is what I get from Wikipedia<br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Madagascar" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Madagascar</a></p>
<p>          &ldquo;Recent research suggests that the island was uninhabited until Malay seafarers arrived around the first century A.D., probably by way of southern India and East Africa. Other historians believe that the Malays crossed the Indian Ocean and only reached the African mainland after having established durable communities on Madagascar. Subsequent migrations from both the Malay Archipelago and Africa further consolidated this original mixture, and 18 separate tribal groups emerged. Malay features are most predominant in the central highlands people, the Merina (3 million) and the Betsileo (2 million); the remaining 16 tribal groupings are coastal peoples (côtiers) who are predominantly of East African origin, with various Malay, Arab, European and Indian admixtures. The largest coastal groups are the Betsimisaraka (1.5 million) and the Tsimihety and Sakalava (700,000 each). Malagasy society has long been polarized between the politically and economically advantaged highlanders of the central plateaux and the côtiers along the coast.&rdquo;<br>
  <br>
        Can you believe that? Malays who themselves find it hard competing economically with the Chinese in Malaysia, even when mixed with African blood tend to dominate the more pure Africans. This is how the President of that country, Marc Ravalomanana looks like. Looks like a Maori to me.<br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Ravalomanana" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Ravalomanana</a></p>
<p>What better proof that Africans tend to loose out wherever they are. Mulatos always outperform pure blacks.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Plus, that &ldquo;no progress&rdquo; thing does not include Flynn Effect Black IQ rises of 20 pts since 1930. You can claim FE is not an intelligence rise, but Black skulls have gotten dramatically larger since 1900 to the point where they are dramatically different from African skulls.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Flynn Effect is no more than leftist tripe trying desperately to trick people into believing blacks are smarter than they are which is pure unadulterated bunk.</p>
<p>Black I.Q. has been the same for the last 90 years, with the exception of the adjustments made to favor blacks, because they continually wailed that the I.Q. tests were biased. </p>
<p>Every expert I&rsquo;ve read on the subject of I.Q. tells us that I.Q. remains about the same throughout a person&rsquo;s life, with the possible exception that education will cause a slight rise in some.</p>
<p>The kind of change in skull shape and brain size you&rsquo;re referring to would take thousands of years to complete per the average speed of change observed in humans.</p>
<p>I think the information you offer this forum is not only  misleading and incorrect it&rsquo;s absolutely bizarre.  For some reason you have an interest in presenting incorrect black data, and I&rsquo;m at a loss to see what it is, because it appears to be far beyond your liberal views and goes into the realm of absurdity.  </p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been studying this forever, and US Black IQ&rsquo;s are just not that low anymore, esp compared to Blacks elsewhere. I don&rsquo;t understand why they do poorly in school and why they screw up so much, but I don&rsquo;t think lack of brains has much to do with it anymore. It&rsquo;s more in the nature of their personality. A lot of them just have no interest in learning anything whatsoever, period. Remember I taught them for years now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If black I.Q.&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t that low anymore as you say, then why do those of us who work around blacks and teach blacks find that they understand very little and they learn only a little or not at all?  I mean, that&rsquo;s in line with accepted studies that don&rsquo;t have a liberal bias.  And why do the experts not leftist propagandists disagree with you?</p>
<p>Now don&rsquo;t tell us that you &#8220;taught blacks for years now,&#8221; because your perception of low intellect might be vastly different than ours and the experts.  Apparently that&rsquo;s exactly the case, because to say that blacks are smarter now just doesn&rsquo;t jive with what we experience in the real world.  It doesn&rsquo;t square with their test scores either, their failings, and their silly, incompetent logic that their talking t.v. heads rant about.</p>
<p>Why they screw up so much is precisely because of low intellect.  High testosterone has absolutely nothing to do with it as white males having testerone levels as high as blacks have become doctors and other high intellect professional people.  Vladimir Klitchko is only one example.  He&rsquo;s heavyweight champion of the world and qualified for medical school in Russia, not an easy admittance.</p>
<p>The problem besides low intelligence is due to other shortcomings and inabilities.  It&rsquo;s been accurately mentioned on here many times that blacks are lacking in the very same things they have been lacking in for 5000 years in Africa.  If US blacks had their own country we would see them fail just as badly now as they have been doing in Africa all along.  Where is the problem in understanding that, since we have copius amounts of proof practically knocking us over everyday?  Have  you not seen New Orleans, Detroiit, and other black run cities degenerate to third world levels?  What other proof do you need?</p>
<p>The implication of your claims that blacks are smarter but still perform poorly is alluded to for the purpose of making everyone accept that blacks are smart, then once that falsity is instilled, you can go on to ask that everyone work together to find out why there is an achievement gap, because you have effectively erased intelligence as a factor.  Sorry, old boy, that won&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not an achievement gap just between whites and blacks, but blacks have an achievement gap behind every other race in the world and trying to fool yourself and everyone else that that isn&rsquo;t true isn&rsquo;t going to do anything to raise black achievement.  Blacks will continue to fail and the reason will be because of leftists who refuse to accept the truth and prefer to live in a kind of fantasy land.</p>
<p>Now, here&rsquo;s a real kicker that will likely make you go ballistic.  US black I.Q. is really only about 78, if mixed races and mulattoes aren&rsquo;t considered, so they have advanced slightly over their African brothers, but not more than anyone would expect.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind that I.Q. tests have been changed to favor blacks, because they did so poorly and wailed so miserably loud about bias, the tests were designed to favor them with fewer questions regarding logic and reason and other abstract types of thinking.  Whites and other races do about the same on all tests and need no adjustments.</p>
<p>If I were to lay aside all emotions, my conculsion would be that blacks belong in Africa because they cannot compete in an advanced society and it isn&rsquo;t up to whites to hold their hands and try to come up with solutions to a problem that is strictly a black one. </p>

			<p>Mr. Lindsay raises interesting points above, especially this:</p>
<p>&#8220;You can claim FE is not an intelligence rise, but Black skulls have gotten dramatically larger since 1900 to the point where they are dramatically different from African skulls. US White and US Black skulls now look more alike than either skull does to its ancestors 150 yrs ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>I still think the Flynn Effect is consistent with its being a statistical &#8220;artifact&#8221;, based on differences over time in environment and the no-doubt egregious book-cooking of &#8220;re-norming&#8221;. In plainer language, I suspect it&rsquo;s an apples-and-oranges comparison, and those don&rsquo;t count.</p>
<p>But I could be wrong!  &mdash;  the cranium size comparison makes sense as a driver of FE. Two interesting points might be made about it, and FE in general:</p>
<p>1. Hold everything: just what do we mean by &#8216;black&rsquo;? As far as I can see here in Amerikwah, that includes all the mulattos, &#8220;chocolates&#8221;, Beyonces, or whatever else we might call the mongrels of black-white miscegenation. Is there any doubt that we have more of them today  &mdash;  a *lot* more  &mdash;  than a lifetime or more ago? In other words, is it not likely that the &#8216;Euro&rsquo; genetic component of the &#8220;black&#8221; population is much higher now than it used to be? And would that not be entirely consistent with significant gain in &#8220;black&#8221; IQ  &mdash;  as in Flynn&rsquo;s &#8220;effect&#8221;? Sounds like a fine research project for the smart guys (at least those whose career would not be wrecked by daring to ask the question).</p>
<p>2. It&rsquo;s hard not to believe that Mr. Lindsay&rsquo;s &#8220;dramatic&#8221; increase in blacks&rsquo; skull size has everything to do with a salubrious environment (nourishment, medicine, standard of living, etc). Those kinds of environments don&rsquo;t just &#8220;happen&#8221;. Those people  &mdash;  the *enormously* fortunate descendants of the African-North American slave trade  &mdash;  have something to be thankful for, don&rsquo;t they? </p>
<p>What group deserves those thanks? </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a good post, but every bit of data I&rsquo;ve read on the subject, and I&rsquo;ve read a lot, reference the small cranial capacity of blacks.  The way the politically correct liars exaggerate things, if there were an increase in black skull size, they would be screaming it from the roof tops, wouldn&rsquo;t they?  But all we know of it is what a poster claims as fact, which isn&rsquo;t factual at all.</p>
<p>I think Mr. Lindsey&rsquo;s claims of skull size are incorrect and I&rsquo;m surprised to see people on here gullibly accepting what he says as fact.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;I&rsquo;m not impressed with Linda Gottfriedson&rsquo;s work, cited above by Bonbon&hellip;She cherry-picks tests to come up with the tests reflect her &#8216;no progress&rsquo; thing&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Robert:</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t quote Gottfriedson&rsquo;s work.  The quote is from a joint paper by Jensen and Ruston; Gootfriendson wrote a friendly commentary about the paper.</p>
<p>I also prefer Murray.  As far as cherry-picking information, Murray notes that Flynn does the same thing:</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;&hellip;Mr. Murray had a much larger body of evidence on which to base his arguments. Relying on the results of countless tests of intelligence, academic achievement and aptitude that have been administered for decades to millions of people, Mr. Murray demonstrated that the no matter how it is measured, the intelligence gap persists despite every attempt to close it&hellip;Mr. Murray also wondered why Mr. Flynn and other egalitarians base their conclusions on a few obscure studies while ignoring the many comprehensive surveys that undercut their position&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Robert writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The B-W achievement gap has shrunk by 1/3 over the past 30 yrs and there is evidence the decline was related to spending. Obviously, given IQ realities, there is going to be a point of diminishing returns here&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>This is simply not true.  If you have any data that supports your premise, please post it.  All of the evidence points to the exact opposite:</p>
<p><br>
The gap is not closing&hellip;the average score of black and Hispanic 17-year-olds fell in the white percentile distribution between 1975 and 1999 on NAEP tests of reading and science&hellip;..In the past 29 years, neither minority group has ever scored higher than the 30th percentile of the white distribution in reading, math or science. Between 1975 and 1990, blacks and Hispanics narrowed the gap with whites on the reading test, but it has widened since then. In math and science, the racial gap has scarcely changed at all since 1975&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Scores on the Scholastic Achievement Test (SAT) show the same pattern. In 1976, there was a 240-point gap between black and white combined scores, and the difference narrowed to 189 points in 1988. Since then, the gap has grown larger again, reaching 206 points in 2003&hellip;.&#8221;</p>

<p>I too am having none of it.  </p>

&#8220;&hellip;Studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&hellip; [r]ace differences in brain size are present at birth. By adulthood, East Asians average 1 cubic inch more cranial capacity than Whites who average 5 cubic inches more than Blacks&hellip;.&#8221;</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to read so many comments from teachers who either presently, or in the past, have taught large numbers of black students. I have yet to read such a post which does not point out that it is not difficult to observe lower average I.Q. levels between blacks and other racial groups.</p>
<p>This being said, it is also a mistake to not factor in positive cultural modelling: In the segregated schools of the old South, for example, the &#8220;talented tenth&#8221; of blacks (mostly light skinned mulattos, like Barack Obama)served as positive role models for all of the other blacks in a segregated school, and each town had a relatively strong middle class of black professionals who stayed in the community and served as further positve role models for the entire adult community.</p>
<p>There obviously is no way we&rsquo;ll ever return to such a world, but it did show that cultural and socio-economic factors are a key part of the development of intelligence, even though there has to obviously also be a decent native I.Q. level to work with.  </p>

<p>Probably so, since black people were often encouraged to &#8220;marry light.&#8221;  Light-skinned blacks wanted to marry other light-skinned blacks.  The black American culture is rife with &#8220;color-struck&#8221; maxims against darker skinned blacks.  They have worse names for their dark brethren than I have ever heard from a white person.</p>
<p>Although marriage has become less common, it&rsquo;s reasonable to assume the folk traditions have continued.  Look at Ebony magazine and see all the light-skinned female models.</p>

<p>It would not surprise me if US Black skulls are smaller than US White skulls, but that alone means nothing anyway. The point is only that they have gotten much larger, not that they are bigger than ours. Ugandans (IQ 73) have larger brains than Italians (IQ 102). Vietnamese have the some of the smallest brains on Earth and have one of the highest IQ&rsquo;s (99.5). So just forget comparing races and head sizes and IQ&rsquo;s. But a secular increase in head size concomitant with a rise in IQ is worth looking at.</p>
<p>The tests that now have Blacks at 89 adult and 92 child are the WAIS and the WISC. The Stanford Binet (adults and kids I guess) has Blacks at 91. It&rsquo;s most interesting that Murray and Rushton dislike these most classic IQ tests!</p>

<p>Poppycock.  Others don&rsquo;t agree and the real world knows better. <br>
Even the group I.Q. average of 85 is incorrect and the level of intelligence displayed by these people would indicate they&rsquo;re going down, not up.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t argue with success, my friend, and you can&rsquo;t argue with failure either.  Blacks have none of the former and an abundance of the latter.</p>
<p>Hispanics at 89 zip past blacks as if they&rsquo;re standing still, and their success figures literally swamp those of blacks.</p>
<p>Wherever blacks migrate to the level of competence plummets drastically and the level of chaos increases drastically.  It&rsquo;s all tied into intelligence.  Playing with figures will change nothing.  </p>

			<p>It is remarkable that Lindsay cites his own blog as independent proof of something. All the entry does is repeat what he says here, although apparently Murray (whom Lindsay claims to admire) and Rushton are &#8220;racists.&#8221; Oh dear.

<p>It is precisely Flynn&rsquo;s &#8220;use&#8221; of others&rsquo; data that is in question; what Flynn &#8220;comes up with&#8221; (the &#8220;Flynn Effect&#8221;) is hotly disputed by other scholars, including many you name as supporters of the FE. Boiled down, your entire case is based on Flynn. Flynn himself arrives at an IQ of not 85 but 83.6 for blacks aged 24, which is odd given Flynn&rsquo;s contention that &#8220;adolescent culture&#8221; is largely responsible for the <i>higher</i> scores he finds for black children.</p>

			<p>The Flynn Effect is not disputed at all anymore, except by real nutjobs. Everyone knows it&rsquo;s real; they&rsquo;re just arguing about what it means. The hardcore hereditarians say that it is not an increase in &#8220;real g&#8221; intelligence, whatever that means. They say that the IQ gains are &#8220;hollow gains&#8221;. I guess they&rsquo;re saying that the scores have gone up, but the people aren&rsquo;t really any smarter. </p>
<p>All the arguments about whether it&rsquo;s real or not are pretty much history, including arguments about whether it&rsquo;s a test-taking effect, statistical artifact, or simply does not exist, etc. I notice that they are hanging in here in the comments of Amren though, the home of many a dead and dying theory.</p>
<p>Even that 83.6 IQ you cite was a 5 point rise over 30 years. That&rsquo;s from a paper citing rises in Black child IQ anyway. Murray believes in the Flynn Effect, or at least he did when he wrote The Bell Curve. I think he&rsquo;s moved way right since then though.</p>

<p>&#8220;Philippe Rushton and Arthur Jensen concede that the magnitude of the black/white IQ gap is not immutable but could have narrowed by as much as 3.44 IQ points or 0.23 white SDs&hellip;</p>
<p>Using Shuey&rsquo;s 1966 data, Jensen (1998) estimates: 0.70 SDs in early childhood; 1.00 SDs in middle childhood; 1.20 SDs in early adulthood. Our current estimates: 0.31 SDs (age 4); 0.63 SDs (age 12); and 0.87 SDs (age 18). Comparison of their pre-rise values and our post-rise values yield a black IQ gain of 0.33 to 0.39 SDs. This equals 5.0 to 5.5 IQ points, close to the mid-point of our estimate that blacks gained 4 to 7 points. Therefore, unless they question our current values, our main contention is also conceded&hellip;Rushton and Jensen apply &#8220;simple arithmetic&#8221; to our Table A1 and derive a pre-rise value for black IQ of 86.44 and a post-rise value of 89.88&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;For circa 1999, they put black IQ at 89.88 for subjects whose median age is 15, higher than our 2002 projection for that age. If they believe in that value, the fact that black IQ was only at 86.44 some 20 years earlier is irrelevant. They know that Jensen&rsquo;s value for age 15 some 50 years ago was 1.1 SDs or 83.5. </p>
<p>(Jensen&rsquo;s own data shows 5.38 pt rise in 15 yr olds from 50 yrs ago).</p>

<p>&#8220;All the arguments about whether it&rsquo;s real or not are pretty much history, including arguments about whether it&rsquo;s a test-taking effect, statistical artifact, or simply does not exist, etc. I notice that they are hanging in here in the comments of Amren though, the home of many a dead and dying theory.&#8221;</p>
<p>is merely more proof that you are either dishonest or misunderstand the question. A very brief search provides plenty of dispositive data and interpretation, for example</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6W4M-4840V9G-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=c91ee68fa9320c17295ca7a28b7bff1c" rel="nofollow">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6W4M-4840V9G-1&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view;=c&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5;=c91ee68fa9320c17295ca7a28b7bff1c</a></p>
<p>&#8220;The secular gains were most pronounced on the low g-loaded subtests. In two compared age groups of children, the rank order correlations between the secular changes on the various subtests and the rank of those subtests on the g factor are negative and nonsignificant, the mean rs=−.40 (one-tailed P=.13). <i>As such, these results supported Rushton&rsquo;s [Pers. Individ. Differ. 26 (1999) 381] finding that the secular rise over time is not occurring on the g factor</i>. In Estonia, the Flynn effect is not a Jensen effect.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested to know why only your posts are &#8220;real&#8221; science and others&rsquo; are &#8220;nutjobs.&#8221; For that matter I&rsquo;d like to know how an avowed Marxist can speak of others&rsquo; &#8220;dead theories&#8221; with a straight face. Maybe there&rsquo;s something in your fabricated Census data about that. In any case your bleating about what &#8220;everyone&#8221; believes or knows is disproved by the existence of a single dissenter, and we have provided many more than one, here, Jensen and Murray.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even that 83.6 IQ you cite was a 5 point rise over 30 years. That&rsquo;s from a paper citing rises in Black child IQ anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even if you are right it is wholly irrelevant. You&rsquo;re convinced that black IQ has moved beyond the oft-cited 85. Your hero says that adult blacks have average IQs of 83.6 Your hero says you&rsquo;re wrong. See?</p>
<p>&#8220;Murray believes in the Flynn Effect, or at least he did when he wrote The Bell Curve.&#8221;</p>
<p>I doubt you&rsquo;re right about this, but a simple examination of verb tenses reveals that you maintain, contrary to fact, that Murray believes this NOW. And if Murray is worthy of respect (or is he a &#8220;racist&#8221; as you elsewhere claim? Which is it?), he is a perfectly adequate example of a prominent, more-than-capable scholar who does not believe in the FE.</p>
<p>&#8220;Philippe Rushton and Arthur Jensen concede that the magnitude of the black/white IQ gap is not immutable but could have narrowed by as much as 3.44 IQ points or 0.23 white SDs&#8221;</p>
<p>This, again, is not Rushton or Jensen speaking; this is an extrapolation by Flynn. It is simply dishonest to cite A as an example of what B believes. Flynn&rsquo;s mostly environmental hypothesis has been thoroughly tested over several decades on real-life blacks; it&rsquo;s hard to imagine a theory from the social sciences which has failed more spectacularly more often than this one (&#8220;IQ is mostly environmental&#8221;). The FE occurs too rapidly to be genetic. Therefore it must be environmental. Yet every attempt by Flynn&rsquo;s many leftist apostles has rigged a smarter black has failed. Nor do the alleged gains in intelligence square with the largely genetic basis of IQ (which basis is something scientists really do believe).<br>

<p>&#8220;In the two generations of the NLSY, <i>no convergence has occurred</i>. The BW [black-white] difference on a highly g-loaded cognitive test for the 1st generation of the NLSY, born from 1957–64, was 16.6 points, amounting to 1.24 SDs relative to the black and white distributions. For the 2nd generation, born primarily in the 1980s, the difference on a widely used test of verbal cognitive ability was 17.8 points, or 1.26 SDs. The estimated magnitude of the BW difference in the 2nd generation is robust, surviving a variety of hypotheses about possible sources of attenuation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Coming from an avowed Marxist, this does provide a sort of low comedy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wow, you guys are more hardcore hereditarian than Arthur Jensen. That deserves a medal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Virtually the entire psychological profession is more hereditarian than Flynn, unless he&rsquo;s changed his tune in the last year or so. The increasing consensus governing discussion of heredity in intelligence is one of the main problems with Flynn, as his model is very largely environmental.</p>

&#8220;&hellip;From: Common ground and differences. William T. Dickens and James R. Flynn. Forthcoming: Psychological Science&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Robert:</p>
<p>Here is Jensen&rsquo;s and Ruston&rsquo;s rebuttal to the Dickens and Flynn paper you cite:</p>
<p><a href="/psychology/faculty/rushtonpdfs/2006_20PSnew.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ssc.uwo.ca/psychology/faculty/rushtonpdfs/2006%20PSnew.pdf</a></p>
<p>From the rebuttal:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Dickens and Flynn challenge our hypothesis.</p>
<p>They claim that &lsquo;no one can really trace the Black-White<br>
IQ gap&rsquo;&hellip; Dickens and Flynn had to sidestep our citation of<br>
Shuey&rsquo;s (1966) review of the literature, which shows that Black-<br>
White IQ differences in the United States have remained at 15 to<br>
18 points, or 1.1 standard deviations, for nearly a century&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Even the tests Dickens and Flynn did analyze do not support<br>
their conclusion. The alleged gain of 4 to 7 points is from a<br>
&lsquo;projected&rsquo; trend line based on a small IQ rise per year multiplied by more years than are in the data&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>You write:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.The hardcore hereditarians say that it is not an increase in &#8216;real g&rsquo; intelligence, whatever that means&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Possibly because Flynn and Dickens chose to &#8216;cherry pick&rsquo; the IQ tests they used and omit at least one of the tests that is highly correlated with measuring g-load.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;To claim a 4- to 7-point gain for Blacks, Dickens and Flynn<br>
chose three independent tests showing medium gains (the<br>
Wechsler, Stanford-Binet, and Armed Forces Qualification tests)<br>
and relegated to their Appendix B four or more tests showing<br>
lesser gains. </p>
<p>They excluded the Wonderlic Personnel Test, which they acknowledge showed a gain of only 2.4 points for blacks between 1970 and 2001.</p>
<p>They excluded the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children<br>
(K-ABC), which Murray (2005) described as showing a loss of 1<br>
IQ point for Blacks between 1983 and 2004. </p>
<p>They excluded the very g-loaded Woodcock-Johnson test, which<br>
Murray (2005; whom they cite) described as showing the conventional gap of 1.05 standard deviations for the third (2001)<br>
standardization sample. </p>
<p>They also excluded the Differential Ability Scale, which in Lynn&rsquo;s (1996) analysis showed a maximum gain of 1.83 IQ points for blacks between 1972 and 1986&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the quote from Gottfriedson:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;To be compelling&hellip;.researchers must take the totality of available evidence into account&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Steve Sailer writes this about the AFQT (which Flynn and Dickens used in their samples):</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Similarly, IQ tests change over the years in ways that are hard to summarize. </p>
<p>For example&hellip;the military&rsquo;s Armed Forces Qualification Test in 1980, the white-black gap was an oddly large 18.6 points.</p>
<p>Subsequent analysis showed that the unusually low scores achieved by black males on the AFQT in 1980 were caused by more blacks being likely to give up and not finish&hellip;they realized they weren&rsquo;t going to score well enough to be allowed to enlist. </p>
<p>In 1997, the AFQT was re-standardized. But now it is given on a computer that adjusts to how well the test-taker is doing. If you miss a lot of early questions, the program will then give you easier questions. This makes taking the test less discouraging for low IQ individuals. </p>
<p>On the new computerized AFQT in 1997, the white-black gap narrowed&hellip;to 14.7 points&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sailer notes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;I suspect methodological alterations have, on the whole, been biased in favor of higher minority scores. Test publishers have been under relentless pressure to eliminate any questions that might appear biased against blacks&hellip;.&#8221; </p>
<p>Sailer also relates:</p>
<p>&#8220;According to Flynn, massive IQ increases are not seen in all types of cognitive functioning, just in a couple of areas, </p>
<p>We see only small changes in the first three mental skills: general knowledge, arithmetic, and vocabulary.</p>
<p>However, there have been substantial improvements in the next six subtests, most of which involve visual logic. </p>
<p>The Flynn Effect shows up less in the general factor of intelligence, the g factor, which accounts for roughly half of individual differences in intelligence&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The bottom line is this:  black double digit IQs are intractable and no amount of money or effort has been shown to change that fact. </p>
<p>BTW:  Can you give a few examples of what you call the many &#8216;dead and dying theories&rsquo; that we defend on these boards.</p>

			<p>The truth is that the tests that they omitted were all ones that Jensen and Rushton themselves said were no good anyway. They figures don&rsquo;t come out right on great tests like the WISC (!), the WAIS (!) and the Stanford-Binet (!), for Chrissake, so they have to muck around and find these hokey tests like Wonderlic and whatnot. It&rsquo;s interesting that at the very least Blacks are doing much better on quite a few of these tests. They&rsquo;re doing the same on some others, but those aren&rsquo;t even the most-used IQ tests. I think before it was just the same huge gap on all the tests. </p>
<p>Flynn and Dickens use Jensen&rsquo;s and Jensen and Rushton&rsquo;s *own data* in the rebuttal to that rebuttal to show a 3.4 point closing of the gap on one set, or a 5.5 point closing on another. Obviously, this whole argument is exceedingly complex and the experts are still going back and forth about it. You&rsquo;re either lining up with one group or another, but there&rsquo;s not yet any consensus one way or another.</p>
<p>2.4 point closing is still a closing of the gap.</p>
<p>Those tests, Johnson-Woodcock, Wonderlic, Differential Ability, K-ABC, are not really even used that much. The overwhelming majority of IQ tests given are Stanford-Binet and especially WISC and WAIS and of course the Armed Forces IQ test. I don&rsquo;t know why they threw these obscure tests in there, other than to screw things up.</p>
<p>Using Shuey&rsquo;s data, Flynn and Dickens showed a 3.4 point gain.</p>
<p>Sailer is not correct. The big fuss was over cultural bias. So test makers were under pressure to get rid of culturally biased stuff. They have done this, and there are now tests like Raven&rsquo;s that don&rsquo;t even use any language. Raven&rsquo;s has the highest Flynn Effect of any test (36 points!) and it the most heavily g-loaded test in existence. Jensen says there is no way to raise Raven&rsquo;s scores by environmental intervention, only in the womb or the first 6 months of life.</p>
<p>Sailer is also wrong about tests being faked to make them easier for Blacks. I don&rsquo;t see how making it so people don&rsquo;t get discouraged and quit the test altogether (therefore invalidating any score) is wrong.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see only small changes in the first three mental skills: general knowledge, arithmetic, and vocabulary.</p>
<p>However, there have been substantial improvements in the next six subtests, most of which involve visual logic.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is correct, but also there have been gains in verbal abstract thinking, abstract thinking in general, raw brain speed (digit span) and various other things. Most of the gains are in abstract thinking. Amazing that hereditarians think that abstract thinking gains are &#8220;hollow gains&#8221; and &#8220;not real intelligence&#8221;. WTH? Since when is abstract reasoning not intelligence.</p>
<p>It is true that scores have gone up little to none in general knowledge, vocabulary, reading comprehension, math and mathematical analysis. School stuff. Which makes sense in view of reports of flat school scores.</p>
<p>The g argument is mostly just silly. First of all, Raven&rsquo;s, a test which was designed to be the ultimate g-loaded test ever made, scores the highest Flynn Effect of all! Huh? When we look at crystallized g, there is nothing there. That&rsquo;s school stuff. When we look at fluid g, there&rsquo;s a good correlation (how well and fast your brain works) with the Flynn Effect.</p>

<p>Just a few hours ago everyone, according to you, &#8220;lined up&#8221; with Flynn except &#8220;nutcases.&#8221; How things change when you&rsquo;re confronted with actual data.</p>
<p>You continue to ignore the hereditarian consensus. Flynn, as an &#8220;environmentalist,&#8221; is on the fringe here.<br>

			<p>You just don&rsquo;t get it, do you, Cassio?</p>
<p>Almost everyone know agrees that the Flynn Effect is real, not fake. The argument is over what it means. </p>
<p>The debate about whether or not Blacks have closed the B-W gap by 3 or 5 points or whatever is *separate* from the debate over the Flynn Effect. I guess you didn&rsquo;t figure that out. It&rsquo;s a separate issue altogether, and there is no real consensus on it. Just two sides arguing back and forth, as we see above. </p>
<p>Flynn is not an extreme environmentalist at all. As I know the man, I wish you would stop trying to characterize someone you don&rsquo;t even know. In the field, most just won&rsquo;t answer the question. It&rsquo;s not true to say that most psychologists are some kind of hardline hereditarians.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Almost everyone know agrees that the Flynn Effect is real, not fake. The argument is over what it means.&#8221;</p>
<p>If it means essentially nothing with regard to intelligence but something else it is not &#8220;real.&#8221; You have maintained that &#8220;everyone&#8221; agrees that it measures actual gains in intelligence, or g, and not something else. You then change horses when we provide scholars who dispute that view. This is simply dishonest, as is your invocation of Murray (who disbelieves what you claim he believes) and Rushton (who appears <br>
in your posts only as interpreted by Flynn). </p>
<p>&#8220;The debate about whether or not Blacks have closed the B-W gap by 3 or 5 points or whatever is *separate* from the debate over the Flynn Effect. I guess you didn&rsquo;t figure that out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lindsay, I&rsquo;m quite capable of &#8220;figuring out&#8221; anything you are capable of articulating, even if it&rsquo;s comprised of bogus Census data and sheer sophistry. The closing gap is separate from the FE debate but is not unrelated to it. Both depend upon the interpretation of IQ data, and, according to you, Murray acknowledged gap closure. I pointed out that you are simply wrong. I guess you didn&rsquo;t figure that out. Nor do you seem to understand that many scholars do not believe in, at the very least, Flynn&rsquo;s interpetation of his own data. If what we&rsquo;ve documented already is insufficient you are simply beyond the reach of reason.</p>
<p>&#8220;Flynn is not an extreme environmentalist at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>He should sue, among others, American Renaissance:</p>
<p><a href="/news/2006/12/charles_murray.html" rel="nofollow">/news/2006/12/charles_murray.php</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Flynn, who is political scientist at the University of Otago in New Zealand, took the view that there are no underlying genetic differences in intelligence between backs and whites, and that the achievement gap will disappear when social conditions improve. He based his case largely on a study of children born to German women and American GI&rsquo;s shortly after the Second World War. A handful of these children were mulattos, and their IQs were about equal to those of the white children. Mr. Flynn admitted that this study is hardly definitive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As I know the man, I wish you would stop trying to characterize someone you don&rsquo;t even know.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want anyone to characterize Flynn&rsquo;s views, you should urge him to stop publishing and speaking in public. I have no particular position on Flynn himself. Perhaps he&rsquo;s a very nice guy. </p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not true to say that most psychologists are some kind of hardline hereditarians.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have no idea what &#8220;hardline&#8221; means. It is certainly true that the psychological profession acknowledges, to varying degrees, that heredity is an important factor in intelligence. This is the conclusion, for instance, among scholars who have studied twins:</p>
<p><a href="/ar/1992/11.html" rel="nofollow">/ar/1992/11/</a></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also an interesting survey (reviewed in AR) by Rothman and Snyderman:</p>
<p><a href="/ar/1990/12.html" rel="nofollow">/ar/1990/12/</a></p>
<p>&#8220;The majority of the experts polled by Mr. Snyderman and Mr. Rothman therefore conclude that genetic differences account for at least part of the black/white IQ difference. Only 15% said they thought that the differences were due to environment alone. Since the race/IQ question is the most politically explosive one in all the social sciences, it is highly significant that only a small minority took the safe, liberal position.&#8221;</p>
<p>Only a fool would conclude that the environmental position has gotten stronger rather than weaker since 1990. Surveys like this continue to show that, media presentation notwithstanding, scholars who work in intelligence (though not necessarily related to race) believe by large margins that IQ is partly or largely genetic (the hereditary component continues to grow in these estimates, so far as I can tell) and that very few believe that intelligence is wholly hereditary. Where is the credentialed scholar who believes that heredity plays no role in intelligence?</p>
