						<p>When Beijing and Toronto bid in 2001 for the chance to host the 2008 Olympics, many Torontonians of Chinese descent felt torn between the homeland and their new adopted country.</p>
<p>But since then, and with the opening ceremony of the Beijing 2008 Olympic games just hours away, many Chinese-Canadians know exactly who to cheer for.</p>
<p>Andrea Chun, a lawyer and host of a phone-in show on local Chinese television, said she will be supporting her native home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When it comes to the games most Chinese-Canadians are rooting for China, to be honest; they won&rsquo;t admit it if you ask them, but for sure they are,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Originally from Hong Kong Martin Lau, who works in the financial services sector, did not hesitate to announce his excitement, even though he has been in Canada for 20 years. &ldquo;I definitely support the Olympics in China and the Chinese people,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>But there are divided loyalties in a community that makes up the largest non-European ethnic group in Canada, standing at 1,346,510 or 4.3 per cent of the population, according to a 2006 census.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a place like Canada, you can root for whoever you associate with,&rdquo; says Karen Sun, the executive director of Chinese Canadian National (CCNC).</p>
<p>&ldquo;People here have so many teams to choose from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But for some Chinese, who have spent all their lives in Canada, the homeland offers an exciting, yet unfamiliar magnetism.</p>
<p>Evelyn Siu, 25, was born and raised in Toronto and will cheer on the Canadian Olympic team.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was proud on behalf of my heritage. I was a little disappointed that Toronto didn&rsquo;t get it, but I think Beijing was an interesting choice too. I&rsquo;m going with the Canadians definitely, since I&rsquo;m not too familiar with Chinese Olympians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming-out party&rdquo;</p>
<p>But many Chinese are finding their country increasingly under the spotlight, and not necessarily because of its preparations to host the games or the abilities of their athletes.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, international media has focused on alleged human rights abuses, treatment of minorities and the predominantly Muslim Uighurs, media and internet censorship, economic prosperity, and pollution in China.</p>
<p>Chinese-Canadians, however, believe the games should be viewed as a chance to showcase the country&rsquo;s position and its ability to change and be embraced by the rest of the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really a coming out party,&rdquo; Chun said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People are very proud and very nationalistic. Even the Tibet riots were overshadowed by this pride. For the Chinese, at this point they are willing to overlook anything, including rule of law, human rights, and social problems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Positive effect</p>
<p>However, Chun believes the Olympic games are also forcing the Chinese to reflect about the rest of the world and what role they can play on an international scale.</p>
<p>In an incident reported in Canadian media, four journalists were roughed up for filming an altercation in Beijing. The following day, Chinese authorities said the journalists should not have been harassed or interfered with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because the mentality is that you can&rsquo;t film negative news,&rdquo; Chun said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The authorities&rsquo; reaction is already a step [forward], though I am not optimistic about things changing very quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Victor Wong of the CCNC believes that change will happen in China, but incrementally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is always something negative if you look for it &mdash; air pollution, lack of freedom of access to the internet, human rights concerns, congestion &mdash; it depends whether you want to take a longer term view,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The question is; will the event contribute to the development of China in the long run?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tibet</p>
<p>Dermod Travis, the executive director of the Canada-Tibet Committee (CTC), remains very sceptical that China is changing.</p>
<p>He believes that recent reports of censorship and repression of dissent emerging from China have demonstrated that the International Olympic Committee (IOC) made an error in judgment when it awarded Beijing the games.</p>
<p>The Committee had hoped giving Beijing the chance to host the games would improve its human rights record.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we have seen is the exact opposite,&rdquo; Travis said. </p>
<p>&ldquo;For example, China blocked websites for journalists when the media was promised full access and it placed Chinese dissidents under house arrest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The CTC is on record saying that Beijing has the right to host the games, and that their differences remain with the policies of the government, rather than the Chinese people. </p>
<p>Travis, however, believes that the games have exposed China&rsquo;s repressive policies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We recognise that the games are allowing the world to see China for what it truly is &mdash; a country that cannot keep its word and is prepared to continue to use whatever means are required to suppress its own citizens,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Chun also believes that China should recognise and address its human rights record.</p>
<p>She believes the dissent in Tibet could have been better handled by the authorities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tibet is only a fraction of the problem. China has to let the world see it for what it is &hellip; if China thinks the [protestors in Tibet] were rioters, they should just let the media in, to see for themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, away from the political arguments, Rich Chan, a 22-year-old personal trainer who has been in Canada his whole life, says the Olympics are a chance to highlight diversity and acceptance of all spectrums and ethnicities in China.</p>
<p>But he says he knows who he will be supporting at the games.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going with China. China all the way.&rdquo;<br>

			<p>The Canadiennes are the most naive people in the world believing the &#8220;diversity&#8221; machine will bring them prosperity and happines instead of subjugation under a Chinese autocracy similar to what has been the mainland Chinese form of government for the last three thousand years. Talk to the Phillipinos who suffer under Chinese economic enslavement in their own island nation and you will find the Chinese to be universally hated for their distain for anything other than Chinese culture and peoples. Talk to the Tibetans.</p>

			<p>Hard to blame the Chinese-Canadians.  In Canada, they look around and rightfully see a sinking ship, a once-Western nation that is now ashamed of its very Western identity and hurtling toward its own self-destruction through mass non-White immigration, political correctness and affirmative action.  In China, they see an ancient, accomplished, respected nation, racially homogeneous, high-quality, valuing education, hard-working, generally polite but able to stand up for itself  &mdash;   which will soon become the world&rsquo;s top industrial, scientific and technological power.  The Chinese have been going strong for well over 2,000 years, in part because of their ethnic solidarity, while the USA and Britain collapse after a mere 2 centuries of anything resembling international power.  The Chinese know how to stay strong in the long haul, and today is no exception.</p>

			<p>I have no problem with the Chinese rooting for their own.  Isn&rsquo;t that the purpose of this website, for us to root for (and complain about) our own.  If whites were as ethnocentric as the Chinese, we wouldn&rsquo;t be in such a situation.<br>

			<p>No surprise. Australians living in Hong Kong for 3 decades still root for Australia. Russian immigrants to Sydney root for Russia. And South African immigrants to New Zealand still root for South Africa over New Zealand in rugby. When Italy won the soccer World Cup in 2006, Australian born Italians came out in droves and wildly celebrated. And many Australian Croats would support Croatia over Australia in a football match. So whats the big deal about Chinese having fond feelings for the mother country? After all American Irish still do.</p>

			<p>Tim, you speak of the subjugation of the Philippines by Chinese economic dominance, but the reality is Philipino culture [part Malay, part Hispanic] is much like Mexico&rsquo;s: profoundly corrupt and disfunctional. James Fallows, a renowned journalist and asia scholar stated that &#8216;nowhere in asia [east asia] have I seen people treat each other so badly&rsquo;&hellip;.of course, on the upside, they will have sex with you for pocket change.</p>

<p>So?  I mean, just look at the US.  Can anybody truthfully say that every non-white racial group in this entire country doesn&rsquo;t put their race first and their country of origin second, with their present national residence serving only as a place to earn money and enjoy a more advanced society?</p>
<p>And the government has been viciously criticized for putting Japanese in internment camps in WWII?  Sounds like the smart thing to do to me.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another question.  Does anybody really believe that non-whites will fight for this country if it ever went to war against their land of origin?</p>
<p>If your answer is yes, I have a short jacket with long sleeves I&rsquo;d like to give you as a present, because you need it.</p>

			<p>&#8220;So whats the big deal about Chinese having fond feelings for the mother country? After all American Irish still do.<br>
Posted by John Liu at 10:20 PM on August 8</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re right on, old boy, except that I know literally thousands of people here of Irish descent and not one of them cares one whit about what happens in Ireland, other than what concerns them as whites.  I&rsquo;m pretty sure white Canadians feel the same way about whatever white ethnicity they might be.</p>
<p>However &#8220;the big deal&#8221; in all of what you say is that white immigration into this country eventually evolves into a  transition almost wholly of mind, body, and soul, which creates a new ethnic identity of sorts:  White Americans.  That is not true with those who are not of the same race.  If they are rooting for their nation/race, they will always do so until the end of time.  </p>
<p>By the same token, Europeans in Hong Kong, Maylasia, or any non-white country, will never truly be a part of those societies no matter how many generations pass.  A white lineage in China or Japan will always be European and never Chinese or Japanese.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a universal, indisputable fact that people of different races will never wholly accept another race as part of their racial family, and that&rsquo;s one of many reasons why multiculturalism isn&rsquo;t only a failure it&rsquo;s really a crime against nature.  Mixed race people will always be regarded as souless, uncommitted entities, belonging to no group really, unless they look so much like one group or another they can &#8220;pass.&#8221;  But one trace of &#8220;mixed&#8221; identity is enough to regard them as outsiders among the majority of whatever nation state they might reside, even if the impression is only subconscious or subliminal.   </p>
<p>Multiracialism/multicuturalism is an ideology that comes from the perverted minds of people who are sick and in constant turmoil with fantasies that can never be and should never be.  Natural law has certain dictates and anyone trying to change or subvert those mandates is really no more than a mad scientist, attempting to create a new multiracial Frankenstein monster.  It is Nature, not man who is the creator and the evolver, and any attempts to alter the laws of nature have always failed in the long run. </p>
<p>Countries in the West who have large segments of their populations that are comprised of various tribes of people will not evolve into a single ethnic identity.  The result will be a fractious nation of people who hold loyalties only to their racial tribesmen forever.  Only those who can &#8220;pass&#8221; will be accepted as one of a nation&rsquo;s tribesmen.</p>
<p>This effort at breeding a being who is an &#8220;everyman&#8221; is a sick attempt to change things to the liking of lunatics who have no place on earth and should be purged from the ranks of humanity like any deadly virus.   Nature will take its course, and no amount of man-made effort will change that for very long.</p>

			<p>always when I see nonwhites in this country regarless of their immigration status-legal or not- regardless of whether they were born here or even if they contributed anything of value at all to this country, always I ask myself if we go to war with YOUR people who&rsquo;s side will you REALLY be on?</p>

			<p>Some of you are applying a double-standard. As one fellow said, the Italians rooted for their own in the world cup and I&rsquo;ve seen in many sporting events that to occur. I&rsquo;m a 3rd generation American of German descent and yet find myself rooting for Germans in many things and desirous of German manufacturing and culture. Its natural. </p>
<p>That said, from what I&rsquo;ve heard Tibet wasn&rsquo;t exactly a *free* place and distrust anything the MSM has to say. I wish we could be more like China in that when they captured a citizen who murdered a Canadian white girl for her laptop who was on a 3 month modeling contract, they told the MSM he&rsquo;ll get DEATH after conviction (they have CCTV footage). Not Club Fed and a slap on a wrist. </p>
<p>I honestly don&rsquo;t think a resurgent China is a bad thing. They have always been cautious and reserved. You have to do something pretty bad to piss them off, unlike our present regimes who seem to want to turn everything into a constant hornet&rsquo;s nest of war and intrigue.  </p>

			<p>America and Canada were founded by White European Intellectuals.<br>
The values are European. When Chinese come here they do it for one reason..MONEY. Money for themselves and their families and for China. They do not care one iota about the values of America. Their emotional patterns and their thinking arent better or worse..they are DIFFERENT. They do not understand us, and we dont understand them. Lets leave it at that and keep out country to ourselves.</p>

			<p>This isn&rsquo;t that big of a deal.  Just like when Polish people in the USA root for Andrew Golota during boxing or when English Americans root for Michael Bisping in UFC, the Chinese will root for their ethnic own.  This isn&rsquo;t a sign of disloyalty or anything, just racial pride.  </p>

			<p>The handwriting is on the wall for white Canadians. Unless they wake up, Now, they are doomed. Canada&rsquo;s population of people with European roots, are not that many,less than the population of California. They will be overrun by Chinese, or whatever foreign nationals they continue to massively allow into their nation. These people will not care who founded modern Canada  &mdash;  in the slightest. </p>

			<p>&#8220;I have a friend who lives in canada and she says the chinese ppl are rude&hellip;.and a pain in the butt&hellip;they think they rule the world and are defiant and a problem&hellip;.they don&rsquo;t have any manners at all&hellip;they think the whites are beneath them&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I live in Canada and my interactions with the Chinese have been overwhelmingly positive, sorry your friend&rsquo;s experience has been otherwise. In any case, though, the real concern is whether the Chinese in Canada will eventually become a ruling class acting in Chinese interests, like Roman governors/administrators throughout the Empire. And that will have a lot to do with China&rsquo;s status and power in the world over the next century&rsquo;s, especially as compared with the USA&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s hard to predict. The saddest thing is that all the levers of power in Canada are in the hands of people who refuse even to consider such questions.</p>

			<p>&#8220;No to mention a communist nation that has built most of that with crypto-slavery.&#8221;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t believe the above statement.  Despite their brief experiment with Communism, the Chinese are natural-born <br>
Capitalists and today&rsquo;s China is one of the most Capitalistic nations on Earth.  Nearly everyone has their day job, and also their home business, on the side.  Everyone makes fun of Communism, and most people like Americans.</p>
<p>As for their success being built on &#8220;crypto-slavery,&#8221; there has been brutal use of political and criminal prisoners in for-profit labor camps, but that is an extremely small percentage of the population.  By-and-large, people in China are free and happy.  This is primarily because of the amazing economic turnaround during the last 35 year, which was accomplished by (1) Holding population in check. (2) Not allowing immigration (3) Fostering Capitalism (4) Brutal punishment for crime and corruption.  In fact, at no time in World History, has there been such a rapid rise in standard of living for so many people in such a short time.  The 1.3 Billion Chinese citizens have gone from abject poverty to middle class in only 35 years.  Totally amazing!  Some Chinese live better lives than middle-class Americans.  I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time in China   &mdash;   I know. </p>

			<p>I have nothing against the Chinese having racial pride. What whites need to do is have the same. No matter how nice the Chinese may be, Canada was founded and built as a white western nation and letting tons of Chinese in will change that. Chinese belong in China and Canada or any other white dominated country needs to be like the Chinese in that they maintain their race, lanugage and culture in the own country.</p>

			<p>The Chinese are the fastest growing ethnic group in Canada who now comprise about 4.3% of our total population of 33 million. (California&rsquo;s population is now 38 million people)</p>
<p>Last year in the province of British Columbia, the <i>National Alliance Party</i> was launched to bring a &#8220;Chinese focus&#8221; to provincial politics. In other words, <a href="http://elliotlakenews.wordpress.com/2007/06/24/new-chinese-political-party-in-canada/" rel="nofollow"><br>
this newly formed Chinese political party based in Canada</a>, intends on focusing their attention strictly on people with a Chinese heritage. Of course we&rsquo;re very aware that if White Canadians were to launch a political party with the same goals in mind of catering to their racial group, all hell would break loose.</p>
<p>With Chinese &#8220;Canadians&#8221; having pride in their roots and thus cheer leading their own ethnics in the Beijing 2008 Olympic games, this newly formed Chinese-focused political party would attract similar sentiments.  </p>
<p>French-Canadians are the only whites defending their culture in the province of Quebec while &#8220;English Canada&#8221; quiver in their boots for fear of being labeled a &#8220;racist&#8221; or charged under some draconian &#8220;hate law&#8221; for any supporting expression of white pride.</p>
<p>We must learn to un-brainwash ourselves and follow the examples of other races who take pride in their respective racial heritages or we&rsquo;ll lose all our power in this game of tribal politics and eventually become 2nd rate fiddlers in our own country.</p>

			<p>&gt; Some of you are applying a double-standard. As one fellow said, the Italians rooted for their own in the world cup and I&rsquo;ve seen in many sporting events that to occur. I&rsquo;m a 3rd generation American of German descent and yet find myself rooting for Germans in many things and desirous of German manufacturing and culture. Its natural.</p>
<p>&gt; Posted by Sulla at 2:00 PM on August 9</p>
<p>There is no double standard. There is no good and evil. There is no right or wrong. There is only what benefits our people and what doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Chinese in Canada are loyal to China. This is bad. To make this a good thing, you&rsquo;ve gone into a China expat&rsquo;s head and gauged his thoughts. What a Chinaman thinks has no bearing on what&rsquo;s universally good or bad in relation to Whites.</p>
<p>There is no hypocrisy. There is no double-standard. There is only what benefits us or hinders us. The sooner Whites stop searching for a universal good or evil, the sooner Whites thrive.</p>
<p>I am by no means a Judeophile, but Jews have a track record of surviving. Their secret? They ask themselves &#8220;what&rsquo;s good for the Jews&#8221;. That&rsquo;s the window they see the world through. If we are to survive, we need to be intolerant of what&rsquo;s bad for us. To do so, we need to unambiguously and instantly see what is in our good.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this good for the Whites?&#8221;</p>

			<p>  Nothing indicates the difference between the political philosophies of China and the United States better than the opening Olympic parade. China&rsquo;s most popular athlete, Yao Ming, carried the flag for China along with a poor orphan boy from the earthquake region. The United States had a black refugee from Darfur carry the flag for America. Basically, we have ethno-nationalism vs. international multiculturalism, which do you think will be stronger in the long run? What would the Chinese in Canada say?</p>

			<p>Chinese supporting China is not a sign of <i>racial</i> pride. It is a sign of <i>ethnic</i> or <i>national</i> pride. Chinese will not support a Japanese or Korean athlete over a white or black athlete. And Koreans and Japanese are completely unconcerned about China&rsquo;s progress or how well she does in the medals table. In this respect Chinese pride in China is no different and just as innocuous as people expressing pride in their Celtic heritage, their German roots, their Italian roots.</p>
<p>People on this message board seem to believe that whites are denied any sort of pride in their identity. They are not. They can be proud of being French, German, Italian, Croatian, Irish, and clubs for such groups abound in the US. Explicit pride in <i>race</i> however is generally frowned upon for good reason. And Chinese also don&rsquo;t go round talking about the superiority of the yellow race. They celebrated their Chineseness, not their membership of some pan-Asian yellow grouping.</p>
<p>I have met Italians in Australia that have been their since the 1950s. Even their Australian born children are passionate in their support of the Italian football team, and when Italy clashed with Australia in 2006 World Cup had somewhat mixed feelings, but most were happy that Italy went through.</p>
<p>Expressing love for your ancestral home has nothing to do with ethnic chauvinism, even less racism. It is no different from cheering on your hometown football team.</p>

			<p>The racial tension between the Chinese and white Canadians increases as the economic imparity between them becomes obvious.  These all come from &ldquo;globalization&rdquo; which occurs, not because the Illuminati-controlled Western governments, like Canada and America, want to spread the ideas of free trade and democracy around the world, but because Western &ldquo;radical capitalists&rdquo; globalize their exploitations of cheap labor to cut their cost to do business&hellip;. for maximum money, power and control.  China which once was a very poor communist country became an easy target.  However, the Chinese are smart and resourceful with 5000 years of civilization under their belt.   Having learned a lesson from the Western capitalists, they took advantage of the opportunity and turned their adversity into an opportunity of getting rich.    &ldquo;To get rich is a glory.&rdquo;   So the Chinese anywhere enjoy the last laugh now.  It is politically incorrect to deny anyone&rsquo;s financial success.</p>
<p>Getting back to the issue of racial tension, a little dirty secret : Racial tension between any races is desirable for Illuminati (mostly  international bankers behind the central bank in major Western countries) behind your government to control the people including you, so that you are constantly disturbed and distracted from the real danger of the New World Order, to the definite end of which Canada&rsquo;s and America&rsquo;s lousy economies, corrupt governments and collapsing banking systems will bring you .  (You bet Obama has 100% chance to be the next American President.)  The Chinese-Canadians with a connection to their people in China will certainly be better off, for China is one of the last countries still free of Illuminati&rsquo;s evil influence.  The Chinese have every good reason to root for China.<br>

			<p>This is hardly a new phenomenon. Ancestry almost always trumps residency. Harry Truman hit the nail on the head when he equated all &#8220;hypenated Americans&#8221; with &#8220;Communist-Americans&#8221; on the grounds that &#8220;they all have some other loyalty than the one they should have.&#8221;</p>
<p>For that matter, how many of us racially-aware whites cheered <i>against</i> the all-black US men&rsquo;s basketball team in 2004? Check the AR archives   &mdash;   so many did so that it became a national story. And how many of us (along with myself) are doing the same thing this time around?</p>

			<p>Let&rsquo;s hope that all this newfound admiration and pride in their homeland will lead many Chinese back there, someday. It could very well happen after Canada becomes a complete multicult madhouse&hellip;They&rsquo;ll split like rats leaving a sinking ship.</p>

			<p>First, to Tim:</p>
<p>I can assure you that I am not one of those Canadians of European descent who is, in any way, naive nor did I fall for the years of Liberal government and media propaganda that insisted cultural diversity would be our salvation.</p>
<p>When it comes to patriotism, I cannot oppose one&rsquo;s right to cheer for whom they wish, although I may not always agree with the reasons.</p>
<p>Here in Canada, all you have to do is look at the World Cup Soccer tournament.  Although the country has more kids playing soccer than are playing hockey (believe it or not!); Canada remains a doormat on the international scale.  There in the qualifying process for 2010 right now.</p>
<p>That is why I have always cheered for England during the World Cup.  It is my ancestral homeland, and the team is usually very competitive.  In the most recent World Cup, in 2006, I discovered I had a second team to root for: Australia.</p>
<p>In this country, it is human nature for people of German, Italian, or Dutch backgrounds - just as examples - to cheer for their respective homeland countries.</p>
<p>Where I do draw the line, however, is what happened in the recent world women&rsquo;s curling championships.  A young team from China took the field by storm, and surprise.</p>
<p>They finished first during the round robin, and their success included a win over the host country Canada, which culminated a contraversial broom-tossing-in-the-air celebration that turned off many a curling purist.</p>
<p>Consider this:  This team from China lives in Canada (and plays in curling bonspiels) for eight months of the year!  The team curls here for a living and is sponsored so by the Chinese government.</p>
<p>They made history this year by becoming the first ever Asian team to win a medal.  Fortunately, Canada&rsquo;s Jennifer Jones restored order in the championship final, defeating the Chinese and keeping the curling title where it belonged&hellip;in Canada and in the hands of White people.</p>
<p>Returning to the 2006 World Cup; I recall seeing, on one White nationalist website, an article of praise commending Italy on its championship victory over France.  Why would such an article be written?  As it mentioned, the team from France was mostly a team of Black Somalians.<br>

			<p>FischerFan, you don&rsquo;t give the Chinese team enough credit for their win. Curling in China is pretty much unheard of as are many other winter games. In Canada it is among the national sports, so I guess I can see the insecurity. But you seem overly shocked - even flabbergasted that an Asian team defeated White Canadians; to the point where you implied it to be a state of DISORDER. Wake up man. The stereotypical lie of Asians being weak etc. has been propagated so much that we now grossly underestimate all of their abilities to our own detriment.</p>
<p>China has proven great strength, ambition and aspirations of excellence. Canadians could learn from them and, in general, would be better served if they got off their high horses and drop the complacent attitudes.</p>

			<p>The difference between racial pride and ethnic pride is a matter of degree, or perhaps specificity.  There is not a difference in kind.  Despising everyone who is not Vietnamese is not somehow more noble than despising everyone who is not Oriental.  The antagonism between Japanese and Koreans is not somehow lessened just because most Whites can&rsquo;t tell the difference between them on sight.  John Liu seems to imagine that Chinese pride is somehow innocuous, whereas White pride is a bad thing, &#8220;something to be frowned upon&#8221;.  Well, given that most White Americans are of mixed European ancestry, European, or White, pride is the only thing that makes sense.  Am I to go to the local Scottish festival, when I am only 1/16 Scot, because my name happens to be, say, Gordon?  Shall I be excluded from the Slavic dance club because my Celtic name doesn&rsquo;t match my largely Polish ancestry?  The Europeans, the English, the Italians, the Russians, should all have pride in their own people, and not be ashamed or, as it is now, persecuted, for having a healthy ethnocentrism.  And neither should White Americans be ashamed of our racism.  I am happy to let the Chinese be racist, or ethnocentric, or whatever it is they choose to call it.  I suspect, however, that to a Chinese, &#8220;racism&#8221; is when we don&rsquo;t care for them, and &#8220;ethnocentrism&#8221; is when they don&rsquo;t care for us.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;Chinese supporting China is not a sign of racial pride. It is a sign of ethnic or national pride.&#8221;<br>
    Yes, and ethnic or national pride by emigres for their country of origin and people is why a nation should never include them in their homogeneous societies, because assimilation will never really take place, no matter how many generations pass, unless the immigrants are the same race as the natives of the country they immigrate to.  In that case, as has been proven in the US immigration works, because people of the same race WILL assimilate with their racial kin eventually.  <br>
    However, the vast majority of non-white people who immigrate here do not assimilate, nor do they want to.  In fact they hold themselves separate and apart, indicating loyaly only to their racial tribesmen over the new countryman and do so in  succeeding generations.<br>
    Blacks are for blacks everywhere and they make no secret of it.  Other races in this country mean nothing to them nor does the country itself unless they could somehow gain domination and control. <br>
    Hispanics pin the flags of the nations of origins on their walls, fly them in their yards, and in the case of Mexicans, they run through the streets holding them overhead, vividly displaying where their loyalties really lie, and it isn&rsquo;t with Gringos who defended the Alamo against their ancestors.  Unlike whites who eventually assimilate they do not, and they announce for all the world to hear that they don&rsquo;t intend to and that this land is their land and whites should go back to Europe.  They also cheer the Mexican team when it plays the US team, and they boo and spit on the American flag.<br>
    It&rsquo;s not possible to have a cohesive country that will stay together in times of great stress if the population is fractious and shares racial allegience to other countries of the world, as the blacks and Hispanics do. Nothing is more important than homogeneity.  A common history, language, racial basis, goals, and heroes is vitally important to the necessary unity of a nation.<br>
    Declaring that the Chinese in Canada are just showing their pride in their ethnicity and their country of origin by cheering them is an argument against having them there, because it is vivid proof that the country has even more elements whose presence brings about divisiveness, which is the greatest threat to the longevity of any nation.  <br>

			<p>&#8220;I am always amazed at the fear of China domination of the world? How can they do that? John, there is NO successful, NO powerful business in China, not one, that is not managed by Expats! NOT ONE!  Even the grand three rivers dam, the largest in the world, was managed and built with assistance from White-American and White-German experts. AND in the areas where the Chinese thought they were so smart and rejected White advice, they are ALREADY having  major problems at the three rivers dam. YES the dam is in serious trouble.  If all the Expats, if all the White-Americans were to leave China next week, in six months nothing would be produced or accomplished. China is incompetent.  But the media will not tell White-Americans that even though ANY one who has worked in China KNOWS the truth: China cannot function without the leadership and management of White-Americans.  If not for Russians giving China 30 year old technology AND helping them build, China would not even be in space. White-American space shuttle are 30 years old and STILL fly with z80 chips!!&#8221; </p>

			<p>To Intrepid:</p>
<p>First of all, in no way was I discrediting the round-robin victory over Canada by the Chinese curling team.  I watched the game and the team from China fought Canada tooth and nail.  It came down to the final stone.  Canada had the hammer&hellip;and dropped it.</p>
<p>What I, among many other observers, did not appreciate was the over-reaction celebration and broom tossing by the Chinese players after the shot was missed.  It was bad curling etiquette that is out of place in the sport.  You could blame a combination of unfamiliarity and immaturity on the part of the Chinese team for it.</p>
<p>Look, I can understand their being thrilled as Canada is always the team to beat at the championships; but teams from other countries have never hot-dogged like that after taking a round-robin game from Canada.</p>
<p>Second; I never suggested Asian people to be weaker than caucasians or anyone else for that matter.  Their brilliance, self-discipline, and efficiency in so many fields are to be commended.</p>
<p>For the record; the team from Japan that participated in the same championship also did well, finishing with a winning record and just off the podium.  A semi-final win by Canada over this team prevented an unheard of all-Asia curling final.</p>
<p>The team from Japan, like most of the other countries represented, come to Canada to compete in the WCT bonspiels and cashspiels and I have no problem with that; but they don&rsquo;t live in Canada for eight month of the year.</p>
<p>I participated in a local major bonspiel myself this past winter, and one of the other teams playing in it was none other than U.S. Olympic bronze medal winner, Pete Fenson.</p>
<p>I will say that the curling clubs I&rsquo;ve played in are among the last few places in our society where I can go in and relate to everybody there; mainly because everybody is caucasian.  This sentiment need not prevent the sport of curling from growing to other parts of the world nor prevent other races from playing.</p>
<p>You stated:</p>
<p>&#8220;China has proven great strength, ambition and aspirations of excellence. Canadians could learn from them and, in general, would be better served if they got off their high horses and drop the complacent attitudes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given that the Chinese team feels it need to live in Canada for the majority of the year, who&rsquo;s learning from whom?  </p>
<p>Perhaps the team should be dubbed &#8216;China-slash-Canada&rsquo;.  The fact they compete here for a living and could then win a world title or Olympic gold for China is something I cannot, and will not, support.<br>
