				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Carla Marinucci, San Francisco Chronicle, August 18, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama used his own name and heritage to make a point about change at a fundraiser that raised a record $7.8 million for his campaign in San Francisco Sunday.</p>
<p>The Illinois senator said it is &#8220;a testament to the American spirit that I&rsquo;m even standing here before you&#8221; as the Democratic Party&rsquo;s presumed nominee, because some Americans are &#8220;still getting past&#8221; his name, which he said some consider funny.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Hawaii-born Obama&rsquo;s references to his mixed heritage &mdash; he is the son of a black man from Kenya and a white woman from Kansas &mdash; comes just a week before the Democrats open their national nominating convention in Denver and after weeks of increasingly tough attacks from the campaign of Republican John McCain. Just weeks ago, McCain&rsquo;s campaign accused Obama of playing the race card for mentioning his race at a campaign event.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama told the group &mdash; which included many Indian and Pakistani immigrants &mdash; that he is not only familiar with their cultures &mdash; but also proud of his lifelong association with them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not only do I think I&rsquo;m a desi, but I&rsquo;m a desi,&#8221; he said, using a colloquial term that describes South Asian immigrants. The remark was greeted with laughs. &#8220;I&rsquo;m a homeboy.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But &#8220;the only way we are going to move beyond these current challenges .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is not to try to prevent further immigration and integration of our communities,&#8221; but &#8220;to recognize that you are the future.&#8221;</p>

			<p>The last time Obama spoke in SF, he let go of his infamous &#8220;bitter clingers&#8221; quote.  </p>
<p>With some of the words he said this time, this will only serve to countenance some of those rumors that are circulating about him.</p>

			<p>Oh, gee, what a shock. San Francisco has people who support Obama. Truly, shocking, to idiots! I mean we are talking about a city that protects murderous MS-13 gangbangers, and secretly and cowardly sends them to other parts of California. Since Obama is for no borders, I&rsquo;m just plain shocked that he would receive support in San Francisco, the famous sanctuary &#8220;city by the bay.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;&rsquo;Not only do I think I&rsquo;m a desi, but I&rsquo;m a desi,&rsquo; he said, using a colloquial term that describes South Asian immigrants. <b>The remark was greeted with laughs.</b> (Emphasis added.) &#8216;I&rsquo;m a homeboy&hellip;&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>From <i>Wikipedia</i> as of 08-19-2008/1535 hours:</p>
<p>&#8220;In this sense, (desi) can include:</p>
<p>    * Indo Aussies (Australians)<br>
    * British Asians<br>
    * Bangladeshis<br>
    * Sri Lankans<br>
    * Indo-Canadians<br>
    * Indo-Trinidadians<br>
    * Fijian Indians<br>
    * Indian South Africans<br>
    * Indo Kiwis (New Zealand)<br>
    * Indo-Mauritians (Mauritius)<br>
    * Punjabis<br>
    * South Asian Americans<br>
    * South Asians in Canada<br>
    * South Asians in Philippines<br>
    * South Asians in Zimbabwe</p>
<p>Within India, desi connotes &#8216;local&rsquo; or &#8216;indigenous&rsquo;, as distinct from videshi or pardesi (&#8216;foreigner&rsquo;). The word is rarely used derogatorily by Indians themselves to connote <b>something of poor or inferior quality.</b>&#8221; (Emphasis added.)</p>
<p>Given what we know about Obama&rsquo;s stunning intellectual powers, he might have just pulled the Punjabi equivalent of &#8220;<i> Ich bin ein Berliner</i>&#8221; with that crowd. They were probably laughing AT him, not WITH him. </p>

			<p>If anything, I wonder if Barack Obama in the Oval Office, might be the one thing that wakes up North American Whites from our self-destructive slumber, to realize how far we&rsquo;ve fallen.  Right now, our civilization is being undermined by stealth.  Success by Obama would finally bring it right out into the open.</p>

			<p>What Obama is, is a trained monkey, frolicking around, making an ass of himself.  No one is saying this to his face today.  But months and years from now, he will become a joke.</p>
<p>I think it very likely Obama is in for a rude shock at the DNC convention.  It&rsquo;s becoming more and more clear that he simply cannot defeat McCain&hellip;&hellip;and that the worst about him hasn&rsquo;t even surfaced yet.  Obama is a loser.  And the democratic party is RAPIDLY figuring that out.</p>
<p>There is a STRONG possibility that they will choose Clinton instead of him, at the 11th hour.  Certainly, she has positioned herself for that possibility.  All it will take is for McCain to pull ahead in the polls, even briefly, this month.</p>
<p>And he is so close to doing so.  So very, VERY close.</p>

B. Hussein is, as the entire world knows, 50% African and 50% Euro-American. </p>
<p>That makes him precisely ZERO PERCENT &#8220;desi.&#8221; </p>
<p>To tell such an obvious falsehood to curry (pardon the pun) favor with an East Indian audience, is an amazing act of misrepresentation and obfuscation   &mdash;   even by the deceitful standards of &#8220;The Third World&rsquo;s Manchurian Candidate.&#8221; <br>

<p>Yup, Obama wants to make whites a minority as soon as possible.  Another reason not to vote for him.  It amazes me that so many white people will vote for this man, who clearly wants European Americans to be the past.  Leave it to the Republican party to give white people no viable option.<br>

			<p>Most blacks really are ignorant enough to think South Asians are also black. Many also say the same of Arabs, Hispanics, and even Italians. I think deep-down, they hate their primative African roots. Also, it gives them a great excuse to try and race mix with others, by saying we are one and the same, let&rsquo;s get together.</p>

<p>Yes, I know, the first generations of US leaders wouldn&rsquo;t all have qualified under this statute-to-be.  We&rsquo;ll grandfather them.</p>
<p>Why hasn&rsquo;t this been long-ago implemented?</p>

			<p>Notice that Barack OBama is appealling directly to the racial/ethnic intetests of the Hindus and Pakistanis in OUR America. </p>
<p>Native Born White Americans will either organize  politically around their legitimate racial interests or they will face complete racial dispossession within the borders of America,the nation they founded.</p>
<p>Peter Brimelow had some justifiably nasty things to say about Roy Beck and numbersusa. Numbersusa is pushing the very big lie that America is an idea nation.According to numbersusa and Roy Beck the racial transformation of America isn&rsquo;t even an issue. It&rsquo;s ok to have an immigration that brings about the race replaement of White Americans street by street,town by town county by county as long as immigration policy doesn&rsquo;t cause over population.We here at numbersusa.com are trying to protect Yellow Stone and Yosemenite so that the genelines of Pakistani and Hindus can enjoy them for centuries to come. Do not financially support numbersusa. Give your money to American Renassaince.</p>

This is not altogether a bad thing. It will wake up White America, rather than lull them along thinking everything is fine as they slip deeper and deeper into dispossession. The sooner they wake up, see what is happening, and put a stop to it, the better. A B.H.O. presidency might very well ring the rising bell!<br>

<p>You are quite correct, Obama has no ethnic relation to Indians.  But read carefully what he said. &#8220;&hellip;he is not only familiar with their cultures &mdash; but also proud of his lifelong association with them&#8221;.</p>
<p>He is talking about culture, not race.  And he wasn&rsquo;t talking to the Indians in the audience (all right, he was, but he was stretching it a bit).  He was talking about the culture of the Pakistanis, with which he does indeed have a lifelong association.  It&rsquo;s called Islam.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;a also a way for them to ally themselves with any other darker culture who has some semblance of accomplishment. Let&rsquo;s face it. What did blacks ever really accomplish without tremendous help and aid.  And even then it&rsquo;s been marginal at best. So I&rsquo;m not surprised that they try to glob onto other cultures for some credibility since they have none of their own.</p>
