<p>The lawsuit continues an escalating feud between Dexter, Bernice and Martin Luther King III that has played out in the media.</p>
<p>Bernice King and Martin Luther King III sued Dexter King in July to force him to open the books of their father&rsquo;s estate, which sold a collection of more than 10,000 of his personal papers and books in 2006 for $32 million.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleges that since 2004, Martin and Bernice King have hindered The King Center&rsquo;s goals and misused the center&rsquo;s name and facilities. Among the incidents mentioned:</p>
<p>* In December 2004, Bernice King, who is a minister at New Birth Missionary Baptist Church, used The King Center and the eternal flame at King&rsquo;s tomb as part of a march organized by New Birth advocating a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. The King Center denied her permission to begin the march at King&rsquo;s tomb and accuses her of doing so in order to &#8220;provide support for her own personal cause as well as to enhance her personal standing in New Birth.&#8221;</p>
<p>* In January 2008, Martin Luther King III used The King Center to meet with then-Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards, whom he later endorsed.</p>
<p>* On another occasion, Dexter King says his elder brother &#8220;commandeered a reception being hosted on behalf of The King Center and turned it into his own wedding reception.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit, Martin Luther King III unsuccessfully attempted to oust his brother as chairman of the board. In September 2005, the board fired Martin Luther King III as president and chief executive officer, citing malfeasance. Bernice was also fired as secretary.</p>
<p>In December, Martin Luther King III founded Realizing the Dream, Inc., an Atlanta-based nonprofit aimed at continuing &#8220;the humanitarian and liberating work of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Mrs. Coretta Scott King.&#8221; According to the lawsuit, the foundation conflicts with Martin Luther King III&rsquo;s duties at The King Center.</p>
<p>Similarly, Bernice King founded the Coretta Scott King Foundation in December 2007, which the lawsuit says also competes with The King Center.</p>
<p>The lawsuit accuses both siblings of &#8220;demonstrating bad faith, being stubbornly litigious, and causing The King Center unnecessary trouble and expense&#8221; and seeks an undisclosed amount of money.<br>

			<p>From regular outbreaks of debauchery (on the part of Michael King) to malfeasance by King&rsquo;s offspring.  Could some soap opera writers, in NYC,  write a script to top this?  One could spend time wondering&hellip;but I won&rsquo;t.  Amateur anthropologists can see the Homo Africanus Criminalus for what it is&hellip;.</p>

<p>Have any of them been seen on youtube stuffing 100 dollar bills in their mouths? <br>

			<p>I do not expect that a great political or military leader ought necessarily to have worthwhile children, since we remember them for their skilled use of force to defeat our enemies, not for their decency.   However, if you&rsquo;re going to claim that Rev &#8220;Dr&#8221; MLK is a spiritual or moral leader, the behavior of his offspring is relevant evidence.  King spawned a bunch of grasping, no-count, hustlers, so we may rightly conclude that he was one himself.  <br>
     Does anyone know of any bastards of his, and what they might be doing?</p>

			<p>I may have posted this before  &mdash;  I can&rsquo;t recall  &mdash;  but it&rsquo;s relevant, I think, plus a great story:</p>
<p>I live in metro Atlanta. Some years ago  &mdash;  probably ten-plus  &mdash;  I was listening at work to local talk-radio host Neal Boortz, who is fairly unafraid to confront anything politically incorrect.</p>
<p>He took a call from someone who I recall was young, black and smart, and this caller made a brilliantly incisive observation about the matriarch of this little soap opera, Coretta Scott King. His description of her was sheer genius:</p>
<p>*professional widow*.</p>
<p>  &mdash;  wow. And the family drama continues even now. How could it be otherwise?</p>

			<p>Why are folks surprised at the behavior of the King &#8220;Children&#8221;?</p>
<p>Even if, MLK, was considered a man of principle, or a great personage, why is it supposed that the rest of the family must be moral, or upright, or somehow special. No one else is. The sons and daughters of movie stars, kings, queens, famous people of all types,etc., have often been downright totally worthless individuals. Why should the extended King Family be any different?</p>

			<p>King was qualified neither to be a Reverend nor a Doctor.  He was an effective speechifier who could articulate the dull yearnings of unsophisticated blacks and inspire them into organized acts of confrontational civil disobedience to create sensational chaos and gain media attention for the &#8220;civil rights&#8221; movement.  But he wasn&rsquo;t a great man worthy of a King Center, a monument on the D.C. pavillion, tens of millions of dollars, and a national holiday.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the King kids have &#8220;dreams&#8221; of their own as to the appropriate distribution of their inheritence.  It&rsquo;s kinda funny to see them squabbling over it; non-violently, of course.</p>

			<p>Only in America could this happen, such a flawed individual as MLK attain a near God like status, his widow and offspring become multi millionaires with out accomplishing anything.</p>

			<p>Uh..isnt this exactly what all of King&rsquo;s followers have been<br>
doing for the past 40 years? Fighting over perks, grants,<br>

			<p>That the MLK Story along with that of his offspring would make a good soap operate, I can only concur with. Now the difficult part: Casting the characters. Would, say Al Sharpton, fit the bill of the rabble-rouser using church funds to buy the services of prostitutes be a good choice? Now for the White prostitutes? I can think of several Hollywood starlets.</p>

			<p>Regardless of how far and apple falls from a tree, demonstrating bad faith, being stubbornly litigious, and causing unnecessary trouble and expense is very typical of the black race and a large part of the reason they are the least productive people to walk the face of the Earth. How typical is it that blacks will defend this sort of behavior no matter how far back it sets them from the rest of the world while blaming everyone else along the way. People are starting to notice this fact and it is only a matter of time before the gravy train is cut off for good. </p>

			<p>King, his family, and Atlanta are examples of shysterism at its worst.  MLK marched on DC and since then over 200,000 whites have been brutally murdered by racist black people.  And King&rsquo;s shyster organizations and their white shyster Bolshevik groups have never stood up in the defense of those innocent white brothers and sisters.  </p>
