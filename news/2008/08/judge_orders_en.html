<p>U.S. Judge Jose A. Fuste agreed with a lawsuit recently filed by two mainland-born Americans living on the island who argued a Spanish-only ballot discriminates against 14 percent of the nearly 4 million inhabitants in Puerto Rico whose first language is English.</p>
<p>Puerto Ricans vote on Nov. 4 for local officials and a nonvoting member of Congress. They are barred from voting for U.S. president even though they are U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>Bilingual ballots were used by political parties in this year&rsquo;s presidential primaries.</p>
<p>Bilingual ballots are sure to aggravate a small segment of the U.S. territory&rsquo;s population who view them as an attack on the former Spanish colony&rsquo;s cultural identity.</p>
<p>In 2003, Spanish again became the primary official language of Puerto Rico and English was given a secondary role.</p>

			<p>HAHA - I guess Puerto Ricans didn&rsquo;t like getting a taste of there own medicine. </p>

<p>Gee - now they KNOW HOW WE FEEL! Get over it - the US own Puerto Rico. Don&rsquo;t like it? Then buy your country back! Bunch of whiners. </p>

			<p>&#8220;In 2003, Spanish again became the primary official language of Puerto Rico and English was given a secondary role.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s too bad because many of the poor Puerto Ricans leave their dingy island and come to the main land for a better life. As Americans, they can not speak English and do not find a better life because of their refusal/inability to learn Standard American English.</p>
<p>Why does the PR government allow their people to NOT learn English? </p>

Isn&rsquo;t funny, if you don&rsquo;t give them a Spanish language ballot in the US you&rsquo;re guilty of &#8220;racism&#8221;. But, when the shoes on the other foot and English speakers demand a ballot in English it becomes and &#8220;attack on their cultural identity&#8221;. Does anyone need anymore evidence that hispanics are nothing more than imperialistic hypocrites.</p>

			<p>I hate to break it to you guys but most Puerto Ricans primarily speak ENGLISH.  As a Puerto Rican myself, I don&rsquo;t even know more than a handful of spanish words.  When the older folks get together, they speak spanish but when the young people (and by young, I mean 30 to 40 crowd&hellip;cough) get together we speak english only.  We are Americans.  English, not spanish is our native tongue.</p>
<p>If you meet a &#8220;puerto rican&#8221; who isn&rsquo;t native fluent in english, that&rsquo;s an illegal immigrant who snuck in and is trying to pass.</p>

<p>I was wondering how they got the 14% figure for FIRST language (i.e., born language) English-speakers&hellip; but this probably accounts for it, given that non-Hispanics are only about 2% of the population. (Dominicans, incidentally, are about 5%.) And this apparently does not count for many of the first language Spanish speakers who have switched over to English since they were children&hellip;</p>

			<p>Under the same ruling, all states will now be forced to print ballots in Spanish and other minority languages so as not to discriminate against those whose first language is not English.   </p>
<p>&ldquo;In 2003, Spanish again became the primary official language of Puerto Rico and English was given a secondary role.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wonder in how many States, Spanish will become the primary official language over the next 10 years? </p>

			<p>The amount of welfare and social services in Puerto Rico is staggering, that money doesn&rsquo;t come from Spain, the checks are printed in English, and therefore it should be the official language.</p>

			<p>It is time to launch a grassroots movement to grant Puerto Rico its independence and permanently sever all economic and political ties.  Puerto Ricio brings nothing positive to this country and it is a typical Hispanic parasitic drag we can do without&hellip;  </p>
