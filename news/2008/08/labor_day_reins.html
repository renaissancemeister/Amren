					</div>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Tyson Foods, Inc. announced today it has reached a new agreement with the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), an American union, reinstating Labor Day as one of the designated paid holidays under the contract for covered employees in the Shelbyville, Tennessee, plant.   <br>
 <br>
Tyson made this request on behalf of its Shelbyville plant employees, some of whom had expressed concern about the new contract provisions relative to paid holidays.  In an effort to be responsive, Tyson asked the union to reopen the contract to address the holiday issue, and the union agreed to do so.  The union membership voted overwhelmingly Thursday to reinstate Labor Day as one of the plant&rsquo;s paid holidays, while keeping Eid al-Fitr as an additional paid holiday for this year only.  This means that in 2008 only, Shelbyville employees will have nine paid holidays. <br>
 <br>
For the remainder of the five-year contract period, the eight paid holidays will include: New Year&rsquo;s Day, Martin Luther King Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day and a Personal Holiday, which could either be the employee&rsquo;s birthday, Eid al-Fitr or another day requested and approved by their supervisor.  <br>
 <br>
This issue concerns only the plant at Shelbyville, Tennessee.  Labor Day has always been celebrated, and continues to be, at the other 118 Tyson plants across the country. <br>
      <br>
The Shelbyville complex employs approximately 1,200 people.  Approximately 1,000 workers are covered by the RWDSU union agreement at that location.<br>

			<p>How are they going to manage 700-800 employees all taking off together on the same day for their &#8220;personal holiday?&#8221;</p>
<p>The fact that they eliminated Labor Day in the first place reinforces my decision to knowingly never buy another Tyson product again.<br>

			<p>The real issue here is that, with so many muslims working for Tyson, how long will it be before they poison our food as part of waging jihad?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t think that will happen?  There was a jew who didn&rsquo;t think that could happen when going to see his muslim doctor at Rush Medical in Chicago awhile back.  He died horribly, as that doctor kept him isolated, keeping other staff away from him and his life threatening condition when he showed up at their ER.  He had trained to be a doctor SPECIFICALLY so he could come to the US and wait for his chance to wage jihad.</p>
<p>More than enough reason to never eat Tyson products ever again.</p>

			<p>Tyson also has a long history of knowingly hiring illegal aliens. They were even smuggling them in at one point and keeping them in company barracks.I haven&rsquo;t bought their products in years.</p>

			<p>Next contract, the Mexican employees will insist Tyson drop Independence Day and substitute Cinco de Mayo, instead. Once a company caves into pressure by minorities, it never ends.</p>

			<p>This is good. These greedy monsters caved in after expressing &#8220;regrets&#8221;. Regrets are not enough however. Tyson must pay. The currency is money. Deny it to them. Make them truly &#8216;regretful&rsquo;. Make an example of them. Boycott them right out of business. Make these illegal-alien-loving, muslim-loving exploiting soulless monsters pay and pay and pay. Put them out of business and let it serve as an example of how their kind of behavior will truly be harmful to themselves.</p>

			<p>Tyson has dealt with the publicity issue.  The real issue has nothing to do with Tyson.  They simply had to find a way to accommodate an alien workforce allowed to invade the country by Whites.  White suicide is the real issue.</p>

			<p>Tyson must really suck to work for. At my job we have the standard holidays off, plus 2 floating holidays. The blacks use their floaters for MLK, the mestizos for cinco de mayo, the Asians for Chinese New Year, the Jews for Yom Kippur, and the Whites, the first day of buck season. The blacks complain we don&rsquo;t have off for MLK, officially, and management denied the mestizos their floaters for May Day and made them take a vacation day. Most companies accomodate &#8220;diversity&#8221;, Tyson is just a bunch of money grubbers which is why they hire immigrants to begin with. </p>

			<p>Tyson is typical of a big company with all of their &#8220;Bean Counters&#8221; screwing the American worker by hiring all these immigrants in the first place.Thereby putting descent hardworking American men in the poorhouse struggling to support their families.I don&rsquo;t know about the rest of you folks but I&rsquo;ve seen it get progressively worse over the years.&#8221;They get the gold mine,we get the shaft&#8221;.like the man said,God help us all&hellip;  </p>

			<p>I get our frozen chicken strips at Costco, but Costco and the Kirkland brand are just distributors.  We&rsquo;re out, and I don&rsquo;t have an empty bag handy, so I can not look at the actual producer.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Wright&#8221; brand bacon we have in our refrigerator says it was distributed for Tyson.  Hee, hee.  I wonder whether Tyson has Somali Muslims processing bacon.  I don&rsquo;t know whether to keep buying it or not, for just that reason.  If folks continue to buy bacon, but stop buying chicken from Tyson, where will the Somalis work?  Chickens are pretty nasty animals, too; what&rsquo;s the difference?  Those who doubt me have never been inside even a relatively clean chicken coop.</p>

			<p>I had a payback today. While walking through a local Sam&rsquo;s, samples of Tyson bacon were being handed out. I told the lady that I was boycotting Tysons. She didn&rsquo;t ask why and I don&rsquo;t think she would have understood. She just said her boss would only let her buy that brand. She was a Sam&rsquo;s employee, not a Tyson&rsquo;s employee, but it had her loyalty.</p>

			<p>Anyone even remotely sympathetic to the American Renaissance positions must, MUST make September 11th a holiday to honor our martyrs murdered by the Islamic illegal aliens, invaders on 9/11/01. In particular the 300 Irish American fireman who went up the stairs of the WTC when everyone else was fleeing in terror - those White NYFD heroes must be honored and the enemy - the OTHER as represented by Mohammed Ata and the other vile, ugly racial alien murderers of our people must be remembered and our people instructed that this is what happens when we don&rsquo;t control our borders, when we tolerate very hateful, hostile non Western people, let them come in to our nation, neighborhoods. </p>
<p>We in America must change. We need our own holidays like the Muslims and certain Jewish sects. We must stop this insanity of trying to make every hostile, diseased criminal non White in the world, turn them into a good, patriotic American by trying to assimilate them. It doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>

			<p>Could it be that the union outsmarted Tyson?  Perhaps the union knew the outcry would send Tyson reeling and thus the workers get 9, instead of 8, holidays.</p>

			<p>The outrage that the Tyson Foods action sparked *must* take root and flourish, my friends. I&rsquo;ve been advocating for years that we boycott *all* companies that are detrimental to the culture of White people. I do not give a damn if they call us a racist or not. Boycott them!!! Never buy from Tyson again and do not yield in your resolve! Not one penny! It&rsquo;s past time that we showed corporate America who holds the purse strings! </p>
<p>Which company is next?<br>

			<p>Boycotts work wonders don&rsquo;t they?  Even the threat of a boycott gets the bigwigs&rsquo; knees trembling.  What they realized is that there are fortunately still more of us than them.</p>
<p>But just the fact that they were proposing this ridiculous holiday means I won&rsquo;t be buying any Tyson products in the future.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t know that I necessarily agree with those who say they will never buy Tyson products ever again   &mdash;    regardless.   If so, then you are giving them no reason to &#8220;see the light&#8221;.</p>

			<p>I see where everyone is criticizing Tysons, which is understandable, but no one has mentioned the RDWSU (the employees union) as complicit in this.  In contract negotiations it takes two sides to reach an agreement.  I doubt Tysons merely demanded and received the concession to change the holiday.  It had to be agreed to by both sides.  What is ironic is that the Union was willing to give up, in essence Labor&rsquo;s holy day, to appease the Muslims in it&rsquo;s ranks.  And on the flip side, the Muslim union members affiliation with it&rsquo;s Unions ideals apparently is not as strong as it&rsquo;s adherence to it religious beliefs.  It is apparent, as in most cases now days, that all institutions on all sides of the spectum have become anti-western, anti-white to the extent that even the neutral aspects of the institutions are now coming under attack as the third world forces its beliefs, ideaologies and customs upon the Western world.   </p>

			<p>A &#8220;Personal Holiday&#8221; sounds like an excellent way around this impasse.  That way, it could be used by anybody for anything. All groups will be accommodated and everyone should be satisfied.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that the paid holidays at Tyson include MLK Day but do not include President&rsquo;s Day. I suppose MLK was more important than George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. </p>

			<p>I wrote Tyson a hard-hitting letter, one which I&rsquo;m sure added to the onslaught of nastygrams that deluged them when this story first broke.</p>
<p>I was very happy to see how fast this all turned around  &mdash;  but I&rsquo;m still boycotting Tyson Foods, and I&rsquo;m still urging all my friends/family to do so also.</p>
<p>The only way I&rsquo;ll even think about calling off the boycott is if Tyson makes a national press release that apologizes to all of us for refrring to us in an earlier press release as &#8220;BIGOTS&#8221; for objecting to the whole scuttling of Labor Day in favor of the Muslim holiday.</p>
<p>A couple of other posters here have noted how effective and quick our boycott worked to get them to reverse course  &mdash;  I&rsquo;m now resolved to undertake, as a national project and an avocation, the Caucasian version of Jesse Jackson&rsquo;s Action Network or whatever he calls his shakedown operation/boycott coalition&hellip;it now appears that it&rsquo;s really the only way we can get these corporations to stop with all the &#8220;diversity&#8221; garbage and heed common sense, bottom line, traditional American values/culture.</p>
<p>The Shelbyville situation is one where our commercial protest is actually a matter of national security, what with Muslims steadily and stealthily burrowing in and attempting to turn their toe-hold into a stranglehold, as they&rsquo;ve done in Europe, Great Britain, Canada&hellip;sleepers and openly encroaching Islamists MUST be stopped!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to take a lot more &#8220;bigotry&#8221; to save the West!  </p>

			<p>Tyson tried a tactic which they believed would endear themselves to their imported labor, because they perceived keeping them happy will increase their bottom line.</p>
<p>You see, here it is.  An excellent example of an American corporate greed monger ready and willing to replace our traditions and heritages if they can profit from it.  </p>
<p>America can only be saved if it plummets into a deep depression, causing all the greed merchants to stop importing warm bodies with which to enrich themselves, and encouraging the others already here to go home and look for work.</p>
