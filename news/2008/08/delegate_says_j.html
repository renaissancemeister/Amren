<h1>Delegate Says Jones Called Her &lsquo;Uncle Tom&rsquo;</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Abdon M. Pallasch and Dave Mckinney, Chicago Sun-Times, August 25, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>&#8220;Last night, I was called an &lsquo;Uncle Tom&rsquo; by Emil Jones [state Senate president] in the lobby of the hotel, right in front of [Ald.] Freddrenna Lyle and [Ald.] Leslie Hairston and [Ald.] Latasha Thomas,&#8221; said [Delmarie] Cobb, [a black Chicago political consultant and] a member of Clinton&rsquo;s Illinois Steering Committee. &#8220;I walked over to him and asked him, &lsquo;What did you just call me?&rsquo; &#8220;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lyle, alderman of the South Side&rsquo;s 6th Ward, said she was standing with Jones when the conversation took place in the lobby of the hotel where the Illinois delegation is staying, but she dismissed it as Jones engaging in harmless banter with someone he knows, although Lyle said she told him, &#8220;Emil, that&rsquo;s bad even for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another of the aldermen who was standing in the lobby added, &#8220;He said it in jest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cobb has been a high-profile Clinton supporter, and she said she is still paying the price in the African-American community.</p>
<p>&#8220;If people are still making digs at the Hillary Clinton people because we supported her, that is not going to bring us on board. It makes us feel as though we&rsquo;re outsiders, and we&rsquo;re Democrats,&#8221; Cobb said. &#8220;The litmus test for being black is [seen as] supporting Barack.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cobb said she saw Clinton supporters walking into an Illinois delegation meeting at the Marlowe Restaurant on Sunday and being handed Obama buttons, only to put the buttons in their pockets. That prompted the greeters to say, &#8220;You can tell the Hillary Clinton people, they never take the buttons.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cobb said the confrontation started when she and Jones, who is also African-American, were talking about an earlier conversation they had at the Bud Billiken Parade in Chicago. &#8220;One day, you&rsquo;ll be on the right side,&#8221; Cobb said Jones told her. She told him she was on the right side. She said Jones pointed at his Obama hat and said, &#8220;No, this is the right side,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then he came up behind me. He said &lsquo;Thirty-five thousand people went to Springfield [to support Obama on Saturday],&rsquo;&#8221; she said. &#8220;I said, &lsquo;Then 35,000 people drank the Kool-Aid.,&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;Barack is a clean-cut guy. He never liked gutter politics, that&rsquo;s why the Clintons did so-and-so.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to get into this. So I went over to the elevator, and he said, &lsquo;Uncle Tom!&rsquo; Then he grabbed me and hugged me and started laughing. I said, &lsquo;What did you say?&rsquo; I turned to Freddrenna Lyle, and I said, &lsquo;What did he say?&rsquo; She wouldn&rsquo;t say anything, That&rsquo;s when I said some bad things to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Taking a final shot at Jones, Cobb said, &#8220;Calling me an &lsquo;Uncle Tom&rsquo; is beyond the pale, especially considering where he is [close] with Mayor Daley and with [Gov.] Blagojevich, I am hardly the Uncle Tom here.&#8221;</p>

			<p>But last night, on PBS&rsquo;s coverage, Jimmy Carter called Barack Obama a &#8220;boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also, I noticed that, for the short time I flipped by PBS&rsquo;s coverage (I settled on C-SPAN because it&rsquo;s relatively commentator free), they were going on like there was some rift between Jimmy Carter and Ted Kennedy.  They said that TK was a &#8220;working class hero&#8221; who represented New Deal Populism, while JC was a &#8220;moderate,&#8221; a &#8220;pragmatist,&#8221; who embraced &#8220;fiscal restraint.&#8221;</p>
<p>I mean, where do they come up with this stuff?  Ted Kennedy a working class hero?  The real working class whites in Boston in the 1970s, fighting deseg with George Wallace and the Citizens Councils, despised him.  How many working class people do you know who has eight yachts?</p>
<p>Jimmy Carter was no moderate, either.  He was racial liberal, egalitarian, globalist and CFR/TC all the way.</p>
<p>The only reason there was a supposed &#8220;rift&#8221; between them was because, as late as 1980, the media believed that the Presidency was a Kennedy birthright, TK saw JC weakness, so he ran.  But lost.</p>
<p>Maybe the reason all these talking heads in Denver are saying all these kooky things is that Mayor John Hickenlooper (amnesty and open borders all the way) told the cops not to arrest anyone for weed possession.</p>

			<p>I wonder if any of these blacks actually knows who &#8220;Uncle Tom&#8221; was.</p>

			<p>Typical black malarkey. Doesn&rsquo;t matter a bit. When the chips are down, they&rsquo;ll all vote for Obama. If OJ was the candidate, they&rsquo;d vote for him.</p>

			<p>Just shows if black people don&rsquo;t have whitey to kick around they will place the race-card on each other.</p>

			<p>So the logic is if you&rsquo;re Black and don&rsquo;t vote Black, you&rsquo;re a race traitor, and if you&rsquo;re White and don&rsquo;t vote Black, you&rsquo;re a racist.  If everyone accepted that logic, Barack would get 100% of the vote.  Which won&rsquo;t happen.<br>

			<p>Just more racist garbage, how dare a black support a white? Wasn&rsquo;t uncle Tom a fictional &#8220;male&#8221; character? Plus since ole slick was the first black president, doesn&rsquo;t that make Hellory the first black first whatever?</p>

<p>Self-Test For Racist Tendencies<br>
1. Is it OK for a Black to vote for a Black based solely on skin color?<br>
2. Is it OK for a White to vote for a White based solely on skin color?<br>
3. Explain why you have two different answers<br>

			<p>B.H.O. may think that the Hillary white women are going to come back to the Messiah in order to &#8220;unite&#8221; the party. They won&rsquo;t! These women have had their feelings hurt by this black misogynistic Messiah (and his wife) and they ain&rsquo;t gonna forgive and forget either. </p>
<p>If B.H.O. had one tenth of the intelligence that the media claims that he has he would have chosen Hillary!</p>
<p>There is a legendary 94 year old man who still, more or less, runs a country store and barbecue restaurant out side of my home town in Alabama. Bob&rsquo;s place is one of the few places where people of all races, professions, and backgrounds can be found eating lunch together while heatedly discussing their three favorite topics: college football, politics, and religion. The fact that Bob&rsquo;s is no longer open after dark stands stark testament to the fact that Alabama politics, football, religion tend not to mix very well with Alabama alcohol! At least at lunch time most of the patrons are relatively sober.   </p>
<p>The owner of this unique establishment is known far and wide as &#8220;Uncle Bob&#8221;. He is considered to be a seer on politics as he allegedly hasn&rsquo;t missed calling an election correctly in the last seventy years. He has from fifteen to twenty five major newspapers in his store at all times, in short, Bob likes to keep up with things.</p>
<p>According to Bob, it would be difficult to find any candidate anywhere dumber than B.H.O. He said to me yesterday: &#8220;you know even a grasshopper would know that his only chance of getting elected would be by having Hillary on the ticket&#8221;.        </p>
<p>MoMo</p>
<p>P.S. Uncle Bob is black!</p>
