						<p>Gov. Timothy M. Kaine&rsquo;s administration has achieved one of its top goals &mdash; buying 40 percent of all state products and services from small, women- and minority-owned businesses.</p>
<p>But a Washington Post review of the state program designed to help such businesses secure government work shows that a vast majority of the 15,800 participating companies are small businesses owned by white men, a fifth are outside the state and an untold number have failed to receive any state contracts.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>State officials agree that the Small, Women- and Minority-owned Business program, called SWaM, needs to be improved, but they said it has made significant strides in recent years despite regular complaints from businesses both in and out of the program.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Since 1975, when Virginia opened its first minority business office, the state has been criticized for failing to help companies secure state contracts.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, state agencies began establishing goals for minority business spending, but after two decades, the number of companies receiving contracts remained about the same.</p>
<p>A first-of-its-kind study in 2003 found that less than a half-percent of state money in Virginia was spent on minority businesses, far behind other states, including Maryland and North Carolina.</p>
<p>Then-Gov. Mark R. Warner (D) called for 40 percent of spending by the state&rsquo;s 160 agencies, departments and universities to come from certified SWaM vendors. His successor, Kaine (D), campaigned on that goal and made it a top priority when he came into office.</p>
<p>Under Kaine, the state has quietly and aggressively worked toward the 40 percent goal, partly by adopting new guidelines that require state agencies to give significant scoring advantage to SWaM vendors for contracts exceeding $100,000.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the fiscal year that ended June 30, 5.34 percent of the state&rsquo;s $5 billion discretionary spending went to minority-owned businesses; 3.94 percent went to women-owned businesses; and 28.9 percent went to small businesses, all of them certified in the SWaM program.</p>
<p>By comparison, more than 17 percent of the state&rsquo;s businesses were minority-owned and almost 30 percent were women-owned in 2002, the most recent statistics available from the Small Business Administration.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Since the 1960s, state and federal governments have experimented with goals and mandates to boost contracts to minority- and women-owned businesses. Some programs have been challenged in court.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Unlike other states, Virginia has never set aside any contracts for minority- and women-owned vendors. It does, however, set aside contracts for all SWaM-certified companies.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some companies in Virginia, including some with long records of working for the state, have lost contracts recently in the state&rsquo;s eagerness to hire small, women- and minority-owned businesses.</p>
<p>At least two companies are formally protesting losing bids to SWaM companies, which they claim come at taxpayer expense. In both cases, the losing bids were lower in cost than the SWaM bids.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of people are concerned about the cost factor,&#8221; said Del. Christopher B. Saxman (R-Staunton), who heads the General Assembly&rsquo;s Cost-Cutting Caucus and has heard similar complaints about lower bids being rejected. &#8220;If it&rsquo;s costing the state money, then it&rsquo;s probably worth refining.&#8221;</p>
<p>In recent years, the General Assembly has considered changing or abolishing the agencies that run the SWaM program.</p>
<p>Del. R. Steven Landes (R-Augusta), who has sponsored such bills in the past, said he wanted to streamline the agencies and save taxpayer money. But Del. Brian J. Moran (Alexandria), chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, described the proposals as &#8220;veiled attempts&#8221; to eliminate a program crucial to help small, women- and minority-owned businesses that has made &#8220;significant progress&#8221; in recent years.</p>
<p>About 15,800 businesses are certified in the SWaM program, up from almost 4,000 when Kaine came into office in January 2006. A majority of them are small companies.</p>
<p>Virginia defines small businesses as those that have fewer than 250 employees or $10 million or less in sales a year, a more permissive standard than other states and one that opens the SWaM program to more companies.</p>
<p>About 20 percent of the companies in the program are from out of state.</p>
<p>Hayes said out-of-state companies are included so that Virginia businesses can be considered in other states&rsquo; certification programs. &#8220;If you block them out, they block you out,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Many companies praise the SWaM certification process, which the Kaine administration has made simpler and quicker, but they complain about not receiving contracts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certification does not bring you contracts,&#8221; Hayes said. &#8220;What certification does for you is make you eligible to participate. It puts you in a position to compete.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tracy Blake, who manages a small, minority-owned landscaping company, Grass Guru, said that after the business became SWaM certified, he made an appointment with the Virginia Department of Transportation to learn how to submit bids.</p>
<p>Now, he said, all of the company&rsquo;s work planting flowers in medians in Northern Virginia is for the state.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s all about effort,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You have to jump-start things yourself.&#8221;<br>

			<p>A lot of this is smoke and mirrors. A lot of minority owned business are just figure heads. They officially get the contract and then hire a qualified white subcontract to actually do the work. I routinely do work that is contracted out to minority and women owned companies and they hire me to actually carry out the work. So the original client feels warm and fuzzy not knowing that the work was actually done by a white male - haha! By the way, if I were contracting I would voluntarily seek out companies owned by white women because in my experience in business white businesswomen, on average, are more honest and less sleazy than white businessmen. Sorry if that offends anybody but I call &#8216;em as I see &#8216;em.</p>

			<p>The Cultural Marxists who are successfully destroying the United States as a White, Western nation have been very clever in extending affirmative action (and other things, like exploitative divorce laws) toward White women as well as toward Blacks and Latinos.  </p>
<p>What the Cultural Marxists have done, effectively, is to turn White women against White men, and push our own women to join Blacks and Latinos in a social and political coalition to destroy the White moorings of this nation.  It&rsquo;s very effective, you have to admit.  Even though it also reminds one of Lenin&rsquo;s maxim about &#8220;useful idiots&#8221;  &mdash;   White women are targeted disproportionately by Third World criminals imported by the millions into the USA, Canada, Britain and Australia each year, and as White civilization in these countries collapses more and more each year, those same White women fighting against White men to extend affirmative action and divorce laws that take out the country&rsquo;s most productive people, are also digging their own graves and becoming increasing targets for the Third World onslaught that is inundating our countries.</p>

			<p>We have the same thing in Florida.  Supplies that are needed must be ordered through a list of minority businesses.  For this piece of socialist propaganda the taxpayer must pay 5oo% over what the supplies would cost from a normal vendor.  Many times work is interrupted because the unreliability of the approved vendor.  </p>

I totally agree with this statement, I have more than a little experience in matters like this and white women do in fact, tend to be more honest than any others.</p>

			<p>Sounds like a lot of people are snowed on this one. Like most manual labor, normally - and in most types of ML, there is a white person in charge, the foreman, then they hire on a load  of illegals- mexicans, who speak no english, etc. He makes out like a bandit, and the buyer get s CR#$ product, that falls apart in 2 years, since it was made by totally unskilled laborers. I&rsquo;ve personally seen this done firsthand in carpentry, concrete, electrical work, steel work, etc. <br>
All of this puts white out of business. Laws like this are meant to get minority votes and screw whites.<br>
Reminds me of the University of Iowa, where minorities flock - even from outside the country, to go to college for free - even with failing grades. All the while, whites pay full tuition, while minorities suck up the scholarships, low or free tuition. It&rsquo;s a joke. The whole country has been turned into cr@%.</p>

			<p>It was just on here that women make up 65% of government employees, and that in 16 of 17 branches of the federal government, blacks are overrepresented for their share of the population, by as much as 600%. I wonder if this included the military?</p>
<p>Frankly, the goverment should clean up it&rsquo;s own house before demanding the private sector do the same. </p>

<p>Yes, it does pretty much represent what I see of the military in the last 5 years working with the military. Not so much in the Special Forces and other Elite units though for some reason.</p>

<p>What a vulgar and ignorant comment. It is very interesting how this site goes to great effort not to offend Jews, but white women are routinely slandered. I&rsquo;m tired of the nasty comments about how we supposedly love blacks, when in reality it&rsquo;s a minority who are obese, ugly, and/or mentally disturbed.</p>
<p>On the off chance this comment is actually published, here&rsquo;s some advice: You will never become mainstream as long as you routinely insult 50% of the white race.</p>
