						<p>White populations have declined in more than half of the USA&rsquo;s counties since 2000, helping fuel a rise in the number of communities where minorities are now the majority, an analysis of 2007 Census estimates released today shows.</p>
<p>The data reflect how immigration, a population boom among Hispanics and the slowing growth of an aging population of whites are reshaping the nation&rsquo;s demographic landscape.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Minorities made up more than half the population in 302 of the nation&rsquo;s 3,141 counties last year. Most such areas in the early 1990s were centered in established metropolitan areas and border cities in the Southwest.</p>
<p>Now, counties where minorities are a majority are popping up &#8220;all over the place,&#8221; not just in areas where immigrants traditionally first settled, says William Frey, a Brookings Institution demographer. A continuing migration of African Americans to the South also is furthering this trend, he adds.</p>
<p>Though whites are 66% of the population nationwide, &#8220;it&rsquo;s kind of a zero sum game. Hispanic and Asians are growing nationally and they can spread out,&#8221; Frey says.</p>
<p>Because the white population is growing very slowly, whites leaving many communities are not replaced by other whites. At the same time, the white population continues to grow rapidly in many Sun Belt counties.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At least 10 counties are on the brink of seeing such change by 2010, Frey says. They include Clark County, Nev., the heart of the Las Vegas metropolitan area, which was 52.3% white in 2007, and Denver County, Colo., which was 50.7% white.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The number of counties that are predominantly minorities likely will increase as white baby boomers retire from densely populated communities, says Mark Mather, a demographer for the Washington, D.C.-based Population Reference Bureau.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other highlights in the population estimates for July 1, 2007:</p>
<p>* In more than a quarter of the 1,800 counties that grew from 2000 to 2007, Hispanics provided at least half of the gains. San Diego County gained 161,000 residents, including 150,000 Hispanics. Hartford County, Conn., gained 19,600, including 18,600 Hispanics.</p>
<p>* Blacks are returning to New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. The number of non-Hispanic black residents in Orleans Parish grew by 16.4% to 144,050 between 2006 and 2007.</p>

			<p>The US is breaking up into three countries&hellip;.mexican narco-terrorists to the west, blacks to the south and whites consolidating in the rest.  The US will probably break into three actual countries (with the white country allowing zero immigration).  This may or may not involve a civil war.</p>
<p>What is certain is this split is already well advanced.  Eventually, the white areas are going to find a way to keep tax money to themselves and force local and state government to supercede the feds.  There will be trouble over it, of course.  But not as much as you think.</p>

<p>I would say without some kind of intervention America is breaking off into two territories. One Black, one Hispanic and a remainder which will be contested by both blacks and hispanics and will eventually be absorbed by one or the other. </p>
<p>There are a lot of places on the map where the population is getting younger. I wonder how long it took them to think up that cheery looking demographic? </p>

<p>Does anyone really believe the White population is growing at all? Are there enough White immigrants to make up for below replacement fertility? Also, the White population groups that grows in Sun Belt counties are heavily old and dying.</p>

			<p>Nonsense, without white money and brains these &#8216;majority minorities&rsquo; will see a population crash that will make the dinosaur&rsquo;s demise look like a demographic blip. <br>
As for the Euro population in North and South America, I would say that reports of their death have been greatly exaggerrated. As always take these MSM reports with a grain of salt. Doesn&rsquo;t anyone remember the recent, laughable prediction that redheads would be extinct in a hundred years? Read between the lines for the truth, don&rsquo;t trust the establishment, propaganda is a part of every war.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Because the white population is growing very slowly, whites leaving many communities are not replaced by other whites. At the same time, <b>the white population continues to grow rapidly in many Sun Belt counties.</b>&#8221;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the rapid growth of Whites in the Sun Belt area is probably due to the influx of retirees. The future looks bleak.</p>
<p>When I was a child in the early 70&rsquo;s with the space program and other rapidly changing technological advances, even despite Vietnam, there was a sense of optimism. My parents instilled a good work ethic and valued education. I figured everyone else would too and I would project my imagination into the future and see a highly advanced, well-educated, sophisticated, respectful, safe, and prosperous future. Of course, I was terribly wrong.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s no coincidence that our downward status as a people and a nation is a direct correlation of the percentage of Whites in society. In 1970, it was approximately 90% White. Now, it is approximately 66% White (and falling fast). I guess I can only look back now and see with acute 20/20 vision that I WAS living in a Utopian society in the Midwestern United States back in 1972. And that I now live in a diasporic one.</p>
<p>Oh, the &#8220;joys&#8221; of diversity.</p>

			<p>Much of the USA has become totally unrecognizable, especially in Southwestern states and in Florida.  This is why so many White Americans, Australians, Canadians and even Britons are emigrating  &mdash;   our home has been plundered and it&rsquo;s too late to stop it.  All of these places will be majority non-White by 2030 or earlier.  They&rsquo;ll all soon look like Arizona, California, or anywhere in downtown London, Sydney or Toronto  &mdash;   outposts of the Third World, imported home.</p>
<p>There are still a few places left.  Some Central Europe countries like the Swiss, Denmark, Germany, Austria, Finland, Alpine Italy are 97% White or more, restrict their immigration to Nordic/Germanic peoples (bloodline immigration), and even reviving their Christian roots.  You&rsquo;ll have to learn some German and raise your kids in the language, but that seems like a tiny sacrifice to be able to live in a Western nation with a still-vigorously Western culture.  And the irony is, as these countries see so North America, the UK, Australia and some other Western countries collapse around them into 3rd-world status, they&rsquo;ll assert even more solidarity over protecting their heritage.</p>

			<p>With America already on a slippery economic slope, one doesn&rsquo;t have to stretch the imagination very far to see the writing on the wall for these majority-minorites areas. The enonomic and subsequent social chaos in these areas is already a foregone conclusion, and it is only a matter of time&hellip;&rsquo;til the white money and infrastructure runs out and collapses. </p>

			<p>Whether the U.S. breaks up into three countries or not like one poster suggested, will not mean an end to the burdens of the parts whites live in. I believe there will still be a central governing body of some type anyway, and that governing body will continually shift the resources of the haves to the have nots. The new world order will still have a firm grip, in other words.</p>

			<p>Remember it&rsquo;s worse than it sounds because people from the Middle East are counted as white.  These people have to be 5% of the population.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing that the cowards in the conservative movement won&rsquo;t speak out about this.  Outside of the neocons(who are rabidly anti-white and enthusiastically support race replacement), most conservatives privately don&rsquo;t want America to become less white, but they won&rsquo;t say so in public.  </p>

<p>Do we have to hear this same thing everytime something is published on demographics? Move to Germany? thats the answer for our problems, move to Germany? I have news. America has the largest stockpile of nuclear weapons of every country on earth. If this place falls to civil war and is conquered by radicalized 3rd worlders, your New German paradise crumples like a wet newspaper. So please stop with the running Lufthansa advertisement. </p>

			<p>It is much worse than even many realize.  The demographic of whites is much more lopsided to the older demographic than that of the other racial groups.  The Baby Boom generation is huge, comparatively speaking, while those in the &#8220;Baby Bust&#8221; generation (born between 1973-1980) are few. As a result of the massive numbers of abortions in this year, as well as &#8220;free love&#8221;, broadscale promotion of contraceptives, and the feminist movement, there are fewer whites to have babies.  Added further, the feminist movement, the holding off of getting married, the leisure lifestyle, all courtesy of technology, etc., has literally helped destroy white birth rates further.  The amount of whites in the child age cohort is smaller than it was ten years ago, and in most areas, it is smaller than it was during the &#8220;Baby Bust&#8221; era.  As the boomers die off, we are going to see a massive population shift, one that is already being seen in the schools.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been compiling statistics of area school schools in the Atlanta area.  Here are the middle schools&rsquo; white percentages:<br>
School/2008 white percentage/2004 white percentage/2000 white percentage/ 1998 white percentage</p>
<p>Creekland: 46%/66%/79%/84%<br>
Dacula: 47%/76%/92%/95%<br>
Duluth: 26%/48%/63%/75%<br>
Five Forks: 54%/71%/86%/93%</p>
<p>There are many more examples of this, and it is broad scale (in most areas).  Furthermore, if you were to compare the schools with 1990, it is even worse.</p>
<p>Considering the demographic implosion, I haven&rsquo;t even taken into account the illegal invasion of Mexicans and central Americans, their high birth rates, as well as the ridiculous numbers of legal immigrants and their high birth rates.</p>
<p>How can a country survive like this?  I don&rsquo;t think that it can.</p>

			<p>My rural-exurban county of Queen Anne&rsquo;s on Maryland&rsquo;s Eastern Shore is becoming whiter due to white flight from the Washington and Baltimore metropolitan areas.  Despite all the hosannahs whites gie to diversity, few actually practice it.</p>

<p>Yeah, in fact I&rsquo;d say maybe five or six countries.  The ones you suggest above are basically correct.  But also some smaller curiosities like &#8220;Michiganistan,&#8221; our own Muslim-majority disaster zone in the Upper Northwest, much like England itself (which will be Muslim-majority, period) and the Muslim-dominated parts of Australia and Canada in 20 years.  </p>
<p>Also, there won&rsquo;t be just one remaining &#8220;White country&#8221; carved out of the territory, but two or even three.  I&rsquo;d imagine that conservative White Southerners (and their brethren in the conservative Plains States and Idaho/Montana), and the foolish liberal Whites in the Northeast and Pacific Northwest, would be quite happy to be free of each other.  (&#8220;Southern Whites&#8221; would  basically be &#8220;the Upper South&#8221; in this case  &mdash;   the Deep South along with much of Illinois would basically be majority African-American.)  Plus, the exclaves like Hawaii and Alaska, as well as Florida, would go their own ways too.  I&rsquo;d just hope it could be done with a relatively clean separation.</p>

			<p>The slow-motion barbarian invasion is succeeding in America because protection against such a thing happening is left up to the government by the people - but our corporate-agenda federal government wants the invasion to happen, and will continue to use legal force to see that it does, no matter who is elected.</p>

			<p>Miroslav,</p>
<p>I like your posts, they bring me hope.  Keep them up. I just hope you&rsquo;re right as I thought I recently heard from somewhere that Germany will cease to exist in 50 years.</p>
<p>By the way, my wife would like to move to Europe but I still wonder if Europe will really be all that much better off than living in one of the US Mountain states.</p>

			<p>I love this forum, but the overwhelming majority of posts increasingly reek of despair and surrender.  However, when I suggest using tactics considerably more effective than harsh language to deal with illegals and traitors my post is pulled.  If anyone has a viable solution to dealing with the threats we face without getting blood on our hands I would love to hear it&hellip;<br>
