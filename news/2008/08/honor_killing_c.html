<p>But while honor killings may be more prevalent in the Middle East, no longer are they unknown in the West.</p>
<p>In the Atlanta suburb of Jonesboro last month, a Pakistani immigrant allegedly strangled his 25-year-old daughter with a bungee cord because she was determined to end her arranged marriage and had gotten involved with a new man. According to the Atlanta Journal Constitution, Sandeela Kanwal&rsquo;s father, Chaudhry Rashid, &#8220;told police he is Muslim and that extramarital affairs and divorce are against his religion [and] that&rsquo;s why he killed her.&#8221; In court last week, a detective quoted Rashid: &#8220;God will protect me. God is watching me. I strangled my daughter.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Upstate New York a few weeks earlier, Waheed Allah Mohammad, an immigrant from Afghanistan, was charged with attempted murder after repeatedly stabbing his 19-year-old sister. The Rochester Democrat and Chronicle reported that Mohammad was &#8220;infuriated because his younger sister was going to clubs, wearing immodest clothing, and planning to leave her family for a new life in New York City&#8221; &mdash; she was a &#8220;bad Muslim girl,&#8221; he told sheriff&rsquo;s investigators.</p>
<p>On New Year&rsquo;s Day in Irving, Texas, the bullet-riddled bodies of the Said sisters &mdash; Sarah, 17, and Amina, 18 &mdash; were found in an abandoned taxi. Police issued an arrest warrant for their father, an Egyptian immigrant named Yaser Abdel Said, who had reportedly threatened to kill them upon learning that they had boyfriends. According to the Dallas Morning News, Yaser Said was given to &#8220;gun-waving rants about how Western culture was corrupting the chastity of his daughters.&#8221;</p>
<p>While many authorities say that Islamic religious tradition does not sanction honor killing, it has long been accepted in many Muslim societies all the same. {snip}<br>

<p><br>
Then why move his family to America in the first place and risk his daughters being &#8220;corrupted&#8221;?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s unless, of course, you&rsquo;re a muslim male. Then you can cheat on your wife as much as you want and get rid of her in any fashion you choose, divorce or murder, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>

<p>I can understand his point of view on this.  &#8220;Western culture&#8221;, as it&rsquo;s practiced nowadays, has much to be desired.  All the more reason why he should have remained in Egypt.  He chose not to remain in Egypt and now he is a double murderer and I hope his justice is bitter indeed.</p>

			<p>What I don&rsquo;t get is how much disrespect these people have for our laws.  When I&rsquo;m in another country, I keep a low profile.  I watch what the locals are doing.  The people coming here are either too primative to adhere to our rules, or just don&rsquo;t care.  My gut feeling is that they recognize that we are a &#8216;soft&rsquo; culture, and they know they can get away with almost anything.</p>

<p>Does this mean that these &#8220;very smart people&#8221; who are supposed to know what is best for us couldn&rsquo;t forsee this, plus a myriad of problems connected with a push for multiculturalism?  </p>
<p>I mean, I did, as well as millions of other ordinary people.</p>
<p>Now what about their grusome practices of absuing little animals, killing them for some idiotic religious ritual, or just plain cruelty?</p>
<p>Were these overlooked by these brilliant types too, or do they feel as if some &#8220;collateral&#8221; damage is acceptable in order for them to reach their oh so important goal of creating a multicultural society?</p>
<p>If these same eggheads cross swords with the Animal Liberation Front they&rsquo;re going to come out losers because that&rsquo;s one group that is unafraid of going to jail over issuing paybacks to animal cruelty and abuse any way they have to to get their point across.</p>

			<p>Every time I read an article like this, the same question always arises in my mind: If Muslim immigrants to Western countries want their children to stay culturally Islamic, what are they doing in places like America? If Muslims want to stay Muslim, then by all means stay in Muslim nations and quit immigrating to secular nations.</p>

			<p>A lot of people are religious and practice their faith with dedication. But when a father kills a daughter or a brother kills a sister because of who she likes then Islam is truly a faith to be feared. Their is no defense against those willing, even eager, to die for what they believe. Reason or an appeal to simple humanity is useless. Muslims should never have been admitted to any western country. It is a terrible mistake with all manner of dire consequences yet to come. </p>

			<p>As long as they are only killing their own daughters, I&rsquo;m calling &#8220;no harm, no foul&#8221; here.  Their population growth rates in their own countries resembles the 1990s stock market.  Do we really want them doing that in our country?</p>
<p>That Egyptian is going to regret killing his daughters, however.  Murdering people in Texas is a very bad idea.</p>

			<p>&#8220;But while honor killings may be more prevalent in the Middle East, no longer are they unknown in the West.&#8221;</p>
<p>Using the phrase &#8220;honor killing&#8221; only gives undeserved dignity to this middle-eastern primal barbarity - it&rsquo;s child murder by a father who worries more about his pride in his own cultural circle than he values the life of his own daughter. </p>
<p>- Of course, in his culture, women don&rsquo;t seem to be worth much anyway, do they?</p>

<p><br>
Well, Rashid.  In America(that&rsquo;s where you live now idiot), we frown upon brutal murder, unlike that barbaric dust bowl you crawled out of to get here.  </p>
<p>If a white guy did this to his daughter, he would be considered clinically insane.</p>
<p>Just wait till the suicide bombings start in our cities, then people might realize what these &#8220;muslims&#8221; really believe in. </p>

			<p>I use to think that having tougher laws with Muslim behavior in mind was needed, but now I doubt they would do that much good. It cannot protect the women of Muslim families. If they try to break away from the oppressive insanity they live under their husbands or fathers will too often just kill them as apostates – as Muhammad himself called for – and remove the shame in their insane minds. Such Muslims will do whatever monstrous thing they think their religion requires of them and they don&rsquo;t care much that they get caught and punished, Allah will protect and/or reward them. That this population of crazies is on the rise is not a little scary.  </p>

			<p>The &#8220;bright spot&#8221; in having Honor Killings come to the United States is that it really makes our Open Border Liberals look like the utter fools they really are. But then the liberals never stopped to think (thinking to them is a bit of an alien notion, anyway), about the types of third-world trash they&rsquo;re inviting.</p>

<p>I believe this murderer is back home in Egypt, and now free of ever being charged with anything since this is not a crime (technically) in these barbaric Muslim countries.</p>

			<p>It should be obvious to anyone with an ounce of common sense and a cursory understanding of world history that cultures are not all compatible.  The only cultures that are compatible in America are European and to a lesser extent non-communist Oriental&hellip;</p>

Well is it or isn&rsquo;t it?  It&rsquo;s &#8220;accepted&#8221; but it&rsquo;s &#8220;not sanctioned&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Do note the sly ambiguation here.  Everyone sidesteps the blame or any personal responsibility.  When Moslems perform these barbarities  <i>in the name of their religion,  </i>the &#8220;authorities&#8221; then turn around and deny that it is condoned by the religion.  But it is widely done in the name of the religion,  <i>anyway!  </i>  So who is responsible for the practice?   No one?  </p>
