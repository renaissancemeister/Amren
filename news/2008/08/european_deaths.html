						<p>Deaths are expected to outnumber births in the European Union from 2015 when migration will become the only source of population growth, according to an EU report released Tuesday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the near-term, the number of EU citizens in the 27-nation bloc will swell from today&rsquo;s 495 million to 521 million in 2035. But after that it will shrink back gradually to 506 million in 2060, according to the EU&rsquo;s statistics agency.</p>
<p>Many more people will live longer, with those aged 80 or over almost tripling in number from 22 million now to 61 million in 2060, Eurostat predicts.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>By 2060, Britain will overtake Germany and France to become the European Union&rsquo;s most populous state, increasing by a quarter to 77 million.</p>
<p>Germany will shrink to 71 million while France will grow to 72 million, Italy to 59 million and Spain to 52 million.</p>
<p>Ireland &mdash; which currently has Europe&rsquo;s second highest birth rate after France &mdash; will grow by half, while Cyprus, one of the EU&rsquo;s smallest states, will expand by three quarters.</p>
<p>Some eastern European states will see their populations fall dramatically. Bulgaria will drop by 28 percent, Latvia by 26 percent, Lithuania by 24 percent, Romania by 21 percent and Poland by 18 percent, Eurostat forecasts.</p>

<p>These press releases exist to condition the masses to the underlying message, that sovereignty is a notion of the past.</p>

			<p>They are trying to make a case for more immigration.  But what they ought to be doing is make those would be immigrants stay home and reduce their populations there.  With overall populations reducing worldwide, the human race in general might have a chance to survive.  But it definately won&rsquo;t at the present world population growth rate - no matter what color they are.</p>

			<p><i>Deaths are expected to outnumber births in the European Union from 2015 when migration will become the only source of population growth, according to an EU report released Tuesday.</i> </p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t that statistic shout to everyone that they had better  get busy and do something to start encouraging more European births, and stop relying helplessly on endless streams of immigrants?</p>
<p><i>Britain will overtake Germany and France to become the European Union&rsquo;s most populous state, increasing by a quarter to 77 million.  </i></p>
<p>England is already one of the world&rsquo;s most densely populated pieces of real estate, and the useable parts of Scotland are extremely dense too.  Where are they going to put all those additional people on that little island?  How are they going to house, employ. and feed them?   It will become like Bangla Desh! </p>
<p><i>Ireland ..currently has Europe&rsquo;s second highest birth rate after France  &mdash; </i></p>
<p>That statistic is highly misleading, as the births in France (from what I can see) are overwhelmingly of Africans and Arabs, not French.  </p>

			<p>Why do people assume that a loss of population is, in and of itself, a problem?  It&rsquo;s only a problem for the banking/commercial people who need a large and growing population of consumers.  However, if a declining population of whites were allowed to remain the dominant ethnicity without the influx of huge numbers of nonwhites replacing them, there would be no problem.  Would I rather live in a Germany of 80 million ethnic Germans or half that many?  Given it&rsquo;s size, a Germany of 40 million ethnic Germans would be quite pleasant.  A Germany of 80 million of whom half are minorities is a nightmare.</p>

			<p>Fewer people in Holland would be a good thing if they had not let in 1 million fast breeding muslims.  You can see the future by watching the elementary schools let out.  The European political elite did what neither Stalin nor Hitler could.  Europe is gone.  Visit now before all the cities look like Detroit or Kabul.</p>

			<p>How can &#8216;deaths outnumber births&rsquo; from 2015 and yet &#8216;population will continue to rise until 2035&rsquo;?<br>
The answer is, of course, that ALL growth is due to immigration or more technically speaking a &#8216;differential growth rate of distinctive, extraneous ethnic groups&rsquo;.<br>
Mathematically, what that mouth-full actually means is that the &#8216;distinctive ethnic groups&rsquo; will, inevtiably, form the majority population.</p>

  &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;   <br>
Isn&rsquo;t it strange that those people who were so terribly worried about population growth in the Western World don&rsquo;t have even a peep to say about the population explosion  going on  in the Third World? </p>
<p>And while those same people scolded us for having &#8220;too many&#8221; babies, and that we were overpopulating the land, they now tell us that we need more immigrants  with absolutely no limit in sight.  It seems that our homelands have unlimited carrying capacity where immigrants are concerned &hellip;  just so long as they are non-white.</p>
<p>Something&rsquo;s fishy here.</p>

			<p>Germany&rsquo;s population will shrink to 71 million,,,,</p>
<p>So what? This is one million more then it was in 1914 when WW1 began. No one thought that Germany had a small population then and it had a considerably greater amount of territory. As for Britain the last thing it needs is a larger population. Say goodbye to some more of the beautiful British countryside. Europe&rsquo;s population has been subject to huge dips in the past and Europe always recovered (just so long as the population remained racially homogeneous). Look at the Bubonic plague in the middle ages. In just a few years a third of Europe&rsquo;s population was killed off but the continent eventually recovered. </p>

			<p><i>By 2015, immigration will be only source of population growth in Europe.</i></p>
<p>This is really sad. It sends this message to all Europeans who have taken care to not bear children that they could not afford (or for which there wasn&rsquo;t enough room to live and prosper): You are suckers. Only those who breed excessively and have as many kids as they biologically can will be the ultimate winners in this world controlled by forcess &#8220;progress&#8221; and &#8220;liberation&#8221;.</p>
<p>The likely next stage of that &#8220;progress&#8221;: rapists and womenizers will see their offspring soaring while everybody else&rsquo;s will decline.<br>

			<p>It&rsquo;s normal for populations to shrink, just as it&rsquo;s normal to have a baby boom once in awhile.<br>
What isn&rsquo;t normal is this insane belief that there must always be exponential growth, and where there isn&rsquo;t, every square inch must be filled with third world immigrants.</p>
<p>Population shrinkage is a good thing.  There are almost 7 billion people in the world- that&rsquo;s almost twice as many as it can realistically sustain.</p>
<p>In reference to the Bubonic plague; not only did Europe recover, but the plague was the catalyst for the Renaissance.  Less people, more concentrated wealth= more time and resources for the pursuit of science, arts, and empires.  It&rsquo;s an interesting phenomenon.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t fall for this &#8220;growth&#8221; scam. Something is, indeed, fishy here as well as Denmark.</p>

			<p>Among whites in europe this is already happenning! All babies born in major european cities are non-white ethnic, as more white women in europe remain barren and enter the menopause the already low white birth rate will plummet faster! Europe&rsquo;s future is black and brown.  </p>

			<p>Countries like the UK and the Netherlands are some of the most densely populated in the world.  Without immigration, a moderate population decline would not be a bad thing.  </p>

<b>Germany&rsquo;s population will shrink to 71 million,,,,</b></p>
<p>&#8220;So what?  This is one million more then it was in 1914 when WW1 began.&#8221;<br>
Posted at 8:19AM<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.<br>
Poster at 8:19AM   &mdash;     Thank you.  Very interesting.  Frankly, I was a little skeptical about your figures, so I did some research and checked them out.  You are right!   And Germany had only 56 million in 1900.  In addition, as you say, Germany occupied a much larger expanse then  than the area it does now.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re also correct in saying that  <i>&#8220;Europe&rsquo;s population has been subject to huge dips in the past and it always recovered.&#8221; </i>     As a striking example of this fact, here&rsquo;s another impressive statistic that I came across:   <i>&#8220;During the Thirty Years War, the population of Württemberg  [the province around Stuttgart]  was  <b>reduced from 450,000 in 1620,  to just 100,000 in 1639.&#8221; </b></i>   Yet, left to its natural devices, the population, given time, always managed to recover.  Today, the city of Stuttgart alone has 600,000.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s analogous to a forest that has  been swept by a fire.  Within a few years, life will  return and the forest will regenerate itself.   But if you pave it over, the area will never sprout new trees again. <br>

			<p>Why don&rsquo;t Whites like to have sex anymore?  After all the trouble public schools have taken to make our women whores you&rsquo;d think our population would be growing.  Look at the Chinese.  They&rsquo;re not allowed to have more than one kid, but that doesn&rsquo;t stop &#8216;em.  A billion and a half and still growing.  Maybe the Catholics were right all along.  Don&rsquo;t waste your seed, or at least not too much more than you&rsquo;re willing to say a hail Mary for.</p>

			<p>The reason the third-world is impoverished is largely due to overpopulation.  Encouraging the same thing for the industrialized nations is idiotic.  </p>
<p>Western politicians want more people to tax and Western businessmen want more consumers and increasing numbers of workers competing for fewer jobs.  </p>
<p>These wretches are more than willing to destroy the West in the long term in pursuit of their short term profits&hellip;</p>

			<p>Why don&rsquo;t people in the West like to have sex any more? (At any rate, sex that leads to reproduction.)</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been brainwashed into thinking that sex is a purely recreational activity, with no necessary connection to childbirth (and national survival).</p>
<p>Essentially, normal people have been encouraged to adopt the same hedonistic, &#8220;if it feels good do it&#8221;, &#8220;take no thought for the morrow&#8221; attitude as male homosexuals (whose disconnection from reproduction makes them constitute a death culture). Society is therefore no longer Edmund Burke&rsquo;s compact between the dead, the living and the yet-to-be-born.</p>
<p>Gay rights have worked with feminism (i.e. institutional (normal) man-hating) to make marriage and reproduction a precarious (and often personally injurious) undertaking for indigenous men in the West, thus softening us up for take-over (and ultimate replacement) by hordes of third-world immigrants who have no such nonsense in their own cultures. (The silence of gay rights activists and feminists about the status of homosexuals and women in these cultures is deafening.)</p>
<p>None of this has happened by accident.</p>

			<p><i>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t Whites like to have sex anymore? &#8221; </i></p>
<p>They DO like to have sex.  They just don&rsquo;t like to have babies.</p>
<p>Sex is fun. Babies are expensive and annoying. </p>
<p>The two used to be inextricably connected.  With the arrival of the Pill, feminism, and abortion, the modern Western World has, for the first time ever, been able to separate sex from reproduction.  They have become two different things.  </p>
<p>And this is killing us.<br>

			<p>I am so sick and tired about hearing how whites the world over need to have more babies so that the unwanted parasitic dregs of the third-world don&rsquo;t outbreed us in our own countries and become the majorities.</p>
<p>The answer is not to engage the primitives in a breeding contest we can never win.  The answer is to drastically reduce the numbers of these unwanted parasitic dregs of the third-world using every means at our disposal.  Is this in any way unclear?   </p>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>It is unclear as to exactly how you propose to go about this. You&rsquo;ve left that unsaid.</p>
<p>Actually, however, it should not be necessary to do ANYTHING, if we would just learn to mind our own business. Let them continue to breed until they are like a swarm of insects crawling over each other. But in no case should we  feel compelled either to feed them over there, or to bring them over here. </p>
<p>Can you imagine the Chinese importing African famine victims and war orphans? It stretches the imagination.  </p>
<p>Furthermore, the disasters these African refugees are fleeing are generally calamities of their own making.  And they only promise to get worse, not better.<br>
