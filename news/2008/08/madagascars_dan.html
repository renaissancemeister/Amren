<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>The band, a cacophonous near harmony of tattered trumpets and elderly clarinets, has been has been playing for hours now.</p>
<p>The hilltop is crowded. The entire community has come to this spot, some distance from the village of Vatolaivy.</p>
<p>People talk and smile, many are drunk, most are dancing and a little distance away from the tomb two entrepreneurial women have set up a stall selling cigarettes and frozen yoghurt.</p>
<p>But it is the tomb itself that is the centre of attention.</p>
<p>Indeed it is for the occupants of the low, flat brick structure that these festivities are taking place.</p>
<p>Masons chip away, unsealing the small stone door.</p>
<p>Finally, the sepulchre is open. I am invited to enter with Roger, whose family are buried here.</p>
<p>Inside the air is dry, with a strong, almost spiced, graveyard scent.</p>
<p>On either side of the room are stone beds, and on them lie the bodies of Roger&rsquo;s parents and his grandparents, wrapped in yellowing cloth.</p>
<p><b>Turning of the Bones</b></p>
<p>He stands proudly amongst his ancestors, introducing me to them almost formally, patting each corpse lightly to identify it.</p>
<p>I emerge once more into the harsh sunlight. Behind me, one by one and with great care, the bodies are carried out of the tomb and laid upon the ground, cradled gently by their relatives.</p>
<p>The rest of the village crowd around, spectators to this piece of family theatre.</p>
<p>At last even the band comes to a stumbling halt. A sort of silence descends.</p>
<p>One girl is holding her dead mother in her arms. She makes no noise but tears stream down her face.</p>
<p>This is the Malagasy tradition of famadihana, or the Turning of the Bones.</p>
<p>It is unique to the Indian Ocean island, a ritual carried out for centuries that may have had its roots in the culture and traditions of South East Asia, some 6,000km (3,728 miles) away, from whence Madagascar was first colonised.</p>
<p>For many outsiders the practice, which involves exhuming dead relatives, rewrapping them in fresh grave clothes and dancing with them around the tomb, can seem almost impossibly strange, ghoulish even.</p>
<p>But for the Malagasy, for whom ancestral worship remains important, it is an essential way of maintaining ties with the dead.</p>
<p>Jean Pierre, a family member, told me why famadihana mattered.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s important because it&rsquo;s our way of respecting the dead,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;It is also a chance for the whole family, from across the country, to come together.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>&lsquo;Act of love&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Anthropologist Professor Maurice Bloch, who has studied the ritual, says this idea of reunion, between the dead and the living and also the family land, is key.</p>
<p>It is an evocation of being together again, a transformation of sorts so that the dead can experience once more the joys of life. But, most importantly he says, at its heart, famadihana is an act of love.</p>
<p>But some oppose the practice. Certain urbanised Malagasy find the idea outdated and strange in the 21st Century.</p>
<p>There have also been clashes with Christianity. Early missionaries to the country tried to stop it and today increasing numbers of evangelical Christians are turning away from famadihana.</p>
<p>Perhaps surprisingly though, the Roman Catholic Church, the largest in the country, no longer opposes it.</p>
<p>For his part Jean Pierre stressed that in any case it is not a religious ceremony, but a tradition.</p>
<p><b>Tears to laughter</b></p>
<p>Back outside the tomb the family begins to tenderly rewrap the bodies with fresh cloth, called lambas, bought at great expense.</p>
<p>The mood lightens and the band strikes up once more.</p>
<p>The corpses are lifted onto shoulders, and with much laughing and jostling they are half carried, half danced around the tomb.</p>
<p>Every few steps with a whoop, the bearers lift them even higher.</p>
<p>I notice the girl who had been crying earlier is smiling and joking with the rest.</p>
<p>This is another transformation and another purpose of famadihana. To convert, almost forcibly, by the requirements of the ritual, grief into happiness.<br>

			<p>I was taught in college anthropology class not to be ethnocentric.  Today I can&rsquo;t believe I paid good money to be brainwashed like that.</p>

<p>Can&rsquo;t they just have a seance while someone fools them into thnking they&rsquo;re talking to dead relatives, so they don&rsquo;t have to go to so much time and trouble?  Afterwards they can slip away to the nearest bar, get smashed and pretend they&rsquo;re flying to the moon.</p>

			<p>Why blacks obsess over death is beyond me. There is voodoo in the Caribe imported from Africa and now this. Perhaps it is due to the short lifespan in their natural enviroment.  No matter- the West will of course accept this behavior as normal; in fact it will be desireable.</p>

			<p>No big deal here.</p>
<p>The ossuaries of Rome and other parts of Europe serve a similar purpose to remind us of our mortality.</p>
<p>It was common in the middle ages for men of letters to have a skull on ther desk top to daily remind them of their mortality.</p>
<p>The earth covered stone barrows of North West Europe held the bones of ancestors to signify ownership, through time and generations, of the land by its indiginous people.</p>
<p>Only in a world where being indiginous to a place and standing up for your lands and culture, like the BNP is doing in a Britain overun by third world immigrants, can the respect for your ancestors be seen as politically incorrect and therefore wrong. </p>

			<p>Not only is this practice ghoulish, but I should think it could very easily spread disease if the body is not finished decomposing. The article doesn&rsquo;t mention this possibility but of course no MSM article today is allowed to be judgmental about any nonwhite practice.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t see anything wrong with foreigners honoring their dead ancestors in their own way.  We seem to honor ours by allowing developers to build shopping malls on their graves.  </p>

			<p>I agree with Geoff M.  It really is not that strange.  More strange is modern American&rsquo;s disgust and aversion to anything having to do with death.  We are far too insulated from death for our own good and this is NOT the norm for Humans.  In some parts of Italy and in Sicily, it was common for families to visit their deceased ancestors: </p>

<p>When I was in Alexandria, Egypt, I visited the Roman era catacombs.  You can still see the benches, next to the tombs, where family would gather and eat in the presence of their ancestors.</p>

			<p>Meanwhile, they continue to slash the vaginal area and clitoris of their six year old daughters with filthy rusty razor blades in the name of culture. They even fly British born black children back to the evil depths of black africa to have &#8216;specialists&rsquo; carry out this rite to ensure the &#8216;purity&rsquo; of the girls on their wedding night and to guarantee the satisfaction of their husbands who insist on it. What a load of primitive black african tribal twaddle. </p>

			<p>Yorkshireman  &mdash;  these &#8220;dancers with the dead&#8221; are Malagasy; the clitoris-slicing Africans you&rsquo;re thinking of are either from the Muslim countries or countries adjacent to Muslim countries.</p>
<p>Culturally and linguistically, the Malagasy are from the South Pacific area, not Africa.</p>

			<p>To the tune of the &ldquo;Mr. Ed&rdquo; theme:</p>
<p>A corpse is a corpse, of course, of course<br>
And no one can waltz with a corpse, of course<br>
That is, of course, unless the corpse<br>
Is a Malagasy, dead!<br>

			<p>I agree with Schoolteacher and Geoff, that this practice is not that unusual nor is it &#8220;ghoulish&#8221;.  While I certainly don&rsquo;t care for it myself, I wouldn&rsquo;t get all worked about it either. I also want to reinforce Gloob who points out that the people of Magdagascar are entirely distinct from the blacks of Africa. There&rsquo;s no equating the two.</p>
