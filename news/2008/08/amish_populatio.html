<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-national/20080820/Thriving.Amish/">Amish Population Nearly Doubles in 16 Years</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, August 20, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Amish are expanding their presence in states far beyond Pennsylvania Dutch country as they search for affordable farmland to accommodate a population that has nearly doubled in the past 16 years, a new study found.</p>
<p>States such as Missouri, Kentucky and Minnesota have seen increases in their Amish populations of more than 130 percent. The Amish now number an estimated 227,000 nationwide, up from 123,000 in 1992, according to researchers from Elizabethtown College&rsquo;s Young Center for Anabaptist and Pietist Studies.</p>
<p>Over the same period, Amish settlements have been established in seven new states, putting them in at least 28 states from coast to coast. The new states are: Arkansas, Colorado, Maine, Mississippi, Nebraska, Washington and West Virginia.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Amish couples typically have five or more children. With more than four out of every five deciding in young adulthood to remain within the church, their population has grown steadily. More than half the population is under 21.</p>
<p>A small portion of the increase is also due to conversions to the faith.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As they move into new areas, some of the conflicts that occurred years earlier in established Amish settlements are playing out again, often involving issues such as building codes or waste treatment.</p>
<p>In Mayfield, Ky., an area into which a few hundred Amish have moved in recent years, nine men are fighting charges they operated horse-drawn buggies without the flashing lights or orange safety triangles that state law requires.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana continue to be the geographic center for the Amish, accounting for about two-thirds of the faith&rsquo;s population. They also accounted for more than half of the total population gain.</p>
<p>But eight states with at least 1,000 Amish residents had higher rates of growth, led by Kentucky, which saw its population jump 200 percent, from 2,835 to 8,505, the study found.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At least 350 Amish families migrated into Missouri, New York or Wisconsin between 2002 and 2007. Over the same period, about 520 families moved out of Ohio and some 470 left Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>&#8220;One family doesn&rsquo;t go &mdash; there is a group of them that goes, like two or three or four,&#8221; said Fannie Erb-Miller, national editor of The Budget, a weekly newspaper serving the Amish that is based in Sugarcreek, Ohio.</p>
<p>Once a settlement has six families and at least one minister, it qualifies to send The Budget dispatches about its activities, often with an invitation for others to join it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Ontario, Canada, the only Amish community outside the United States also is growing. It consists of about 4,500 people, up from 2,300 in 1992.</p>
