<p>Central and South Florida are increasingly becoming home to members of Puerto Rico&rsquo;s middle class, who are fed up by an island wracked by inflation, unemployment and the perception of crime grown out of control.</p>
<p>The recession that recently struck Florida hit Puerto Rico first. It resulted in masses of people moving to Florida as first-time voters in a presidential election year, banking that the Sunshine State would provide new opportunities.</p>
<p>Sociologists say the wave of emigration could rival the 1950s exodus to New York, which helped reshape Manhattan&rsquo;s political and social fabric. This time, the Puerto Ricans leaving the island are highly educated professionals whose departure both provides a safety valve to growing unemployment and threatens the island&rsquo;s skilled work force.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Census figures show at least 200,000 of Puerto Rico&rsquo;s 4 million people moved to Florida from 2000 to 2006, including 14,000 to Broward County and about 8,000 to Miami-Dade. About half of Florida&rsquo;s nearly 700,000 Puerto Ricans live in Central Florida, particularly the Orlando area.</p>
<p>But census figures do not reflect the wave that began two years ago, when a budget crisis forced the Puerto Rican government to shut down for several weeks. More than 70,000 people were temporarily furloughed, so it was not long before nurses, doctors and police officers joined the teachers and out-of-work public servants who headed for Florida.</p>
<p>Many of them found jobs before leaving Puerto Rico as recruiters from employers as varied as NASA, Disney World and the Baltimore Police Department went to Puerto Rico to find highly skilled bilingual labor. The shutdown was followed by an unprecedented increase in the sales tax to as high as 7 percent, which hit Puerto Rican wallets hard as a political crisis gripped the U.S. territory.</p>
<p>Then gas prices climbed, and people saw their electric bills reach as high as $1,000 a month. Government statistics show food prices have increased 12 percent this year, and housing 15 percent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Experts say it&rsquo;s impossible to know exactly how many Puerto Ricans have arrived in Florida in the past two years. But government estimates show some 65,000 are leaving the island each year, said political analyst Luis Davila Colon.</p>
<p>University of Puerto Rico professor Jorge Duany, who co-authored a 2006 study of Puerto Rican migration patterns, said the island&rsquo;s government has largely ignored the dilemma, because it offers a much-needed safety valve for an economy experts say shrank by 2 percent last year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Puerto Rican Chamber of Commerce President Jose Julian Alvarez said the island has seen at least 55,000 manufacturing jobs go away in the past eight years, just after losing federal subsidies for corporations. Puerto Rico Development Bank statistics show the labor force of 1.3 million people shrank by 47,000 people last year alone.</p>

			<p>Is there any room left in south Florida? I think it&rsquo;s called Cuba North now, isn&rsquo;t it? When this country has an Hispanic majority, we will look just like the places they fled. Get ready, because we have no one in sight who wants to stop it. Guess they don&rsquo;t care that their grandchildren will be fighting for land, air to breathe and a job.</p>

			<p>And just how much longer can this country be the &#8220;safety valve&#8221; of the world. And once they get here, they finally find their backbones and start &#8220;demanding.&#8221; Where was this backbone when they were in their native countries? Why didn&rsquo;t they demand change back there?</p>

			<p>Of course no one mentions the REAL reason Puerto Ricans are leaving the island (not to mention New York City).  Puerto Rican communities have been invaded by a horde of illegal aliens who can only speak spanish.  These people are violent criminals who wish America ill and despise Puerto Ricans.</p>
<p>Puerto Ricans are leaving the island and other &#8220;hispanic&#8221; communities for the same reasons whites left Detroit.  The thing is, whites, are too ethnocentric (perhaps, multiculturalist is a better term) to see the differences between Puerto Ricans and other hispanics nor to understand that Puerto Ricans are white and these other hispanics are black.  The exact same dynamics are going on here as do with those typically thought of as white and black.  The invaders despise Puerto Ricans BECAUSE they are WHITE.  That&rsquo;s pretty much the bottom line.</p>
<p>Tolerance of illegal aliens is resulting in the ethnic cleansing of Puerto Ricans from our communities.  Few people bother to notice.  But I guarantee you WILL notice as this becomes widespread along both the west and east coasts.</p>
<p>BTW&hellip;.this is the reason most voting &#8220;hispanics&#8221; are strongly anti-illegal immigrant, despite media LIES to the contrary.  Ilegals come to our country to rape, rob, murder, steal and deal drugs.  They do that in my community today.  Tomorrow, they do it in YOUR community.</p>

			<p>I am surprised there are any Puerto Ricans left in that place at all. I already knew there were more PR&rsquo;s living in NY then in PR. I guess the rest are now moving to Florida. It&rsquo;s unbelievable, this country is just bound and determined to empty entire countries of their populations. And of course the government of PR doesn&rsquo;t care because just like Mexico the US is a &#8220;safety valve&#8221; for their undesirable populations.</p>

			<p>1) Puerto Rico has fewer than 4 million people.<br>
2) Puerto Ricans have fertility similar to non-Hispanic whites.</p>
<p>Not a threat. At least, not nearly as much so as Mexicans.</p>
<p>The worst that will happen is that the island will have a collapsing economy and a collapsing population.</p>

			<p>Florida is already so swamped with Haitians and Cubans, can they afford a mass influx of Puerto Ricans? Why is it our countries most beautiful coastal states, which whites once called home, or idealic vactions spots, have been overtaken by foriegners? Florida and California, were once two of America jewels, and now they have been swarmed by immigrants. This is how it will be everywhere eventually I fear.</p>

			<p>If the U.S. hadn&rsquo;t so foolishly taken over P.R. in 1898 this wouldn&rsquo;t be happening. The U.S. should give P.R. its independence. I can&rsquo;t see any gain the U.S. has ever obtained from having it.</p>

			<p>Lets give Puerto Rico independence.  We gave back the Panama Canal, which had real value.  Other than to rich tax-avoiders what good is Puerto Rico to the USA?  None.  They vote every decade or so on &#8220;Statehood, Independence or Status Quo&#8221;.  But you need an invite to come to the statehood party.   How about a few citizen initatives in heartland states:  &#8220;Reseolved the State of Idaho urges the US Congress to negotiate full independence for Puerto Rico.&#8221;   </p>

			<p>&#8220;Puerto Ricans BECAUSE they are WHITE. That&rsquo;s pretty much the bottom line.&#8221;  </p>
<p>What in the HELL are you talking about?  Most Puerto Ricans are mulattoes.  They look like Moroccans.  Name one area of the US where they move to and make it better.  I&rsquo;m waiting.  </p>
<p>Everywhere they go, people aren&rsquo;t familiar with them and then hate them with a passion when they come in.  New York, Connecticut, Orlando, Kissimmee.  They are worse than blacks.</p>
<p>Atleast Mexico has some interesting features  &mdash;  cuisine, culture, architecture, native history etc.  Puerto Rico doesn&rsquo;t appeal to many in this way.  They are wannabe american blacks who speak pidgin Spanish and bilk our taxpayer dollars out of billions because they loiter and don&rsquo;t work while getting free housing vouchers and unemployment money.  Most of them end up RUINING nice neighborhoods forcing whites to leave and find housing in overpriced neighborhoods.  They ruin schools, loiter, rob, steal, murder at rates on par with blacks, because they are part black.  They want to be american blacks so badly and dress like them, act like them, play their music in their rice burning rimmed cars at nauseating levels, wear the baggy clothes, have the lame black man and female hairdos.  If you don&rsquo;t want cockroaches don&rsquo;t set out a welcome mat for them.  Ask anyone from the communities above whose had to actually interact with the typical Puerto Rican.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;The invaders despise Puerto Ricans BECAUSE they are WHITE.&#8221; </p>
<p>They may identify as White, but they are actually a mixture:<br>
&#8220;A 2002 study of Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of 800 Puerto Ricans found that 61.1% had Amerindian maternal mtDNA, 26.4% African, and 12.5% Caucasian.[61] Conversely, patrilineal input showed that 70% of all Puerto Rican males have inherited Y chromosome DNA from a male European ancestor, 20% from a male African ancestor, and fewer than 10% from a male Amerindian ancestor. This suggests that the largest components of the Puerto Rican genetic pool are European/Caucasian, Amerindian, and African, in descending order.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&ldquo;The invaders despise Puerto Ricans BECAUSE they are WHITE.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Anyone who lives near a lot of Puerto ricans knows that most aren&rsquo;t white. The following quote is from wikipedia- &#8220;In the most recent census in 2000 there were 3,406,178 Puerto Rican Americans, both native and foreign born and represented 9.6% of all Hispanics in the US. About 47.2% of Puerto Rican Americans identify themselves as being White, mostly of Spanish origin&#8221; PR&rsquo;s like Jennifer Lopez and rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-IL) clearly look mestizo while frankie muniz and kimberly guilfoyle (both half PR)look white. Puerto rico should&rsquo;ve been given independance years ago since a clear majority are non-white.</p>

<p>Some of the comments on this board seem to come from people who have never read a paragraph about Puerto Rico before they read this article. Americans were in Puerto Rico before Puerto Ricans were ever in the United States. Now that may not mean much to some of you, but I think it&rsquo;s valid to the issue. </p>
<p>There also seems to be some people here that are unaware that Puerto Ricans are United States citizens. Another relevant point I think. </p>

<p>The stupid white person in this case was William McKinley, whose Spanish-American War made Puerto Rico a US colony. (Also yellow journalist William Randolph Hearst, who agitated for the war.)</p>
<p>In fact, the PRs have been invading central Florida for at least 10 years now. Banco Popular, PR&rsquo;s main bank, now has branches in Orlando, and parts of the city might as well be suburbs of San Juan (along with much of Osceola County to the south). One of our top priorities after the breakup of the US must be to expel all PRs to their newly independent homeland.</p>

			<p>Puerto Rico was acquired as a result of the Spanish-American war in 1898. This war - totally avoidable - was the very first serious U.S. foreign policy mistake and was an historic break from the traditional path of staying out of other countries affairs as laid down by the founding fathers. All the territory obtained in this war was more trouble then it was worth. There was talk about making the Phillipinnes a state instead of leaving in 1948. Thankfully that didn&rsquo;t happen. The best thing to do with P.R. would be to give it its independence, whether it wanted it or not. </p>
