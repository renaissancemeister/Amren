<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>For anyone keeping score, the leader of the nation&rsquo;s 11th-largest city now faces 10 felony charges in two separate cases.</p>
<p>Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick was charged Friday with assaulting two investigators who were trying to deliver a subpoena to the mayor&rsquo;s friend last month. The two felony counts carry a maximum penalty of two years in prison or a fine of $2,000.</p>
<p>Kilpatrick spent Thursday night in jail after violating bond conditions in the other case against him. He is accused along with a former top aide of perjury and other charges over their testimony in a lawsuit.</p>
<p>The city charter says a felony conviction evicts him from office. The City Council already wants to bounce Kilpatrick on other grounds. And Gov. Jennifer Granholm, acting under a little-used state law, has scheduled a hearing for Sept. 3 that could lead to his removal for misconduct.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Since March, Kilpatrick and former Chief of Staff Christine Beatty have been charged with perjury, misconduct and obstruction of justice for their testimony in a lawsuit brought by a former deputy police chief who claimed he was illegally fired.</p>
<p>A key part of that case involved denials of an affair between Kilpatrick and Beatty. But text messages that became public earlier this year contradicted their denials and led to criminal charges. Arraignment is set for Thursday.</p>
<p>Brian White, a sheriff&rsquo;s detective and chief investigator in the case, said he was looking to serve a subpoena on Bobby Ferguson, a Kilpatrick ally, when he believed he had seen his truck outside a house July 24.</p>
<p>When he knocked, however, White said he instead found Kilpatrick rushing through the door, pushing the detective into his partner and yelling profanities and racist remarks. The mayor is black, and White is white.</p>
<p>The attorney general&rsquo;s office lists 11 witnesses in the case, including four members of the mayor&rsquo;s security detail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my almost 20 years, first as a prosecutor and now as an attorney general &hellip; I cannot recall ever seeing, let alone hearing, of a situation where a police officer trying to serve a subpoena was assaulted,&rdquo; Cox said. <br>

			<p>The governor will be forced to appoint someone else to be mayor until that time when Kwame has served out his prison term. Like Mayor Berry of Washington DC Kwame will certainly be reelected by the citizens of Detroit Also like Washington DC the governor will need appoint someone instead of allowing the citizens to elect someone worse than Kwame.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m more and more impressed with Michigan&rsquo;s AG, Mike Cox, each time his name is in the news.  He was for MCRI, he uses his office to deny drivers&rsquo; licenses to illegal aliens, and he shows some racial courage by clamping down on Double-K.  Next Governor of Michigan, or maybe a future U.S. Senator.  Mark me.</p>

			<p>I will admit there there have been many out of control White mayors, but this guy is REALLY OUT OF CONTROL!!!</p>
<p>He has absolutely no respect for the law and if anything, makes, seems to have contempt for law enforcement and the law in general.</p>
<p>He needs to be removed from office as soon as possible!</p>

			<p>My prediction is that first, Kwame Kilpatrick will never be convicted.  In a city that is 90% black, odds are slim that the prosecutors will be successful in convincing all 12 jurors to convict &#8221;The Nations First Hip-Hop Mayor&#8221;.  Jury nullification is virtually a given as soon as his defense attorneys begin arguing that this is yet another example of the system attempting to bring a powerful black man down.  Evidence be damned, they will never convict, and he will walk out of the courtroom, proclaiming his innocence all along. <br>
And secondly, when this defense is used and he is subsequently found not guilty, blacks will gravitate to him in record numbers, ensuring his re-election.  As Marion Barry, Ray &#8221;Chocolate City&#8221; Nagin, and others have taught us, never underestimate the power black elected officials wield by playing the race card.  Its worked before, and it will definitely work in 90% black Detroit.  The prosecution doesn&rsquo;t stand a chance in this city, against this mayor, and Kilpatrick knows it.</p>

<p>How is this guy Kilpatrick any different from his soul brothers like Mugabe, Kaunda, Nyerre, Amin, Sekou Toure, Omar Bashir, and Banda, on the mother continent?</p>
<p>Is this a preview of an Obama regime?</p>
<p>At least we&rsquo;ve got the Second Amendment.</p>
<p>To O&rsquo;banion:</p>
<p>Are you referring to the coal-black Sudanese refugee who carried in the U.S. flag? </p>
<p>When was the last time a Caucasian carried the U.S. flag in the opening ceremony? I pose this not as a trivia question knowing the answer - I really want to know?</p>

			<p>Even though these are being prosecuted as separate cases, at his perjury sentencing the judge will probably be allowed to take into account Fitzpatrick&rsquo;s assault on the subpoena-server.  This is called &#8220;relevant conduct&#8221;.</p>

			<p>I like K&rsquo;s excuse that he left the city against court&rsquo;s order in order to sell Detroit&rsquo;s half of the tunnel under the Detroit River to Windsor Ontario. He should have thrown in the city of Detroit in the deal. Ceding Detroit to Canada would save the State of Michigan and the Feds billions in subsidies and law enforcement costs. The Canadians can also take custody of all the thousands of &#8220;Detroiters&#8221; who are in state and federal prisons. And the Canucks get the Detroit Lions in the bargain!</p>

set things straight. Detroit will become modeled on a true African village, the remaining white industries will be confiscated by black freedom fighters. A 649lb black  African <br>
Super Mamma will be brought in to tell &#8220;all her chilluns&#8221; that the White Devil be to blame and Reparations are the only justice. The first act of The Black Revolution will be to loot and burn all the liquor store&hellip;because thats what we do. White liberals <br>
will fly over the city dropping money to a minimun depth of 12 inches. Drug dealers will do a booming business. Cracked out and full of stolen Colt 45 the &#8220;revolutionaries&#8221; will pass out.<br>
By Monday things will be right back where they started.</p>

			<p>Kilpatrick is just another example of &#8220;blacks in charge&#8221;.  The truest words that I have ever heard are &#8220;you can take the blacks out of the jungle, but you can&rsquo;t take the jungle out of the blacks&#8221;,  and they all prove these words are the absolute truth  time and time again.  The fact that we are even considering electing one for President of the U.S.A. is beyond the bounds of sanity.       </p>

			<p>He&rsquo;s a huge embarrassment to Michigan.  He has consistantly used the race card to explain his myriad troubles, even used it during his &#8220;state of the city&#8221; address.  He knows that idiot Detroiters will turn a blind eye because of the &#8220;evil white man&#8221; trying to bring him down.  He&rsquo;s know&rsquo;s he&rsquo;ll be found not guilty if he ever did go to trial.</p>

			<p>Cop (above) is right on the money.  </p>
<p>Kwamee will reach hero status after these legal ramblings are over.  He will cry about the &#8220;racist system&#8221; that has persecuted him, and the black Detroit legions will bow in his presence. </p>
<p>Any reader here should keep in mind that the majority of blacks think the opposite of whites, i.e., embrace a criminal instead of rejecting him (or her). </p>
<p>Detroit is a very dangerous and filthy city built on hate and resentment. For the past 40 years it has had a profoundly socialist city council. It has it&rsquo;s showcase areas, financed by wealthy whites and taxpayers, for downtown visitors, but even there, you will be a crime statistic in a very short time.</p>
<p>Brutha Kwamee is about to cash in and that, big time.  The citizens of Detroit, which is to say, black people, blame every woe in life on whites and thus are very self-destructive. Well over 70% of them live on some kind of government welfare. </p>
<p>Like most all blacks, they play &#8220;follow the loser&#8221; with wreckless abandon. Yep, Kwamee is about to reach hero status, and he will most certainly be re-elected.  </p>

<p>Nah the next stop for Detroit is disbanding for ever. It is pretty remarkable that any city can lose population in this day in age, with millions of new Americans wading across the Rio Grande every year, but some how Detroit has managed to lose over 50 percent of their population, and pretty much close to 100 percent of their economically productive citizens, thus destroying their economy for ever.</p>
<p>Sure their Hip Hop Maya can pawn off their tunnels and bridges and all other tangible assets to the Canadians, which is what he was supposedly doing when he violated the terms of his bond. But a year or two from now when everything that can be sold has been sold, and the State is tired of bailing them out then what?</p>
<p>Michigan should revoke Detroit&rsquo;s city Charter and let the great blight known as Detroit go back to the wilds. They should load up the population on buses and ship them to the liberal do gooders in Minnesota, I hear they take in lots of Africans these days.</p>

			<p>For manty, I&rsquo;d say just most, Whites, getting into trouble with the Law is traumatic.  The whole thing.  I remember as a boy I was caught stealing, went to the town jail, and my mother had to come and get me. My friend and I were terrified and the cops were jerks, but their attempts to scare us worked.  I didn&rsquo;t do that again. Though that was nothing compared to how sad my Mom was. Sad and disappointed. That was FAR more effective than if she was angry and hit me. Oh, the guilt. And well, because I was guilty.  I did something I was not supposed to do.  <br>
The experience turned my life around and I was only 13.</p>
<p>But for Blacks.  The Jail is an extension of their living room.</p>

<p>True.  But what else can they do?  Their only alternative is to admit their failures and inadequacies and search for ways to work hard and find some kind of niche in society, and that&rsquo;s much too difficult for any of them.   </p>

			<p>When will the egalitarians learn? Dressing up someone like Kilpatrick in a suit and tie and passing him off as a responsible member of society and as an equal is a waste of time. The endless charade of affirmative action simply does not work.</p>
<p>After prison, he needs to be sent to an environment that is more suitable for his demenaor, level of intelligence, and lack of civility. The home of his ancestors, Africa, is probably a good place for him to live.</p>

			<p>Precisely the same dynamic is at play here (between the mayor and his constituency, and vice versa) that set in place the circumstances leading to the situation in Zimbabwe. For blacks supporting, and ignoring evidence against, such leaders because they are black is NOT the buttering of one&rsquo;s toast on the correct side!</p>

			<p>I heard Obama speaking in a sound clip on the radio a couple of days ago, pledging allegiance to Kilpatrick, wishing him well and that he beats the rap(I&rsquo;m paraphrasing), assuring us all that Kwame is innocent, and vowing his support and looking forward to &#8220;collaborating&#8221; with Kilpatrick in the future for a long time to come.</p>
<p>I am somewhat resigned to the idea that we are basically screwed. </p>

<p>I find it hard to believe that you freely mentioned to a Black co-worker that another Black person is a thief and they simply agreed with you.</p>
<p>Some of you posters come up with some very amusing (though very skeptical)stories.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s absolutely amazing that Obama can be so blatantly pro black even with the black criminals and still be supported by some whites.  Are there any greater fools in the world than a gullible white?  I think not.</p>
<p>During a Q&A; a few days ago, a black asked Obama why he wasn&rsquo;t speaking out to help the black man against exploitation and oppression in this country.  </p>
<p>Amazing, isn&rsquo;t it?  Having advantages over every other race here, they have the gall to speak of exploitation and oppression.  No matter what, the whining will never stop.  Never!  Not until we can rid ourselves of these evil people.</p>
<p>Obama answered that he is speaking out against those injustices, but he&rsquo;s doing it a different way than what the questioner wants him to.  </p>
<p>Does his answer reveal a hidden agenda?  Pro black motivations for wanting the office of president?  </p>
<p>The answer, of course, is that &#8220;yes&#8221; his entire reasons for promoting ANY position is because it empowers blacks someway.  To hell with anyone not black.  He wants to be a black president for black people.  Period.  Case closed.</p>
<p>All whites are screwed because of white gullible traitors who are too ignorant to understand the ramifications of their actions.  Absolute fools.</p>
<p>If you want to read the absolute dumbest of what white fools have to say, go to the SPLC comments board.<br>

			<p>Kwame Kilpatrick is Obama&rsquo;s man in Detroit Motor City. He will be pardoned and returned to office in America&rsquo;s leading ghetto if Obama is elected. </p>
