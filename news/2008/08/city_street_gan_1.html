<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>
							More than half of Ottawa&rsquo;s 600 confirmed street gang members were born outside of Canada, according to Ottawa police intelligence.
						</p>
						<p>
							In a report published in the RCMP Gazette magazine, Ottawa police Staff Sgt. Mike Callaghan of the guns and gang section said that 314 of the city&rsquo;s 600 confirmed gang members were born outside the country.
						</p>
						<p>
							And the membership of Ottawa&rsquo;s two &ldquo;predominant&rdquo; gangs &mdash; the West Side Bloods and the Ledbury Banff Crips &mdash; is made up of 57 different nationalities, according to the report.
						</p>
						<p>
							The police intelligence is based on data collected in January 2006, although a report on the state of Ottawa&rsquo;s street gangs commissioned by Crime Prevention Ottawa and released this year found that the number of confirmed gang members in the city remained roughly the same as earlier statistics.
						</p>
						<p>
							According to Staff Sgt. Callaghan&rsquo;s report, 95 per cent of Ottawa&rsquo;s gang members are male &mdash; only 30 female gang members have been identified &mdash; with an average age of 17 to 25 years.
						</p>
						<p>
							Only 56 confirmed gang members were under 18, although recent reports have suggested a trend of street gangs using children as young as eight to sell drugs or run guns because they are immune from prosecution.
						</p>
						<p>
							The demographics of Ottawa&rsquo;s 19 confirmed street gangs are emerging as Ottawa police hailed the deportation of two alleged members of the Ledbury Banff Crips to their home countries as a positive development, sending a strong message to current and would-be gangsters that their stay in Canada could be in jeopardy if they get involved in organized crime.
						</p>
						<p>
							Remy Maliragora, 27, was deported to Rwanda last week following convictions for crimes ranging from assault causing bodily harm to robbery and forcible entry, while 23-year-old Sharmarke Ali was deported in January.
						</p>
						<p>
							While Mr. Maliragora remained adamant he was not a member of the gang, evidence presented to an immigration and refugee board hearing suggested he frequently wore gang colours and was involved in a robbery where the victims were told &ldquo;not to f&mdash; with the Crips.&rdquo;
						</p>
						<p>
							During Mr. Maliragora&rsquo;s immigration hearing, the former head of the Ottawa police gang section, Sgt. John Medeiros, testified that the Ledbury Banff Crips were formed in 1999 and consist of between 70 and 100 members.
						</p>
						<p>
							The gang has a &ldquo;corporate identity,&rdquo; including territory, leadership and a &ldquo;loose hierarchical structure&rdquo; with &ldquo;original gangsters&rdquo; at the top and ordinary members below.
						</p>
						<p>
							Sgt. Medeiros told the hearing that members of the Ledbury Banff Crips typically wore dark blue bandannas, although one senior member told him that the gang also wears black bandannas when they go on &ldquo;special missions.&rdquo;
						</p>
						<p>
							Ottawa police Sgt. Anthony Costantini of the guns and gangs section said yesterday that the West Side Bloods have a similar-sized membership as their rivals, and were formed in the early part of this decade sometime after the creation of the Ledbury Banff Crips.
						</p>
						<p>
							Sgt. Costantini said police are noticing new trends emerging in Ottawa&rsquo;s street gangs, particularly in terms of how they are formed and the breakdown of traditional cultural-based allegiances in favour of ties based on the neighbourhoods where they live and operate.
						</p>
						<p>
							This hybridization of Ottawa&rsquo;s street gangs is leading individuals from a wide array of cultural backgrounds to work together to further their criminal enterprises, which revolve predominantly around the sale of crack cocaine, Sgt. Costantini said.
						</p>
						<p>
							&ldquo;The downside for them is less loyalty,&rdquo; he said, adding the result has been some violent internal rivalries.
						</p>
						<p>
							&ldquo;With less loyalty you get fewer Bloods versus Crips and more Blood versus Blood or Crip versus Crip things,&rdquo; said Sgt. Costantini.
						</p>
						<p>
							Sgt. Costantini said police rarely see violence between the two gangs, who largely respect each other&rsquo;s turf.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Ledbury Banff Crips are based predominantly in neighbourhoods in the south and east sides of the city, including Overbrook and the Heatherington, Heron, Walkley and Russell roads areas.
						</p>
						<p>
							The West Side Bloods operate in areas around Ritchie Street, Ramsey Crescent and Grenon and Carling avenues.
						</p>
						<p>
							&ldquo;They stay in their own areas,&rdquo; said Sgt. Costantini.
						</p>
						<p>
							However, unlike other organized crime groups, like the Hells Angels, the membership and leadership in Ottawa gangs is &ldquo;fluid&rdquo; and doesn&rsquo;t involve junior members financing more senior members.
						</p>
						<p>
							&ldquo;If you are selling drugs for the Bloods, it doesn&rsquo;t go up the food chain,&rdquo; he said.
						</p>
						<p>
							Sgt. Costantini said bandannas are still worn by Ottawa gang members, although they have been replaced by athletic clothing featuring the logos of sports teams. Often gang members will wear team colours that are similar to their gang colours.
						</p>
						<p>
							He added that less than two per cent of the graffiti in Ottawa is gang-related.
						</p>
						<p>
							&ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t read it, it is not gang stuff,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They want stuff to be seen.&rdquo;<br />

							I remember landing in Montreal Canada, in 1967, on the way to Frankfurt Germany, from Los Angeles International airport. I know the subject is gangs in Ottowa, but what struck me at the time, even though I was a teenager, was the cleanliness of the place. It seemed like the kind of place you could walk a dog at any hours of the day or night and not have a care in the world. What has happened to the Western World is largely the fault of the citizens of the Western World. The signs were everywhere for years and years, that Western Nations had many communists and traitors within them. They were not dealt with then, and now it might be too late.

							In these official reports, (and I&rsquo;m surprised this one didn&rsquo;t do this), they&rsquo;ll overdramatize the number of white gang members, by using flimsy estimation methods.
						</p>
						<p>
							I remember when I was going through the St. Louis City Police Department&rsquo;s volunteer citizen academy, we had a Major speak to us about gangs in the city. He passed out a ten-page handout describing them, and the handout used a whole page to talk about white gang members. It took them a whole page to say that there were virtually none, but they had to term paper like fluff out an entire page to do so in order to make it appear that they&rsquo;re not picking on blacks.

							Why didn&rsquo;t the Canadians learn from the problems we&rsquo;ve had in the U.S. with Blacks before they decided it would be a good idea to let them in? <br />
							We&rsquo;re diverse enough, eh?

							The redidents of Ottawa must fight the media, whom I&rsquo;m sure has a hand in all this. All of the white countries problems with multiculturalism is caused by the media. Multiculturalism is designed to dilute the white race, to make the world &#8220;ONE&#8221; in which every race looks like every other race.

							First, remember that foreign born does not represent the only immigrant members of these groups. It is highly likely that those who are not &#8220;foreign born&#8221; are in fact either first or second generation children of foreign born immigrants. Were these to be included in the percentages, the gangs of Ottawa would most likely be nearly 100% immigrant(i.e. the 1st of 2nd generation children of immigrants).
						</p>
						<p>
							I lived in Toronto for two years in the late 70&rsquo;s while in graduate school. It was, as one poster has remarked about Montreal in the late 60&rsquo;s, a very safe, very clean city. I lived on Bloor St., right in the middle of town and walked everywhere as I didn&rsquo;t have a car then. I was never once accosted or made to feel the slightest threat to my physical safety although walking alone often very late at night. I hear that things are much different now. Ottawa at that time was the same, only more quaint and smaller.
						</p>
						<p>
							The quote at the top supposedly demonstrating the resolve of the authorities to deport criminal immigrants is nothing short of a joke. Out of 600 known gang members they are successful in deporting 2 &mdash; and this is seen as a major victory of the forces of law and order. What is not mentioned, of course, is that while the prosecution and eventual deportation of these two criminal gang members was taking place the immigration authorities in Ottawa made sure that thousands of similar types were allowed into Canada in the service of the government&rsquo;s greatest social goal, i.e. diversity. This sounds very much like bailing water from the Titanic.
						</p>
						<p>
							It is very sad to see our neighbors to the north destroying their once beautiful country in the service of &#8220;diversity&#8221;, for diversity means everything which is not Canadian. Like the US, but with even more gusto, Canada is on the road to replacing its native white population with a society of alien third world thugs.

							&#8220;More than half of Ottawa&rsquo;s 600 confirmed street gang members were born outside of Canada, according to Ottawa police intelligence.&#8221;
						</p>
						<p>
							Looks like they are trying to insinuate that roughly half of the 600 gang members are white. If they were honest, the headline would read as follows: More than half of Ottawa&rsquo;s 600 confirmed street gang members were born outside of Canada. All are black or latino. The ramaing gang members were born in Canada. 99% ofthem are also black or latino.

							D.Andrews; What is most shocking is the fact that many Canadians still believe in the whole multicult/diversity pipe-dream, and the ones who know different will never admit it, mostly out of fear.

							I live in Ottawa and the change in the last few years has been dramatic. Blacks are now the largest group in Ottawa among the visible minorities. Almost all are from Africa or the Caribbean.
						</p>
						<p>
							What I notice the most is how the blacks and whites don&rsquo;t mix. If I go downtown to the Rideau Center shopping mall, I see blacks everywhere. If I go to a hardware store, I see nothing but whites. Self-segregation is the norm.
						</p>
						<p>
							The city uses various means to try to disperse blacks evenly around the city, such as locating subsidized housing in many far-flung neighborhoods. In spite of this, there are areas that whites would not want to live in, like Bayshore. White flight is already happening.
						</p>
						<p>
							The city is approaching the critical mass level where racial tensions are coming out in the open. The next few years are going to see the &#8216;Bronxification&rsquo; of Ottawa.
						</p>
						<p>
							It is sad, but the character of Ottawa has been destroyed. It is now like an American city, with a black underclass, an Asian population that keeps to itself, a Middle Eastern population that pursues its own agenda, and a white population that steps around all of them.<br />
