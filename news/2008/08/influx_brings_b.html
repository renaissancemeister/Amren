						<p>Police Commissioner David Chong has made a new addition to the department&rsquo;s wish-list: a Portuguese-speaking officer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just one sign of the changing demographics of this old suburb just north of New York City. Brazilians might constitute as much as 10 percent of Mount Vernon&rsquo;s 72,000 residents.</p>
<p>&#8220;We really want to have someone here who can speak that language, who can really relate to that community,&#8221; the commissioner said. &#8220;I would like a handful, but one would be a great start.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Most of the customers at Onda&rsquo;s Brazil, a hair salon, are Brazilian, but proprietor Marisela Concepcion is Puerto Rican and Dominican.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She feels Brazilian immigrants have improved the city, &#8220;with the shops and the restaurants, it gives a little bounce.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a spare office at the Brazilian Civic Center, executive director Ricardo Braxtor teaches English and encourages the local Brazilian community to join blood drives, school groups and soccer leagues.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to participate and give something before we ask for anything,&#8221; said the 46-year-old Sao Paulo native. &#8220;We want to change people&rsquo;s ideas of what immigrants are like.&#8221;</p>
<p>Braxtor praises the Police Department but says many Brazilians in Mount Vernon are in the country illegally and fear that an encounter with an officer could lead to deportation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&rsquo;re a victim of a crime, your immigration status is not going to come into play,&#8221; the commissioner said. &#8220;We are trying to overcome this lack of trust because it hurts the people.</p>

			<p>And the police commissioner&rsquo;s name is &#8220;Chong&#8221;. OK. Let Mt Vernon slide right into its neighbor the Bronx, a once proud community of European immigrants who made something of themselves. The Bronx then was ravaged by Latin Americans and Blacks.  Mt Vernon can join in the depravity of its neighbor.  Indeed, why should anyone understand anyone else in Mtvernon, if English is not the common language?  The Tower of Babel, ladies and Gentlemen, right in the USA, a few miles north of Times Sq.</p>

<p>What a coincidence. If you commit a crime, your immmigration status wont come into play most likely either. </p>

			<p>&#8220;if your a victim of crime, your immigration status(translation: if your a criminal)is not going to come into play,&#8221;the commissioner said.</p>
<p>Well, if that is what the commissioner said and has ordered the police to do, then the commissioner needs to be cited by a citizen, and a citizens arrest of the commissioner must be made. He is violating existing immigration law Section8, title 1325, which makes him guilty of aiding,and abetting,illegal foreign nationals and indeed hiding them. That is what the law says, and so Police Commissioner David Chong must be arrested and put on trial for gross negligence of his duty and willfull violation of existing immigration law.</p>
<p>These would be the consequences of his actions and every other public officials who do the same, if we had the law operating in the U.S. rather than the law being ignored and allowing a dangerous precedent.</p>

Now,&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re a victim of a crime, your immigration status is not going to come into play,&rdquo; the commissioner said. &ldquo;We are trying to overcome this lack of trust because it hurts the people.<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -<br>
 I&rsquo;m sick and tired of hearing this continually regurgitated Propoganda from jackasses like this &#8220;Chong.&#8221; That wouldn&rsquo;t be Tommy Chong, would it? Because it seems this braying idiot has smoked a few to many BALES of high-grade weed to be sane anymore.</p>
<p>Well I wish it were that simple, or funny. This is actually like listening to Joseph Geobbels, or Mao, or Stalin. The level of dishonesty is so brazen, it just breaks the meter. And parasites like this &#8220;public servant&#8221;  will just keep reciting these propogandistic lies until the destruction of all that is American, all that is Anglo, and all that is free, is complete. When we&rsquo;re a multiracial, war-torn dictatorship under one jackboot, Chong thinks he will have it good.<br>
  <br>
It&rsquo;s like these servants of drug lords, crooked businessmen and traitor politicians are all reading a SCRIPT.<br>
But of course, they ARE reading from a sanctioned script. Only a fool would believe otherwise.</p>
<p>What in the name of God is helpful about a profligate national and local policy that lets every illegal alien, businessperson, politician and top cop stomp all over the constitution, our laws, our sovreignty, and our future? <br>
How the hell does it benefit Americans to be crushed by 40 MILLION immigrants in twenty years? Who in this universe could say that America is better off with thousands of Latin American rapists, child molesters, drunk drivers, murderers and gang members preying on Americans? How many have died at their hands? Does &#8220;CHONG&#8221; know? He sure as hell doesn&rsquo;t care. He just wants his kickbacks, his bribes, and his cushy, extra-special retirement. <br>
I could not believe for one second that a police chief in such a position-or any politician-could advocate such policies as &#8220;sanctuary,&#8221; without being on the payroll of the drug cartels, and half a dozen other murderous organizations.<br>
Why can&rsquo;t we prosecute these criminal cops and politicians?</p>
<p>Would our Founding Fathers do anything but heartily agree with me?<br>

			<p> How difficult can this be? Teach them all to say you are under arrest in Portuguese. Problem solved. This is a frightening situation, how do these people come half way around the world and get into the country undetected?</p>

			<p>Hi</p>
<p>I speak from Brazil. There are so few Brazilians in the US it is not even worth mentioning it. Most are desperate people in search of better lives, just as the millions of Europeans who immigrated to what is now the US in the last 5 centuries. You should blame your government to have put an end to the &#8220;white policy&#8221; which controlled immigration to the US. As it has ended, &#8220;non whites&#8221; from all over the world will try to seek a better life in the US. The US is already a diverse country, it has Native Americans, African Americans, Mestizos, Philipinos, East Asians, Indians, and Europeans Americans (and a large fraction of the European Americans are not &#8220;pure&#8221;, to begin with). </p>

			<p>Aren&rsquo;t almost all Brazilians in this country, including illegals, middle-class and white, or nearly so?  In that case, their illegal problem is more comparable to that of Canadian and Irish illegals, both of whom have at times swelled to over half a million.  </p>
<p>In other words, it&rsquo;s not good, but neither is it the unmitigated disaster that is Mexican immigration.  (Indeed, we might prefer the average Brazilian illegal to the average Mexican <i>legal</i>!  After all, it <i>is</i> a form of &#8220;white flight&#8221;.)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit more difficult and costly to get here from the south of Brazil than it is to cross the Rio Grande, so there is a selection process going on.  Unlike with Canadians and Irish, there&rsquo;s a language difference, as the article makes plain.  But until recently, Brazilians in the US had almost always taken care to learn sufficient English before coming.  Anyway, Portuguese is much prettier than Spanish, and Brazilian music has been vastly superior to that of Hispanics (or Americans for that matter), at least for the last couple generations.  So there&rsquo;s less of a noise pollution problem with them!</p>
<p>Oh, and let&rsquo;s look at Brazil&rsquo;s own immigration policy over the years.  In addition to mother Portugal, their main sources have been Germany, northern Italy, Spain, Japan and the Christian Middle East.  Something like 98% of Brazilians are white, black or some mix thereof, with the rest mostly split between Japanese and aboriginal primtives.  In other words, almost all Brazilians could assimilate to traditional American norms, be they white or black.  There&rsquo;s no comparison with Aztlan.</p>

<p>There are obviously too many.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most are desperate people in search of better lives, &hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Why are we obliged to be Welfare and Employment Agency to the World? Why is Brazil incapable of providing &#8220;better lives&#8221; for its own people (this is a rhetorical question)?</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; just as the millions of Europeans who immigrated to what is now the US in the last 5 centuries.&#8221;</p>
<p>A typical logical flaw. A emigrates to the US. B emigrates to the US. Therefore A and B are alike in all respects. This kind of thing wouldn&rsquo;t pass muster in an introductory course in logic, yet we see exactly this argument ad nauseam on these boards.</p>

			<p>A few years ago, I bought a new digital watch.  The instruction manual, which stated that it was meant for USA/Canada distribution, was written in nine different languages.  Portuguese was one of them, and I talked to someone knowledgeable on the subject, who informed me that NYC has enclaves of Brazilians.</p>

			<p>Minorities always have interesting ways of describing what they bring to communities, with terms like flavor, spice, richness, or bounce. Yet once those neighborhoods become to flavorful, spicy, rich and bouncy. They look for more bland vanilla areas to swarm over.</p>

<p>Well, if you can pull it off, my hat is off to you.<br>
I give it a snowball&rsquo;s chance in hell. <br>
It&rsquo;s obvious to me that TOO MANY immigrants come here with no thought of contributing, only for handouts.</p>

Not always. I am 70 and can remember when it was regarded as a desirable suburb that people aspired to move to (in the 50s).  That was before it became a black suburb (perhaps New York&rsquo;s first?) and then slid downhill.</p>
