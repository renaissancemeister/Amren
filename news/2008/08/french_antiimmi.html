<h1><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSLB9480020080811">French Anti-Immigration Leader Sells HQ to Chinese</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Reuters, August 11, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>French anti-immigrant party the National Front is selling its historic headquarters to a Chinese university to raise much-needed cash, the veteran far-right party&rsquo;s leader Jean-Marie Le Pen was quoted as saying on Monday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The National Front has had some bank accounts frozen in disputes with creditors, and Le Pen had already auctioned off his bullet-proof car on eBay to raise money before agreeing to part with his old headquarters, nicknamed &#8220;the cruiseliner&#8221;.</p>
<p>The party had estimated the value of the imposing building, located by the river Seine in a smart Paris suburb, at 15 to 20 million euros ($22-$30 million) but Le Pen did not say how much the Chinese university would pay for it.<br>

			<p>Maybe they should sell all of France to the Chinese.  The French certainly can&rsquo;t manage themselves anymore, and the Chinese have more of a commitment to capitalism and economic growth.  And the Chinese have no sympathy for blacks or muslims.</p>

			<p>Good job Le Pen!  Since the French don&rsquo;t have a problem with immigration, help them out and bring more Third Worlders to them.  Revenge is absolutely best served cold.</p>
<p>Let them live with Sarkozy and his legacy.<br>

			<p>It&rsquo;s ironic that the FN named itself after the British National Front.  That party was growing rapidly in the 1970&rsquo;s, but was then decimated when the fraud Margaret Thatchter promised to stop immigration and stole most of the NF&rsquo;s support.  The same thing has happened to the Front National now with the fraud Sarkozy.  </p>

			<p>Rather than support a real French nationalist party, the cheese-eaters have chosen to accept the promises of a pseudo-Frenchman, Sarkozy, that he will deal with the Moslems and Blacks.  The French have abandoned their patriots, who are now forced to prostitute themselves to the Chinese to sustain their opposition to the invasion.  I am reminded of the question, &#8220;How many Frenchmen fought in the Resistance?  All of them, once the Germans were gone&#8221;.   If the Dark Forces are driven out of France, how many of these cowards will then falsely boast to their grandchildren that they once threw a rock at a mosque?  </p>

			<p>Have you people read that article entitled &#8220;China&rsquo;s All-Seeing Eye&#8221;, in the May 29, 2008, issue of Rolling Stone magazine, on pages 58-66, about the prototype high-tech police state city known as &#8220;Shenzhen&#8221;, which are being supplied spy technology from U.S. Defense Contractors?  After noticing this article it comes as no surprise that it was not until last night did I hear of on the news of the concern of Chinese spies in this country.  I read about the Chinese Communist Army in an issue of &#8220;Taking Aim&#8221; put out by what was then Militia Of Montana, about three years ago, before the Militia Of Montana proprietor got a heart attack!! I photocopied it and sent it out to government officials and showed it around, but people just commented &#8220;interesting&#8221; and I have the label of conspiracy theorist.</p>

			<p>Some Amreners may not understand that Le Pen has been all but bankrupted and the party placed in desperate straights by a long list of court cases and heavy fines. This is how your &#8220;democratic&#8221; opposition destroys you.</p>
<p>Le Pen recently was allowed to give a speech before the European Parliament. He was restricted to just four minutes. It is well worth viewing. Notice Sarkozy and the other listeners in the audience smirking and laughing, while he denounces them for destroying Europe.  This man, a prophet of Europe&rsquo;s doom, is being laughed at.<br>

			<p>Le Pen is France&rsquo;s Enoch Powell.  And he has been treated in the same manner.  Both men will be looked upon far more favorably in the future when it is too late, believe me.<br>

Joe at 6:34</p>
<p>Neither I, nor most of the posters here would suggest that America is full of heroes.  I would say that the more common view is that too many White Americans are weak, lazy, and ignorant, and all too willing to swallow the lies of the MSM.  No better than the French, for the most part.<br>
     We have a couple nationalist parties, the Constitution Party and the American Independent Party.  There may be others, and in some states the two parties may be united.<br>
     I was in the military on the losing side of the Viet Nam War, but I personally did no fighting.  If the predictions of many posters here are accurate, I may soon correct that deficiency in my resume.    </p>

<p>Sarkozy is disgraceful but the foolish French voted him in.  Le Pen is French, Sarkozy isn&rsquo;t.  I look at the fools mocking him in that clip with complete disgust.  It is deplorable how they treat the man so desparately trying to save them and France.<br>

&#8220;Sarkozy is disgraceful but the foolish French voted him in. Le Pen is French, Sarkozy isn&rsquo;t. &#8220;</p>
<p>I wonder what percentage of those &#8220;foolish French&#8221; voters are really and truly French?  (Of course, any such demographic statics would be illegal in France.)  France has received immigration for generations, to the point where the real French population is severely diluted (Sarkozy being an excellent example of this immigration). I suspect that the true &#8220;French&#8221; are already a minority in their own country. The rest, like Sarkozy, don&rsquo;t care. They are picking over the carcass of France, while LePen helplessly tries to prevent it. The rest of France is terrified of being called the awful &#8220;r&#8221; word and is convinced by the Sarkozy-loving media that Le Pen is a devil in human form. Hence, they voted for Sarkozy to be their &#8220;savior&#8221;, much like many Americans will vote for Obama as their new messiah.</p>

			<p>Well that is the irony of all ironies; The famous Le Pen selling his headquarters to the Chinese, who will establish a beach head for a Chinese colony in France.  This is a milestone in measuring the failure of the liklihood of White survival in Europe.</p>

			<p><i>&#8220;A much, much better scenario than the Muslims taking over ya think?&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. Probably.  It largely depends on WHO those Muslins are.</p>
<p>But the real question should be:  why must it come down to a choice between either/or?  Is Europe left with no other options?</p>
