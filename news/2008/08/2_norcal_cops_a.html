						<p>A pair of Northern California police officers could face up to 20 years in a Mexican prison after having been caught in Tijuana with firearms and about 6,000 rounds of ammunition.</p>
<p>The two officers, identified as Hermonegenes Llanos and Jorge Luis Matos, were arrested last Friday afternoon by Mexican authorities. Both are from the Monterey area.</p>
<p>Llanos is a patrol officer with the Soledad Police Department in Monterey County and an eight-year veteran of that department. His arrest was confirmed Wednesday by Soledad Police Chief Richard Cox, who said that an internal affairs investigation is already under way.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Matos was identified as a civilian police sergeant at the Presidio of Monterey, a U.S. Army installation that houses an Army garrison and the Defense Department&rsquo;s language institute.</p>
<p>U.S. consular officials in Tijuana, speaking on condition they not be identified due the sensitivity of the case, said the two officers could face a variety of charges, most of them involving the possession of weapons and equipment restricted under Mexican law to military use.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lauren Mack, a spokeswoman for U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, said Llanos and Matos were in custody at the La Mesa Penitentiary in Tijuana.</p>

<p>Oh&hellip;you mean like the unregistered select-fire rifles the Mexican Army used to hold a Border Patrol agent hostage briefly, within the U.S? </p>

<p>I see that these people are as dumb as they are corrupt. Who would risk 20 years in a Mexican prison for <i>anything</i>? There&rsquo;s nothing in this world that&rsquo;s worth that. </p>

			<p>They broke the law and should do the time for it. And when Mexicans break our laws, they should do the time for it too, but apparently our officials don&rsquo;t think so and let the Mexicans off free. Let&rsquo;s see if Jorge Boosh rushes to their aid like he did the convicted rapist/murderer up in Texas.</p>

			<p>Well, if they can&rsquo;t buy their way out of the predicament, they just might be returning to their home country for a long stay.</p>
<p>Regarding Mexico&rsquo;s law against firearm possession or ownership, isn&rsquo;t it logical that they have to keep the population defenseless?  I mean, if the people were armed, instead of just the army, police and drug gangs, does anybody doubt that there would be non-stop civil war down there 24/7?</p>
<p>A corrupt government could not exist if its citizens were armed.</p>

			<p>Hiring &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; to law enforcement without thorough investigation of their national allegiance (no benefit of doubt, please) is beyond naive. It&rsquo;s idiotic. It&rsquo;s worth remembering that a well-meaning, non-discriminating idiot is still an idiot. <br>

			<p>Good!  Hope they keep them there though not likely since Mexos prefer to save money and send them back.  USA does not need stupid men for safety.    V</p>

<p>Ahh, but that <i>is</i> the point of hiring &#8220;dumb&#8221; cops because that&rsquo;s a now a requirement according to <a href="https://www.badcopnews.com/2008/07/27/new-london-connecticut-wages-3-year-legal-battle-at-taxpayer-expense-to-hire-only-stupid-cops/" rel="nofollow"><br>

			<p>Three things are equally certain here: 1. These two were ratted out by someone in Mexico.  2.  It was not the first time they had done this.  3.  These guys are certifiably insane.  Monterey is beautiful, and law-enforcement pays pretty well.  Why risk throwing that away over a little extra money?</p>

			<p>Six thousand rounds of ammunition?  Sounds like these two birds were involved in some sort of illicit arms trading and simply assumed that, as is the case in the US, Mexican police would never arrest a &#8220;brother officer.&#8221;</p>

			<p>When you hire Third World people to be policemen, you get Third World policing.  What is so surprising about that?</p>
<p>Once our &#8220;puppet-masters&#8221; manage to saturate all governmental and law-enforcement agencies with the &#8220;Invaders,&#8221; then our time on this continent is over.  North America will be returned to the chaos and savagery of Africa and Central America.  We can already see this in Southern California, or any other American city where large numbers of Africans or Amerindians concentrate. Gone forever will the the quiet, law-abiding, technology- and culture-producing society that Europeans created.      </p>

			<p>we have a model of mexican justice in mexico, we all know how corrupt it is, from top to bottom, why do we expect them to behave any differently just because they get hired by american police depts.? just like the old saying goes, &#8220;you can take the mexican out of mexico,&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well I have to take issue with this statement. We in America are pretty well armed overall, and our government is as corrupt as any of the worst I have been associated with. And no arm chair denials will be accepted here either, it is the truth and everyone here on AR knows it to be true. And I would also add that when the two officers were apprehended in Mexico, why did they not just gun down the Mexican police like everyone else down there does to avoid jail time?</p>
