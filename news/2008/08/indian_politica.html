<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>A regional political party has threatened to attack stores in Mumbai that place English-language signs more prominently than ones in the local Marathi language or refuse to use Marathi signs.</p>
<p>The threats, which police are taking seriously, are the latest effort by right-wing parties to drum up regional pride in India&rsquo;s financial and entertainment capital. Mumbai attracts migrants from across India who speak scores of languages, most commonly English and Hindi.</p>
<p>Businesses from McDonald&rsquo;s to mom and pop stores have hastily changed their signs to avoid the wrath of political groups that have a history of violence.</p>
<p>Raj Thackeray, leader of the Maharashtra Reconstruction Party demanding the language changes, said shopkeepers could display signs in both languages but the Marathi signs had to be bigger.</p>
<p>The deadline for making changes was Thursday, but many retailers and trade groups have resisted the demands.</p>
<p>&#8220;People are insulting Marathi pride with smaller signs. We will not back down,&#8221; Raj Thackeray told cheering workers late Wednesday. &#8220;Traders can take this as a warning or a suggestion, it&rsquo;s up to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thackeray earlier this year called on his followers to beat up migrants from northern India, leading to a wave of attacks against taxi drivers and laborers.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, party activists distributed threatening leaflets and attacked several shops. Police have arrested more than 100 people in the attacks.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will not tolerate violence,&#8221; said K.L. Prasad, joint police commissioner. &#8220;Patrolling has increased in shopping areas to prevent vandalism.&#8221;</p>
<p>A 1961 law made it mandatory for stores to display the local script, but many stores have small Marathi signs that are dwarfed by English ones.</p>
<p>Another regional party, the Shiv Sena, recently made it mandatory for official documents to be written in Marathi, not English. The Shiv Sena has repeatedly threatened to attack institutions that failed to replace the city&rsquo;s old name of &lsquo;Bombay&rsquo; with Mumbai. They considered Bombay to be colonially tainted &mdash; it was a Portuguese derivation of &#8220;beautiful bay&#8221; &mdash; while Mumbai was taken from the Marathi name for a Hindu goddess.</p>
<p>But in many parts of Mumbai, English signs crowd out Marathi, and some shopkeepers refuse to change.</p>
<p>&#8220;We respect Marathi but why should we be forced to make big Marathi signs?&#8221; said Viren Shah, a clothing store owner. &#8220;Why should our businesses be attacked?&#8221;<br>

			<p>Now I have absolutely NO Regret whatsoever for yelling at indians for not assimilating.</p>
<p>I never liked them anyway.  People think they are harmless but ask all the AMERICAN Software Folks just how harmless these leaches are.</p>
<p>Is it fair to Americans they be laid off so that the wonderful, productive and harmless indians can have their jobs for half the pay and half the benefits? </p>
<p>By the way, how many of you really want their culture here?  Look up the indian who killed his family in CO (that part I don&rsquo;t care about) and set the apartment building on fire?  So much for the respect and concern for his &#8220;fellow&#8221; Americans who also lived in that building.</p>
<p>I can do without indians.  For me, they bring nothing of value to America.   </p>

			<p>Just look at what the east indians have done to their own country.</p>
<p>That is what is going to happen here too, although there will be a battle between chineese, muslims and east indians.</p>
<p>Look at those countries, how did they get that way, why do they all want to get out and come here?</p>
<p>We are truly doomed and we are on the slippery slope to extinction.</p>
<p>I believe my children who are in their 20&rsquo;s will be the last white generation.</p>

			<p>Ut-oh, diversity hits India? How does it feel now? How about you Indians stay in India and speak your own language, and we Americans will stay in America and speak English. Everybody should be happy then, except the big business and the Diversity Libtards.</p>

			<p>My parents are Indian, but I was born in the U.S., and I regularly read this site. Almost all the Indians I know here are productive and law-abiding. My wife is a doctor, and so is her sister. Poster #1, do you really think they are doing &#8220;nothing of value&#8221;?</p>
<p>The Indians here very rarely have children out of wedlock or ruin their lives with drugs. We are succeeding by following rules that the vast majority of whites used to follow. Now a full 25% of white births in the U.S. are illegitimate, and in the U.K. it&rsquo;s even higher. In my wife&rsquo;s office, two of the white women are raising their grandchildren because their drug-addicted daughters are unfit mothers.</p>
<p>Whites in the U.S. are reproducing slightly below replacement level, and those in Europe much below. Instead of worrying about that, politicians are more interested in normalizing homosexuality, with absurdities such as &#8220;gay marriage&#8221;. In India homosexuality is still illegal, being an &#8220;effective deterrent against paedophiles and those with sick minds&#8221; according to one official <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/storypage/storypage.aspx?sectionName=&amp;id=40fe5e90-56fc-4f88-89e3-d1eb1739fa0d&amp;&amp;Headline=Gays+have+no+legal+rights%" rel="nofollow">http://www.hindustantimes.com/storypage/storypage.aspx?sectionName=&id;=40fe5e90-56fc-4f88-89e3-d1eb1739fa0d&&Headline;=Gays+have+no+legal+rights%</a>  <br>
. Here is another issue where whites could learn from their supposed inferiors.</p>
<p>I do agree with others on AmRen that a country has the right to shape its immigration policies to preserve its identity, including its racial identity. I don&rsquo;t think mass immigration to the U.S. from India or other third world countries is a good idea. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a Republican because I don&rsquo;t<br>
(1) favor quotas for minorities, both on principle and because it hurts Asian Indian kids in college admisssions.<br>
(2) want more and more of my money taxed away and handed over to <br>
such people.</p>
<p>Does that sound familiar?<br>

The point here is that if You Indians are doing so much of value why can&rsquo;t you do it in your home country?Can&rsquo;t you be productive and law-abiding in your own country? The fact is if it weren&rsquo;t for western creative environment you were pulled into, you would have been where you were 300 years ago. In fact it is us who give you something of value which you go on utilizing.<br>

			<p>Indian guy at 7:45 AM: Reasons for objecting to Indian immigration-<br>
1. You&rsquo;re not us.  That&rsquo;s reason enough by itself.  You don&rsquo;t look like us, feel like us, or think like us.  Think of all the American hippie kids who went to India to get spiritualized, and who came home as clueless as they went.  (There&rsquo;s a book about that, &#8220;Karma Cola&#8221;)  I could never be a real Hindu, the cultural assumptions are too different and to many.  Leaving race aside for the moment, why should anyone believe that you can become one of us?  <br>
2. I grew up in a White country.  I like living in a White country.  Whites in this country had, at one time, almost entirely freed themselves from government tyranny, a rare feat historically.  My Rulers have decreed that I must live in a non-White country in order that my people and culture may be more easily diluted and then eradicated, so that we will all be dependent on and loyal to the State.  Whatever your personal feeling may be, you are an agent of the Rulers, a part of their plan to enslave us.  You are no more guilty, and no more innocent, than a soldier sent to serve in a colonial occupation.<br>
3. Indians in this country are becoming what is known to sociologists and economists as a &#8220;market dominant minority&#8221;.  You tend to work in certain fields and promote your own group&rsquo;s interests within that line of work.  As you get more numerous and more influential, your people will grasp ever more power and use it for your own, and India&rsquo;s, interests.  The rise of Indian political power is even written about in liberal newspapers, though they treat it as an innocuous phenomenon, just a little bit of assimilation.  However, White Americans are not the people that power-seeking Hindus model themselves on.  Indians are not alone in this behavior, but there&rsquo;s no reason that Whites should tolerate it from any minority.  <br>
4. No trace of the caste system should be allowed in this country.  A Hindu can say that he has rejected his culture all he wants, and I will no more believe it that I&rsquo;ll believe that liberals don&rsquo;t fear Blacks.  I have seen the change come over an Indian when they discover that, despite my weekend workingman&rsquo;s appearance, I am a schoolteacher.  They mentally assign me to a caste, and a teacher is a Brahmin&rsquo;s job, at least two castes up from my weekend and summer roles of roofer or carpenter.  <br>
5. To elaborate on #3, Indian technicians and scientists are Indian spies, just like the Chinese.  There&rsquo;s no reason to imagine that they aren&rsquo;t, in fact it&rsquo;s absurd to think that foreign governments don&rsquo;t take every possible advantage of our immigration laws.<br>
6. To elaborate on #1, I don&rsquo;t like Hindus coming here and suing Whites because they were accidentally served beef instead of chicken and have to go bathe in the Ganges river to regain their spiritual cleanliness.<br>
     Reasons enough?</p>

			<p>To Indian Guy,</p>
<p>I do believe Indians bring value.  I&rsquo;ve had good experiences with them and found them very hospitable, friendly and hard working. We went to a culture festival in Houston that was for India that year and went into an eating area where 95% of everyone there (huge crowd) was Indian.  I was astonished at how polite, friendly and considerate they were to us.  We actually support an Indian girl via charity. Of course here in the US, lots of Americans in the IT industry are suffering due to overseas workers, primarily Indian, hence the reaction.  Also, as a Euro-American, when you constantly see story after story that spells the end of our civilization, please take into account that it&rsquo;ll make some people quite edgy.</p>

			<p>Indian guy: if we had lower immigration rates and did not have multiculti, then it would not be an issue. But As you probably know many younger Indians in America are adapting identity politics, despite being well off and having high levels of education. There hostility towards whites, particularly Anglo-Saxons is growing - I have personally encountered it on a number of occasions and in many ways I find it even more disturbing than black hostility. </p>
<p>On this issue, I recall that an American faction of India&rsquo;s nationalist far right party - got California history books changed to reflect THEIR views of Indian history (the PC folks in CA capitulated, only to have Dalits complain that the far right (and high caste) indians were twisting the story) .</p>
<p>Most of us do not thing whites are &#8216;superior&rsquo; to East Asians or Indians, we just don&rsquo;t want to be made minorities in our lands, which, I think is human nature. PC and multiculturalism, of course are in defiance of human nature<br>

			<p>That&rsquo;s kind of funny, because, from what I understand many non-hindi speaking Indians (only about 30% speak hindi as a first language) prefer english because they don&rsquo;t like Hindi imposed on them (Tamil speakers in particular) </p>
<p>In my opinion, &#8220;India&#8221; won&rsquo;t last as a democracy much longer - it really isn&rsquo;t a country but a collection of countries - and so many different ethnic factions cannot be &#8216;held together&rsquo; without a strong central authority - </p>

			<p>If that political party wants to replace English with Marathi, I say fine, more power to them.</p>
<p>Britain is at the vanguard of White nations demographically and socially self-destructing today, right up there with the USA.  And a big reason for this is the British people&rsquo;s fatal nostalgia for the old British Empire, at least among the political class  &mdash;   this has led them to essentially offer free immigration to Britain from the Commonwealth nations, which has resulted in British cities rapidly becoming majority Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Indian.  In reality, the British Empire was never as large or as populous as is often believed  &mdash;   only portions of India, Pakistan, Somalia and other nations were under British control.  But far too many British aristocrats still fantasize about being globetrotting imperial officials in pith helmets.</p>
<p>The result?  Both the Labour and Conservative parties in Britain have allowed in countless millions of people from South Asia, Africa and the Middle East in the last two decades, resulting in a massive demographic change and a full-fledged invasion  &mdash;   by far the biggest since the Anglo-Saxon migrations of the 5th-century A.D.!  In 20 years, this demographic change will utterly destroy Britain, only a few years after the same process has destroyed the U.S.A.  This Marathi-language push is a good thing for everybody.  It will help to solidify the identity of Indians as Indians, without so much linkage to the British.  And in so doing, it&rsquo;ll help to reduce the level of outsourcing of tech jobs that is destroying the economies of the USA and UK.  Although unfortunately, it will still be too late to save Britain and the USA from self-inflicted disaster.</p>

			<p>Reply to Indian Guy;</p>
<p> Even if I am to accept at face value everything you say, why should I want to be displaced by people of another race, culture, religion, heritage and background? Did the British people (for just one example) ever ASK to be swamped by Asian foreigners? Why should the British people suffer the cruel fate of displacement? Why should they not resent it?</p>

			<p>2:54 p.m.: I used to work in India and you&rsquo;re right that only about 36-40% of Indians speak Hindi as a first language, particularly in the northern &#8220;Hindi belt,&#8221; but it is extremely widespread as a &#8220;general second language&#8221; especially in central and eastern India.  Hindi is the main media language, TV language and of course it&rsquo;s the big Bollywood movie language, and about 80% of India speaks it  &mdash;   over 800 million people, so it&rsquo;s actually one of the &#8220;big languages&#8221; of the world.  In southern Tamil-speaking India it&rsquo;s less prevalent, but in other parts of south India (Karnataka, Kerala) they have higher Hindi-speaking levels.  Even in Tamil Nadu, the younger generation tends to know some Hindi.  And they *do not* like English in the Tamil regions either  &mdash;   they hate any threat to their language, Hindi and English alike.  (Tamil Nadu was actually part of French India or independent, not as much a part of British India.)  Which is fine by me  &mdash;   India is an ancient country and it should have its own country and language, rather than having a few of its upper crust arrogantly speaking English as though they were aristocrats, and taking millions of jobs from Americans and Britons.</p>
<p>I agree with your general point though, I don&rsquo;t see India staying together  &mdash;   as you say, it&rsquo;s a collection of squabbling minorities, not a real nation.  The main fault lines are more religious and cultural than linguistic.  The Sikhs hate Hindus after the Golden Temple massacre that Indira Gandhi blundered into carrying out, and want to secede as &#8220;Khalistan.&#8221;  The Northeast of India is mostly Christian and ethnically distinct from India (the NE peoples are East Asian-looking and Christian), and there&rsquo;s an active, bloody insurgency in the NE in Nagaland and Mizoram that&rsquo;s even worse than Kashmir.  And of course, there&rsquo;s also Kashmir, plus Maoist insurgencies all over the place.  India just isn&rsquo;t set to stay together, and the fault lines are already beginning to pull the country apart.</p>

			<p>To the Indian guy.<br>
Your comment proves the urgency whith which we have to stop the tide of Indians into the West no matter how assimilated they appear, one only needs to read between the lines to see through you.<br>
1. You were born in the USA. You write &#8220;WE are succeeding by following rules that the vast majority of whites used to follow&#8221;. The &#8220;WE&#8221; is so obvious your true indentity is screaming!<br>
You are still an Indian not an American!<br>
2.I assume your wife is an Indian. Arranged and brought from India I assume. Far from the western civilized way of relating to women.<br>
3.Naturally your second generation children are, or will be Indians! Born in the USA! Weighed down by the same baggage you are.<br>
Not enough reasons?!</p>

			<p>Miroslav &#8220;But far too many British aristocrats still fantasize about being globetrotting imperial officials in pith helmets.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh please - why not throw in references umbrellas, bowler hats and cups of tea as well? Guilt and cultural Marxism are largely to blame - but &#8216;nostalgia&rsquo;?</p>
<p>A lot of water has passed under the bridge since the Empire was at its peak and, in any case, it wasn&rsquo;t run by the aristocracy.</p>

			<p>At a gas station near my home something very odd happened. One day, the Indians took over as they have many others. All the white employees and the black ones to were gone, replaced by Indians. They were putting Indian writing on the door. This happened right about the time that Fannie Mae was collapsing. The next day, the Indians were gone, the writing on the door was cleaned up, and the Americans were back. I suspect that the deal fell through when Fannie Mae collapsed. But my point is this: There was no need for these Indians to be here. The Americans were doing the job just fine. As soon as the Indians showed up, the Americans lost their jobs. They got them back when the Indians left. Otherwise they would have had to look elsewhere. So why are these Indians needed to do jobs that Americans were already doing? Incidently, We never did find out what actually happened whith this affair.</p>

<p> A thoughtful post. I would add a few points;</p>
<p>1) The British should jettison the commonwealth. It has neither purpose nor value. I can&rsquo;t see any good to it at all. </p>
<p>2) It was THE LABOUR PARTY not the Conservatives who turned Britain into a multi-racial stew. The first majority government they got they opened the floodgates. Of course, THEY NEVER TOLD the British people who elected them that they were going to do that.</p>

			<p>Before you comment negatively on what Indian guy wrote, you should read it.</p>
<p>He supports nations regulating their own immigration in order to maintin culture. What&rsquo;s to argue with that?</p>
<p>The problem in the US is not immigration per se, but an immigration policy that: (1) sets too high a limit; (2)doesn&rsquo;t attempt to differentiate between desirable and undesirable types; and (3) that doesn&rsquo;t expect immigrants to assimilate.<br>

    Some of the comments about India not being a nation<br>
    are completely flawed.  Indians have alot in common<br>
    with each other.  They definitely belong to the same <br>
    race (ie. Dark Cacausoid), have an overriding common <br>
    ancient culture and civilization (ie.Indian Vedic <br>
    civilization) that is indeed pan-Indian in nature.  <br>
    For millenias, Sanskrit (ie.Bharathiyam)was the official,<br>
    cultural, educational,spiritual and learned language of<br>
    the Indians.  They have the same heroes, basic Gods and <br>
    a common ancient Vedic History.  Also, the regional languages<br>
    are NOT the medium of culture and education.  They are <br>
    basically dialects that evolved only around 1200-1300AD. <br>

			<p>The ancient culture and civilization Indians keep parroting ad nauseam was not created by Indians but was destroyed by them. A species that created your so called ancient civilization in the land called India today were different from contemporary Indians in RACE,ANATOMY,BIOCHEMISTRY,PHYSIOLOGY,GENETICS AND PSYCHOLOGY.You just take a sober look at your &#8220;Indian&#8221; ancient scriptures called Vedas written in &#8220;Indian&#8221; language Sanskrit :<br>
With him too is this rain of his that comes like herds:Indra throws drops of moisture on his yellow beard.(Rig Veda,Indra 10.23.4)-cca 6000 years ago<br>
At the swift draught the Soma-drinker waxed in might, the Iron One with yellow beard and yellow hair. (Rig Veda,Indra 10.96.8)-cca 6000 years ago<br>
As years went by the place was being swamped by barbarians forcing the civilized ones to withdraw and build fortifications (gated communities in America of today)which was only a prelude to extinction.<br>

<p>As an Indian columnist, Vir Sanghvi, said in the Hindustan Times, &#8220;&hellip;if he&rsquo;s so keen on Marathi usage, then he should use his real name. It&rsquo;s Thakre not Thackeray, in the manner of William Makepeace Thackeray, the author of Vanity Fair. Not only does Thackeray use the anglicised spelling, he even pronounces it like the English author, who, as far as I know, was not a Marathi manoos.&#8221;</p>

			<p>India is not a nation.</p>
<p>India is an empire.</p>
<p>An ideal solution to India&rsquo;s civil unrest would be a UN-brokered plebiscite that would fragment the country.  If what used to be called &#8220;East Pakistan&#8221; had a right to become Bangladesh, then parts of India also have the right to secceed.</p>
<p>An ideal solution to US civil unrest would be much more difficult.  A realistic solution would involve the genocide we are not supposed to discuss here.  The US is not a nation anymore; it is an empire.</p>
<p>India&rsquo;s problem is easy to fix.  Look at a map of Europe.  Europeans have much more in common with each other than Indians, yet Europeans have fought the bloodiest wars in history against each other.  The map of Europe today looks like someone dropped Europe and broke it.  </p>
<p>If India had the right to become independant of the British Empire - the way the United States did, it has no right at all to export its people as colonists to other nations.</p>
<p>This may not pass the editor, but it will be read by someone, even if that is only one person.</p>

   This is for 10:10 am at Sept.2, </p>
<p>   That link you posted in your message doesn&rsquo;t say anything<br>
   about &#8220;Indians destroying civilization&#8221;.  All it mentions <br>
   is that a great city much bigger than classical Athens <br>
   apparently existed.  Also fortifications in a city are nothing<br>
   surprising since if an enemy were to attack, the population <br>
   may go into the fort temporarily to hold out against the <br>
   enemy.  Kings in ancient times as well as medieval times <br>
   had such defensive measures against rival kings.  That was<br>
   the case all over the world in those days.  Nothing out of<br>
   the blue!<br>

<p>     To both 10:10 and Michael Scott, </p>
<p>     No, both of you are wrong about India.  </p>
<p>     First to answer 10:10, if it wasn&rsquo;t for Indians who </p>
<p>     preserved the Vedic culture against all odds throughout <br>
    <br>
     the last millenium,  you whites wouldn&rsquo;t have even known<br>
   <br>
     such a culture even existed.  You learnt it basically <br>
   <br>
     from us, so your claim that &#8220;Indians destroyed Civilization&#8221;</p>
<p>     is very funny.  Sanskrit is Indian without a doubt.  No </p>
<p>     White race ever spoke this language historically.  Indians</p>
<p>     did definitely speak it and were the only ones who wrote </p>
<p>     and analyzed its Grammar (ie. Indian Grammarian Panini)and</p>
<p>     its dictionary, Amarakosha (ie. Indian Scholar Amarasimha).</p>
<p>     Give me a break,  I know exactly why you think the way you</p>
<p>     do.  You are assuming that some &#8220;Aryan Invasion&#8221; took place.</p>
<p>     LOL LOL.  Aryans were Indians only.  They were the Puru <br>
 <br>
     tribe of India.  They had nothing to do with Europeans.  </p>
<p>     Read this book if your brave enough to do so:   </p>

<p>     To Michael Scott, </p>
<p>     India is very much a nation in its own right.  </p>
<p>     Your problem is your understanding is purely based on </p>
<p>     European history and European models.  India&rsquo;s historical</p>
<p>     evolution and identity formation are completely different</p>
<p>     than what happened in Europe.  You can&rsquo;t compare the two.  </p>
<p>     Also, you are mistaken about Europeans having lots in common</p>
<p>     with each other.  Indians have way more in common with one</p>
<p>     another than Europeans do.  Indians share a common race, </p>
<p>     common collective history, common Civilizational culture <br>
  <br>
     rooted in the basic medium of Sanskrit(ie.Bharathiyam) iced</p>
<p>     with a broad and unique spiritual heritage!  Indian </p>
<p>     civilization is defined by the Indian language Sanskrit and<br>
    <br>
     its literature purely.  The regional languages are not the</p>
<p>     languages of our culture or identity.  They were just </p>
<p>     dialects that developed only in the last millenium.  By the</p>
<p>     time they developed,  already the millenias old Sanskritic</p>
<p>     culture had matured as THE Indian Culture.  Europe on the</p>
<p>     other hand never had a &#8220;Pan-European&#8221; civilizational/<br>
 <br>
     cultural language that could unite and generate an </p>
<p>     overriding European identity except perhaps a Racial </p>
<p>     one.  What you have in Europe is a series of well-developed</p>
<p>     languages that have become the basic cultural languages </p>
<p>     which have only sharpened the contradictions between </p>
<p>     Europeans which have led to numerous bloody wars in the </p>
<p>     past.<br>

<p>      Another reply to Michael Scott,  </p>
<p>      India is not the same as Pakistan.  You need to </p>
<p>      understand that.  Just because East Pakistan secceeded</p>
<p>      from West Pakistan,  doesn&rsquo;t mean that India should also</p>
<p>      be automatically subject to the same process.  Unlike </p>
<p>      India, Pakistan is not a country that has any historical</p>
<p>      basis even as an idea.  There is no such thing as Pakistani</p>
<p>      identity, culture or civilization even.   Pakistan is like</p>
<p>      a mini USSR, a country based only on a political ideology</p>
<p>      (ie.Islamism) for its raison d&rsquo;etre like how Soviet Union</p>
<p>      was based on Marxism!!.  Islam is not a culture or even</p>
<p>      religion but a political movement.  It pretends to be a </p>
<p>      religion but its not.  Its a political cult.  There is </p>
<p>      no real ethnic unrest, only political unrest in India.  </p>
<p>      There is absolutely no need for UN involvment for any </p>
<p>      reason whatsoever.  As Indians, we are damn proud of our</p>
<p>      country and will lay down our lives if need be to defend it</p>
<p>      all the way.  Sorry Mr. Scott if I sound a little rude </p>
<p>      but just back off!!!       </p>

   To 10:10 am at Sept.2,  </p>
<p>   Do you know the real reasons why India declined and has </p>
<p>   become a backward country today?  It is not because of any</p>
<p>   change in the race of Indians.  Indians are a very ancient </p>
<p>   people/race.  According to Genetic and Archaeological evidence</p>
<p>   Indians have been living in India for 60,000 years!  There </p>
<p>   was never any mass population replacement in India at any </p>
<p>   time in its history so the Indian Race has remained the </p>
<p>   same.  This same people gave birth to a rich Indian </p>
<p>   civilization(Vedic) as some of our above posters have </p>
<p>   mentioned.  Ancient Indians and present day Indians are the</p>
<p>   same people.  There is apparently a racial continuity.  So </p>
<p>   race cannot be the answer in this case.  A more likely </p>
<p>   reason would be that Indians have suffered a dislocation</p>
<p>   from their cultural roots due to the fact that they were</p>
<p>   fighting and resisting the Islamic Invaders who invaded </p>
<p>   them.  This resistance lasted for nearly 5 centuries until </p>
<p>   the Indians defeated the Islamic Crusaders in the final </p>
<p>   round, starting from the 1600&rsquo;s to 1750 AD.  Though the </p>
<p>   Indians managed to defeat the Muslims,  in the process</p>
<p>   they had to sacrifice 80 MILLION LIVES!!  Yep, 80 million. </p>
<p>   The large loss in lives basically lead to a disruption </p>
<p>   to some extent in social cohesion and the functional </p>
<p>   stability of the Indian society which contributed to a </p>
<p>   certain backwardness we see today.   </p>

<p>And I would like to respond to the first arrogant Indian who posted above.  White people invented computers.  Why do we need you guys coming here and doing computer work for us?  The truth is that you will never be as good at it as whites. You just work for lower wages.</p>

     Courtney,   </p>
<p>     To be honest, Indians really don&rsquo;t care what Whites<br>
      think about them.  Indians are basically an <br>
     insensitive people that don&rsquo;t bother about what others <br>
     think.   That being said, if Indians are not that good at<br>
     computer work, why would your own American companies want<br>
     to hire them by the thousands??  Cheaper costs aren&rsquo;t the <br>
     only reason,Courtney.  Indians CAN do the job as good as <br>
     Whites at a fraction of the cost.  Quality of the work <br>
     also matters too.  Indians can bring quality work at a<br>
     much lower price.  You don&rsquo;t have to be a Business man/woman<br>
     to understand what that means.  </p>
<p>     There is also something called Capitalism and Business Logic<br>
     Ever heard of the saying &#8220;Business is Business&#8221;.   </p>

<p>     Courtney, </p>
<p>     Just for your information, Indians did invent/discover<br>
     something sophisticated in recent times.   </p>
<p>     Some Examples:  </p>
<p>     Noshir Gowadia- &#8220;Father of the technology that protects<br>
                      the B2 stealth bomber from Heat Seeking<br>
                      Missiles&#8221;.  </p>
<p>                      Conceptualised and designed the B2 <br>
                      Bombers&rsquo; entire propulsion system.  </p>
<p><br>
   Narinder Singh Kapany- Considered to be the &#8220;Father of Fiber<br>
                           Optics&#8221;.  E-mailing is possible <br>
                           because of this discovery. </p>
<p>   <br>
   Vinod Dham- Considered to be the Inventor of the Intel Pentium<br>
               Processor.  </p>
<p>   Sabeer Bhatia- Founder of Hotmail. </p>
<p>   Krishna Bharat- Mastered the Algorithm needed for Webpages<br>
                   for Google.   </p>
<p><br>
   Vilayanur Ramachandran- Invented the Mirror Box for <br>
                           Prosthetic purposes.   </p>
<p> <br>
   Ram Atul Sethi- Invented the widely used &#8220;Jaipur Foot&#8221;, <br>
                   a prosthetic.  This is used around the world. </p>
<p>   <br>
   There are many more modern examples of discovery/innovation<br>
   by Indians.     </p>

<p>       Courtney, </p>
<p>       I am just wondering but why do you have so much<br>
       of hate towards Indians?  Indians are a very small<br>
       minority in the US, only 0.5%.  There are so many<br>
       other types of ethnic groups in your country.  </p>
<p>       Why are you so fixated on Indians?  What&rsquo;s your beef<br>
       with them? Indians are not bothering Whites the way<br>
       Blacks, Hispanics and Muslims are.    </p>
<p>       Indians are probably the few Non-Whites who have no <br>
       enemity or bad feeling towards Whites the way some<br>
       other groups do.</p>

You really have the nerve; living in my country that my ancestors created, telling me that your people have every right to come here and take these jobs that white people do just fine. </p>
<p>Why are you in this country taking our jobs?  If your country is so great, then why not go back there?  You haven&rsquo;t answered that question yet.</p>
<p>And I bet you anything, I can go through each of those inventions and find that an Indian played a very minor role in creating them.  A common lie is that an Indian invented fiber optics.  When I went to read up on fiber optics, I found that it was mostly developed by whites, and there was only one Indian that played a small part.  So why should I believe that an Indian invented any of the stuff you listed there?</p>
<p>Rick,</p>
<p>If you are from another country, then what business is it of yours that Indians bother me?  What country are you from?  And there are millions of white Americans that are getting tired of Indians.  I am not alone.</p>
<p>Why are we tired of them?  For the reasons that Jaya is showing above.  White people have invented 90% of the world&rsquo;s science and we have created the best countries in the world to live in.  We are getting sick and tired of being told these lies (like what this arrogant Indian above is claiming) that Indians are somehow better than us at science and we need them to come here and do our computer work for us.  </p>
<p>So the race that invented computers can&rsquo;t do its own computer work and science?  Give me a break!  Why are we suddenly importing people from this third world country to do this work that we have been doing on our own (better than any one else) for decades?</p>
<p>There are many competent white computer engineers who are out of work because of these less qualified Indians who do the work for cheaper. I have never known anyone who works with them who has a high opinion of them.  I personally think they have an arrogance about them that they haven&rsquo;t even earned yet.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t ask me why I get tired of them as if I shouldn&rsquo;t be getting tired of them.  If you don&rsquo;t even live in America then why is it your business?</p>

			<p>&#8220;Sabeer Bhatia- Founder of Hotmail&#8221;</p>
<p>I just did a search on this and found that a white guy named Jack Smith was the guy who came up with the idea.  The Indian you name here played a small part.</p>
<p>&#8220;Narinder Singh Kapany- Considered to be the &ldquo;Father of Fiber<br>
Optics&rdquo;. E-mailing is possible <br>
because of this discovery. &#8220;</p>
<p>I just did a search on who created this.  A bunch of white names came up and just one Indian name.</p>
<p><br>
Need I go on?  It is obvious you are making this stuff up.  You are really making me mad.  But what else is new?  This is so typical of your people (trying to take credit for stuff white people did).</p>

      Courtney,  </p>
<p>      The only reason I am answering you is because you<br>
      asked the question &#8220;What did you guys invent recently&#8221;?</p>
<p>      As for Hotmail, no you are mistaken.  Sabeer Bhatia <br>
      was the one who developed the concept into a successful<br>
      venture and even sold it to Microsoft.  Hotmail was just<br>
      an add-on to Javasoft.  Even before Jack&rsquo;s suggestion, <br>
      Sabeer was already thinking of online mailing using an<br>
      annonymous account at the workplace.  </p>
<p><br>
      As for Fiber Optics, again you are wrong.  Though you <br>
      are right that there were Whites who contributed <br>
      ideas towards FO, but Kapany gets the credit for inventing<br>
      the first FUNCTIONAL Fiber Optic in the applied sense. <br>
      He invented a glass coated rod that could protect the beam<br>
      of light from being obstructed by the environment.  This<br>
      is the key point.  He also coined the term &#8220;Fiber Optics&#8221;<br>
      Kapany by the way has more than 100 patents to his credit.<br>
      Minor role??  His research and contributions cover a wide<br>
      field.<br>
        <br>

      Courtney, </p>
<p><br>
      Whatever Jaya Khan has written is actually true.  <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Some more examples:</p>
<p>      C.Kumar N. Patel- Developed the Carbon Dioxide Laser,  <br>
                        used as a cutting tool in surgery <br>
                        and industry. </p>
<p>      Mani Lal Bhaumik- Inventor of Excimer Laser Technology.  </p>
<p><br>
      Panini-  Indian Grammarian who wrote a Grammar<br>
               (Astadhyayi).  His grammar was the fore-runner <br>
                of the Modern Formal Language theory used for<br>
                computer software. </p>
<p>     <br>
      J.C. Bose- Discovered Wireless communication even before<br>
                 Marconi.    <br>

<p>     Courtney, </p>
<p>     About Hotmail, you are mistaken.  Sabeer Bhatia<br>
     was the founder of the Hotmail business.  Hotmail <br>
     was just an add-on to his idea of using Javasoft.  <br>
     He was already experimenting with the idea of annonymous<br>
     personal mailing online at his workplace.  Mr.Smith <br>
     only re-ignited the original idea that Sabeer had.  </p>
<p>     Sabeer was the one who built up the company and sold it<br>
     to Microsoft.   </p>
<p>     <br>
     As for Narinder Singh Kapany, you are wrong again.  <br>
     It was Kapany&rsquo;s invention of a special glass coated rod<br>
     in 1954/56 that led to the PRACTICAL and FUNCTIONAL use<br>
     of Fiber Optics as a mode of practical communication.  <br>
     Kapany also coined the the term &#8220;Fiber Optics&#8221;.  He has<br>
     more than 100 patents to his credit.    </p>
<p>     Indians did contribute in the modern period.  <br>
     Everything I just said is the truth.  You just need to<br>
     realize it and accept it. <br>

			<p>What is this, the convention of Indians answering my posts?  Or is this just the same Indian guy posting under different names? This is the last post I am putting up, simply because I am not as paranoid about this stuff as you guys are.  I find it funny that you are even posting on this site.  Don&rsquo;t ever expect me to waste my time on an Indian pride site because I could care less.  The truth is, most people on this site (and in America in general) have low opinions about your people being in this country.  Whine to me all you want.  It won&rsquo;t change anything.</p>
<p>Your arguments are irrelevent because not one of you have answered my question.  Why do Indians have to come to Western countries if your people are so great?  Why?  Why not stay in your own country?</p>
<p>Even if what you guys are saying is true, (I doubt it is because I have done plenty of research on this stuff), white people have still created 90% of the world&rsquo;s science.  Brag about what little your people have done all you want to.  It still doesn&rsquo;t explain why your people have to immigrate here to be successful.</p>
<p>Another point that can be made is that all the examples you have listed above are merely improvements on white science and technology.  There is no getting around that.</p>
<p>And as I said, this is the last post I am putting up.  Unlike you guys, I am not paranoid about this stuff because I have enough pride in my own people.  And Jaya has proven once again that what I say matters to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indians did contribute in the modern period. <br>
Everything I just said is the truth. You just need to<br>
realize it and accept it. &#8220;</p>
<p>Guess, what?  I am NOT going to accept it.  Why?  Because it isn&rsquo;t true.  You guys haven&rsquo;t contributed nearly as much to the modern world as whites have.  Otherwise, why isn&rsquo;t India a modern wonder? I find your seriousness about this conversation pathetic, and it just shows your inferiority complex as a people.  You guys are pathetic.</p>
