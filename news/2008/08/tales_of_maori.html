						<p>Maori cannibalism was widespread throughout New Zealand until the mid 1800s but has largely been ignored in history books, says the author of a new book released this week.</p>
<p>Paul Moon said his new book, This Horrid Practice, looked at the Maori tradition of eating each other in what was a particularly violent society before Europeans arrived in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Cannibalism lasted for several hundred years until the 1830s although there were a few isolated cases after that, said Professor Moon, a Pakeha history professor at Te Ara Poutama, the Maori Development Unit at the Auckland University of Technology.</p>
<p>He also said infanticide was also widely practised because tribes wanted men to be warriors and mothers often killed their female daughters by smothering them or pushing a finger through the soft tissue of the skull to kill them immediately.</p>
<p>He said the widespread practice of cannibalism was not a food issue but people were eaten often as part of a post-battle rage. Enemies were often captured and killed later to be eaten or killed because of a minor transgression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather than disposing of the body it was prepared to be eaten,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Part of the practice was also to send a warning to other tribes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the arguments is really if you want to punish your enemy killing them is not enough. If you can chop them up and eat them and turn them into excrement that is the greatest humiliation you can impose on them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prof Moon said historians often said Maori were not cannibals and based their findings on European standards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The amount of evidence is so overwhelming it would be unfair to pretend it didn&rsquo;t happen. It is too important to ignore,&rdquo; said Prof Moon.</p>
<p>The head of the Maori Studies Department at Auckland University, Professor Margaret Mutu, who had not read Prof Moon&rsquo;s book, said cannibalism was widespread throughout New Zealand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was definitely there. It&rsquo;s recorded in all sorts of ways in our histories and traditions, a lot of place names refer to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was part of our culture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said Maori cannibalism was not referred to by many historians because it was counter to English culture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will get your English-based historians who come out of an English culture who don&rsquo;t understand it and avoid it because they don&rsquo;t understand it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t understand it you&rsquo;re risking misinterpreting it badly if you try to address it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prof Mutu said she knew of no Pakeha historians who knew how to balance parts of the Maori culture they could not see an equivalent to in the English culture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t understand the things you are talking about you take one hell of a risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said Prof Moon did not understand the history of cannibalism and it was &ldquo;very, very hard for a Pakeha to get it right on these things especially when they don&rsquo;t know how to interrogate it from within the culture and interrogating it from within the culture means interrogating it from within the language.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is braver than I would be,&rdquo; she said.<br>

<p><br>
Uh, not to mention fundamental human decency. </p>
<p>But then, the multicultists either don&rsquo;t care OR ACTIVELY MILITATE AGAINST both English culture AND fundamental human decency, right? Both concepts are, to the multiculti brain, not only obsolete but OBSCENE! </p>
<p>Just memorize the following non-negotiable diktats, and all will be well: </p>
<p>If non-whites did something   &mdash;   no matter how horrific   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s Good.</p>
<p>If whites did something   &mdash;   no matter how beneficial   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s Bad. </p>

			<p>&#8220;You will get your English-based historians who come out of an English culture who don&rsquo;t understand it and avoid it because they don&rsquo;t understand it&hellip;If you don&rsquo;t understand it you&rsquo;re risking misinterpreting it badly if you try to address it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s there to &#8220;understand&#8221; or &#8220;misinterpret&#8221; about cannibalism? They killed their enemies, chopped them up and ate them. What&rsquo;s so complicated about that?</p>
<p>&#8220;She said Prof Moon did not understand the history of cannibalism and it was &ldquo;very, very hard for a Pakeha to get it right on these things especially when they don&rsquo;t know how to interrogate it from within the culture and interrogating it from within the culture means interrogating it from within the language.&#8221;</p>
<p>I interrogate what the hail this gibberish is supposed to mean.</p>
<p>I have another interrogation as well: Does anyone know of any white cultures which practiced cannibalism? I know there have been cases like the Donner Party or plane crashes in the Andes where evil honkies ate each other to survive, but that&rsquo;s about it. I seem to recall reading something about Neanderthals or Cro-Magnons eating each other, but I can&rsquo;t think of a single white culture that ever sunk this low.<br>

<p><p>Maybe the best way to &#8220;honor&#8221; such cultures really <i>is</i> to name newly discovered plutoids after their local gods.  Nothing but what is cold, remote, barren and inimical to human life is the proper referent for this ethos.   </p></p>

			<p>Yes, the Maories were truly a barbaric culture, not at all like the noble Europeans. Yes, it&rsquo;s true that the Europeans commited mass genocide, raped and tortured their fellow Europeans for centuries and committed unspeakable attrocities in war, but at leas they didn&rsquo;t eat each other. </p>

			<p>A little perspective: There were no land mammals on either of the NZ islands. There were only birds, flightless &amp; regular, &amp; sea critters.  No sheep, no deer, no boar, no bison, not even rats.  I&rsquo;m pretty sure my Irish ancestors would have made stew of each other pretty quickly in that situation.</p>
<p>Thankfully, when the white folk finally turned up, they were able to bring farm animals to NZ.  Mostly, that is, millions &amp; millions of sheep. </p>

			<p>Very hard for a pakeha to &#8220;get it&#8221;?  What&rsquo;s to get?  They ate people.  They liked it.  I wouldn&rsquo;t be suprised if they wanted to re-institute the practice under the guise of multiculturalism.</p>

			<p>Prof Mutu didn&rsquo;t read the Paheka&rsquo;s book, but she emphatically states he doesn&rsquo;t understand the history of cannibalism.  ??  </p>
<p>Do you suppose she means &#8220;interpret&#8221; or &#8220;analyze&#8221; rather than &#8220;interrogate&#8221;?  </p>
<p>She&rsquo;s certainly taking one hell of a risk by attempting to communicate in a language she obviously can&rsquo;t culturally understand, not being English.</p>
<p>However, the article&rsquo;s author has driven home the main point:  if white explorers/settlers/historians mention &#8220;uncomfortable&#8221; native traditions, they&rsquo;re Eurocentric racists.  If they don&rsquo;t mention said traditions, they&rsquo;re Eurocentric racists.  Get it? Got it.</p>

			<p>I recall reading books written by Japanese soldiers from WWII that said that Japanese soldiers were actively hunted and eaten by these Maori tribes because of the terrible abuse heaped upon these tribesmen by the Japanese. The Allies reported being treated very well, and helped to escape Japanese capture. Japanese soldiers in Northern Australia, are said to have eaten a number of Australian prisoners of war, this was said by other Australian prisoners though I do not profess to know the truth of this. Anybody??</p>

Could you find a better example of defending &#8220;cultural relativism&#8221;?</p>
<p>Cannibalism is only a &#8216;cultural thing&rsquo; and to speak of it would have offended the sensibilities of the sheltered Brits who couldn&rsquo;t understand such a cultural difference.</p>
<p>19th century Brits were a hearty and tough lot. If they weren&rsquo;t told about this practice it&rsquo;s because it is so culturally wrong (not relative) that they would have formed truth-based stereotypes of the Maori.</p>

			<p>Anonymous at 6:52PM asks if any white cultures practiced cannibalism.  It would seem there was no ritualistic cannibalism in Europe(https://strangemaps.wordpress.com/2008/07/21/299-niam-niam-the-cannibal-map-of-the-world/).  Maybe white people don&rsquo;t taste as good because of all that toxic racist buildup in their tissue.</p>

<p>The history of every people will reveal atrocities committed in war or intra-tribal conflicts. It&rsquo;s all part of social evolution based on animal evolution.</p>
<p>The knowledge of history we have of the west is the result of people learning how to write and keep records. If primitive cultures had learned such a trick, we would likely be amazed by the levels of violence and brutality. (An example of this would be pre-Colombian people of South America who interwove mass killings into their social-political rituals).</p>
<p>The difference is how societies learned from the past and advanced.</p>
<p>Whites are not angels. No one here claims they are. However, neither were non-people innocent of brutality as the modern politically correct narrative would have us believe.<br>
 <br>
Even in the worst of times, white civilization moved forward. Other non-white people seemed to have locked themselves into their barbaric rituals and never questioned their practices or even debated if they were right or wrong.</p>
<p>The question we always come back to is if white people are as bad as you believe, why do non-whites do everything they can to live in white nations and white communities.</p>
<p>I know how violent non-whites can be so I do everything I can to avoid them. That seems to me to be an intelligent choice. You and others claim white people are even more violent and yet you and others demand to live with white people. How honest and how smart is that?</p>
<p>If you believed any of your own ideas, you would be fleeing from not running to white people.</p>

<p>  But Dr. Moon said &#8220;the widespread practice of cannibalism was not a food issue but people were eaten often as part of a post-battle rage. Enemies were often captured and killed later to be eaten or killed because of a minor transgression.&#8221; Cannibalism seemed to be a matter of culture not dictated by starvation or lack of nourishing food.</p>
<p> How much cannibalism happened during the potato famine in Ireland, when people were dying of starvation in their tens of thousands? Only a few isolated instances, and no one was proud of it.  </p>

			<p>Skip,</p>
<p>The natives that ate Japanese soldiers were in New Guinea, not NZ.  There are several reports of Japanese soldiers resorting to cannibalism, both ceremonial and for survival.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Flyboys&#8221;, by James Bradley relates stories of ceremonial Japanese cannibalism.  Bradley also wrote, &#8220;Flags of Our Fathers&#8221;.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..<br>
Maybe that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>I  once read a fascinating book by a French naval physician  (Dr. Jacobus) who served in the French navy in the South Pacific in the 1800s.<br>
He noted that the Australian aborigines  did not care for  European flesh so much, finding it tough, apparently because of white&rsquo;s use of  salt and liquor.  They were, however, especially fond of Chinese, finding them tasty and tender, which he ascribed to the absence of salt in their (Chinese) diets.  Chinese coolies working in the Australian mines did occasionally disappear.</p>

As I recall (having read it long ago), Southey mentioned this, though I cannot remember the source.   I assumed it was apocryphal.</p>
