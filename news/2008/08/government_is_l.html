<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Speaking as police appealed for calm in the wake of two gang-related deaths in the Midlands, Dr Derrick Campbell said that funds intended to promote community cohesion were reaching the wrong organisations.</p>
<p>Dr Campbell is chairman of the National Independent Advisory Group on Criminal Use of Firearms, which advises the Home Office and the security services.</p>
<p>He told the BBC: &#8220;We have clear evidence of organisations which used to be funded and have delivered on outcomes but have suddenly not been supported.</p>
<p>&#8220;And we have to ask the question whether there seems to be an acceptance that if another black youth is killed they are just another one that we don&rsquo;t have to worry about.</p>
<p>&#8220;Black youths within this country have been left to die. And that&rsquo;s a very strong statement but it&rsquo;s a statement that seems to be borne out through evidence about black youths who seem to be at the top of the list when it comes to our youngsters being killed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we&rsquo;re asking very serious questions of national government and local government as to why it seems that resources that have been allocated for community cohesion and other activities have not been going to those organisations.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said there was hard evidence that funding to community groups in the Birmingham area had been cut, and that this situation was reflected nationwide.</p>
<p>A Home Office spokesman told the BBC: &#8220;The government is committed to tackling gun, gang and knife crime and getting weapons off our streets.</p>
<p>&#8220;In July we launched the £100m Youth Crime Action Plan which sets out a comprehensive package of tough enforcement and intensive prevention measures as well as more support for parents to tackle offending and reduce reoffending.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr Campbell said the murder of 11-year-old Rhys Jones a year ago demonstrated that crimes against white youths received more attention from the Government and media.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a result (of the shooting) the Home Office was jumping up and down last August,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The question was asked at the time of the Home Secretary why it was we didn&rsquo;t see the same frenetic activity from the Government and the media when the black youths were murdered and yet when the white youngster was killed everybody stood to attention.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Home Office minister Tony McNulty rejected the suggestion that murders of black youths received less Government or media attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;Frankly what Derrick says is an insult to black groups and other community groups up and down the country who are being funded by local and central government, and work in this area on a daily and regular basis,&#8221; Mr McNulty said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do need to knock down the notion that somehow there is a national conspiracy of at best indifference, and at worst active policy that says somehow the death of young black men on our streets doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;It matters profoundly, and it matters in every single instance whether the individual is black or white.&#8221;</p>
<p>Three incidents in the West Midlands, all involving black youths, included the shooting dead of Dimitri Foskin, 24, in the Newtown area of Birmingham on Saturday night.<br>

Black youths are not being left to die. They are killing each other. They are the ones doing it and only they can stop it.</p>
<p>If there was one programed that has ever been successful at stopping blacks from killing each other, it would have been universally implemented and the killings would have ended.</p>
<p>There is no such program or (pardon the pun) magic bullet. Unless we go back to the first paragraph I posted. Then the solution is the bullet.</p>

			<p>Thank God for the Internet! No longer can Black-on-White crime be a secret! In the USA, more and more Whites know what the MSM is really about. When the race of a suspect is kept secret, we know what is really going on. I do not view myself as some White Power person, but that view is slowly changing. Pretty soon, there will not be a choice. I also am not one of those people who needs to preface any statement with information about my skin color,but now I am forced to think that way. If they want to kill each other, what are we going to do about it? Isn&rsquo;t just a way of expressing themselves? Pride in their culture? According to Black culture, all technical and science-oriented people are punks. Soft. But,really,you do have to admire the courage that alot of Black youths display. There was the 6-1 beat down in Jena, the 50-1 of the train riders in St.Louis, and all the 100-1 attacks in numerous riots and wildings. What courage! People miss the Mafia, but if they owned the Metra in St.Louis and all the Malls/Shopping areas that have been closed, take a wild guess what would happen to the attackers! It is eventually going to become a Brazil situation where the business owners will be forced to settle out of court. Sad, but true.</p>

			<p>It is truly remarkable - wherever Blacks exist in the world&hellip;they fail. And it is always someone else&rsquo;s (namely Whites of course) responsibility to care for them. This is this glorious &#8220;equality&#8221; we hear so much about? That is as curious an interpretation of &#8220;equal&#8221; as one could imagine!</p>

<p>More complaints from or about blacks as usual.  That they should have never been allowed entry to a first world country never seems to cross the minds of these disgusting lunatics who promoted their importation.</p>
<p>Ten years from now, these same odd balls will look back on these troubled racial times as &#8220;The good old days,&#8221; because the situation will only get worse with each passing year.</p>

<p>I think it more likely that it is the criminal who is being ignored and not the victim. That is, when blacks commit crimes it&rsquo;s ignored. When whites commit crimes it draws media attention. </p>
<p>But what do I know? I&rsquo;m not a big investigative reporter. </p>

			<p>We just &#8216;enjoyed&rsquo; the annual blackfest at the Notting Hill carnival in London. Yes, same place as the film. Over a million attended, most were black africans described as &#8216;caribbean&rsquo;. Just a big african family fun street party, lots of flamboyant costumes, dancing, african food stalls, steel bands, many mobile black rap &#8216;studios&rsquo; blasting out their evil lyrics at absolute full distorted volume. Sounds good, doesn&rsquo;t it? This weekend was supposed to be a public holiday in UK but not for White Police officers at this event as they arrested 271 including 91 for drugs, 28 for &#8216;possession of weapons&rsquo; (that means knives, machetes and other blades) 1 carrying a firearm and 19 with dangerous dogs (american pit bulls), all this at a family fun carnival!! One gang of 180 &#8216;youths&rsquo; (read black africans) were prevented from attending the carnival and causing further mayhem as they had aleady &#8216;caused trouble&rsquo; elsewhere earlier in the day and many were known to have created criminal havoc at previous carnivals. Over the two day family event, London ambulance treated 211 of which 75 were hosptalised. This in a country accused of ignoring black victims of crime and of media indifference. Perhaps it would have been better to simply seal off Notting Hill and let the africans enjoy their carnival in their own jolly traditional tribal way. Now that would amply display &#8216;national indifference&rsquo; to black-on-black crime and the results would mimic the earlier AMREN story on events in New Orleans following Katrina.</p>

			<p>If you look at the website of this black racist it is obvious that he can&rsquo;t even spell properly and has a poor command of the English language despite being handed a doctorate from the new dumbed-down British educational system. Still I suppose Mengele had a Dr. preceding his name too. </p>
<p>Blacks in London, like everywhere else, are popping off each other ten-a-penny and the Metropolitan Police have been running Operation Trident for years in an effort to combat black serious crime at the request of black community organisations. Of course it was black community groups that complained and stopped the police from stopping and questioning &#8216;black youths&rsquo; in the streets because this was stereotyping. It is this policy from these black community groups which is responsible in part for the present spiralling black crime rate in London.</p>
<p>Of course Campbell shows absolutely no concern for the innocent young white victims of the same murderous black thugs and their gangsta culture. According to this jumped-up race hustler, whites are guilty even when blacks are committing murder.</p>

			<p>The few long-suffering white English who refuse to be bullied out of their homes by diversity in the Notting Hill neighourhood refer to this annual crime-fest as the Mug &#8216;n&rsquo; Kill Carnage Ball.</p>
<p>A friend of mine who lives along the route made sure that he was away during the entire duration an event so beloved of the lying MSM.</p>

			<p>Where ever they are, blacks complain, complain, complain! And where ever they are, they blame whites aren&rsquo;t doing enough. When it comes to black crime, they often complain that law enforcement isn&rsquo;t doing enough to end it. But when they do send in law enforcement, they complain that they are being targeted for harrassment. And then there is their need for constant attention by the media. I remember when little Samantha Runnion was abducted and murdered, all blacks could do was gripe endlessly that the media was focusing on another white crime victim instead of a black one. They did the same thing, when Natalee Holloway went missing in Aruba. They are all so ME ME ME oriented, they can&rsquo;t care about anyone else.</p>

<p>  This sounds like many of the &#8220;Juneteenth&#8221; celebrations in the United States. Unfortunately, some of our State Fair celebrations have gone the same route for the same reason. I&rsquo;m sorry you British were fooled by toxic American Multicultural propaganda. Today, I guess all you can do is vote BNP and don&rsquo;t get fooled again. </p>

			<p>Most blacks are killed by other blacks.</p>
<p>If you make an effort to prosecute, then blacks will claim &#8216;racism&rsquo; because you are locking up too many blacks. (blacks commit 55% of the murders in the USA, so therefore they wind up being the majority of prisoners/convictions for murder)</p>
<p>But if you don&rsquo;t go after the criminals, then you will be accused of being &#8216;racist&rsquo; against their mostly black victims.</p>
<p>This is just typical black double standard race based politics.</p>
<p>Kind of like the &#8216;housing crisis&rsquo;, where blacks for years cried &#8216;racism&rsquo; that they didn&rsquo;t get mortage loans (called it &#8216;redlining&rsquo; even though it was due to bad credit). </p>
<p>Then when the government pushed for unqualified blacks to get loans in the 1990s and under Bush, the blacks cry &#8216;racism&rsquo; saying the banks engaged in &#8216;predatory lending&rsquo; to blacks!</p>
<p>And of course now they are demaning the government pay their mortages off!</p>

<p>You mean <i>instead</i> of getting the thugs who use them off the streets? Oh yeah, brilliant. Real thinkers right there. Let me know how that works for you. Britain should be crime free any day now.</p>

<p> What is the British government doing? Gathering up black &#8220;youths&#8221; and taking them to the top of Ben Nevis and leaving them there to die of exposure? </p>
<p>It couldn&rsquo;t be that black &#8220;youths&#8221; are killing black &#8220;youths&#8221; now could it? That blacks are repeating their standard operating procedure of creating Africa (violence, crime and mayhem) everywhere they go.</p>

			<p>Black youth in London are foreigners and need to leave.  They constantly abuse the civil and indigenous rights of English people.  English people don&rsquo;t want them there.  Once the English people rise up and tell their oppressors (English Gov&rsquo;t and foreigners) that they don&rsquo;t accept their oppression any longer then we&rsquo;ll be on the verge of justice for English people.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s an outrage that this alien uproar is pandered to every year while harmless English customs are closed down because of &#8216;health and safety&rsquo; regulations. </p>
