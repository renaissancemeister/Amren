						<p>On an evening its rivals were preoccupied with Christie Brinkley&rsquo;s divorce and the capture of a Brooklyn murder suspect, New York&rsquo;s WXTV led its local news with a story about graffiti saying &ldquo;Get out of the USA&rdquo; painted near a Peruvian restaurant on Long Island.</p>
<p>The Spanish-speaking Univision affiliate figured it was a more meaningful story for its audience, and those kind of choices are paying off.</p>
<p>Within the past few months, WXTV&rsquo;s 6 p.m. newscast has eclipsed its English-speaking competitors on ABC, CBS and NBC stations in popularity among viewers younger than 49. Sister station KMEX in Los Angeles had more viewers in June for its newscast than any of its English competitors, regardless of age, according to Nielsen Media Research.</p>
<p>Spanish-speaking news outlets all across the country have grown to become major players in their markets and all trends indicate that growth is only going to continue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It talks about how the United States is changing,&rdquo; said Ray Rodriguez, president and chief operating officer of Univision Communications Inc., the stations&rsquo; parent company. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bigger story than just television.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the New York market, for example, there were 2.7 million Hispanics in 1990 and 4.3 million this year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>General news isn&rsquo;t excluded; it&rsquo;s just that the mix is different. English-language stations covered it heavily when the aircraft carrier Intrepid got stuck in the mud, while WXTV mentioned it briefly in the program&rsquo;s third segment.</p>
<p>About 100 story tips a day come into her newsroom, said Norma Morato, WXTV&rsquo;s news director.</p>
<p>Morato, who worked for CBS&rsquo; local news before joining WXTV, noticed that many public officials have added Spanish speakers in their press offices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll see us coming in and have a press conference in English, then say, &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll take care of you when we&rsquo;re done,&rsquo;&ldquo; she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>KMEX calls its effort &ldquo;a su lado&rdquo; &mdash; by your side &mdash; and once aired a program to tell viewers facing home foreclosure what they could do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do things outside the realm of news, but it gives an image to the viewers that we care,&rdquo; Pineda said.<br>

			<p>The inability of America to assimilate Hispanics into the english language will create huge problems. One of Americas strength&rsquo;s was the consistency of english across the country. Local accents and dialects aside english is the most powerful language in the world. any diversion from that to accommodate hispanics will just cause problems.</p>

			<p>A foreign source of information seen and heard by millions more than an American source of information. Hmmm. And to boot, information from a nation that is for the most part, utterly jealous and hostile towards the U.S. Some Americans will never get it.</p>

			<p>well, most of the hosts are dressed like whores. so why wouldn&rsquo;t they have high viewership. it&rsquo;s not news, it&rsquo;s the hispanic playboy channel. of course look at most hispanic women and you realize what a fantasy hispanic tv is. no mayan or indian types need apply for jobs on hispanic tv. discrimination suits- ha ha.</p>

			<p>Twenty years ago I would have thought this would never happen, but even Oregon now has a local Spanish language program on Univision, called Noticias Noroeste (Northwest News). I&rsquo;ve watched it a few times and their stories are only relevant to the local Mexicans. Also, about 1/3rd of the local AM stations are in Spanish.<br>
Its only a matter of time before Noticias Noroeste surpasses the local news in ratings&hellip;<br>

			<p>As I said before, the reason the New York Times is losing money is that they are trying to sell an English language newspaper in a Spanish speaking town.</p>
<p>This article proves my point.</p>

<p>I hope that&rsquo;s not the only reason!</p>
<p>Why anyone would buy/contribute to their local paper is beyond me, and I say that knowing half of my education comes from having read the newspaper nearly every single day. There are alternatives, beginning with AmRen. <br>

			<p>The reason people are not watching CBS, NBC, ect, is because there is no news. There is anti-white hate propaganda, but that gets tiring after a while.</p>

			<p>Just look at the playmate of the month women on those hispanic shows.  First time I saw them, I was surprised that the FCC allowed women dressed, or rather undressed like that to appear during the day, saturday at that when the kids are home from school.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cheaper than palyboy or hustler and those girls really know how to move.</p>

If you live in Oregon, have you looked around you lately? I live in Washington, just 10 miles from the Oregon border, and in case you haven&rsquo;t noticed, Washington and Oregon have long since been overrun by these (mostly illegal) Hispanics. You can&rsquo;t go anywhere or do anything without them and their hordes of little anchor babies all chittering away in Spanish. I don&rsquo;t know why the Northwest hasn&rsquo;t been placed among the &#8220;Big 7&#8221; of states invaded by this trash.</p>

			<p>Univision is merely a front for illegal invasion advocates.  Period.  They are biased towards Mexico.  Just look at the sports events they show - all Mexican sports events for example.  </p>
