<h1>U.S. Extends Mexico Truck Program Despite Objections</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Reuters, August 3, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Bush administration on Monday extended a test program allowing long-haul trucks from Mexico full access to U.S. highways for up to two years, despite pending legislation in Congress to shut it down.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Organized labor, highway safety and consumer groups have fiercely opposed the initiative, which was permitted under NAFTA &mdash; the North American Free Trade Agreement.</p>
<p>Trucks from Mexico have historically been confined to U.S. border areas where they offload goods to be trucked by American companies.</p>
<p>Last year, regulators approved a one-year pilot program to allow a limited number of Mexican trucks full access to U.S. roads over congressional objections. American trucks were also allowed to operate in Mexico.</p>
<p>Ten U.S. carriers with 55 trucks and 27 Mexican carriers with 107 trucks have participated in the program as of July without incident, U.S. and Mexican officials said.</p>
<p>They also said vehicles participating in the program meet safety requirements. But officials from U.S.-based unions say disputed safety issues remain unresolved.</p>

			<p>despite pending legislation in Congress to shut it down</p>
<p><br>
Which of course, almost guarantees that it WILL be shut down, lol.  Bush has miscalculated big time with this.  For years and years, this aspect of NAFTA has been put on hold while the US patiently waited for mexico to come into compliance with US standards.  They never did&hellip;.but now, this part of the program has been pushed through anyway.  When the inevitable happens (or even, just because reasonable standards have been ignored), it will be made illegal.  And another nail in the coffin of NAFTA will be hammered in.</p>
<p>Based on successes over the last couple of years in fighting for immigration reform and the fact that americans are being made aware of the threat of dissolving american soveriegnty, I feel confident that, soon, the whole open borders thing will finally be dead and buried.</p>
<p>Actually, I think the US is on the cusp of a new isolationism.  Damn few people think the UN is a legitimate organization and nobody on either side of the aisle is thrilled with US involvement beyond our borders.</p>

			<p>This angers me to no end. The trucking industry is in severe distress financially already what with all the insane regulations, not to mention the theives in the oil industry. These south of the border invaders will reek havoc on an already drowning industry. Not to mention a few &#8220;Minor&#8221; national security issues, and the unknown number of deaths caused by a bunch of illiterate illegals. Once again GW never met a one worlder he didn&rsquo;t like. Could this be more payback time to his seester in law? </p>

			<p>Not only will american truckers  be displaced by mexican truckers but more americans will be killed on our nations highways by mexican truckers who will bribe or use fake papers in mexico to get their uninspected and dangerous trucks with bald tires and bad brakes into the US. Not to mention truckers that have been drinking.</p>

			<p>Some years ago, I&rsquo;m guessing maybe 1998, I was on I-10 going from Shreveport, LA to Biloxi, MS. I was listening to a local talk radio station. It seems there had been a bad pile-up a day or two before going across the bayous due to fog. It was started by a truck slamming into another vehicle. A truck driver called in to the station and said he had heard that some truckers were trying to warn this driver about fog ahead, but the driver didn&rsquo;t understand them because he didn&rsquo;t speak English. </p>
<p>I never heard another thing about it, but I thought at the time that it was probably true.    </p>

Michael, that&rsquo;s wrong. You&rsquo;re unwittingly talking  about injury and/or klling there. People shouldn&rsquo;t post stuff like this on this site. I doubt you thought fully about the post, so it would be good to post a restatement or retraction. Surely you don&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;d kill truckers-or innocent commuters? <br>
It&rsquo;s easy to get mad and say things that we don&rsquo;t mean,  or would never actually do. It&rsquo;s part of being an erstwhile reasonable person in an insane world. But this is serious. Don&rsquo;t encourage people to commit crimes.</p>

			<p>Another point, keep in mind diesel fuel would be much cheaper in Mexico.  Wait until American trucking companies figure this out, and use the Mexican option to their fullest advantage.</p>

			<p>Wasn&rsquo;t this program defunded by congress only to have the law ignored by Bush&rsquo;s secretary of transportation?  If so, how can this program continue and how can the executive completely ignore a law passed by congress and signed by the president?<br>
Aside from its obvious lack of merit, this program is illegal.  What happened to the constitution?</p>

<p>In other words: LET THE CARNAGE BEGIN! Would you or anyone care to guess how many Mexican truck drivers are nipping at that bottle of tequila while driving? Or downing a six-pack of beer? The number of DWI accidents by illegals on the national scene is already staggering. Drunken and incompetent Mexicans causing hundreds of millions of dollars in property damage, medical care costs for the injured, even deaths of American citizens.</p>
<p>Remember Virginia&rsquo;s &#8220;Highway of Death&#8221; we read about on this site a year or two back?</p>

			<p>I keep hearing the same thing from the conservative posters to these comments in every one of these articles: &#8220;Quit crying truck-drivers and Teamsters.  Can&rsquo;t you handle a little competition? You must all be opposed to a free market and cheaper prices for goods&#8221;  There is NO free market in America.  The Teamsters are already all but destroyed and it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before they find a way to wipe them out all together.  I&rsquo;m by no means pro-union but the &#8220;Teamsters hate competition&#8221;  argument that the cons keep pushing is a non-issue.  The goods delivered at the WalMart Distribution Center will cost the same whether Juan or John is behind the wheel.  We are all at risk, this will only inflate profits and unless they &#8220;level the playing field&#8221; and introduce a true free market, this will only continue to be a money-making scheme manipulated by the govt under the falsehood that this is the only way to help Americans with inflation and high gas prices.  </p>

<p>I agree with you, but I don&rsquo;t think that predatory capitalism is the order of the day among regular AR posters.  I actually wish organized labor were stronger and more powerful in this country; as it is, they don&rsquo;t seem to care about outsourcing, as I stated earlier about the CWA.  Also, the Teamsters are about to lose thousands of members when InBev (formerly Anheuser-Busch) closes the St. Louis brewery (in spite of their promises not to), yet the Teamsters are oblivious.</p>
