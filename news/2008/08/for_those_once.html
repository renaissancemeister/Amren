						<p>Herbert Pompey had gone through rehab, stayed sober, held a job, married and started a landscaping business in the two years since he walked out of Taylor Correctional Institution. But what Pompey hadn&rsquo;t done &mdash; and what he assumed a string of felony drug and DUI convictions would keep him from ever doing again &mdash; was vote.</p>
<p>So his pulse quickened when civil rights lawyer Reggie Mitchell called to tell him that his rights had been restored.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mitchell is a leader of a disparate group of grass-roots Democrats and civil rights activists who are trying to register tens of thousands of newly eligible felons. They have taken up the cause on their own, motivated by the belief that former offenders have been unfairly disenfranchised for decades. Despite massive registration efforts, the presidential campaigns of Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama have not designated anyone to go after the group.</p>
<p>In Alabama, Al Sharpton&rsquo;s younger brother, the Rev. Kenneth Glasgow, will take his &#8220;Prodigal Son&#8221; ministry into state prisons with voter-registration cards for the first time. The American Civil Liberties Union recently filed suit there and in Tennessee to make it possible for an even larger class of felons to register. In Ohio, the NAACP will hold a voter-registration day at the Justice Center in downtown Cleveland this month to register &#8220;people caught up in the criminal justice system,&#8221; a local official said. In California, a team will stand in front of jails on Aug. 16 to register people visiting prisoners and encourage them to take registration cards to their incarcerated friends or family members, some of whom can legally vote.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a voting block that has never been open before, and it has opened up at such a time as this,&#8221; said Glasgow, who was a felon himself.</p>
<p>In Florida, a law change last year made more than 115,000 felons eligible to vote, according to the state Parole Commission. In other states, civil rights and criminal justice groups estimate there are similar numbers who have not registered.</p>
<p>All but two states &mdash; Maine and Vermont &mdash; limit voting rights for people with felony convictions. Some felons are banned from voting until they have completed parole and paid restitution, others for life. Kentucky and Virginia have the most restrictive laws, denying all felons the right to vote, though Virginia Gov. Timothy M. Kaine (D) has encouraged nonviolent offenders to apply to have their rights restored.</p>
<p>Generally, though restoring voting rights has hit resistance from all directions. Not wanting to appear soft on crime, Democratic and Republican leaders have not aggressively pursued the issue. In Florida, black state legislators led the fight for a decade before populist Republican Gov. Charlie Crist pushed through the change shortly after being elected in 2006. The legislation permits many nonviolent felons to vote as long as they have no charges pending, have paid restitution and have completed probation.</p>
<p>But getting the ex-offenders registered has been a slow process.</p>
<p>Mitchell, 43, a Democrat and Obama backer, is leading the effort in Tallahassee and has created an &#8220;Ex-Felon Targets&#8221; database to search for potential voters. He calls getting voter-registration cards to them a &#8220;passionate hobby.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The majority of people to get their rights restored are Democrats, and if we get them registered, [we] might overtake the state,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The Obama campaign isn&rsquo;t so sure. Mark Bubriski, the candidate&rsquo;s spokesman in Florida, said the felon vote &#8220;could certainly swing an election, but there are millions and millions of voters.&#8221; Bubriski added that finding ex-offenders can be hard to do, and that &#8220;there&rsquo;s also the perception, for some reason, that they are all black and all Democrats, and that&rsquo;s certainly not the case.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The majority of felons in the state [Florida] are white, and there are no studies on ex-offenders&rsquo; party affiliation. Yet black men are disproportionately incarcerated and disproportionately disenfranchised, which Mitchell sees as a civil rights issue. Before the law changed, nearly a third of the state&rsquo;s black men were banned from voting, according to the Florida chapter of the ACLU.</p>

											<p>
							<i>Krissah Williams Thompson, Washington Post, August 11, 2008</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>Washington Post reporter Krissah Williams Thompson was online Monday, Aug. 11 at 1 p.m. ET to discuss her article about Democratic activists working to inform and register Florida felons whose voting rights have been restored.</p>
<p>The transcript follows.</p>
<p><br>
New York: This just seems like a horrifyingly bad idea from a political perspective. All the McCain campaign heeds to do is run a bunch of photos of black ex-felons with Obama stickers, and pow, Obama has lost a few swing states full of edgy white voters. Could these efforts in fact end up tilting votes away from the activists&rsquo; favorite candidates?</p>
<p>Krissah Williams Thompson: Interesting point. Neither the Obama nor the McCain campaigns are targeting ex-felons. Both campaigns are undergoing massive voter registration drives and in some states ex-offenders are a large part of the potential new voter pool. Many of the activists who have been reaching out to felons belive the kind of political blow back you suggest is keeping the presidential candidates hands off.</p>
<p>_______________________</p>
<p>{snip}<br>
_______________________</p>
<p>New York: The felons you are referring to here almost exclusively are nonviolent offenders. We can assume a large majority of them are drug offenders. As you are aware, and as you chose to leave out of your article, the drug laws in Florida and elsewhere have some interesting quirks. Among them, possession of powder cocaine remains a misdemeanor at five times the amount at which crack cocaine posession becomes a felony. As a result, you have racially disparate outcomes in terms of indictments and prosecutions for &#8220;felonies.&#8221; But don&rsquo;t let the facts get in the way of some good ol&rsquo; Republican fearmongering, Krissah.</p>
<p>Krissah Williams Thompson: Here&rsquo;s another point, which didn&rsquo;t make it into the story but some of the activist I talked to also pointed out. In some places, many of the felony convictions are due to non-violent drug offenses.</p>
<p>_______________________</p>
<p>{snip}<br>
_______________________</p>
<p>Reston, Va.: Hello. In the article, it appears that this movement only is addressing black ex-felons. Is there a reason they actively are discriminating against other races?</p>
<p>Krissah Williams Thompson: There are some groups that are registering felons across the board. Reggie Mitchell, the activist that I profiled, is particularly interested in helping to register black felons in his community, which he explains in the story. I would say he is focusing on one community not &#8220;actively discriminating.&#8221;</p>
<p>_______________________</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>_______________________</p>
<p>mediaskeptic: It&rsquo;s interesting that activist Mitchell compares the disenfranchisement of felons (!) to the historic disenfranchisement of blacks. I guess can conclude that our educational system&rsquo;s pushing of postmodern attitudes has robbed much of the public of any ability to discern how felons, black or any other color, neither deserve to vote nor have any particularly valuable platforms to back politically. Are they in favor not only of Obama but also of leniency for all misdemeanors and felonies, so that they can continue to prey on people? This all comes at the expense of law-abiding members of society.</p>
<p>Krissah Williams Thompson: More comments.</p>

			<p>There&rsquo;s a reason these machines want convicted Felons to be able to vote.  They won&rsquo;t vote by and large, but their names will be on the voter rolls thanks to motor-voter.  Black political machines commit voter fraud by voting people who didn&rsquo;t really vote, and they do it after the polls close.  With these new voters on the rolls, this means that there will be more votes to fake up.</p>

			<p>Chris Rock - because he is black is allowed to say things about blacks that whites are not allowed to - had some comments about the low turnout of blacks on election day and was making jokes about how we can expect convicted criminals to have an even lower voting rate. He is probably correct, so very few of these newly franchised voters will make it to the polls on time, but they will certainly talk a lot.</p>

Do democrats really want the criminal vote?</p>
<p>This highlights how close elections have become, how equally divided we are, and how desperate people are to find that last vote to put them over the top.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really understand the reasoning behind losing your right to vote even after time served. Is it to prevent felons from seeking justice through the voting booth? (If they could organize, criminals could influence local races to remove judges and police chiefs from office.) Or is it just a punishment that is supposed to deter people from committing felonies?</p>
<p>I have to wonder about the numbers. Even if voting rights were restored, how many of these ex-cons would vote? This doesn&rsquo;t seem to me to be a group that is civic minded or wants to be. This only seems to be an issue since the 2000 election.</p>
<p>Then again, in a tie breaker, all you need is one vote to win or lose.</p>

			<p>  Quick now: Tell me whether or not the writer of this story is 110 percent in favor of felons voting, and a rabid Obama supporter! I know, it&rsquo;s a tough question, but think hard &hellip;</p>
<p>  OK, to get serious, did anyone notice that nowhere in the story did the writer make any attempt to contact someone who didn&rsquo;t think felons should vote, and get their side of the argument? Of course they didn&rsquo;t! That would dilute the propaganda message the writer is pushing: Felons are disproportionately black, and also disproportionately Democrat, so denying felons the right to vote must be, as surely as the night follows the day, a White racist, Republican plot. Oh, sure.</p>
<p>  Even though admitting that the majority of convicted felons are White, the writer still tries to make it appear a conspiracy with blacks as the target. This wasn&rsquo;t an story providing information about a topic   &mdash;   it was a propaganda piece, pure and simple.</p>

			<p>&#8220;black men are disproportionately incarcerated and disproportionately disenfranchised, which Mitchell sees as a civil rights issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t they mean, &#8216;black men disproportionally lacerate and disproportionally slaughter, which Mitchell sees as a civil rights issue?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Their call to action regarding the justice system is inverted as well. Whites who commit crimes are much more likely to be apprehended. </p>

			<p>There are many civil rights groups seeking to restore voting rights for convicted felons.  When you are released from prison, you are supposed to have paid your debt to society.  However, in reality, there are many consequences to pay for being a convicted felon in society.  Ex-cons are not allowed to vote, hold public office, or own firearms.  Being a convicted felon, or ex-con, depending on which term you want use, will also make it almost impossible to find employment.  Being a convicted felon also has great negative social stigma in society.</p>
<p>Even the well-loved and harmless Marth Stewart had consequences to pay when she was denied permission to visit Great Britain, as a convicted felon.  Oops!  I forgot to mention there are number of countries convicted felons cannot visit, including Canada.</p>
<p>Here is a difference that I notice about restoring voting rights to ex-cons; even the National Rifle Association, America&rsquo;s premier right-to-bear arms organization, is opposed to allowing persons convicted of violent crimes to own firearms.  Contrary to popular myth, the N.R.A. supports a having a system of automatic backround checks for gun buyers.</p>
<p>Simply put, none of the civil rights groups and individuals who are working to restore voting rights for convicted felons, are for restoring right-to-bear-arms rights for convicted felons.</p>
<p>To everyone reading this post, do you think upon being released from prison, that convicted felons should have their voting rights restored?  Should non-violent, harmless convicted felons, whose crimes were not that of violence like Martha Stewart, have their right-to-bear arms restored?  I do think it was a terrible injustice for Great Britain to refuse to allow Martha Stewart to visit there.</p>

			<p>Florida is one of two states in which felons are barred from voting for life.  The other such state is Kentucky.  In Massechusetts, felons never lose their voting rights.  In the other 47 states, their voting rights come back once they are off probation or parole.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a problem with felons voting per se, but I do think they should have to be off probation or parole before they are allowed to reregister.  That said, I don&rsquo;t feel very sorry for the felons in Florida or Kentucky.  If voting is so important to them, they can simply move to another state once they have finished supervision.</p>

			<p>Do you get the feeling Mr Mitchell might advise a different approach were he dealing with Mr Pompey&rsquo;s <i>gun-possession</i> rights?  I can&rsquo;t imagine Mr Mitchell would want even those neighbors of his with clean police records to exercise <i>those</i>!</p>
<p>I say, if you can&rsquo;t be trusted with a trigger, you can&rsquo;t be trusted with a lever.</p>
<p><i>All but two states &mdash; Maine and Vermont &mdash; limit voting rights for people with felony convictions.</i></p>
<p>Note those are the two whitest states in the land.  Each has a trivial number of felons.</p>

			<p>  In the early days of our once great republic individual states could set voting restrictions as they saw fit. Some districts required property ownership, or residency requirements, others required basic literacy. Moreover, some required a record free of serious criminal convictions. It now seems we&rsquo;ve gotten to the point of allowing anyone even non citizens the vote. It&rsquo;s make of mockery of our entire political system. </p>

			<p>Kind of off topic, but something I found interesting.  If a person was receiving SSI or disability, commits a felony and is sent to prison, they continue to receive that money.  </p>

<p>Actually, many Midwestern and Western states allowed non-citizens to vote in the late 19th century.  In these states it was typical that they could vote six months after applying for citizenship.  It was seen as a way to attract responsible, republican (note the small R) immigrants to these still empty places.  They tended to come from Germany and Scandinavia.  </p>
<p>Think about it  &mdash;   even the level of alien voting has declined in the last century!</p>

			<p>We could assume the Traitorcrats (Democrats) figure there just aren&rsquo;t enough Obamabots and Obamandroid out there in sufficient numbers to swing the election for Our Mulatto Messiah. So, to play it safe, let&rsquo;s ensure the felons get to vote a few times each.</p>

<p>And many people who are convicted on non-violent drug offenses are violent criminals.  It was just easier for the prosecutor to put them away for having a bag of crack, than to put them away for the string of robberies they weren&rsquo;t caught doing.  I&rsquo;m no fan of the war on drugs and think it should be dismantled, but we should have no illusions as to what will happen if it is. </p>

			<p>Reggie Mitchell is a Mugabe type black african racist.  With all the black on white rape, robbery, civil and human rights abuses, this black racist shyster is seen by all non-whites (except the anti-white white Bolsheviks who just love genocide) for what he is - another black racist.</p>
