<h1>Slavery Was Good for the Black Man</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Dingwall, Jamaica Observer (Kingston), August 9, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As we celebrate emancipation and independence, we are being reminded of the horrors of slavery. According to our leaders, academics and others, slavery was the worst institution ever created. However, while it is popular for most to agree with this claim, I beg to disagree. Indeed, contrary to the belief that slavery was bad for us blacks, I believe that slavery was good for us.</p>
<p>Have we ever stopped to consider where we black people, especially those of us in the West, would be right now if it weren&rsquo;t for the Atlantic Slave Trade? What state do you think black Africa would be in today? Do you think that we would have been better off without slavery? I don&rsquo;t think so!</p>
<p>When the Europeans went to Africa to buy slaves, what did they find? They found a society and people vastly inferior to theirs. While the Europeans had emerged from their feudal practices, our ancestors in Africa, for the most part, had not developed for many centuries. We did not understand the concept of nation or government. Science and technology (and innovations in these areas) were non-existent in black Africa of the 15th and 16th centuries. Indeed, as a people, we had no sense of self-identity. In many respects, we were uncivilised.</p>
<p>Slavery was our most important contact with modernity. It is through this &#8220;most heinous system ever created&#8221; that we blacks were able to understand some of the principles of global trade. Our ancestors were introduced to the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade between Europe, Africa and the West Indies. Black Africa&rsquo;s part in the trade was the importation of European technology and the export of slaves. The importation of European technology was important &mdash; even though the Africans did not appreciate this importance at first. The export of slaves was also very important, especially for us in the West.</p>
<p>As time went on, we blacks, both in Africa and especially in the Caribbean were, in many ways, being Europeanised and thus civilised. We adopted several aspects of their culture &mdash; their systems of government, their technologies, their sense of order and their languages. In doing this, we discarded those aspects of our culture that clearly placed us at a disadvantage &mdash; like our lack of sense of self, loyalty to the tribe and our non-participation in modern technology.</p>
<p>Although not a believer in any god myself, the Christianity that came with slavery and European control would be of immense value to us black people. Back in Africa, we were preoccupied with the worship of animals, trees, spirits of the dead &mdash; even stones. These primitive religions that we were practising ensured that our ancestors in Africa were backward. The relatively superior Christianity, with its greater sense of order and responsibility would help, in many ways, to pull the black man out of the Stone Age. This could only have happened with slavery.</p>
<p>Our relatively stable societies today, especially in the West, are testaments to the benefits of slavery. While it is true that black Africa has, for the most part, squandered the opportunities that slavery offered in the past, the positive influence of European civilisation cannot be denied. The black nation states of Africa and the Caribbean have given black people a sense of nation, a sense of identity, a sense of order and a sense of purpose &mdash; things we never had before.</p>
<p>While we continue to demonstrate our inferiority in the areas of science and technology, through centuries of being exposed to Europe on account of slavery, we blacks are now aware of the need for us to start excelling in these areas.</p>
<p>Those of us who continue to see the millions of blacks who died crossing the Atlantic and the displacement of what we had in Africa as proof that slavery was a bad institution don&rsquo;t understand the mechanics of human development and evolution. Similar processes had to be endured by countless peoples thoughout history. The development of the human race has always involved the need for change. Slavery was one such means, and like it or not, we blacks are the beneficiaries. It is not for us today to judge the means through which societies have changed in the past.</p>
<p>We blacks were changed, for the better, I might add, on account of slavery. We are a better race today because our ancestors went though slavery. The millions of lives lost were not lost in vain. The Europeans proclaimed the need for us to be civilised through slavery and though this may be hard to understand, they were right. Indeed, based on what is happening in black Africa today &mdash; slavery for us in the West was, in many respects, our salvation.<br>

			<p>Keep Dreaming White people because of your fore parents laziness they choose to use black to feed themselves and to create this kind of world. A world that not even whites are happy with. Blacks are left to remember about being slaves and just like them you are left to bear the burden of being the children of slave owners. Stop acting like they were nice people.We all know that they were really rapist,killers and warmongers and they lacked respect for people of other races. In today&rsquo;s society these kind of people are called criminals. Why is there so much support for them. Do white people like to support criminals. Please stop making the excuse that other races were enslaved because that&rsquo;s nothing to be proud of  </p>

			<p>It is true that whites have enslaved other whites, blacks other blacks, Asians their own as well.<br>
 <br>
It is true that some white slave owners were cruel to their slaves(both black and white) but so were blacks towards other blacks.</p>
<p>I am from Cape Town. I am an Afrikaner who looks white but is called Coloured here in South Africa. My ancestors were French(white) protestants who escaped persecution from the white Queen of France in the 1600s. They sailed on a ship from a Dutch company that set up a city(Cape Town) on the Southern tip of Africa. The Dutch company was not allowed to enslave the local KhoiKhoi(Yellow skinned indigenous Southern Africans)so they brought Asian slaves and Dutch indentured servants(slaves who pay for their freedom)as well as some Black slaves from West Africa. All these peoples intermarried and worked on the wine, wheat and cattle farms around Cape Town and became for the most part a disciplined protestant people known as Afrikaners.<br>
My point: I am descended from white slave owners, white slaves, Asian slaves, Black slaves, and mostly from the indigenous KhoiKhoi(not black) of Southern Africa. <br>
My language  &mdash;  Afrikaans developed mostly from 17th century Dutch but also from Malay, Arabic, French and other African languages.<br>
I&rsquo;m African of mixed ancestry but I am proud of my family&rsquo;s agricultural and disciplined tradition which saw S.Africa become the only true bread basket in Africa due largely to the agricultural tecniques brought by my French,Dutch and Malay ancestors. I&rsquo;m also proud of my KhoiKhoi(indigenous South Africans) ancestors who were pushed into the dry regions of Africa by the Bantu(Blacks)from Central Africa who now claim all of Africa as theirs.  </p>
