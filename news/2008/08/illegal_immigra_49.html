<h1>Illegal Immigrants Returning to Mexico in Record Numbers</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kris Gutierrez, FOX News, August 22, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Illegal immigrants are returning home to Mexico in numbers not seen for decades &mdash; and the Mexican government may have to deal with a crush on its social services and lower wages once the immigrants arrive.</p>
<p>The Mexican Consulate&rsquo;s office in Dallas is seeing increasing numbers of Mexican nationals requesting paperwork to go home for good, especially parents who want to know what documentation they&rsquo;ll need to enroll their children in Mexican schools.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those numbers have increased percentage-wise tremendously,&#8221; said Enrique Hubbard, the Mexican consul general in Dallas. &#8220;In fact, it&rsquo;s almost 100 percent more this year than it was the previous two years.&#8221;</p>
<p>The illegal immigrant population in the U.S. has dropped 11 percent since August of last year, according to the Center for Immigration Studies. Its research shows 1.3 million illegal immigrants have returned to their home countries.</p>
<p>Some say illegal immigrants are leaving because a soft economy has led to fewer jobs, causing many laborers to seek work elsewhere.</p>
<p>Others argue that a tough stance on immigration through law enforcement has spread fear throughout the illegal population.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Advocates for immigrants are disturbed by the trend. Albert Ruiz, an organizer for the League of United Latin American Citizens, agrees that more undocumented immigrants are going home &mdash; but says families are being torn apart in the process.</p>
<p>If a father is deported, Ruiz says, his family members in America are forced either to fend for themselves or follow him to a country where they&rsquo;ve never even lived.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

			<p>Best news I have received in a long time. Maybe the U.S. does have a future after all. I am even willing to rent a few buses if transportation is an issue. I just hope they take their culture, i.e. shanty towns, with them. </p>

I&rsquo;m not buying it. While there may have been a slight increase in returns with the advent of raids and threats of deportations, more are coming than leaving and those here are having multiple babies.</p>
<p>It may be &#8216;record numbers&rsquo; but in relative terms. Let&rsquo;s say every day, one illegal left Texas. The next day, two illegals left Texas. One could legitimately state the numbers of illegals leaving Texas doubled over night. Even so, there are still 1000s of illegals in Texas despite an increase in returns.<br>

<p>Moving to a country &#8220;where they&rsquo;ve never even lived&#8221;?  A single tear trickles silently down my cheek.  Would that be similar at all to the experiences of, oh, 10 million Mexicans and others  who had no apparent trouble moving, illegally, to a country where they had never even lived? </p>
<p><i>&#8220;Others argue that a tough stance on immigration through law enforcement has spread fear throughout the illegal population.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Fear of what?  Presumably of being deported</p>

  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -<br>
Unbelievable, these people will enter the US without any kind of documentation, but they will head to Mexican Consulate offices to get paperwork to go home. And I can understand why the hispanic race-hustlers like Albert Ruiz are up in arms, it kind of puts a damper on their grand plan of taking over through shear numbers. </p>

			<p>Illegal Immigration has been increasing geometrically for <br>
40 years. No we are suppose to believe that 2 years of <br>
increased returns to Mexico is making a difference in the <br>
illegal population here in the USA?</p>

			<p>OK everybody, pay attention to the last comment by Albert Ruiz:</p>
<p>&#8220;If a father is deported, Ruiz says, his family members in America are forced either to fend for themselves or follow him to a country where they&rsquo;ve never even lived.&#8221;</p>
<p>True, but wait a minute - if a Mexican father leaves his family to illegally enter the United States, then the situation is EXACTLY THE SAME: The children must either fend for themselves (in Mexico) or follow him to a country where they&rsquo;ve never lived (America)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the exact same thing!!!</p>

<p>Many times I&rsquo;ve mentioned on this site that we have to fail economically in order to save ourselves, and this is undeniable proof of the accuracy of that claim.</p>
<p>However, our financial situation is still far too good to really discourage but a few to leave.  We really do need to have a severe depression for about five years in order to get most of the rats to leave our sinking ship.</p>

			<p>I take this news with a bit of skepticism.  Hopefully it is true.  If it is true than those of us saying to give Attrition a chance to Work have been proven correct.  I think we really have to wait for the 2010 census numbers to confirm what we think is going on.  If the census numbers for 2010 are lower than projected than attrition is working.</p>
<p>If we only enforced the laws on the books at the state and federal levels we could solve much of the illegal immigrant problem.</p>
<p>Has anyone else noticed an increase in work place raids?</p>
<p>Has Bush finally come to his senses?  The moron had eight years to do something.  After 911 he could have kept the borders closed and revised the entire immigration system, but being a moron he missed that opportunity.</p>
<p>I guarantee you if Obama wins he will try to push through a huge amnesty.  All those Third Worlders are potential voters for Obama in the 2012 election when Obama runs again.</p>

			<p>If 1 million leave, but 3 million enter - then the total number of these dirty Mexicans is still increasing.</p>
<p>Duh!</p>

			<p>Further proof, if any was necessary, that worse is in fact better.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet the illegal aliens who are returning home are former construction workers.  With the housing bubble having burst, construction jobs have become scarce, and they&rsquo;re in a completely different position than a part-time employed American citizen with a working wife, a mortgage paid off and money in the bank.</p>

<p>So when it happens in Mexico, its a legitimate crisis for the government to deal with, but when it happens here, we&rsquo;re told to &#8220;get over it&#8221; and &#8220;stop being racist&#8221;?</p>

			<p>Hmm. Illegal Immigrants returning and enrolling their kids in Mexican schools? <br>
This is worse than I thought. Not only are they sneaking back and forth, but they&rsquo;re educating their US born kids in Mexican culture to strengthen their invasion. By enrolling them in Mexican schools, their kids aren&rsquo;t only US anchor babies, but they&rsquo;re also not assimilating into our society. They are real Mexicans with US citizenship and absolutely no allegeance to the US&hellip;.except they can vote, use our social services when they&rsquo;re here and come and go as they please.</p>
