						<p>Denmark seems set for a heated debate over its immigration rules and obligations as a member of the European Union, after a recent EU ruling on free movement of people in the 27-nation bloc. The ramifications of the ruling by the European Court of Justice, based on a case from Ireland, continued Wednesday to echo in Denmark. </p>
<p>Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen was quoted by the Politiken newspaper as saying that there was a need to clarify that Danish citizens &ldquo;have the same rights as all other EU citizens&rdquo; and that he would consult with other EU countries that also oppose the ruling. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a political responsibility to ensure that a firm and fair policy on immigration is upheld,&rdquo; the premier said. </p>
<p>Rasmussen has headed a minority government consisting of his Liberal Party and junior partner, the Conservatives, since 2001. </p>
<p>The government has relied on support from the Danish People&rsquo;s Party that has strongly influenced tighter immigration policies. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It has to be stated that Denmark determines its immigration policies,&rdquo; Pia Kjaersgaard, leader of the EU sceptical Danish People&rsquo;s Party, told the Jyllands-Posten newspaper. </p>
<p>One controversial principle includes that Danish citizens are not allowed to bring a foreign spouse into the country unless both partners were aged 24 or more. </p>
<p>The Luxembourg-based court ruling July 25 said that anyone with legal residence in the EU should be able to live in any member state with their spouse and children, suggesting that the Danish principle may come under question. </p>
<p>The Danish People&rsquo;s Party has now signalled it wants a say over EU matters, indicating a tougher ride for Rasmussen. </p>
<p>The premier has so far sought deals on EU issues &mdash; most recently on the Lisbon Treaty &mdash; with the opposition Social Democrats, Social Liberals and Socialist People&rsquo;s Party. </p>
<p>In a separate development, Kjaersgaard, 61, was Wednesday taken to hospital after she complained that she felt unwell.<br>

			<p>This is why I tell people not to invest long term in the euro&hellip;.as the EU is not long for this world.  The problem, in a nut shell, is immigration.  You have several wealthy white nations surrounded by pathetic failures created by non-whites.  The sole reason these loser countries join the EU is to exploit it.  Initally, this is covered up but, over time, becomes more and more obvious.  The real catalyst is the systematic violence euphemistically referred to as crime.  After awhile, people have had enough of it.</p>
<p>The EU has a choice.  Either severely restrict the movement of the problem members of their community (or better yet, kick them out of the EU) or alienate the more successful members until they leave.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t be long now until you see a member state choose to leave.  Once one leaves, there will be a stampede for the door.</p>

			<p>So the EU wants to interfere with Denmark&rsquo;s independence. And recently AR has been posting the stories about World Court meddling with the Texas execution of a Mexican killer. All treaties &amp; entities like the EU &amp; NAFTA truly are part of a plan to destroy nationhood. </p>

			<p>A slightly tangential point, but it&rsquo;s on the subject of EU law, specifically The Hague.  If anyone hasn&rsquo;t seen the Milosevic trial, they should click the link below.  I was horrified, although, in a world of lies and propaganda, it contains a reason for hope in the human condition: a &#8216;witness&rsquo; bribed by the West to lie, unexpectedly tells the truth - even though it means a prison sentence.  My bet is Karadzic, like Milosevic, will not live to the end of his trial.  This, my friends, is the new European Soviet.</p>

			<p>The actual citizens (as opposed to the political elites who foisted it upon them)of the EU&rsquo;s captive states,must wake up and realise that the EU is constitutionally profoundly undemocratic and has the makings of nasty, intolerant dictatorship.</p>

			<p>This represents EVERYTHING that is wrong with the EU. The EU SHOULD be about trade and commerce, not deciding what the immigration policy of Denmark should be (if Denmark should even have an immigration policy).</p>
