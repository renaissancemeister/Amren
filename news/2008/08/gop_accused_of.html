						<p>Immigration is having an impact on congressional campaigns across the country &mdash; from Ohio to North Carolina &mdash; and more will follow, according to political analysts and experts on both sides of the immigration debate.</p>
<p>In Ohio, Republican Fred Dailey hopes to upend freshman Rep. Zack Space, D-Dover, by challenging him on the immigration issue.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Republicans like Dailey will try to use immigration as a wedge issue in 2008, predicted Frank Sharry, president of America&rsquo;s Voice, an immigrant advocate group that is monitoring political campaigns. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re hoping that by talking tough and trying to define Democrats as soft (on illegal immigration), that it will mobilize more of their base and maybe even win swing voters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sharry believes the strategy will not work and will also alienate Hispanics, a key voting bloc in many congressional districts.</p>
<p>But Roy Beck, president of Numbers USA, a group that advocates lower levels of immigration and stronger border controls, said illegal immigration &mdash; and its economic impact &mdash; remains a top concern in many districts, especially those where Democratic freshmen represent conservative areas.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But immigrant advocates say using immigration as a wedge isn&rsquo;t always successful. They point to the defeat earlier this year of Republican Jim Oberweis in a special election to replace former House Speaker Dennis Hastert, who retired. Oberweis focused heavily on illegal immigration, saying in a television ad that &ldquo;illegal aliens are coming here to take American workers&rsquo; jobs, drive down wages and take advantage of government benefits such as free health care.&rdquo; Oberweis lost to Democrat Bill Foster, but is running again for the seat.</p>
<p>Sharry said immigrant advocates and Hispanic groups will be closely monitoring campaign ads and literature from across the country to expose anything they deem racist or xenophobic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sneaky hand of the nasty mailer will be uncovered much more quickly in the Internet age,&rdquo; he said.<br>

			<p>Who cares what the democrats accuse anyone of involving illegal immigration. They should just be accused back that they, the democrats are trying to destroy the nation with open borders. I think most Americans, democrats or republicans would relate to that message. We know the democrats are clueless on illegal immigration, and those who aren&rsquo;t clueless are traitors. That&rsquo;s a given. What Republicans need to do is get on their representatives and stay on them. They have been a large part of the problem. The rinos and neo-cons.</p>

			<p>Here in North Carolina it&rsquo;s the Democrat who has attacked republican Elizabeth Dole on immigration. While the ad just said Dole has failed on immigration, the ad implied that she is too soft on immigration.  </p>

			<p>Yea, you morons forgot to mention CHRIS CANNON of Utah! He got WIPED on this issue, and he was a big fish! Why not do some un-bias reporting for your pet causes/fantasy utopia of ignorance,poverty, disease and crime you wish to inflict on America? The &#8216;diversity train&rsquo; is slowing down, and will end with a bad economy. These illegals are a drain on middle class America. Why don&rsquo;t you all immigrate, illegaly, to South America and try your phony left wing policies out on the whites who run those countries? </p>
<p>Oh look, even Brussels is getting in on the &#8216;Italian train&rsquo;? Yehaw, keep it up Europe!</p>

			<p>One of the great ironies of a story like this is that the GOP candidate for president, John McCain, is every bit the open-borders fanatic that the Democratic candidate, Barack Hussein Obama, is.</p>
<p>That said, in some of the downticket races, there are at least SOME Republican candidates who understand that amnesty for illegal aliens (largely Mexicans, Guatemalans, and El Salvadoreans) would be devastating to not only the American economy, but the traditional American way of life.</p>

			<p>Sharry said immigrant advocates and Hispanic groups will be closely monitoring campaign ads and literature from across the country to expose anything they deem racist or xenophobic.</p>
<p>What groups is he talking about here  &mdash;  such innocent ones as La Raza (the race), and countless other clearly racist hispanic organizations?</p>
<p>Immigration will be an issue in the next election and it damn well should be.  How is it racist to insist that one&rsquo;s country&rsquo;s borders are policed?  How is it racist to deport illegal aliens instead of supporting them with hard earned tax dollars and instate tuition?  These people live in an imaginary world where their own racism is somehow projected onto anyone who does not agree with their absurd views.<br>
The more Americans learn or are allowed to learn about the current massive invasion of their country by illegals, the more the issue of &#8220;immigration&#8221; will become an election issue.  Every time in the last year that the pro-open borders lobby has attempted to sneak through an amnesty, it has been defeated because of the calls of ordinary Americans to their representatives.<br>
The issue of immigration will loom all the larger as the US recession deepens and more, primarily low skilled, Americans lose their jobs to illegal Mexicans who will work for slave wages.  This applies to more skilled workers and professionals as well, but not to the same degree.  &#8220;Immigration&#8221; as it currently exists is rapidly destroying this country.  If such a threat were not an election issue, elections would be meaningless.</p>

			<p>Republican don&rsquo;t know how to go for the throat when they&rsquo;re in danger of being extinguished.</p>
<p>Racist black and Hispanic groups are in abundance.  If Republicans would highlight the Jeremiah Wright hate and his hateful congregations and the untold millions around the country where anti-white rhetoric is common, it would help keep this black racist from the presidency.</p>
<p>And if they would just tell it like it is as often appears on this forum about racist mestizo groups they could win in many districts as well.  They have to point out that Democrats support these people.  Most Republicans do not.  They have to press hard and let the people know that if they don&rsquo;t like Hispanic racism they don&rsquo;t want to support people who will work to make it worse.</p>
<p>Being aboveboard, calm, with a reasoned argument, has its place, but not in politics where passion rules.  The emotionless manager/Republican types have caused their own downfalls by allowing themselves to be placed in check by their leaders and the corporate greed mongers.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re either going to have to act like non-white Democrat politicians or they&rsquo;re history.</p>
<p>Right now we have to go with the Republicans because this system is so corrupt it&rsquo;s almost impossible to start an independent party that&rsquo;s full of fire and determined to win.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Sharry said immigrant advocates and Hispanic groups will be closely monitoring campaign ads and literature from across the country to expose anything they deem racist or xenophobic.&#8221;</p>
<p>So if feckless wretches like this Comrade Sharry are so sure that &#8220;immigration&#8221; is a &#8220;wedge issue,&#8221; why must they monitor anything?</p>
<p>Besides, who are they to deem anything &#8220;xenophobic,&#8221; let alone &#8220;racist?&#8221;</p>
<p>Who gives them exclusive &#8220;rights&#8221; here?</p>
<p>Moreover, if the Red parasites and Marxist traitors are so sure &#8220;the strategy will not work and will also alienate Hispanics, &#8216;a key voting bloc in many congressional districts,&rsquo;&#8221; then why even bother with these gregarious and genial shenanigans?</p>
<p>I will tell you why?</p>
<p>They are terrified, utterly and (dare I say) hopelessly terrified, that Comrade Obama is singular walking and pontificating example of what they are about; like the &#8220;Day Without Immigrants&#8221; or the &#8220;Million Man March&#8221; before it, but with just that little &#8220;touch&#8221; of the personal and incidentally edifying!</p>
<p>I personally believe, that the Republicans may very well get the US House back, if they can rediscover their white constituencies; and of course if they can consolidate them in 2010?</p>
<p>Well, I am not a Sybil or Merlin, so what more to say?</p>
<p>God let it be so, sounds good to me!!!</p>

			<p>I work for an American government contracting company in Iraq and I just got an e-mail this morning about the company&rsquo;s obligation to make good faith efforts to hire woman and minorities. The company already has a number of capable women but no blacks to my knowledge and it looks like that may end soon. Totally disheartening.</p>

			<p>In South Carolina they have the curious situation where the Democratic nominee, <br>
Bob Conley, is running for the Senate to the right of the Republican incumbent, Lindsey Graham.  Graham voted for the illegal  alien amnesty, which Conley opposes.  Conley voted for Ron Paul in the primaries, which is definitely a mark in his favor.  If I were in South Carolina I&rsquo;d actually vote for the Democrat.</p>

			<p>The problem with a third party is that before long, it would also be pandering to the diversitoids and trying to buy votes by promising them taxpayer-funded goodies.  No progress can be made in this respect without eliminating the income tax that enables the federal government to play Santa Claus with our money.  Unfortunately, no mainstream party will junk the income tax system, which leaves us in a Catch-22.  The only real solution will be involve Civil War Two as a prerequisite, which will break both the socialist political parties we call the Democrats and Republicans and the tax-collection system that sustains them.  Nobody has ever had a civil war in a nuclear-armed country.  It should be interesting.<br>

			<p>&#8220;But immigrant advocates say using immigration as a wedge isn&rsquo;t always successful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Boy, these advocates sure are dull AND liars. Let&rsquo;s look at it rationally. If I supported illegal immigration (or mass immigration), I would obviously support the immigration pandering dem over the anti illegal immigration candidate. And if I truly beleived a platfrom of stopping illegal immigration was a sure loser (which is total bunk), I would encourage the pro immigration candidate to take advantage of this and not openly tell the challenger his platform is a loser. Because even if I managed to sway the anti illegal immgrants candidate to change platforms, I would never trust him on the issue if elected. So these illegal alien supporters know the issue is a sure winner and are trying everything they can to stifle it from becoming an issue in the first place. They are getting desperate and it shows. maybe, just maybe, a new dawn is occurring in America. I can hoep anyway.</p>

			<p>Remember, income tax withholding was the idea of &#8220;libertarian&#8221; Milton Friedman.  Withholding is the glue holding the transfer state together&hellip;He listened well to his master&rsquo;s voice&hellip;I believe he was a skiing buddy of Ken Galbraith.</p>
<p>btw  I was reading a mag about twenty years ago, in a tire shop.  Galbraith was interviewed, and said:  &#8220;Ever since I started to advocate interventionism (more government in economy), I have never been at loss for any material want.&#8221;  He owned a chalet in Switzerland, where it is unheard for foreigners to have more than a 49% interest in property.</p>
<p>Both whores&hellip;</p>
