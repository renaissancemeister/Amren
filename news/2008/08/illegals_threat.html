						<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Remember? In [Jonathan] Swift&rsquo;s satire, a traveler named Gulliver finds himself in Lilliput, surrounded by a race of people universally 1/12 his size. Though he wishes them no harm, and in fact is quite friendly toward the little people, his size intimidates them. So they conspire to get him drunk and lying on the ground &mdash; at which time they crawl all over him, staking him to the ground with countless little ropes. And when he comes to, he&rsquo;s helpless.</p>
<p>You may not yet get the connection. But here are recent facts, revealed by none other than the Los Angeles Times, the truth teller in one of America&rsquo;s unofficial &#8220;sanctuary cities&#8221; for illegal aliens.</p>
<p># 40 percent of all workers in L.A. County (10.2 million people) are working for cash and not paying taxes. This is because they are predominantly illegal immigrants working without a green card.</p>
<p># 95 percent of warrants for murder in Los Angeles are for illegal aliens.</p>
<p># 75 percent of people on the most wanted list in Los Angeles are illegal aliens.</p>
<p># Over 2/3 of all births in Los Angeles County are to illegal alien Mexicans on Medi-Cal, whose births were paid for by taxpayers.</p>
<p># Nearly 35 percent of all inmates in California detention centers are Mexican nationals here illegally.</p>
<p># Over 300,000 illegal aliens in Los Angeles County are living in garages.</p>
<p># The FBI estimates half of all gang members in Los Angeles to be illegal aliens from south of the border.</p>
<p># Nearly 60 percent of all occupants of HUD properties are illegal.</p>
<p># 21 radio stations in L.A. are Spanish speaking.</p>
<p># Of 10.2 million people in L.A. County, 5.1 million speak English, 3.9 million speak Spanish.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Add to those some more recent stats:</p>
<p># Less than 2 percent of illegal aliens are picking our crops, but 29 percent are on welfare.</p>
<p># Over 70 percent of the United States&rsquo; annual population growth (and over 90 percent of California, Florida, and New York) results from immigration.</p>
<p># 29 percent of inmates in federal prisons are illegal aliens.</p>
<p>Are you beginning to see why I can&rsquo;t get the story of Gulliver out of my mind?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t we Americans, uniquely generous and welcoming and compassionate toward those less fortunate, see that our generosity is being horribly abused, that our economy is being overwhelmed, that whatever benefits might have derived from crop pickers and day laborers and kitchen workers have long since been washed away by an avalanche of the illiterate, the unskilled, the dependent, and the even the violent and criminal?</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t we see that, like the drowsy Gulliver, we must rouse ourselves &mdash; quickly and decisively &mdash; and tear away any restrictions to the observance of our laws? That regardless of any cost economically, near or long term, we must root out all who are here illegally, and insist that they become Americans the old-fashioned way, legally and responsibly? And if they&rsquo;ve committed crimes, in addition to illegal entry in the first place, they be deported immediately, out of our prisons and off our taxpayer support, and never allowed to return?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Look, millions of us really care about a dad sneaking in to make money for his family, about a poor woman bringing a child for hospital care, about a responsible teen hoping for some kind of future. Question: How many can come move in to your house, at your personal expense? Isn&rsquo;t there some kind of limit to what even caring people can shoulder, all at once? Responsible legislators can enact rules allowing for us, the overburdened taxpayers, to cooperate with foundations and pro bono medics to help the most needy without completely dissolving all laws and saying Come one, come all!</p>

			<p>I just wish that more prominent Americans had as much courage as Mr Boone. I believe that a whole lot of them are on our side, but they are just too afraid to come out and say it.They are scared stiff of the Race Card being hurtled at them by all of the loudmouthed Mexupremicests. I am hoping that just a few of them would follow his lead.</p>

			<p>Wow - what a great article!  This should be required reading for anyone who votes this year.  </p>
<p>No wonder whites are flooding out of California at break-neck pace - who wants to stay and be taxed to death for the illegal hordes??  Paying income taxes in LA County is clearly a sucker&rsquo;s game.  </p>

			<p>The US has been the super power that has helped keep civil order in much of the world.  Yes there have been some bad foreign policy actions.</p>
<p>But overall, America stood for justice and freedom.  A great country.</p>
<p>In the past 40 years of corrupt politicians and greedy corporations combined with gullible, fat and appathetic whites, we are truly on a downward spiral to chaos.  The Mad Max movies come to mind when I think of the future.  It is gonna get ugly.</p>

			<p>I also remember a tale I heard as a kid about a hen who asked for help in plowing, sowing, tending and harvesting her wheat crop to which she was told &#8220;not I&#8221; by her friends, but, when it came time to eat the products of her toil, everyone wanted a meal for free. We have for too long worked as slaves to pay taxes to feed, house, clothe and give medical care to people who will not work to put somthing back into the kitty from which they feed like swine. These people are like vampires that feed off the host till they are drained and dieing and then move on to another victim. The problem is that they have bled the system dry and the blood banks are empty, so now we all will die unless we throw these criminal illegal aliens from our lands, by force if need be and put an end to this welfare state that takes from people who will work and gives to people who won&rsquo;t! </p>

			<p>Look at Los Angeles in the 1930&rsquo;s, 40&rsquo;s 50&rsquo;s.60&rsquo;s<br>
Blue sky, snow covered mountains, beaches, orange groves. Streets and highways that were uncrowded. Modest middle class white Americans with full employment in American industries and whose only direct connection with crime was watching a Hollywood gangster movie wotj George Raft, or Bogart. </p>
<p>Look at Los Angeles now. A third world jungle. Air filthy, orange groves long gone, graffitti and gang slogans everywhere,<br>
infrastructure collapsing. The middle class replaced by super rich behind gated communities  and the teeming hordes of the permanently poor. Jobs gone replaced by minimum wage service industries, schools worse than useless. Whites replaced by illiterate mestizos. <br>
The Golden State destroyed in one generation. Thats quite an achievement.<br>

			<p>Look, I was never a Pat Boone fan, but he was always a good guy.  Married to the same woman all his life, never heard anything about bad about him, his wife or kids.  He had a big career years and years ago.  I don&rsquo;t think this article is going to hurt his career, which has really been over for a long time.</p>
<p>Good for him though in speaking his mind.  I&rsquo;m sure there are prominent americans out there who feel and think the same thing but they don&rsquo;t have the guts to say it aloud.</p>

			<p>First of all, where is the confirmation that this is indeed THE Pat Boone?!? I looked and couldn`t find it. Second, before reading this article I was watching Hunington Beach Patrol on reality TV. A woman had lost her child. She was imploring the crowd to pray with her in Spanish. The whole scene and crowd was soooo Third World that I sat there stunned thinking, &#8220;No more need to ever  want to do a Beach Boys pilgrimage&hellip;&#8221; After reading this article I thought maybe THE Pat Boone has either visited Hunington Beach recently or watches LA cop shows like I do too. AS for the poster who predicted his career is finished and he will be forgotton, I would say that his career is already over, (maybe that`s why he spoke up&hellip;) and that as long as &#8220;April Love&#8221; is on the early or late show he will be remembered. More and more wistfully as a contrast to the present in coming years too!!!</p>

			<p>PAT&rsquo;s on the money, illegals are costing L.A. County 1 $billion a year.  However, help is NOT on the way thanks to the success of the Reconquista movement. Latinos are now ensconced in every level of government and are now calling most of the shots regarding the illegal alien issue. Businesses like Home Depot where illegals gather are now being forced to install &#8220;comfort stations&#8221; for the illegals with shelters, toilets and drinking water.  This is because of recent legislation passed.  Huge efforts are also being mounted by the illegals and the people that hire them to do away with the E-Verify system that enables employers to determine if a person seeking a job is legally in the country. This system is 95.5% effective and the check can be made in a nano second.  The main organization attempting to do away with this system is the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.  It is starting to look  like the time is coming when the only thing we can do is to arrange the deck chairs.</p>

			<p>The problem is that Pat Boone is a &#8220;has-been&#8221; in the entertainment industry and his message will reach no further than Newsmax and AmRen.  Until these statistics reach a much larger audience by way of CNN, FoxNews, CBS Evening News, NBC Nightly News, as well as every local 5 and 6 o&rsquo;clock news in every city, the masses will remain sheeple, oblivious to the true criminal nature of these invaders.  By the time &#8220;We The People&#8221; wake up, become aware, then choose to take action (if we ever do), the opportunity to successfully stem the tide will have already come and gone.  Demographics and lack of racial unity are not in our favor at this moment in time.  And should we ever gain racial unity (doubtful), demographics will still have been altered to the point that we will have no chance of getting pro-white politicians elected in numbers necessary to influence national policy in our favor.  Demographically, this nation is a snowball rolling down hill, picking up momentum as we go, and there is no way to get it back to the top.  The weight of that snowball has become too heavy and theres not enough people nor politicians left that are willing to do the heavy lifting, so we roll on towards our demise.</p>

			<p>Way to go, Pat Boone.  Mr. Boone is one of the bravest men in show business.. Years ago, he put out an album of heavy metal songs. He was willing to face ridicule because he thought some of performers in this genre wrote good songs.  It wasn&rsquo;t that bad of an album. I even made a point to one of his real albums to hear what he really sounded like.<br>
    Now he is willing to speak out for America.</p>

			<p>As a leftwinger, I must say that this is a very difficult area for us. Not because the sensible position is not obvious - the only sensible position any sane person can take looking at Boone&rsquo;s essay is that the illegal alien situation is insane and out of control, we need to control the border and get these people out of our country.</p>
<p>The problem is that on the Left it is very difficult to say this. If you do, you&rsquo;re pretty much going to be ostracized by all of your ideological allies. Sure, you can make some new rightwinger &#8220;friends&#8221; on this lonely issue, but they&rsquo;re likely to oppose you in just about every other way. Even sympathetic liberals are terrified to touch the anti-illegal position. You get massacred by everyone on your side.</p>
<p>I think there are some rays of hope. On the SF Chronicle site recently, there were a number of postings from proud SF liberals that said that they had had it up to here with illegals, sanctuary cities, and all of the rest. They drew the line between their &#8220;liberalism&#8221; and what they called &#8220;PC&#8221;, which they viewed as insanity.</p>
<p>Here in California at least, there&rsquo;s going to be no progress on this issue as long as rightwingers own it. The anti-illegal movement has to get friendlier towards liberals. On the other side, there needs to be some space opened up in liberalism for sanity on this issue.</p>

			<p>Jon Voight, now Pat Boone&hellip;and for awhile now, Chuck Norris to a lesser(or milder) extent&hellip;</p>
<p>Hmmm, I know I&rsquo;m probably forgetting one or two other walk-of-fame graybeards that are joining the rumbling chorus of us mad-as-hell patriots who&rsquo;re sounding the call to arms over the Marxist regime, the seige of multiculti-versity that threatens our &#8220;nation&#8221; with death by a thousand cuts.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re hemorraghing badly, but perhaps Voight and Boone and Norris and the scattered remaining tinseltown heroes have seen what&rsquo;s happening to the likes of Brigette Bardot and Mark Steyn, and simply realized that the window of free expression still open here in the U.S. is rapidly closing  &mdash;  so they&rsquo;re starting to make a stand.</p>
<p>God bless &#8216;em.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s hoping their leadership is not in vain. </p>

			<p>Thank you, Pat. We&rsquo;re the same generation and I&rsquo;m glad to see another senior citizen speak out against this travesty. We shovel money out to these unfortunate people, but they still come here. We can&rsquo;t take care of the world, but I&rsquo;m sure most would welcome help in the form of team specialists in all fields of what it takes to run a country. Teaching them to be self-sufficient is far better than just tossing money at the problem. We are trillions of dollars in debt, so do we keep borrowing to give money to violent and corrupt countries such as Mexico? It only goes to the elite/government/drug cartels, which are all one and the same. We need leaders who care more for us than be in the pay of foreign governments, big business and anti-American organizations. We need to seal the border, deport illegals (si,se puede), stop the insanity of the birthright law, demand businesses use E-verify, and stop all benefits. Then, we need to take care of America for a change. Care to run for office, Pat?</p>

<p>One way to counter this is the truth:</p>
<p>-Illegal immigration is another form of slavery. Rather than hire Americans at a fair wage, they use illegals for slave wages in poor conditions. Neocons, who are in with BIG Business, endorse this form of slavery.</p>
<p>-Lack of border and job enforcement has caused the death of illegals trying to get here. This would stop is immigration were stopped.</p>
<p>-Illegal immigration takes jobs from unskilled working poor Americans, especially blacks.</p>
<p>-Illegal immigration is ILLEGAL.</p>
<p>-The US cannot environmentally sustain millions of people coming across our borders. We do not have the electricity and water to take on all of this.</p>
<p>-Mexico has a lot of wealth. The corrupt elitist there must take responsiblity for their own citizens. Not allowing illegal immigration would force the issue in Mexico.</p>

			<p>To:  Fall of the Tyrants   &mdash;   95 percent of OUTSTANDING warrants for murder in Los Angeles are for illegal aliens is probably what the author intended to convey.  </p>
<p>Blacks are famous for killing somebody and then driving the victim&rsquo;s car home and parking it in front of their house.  The police often catch them within 48 hours.  After Hispanics kill, they head for Mexico.  After a couple of months, they come back to the USA, sometimes returning to their previous neighborhood, othertimes they relocate to a different area where they are not known.  No big deal, a new identity only costs them $100.  If &#8220;Marta Gonzalez&#8221; gets an off-the-books job as a housekeeper or nanny and ends up getting a good written reference, that letter of reference will be used by every other female member of the family when applying for jobs.  They will all use Marta&rsquo;s name.  The employer probably won&rsquo;t think to ask for positive ID, because she knows that any ID offered will be fraudulent.  </p>
<p>If you want to be a welfare cheat, the thing to do is to establish MULTIPLE identities and sign up at every county within driving distance.  Get benefits under each identity.  Call me cynical, but what are the chances that these people are going to &#8220;go straight&#8221; even if they are legalized?  Welfare fraud is easy, the &#8220;punishment&#8221; if you are caught is often having your benefits rescinded for six months   &mdash;   if English isn&rsquo;t your first language and you get caught you simply claim ignorance, &#8220;the lady at the office filled out the form for me and then told me to sign it   &mdash;   I didn&rsquo;t realize the information she put down wasn&rsquo;t true.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Some of the biggest abusers of the system are the Asians.  They bring their parents over here, swearing that they will support them without government help, but when the parents arrive they sign them up for every program, including HUD housing, food stamps, and the California programs for medical and DENTAL care.  If the parents have assets, these are hidden back in Korea, etc., or put in the names of the adult children.  There are entire apartment buildings filled with Koreans, etc., as they don&rsquo;t like to share buildings with low-class Mexicans or blacks.  </p>

			<p>As the son of two legal, law-abiding Mexican immigrants, I can  say with great passion that illegal immigration is a slap in the faces of my family, as well as all legal immigrants who cherish their new homeland. My dad, a retired electrician, served with honor in WWII, receiving the Silver Star for combat in Italy, while my mom is a retired nurse. I have always been and always be an American, not a &#8220;Mexican-American&#8221;. This outrageous invasion is only going to get worse, but it could end today if our so-called leaders put our interests first, not those of thieves who hate our guts.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Teaching them to be self-sufficient is far better than just tossing money at the problem.&#8221;<br>

They don&rsquo;t WANT to be self-sufficient. They want to sit back on their fat asses and let the American taxpayer feed, clothe, house, educate, and otherwise support them for the rest of their lives because they made the &#8220;long, hard, dangerous trek across the border&#8221; and got here illegally. Now that they are here they want to be endlessly rewarded for their illegal actions unto the 3rd and 4th generation.</p>

			<p>Of course he&rsquo;s right but this will just be spun as the square white dude without a clue being &#8220;racist&#8221;. Some Latino celeb will rebut and the lemmings will fall in line. So-called activists will protest Mr. Boone holding up signs that say No Person is Illegal. </p>
<p>That is to say anyone with half a brain knows that illegal immigration, let alone mass legal immigration is harmful. The positive here is that the internet leads the way with the obvious truth getting out, Newsmax, Vdare, Amren, and many other sites and blogs are hopefully the wave of the future. </p>

			<p>  Isn&rsquo;t this the home state of Nancy Pelosi, Barbara Boxer and Diane Feinstein? I&rsquo;d like to know what these politicians are doing about this. I know. They&rsquo;re figuring out ways to bring more benefits to the illegals. These useless, poor excuses for white people should be thrown out as soon as possible. In all honesty, who, with a straight face can say these three have done anything good for the country? They&rsquo;ve made it worse!</p>

			<p>&#8220;The Golden State destroyed in one generation.  Thats quite an achievement.&#8221;</p>
<p>That &#8220;achievement&#8221; was made possible by the belief in racial equality and &#8220;civil rights&#8221;.  If you believe in racial equality, how can you morally oppose the mass immigration into this country of millions of non-whites.  After all, they&rsquo;re &#8220;equal&#8221;, it couldn&rsquo;t possibly have any effect on the future of the United States, or any other white country, ect., ect.  In fact, it is the belief in racial equality that is the chief pychological weapon being used against us.  And its working; just look at the results:  a people, who should be fighting tooth and nail for OUR nation, are almost totally paralised.<br>
If we were a people with any self-respect, we would not have let millions of aliens into our country, no matter what our so-called &#8220;government&#8221; wanted.  But belief in the lie of racial equality has robbed us of that self-respect.</p>
<p>Americans like to think of themselves as independent thinkers; it is hard for them to realize that they have been brainwashed.</p>

			<p>Look at Los Angeles in the 1930&rsquo;s, 40&rsquo;s 50&rsquo;s.60&rsquo;s<br>
Blue sky, snow covered mountains, beaches, orange groves. Streets and highways that were uncrowded. Modest middle class white Americans with full employment in American industries and whose only direct connection with crime was watching a Hollywood gangster movie wotj George Raft, or Bogart. </p>
<p>Look at Los Angeles now. A third world jungle. Air filthy, orange groves long gone, graffitti and gang slogans everywhere,<br>
infrastructure collapsing. The middle class replaced by super rich behind gated communities and the teeming hordes of the permanently poor. Jobs gone replaced by minimum wage service industries, schools worse than useless. Whites replaced by illiterate mestizos. <br>
The Golden State destroyed in one generation. Thats quite an achievement.</p>

			<p>Yup, it&rsquo;s THE Pat Boone. Here&rsquo;s Newsmax&rsquo;s blurb on him: &#8220;Pat Boone, great-great-grandson of Daniel Boone, has had a public career now spanning half a century. Boone has been a top-selling recording artist, the star of his own hit television series, a movie star, a Broadway headliner, and a best-selling author. Read some of Pat Boone&rsquo;s important commentaries on NewsMax.com&#8221;. <br>

<p>That&rsquo;s awesome. And it&rsquo;s so true. And it&rsquo;s really about more than just race, but race is part of it. It&rsquo;s about the displacement and replacement of us, the native Californians, by invaders and foreigners, in a tidal wave over the past 30 years. No other sane and self-respecting people would ever put up with this. We had Mexicans, Asians and even some Blacks back then, but in my circles, they were all middle-class and assimilated and no problem. Everyone was an American. No one spoke a foreign language. All signs were in English. It&rsquo;s like the Invasion of the Body Snatchers here in California. It feels really weird.</p>

I&rsquo;m considerably less sure. I imagine he might have some good credentials with them that he can fall back on. <br>
  <br>
At least he has finally opened his eyes so see SOME of the problem.  Thank goodness!  But, oh boy, has he been blind to all the rest of it for all these many years.</p>
<p>Indeed, not only that, but he has been an  intimate collaborator with the  Hollywood &#8220;in crowd&#8221;  and with the &#8220;establishment&#8221; that has brought about all of this.</p>

			<p>Robert Lindsay, getting friendlier towards liberal progressives as a solution towards the never ending flow of illegal aliens in California, is a losing proposition. You sound like a man who really doesn&rsquo;t beleive what he&rsquo;s saying. When you have a situation in California, that literally will result, if not stopped cold(perhaps it&rsquo;s too late already)in a &#8220;Quebecization&#8221; of the State by Mexico, then fooling around with notions about what to do to &#8220;please&#8221; or assuage the feelings of liberals on the issue of illegal aliens in the State, is nuts. </p>
<p>Anyone who has lived in California for a long time, as I have, saw and heard what happened when the Republicans dominated the state in the 1940&rsquo;s,1950&rsquo;s and part of the 1960&rsquo;s. Great Universities were built, vast freeways were constructed, bridges, wide roads, and fantastic suburbs, with a safe environment were created, along with community colleges to serve those suburbs. There was a relatively high standard of living. California was the envy of the rest of the U.S. Indeed, it was famous around the world.</p>
<p>In fact, it is no exxageration to say that everything still good about the state was engineered by Republican Administrations. But now? Robert, I don&rsquo;t mean to offend you, but trying to change the liberal ideology that people like Dianne Feinstein, Barbara Boxer, and countless other liberals in California have, that has brought the State to this disastrous point, is futile. If these people won&rsquo;t admitt the damage they have done, and can&rsquo;t see it with their own eyes, then trying to dance around issues on illegals and illegal immigration to please these dolts, is hopeless. Better to change party affiliation than to try and change these idiots.</p>
