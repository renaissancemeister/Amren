						<p>The loss of white non-Hispanics is causing Broward&rsquo;s population to shrink.</p>
<p>In a report being released Thursday, the Census Bureau showed Broward&rsquo;s population fell by about 13,100 &mdash; 0.75 percent &mdash; between 2006 and 2007, the largest loss statewide and Broward&rsquo;s first drop in population since 2000. Miami-Dade&rsquo;s population jumped slightly &mdash; about 0.45 percent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Perhaps no surprise, demographers cited the Sunshine State&rsquo;s high cost of living and bleak housing market as twin culprits for the population decline. In Broward, the loss of white non-Hispanics doesn&rsquo;t appear to have been compensated by other groups.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the same time, the county&rsquo;s white non-Hispanic populations fell below 50 percent in 2006 and dropped even lower last year.</p>
<p>The number of white non-Hispanics has been falling in Broward since 2005. But in the past, those drops have been canceled out by increases in blacks and Hispanics.</p>
<p>One demographer speculated that Broward&rsquo;s population change could stem from an aging out of its eldest population &mdash; white non-Hispanics, the result of a large wave of retirement in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. There were approximately 15,000 deaths in Broward between July 1, 2006, and July 1, 2007.</p>
<p>That combined with the possibility of fewer births among white non-Hispanics, which would result in a negative net natural growth for that group, or when more people die than are born.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>However, with 1.76 million people, Broward still has about 137,000 more people than it did in 2000.</p>
<p>Miami-Dade County still ranks among the nation&rsquo;s top counties for highest percentage of minorities &mdash; with roughly 82 percent of its residents identifying as such in 2007. Only the Bronx in New York City has a higher percentage of minorities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At some point, we&rsquo;ll stop thinking of Hispanics as a minority and understand that in Miami-Dade County they are certainly a majority,&rdquo; Ogburn said.</p>
<p>The number of white non-Hispanics in Miami-Dade also continued to drop, falling about 1.4 percent between 2006 and 2007.</p>
<p>However, unlike Broward, the number of black non-Hispanics in Miami-Dade also fell slightly between 2006 and 2007, dropping by about 1 percent, or roughly 4,600 residents.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>However, the drop in non-Hispanic blacks and whites was more than offset by the growing number of Hispanic residents, where the population rose by more than 21,100 &mdash; or by 1.5 percent &mdash; during that same period.</p>

<p>The P-D, which never fails to crusade against &#8220;white supremacy,&#8221; essentially admitted here that you need white people in a given place for it to be prosperous.</p>

			<p>I was born in that once-paradiscal place. My family goes back there one hundred years or more. My parents had the sense and the ambition to get us out, and move to (then) underpopulated, pristine, white central florida-which remained a paradise for a few decades. Now all florida is the third world.<br>
R.I.P. paradise.<br>
Now Colorado, Utah, Nevada, Arizona are the Third World. <br>

We moved from Miami in 1970, and settled in Central Fl. I guess it&rsquo;s all relative, but Since we fled the Cuban chauvanism in &#8216;70, I can&rsquo;t imagine enduring it in the 1980s. My parents, successful businesspeople, saw the writing on the wall. Besides, all their friends were either moving north, or planning it.</p>
<p> When I grew up in idylic coastal central Florida, there were tons of Miami expats. They were great people who made great communities that were clean, safe, afffluent but hardly snobbish, casual, honest, and beautiful. Our cities were not racist, but we had that largely unspoken racial consciousness that people used to call common sense. I sometimes saw T-shirts, worn without the least bit of sheepishness, with the statement: &#8220;Will the last American to leave Miami please bring the flag,&#8221;&hellip;even in the mid 1970s. So what you wittnessed in the 1980s- I consider &#8220;Post-Holocoust.&#8221; </p>
<p>Of course, there was that explosion of Carribbeans that rained on Miami like shrapnel, killing, looting, raping. Liberty City&hellip;We looked at the News broadcasts from our safe places up north, with revulsion and horror. My God, what destruction those carribbean blacks wrought. <br>
Now? I last had the misfortune of visiting South Florida in 2002. It is simply hell on earth.</p>

			<p>I left in 1973 when workers were insisting on Spanish at work and FLNC (I think this is correct) was sprayed over many buildings every morning when I drove to work. It was clearly foreign to me. The Culture was different, the language was rapidly becoming Spanish, and the people were definitely NOT American. I was freightened by the aggressive advancement of men who did not speak English! The City was rapidly becoming what it is today. <br>
The UNITED STATES ARE NO LONGER UNITED by culture, or language.<br>

			<p>I believe we will see more and more of this as time goes on. Whites will move and move further, and the riff-raff will remain behind in a multi-culti hell! Of course the White taxpayer will still be on the hook to suppor this mendicant herd notwithstanding. The USA begins coming apart at the seams here&hellip; </p>

			<p>It will be interesting to see if the newer residents can maintain or increase the tax base. They will need larger and more schools than the largely elderly(and/or in many cases Jewish) population they are replacing.  As the age drops withhin the county, social service and school needs could drive property taxes up, unless assessments and business activities increase.Given the housing market and the lack of experience by the newcomers in building larger businesses, the economic future for Broward might be dim. This was always  a slightly &#8220;higher class&#8221; county than Dade, with more prosperous enclaves and town. Will Ft Lauderdale turn into a rundown urban center or prosper?  Interesting experiment, no?</p>

			<p>Isn&rsquo;t it sad to know that a once-proud superpower has been forced to stand by silently while it is invaded and colonized from the south? I think of all the wars we&rsquo;ve won, the great country whose merchandise bore the label, &#8220;Made in America,&#8221; a country whose children were the best and brightest and whose freedom was the envy of the world, and so many other things that made us number 1. Now, we are headed toward becoming just another third world nation. For this, we have our own government, anti-American organizations, big business and misguided churches to thank. Have they ever thought that when we are gone, there&rsquo;ll be no one to take care of the scavengers?</p>

			<p>We lived in Hollywood, FL from 92 to 2002. Our great little neighborhood went from 100% white to 90% hispanic/black during that time. What was a very nice, clean, quiet, friendly neighborhood changed to a Caribbean junkyard. Yards overgrown, junk laying out, chickens being kept as pets, obnoxious loud noise at all hours, robberies, stolen cars, and break-ins.. </p>
<p>We were fortunate to get out during the beginning of the housing bubble so we were able to leave with our investment and more. I was recently in that area on business and drove through the old neighborhood. Now after the housing bust it is even worse with abandoned and boarded up houses (including our old house).</p>

			<p>I took a job in Miami back in 2002 and just moved away from there this year, thank God.</p>
<p>I really disliked living there.  It had a distinctly Third World feeling about it.  To me, that is the same as having a ghetto feel about it.</p>
<p>I now live in a white enclave in a beautiful place in the Southwest.  What a great feeling it is to back in a culture that feels like it did when I was a kid almost.  Very, very nice.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, places like this enclave will be become fewer and farther between, and will likely be only wealthy communities.</p>
<p>Pity the poor whites that have to live among the Third Worlders.</p>
<p>I hate to say it but only a massive cataclysm on the scale of ethnic war can turn the tide.  I wish the traitors and multicultist liberals in politics, academia, the media, etc who ushered in this madness would be tried and convicted for the traitors that they are.</p>

<p>That line you speak of gets more and more blurred with every passing year.  South Florida is moving en masse to Central Florida and will probably make significant inroads into the North within a decade.  I lived in Leesburg and we were getting the excess of Orlando&rsquo;s population (not all of it White).  The White flight, congestion, minorities, crime, excessive growth and sprawl turned what used to be a paradise into a crowded increasingly third world h*ll.  I moved 4 years ago and I now live in Johnson City TN and couldn&rsquo;t be happier.  I can&rsquo;t imagine any more elderly retirees continuing to move into the state but I could be wrong.  Someone moving from NY or NJ might think it was heaven on Earth.   </p>

			<p>I moved to S Fl in 1956 at two years old.  As many have already pointed out, it was a paradise.  I left in 1980 after what was called the Liberty City riots.  Living in N Fl gave me and my new family real peace.  But it is now ending.  Anyone who lives anywhere in Fl will tell you that this is a dying state.  The weight of huge numbers of non-white immigrants requiring services and yet, offer little in the manner of payment for those services is almost at a breaking point.  While there was some type of imaginary line that once separated S and N Fl there is a vanguard of an invasion of Mexicans now taking over small and medium towns in N Fl.  In conversations with my family we are discussing what to do at this moment that will ensure our children will have decent lives free from the fear of crime and any number of undesirable circumstances.  The sad thing is that I cannot come up with a viable plan because you will find that after conducting some simple research Fl, Calif, and other well known, troubled portions of our country are no longer the exceptions.  So moving somewhere else is just forestalling the eventual.  Our beautiful heritage is being strangled to death in every corner of this nation. </p>

			<p>South Florida has 5 times the violent crime and AIDS rate of north FL  &mdash;  -so. FL is also heavily &#8220;minority&#8221; populated; Miami is supposedly the poorest city in the U.S. &#8220;Welcome diversity&#8221; we were repeatedly told, even banners in school, here in north FL. Now our kids are forced to learn Spanish by our schools.<br>
   American citizens in so. and now central FL can&rsquo;t get or keep jobs if they don&rsquo;t know Spanish! So much for tolerance and diversity!!! Our gov&rsquo;t. doesn&rsquo;t come to their aid (as victums of discrimination).</p>

			<p>I`m surprised anyone is left there with a white skin and a clean rap sheet. The effluent from Dade and Broward has oozed all over Central Florida, turning us into Compton East. People in Fort Lauderdale are told that if they blow a tire on  Inter State 95 to keep driving on the rim until finding a sanctuary ramp, one with an open gas station or better yet a police sub station. The cops may get to you in about 5 minutes if you stop in the emergency lane or two minutes after the road pirates.<br>
     Black teens rampage from Palm Beach to Marathon, turning Route 1 and I-95 into roads resembling the main drag from the air port to Baghdad. All white people who intend to vote for the Kenyan-American should be required to spend 2 hours in an Inter-state traffic jam near Pompano and in Down Town Fort Lauderdale when the power goes out at night.<br>

			<p>I live in Palm Beach County, but my family has a place on the beach in Broward County. Palm Beach County has pockets of minorities, some large, but is still a majority white. Boca Raton for example, is still above 90% white probably as a result of people fleeing Broward and Dade counties. The last holdouts appear to be the condo&rsquo;s on the beach, which remain solidly white. Most of the riff raff in Broward do not live near the beach and towns like Lauderdale-by-the-Sea are clean and safe. How long that will last is anyones guess, but with the boomers due to retire soon and inherit a lot of those places, it appears to be safe for a while. Still, the beach towns are the last white holdout in southern Florida surrounded by the third world. It&rsquo;s tragic what our government has done to this country. </p>

<p>This would never be allowed. The only way is to stop 3rd world immigration,legal or illegal and for whites to stop selling their homes and fleeing when 3rd worlders try to move in. Most 3rd worlders prefer communities of their own so if whites don&rsquo;t move, most will go elsewhere.</p>

Once hispanics have overun America third world Spanish will be the predominant language, blacks will be displaced just as the blacks of Brazil, and whites will be neutralized through murder and amalgamation.<br>
America has to wake up and realize there is no future for white American&rsquo;s and their is nothing we can do about it unless we move quickly and work togeather.<br>
