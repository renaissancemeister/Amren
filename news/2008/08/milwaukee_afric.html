						<p>The annual Milwaukee World African Festival has been canceled. The festival blends &#8220;African and African American cultures.&#8221; However, with the festival becoming more violent each year, sponsors don&rsquo;t want to come back. On previous years &#8220;African American&#8221; gang violence and rampant thefts have made people afraid to return. The festival has been canceled this year for lack of sponsors.</p>
<p>Across the nation, black or &#8220;African American&#8221; themed expos, festivals, reunions, ect. are plagued with worse violence each year.<br>

															<h2>African Festival Is Too Important to Lose</h2>
											<p>
							<i>Eugene Kane, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, July 19, 2008</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>Is this the end of African World Festival?</p>
<p>Teju Ologboni, a founding organizer of Milwaukee&rsquo;s only African-American festival on the Summerfest grounds, has no doubts the event will return to the lakefront next year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ologboni was adamant about the return of the festival because he realizes its importance not only for local black people, but for Milwaukeeans in general.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a city that&rsquo;s nearly 40% black, not having a festival for African-Americans just like all the other ethnic festivals in town would be a particularly telling omission. Even with Juneteenth Day a long-standing tradition on the north side, African World Festival stood alone as a symbol of inclusion for the city&rsquo;s festival schedule.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some may actually breathe a sigh of relief there&rsquo;s no African World Festival this year. With escalating violence in some parts of the central city, there was sure to be speculation about the possibility of black-on-black violence and gang activity this year. It would not be the first time that was an issue.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, gunfire at the festival threatened to ruin its future. One young suspect arrested for firing a gun at the festival in 1998 actually apologized from his jail cell because he realized his actions had marred what was essentially a positive event for the black community.</p>
<p>There were little or no problems with violence in ensuing years.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There are other black institutions in Milwaukee in financial straits, including America&rsquo;s Black Holocaust Museum. The economy is bad for everyone, but it has grave impact on groups that have never enjoyed much financial prosperity to begin with.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hopeful there will be an African World Festival next year, because it&rsquo;s too important not to have one. It represented black Milwaukee&rsquo;s claim to a beautiful lakefront that is a gift to all residents.<br>

			<p>What is it with blacks and violence at what are supposed to be fun positive events. I bet most county fairs in farming country have run dozens of years with nary a hint of violence. Yet blacks, when they congregate, seem to want to shoot up the place or each other. I say cancel it and wait until the entire black community can collectively grow up so these things don&rsquo;t happen. </p>

			<p>oh yes of course they only violence that happened was &#8216;black on black.&rsquo; heaven knows, no poor innocent black person would ever think of committing violence on a big bad white person. of course not!  and yes, the poor young boy who shot up the festival, insuring it would never return.  oh, he didn&rsquo;t mean to, poor thing.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The festival has been canceled this year for lack of sponsors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two people working the corporate sponsor booths at the Juneteenth festival in Minneapolis were hit by stray bullets in June. One was representing a politically correct news station (WCCO I believe) and the other was a major bank headquarters (U.S. Bank maybe). Black people are not diverse. Their behavior is the same everywhere.<br>

			<p>America&rsquo;s Black Holocaust Museum.</p>
<p>What holocaust?  The only holocaust that is associated with blacks is the holocaust they inflict on others.  The ruin they inflict on cities and towns across America is the real holocaust.  I have seen enough to know that every black &#8220;celebration&#8221; on record usually ends with riot police and tear-gas.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;there was sure to be speculation about the possibility of black-on-black violence&#8221; - because black-on-white violence is just fine.  Black on Hispanic violence?  No problem!  Black on Asian violence?  Who cares. It&rsquo;s only a problem, in the eyes of leftists, if their precious blacks get hurt.</p>

			<p>&#8220;It represented black Milwaukee&rsquo;s claim to a beautiful lakefront that is a gift to all residents.&#8221;</p>
<p>But naturally the blacks have claimed it. It&rsquo;s got to be &#8220;diverse&#8221; and they will bring their particularly &#8220;vibrant&#8221; blight as they do everywhere they try to set up their &#8220;cultural centers&#8221;. White people don&rsquo;t want to spend money to watch Africans acting natural, they get far more of it than they want every day just having to live cheek-by-jowl with them.</p>

<p>I AM breathing a &#8220;sigh of relief&#8221;, but not because of &#8220;speculation about the possibility of black-on-black violence&#8221; but of the more likely possibility of black-on-White violence.</p>
<p>Just ask the White man one state over that tried to stand up for and defend his daughter that was groped by some black thug on the Fourth of July festival and was severely beaten for it by a pack of them.</p>
<p>Hopefully by now, Whites have learned to stay away from black-themed events like this one in Milwaukee. It&rsquo;s just a shame that we also have to stay away from general events such as the one on July Fourth&hellip;or risk our own death.</p>

			<p>This reminds me of the &#8220;Ohio Classic&#8221; college football game. This was a game played at Cleveland Browns Stadium betwwen two HSBC teams. It was promoted with great fanfare by the Cleveland Plain Dealer and we were all told how this would become a great Cleveland tradition.<br>
I just couldn&rsquo;t wait to see this great sporting event, and particularly looked forward to the &#8220;battle of the bands&#8221;. Regretably I was unable to attend the only &#8220;Ohio Classic&#8221;, before it was cancelled. No mention of why, but my quess is that &#8220;they be fightin&#8221;.  </p>

			<p>Articles like this one always remind me of my former wife. Driving through New Haven we (her and I) would often have to stop for leviathan black women or groups of black boys and men jaywalking slowly across the street. These pedestrians were either oblivious to the traffic, or they looked challengingly towards the nearest windscreens, just daring anyone to honk or say something so they, the jaywalkers, could vent some of that energy they&rsquo;d saved up from years of low-activity high-calorie living. My ex used to get so mad while we sat in the car and waited for these malcontents to pass.</p>
<p>Waiting, she would hiss about how they (Blacks) seldom tipped her when she was a waitress, or how rude and simpleminded they were.</p>
<p>Not long after New Haven, we moved to Maine, where money was tight but life was better largely because Mainers don&rsquo;t suffer the oppressive multiculturalism foisted on most white Americans.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s remarkable about this story is that my ex-wife, who confided to me that she preferred Maine to New Haven largely because there were no Blacks, would, when engaged in conversation with Maniers always lament the &ldquo;lack of diversity&rdquo; in Maine.</p>
<p>This odd behavior was not particular to her. I&rsquo;ve seen other people do it also. As near as I can figure a large percentage of white people are profoundly suggestible, maybe even crazy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m no psychologist, but I&rsquo;d reckon there is very little difference in an individual&rsquo;s memory of reality vs. their memory of a movie or TV show. One replaces the other, just depending on which memory is more profound or more recent. Be they smart or stupid, violent or even-tempered, people can only work with what they remember. Since TV blacks are great and real blacks are a drag, the more you avoid blacks the more you like them.</p>
<p>It is not a coincidence that America started to decline when TV-reality became ubiquitous.</p>

			<p>A while back, then-mayor Kurt Schmoke (yes  &mdash;  a black guy) excused urban youths running wild along Baltimore&rsquo;s crown jewel  &mdash;  the Inner Harbor, on Easter Sunday. </p>
<p>Apparently, it was a tradition for, as Kurt said, &#8220;high-spirited youths&#8221; to want to show off their spring finery. Sort of like 5th Avenue&rsquo;s Easter parade of yore.</p>
<p>In Baltimore, urban youths also like to cause commotion during any kind of fireworks display at the Inner Harbor. </p>

			<p>This is not something that is new it&rsquo;s been going on for years. I grew up in a small southern town and we didn&rsquo;t have that many blacks. There wasn&rsquo;t that much for teenagers to do in this small town so a couple times a year they would have dances at the school gym. The first night would be the white dance and the second night the black dance. It wasn&rsquo;t segregated but everyone knew how it worked. It always happened that during the black themed dance that blacks from another town would show up and get into it with the local blacks. It could turn out to be more of a riot than a fight.</p>
<p>Once an event or function is labeled as &#8220;Black&#8221; or &#8220;African-American&#8221; they see it as an oportunity just to go wild. That&rsquo;s one of the reasons why we don&rsquo;t need a black president, if blacks assume that another black man is in charge the will loose what little respect they have for the law. </p>

			<p>What they need to do in order to revamp their public image is actually incorporate this random violence into the schedule of the African Festival. </p>
<p>The first night can feature drunken thugs discharging illegally obtained firearms into the air, the second night a stabbing, and on the final night, end the whole thing with a gang rape.</p>
<p>If the corporate sponsors still hesitate, just cry &#8220;racism&#8221; for discriminating against aspects of their vibrant culture, and threaten a boycott/protest march. It&rsquo;s worked many times before after all.</p>

Following WW 2 I lived in housing projects that were built to house returning veterans and their families in the Milwaukee area. Without exception, the goal of White people being housed therein was to get out.</p>
<p>As a kid, riding my bicycle through most of the surrounding area, I never saw any &#8220;Blacks&#8221;. If there were any, they must have had enough self-respect to stay in their own area. The city was a White city then, clean, progressive, orderly and with a low crime rate, despite the tendency of its voters to elect Socialist leaning mayors who furthered &#8220;the social net&#8221;.</p>
<p>The city is now reportedly 40% &#8220;Black&#8221;. Nothing seems to have happened to change the city except for the people who are now living there. I suspect this problem was accelerated when Chicago developed enough sense to blow up their dangerous high rise housing accommodations along the lakefront, causing the &#8220;Blacks&#8221;  to look for greener pastures in other places, such as Milwaukee.</p>
<p>The concept of &#8220;the social net&#8221; works as long as the populace is White. It works less well when the populace is other than White. It is a calamity when it attracts the &#8220;Blacks&#8221; who end up destroying it and, ultimately,  destroying the cities that have such programs.</p>

			<p>Blacks tend to be even more violent under policies of Socialism.<br>
And black violence under socialism tends to be even more widespread.<br>
After decades of black music and television designed to bring a good image to blacks it is time for America to publicly acknowledge the failure of government Socialism and tyranny and give America back to the people by obeying the Constitution!</p>

			<p>I used to like to visit Milwaukee in the summer. Not in recent years though.</p>
<p>Milwaukee has been having a  &#8220;Diversity Fest&#8221;  for years now (or whatever they call it). This &#8220;celebration&#8221; goes on all summer long.   Milwaukee was one of the first cities to get hooked on  this loony cult of Celebrating Diversity.    Mexican Fest. Filipino Fest.  All of that.  It was trendy once.  Now, it&rsquo;s just tired. </p>
<p>AfroMania, or AfroWorld, or whatever, was just one  part of it. This was inevitably bound to happen. Basically, they asked for it. Wherever you get blacks together you have fights, shootings, violence.  I&rsquo;m fed up with Diversity. It&rsquo;s become the cause of all our problems. This is a time when we need less diversity and more unity.    </p>

			<p>Eugene Kane just doesn&rsquo;t get it.  Many poverty-stricken Mexicans have moved into Milwaukee taking what jobs black had and driving down wages for the remaining blacks.  Yet blacks in Milwaukee still dream of a black-brown anti-white alliance.  </p>
<p>The silly twits still haven&rsquo;t figured out that white folks are not going to be there to pay for them now that blacks have invited the Mexican replacements into the city.  </p>
<p>White folks are going to be too busy paying for child care, formula and nappies for the thousands of babies the Mexicans are squirting out in Milwaukee every year, not to mention the Mexican and central American drug gangs.</p>
<p>Eugene, you high yallah, Talented Tenth fool, how long did you figure the white guilt gravy train would last?  Forever?</p>

Sometimes when blacks think whites aren&rsquo;t paying attention, they let the truth slip out.</p>
<p>I was reading an interview in the local black weekly and the man being interviewed made the remark that attendance for this years Juneteenth was down because of the two shootings last year.</p>
<p>Blacks know the truth, they just don&rsquo;t like to admit it.<br>

			<p>A typical debacle that concluded this Milwaukee event was mentioned in AmRen last year.  One poster on here even gave a website where one could view the violence caused by these marauding mobs.</p>
<p>One comment stuck with me: a woman poster said the scene looked just like South Africa or Zimbabwe.  I can not get that image and her words out of my head.  </p>
<p>Every time I see another lethal swarm of African &#8216;youts&rsquo; terrorizing a once-proud city, I realize that in many ways America HAS become Third World in many ways.</p>

			<p>Being from L.A. I have attended a large number of Hispanic festivals and never any problems, even the gang bangers were well behaved. I have never seen any black function that did not end up in violence (or begin that way)no matter what the reason for the &#8220;celebration&#8221; was. </p>

			<p>This reminds me of the Puerto Rican day parade in NYC. Every year on that day the parade area and central park are a no go zone. Local businesses have to board up their storefronts and police double there presence. By the end of the day there has been multiple arrests, garbage above your ankles, and people hosing off all the urine from their doorways. Compare this with the German day parade or St. Patricks day where you can eat off the street and there is virtually no crime. Actually in the summer it has gotten downright ridiculous. Every weekend there is a parade for SOME  group. Thanks multiculturalism.</p>

lol  That&rsquo;s Really what ended the celebration. It&rsquo;s like one of those Vampire movies with Wesley Snipes. You&rsquo;re invited to a &#8216;celebration&rsquo; we just forgot to tell you the celebration is about you. You&rsquo;re the entertainment. And the evening snack.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;What&rsquo;s remarkable about this story is that my ex-wife, who confided to me that she preferred Maine to New Haven largely because there were no Blacks, would, when engaged in conversation with Maniers always lament the &ldquo;lack of diversity&rdquo; in Maine.</p>
<p>This odd behavior was not particular to her. I&rsquo;ve seen other people do it also. As near as I can figure a large percentage of white people are profoundly suggestible, maybe even crazy&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>My wife recently took a one week class in the foothills east of the San Francisco Bay Area. When she came home, she excitedly exclaimed, &#8220;HONEY! They&rsquo;re WHITE people there! They&rsquo;re WHITE PEOPLE!&#8221;</p>
<p>Now I think she understands why I want to move.</p>

			<p><i>A typical debacle that concluded this Milwaukee event was mentioned in AmRen last year. One poster on here even gave a website where one could view the violence caused by these marauding mobs.</i></p>
<p>The film was shot by a hovering news helicopter.  I guess it was just too compelling (or expensive) for the newschannel to censor or suppress.  The most obvious and remarkable thing is that the blacks were walking home from the festival right in the middle of a busy street.  This is one of the thousands of things that distinguish blacks from whites - blacks will do this, whites will use the sidewalks.  Of course, this triggered physical conficts with cautiously-driven cars, which then boost the blacks&rsquo; testosterone into high gear, and they quickly settled into being impulsive, violent, harrassing blacks.  But as the two cool-headed, blow-dried anchorpersons seriously discussed what the copter was showing, neither would ask the obvious question - why are blacks walking home right in the middle of a busy street?</p>

			<p>The African farce-tival will be back as scheduald next year because,  Al Sharptoon and Jessy Jacksun are working to shake down and blackmail the sponsors and vendors into submission. These two blights on humanity will politly ask the sponsors to divy up or face the wrath of boycots, protests and lawsuits if, they don&rsquo;t volunteer to be targets of blacks celebrating, being black, next year. The sponsors will give in, donate an extra dollar or $100,000 to get on their good side, just to get the &#8220;Good Seal Of Diversty&#8221; rating that Al and Jesse are all too willing to deal out for the correct numbers of silver coins to their cause (them) friends and family.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t dispare Millwaukee and other towns that celebrate diversty, the killing and thugery will go on as usual next year and the year after etc, etc, etc.</p>

TV, after all is said and done, does have an on-off switch, a channel block function (cable and satellite subscribers) and a have in my house, do not have in my house option. TV, as we are witnessing now, also has competition on the internet.</p>

Oh, yes. I remember that.</p>
<p>Well, there could be no suggestion that blacks do anything differently from whites, since we all know there is no such thing as race.  Thus, no racial differences.</p>
<p>I believe that blacks walk out in the middle of the street as a gesture of defiance against the laws and all social norms. It&rsquo;s, for them, a revolutionary act.  It&rsquo;s meant to tell the world that wherever they are, they are in charge.  It says, &#8221; FU. This street is MINE.  I&rsquo;ll do what I like.  So what you gonna do about it?   Ya know wha&rsquo;am sayin?&#8221; </p>

			<p>THe spread of Black crime in cities is helped by the termination of inner city housing projects where the criminal element was more concentrated and easier to keep tabs on. See the important Atlantic Monthly article &#8220;American Murder Mystery&#8221;:</p>

			<p>I live in a lively city on the south coast of England.  Its an easy going place, renowned for its high tolerance levels and &#8220;alternative&#8221; people. A couple of years ago, a local club put on an &#8220;R n B&#8221; (ie Hip-Hop) night, which had to be cancelled after a few weeks, because of the number of incidents involving young Black men brandishing guns. Why do they do this?  There had NEVER been any serious gun crime here before, yet as soon as this  this club opened, this happened.  They just cant help themselves, wherever they are.  </p>

This weekend, downtown Toronto hosts the large annual West Indian event called Caribana. </p>
<p>And this Friday and Saturday, large CD stores in the affected area (HMV, etc) close several hours early (8pm). Although you might expect crowds attending a music festival to be a boon for area music stores, experience of previous summers has apparently taught these retailers that staying open normal hours during Caribana means LOSING more product than they sell. </p>
<p>Not to mention the possibility of a rampage through the shop&rsquo;s Reggae section and/or a riot in their Hip Hop section and/or a wilding in their World Music section. <br>

			<p>London, England, has an annual black-fest called the &#8216;Notting Hill Carnival&rsquo; and takes thousands of police and several helicopters to monitor. Same old.. shankins&rsquo;, cappins&rsquo;, steamins&rsquo;, drug busts etc. It is claimed to &#8216;celebrate our cultural diversity&rsquo;. Fortunately it&rsquo;s shown on live TV so those watching at home can celebrate not being there.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Once an event or function is labeled as &ldquo;Black&rdquo; or &ldquo;African-American&rdquo; they see it as an opportunity just to go wild. That&rsquo;s one of the reasons why we don&rsquo;t need a black president, <b>if blacks assume that another black man is in charge the will loose what little respect they have for the law.</b> (Emphasis added.)</p>

<p>This may come back to seriously bite them in the butt. Whites got a glimpse of most blacks&rsquo; attitude problem after O.J Simpson got acquitted, and blacks were seen celebrating it. Indeed, this website and others like it owe a lot to that; Whites started grumbling among themselves when Simpson got off scot-free. (As Vincent Bugliosi has written, &#8220;I refuse to call him &#8216;O.J.&rsquo; &#8220;)(Simpson himself and the news media that covered him have turned &#8220;O.J.&#8221; into a brand name.)<br>

All very true.  But it has to be pointed out that all of this stems from Milwaukee&rsquo;s long-time sponsorship of these  diversity celebrations, thanks to its line of  &#8220;Socialist leaning mayors&#8221; [quoting Ronald at 11:03 PM ].   </p>
<p>Diversity, once colorful and interesting (when white)  has gotten out of control (when black).   When you have China Fest, Mexico Fest, Irish Fest and Polish Fest, then you can hardly refuse an Africa Fest   &mdash;    especially considering that Milwaukee is now 40% black. </p>
<p>Formerly, when these &#8220;fests&#8221; were just ethnic celebrations among white people, they were fun and harmless.  They danced their polkas or their jigs, had a sausage or pizza or a pint, and then went home &hellip;  peacefully.   Now   &mdash;   as always when you bring blacks into the picture    &mdash;   the whole equation has been changed.  With stabbings and violence, it has become dangerous and is no longer family fun.  A good place to stay from!  One more argument for separation.   Let them have theirs, and let us have ours.</p>

			<p>Sorry to hear Gen Con moved, but not suprised, Flyingtiger.  There&rsquo;s nothing like a bunch of peaceful, quiet white convention-goers arriving in a town to spend money and have a good time minding their own business.  I suspect the gaming conventions cause even less trouble for local authorities than Shriner&rsquo;s conventions.  Cities like attracting conventions and trade and professional conferences, because of the huge boost they give to retail sales, and thus sales taxes.  Some city governments don&rsquo;t understand where money comes from, and they end up losing the conventions.</p>

			<p>Here in Texas, when we have our annual &#8220;Juneteenth&#8221; festival where all the blacks celebrate, our city now actually has to put SWAT teams of  armed police offices on the rooftops as well as police armed in riot gear surrounding the event. Why??? Because ever year, there are always a bunch of riots and shootings, that&rsquo;s why. It&rsquo;s a nightmare and everyone knows to stay out of that area while the &#8220;celebrations&#8221; are going on. Last year, a Mexican national didn&rsquo;t know to and was a passenger in a car driving near the festival. His friend&rsquo;s car accidentally bumped a small black girl who ran out in front of it. No injuries but a crowd of blacks followed the car and when the man let his  friend out to go home, the black mob attacked the passenger as he walked to his home and beat him to death. Of course nobody saw nothing. The Mexican newspapers had the headline that the man was lynched but the papers here downplayed it and didn&rsquo;t mention race even though everyone knew the blacks did it. When we have other celebrations here such as St.Patick&rsquo;s Day or &#8220;Wurstfest&#8221;, where it is all white, the only problems are a few disorderly drunks.</p>

<p>This has been going on in big cities, probably, as long as there have been cars. Not the Juneteenth, but whites being assaulted or killed after being involved in a traffic accident with blacks or in the wrong neighborhood. These clippings should be collected somewhere, at the very least by a lawfirm that deals with hit and run accidents. I can&rsquo;t imagine being involved in a hit-and-run. At the same time, I think there are recommended procedures to follow, such as staying in and locking your car, if there&rsquo;s a threat of some kind. </p>

<p>So since there can&rsquo;t be a &#8220;black festival&#8221; in Milwaukee, I guess there can&rsquo;t be an Irish, Plish, China or Mexican festival either. The various groups that enjoy the peaceful festivals will probably be told that their respective festivals will be shut down in the name of &#8220;equality&#8221;. </p>

			<p>When I lived in NYC there were definate places to stay away from; Harlem, the Bronx, etc. Even in one of the most diverse cities of America people tend to segregate and move to the areas where people look like them. I recall visiting the Bronx Zoo a couple of times on Wed. because it was free and I was an artist at the time. I would take the subway uptown and at every stop more and more whites would exit while black faces crowded the train. White families would begin to move closer to each other, it was instinct, while some blacks looked at us with disdain. They would take over the zoo, trash everywhere, gangstas rampant, it did not feel safe. I stopped going.<br>
When real estate was on the rise a few years back, a friend and I considered purchasing an income property in a &#8220;diverse, boderline&#8221; neighborhood in New Jersey that was once upscale. We drove around while blacks would cross the street willy nilly and give us the dirtiest looks when they would see 2 white faces. We even had a couple of them (one was a lady) rush the car yelling obscenities. They knew too well whites would improve the neighborhood, yacking up their rent, and ruining a good thing for them.<br>

			<p>Absolutely right on - my town has a &#8220;Summer nights&#8221; festival for about 14 days  in our civic plaza. For years I was one of the guys in the police department that planned for the crowd control. When the &#8220;African&#8221; night came we had the largest contingent out and the most people on standby waiting to be called out. We always ALWAYS had at least one violent incident involving folks at the gathering. The least violence that required no police respnse? You guessed it &#8220;Nordic&#8221; night and &#8220;Asian&#8221; night&hellip;. go figure. <br>
Due to the amount of overtime spent on the violent nights the &#8220;African&#8221; group cost the taxpayers the most money, as is usual in all their endeavors.</p>

			<p>NYC has it&rsquo;s Puerto Rican Day Parade. Some are decent folks but you get a lot of blacks and black Hispanics coming out to this event and just polluting and groping women. Most whites stay clear of this huge yearly mess. <br>
I remember one year, on the news, as festivities moved uptown, they got out of control and assaulted several women in Central Park. A few people captured it on video. I recall a black female officer was approached by a white woman who was pleading for help while her boyfriend was being held back by black youths. The officer turned away while the youths splashed water on the victim, tore-off some of her clothes and fondled her. She was one of many. That video aired a few times for one day and then it disappeared from the media. Not many people talked about it. If they did it was always &#8220;those kids&#8221; or &#8220;gangsters&#8221; out of control. But everyone KNEW it was racial.<br>
Here is a link to one of the men who was finally arrested:<br>

<p>meanwhile, how about an american fest? Lets ditch all these ethnic festivals.</p>

			<p>Never had much fun with Yrrchs.  Too easy if I can get Rumil Tigersclaw into a high flank position with a bow.  Undead are more fun, since they are immune to critical hits.  I scout out the terrain for the party, and had about 120 mixed undead dead to rights while Rumil was still using a crossbow.  They couldn&rsquo;t get at me, so I wasted them.  As a ranger, Rumil got to pick a first favored enemy, and that was &#8220;undead&#8221;.  I walked Rumil back and told the rest of the party &#8220;all clear.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the battle of Lith My&rsquo;athr, my friend Glenn brought Beomuller.  Rumil laid a massive fiend of traps and waited on top of the right tower with an angel he had saved.  Beomuller waited outside the front gate.  Outside the front gate!  Glenn said &#8220;They&rsquo;re not getting through.&#8221;  They didn&rsquo;t get through.</p>

<p>I did a summer internship at the Bronx Zoo many years ago, basically worked as a keeper. I loved it. I&rsquo;m not an early riser by nature, but every morning I left my apartment at 7 a.m. to catch the 7:20 train up to the Bronx. I had a long walk to the employees entrance (basically had to walk about halfway around the zoo to get to the employees entrance) and I&rsquo;d stagger through the gate half asleep, but once I saw the animals I&rsquo;d come alive. I&rsquo;d say good morning to the capybaras and all the other animals on my way in and I was at peace. I can still remember the wolves calling when they were let out into their enclosures at 10 o&rsquo;clock. I&rsquo;ve always been an animal lover and it was wonderful experience. </p>
<p>We used to make jokes about how it was the only place where you gossiped about animals. We also made jokes about how the cages were there to protect the animals from the people and that the real zoo was on the outside! </p>
<p>Except for a small Italian neighborhood which was just outside the keepers entrance, the rest of the area around the zoo was pretty bad!  </p>

The course that this nation is on and the financial condition of it guarantees that these issues will only worsen with time.<br>
Forget voting,forget writing to your congressman it won&rsquo;t work,we are on a collision course with racial acrimony and strife.<br>
All that we Europeans can do is communicate with each other(thanks AMREN) and seek peaceful,country living areas such as NC or GA or TN to associate with one another-that&rsquo;s all that we can do is to consolidate and stay concentrated for our own safety.</p>
