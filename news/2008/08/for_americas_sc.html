						<p>For scholars of race, Barack Obama presents a new American dilemma.</p>
<p>On the one hand, his election as president would be a breathtaking symbol of racial progress. On the other, an Obama victory could prove illusory, doing little to dismantle racism while crippling their ability to call attention to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what will we do as race scholars?&#8221; wondered University of Virginia political scientist Lynn Sanders.</p>
<p>Newhouse News Service asked some of the nation&rsquo;s leading students of race about the predicament.</p>
<p>&#8220;At this point, any conflict I might have is more than eased by the knowledge that Barack Obama, if elected, could be the salvation of a country in free flight failure,&#8221; Derrick Bell [who is black], a professor of law at New York University, who taught Obama when he was a student at Harvard Law School, replied via e-mail.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But in a blistering recent post on blackagendareport.com, Reed, who is black, argued that while Obama might be better than John McCain in the short run, in the long run he might be worse. This, Reed reasoned, is because, having co-opted so much of the left, Obama may move the boundary of acceptable discourse on race and class well to the right.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m not arguing that it&rsquo;s wrong to vote for Obama, though I do say it&rsquo;s wrong-headed to vote for him with any lofty expectations,&#8221; wrote Reed, indicating his intention &#8220;to abstain from this charade.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But, as [David Roediger]  notes in the conclusion of his book &mdash; &#8221;How Race Survived U.S. History: From Settlement and Slavery to the Obama Phenomenon,&#8221; due out this fall &mdash; &#8221;Obama does not represent the triumph of an advancing anti-racist movement but rather the necessity, at the highly refracted level of electoral politics, of abandoning old agendas, largely by not mentioning them.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>What bothers Brown University economist Glenn Loury is that Obama&rsquo;s election would fundamentally change the rules of race in America, yet that victory would come with the overwhelming assent of black people who have no idea that is what they are agreeing to.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;re voting for the end of affirmative action and they don&rsquo;t even know it,&#8221; said Loury, who is black. &#8220;They&rsquo;re voting for the end of race and they don&rsquo;t even know it.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s election, Anglin [Roland Anglin, executive director of the Center for Race and Ethnicity at Rutgers University] explained, won&rsquo;t by itself change the objective condition of black people, the crisis of black males, the education gap or the prison gap. It will be up to the black community to keep the pressure on him to address their needs.</p>
<p>Still, Anglin said, there is no gainsaying the stunning power of the moment.</p>
<p>At 13, Anglin was bused into hostile Italian and Irish territory in Brooklyn, where he was physically and verbally attacked. &#8220;From that to seeing Barack Obama and the enthusiasm he&rsquo;s generated, it&rsquo;s almost full circle to me, that America could grow to the point where it could see someone like Barack Obama in a different light,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;You remarked that Reverend Jeremiah Wright &lsquo;expressed a profoundly distorted view of this country &mdash; a view that sees white racism as endemic,&rsquo;&#8221; [a group of left social scientists]  wrote Obama. &#8220;We believe that Wright is exactly right, that racism is not only endemic but is at the core of American society as reflected in a large and well established body of social scientific research.&#8221;</p>
<p>One signer of that letter was Texas A&M;&rsquo;s Joe Feagin, who said that, considering the obvious need for Obama to trim and &#8220;pander&#8221; to maintain white support, &#8220;It was the best speech on race ever given by a major presidential candidate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Feagin, who is white, is writing a book on Obama and race with Georgia State University sociologist Adia Harvey Wingfield. He doubts Obama&rsquo;s chances. Based on his extensive field interviews over the years with blacks and whites, Feagin said those forecasting an Obama victory don&rsquo;t understand the degree to which whites remain racist &#8220;backstage.&#8221;</p>
<p>But for John McWhorter, a black linguist affiliated with the conservative Manhattan Institute in New York, Obama&rsquo;s success forever discredits such worldviews.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it really is going to change the way responsible people talk about racism,&#8221; McWhorter said. &#8220;Their basic idea, that racism is at the heart of how Americans feel, simply has been shown not to be true in the way that they said it.&#8221;</p>
<p>His Manhattan Institute colleague, Abigail Thernstrom, put it more caustically: &#8220;Are they still going to whine endlessly about racism in America?&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, says Stanford political scientist Paul Sniderman. Whether Obama wins or loses, Sniderman predicts, &#8220;There is going to be a furious effort to use evidence to show that racism is still this deep scar in the American experience.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Blacks want revenge against Whites, White money, and someone to blame for their own incompetence.  That will never change.  If Obama can&rsquo;t deliver they&rsquo;ll either repudiate him (Justice Thomas, you have a phone call!) or blame the ethereal magic of racism just like their animist brothers on the dark continent blame evil spirits for their woes.  Maybe they&rsquo;ll just riot.</p>

			<p>from the article - &#8220;Feagin said those forecasting an Obama victory don&rsquo;t understand the degree to which whites remain racist &ldquo;backstage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &#8220;degree&#8221; is consistent with black criminal and anti-social behaviors, academic failure and the overall financial burden blacks as a group place on American society. If blacks want whites to change their opinions of blacks, opinions grounded in reality, then blacks must improve their overall behavior. It&rsquo;s as simple as that.</p>

			<p>&#8220;breathtaking symbol of racial progress&#8221;</p>
<p>Bull!  When blacks start to resist their insatiable appetite for crime &amp; mayhem and also end their love affair with extortion, that will be a sign of racial progress!</p>
<p>How about a breathtaking symbol of just how far the Left has come in America?  How far Marxism has entrenched intself in Mainstream America?  Barack Obama is a symbol of both.<br>

			<p>Blacks will suffer from the hatred and oppression of evil wicked whitey until the end of time, no matter if Obambi is elected.</p>
<p>For whites, its a case of &#8220;heads blacks win, tails whites lose&#8221;. </p>
<p>Is anyone really so oblivious and stupid to imagine that blacks will suddenly drop the sense of eternal victimization that has gotten them so much in the last half-century?</p>

			<p>Call me a formerly naive 50 yo.  My dad tried to warn me when I was growing up, but I went to the new public schools, and was enlightened.  I believed in the equality and sameness dogma.  It all started changing a few years back, when I started looking at the facts, and came to a head recently.  Blacks believe in race more than results.  I consider myself a case in point.  I started a new job 7 years ago, after retiring from a career where I had plenty of leadership experience.  I realized I would have to pretty much start from ground zero, but that was ok, I had plenty of experience, and would be able to work my way up.  A couple of years ago, our &#8220;section&#8221; lead departed, and a black woman was promoted in his place.  No problem there.  Where I work, we have some of the best and brightest of all races, so we can pretty much pick high on the tree.  Well, 3 months ago, our &#8220;group&#8221; lead moved on, and I was a logical choice to fill the spot.  After a while, I became curious as to why the ad wasn&rsquo;t out to submit resumes for the position.  I was told by our &#8220;section&#8221; lead that she was looking to get the job ad just right.  At that point I knew the fix was in.  There was a black man who was not yet eligible for the position, but would be in July.  Yes, the ad went out (in July), yes I of course was selected to interview (gotta cover the bases), and yes, all can discern what happened.  Race is what matters overall.  Not results.  Not abilities.  Race.  My point here is that whether Hussein wins or not is immaterial.  What matters is that the battle will go on against white Americans no matter who wins.  Yes, I know I am being presumptive in my assessment that I was the better candidate, but that too is immaterial.  The simple facts are that I really enjoyed that job, and I am now in the process of searching for a new one.  I will be hard pressed to find one quite like it.  As of right now though, the enjoyment has pretty much been sucked out of it.  Anyway. just remember.  No matter what, no matter how altruistic or accommodating whites are, race will always be the deciding factor.  Just my 2 cents.</p>

			<p>Don&rsquo;t kid yourself.  Blacks do not and never have been victims of whites.  The whole damn thing is just one lie after another.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a technique used to exploit, dominate and victimize us.  The more we allow it, the greater the violence and demands.</p>
<p>One day, blacks WILL stop complainging about racism.  The day we round them up into American Bantustands.  One day they will know whites no longer have any illusions about what they are and will deal with them appropriately relative to their nature.  When that happens, they stop&hellip;.and not before.</p>

			<p>This article was written with the usual liberal slant that the concern (really paranoid obsession) by blacks over &#8220;racism&#8221; has generally been A Good Thing for America and that an end, or even a slowdown to it would generally be bad, worrying or troubling. And if blacks are so clueless that, as Mr. Loury said, &#8220;they&rsquo;re voting for the end of race and they don&rsquo;t even know it,&rdquo; that would be nothing new for blacks, but it certainly sounds like he is implying that his fellow blacks are like little children who don&rsquo;t even begin to grasp the ramifications of current events.</p>

			<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll say it again&hellip;America is in for a collective nervous breakdown when it becomes undeniably clear that not only is this country on a downward trajectory, no political solutions that are &#8220;proposable&#8221; in the coming new age of post-racial politics can do anything but aggravate the situation, and hasten the decline. I thought the power of the Ordered East visible on the TV with the Olympics would clarify this vision, and still think so&hellip;thank God for Michael Phelps the commentators (maybe) think to themselves. <br>
America believes in its political system down deep and believes in its capacity to solve problems. Its democracy is its pride and solace. However one has to wonder what will come to the rescue of that belief when it comes to pass that the democratic system is systematically ignored by the most important candidates of all&hellip;the Presidential candidates. Neither major candidate honors the overwhelming feeling of anti-immigration present in the population. Notice recently we are reading how immigrants are &#8220;heading home&#8221; because of an improving Mexican economy. And what is to prevent them from returning? Possibly an amnesty? Or maybe a Mexican miracle is a little too short in duration? Or an American depression a little too deep? Then what?<br>
Even worse imagine what will happen when it becomes crystal clear that the American elite&rsquo;s peculiar obsession with racism proves to have been of no consequence to the way this country is perceived globally? Maybe we have been entertaining  counter-productive ideas for an awfully long time&hellip;could that be it? How much further can the USA educational system fall behind the Chinese/Japanese/Taiwanese/Koreans etc. before we can no longer afford to notice it? Like maybe when the middle class realizes the game is -sorry about that - permanently over and the Chinese economy will ALWAYS BE AHEAD? And that they will continue to widen the gap because they are smarter and their people work harder? And because the ruling class has, contrary to what you would think, actually laid its money on them to do just that? Explain WalMart if you doubt me.<br>
So let&rsquo;s see&hellip; we have heard a great deal about Black Victimization in light of what occurred 150 years ago. It is the central issue of the Obama campaign. It even is more important than the Iraq War, the trade imbalance, the precarious state of the currency, etc etc etc. Does anyone realize no nation of any consequence cares? Britain cares but then of course they are next in line to be euthanized. <br>
 The nations that are surging ahead of us in science and technology are doing so precisely because they aren&rsquo;t chronically enmeshed in events of 150+ years ago.  I cannot believe this nation is serious about its future when it is so publicly and prominently concerned about &#8220;rectifying past mistakes&#8221;. How about &#8220;keeping out of the poorhouse&#8221;?</p>

			<p>   Oh, puleeze. Look.. since &#8220;Diversity&#8221; became a good in itself, we have even worse than affirmative action. Affirmative action was supposed to deal with all that &#8220;payback&#8221;, compensation, &#8220;level playing field&#8221;  and all. Now, with Diversity, we can have quotas forever. </p>

			<p>This theme is getting tiresome already. If anything, the election of Obama will only spur the race-hustlers on, and renew the same old song and dance&hellip;not advance the discourse on race one iota. On that I believe all of us at AR are agreed!  </p>

			<p>If Obama gets elected, then there is no further basis for affirmative action programs.  If Americans can elect a black man to the presidency, then qualified blacks should be able to attain employment without discriminatory AA and other entitlement programs.  Obama could receive just enough white votes to augment his virtual clean sweep of the black and brown vote.</p>
<p>The media, being the violent pro minority ideologues that they are, will of course ignore the relation of Obama&rsquo;s presidency to the continued need for race based entitlement programs.  They wouldn&rsquo;t want to give the white hoi polloi any negative ideas about multiculturalism.</p>

			<p>  &#8220;Scholars of race&#8221;? Or &#8220;race hustlers&#8221;? Notice how all articles like this one keep referring to &#8220;racism&#8221; without ever getting specific about what it really is? And of course black deficiencies in education, the ungodly high crime rate among blacks, especially men, and other fallings-short of blacks are blamed on &#8220;white racism&#8221;   &mdash;   again, without any explanation how we Whites are so all-fired good at keeping blacks down, unless we were getting an awful lot of cooperation from them at it.</p>
<p>  Will the election of Barack Obama (God help us all!), if it occurs, end all the prattle about &#8220;racism&#8221;? Of course not. The race hustlers know a good thing when they see it. They&rsquo;ve built a profitable industry out of encouraging and fostering grievances, and they won&rsquo;t give it up easily. What is the solution? Maybe there isn&rsquo;t any. In a free society, which we still (mostly) are, people are free to be confounded nuisances if they want to   &mdash;   as long as they&rsquo;re not White, that is.</p>

			<p>The speeches that I have seen Obama give remind me of a our Tony Blair, good speech writers with &#8220;spin&#8221; but when it comes to the nitty-gritty. weak on knowledge.  TB has been a disaster for Britain along with his government that, as always with Labour (Democrats?) borrowed vast sums of money, taxed everyone heavily and wasted it instead of instituting and insisting on good management practices; a case of talk the talk, but unable to walk the walk.   </p>
<p>I see similarities in Obama who surely is far too young and inexperienced to be the president of the most powerful country in the World?  And his background with the openly divisive racist black movements surely cannot be a qualification?   If he loses though, can we expect to see riots in some areas? </p>
<p>But the good move would be the complete dropping everywhere of affirmative action.  A generation or two is enough for the so-called disadvantaged to catch up.  </p>

One for these people is that despite their belief system, white people are far less &#8216;racist&rsquo; than they are made out to be. Whites were willing to give integration a try but it has turned into a nightmare for them. Another problem for these people is that whites develop a racial awareness when they&rsquo;re exposed to blacks.</p>
<p>Forcing white people to interact with blacks creates the problems these people claim they want to fix. Until or unless blacks stop acting &#8216;black&rsquo; whites will develop race-based attitudes.<br>

			<p>Obama supporters are akin to rabid fans rooting for their team to win a championship. No matter what happens, it&rsquo;s a lose-lose situation for the White team. Many liberals, afrocentrists, and other subversive enemies of Western civilization will revel in victory as if given license to kill - and consequently will riot if defeat falls upon Obama bin Marxen. From Booker T. Washington to Jesse Lee Peterson, many blacks ignore true role models; choosing Louis Fairycon, Jay-Z, and Vick instead. <br>

			<p>Yes, of course they will.  The idea that they would stop is based on the false premise that their current complaints are valid.  White racism has nothing to do with their complaints.<br>
Black racism is the source of their complaints. <br>
It is both institutional &amp; cultural. Should whites actually disappear entirely, blacks will no doubt wallow in their ever expanding misery, complaining about how the evils inflicted upon them by the white devils of the past caused all the troubles they&rsquo;ll ever see. <br>
In fact, they are already singing that tune: they complain about the &#8220;vestiges of slavery&#8221; and &#8220;slave blood&#8221;- they even still complain about the Romans sacking Carthage! <br>
Really!<br>
I have actually heard black speakers blame the Roman destruction of Carthage for breaking the spirit of black africans, and thereby causing all the destitution &amp; desperation we see there today.  </p>

			<p>Ignorant church blacks will destroy Obama in the unlikely event that he is elected. They are foolishly expecting him to be the leader of Black America and President of the United States at the same time. I predict that Obama will not even carry one state, not even Massachusetts or California. This will be a real wake up call for blacks who like to whoop and holler on Sunday.</p>

			<p>In one of those paradoxical ways, I actually think that a Barack Obama election might be the one thing that could save Western civilization in North America, since it would finally spark a group consciousness in US Whites.  </p>
<p>Whites right now, in Britain, the USA, Australia and Canada, are killing ourselves through political correctness and complacency.  In the USA at least, a triumph by Obama would be the one thing to change this.  Might be hard to accept at first, but sometimes, the most essential medicine is also the least palatable.</p>

			<p>Of COURSE Barack&rsquo;s election will not stop whining.  It did not stop whining in South Africa, did it?  It did not stop whining in Rhodesia did it?</p>
<p>What a black president did in South Africa was create a truly massive affirmative action program (BEE in South Africa) that required all white businesspeople to take on black partners.  The SA economy and infrastructure is collapsing and white folks  now have to leave the county to get a decent education and job.</p>
<p>What a black president did in Rhodesia was to embark on an ethnic cleansing crusade with the full support of the (supposedly) nice and friendly black peasantry.</p>
<p>They will not stop until the economy is crushed, the entire country looks like Detroit-East St. Louis-Philly-DC-Newark, all white folks have been driven off (except the fat white girls who will remain as urban breeding stock), and a corps of white hillbilly Janissaries.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Abigail Thernstrom, put it more caustically: &ldquo;Are they still going to whine endlessly about racism in America?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, says Stanford political scientist Paul Sniderman. Whether Obama wins or loses, Sniderman predicts, &ldquo;There is going to be a furious effort to use evidence to show that racism is still this deep scar in the American experience.&rdquo; A rare moment of truth from the very people that are the social engineers of llluminati think-tanks in our nation.Yet,they will hypocritically repeat the new age mantra of unity-in-diversity tomorrow.Of course,the real issues are never broached by the pseudo-intellectuals.The fact that blacks are easily manipulated due to low foreheaded mindests and IQ is a given.The issues of Obama&rsquo;s history and lack of experience is something Americans never demand the puppet media and talking-head educrats bring to the forum of public opinion and open debate.Not enough of us speak up over these important matters,which is why the black foxes rule the henhouse  &mdash;  -actually the madhouse.Abe knew the best options for blacks were either repatriation or segregation.Those famous speeches and writings are absent in the false history books these days.  <br>

			<p>It&rsquo;s not just embarrasing, it&rsquo;s sickening.  And that response is appropriate enough.  For Family Systems - which by the way, is intellectually far more respectable and reliable and relevant, than anything these &#8220;Academics&#8221; have to offer - reminds us that &#8220;the sicker the system, the more rigid the roles.&#8221; They also help us see that what applies to the family spreads by contact to the rest of Society and Culture and is passed on from generation to generation.</p>
<p>In any event, this makes it easier to see just why the Universities today are Intellectual Prisons. Intellectual Gulags. The only thing they are interested in is rigid conformity and blind obedience to their &#8220;authority&#8221;.  <br>
Authority can mean &#8220;expert&#8221; or it can simply mean &#8220;one who enforces a law.&#8221;</p>
<p>That they call themselves experts when we all know they are there to to serve as Mind Guards for an Intellectual Prison merely points to the extent of their corruption.</p>
<p>Like I said, it&rsquo;s not just embarrasing, it&rsquo;s sickening.  It&rsquo;s also very dangerous. As I have said before, unless I am mistaken, and I would love to be, I just do not see a peaceful solution to this crisis. They have long since broken the back of our good will and can not stop doing what they are doing.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Well, I&rsquo;ll say it again&hellip;America is in for a collective nervous breakdown when it becomes undeniably clear that not only is this country on a downward trajectory, no political solutions that are &ldquo;proposable&rdquo; in the coming new age of post-racial politics can do anything but aggravate the situation, and hasten the decline&#8221;  Mark</p>
<p>  I&rsquo;m afraid you have a point. We can still delay the decline but not completely stop it. In 2042 the country will be the &ldquo;United States&rdquo; in name only.  Minorities will be the majority and the country should be renamed the United Races of America. What will it be like? You can already see it in places like California, Texas, New York City and South Florida.  Does that look good to you? Due to my age, I will not see that day, but many on this website will</p>

Relationships are relationships&hellip;.doesn&rsquo;t matter what kind it is.</p>
<p>So, then, if you were in one with another person, and they were treating you badly, would you stay in it?  And if you did your friends would suggest counseling.  And if you refused they would slowly, or quickly, begin to disappear from you life. Leaving you with your Offender.  Soon after, your friends will here about how your relationship ended with your demise and the Offenders quite possibly getting away with it.</p>
<p>To which your friends will reply, &#8220;Sad story. But what&rsquo;s sadder is, it&rsquo;s the least surprising thing I&rsquo;ve heard all year.&#8221;<br>

Instead of dealing with them as if they had adult mentalities we need to deal with them on their true level which is that of naughty children, in so many ways their Golden Era were truly those spent on the Plantation?</p>

			<p>If Obama is elected, most intelligent Americans will breathe a sigh of relief and say &#8220;finally, we can put that behind us. They can&rsquo;t complain about racism any more&#8221;.<br>
Unfortunately, the race industry isn&rsquo;t going away. Its fraudulent leaders will just work harder trying to find &#8220;proof&#8221; that America is a racist country and that all Whites are racists.</p>

			<p>Obama&rsquo;s relative ascend today is due to the push from the lefties, (willingly or unwillingly ─ this does not matter) hating America. They don&rsquo;t support Obama, they use him. Lefties are hungry for power, and to get it in THIS election, they will walk over their mother&rsquo;s dead body. Their real life (not words) shows clearly, that they care of blacks as a shark of a pilot-fish. So they carry out some calculations. In this approach they mathematically prefer Obama over Hillary:<br>
1.	Obama automatically gets blacks and other minorities; plus, <br>
2.	nowadays they count on number of voters brainwashed by racism guilt. This part for Hillary would be hard to get.<br>
To help the race &ldquo;scientist&rdquo;, I want to indicate, that Obama is half-black and half-nonwhite.<br>

			<p>The more power blacks have the more racist they become.  If Obama is elected their power will increase and anti-white racism will increase including stronger affirmative action laws. Any white who votes for Obama is a fool.  I understand that many are upset about the Iraq war and the economy but the war on whites in America is more important.  Make sure to vote.  Every election, no matter what.  Make race a major issue in your voting decisions. Vote vote vote.   </p>

<p>You&rsquo;re wrong to vote for Obama for the sole reason of waking up White America.  Have you contemplated how many liberal judges will be appointed (for life not 4 years) as well as legislation that will be permanently affixed to our lives?  It will take decades of Whites moving to the Right to have any effect and by that time, we&rsquo;ll be a minority.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t stand McCain either and view him as a traitor but he will appoint slightly more conservative judges.<br>

			<p><i>Obama&rsquo;s election, Anglin [Roland Anglin, executive director of the Center for Race and Ethnicity at Rutgers University] explained, won&rsquo;t by itself change the objective condition of black people, the crisis of black males, the education gap or the prison gap. It will be up to the black community to keep the pressure on him to address their needs.</i></p>
<p>And once again, we come back to the central folly of the whole mess: They expect him to &#8220;address their needs.&#8221; In other words, they still want someone else to fix their problems for them. </p>
<p>No, black America, BHO&rsquo;s election will not change any of the things listed above. He can&rsquo;t better your situation for you. Neither can we. These things are your own failings, and no one but you can deliver yourselves from them. </p>
<p>Maybe you don&rsquo;t have what it takes to better your own lot in life either, I don&rsquo;t know. But no one else can.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t think most Americans can begin to imagine the horror of black government, which is what our government will become during an Obama Administration. </p>
<p>It will mean rule by blacks who are both stupid and hate filled. It happened once before when Reconstruction, so called, was imposed on the Southern States, post Civil War. The reaction on the part of southern whites resulted in segregation, and mentally the humiliation and resultant hatred and fear of blacks never totally wore off.</p>
