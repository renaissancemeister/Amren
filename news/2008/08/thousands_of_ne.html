						<p>Although New Zealand is fast becoming one of the world&rsquo;s most popular immigration destinations, New Zealand citizens continue to leave the country in droves, many of them opting for a new life in Australia.</p>
<p>The New Zealand population has grown through migration, with a gain of 700 last month due to permanent or long term immigration. This is according to a report released by Statistics New Zealand today. However in contradiction to these figures is the revelation that people are still leaving the country at a rapid pace.</p>
<p>New Zealand has had the second highest loss of people ever for the year ended July, with over 80 000 people departing for foreign shores and over half of this, about 45 000, choosing to migrate to Australia.</p>
<p>These figures have become so high that the numbers of immigrants has reached city like proportions. As Lockwood Smith, National Immigration spokesperson says, &#8220;This is the highest ever loss for a year ended in July in recorded history and is only 4000 short of being enough to constitute a city.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Smith this exodus is because of Labour government policies that have &#8220;resulted in record food and fuel prices, unaffordable homes, [and] punitive taxation rates.&#8221; No matter what the reason people are opting to move to Australia where the economy is booming and skills are in high demand.</p>
<p>It is clear that migrants are choosing to move to New Zealand for various reasons from the temperate climate, friendly community or the variety of job opportunities available. In the past five months net migration has increased in three of the months. This is a rise from the 2007 figures.</p>
<p>But at the same time as people enter New Zealand, others exit in search of something better in Australia.<br/>

			<p>Australia has a special treaty with New Zealand allowing essentially free movement of peoples between the countries. Other than that, the government doesn&rsquo;t seem to keen to have whiteys immigrate.</p>

			<p>Flamethrower, it is quite difficult to immigrate to Australia, but not for New Zealanders.  NZ citizens have an automatic right to live and work in Australia.  Because salaries are higher in Australia, many young Kiwi graduates go there to find work.  This is what makes New Zealand immigration possible for the rest of us.</p>

			<p>New Zealand has obscenely high taxation, a largely Maori criminal underclass dependent on welfare benefits (sound familiar?), food prices twice as high as in the States, fuel prices currently &#8220;down&#8221; at $4.20 USD a gallon, a low general level of culture and literacy (just check their newspapers for spelling errors in the headlines), white identity is nil, they are a bunch of resentful backward dope-smoking pinkos - crabs in a barrel mentality - who hate Americans simply for being Americans regardless of the individual&rsquo;s politics (and most Americans who move there are idealistic lefties who are shocked to be &#8220;treated that way&#8221; by the natives), their houses are exponentially more expensive and exponentially more shoddy (cold, thin walls, crumbly, leaky, unstable and mouldy), socialist medicine is, well, &#8220;you get what you pay for&#8221;, which is cheap for general indifferent care, long queues for operations (6-7 years for hernia at least for instance if you are lucky), no special expertise, no &#8220;new&#8221; drugs or advanced treatments, hospice + pain drugs when you get cancer (they decide who&rsquo;s &#8220;worth treating/moving to front of queue&#8221; and who isn&rsquo;t, so better hope they think you are worth it or be able to afford private treatment).  There is an anti-intellectual atmosphere that stifles ideas and debate.  Their P.R. campaigns continue to attract new migrants.  Mediocrity and blind adherence to formalism rule their society.  Professional services? Many many times pricier if you need an accountant or lawyer. The high migration figures include a large percentage of &#8220;revolving door migrants&#8221;, i.e., Poms, Canadians, Yanks and South Africans etc. who migrate, acquire citizenship in a few years, and then move on to Oz where there&rsquo;s more possibility of actually getting somewhere in life. Or for the N. Americans, usually, back home to US or Canada. The Poms and S.Africans don&rsquo;t have anywhere to go back to because of the dark crime. I can&rsquo;t recommend living in NZ unless you are rich and have a thick skin. There are good reasons why people come and soon leave and explanations for why they have a &#8220;brain drain&#8221;.  Migrant cash is one of those things keeping the monster afloat (Poms&rsquo; pensions brought over, immigration fees, etc.).  It&rsquo;s a cash-starved place.  They rely on agricultural exports to survive, and tourism, and that&rsquo;s it.  Don&rsquo;t believe the hype about New Zealand. It&rsquo;s a pretty, but grasping, desperate, poor, 3rd-World and high-maintenance place and you&rsquo;ll be roped into buying it expensive baubles and fixing its crumbly teeth, which at this age are already way past being able to be fixed.  So visit but do not live there.</p>

			<p>Chris, AnalogMan, are both correct and Visitor&rsquo;s comments seem pretty much bang on the money to me although i do not have the North american point of view. I have never been to Australia or New Zealand but for family reasons i think i can contribute something to this debate, although some of you may wish to skip the next paragraph:</p>
<p>My father has been to Australia numerous times and is married to an Australian, my best mate has lived in australia on and of for ten years, one of my cousins emigrated to Perth last year, one of my brothers emigrated to Western Australia a little over a month ago, my sister spent a year living in Australia, I have a great aunt&rsquo;s family were &#8216;ten pound poms&rsquo; back in the sixties. My uncles family emigrated to New Zealand twenty years ago&hellip;. (hey i did say you could skip it)</p>
<p>basically it has been much easier to emigrate to New Zealand over the last twenty or thirty years than to Australia and for the reasons Chris, AnalogMan and Visitor pointed out it has become Australia&rsquo;s &#8216;back door&rsquo; with many British (pommies) and South Africans &#8216;emigrating&rsquo; to New Zealand for precicely as long as it take to aquire a New Zealand passport so they can then go to live where they wanted to go to in the first place&hellip;.. Australia. Incidently, my sister in law who emigrated with my brother a month ago has an aunt and uncle and cousins who took exactly this root into Australia and now also live in Western Australia.<br/>
 <br/>
Flamethrower - in less you were being ironic, then yess they do and it has become much, much easier to emigrate recently.</p>
<p>want demographics?<br/>
New Zealand has roughly four million people living in it.. but seven million passport holders. <br/>

			<p>New Zealand is to Australia as Canada is to the USA.</p>
<p>And given how socialist Canada is&hellip; and that Australia is still worse than the USA&hellip; you can see that New Zealand is firmly at the bottom of the stack.</p>
<p>New Zealand&rsquo;s birth rate has jumped over the replacement level&hellip; it&rsquo;s now at 2.2 children per woman. You can bet the pakeha (whites) aren&rsquo;t nearly that high! White Americans are at 1.85, and we are not crippled with the brain-dead socialism that Canada and New Zealand are.</p>
<p>New Zealand will probably be the first of the four Anglophone ex-colonies to go brown&hellip; yes, well before the USA, which may actually lose its white majority well LATER than 2045 (or whatever year they say it will be now) due to the collapsing birth rate in Mexico and the rest of Latin America.</p>

        I find it hard to believe that food prices are high in New Zealand - a country that famously has many more sheep than people and very large dairy industry aimed at the export market.</p>

			<p>Kenelm Digby: It&rsquo;s due to the weak New Zealand dollar and the high demand for such food internationally (i.e. farmers can get a lot more internationally than in the local market) that New Zealanders pay so much for their own food.</p>
<p>P.S. &#8216;Visitor&rsquo; was spot on. After spending some time in New Zealand I&rsquo;ve come to the same conclusions. He actually made me laugh out loud because the harsh truth can be a great source of amusement.</p>

			<p>&#8220;After spending some time in New Zealand I&rsquo;ve come to the same conclusions. He actually made me laugh out loud because the harsh truth can be a great source of amusement.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a fifth-generation &#8220;European&#8221; New Zealander, I&rsquo;m saddened by the fact that &#8220;Visitor&#8221; has hit the proverbial nail on the head:<br/>
The only redeeming feature of (native) European New Zealanders is an almost-universal dislike of Maori/Pacific Islanders:<br/>
I have - strangely enough - noticed a marked increase in white Britons moving to New Zealand in these past few years, though I&rsquo;m confused as New Zealand can&rsquo;t be that much better than the U.K., race-wise and overall.</p>
<p>The only amusement in New Zealand left to me is that both sides of my family have been here longer than the American father of one of the heads of the &#8220;Maori Party&#8221;!</p>
