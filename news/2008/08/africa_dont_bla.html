<p>Africans are usually quick to blame most of its problems on the evils of colonialism. We sometimes blame the violence on the borders colonialists created that ignored ethnicity. Many African nations have been independent for four decades. If colonial borders were a major problem, how come they haven&rsquo;t changed them?</p>
<p>Colonialism cannot explain Third World poverty. Some of today&rsquo;s richest countries are former colonies, such as the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong. Some of today&rsquo;s poorest countries were never colonies, such as Ethiopia, Liberia, Tibet, Nepal and Bhutan. The colonialism argument is simply a cover-up for African dictators and people.</p>
<p>For as long as African keep bickering about the past without focusing on the future, the African people will continue to suffer. Pointing fingers at the colonial masters won&rsquo;t change the fact that the majority of people in Africa are living and dying in horrible conditions. The Europeans colonized Africa about 400 years ago. Right now, Africans are in trouble because they cannot manage their own problems. Instead of brainstorming and finding solutions to its numerous social and economic problems, the people hold out a begging bowl to the west in one hand, while punishing the remaining white people in the land with the other. (Does Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe and the Zimbabweans come to mind?)</p>
<p>We are responsible for our problems, but we prefer to blame others than to take a good look in the mirror. Fine, the colonialists were a bunch of bunch of greedy no-gooders, but if truths must be told, the self-interest of early colonialists pales in comparison to the personal greed of African leaders today. Those who blame Africa&rsquo;s problems on colonialism must not forget that the experience was not unique to Africa. Generally, the Asian countries that also experienced colonialism are doing fairly well. So what has Africa, or to be more precise, its leaders, been doing for the past 40 years?</p>
<p>What Africa needs is a lot of self-criticism. The fact that Africa breeds and worships figures like Mugabe, because of their own anti-white racism is disheartening. It&rsquo;s incredible that any white sends aid to Africa when Africans are anti-white racists.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>We need to strip away the black ideology that says that whites didn&rsquo;t do anything other than enslave blacks and are rich because of the exploitation of blacks. Taiwan didn&rsquo;t get rich because of that. So why do Africans think that that&rsquo;s how whites got rich?</p>
<p>And blacks enslaved blacks too; it&rsquo;s part of human history everywhere. So why isn&rsquo;t Africa rich due to the enslavement of themselves?</p>
<p>Were Africans better off under colonial administration than the despots who replaced them? Most African countries have had their independence for over three decades, yet, the report card our leaders have shown us are wars, famine and gross corruption. While it may be argued that Britain and other European countries did us more harm than good in colonizing us, it is high time we faced reality and realized that we are the architects of our own destiny. {snip}</p>

			<p>Very glad to see articles such as this occasionally.  </p>
<p>It somewhat echoes Dinesh D&rsquo;Souza&rsquo;s book, &#8220;What&rsquo;s So Great About America&#8221; wherein one of the chapters is titled &#8220;Two Cheers for Colonialism.&#8221;</p>
<p>D&rsquo;Souza points out that countries that underwent colonialism by whites invariably wound up greatly improved by it.  This author doesn&rsquo;t really say as much as that, but he nonetheless states the truth as far as colonialism being not unique to Africa, and not in any way to blame for black failure there.</p>

			<p>Wonderful refutation of the hate whitey excuses, only, he&rsquo;s a hopeless optimist.  There is no cure to Africa&rsquo;s woes because they have an average IQ of 70, which basically means half the people in Africa are retarded.  You can&rsquo;t do anything in such a position, there is no way to get rich or progress.  Africa is an eternal hellhole.  No matter what leaders they elect, what policies they implement, how they criticize themselves, what they do, Africa is doomed to be a hell on Earth.<br>

			<p>Africa is obviously a challenging, difficult environment for humans to live in, but then so is Australia.  There&rsquo;s no reason it couldn&rsquo;t be at least as civilized, if only a different kind of people were living there.  The darkness &amp; backwardness of Africa is entirely man&rsquo;s creation.  What a damned shame.  </p>

			<p>Africans with common sense like the author of this article are in very short supply. Africa has the richest mineral deposits in the world, and cannot seem to find them - nor process the product without help from Europeans. China will surely siphon natural resources from the Dark Continent, and become the new scapegoat to blame for it&rsquo;s incompetence. Whites are always the first target of minorities, biting the hand that feeds them&hellip;<br>

<p>Yes, it is amazing, isn&rsquo;t it?  And the reason for it is because whites have huge problems themselves. They&rsquo;re infested with those who are  naive, gullible, and have a propensity for mindless altruism that has got more of them killed than just about anything else.</p>
<p>It is those types that saner, more stable whites want to see excluded from any society they might have in the future.  Actually, many of us are hoping they go over to the black side to live, so they can dilute their gene pool with their uncontrollable weaknesses and weak-spined foppery.  </p>
<p>They have no place with those of us who live in the real world, Mr. Nsehe.  You won&rsquo;t have to worry about us sending aid to people who hate us, nor will you see us include anyone but our own kind in our homogeneous nation state.<br>

			<p>Every now and again, a shining light comes to the fore when a black African, as opposed to a white one, broadcasts hard facts about why Africa was &#8220;given its freedom&#8221; far too soon by people in the West who would just not listen to those who lived there before the black terrorists were given the power after years of murdering and propaganda.   Why else was apartheid invented but to allow the various tribes in South Africa to develop at their own rates with a stabilising influence, the mainly white South African government, as a federation, so that the old African ills could not occur, these being no true democracy (look at Mugabe now, lost the election, but still will not leave as he fears being rightly charged with genocide in the World Court), rank corruption and genocides.   SA had witnessed it in Africa, the Idi Amins and so on, and refused to allow the same to happen there.   The West and especially the Communist blocs pumped out the propaganda and we know the results today.  South Africa is a very dangerous country to live in and is badly managed like any other African state where the blacks are in charge.   Ask the Zim refugees, well those that were not recently cruelly burnt to death.   But for a white person to say and write such things now causes them to be condemned as racists by the ignorant few who have nothing better to do with their time and they and others like them in the recent past must be held partly accountable for the hundreds of thousands of deaths in Africa.</p>
<p>As even the white South African liberals who campaigned for an end to apartheid have since said and written, &#8220;This is not what we intended&#8221;.     And the black run national trades union councils, COSATU, have recently stated publicly that work opportunities were far better under apartheid than it is now with a 40% unemployment rate there.</p>
<p>I see that black history is going to be taught in British schools.  The blacks were unable to write anything down before the Arabs and the Europeans arrived so that will be a short subject if the truth is told.    No doubt there will be a list of &#8220;scientists&#8221; and great black leaders such as Shaka, the Zulu king who murdered many thousands as he subjugated them in the early 19th Century.   It will cause a lot of controversy where parents who have lived in Africa dispute what their kids are being taught at the local feel-good school.</p>

<p>I believe the real problem is they can&rsquo;t solve their own problems. Even when given help and presented with clear examples on how to do things so they work, they&rsquo;re still incapable of making things work. The old saying, &#8216;give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for his life&rsquo; is lost on these people because they&rsquo;re genetically incapable of doing or understanding the most rudimentary ideas that can improve their lives. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a black gene thing.</p>

			<p>Finally, some honesty from Africa!<br>
   A correstion: Africa was not &#8220;colonized&#8221; by whites. The only area that was actually settled was South Africa, and whites settled into an empty area. Most places just had a trading outpost, and the tribes just pledge allegence to a european nation, but allowed to stay as primitive as they were. You will note that the areas were whites settled the longest are the most prosperious.</p>

			<p>Something you don&rsquo;t hear about much, even on AmRen, is the relationship between nutrition and intelligence. Not enough of the right proteins or vitamins in early childhood, and the brain doesn&rsquo;t develop fully.</p>
<p>Afterall, it&rsquo;s an organ like any of the others and likely prone to damage or underdevelopment by nutritional deficiency.</p>
<p>When you think about it, the dumbest white people  &mdash;  as well as the preponderance of blacks and hispanics  &mdash;  have a lousy diet. I&rsquo;ve never really bought the argument that these groups carry a &#8220;stupid&#8221; gene or lack something in their genetic makeup. Could it be more a matter of &#8220;you are what you eat&#8221;?</p>

			<p>Being from Africa and having known blacks all my life - here&rsquo;s the truth in one sentence:<br>
Black are completely prone to immediate gratification (want what the white man has but do not want to actually earn it, thus the jealousy factor), have zero ability to plan for the future, and have no regard for their descendants (as those in the US will know - they don&rsquo;t even rear their own children, let alone worry about the state of the world their offspring have to live in).</p>

			<p>@general:  Do you believe that a well fed ant, or well fed pig, for instance, will become sentient as well and match us einstein for einstein, or do you admit that intelligence is genetic and it is because of our human genome that we are more intelligent than the animal kingdom?</p>
<p>Obviously eating a lot can only get you so far, otherwise bacteria in petri dishes could outperform mankind.  From what I&rsquo;ve read, that &#8216;so far&rsquo; is at best 15 points, which would bring them from 70 to 85  &mdash;  -still an unbridgeable gap between black and white.  Most studies have shown 80% of IQ is genetic and only 20% environmental.  Any help you give them will only have a marginal return.</p>

			<p>generalquagmyer is expressing something close to the modern liberal position on race and IQ-there is no such thing as race, all races have the same IQ, and the only reason blacks have a lower IQ is because they have a poor diet. <br>
Do you really believe this, generalquagmyer? Is this going to be the latest liberal hobby-horse? I forsee huge amounts of taxpayers money thrown into schemes designed to improve the diets of &#8216;urban&rsquo; youth, followed by lots of encouraging data in the New York Times about what an amazing difference it is making, followed by lots of angry blacks demanding reperations for generations of &#8216;food racism&rsquo; or something, allegations that KFC was invented to keep the black man stoopid..then finally an admission that it has not made a blind bit of difference, and another fruitless search to find what it is that makes it seem as if different races have different IQ&rsquo;s. I hope you enjoy the ride, generalquagmyer, and while I&rsquo;m sure you will turn out to be right, it might be a good idea to have another reason for black failure up your sleeve..just in case.</p>

			<p>A fair quesion might be &#8220;just how much&#8221; of all that financial help, food and medical shipments donated to African countries actually helped the intended recipients. As opposed to enriching greedy, corrupt government officials and military.</p>
<p>Since dumping billions and billions of dollars into Africa&rsquo;s bottomless beggar bowl seems to have no visible effect&hellip; maybe it&rsquo;s time to stop that practice. Force them to stand on their own and work to improve their lot.</p>

<p>Yes, nutrition is important. So is education.</p>
<p>Just because those two statements are true doesn&rsquo;t nullify the importance of genetics.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t improve the IQ of a race at genetic level beyond a certain point by continually improving the qualitiy of food.</p>

<p>Not much of a revenge really. In another 10 to 20 years there wont be a single black left in Zimbabwe that remembers how good they had it under White rule so they wont be praying for us to come back.</p>

			<p>   &#8221; I do believe charity begins at home&#8221;. Okay, let&rsquo;s be charitable at home, to our own people. There is no obligation to help people when they don&rsquo;t appreciate it. We (whites) have wasted untold trillions of dollars at home and abroad to try and give blacks a helping hand. That, my friend, is the problem. They have grown to expect it. They spew racial hatred at us, while they hold out one hand for a freebie, and the other hand is holding a gun to kill you. I cannot find a single instance of a contribution by blacks. Yes, there is more to life than a GNP/GDF figure, but it doesn&rsquo;t feed you.</p>

			<p>Liberia was declared an independent republic in 1847 so has spent the last 160 years without suffering any White colonial oppression. The country was founded as an african nation for freed american slaves and open to all who wished to take advantage of the free travel offer. Development continues apace, especially tourism.<br>

			<p>If a nation keeps reinforcing to the world the fact that it is unable to stand on its own two feet and shamelessly continues resorting to the guilt-tripping of others tactic along with  perpetual begging bowl demands, in all honesty, such a nation has fofeited its right to exist.</p>
<p>Others have a duty to seize that territory with the object of working the land to its full potential thus creating a new living space for its own more worthy specimens.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what white Europeans once did and got vilified for it by later generations of their own self-loathing holier-than-thou establishment figureheads who covertly substituted the politics of nationhood with their particular brand of inclusive political philosophy namely, egalitarianism, multiculturalism and globalism which translates as a death-wish or suicide pact which treachery they had no rights to inflict upon their own ethnic brethren, being crimes they must eventually answer for with their own traitorous and worthless lives.   </p>
<p>Now we see the various tribes of East and South-East Asian invader opportunists swarming onto the African continent to profit from the work that Europeans started and to extend their own ambitions across that continent in the process.  It&rsquo;s only natural, after all.  </p>
<p>We can safely bet that none of these specimens will be entertaining any thoughts of self-loathing and self-flagellation while they go about subduing the backward native and preparing the continent for the proliferation of their own East and South-East Asian progeny.</p>
<p>After all, if one examines the humble animal kingdom this precisely is how life endlessly evolves there too.</p>
<p>If natives truly want to reclaim and preserve their ancestral homelands, they must make sure they are able to paddle their own canoes from thence on, after they&rsquo;ve risen up and successfully banished the alien invader breeds from their respective ancestral homelands.<br>

			<p>As someone who lived in South Africa for 24 years escaping in 1999, the following joke had me in stitches.  The potential truth is so funny at times.</p>
<p>Zimbabwe joke.</p>
<p>A black Zimbabwean couple are sitting in their home waiting to die. There has been no work for months, inflation is running at over 2 million percent: they haven&rsquo;t eaten a decent meal in weeks, and the water and power hasn&rsquo;t worked for years.   As they miserably sit huddled under blankets waiting for the end,  suddenly they hear the water pipes begin to rumble and soon water starts pouring out of the long unused taps. Next the electric light begins to flicker and then fills the apartment with bright light.   In the street outside a large new truck arrives with food being handed out from the back. </p>
<p>The husband looks at his wife and says, <br>
&#8220;QUICK WOMAN, BRING ME MY PANGA (MACHETE). THE WHITES ARE BACK!&#8221;<br>

			<p>It&rsquo;s actually quite historically incorrect to state that &#8220;Europeans colonized Africa about 400 years ago.&#8221; The Dutch under van Riebeeck only arrived at the Cape at 1652. True, the Portugese had some outposts in the southern part of Africa before that but they didn&rsquo;t amount to much. Especially not in terms of influence. Colonialism the way we commonly associate it with Africa didn&rsquo;t really start until the latter part of the nineteenth century. By contrast, colonialism in Asia goes back much longer.</p>
<p>What is obvious is that long before Europeans actually took over Africa there was a very large difference in terms of development between the two continents. It&rsquo;s pretty strange to start with colonialism as the main explanation for today&rsquo;s differences.<br>

			<p>If only more Blacks reasoned through their race&rsquo;s problems like the honorable Mr. Nsehe!  We need more people like him writing articles, appearing on TV, running for office, so that Blacks can be exposed to different points of view other than the tired, &#8220;We need to be angry with Whites forever because of the legacy of slavery&#8221; dogma.</p>
<p>News flash to angry Blacks:  Anger hurts most the vessel that contains it.  History has been unkind to many, many races and nationalities of people, not just you.  Other groups, such as the Jews and the Japanese after World War II, have flourished, and don&rsquo;t dwell 24/7 on past grievances. </p>
<p>Two things that hold many Blacks back are: (1) their BITTERNESS towards Whites because of past injustices; and (2) their UNGRATEFULNESS for all the ways Whites have helped them.  Could there be a connection between a bitter, vengeful heart and lack of achievement?  I think so.  </p>
<p>Blacks need more brave role models like Mr. Nsehe leveling with them and refusing to feed Blacks PC MSM baby food.</p>

			<p>I think it was the black leader Du Bois who said that blacks are lazy and have only vice on their mind. His remedy was similar to China&rsquo;s today, iron fisted authoritarian rule and endless regimented hard work!   </p>

<i>Something you don&rsquo;t hear about much, even on AmRen, is the relationship between nutrition and intelligence. Not enough of the right proteins or vitamins in early childhood, and the brain doesn&rsquo;t develop fully.</i></p>
<p>Actually, this argument has been dealt with in American Renaissance. For example, studies show that blacks reach physical maturity more quickly than whites, something that seems unlikely if they were receiving inferior nutrition.</p>

<p>Possibly, but not necessarily, considering the lack of honesty about race on the part of most whites.</p>

			<p>He&rsquo;s absolutely right, but few blacks share his viewpoint. All too often, they look to the most convenient scapegoat, and who else would that be but whites? It&rsquo;s all too ironic that they would even try and claim colonization ruined Africa. The most popular region for black Africans to moved to over the last several years has been none other than South Africa, clearly the most  white colonized region of all. And obviously, it was because the standard of living was so much better than black ran regions of Africa. I do say (was) because predictably, now that blacks have gained more control there, the quality of life, and economy, have taken a serious nose-dive. The other irony is how many of them just keep moving to Europe, and other Westernized nations. Deep inside, they know white are superior to them when it comes to creating succesful nations, and healthy economies, but their pride will never allow them to admit it.</p>

			<p>There are a minority of black Africans who understand the situation and tell it honestly, as did the author of this article. The dilemma is that the vast majority of African elites are opportunistic and choose to scapegoat whites in order to rally a client base of angry blacks. </p>
<p>When you think about it, this is similar to the situation here in the USA.</p>

			<p>Yes, Mfonobong is tallking sense, but I doubt that even if Africans can right their various national problems that Whites will ever be safe living there.  Although it must be pointed out that of the many African nations, the majority are relatively safe.  Not so in the Western nations.  We will still be obligated to import the failures of Africa and everywhere else.  There is simply no odds that we can turn failures into successes, especially in the numbers we have been bringing them in. We have gone broke trying to do it and the debt will only deepen with time.  One day, the bill will come due and no one will be able to pay it.  That will be the day when the world economy collapses.  When that happens, this era of human history will end and a new and terrible one will begin.  And all because we couldn&rsquo;t manage oursleves (for all the various reasons).</p>

			<p>Mr. Nsehe is far from alone.  Two viewpoints I have heard expressed by blacks that remain in mind are as follows.</p>
<p>1) I had a dear friend attending university in California. He was from Nigeria, and from a family of highly accomplished and intelligent people. His father was a Methodist minister who ran an orphanage for boys, one brother was a petroleum engineer for Royal Dutch Shell, another was a doctor with schooling in Britain, etc, and this was long before race-norming and affirmative action.  My friend and I would get together for dinner about once a month.  Due to the location of his university, he lived in a primarily black district near LAX.</p>
<p>When we would be at a red light, he would look over at some dancing fool with a huge portable radio, trousers 6&#8221; below the crack, and wailing like a gut-shot cat along with the blaring alleged music.  The look of utter contempt in his eyes was something way beyond anything I have ever seen from any White or Asian.  In his Nigerian/British English he would angrily ask why the dancing fool was not home with his face stuck in a book, or at class, or doing something useful with his life? And why was he so ill-behaved? &#8220;These people are stupid! They have so much opportunity in America! They spend money on huge wireless sets and jewelry and yet probably don&rsquo;t own a single book!&#8221;  And so on.  He also said that whenever he heard some American &#8220;black leader&#8221; talk about going back to Africa, his answer was &#8220;We do not want this trash!&#8221;</p>
<p>2) I did not witness this one first-hand, but it was relayed to me by my mother, a liberal.  In the early 60s she was in a liaison position with a major oil company, dealing with the problems of local dealers (gas stations).  This was when gas stations still serviced cars and did repairs along with selling fuel.  One such station was in the Watts district of Los Angeles, and was operated by an immigrant black family.  This was before affirmative action, SBA loans, &#8220;outreach&#8221; and all that.  Translation: these people scrimped and saved and busted butt to make something of themselves.  My mother was paying one of her scheduled visits when a bit of ruckus started up in the station.  The wife of the station owner quickly sized up the situation, grabbed my mother and put her in an office where she would not be seen.  The trouble was dealt with, then the lady got mom back out to the main area of the station.  My mother asked what had happened.  The lady looked at mom and said &#8220;So many of these people.  Too soon out of the jungle!&#8221;</p>
<p>How right both were.</p>
