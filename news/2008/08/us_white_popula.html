			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Thomas Penny, Bloomberg, August 14, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The white majority in the U.S. will be outnumbered by Americans of other races by 2042, eight years sooner than previously projected by the Census Bureau.</p>
<p>Minorities, defined by the agency as everyone except non-Hispanic, single-race whites, will make up 54 percent of the U.S. population in 2050, compared with 34 percent of the population today, the Census Bureau said in a statement. The data updates predictions made by the bureau in 2004.</p>
<p>The projections released today, based on census results and assumptions about future childbearing, mortality and migration, show the minority population of the U.S. will be 235.7 million out of a total of 439 million in 2050. More than half of all U.S. children are expected to be from minority ethnic groups by 2023.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The projections also suggest an aging of the U.S. population, with the proportion of people of working age &mdash; 18 to 64 &mdash; declining to 57 percent in 2050 from 63 percent in 2008.</p>
<p>By 2030, after all baby boomers reach retirement age, almost one in five U.S. residents will be 65 or older, the bureau said. There are expected to be 88.5 million people over 65 in 2050, more than double the 38.7 million in the U.S. today, with an estimated 19 million of them over 85, up from 5.4 million today.<br>

Many foresee - as whites decline more and more into &#8220;minority&#8221; status - they will quit running and turn around and fight. Its likely this turn of events will be due more to necessity, though, rather than bravery on their part.</p>

			<p>   It was the plan all along, it did not have to happen . After the Immigration Bill of &#8216;65 set us (whites) on the road to becoming strangers in our own land, plus paying non-whites for some 40 years to procreate while young whites do not have to have but one or two children before they figure out there&rsquo;s no way they can keep affording it . Well now it has all come to fruition, just like the liberals have always wanted . Soon white elected officials will become as rare as fleas on a brass monkey . What was it Ted Kennedy said after helping push the &#8216;65 Immigration Bill through ? &#8221; It&rsquo;s effect on America will be negligible&hellip;?&#8221; Obviously he was sadly mistaken or lying one .</p>

			<p>Out of control immigration and the welfare state sealed the doom of white America.  Once the droves of legal and illegal immigrants got here, their living, working and breeding (along with that of native blacks) were subsidized by the white American taxpayer, who unlike their Third World wards, had to work and work <b>hard</b> in order to be able to afford starting families and raising children.  It is no wonder that the latter are not replacing themselves biologically, even while their darker-skinned nemeses inexorably crowd them out of their former homes and havens and reduce them to a debilitated and vulnerable minority.</p>

			<p>I think it likely that the year in which whites are projected to become a minority will be revised ever downward.  The currently projected year of 2042 is too far off to raise alarm in many oblivious whites, but even the next ten years will bring unpleasant change to whites.  Consider the magnitude of change that has taken place just during the last ten years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to say at what point most whites will wake from their trance, see the handwriting on the wall and realize that we&rsquo;ve become men and women without a country.  </p>

			<p>Is this the same government that predict oil would be back down to $45 a barrel a couple years ago? There won&rsquo;t be a melting pot America. There will be a majority white half of America that has to put up with diversity - and a Hispanic monoculture America that won&rsquo;t have any diversity - that will become the 23rd or 24th Hispanic nation in the Western Hemispher - I lost count.</p>

			<p>All Whites have to do is protect their borders and have a lot of sex.  How difficult is that?</p>
<p>Seriously, it is still not too late.  We must crush the White marxists in our midst.  Then we can close and protect our borders, deport illegals, banish incorrigible criminals of all races, and have more sex.</p>

			<p>  And of course, we&rsquo;ve brought all this on ourselves. We didn&rsquo;t have to change the immigration laws in 1965, allowing huge numbers of non-Whites in while limiting the number of Europeans; we just did it. We didn&rsquo;t have to become so lax about enforcing our border controls that millions of Mexicans   &mdash;   and other Latins   &mdash;   have walked into the U.S. like they owned the place.</p>
<p>  For whatever reasons   &mdash;   White guilt, misplaced idealism, the belief that mestizo stoop labor was an absolute necessity to keep the country functioning   &mdash;   we did it to ourselves. It goes to prove that over many millenia, great civilizations have not gone down in their prime, fighting bravely but conquered by a militarily superior enemy   &mdash;   they have committed national suicide in a variety of ways. The above ways are ours.</p>

			<p>We are going to be in a fight for our lives. At this point in time, I will say categorically to everyone here to only finacially support organizations that are openly looking out for the interests of Native Born White Americans. Any immigation reform organizatin that does not make the racial transformation of the  United States their main reason for opposing post-1965 immigration should not be financially supported. Numbersusa.com,FAIR and the Center For.  Immigration studies should not be finacially supported.Numersusa opposes immigration because&hellip;immigration is bad for non-white immigration. FAIR and CIS are just as bad. The only three organizations worth financially supporting are: American Renasaince,vdare.com and Taki.</p>
<p>The good news:the anger,rage and disgust with post-1965 non-whites is just below the surface of civility.It was un leashed briefly after 9/11. The lid of civility will blow off when the catastrophes occur which they surely will.</p>
<p>One of the jobs of the regular posters here is to beat the stupid idea out of the heads that some newcomers to this site have about illegal immigration bad but non-white immigants good if they come here legally.These are people who have set Lou Dobbs-a White man who dumped his White wife of thirty years for a young and shapely mexican woman thirty years his junior-as their immigration authority figure.</p>
<p>Do not underestimate the importance of framing the immigration issue the right way. Most White Americans do not know how to psychologically defend themselves against the vicious anti- White propaganda at work and at school.The battle Native Born White Ameriacans are fighting right now is a psychological battle. If White Americans wanted to shut down non-white immigration within a few weeks-completely-they could do it. At the present point in time Native Born White Americans have internalized their own oppression. Framing the issue the right way will be crucial in helping Native Born White Americans overcomming their own internalized oppression.</p>

			<p>Many people do not understand the driving force in this unnatural transformation. Consider these facts:</p>
<p>- Businesses need relatively obedient employees who are easily manipulated, pacified, and controlled. They require workers who are generally unable to organize resistance at the group level and are unable to foment discord or rebellion in the ranks. Such employees generally are satisfied with far less compensation.</p>
<p>- Businesses also need patrons who are easily fooled into excepting lower-quality merchandise at higher prices.</p>
<p>- Likewise, the government needs a population of people who are easily controlled, manipulated, and fooled.</p>
<p>It follows that White people are the least likely to fit the needs of large corporations or the government, at least on a large scale. This is because we represent a threat to them and their profit margins. </p>
<p>Of course, in the immediate future, there will still be a need to retain some of the most intelligent Whites as complex problem solvers, but the average white person is no longer needed by the corporate leaders and governments of western society. In due course, even the most intelligent of Whites will likely be replaced by Asians of equal or greater intelligence.</p>
<p>As I write this today, many Whites no longer trust each other and such discord is increasing. Many are becoming increasingly isolated and unable to resist the constant pressure of the egalitarians. Due to many factors, there is no apparent way to organize a solid, meaningful resistance.</p>
<p>The future looks hopeless for our race.<br>

			<p>This makes me sad and PO&rsquo;ed at the same time. Though there may be a silver lining within&hellip;</p>
<p>Peter Brimelow of VDARE.com pointed out something interesting in a CNN story on this very announcment.</p>
<p>https://www.cnn.com/2008/US/08/13/census.minorities/?iref=mpstoryview </p>
<p>Mr. Brimelow singles out an interesting quote,</p>
<p>&#8220;Waddington said the timelines are not written in stone. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a projection. And things like the baby boom generation couldn&rsquo;t be predicted.&rdquo; Major changes in policy affecting families and children, or a major policy affecting immigration, could have an impact on the expectations, he said.&#8221;</p>
<p>After the recent CIS report there is some hope. But if we hope to turn this around, and prevent the need for partition, we need to keep the pressure up on all levels of government and on the illegals themselves.</p>

			<p>Not that a few more years makes any difference, but the real year is 2035.  There are about 175,000,000 Whites of European descent in this country, about 61% of the population.  The census is counting people of Middle Eastern or North African ancestry in the White category.  </p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s amazing to me that almost nothing is being done about this. You&rsquo;d think by now that &#8220;our&#8221; ruling elites would be starting to show a little concern about their prospects in a majority non-white America. I mean, what makes them think that they or their descendants will even be welcome here in 2042, either by the non-whites or by us? </p>

			<p>Whites don&rsquo;t make very compliant slaves.  We tend to successfully overthrow tyrants. It&rsquo;s in our blood.</p>
<p>That is why the unelected elites want to replace whites with cultures that are more compliant and easier to rule.   It was all part of their master plan - the brown-ification of Amnerica.</p>

			<p>OK.  Instead of complaining lets starting thinking.  What we can do to stop this trend? Obviously, if you think this trend is bad you probably wouldn&rsquo;t be here (excuse me Southern Poverty Law Center and affiliated groups, hi - by the way what do you think -just one big happy family in the future?  Even if history is replete with problems of heterogenous and multi-ethnic societies?  Why were nation states formed if heterogenous societies were successful?  Are Armenians safer in Armenia or in Turkey? Is there much racial or ethnic violence in Japan or Vermont (two very homogenous societies)?  Please read and think. Don&rsquo;t spew ignorance such as you are racist. Read next paragraph for more on this subject).  Do you get active in politics?  Do you move to Idaho?  Think realistically.  I think you need to become personally successful.  The rich always survive any crisis.  For example, the rich of Kuwait partied in Europe while the U.S. liberated Kuwait from Iraq.  The priority should also be your family.  Remember family first, then your extended family.  </p>
<p>Also, what type of America will it be?  Will it be like Russia where different fueding ethnic groups are fighting with each other with an authoritarian government trying to control it (Hello Ossetia and Georgia)? Will the country be split up?  Ethnic partition (examples Yugoslavia, British India, Soviet Union)?  Will we go to a Swiss type government with Cantons? Will states rights increase?  One thing for sure, based on immigration patterns, ethnic groups are seeking people like themselves.  Blacks are moving back to the South.  Hispanics are predominant in the Southwest and Florida.  Whites will continue to be the majority in Appalachia, the Northeast, the Upper Mid and Far West. Is California, the flash point?  Will the Chinese eventually gobble up California? The Bay Area has more Chinese than anywhere outside China. Are we to become just a third world nation like Brazil?  Slow decline, no big flare up in violence?  Are there any positives for this rapid demographic change (SPLC make your case)? Rude and ignorant people of whatever political persuasion need not respond. </p>

			<p>The U.S., as a complete whole, is lost due to the sheer arrogance and stupidity of a single generation.</p>
<p>The task is for White Americans to preserve a remnant of themselves somewhere on the North American continent.  From that seed we can grow to be great again.</p>

			<p>Lombard: I pray for a baby boom myself. I&rsquo;m sure the NWO Elite never counted on that so they invented Nam&rsquo;, the Gulf War, Afghanistan, Iraq, etc&hellip;. to wipe out more of us European&rsquo;s on top of Ted drunk Kennedy changing the 1965 Immigration Act. This WAS planned. </p>
<p>Are only real hope is Russia - they have been on a baby boom for the last 15 years or so. However, the down side is there population is in decline for several reasons due to the now defunct USSR. Putin installed some kind of program to promote young couples (married ones) to have more babies so they did not have to import anybody into there nation. it seems to be working. </p>

			<p>I heard this report on NPR this morning, just after the announcement of a talk show where the question of &#8220;Why is Oregon so White?,&#8221; was to be explored.  And on the news report, it was added that the census official stated that the only way to prevent this was to severely limit future immigration.  I couldn&rsquo;t stand to listen to the following program, which I usually have the fortitude for - this subject is just too frustrating to listen to an hour of white women discussing the dark racist past and the need for more diversity in Oregon.</p>

			<p>The definition of &#8220;white&#8221; is going to change because of this demographic phenonenom.It will become closer to what it is in Brazil, where anyone with a small percentage of &#8220;white&#8221;is called white. We will have the reverse of the one drop rule.</p>

			<p>I am happy to see that my post from last night with this info has helped lead to this thread. The difference is that this information was posted on a mainstream site. This would be equivalent to say a headline on MSNBC reporting that white south Africans are in danger of genocide or a top lefty democrat stating that Brown vs. Board of Education was a failure.</p>
<p>Anyways I wonder how could we stand in the face of history with all of our natural advantages as a people and proclaim that while the Jews in the Warsaw ghettos could rise up, the Palestinians could rise up, the Irish in northern Ireland could rise up, we 200 million white Americans could not.</p>
<p>That I find hard to believe (especially since the power structure that we would be rising up against would be mostly third worlders). <br>

			<p>As many of us have been pointing out for some time the 2050 date was bogus.  The census now says whites will be in the minority by 2042, but that number is most likely off as well.  Expect whites to become a minority by the mid to late 2030s.</p>
<p>Is it too late?  What are our options?</p>

			<p>Dear White American patriots,<br>
I was expecting this bad news, that in America whites will be in minority soon. Remember, the day native born American whites are in minority, America will finish. China, Russia and all enemies of America must have read this news and they must be celebrating. Don&rsquo;t call recent white immigrants as American Whites because they are no better than non-whites because they have more love for their back-home country as compared to America. All american politicians must learn one thing- We have seen the face of our enemy and it is me.  American politicians have made America a dumpyard for foreign refugees and illegal immigrants. Don&rsquo;t say that in 30 years American whites will be in minority, say that in 30 years America will finish. American politicians have destroyed millions of white American patriots and they have also destroyed me. I repeat-me. Why? Because I always have a respect for American whites because they made U.S.A. the world&rsquo;s most beautiful nation. U.S.A. IS STILL A PART OF MY LIFE. I come from India and I live in Toronto, Canada. I am also Caucasian.<br>
All whites must unite in America and save America from destruction.<br>
Best wishes <br>
Arvind.</p>

			<p>The multi-culti idiocy and its offspring, engineered diversity of the U.S., must lead to bloody ethnic conflict, similar to those that we have seen in former Yugoslavia, and - most recently - in Ossetia, Georgia.</p>

			<p>Specifically because of the changing demogrphics we will not remain intact as a single nation by the year 2042.  We will break apart along lines of race, ethnicity, and maybe ideology, before then.  </p>
<p>Just when that will occur is dependent on variable factors, most important being the economy, but also important is the extreme divisiveness created by the inflow of third world aliens who are dragging the country down, rather than assisting it someway.  </p>
<p>The present inflow of warm bodies would be fine if our goal is to become a nation of janitors and servers at McDonalds, but unsatisfactory for maintaining the tax base necessary to keep the economy afloat.</p>
<p>These stories are published as propaganda for the purpose of creating a mindset in whites that they are losing power and can do nothing about it.  The multicults believe that whites will be more accepting of the catastrophe that is bound to evolve, if they realize there&rsquo;s nothing they can do about it.</p>
<p>However, once again, the foolish ideologues haven&rsquo;t factored in the reality that if they keep reminding whites far too many of them to their liking will be set against being ousted from power and along with other bad news from time to time could just wake up, unite somewhat, and take a firm position against the leftist multicultural utopia.</p>
<p>Mindsets like that are just what the rainbow crowd doesn&rsquo;t want.  But advertising our demise, while trying to contain their glee, might be just another of several mistakes they&rsquo;ve made and will likely make in the near future. </p>
<p>What a joke on them it would be if their manipulation of the media brought screaming white mobs at their door, long before they&rsquo;re ready to hold hands and sing in perfect harmony with the earth&rsquo;s rainbow rabble.</p>
<p>But, whatever, it&rsquo;s all going to come down eventually, and you can take that to the bank.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m not sure even partitioning the country would help.  I&rsquo;ve travelled a number of states and I&rsquo;ve seen large numbers of &#8220;immigrants&#8221; no matter where I go.  One thing that is almost certain is that a certain percentage of the White population will emigrate after there is no where else to run in this country.  It happened in South Africa and there&rsquo;s no reason to believe it won&rsquo;t happen here.  One thing to watch is the retirees.  Florida and Arizona are no longer the meccas they used to be.  I get these bulletins all the time from International Living about buying an apartment in Italy or a condo in Costa Rica.  A person can live extremely well in many countries on just $500.00 a month.  It worries me that we might see a mass exodus of retired people out of the country who can stretch their budget alot further in Argentina or Slovenia and probably live alot safer.  These people are past their child bearing years but their leaving would make the demographic situation more acute than it is.  </p>

			<p>&ldquo;Many foresee - as whites decline more and more into &ldquo;minority&rdquo; status - they will quit running and turn around and fight. Its likely this turn of events will be due more to necessity, though, rather than bravery on their part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t happen in South Africa, it won&rsquo;t happen here.  Too many whites benefit economically from non-white labor.  They are not open to persuasion and their behavior can&rsquo;t be changed. White urbanites won&rsquo;t fight their way out, for they are accustomed to material ease and are dependent upon the system for basic needs.   On the Internet we&rsquo;re already marginalized to the outer fringe of search results.  Sooner or later the Internet will be closed to us.   That is because the first amendment does not protect &ldquo;fighting words.&rdquo;  The difference between shouting &ldquo;fire&rdquo; in a theater and fighting words is a slippery slope.  There will come a time when expressions anywhere that even remotely smell of white ethnocentrism will be classified as &ldquo;fighting words.&rdquo;  At that time we can kiss your first amendment &ldquo;rights&rdquo; goodbye. </p>
<p>Material ease, economic dependency, and moral cowardice will end it for white Americans – that is, unless enough of us change our thinking and behavior very soon.<br>

			<p>I built a site a few years ago, and I predicted the crossover would happen in 2040.</p>
<p>But that was based on a straight line projection using year 2000 census data and prior.</p>
<p>If you factor in aging baby boomers plus accelerated immigration since 2001, my guess is the real number is somewhere between 2025 and 2035.</p>

			<p>Has anyone else noticed that the major newspapers: such as the New York Times and Newsday have the readers comment section turned off on this article.  Hmm. Are they trying to limit our freedom to express our outrage&hellip;of course they are.  They know the American people are pissed off, but they want to ram this down our throats.</p>
<p>Make no mistake about it.  When Barack Obama talks about &#8220;CHANGE&#8221; he really means taking power from the White Man.  Every day as the country becomes more non-White Obama becomes stronger.  If he should become President expect him to open the gates wide open to the Third World.</p>

&#8216;The business of America is business&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In order to increase profits, you need to do one of two things:</p>
<p>1) have people consume more.</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>2) have more consumers to consume.</p>
<p>We are at a turning point here. Because of the way America has been managed for the last 100 years, American workers have spent all they can spend. They have no more buying power. Their savings are now in the negatives because they live day to day on credit. This makes 1 impossible.</p>
<p>Therefore, America is being flooded with more consumers to keep profits rising. More customers will buy more things.</p>
<p>As with any system that has no natural checks and balances, America the business is doomed to fail.</p>
<p>When and how it happens is anyone&rsquo;s guess. Will it involve racial awakening? I hope so.<br>

			<p>GlobalMinority: I&rsquo;m sorry to inject a depressing note here, but Russia is headed for decline and disaster itself.  I&rsquo;ve worked as a statistician doing demographic analyses for a while, and Russia is in almost as bad a shape as the USA, UK and Australia demographically.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no baby boom in Russia  &mdash;   over the past 15 years, Russia&rsquo;s White birth rate has been among the lowest in the West, close to the British White fertility rate (around 1.2  &mdash;   total UK birth rate is higher due to Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Zimbabwean high birth rates).  Russia&rsquo;s population is already close to 15% Muslim and growing fast, due to Tajik inflows  &mdash;   the Tajiks are &#8220;Russia&rsquo;s Mexicans.&#8221;</p>
<p>The oil wealth in Russia goes to a tiny elite, while the vast majority of Russian Whites are unable to support families.  A shocking number of Russian women as well as men are infertile, due to environmental damage from the USSR, botched abortions, high drug and alcohol use and other problems.  Drinking is killing off an entire generation of young Russian men and, increasingly, women.  Russia&rsquo;s demographic future is doomed by 2030  &mdash;   just a decade or so after &#8220;demographic doomsday&#8221; for the USA, UK and Australia.</p>
<p>The only portion of the world where Western civilization has much of a future, as our analyses have been showing, is Central Europe, especially places like Austria, Switzerland, Denmark, Germany and Hungary.  Basically, a German-speaking belt through the Alps.  The reason is that despite their own low birth rates, the German countries have &#8220;ius sanguinis&#8221; priority in their immigration system, through which ethnic Germans and Germanic/Nordic peoples with a historic relation to the Prussian, Hanseatic and Austro-Hungarian states (that is, Baltic peoples, Poles, English people  &mdash;   the Anglo-Saxons are originally from north Germany  &mdash;   Dutch and Scandinavians).  This is a pool of over a hundred million German/Nordic Diaspora in Eastern Europe and the Americas.  Also since Germany/Austria spent centuries fighting Turks, they have a stronger nationalism than the rest of the West, and even the Turks who are there are leaving due to crushing pressure from the policies.  IOW, in the dismal future that White Western civilization faces, our one most surefire is oasis is basically German-speaking Central Europe.  Fortunately, the Italians, Dutch, French, Greeks and even some Scandinavian countries are beginning to embrace the German ius sanguinis model  &mdash;   which would be considered &#8220;un-PC&#8221; in the USA, UK and Australia  &mdash;   so there may be some other regions that survive.  Many of my friends have sensed this and emigrated to places like Germany and Austria for this region, it may be the only place we can raise our children fairly soon.</p>

			<p>&#8220;All Whites have to do is protect their borders and have a lot of sex. How difficult is that?</p>
<p>Seriously, it is still not too late. We must crush the White marxists in our midst. Then we can close and protect our borders, deport illegals, banish incorrigible criminals of all races, and have more sex.&#8221;</p>
<p>Posted by Flamethrower at 7:03 PM on August 14 </p>
<p>I have thought about that, and I am a more conservative (anti-promiscuous sexual intercourse) type of person. But if such an idea were accepted, we would need to sexually separate ourselves from other races, &#8216;weed out&rsquo; those with incurable veneral diseases, and abstain from contraception. We would and do need to stop transracial adoptions and relationships similar to Heidi Klum&rsquo;s affair and marriage with Seal (a Black singer). Heidi had a White baby, before even meeting Seal.</p>
<p>Another idea is to actually reduce our excessive luxuries, and make it easy for White couples to have at least 7-9 children again. We will also make pro-environmental accomodations; I am so sick of the &#8220;environmentialists,&#8221; who spend all of their energy telling Whites to stop having children, while on the other hand encouraging non-Whites to procreate without any restraint, and ignore the immigration issue completely. (The Environmental Establishment cares more about eliminating the White race than even &#8220;saving the planet.&#8221;)</p>
<p>We need to pressure Whites into having White children, again. In principle it is their right to remain childless; and as another poster said, it is even their right to race-mix. However, we also have the rule of &#8216;in practice.&rsquo; In and of itself, I agree it would be great to just &#8216;weed out&rsquo; the present-day race-mixers, but I am afraid we can&rsquo;t even afford that anymore. If we promote or even permit miscegenation at this rate, we will die as a distinct people in North America, and maybe even in Europe and Greater Syria. We need to wake up, and reinstate positive social &#8220;peer&#8221; pressure. We actually need racial confrontations. I wouldn&rsquo;t support the beating of Justin Barker, and would have protected him, even if it meant no publicity; but with it already happening, and no way to repeal the physical assault, the Jena 6 issue is great for our cause. </p>
<p>The Official Mainstream media is the visible open, and our private communications will be the Underground Railroad. Whites will be woken up, with an oblivious Mainstream Media. Then, there can be no racial neutals, for Whites. White far-leftists will have to support the Black Panthers and Mecha&rsquo;s, or their co-ethnics. Only one or the other. No &#8220;and&rsquo;s,&#8221; and no &#8220;neither&rsquo;s.&#8221;</p>

Would they get the message?

			<p>A few people here have mentioned fleeing to a whiter country. Where? Canada, Europe, and Australia have similar immigration policies/problems as the USA. Whites have always been a minority in the world (Europe, North America, and Australia have always had a lot smaller population than the rest of the world), there will soon come a time when whites are not the majority in any single country/region. I don&rsquo;t look forward to this time.</p>

			<p>It seems as though many white people do not seem to believe, or even wish to consider  that it is even possible to lose everything, even as they steadily do.  </p>
<p>Even among those who do see the problem, the threat of whites being dispossessed of absolutely everything ( In fact, it&rsquo;s not merely a threat, it&rsquo;s a process that is well underway, and accelerating.) often seems to provoke a reaction of a pathetic, desperate fantasy: &#8220;When things get worse, we&rsquo;ll be that much closer to a reaction that will sort it all out!&#8221;  No, as things get worse, we are simply that much closer to being dead.  </p>
<p>I keep wondering how long until we see those &#8220;END WHITE MINORITY RULE!&#8221; placards we used to see paraded around some African countries being used in America.  We can look at Detroit (or Haiti, or Zimbabwe) for a clear example of what the future promises if we allow them to continue marching whites everywhere off the gangplank of history.  </p>
<p>Whites have already been made slaves, being forced to work for the last 40 years for (what else is it when you must work, and the fruits of your labor goes to others, whether you like it or not?) the benefit of those who use what they gain to further oppress whites, who are beaten, raped, robbed, murdered and driven from their communities by the ever increasing hordes of brown skinned invaders. </p>
<p>If the approximately 40 trillion dollars that has been taken from whites in America  to be given to blacks were available to the whites, (and not in the form of a stream of financial support and sinister encouragement to abort white babies) no doubt they would find it far easier to have and raise children of their own. </p>
<p>The costs of more than 2/3 of black babies born in the US are completely subsidized by the taxpayer.  Each one of those is born at the expense of a white baby that could have been born had the means to support it not been stolen!  </p>
<p>Everyone here knows the rates at which those black babies will grow up to make victims of the whites that manage to get born despite the ever increasing pressure against them. </p>
<p>This madness must be ended, or we will be ended!  </p>
<p>The confiscation of the wealth and property of white people, for the transference of it to black people, must end immediately!   The ethnic cleansing of whites from various communities and cities must be stopped.</p>
<p>We must not continue to elect governance that destroys our country, our culture, and our people.  Neither should we submit to our own destruction, under any circumstances.<br>

<p>Great idea.  I&rsquo;ve thought the same thing myself - what can they do?</p>
<p>Also, I wanted to add that I am doing everything I can to stay in top physical shape, building up my immune system, and learning all I can about natural ways to better my health.  I think that it would be wise if everyone else here does the same, for the coming dark depression that we are about to enter into which will most likely lead to food rationing, excessive food prices (this is just the beginning), violence and fighting over food and other necessities, and great suffering&hellip; especially for those who are not healthy and who depend on pharmaceuticals. </p>
<p>I am also planning on learning how to grow my own organic produce without relying on pesticides, growing herbs and learning their uses in health, food storage, and other goals to become self sufficient.  I read the following websites: Naturalnews.com,<br>
https://www4.dr-rath-foundation.org,<br>
Mercola.com,<br>
https://www.westonaprice.org/,and <a href="https://www.lifeaftertheoilcrash.net/" rel="nofollow">https://www.lifeaftertheoilcrash.net</a> (even if one doesn&rsquo;t agree with the peak oil premise, there is still a lot of good information on becoming self sufficient on this website.)</p>
<p>If you are addicted to sugar,processed food,cigarettes, alcohol&hellip; certain amino acids will instantly wipe out any desire for these un-healthy substances.  Just do a search on the web, and there are also several books as well. We have to be healthy and in superior physical condition to survive these challenging times ahead of us&hellip; even if you are older, it&rsquo;s never too late. </p>

			<p>Why do Whites in America and Europe think millions of non-Whites risk life and limb and leave behind their country of birth to immigrate to America or Europe?  It&rsquo;s quite obvious   &mdash;   because the non-White countries from which they come are third-world hellholes and they seek to live in a better place.</p>
<p>Mark my words: as soon as non-Whites become a majority in America or Europe both places will become third-world hellholes too.  It&rsquo;s already happening in those districts, states, and cities in America and Europe where non-Whites are in the majority&hellip;major increases in crime, poverty, pollution, and a host of other social ills.</p>
<p>White Americans and Europeans   &mdash;   this is the future unless we start fighting for our rights again.  Eveything that our ancestors fought for, courageously settled, populated, and built will be ceded to a bunch of third-worlders who will turn it in to another third-world country.</p>

			<p>I do believe, you are being a little pessimistic. 22,000,000 of the 47,000,000 &#8220;so-called&#8221; hispanics are considered white. Hispanics are mating with whites at a fast rate. Whites are not going to be the minority. There are 10 million hispanic children in our schools, 55 million white. These articles are fear-mongering at it&rsquo;s best. Whites will never be a minority in the near future, here in the U.S. They are trying to psyche you out, to make you believe the survival of the white race can not happen. It is a ruse, people. You are doing exactly, what these stories want you to do. Paralyze you with fear. There is nothing to fear. If that is what you are doing. I do not know, who is more responsible for these stories. Whites, who want us to react to these &#8220;so-called&#8221; statistics. Or, hispanics, who want you to believe, they have more power than they do. It is called psychological warfare. Don&rsquo;t buy into it. We do not have to rid our country of illegals, because of the demise to whites. We need to rid our country of illegal, because it is a threat to our nation.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Every day as the country becomes more non-White Obama becomes stronger. If he should become President expect him to open the gates wide open to the Third World.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Juan McCain has almost exactly the same policies as Obama in this regard, in fact McCain has been pushing for massive border opening for much longer and much more intensively than Obama has been.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I actually think that Barack Obama being President, might be the best thing to happen to White America since the 1965 immigration catastrophe.  It would finally show us, squarely, how far we&rsquo;ve fallen as a people, how the leadership of our own nation has slipped from our grasp.  It might be the one thing that inspires racial consciousness in us as a people, enough to overcome the oppression of political correctness.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve thought the same thing myself.

Refuse to debate, refuse to answer honestly to polls, refuse to have a discussion, refuse to buy certain products or live in certain areas.  Even now, I get the impression that Leftists are begging recalcitrant White America to vote for Barry or at least talk about why we won&rsquo;t.  Refuse to talk to them until and unless they start being fair, much as you would any irrational or unreasonable person.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Are only real hope is Russia&#8221;</p>
<p>Seriously, how deracinated and rootless are you to declare &#8220;are future&#8221; to be in Russia? Do you people really estimate so highly the meaning of a white skin, totally disconnected from any other identity? When the people on this board talk about all European peoples as being interchangeable, and suggest that we simply start playing Musical Countries to survive, the real deep psychological disconnect between &#8220;whites&#8221; and their roots becomes clear. You still apparently dont understand how deep ethnicity goes (hint: its even deeper than visual similarity, it defies the capacity of our most advanced perception to plumb the real depths of it).</p>
<p>What we often hear on this board is actually the moaning of recent transplants (how American can &#8220;Miroslav&#8221; be?), people with Eastern european or recent european immigrant backgrounds, who until recently still lived in ethnic communities and still have ethnic ties, basically saying &#8220;abandon ship&#8221;. </p>
<p>The existence of these people is to me proof that even european immigration has harmed this nation, by harming the national unity that springs from the pre-1900 American experience. Its alot easier for these people to abandon ship because they only ever felt half-American in the first place. </p>
<p>No surprise, when America no longer becomes a really desirable place to live, it will shed some layers of &#8220;half-American&#8221; opportunists who are basically here so long as the cash keeps flowing. Put another way: adversity will bring to light even the fine cracks and divisions in our unity which we thought we had long since plastered over. </p>
<p>The pessimism and doomsday-ism I sometimes hear voiced here is understandable as an emotional reaction but ultimately meaningless for a grown person who has control of themselves. Are you committed to struggle for the existence of your nation, or arent you? Are you going to see this through to the end, or arent you? If you are, you dont care what your chances of victory are. If you&rsquo;re only going to struggle when you think you have a good chance of winning, good luck winning anything with an attitude like that. Chance swings back and forth, and so do men&rsquo;s estimations of it. A non-committed person constantly looks for signs of success or failure, a committed person plows on regardless. </p>

			<p>To the poster at 9.47 that posted about buying a condo in Costa Rica or Italy and said,,, &#8220;there are places on can live good on $500 a month&#8221;&hellip;..   I live in Costa Rica for a good part of the year and can disagree with that statement. In fact it costs more or less the same to live there as it does in the usa. Food is cheaper, gas and anything car related is a lot more, anything imported which is most everything exept food is more. If you want to live like a 3rd worlder you could probably survive, just survive on $1000 a month. If you want to live in a decent place near other gringos its about the same as here, taken everything in perspective. However, health care costs are less, which is ok as long as you are not seriously sick, if you get really bad sick you need to come back home. As far as Italy and the european nations, I have visited most of them and with our declining dollar it takes more money than here to live. I have never visited the aisian nations but bet overall its not much cheaper to live as one would live here, once again if you want to live in a tin shack with dirt floor it would be cheap. But I think with the changing demograpics and the left wing political landscape we face its important to scope out a place to run. last week I returned from a 2 week stay in Colombia and that may just be the place for me. Colombia, drug wars, murder capital of the world. Pablo Escobar&hellip;  What the world does not know is that the war is over, Pablo is dead, and the good guys run the place now. They are right wing and our best freind in the area, a buffer and enemy to next door Chavez. Colombia has oil, emeralds, gold, and a huge manufacturing base. A capatalistic society. Low taxes. Few blacks exept on the coast and they are not coddled like here. Medellin actually has the look and feel of a first world city, and now is one of the safest cities of its size in the world. Big change in a small time.          </p>

			<p>The American ship of state is on auto-pilot heading for the edge of the cliff. Everything will continue to go in the current direction unless there is a catastrophe of some kind that forces whites to come together as a group and take up our own defense. The deeply felt cri de coeurs that Amren contributors write are a drop in the ocean, as wonderful as it is to know that we share an understanding of the dire threat our civilization faces. That is why paradoxically, we must hope and pray for a collapse of the economy, nukes going off in DC and NY, an EMP attack, etc. While I wish no harm to come to my brothers and sisters, I know that this is the only way whites will be motivated to save ourselves. Sad, but true. </p>

			<p>I read about this only recently on a newsite, and was struck, though not shocked, by the number of blacks who were gleefully mocking whites over their projected decline in this country. One wrote &#8220;HA! We have a black man about to become president, and now one day we are going to outnumber you&#8221; Others were talking about the end of white power and the true rise black power.</p>
<p>It seems most of them fail to grasp the fact that the projected growth will be among Hispanics, who are continuously immigrating, and having children in massive numbers. They also fail to see that, this will in no way result in black power for them. Quite the contrary in fact, Black-Hispanic relations are at an all time low these days, with racial conflict on the rise. </p>
<p>Few of them want to face the fact, that with an ever-growing non white under-class, and a shrinking white middle class, will only hurt the economy, the job market, and all those nice perks, they have come to take for granted for so long now. This also includes white middle class tax dollars which support so many of them. They might be laughing now, but they won&rsquo;t be later on.</p>

			<p>A large number of these non-whites are not american citizens. We have huge numbers of non-whites here illegally as well as those here legally but not citizens. If we go into a serious economic depression, most of these will leave and that will reduce the non-white numbers significantly. It makes me hope for a depression and for things to get so bad whites wake up. </p>

<p>No, those are two symptoms of a much larger problem.  A problem that is rarely discussed, which is exactly why it&rsquo;s been able to get out of hand.<br>
Whites have no sense of purpose or direction because they have no Will.</p>
<p>The Liberal-Left-Neocon Leviathan, as I like to call it, is devoted to attacking the Family.<br>
But Whites aren&rsquo;t interested in defending it.</p>
<p>I know, not just from my own experience, but from many - many - others, that White families routinely engaged, and engage, in Abuse and Neglect and cover it up in Liberal talk.<br>
Just look at the Kennedys. <br>
It is true that some of the work of Family Systems has been passed through the PC filter.  But what they really have to say is still there and it is still effective.  <br>
Family Systems is based on Systems thinking which goes back to Darwin, who was an Ecological thinker.  Such people think in terms of Relationships between the parts of a whole.  It was a devastating challenge to Platonic thought, and it makes Mincemeat out of Marx.<br>
I am convinced that a huge part of our problem is that we do not have an updated relationship with our greatest thinkers.  We still don&rsquo;t get them.  And I don&rsquo;t think we get Darwin, not by a long shot.  </p>

Where will their welfare checks, medical care, government services, and all their free goodies (not to mention actual jobs) come from when white America goes under?  Who will take care of them?  Who will keep it going? Do they really think they can take over and run the ship all by themselves?  Some joke!</p>

<p>As for the &#8220;Greatest Generation&#8221; - that is overblown.  Only a very small percentage of Americans did the storming of beaches and dying in WW2.  Most everyone else, was working hard, yes, but also enjoying the ongoing party behind the lines.  My own father was in the Navy, but his chief memories seem to be of all the prostitutes he got clap from.  I had a patient who had been a brakeman on a train in the U.S. during the war, he (among others) said most of the ones who remained behind, and they were the majority - were a pretty bad lot; draft-dodging zoot-suiters.  Unless you were in the fight, it was all about booze, jitterbugging and seducing women whenever possible.  The &#8220;job&#8221; done, that generations self-centered paranoia fed the overblown reactionary Cold War and financial swindles of the 1950s and 60s and the rise of the very military/industrial complex that Eisenhower warned of.  Selfishness led them to cut spending on education, producing its attending results.  They refused to listen to warnings of the limits of oil and the need to change, until now when we have a real crisis and it is likely too late anyway.  It is that very generation who neglected, used and abused its children, producing the &rsquo;60s revolt and its generational products which they grandparented.  The truth is, the Greatest Generation set the stage for the Boomer&rsquo;s failures.  Then, they just went off in their motorhomes to enjoy the Golden Years that few of their progenity will ever know.</p>

<p>&gt; I am sorry, but I have to disagree with this assessment of history and the further implications of its author.  The wealthy were the targets of the French Revolution and all the revolutions in Europe during the 19th century up to and including the Russian Revolution.  </p>
<p>The mistaken idea is that the wealthy will actually lead any white movement for survival.  Wealthy people - especially today - have the means to seperate themselves from the masses who are suffering, including their white bretheren who are not as economically advantaged as they.  My experience with people with money is that they can justify their lifestyles with their vacations and &#8220;live large&#8221; philosophies, unable or unwilling to be moved by arguments about race, etc., when it is so unseemly to do so.  No, it will be the poorer whites who see what is happening and wish to do something about it that will lead.  We may have a few wealthy among us, but that is rare.  Action will come when the poor white, formerly middle class population has increased to a critical mass.  </p>

<p>A very good example of what is so mindnumbing about mainstream media: a complete lack of intellectual diversity. Diversity (racial variety) is to be mindlessly celebrated, racism (whatever that means) is to be hysterically condemned. It never occurs to mainstream media drones that overused definitions and terms harden into cliches that limit one&rsquo;s perception and understanding. And NPR is considered &#8220;intelligent&#8221; media. Beam me up Scotty. </p>

<p>I know the Census Bureau says that about half of hispanics are White but I think that figure is greatly exaggerated.  Since 70% of hispanics living here are Mexicans, that&rsquo;s just not possible.  I used to live in Florida at one time and I&rsquo;ve made trips down to Miami (on the way to the Everglades) which probably has one of the largest White hispanic populations in America.  Some things I&rsquo;ve noticed is you can tell who is hispanic White and who is non-hispanic White alot of the time.  Some of them may technically be White but they have certain features or qualities that have a subtle Mezo-American look to them.  Yes, alot of Whites are marrying hispanics but I think in many cases it&rsquo;s just destroying the gene pool if these people are an admixture.  One other thing that seems noticeable is that even White hispanics don&rsquo;t assimilate very well.  Spanish is the defacto language of Miami and the city itself does not have a first world feel about it. </p>

<p>When I see a proud ethnocentric anti-globalist nation like Russia roll across the border to protect its own ethnics in Ossetia, it makes my heart race with glee because I know it shook up the one-worlders elitist agenda.  I listen to the news and the Bush Administration&rsquo;s affirmative action bellhop, Condoleeza Rice, is in Georgia making a speech.  I explode with laughter as she impotently tells Russia that since Georgia signed a peace treaty, all Russian military forces need to withdraw.  I would love nothing more than to see Putin mock her in typical black fashion.  &#8220;Don&rsquo;t you get up all in my grill girl.  You ain&rsquo;t all that.  Whats you gonna do if I don&rsquo;t?

No.  I still care about America but not this America.  I want to know where I stand.

			<p>I do not believe that there is any way to restore the country politically.  The two parties are in cahoots with each other to rob us blind and destroy our race, that is clear.  Has any Republican ran on an unambiguous demand that affirmative action be ended?  That even illegal immigration be stopped?  Forget politics, except for its educational value to the unenlightened.  <br>
     Our only hope, and it is a brutal one, is for a catastrophe, as The Saint wrote.  There are many possibilities for society-cracking events, some fairly gradual, some instantaneous.  The gradual catastrophes, environmental or economic, will get us in the end, if some overnight disaster doesn&rsquo;t come first.  But I think that the overnight catastrophe will hit us, hard.  The Saint mentions a nuke on New York City.  The whole wealth of this country is not in its industrial power, but in speculation, the belief that the stuff we own will increase in value.  With Wall Street a smoking hole, who will bet their future on the hope that they can sell their investments for more than they paid?  The paper wealth of this country will evaporate overnight, and the government will be unable to keep its promises of easy living for all.  Tax receipts will plummet and you&rsquo;ll be filling your own potholes.  Some might think that&rsquo;s an ugly thing to hope for, but is it possible that every terrorist will be perpetually foiled, that none of the tens of thousands of nuclear weapons in the world will find its way to someone willing use it?  BTW, where are South Africa&rsquo;s nukes?  <br>
     Many Whites are held in place by a fear of being out of vogue, but many are also kept silent by a well-founded belief that speaking their minds will cost them their jobs.  Our Ruler&rsquo;s model is the German Democratic Republic.  By the 1970s, the East Germans had largely dispensed with the more brutal aspects of the police state, relying instead on the withholding of privileges.  Watch what you say, or someone else gets your apartment, you will be demoted at work, and your son will not be accepted at the university.  But when the government can no longer bestow favors, it can no longer withhold them.  Will private employers, desperate to stay afloat, hang on to their affirmative action hires and discard their most productive people?  Or will Whitey hold his tongue when he can&rsquo;t feed himself?  There will be some vicious scrambling when the laws of politics are replaced by the law of the jungle.<br>
     We know, as riot after riot has shown, that Blacks and Browns need little provocation to resort to violence.  Will the unemployed White who, judging from his choice of neighborhoods and schools for his kids, already knows the score on race be willing to tolerate the sight of these people looting?   I believe that the average White will not fight until the war comes to his street.  I also think that it is likely to happen.  And few Whites will be fighting shoulder to shoulder with their non-White &#8220;friends&#8221;.  Those friends will be teaming up with their own kind, and our liberals will become some of their first victims.  <br>
     And when it&rsquo;s over, we can comfort ourselves with the knowledge that this country had maybe 100 million Whites in 1930.  That&rsquo;s plenty enough people to re-establish a vibrant, civilized society.</p>

<p>Yes, but they will go from &#8220;You are the majority!&#8221; to &#8220;You are the largest racial group.&#8221; I agree it doesn&rsquo;t make sense, but they will continue making excuses. They attack us as the nominal majority, until we are the minority (even disregarding illegal aliens). Then they will attack us as the largest racial group, until the Hispanics are the largest racial group. Then we will be forced into the Hispanic group, and not allowed survival and/or even the true timing of our eventual extinction in America; or we will be attacked, while the Blacks and eventually even the Asians and Arabs/Muslims outnumber us. And then it will be about ending &#8220;White Minority Rule,&#8221; as it is in South Africa and Zimbabwe. </p>
<p>If the White self-haters succeed, America will eventually be more dangerous for a White, than a shark tank.</p>

			<p> <i>A very good example of what is so mindnumbing about mainstream media: a complete lack of intellectual diversity. Diversity (racial variety) is to be mindlessly celebrated, racism (whatever that means) is to be hysterically condemned. It never occurs to mainstream media drones that overused definitions and terms harden into cliches that limit one&rsquo;s perception and understanding. And NPR is considered &ldquo;intelligent&rdquo; media. </i><br>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..<br>
The abstract  (and always undefined) concept of &#8220;racism&#8221;, once it&rsquo;s accepted as the worst sin and greatest plague afflicting the human condition, then looms as the greatest evil of our time, virtually the Devil incarnate (or his modern replacement).  Diversity then becomes its antidote. Since diversity equals Good and racism equals Bad, the whole thing is reduced to a  simple moral question of good vs. evil. Therefore, no debate is necessary.  And no dissent is tolerated.  What sane, right-minded person would argue against Good or in favor of Evil?  Anyone who would, is obviously morally diseased, to say the least.</p>
<p>Thus, the issues of &#8220;racism&#8221; and &#8220;diversity&#8221; have been placed beyond the limits of legitimate debate in the holy doctrines of the new secular religion of the 21st century.  In many countries now, they may not be doubted or questioned under pain of prison, heavy fines, loss of livelihood and reputation, and destruction of one&rsquo;s career.  As always,  you mess with the established religion at your peril!</p>

     I don&rsquo;t know.  Politics is a conspiracy of criminals and traitors, and we can only guess at their intentions.  I am certain, however, that there are people in positions of power who see eye-to-eye with us.  How could there not be?  We racialists are nothing out of the ordinary, we&rsquo;re simply aware of what is in plain view of everyone.  Even liberals secretly agree with us, as they prove when they pass up all that bargain real estate in America&rsquo;s ghettos and barios.  Our silent allies in government and the corporate world would be expelled from their positions if they were discovered, and so hold their tongues, awaiting their moment.  The Rulers, knowing that these patriots must exist, are constantly watching for them.  That is, I think, the reason for these constant warnings of racism, these childish taboos that spring up.  What?!  A Confederate flag the size of a handkerchief was seen in a maintenance shed at a private golf course where VP Cheney played?  An 18 year old boy hung a noose from his truck?  These absurd, but real, examples of  thought control come from the fear of the Rulers that someone is plotting against them.  And all those who hold power, or hope to, must share the Rulers&rsquo; indignation or else find themselves on the way out.  Each new absurdity is a test question: &#8220;Are you one of us traitors?&#8221;  It&rsquo;s all very Soviet.<br>
     But as these lackeys of the regime pass the Rulers&rsquo; tests, are they also failing another test?  Is the country being set up for The Big Cull?  Anyone with any foresight can see that the world is headed for some hard times, and a nation of 100 million humans and 200 million people will have a hard time holding its own in a time of international scarcity.  How many liberals can plausibly argue that they are an asset to the nation?  As long as the country&rsquo;s fighting troops, especially all the special operations types, are White, I have to wonder if all these traitors and grovelers are being given enough rope to hang themselves.  That&rsquo;s hard to imagine, but as our situation is so unreal, the unlikely becomes possible.<br>

			<p>The idea of democratic self-government and of majority rule is actually quite a novel concept  in the world and  a fairly recent one.   In other times and places,  until recently, minority rule was almost universal rather than majority rule.  Small minorities of social or racial classes ruled successfully over vast masses. This was not seen as anything unusual; it was the standard situation.  From the Greeks in Egypt and throughout the Hellenistic world to the British in India to the Afrikaners in South Africa, these minorities successfully ruled populations that greatly outnumbered them.  In many countries, other small but disciplined social or ethnic groups manage to wield great clout far in excess of their numbers. They are generally accustomed to getting their way   &mdash;   and they do. Their small numbers are not an impediment.</p>
<p>Majority rule served us in America well when our people were the majority. But ultimately it failed the test in defending the interests of the majority, allowing the minority/ies to  become more important than the majority, and then more numerous as well. The principal of majority rule became easy to subvert by those who had the money and organization and determination to do so, once they figured out how.</p>
<p>It may well  be that we will have to readjust our political thinking to  learn to see the world through the eyes of a minority rather than still as the majority. It can be done. And  wealthy, powerful minorities can continue to rule  over an undisciplined mass if they do it right.  All is not lost. </p>

			<p>2008 to 2042 is just 34 years. We are as close to 1974 as we are to this. Its not that far away. If you can remember the seventies you can see we are a lot closer to this awful day then people realize. This will see the disintegration of the USA. I fully expect to see much, if not all, of the southwest revert to Mexico, a kind of reversal of the Mexican-American war. We may be faced with a &#8220;Kosovo&#8221; situation right here at home.

I propose we persuade this politician to go on a public forum and declare that she will do everything in her power to preserve white people as the majority because they built the country. Even if it means closing the border and deportations.   If she doesn&rsquo;t do this we will hold her up as a politician who turned over the country to alien peoples. We shall tell our grandchildren this. If on the other hand she does this, she will be a hero. We shall toast her with champagne. Here&rsquo;s hoping we be drinking champagne.</p>

			<p>You have to understand what these projections are based on.  It assumes legal immigration continues unchecked.  Also, the Census Bureau does not ask a person if they are legal or illegal and everyone is counted the same.  Illegal immigration and their &#8220;American&#8221; offspring are also figured in these projections.  In the legal American population, 75% of people are non-hispanic White.  If legal immigration were curtailed from the third world and most illegals deported, we would not be facing the kind of gloomy future they are predicting.  It does not have to be this way.</p>

			<p>The only real power whites ever had was through their money, education and jobs, which freed them up to move to areas away from more economically depressed areas, which were swarming with non whites. </p>
<p>But our Marxist leaders saw to it that Affirmative Action made it possible for blacks and other non whites, who were less qualified, were able to get the educations, and job openings that might have gone to whites. Then they brought section 8 housing to the suburbs. Then came subprime loans, given out to blacks and even illegals with dismal credit histories. And now we have a housing market that is in the toilet, and are living in a recession, that could fast turn into a depression. </p>
<p>Now we are looking at the possiblity of a Black president who wants to force American children to learn Spanish, so they can welcome in more illegals. Their plot has worked folks. In less than 35 years, our country which was founded and run by whites for hundreds of years is about to turn non white in less than 35 years. </p>
<p>Where will whites go? Every European country has adopted the same Marxist scheme. And by then most of Europe will likely be non-white as well. The rule has been non white countries for non whites, and white countries for everybody. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t count on any perks when we become the minority. There will be no Afirmative Action for us. Non-whites never operated that way. </p>
<p>Through the centuries whites fought numerous wars and battles to keep their land and way of life. Whites were able to spot a hostile invasian for what they were, and were inspired to fight back. But missed this subversive plot against us, that started in the 1960&rsquo;s. After years of brainwashing through white guilt, and PC propaganda, we have become meek as lambs, waiting helplessly for the slaughter.</p>

<p> As things stand now, racial realist whites would have little chance of winning against the coercive power of the United States Government.  The American population is very content with its lot in life. As long as white Americans can watch American Idol on television, have a six pack in the icebox, and a SUV in the driveway; they won&rsquo;t support violent governmental change. Senseless violence would only turn people against racial realism. It will take a major depression or total economic catastrophe to change this situation. </p>

<p>This report is probably alot worse than it looks.  The White population is expected to gain roughly 3 million between now and 2050.  Only 175 million Whites have European ancestry and the rest are Middle Eastern and North African peoples.  Since these people have higher birthrates than Europeans, it&rsquo;s a pretty good bet that German-Americans, Italian-Americans, Irish-Americans, etc. are being replaced with Lebanese, Syrians, Iraqis, etc.</p>

I really meant your situation (our situation really because the whole english speaking world follows you) needs a drastic solution, a revolution of sorts to change this situation. <br>
And the two ways as I see it (as fantastical as all this sounds)would either quick change, a bloody coup (all your white citizens would have to be eating dog food for 6 months for that to happen, and frankly it&rsquo;s unlikely to happen as we white are all pretty brainwashed) or getting hit my a meteor or nuclear strike and surviving ther aftermath Katrina style and rebuilding the country from stratch.<br>
Realistically the slow change is more likely to be happen, which means grass roots political change and waiting another four years for the Republicians to get whoever nominated(I say Arnold because the masses like their cartoon charactors and would probably vote for him just because of his movie past).I say get who ever nominated,saying whatever just to get power back (the figurehead), but you need the right group behind him controling them(what&rsquo;s new about this).<br>
Then once back in power you need a network of high placed offcials to redirect the country back to its original form.<br>
(maybe a bloody coup is more realistic after all).<br>
The multi-cult version of utopia is floored, you(we) had utopia in the 1950&rsquo;s when you could leave your house unlocked all night, why try to reinvent the wheel. <br>
American and the rest of us need to get hard again and genocide of a people over 70 years is pretty drastic it itself.<br>

			<p>For me, it feels like that awful days has already arrived since I live in Southern California. And being native Californian, who can remember the 70&rsquo;s, and can remember when 34 years back, California was still considered the place to be, and it was! The hills and pacific coast are still pretty, and the climate is still nice, but oh, how the rest of the scenery has changed.</p>

<p>Like you I remember the 70s in NY not California ( I was born in the 60s). I posted once before about watching the movie Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 which I believe came out in 1970 or 71. The movie opened with a pan shot of a Manhattan subway platform and-it was mainly white folks. A black or Hispanic face here or there but very caucasoid. The newstand proprietor was a seemingly Jewish individual, not a South Asian.</p>
<p>In the late 80s I would often go into the City (I&rsquo;m a suburban kid). Six years ago I started a job in NYC and the comparison to the late 80s, a mere 15-20 years is shocking. ALL of NY has become Chinatown. And I don&rsquo;t hate Asians but&hellip;the times they are a changin and in fact have&hellip;I see kids commuting into Stuyvestant High School, the elite NYC public school, and they are overwhelmingly Asian. </p>
<p>I can go on and on but my point is 1)in some places it already is 2042 and 2)I know many dislike NYC and/or cities in general but they were in many ways a fulfillment of white, European culture and to lose them for the high desert of Idaho or Montana&hellip;well that seems a poor choice as well. </p>

<p>The Census department press release is available here:<br>
https://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/population/012496.html</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some statistics in that press release that are missing from the Bloomberg article:</p>
<p>    * In 2050, the nation&rsquo;s population of children is expected to be 62 percent minority, up from 44 percent today. Thirty-nine percent are projected to be Hispanic (up from 22 percent in 2008), and 38 percent are projected to be single-race, non-Hispanic white (down from 56 percent in 2008).</p>
<p>    * The working-age population is projected to become more than 50 percent minority in 2039 and be 55 percent minority in 2050 (up from 34 percent in 2008). Also in 2050, it is projected to be more than 30 percent Hispanic, 15 percent black and 9.6 percent Asian.</p>

			<p>In retrospect, it will be seen that the Reagan Amnesty of 1986 (supposedly a &#8216;great conservative&rsquo;), will be seen as huge mistake and THE turning point.<br>

Always, but always reject &#8216;amnesties&rsquo;, nothing &#8216;humanitarian&rsquo; about them, simply a unilateral surrender by the receiving side.</p>

<p>Thomas Chittum makes the point that Goverments armed to teeth with tanks,jet fighters and other high tech weaponary have their achilles heal. Chittum was specifically referring to the Old Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloch Nations. The Old Order was overthrown. The nukes,fighter jets an tanks were useless against the insurections.</p>
<p>But you miss my fundamental point. The posters on American Renassaince are suppose to set an example of uncompromising resistance so as to inspire others to do the same when the catastrophes hit the US. Their is no other choice but uncompromising resistance to the racial dispossession of Native Born White Americans.</p>
<p>Peter Brimelow seems to pushing the envelope on White resistance to the racial transformation of America over at vdare.com Today is Virgina Dares birthday. Steve Sailer as usual ignores the threat of LEGAL asian immigrants. No one should have any doubt about the game Sailer is playing:Asian immigration full speed ahead. Finacially support American  Renassaince. <br>

			<p>These alarming proclamations by government census bureaucrats deliberately leave one very important fact out of their demographic equations.  They assume that whites will all roll over and play dead while hispanics breed themselves into the majority and hijack our nation.  The very real possibility of a white initiated demographic correcting race war simply never enters their minds&hellip;   <br>

<p>Posted by S &amp; GS at 9:00 PM on August 17 </p>
<p>Actually the movie was released late in 74&rsquo; and I remember seeing it as a boy on HBO or Showtime in &#8216;75.  But your point still stands.</p>
<p>In fact, two years ago I watched three Movies in succession&hellip;</p>
<p>Breaking Away<br>
My Bodyguard<br>
and<br>
A Little Romance</p>
<p>These all came out around 1979-1980.<br>
Charming, Entertaining, and all White.<br>
Even by the mid-90&rsquo;s I still held out some hope.<br>
But by 1999-2000 I began to think it might be time to get out of NYC, so I did.<br>
Anyway, watching those movies was much more emotional than I thought (I hadn&rsquo;t seen them since they came out). But mostly it was just sad.  Same thing happened when I watched the Beatles Anthology Video.  <br>
But I have to say this -<br>
We have GOT to stop this Doomsday Echo Chamber.<br>
Quality will triumph over Quantity.  But that&rsquo;s only if you fight.  And you&rsquo;ve got to be in to win! If there is potential to improve Quality then there&rsquo;s a chance; simply because Quantity will always implode on itself, garunteed. But, when it comes to thinning the herd, the first place I would start is with the Chicken Littles within our ranks.  Knock it off; be in to win or step aside.  It&rsquo;s so unbecoming and so depressing.  Is THAT how you want to go out?</p>

			<p>As scary as the thought is of being a minority, keep in mind, no other single race will be a majority.  The white race is the strongest and most intelligent (liberals and most politicians not included).  Our race is also the only one capable of true leadership.</p>

That&rsquo;s also something neither the liberals, the globalists or your &#8216;caring&rsquo; government want you to think about!</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know, it would seem that not all of Europe will make it either.  A lot of the news coming out of England, France, Sweden, and the Netherlands is awfully depressing.</p>
<p>Also, the European countries are nearing the brink of a massive demographic winter that&rsquo;ll affect their respective White populations; it is within the realm of possibility that some of these same countries might open themselves up to the more industrious White peoples of North America in order to stave off population decline.</p>

<p>I came here in 1989 with my parents when I was ten.  In my experience there is alot of discrimination against Europeans here in the US, a country that is supposed to be the zenith of Western Civilization.  I&rsquo;ve had some fleeting thoughts myself of leaving.  May I ask your reason for wanting to leave?</p>

			<p>If the truth is known, White America is already a minority.  Over the course of 300 years, some Whites have been miscegenating with Indians and blacks to the effect that their descendants are no longer genetically Europoid.  I read somewhere the percentage of White Americans with mixed blood is something like 30%.  Some people who pass themselves off as White would not be considered White by European standards.  America&rsquo;s industrial and technological genius has been fueled over the decades by fresh infusions of European genes which have been diluting the impurities found in the American gene line.  This is no longer happening on a significant scale.  Europeans no longer look at America with the fondness they once had.  Europeans are content to stay in their own countries among their own people.  They get free medical care and free tuition.  Plus there&rsquo;s a social safety net in place that doesn&rsquo;t exist in the US.   </p>

			<p>It is sickening to sit here and read some of the postings.  Where is the insight into what the article is really talking about.  I have understood for some time now that there are genetic reasons as to why the white race is now at negative population growth.  The white race has gone through this twice in its existence.  There were two bottleneck periods where the numbers declined.  The way whites came out of this was through incest.  Now, I am not promoting incest because the act itself is the very reason why the white race can no longer reproduce itself.  This problem cannot be placed at the doorstep of some outside enemy that the race likes to create.  It is about time that whites started looking at reality.  Look inside your race to the problems that you perceive to come from outside.  That is your hope.  Learn how to stop creating enemies where they do not exist.  The very thing that can save you is the thing you are running from.  Think people for once in your lives!!!!!</p>

			<p>What i find hypocritical is the fact that it is deemed racist for people in western countries to wish to preseve their civilization and the culture and character of their countries; whereas it would be ok for  example, for an indian guy to express dismay at the prospect of indians becoming a minority in india. And the eventual extinction of his people.</p>

Why did John McCain make his final argument against Obama&hellip; coal?<br>
That&rsquo;s his closing argument? William Ayers, Rev. Wright, spreading the wealth, Born Alive, meeting dictators without preconditions, etc. all have to take a back seat so that McCain can go to Colorado and New Mexico to talk about coal? Does this more or less explain why he&rsquo;s going to get his clock cleaned Tuesday?</p>

			<p>The lessons learned during the french revolution is that those in power never let the populace know who they are.I believe that a non white,non christian person or persons  have taken over most governments in the world. They only had to pay the few- to control a country. The person or persons did&rsquo;nt have to raise a army,to inact plans for the distruction of the white race, also I find it offensive to be refered to as a non hispanic white. NON being not(maybe not human) propaganda is the first thing that comes into play when you want to de-humanize a race to kill them, just as hitler did to the Jews. Many Jews left Germany,but many stayed thinking that the inhumane actions whould not rest upon their heads.We as a people have been silenced by the second arm of this plan -the media. You control the media and you control the minds of the country. It is coming. We need leaders, have they all been bought -I don&rsquo;t think so, but where are they?   </p>
