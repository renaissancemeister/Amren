						<p>When a doctor doesn&rsquo;t look an Asian-American patient in the eye, that might be seen as a sign of respect. But making eye contact is encouraged with black patients, according to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, which has published a guidebook for culturally competent care.</p>
<p>As the country&rsquo;s ethnic profile diversifies, some states are trying to assure that health care providers are trained in &#8220;cultural competency.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dr. Elizabeth Szalay, an associate professor of pediatric orthopedics and pediatrics at the University of New Mexico&rsquo;s Carrie Tingley Hospital, said that it&rsquo;s important for doctors to understand how patients may be different, but patients also need to be open about themselves, by asking questions and revealing their beliefs, concerns or fears.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cynthia Lin, 55, of Taiwan, says she never has experienced a cultural barrier between herself and doctors, which she attributed to her open attitude.</p>
<p>She felt the need to tell a pediatrician once about something that&rsquo;s common among Asian babies &mdash; that they are born with a sort of bruised look near the buttocks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some doctors may think, &lsquo;Oh my goodness, what happened to the baby&rsquo;s butt?&rsquo;&#8221; said Lin, who lives in Albuquerque. &#8220;(But) the doctor understood that&rsquo;s just how Asians are. If the physician already knows about it, if they are aware that certain races have certain characteristics, then they don&rsquo;t have any doubts.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>New Jersey&rsquo;s law is similar to New Mexico&rsquo;s, requiring that the state&rsquo;s medical schools provide instruction to their students as a condition of receiving a degree. But the schools also must provide cultural competency training to licensed physicians who did not receive the training while they were in school &mdash; something Flores said the New Mexico Legislature might tackle down the road.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>California had a voluntary program in place since 2003 but later made it mandatory for the state&rsquo;s 400 continuing medical education providers.</p>
<p>Under the law, every CME course has to have an element of cultural and linguistic competency, which are accredited by the Institute for Medical Quality.</p>

			<p>Isn&rsquo;t this racism to begin with? It&rsquo;s assuming that all Asian Americans don&rsquo;t want to be looked in the eye. That&rsquo;s stereotyping Asians, and all other minorities.</p>

 <br>
Oh please!!  The Mongolian Spot is not exclusive to Asian babies.  I&rsquo;m sure pediaticians are well aware of it  &mdash;  unless, of course, they were AA placements in medical school.</p>

			<p>If they really want to compile a guidebook on different racial traits, they should have contacted us at AmRen. That&rsquo;s the sort of thing we keep up with.</p>

			<p>I suppose it is okay in the short run that physicians understand the cultural patterns of the many different ethnic and cultural groups they will treat, but it should not be a condition of receiving a degree. It should remain voluntary. It should be understood that the doctor is doing the immigrant patient a favor. Cultural understanding is a two-way street, and in the long run it should be the responsibility of the immigrant to take &#8220;cultural competency&#8221; lessons, not the physician. Americans should not have to play the role of being doormat-like hosts. The idea of &#8220;linguistic competency&#8221; is beyond absurd. It&rsquo;s the responsibility of the immigrant to learn English. </p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s part of the curriculum in many medical schools nowadays. It&rsquo;s not a bad idea in principle, but it&rsquo;s very much a white-guilt-a-thon in practice. Medical school professors and administrators are very liberal where I attend.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve been practicing medicine for 22 years - my board certification is in family medicine. This included 5 years in the southwest with the public health service and ER work over the years - often in the inner city.</p>
<p>It is important to understand the cultural differences to get a better handle on treating and especially educating patients. As for language - well, I didn&rsquo;t go to med school to study Spanish but you do what you can. I don&rsquo;t believe this type of education can be taught well - much less mandated through CME. It&rsquo;s very frustrating to treat non-English speakers when they had every opportunity to learn the language. Tip- many Hispanics claim not to speak English but they can so be careful what you say in the exam room. </p>
<p>Anyway, most facilities use telephone language lines now so I&rsquo;m not going to study Japanese on the off chance I see a patient from Tokyo.</p>
<p>Many of the cultural issues can be learned over time through experience. For example, Hispanics often use odd home remedies or have certain beliefs when it comes to health care that I really should know about to avoid problems.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it all comes down to basic intelligence, some common sense, and a willingness for the patient to be somewhat pro-active and responsible. Unfortunately, as a group, African-Americans are frequently the most difficult to treat because they seem (I&rsquo;m generalizing) simply too dumb to figure out what to do to stay out of trouble. </p>
<p>If you want to become a closet believer in genetic inferiority - go to medical school. In many training programs blacks seem to be a continuous source of pathology to be studied by docs in training. I taught at a med school for a while - the waste of money and resources used to provide &#8220;free&#8221; care to &#8220;the community&#8221; would make you sick.</p>
<p>Ultimately, you learn to treat African-Americans like not-so-bright children. I say this not so much in a negative way but as a statement of fact. I honestly don&rsquo;t think these people can get it together as a group and function on their own. I&rsquo;m afraid to think what government-run health care would turn into. It would become like the public school system - billions of dollars wasted on the lower tiers of society with no real improvement in sight.</p>

<p>LOL! You&rsquo;re a poster child for why &#8216;cultural competency&rsquo; training is necessary. Of course, training, taught by those who hate whites and not by those who hate people of color. I remember a few years ago we had a white studies professor stumble onto this site and remark that this site is nothing more than proof white-privilege diversity training is necessary.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re what they&rsquo;ve been warning about. It really exists. We are the possibility they constantly guard against. </p>
<p>The difference between AmRen though and those who practice diversity is that AmRens agenda isn&rsquo;t nearly as hateful toward non-whites as is multiculturalism toward white America. And that AmRen is pretty much a silenced, underground newspaper that most people have never heard of. While the anti-white diversity agenda is bigger than Jesus as a rock star head of state, back when Jesus meant something. <br>

			<p>&#8220;As the country&rsquo;s ethnic profile diversifies, some states are trying to assure that health care providers are trained in &ldquo;cultural competency.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve said, here in a country where 44 million Americans are uninsured, why are we even taking in all of these costly 3rd world foreigners? We&rsquo;re not even providing for our own people.</p>

			<p>Ever since we have been a country, we have been sending medical, health care and other volunteers throughout the world to help in times of need. Care, Doctors without Borders, The Red Cross, and The Peace Corps are just a few that comes to mind. Cultural differences never seemed to be a problem.</p>
<p>Now that patients are coming to America, cultural difference has now become a problem. Why? Because the hate America crowd has made it a problem. I wonder how long it will be before cultural incorrectness translates into malpractice.</p>
<p>Of course if you are really sick and in pain, then it doesn&rsquo;t matter if the doctor is a green monkey, as long as they are a qualified doctor.<br>

			<p>When I heard a proposal for re-licensing in Washington State that would require mandatory &#8220;cultural sensitivity training&#8221; had been filed for legislative approval, I quit practicing.  No one is going to send me to a re-education camp at any price.  So now I live on a fixed income and no one benefits from my ability and knowledge.  The proposal hasn&rsquo;t become law yet, but it is coming down the pike.  I am waiting for the big change that someone like Obama might percipitate quicker.  Of course, I may well be too old by then.  What a world!</p>

<p>I worry that when I am eventually in that position, my non-white doctor will not care too much for me because of my race.  All these immigrant doctors are poorly trained, too often careless, and racists themselves.</p>
<p>Yes, Bobby, Today, &#8220;Mercy definately walks the plank.&#8221;</p>

<p>In addition, as long as this country has its current immigration policy and open borders, socialized medicine would break the country faster than our military has&hellip;.</p>
<p>On another side of the good doctor&rsquo;s comments; Growing up in California, I learned some Spanish early on and learned more later.  While I was in practice, I learned more Spanish and I reckon that I know enough about Mexican culture.  I have always enjoyed sampling other cultures, especially through their food, I just don&rsquo;t want to be FORCED to learn about other cultures.  Programs like that are a mark of creeping totalitarianism.  But how can anyone know the cultures for the nearly 200 language groups now present in the U.S.?</p>
<p>Further, there will only be an expansion of the problems the doctor mentions in his writing because the world&rsquo;s population, especially the uneducated, poor, third world elements is expanding without the slightest restraint.  All the West seems able to do is find another way to serve those populations in producing more lives that will produce yet more lives that will require more to service.  No one seems to have the courage to acknowledge what stares us in the face; We are heading toward a world crisis beyond any calculation because we refuse to become realistic about our weight on this planet.</p>

			<p>If I chose to move to Japan, it wouldn&rsquo;t be up to the doctors there to learn american culture, it would be up to me to learn and adapt to Japanese culture. Why is it any different here? If people from other countries come here, our culture, doctors whatever, shouldn&rsquo;t be expected to change to suit them.</p>

			<p>Time spent on cultural/language difficulties is time taken from increased medical coursework/competency.  What does one want when visiting the DR?  A social or the best diagnostics?  This is America and those who seek and come here need to get a grip about USA. They need to adapt; not US.    V</p>
