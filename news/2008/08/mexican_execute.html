						<p>Mexican national Jose Ernesto Medellin, whose death penalty conviction in the rape and murder of two teen girls sparked international controversy, was put to death in Texas on Tuesday night, prison officials said.</p>
<p>Corrections spokeswoman Michelle Lyons said Medellin died at 9:57 CT.</p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court denied the last-ditch appeal of a Mexican national on Texas&rsquo; death row late Tuesday, paving the way for him to be executed for a pair of brutal slayings, state corrections officials said.</p>
<p>Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokeswoman Michelle Lyons said about 9:15 p.m. that the court had turned down the appeal of Jose Ernesto Medellin. </p>
<p>Medellin&rsquo;s capital appeal was an unusual one that pitted President Bush against his home state in a dispute over federal authority, local sovereignty and foreign treaties.</p>
<p>At issue is an international court&rsquo;s ruling that Medellin and about 50 other Mexicans have been illegally denied access to their home country&rsquo;s consul. Allowing travelers such access when they are arrested abroad is common practice.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The case centers on whether the state has to give in to a demand by the president that the prisoner be allowed new hearings and sentencing. Bush made that demand reluctantly after an international court concluded Medellin and 50 other Mexicans on American death rows were improperly denied access to their consulate upon arrest, a violation of a treaty signed by the United States decades ago.</p>
<p>Medellin&rsquo;s execution will be the first of what promises to be a busy month at the state&rsquo;s death chamber in Huntsville. Five other men are scheduled to die by lethal injection in the next four weeks, including one on Thursday.</p>
<p>Medellin was 18 when he participated in the June 1993 gang rape and murder of two Harris County girls, Jennifer Ertman, 14, and Elizabeth Pena, 16. He was convicted of the crimes and sentenced to death.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The International Court of Justice ruled in 2004 that the United States had violated the rights of the prisoners, in part because officials and prosecutors failed to notify their home country, from which the men could have received legal and other assistance. Those judges ordered the United States to provide &ldquo;review and reconsideration&rdquo; of the convictions and sentences of the Mexican prisoners.</p>
<p>The world court again last month ordered the United States to do everything within its authority to stop Medellin&rsquo;s execution until his case could be further reviewed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for a 6-3 majority that the international court&rsquo;s judgments cannot be forced upon individual states. The president also cannot &ldquo;establish binding rules of decision that pre-empt contrary state law,&rdquo; he said, and the treaty itself does not specifically require states to remedy any treaty violations.</p>
<p>The chief justice added that the international court &ldquo;is not domestic law,&rdquo; thereby restricting the president&rsquo;s power over states. &ldquo;The executive&rsquo;s narrow and strictly limited authority to settle international claims disputes pursuant to an executive agreement cannot stretch so far as to support the current presidential memorandum&rdquo; that would force Texas to conduct a new state trial, he wrote.</p>

			<p>How many millions of Dollars did it take to prosecute, house, and eventually punish this degrading piece of waste?  Note that your taxes paid for all of this.  Do you enjoy giving 50% of your income to the government each year, for your entire life (this includes all fees and taxes, including phone, cable, gas, property, utility, social security, unemployment insurance, Medicare, etc.). Your children have less because you are paying for the Reconquesta. </p>
<p>In the future, expect to pay much, much more of your hard-earned money toward similar &#8220;social costs&#8221; as our nation becomes populated by low-skilled, uneducatable Third Worlders.</p>

			<p>This clown has lived in this country since he was three years old when his parents illegally entered the country. Then when he gets his butt in a jam he whines that he&rsquo;s a Mexican citizen deserving of some kind of international protection. Nope, since he has chosen to live here illegally he is now subject US laws and jurisdiction like the other illegal invaders who have chosen to break our laws.</p>

			<p>Thank you, Chief Justice Roberts. Again. </p>
<p>Glad that at least one person in government still understands the job description. And that they are ALL employees of We The People. </p>
<p>From AmRen, 8/4. &ldquo;The law is clear: Texas is bound not by the World Court, but by the U.S. Supreme Court, which reviewed this matter and determined that this convicted murderer&rsquo;s execution shall proceed,&rdquo; said Jerry Strickland, a spokesman for the Texas Attorney General&rsquo;s Office.</p>
<p>Still not quite right. It&rsquo;s not bound by the Supreme Court, nor the Vienna convention or the world court, Texas is bound by Texans first, government second.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And thank you, Texas!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been listening to Mexifornia radio today and listened to this racist Mexican(dash)American who was moaning about the execution of the Mexican national complaining about him not having access to his home country&rsquo;s consul services.  Well, this guy always likes to portray Mexican and Central American nationals as victims of racism and advocates their entry into the USA without any restrictions.  For those of you who can understand Spanish I recommend you listen to this ahole on the radio to understand who our enemy is.  It&rsquo;s on KIQI in northern California and Seattle and his name is Marcos Gutierrez.  Here&rsquo;s his website:</p>

			<p>Heard on the news a few days ago that this guy was brought to the States when he was 3 years old. Looks like his parents were illegals. The point is, though, that he was raised here, spoke English, and the issue of his contacting the Mexican government never came up until some years after his arrest. I guess some do-gooders got to him. </p>
<p>As for as his execution - goodbye and good riddance! </p>

			<p>Let&rsquo;s see now. Jorge Boosh wants to pardon an illegal Mexican National that brutally raped, killed and then, post-mortem, stomped on the necks of his two teenage <b>American</b> female victims yet, on live television several years ago, mimics the murderess, yet sincerely born-again-Christian American, Karla Faye Tucker, while she pleads for mercy and a pardon for the crime-of-passion murder of her husband while she was on drugs.</p>
<p>Nothing could show his true colors more than this. Just like his father, he&rsquo;s a proud member of and advocate for the New World Order&hellip;and, apparently, the World Court. He could care less about this country or the people in it&hellip;ummm, unless they are illegal Mexican Nationals.</p>
<p>Too bad for Karla Faye Tucker that she was just a plain old American woman because if she were an illegal Mexican National, she&rsquo;d be alive watching cable tv right now in her cell.</p>
<p>Impeach him already.</p>

<p>I Agree Ben. It is incredible how many Mexican malcontents living in this nation are broadcasting on the radio. It&rsquo;s a fifth column that they make up, period. It&rsquo;s amazing what has been done to the younger generation, college kids often, that agree with much of the open borders crowd, simply because they do not understand the implications, so brainwashed have they become by their liberal professors. It&rsquo;s always the same.</p>
<p>They are taught about American Imperialsim in the past, all the bad things European Americans have done, and continue to do. Yet, they don&rsquo;t understand that their very priviledges and way of life are a result of some of those ancestors of theirs. There is no objectivity on the subject, because the Europeans that created the modern western world are presumed guilty at the outset by liberals, of any reasoned debate on the subject of Imperialism.</p>

Our DA wont even seek the death penalty for him.Meanwhile, our pinko mayor Newsom continues to make excuses for the sanctuary policy in this city.The fines for parking tickets are being raised some more to pay to lodge illegal alien crack peddlers too.</p>

			<p>Now, Governor Perry, how about taking Austin off the &#8220;Sanctuary City&#8221; list? Then, we&rsquo;ll know you&rsquo;re serious. We saw your ads about closing the border when you ran for office, but immediately after you won, all bets were off. Think Bologna family, Shaw family and all the families who&rsquo;ve lost loved ones because the sanctuary cities protected murderous illegal aliens. Those, like Gavin Newson, who think illegals will be more &#8220;comfortable&#8221; with reporting crimes if they know they are protected are nuts. Illegals aren&rsquo;t going to approach ANY authorities. Meanwhile, that baseless idea seems to be more important than the life of law-abiding Americans. The blood of the victims are on you head, Mayor Newsom and Mayor Villaigrosa. Think carefully, Governor Perry - I&rsquo;d like to feel safe and your city full of illegal criminals are only 26 miles away from my family.</p>

			<p>Mexican illegals cause the deaths of thousands of Americans every year.  I charge the congress with being accessories before the fact in these preventable deaths.</p>
<p>&#8220;While King reports 12 Americans are murdered daily by illegal aliens, he says 13 are killed by drunk illegal alien drivers – for another annual death toll of 4,745.&#8221;</p>

<p>I believe you are referring to THIS, June.  Take a look.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.texasborderwatch.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.texasborderwatch.com/</a></p>
<p>Gov. Perry ran on a &#8220;get tough on border security&#8221; platform.  He opened this website while he was campaigning so as to give the appearance that he was serious about the issue.  Of course, as soon as his re-election was confirmed, the Texas Border Watch Test Site was &#8220;closed while the state proceeds with a formal request for proposals to implement a permanent Texas Border Watch web site&#8221;.  This was 2006!  Looks like they have forgotten about those proposals since then.  Most forgot about this website, but a few like myself saved it into their favorites, realizing what the purpose was all along. To merely help Gov. Rick Perry in getting re-elected at a time when illegal immigration was a hot topic in the state.</p>

			<p>The details of this case are even more horrendous than the media will say. </p>
<p>These details came from the confessions and were revealed by a friend of the girl&rsquo;s families.  </p>
<p>1.  He was bragging about having &#8220;virgin blood&#8221; on his underwear after the murder.<br>
2.  There were at least two gang members on both girls at all times, raping vaginally, anally, and orally.<br>
3.  They knocked out the girls front teeth to enjoy the experience more.<br>
4.  After they were done, they tied the belts around the girls necks and two gang members pulled on each end for maximum force.<br>
5.  Finally, they stomped on their bodies to make sure they were dead.</p>
<p>If this is not a &#8220;hate crime&#8221; then what is?  This is a Mexican gang who hates &#8220;Gringos.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jorge Bush has these young girl&rsquo;s blood on his hands!  If Jorge  had his way, this filthy, disgusting, sub-human degenerates would have amnesty, instead of a one-way trip to hell!</p>
<p>I rejoiced when I heard Medellin was finally executed</p>

			<p>It is amazing what rights they want when it is convenient.  So he was here at 3 years old? He knows the right from wrong, period.  That was a disgusting crime.  I firmly believe in capital punishment when there is no doubt of being guilty.  Anyone who murders another human being with malice (not self defense, or policing activities) is sick or deranged and doesn&rsquo;t deserve to live anyway.  Sorry to be so &#8220;heartless&#8221;, but we allow too many people that are weird to exist.  We have become too &#8220;soft&#8221; when dealing with them.</p>
<p>Why are the liberals so anti-execution? Isn&rsquo;t abortion destroying human life?  They are for Pro Choice.  And there are more of those every year than executions.  And those are innocent humans, not given a choice.   Birth control is available, hopefully these idiots know enough to read instructions.    </p>

			<p>We lucked out in one respect in this case; if Medellin had been able to cross the border to Mexico before being caught, the Mexican government would have refused to extradite unless and until Texas prosecutors promised not to seek the death penalty.</p>
<p>This sort of behavior is unfortunately common among Mexican gangs.  In Denver some years ago, a group gang-raped and tortured a white girl named Brandy to death.  In Albequerque, the usual deal leading up to these gang-rapes is that a young girl or girls are invited to a party.  When they arrive, they discover they ARE the party.<br>

			<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t expect Shrubya to stand trial in the US, as he probably can pardon himself before he leaves office.  That will not get him off the hook completely.  War crimes are an international offense, and the laws of several European countries allow literally anyone to file a formal complaint.  Rumsfeld has already been indicted for war crimes in Germany.  This means if he travels outside the US for any reason, Interpol will arrest him and send him to Germany to stand trial.  I would dearly love Shrubya to receive the same treatment.</p>
<p>It would be best if we could lock him up ourselves, but farming the job out doesn&rsquo;t make much of a difference in the long run.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Why are the liberals so anti-execution?&#8221;</p>
<p>They are environmental determinists, denying the existence of volition. (They think free-will would violate certain laws of physics.) Crime is not caused by free-will choices.</p>
<p>Perhaps they hate the idea of justice itself.</p>
<p>Perhaps they sense their own guilt, and can see the day of the rope, coming fairly soon&hellip;</p>
