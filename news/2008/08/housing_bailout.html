<h1>Housing &lsquo;Bailout&rsquo; Contains Millions in Earmarks for Leftist Groups</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jim Brown, OneNewsNow, August 11, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>There&rsquo;s more to the housing bailout measure than meets the eye, says a Minnesota lawmaker. She contends that members of Congress need to be called back to Washington to reverse the measure that, among other things, sends millions of taxpayer dollars to a radical illegal immigration advocacy group.</p>
<p>The housing package signed into law by President Bush extends an unlimited line of credit to troubled mortgage giants Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and rescues homeowners near or in foreclosure. The measure also increases the federal debt limit by another $800 billion &mdash; and sends millions of dollars in aid to La Raza and the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, or ACORN.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bachmann advises Congress to get back to Washington, stop the funding stream for ACORN and La Raza, and also get American taxpayers off the hook for bailing out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.<br>

			<p>With each passing day I can see more clearly that our government is the true enemy.  Things just can&rsquo;t go on like they are now.  The current government must be abolished and replaced with people that actually represent the majority of us and share our views.  Is it actually their intention to turn the United States into a third world country?  If so, then why?  </p>

			<p>As an aside:</p>
<p>http://stlcofcc.wordpress.com/2008/08/12/a-matter-of-simple-algebra/</p>
<p>Along with race, the subprime &#8220;crisis&#8221; can be explained with simple algebra.</p>
<p>That mostly unnecessary Federal bailouts are fungible contributions to the left-wing does not surprise me.  Usually, when the Feds dump a bunch of money on big cities for &#8220;gang mitigation,&#8221; a lot of it winds up in NAACP/ACORN etc. coffers.</p>

			<p>All done to assure that the illegal aliens who have entered this nation, stay in this nation. There are so many traitors in this nation that do not have the best interests of the American citizenry at heart and in fact despise the citizenry. The reason I believe this is that these &#8220;leaders&#8221;, whether they are from churches, the administration, private groups, you name it, know that the common denominator that every poor nation has is overpopulation. All the effects of overpopulation on humans have been studied, are well known, and yet we have agents of chaos, vile people in this nation who continue to push for unbelievable levels of immigration.</p>

			<p>Just another redistribution of wealth scheme.  Crack addict minorities buy houses on credit that they are not even close to being rich enough to afford.  They default on the loan.  The US government bails them out.  Result?  Your taxes pay for their houses.</p>

			<p>How outrageous is this???????   Individual congressmen use taxpayer money to support their own political causes.  Barney Frank put an earmark in the housing bailout bill giving La Raza $10 million a year on an ongoing basis.  An I guess something similar to ACORN.  What is wrong with this system that allows these jerks in congress to use taxpayer money as their own to do with what they want and in any amount???????????/////////<br>
And in Barney Frank&rsquo;s case, it is not  for a bridge or a road or something like that, IT&rsquo;s for his own political cause.<br>
This really STINKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>

These are the people who contributed to the problem by proclaiming home ownership a human right and demanding that &#8216;undocumented Americans&rsquo; be granted the opportunity to live the American dream.</p>

			<p>The entire mortgage/bailout was orchestrated to appear to help those who will not help themselves but who will always want a free ride handout!  Many fools and commies drive this game everyday upon USA.   We need strong leaders to protect working people being taxed to death to pay off extortion lobbies.  Elites, corps, and poverty/religion business outnumber those who are being fleeced.  Tax the rich until there are no more!  The only remaining groups will be NGOs,NonProfits,Corps,Churches, Charities,and Governments.  Where will they get the money??<br>
Sure hope all those foundations are ready to pay.     V</p>

			<p>This wanton destruction of the national tax base is going to end sooner than some think. WWII Germany increasingly drafted the taxpayers into various forces until there was no one financially supporting the war, we know where that ended. It will end the same way in the U.S. Even as the Russian and Allied forces approached Berlin, those companies that had been building war materials, would not build any unless they were paid. Even as the bombs rained down on them, no war material was handed over until payment was made. No, when the taxpaying, war supporting people have finally had enough the U.S. will finally be ready for it&rsquo;s own social upheaval and it will not be pretty. I am ready for it. Weapons are your friends.</p>

			<p>A prime example of an out of control government, kicking sand in the faces of working taxpayers all across America, there is no other organization in America as corrupt as ACORN, it is a den of theives, cheating lying and stealing American taxpayers money. I applaud Bachman, but she&rsquo;s a lone voice among a group and will not be heard, they will remember her, and she will not be reelected.</p>

			<p>As I always say, our Government is our Number One Public Enemy!</p>
<p>Our so-called &#8220;political representatives&#8221; have been lying to us and selling us out for over 40 years; and now, thanks to the Internet, Conservative Talk Shows, and what we are witnessing with our own eyes all around us, the chickens are finally coming home to roost.</p>
<p>Americans are finally starting to wake up and see the light.  We must stand up for our rights and what is in our best interest before we quickly slide down to an over-populated Third World status.  We must do everything in our power to throw out all of the traitors in office (from the bottom up) and hire American patriots to represent our needs.  We must STOP the ongoing process of the SPP, the NAFTA Super Highway, and the North American Union!</p>
<p>We are truly on the edge&hellip;  We either fight for America and our quality of life as we know it or lose it.</p>

			<p>This is a great propaganda issue for our side, we need new, younger political reformers who can run and win offices and powers against the use of our tax $s to fund extremist, racist organizations like LaRaza - THE RACE.</p>
<p>In the late 1960s, the Federal Government used Federal tax $s to fund the Chicago Black Street gang The Blackstone Rangers, now morphed into the equally brutal, racist Black Gangster Disciples, El Rukuns. Thomas Wolfe ripped this insanity in his great book Radical Chic, Mau Mauing the Flack Catchers.</p>

			<p>Jackers,</p>
<p><i>We either fight for America and our quality of life as we know it or lose it</i></p>
<p>How and whom do we fight?  When the Japs attacked Pearl Harbor, the enemy was obvious and external.  Even in the Revolutionary War, we could tell who most of the enemy was.</p>
<p>What do we do today?  It is as though we have been injected by a virus.  It is easier to fight a bear than a virus.  Our enemies seem to know this.  By making everyone in the world an &#8220;American&#8221; (see the story on Saipan, for an example), whom do we real Americans fight?  How do we even get the support of our fellow real Americans, many of whom accept the idea of ours being a &#8220;nation of immigrants&#8221;?</p>
<p>The enemies of this country have laid a fine trap this time.</p>
<p>I love my country and have served it, but am at a loss of what to do now.  I&rsquo;ll bet our WWII vets never dreamed of this outcome, after spilling their blood for our future.</p>

You have an excellent point. This phenomenon is unprecedented.  It has been a conquest of stealth, by infiltration and subversion and propaganda.  The battle lines are unclear. Friend and foe are intermingled.  The enemy is among us.  The enemy claims to represent us. Sometimes the enemy is even leading us.</p>

<p>Paying people that want to destroy you and your country is like giving a bully money</p>

			<p>I couldn&rsquo;t afford a good home without taking out an irresponsible loan or living in a bad neighborhood, so I chose to rent. </p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m being asked to bail out those who made the mistakes that I didn&rsquo;t. Fantastic. </p>

			<p>     La Raza means the race.   Can you imagine a white newspaper called the race?  There would be a public outcry by the liberals!<br>
Liberals are two faced hypocrites.<br>
     These Hispanics are hardcore anti-white racists.  Inform others, get sample translations of La Raza publications and vote, vote, vote every single election!</p>
