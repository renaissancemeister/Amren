<p>In a report scheduled for release Wednesday, the MRC [Media Research Center] states: &#8220;Rev. Wright&rsquo;s noxious recorded sermons suggesting that America deserved 9/11 and that the federal government created AIDS as a tool of black genocide were widely viewed on YouTube and discussed on talk radio and cable TV. But what about the network news shows, the programs most watched by the least politically involved viewers?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>&#8220;A Media Research Center study of ABC, CBS, and NBC news broadcasts from the formal announcement of the Obama campaign on February 10, 2007 through July 15 reveals that a viewer watching only broadcast TV news would have received a much more limited (and even censored) version of Wright&rsquo;s sermons.&#8221;</p>
<p>Among the key findings of the study:</p>
<p>* A Fox News Channel report on March 1, 2007, delved into the &#8220;black value system&#8221; of Rev. Wright&rsquo;s Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago. But the name of Rev. Wright did not surface on the Big Three networks until a year later, on CBS on Feb. 28, 2008.</p>
<p>* The first story with excerpts from a Wright sermon did not air until two weeks later, on ABC on March 13. By that time, 42 states had already voted in the primaries.</p>
<p>* Snippets of Wright&rsquo;s sermons drew only 72 seconds of evening news coverage in all of March, an average of 24 seconds per network.</p>
<p>* None of the Big Three aired any of Wright&rsquo;s 2003 sermon accusing the federal government of hiding the truth about their &#8220;inventing the HIV virus as a means of genocide against people of color,&#8221; and all three &#8220;mostly ignored&#8221; his remarks calling the 9/11 attacks &#8220;America&rsquo;s chickens coming home to roost.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p># Wright&rsquo;s April 28 comments at the National Press Club reiterating his claims about an AIDS conspiracy and America deserving 9/11 went virtually unreported, with the AIDS comments receiving no air time and the 9/11 charge just 23 seconds. {snip}</p>

															<h2>Editing Reverend Wright&rsquo;s Wrongs: How the Networks Censored and Manipulated Jeremiah Wright Soundbites and Glorified Barack Obama&rsquo;s Race Speech</h2>
											<p>
							<i>Media Research Center, August 13, 2008</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</p>
<p>Barack Obama&rsquo;s greatest struggle in the drawn-out Democratic primary campaign was his relationship with his long-time minister Rev. Jeremiah Wright and the Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago. Rev. Wright&rsquo;s noxious recorded sermons suggesting that America deserved 9/11 and that the federal government created AIDS as a tool of black genocide were widely viewed on YouTube and discussed on talk radio and cable TV. But what about the network news shows, the programs most watched by the least politically involved viewers? TV pundits suggested the virulent video clips unfairly caricatured the minister (and by association, Obama himself.) PBS star Bill Moyers lamented that Wright was &#8220;assassinated by soundbites.&#8221;</p>
<p>Did the nation&rsquo;s broadcast networks really play Wright&rsquo;s remarks to excess? A Media Research Center study of ABC, CBS, and NBC news broadcasts from the formal announcement of the Obama campaign on February 10, 2007 through July 15 reveals that a viewer watching only broadcast TV news would have received a much more limited (and even censored) version of Wright&rsquo;s sermons. Key findings:</p>
<p>The broadcast networks took an entire year to locate Reverend Wright. Despite a feisty interview on Fox News Channel&rsquo;s Hannity &amp; Colmes back on March 1, 2007 about Obama&rsquo;s church&rsquo;s controversial commitment to a &#8220;black value system,&#8221; the name of Jeremiah Wright didn&rsquo;t surface on the Big Three networks until CBS first broached it on February 28, 2008. The first story with Wright sermon soundbites aired two weeks later, on ABC on March 13. By then, 42 states and the District of Columbia had already voted.</p>
<p>The broadcast network evening news shows gave virtually no coverage to Wright soundbites in March. Snippets of Wright&rsquo;s sermons drew only 72 seconds of evening news coverage in all of March, or an average of 24 seconds per network, less than one commercial.</p>
<p>The Big Three morning shows gave four times as much time to Wright soundbites as the evening shows in March. The morning shows carried almost five minutes of Wright clips (297 seconds), with ABC offering the most at 128 seconds. The other two networks each ran less than 90 seconds.</p>
<p>The networks completely ignored soundbites of Wright&rsquo;s conspiracy theory about the U.S. government inventing AIDS to kill blacks, and mostly ignored his comments about the September 11 terrorist attacks being &#8220;America&rsquo;s chickens coming home to roost.&#8221; None of the network morning or evening shows found one opportunity to air Wright&rsquo;s 2003 sermon accusing the federal government of hiding the truth about their &#8220;inventing the HIV virus as a means of genocide against people of color.&#8221; His attack on America&rsquo;s alleged record of terrorism and violence was ignored by all three evening shows, as well as by CBS&rsquo;s The Early Show.</p>
<p>The broadcast networks gave clips of Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;race speech&#8221; on March 18 more than twice as much air time in a few hours than they gave all of the Wright bites aired in the month of March. The evening news shows on March 18 carried almost six minutes (348 seconds) of highlights from the Obama speech, or roughly five times more than all the Wright bites in March. The morning shows carried roughly nine and a half minutes (572 seconds) of sound from the speech. The three morning shows gave almost twice as much time to the Obama speech clips as they devoted to Wright soundbites in March. Combined, Obama&rsquo;s one speech drew about 15 minutes of clips, while Wright&rsquo;s years of sermons drew about six minutes.</p>
<p>Broadcast network interview segments on the Wright remarks and Obama&rsquo;s race speech in March were dominated by liberal guests. When the networks allowed Republican or conservative guests, they stayed neutral or praised Obama&rsquo;s remarks. Overall, the network pundit count was 16 to 5. CBS especially loaded its reaction panels with nine liberals and just one right-leaning pundit, pollster Frank Luntz, who contained his remarks to grading Obama&rsquo;s stagecraft. NBC allowed six liberals and three conservatives. ABC aired one liberal and one conservative.</p>
<p>Wright&rsquo;s National Press Club vitriol repeating his opinions about an AIDS conspiracy and America deserving 9/11 went virtually unreported. The broadcast network morning and evening shows aired only two and a half minutes (155 seconds) of soundbites from Wright&rsquo;s April 28 performance at the National Press Club, but there were no soundbites about AIDS and only 23 seconds about America deserving a terrorist attack. By contrast, these same Big Three shows aired almost six minutes (358 seconds) of clips of Wright&rsquo;s softball interview with Bill Moyers on PBS, where he accused conservatives of smearing him as a hater.</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s rapid-fire political atmosphere of cable news, talk radio, and the Internet, media analysts can easily make the mistake of believing that the leading network news outlets were tough on a candidate because of the general perception of how the entire media &mdash; Old Media and New Media &mdash; brought a controversy to the public&rsquo;s attention. But voters who sampled only a light menu of news from Big Three network TV could easily have missed the depths of Reverend Wright&rsquo;s outrageous remarks. No one could find in these stories a scouring scrutiny of Obama&rsquo;s decades of membership in his controversial church.<br>

			<p>  The above article explains why I NEVER watch television news. I get my news from several sources on the internet. AmRen and Drudge Report being my favorite and most trusted news sources. Everything you see and hear on T.V. is filtered and changed around to fit the particular news outlet. They are all liars. </p>

			<p>Supposedly, Rev. Wright is going to come out with a book in October.  The CW is that he&rsquo;s mad at Obama for throwing him under the bus, so he&rsquo;s going to resurface deliberately in October just at about the time when undecided voters will make up their minds.</p>

			<p>Black racist comments and behavior is tolerated. That is the reality. Hopefully, enough people will remember that Obama just sat in those pews for years while Wright ranted on against Whites and America.  The penalty for Obama&rsquo; playing ball with Wright will be Obama&rsquo;s defeat.  Who knows however how many whites care anymore if they are insulted and smeared with racist lies? I guess we will find out on election day. One thing, however. Obama is not an idiot. He knew exactly what was going on in that church, and what his good friend and mentor said about white people.  The same for the well-educated Ms. Obama, as well.</p>

			<p>I firmly hold all mainstream media outlets fully responsible for the civil unrest that is awaiting us in the years to come.  Hopefully, when the minority rioters start pulling whites out of their cars, homes, and offices, the victims will solely be employees of these outlets.  I will be standing by cheering them on.</p>

			<p>I haven&rsquo;t the slightest doubt that the media covered up the &#8220;Reverend&#8221; Wrights extremism. I would think that almost 90 percent of Americans know by now that we have a media that is agenda driven and not to find out inconvenient truths they disagree with. Afterall, Wrights&rsquo;racism against whites,etc. had to go much deeper and include other issues as well.</p>

			<p>Let&rsquo;s go a bit further in this matter, and point out that it isn&rsquo;t just the lack of any real reporting on the Wright debacle, the media hasn&rsquo;t reported anything about anti-white racism and anti-government hatred in general by blacks, which are really one in the same, nor have the politicians and conservative pundits done so either.</p>
<p>Black on white hateful rhetoric and racism is rife throughout the country.  It&rsquo;s everywhere, yet judging by the silence when it occurs it&rsquo;s as if it doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an elephant sitting right next to every media type everywhere, yet they carefully pretend they don&rsquo;t see it or it doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>The only organizations that bring the subject up for discussion are Amren, the CofCC, EAIU, and groups further to the right.</p>
<p>Every white in America owes it to himself and his family to get on this board and at least enter into a discussion and become better informed of how important the subject of race is to his family, friends, and acquaintenances.</p>

			<p>In regards to the subheading of this article - I believe Fox News Channel has been giving Obama the protective, kid-glove treatment right along! I have noticed this again and again, before, during and after the Rev. Wright fiasco. Of course compared to the sycophancy of the network stations and CNN&rsquo;s flat-out afrocentrism anymore, I suppose it isn&rsquo;t as obvious to some&hellip;but make no mistake, the supposedly &#8220;conservative&#8221; FNC seems at least somewhat smitten with(or afraid of) the Mulatto Messiah as well! </p>

			<p>It would be interesting to compare the number of times a hate-filled sound bite from one of Wright&rsquo;s sermons was played on TV news as compared to, say, the number of airings of the Rodney King beating. After all, that only led to the L.A. riots and billions of dollars worth of damages. Plus, the media avoided replaying Wright&rsquo;s more inflammatory sound bites, such as him claiming that the U.S. invented AIDS to kill off blacks just as it avoided replaying Michael Pfleger&rsquo;s more inflammatory statement (than the ones he made about Hillary) that the U.S. has been &#8220;raping&#8221; black people throughout it&rsquo;s history and that you would no more expect blacks to forgive America than you would expect a rape victim to forgive her attacker. Of course, you would also expect the rape victim to flee at the first opportunity but I don&rsquo;t see many blacks rushing to leave this country, so who&rsquo;s the one being raped?</p>

			<p>Yes, Wright speaks of oppression and &#8220;outrageous injustices&#8221; against black men, as if they&rsquo;re victims rather than arrogant perpetrators with bad attitudes.  There&rsquo;s no other group in the entire country of any race who is favored more than these miscreants yet they continue to commit crimes at record rates, and they do so NOT because of a lack of opportunity or racism or oppression or anything else their leaders whine about.  They turn to crime because it pays better and is easier than working, and, as in the Wright case, we don&rsquo;t hear much if anything from the MSM. </p>
<p>The more social benefits and opportunities blacks acquire, the worse they get.  So many cities are no go zones for non-blacks in this country it makes France look like Switzerland by comparison, and many cities are becoming war zones that could well erupt into warfare.</p>
<p>Case in point:  Helena, Arkansas.   The mayor ordered a round-the-clock curfew and heavy police patrol in a 10 block section of town.  Police are armed with M-16&rsquo;s and shotguns and are patrolling the area.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wxvt.com/Global/story.asp?S=8818645&amp;nav=menu1344_2" rel="nofollow">http://www.wxvt.com/Global/story.asp?S=8818645&nav;=menu1344_2</a></p>
<p>And New Orleans will have at least 200 National Guardsmen reinforcing the police through 2008, because of out-of-control crime.</p>
<p>Just recently Miami police announced they were issuing M-16 assault rifles to the police there to match the firepower of the criminals and gangs.  Los Angeles and other cities did that quite some time ago.  The transition of our police into military units is progressing nicely.  Every part of the country that has a large population of blacks is involved in low intensity warfare.</p>
<p>How many other cities are having a HEAVY crime presence by mostly blacks but some mestizos also?  Los Angeles, Detroit, Atlanta, Houston, New York, Cincinnati?  How many others?</p>
<p>The great travesty of the entire situation is that the MSM&rsquo;s reluctance to report on the black crime problem is making it worse, just as their failure to adequately report black on white assaults and murders make the number of those crimes increase also. </p>
<p>So it just isn&rsquo;t the rabid, white-hating Jeremiah Wright the media doesn&rsquo;t report on, they stay mum about, or play down, all crime by blacks.</p>
<p>The situation will not only fail to improve, it will probably get a lot worse until it&rsquo;s totally out-of-control and we&rsquo;re living in a Brazil type society.  As long as we have blacks in this country, we&rsquo;re going to have chaos and mayhem, and playing it all down or ignoring it by authorities and the media will continue until critical mass is reached, and the situation can no longer be ignored.</p>

			<p>Barack and Michelle Obama are neighbors of mine in our Hyde Park Kenwood Chicago neighborhood. Jeremiah Wright - Trinity Church, very close neighbors, understand where they are coming from.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not mainstream America, we don&rsquo;t &#8220;play in Peoria&#8221; and yeah, we have more than our share of con men, hustlers, but they are our con men and our hustlers.</p>

			<p>For many yrs. the mainstream press have went out of their way to coverup and suppress the shortcomings in the minority communities, there are all kinds of reasons for it, mostly their desire to show how P.C. they are. The absolute worse are NPR and PBS, both funded by taxpayer dollars. These are prime examples of what liberalism has become, a mental disorder.</p>

			<p>Ranger, I agree with you 100%.  Understand also, that when we do reach critical mass, not only will we not be able to ignore it, we won&rsquo;t be able to contain it as well.  Anarchy will reign supreme (which is what our little brainwashed Reds have been wanting all along), and any attempts by law enforcement to suppress the coming carnage will be futile.  For those that haven&rsquo;t done so yet, stock up on plenty of ammo, canned goods, and water.  And those that have, stock away more.<br>
Regarding this article, it comes as no surprise that the so-called conservative Fox News Channel would be amongst those suppressing any negative news of prominent blacks.  Was it not FNC that had tapes of Jesse Jackson making unkind remarks about Obama, yet tried to squash the controversy by refusing to release the audio?  O&rsquo;Reilly was adamant about keeping the tape and its specific content from public ears.  His reasoning was that he didn&rsquo;t want to &#8221;embarrass&#8221; Jesse.  Like others have pointed out, the modern day American media, including O&rsquo;Reilly, are nothing more than well paid propaganda agents, either altering, exaggerating, or suppressing news as necessary, so as to mold public opinion towards their ultimate agenda.  The immediate goal being to see the Marxist Obama get elected.</p>

			<p>What we need to do is look at our own people who perpetrate this mindlessness.Generally it is rich and upper middle class white kids who champion these sort of things(not to mention states that have only 2 or 3% black populations)They pull for the other side out of rebellion and inexperience with the third world.They are so gulliable and bored,and need something to rebel against.PBS brags about how in the 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s that they tied the civil rights movement in with white youth rebellion.If you go back and look,you will see mostly rich white kids on those &#8220;freedom rides&#8221;.Those beatniks and hippies are now in control of the media,reliving their glory days and going home to their gated communities.Poor white kids like me went to Vietnam and were more worried about black racist thugs behind me rather than the yellow soldiers in front of me.I guess when the rich fools get raped,robbed and beaten by the third worlders,they will realize the realities of life.</p>

			<p>I note that the American MSM - Mainstream Media has still suppressed the truth about Barack Obama&rsquo;s Black African father - the subject of Barack&rsquo;s best selling book Dreams From My Father. </p>
<p>Barack presents and idealized version of his father as a Black African, anti Colonial freedom fighter and presents the break-up of his bi racial parent&rsquo;s marriage as caused by RACISM on both sides. But, lately, Barack Jr has chosen not to talk much about his father, distancing himself from him, same as he distances himself from Jeremiah Wright now that it is well known that Jeremiah Wright is a White hating, Afroc Centric, Liberation Theology demagogue.</p>
<p>But, the British Press has presented the damning truth about Barack Obama Sr. and this story needs to get out as it confirms that Barack comes from standard TNB hard core Leftist, anti Western, Anti American, anti White, sexually abusive family. I note that like Barack Jr. Barack Sr went to Harvard.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the link to UK Daily Mail story - excellent:</p>

			<p>Has anyone seen the commercial ( I don&rsquo;t whom what it&rsquo;s for) featuring this big Black guy reclining in a bathtub full of bubbles with two geeky looking white guys (aren&rsquo;t they always?) at the foot of the tub  blowing bubbles in the water through two drinking straws. I didn&rsquo;t hear the dialog because I immediately freaked out. The whole idea is absolutely outrageous but can you imagine something like this being aired had races been switched? And if it had can you imagine the furor?</p>
<p>Breaking news today is that Whites will be a minority in this country sooner than originally predicted. They attribute it to immigration and a declining birth rate among Whites. </p>

<p>Do you remember the terribly insulting Washington Mutual commercials, the ones where the hip young black guy attempts to enlighten a bunch of nerdy old white bankers, sometimes herding them around while they&rsquo;re completely nude? All their ads, both print, billboard and electronic, featured that same hip black guy. Well, &#8220;WaMu&#8221; now finds itself losing business and is closing dozens of branches here in the Chicago area. The media hasn&rsquo;t made the connection, but I suspect many potential white customers quietly took their business elsewhere.</p>
<p>Of course, the hip-black-guy-shows-up-nerdy-white-guy commercials are all the rage nowadays.</p>

<p>Flossie,<br>
I saw it yesterday. It&rsquo;s an Ad for Hotels.com. I hope that everyone here will email them and let them know that we won&rsquo;t be patronizing a company who degrades Whites.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the email link.</p>

That&rsquo;s the problem Flossie i.e. White people &#8220;quietly&#8221; protesting, These cretans don&rsquo;t understand gentility. You have to hit them in the head (figuratively speaking) with a two by four in order to get their attention.</p>
<p>Have you heard the new Rap that calls for the killing of Bill O&rsquo;Reilly and Michele Malkin? <br>
The anger over the double standard of acceptable behavior via a vis Blacks and Whites is reaching critical mass. </p>
