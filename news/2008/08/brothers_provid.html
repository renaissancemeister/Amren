						<p>The last moments of a 15-year-old Topeka girl were described in gruesome detail during a court hearing Tuesday in which a witness said another young woman who unexpectedly showed up at the homicide scene could have suffered the same fate if she had discovered the body.</p>
<p>Nacole Winter, a student at Hope Street Academy, was stomped to death, a coroner testified during the preliminary hearing of Christopher Dwayne Hall, 25.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the hearing, Hall was bound over for trial on felony charges of first-degree murder and aggravated indecent liberties with a child 14 to 16 years old and certified for trial on a misdemeanor count of desecration of a corpse.</p>
<p>County coroner Erik Mitchell said Winter died of blunt force injuries. An autopsy showed she suffered a hairline skull fracture, a fractured neck, bruises on the scalp and bruises on the chest.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A fractured vertebra above the base of the neck was caused by a &#8220;very hard blow,&#8221; most likely by a kick or a stomp, Mitchell said.</p>
<p>Bruising about 3 or 4 inches wide on the teenager&rsquo;s chest wall likely was caused by a stomp, the coroner said.</p>
<p>Winter was dead when her body was burned, Mitchell said. She didn&rsquo;t have any drugs or alcohol in her system.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Michael Hall, 27, and Anthony Hall, 28, who are brothers of the defendant, said Christopher Hall recruited them several days before Dec. 14 to help dispose of the body.</p>
<p>Testing of material recovered on vaginal swabs showed Michael Hall had sex with Winter at some point before she was slain, a written stipulation signed by prosecution and defense attorneys said.</p>
<p>Michael Hall said his brother showed him Winter&rsquo;s body when it was wrapped in a tarp and lying in a trash can in a basement storage and laundry area at Fairlawn Greens Apartments, 5237 S.W. 20th Terrace, where the three men lived.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Christopher Hall said he killed her after he and Winter were smoking in his apartment, there was an altercation, and she tried to leave, Michael Hall testified.</p>
<p>Michael Hall said his brother told him he first used his hands to strangle Winter.</p>
<p>But &#8220;he noticed she wasn&rsquo;t dead, and he put a cord around neck and strangled her,&#8221; Michael Hall said.</p>
<p>Anthony Hall testified Christopher Hall told him he strangled Winter when she tried to scream.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Christopher Hall first considered disposing of Winter&rsquo;s body in a trash can at the apartment complex, but decided against that.</p>
<p>Michael Hall said the three brothers put her body in the trunk of Vines&rsquo; car [Sonya Vines, Christopher Hall&rsquo;s girlfriend], stopped at a convenience store to buy gasoline and a gas container, and drove to an open field in the 4100 block of S.E. East Edge Road in the Lake Shawnee area about 9 or 10 p.m. at night.</p>
<p>Once there, Christopher and Anthony Hall unloaded the body, gasoline was poured on the corpse, and Christopher Hall lit the fire, Michael Hall and Anthony Hall testified. {snip}</p>

			<p>What was a 15 year old White girl doing at the apartment of black men almost twice her age anyhow? You can thank the MSM, Hollywood and the record companies for this. </p>
<p>Their over-representation of blacks in advertising, TV shows and movies and their glorification of the base,lowlife ghetto lifestyle in music recordings has perverted and corrupted a generation of American White kids,as well as robbed them of their ethnic heritage, identity and pride.</p>

			<p>&#8220;In the United States in 2005, 37,460 white females were sexually assaulted or raped by a black man, while between zero and ten black females were sexually assaulted or raped by a white man. </p>
<p>What this means is that every day in the United States, over one hundred white women are raped or sexually assaulted by a black man. &#8221;  <br>
https://frontpagemag.com/Articles/Read.aspx?GUID=F3E3CD97-197F-4D31-BF36-A4CBA45FCB13 </p>
<p>This goes on every year so why is there no MSM reporting or discussion about this huge outrage. If a tenth of this many black women were raped by whites you&rsquo;d hear plenty about it. </p>
<p> American women need to know the dangers associated with black males - they do not and probably think it racist if they worry about such possibilities. We need some real racial education in this country to protect our children.</p>

			<p>You would think that one set of parents-just one-would come forward somehow, somewhere to join the cause of the White Europeans&rsquo; plight in this country and around the world, one set of parents of one of these kids or people murdered by Blacks.  One set of parents to get on AmRen or one of the other websites to say what they think and to help to champion this cause.  If Whites who&rsquo;ve lost loved ones like this are so damn afraid of appearing racist, who the hell can assist us.  I can only hope that one of these parents can view a post like mine and come forward - just one.  Please.  I know you&rsquo;re out there, somewhere, someone with guts.</p>

			<p>the prosecutor and defense attorney stipulated the two had sex so it appears to have been voluntary. The girl is quite chubby and her mother gave her an Africanized spelling of a traditional white name. From all this I surmise the girls mother is one of those grotesquely obese white women who lives in the ghetto on welfare and trained her child to become a victim of black violence. If my deductions are correct then this is the logical end for this girl. I strongly doubt she could have been saved. </p>

			<p>James is right. Young adolescent white girls with problems are the ones most at risk from pop culture portrayals of black men. The name of her school suggests some sort of alternative program for at-risk youth. I would bet those types of programs are very friendly to the idea of interracial relationships. </p>

Alot of people read the Rants and Raves section on Craigslist and this would be a good way to attract new members to Amren - and the white cause.  There&rsquo;s already alot of discussion there on racial issues, so it will be appreciated.</p>

<p>Great point Awakened! This is probably a question that most of us here at Amren have pondered. I find it hard to believe that a parent who has experienced the agony of losing a child, and the rage that must come from knowing that she suffered at the hands of these animals, could possibly worry about appearing racist. </p>
<p>It defies logic.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s about time White women woke up and learned about self-defense. Get a handgun and a ccw, learn to use it and keep it with you at all times! There are too many namby-pamby, bleeding heart liberal White men out there who won&rsquo;t or can&rsquo;t protect us, so we need to start protecting ourselves and our children. If all White women start shooting these black predators instead of becoming rape and/or murder statistics some elected officials may suddenly wake up to what&rsquo;s going on. <br>

			<p>The only way to keep violent black people from hurting other people is to make them afraid (or make them dead). Understand that such people are much like animals. When you reach out to them, apologize for them or justify their criminal actions, they can only see it as weakness.</p>
<p>And if you look into yourself, you might realize that weakness is what it really is.<br>

To all of you who essentially think &#8216;she got what she deserved&rsquo;, please keep in mind that this girl is a victim of popular culture and PC brainwashing. She&rsquo;s likely also a victim of parents, who to some degree, were either neglectful or uncaring.</p>
<p>Adults with life experience could be expected to &#8216;get what they deserve&rsquo; but many young white kids are adrift without caring parents and at the mercy of schools, tv, radio, movies, etc.</p>
<p>Adults who make these kinds of choices are a different matter.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t say &#8216;she got what she deserved&rsquo;. As a racially aware adult, I will say she got what I expected. She likely had no clue because no one was there to warn her along the way.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that this young girl was a victim many times over because there was not one adult in her life to teach her basic racial survival skills.</p>

			<p>Liberalism,aka, Marxism again and again shows that its policies are much more lethal and sneakier that Nazism, both socialistic tyrannies by the way. Desegregation, repealing miscegnation laws,1965 trasonous anti-whiteChristian immigration law, still unchallenged as unconstitutional genocide/culturalcide law, why ? Where is the supposed oppositional party, the Republicans been since 1965? It is a co-conspiracy for Western people&rsquo;s holocaust.</p>

<p>           Hope, I am a Hindu and I find it awful when you see low IQ blacks perverting the meaning of the word &lsquo;Karma&rsquo;. Please leave my religion alone. This is no Karma of the White race. This is the fruit of the Karma of the daughter&rsquo;s mother who never taught her daughter to stay away from a race which is very low in the bigger scheme of things, a race which does not even evolve a philosophy. The fact is her mother did not do her duty as a mother. And for this she has lost her child. For this she must suffer, suffer the fruits of her Karma. If reincarnation is true, then in his next birth he will meet the same fate at her hands as she faced in this life.</p>

			<p>If you want to commit genocide, your ultimate target would be women of child-bearing age of the group you are going after. No young women, no new generation for the group being persecuted. At the height of lynchings in the U.S. I don&rsquo;t recall one story about black, mexican, or indian women being strung up by an angry white mob. Instead of white men, it seems that more and more young white women and girls are being killed by simians and deranged perverts. Our future freedom fighters would do well to learn from the past, and think with their brains before any other bodily organ.   </p>

			<p>Hope, your sympathy for the victim of this crime is overwhelming.  It really reinforces our opinion that blacks are unable or unwilling to live by civilized standards and to understand the heinous scale of their acts or critically condemn those of their own race.  And as for karma, no doubt that karma will rain down on this gentlemens head for the rest of his imprisioned life.  Which is a good thing.</p>
<p><br>
Government interference with the &#8220;social contract&#8221; that blacks and whites used to live by has been distorted and debased to the point  where ever emboldened blacks backed by governmental force feel that white people are completely unwilling to defend themselves.  This is a dangerous precedent and leads to this type of incident.  Social interactions are very complex and officials not directly involved, and in fact sequestered from the type of relationships many  of us have had with blacks, are unable to legislate social harmony which is vastly different than reality can support.</p>
<p>Government needs to get out of the way and stop forcing races to integrate.  It puts enormous social pressure on people that only the heavy hand of government can contain.  Its our duty as citizens to choose who we do business with, socialize  with and interact with and if we choose to use race as a parameter than thats our right and prerogative.</p>

			<p>&#8220;To all of you who essentially think &lsquo;she got what she deserved&rsquo;, please keep in mind that this girl is a victim of popular culture and PC brainwashing. She&rsquo;s likely also a victim of parents, who to some degree, were either neglectful or uncaring.&#8221;<br>
or more probably she is the victim of parents who are &#8220;open-minded&#8221; and &#8220;progressive&#8221; and &#8220;liberal&#8221;, and you can now add another new label: &#8220;parents of a murdered daughter&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Any white parent with any degree of sanity would tell their daughter not to associate with any blacks, especially males. If the child does not comply with this directive, then the next step should be to disown her.</p>

<p>Her parents were probably flakes.  The fact that they willfully misnamed their daughter - &#8220;Nacole&#8221; instead of &#8220;Nicole&#8221; - indicates to me that they are idiots.  They bear the responsibility of allowing her to become so lost, that she ended up befriending a rapist and killer.</p>
<p>The blame for her gruesome murder of course lies solely with the loathesome beast who did it.</p>

<p>Hope is actually typical of many blacks in that they think it is whites who committ racial violence against them. They are happy when blacks kill, rape, rob or assualt whites (and other non-blacks). Every AR reader knows about the black moral character so no surprise there.</p>
<p>But she does raise a good point about karma. What if whites were doing this to them? Not in the movies, in school text books or on TV. But in real life, like blacks do to us. How would they feel?</p>
<p>Well, blacks are getting a little taste with what Mexicans are doing to them in California and Texas. When I read stories like this I think of these brown-on-black crimes and about the justice of karma.</p>

Ok, so that makes it all right!  /s</p>
<p>Thanks, &#8220;Hope,&#8221; for your insights.  You&rsquo;re, like, so deep.  Exactly how many white people should be killed before the karma is adjusted, in your deeply philosophical estimation?</p>
<p>Because there are many more than just one white who have suffered this kind of death.  MANY MORE.  Your tv and newspapers just don&rsquo;t mention them, Hope.</p>
<p>So in the World According to Hope, does this mean that any black or Hispanic is a suitable target for vicious murder as long as there are these horrible interracial crimes against whites?</p>
<p>Oh, and OJ is still walking around free.  In your puny mind, does that mean any random black man can be murdered to expunge the negative racial karma and right the racial wrong?</p>

<p>Most humans generally do not like seeing <i>any</i> creature, even animals, brutalized. But your justification of the murder of a child reveals an evil mindset. What does that say about <i>you<i>, as a human being? Are there no immoral actions that you cannot justify by the harm other blacks endured in times past? Did the Hall brothers endure brutalization by the family of their victim? (Or by <i>any</i> white person for that matter?) Would you justify the murder of a German child by a jew because of Germany&rsquo;s actions in WWII? The ancestors of almost <i>all</i> races were, at some point in history, brutalized by another race. Under your logic, however, the earth would never be anything but a Blood Planet. </i></i></p>
<p>Face it&hellip; you are simply justifying heinous criminal actions by a black man because you, yourself, have no morals. That&rsquo;s what many whites find offensive about so much of today&rsquo;s black culture: the total lack of such morals as are possessed by civilized human beings.</p>

			<p>The yong girl watched her mother entertain black boyfriends all her life. The violence perpetrated by blacks was seen as  &#8220;normal&#8221; for this girl.</p>
<p>With the media (that targets young teens) depicting more and more inter-racial dating as something to aspire to and the current laws that force whites to accept government-placed blacks into their neighborhoods, is it any wonder that increasing numbers of whites are becoming the victims of black violence? </p>
<p>Segregation should be part of the solution.</p>

<p>Posted by Awakened at 8:47 PM</p>
<p>&#8220;Great point Awakened! This is probably a question that most of us here at Amren have pondered. I find it hard to believe that a parent who has experienced the agony of losing a child, and the rage that must come from knowing that she suffered at the hands of these animals, could possibly worry about appearing racist. </p>
<p>It defies logic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Posted by Timothy1968 at 10:59 PM on August 20 </p>
<p>&gt; I hate to have to say it again, but the reason they fear appearing racist is based in the overpinning of the Christian principals, including the expoited notion of forgiveness.  We so often see the families of the victims of murder victims &#8220;forgiving&#8221; their children&rsquo;s Killers.  Even the parents in the Christian/Newsome rape/torture/murder case &#8220;forgave.&#8221;  What it really means is that they are admitting defeat and taking solace in a culture and faith the tells them it is virtuous to suffer and loose your most treasured possessions, even your family, as a demonstration of your faith.  </p>
<p>Most Amren readers probably hate me for bringing this stuff up continuously, which is what probably provides me with my main caution toward the Amren crowd.  But until would be White Seperatists correct this basic cultural error, saving the White race will remain a discussion only - IMO.</p>

<p>Yes, notawn - and let&rsquo;s not forget the 500,00 - plus cultural, family, structual damage done during the Civil War.  Untold oceans of White blood has been shed in &#8220;compensating&#8221; the great White sin of enslaving Blacks.  (I have to wonder who is compensating for the continuing White slave trade).  </p>
<p>Of course, Karma is a belief, not a reality, and I don&rsquo;t buy into it for one moment.  Plenty of bad people do splendidly in life and the maxim that &#8220;nice guys finish last&#8221; is all too evident to me in this world.  That the White race is addicted to &#8220;niceness&#8221; is what is making it and our lands so available to usurpers who have no moral delema whatsoever about taking all that we won&rsquo;t actively protect.<br>

			<p>Hope, I am a Hindu and I find it awful when you see low IQ blacks perverting the meaning of the word &lsquo;Karma&rsquo;. Please leave my religion alone. This is no Karma of the White race. This is the fruit of the Karma of the daughter&rsquo;s mother who never taught her daughter to stay away from a race which is very low in the bigger scheme of things, a race which does not even evolve a philosophy. The fact is her mother did not do her duty as a mother. And for this she has lost her child. For this she must suffer, suffer the fruits of her Karma. If reincarnation is true, then in his next birth he will meet the same fate at her hands as she faced in this life.</p>

<p>I see your point or is it the sheer fact, that you are so misguided that because you and most of your ilk have difficulties trying to get accepted within the white community, probably being a dark-skinned Indian, having very little chance at success you immigrate to the states or the UK to hopefully prosper and to perhaps be taken in as supposedly white, because you know back home you would be nothing, but now you live in this dream of being something that you are not and will never be. <br>
I know many people like you and so often, I always heard the same old drama. Satish, hey my friend, wake up and get some fresh air. You are asian, remember that. Like I was saying, I know about Karma and that is aptly well put; Karma. Whites are really getting a taste as to what many of us minorities go through,it&rsquo;s a really double-standard of whites. The brutality and the rape, the murder of innocent minorities. I don&rsquo;t wish bad ill on anyone(or white person), but the fact remains, this is a small glimpse of what we have to go through daily and when it happens to whites, it&rsquo;s an absolute tragedy of utter proportions. </p>

Hope, history has been rough on everybody, but, please, your people don&rsquo;t have to go through this daily, except from other black people.  Get a grip on yourself.  Tell you what, you start providing incidents of white on black crime TODAY that have happened within, say, a decade.

I mean violent crime, not corporate crime or war (tired arguments from people with your point to prove   &mdash;   besides, all we have to do is point to Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, etc.). </p>

			<p>    Dear Hope, When will the blacks of Uganda get their karma? They kicked out all Indians under the regime of that Mugabe like monster Idi Amin. I remember Idi Amin cutting up an Indian man and feeding the pieces to crocodiles. Where was our solidarity then? So does that give me the right to cut up a Kenyan girl and feed her to crocodiles too. Will that be justified by your twisted logic of &lsquo;Karma&rsquo;? </p>
<p>  There is no or minimal racism in White nations. I have lived in many European nations. I have never suffered a single episode of racism. The police in all those nations have been completely fair. In the USA, Asian Indians are one of the most successful ethnic group as far as economic mobility. We so not sit around blaming Whitey, stealing from Whitey and destroying Whitey&rsquo;s property. We came from a poor nation and have risen up while blacks sit around taking their welfare from Whitey&rsquo;s hard earned taxes, all day blaming others. You blacks have a &lsquo;complaining gene&rsquo;. </p>
<p>    If America would be such a terrible place, please explain why dont blacks leave and go to the Caribbean or some African country? Do not fool me. Your race does not go through anything that bad as you claim, but your race inflicts pain on others at every opportunity. Every Indian I know speaks of horror stories of black crime. Of blacks behaving like animals. We are not even in the same boat, sister. </p>
<p>   No no I am not misguided and I do not wish to be White or black. The world is not White and black, it is much more complex than that. Race is not about skin colour but about ANCESTRY. An albino African is not European. Indians come from snow White to jet black colour. That does not make us Africans or Europeans. We are still Asians.</p>
<p> And finally I am tired of blacks trying to show off about how much they know about and understand Hindu culture. Please do not defile our culture and do not show us your fake solidarity. Leave us alone.</p>

Personally, I think it&rsquo;s time whites adopted the attitude of non-whites when it comes to this type of thing, these murders. If the non-whites want to blame whites for (the exaggerated and imagined) ills of the past, we need to blame all of them for the ills of the present. While I understand they are really just tools of a higher bunch of white hating elites, I also see how the blacks and browns enjoy their roles. So let&rsquo;s hold them responsible for all of today&rsquo;s problems. Blacks destroyed Detroit. Mexicans have destroyed Los Angeles. Puerto Ricans and blacks destroyed NYC. Blacks and Mexicans destroyed Chicago. You can see where I&rsquo;m heading. Tit for tat. It&rsquo;s the only way to put an end to being pushed around. </p>

			<p>Apparently Hope thinks whites shouldn&rsquo;t be upset about the murder of a white girl.  Whites would also be upset if this happened to a black girl, but someone like Hope would not believe that.  That&rsquo;s because Hope is an anti-white racist.  Her stereotype of whites is that whites don&rsquo;t care when innocent blacks are hurt and this isn&rsquo;t true.  I notice that Hope expressed no sympathy whatsoever for the victim or her family.  That&rsquo;s because bigots such as Hope approve of black on white crime. </p>

<p>Eric, You are right. Many old melodious songs from old Hindi movies are released after being released with rap (rap is rubbish BTW). It brings to tears to the eyes of many tasteful Indians. Sometimes I wonder if mass immigration has two proposes for the New World Order (assuming that really exists). To dilute White populations and to infect the immigrants many from conservative cultures to the disease of modernism to which the West has already fallen. Most western born desis are morally loose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, Mr. Bhargav, I know full well your definition of &ldquo;karma,&rdquo; even as a white, because we whites are students of life and, thus, other cultures.

Skote, I agree. Most Whites (even after the reputation Americans have about being ignorant of the world, I am assuming you are American) tend to be well informed and interested in other cultures. Blacks are too self centered. Many blacks think India is more backward than Africa! Many have never heard of the Taj Mahal. But I prefer it that way. Blacks when they feign interest in my culture twist it up so badly, I wish they would have remained ignorant. Your ancestors were civilised and can thus understand the philosophy of other civilisations. The same thing cannot be said of blacks.<br>

			<p>Hope is correct. Everyday in Memphis a black person is killed - a stabbing, a drive-by shooting, a child beaten to death by momma&rsquo;s boyfriend, schoolchildren attacking each other, etc. Just last week a teenager was raped by an HIV infected lifeguard at a public pool. The leadership of Memphis never bothered to check the background of a city employee working with children. Or check to see if a lifeguard who might need to administer mouth-to-mouth has a communicable disease. BTW, all these perpetrators are black, including the leadership of Memphis.                               </p>

			<p>&ldquo;And, Mr. Bhargav, I know full well your definition of &ldquo;karma,&rdquo; even as a white, because we whites are students of life and, thus, other cultures. Which is likely why Hope and others like her know next to nothing about the lives of anyone who&rsquo;s not black, even other &ldquo;minorities&rdquo; of the U.S.&rdquo;<br>
Skote, I agree. Most Whites (even after the reputation Americans have about being ignorant of the world, I am assuming you are American) tend to be well informed and interested in other cultures. Blacks are too self centered. Many blacks think India is more backward than Africa! Many have never heard of the Taj Mahal. But I prefer it that way. Blacks when they feign interest in my culture twist it up so badly, I wish they would have remained ignorant. Your ancestors were civilised and can thus understand the philosophy of other civilisations. The same thing cannot be said of blacks.</p>
<p>Surely, that is a fallacy at it&rsquo;s worst, let&rsquo;s not forget the countless distorted historical facts that were, excuse me written throughout the centuries by whites, what&rsquo;s never ceases to amaze me is how many hear just get burned at the collar wanting to lump an entire race together as a collective. Truly and sadly pathetic. when you talk about a group of people being uncivilized, please try to look at the people in power on a microscopic level and you just see a lighter color. <br>
You have no inkling as to what Blacks know and don&rsquo;t know, again, you met every single one. I am well traveled,informed, and educated. Think what you like and keep complaining, it will serve you not for the person that has fall to a level of attacking someone because of his and her race, has some serious mental issues and needs a serious evaluation on getting a life.</p>

<p>Well, no one is perfect Cassadilla(I know you are), hey, sorry for jamming in 50 words a minute in a moving vehicle, mistakes do happen and are bound to happen. I am not perfect, excuse me and thanks for the compliment, always happy to make uuhh, people like you happy. That means, I&rsquo;m doing my job.</p>

What the heck?  Hahahahahahahahhahaahaha!  Too funny.  If that gobbledygook is supposed to illustrate the cogent expression of an educated mind, it would seem our esteemed poster needs a &#8220;serious evaluation on getting&#8221; an intellect.</p>

Notawn, my dear friend, I know you might have a problem reading and most likely quite mentally dense, did you not read my earlier post  2 days ago, but I said, it is not relevant to the topic we were debating about. You can post stats all day long and some are fact based and some not, so what? Buddy, let&rsquo;s keep the conversation about the girl, that was the original discussion.  I do not need to lower myself to prove anything to anyone, this is not high school, if you want to get educated-There are plenty of Universities for you to attend.  </p>

<p>Interesting, but have you ever considered that your computer might be racist and is out to get you? Computers after all are the invention of whites and if you put two and two together, you may have the answer to all of your &#8220;mistakes&#8221; above?</p>
<p>Just think about it!<br>

Praise the gods, this is a dream come true!  Thanks, Hope!  Let&rsquo;s do have a battle of wits.  First, you need to go out and find some.  ;)</p>
<p>The challenge is Not Relevant, huh?  Hey, you brought it up.  I just challenged you to support what you said. This quote of yours is relevant, I guess:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;the fact remains, this is a small glimpse of what we have to go through daily and when it happens to whites, it&rsquo;s an absolute tragedy of utter proportions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can post stats all day long and some are fact based and some not, so what?&#8221;  (Yeah. Like the &#8220;fact&#8221; that this crime is a small glimpse into what blacks have to go through daily.  That&rsquo;s not a fact, Hope, unless you mean they are victimized by other people of color.  That&rsquo;s an opinion for which you cannot provide facts to verify.)</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re &#8220;educated&#8221; and you think data and stats can be summarily dismissed without scrutiny?  You scare me.  But I&rsquo;m not even asking for stats.  I&rsquo;m asking for actual reported crimes (news articles, police reports).  Is this too difficult for you?</p>
<p>And, of course, you provided the oh-so-common (yawn) &#8220;I don&rsquo;t need to to lower myself&#8221; defense.  (You have GOT to be a teenager.) The defense of those who are either not intellectually equipped enough to provide facts or are fabulously lazy. Which describes you?  Or are you both?  </p>
<p>BTW, are lawyers &#8220;lowering&#8221; themselves when they present evidence?  Just wondering&hellip;</p>
<p>How about it, Hope?  Since you are a &#8220;well traveled,informed, and educated&rdquo; person, I&rsquo;m begging you to educate dense little non-traveled me about the brutality that people of color have to suffer DAILY at the hands of whites.</p>
<p>Seems there would be hundreds of examples of white against black brutal crimes dating back to 1998.  Talk about plucking low-hanging fruit!  What could be easier?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a proud person, but *I&rsquo;M BEGGING YOU, HOPE.  PLEASE EDUCATE THIS POOR BENIGHTED SOUL! </p>
<p>Or simply admit that it&rsquo;s blacks, NOT WHITES, who are committing daily brutal crimes against blacks.  And that Hispanics and blacks are also killing each other.  European-American white on black brutal crime is RARE.  Also, wouldn&rsquo;t you agree that blacks must have accumulated some extremely negative karma to be killing each other and dying at their current rate?  Must be payback for raiding, enslaving, and selling their own kind in the old continent, right?</p>
<p><br>
(*Hope will NEVER take this challenge.  EVER.  Hope will continue to squirm away like a human squid, spewing clouds of obfuscatory ink as it FLEES.  100% guaranteed.)  </p>

Notawn, God praise??? That&rsquo;s cute. I have to tell you, much to your distorted dismay, you can babble all day, YOU are not the issue here, please stop trying to be the center of attention. I feel you have some serious social dilemmas, so if you want to continue being insignificant regarding this topic, please rant.<br>
I don&rsquo;t need to take your challenge, what for? To impress or to enlighten you??? To give you allegeable credibility? I don&rsquo;t squirm for no one, never. It&rsquo;s like me ranting about the constant problems with serial killings or pedophiles that Whites consistently commit. Why do I have to go off on a tangent about  that. Again, has nothing to do with the issue.  I don&rsquo;t have to prove anything to you my dear friend, but it seems to me that you are having a problem with me, sorry to make you feel like an idiot.<br>
Anyway, take a walk, get some fresh air, hope you don&rsquo;t live near L.A., the smog can really damage your brain cells.(in your case, looks like it already has)<br>
Again, off the topic. I still stand by my original statement and this is what I call coming back full circle, Karma.</p>
