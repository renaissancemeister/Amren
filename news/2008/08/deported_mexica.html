<h1><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26379348/">Deported Mexicans Face Broken Lives</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, August 24, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The towering black gate opens silently to an alley with walls of corrugated metal. Scrawled in large white letters on one wall is: &#8220;The End.&#8221;</p>
<p>For those deported from the United States, the words are an unnecessary reminder. Nearly every hour of the day, guards unlock this gate that leads back into Mexico, clicking open the padlocks hung on each side, in each nation.</p>
<p>Every time the gate slams shut, it wipes out a dream, divides a family, ends a life lived in the shadows of the law.</p>
<p>On average, 700 Mexicans expelled from the United States walk through this gate daily, according to Mexican government figures. They include farmers, construction workers, prisoners, nannies, children, entire families.</p>
<p>A few steps from the gate, American tourists pose for photos in front of a stone relief. They are oblivious to the men, women and children sadly shuffling into a homeland many risked their lives to leave.</p>
<p><b>Deportations jump 60 percent</b></p>
<p>U.S. deportations have jumped by more than 60 percent over the past five years. Mexicans accounted for nearly two-thirds of those deportees, helping to roll back one of the biggest migrations of recent history. All along the border, shelters once full of people trying to cross into the United States are now home to thousands of deportees who sleep on mattresses strewn inches apart on cement floors.</p>
<p>In a week spent at the Tijuana gate, The Associated Press watched busload after busload of deportees arrive, some in a daze, still stunned over their sudden expulsion. Many stumbled over the Mexican official&rsquo;s question, &#8220;Where are you from?&#8221; after spending decades in the United States.</p>
<p>The faces of those who stream through reflect how tough and far-reaching the U.S. crackdown on illegal immigration has become.</p>
<p>Among them are young people. There were more than 18,000 repatriations of children under 18 to Mexico this year, and in more than 10,000 cases they were alone, according to the Mexican government.</p>
<p>There are also criminals. The U.S. does not break down figures by country, but it has deported about 55,000 prisoners so far this year. One man walked through the gate in slippers with 80 cents in his pocket, after being picked up by police during a violent fight with his wife in their backyard.</p>
<p>And there are women, with more than 40,000 repatriations since January &mdash; about 13 percent of all cases, according to the Mexican government. Sometimes the women are dropped off alone, at night. The U.S. Border Patrol in Washington says the safe repatriation of women is a major concern, but acknowledges there is no overall policy along the 2,000-mile border.</p>
<p>Mexico must now deal with a population that it has long ignored. And those returning must deal with Mexico, a land that for many now seems foreign. The challenge starts the day they walk through the gate the U.S. Border Patrol calls Whiskey II, military code for west of the port of entry.</p>

<p>There is no painless solution to uncontrolled immigration. Yes, illegal aliens suffer when we deport them. But if we do nothing, the social cohesion of our country will sooner or later break down. <i> We simply cannot assimilate the immigrants flooding across across our border, and it is insane to demand that we do so. </i></p>
<p>I just love how they portrayed Americans as insensitive and oblivious in the fifth paragraph. Do the elitist twits in the MSM really believe we don&rsquo;t notice these things?</p>

			<p>This is quite possibly the most twisted piece of journalism, I&rsquo;ve had the misfortune to read in my lifetime. One wonders if Jeraldo Rivera could have written this. The ominous black tunnel, their lives are ruined, as opposed to the former utopia they left to begin with? What part of ilegal invaders is so hard to comprehend? What is the relevance of 80 cents in his pocket? Should we have given them a reward before sending them back? If there is ever one ilegal still remaining in the U S it would be one too many.   </p>

			<p>Although this article is written in a way to make the reader feel sorry for the illegal aliens&rsquo; predicament, I frankly don&rsquo;t buy it. I don&rsquo;t feel sympathetic towards people who have completely no respect for our immigration laws, violated our nation&rsquo;s sovereignty, created job competition and depressed wages, abused our welfare system, put countless hospitals out of business, crowded schools, committed a multitude of crimes, as well as many other various, negative things.</p>

			<p>Well, what is the Mexican government doing to mend the &#8220;shattered lives&#8221; of it&rsquo;s citizens who have been deported from the US? Oh, I no, point them back towards the border.</p>

			<p><i>Every time the gate slams shut, it wipes out a dream, divides a family, ends a life lived in the shadows of the law.</i></p>
<p>When the first step of your dream consists of breaking the law, who&rsquo;s to say you didn&rsquo;t get what was coming to you?  They should be glad that all they got was a free bus ride, and not jail time and a caning, as in Singapore, or being doused with gasoline and set on fire, as in South Africa.</p>
<p><i>There were more than 18,000 repatriations of children under 18 to Mexico this year, and in more than 10,000 cases they were alone, according to the Mexican government.</i></p>
<p>10,000 unaccompanied children?  It must be those famous Mexican family values at work again!</p>

			<p>How about little Tommy and Susie&rsquo;s dream of the future destroyed by these illegals? How about their education<br>
ruined by classrooms filled with non English speaking <br>
&#8220;students&#8221; with no interest in school anyway?<br>
How about Tommy and Susies parents whose hospitals are <br>
bankrupted by illegal aliens unpaid bills?<br>
How about the cops in Tommy and Susies parents hometown<br>
gunned downed by illegal alien criminals who flee to Mexico?</p>
<p>When do we hear the sob stories about them?</p>

			<p>On the way out of the country they should be given a token farewell gift from the People of the United States, a video tape of the illegals burning American flags in Los Angeles, running Mexican flags up our flagpoles, painting graffitti all over our schools, Hispanic gangs shooting down American streets, Hispanic gangs selling drugs, Hispanics breaking into cars for stereos etc etc&hellip; </p>

<p>And it also opens up an employment opportunity for a citizen, reduces somewhat a factor responsible for driving down wages, plus it puts one less crime and poverty unit out of our neighborhoods, forcing him to take his underperforming brats, sucking up social benefits, with him eventually, and there is one less person in line at the emergency room, which means the hospital he freeloads on will have a slightly better chance of staying in business to take care of legitimate citizens.</p>
<p>The benefits to Ameicans are so great they couldn&rsquo;t possibly be all listed in this forum.</p>
<p>If this radical leftist AP reporter weren&rsquo;t so dimwitted, he might realize also that a trip south for these people is a trip home.   Who in his right mind with half a brain wouldn&rsquo;t want to see people return to the land of their fathers?</p>

			<p>Whoever wrote this needs to be writing soap operas for TV.I broke down and cried the whole time I was reading this.</p>
<p>If we would enforce our border laws we wouldn&rsquo;t have to listen to all these whiners complaining every time we deported a bunch of illegals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m beginning to wonder if those we are flying back are drug dealers that just need to get back to Mexico City as quickly as possible in order to get a new shipment to bring back in and not ordinary illegals. <br>

			<p>&#8220;Broken lives&#8221;.</p>
<p>Oh, boo hoo hoo!</p>
<p>This is like claiming that convicted criminals lead broken lives.  When someone attracts official trouble by committing a crime - whether robbery or illegally invading someone else&rsquo;s country - they have broken their own life.</p>
<p>As an ex-con, I am also aware that with some self-discipline and a good sense of humour, it isn&rsquo;t too hard to pick up the pieces and start again.  I finished my supervision, I paid off my mortgage, I got married, and now I have a daughter.</p>

			<p>What a terrible thing to do to Mexicans? How uncaring can we be? What could be a more horrible fate? Is the writer kidding? They are going HOME, SWEET HOME. I sincerely hope they will rekindle their passion for marching, waving their country&rsquo;s flag, and demanding a resonable life from their own governments. We do not owe them anything. When they&rsquo;re all gone, I suggest sending all the pro-illegal organizations like La Raza, The ACLU, and all the people who been profiting from illegal immigration behind them.</p>

			<p>If I were a gambling man, I&rsquo;d wager the vast majority of regular newspaper-readers are White.</p>
<p>With stories like this the newspapers shouldn&rsquo;t be wondering so much about where their readership has been going in recent years and why so many newspaper chains are busy selling off assets to stay afloat.</p>

			<p>Golly, that article put tears in my eyes   &mdash;   from the laughter.  Any Mexican who wants to be spared a family break up can simply stay in Mexico.  Jeesh.  &#8220;But,&#8221; sobs the liberal, &#8220;they&rsquo;re poor and simply  want a better life!&#8221;  Well, there are about 4 billion people who are even poorer than Mexicans.  Do we have to let them all in? </p>

<p>  &mdash;  H.P.W.M.O.</p>
<p>There are plenty of people who feel sorry for stray cats and end up with about 200 of them in their homes, which quickly end up as unliveable, unsanitary ruins full of cat waste and dead and dying cats.  Police are typically involved only when the neighbors complain about the smell.</p>
<p>We call these people &#8220;insane&#8221;.  Applying this appelation to those who would admit the population of the entire Third World to the developed West is eminently fair.</p>

			<p>Sure many of them do. It&rsquo;s a Mexican tragedy: not an American one. But we played our part by allowing 60 million to come here since 1930 so American corporations, who broke their contract with the American worker, could exploit them and use them as scabs against the unions. Then the modern liberals moved in and ensured the situation became permanent. </p>
<p>The solution is that we must end illegal immigration, chain migration, restore immigration quotas to conservative levels and work with Mexico to repatriate their people. That may mean some foreign aid and lending our expertise to assist that broken country in solving some of their own problems. That&rsquo;s the neighborly way. What isn&rsquo;t neighborly is to allow the invasion to continue though.</p>

<p>How about those American victims of Mexican criminals whose lives have been broken?  How about the loved ones these victims leave behind?</p>
<p>A recently-deceased friend of mine lost two out of his three children to irresponsible drivers over the last few years.  </p>
<p>One of these drivers was known to be a drunk-on-his-rear Mexican with no license, insurance, or registration.  His whole family was in the car.  But when he was apprehended, he wasn&rsquo;t even arrested, but instead turned loose to continue wreaking carnage on other Americans.  This happened in the L.A. area, and the incident killed his oldest child, his son. </p>
<p>The second child, the younger of his two daughters, was mowed down in Las Vegas, Nevada.  They never found the perp (it was a hit-and-run), but a witness thought he might have looked Hispanic.</p>
<p>My friend&rsquo;s life was BROKEN, and so possibly were the lives of his wife and the older daughter.  My friend never recovered from the loss of his son.  He went into depression.  After the second tragedy, he went downhill and died just a few months ago.</p>
<p>As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, SCREW all the lousy, drunk-driving Mexicans.  By all rights, my friend and his children should still be alive and kicking.<br>

			<p>Mexico should deal with its own people, but more importantly it is time for Mexicans to deal with their government. I have an idea. This is where LA RAZA, LULAC, MECHA, and MALDEF, among dozens of other subversive(to the interests of the U.S.) organizations could help. This would even include the traitorous and subversive Mexicans who teach here in our universities, on how to overthrow the Southwest and take it back for Mexico. Every American concerned enough about the issue, knows who these people are by now. Indeed, all these groups and people, could stop causing problems here, and use their brilliant methods of activism and organization  &mdash;  in Mexico, rather than in the U.S., where they are truly not working in this nations best interests.</p>
