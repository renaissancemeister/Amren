						<p>After more than two decades on the books, a little-known yet strictly enforced federal law barring foreigners with HIV or AIDS from entering the country is on its way out.</p>
<p>Tucked in a bill pledging $48 billion to combat the disease, signed into law by President Bush last week, was language stripping the provision from federal immigration law.</p>
<p>But that change didn&rsquo;t fully lift the entry ban on visitors with HIV or AIDS, which applies whether they&rsquo;re on tourist jaunts or seeking longer stays. The secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services still needs to delete HIV from the agency&rsquo;s list of &#8220;communicable diseases of public health significance,&#8221; which includes tuberculosis, gonorrhea and leprosy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When HIV first surfaced, researchers didn&rsquo;t know how it was transmitted, but it has long been widely known that HIV is not easily contracted and that even people with full-blown AIDS can live for a long time, said Patterson, who has taught for 15 years at the University of Texas Health Science Center.</p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>Congressional support for lifting the travel ban was bipartisan and strong, but not unanimous. Leading the opposition was U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith of San Antonio, the top Republican in the House Judiciary Committee. He sent a missive to his colleagues titled &#8220;The bill threatens the health and lives of Americans.&#8221;</p>
<p>The e-mail cited the CBO&rsquo;s April report predicting that revoking the travel ban would allow an estimated 4,300 immigrants with HIV to enter the country in 2013, increasing to 5,600 by 2018. Smith&rsquo;s message left out the report&rsquo;s estimate of the public cost of treating these immigrants and their children between 2010 and 2018: $83 million.</p>
<p>Smith warned the disease has killed more than 500,000 Americans despite improved treatment and that allowing infected foreigners in would increase public risk.</p>

			<p>The cost to taxpayers and health insurance industry will be staggering as all people around the globe will seek the $300 needed for air fare to the US to allow themselves unlimited health care here. Not only will this include the cost of medications but also the cost of unlimited hospitalization, social services after their hospital stays, and welfare for their families who will follow after them.</p>

			<p>After Obamination is elected, taxes (for people who actually work) will go way up to pay for all the PC social programs and to correct &#8220;inequalities.&#8221;  Of course, if you don&rsquo;t work, then there is no problem.  Remember   &mdash;   when you go to work, you are actually working not for your family, but for health care for some African immigrant who got AIDS through anal sex.  Now do you feel better?  </p>

<p>This government has been dysfunctional now for many years.  It&rsquo;s now beyonf the point of any kind of repair.  Our only real solution is to erase everything and start over again.</p>
<p>All we need is a complete economic collapse to get started.</p>

<p>HIV IS a communicable disease and we can&rsquo;t risk having someone come here and spread it to our citizens nor can we afford to bear the costs of treatment. We already have 44 million uninsured americans as well as illegals getting free healthcare. <br>

			<p>Of course, every single third world HIV sufferer (there are millions and millions of them), will be well advised to do one thing:<br>
 Sell-up all your property and belongings, go to the nearest travekl agent and purchase one way tickets to the USA for himself and all family members.</p>
<p>Once on USA soil, the strategem is very simple:</p>
<p>Claim that your &#8220;UN guranteed &#8216;right to life&rsquo; &#8221; is being violated by your own government by its refusal to fund AIDS therapy.Sit on the floor of your friendly cooperative neighborhood church for months in a &#8216;protest&rsquo;, go on hunder-strike, get as many lefty idiots as possible to shout and scream (they do this oh so well!)your case as possible.</p>
<p>Come on all ye HIV sufferers, you have nothing to lose (literally) but everything to gain (ie free housing, education, $100,000s of medicine and medical care gratis US taxpayer), come on go to the USA and try it on!!!.</p>
<p>Just why haven&rsquo;t the politicians figured this out?</p>

			<p> For much of our history, immigrants with communicable diseases were barred from the United States for the safety of the general population. It is obvious that our government no longer cares about the health and safety of the average citizen. Diversity and the gruesome cult of political correctness trump the safety of our citizens.</p>

			<p>Our leader have lost their minds.  The U.S. must borrow money from China, Japan et al. to pay the bills yet we can affordo to send billions to fight aids in Africa and now import aids cases here.  I&rsquo;m sorry but aids in Africa falls under the category of SEP (somebody else&rsquo;s problem).</p>

			<p>With the exception of contaminated blood transfusion,<br>

active, wilfull behavior(s) in order to get AIDS.  <br>
AIDS is not a disease that attacks a person. </p>

			<p>Dear Mr. and Mrs. William P. Smith:</p>
<p>Please be advised your caring loving government is advising you that as of now, your fine son, gravely wounded fighting our country&rsquo;s war in Iraq   &mdash;   is no longer able to pay for his disability benefits.</p>
<p>While we, your caring government, fully agree that your son did not suffer his grieveous wounds due to negligence or carelessness, your government simply cannot afford to support him in perpetuity. As a thinking, caring and sharing citizen, you must, of course, understand there are millions of poverty-stricken individuals in this world&hellip; especially those in Africa and Asia, who are in just as desperate need of free medical help and financial support as your son. </p>
<p>We are honor-bound, as a nation, to help these impoverished people who acquired this horrible disease though no fault other than their own refusal to only indulge in protected sex. It would be harshly unjust to let them suffer their fate, thus we are bring millions of HIV sufferers to American hospitals to be cared for and supported by your taxes.</p>
<p>Kindly exlain this to your son. Help him understand that in spite of those horrific wounds received, your country nevertheless expects him to soldier on and support himself as best as he can. After all, his privilege of being borne White has been more than enough. He had enjoyed enough rewarding years and it is now time to concern ourselves with those less fortunate.</p>
<p>Our best wishes to your injured son and we expect him to make do as best as he can.</p>

			<p>One has to wonder about the sanity of the diversity crowd, but at least they&rsquo;re consistent. One, two, three strains of HIV in America is not enough: we need to import all the wondrous strains of this colorful, vibrant virus to truly appreciate HIV diversity. After all, HIV diversity is a strength.</p>

<p>Are these supposed to be points in support of lifting the ban?  Just because AIDS is now treatable    &mdash;   but not curable   &mdash;   is a terrible rationale for admitting more people with the disease, unless the goal is lining the pockets of big pharma, as another commenter suggested.  Plus keeping them alive and vigorous for longer actually increases their ability to continue to spread the disease, especially if, as third-world immigrants (presumably), they are ignorant or misinformed as to how HIV is transmitted.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Today everyone knows that you can&rsquo;t get AIDS from sitting next to someone on an airplane or sharing a bathroom  &mdash;  American policy should reflect this,&rdquo; said Victoria Neilson, legal director of Immigration Equality, a New York-based advocacy group that has led a years-long campaign against the ban.&#8221;</p>
<p>And how will this country be better by letting in people who don&rsquo;t know that it isn&rsquo;t cured by raping a virgin?</p>
<p>HIV is a highly mutable virus.  What happens if one of these human petrie dishes we admit to this country happens to breed an airborne strain, that can be spread like pneumonic plague?</p>
<p>And the estimate of $ 83 million sounds laughably low.  Who knows how much it would ultimately cost to treat everyone who wants to come to America for one of the most expensive diseases to treat.</p>
<p>They are traitors who govern us.</p>

<p>Right. We live in a country where 44 MILLION Americans lack medical insurance yet the government wants to import foreigners with AIDS, which will cost the government 83 million dollars. That amount alone could pay for the medical care for every uninsured American times 2. The stupidiy of our government combined with their complete lack of caring for their own citizens boggles my mind.</p>

<p>Assuming that it only costs a little less than one dollar to insure someone, which is way to low.</p>
<p>My point was that we should not accept the CBO&rsquo;s numbers.  How do we know that it won&rsquo;t be 10&rsquo;s or 100&rsquo;s of thousands of the HIV infected who will try to come to this country.  This could end up costing far more than even $ 83 million&hellip;&hellip;it could cost untold billions.</p>

			<p>For those interested, here is a 2003 article describing HIV diversity, superinfection, and the potential for drug resistance in existing and recombinant HIV strains. The AIDS civil rights groups, in lobbying for relaxing our immigration laws for those infected with HIV, will quicken the evolution of drug resistant HIV strains, and quicken the progression to AIDS in those infected.</p>

They see it as the more people in the USA with HIV/AIDS, the more funding that goes into it, the more research, the faster the cure&hellip;etc They have a very good lobby &amp; a very happy to support media climate exists that runs their propaganda virtually unedited and mostly unquestioned. Thanks to a FUD campaign, they raised the fear level enough to make the image of the disease one affecting a broader community and during the moments of panic got virtually unlimited access (to public funding) for any and all treatments in the USA.  They&rsquo;ve won that part of the battle. </p>
<p>$83 million? I don&rsquo;t think so, more like 30 to 120 billion dollars. Most of them will end up in hospitals and the  cost will be passed onto everyone else, so not a direct government payout, but I would be willing to wager that the costs just to public health programs will be closer to 10x-12x that amount if St Louis Connect Care is more typical of public health budgets.  This will mostly hurt those who are disabled from other diseases, and raise hospital costs a few more percentage points over the course of it.  So when you pay $50 for a dose of tylenol, you know where its going. </p>

			<p>That $ 83 million is far, far too low of an estimate.  It can cost over 1 million to maintain a single AIDs patient for hit/her entire life.  This is part because of all the other problems associated with AIDs.  The total cost per person with aids for their entire life &amp; burial is about 1/2 to 1 million Dollars.  Hence, allowing 10,000 Third World AIDs patients into the USA will cost you (the taxpayer) about 8 Billion Dollars.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s OK, just raise taxes on USA citizens.  </p>

<p>Yes, come to think of it, you&rsquo;re right. I was tired when I figured that one. LOL However, 83 million could still  provide a lot of medical care for some uninsured americans in need. I realize those numbers are likely not accurate but just assuming. However, we shouldn&rsquo;t be letting anybody with communicable diseases in, even if it cost zero. Some of those HIV positives will sleep with the native populace and pass it on.<br>
