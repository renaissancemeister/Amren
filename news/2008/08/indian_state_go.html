<h1>Indian State Government Encourages People to Eat Rats</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Melanie Lee, Reuters, August 18, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Authorities in Bihar, one of India&rsquo;s poorest states, are asking rich and poor alike to switch to eating rats in a bid to reduce the dependence on rice. They even plan to offer rats on restaurant menus.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eating of rats will serve twin purposes &mdash; it will save grains from being eaten away by rats and will simultaneously increase our grain stock,&#8221; Vijay Prakash, an official from the state&rsquo;s welfare department, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Officials say almost 50 percent of India&rsquo;s food grains stocks are eaten away by rodents in fields or warehouses.</p>

			<p>I was listening to this ultra-liberal British women on a Progresseve radio talk show some weeks back. She was the type of person that goes around idolizing primitives that live in remote areas and tells folks how much we in the Western World can learn from them. She was a famous world adventurer, traveler. I&rsquo;m sorry but her name escapes me.</p>
<p>She was talking about her trip to India and how she and a fellow traveler were boating down the Ganges River and the feeling of holiness that overcame them. Then she said that you could see the carcasses and remains of all kinds of animals in the river, the remains of dead humans floating around the edges, etc.,that are still put in the river according to the beliefs of some Indians. Then she went on to say that even though it was &#8220;kind of weird&#8221; they had taken some drinks from the river. After admitting this even the liberal host of the show said, well, but, is that &#8220;OK&#8221;, etc. But seeing she was lost in her own little fantasy world, the host kind of kept quiet and just let her continue to talk about her &#8220;adventures&#8221;, while happily questioning her, as if she were a normal intelligent human being.</p>
<p>Unfortunately,these are the kind of people that negate others votes on important issues of all kinds. It didn&rsquo;t surprise me, having read so often on this forum about the present state of England, that she was English. Lord help us, and keep us safe from these demented and &#8220;open minded&#8221; idiots.</p>

			<p>Yuk this reminds me of an episode of travel sick.Grub Smith the Host visits an inidian temple dedicated and swarming with rats.Their was a scene where the rats were eating each other.This is nothing compared to what is for sale at a chinese wet market.I guess the indian government has found a way to avoid calling the Orkin man.</p>

			<p>Well, I guess eating rats makes sense for a country like India. But its yet another thing that shows the difference between India and a European nation. Speaking of India, I saw a TV show in which Penn and Teller visited India, and the thing that struck me the most was the sheer number of flies everywhere  &mdash;  outdoors, in the shops, in the homes, everywhere. Even the camera couldn&rsquo;t escape them. I guess you can chalk it up to the sheer number of people there as well as the poor sanitation in India.</p>

			<p>It may sound crazy, but it constitutes an improvement on the current practice of serving precious grain to temple rats while millions go hungry. At least they&rsquo;ll be getting some much-needed protein.</p>
<p>This is one example of why I&rsquo;m opposed to sending foreign aid to places like India. They need some incentives to abandon their millennia-old cultural and religious beliefs and practices for something rational.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what illustrates G-d&rsquo;s sense of humor more: the fact that this woman drank from a river where she could see dead animals and humans floating in it, or that she did it and lived.</p>
<p>G-d must have been sitting in a bar on a Saturday night, and made this woman do that to win a bet. (&#8220;Zeus! You think YOU&rsquo;RE bad!?! Watch THIS!&#8221;)</p>

			<p>This is no big deal, as the rats are grain fed and don&rsquo;t eat garbage.  Plenty of white hunters in this country eat squirrels, which are just rats with bushy tails.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll say this&hellip;I work in silicon valley and this place is lousy with Indians.  They are truly some of the most depraved people on earth   &mdash;   sexually deviant and strange.  Remember, it was the Mongolians (Mughals) who built the Taj Mahal and much of the culture in India.  The dark skinned Indians are very primitive and backwards.</p>

  if you take the big picture /the global one in todays globalized world/ the sheer size of the third world populations /for some strange reason all of brown and black race/  and its  breeding patterns result in  such insanities which in time will naturally overflow to the west /already are in myriads of ways, sad you have not noticed yet/.due to their stupidity the self inflicted grief  propels the people to take any action to get out of their self-made hellholes whatever the cost thus creating never ending tsunami of human flesh into our lands the consequences of which are clear to see in our everyday, ever deteriorating lifes e.g. rising cost of fuel,food,raw materials,crime,environment etc. </p>

<p>It has to do with the fact that these same people are coming to white countries and breeding like, uh, rats.</p>

			<p>Most East Indians never evolved beyond the level of animals.  They eat and procreate and accomplosh little else.  Perhaps it would be better for India if the rats ate them&hellip; </p>

			<p>The two persons (or one person?) who posted on this thread about not having any problem eating rats proves that we really do not need more indians in our country. If we go on bringing them, more such comments will be popping up from indian readers and in not so distant future our own officals will be recommending such indian delicacies to us.</p>

  &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;   <br>
They certainly DO have something to do with it when these people are coming here, bringing all their habits and cultural baggage along with them, and living next door to you!</p>
<p>I recall one post from someone in Plano, Tex. (outside Dallas) who said their next-door neighbors  (Hindus) were worshiping snakes in their yard.  I wouldn&rsquo;t want them and their snakes living next to me. I&rsquo;d prefer Mexicans with their beer cans and loud mariachi music all night to snakes getting loose.</p>

<p>&gt; Not only this, but as a scientist myself, I have to wonder why those scientists are forgeting that rats are prominent disease vectors.  It was rats that brought Bobonic Plaque to Europe.  And they came by the way, from Inia and other points east.  </p>
<p>In fact, all those White Man&rsquo;s diseases that Amerinds always refer to in their diatribes against the white expansion in North America came to Europe first from Asia.  And they arrivedd with Ghengis Khan, the Mongolian conqueror.  Since Amerinds of North and likely South America came from Mongolia originally, they really have nothing to complain about.  It was just due to their isolation from the Eastern Hemisphere for so long.</p>

			<p>Some people in the US eat squirrels, so I don&rsquo;t see a problem with eating rats.  A squirrel is really just a rat with a socially-acceptable tail.</p>
<p>Ancient Romans ate dormice.</p>

<p><br>
A squirrel is not a rat   &mdash;    tail or no tail.  And (I looked it up)  dormice, despite the spelling, are NOT mice.</p>

<p>I just hope the snake worshippers don&rsquo;t move in next to the rat worshippers.  Can you imagine what neighborhood bedlam that would create?</p>

<p>It is because we ignore stories such as this that we have been &#8220;off track&#8221; for so long.  Most Americans know that blacks, hispanics, and arabs won&rsquo;t assimilate.  They also know that Japanese and perhaps Chinese immigrants would assimilate much better than most other nonwhites. </p>
<p>The only group that is always viewed as something different than what it really is is the Indian &#8220;Americans&#8221;. This is the only primitive third world ethnic group within our country that most white Americans blindly consider &#8220;advanced&#8221;. This blindnes needs to stop.</p>

So true. Just because you have a degree in engineering and wear a suit doesn&rsquo;t make you &#8220;advanced&#8221;. And then you go home and worship your rats and snakes!</p>

			<p>My point was that they&rsquo;re all rodents, and that various people in various areas and times have eaten rodents.</p>
<p>Indians have not created this &#8220;eat a rat&#8221; campaign out of thin air.  These rats are undergoing one of their cyclical population explosions - much the way other rodents do - due to several years of favorable climate and food conditions.  We see the same thing in the US southwest with mice; several good years for grasshoppers also gets us a lot of mice in the four-corners area, and then hantavirus (a rodent-spread hemmorhagic fever) becomes an issue.  In India, the main impact of this abundance of rats is the damage the animals are causing to the crops grown by peasant subsistance farmers.  Other animals there prey on the rats, to be sure, but this predation does not really address the severe short-term crop damage.  Besides: how many kraits and cobras does one really want around one&rsquo;s village and fields, anyway?</p>
