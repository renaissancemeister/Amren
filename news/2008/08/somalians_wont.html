<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>A Somalian woman who came to Norway more than 10 years ago is harshly criticizing her fellow Somalian immigrants and Norwegian authorities. In a new book, she claims Somalians themselves don&rsquo;t want to integrate into Norwegian society, and that Norwegian welfare programs make it easy for them to remain isolated.</p>
<p>A Somalian immigrant in Oslo is blasting her fellow Somalians for resisting integration. The Norwegian welfare system lets them get away with it, she claims.</p>
<p>The book written by Amal Aden, a pseudonym for the Somalian author, is already creating an uproar. Amal Aden wouldn&rsquo;t use her own name because of fears for her own safety.</p>
<p>In an interview with newspaper Aftenposten, the author said she hopes to launch a new debate on immigration and what can be done to further integration.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wrote the book in the hopes that children will get better lives,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I want to see more integration, and the responsibility for that lies with the Somalians themselves and with the authorities.&#8221;</p>
<p>She claims that resistance to integration is widespread especially among Somalian men, who fear losing their culture and religion. Many are afraid of Norwegians and view them as infidels who can&rsquo;t be trusted.</p>
<p>In her book, entitled &#8220;See us!&#8221; (Se oss!), Amal Aden claims the Somalians also exploit the Norwegian welfare state and have many children in order to qualify for more welfare payments. Many couples also &#8220;divorce&#8221; under Norwegian law in order for the women to receive even more welfare payments as single mothers, only to continue to live under Somalian customs with their Somalian husbands and have more children, the author claims.</p>
<p>She writes that violence is a part of life in Somalian homes, that young girls are often molested and women and children are intentionally kept isolated. Many Somalian men, she claims, prefer to live on welfare than accept jobs seemingly below their social status.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m tired of being patient with a situation where children aren&rsquo;t getting enough food at home, where women are beaten by their husbands, where welfare payments to the (Somalian) families are used by the men to buy (the narcotic) khat, where the willingness to simply obtain more welfare money is stronger than the ability to care for children,&#8221; writes Amal Aden. She accuses many spokesmen for the Somalian community of hypocrisy, saying they say they support integration when in reality they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Several Somalian activists in Norway are already rejecting the book and blasting Amal Aden for criticizing immigrants traumatized by war and poverty in their homeland. &#8220;Half of the Somalians in Norway have been here less than five years, have little education and have problems integrating,&#8221; claims Said Abdulwahab. &#8220;It doesn&rsquo;t help to criticize them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Abdulwahab has five daughters himself aged four to 14, but has sent them all to school in Kenya. Not, he claims, because Norwegians can&rsquo;t be relied upon but because he wants them to get a good education.</p>
<p>Major publishing firm Aschehoug has put out the book, saying that while it may be accused of stigmatizing Somalians, it&rsquo;s important to &#8220;release new voices&#8221; on the issue. Aschehoug editor Halvor Fosli said Amal Aden had &#8220;a brave pen.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Relatively large population in Norway</b></p>
<p>Somalians make up one of the largest immigrant groups in Norway, numbering around 20,000. Nearly half live in the Oslo area and most have come as refugees. Only 13 percent have had any higher education. and more than half are younger than 20 years.</p>
<p>Reuters reported on Monday that the number of people needing humanitarian aid in Somalia has leapt 77 percent this year to more than 3.2 million. A report by the Food Security Analysis Unit paints a bleak picture of a crisis compounded by failed rains, rising food prices, inflation, and the worst insecurity in the Horn of Africa nation since the early 1990s.</p>
<p>&#8220;Somalia is now facing the worst security situation in the last 17 years, with increased armed conflict and fighting, targeting of humanitarian aid workers, military build-up, increased sea piracy and political tension,&#8221; the report said. &#8220;This situation is severely undermining economic activities and humanitarian delivery, thus contributing to the overall deterioration in the humanitarian situation.&#8221;<br>

			<p>Why? Can anyone answer the question as to why these people that cannot compete or even survive in a first world country like Norway are allowed to be there?  What is their purpose?  Almost none can read or write.  These people are aliens in every sense of the word.  Could there be two places on this earth as diametrically opposed as Somalia and Norway?  Of course they won&rsquo;t integrate, how could they?  Why is western civilization hell bent on destroying itself?  </p>

			<p>Norway needs to cut-off these welfare programs that support immigrants. Such programs are turning Somali immigrants into nothing more than pampered parasites, with entire families collecting off the dole. </p>
<p>White Norweigians are forced to work and support them through their tax dollars, while Somali&rsquo;s greedily and lazily sit on their backsides, sucking off their host country like leeches.</p>
<p>Even worse, Somali&rsquo;s have brought a monsterous crime wave with them. A quick websearch will reveal how countless rapes and beatings have taken place on Norweigian females, with perpetrators having the audacity to blame Norweigian women for provoking such attacks with their Western attire. </p>
<p>They most definitely are not assimilating! If anything, they are trying to force their own ways upon their host country. The only thing they do not want to see change is their generous welfare system.</p>

			<p>When are white people going to learn?  Most of them, whether in Europe, North America, or the ANZAC nations, seem to live in a racial fantasy land where skin pigmentation is the only criterion of racial differentiation, and &#8220;people of color&#8221; are simply white people who happen to have dark skin, who really want to talk and act like white people, assimilate to white people&rsquo;s values, languages and customs, and live around white people. White people are convinced other races are only kept from assimilating and becoming just like white people in every aspect except skin color (and perhaps a few quaint lingering &#8220;multicultural&#8221; baubles like exotic native cuisines) by the &#8220;racism&#8221; of <i>other</i> &#8220;bad&#8221; white people, who perversely and immorally insist on the preeminence of skin color in judging others.  They are so eager to believe this fantasy that they will overlook and ignore behavior such as that of these Somalis in Norway, even when a fellow Somali readily perceives it and attempts to alert Norwegians to it.  They&rsquo;re living in an anthropological &#8220;dream world&#8221; that their civilizational achievements have allowed them to indulge, and it will take more than one rude shock such as is described in this article to shake them out of it.  Pray that the awakening comes before it is too late.</p>

			<p>So the Somalian &#8220;men&#8221; fear losing their culture and religion and are &#8220;afraid&#8221; of Norwegians and view them as infidels who can&rsquo;t be trusted. Weeeelllll- - go back to Somalia! Trust me, you WON&rsquo;T be missed. And what&rsquo;s up with this Somalian &#8220;activist?&#8221; I mean- - a Somalian activist in NORWAY!!!!! Would any of you have thought that this would ever be possible in your lifetime? They&rsquo;re from SOMALIA and don&rsquo;t want to take a job that&rsquo;s &#8220;below their status?&#8221; And just what was their &#8220;status&#8221; in Somalia- - the one that was in charge of catching bugs for supper! In my opinion, this entire article reads like a comic book. </p>

  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>I think the true desire on the part of most Norwegians, is not for them integrate, but for them to leave! Easier said than done, when the ultimate goal on the part of Somalians is to get a free ride. However, so long as Norways government continues to hand everything over to them on silver platters, there will be no getting rid of them. Plus, countless more human sponges will follow.</p>

			<p>Interesting article you link to, Gen X in OZ:</p>
<p><i>After being attacked by stones on a recent call, they are threatening not to take calls to Rosengård without a police escort. They are also demanding shatterproof windows and surveillance cameras on their vehicles. Bertil Ahlgren, a spokesman at Jägersros fire station where two of the men worked, told TT that their work situation was &#8220;completely unacceptable&#8221;. The firemen were attacked twice last week during calls in the city&rsquo;s Rosengård suburb.</i></p>
<p>And what, exactly, is Rosengård&rsquo;s population like? A bunch of mullet-wearing Swedish rednecks, perhaps?</p>
<p>Rosengård is described on another site this way:</p>
<p><i>Malmo suffered a sharp economic downturn in the mid-1990s, coinciding with high immigration. That meant that rapidly &#8220;unemployment got an ethnic dimension,&#8221; the city&rsquo;s mayor Ilmar Reepalu says. Some 3,000 immigrants come to Malmo each year, but the city only has housing for about 1,500, he told BBC News. The Rosengard area of the city is where many new arrivals go first.</i></p>

<p>Ah, yes, what a shock - black and/or Muslims and high crime. Funny how they seem to go hand in hand, no matter the country, no matter the time, no matter the &#8220;legacy of slavery&#8221; or not, no matter the &#8220;legacy of colonialism&#8221; or not.<br>

			<p>The Norwegian government has a history of treason, so their taking money from third-world governments in exchange for allowing third-world bottom feeders to enter Norway is hardly surprising.</p>
<p>https://www.merriam-webster.com/cgi-bin/mwwodarch.pl?Jul.28.2007</p>
<p>Since the Norwegian government is repeating the actions of their predecessors in the 40s, it is only appropriate that the Norwegian people repeat the actions of their predecessors in the 40s in dealing with the traitors in their midst&hellip;<br>

			<p>For people unable to create or sustain anything resembling civil society, Somalis demonstrate remarkable skill at tracking down welfare; in fact a very good article in The American Conservative a few years back (&#8220;The Great Somali Welfare Hunt,&#8221; I believe) detailed how the Somalis send out scouts hither and yon in search of freebies from the Evil White Man. That is partly how they came to live in Lewiston, Maine, where, as some tribal chieftain explained, &#8220;it&rsquo;s cold but the welfare is good.&#8221;</p>
<p>What on earth are the Norwegians thinking? What did they expect?</p>

			<p>I can&rsquo;t think of a better way to shame, disgrace and mock the white Christian nation of Norway than to allow the importation of repulsive black Muslims from Somalia.  </p>
<p>If I were Norwegian I would hunt Somalis until fear drove them back to Somalia and then I would target the traitors who admitted them.</p>
<p>If anyone has a better solution to this unacceptable problem I would love to hear it&hellip;        </p>

			<p>All this is due to the European Union, which requires all member nations to accept immigrants and especially &#8220;assylum seekers.&#8221;  It is all about projections of man power.  They think they are going to harness these immigrants to their industrial machines after &#8220;assimilating&#8221; them into the European culture.  But they are stuck at the assimilating stage.  Many members nations, Ireland and Denmark for example, are beginning to understand the cost of those earlier membership privileges. But once again folks, it is all about money - greed and the expansive nature of unchecked capitalism.</p>

<p>  I believe the African and Middle Eastern thugs make the same excuses in Sweden that women are provoking them by dressing improperly according to Shaira law. Why Norweigian and Swedish feminists don&rsquo;t oppose this criminal invasion proves that race always trumps gender for brainwashed, feeble-minded liberals. </p>

<p>Ah, yes - because people all the world over know that the best schools in the solar system are to be found in Kenya. It has nothing to do with him wanting to keep his children from assimilating. So they&rsquo;ll get educated in Kenya, pick up husbands in Kenya - maybe one of Barack Obama&rsquo;s half-brothers! - and then they&rsquo;ll return to settle in Norway, of course. Lather, rinse, repeat. The black/Muslim population automatically doubles every generation just from the spouses alone, before they even have a single child.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d suggest that while they&rsquo;re in Kenya they stay there.</p>

			<p>It literally turns ones stomach to witness in your own nation, and to read about what is going on with many &#8220;immigrants&#8221; in other Western Nations. The scams, the graft, the dishonesty, the lack of any moral values of many of the new &#8220;immigrants&#8221;, would be great material for a playwrite to produce a parody of what immigration to the U.S. has become. Of course it wouldn&rsquo;t even be considered by the politically correct slobs who work in entertainment nowadays.</p>

			<p>One of the most revolting sights I ever saw was a Somali getting on a train at a stop in a small town in Norway about 15 years ago. To see these cavemen in the homeland of my anscestors turned my stomach. Don&rsquo;t integrate them! Keep them isolated until you get the fortitude to send them home! They do not belong there and should not be made to feel they belong there.</p>

			<p>The sickest double standard is how blacks everywhere, feel Africans should be welcomed with open arms, and open pocketbooks in Europe. Yet will turn around and defend the slaughter of white farmers in Africa, who&rsquo;s ancestors arrived there generations ago, and  helped feed the nation. So long as whites keep being driven out of Africa, Europeans should follow the same standard, and drive out all African squatters. Let them go back, and live among their own people. And instead, Europeans should help out White Zimbabweans, and South Africans, who would be far more productive anyway. </p>

			<p>Somalians living on welfrare is not the problem. Really, that&rsquo;s just a waste of money. Nothing more. I&rsquo;m pretty sure it&rsquo;s an insignificant amount when compared to what the Norwegian government hands out annually to foreign countries. </p>
<p>The real problem with this situation is the very fact that Somalians are living in Norway. We should confront that, rather than the fact that immigrants underperform natives in all sorts of ways. </p>

<p>Yes, that is the problem.  Just like any introduced crop pest or  exotic disease, once Africans get to your country, you will have them forever!  Every day, every year, forever, your society will have to support these people.  It will continue for your children and your children&rsquo;s children.  The worse part is that the problems will only grow as Africans out-breed the native population and assume more and more of a hostile, aggressive, you-owe-me attitude.  Because of low IQ, they will never achieve or integrate, and will continue to be a festering, open wound to your society and nation, sucking massive amounts of money and time, until you (the host) has finally been destroyed. The ultimate end of adding weeds to your productive garden is the destruction of your garden   &mdash;   replacement by weeds.  The insanity is that we actually encourage weed growth by welfare, health care, housing and food subsidies, etc.  The goal of our governments is to destroy the garden and replace it with weeds.</p>

			<p>When I hailed the free market economy of the United States I was told that next to the Netherlands Sweden had the best social welfare system and compared to America they take better care of their black minorities&hellip;..this story is the result of that twisted multicultural thought process. I know for a fact that the Netherlands is perpetually keeping abled bodied people on welfare to maintain an under class and it seems to me that the same thing is happen in Sweden just like it is coming to the surface now in the US. One hand washes the other!</p>

<p>I have seen a few, not many, Finnish people from Canada and they told me Finland has a relatively strict immigration policy?  And consequently Finland is still mostly homogeneous.</p>

			<p>I visited Norway in 1994.  The Norwegian people are one of the most beautiful people of the white race on this planet.  Even more so than the Swedes.</p>
<p>When Vidkun Quisling acted as a collaborator to the WW11 Nazi invasion, the Nazis idolized the Norwegians and set up Lebensborn centers.  This is because the Nazis were eager to inter-breed with Norwegians.</p>
<p>But not all Norwegians were quislings to the German occupiers.  There was an active resistance movement until the liberation of Norway in 1945.  The Norwegian resistance played a major role in defeating the Third Reich by blowing up a Nazi nuclear power plant.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, with the way Norwegian government is bringing in Somali immigrants, the Norwegian government is acting in the very spirit of Vidkun Quisling.  I hope the majority of Norwegians, once again, start a resistance movement against these modern-day quilsings, to send the Somalis back to Somalia! </p>
<p>I would sure hate to see the Norwegian race become as extinct as the Passenger Pigeon!</p>

			<p>I have seen a few, not many, Finnish people from Canada and they told me Finland has a relatively strict immigration policy? And consequently Finland is still mostly homogeneous. <br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>Even Finland is not as homogenous as it once was. As the below article shows, of the 152,000 babies born there in 2002, 104,000 were born to foreigners. 40% are arriving via the Soviet Union, and their growing Somlaian population, are also arriving in Finland via through former Soviet countries. </p>

			<p>Somalis are the ultimate parasites. They will attach themselves to any White country foolish enough to let them into its territory. They are completely without shame. They represent the worst combinations of the black African and islamic worlds. Norway was a thousands times better off without them. Isn&rsquo;t it interesting how these leeches seem to find &#8220;refuge&#8221; in just about every White country in the world and no non-White ones? </p>

			<p>Not unlike what is happening in many other European countries, once these immigrants start feeding off their host, each succeeding generation will do the same. It is also the same welfare abuse pattern that we see in America, where generation after generation feeds off the system. Norway had better nip this in the bud soon, or soon they will be swarming with Somalians, and various other African, and non-white ethnic minorities arriving with their hands out, and demanding someone feed their bellies and put a roof over their lazy heads.<br>

			<p>I am a Norwegian and I have a question for you. </p>
<p>We are being told here in Norway that the Somalis are doing very well in the United States, and that they are one of the best integrated groups in the U.S.</p>
<p>Is this true? </p>
<p>As you can certainly understand, this argument is used against us Norwegians. Because if Somalis are one of the best integrated groups in the U.S., then it is the fault of the Norwegians that the Somalis do not integrate here in Norway.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be glad if you provide links with your answers. </p>

<p>You misread the article. 152,000 is the total number of foreign-born people resident in Finland (in 2002). Most of them are Russians, Estonians, and Swedes. Not more than a few percent of babies born in Finland are born to foreigners. Somalians are by far the largest non-white immigrant/refugee group, numbering around 10,000.</p>

<p>Money?  Man power?  Greed?   Yes it is.   All of those.  But it&rsquo;s far from that simple.  It&rsquo;s about  <i>a good deal more  </i>than just that!  Even without those temptations, it would still be happening.</p>
<p>Why?  It&rsquo;s about race-replacement and the elimination of national/ethnic majorities in <i> every </i> white, European-descended  country.  A  healthy, vigorous, self-aware majority with a strong sense of national identity can be a dangerous thing to those in control, and are a fractious group to manage.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about &#8220;electing a new people&#8221;.  It&rsquo;s about establishing a Babel of confused, bickering  minorities, none of whom has the numbers or power to constitute a clear majority   &mdash;    thus  making it much easier for the plutocrats to rule  over them.   Basically, it&rsquo;s the &#8220;divide and rule&#8221; strategy. It&rsquo;s working.  And it&rsquo;s happening everywhere.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Just like any introduced crop pest or exotic disease, once Africans get imto your country, you will have them forever!  <br>
Every day, every year, forever, your society will have to support these people. It will continue for your children and your children&rsquo;s children. The worse part is that the problems will only grow as Africans out-breed the native population&hellip;&#8221; <br>

I can&rsquo;t  imagine what historical debt  Norway owes to Somalia.  <br>
But give the Afro-centrist historians time, and I&rsquo;m sure that eventually some festering grievance, some racist outrage, will be found.   Norwegians will just have to pay for their past sins.</p>
<p>We just don&rsquo;t know yet what they are, that&rsquo;s all. But they will be found.</p>

			<p><i>&#8220;One of the most revolting sights I ever saw was a Somali getting on a train at a stop in a small town in Norway about 15 years ago. To see these cavemen in the homeland of my anscestors turned my stomach. &#8220;<br>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..<br>
I viewed a similar sight from a train window, several years ago, when stopped at a tiny town in Austria.  I couldn&rsquo;t help noticing a black man, Somali type, standing on the platform   &mdash;   with his white wife and half-breed baby.   I did not mean to stare, but he saw me looking and must have noticed the expression on my face.  He picked up the baby, held it up, and shook it at me defiantly and triumphantly, while grinning, as if to say, &#8220;Here&rsquo;s your future, white man!&#8221;    Of course, he assumed I was Austrian.  He would have no way of knowing I was just an American passing through.</p>

It&rsquo;s seems the goal of most blacks these days is to mix with as many whites, and non-blacks as possible. Their idea of Utopia is a world where everyone is mixed to some degree with black. Which is why so many of them see Brazil as the ultimate paradise. The other thing that sickens me is how many of them are truly convinced that they Europes brightest hope for the future. They often talk about how Europes white population is aging, and not having enough children. Then say that African immigrants are doing Europe a great service, by replacing them with young blood. They firmly believe that Norwegian culture, Italian culture, French, and Irish culture etc.. Have nothing to do with ancestral heritage, or race, and that simply by immigrating to, or being born somewhere in Europe, Blacks can replace them, and those countries will continue on as before, with the same image and culture intact. They are truly that deluded, and arrogant!<br>

			<p>With each wave of Somalians that flock to Norway, they, and their offspring, will expect to continue to be supported in such cushy style. Which they very definitely are receiving! Norway, along with Sweden, and Holland, are known for their generous welfare packages. And not surprisingly, they also have numerous Somali, North African, and Sub Saharan immigrants. </p>
<p>If Norway get&rsquo;s wise and suddenly decides to stop supporting these freeloaders, without deporting them. They can look forward to a wave of violent revolts, much like the kind France receives on a regular basis, by their dissatisfied immigrant &#8220;youths&#8221;, who on a yearly basis, decide to start rioting, and tossing molotov coctails at building and cars. </p>
<p>Their parents arrived as low-skilled laborers, but even though most of them are drop-outs, such lowly work is not good enough for them, since they are French born citizens! They demand high paying jobs, on minimal skills and education. </p>
<p>And most all of them are sitting in the suburbs collecting welfare. But the perks just aren&rsquo;t good enough, their surroundings too drab. So they revolt and terrorize French citizens. </p>
<p>The point is, they get spoiled, and expect everything handed to them on a silver platter. They, or their parents, arrived as Asylum seekers, often claiming they were being persecuted. And whether or not it is always true? or if most just moved there to enjoy the perks Europe has to offer? They still do what they would never have had the guts to do in their homeland, by rioting. Because unlike Europe, their home countries would punish them severely. But Europe is soft, kind, and generous, and they take full advantage of that weakness, and exploit it at every given opportunity. </p>
<p>Because Europe is so soft, and so welcoming to these immigrants, they are jeopardizing the safety of their own indigenous citizens. Which is truly an outrage!</p>

<p>Roger, I know you have asked for links and I am sorry I am unable to provide any.  The reason being the MSM refuses to report on the lack of integration of Somalis.  What I am going to tell you is fact as I have experienced this first hand and I live it every single day.  I live in Canada where we have countless Somalis.  I work amongst them.  By work amongst them, I mean that I work and they sit around on their arses all day reaping the benefits of my tax dollars.  While receiving welfare, our government also provides them with free daycare for their younger children and for their school aged children, for before and after school.  They are supposed to be out looking for work or attending English classes.  They do neither.  They register for the English classes and then do not attend.  They do not work at all.  They do not learn English.  They sit around all day in groups in the park chatting.  </p>
<p>As if this wasn&rsquo;t bad enough, they ram their Muslim culture down our throats.  They complain about Christmas trees, they complain about our public school curriculum including music, dance and God forbid co-ed swimming, they demand that the food served in schools be halal etc. The list of their demands is countless. I could go on and on, but I will stop myself.  Did I mention they don&rsquo;t work?</p>
<p>I know I keep repeating the phrase &#8220;they do not work.&#8221;  Sorry for the repetitiveness, but I feel like I need to drum this into your brain.  We have so many immigrants in Canada and I do not want this post to appear racist for fear that you won&rsquo;t take me seriously.  I want this post to be directed towards Somali immigration in particular.  I will admit that the Sri Lankans, the Chinese and other immigrants always seem to find employment, but the Somalis, that&rsquo;s a different story.  I cannot think of anything positive they have contributed to our country.  Pretty soon I think us whites are going to have to immigrate to Somalia as there will be less Somalians there than in the Western world.  Roger, don&rsquo;t say you weren&rsquo;t warned.   </p>

<p>They seem to particularly like moving to live around the Nordic racial groups and other far northern white places   &mdash;   Norway, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Minnesota.  Other less gullible countries, like Italy, have relatively few of them (despite having a stronger historical connection).  It&rsquo;s the Gypsies who truly pioneered the trend of moving to EVERY white nation, and NO non-white ones (the last one was Ireland, and at the Dublin airport on a recent changeover, the terminal was crammed with Gypsies arriving from Eastern Europe).   </p>

True enough.  But the question then becomes whether they have made this choice  on their own and have accomplished it  &mdash;    all by themselves   &mdash;    or whether they have BEEN MOVED there on purpose by someone ELSE who made this determination for them.</p>
<p>I vote for the last likelihood.   Somehow, I can&rsquo;t quite imagine a bunch of illiterate Somali tribesmen pouring over a world atlas, airline timetables,  government economic statistics,   comparing welfare benefits etc, in an effort to choose the fattest Nordic  plum for picking.   They are being steered!</p>
<p>And certainly  if their choice were made on the basis of climate and similar lifestyles to what they knew  back home, Minnesota and Scandinavia would be the very LAST places they would pick.  I&rsquo;ll say it again   &mdash;    they are being STEERED.  </p>
<p>Somebody has decided that Minnesota and Scandinavia  are just too damned white   &mdash;    and something had to be done about it.    Too many white people there.  Can&rsquo;t have that, can we?<br>

Yes, what insane folly it is.

			<p>Somalians are class A loafers. They swarm over countries they know will support them in style, and not even force them to look for work. They are also known for being chronic complainers, who make persistant demands that Western cultures adhere to their Islamic ways. On top of all of this, even though they come from a country where poverty is everywhere, and violence is rampant, most Somalians fancy themselves as regal beauties, with most of them convinced the world admires and envies them. They are revolting creatures.</p>

<p>It seems that the source of the myth of the successful Somalis in the U.S. is the economist Phillippe Legrain, author of the book &ldquo;Immigrants. Your Country Needs Them&rdquo;. <br>
 <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Immigrants-Your-Country-Needs-Them/dp/0316732486" rel="nofollow">https://www.amazon.co.uk/Immigrants-Your-Country-Needs-Them/dp/0316732486</a></p>
<p> He visited Oslo October 26, 2007, and said (my translation): &rdquo;Somalis in Minnesota, USA, are the immigrant group that starts most new ventures and have success, while in Scandinavia the Somalis are mainly unemployed. This shows that it is the society they live in, and not the Somalis themselves, that is the reason Somalis fail in Scandinavia&rdquo;.  Source (in Norwegian): <a href="https://www.dagbladet.no/magasinet/2007/10/26/516255.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.dagbladet.no/magasinet/2007/10/26/516255.html</a></p>
<p>As you can imagine, the Norwegian politicians have used this for all it&rsquo;s worth, and they keep telling us ordinary Norwegians that it is because we Norwegians are such evil racists that the Somalis are such a miserable  failure in Norway. </p>

			<p>Anyone who claims that Somalis are the &#8220;most successful&#8221; immigrant group in America (and they <i>all</i> make this claim; they can&rsquo;t all be right, can they?) is either a liar or so inept at handling data as to be unreliable about anything. The Somalis may surpass the Hmong, but I&rsquo;d be very skeptical about anything beyond that. They are irremediably primitive and violent.</p>
