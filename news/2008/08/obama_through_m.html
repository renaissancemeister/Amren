						<p>How do Muslims see Barack Obama? They have three choices: either as he presents himself, as one who has &#8220;never been a Muslim&#8221; and has &#8220;always been a Christian&#8221;; or as a fellow Muslim; or as an apostate from Islam.</p>
<p>Reports suggests that while Americans generally view the Democratic candidate having had no religion before converting at Rev. Jeremiah Wrights&rsquo;s hands at 27, Muslims the world over rarely see him as Christian but usually as either Muslim or ex-Muslim.</p>
<p>Lee Smith of the Hudson Institute explains why: &#8220;Barack Obama&rsquo;s father was Muslim and therefore, according to Islamic law, so is the candidate. In spite of the Koranic verses explaining that there is no compulsion in religion, a Muslim child takes the religion of his or her father.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  For Muslims around the world, non-American Muslims at any rate, they can only ever see Barack Hussein Obama as a Muslim.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition, his school record from Indonesia lists him as a Muslim. Thus, an Egyptian newspaper, Al-Masri al-Youm, refers to his &#8220;Muslim origins.&#8221; Libyan ruler Muammar Gaddafi referred to Obama as &#8220;a Muslim&#8221; and a person with an &#8220;African and Islamic identity.&#8221; One Al-Jazeera analysis calls him a &#8220;non-Christian man,&#8221; a second refers to his &#8220;Muslim Kenyan&#8221; father, and a third, by Naseem Jamali, notes that &#8220;Obama may not want to be counted as a Muslim, but Muslims are eager to count him as one of their own.&#8221;</p>
<p>A conversation in Beirut, quoted in the Christian Science Monitor, captures the puzzlement. &#8220;He has to be good for Arabs because he is a Muslim,&#8221; observed a grocer. &#8220;He&rsquo;s not a Muslim, he&rsquo;s a Christian,&#8221; replied a customer. Retorted the grocer: &#8220;He can&rsquo;t be a Christian. His middle name is Hussein.&#8221; Arabic discussions of Obama sometimes mention his middle name as a code, with no further comment needed.</p>
<p>&#8220;The symbolism of a major American presidential candidate with the middle name of Hussein, who went to elementary school in Indonesia,&#8221; reports Tamara Cofman Wittes of the Brookings Institution from a US-Muslim conference in Qatar, &#8220;that certainly speaks to Muslims abroad.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thomas L. Friedman of The New York Times found that Egyptians &#8220;don&rsquo;t really understand Obama&rsquo;s family tree, but what they do know is that if America &mdash; despite being attacked by Muslim militants on 9/11 &mdash; were to elect as its president some guy with the middle name &lsquo;Hussein,&rsquo; it would mark a sea change in America-Muslim world relations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some American Muslim leaders also perceive Obama as Muslim. The president of the Islamic Society of North America, Sayyid M. Syeed, told Muslims at a conference in Houston that whether Obama wins or loses, his candidacy will reinforce the idea that Muslim children can &#8220;become the presidents of this country.&#8221; The Nation of Islam&rsquo;s Louis Farrakhan called Obama &#8220;the hope of the entire world&#8221; and compared him to his religion&rsquo;s founder, Fard Muhammad.</p>
<p>BUT THIS excitement also has a dark side &mdash; suspicions that Obama is a traitor to his birth religion, an apostate (murtadd) from Islam. Al-Qaida has prominently featured Obama&rsquo;s statement &#8220;I am not a Muslim&#8221; and one analyst, Shireen K. Burki of the University of Mary Washington, sees Obama as &#8220;bin Laden&rsquo;s dream candidate.&#8221; Should he become US commander-in-chief, she believes, Al-Qaida would likely &#8220;exploit his background to argue that an apostate is leading the global war on terror .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  to galvanize sympathizers into action.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mainstream Muslims tend to tiptoe around this topic. An Egyptian supporter of Obama, Yasser Khalil, reports that many Muslims react &#8220;with bewilderment and curiosity&#8221; when Obama is described as a Muslim apostate; Josie Delap and Robert Lane Greene of the Economist even claim that the Obama-as-apostate theme &#8220;has been notably absent&#8221; among Arabic-language columnists and editorialists.</p>
<p>That latter claim is inaccurate, for the topic is indeed discussed. At least one Arabic-language newspaper published Burki&rsquo;s article. Kuwait&rsquo;s Al-Watan referred to Obama as &#8220;a born Muslim, an apostate, a convert to Christianity.&#8221; Writing in the Arab Times, Syrian liberal Nidal Na&rsquo;isa repeatedly called Obama an &#8220;apostate Muslim.&#8221;</p>
<p>In sum, Muslims puzzle over Obama&rsquo;s present religious status. They resist his self-identification as a Christian, while they assume a baby born to a Muslim father and named &#8220;Hussein&#8221; began life a Muslim.<br/>

			<p>If the truth were known, Obama has more in common with Calypso Louie and Jeremiah Wright than he does with anyone else of any group or faith.</p>
<p>The rabid hatred displayed by both these men at the very least is silently accepted by the Messiah.</p>
<p>The white following that the annointed one has are comprised of the dumbest, most gullible, naive whites in the country today, and it is these people who have harmed our country, our race, our traditions, and our way of life more than all the Calypso Louies, Jeremiah Wrights, and their coterie of white haters combined.</p>

			<p>  This article only goes to prove once again that, any way you look at him, Barack Obama is a dangerous hodgepodge. He is neither all-black nor all-White; neither a foreigner nor unmistakably an American; and ambiguous as to religion, in the extreme.</p>
<p>  Is he a Muslim? By the standard used by most Muslims, yes. Is he a Christian? He claims to be   &mdash;   but his pastor for 20 years preached a doctrine of racial hatred which can hardly be called Christ-like. Plus Obama is a friend and great admirer of a militant, White-hating black Muslim leader.</p>
<p>  Was he without religion before &#8220;becoming a Christian&#8221;? His father was Muslim; he spent six years living in an overwhelmingly Muslim country as a child, and attended a Muslim school. If it looks like a duck, and waddles like a duck, and quacks like a duck &hellip;</p>

			<p>Why don&rsquo;t these international surveys ask the Muslim world if they think Barack Obama ever inhaled MJ? </p>
<p>I think it is safe to say Barack Obama smoked and inhaled a lot of Hawaiian MJ? Deciding on his academic, community organizer career path and rocket speed rise in US politics, he had to be very high and it looks like it has pretty much worked out, Hawaiian MJ must be powerful stuff before the crash.</p>
<p>When do people think Barack&rsquo;s high on life, international race relations will crash?</p>

			<p>The bottom line is, whether Obama considers himself a &#8220;muslim&#8221; or not,muslims consider him a &#8220;muslim&#8221; because his father was one. The only other option is he&rsquo;s a member of some kind of white-hating,America-hating nutty religious order. </p>

I wish it were that simple. Even if BO were to do that, and he proved to America&rsquo;s satisfaction that he is a Christian and not a Muslim, there&rsquo;s still the question of what the Muslim world thinks of him. If they decide   &mdash;   and an extremist minority of them possibly already have   &mdash;   that Obama is a FORMER Muslim, that makes him an APOSTATE! </p>
<p>And Islam&rsquo;s penalty for apostasy is, course, DEATH. For believers, Islam is like the Mafia: nobody leaves and lives. </p>
<p>So while the libtards are fantasizing about how their bi-racial Christchild will &#8220;help heal our troubled relations with the Middle East,&#8221; we may instead be getting a President with a personal fatwah on his head for having betrayed the One True Faith [TM] by forsaking the Prophet Mohammed for the earlier and (in their view) decidedly INFERIOR and MINOR prophet named Jesus. </p>
<p>&hellip;Which means that the loving, caring, citizen-of-the-world, race-uniting flower child B. Hussein Obama has the potential to get us in even MORE trouble with the Arab world than the so-called &#8220;reckless cowboy arrogance&#8221; of the current admin. If they think homeboy&rsquo;s one of them, they&rsquo;ll expect cushy, cozy treatment from the new brown-skinned honcho   &mdash;   and the new brown-skinned honcho will undoubtedly give it to them, too. But if they happen to get the idea in their fizzing religious-maniac brains that the American leader is one of the dreaded apostates, that may send the self-described &#8220;slaves of Allah&#8221; into turbo-jihad the moment the US govt or military does something they don&rsquo;t agree with. </p>
<p>This is why an Obama presidency would truly be the worst of all possible worlds. An unmitigated disaster; a &#8220;perfect storm&#8221; of awfulness both foreign and domestic. And perhaps even a blow to the body politic of our fair republic from which we might never fully recover. It makes me slightly queasy even thinking about it long enough to type these few words to AmRen. </p>
<p>Vote NO on BO!<br/>

			<p>Let&rsquo;s hope they don&rsquo;t decide he&rsquo;s an EX-Muslim, or one who&rsquo;s renounced the Muslim faith. They kill backsliders, and that&rsquo;s just what we DON&rsquo;T need, some whack-job Muslim fanatic assasinating Mr. Obama. Because in the turmoil and confusion there will be too many conspiracy theories and rioting &#8220;&#8216;gainst ol&rsquo; racissss Whitey&#8221;&hellip; Thousands of people will die  &mdash;  White people, men, women, children, babies  &mdash;  all racisssists of course.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Mainstream Muslims tend to tiptoe around this topic. An Egyptian supporter of Obama, Yasser Khalil, reports that many Muslims react &ldquo;with bewilderment and curiosity&rdquo; when Obama is described as a Muslim apostate; Josie Delap and Robert Lane Greene of the Economist even claim that the Obama-as-apostate theme &ldquo;has been notably absent&rdquo; among Arabic-language columnists and editorialists.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Arab world naturally scants this issue because overtly discussing Obama&rsquo;s apostasy would certainly serve as a clarion call for the American electorate to waken from its stupor. If voters were aware of the concessions that could be wrung from Obama in lieu of being slain, he could hardly be the candidate best suited to deal with a Middle Eastern conflagration and, with a stroke, another pillar of his campaign is toppled. Apostate Obama is shoddy material from which to construct a bridge of goodwill between America and Dar el Islam. So it is no wonder that both Muslims and libs are overlooking this rather integral  aspect of his religious status.   </p>

Actually, &#8220;reports&#8221; say nothing of the kind.  Instead, when polled, over half of Americans say that Obama either is, or was in the recent past, a muslim.</p>

<p>This is what I expect is going to happen in America in any case, but ultimately the enemy will discover that, as I said before, whites are very,very good at genocide when we put our mind to it and no longer need fear being PC. Weapons are our friends, get them while we  can.</p>

<p>Amen!  Absolutely no question about it.</p>
<p>He even has a following of demons in the likes of Louis Farrakhan and Jeremiah Wright, along with Ayres and the other extremist haters on his campaign staff.</p>
<p>Can anybody watch and listen to the black talking heads on television defend all the anti-white rhetoric of these people and not feel his hackles rise, as if one were observing the incarnation of evil itself?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but blinking red lights and alarm bells ringing seem to be everywhere in connection with this man, AND his wife.</p>

<p>A lot of folks have been thinking the same thing for quite awhile now. I&rsquo;m in the process of creating a table comparing both Obama and McCain to the fictional <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolae_Carpathia" rel="nofollow">Nicolae Carpathia</a>. So far BHO leads in the Antichrist sweepstakes, but never count out a RINO like McCain.</p>

			<p>Brother &#8220;Robert Kelly&#8221; you hit the nail on the head as usual. I enjoy reading your posts. We need to focus our energy on the enemy within- -White liberals. They are the ones that have brought all this misery on us, not the non-Whites. You really can&rsquo;t blame non-Whites for taking advantage of gullible people. Every time I watch an Obama rally I find myself not looking at him, but looking at the faces of the Whites cheering him on. When I see an Obama bumper sticker on a car, I speed up so I can see the face of the people that hate this country and themselves.</p>

			<p>In this country we used to hear &#8220;once a Catholic, always a Catholic&#8221;.  This was certainly true in the eyes of Roman Catholics in those days, although not of someone who may have been baptized RC in infancy and had been raised as Protestants.</p>
<p>In the eyes of most Muslims, Barack Obama is an apostate Muslim, who will probably return to the Muslim Faith as soon as the election is over, now that he has broken with Trinity UCC.</p>

<p>&gt; Idiots&hellip;. Why do you even care to worry about politics and the future of the White race if you really believe we are in the &#8220;End Times&#8221; as interpreted from the NT Book of Revelations?  If you REALLY believe that nonsense, then stop carping and start celebrating - your day of deliverance is near!</p>

			<p>There&rsquo;s a lot about this guy that isn&rsquo;t 100 percent transparent.  Therefore, he shouldn&rsquo;t be president.  I can&rsquo;t understand why out of 300 million people we can&rsquo;t find someone we can have full confidence in.</p>

Oh?  I never heard that.  And I used to be a Catholic.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re right, Whiteplight.  But you&rsquo;re too kind. While you consider them idiots,  I consider them insane&hellip; and of no help to us at all..</p>
<p>BTW, what toes the Antichrist look and small like?</p>

<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t the son of the Devil be more suave and sophisticated instead of being a bumbling idiot who can&rsquo;t speak without a teleprompter?  If he truly were the Antichrist wouldn&rsquo;t most people be deceived?</p>

			<p>Christianity is the &#8216;brand&rsquo; of white Europe. It is featured on the flags of Britain, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Finland and Denmark. </p>
<p>It would matter little to me if all whites switched from Christianity to Nordic paganism as the new brand, as long as the brand is tied to race and values.</p>
<p>No wonder some thing Obama looks out of place as a Christian.  There is historic reasons for that.</p>

<p><br/>
You&rsquo;ve made an interesting observation.  I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if, at some point, there will be demands from the growing Moslem &#8220;minorities&#8221; to have those flags and symbols changed. It&rsquo;s a matter of time.  No surprise at all. It&rsquo;s inevitable. It&rsquo;s coming. </p>
<p>And those demands will be granted, the same as all their other demands have been.</p>
