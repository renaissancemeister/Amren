						<p>A professor who said he suspects UCLA is cheating to illegally admit black students resigned Thursday from its admissions committee, saying the university refused to provide him the data he needs to investigate his suspicions.</p>
<p>&#8220;A growing body of evidence strongly suggests that UCLA is cheating on admissions,&#8221; political science Professor Tim Groseclose wrote in a report he released Thursday. &#8220;Specifically, applicants often reveal their own race on the essay portion of the application.&#8221;</p>
<p>Campus officials deny the accusations and say they&rsquo;re following the law. Privacy concerns prevented the university from giving Groseclose the data he wanted, officials said.</p>
<p>One of the most sought-after campuses in the United States, University of California, Los Angeles has been banned since before Proposition 209 from using race as an admissions criteria, along with other state public universities.</p>
<p>Students typically report their race on their applications, but the people who evaluate their files don&rsquo;t see names, race or ethnicity. If race does come up in an application essay, it&rsquo;s supposed to be ignored, said Janina Montero, vice chancellor for student affairs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Campus officials have been under intense pressure to increase numbers of black students, particularly since a 2006 public outcry over the fact that only 96 of the nearly 5,000 freshmen who enrolled at the prestigious campus were African American.</p>
<p>This year, 235 black freshmen plan to enroll for the fall term, about 5 percent of the freshman class and more than double the 2006 number.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s circumstantial evidence to suggest some back door racial preferences are going on,&#8221; Groseclose said.</p>
<p>The professor, who holds an endowed chair and has a background in statistical analysis, said he wasn&rsquo;t resigning from the Committee on Undergraduate Admissions and Relations with Schools over that issue, but because campus officials refused to provide him with the information he wanted to analyze the admissions.</p>
<p>Gloseclose said he wanted to use statistical analysis to study the probability that students were being admitted by race. He asked for 1,000 student files, including essays, with the names removed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gloseclose said he actually favors the idea of offering preferences to bring in more black students, but he is unhappy at what he calls a &#8220;lack of transparency&#8221; in the process.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Groseclose said that, at the same time black enrollments went up, low-income Vietnamese enrollments went down.</p>
<p>Low-income Vietnamese applicants are typically among the most disadvantaged, he said, because few had parents who attended college and they often overcome grave hardships to enroll.</p>
<p>UCLA figures showed Vietnamese admissions dipped from 270 in 2006 to 207 for the coming fall.</p>

The fact that the number admitted went from 96 to 235 makes it pretty &#8220;transparent&#8221; that something is going on. There is probably some kind of conspiracy, which Tim Groseclose isn&rsquo;t in on.  </p>
<p>If his colleagues were innocent and honest, they would want to know the results of his analysis to find out what is happening.</p>

			<p>The controversy began when the SAT tests conceived to place an &#8220;essay&#8221; test in the required set of tests to qualify for college. For any college admission officer it is not &#8220;rocket<br>
science&#8221; to figure out which essays were written by African Americans. The grammar and syntax of the essay would point to someone of minority extraction so placing them in front of other<br>
more qualified applicants.<br>
   My Gloseclose &#8220;resigned&#8221; from his position on the acceptance committee.  Similar I am sure to Julius Ceasar &#8220;resigning&#8221; from the roman senate.</p>

			<p>Blacks are really a non-issue at UCLA, it&rsquo;s the asians.  I would rather send my kids to a predominately white school in the midwest rather than here.  There&rsquo;s a reason they call it UCLA-University of Caucasians Lost Among Asians.</p>

<p><br>
I would hardly call it &#8220;circumstantial&#8221;.  If you look at their reading and math and SAT scores, blacks should probably be admitted at about one-third of one percent of the student body to this level of academic institution.  There is massive racial discrimination occurring here - otherwise, it would be statistically impossible for blacks to be represented so far and above their objective qualifications.</p>

<p>Trouble is, if it&rsquo;s written in standard English with proper grammar &amp; punctuation, good spelling, etc., then the author obviously isn&rsquo;t black. Dead giveaway. I was able to translate the &#8220;Miranda warning&#8221; into &#8220;Ebonics&#8221; for fun, but I&rsquo;m sure I couldn&rsquo;t keep that up for an entire essay.</p>
<p>Of course, a student with sufficient motivation (and money) might be able to hire Barbara Billingsley as translator.</p>

			<p>Everything that our enemies can come up will be used against us. The &#8220;essay&#8221; portion of the SAT was created to benefit &#8220;aggrieved&#8221; groups. A dirty little secret is that if you can work into your essay that you are black, Asian, Latino, gay, Muslim, whatever group is deemed to have been &#8220;historically disadvantaged&#8221; you will receive extra points on your score. This is no exaggeration. Even some left leaning teachers have commented on this. You can bet more scams of this type will emerge, and there&rsquo;s a lot more cheating going on similar to what is happening at UCLA.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to see poor kids don&rsquo;t gain entrance to what they achieved. I imagine the son or daughter of my cleaning lady might be one of those kids.  The parents sacrificed even more.  They somehow came up with the money to put their kids into prep classes.  </p>

			<p>Wow, it&rsquo;s really refreshing and gives one hope that there are still Americans who have the type of integrity shown by Prof. Tim Groseclose. Though I don&rsquo;t agree with his attitude about why more blacks should be brought in, because he doesn&rsquo;t make it clear as to why he believes this. Inspite of their not being qualified? Lack of transparency has been an ongoing problem with the University&rsquo;s in this nation. I wish more professors would have the courage to put the university beurocrats on the spot.</p>

			<p> This so-called &#8220;resignation&#8221; sounds more like: &#8220;uh-oh, I tried to be a whistle blower and it backfired&hellip;oh geez, I&rsquo;m gonna be labled a racist&hellip;quick&hellip;get out now!&#8221;<br>
 Even if UCLA admitted to outright commiting this act, everyone would simply look the other way. In fact, the more publicity the better. When blacks and their handlers cheat, they&rsquo;re put on pedastals.<br>
 Everytime something like this happens, there&rsquo;s a chance that at least 2 or more upset 19 year-old college students will be mad enough to go out and vote Dem. Just to stick it to the man! After all, everyone&rsquo;s just racist!<br>
 Nov.4 is coming up! Plenty of time to keep that stealth campaign going!</p>

			<p>Aside from low S.A.T. schools for most blacks and hispanics - which may be compensated for by the new essay section - the reality is that most blacks and hispanics graduating from public schools are reading at two, three or more grade levels below white students. In fact, a high percentage are reading at sixth, seventh or eighth grade level when graduating.</p>
<p>Obviously this means that the whole university curriculum is going to have to be &#8220;dumbed down&#8221;, and it&rsquo;s a process that&rsquo;s been going on for a long time. As far as economics, This is part of the steady movement of the United States towards Third World status, and all of this is affecting the political process as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;The times, they are a changing.&#8221;</p>

			<p>I say&hellip;.smaller colleges are much better&hellip;you have a better class of professors&hellip;.and&hellip;not many blacks want to go where the crime rate is so low&hellip;cause it&rsquo;s easy to pick them out in a line up&hellip;.plus&hellip;classes are not in an uproar because blacks do  disrupt classes (in college as well as in schools) and the ones who want to learn can&rsquo;t even hear the lessons above their constant chatter about nonesense. In big colleges&hellip;.this happens very very often and they get away with it.  And&hellip;..your daughters are safer on smaller campus&rsquo;&hellip;.any other questions?</p>

			<p>I think Margaret pointed out it might be a good idea to change your child&rsquo;s last name to a Hispanic sounding one. Then there was the lady who posted on AmRen saying she couldn&rsquo;t even get an interview until she simply put something like &#8216;african american&rsquo; on the form - if statistics aren&rsquo;t enough. There&rsquo;s no measure they are unwilling to take, or lie they are unwilling propagate (to the detriment of all?), in making sure disadvantaged youths find &#8216;equality&rsquo;.</p>
<p>No word on what they&rsquo;re doing about choice area&rsquo;s whites find themselves locked out of. Such as at minority owned firms, heavily populated minority regions, or minority cities which quickly pass &#8216;residency requirement&rsquo; laws as a requirement to apply there, or at historically black or majority black colleges, or even trying to get a job with the federal government, where at some departments, minorities are as much as 600% overrepresented and where at 16 out of 17 government departments, whites are underrepresented.   </p>

			<p>It doesn&rsquo;t do much good to cheat, pull strings, bend over backwards to get black students admitted, because in the end, if they&rsquo;re being admitted because they&rsquo;re black rather than because they have the academic excellence to succeed, they&rsquo;ll fail and drop out.  Which is what blacks do in large numbers at most  educational institutions. Problem is, a lot of blacks are raised in environments where they don&rsquo;t learn how to learn. Lesson one: if student isn&rsquo;t interested in learning, send student home from school to be better prepared by parents.  If parents are unable to do that, remove child from that home and place in foster home with caring parents.  </p>

			<p>No surprise here.  Anyone who lives in California or Arizona well knows that race-based (and gender-based) affirmative action is even stronger than before.  It&rsquo;s just better-concealed.  Unfortunately, Band-Aids like Proposition 209 will do nothing to help Western civilization in North America.  Until Whites wake up and confront the demographic crisis facing us  &mdash;   our coming minority status by 2025  &mdash;   nothing else will save our civilization here.</p>

			<p>I will guarantee that any university/college across the country will find a way to admit and keep a black if they show promising athletic ability. The institutions will hire private tutiors, furnish them with free living quarters, a Chrysler 300 or SUV and a weak minded white girl in an effort to applease them. If all else fails, they will lean on the professors to give them passing grades by giving the blacks easier tests or even falsifying the grades. That&rsquo;s the sad state of affairs that black athletes have brought to our schools. They possess little or no smarts proving everything regarding achademic ability among black athletes in one huge fraud. This is why you see so very few black college athletes giving non-scripted pre/post game television interviews. If they were to do so they would shoot thier foot off with their mouths and the truth would become apparent to all.</p>

			<p><i>I think Margaret pointed out it might be a good idea to change your child&rsquo;s last name to a Hispanic sounding one</i></p>
<p>At a CofCC National Conference several years ago, one of our activists from Arkansas, who has a last name that might be mistaken for Hispanic, said that his daughter (who has that same last name), got tons and tons of offers for free scholarships and grants for college.  When the inevitable interviews came, those offers were rescinded, every last one of them.  He got one of the people associated with one of the offers that they made the offer assuming that his daughter was Hispanic.</p>

			<p>Perhaps an alternative would be to have topics for student essays that are race neutral and that any mention of an author&rsquo;s race would be grounds for immediate disqualification. </p>
<p>Secondly, a professional grading association, unconnected with the University could be hired to grade the essays. </p>
<p>Third, grammar counts. This thing about overlooking proper subject verb agreement, tense, mood, syntax, and inappropriate colloquialisms (know what I be saying &hellip; feel me) needs to have a concrete scale that the grader can&rsquo;t deviate from. </p>
<p>Every graduate, to one degree or another, represents the institution from which he or she has been graduated. Irrespective of either a person&rsquo;s skin, or how well the prospective student can play a particular sport, should never be the fundamental consideration as to whether or not THAT student has the opportunity to attend THAT school. </p>
<p>This whole concept of affirmative action is nothing less than a legal fiction, and is a type of discrimination that blatantly disregards the fourteenth amendment of due process. Like most things that deal with race in this country, the whole concept of equity and fairness to whitey is totally disregarded when it comes to propping up blackie.        </p>
<p>Finally, I am convinced that the essay portions on professional examinations are geared to identifying blackie as well! But the whole process will continue as long as whitey allows it! </p>

			<p>Question Diversity, the same thing happened to my sister years ago when they mistook her for an American Indian. Why I can&rsquo;t imagine, but she got so many offers it was almost funny. Free tuition, car, housing, etc. But just as in your post, when the interview came, all offers went up in the smoke of affirmative action and her not qualifying as one of its darlings. Thank you, traitorous liberal progressives. She had to work her way through and was a straight A student to boot.</p>

<p>The University of Minnesota recruited a black quarterback (of course) who was so dumb he won&rsquo;t be starting this year because he didn&rsquo;t meet academic eligibility requirements. You really have to be as dumb as a rock not to meet athlete academic eligibility requirements when the rest of the team is already chock full of black illiterates!</p>
<p>I also noticed this on a very short segment of the olympics. One of the black women runners who got a gold was interviewed and she sounded like somebody in the ghetto being intereviewed by local news station reporting on a neighborhood shooting. I thought &#8216;This is what is representing us to the world?!&rsquo;</p>

<p>I clicked the link and observed figures there highlighting white dispossession. </p>
<p>I noticed the &#8216;racist&rsquo; comments too. A newspaper forum is not the same as AmRen. Some race realists would be a lot better off in these public forums if they just stuck to listing the facts instead of commenting on them. Anyone who can read is capable of drawing their own conclusion from the facts. Someone on the forum had to go on about how, with the growth of the minority population, America is doomed.</p>
<p>According to the facts, it is whites who are doomed. </p>
<p>To add to that at bit, where is the logic in insulting the very people you&rsquo;re trying to win over? How will That make easier the inevitable descent into oblivion?</p>
<p>What was potentially a forum that could elicit sympathy for whites and wake people up to a problem ended up instead being one where most of the focus was on  whites  behaving badly. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Ok to have feelings.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Ok to express them when they are hurt.  </p>

			<p>Of course they cheat. Universities exist to transfer wealth from Whites to the &#8220;underclass&#8221; and the &#8220;downtrodden&#8221;. They do this by giving preferential admission and free tuition to the &#8220;underclass&#8221; and the &#8220;downtrodden&#8221; and by making Whites pay full tuition.</p>

			<p>I agree with the several posters who have pointed out ways in which UCLA could easily determine if an applicant&rsquo;s essay contained any items to indicate he/she is a minority, especially the most favored minority, black.  However, the real issue is not whether or not they could to so, but rather whether they wish to do so and they clearly do not.  They are prisoners of their own distorted world view in which all races are equal in spite of all the evidence and it is their mission to overcome white preference (which is clearly not a reality) for the sake of an egalitarian utopia of their liking.</p>
<p>No one who has serious studied the issue of differences of intelligence between the races could possibly believe that they are equal.  As to the issue of so-called &#8220;white preference&#8221; in the US, I recommend that anyone who has the least suspicion that such is real, read a few pages of Richard Lynn&rsquo;s The Global Bell Curve.  In particular, pp. 10-11 where he refers to data from the original Bell Curve.  I will quote from Lynn so as to include the entire discussion which is short and compelling.</p>
<p>&#8220;These analyses were confined to men and were conducted for socioeconomic status by matching whites, blacks and Hispanics for IQ.  First, they took all of those with an IQ of 117 (the average IQ of those in SES I (socioeconomic status with class I being the highest and including &#8220;physicians, attorneys, chief executive officers, etc.), and looked at the percentages of those with IQ&rsquo;s of 117 who were in SES I.  They found that blacks with an IQ of 117 were much more likely than whites to be in SES I (26% as compared with 10%), and Hispanics with an IQ of 117 were also more likely than whites to be in SES I (16% as compared with 10%).&#8221;</p>
<p>What this very clearly demonstrates is that in the US there is a significant anti-white, pro-minority bias, which is very effective, especially when IQ is factored in.  If one fails to include IQ, the analysis is meaningless, since IQ is the major factor which determines socioeconomic success as well as success in school (when the cards are not unfairly stacked against one group).  UCLA is committed to admitting blacks with relatively low IQ&rsquo;s (relative to the white average for university students) who are likely to fail to graduate but whose acceptance will no doubt make their admissions data much more racially &#8220;representative&#8221;.  Of course this does neither most blacks nor any whites any good as most blacks admitted without adequate intelligence will do poorly and the places that they take could have been taken by whites who would have successfully graduated.</p>
<p>The basic problem is the counterfactual ideology of radical egalitarianism of most faculty members at so-called &#8220;elite&#8221; universities who see nothing wrong with race based preferences in admissions.  When the overwhelming majority of faculty and admissions officers at a school firmly believe that they are engaged in a moral crusade to reverse &#8220;decades of systematic oppression&#8221; by giving minorities preferential admission, one quickly sees the results at UCLA, Harvard, Princeton and down the line.  </p>
<p>The question to answer is how to change this mind set,  as it is based on lies, empirical errors, and a perverse elitist ideology and does significant social harm.  Working with such characters on a daily basis, I am impressed with just how resistant to reason and evidence they are and do not believe that they will change their views until such a change is required for them to maintain their positions.  Thus, one way to encourage fairness in admissions at large public universities would be to require it by law and to fire anyone who violates the law.  Your typical college professor may be a committed ideologue, but he/she is not very courageous and will cave in whenever his/her private interests are threatened.  The most radical tend to be the most cowardly.  If there is any hope of changing the current system, it should take advantage of this character defect.</p>

			<p>I agree with the post of 9:24 A.M. on Sept. 1st but think it might be good to take a historical look at how the dogma of racial egalitarianism took hold:</p>
<p>We are essentially in the &#8220;Dark Ages&#8221; when it comes to truths about average racial differences in intelligence among whites, blacks, hispanics coming out. Those of us who know the truth through having read and studied books like &#8220;The Bell Curve&#8221; or &#8220;Race and Reason&#8221; are in some ways like the monks of medieval times, trying to preserve basic knowledge during the times when &#8220;barbarian, liberal intellectuals&#8221; are in control of present day culture and society until such time as the majority of whites wake up to what&rsquo;s happening and why.</p>
<p>In the 1920&rsquo;s, writers like Lothrop Stoddard and Madison Grant had written books which pointed out the superior position of whites as far as I.Q. relative to certain other racial groups, but by the 1930&rsquo;s these ideas were excluded from acceptable academic debate when the Franz Boas school of Antrhopology took over Columbia University and established hegemony over all other institutions of higher learning. Those who controlled book publishing made sure that there was no further significant circulation of such ideas during the 1930&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Obvioulsly complicating honest debate as well in the 1930&rsquo;s was the long shadow of National Socialist ideology which made it easier to link any scientific investigation into racial differences in inherited intelligence as being tainted by Nazi doctrine. Following W.W.II, with information about the Holocaust coming out, the stage was set for an assault on the segregation laws of the South, which again could be negatively associated with the infamous Nurenburg Laws of Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>Following the Supreme Court decision of Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, along with the &#8220;Age of Aquarius&#8221; type of thinking of the Hippie period in the 1960&rsquo;s, there has continued to exist what I would call &#8220;the Dark Ages.&#8221; What various scholars and writers have done since this time, up until the present with Jared Taylor and writers associated with American Renaissance, is to try and keep alive the racial truths which have been suppressed and ignored since the Franz Boas school of Anthropology, and disciples like Margaret Mead, took over politically correct intellectual thinking regarding race.</p>
<p>In future times, when most whites are finally aware of and react politically to such knowledge, it will be seen how valuable it was for some brave souls to have pursued such knowledge in the face of the &#8220;barbarian intellectuals&#8221; of the times. </p>

			<p>The universities, all of them, including Hillsdale, are under the thumb of the feds. Ninety-five percent of all research is financed by the fedgov.  Challenge fedgov, you die.</p>
<p>The question is, who controls the fed?</p>
<p>As Ayn Rand put it- &#8220;It&rsquo;s enough to make a medieval enforcer of morality squirm with envy.&#8221; </p>
