						<p>When federal agents raided the offices of the Kaweah Indian Nation, Malcolm Webber told the arresting officer he had not committed fraud and was confused how he could be arrested on &ldquo;sovereign soil,&rdquo; court documents show.</p>
<p>Now, almost a year later, Webber must defend himself against charges that he and his so-called tribe defrauded immigrants by claiming that tribal membership conferred U.S. citizenship. He is scheduled to go to trial Tuesday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Webber, 70, of Bel Aire, also known as Grand Chief Thunderbird IV, is charged with two counts of harboring illegal immigrants, two counts of possession of false documents with intent to defraud the United States, two counts of conspiracy with intent to defraud the United States, one count of mail fraud and one count seeking criminal forfeiture.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Brent Anderson told the court that police seized $12,700 in cash from Orellana&rsquo;s home after finding Spanish-speaking people lined up outside it, waiting to buy tribal memberships for $600 each.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Prosecutors contend the Kaweah Indian Nation defrauded legal and illegal immigrants by claiming tribal membership conferred U.S. citizenship and would allow them to obtain other benefits and documents, such as Social Security cards. Prosecutors say the tribe is fake. But even if it were real, tribal membership would not make someone a U.S. citizen.</p>

			<p>Back in 1994, when I was young, dumb and full of multi-cult indoctrination, I took the Greyhound out to Lost Angeles, to be a star. There was an Indian sitting next to me on the bus. A big guy, reminded me of the Indian from the old &#8220;48 hours&#8221; movie. We had a few drinks together in Flagstaff, and we started talking about race and ancestory. I told him that my ancestory in the states was the Amish back in central Pennsylvania. He told me that the Amish were some of the few White people that he respects, because of the way they live off the land and respect nature. Then he gave me an ominous warning. He told California wasn&rsquo;t a safe place for a White person to be, that the Mexicans were going to take over California and kill all the White people there. He said that the Indians were planning on converging on Montana, and that there was an alliance between them that would give the Southwest to Mexicans and the Northwest to Indians. At the time I thought it was just the lunacy of a drunken Indian. </p>

			<p>Hispanics are quick to pick up on any fraud that appears because it is how they survive in Mexico where fraud has been the governmental style for maybe more than 100 years depending on how you wish to view history.  The personal injury &#8220;industry&#8221; is frequented by high numbers of injured immigrants, mostly Mexicans handled by attorneys and treated by doctors and therapists for unending months, citing outlandish claims, besmudging the real trauma-injury fields and bilking insurance companies out of millions over many years.  There was even a series of prostitution rings in Southern California that used licenses stolen/copied from the holders or the holders themselves that charged for prostitution and filed claims with insurance companies at the same time.  They got away with it for a while.</p>
<p>But in this case the government seems more upset about the fraud than the illegal immigrants.</p>

			<p>Hey Pinchegabacho, As a person of American Indian decent who is quit familiar with western USA Indian tribes that will be a sight to see when Montana is being taken over by 50 to 100 pound overweight hard core alcoholic Indians of which about 80% are.<br>
As for the Mexicans, it might happen if the White man does not stop it.</p>

			<p>California is already lost.  One need only look at the current population statistics and especially at those for children between the ages of 5 and 10 registered in &#8220;US&#8221; schools there.  What this article illustrates best is the gullibility of the illegals who thought they could gain US citizenship by becoming members of a sovereign Indian tribe.  If the tribe were sovereign, they would not be part of the US, so membership in the tribe would not confer US citizenship any more than it would confer French, Italian, or any other national citizenship.  This is just one more indication of the low level of intelligence of our current illegals.</p>
<p>As for Montana being taken over by native Indians is concerned, I would not worry too much.  The reservation, alcohol and the federal welfare system have pretty much destroyed any remnants of the once proud Indian tribes.  They would have trouble robbing a liquor store now, much less conquering a state such as Montana(I suggest that it they must, they pick a state in the NorthEast like New York or Teddy Kenedy&rsquo;s home state  &mdash;  some state where the inhabitants are overwhelmingly liberal and not allowed to own firearms and would not know how to use them if they were).</p>
