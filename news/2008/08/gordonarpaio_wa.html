						<p>Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon&rsquo;s recent trip to Washington included a visit to the office of U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey to ask that Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio&rsquo;s &#8220;recent actions be reviewed.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gordon alleges that Arpaio has disregarded the constitutional rights of legal citizens by performing racial profiling.</p>
<p>On April 4, Gordon addressed a letter to Mukasey accusing Arpaio&rsquo;s office of a racially motivated stop and citation against city employee Jessica Rodriguez and her husband during a traffic stop near Bartlett Lake. David was issued a $120 citation when he drove around a sign signaling closed roads after heavy rains had washed out the roads in the area.</p>
<p>Arpaio&rsquo;s office countered that an investigation into the incident turned up no evidence of racial profiling. The sheriff&rsquo;s office said the complaining witness was a passenger in the vehicle and was not cited.</p>
<p>Recently, some business owners have accused Arpaio of knocking on their doors and asking to see employees&rsquo; work papers in his hunt for illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Wednesday Gordon invited the national media to Phoenix to see Arpaio&rsquo;s policies on illegal immigrants.<br>

			<p>Phoenix readers: Time to let Mayor Gordon know he will be looking for another job come the next election. The August AR cover story, &#8220;What Can I Do?&#8221; should motivate you to organize &amp; throw this rascal out of office. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Gordon alleges that Arpaio has disregarded the constitutional rights of legal citizens by performing racial profiling.&#8221;</p>
<p>So this cowardly Red goon Gordon is seeking to turn the Federal leviathan loose on one of the few decent white public officials left in this country, Sheriff Joe Arpaio. And all in the name of &#8220;tolerance,&#8221; I am sure.</p>
<p>Well, since Phoenix is in Maricopa County the good Sheriff ought to instruct a few of his deputies to keep this Red schweinhund under constant surveillance; sooner or later, they will likely catch him doing something illegal like: going to prostitutes, buying drugs, or driving drunk. Then they can throw his treacherous &#8220;white&#8221; hide into the pokey, and mock him for being reverse racially &#8220;profiled.&#8221; Or better still, toss him into a cell full of illegal aliens and watch the fun.</p>
<p>That would be good for laughs to be sure, and if he got too mouthy about his &#8220;rights&#8221; they could give him a face full pepper spray and shut him up.</p>
<p>Enough Said!</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m a former resident of Arizona, and the sad truth is that the state, much like its neighbors California and New Mexico, has become a Third World wasteland which gets worse every year  &mdash;   much as I respected Sheriff Arpaio for at least some of his efforts, the truth is he&rsquo;s merely sticking a finger in a dam that&rsquo;s already bursting from dozens of cracks.  It&rsquo;s not just illegal immigration, though Arizona is indeed the national headquarters for this crisis  &mdash;   the *legal* immigration levels in Arizona have overwhelmed all of the state&rsquo;s most basic services.  And when you also factor in the fact that any child born on the Arizona side of the border is a citizen, you can see the handwriting on the wall.  If you&rsquo;ve ever peeked into an Arizona classroom (as I did when picking up my daughter early from the school nurse&rsquo;s office), you&rsquo;d be hard-pressed to find more than a couple white faces in most of the classes.  That&rsquo;s the future of the state. </p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s not millions of cheap workers from Mexico or Guatemala, it&rsquo;s hordes of cheap-labor Indians brought in on the H1-B visa program, who have utterly ruined Arizona&rsquo;s once-fledgling but thriving high-tech industry, much as they&rsquo;ve also done in California.  And it&rsquo;s only about to get much, much worse.  Despite the brave efforts of the state legislature, Governor Janet Napolitano has frustrated every effort to address the massive demographic disaster in Arizona  &mdash;   anything addressing legal or illegal immigration alike.  She and her office, assisted by corrupt courts and local officials, have thwarted all attempts to introduce even commonsense legislation.  This year and subsequent election years, sadly, are only going to push the state even more into an anti-White direction, just like California, sadly enough.  </p>
<p>Almost half the White families in my old neighborhood in Arizona have moved out of the state.  A handful have even joined the trickle leaving the country  &mdash;   one now living in northern Italy, another in Germany if I recall correctly (ancestral connections probably).  With the same process overtaking California and New Mexico, the whole region is becoming a little mirror image of Central America.</p>

			<p>Sheriff Joe - Just stop that racial profiling! Don&rsquo;t you know you must not single out Hispanics crossing our southern border. Just set your sights on those illegal Norwegians and Swedes. And, look, there goes an Eskimo. Uh, oh, I just saw a group of little Irish and German ladies make a run for it. So, now that you know who&rsquo;s coming, you can really do your job.</p>

			<p>What constitutional rights do illegal have? By virtue of the fact that they have no legal basis for being here (sneaking in doesn&rsquo;t constitute), they have no rights.<br>
They may, however, go to Mexico and demand &#8216;rights&rsquo;, and Mayor Gordo (not a typo) is certainly welcome to go with them.<br>
When it comes to taking action, whether it be law enforcement, military, social ills, whatever, nothing ever degrades a situation as much as having politicians stick their noses in it.</p>

<p>  Your excellent post has confirmed what I already believed that greater Mexico, or the Reconquista is well underway in the Southwest. During the next half century, this area will return to Mexico, and whites won&rsquo;t even notice. <br>

			<p> Gordon is campaigning&hellip;pure and simple. Getting everyone and anyone to vote Lib&hellip;it&rsquo;s their last desparate act. Osama has NO chance of winning. Everyone knows that. Especially in AZ. Where McCain is from.<br>
 And because of the last TOO MANY years of an unlikeable, do-nothing Governor, AZ is finally turning back to the conservatives they once used to be famous for.<br>
 So by all means&hellip;QUICK&hellip;play the race card as many times as possible before November! Just remember&hellip;Gordon is the MAYOR&hellip;nothing more. He doesn&rsquo;t work for living, he can&rsquo;t be actually held responsible when things go bad in the city.<br>
 He&rsquo;s just like his cowardly, liberal counter-part, the Governor. Blame everyone else, name call and finally the race card. The media eats it up. What a better way for a politician to get free airtime!<br>
 When crime goes up in a city, you can&rsquo;t blame the Mayor. Well, not anymore. Normally, a Mayor would NEVER down play ANY Law Enforcement. Not even County, as in this case. But race cards have now become the weapon of choice.<br>
 Illegal Criminal crimes have sky-rocketed in Phoenix in the last 10 years. Everyone knows that. Well, who&rsquo;s in charge of Municipal Policing&hellip;that&rsquo;s right, the Mayor. So what happens when citizens start to realize that it&rsquo;s his responsibility?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right&hellip;blame someone else&hellip;the Liberal credo.</p>
<p> And while you&rsquo;re at, just to be on the safe side, play a GIANT race card. Just to confuse the stupid (who might now vote Lib just out of anger) and scare a few Conservatives who were about to raise their hand.<br>
 They keep spouting out about how it&rsquo;s going to be a &#8220;record&#8221; turn out of voters in AZ. Somehow, I doubt that. Since they always say that just to get people to actually go out and vote. Once again, liberal&rsquo;s are overestimating your run-of-the-mill minority.<br>
 Gordon is no different than traitors such as Michael Moore four years ago. Bashing America actully made people go out and vote for Bush just because they were angry at the sniveling liberals. Even though they didn&rsquo;t really want to.<br>
 But then, that really is the classic liberal folly. Bitterness doesn&rsquo;t get you far, though.<br>
 I know this post doesn&rsquo;t come as any surprise to this sites loyal readers. I saw Gordon on TWO seperate news shows spouting the same tired garbage. So I just wanted to set the record straight&hellip;also to inform any younger viewers of how greaseball, liberal politics work.<br>
 Lowlife Gordon was and IS simply campaigning&hellip;nothing more. Don&rsquo;t fall for it.</p>
