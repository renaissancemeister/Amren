<p>One of the toughest questions on any poll is whether people are telling the truth. It is a conundrum that looms front and center as voters look ahead to the first U.S. presidential contest that an African-American candidate has a chance to win. With polls showing overwhelming voter support for the idea of a black president, researchers and pollsters are trying to determine who really means it.</p>
<p>Peter Hart, a Democrat on a bipartisan team conducting the Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, estimates that 10% of current Democrats and independents who say they support presumed Democratic Party nominee Barack Obama may not be giving a fully honest answer, at least based on their responses to broader questions about race. &ldquo;This election is exceptionally tricky,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>While most political pollsters say they don&rsquo;t find large numbers of people lying on polls, they are taking extra precautions. At CBS, pollster Kathleen A. Frankovic says she will ask voters whether they think most people they know would vote for a black candidate &mdash; an indirect way to fish for racial bias. John Zogby, president of the polling firm Zogby International, is asking white respondents whether they have ever been to a dinner party where a black person was present. It only takes a handful of people hiding their true opinion to skew poll results, he says: &ldquo;A small number can loom large.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At ABC News, polling director Gary Langer says the network is noting the race of the phone interviewer for the first time in its presidential polls. The idea is to see whether the questioner&rsquo;s race could have an effect on responses by voters. (Though respondents don&rsquo;t know the race of the interviewer, they might try to guess based on the interviewer&rsquo;s voice.) All the responses are combined to create a big picture that can show if, for example, white voters tend to tell white interviewers one thing and African-American interviewers another. So far, Mr. Langer says, the race of the interviewer doesn&rsquo;t appear to have an effect.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>Pollsters look for the &ldquo;Bradley Effect,&rdquo; the idea that some white voters are reluctant to say they support a white candidate over a black candidate. The phrase refers to California&rsquo;s 1982 gubernatorial election, when the late Tom Bradley, a black Democratic mayor of Los Angeles, led in exit polls against white Republican George Deukmejian. Mr. Bradley lost the election. The conclusion: some voters hid their true choice from pollsters. Skeptics say the issue was neither race nor honesty. One theory is that Mr. Deukmejian&rsquo;s supporters simply didn&rsquo;t want to participate in polls.</p>
<p></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p></p>
<p>Questions about polling and race were raised during this year&rsquo;s presidential primaries. In New Hampshire, polls gave Sen. Obama as much as a 10-percentage-point advantage over Hillary Clinton the day before the primary. Sen. Clinton went on to win the state. Pollster Andrew Kohut, president of the Pew Research Center, doesn&rsquo;t blame lying. Instead, he says, some voters who were poorer, less-educated and white may have had less favorable views of African-Americans and were less likely to take surveys. &ldquo;When polls get it wrong, it&rsquo;s not because people lied, it&rsquo;s because the people who turned down the polls have different attitudes than the people who took the polls,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>It may turn out that hidden prejudices don&rsquo;t significantly affect the outcome of this election. Even so, researchers working on the National Election Studies are drafting extra questions to spot racial bias. The federally funded election studies have been conducted every four years since pollsters got the Dewey-Truman presidential race wrong in 1948. For the November election, researchers are preparing a survey with about 50% more questions on race than in 2004, says Arthur Lupia, a University of Michigan professor and one of the studies&rsquo; chief investigators. Many of the questions are aimed at gauging the so-called social desirability bias &mdash; a widely studied phenomenon in which people change their answers because they are too embarrassed to say how they really feel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For us not to go for it and ask, &lsquo;Look, is it race or not?&rsquo; there&rsquo;d be massive disappointment in our study,&rdquo; says Dr. Lupia. He plans to include a question asking whether a white or black candidate would be better suited to deal with foreign-policy problems. The answers, matched up with information on respondents&rsquo; race, whether they voted and whom they reported voting for, can help analysts determine the extent to which people&rsquo;s feelings about race affected their votes in the presidential election &mdash; even if they say race wasn&rsquo;t a factor.</p>

			<p>The voters know that their selection of a white conservative over a black liberal will forever brand them as &#8220;racist&#8221;. Why would a voter own up to their true feelings when voter know the pollsters are minions of the liberal press. </p>

			<p>You can&rsquo;t have it both ways.  You can&rsquo;t grievously punish, ostracize, condemn and stigmatize white people for speaking honestly about race, and then be flummoxed whether they&rsquo;re telling you what they really think when you poll those same white people about race.</p>

			<p>If you conduct your polls like some kind of witchhunt, asking probing questions about my associates and operating under the assumption that I&rsquo;m racist if I don&rsquo;t vote for him, I&rsquo;m going to lie too.  Go Obama/Farakhaan!!!!  That&rsquo;s the ticket, baby.  </p>

			<p>Ahhhhhh&hellip;. the thought police in action. Basicly, Obama is only half black, he is defined as a mulatto, I doubt white America would put in a total &#8220;black&#8221; guy. Obama was raised by whites, so he doesn&rsquo;t come off any smarmier than your average mulatto who is raised by the white mother after the black father abandons them. But he does have the smarmy attitude thing, he gets that from his dad. They used to be called &#8216;uppity&rsquo; blacks. I doubt he can hide it well, but the media sure helps him out with it.</p>

This election is exceptionally tricky, alright   &mdash;   but not in ways that either liberal MSM Obamaniacs or WSJ race-denying neo-conservatoids could EVER be made to understand. </p>
<p>Only 10% of whites lying about voting for the Magic Mulatto? I&rsquo;d wager that the truth is a higher figure than that. <br>

			<p>  I for one don&rsquo;t understand why people feel they have to lie about voting for or against a political candidate. So Barack Obama is black   &mdash;   or sort of black, anyway   &mdash;   and you prefer to vote for John McCain. If you&rsquo;re White, does that automatically make you a &#8220;racist,&#8221; or a &#8220;bigot&#8221;? Why don&rsquo;t they ever publish how the percentage of black votes for a black candidate jibes with the percentage of blacks polled who said they would vote for him?</p>
<p>  It really is amazing how these pollsters can imply, if they don&rsquo;t come right out and say it, that 90+ percent of blacks voting for a black candidate is   &mdash;   well, what is it? &#8220;Racial pride&#8221;? But if 90 percent of Whites voted for a White candidate when his opponent was black, they&rsquo;d say we were &#8220;racist.&#8221;</p>

			<p>In 2006 when Michigan was allowed to vote on Affirmative Action, polls, including exit polls predicted a very close vote, and maybe a defeat of the measure repealing Affirmative Action.  In the end the result was 58 percent for repealing, and 42 percent in favor of keeping Affirmative Action.  16 percentage points is big by any measure, boardering on a landslide.  That was just 2 years ago, obviously someone was giving the politically correct answers, but when along in that booth, voted the way they really felt.  I strongly suspect, as do many others, that obama&rsquo;s narrow lead over McCain (usually within the margin of error) is illusionary, and that McCain is actually ahead at this point.  I also suspect that starting in late September we will see the reappearance of Wright, Phleger, Ludicris, and others run together with obama&rsquo;s own words from his books on tape.  There will also be more revelations about those with whom he&rsquo;s chosen to surround himself with, that will make him very unattractive to white working class voters.  There is also the very cagy non-answer obama gave regarding reparations.  If the white working class hands obama the election, they will be in for the mugging of a life time, because all obama&rsquo;s &#8220;programs&#8221; instead of &#8220;reparations&#8221; will be borne on the back of the white working class.</p>

			<p>Polls are a useful tool for the media to help manipulate the vote. I wonder how elections would turn out if the politically ignorant masses, actually had to make up their own minds, based on knowledge of the candidates. The most ignorant of statements is, &#8220;Be sure to vote it is your obligation&#8221;, when in fact most people vote for the most assinine of reasons, and absolutely should not vote. As I have often stated, your vote counts the same as the village idiot! So, no wonder things are as they are. </p>

			<p>I am willing to bet MOST of those Whites claiming to like Obama and being willing to VOTE FOR OBAMA   &mdash;   will vote AGAINST OBAMA in November. The man has nothing to offer other than his Black skin. No real ideas. No worthwhile solutions. And sure to flip-flop as the occasion demands!!! </p>
<p>In fact, instead of thinking of him as PHONY OBAMA&hellip; I may start calling him FLIP-FLOP OBAMA! </p>
<p>Does this guy have any REAL CONVICTIONS? I mean other than acquiescing to twenty years of hateful anti-White rhetporic by his best friend, family confidante and preacher.</p>

			<p>Are they going to take a poll to see if race plays a part in the 90%-plus support for Obama by blacks???? I got one of those pollsters calls acouple weeks ago and had no problem telling them the reasons I would&rsquo;nt be voting for Obama, him being black being one of them. I added- - &#8220;when blacks elect a White mayor of Detroit and White presidents in Africa, I might change my mind!&#8221;</p>

			<p>As more of Obama&rsquo;s rhetorical history and information on his  social/business/political associations continue to ooze out into the light of the mainstream media day more people will be emboldened to simply say they just think he&rsquo;s a whole lot sleazier and frightening as a policy maker than John McCain could ever be and that&rsquo;s the end of this polling interview period.</p>

			<p>The WSJ has essentially admitted that the Bradley Effect still exists, and that it is about 10% for Obama-McCain.  Meaning that if Obama doesn&rsquo;t have at least an 11% lead in the polls near election day, the popular vote in reality will be tied, and McCain will win the Electoral College because a lot of Obama&rsquo;s votes are clumped in already blue states and black voters in the very red South.</p>
<p>There has been a school of thought that the Bradley Effect has disappeared.  The talking heads want us to think that, because they want us to think that Obama&rsquo;s lead in the polls is real.</p>

			<p>I thought this was a joke at first but this could really be interesting. What if Obama goes into the election with a significant lead in the polls and still loses? After all the controversy over the last elections we could have some serious riots on our hands.  Blacks are never going to believe that the white man didn&rsquo;t stick it to them.</p>

			<p>We live in a time where it is practically a felony to think incorrect thoughts. If you dont sing the praises of multiculturalism, minorities, and how thrilling it is to have your country overtaken by thirdworld parasites who loathe whites, then you can be ruined. And these genius&rsquo;s think its possible that whites would smile while being polled and claim support for obama and then vote for mccain? How long have these journalists been journalists? All day?</p>
<p>This is why I have to disagree with Jared for the first time in forever. obama seems to stick his foot in his mouth quite often. We also seem to hear more and more about his socialist views as November gets closer. Add to that the Bradley/Wilder Effect and I have to disagree with you Mr Taylor. I cant see obama winning this November. In fact I cant even see it being close. That is unless the ILLEGAL &#8220;&#8221;ALIEN** (NOT IMMIGRANT!!)loving Mccain self destructs. </p>

			<p>This sort of article is so weird. We&rsquo;ve got the press, solid Cultural Marxists who are ready to humiliate anyone for having politically incorrect beliefs, and then we&rsquo;ve got anonymous pollsters whose job requires that they disclose their discoveries to the press. When the polls come out wrong everybody scratches their heads. If any confused journalists or pollsters are reading this I&rsquo;ll make it simple: Ordinary Americans don&rsquo;t want to publicly whipped for not adopting your mores. They don&rsquo;t want their soundbyte edited so they look stupid, and then followed by commentary that calls them names.</p>
<p>The people who make television call all the shots. And they shoot voters whose votes push politics in inconvenient directions.<br>

			<p>They&rsquo;re doing two notable things here.  First, they are comparing apples to oranges.  Supporting a black candidate for president does not necessarily equate to an automatic acceptance of a Socialist such as Barack Obama.  And secondly, they are setting the stage to use white racism as the excuse for his pending, poor showing in the presidential election.  People love a winner and the media has been working overtime trying to portray Obama as such.  Eventually they will have to disclose the truth regarding his actual approval ratings and when they do, deception by evil white liars are an easy target to blame.  Its much more convenient than telling the truth and admitting that they have been exaggerating his national support all along.</p>

			<p>There are so many information seeking polls, so many tests for acceptable attitude, there is now even a test to determine if you are unconsciously racist.  I heard a program on NPR last week (I sample everything) where a psychologist guest explained the test for a &#8220;bigoted brain,&#8221; it was quite disturbing to listen to this guest and the host speak in depth about how we may now be able to determine indirectly - without any specific questions - whether the subject is racist or given to &#8220;bigotry&#8221; in any way.  The callers were pathetic, and all whites, who thought they had eliminated any form of bigotry or racism from their consciousness.  Now here is a test that shows them how incomplete their purging really has been.  One caller admitted his racism after taking the test even though as he explained, his family was already well along in miscegenation.  </p>
<p>However, it is the idea that our ideas and thoughts now might be subject to monitoring without our even being aware of it.  More tools in Big Brother&rsquo;s (or Big Sister&rsquo;s) box!</p>

			<p>Ever wonder why you just can&rsquo;t buy into the blacks are great fad?  Andrew Kohut has the answer.  You&rsquo;re poor, stupid, and white.  </p>
<p>&ldquo;Pollster Andrew Kohut, president of the Pew Research Center&hellip; says, some voters who were poorer, less-educated and white may have had less favorable views of African-Americans&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Want to get rich?  Be white.  Get more education.  Then get a more favorable view of African Americans.<br>

When asked, black will tell you with a straight face that the only reason they&rsquo;re voting for Obama is because he&rsquo;s most qualified. It has nothing to do with race.</p>

<p>No doubt Obama is about to implode, however McCain must offer a competent alternative and thus far he has failed to deliver. </p>

I have a deep conviction that there are many other White people who feel as I do, but when the curtain is pulled in that voting booth, the truth will out, and people will hold their noses and vote McCain.

<p>I venture to say that such whites, because of their social status, are forced to have closer interactions with blacks, and therefore have a better knowledge of the black &#8220;culture&#8221;.  In other words, they have more experience on which to base their opinions.</p>

			<p>I would vote for Obama if I was a US citizen (I&rsquo;m British), and wouldn&rsquo;t feel the need to hide my reasons for doing so. I think whites will have a lot to gain from both the pros and cons of having Obama in the White House. On the one hand, I agree with several of his political measures, such as ending US involvment in Iraq and providing universal free healthcare. These alone are good enough reasons to choose Mr Obama over Mr McCain.</p>
<p>However I also feel that some of the perceived dangers of having Obama - or indeed any black candidate - as president would in fact be highly desirable. A black president may be a humiliating symbol of disposession, but would help to undercut the cries of deliberate or institutional &#8216;racism&rsquo; from the establishment that currently serve to excuse black failure. If the head of the political establishment is black, the ignorant let&rsquo;s-blame-everyone-but-ourselves rhetoric about discrimination against blacks that we hear from bigots like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton will sound as moronic and absurd as it really is.</p>
<p>Having a black president is the best step we can take towards highlighting the basic fact of racial inequality; until then the Left will still be able to play its wild card of &#8216;racism&rsquo; to excuse the fact that blacks are poorer, less academically successful and more likely to be incarcerated than whites. It is the surest way to releive Liberals of their prejudices and false assumptions, and another four years with a white president would only be delaying America&rsquo;s - and thus the World&rsquo;s - acceptance of the universal truth of racial inequality.</p>

			<p>Before the elction in 1996, between Clinton and Dole, the polls were showing Clinton a 15 to 18 point favorite.  A call-in T.V. network I watched had some experts as guests on polls.  I phoned in and asked how these polls were supposed to work in their analysis, because, I added, they seemed to me to be far from &#8220;scientific,&#8221; which is always the claim.</p>
<p>The learned guest&rsquo;s answer was that a lot of &#8220;smart&#8221; people spent a lot of time analyzing the data and that they were very accurate.  The &#8220;expert&#8221; obviously didn&rsquo;t know the intricacies used for computing poll data either, because he couldn&rsquo;t answer the question.  This business of alleging that something is above question because a lot of &#8220;smart people&#8221; claim authenticity to me is just plain ignorant, as almost every serious problem we encounter in this country is the result of some very &#8220;smart people&#8221; who have screwed up somehow, and usually always, when their reason and methodology is laid out they reveal that much of what they contend is just plain wrong.</p>
<p>Poll data is proving to be the same as everything else, at least as far as I&rsquo;m concerned.</p>
<p>As it turned out, the 1996 election was divided in Clinton&rsquo;s favor, 49 something to 40 something, about an 8+ point difference, a far cry from the 15 to 18 points predicted by the propagandists.  There were a couple of polls that came closer, but I really believe it was just luck.  They didn&rsquo;t know either.</p>
<p>As a businessman, there&rsquo;s no way I would rely on polls consisting of phoning 1000 prospective voters throughout the country to base a business decision on.  I just don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s possible to get much more than an educated guess when conducting polls, which is a far cry from the disingenuous 3% plus or minus factored in for error.</p>
<p>Polls, I believe, can give us, as I said, an educated guess, but that&rsquo;s all they can do.  Besides not being as accurate as they claim, I&rsquo;m pretty sure polls will help the leading candidate somewhat by encouraging suporters to vote while discouraging those for the underdog to refrain from casting what they might believe is a useless ballot.</p>
<p>These talking heads on the news shows are so silly as to consider a candidate ahead or behind on a mere 3 or 4 points, as if what they&rsquo;re dealing with are actual election figures.  It&rsquo;s really a disgusting influence and something should be done about it to discredit these poll takers.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a good explanation.</p>

			<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;re doing two notable things here. First, they are comparing apples to oranges. Supporting a black candidate for president does not necessarily equate to an automatic acceptance of a Socialist such as Barack Obama.&#8221; &hellip;</p>

<p>What would be interesting and telling is if Republicans put forth a black (not mulatto) conservative candidate.  What would the media then do?  How would Blacks vote?  How would whites vote?  What would the liberals cry?</p>
<p>The answer is that the media would still try to shoot down the black Republican, and the Left would play along. But they&rsquo;d have to invent some pretty awkward rationalizations.<br>

			<p>Does any white sentient being in this nation give a rat&rsquo;s patooty if a wild-eyed liberal calls them a racist?  Where is it written that harboring an aversion towards one race or another is inherently wrong?  If it isn&rsquo;t in the Constitution (and it isn&rsquo;t) or the Bible (and it isn&rsquo;t) it all comes down to someone&rsquo;s personal opinion.  Since the Book of Political Correctness was written by communists it is totally without merit or substance. No one tells this man what to think or say unless they are looking for a fight&hellip; <br>

			<p>Ignore the polls, they&rsquo;re nothing but propaganda. If the MSM don&rsquo;t get the result they want, they&rsquo;ll invent it.</p>
<p>My favorite example happened 13 years ago in Brevard County (Florida), where the school board tried to cram a 9-figure bond issue down the taxpayers&rsquo; throats. About a week before the referendum, the county&rsquo;s leftist rag trumpeted a poll it had done that showed 48% in favor and 40% opposed. &#8220;VOTERS LEAN TOWARD BOND,&#8221; the headline screamed. The actual vote: <b>3 to 1 against!</b></p>
<p>Friends, there&rsquo;s simply no way an honest poll could be that grossly wrong. Nor is it possible that enough people could have lied to get that result. No way to prove it, of course, but IMHO the published poll was an intentional fabrication intended to influence the outcome. A letter to the editor sarcastically asked, &#8220;Who did you guys poll, the teachers&rsquo; union? Was (the superintendent) helping with the phones?&#8221; The writer was probably more right than he realized! The paper likely conducted an honest poll, saw the overwhelming opposition, and trashed it.</p>
<p>As for the 1948 election, everything I&rsquo;ve read (including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Truman#Election_of_1948" rel="nofollow"> this</a>) contends Dewey skated the last few weeks because he   &mdash;   and the pollsters   &mdash;   thought the race was in the bag, which allowed Truman&rsquo;s &#8220;whistlestop&#8221; campaign to work.</p>

<p>Getting us OUT of Iraq?  Not only is he NOT going to get us out of Iraq, he&rsquo;s going to get us IN Iran.</p>
<p>Both Candidates were pre-selected for this very reason. In one sense having a 46 year old run against a 72 year old is more than enough to convince me that the whole thing is bought and paid for and has been for a long, long time.  Probably since Woodrow Wilson.  But now, it&rsquo;s getting blatant. In fact, for me, the real significance of the 2008 Presidential Race is that it&rsquo;s the first one where the Power Elite didn&rsquo;t even try to hide what it was doing.  </p>
<p>But James, seriously, the only thing Obama is going to do is - what he is told to do. The first two things Obama did after clinching the election was go straight to both AIPAC and La Raza.</p>

			<p>It should come as no surprise that people will lie to pollsters. As another poster alluded to, saying or doing one politically incorrect thing can cause one to lose their job and create significant financial hardships. In this Information Age we live in, everything is traceable in one form or another. It&rsquo;s no wonder that people will lie to them, when if a person commenting on a poll were to become public and someone were to recognize their voice, it could come and bite their behinds in a heart beat. It&rsquo;s that type of issue that causes me, an occasional poster on this site, to post anonymously; to minimize the likelihood I get branded with a big scarlet R.</p>

<p>I mean, unless you were the kind who wore t-shirts or put bumper stickers on your car fender, it was kind of a matter of privacy.  Perhaps implied more than stated, but still, a matter that was no one elses business unless you CHOSE to make it their business.</p>
<p>Now we have people - who you KNOW are campaigning for Obama - actually calling you on the phone to ask you who you are going to vote for!!!!!  Obviously it&rsquo;s to see if they can guilt trip you into voting for him.  How sordid.</p>
<p>In any event, as I&rsquo;ve said before, the number one thing to know about our time in History is that the Power Elite is pulling all the stops.  <br>
No authority has ever wanted its machinations exposed. But the Internet has come along, much like Toto in the Wizard of Oz, and pulled the curtain.  They simply can not hide now, know it, and are getting more and more obvious and obtrusive and controlling.  Obviously the rest is up, not to them, but, to us.</p>

<p>Exactly. Something to keep in mind next time you hear some liberal troll demand voting machines print out a &#8220;paper trail&#8221; for the voter to keep. They&rsquo;re not interested in preventing fraud, they&rsquo;re interested in violently crushing all opposition (&#8220;Your voting paper, please.&#8221;).</p>
<p>I forgot to mention in my previous post that pollsters have contacted me by phone at home several times. I always hang up on them without saying a word, and I strongly urge everyone here to do the same. </p>

			<p>Speaking of Obama, why is he giving a speech today in Indiana of all places?  Since his nomination, traditional blue states like Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota are now up for grabs.  Pennsylvania will most certainly vote for McCain and probably New Hampshire. He probably shouldn&rsquo;t wasting his time in the South either.  </p>

			<p>This country got by for hundreds of years without integration, interracial marriages, gay marriage, massive non-white immigration and a non-white and non-male president.  Why do we suddenly need to change things now?</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Instead, he says, some voters who were poorer, less-educated and white may have had less favorable views of African-Americans and were less likely to take surveys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The idiot has it backwards.  Whites with unfavorable views of &#8220;African-Americans&#8221; are more likely to be socially ostracized, under- or unemployed, excluded from receiving a college education, and less likely to vote. </p>
