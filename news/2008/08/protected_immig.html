<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>An immigrant suspected of being in the United States illegally &mdash; freed after being shielded from possible deportation by San Francisco officials despite committing two gang-related assaults as a juvenile &mdash; faces charges that he tried to stab a man to death last year in San Mateo County, authorities say.</p>
<p>The case of Eric Antonio Uc-Cahun, now 19, a native of Mexico, is the second in which a youthful offender protected from deportation in San Francisco has later been arrested for a violent crime as an adult.</p>
<p>The San Mateo County stabbing was especially vicious, authorities said &mdash; a top prosecutor said the victim had been &#8220;gutted, like you gut a pig.&#8221;</p>
<p>Uc-Cahun&rsquo;s history of youth offenses in the city was similar to that of Edwin Ramos, a 21-year-old Salvadoran native facing triple-murder charges in connection with the slayings in June of a San Francisco man and two of his sons on an Excelsior district street.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Both Uc-Cahun and Ramos were in San Francisco&rsquo;s juvenile justice system at least twice during Mayor Gavin Newsom&rsquo;s time in office, Ramos for an assault and an attempted robbery he committed when he was 17, Uc-Cahun in connection with assaults and other crimes for which he was arrested in 2006.</p>
<p>Juvenile justice officials protected both Ramos and Uc-Cahun from federal authorities under their interpretation of San Francisco&rsquo;s sanctuary law, which bars the city from cooperating in U.S. efforts to hunt down illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>However, City Attorney Dennis Herrera&rsquo;s office concluded last month that nothing in the law prevented San Francisco from turning over suspected youth felons to federal immigration authorities. Newsom has since ordered juvenile justice officials to provide information on felons suspected of being illegal immigrants to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.</p>
<p>Since the policy change, more than 50 juvenile offenders have been referred to federal immigration officials, according to juvenile probation authorities.</p>
<p><b>Arrest as an adult</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Uc-Cahun was arrested in September 2007 and has been held without bail since. In March, following a preliminary hearing, a judge ordered Uc-Cahun to stand trial.</p>
<p>The victim, whom The Chronicle is not identifying at the request of prosecutors, testified at a preliminary hearing that, &#8220;I pulled up my shirt and I seen my guts were hanging out of my stomach.</p>
<p>&#8220;My friends wanted to get them back,&#8221; he said, but &#8220;all I did was lay down, (and say) &lsquo;Man, take me to the hospital.&rsquo; &#8220;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Joseph Russoniello, the U.S. attorney for Northern California] said the arrests of Uc-Cahun and Ramos raise the question of whether other juvenile offenders who were kept from deportation in San Francisco went on to become criminal suspects as adults.</p>
<p>&#8220;These attacks demonstrate that these people are acting with impunity because they have little to fear,&#8221; Russoniello said.</p>
<p>Ballard said officials are conducting a &#8220;top to bottom&#8221; review of practices under the sanctuary city ordinance to make sure San Francisco is complying with federal and state laws related to immigrant felony offenders.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are complex questions,&#8221; Ballard said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s not just one ordinance, it&rsquo;s many, many years, going back to 1985, of policies made in many ways. There&rsquo;s a lot of excavation to be done.&#8221;<br>

<p>There should be nothing complex about it - leave it to politicians to take a simple matter and turn it into a &#8220;complex matter&#8221;.</p>

			<p>I still maintain that most of our elected officals have sold white Americans down the tubes in regards to illegals. I do think that those who advocate rights for illegals or offer them sanctuary need to be arrested for treason. Nothing against Latino people at all, it&rsquo;s just because they are here illegally that angers me. On the other hand, I very much hold respect for them because mostly they work hard and upgrade the neighborhoods they have reclaimed from the blacks. Most of the whites I know have much respect for the Latinos and none for the blacks for obvious reasons.</p>

			<p>I only hope that no more innocent people like the Bologna family, what is left of it, are harmed by the people who are in charge of San Francisco. I hope the people who enable the illegality and lawlessness are the victims. It&rsquo;s only fair.  </p>

<p>&hellip;&#8221;They also have lots of beautiful women.&#8221;  &mdash;    True, however in statistical terms the typical border jumping Mexican/Honduran/Salvadoran female is not a prime demographic group for scouting out Miss Universe candidates. </p>
<p>Good looking Latin women are much more abundant in Costa Rica, Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay. Venezuela has long been ultra competitive in the international feminine beauty arena.</p>

			<p>Calling an illegal alien an &#8220;immigrant&#8221;, which he is not, is deeply offensive to immigrants. He is a member of class of proctected criminals who happened to be invaders as well.</p>
<p>Absurdities like this are logical consequences of Liberal ideology (and any other socialist-type ideology). I wonder how anyone at his right mind can ever vote for a Liberal?</p>
<p>Here is a classic example of Liberal false promises.</p>
<p>Ted Kennedy, regrattable a U.S. Senator, said this at the passing of the Immigration  and Naturalization Act of 1965:</p>
<p>&#8220;What the bill will not do: First, our cities will not be flooded with a million immigrants annually. Under the proposed bill, the present level of immigration remains substantially the same. [&hellip;] Secondly, the ethnic mix of this country will not be upset. [&hellip;] Contrary to the charges in some quarters, S. 500 will not inundate America with immigrants from any one country or area [&hellip;].&#8221;</p>
<p>That was then when whites consituted about 90% of U.S. population.</p>
<p>Now, as a result of that 100% Liberal bill, the &#8220;Latino&#8221; population is booming (non-white Hispanics are the only major genetic group in the U.S. that reproduces above the replacement level), and is expected to push the population of whites down below 50% in about four decades. And if that trends continues, &#8220;Latinos&#8221; will become U.S. majority before the end of this century.</p>
<p>Whatever paradise the Liberals (or other socialist-like ideologues) promise you, it won&rsquo;t happen. It never had. Period.</p>
<p>The only things that are sure to materialize are &#8220;irregularities&#8221; (&#8220;pathologies&#8221; seems much more adequate a descriptor) like the one described in the article above.<br>

It is We who need Sanctuary, not them. We create wildlife preserves for animals, but let hostile habitats destroy entire cultures and environs.   </p>

			<p>I do hope the Americans (citizens and legal immigrants) victimized can receive whatever justice possible from San Francisco for its practice of settling juvenile illegal alien criminals in the surrounding area.</p>
<p>Needed is a full audit of the San Francisco juvenile justice system to root out all illegals starting with the violent ones.</p>
<p>Methinks the 50 names reported to BICE are just the tip of the iceberg; a sop intended to take off the heat till next year when the Open Borders Lobby have a better chance to impose their &#8220;comprehensive immigration reforms&#8221; which certainly will include some form amnesty for millions of currently illegal aliens and expedited family reunification for the amnestied ones.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget Juan McCain is every bit as much in favor of open borders as Obamanation; the principal difference is McCain claims he&rsquo;ll enforce the border. </p>
<p>I am positive McCain will happily ask for an INA2009 he can sign, which will effectively do away with the USMexico border.</p>
<p><br>
And while Ted Kennedy is a great whipping boy and the #1 reason we should have term limits of 4 for the House and 2 for the Senate, please do drill down into the origins of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 (Hart-Celler Act, INS Act of 1965, Abomination of &#8216;65) to find out its true authors. Ted Kennedy was merely its front man.<br>
Besides, the Chappaquiddick Kid isn&rsquo;t going to be in Washington much longer (thank goodness). Current Mass. Governor Deval Patrick is waiting in the wings to take his place.</p>
<p>I really think the wannabe Immigration and Naturalization Act of 2009 is intended be Teddy&rsquo;s memorial.<br>

			<p>I made my first trip to San Francisco last June and was impressed by the beauty of the city. It is one of the most beautiful cities I&rsquo;ve seen and that includes some of the European cities I&rsquo;ve visited. It&rsquo;s a shame that it&rsquo;s in the control of such a bunch of ultra liberal schmucks! They won&rsquo;t deport illegals but they, for all practical purposes, have served notice on the NAvy that it isn&rsquo;t welcome in SF.</p>
<p>Newsome really needs to be recalled and sent packing to Detroit, Gary, South Orange or Camden.</p>

<p>They (latinos) also have plenty of fat and ugly women too.</p>
<p>And besides the plentiful of fat and ugly White Women, there are plenty of beautiful ones too.  I am one of them.  I&rsquo;ll send you a picture to prove it.  </p>
<p>Also, the same (Ugly, Fat and Beautiful) applies to every race and applies to Men too!</p>

			<p>Stabbing?? It was described more like a &#8220;gutting&#8221;? Newspapers, who have always followed a strategy of sensational headlines to sell papers, somehow never do so when a &#8220;minority&#8221; or some other person belonging to a group they seek to protect is involved. Then thye wonder why sales are radically down. How about reporting outrageous, violent crimes for what they are, regardless of who is involved?</p>
