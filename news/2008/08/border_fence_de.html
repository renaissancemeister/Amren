<h1><a href="http://www6.comcast.net/articles/news-national/20080825/Border.Fence.Floods/">Border Fence Design Blasted As Causing Flooding</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, August 25, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Environmentalists say flooding caused by a new border security fence in southwestern Arizona shows the structure is being built too quickly and without regard for the environment.</p>
<p>Critics say the design of the border fence caused debris and water backup during a July 12 storm that led to flooding at the port of entry at Lukeville and Sonoyta, Mexico, and at the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Environmental groups have criticized the manner in which the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and contractors for federal agencies have designed and built a range of fencing and vehicle barriers at various points along the Arizona-Mexico border.</p>
<p>In particular, they&rsquo;ve denounced Homeland Defense Secretary Michael Chertoff&rsquo;s waiver of environmental laws to hasten construction as the Bush administration pushes to complete 670 miles of fences and other barriers by year&rsquo;s end along the nearly 2,000-mile Mexican border.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Critics have said the design of the pedestrian fencing being put in on the Arizona border is flawed. Much of that fencing consists of 10-foot wide and 15-foot tall steel-mesh panels, some featuring a series of wide horizontal grates at the bottom designed to let water and sediment flow through.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Federal officials maintain that while Chertoff has invoked his waiver authority three times in Arizona, he has ordered Customs and Border Protection and Border Patrol officials to adhere to environmental requirements.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Organ Pipe monument&rsquo;s staff produced a report earlier this month on the pedestrian fence&rsquo;s effect on the 330,000-acre monument&rsquo;s drainage systems and infrastructure.</p>
<p>It concluded that the fence failed to meet hydrologic performance standards of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or standards set by the U.S. Border Patrol&rsquo;s final environmental assessment for the project.</p>
<p>That assessment determined that the 5.2-mile pedestrian fence would have no significant impact on the monument&rsquo;s environmental features.</p>
<p>But the recent monument report said its own staff had raised concerns last year over the fence-building plans, based on knowledge of local flash flooding.</p>
<p>The July 12 storm dumped as much as 2 inches of rain in about 90 minutes in the area, and water running through washes on the monument backed up as debris piled along the base of the fence.</p>
<p>It created pools up to seven feet deep and flows several hundred feet wide that eroded some areas along patrol roads. The waters even scoured some fence and vehicle barrier foundations.</p>

			<p>  environmentalists are the cause of all the wildfires that burn so property. they are the very ones that opposed burning off the under brush that causes big fires. environmentalists cause more harm than any good.</p>

			<p>So-called &#8220;environmentalists&#8221; just get me, they scream about &#8220;urban sprawl&#8221; and the &#8220;footprint&#8221; the human race is leaving on this planet. But, then in the same breath they complain that the US is enforcing it&rsquo;s immigration laws against the massive invasion of people who shouldn&rsquo;t be here in the first place. Where do all these so-called &#8220;environmentalists&#8221; think all these illegal aliens are going to live? No doubt not with them or anywhere near them. These whiners are not &#8220;environmentalists&#8221; at all, but leftwingers using the environment to push their agendas,i.e. the destruction of America. If they were really concerned about the environment they would be on board with controlling the boarders and making sure human smuggling and destroying the desert where put to an end.</p>

			<p>How often are there flash floods? Can&rsquo;t the debris be cleaned up so it wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem? I&rsquo;m happy to hear they are even building fences&hellip;</p>

			<p>One of the sharpest criticisms of the environmental movement declares that environmentalism is, first-and-foremost, just a mercenary repositioning of the old socialist and liberal political movements. And one fact that supports this criticism is the environmentalist position on population which is, to say it plainly, no position at all.</p>
<p>As third world populations rush to fill every nook and cranny of their undeveloped nations with new life, they undermine their economic development and create political instability – the kind of instability that is often solved by autocrats or popular collectivist politicians who spread the wealth, giving every household enough extra mammon to make a few more babies. Looking for relief from instability and revolution, many of these governments encourage their surplus population to leave. Immigration becomes a safety valve that allows nations – that would otherwise implode - to continue their exponential birthrates.</p>
<p>We all know where these third world types go – they go to any developed nations that have immigration policies that will admit them, or who otherwise lack the resolve to keep them out. Europe and the United States have been enduring an unprecedented invasion of third world immigrants. Accepting these new citizens has changed the face of many countries and America has seen its population increase by half since 1965.</p>
<p>As people pour into America, America changes. Housing developments are erected continually, cities sprawl and suburbs crawl into the country. Cars and public transportation need more pavement, and that means more energy and more waste. Wild habitats and altered or destroyed. Species are pressured to extinction or weakened by the off-gassing, the leaching, and the spilling of poison that comes with the advance of humanity.</p>
<p>Despite this reality the environmental movement will not say a negative word about immigration, and this is because environmentalism is – as a tool in the big political game – a means of empowering people with a particular political viewpoint. It is a way for government types who want greater control over private land and private citizenry, to justify their intrusions and write new laws that mean more revenue and more ways to wrest what little independence many small landowners still have.</p>
<p>When the environmentalist movement becomes even-handed, when it stands against mass immigration and demands that the third world face and conquer its overpopulation problem, then it will have a chance of saving the human race. But until then, it will just be the fashionable preoccupation for a lot of college students in 90 dollar sandals, and the tool of American liberalism.<br>

			<p>These &#8220;upset environmentalists&#8221; are watermelons: green on the outside, red on the inside.</p>
<p>Somehow, they are only outraged when someting obstructs their red agenda, this time to &#8220;diversify&#8221; the U.S. by leting millions of leftist would-be revolutionaries into this country. But I am still waiting for their outrage with devastation to the environment that mass illegal border crossing causes in Texas, Arizona, and California.<br>

			<p>Water damage is at least natural; the environmentalists should be all for it.  On the other hand, the thousands of tons of garbage the illegals leave on wilderness land every year as they illegally cross the border is anything but natural.</p>
<p>If water is a problem, the Corps of Engineers can simply dig deep ditches for storm water runoff.  If deep enough and properly placed, these might act as a disincentive to tunneling efforts.</p>

			<p>Let them taste their own medicine.</p>
<p>They blame flooding on the border fence? Call them <b>anti-water nuts</b>.</p>
<p>(They absurdly call &#8220;anti-immigrant&#8221; all those who advocate the enforcement of the American border and immigration laws.)<br>

			<p>Environmentalists remain silent on illegal immigration because George Soros paid off Greenpeace to do so.  Or was it one of the other radical environmentalist groups?  I&rsquo;m sure someone remembers that which I am referring to.  Help me out here.</p>

			<p>Cop, you&rsquo;re thinking of the Sierra Club, which took a $100 million donation from David Gelbaum, who told them that if they spoke out against immigration, there would be no more money.</p>
