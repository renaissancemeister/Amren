						<p>It goes without saying that the saddest element in the current enforcement of immigration laws is the apprehension, deportation or abandonment of children.</p>
<p>Stories surface every day of parents who were apprehended and fearing the same for their children, say nothing about their children at home. They hope a relative or neighbor will eventually realize their children are alone and will take care of them until they can be reunited.</p>
<p>According to a new report released this week in Mexico City by the Population, Border and Migrant Affairs Commission, for every three adults deported from the United States there is one child abandoned and left behind.</p>
<p>But what is even more shocking and deserves further scrutiny from Congress and the American people is the documentation in the report that cites how in the first 7 months of the year the United States has deported 90,000 children to Mexico &mdash; children without their parents and who are alone.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has elected to disregard the safety and welfare of these children in the name of immigration enforcement.</p>
<p>The Mexican report revealed that 15 percent or 13,500 of these children, of all ages under 17, find themselves &#8220;parked&#8221; at the border. With no family and no way to take care of themselves. Some are either taken in by social service and religious agencies or are forced to live on the streets begging and trying with all their might to get back into the United States, or worse, are victimized by human traffickers who sexually exploit them.</p>
<p>The report further revealed that these child deportations are having a huge impact on those sectors of the country experiencing high migration and the Mexican government reveals it&rsquo;s ill-equipped to keep up with the growing number of children dumped by the U.S. government.</p>
<p>The report&rsquo;s authors are calling on the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. government to honor children&rsquo;s rights and to repatriate the children versus deporting them. With repatriation, the children are not left abandoned but are returned into the custody of those responsible to take care of them.</p>
<p>Deportations merely drop them off without ensuring their safety.</p>
<p>While this report highlights the shortfalls of the Mexican government in providing substantial care for these children upon their arrival, at the same time it does not exonerate the actions of the U.S. government.</p>
<p>For that reason, child deportations should be halted until a full and consistent repatriation program can be implemented where children are delivered to family members or reunited with family in the United States.<br>

<p>How is &#8220;repatriation&#8221; any different than &#8220;deportation?&#8221;  But, in this sense, I think they mean &#8220;repatriating&#8221; the children with their families, who are presumed to be in the U.S.  Thus, &#8220;repatriation&#8221; means amnesty.</p>

			<p>Well Marisa Treviño of Latina Lista, you&rsquo;re right- children should be taken better care of- and it is sad. You know what else is sad? American children and adults who are abused <br>
(non)sexually by illegal aliens in thousands(annually). If only US immigration did not put white children at risk by allowing hispanics to drive drunk at disportionally high rates in comparison to drivers of other races, form violent gangs and in general engage in unsocial violent activities.</p>
<p>This whole article is strange.-Why would immigration patrols dump children on the boarder but not the parents/guardian? Children are not simply scooped up and planted in the middle of a desert. The reporter is too vague or incompetent or both.</p>
<p>AND EVERYONE AT AMREN- attached to the original article are dazed people commenting on how wonderful the world will be with non-whites pursecuting us. Take a look at the first comments and observe how angry some can get!</p>

			<p>The United States does NOT have to baby sit these kids. Period. If their parents are so concerned about them, why don&rsquo;t they obey the laws to begin with and live &amp; work in the United States legally?</p>

<p>Are these the Latino family values our politicians are so pround of?</p>
<p><i>With no family and no way to take care of themselves.

<p>I can only assume most illegals know the consequences of their actions. How could they ever leave their children behind knowing this might happen?</p>

			<p>The only people to blame here are the horrible excuses for parents that these children are saddled with.<br>
So they abandon their children in the hopes that a neighbor or relative will &#8220;find them&#8221;?  They take that risk that the children may never be found, go hungry, become frightened, risk injury because they are unsupervised, and become filthy.</p>
<p>These illegal parents are not thinking of the welfare of their children, they never do.  Not when they drag them across the border, entrust them to cyotes, raise them in a country where they can never have a real future, or abandon them in Mexico.  They are only thing that they are concerned with is themselves  &mdash;  period!!</p>
<p>If they truly loved their children, they would stay in Mexico and build a decent country for their children  &mdash;  or emigrate somewhere legally.</p>

<p>This is the fault of the parents. NO good parent would abandon their children by leaving them alone if they are deported. This article is nothing more than propaganda, a sympathy ploy for illegal migration. These parents shouldn&rsquo;t have come here illegally in the first place. If caught, they should take their children with them. If they don&rsquo;t, that is THEIR fault. If they&rsquo;d stay home, they wouldn&rsquo;t have this problem.</p>

			<p>I read the responses on the &#8220;Latina Lista&#8221; article. One of the responses listed was an article called &#8220;The Fears of White People&#8221; written by Robert Jensen, a self-hating white man who laments his evil race and how wonderful it will if non-whites are the majority. It&rsquo;s whites like Robert Jensen that are out biggest enemy.</p>

<p>This article is bogus. Unless they are leaving toddlers completely alone all day with no supervision. As lax as they are about caring for their children, I don&rsquo;t think they are that irresponsible. </p>

<p>Besides, if the roles were reversed they wouldn&rsquo;t care about the age of any illegal deported from their lands, they&rsquo;d just be glad to be rid of them.</p>

<p>Mexico is guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity.  They are using children as a weapon of war against the US.</p>
<p>The US should ask itself how best to stop this.  Stop deportations?  No.  That will only force other types of human tradgedies&hellip;.mostly on our own citizens rather than on the hostile alien invaders.</p>
<p>The best, most effective way to solve the problem is to stop the migration of people from Mexico.  The US should seal its border with Mexico.  No visas should be issued.  No immigration of any kind should be allowed.  Mexico has abused this to such an extent that clearly, they cannot be trusted to allow any sort of close contact with them at all.  Our border should be walled off with a fence and sufficient manpower should be put in place to reduce immigration to zero.</p>
<p>It will happen, sooner rather than later, I think.  Mexico is increasingly hostile and unstable.  Because of corruption, it has long allowed a narco-terrorist element to have its way with the US.  But, they&rsquo;ve grown so powerful from this that they will finally displace the Mexican government as the ruling authority (actually, in much of Mexico, they already have).  Extremely violent and with the idea that they can annex a large chunk of the US through force of arms, the US response, once the shooting starts, is predictable.  The liberals in Congress will attempt to prevent that but will find themselves kicked out of office over it.  The Mexicans already here in the US will be lucky if they aren&rsquo;t rounded up, stripped of citizenship and marched south at gunpoint.</p>
<p>And to those of you who think it can&rsquo;t happen, it HAS happened, twice in recent US history.  It will happene again&hellip;.and for the same reasons.</p>
<p>The US swings back and forth to extremes of liberalism and nationalism.  For quite some time now, the pendulum has been swinging away from liberalism.</p>

			<p>One of the saddest parts of illegal is when heartless parents enter the U.S.illegally bringing their kids with them.This is child abuse of the first degree.As a first offense the offending parents should be sentenced to six months at hard labor plus an extra month for each illegal child abused.  The children would be returned to the country of origon.A second offense would be five years.Coming to America to hatch an anchor baby would be a felony and everyone deported.Lawyers and judges who defend illegals should be held personally resonsible for crimes illegals commit upon release.These measures may sound harsh to those infected with the political correctness virus but there are few alternatives if we are to save our terminally ill republic.</p>

			<p>US government is not responsibile for children of illegals! It is bad enough Gov has to take care of irresponsible parents in USA! It appears a growing portion of the population believes the government is their parents. Immigrant children(under 5 yrs) are found wondering around all the time.  In my neighborhood and at work the immigrant children do not speak English, have no dicipline and parents pay them little attention.    The have children without responsibility or concern for their welfare.  Many countries sponsor children/families. USA is rapidly leaving its independence behind and following the socialist path to dependency and destruction.  V</p>

<p><br>
Well, what&rsquo;s &#8220;saddest&#8221; is a subjective, isn&rsquo;t it? Saddest, perhaps, if you are someone with a first name like Marisa or a surname like Treviño. (As I always say about the news items on AR: check the author&rsquo;s byline and consider the source.) </p>
<p>But for those of us who have to live with the social degradation, the economic devolution, and the GENUINE PHYSICAL DANGER that comes from being UTTERLY SURROUNDED by illiterate peasants from some foreign country, &#8220;the saddest element in the current enforcement of immigration laws&#8221; is that those laws AREN&rsquo;T ENFORCED NEARLY ENOUGH.<br>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t believe it.  I had personal knowledge of the treatment of juveniles by ICE and BP for a few years, up until about 2 years ago.  When Wackenhut was contracted for alien transportation.  Many children were put into the care of Health and Human Services, housed and educated in non-secure facilities. Couldn&rsquo;t lock the poor things up.  So they walk away.  If they were returned to Mexico or any other country, the foreign consulate was involved, period.  The Consul accepted the minors.  If there was someone claiming the children it was up to the Consul to verify the bonafides.  If the Consul took them to their country and just turned them loose, on their own, well, is that the fault of the US Gov&rsquo;t?</p>

			<p>Sad?  WHY?  Their illegal presence in America would simply add to the already $90 billion the arrivals from Mexico cost our taxpayers. I got into an argument on a local blog site run by one of the Houston TV stations. Natch, a Mexican-American got real offended because I told him the MAJORITY of illegals were either living off our taxpayers, or thieves, OR BOTH!</p>
<p>Of course he called me a racist for resenting the illegals. The money they cost us, the crimes they commit once here. I pointed out those same reasons were why all over the country towns are trying every legal remedy to drive the unwanted away.</p>
<p>I had been view some of the Olympics, and am unshakably convinced the Chinese are blatant racists in their own right</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty skeptical of this and not convinced that it can account for 90,000 kids deported in just seven months.  As bad as the illegals are, I don&rsquo;t think they would abandon their kids like that for such a strange reason.  I imagine that in most cases, they would tell the authorities that they have kids and would ask that they be sent with them back to Mexico.</p>

			<p>Put up the fence and help save these children from a life of crime and poverty that their own parents brought them into. How can mexican parents put their own children in harms way. Such child neglect will stop if the US Government puts up the fence along the border, all the way from the Gulf in Texas to the Pacific Ocean in California. Put up the fence now, in the name of God we have to stop this child neglect and abuse caused by their own parents.<br>

			<p>The &#8220;Self Deportation Program&#8221; is designed to prevent this very situation where kids are left hanging. Self Deportation allows the Illegal parent 3 months to handle all affairs (including their own children&rsquo;s affairs) and then get sent back to Mexico neat and orderly. How simple can we make it. </p>
<p>(what happened to the good ole days when they were rounded up, trucked back and that was the end of the story)</p>

			<p>I think this article is bogus.  I do not believe 90,000 Mexicans have been deported in history, let alone that many children.  Regardless, if Mexican parents care more about their illegal status, then their children, then they deserve anything they reap.  I remember hearing a story about an illegal couple that wouldn&rsquo;t take their very ill child to the Dr. for fear of being deported.  The child, after suffering quite a bit, died of a very treatable condition.</p>

<p>Mexican cities are full of such lost beings, and it has nothing to do with our deportations and everything to do with their  culture of corruption. When it spills across the border we rightly send them back. So, Marisa, ask me if I care.</p>
<p>Forget Russia and the invasion of Georgia, we&rsquo;ve got a far more proximate and dangerous threat at home. Build the wall and close the border. Expel their diplomats and close all their McConsulates. Terminate all relations with the real enemy, Mexico.</p>

			<p>Sorry &#8220;SKIP&#8221; but it seems some text got inadvertently deleted. My comment was that an Olympic event for &#8216;border jumping&rsquo; and another for welfare check requesting should have been included in the scheduled events. Kindly draw your own conclusions.</p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s a PRACTICAL idea&hellip; get out of Afghnistan. Get out of Iraq. Forget the insanity of a war with Iran. Use the savings for building three fences. One pair separated by about 150 yards   &mdash;   with the space beteen those two sown with a half BILLION anti-personnel and anti-vehicle landmines!</p>

			<p>Typical, the parents commit a crime by being here illegally, behave in an immoral way, disregard American laws, and this reporter has concluded that somehow its the fault of America.</p>

			<p>I would like to see the proposed repatriation program replaced with something far better. The prevention program. Here are the steps to implement the prevention program. Please get involved.</p>
<p>1. The United States Must Secure Its Borders. Border Security Is The Basic Responsibility Of A Sovereign Nation And An Urgent Requirement Of Our National Security. Remind them that this should be done in a manner consistent with protecting the liberties of United States citizens to freely travel abroad and return and is not an opportunity for the Federal government to exercise authoritarian control over its citizens detaining them for bench warrants and unpaid traffic tickets for example.</p>
<p>2. We Must Hold Employers Accountable For The Workers They Hire. No Temporary Worker Program is needed. We have tens of millions of able bodied citizens in this country living below the poverty line and the magnet of jobs and free social care must end for non-citizens.</p>
<p>3. We Must Bring Undocumented Workers Already In The Country Out Of The Shadows&hellip; and send them home. </p>
<p>4. We Must Promote Assimilation Into Our Society By Teaching New Legal Immigrants English And American Values.</p>
<p>5. End Chain Migration and Restore Legal Immigration Levels to Conservative Norms.. </p>
<p>Please do join Numbers USA at <a href="http://www.numbersusa.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.numbersusa.com/</a> and take the time to help save our nation. <br>

			<p>I beg to differ but Mexico&rsquo;s not an enemy nor a &#8220;disease&#8221;. It&rsquo;s people like you who have labeled them like that. Mexicans are not terrorists, why do they get the same kind of hate as if they actually were? War, war war! It appears to me it&rsquo;s the only &#8220;solution&#8221; the majority comes up with. War to your neighbor, to your friend, to your own family&hellip;  just like everyone else, mexicans also desire a better lifestyle, but come on, LAND MINES? Sealing and stop issuing visas? Have you forgotten that mexicans also spend their money in the United States? and they don&rsquo;t get a refund for the taxes&hellip;</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s not new that some mexicans do search for a better opportunity by migrating to the States and Canada; but what I&rsquo;ve read from these posts tells me people are just jealous, because &#8216;God forbid a mexican immigrant having a better life that the natives in the States or Canada&rsquo;&hellip; </p>

			<p>&#8220;I beg to differ but Mexico&rsquo;s not an enemy nor a &ldquo;disease&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s people like you who have labeled them like that. Mexicans are not terrorists, why do they get the same kind of hate as if they actually were? &#8220;</p>
<p>You are correct in that Mexico is not a disease or a terrrorist nor is it an enemy in the overt military sense. However it is an enemy in the stealth sense. When you have 25 million people coming here illegally, with no end in sight, AGAINST the will of the people and a Mexican government that encourages them and tells them how to do so,  that is an invasion and a colonization and thus that country is in a stealth sense, an enemy of us. Demographics is destiny and if they become the majority, then our country will be conquered just the same as if we were militarily invaded. We will have been colonized. So yes, Mexico is an enemy.</p>
<p>&#8220;War, war war! It appears to me it&rsquo;s the only &ldquo;solution&rdquo; the majority comes up with. War to your neighbor, to your friend, to your own family&hellip; just like everyone else, mexicans also desire a better lifestyle, but come on, LAND MINES? Sealing and stop issuing visas? Have you forgotten that mexicans also spend their money in the United States? and they don&rsquo;t get a refund for the taxes&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, I disagree with land mines and some go too far BUT I understand why people say such things out of frusturation. Just because Mexicans desire a better life does NOT give them the right to come here illegally and colonize our country, they should change their own country. We can&rsquo;t destroy our country and turn it into the 3rd world by taking on the 3rd world. That is very unfair to Americans and to OUR offspring. A burglar breaks into other people&rsquo;s homes because he wants a better life, your point is????</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it&rsquo;s not new that some mexicans do search for a better opportunity by migrating to the States and Canada; &#8220;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the point. The US nor Canada can&rsquo;t take on these people, it will sink us. If they want more opportunity, they need to improve their own country.</p>
<p>&#8220;but what I&rsquo;ve read from these posts tells me people are just jealous, because &lsquo;God forbid a mexican immigrant having a better life that the natives in the States or Canada&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;&#8220;</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with jealousy. If Mexicans have a great life, fine but they need to do in their own country. If Mexicans want a better life, than they need to improve their own country. Neither the USA or Canada has the money nor is it fair to the millions of Americans who lose jobs to Mexicans and other foreigners, who have to put up with overcrowding and crime and who lose social services because we&rsquo;re spending billions on Mexicans. I do also blame greedy white americans for hiring them too and our government for not shutting the border down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you forgotten that mexicans also spend their money in the United States? and they don&rsquo;t get a refund for the taxes&hellip;&#8221;&#8220;</p>
<p>We spend 300 billion a year on Mexicans while they contribute 2 billion a year to our economy. That&rsquo;s a net loss for the USA of 298 billion. Hardly a bargain for us.<br>
