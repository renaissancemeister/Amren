<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>With polls showing the presidential contest between John McCain and Barack Obama getting closer, a question is now looming larger and larger. Is skin color going to be the deciding factor?</p>
<p>Just last week, Sen. Obama warned voters that Sen. McCain&rsquo;s campaign will exploit the race issue by telling voters that &ldquo;he doesn&rsquo;t look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills.&rdquo; A few weeks earlier, he said they will attack his lack of experience but also added, &ldquo;And did I mention he&rsquo;s black?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The McCain campaign did not counter the first punch, but after last week&rsquo;s jab &mdash; fearing that Mr. Obama was getting away with calling his candidate a racist &mdash; campaign manager Rick Davis responded to the dollar-bill attack by saying, &ldquo;Barack Obama has played the race card, and he played it from the bottom of the deck. It&rsquo;s divisive, negative, shameful and wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Obama&rsquo;s campaign concedes it has no clear example of a Republican attack that expressly cites Mr. Obama&rsquo;s name or race. Yet in the last few days some Obama supporters were at it again, suggesting that a McCain ad attacking Mr. Obama as little more than a &ldquo;celebrity,&rdquo; by featuring young white women such as Britney Spears, is an appeal to white anxiety about black men and white women.</p>
<p>The race issue is clearly not going away. And the key reason &mdash; to be blunt &mdash; is because there is no telling how many white voters are lying to pollsters when they say they plan to vote for a black man to be president. Still, it is possible to look elsewhere in the polling numbers to see where white voters acknowledge their racial feelings and get a truer measure of racism.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p></p>
<p>Consider also a recent Washington Post poll. Thirty percent of all voters admitted to racial prejudice, and more than a half of white voters categorized Mr. Obama as &ldquo;risky&rdquo; (two-thirds judged Mr. McCain the &ldquo;safe&rdquo; choice). Yet about 90% of whites said they would be &ldquo;comfortable&rdquo; with a black president. And about a third of white voters acknowledged they would not be &ldquo;entirely comfortable&rdquo; with an African-American president. Why the contradictory responses? My guess is that some whites are not telling the truth about their racial attitudes.</p>
<p>A recent New York Times poll found that only 31% of white voters said they had a favorable opinion of Mr. Obama. That compares to 83% of blacks with a favorable opinion. This is a huge, polarizing differential.</p>

<p>Ninety 90% of whites would be comfortable with someone who has respected whites like Colin Powell.  Obama is just another Jesse Jackson in disguise and whites can see the difference.  The question is would blacks have voted for Powell? <br>

			<p>Ho-hum, here we go again.</p>
<p>x number of white voters refuse to vote for the black candidate, thus they are racist.<br>
y number of black voters refuse to vote for the white candidate, the accustaion of racism is nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>These massive double standards do get a bit tiresome after a while, don&rsquo;t you think?</p>

			<p>&#8220;Blacks voting for Obama out of loyalty, whites voting for McCain out of racism&#8221;</p>
<p>The attitude of Americans towards this statement may very well determine who wins the election. Question: Will Whites wimp out again?</p>

			<p>Juan Williams, the mulatto fox news caster, no racism here. What a load of manure. Undoubtedly many are going to vote for McCain because he is not a communist. While on the other hand all left wing and hyphenated Americans will vote for the enslavement of the working class. Democracy, don&rsquo;t you just love it? MOB RULE!</p>

			<p>Don&rsquo;t people realize that Obama is not black?  He&rsquo;s Irish.  He&rsquo;s &#8220;black Irish&#8221; and his name is actually spelled O&rsquo;Bama, being from the &#8220;Bama&#8221; clan.</p>

			<p>Blacks throughout the entire country at almost every level will always vote for anything and anybody they perceive will be advantageous to blacks, regardless of what might be best for all Americans and the country.</p>
<p>Likewise, blacks running for office and those appointed blaringly reveal by what they say and do that they want their positions primarily as platforms to give blacks unfair advantages over all other races in this country.  Case in point:  Everything this Obama favors&hellip;.EVERYTHING&hellip;&hellip;.every one of his proposals is a plan to elevate blacks by hook or crook at the expense of everyone else.</p>
<p>This is common knowledge to all aware whites.  It&rsquo;s so obvious it isn&rsquo;t even a contestable point.</p>
<p>&#8220;My guess is that some whites are not telling the truth about their racial attitudes.&#8221; (Juan Williams)</p>
<p>Anybody that believes whites don&rsquo;t have legitimate reasons to want to keep blacks out of leadership positions is too much of an idiot to have any of his opinions taken seriously.</p>
<p>And so far as whites not being frank about their opinions, they&rsquo;re paragons of virtue compared to the lying black talking heads we watch every night on T.V. childishly trying to convince viewing audiences of some blatant lie that&rsquo;s so obvious a child could pick up on it.  Blacks are their own worst enemies.</p>

			<p>The simple fact is that there are a good many black public figures that Republicans would be delighted to be able to vote for.</p>
<p>Dr. Thomas Sowell, Dr. Walter Williams come immediately to mind. Unfortunately, these two gentlemen have too many moral scruples to become involved in the sewer that is contemporary American politics.</p>
<p>Barack Obama, a committed Marxist (his associations make this abundantly clear), understandably alienates any sane Republican conservative.  And he revels in wallowing in the sewage.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t racism at work.  It&rsquo;s fear of a collectivist hell on earth.</p>

			<p>This whole &#8220;race and the election&#8221; obsession is as tedious as it is disingenuous. This idea that Whites are just hopelessly &#8220;racist&#8221; no matter who we vote for, while Blacks are fully expected to vote  entirely along racial lines with impugnity, is easily one of the most glaring political double-standards even seen. The whole thing is a farce&hellip;which is fully fitting in the America of today!</p>

			<p>The reason whites don&rsquo;t tell the truth about their racial attitudes is because someone always jumps down their throat and start calling them racist if they are honest. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m surprised that they haven&rsquo;t figured out a way to give Obama some sort of handicap going into the race. Remember he is a disadvantaged black man and should get preferential treatment. </p>

			<p>Juan Williams is a pretty decent black guy but he also has racist views.  The story about race and politics is that over 90% of black africans will vote for Obama.  Now that is racist and it should be a story.  Blacks are racist and much more racist than any other race on earth.  They commit horrific crimes and their racist preachers and politicans are silent.  When whites rarely commit crimes against them, the racist preachers and politicans mobolize the black racist masses.  Same story told over a millions times.  Obama is racist and only white Bolsheviks who get a thrill committing genocide against their own race will vote for the racist Obama.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s OK for them to prefer BHO based on his &#8220;blackness&#8221;, but if I prefer McCain I&rsquo;m a racist?  </p>
<p>At this point I find this whole election so disgusting that I cannot decide whether to hold my nose and pull the lever for McCain or just stay home.  Slim pickins no matter how you look at it.</p>

<p>Please inform Senator Obama that on the ten-dollar bill is a portrait of Alexander Hamilton and on the one-hundred dollar bill is Benjamin Franklin, neither of whom were Presidents. </p>

			<p>I have known and accepted Black racial solidarity ever since I became racially awakened. In my mind, it&rsquo;s taken for granted that practically 100% of Blacks you see every day are voting for Obama. They&rsquo;ll vote for the Black candidate no matter what dirt they dig up on him or how many Rev. Wrights jump out of the closet. The O.J. verdict did it for me i.e. an almost all-Black jury found him not guilty in the criminal trial and in the civil trial an almost all-White jury found him guilty. The one Black woman on the jury almost locked it up until the other 11 persuaded her to vote guilty. <br>
This pattern portends a grim reality when we look to &#8220;urban&#8221; juries to make decisions on inner city Blacks on trial for all forms of violent crime.<br>
Enough said.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t get this terrible, paralyzing fear of the pollsters. Is that how they are going to phrase their poll question? &#8220;Hello, sir, are you going to  vote for a black man to be president?&#8221; Or are they simply going to ask, &#8220;Are you going to vote for McCain or Obama?&#8221; Why do they think race will enter into the poll results if they don&rsquo;t bring it up?</p>

			<p>These surveys are structured incorrectly.</p>
<p>I would be comfortable with a black president if it was Alan Keys.</p>
<p>I also admit to being racially biased.</p>
<p>I am not racially prejudiced.</p>
<p>So how would I fit into this survey?  I wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>This survey produces the results required, and truth be damned. </p>

			<p>We&rsquo;ll see how far blacks have come in civilized society  &mdash;  as they&rsquo;re constantly ballyhooing they have  &mdash;  when Obama goes down to defeat in November.</p>
<p>I liked McCain in 2000, but now he just sounds like a tired old hack. Besides, under ordinary circumstances anyone who&rsquo;d vote Republican after eight years of insane fiscal policy and Operation Iraqi Freedom must have a bag of fertilizer between his ears where his brain should be.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I can&rsquo;t bring myself to vote for Obama, with his white-hating wife and everyone else close to him a not-so-subtle racist. Whether he himself is well-meaning or not, his presidency would be a disaster for those of us who keep whatever is still good about America functioning.</p>
<p>McCain, on the other hand, would merely maintain the steady downward spiral we&rsquo;re in, and it still might not quite crash-and-burn until I&rsquo;m too old to care.</p>

			<p>If the truth was known 99% of blacks are for their black candidate if they vote or not.  Remember when they cried racist when 50% of whites voted for Clinton while 95% of blacks voted for Obama. They can&rsquo;t be now or never will they ever be a fair and balance of nothing less than the usual double standard when dealing with certain people.</p>

<p>Jaun Williams is an NPR reporter who often skews his language to imply things along the way that are false.  The reason the McCain ad shows these two young &#8220;celebrities&#8221; is because it is well known that they are both celebrities due to their image and manipulation of image.  That is - image without substance.  But Jaun Williams wants the reader to flash on their &#8220;bigoted&#8221; areas in their mind where they probably have anxieties about white women with black men so that his readers will loose the point of the McCain ad.  After all, his job as a biased, leftest reporter is to confuse McCain&rsquo;s point, not clarify it.  And he doesn&rsquo;t shrink at playing the race card himself in order to do it.</p>

<p>Indeed Mr. Williams, the race issue is not going away!</p>
<p>It certainly hasn&rsquo;t in the Obama camp, where every little suspected &#8220;slight&#8221; toward the &#8220;savior&#8221; and &#8220;racial healer,&#8221; is attributed to racism; that is even more clearly demonstrated when just about every black in the country who can vote, admits they tend to vote for an entirely vacuous entity, simply because he is &#8220;black.&#8221; It will make them &#8220;feel good&#8221; and foster a fleeting sense of &#8220;belonging,&#8221; right up until he is sworn in and then the Nile of self-pity and stupidity will be allowed to flood the delta again. </p>
<p>Oh, on what meat has this our mulatto Pharaoh fed, right Comrade Juan?</p>
<p>Every white in this country could vote for him, and it still would not be enough!</p>
<p>Every white in this country could vote in blacks as members of the House and Senate, and it still would not be enough!</p>
<p>Every white in this country could meekly watch as the hypothetical ebony executive and legislative branches turned the judiciary into a chocolate layer cake of mocha icing and devil&rsquo;s food, and it still would not be enough!</p>
<p>No matter what is done by whitey, it will never be enough!</p>
<p>So why bother, why even pretend?</p>
<p>So I won&rsquo;t!!!</p>
<p>I will vote for that treasonous old white swine McNobrains, simply because he is nominally white; I will do so, because I know that every black and Red in this country will be demoralized and dispirited if I do so. Moreover, if McNobrains wins a white majority of 58% to 62% and takes the election (despite Obama getting 90% of the &#8220;needed&#8221; black vote, or 75% of the more &#8220;crucial&#8221; and &#8220;ecumenical&#8221; Latino vote,) it will simply send the &#8220;enlightened&#8221; wild with &#8220;tolerance&#8221; over the outcome and the wretched old &#8220;white man.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Obama&rsquo;s candidacy is a masterful piece of sleight of hand. While we fixate on his race, what&rsquo;s really happening is that a radical, far left, black separatist, marxist and pro jihadi is preparing to enter the White House. The media and all the liberals will be bouncing off the walls yelling &#8220;first black president&#8221; while normal people will be thinking &#8220;far left radical&#8221;.<br>

			<p>So what&rsquo;s the big deal? are Blacks considered racist for choosing Obama because he&rsquo;s black?; It&rsquo;s a natural choice.<br>
Nevertheless, I would prefer a Black conservative over Hilary Clinton or similar any day, even thought there&rsquo;s always a risk that a minority group President, even a Conservative, might feel naturally inclined to treat fellow minorities differently. But  that&rsquo;s why character is so important and as we know, Obama&rsquo;s character is flawed in a major way. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned he is one of the most unelectable candidates ever, skin color nothwithstanding. <br>
I&rsquo;m a little troubled that Obama may have jumped the shark. Fox&rsquo;s Juan Williams hates Obama and I&rsquo;ve noticed even some other MSM commentators are beginning to show a few cracks in their adoration of &#8216;The One that We have been Waiting For&rsquo;. What chance that at the upcoming Democrat Convention, the superdelegates might still go for the more electable but still Marxist leaning Hilary Clinton? Dare they risk alienating the Black votes? do they care? does the possibility of riots if Obama doesn&rsquo;t get the nod influence them?. <br>
Arc.<br>

			<p>Since pretty much everybody I know and associate is a liberal I simply tell them I refuse to vote and leave it at that. When I get badgered to vote for Obama, I then demand to know why I should do such a foolish thing I am ONLY ever given the following answers:</p>
<p>1) Hope, change, progress, blah blah blah���.</p>
<p>2) We don&rsquo;t need &#8220;another Bush&#8221;. </p>
<p>3 Not doing so is racist.</p>
<p>Voting for somebody for those reasons is the hallmark of democracy and sound government, while not voting for Obama because people are aware of such places as Detroit, New Orleans and Africa and have a basic understanding of cause and effect is the most vile of evils? </p>
<p>In every previous election, we were supposedly allowed, nay encouraged to vote for candidates based on absurd vagaries such as who we would �like to have a beer with�,  but this time around unless you want to be tarred and feathered you have to provide detailed critiques of Obama�s polices even though the candidate himself only speaks in vague meaningless sound bites.<br>

<p>Like JC Watts for example. He is supposed to be the consummate black &#8220;conservative&#8221;. Of course there will always be exceptions but have no doubt when push comes to shove with &#8220;people of color&#8221; race trumps &#8220;conservative&#8221; 90%+ of the time. If only whites were equally inclined at self preservation.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s John McCain who is scaring Americans about interracial relationships. And I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s McCain scaring Americans about affirmative action policies, about demographic decline, or about racial crime, violence and murder. </p>
<p>McCain may be indeed be evil, but I think it is blacks who are frightening white Americans all on their own. I&rsquo;m sorry, frightening evil white racist Americans, all on their own.</p>
<p>Then again, whites don&rsquo;t really have natural feelings. I guess that&rsquo;s what makes them so evil.</p>
<p>Controlling our thoughts is not enough anymore. Nope. They can do better. Now they are obsessed with keeping whites from getting in touch with their very feelings.   </p>

and now</p>
<p>Bully You -  into voting for Obama by calling you a liar <br>
             and a racist.</p>
<p>I think that says enough.  I think we&rsquo;ve had enough.  I also think that there is no way this is heading for a peaceful solution. Or am I possibly missing something?  Can anyone here help me to understand how this is going to all end peacefully?</p>

<p>Though this is off-topic, does anyone remember when Williams was disciplined by the Washington Post in 1991 for sexually harassing their female staffers? I recall his incredibly lame pick-up line; he would approach a co-worker and actually say &ldquo;Ooh, baby. Let me be your gynecologist.&rdquo;</p>

I had never heard that about Juan, thanks so much for posting it. I already hate the guy from his smarmy, condescending, anti-white blather on NPR; and I hate the fact that he&rsquo;s found MORE high-paying work as the WSJ&rsquo;s Token Brown Guy; and NOW your post about sexual harassment gives me ANOTHER reason to hate him. </p>
<p>Do black males EVER take a break from hitting on every female, of every race? I see it constantly. Every one of them seems to be on a nonstop, 24/7 campaign to get into some strange woman&rsquo;s pants: &#8220;Can ah get yo numba? Can ah be yo gynecologist?

I hear you on the vote for mcamnesty choice. However, if mcamnesty wins the GOP will simply have their plan to drift further left validated and the whole GOP will come together to grant amensty to the illegals. Along with it will be the loss of our culture country and heritage.</p>
<p>I have a different plan. DON&rsquo;T stay home. Vote for a 3rd party you agree with at a minimum. I am voting for Pastor Chuck Baldwin of the Constitution Party. But even Bob Barr of the libertarian party is more conservative than mcamensty and does not support amnesty. My logic goes like this. If mcamnesty wins, the 2 party sytstem will no longer have a right of center candidate in future elections. The GOP has been drifitng left for years and a mccain win will be interpreted as centrist policies win elections. If obummer wins, and the truly conservative 3rd parties garner a good share of the vote, the GOP might wise up that they have alienated conservatives for left of center voters. As for me, I am not voting lesser of 2 evils any longer. It takes time to develop a 3rd party which needs to e started now, rather than the inevitable later. I just hope we can survive the obummer socialist agenda for 4 years.</p>

			<p>McCain does not want to run against Hillary. Its obvious that McCain is not even running right now and he&rsquo;s even with Obama. The &#8216;big guns&rsquo; won&rsquo;t come out until after the conventions. Then the 527 groups will &#8216;swift boat&rsquo; Obama worse than John Kerry could imagine in a bad dream. Tony Rezko, Bill Ayers, Jeremiah Wright, Father Fleger, Ludacris, etc. McCain will win. Stand by!<br>

			<p>&ldquo;Yet in the last few days some Obama supporters were at it again, suggesting that a McCain ad attacking Mr. Obama as little more than a &ldquo;celebrity,&rdquo; by featuring young white women such as Britney Spears, is an appeal to white anxiety about black men and white women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No anxiety about white women here.  </p>
<p>Anxiety about black men?  That goes without saying.</p>
<p>Why not try speaking in plain english, Mr. Williams, and say what you mean, rather than attempting to massage us with your race-baiting double talk.  Juan Williams is the reason I quit watching PBS, never listen to NPR, and sleep late enough on Sunday to miss Fox and Friends.  He&rsquo;s as intolerable as Nancy Grace.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s grant&rsquo;em the &#8220;they are going to vote for Obama out of loyalty&#8221; claim.</p>
<p>Then, portray each and every one white voter who doesn&rsquo;t vote on McCain as dysloyal (holding one&rsquo;s nose while voting is allowed).</p>
<p>And then, portray the majority of Democratic party as dysloyal.</p>
<p>I hope this sticks.<br>

<p>I am not so sure about that. I think that David Axelrod and friends have learned quickly from John Kerry in 2004. Look at how fast Obama came out today atacking McCain and I would have to say very effectively.</p>
<p>Did you see how he handled the flag issue from a heckler in the audience today? It was brilliant!!!He cut the guy off at both knees!</p>
<p>I am not a fan of Obama, but I would not underestimate him or his campaign staff.</p>

<p>Way down South, it was the &#8220;Shanty Irish&#8221; who were the poor, unwashing working class. The &#8220;Lace Curtain Irish&#8221; were the Irish upper class, and were frequently Protestant. The Kennedys, even with money, are definitely in the Shanty class. The &#8220;Black Irish&#8221; referred to those mythical descendents of survivors of the Spanish Armada who washed up on Ireland&rsquo;s shores after being sunk by the British fleet.  In memory of one &ldquo;Shanty Irish&rdquo; immigrant ancestor who fought for the Confederacy in North Carolina, I had to add my two cents. </p>

			<p>My suspicion is that the establishment media wants to keep the public&rsquo;s attention on bogus campaign issues like racism to keep the public from noticing that Obama is really selling Socialism, and through it he is planning to loot the capitalist system and every citizen freedom in American society that relies on it - by ultimately repealing things like individual liberty (through diversity laws), private property (gradually taxing it out of existence), freedom of association (racial quota laws), and freedom of speech (PC speech laws).</p>
<p>The leftist establishment media and Obama want to debase what&rsquo;s left of free America into an entirely government controlled &#8216;multicultural&rsquo; socialist zoo - and to be clear, thanks to citizen apathy we are already a third of the way there.  </p>

			<p>  <i>The &ldquo;Black Irish&rdquo; referred to those mythical descendents of survivors of the Spanish Armada who washed up on Ireland&rsquo;s shores after being sunk by the British fleet.

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.<br>
I can&rsquo;t resist adding my two cents too. </p>
<p>It appears there is some confusion here between Shanty Irish and Black Irish. Quite a difference!</p>
<p>The &#8220;Black Irish&#8221; are a certain Celtic type (also typically found in Wales, and even Galicia in NW Spain) with blue eyes, jet black hair, and very fair milky white skin.</p>
<p>I recall my father had an aunt or cousin, many years ago, a beautiful  woman,  whom he pointed out as very typically &#8220;Black Irish.&#8221;  This was NOT a pejorative term.   The tragic &#8220;Black Dahlia&#8221;, a beauty who was murdered in Hollywood, was also described as a typical Black Irish example, if you want to see the type.  Elizabeth Taylor is not, to my knowledge, of Irish background, but she also exemplifies that type of coloring.</p>
<p>The survivors of the Spanish Armada, were  certainly not mythical.  But these were NOT the ancestors of the  &#8220;Black Irish&#8221;  anyway.  Neither were they sunk by the British fleet.  (It would have  the English fleet  in any case, there being no Great Britain yet   &mdash;   Scotland being  still independent).  Rather, they were shipwrecked by violent storms on the West Coast of Ireland.   Most of them were promptly rounded up and executed, other than those who were secretly sheltered or escaped  (to Scotland)  and  they  probably did not leave any  descendents in Ireland   &mdash;    if they even survived themselves.   If there were a very few who did, it was no number worth mentioning.   It was forbidden on pain of death to shelter them.   And they, as invaders,  wouldn&rsquo;t have settled down and raised families in what was then hostile territory under the rule of Queen Elizabeth.</p>
