						<p>Canada&rsquo;s top bureaucrat has ordered departments to target visible minorities in his latest recruitment drive to hire another 4,000 new university and college graduates by March.</p>
<p>Privy Council clerk Kevin Lynch sent out the orders as part of this year&rsquo;s efforts to renew the public service, which is undergoing a massive turnover as baby boomers retire in record numbers.</p>
<p>The big question is how long it will take to close the widening gap between the growing population of visible minorities in Canada and the proportion who land federal jobs.</p>
<p>Lynch&rsquo;s plan didn&rsquo;t specify what proportion of the new hires should be visible minorities, but recruitment will have to be in large enough numbers to start &#8220;closing the gap in representation of visible minority Canadians in the public service.&#8221;</p>
<p>To do that, the plan says visible minorities will have to be recruited in numbers beyond their proportion of the workforce.</p>
<p>The recruitment of visible minorities is among the dozen &#8220;commitments&#8221; Lynch&rsquo;s action plan laid out in June for deputy ministers, who also are expected to deliver a business plan for their departments, spelling out how they intend to recruit, develop and promote visible minorities, as well as disabled and aboriginal employees.</p>
<p>The hiring and promotion of visible minorities has been a priority for a decade, but visible minorities keep losing ground in the public service.</p>
<p>Last year, the Public Service Commission sounded the alarm when it found the recruitment rate of visible minorities was falling, even though overall hiring in the departments increased.</p>
<p>Despite the hiring spree, recruitment of visible minorities dropped to 8.7 per cent from 9.8 per cent of all hires even though visible minorities are more educated than most applicants &mdash; half have bachelor or other degrees. Language does not seem to be a barrier, especially for entry jobs, and neither does the preference for Canadian citizenship.</p>
<p>Commission president Maria Barrados launched a series of surveys and reviews to determine why visible minorities aren&rsquo;t landing jobs in the public service at a rate proportional to the numbers that apply. She also asked Statistics Canada to determine how many visible minorities will have to be recruited &#8220;within a reasonable amount of time&#8221; so the federal workforce reflects Canada&rsquo;s labour force.</p>
<p>Barrados said the commission is still reworking the numbers on how to close the gap, as well as how long it would take to ensure the visible minority population in government represents that of the country at large. &#8220;The question is at what rate do we hire to get representativeness and whether this will close the gap,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Under Canada&rsquo;s employment equity laws, the government must hire women, people with disabilities, aboriginals and visible minorities in proportion to their share of the labour force.</p>
<p>At last count, departments were trailing in the hiring of visible minorities, who make up 10.4 per cent of the labour force, but have 8.6 per cent of federal jobs. This rate, however, is based on the 2001 census, which has been eclipsed by the 2006 census.</p>
<p>The National Council on Visible Minorities has long argued that poor planning was a large part of the problem. Departments have known for years that the visible minority population is exploding, but they continued to follow the 2001 census labour force availability as the guide for hiring.</p>
<p>&#8220;They all knew those projections and we were way behind,&#8221; said Igho Natufe, president of the National Council of Visible Minorities.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we are among the most educated [to apply] then why aren&rsquo;t we employed?&#8221;<br>

			<p>&#8220;Despite the hiring spree, recruitment of visible minorities dropped to 8.7 per cent from 9.8 per cent of all hires even though visible minorities are more educated than most applicants &mdash; half have bachelor or other degrees. Language does not seem to be a barrier, especially for entry jobs, and neither does the preference for Canadian citizenship.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, the percentage of visible minorities persons entering Canada who are well-educated is less than half the total. This is because more than half of newcomers are &#8216;refugees&rsquo; and family class reunification migrants, and neither group has to have official language capability, education, or experience. And you have to wonder about the so-called skills of these &#8216;educated&rsquo; people. I read that one fellow got into Canada because of his supposed skill as a mining engineer, when all he really did was yell at people in third-world mines and had never even worked on a computer.</p>
<p>An immigration commission issued a report in the 1990s called &#8216;Not Just Numbers&rsquo;, in which they stated that ability to function in English and/or French was the most important criterion for immigrants being successful economically and integrating into the mainstream. Naturally, it got shouted down as &#8216;racist&rsquo;. Those same people who condemned these &#8216;racist&rsquo; propositions are surely complaining about the immigrants on welfare and living below the poverty line, never able to see the connection.<br>

			<p>So, private companies practice Canada&rsquo;s own version of affirmative action, and then the media, and the government itself, is all ashamed because they can&rsquo;t find enough appropriately deserving Canadians to work for the government?</p>

			<p>As a Canadian-born taxpayer for about 40 years, this traitorous government agency funded with my tax dollars is working against my interests and was entirely unknown to me until now. </p>
<p>The National Council of Visible Minorities obviously does not work on behalf of any <b>White Canadian</b> in a country that only happens to be <b>84%</b> White. </p>
<p>Is this not one reason how <i>civil wars</i> develop, when governments favour one segment of the population (mostly foreign-born in this case) over another grouping?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time for Canadians to wakeup!</p>

			<p>Can anyone imagine a black majority that would be concerned about an under-representation of white people? Of course you can&rsquo;t, because it has not, nor will it ever happen.</p>
<p>White people may be more intelligent, but they have a blind spot when it comes to looking out for their self interest.</p>

<p>I worked with a Nigerian (one of many) who had a degree and as it turned out, all he was capable of understanding or doing was handing tools out to mechanics and even then the tool had to be located and pointed out my the mechanics. In the 10 months I worked with the man, he never improved. He lives in Houston now.</p>

			<p>7:12 p.m.: Sadly, Canada very soon will be much lower than 84% White, something that I learned as a demographer myself years ago.  Due to the very immigration and affirmative action practices which you describe (which place a heavy economic burden on Whites, and White men in particular), Canada is heading for White minority status itself, not too long after the USA and Britain do the same in about 2020-2028.  </p>
<p>The PC culture and affirmative action in Canada and Britain are truly stifling, almost worse than the Diversity culture in the USA.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the PC proponents always seem to extend affirmative action benefits to White women as well as non-Whites, but this serves the same purpose, and the anti-White warriors know exactly what they&rsquo;re doing.  In White cultures, after all, women almost universally refuse to marry and have children with White men unless the latter are able to demonstrate wage-earning and child-supporting abilities.  Yet affirmative action and anti-men divorce laws seriously damage the the wage-earning potential of White men, even if they&rsquo;re geared toward White women  &mdash;   which reduces the White birth rate even further while driving the non-White birth rate way up, and provides a political coalition making affirmative action impossible to get rid of.</p>
<p>Yet another example of the pernicious policies turning the United States, Canada, UK and Australia into 3rd world countries.  Note in contrast that many other White nations, in particular Germany, Austria, Denmark and Hungary, even France these days, adamantly oppose affirmative action, and that this in most cases is also coupled with immigration policies that favor White, Nordic co-ethnics to enter in from abroad.  That&rsquo;s no accident  &mdash;   countries that support their own status as White-majority nations also take better care of their White citizens within the country itself.</p>

			<p>   While at Vancouver, B.C. &#8216;s airport for a flight back to Motown, the only race invisible was the founding race of Canada, the white-European Christian. There were approximately forty &#8221; SkyCaps &#8221; within my view of travel throughout the terminal ( June 29 th, 2004 A.D. )Everyone was an Oriental Asian Man, I presume most from Hong Kong, China; which would have been a very recent event before 2004 A.D. . Where did all of the &#8221; original, aka, white-European men disappear to ? The p.c. anti-white,tyrannical, racist gulag ?</p>

			<p>Canada&rsquo;s suffering a shortage of minorities to staff the government?</p>
<p>As a loyal citizen of their neighbor to the south, I believe we should offer some of our &#8220;aboriginals&#8221; to fill these positions.  It&rsquo;s the least we could do.</p>

			<p> Stand on any street corner in S/W Georgia and 99% of the government cars that come by are driven by minorities . They have completely over run the public school system . On the outskirts of nearly every small town there are always these new brick mansions, you can just about bet that are owned by minority husband/wife teams working for the public school system . Together they bring home a tidy sum . Now they are taking all of the jobs at large corporations . You see more and more whites unemployed and walking the streets .Admittedly they are usually the marginal whites, but they are still my brothers and sisters .</p>

			<p>Q.U.O.T.A.S. = &#8220;Questionable, Unqualified Ones Taint All Sectors&#8221;</p>
<p>Whether governmental or private, we see what happens when the unqualified assume positions they have no right to be in.  In my experience, Whites do the best job in any advocation or career&hellip; We have what I read about in Black sociological literature: &#8220;White man&rsquo;s magic&#8221;.  Although this phrase carries with it that erstwhile African superstitiousness, there is an element of truth to that expression when it comes to mere utility of our people.  <br>
Not to be critical of Cogitator&rsquo;s post, which I think has a great post, but I do believe that Blacks would want our creativity as opposed to the utter futility that Blacks have when creating things.  I do believe they would want some of us employed in their ranks if it meant more fun and enjoyment as a by-product of our intellectual prowess in computers and movies&hellip;.  That&rsquo;s why they want to live among us all the time&hellip;. even if it means getting litigious -which is the wont of most Blacks who sue&hellip;. They want our &#8220;Magic&#8221; for their benefit.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Yet affirmative action and anti-men divorce laws seriously damage the the wage-earning potential of White men,&#8221;</p>
<p>Unless a woman marries a wealthy man, which most don&rsquo;t, the household income and living standards of a woman falls after she is divorced, especially if she has kids.</p>

			<p>I used to work at one of the Social Security Administration&rsquo;s payment centers; I was white male among a majority of black women. For the most part, they were truly vicious, hateful and had attitude problems. To add insult to injury, these black woman were promoted over me. For example, I am a hard worker and took my job seriously while my &#8220;co-workers&#8221; socialized and used their phones for personal reasons. Thank god they allowed me use my headphones to drown out the noise but, at times, that did not work. Guess what? When it came time for coveted promotions, these black women were promoted over me. It was difficult to protest this; the U.S Gov&rsquo;t prides itself on being fair. Unfortunately, they don&rsquo;t practice what they preach. I am no longer working there and work in private industry where merit gets you ahead. Affirmative action and minority preferences have to end. I saw first hand that these policies don&rsquo;t work.</p>
