						<p>U.S. District Judge J. Thomas Marten ruled today against three Hispanic families who had claimed a Catholic school policy discriminated against their children.</p>
<p>Marten said this afternoon the Catholic Diocese of Wichita&rsquo;s policy requiring students to speak only English while at school did not rise to the level of a &#8220;hostile educational environment.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;If anyone thinks they&rsquo;re going to walk out of here thinking they won anything, they don&rsquo;t understand this case or either side of the issues,&#8221; [said Marten].</p>
<p>He chastised the families and school and diocese leaders for bringing the case to court, saying both sides could have worked together to find a better solution.<br>

			<p>The Catholic Church (of which I am) has been on a downward spiral ever since the Church dropped the Latin Mass. Catering to homosexuals, ignoring pedophile priests, aiding illegals are just a few reasons people are leaving the Church.  But I hope they stick to their guns in requiring all to speak English at school.<br>

			<p>I am a product of Catholic schools from kindergarten through college. I laughed when I read of this ridiculous claim by the Hispanic families. We would never have thought of questioning the &#8220;rules&#8221; in the thirties and forties. I&rsquo;m not surprised,however, upon reading who was complaining. Since our govenment has seen fit to make Hispanics the chosen people, they have whined and demanded that things go their way. How about moving on to public schools? Try and get away with it there. I WAS surprised that the school spoke up. They have pandered to Latinos for years to the point of breaking the law to acommodate them. Maybe they&rsquo;ve at last seen the light. Let&rsquo;s hope so. Priests used to go to foreign countries to bring the word. Now, they want to being the country here.</p>

			<p>Can you imagine trying to teach kids in two languages in the classroom. How long that would take. How little would get done. Only in a modern liberal world would people see that as a good thing. </p>

			<p>Although I&rsquo;m happy that the judge ruled the way he did, I think it&rsquo;s distressing that this kind of matter could ever make it into a court of law, much less a federal one.</p>
<p>Is there NOWHERE any more where white, European, English culture can be expressed without inviting a backlash?</p>

			<p>I just can&rsquo;t bother to get up in arms about English-only policies, anywhere.  So what if the Third World students have to speak English, is this somehow going to turn them into good, law-abiding Norman Rockwell Americans?  Of course not  &mdash;   they&rsquo;ll be just as prone to crime, drugs and vandalism as before, if anything they&rsquo;ll be even more dangerous to the Whites around them, because they&rsquo;ll be better at working the system!</p>
<p>English-only laws are just a waste of time, they&rsquo;re confronting the symptoms while the underlying disease spirals out of control.  The problem isn&rsquo;t language  &mdash;   it&rsquo;s demographics, and the coming submersion of the USA&rsquo;s Whites into minority status by 2025-2030.  Unless rapid measures are taken to confront this, Western Civilization in North America will be destroyed with 20 years.</p>

			<p>Sounds like we are getting close to what is the norm in Canada and Europe where the government can tell even private institutions how to run their schools. Now, even a private religious school is subject to harassment by these foreign complainers. Hey, if it&rsquo;s a private school and they tell people up front that we speak English here, tough beans; let them take their business elsewhere. There is no &#8220;better solution&#8221; other than to get these snivelling whiners to accept the fact that this is an English speaking country and if they don&rsquo;t like it, to go back that that third world trash heap they came from.</p>

			<p>This is too insane to be fiction. In the USA, disgruntled parents sue because a Parochial school uses English as the language of instruction. Here in 3rd World SE Asia, my children attend a Jesuit school and the locals demand that classes be taught in English, with Mandarin required as their 3rd language. The parents here would not sue (this is an American disease)if the school changed language policies, but they sure would immediately transfer their children to a school that would teach them proficient English.<br>

			<p>This judge isn&rsquo;t the sharpest tool in the shed.  Let&rsquo;s recap:</p>
<p>The plaintiffs enroll in a private, parochial school knowing the rules and requirements.  Then they demand the school change the rules and requirements, and sue to get their way. Only in America.  </p>
<p>All they had to do was go to another school that would gladly take their money and then educationally hamstring their children by limiting their ability to communicate proficiently in the workplace. Then again, there&rsquo;s always that good old government welfare if their kids have difficulty finding a job due to their inability to speak native English.  </p>
<p>Even better, they could go back from whence they came and bathe in their beloved romance language that will make them and their offspring feel so good. And the boost to their self-esteem would be wonderful!  Our mentally distorted public education bureaucrats truly believe this nonsense, uh, er, I mean, ah,&hellip; important fact.  </p>
<p>Try to grasp this concept, judge:  Their house, their rules in regard to student conduct in a PRIVATE school.  Surely you learned something about that in law school.       </p>

			<p>What a classic bit of befuddled liberal gibberish,<br>
&#8220;create a hostile environment&#8221;. What does hostile mean?<br>
When I was in highschool I thought the demands for homework<br>
and codes of behaviour was very hostile. I grew out of that <br>
high school mentality. Liberals never do.</p>

<p>Why are some poster here being hostile to this judge? But for his actions, the Catholic Church would have been forced to implement the plaintiffs&rsquo; insane policy demands. He basically told the involved parties to quit wasting his time! I&rsquo;ve <i>seen</i> people leaving the courthouse after such treatment by a judge. They are completely demoralized or completely p!ssed off, but by G-d they are not celebrating!</p>
<p>My hat&rsquo;s off to Judge &#8220;Doc&#8221; Marten, for stomping the invader back into their hole at least for a little while.</p>

			<p>I would have to agree in this being a frivolous lawsuit, the attorneys for the plaintiffs should be disbarred from practicing in that state (or any other) But!! imagine, IF YOU WILL, school being taught, and MASS being held in EBONICS hahahahahaa better Spanish than that, but better ENGLISH overall.</p>

			<p>This was in the news a month or so ago before the trial. The plaintiff lawyers argument didn&rsquo;t make sense, and was in fact more &#8216;inverted reality&rsquo;. English only does create a hostile environment (if you can&rsquo;t speak English), however, multilingualism causes exponentially more antagonism. </p>
<p>I was just reading a philosopher stating that language is the beginning of oppression. That is, being unable to understand an other&rsquo;s language (or being limited in what you can say) is the beginning of oppression. One language is good, having all the students be bilingual would be better, but multilingualism, having a greater number of people not being able to understand each other, is what is going to cause the greatest amount of hostility.</p>
<p>One could argue that, because these white kids are so brainwashed and minority kids so aggrieved, allowing spanish would not increase anger but reduce tensions, because these white kids are too afraid to express any discontent, and so another pogrom disadvantaging whites is held up as enlightened progress, or so it all normally is. </p>

			<p>Did some of you complaining about the judge read his ruling? He sided with the school. He simply said that it needn&rsquo;t have gone to court and who knows what each side did before it wound up in the court. And it wasn&rsquo;t about teaching in English; the school&rsquo;s rules had to do with speaking Spanish on the playground, where apparently one boy was badmouthing other kids in Spanish.</p>
