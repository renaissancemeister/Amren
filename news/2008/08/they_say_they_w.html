						<p>In the archives of local institutions, Juan Aranda&rsquo;s life is firmly rooted in this small south Texas town.</p>
<p>His birth certificate says he was delivered unto Weslaco 38 years ago, and church records say he was baptized here soon after. School files list him as a student in the local district from kindergarten through high school, and voter rolls show he votes for president here.</p>
<p>But to the U.S. State Department, all that black and white looks a lot like gray. It recently refused to issue Mr. Aranda a passport; the government isn&rsquo;t sure he&rsquo;s an American.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The problem is that Mr. Aranda was delivered by a midwife at a private home. Parteras, Spanish for midwives, have been part of life in Hidalgo and Cameron counties along the border with Mexico from the time of the Texas Republic and before. But in the early 1990s, dozens of midwives were convicted of forging U.S. birth certificates for about 15,000 children born in Mexico as far back as the 1960s.</p>
<p>As a result, the U.S. government no longer trusts that anyone in this region delivered by a midwife is an American citizen. In those cases, the government demands additional proof &mdash; a demand that has applicants scouring school warehouses and church offices to document their pasts.</p>
<p>That has caused a panic in south Texas, where locals need a valid passport more than ever. A new law that goes into effect next year requires Americans to use a passport, rather than just a birth certificate or driver&rsquo;s license, to visit Mexico and Canada. The situation threatens to isolate thousands of people in the Rio Grande Valley who regularly travel back and forth to Mexico for work or family reasons.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Desperate for Evidence</b></p>
<p>Desperate for evidence that they were born on U.S. soil, passport applicants born as far back as the 1930s come into the Cameron County Clerk Office in Brownsville to search for their midwives&rsquo; whereabouts, in hopes that the aging women can testify for them, says Lettie Perez, deputy county clerk.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>No Recourse</b></p>
<p>Since the adjudicators don&rsquo;t formally deny a request, but only request more evidence, applicants who are refused passports don&rsquo;t have any recourse to appeal within the State Department.</p>

			<p>There are a lot of similar rumors floating around about The Messiah&rsquo;s, Lord Barack H. Obama&rsquo;s, Nativity, that his Hawaiian birth certificate is a fraud.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s something else odd.  Up until relatively recently, many places in America, especially in the South, didn&rsquo;t issue birth certificates.  So, other than pure trust, how do we know they&rsquo;re citizens?</p>

			<p>This is an easy one. If an american citizen is denied a passport, apparently the Government says he is not an american. And I would offer no longer burdened by taxes, insurance, valid ID, as so many others are allowed to run free in the US. </p>

			<p>Michael Cutler, retired immigration officer, sent me an e-mail with the article published within the past few days in Los Angeles Times about Gangs in Los Angeles, California, being involved in large scale fraudulent identification documentation fabrication.  I forwarded that e-mail to various New Jersey State government legislators, hoping they will some day spark up some interest in opposing illegal alien subsidies here in New Jersey.</p>

			<p>Well this thread is as good a place as any to post this following tidbit that drudgereport has a big banner headline stating the following:</p>
<p>WHITES NO LONGER MAJORITY BY 2042 </p>
<p>the banner is linked to this article which if I did not know any better could have been posted here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newsday.com/news/local/longisland/ny-licens0814,0,1551401,print.story" rel="nofollow">http://www.newsday.com/news/local/longisland/ny-licens0814,0,1551401,print.story</a></p>
<p>Now this info is old news to us chaps but when you consider the number of ppl who go thru the drudgereport and will be seeing this until tomorrow midday sometimes then we can let out a cheer of sorts.</p>
<p>I wonder when reading this article and especially the last passage; how many soccer-moms, bohemians, born agains and do-gooders will finally wake up at last.</p>

			<p>Interesting how the INS focuses on a few people borne in the border areas of Texas, examining their birth certificates minutely, while hordes of illegals continue to pour into this country through our porous borders or enter legally then simply disappear and assume new identities.  The really sad thing is that most people like Juan Aranda are legally-born American citizens who are being tormented simply because it&rsquo;s easier than tracking down real illegals.</p>
<p>Your feddle gummint at work.</p>

			<p>If we got rid of the illegals, enforced our immigration laws and closed our borders, Hispanics who are here legally wouldn&rsquo;t have so much trouble. Since we do have so many illegals and the government does so little, its easy to believe most Hispanic are here illegally. <br>
 <br>
Juan Aranda is probably an American citizen as he claims to be. The government seem to have a bad habit of going after people like him. It&rsquo;s easer to arrest people like him than it is to arrest gang member and other criminal who are here illegally<br>
 <br>
Juan Aranda is as much a victim of La Raza and the open border advocates as the rest of our.  </p>

<p>I disagree.  Not &#8220;if&#8221;, but, &#8220;when&#8221; we get rid of the illegals, enforce our immigration laws and close our borders it will be much worse for the Hispanics who are here legally because they don&rsquo;t speak out against their illegal brethren.  </p>
<p>They salivate over the prospect of a Hispanic majority that leads to a Hispanic government and the end of white rule.  They want to commandeer what our ancestors have built for us because all their own ancestors have built for them are corrupt, criminal, impoverished hellholes&hellip;</p>

			<p>To: question diversity. As far as I know, southerners as well as &#8220;yankees&#8221; have birth certificates. I have mine and it is clearly dated 1931. Old enough for you? Sure is for me!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always amazed that with their criminal minds, illegals can think up any scam they want except to take a stand in their own country and demand their lawless governments take care of them. We don&rsquo;t need them. We have between 1-2 million legal immigrants coming in every year. Don&rsquo;t they need jobs?</p>

<p>There is no longer a &#8220;when&#8221; to it. We have two presidential candidates and a congress that supports amnesty for illegals. Plan on 10-15 million new citizen in the next four years.</p>

			<p>  Why not just herd ALL mexicans back across the southern border? It makes perfect sense to me. Maybe they can go and live in the new Indo-America. I am sick and tired of supporting them with my tax dollars. </p>

			<p>Do you ever think that the Feds do this stuff just to drum up sympathy for illegals and make people want to pass an amnesty for them? I&rsquo;m starting to think this more and more. Here in California, it&rsquo;s essentially legal to be an illegal alien. I figure 1/2 my city are illegal aliens. The feds never raid anywhere around here and I don&rsquo;t even bother to call them about obvious illegals working for big corporations. </p>
<p>The only time they DO do any raids out here, they raid the illegals who are working on FARMS. Now, sadly, we may just need illegals as farm labor. I doubt if we need them anywhere else, but we may need them on farms. These raids make the Hispanic community go insane, seem stupid to a lot of sensible folks, and drive big agribusiness (they really control the politics around here) into conniption fits about &#8220;labor shortages&#8221;. Out of all the places they could have raided (How bout construction sites?!) they choose farms, the one place the raids are least needed. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a conspiracy theorist, but this stuff makes me wonder.</p>

			<p>the gov&rsquo;t should not accept anything presented as proof of citizenship from any religious organization, there is no doubt a church would vouch for any illegal alien, even if it means lying to do so</p>

It is only natural to scrutinize the birth certificates of people of Mexican ancestry since  many of  the midwifes were involved in big time fraud.  If such people can prove to the U.S. State Department that their parents were citizens at the time of birth, they were born US citizens, whether here or abroad.  Hence, there is no need for a lawyer or this type of nonsense to go to court.<br>
