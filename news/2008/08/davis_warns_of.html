						<p>Congressional candidate Jack Davis, in a speech earlier this year, warned that increasing immigration from Mexico could lead to a new civil war between northern states and Mexican-influenced Southern states that may want to secede from the United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the latter part of this century or the next, Mexicans will be a majority in many of the states and could therefore take control of the state government using the democratic process,&#8221; Davis said in the speech. &#8220;They could then secede from the United States, and then we might have another civil war.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;They have an allegiance to Mexico, where they were taught the U.S. fought an unjust war with Mexico and took this territory,&#8221; Davis said. &#8220;They believe the territory of these states belongs to Mexico.&#8221;</p>
<p>Davis did not name specific states that might be prone to succession.</p>
<p>But he appeared to be referring to Texas &mdash; which seceded from Mexico, briefly became an independent republic and then joined the United States &mdash; and the territories Mexico lost as a result of the Mexican-American War of 1846-48. California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, New Mexico and much of Colorado were all once Mexican territory, only to become U. S. states after the war.</p>
<p>Asked this week about his speech, Davis said he no longer believed Southern states would be prone to leaving the union in order to assert Mexican control over what is now U.S. territory.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think they&rsquo;ll do it without a civil war,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They&rsquo;ll take control of the state governments and start voting themselves anything they want.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a top official at the National Council of La Raza, the nation&rsquo;s leading Hispanic organization, termed Davis&rsquo; comments &#8220;extremely offensive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&rsquo;s feeding an environment of intolerance that doesn&rsquo;t distinguish between legal and illegal immigrants,&#8221; said Clarissa Martinez, director of immigration and national campaigns for the organization. &#8220;He&rsquo;s presenting our whole community as invaders &mdash; people who want to take over the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>In fact, Davis in his speech, said: &#8220;Our country has been invaded, occupied and settled by 10 million illegal aliens.&#8221;</p>
<p>Davis issued a statement Friday, trying to clarify his earlier comments.</p>
<p>&#8220;My remarks at the Center were designed to bring urgency to the conversation,&#8221; he said in the statement. &#8220;I believe passionately in protecting our homeland and securing our borders. If my language was hyperbolic, the danger it described certainly is not.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I think building a double wall long the southern border is the least expensive long-term solution to maintaining the heritage of our fathers,&#8221; Davis said in the speech on YouTube.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Congressional candidate Jack Davis responded to questions about his speech with this comment on Friday:</p>
<p>&#8220;We are a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of laws. The Bush immigration policy is a disaster and the American taxpayers are on the hook for it. &#8220;In my view, American immigration policy must:</p>
<p>&#8220;Secure our borders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reduce the number of illegal aliens in our country.</p>
<p>&#8220;Require the people already here to learn English, pay taxes and get in line for citizenship at their own expense.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not practical to deport millions of people, but we can&rsquo;t reward or encourage further illegal entry into the United States with special rights or privileges.</p>
<p>&#8220;Corporate greed creates the demand for cheap labor which draws immigrants from across our borders and hurts law-abiding American workers. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Our broken borders, unsecured ports, and lack of effective inspection and enforcement, jeopardize the prosperity and security of Americans every single day. Until we fix it, we are vulnerable to another attack like we had in 2001 or worse, and American workers and their families will continue to suffer.&#8221;<br>

			<p>Of course it&rsquo;s going to happen. The Southwest will remain part of America the same way Quebec is to Canada, that is, until they&rsquo;re no longer able to squeeze anymore money out of a bankrupt Uncle Sam.  I can see Southern secessionists using the opportunity to forge an alliance with the Mexicans to free Confederate states from the union.  The future of the Deep South looks pretty grim with so many blacks moving from the North and the high birth rates.  It just might motivate people to do something to save their heritage.</p>

			<p>Mr. Davis doesn&rsquo;t go far enough. He says &#8220;It&rsquo;s not practical to deport millions of people.&#8221; It is *essential* that we deport the many millions of unwanted illegals in this country. If we do not, they&rsquo;ll achieve conquest by high birth rates alone. This will take longer than high birth rates bolstered by continuing immigration, but the net result will be the same.<br>
If these people managed to enter the U.S. illegally, why would it be so hard to make them return to their countries of origin by legal means? All it would take is the will to solve the problem.</p>

			<p>White -Christian Americans, aka, the founding original Americans have had only treason and non-reprsentation in the federal gov&rsquo;t when the demo-rats took away &#8221; representative democracy &#8221; (republican form of gov&rsquo;t, a &#8221; republic &#8221; and gave us non-representative,treasonous,, racist, parasitic diversity and this ethnic cleansing pogrom has been with us ever since the 1965 A.D. Immigration and Reform Act.Use the RICO law for this organized genocidal,civil rights/voter rights violations against original Americans caused by racial Marxism.</p>

			<p>Unfortunately Davis is pushing the nonesense about America being a nattion of immigrants. It is the millions of post-1965 non-whites-immigrant &#8220;America&#8221;- that is the problem, not the millions of Native Born White Americans who were born and raised in America. What ever emerges in California and the Southwestern States will not be be American. Change the racial composition of California and the Southwestern States and these states will be foriegn, that is to say not American. Everyone knows Miami, large parts of Southern California. LA and a large parts of Southern California are  &#8220;American&#8221; only in name. Whether these areas are complete extensions of the motherlands is irrelevant. Hispanics and asians will control the resources and infrastructure of these areas for the complete benefit of hispanics and asians. This will make them separate nation states within the borders of the US. Hispanics and asians will control immigration policy in these areas also. So you can be certain that the hispanic and asian population of these areas are going to be huge and growing. We are talking about huge population transfers from mexico,china,india and pakistan to the United States. I hope watching ESPN and sports entertainment was worth it bozos. You are going to loose your country.</p>
<p>The fact that we are becomming a nation of immigrants is the problem.</p>

			<p>Mexicans mystical land is called Altzan! And yes- this is exactly what the invaders will do. While our government fiddles. However, make no mistake about it this is planned and our own government is the main culprit. Its called the New World Order. Break the USA into smaller territories and absorb them all into the North American Union – easier to manage. Coming soon rate after the economic collapse that is going to occur regardless with idiot becomes President. It does not matter. Both Obmanation and McInsane have the same agenda. </p>

Well of course the imperialists at La Raza are offended, can&rsquo;t have anybody shedding light on their agenda until they have all the pieces in place and those pieces are Mexican citizens living up here with dual citizenship, voting rights and loyalty to Mexico.</p>

Once again the La Raza people show what hypocrites they are, they themselves don&rsquo;t distinguish between legal and illegal immigrants. It doesn&rsquo;t matter one bit to them if you&rsquo;re here illegally, if you&rsquo;re hispanic you should be able to stay no matter what even if it is in violation of US immigration laws.</p>

			<p>Now do you see the perils of democracy? A failed system when foreigners of any kind are allowed the same rights as native inhabitants. I suggest the readers here familiarize themselves with the great Romanian patriot, Corneliu Codreanu.  His commentary regarding democracy is a must read.</p>

			<p>A regional riot could get started sooner rather than later if the jobs that the immigrants perform dissapear and the welfare runs out.  Other than that, I don&rsquo;t see it happening.       </p>
<p>I read that 30% of people of Mexican decent who were born in the USA marry people who are not Mexican, the majority of whom are undoubtedly whites.  Such mixing does not lend itself to people starting race based regional riots or civil wars.</p>

			<p>Isn&rsquo;t it tiring to see our politicians backpeddaling so often after makeing statements based on their beliefs and convictions. These groups just know that they can cow politicians into doing or saying anything they want to avoid the racist term being applied to them. Sickening, just sickening.</p>

			<p>      It is eminently rational to deport millions of people if<br>
those people are illegal and Mexican. And it is possible too.<br>
Eisenhower deported a million or so. Surely we have greater means<br>
than he did now. But we lack the will-the will to power, the will<br>
to life. One man&rsquo;s practical is another man&rsquo;s impossible. It&rsquo;s<br>
practical if you see clearly what the stakes are.</p>

			<p>There won&rsquo;t be a new civil war when the predominantly hispanic south-west asserts its independence because the predominantly hispanic asian and black-rest-of-the-nation won&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>And anytime someone says &#8220;we are a nation of immigrants&#8221; and prefers to focus only on illegals, then they have already lost whatever momentum they were trying to build.</p>

Mr. Davis has it exactly right. La Rasa touts its belief in &#8220;La Reconquista,&#8221; which is that the US &#8220;stole&#8221; the southwest and it must be &#8220;repatriated.&#8221; If I could vote for, and campaign for, Davis, I would   &mdash;   but I&rsquo;m a state away.  </p>

			<p>If anything, the traditional South (former Confederate states not including Texas) might eventually try to secede from the corrupt (North American) Union and deal with the millions of illegals on their own, without federal interference.</p>

			<p>If the Hispanic invaders manage to loosen the control of D.C. (i.e. Northern commercial interests) and the country does fracture, you can be sure that white Southerners will deal with the minority problems quickly.  They would also have nuclear weapons at their disposal, so there would be no question of outside interference.  </p>

<p>He says.  Oh, yes it is. Look at the millions of WHITE people who have been deported out of Miami, South Texas, LA, South California and the entire border areas of New Mexico, Arizona, etc.</p>
<p>If millions of whites can move, then millions of Mexicans can move back to Mexico. They came with nothing and they can leave with nothing. Actually, they will load up their Chevy Silverado&rsquo;s with their barbeque grills, TV&rsquo;s, Dora the Explorer CD collection, Clothes from Wal-Mart and drive in air-conditioned comfort back to the &#8220;home land&#8221;. Maybe they have learned something from us nasty white racists and can build up Mexico to be like America.  Nah, they ain&rsquo;t white.</p>

			<p>Meanwhile, a top official at the National Council of La Raza, the nation&rsquo;s leading Hispanic organization, termed Davis&rsquo; comments &ldquo;extremely offensive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s feeding an environment of intolerance that doesn&rsquo;t distinguish between legal and illegal immigrants,&rdquo; said Clarissa Martinez, director of immigration and national campaigns for the organization. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s presenting our whole community as invaders &mdash; people who want to take over the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&gt; &#8220;This is amazing to read, coming from a La Raza representative.  I recall watching their speeches on tv in the 1980s when they were absolutely promising to take over California for Mexico.  And they call all that Southwestern territory &#8220;Aztland.&#8221;</p>
<p>From Tim;</p>
<p>&#8220;I read that 30% of people of Mexican decent who were born in the USA marry people who are not Mexican, the majority of whom are undoubtedly whites. Such mixing does not lend itself to people starting race based regional riots or civil wars.&#8221;</p>

&gt; Tim is right.  The only way to prevent this is for white parents to begin to raise their children with racial awareness and pride in what and who they are.  Then there is a good chance that less will marry non-whites.  And this identity will have to include more than as American Christians, since both have technical problems for white unity.  It is going to have to include a knowledge of European our roots, even to understanding our pre-Christian tribal societies, including the myths and religious practices.  We used to get this when children studied ancient Greece in elementary schools through the classic arts and philosopies and myths that went with it.  But even more than that is needed.  Northern Europeans must find their roots in the folk lore of the fijords and the mountains of Norway, the waters of the Rhine, the mystic stone circles and dolmas of the Celts.  We cannot let ourselves continue to be identified by a religion that actually stole our indigenous identity from us and gave us a Middle-Eastern one.</p>

			<p> <i>&ldquo;They have an allegiance to Mexico, where they were taught the U.S. fought an unjust war with Mexico and took this territory,&rdquo; Davis said. &ldquo;They believe the territory of these states belongs to Mexico.&rdquo;<br>
 <br>
Mr. Davis has it exactly right. La Rasa touts its belief in &ldquo;La Reconquista,&rdquo; which is that the US &ldquo;stole&rdquo; the southwest and it must be &ldquo;repatriated.&rdquo;<br>

And some of these groups have taken that notion and extended it to cover ALL of the country, and even all of North America.   Indeed, they claim ALL of the Americas and want us to leave!   There is no pacifying them.  So don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll be content with the Southwest.  Besides, their numbers are growing enormously in places like Minneapolis, Chicago, Kansas City, Pittsburg,  D.C., the  Pacific Northwest.   They&rsquo;re all over the  country now.</p>
<p>I also agree with Freyr that where&rsquo; there&rsquo;s a will there&rsquo;s a way, and it is fully possible to deport millions of illegals.  Not only has it been done before (in the &rsquo;50s),  but it would not even be necessary to deport such a large number.  By drying up the supply of jobs available to them, through applying sanctions on employers, through taxes on remittances,  elimination of welfare and free medical benefits,  anchor babies, scholarships, etc., a great many could be induced to return home voluntarily.  Dry up the well, and they won&rsquo;t come to drink!  The remaining core could then be deported, but most would already be gone.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I dont believe that Mexican-Americans really want their states to become a part of Mexico. If it did, then they would have a lot less blood to suck from the taxpayers and Whitey.&#8221;<br>

I think you&rsquo;ve got a good point there.  Educated Mexican-Americans probably realize that.  Those that I&rsquo;ve talked to here say they don&rsquo;t want to go back to being in Mexico again. They want a third option.  They want something that&rsquo;s like Mexico, but not <i> in </i> Mexico.</p>
<p>However, uneducated Mexicans (the majority) probably don&rsquo;t bother to think that far. They&rsquo;re all for the very same country that kept them poor and miserable, the country that didn&rsquo;t want them and drove them out.  But they love it just the same!   Figure that.</p>

<p>One could go on for pages, but Jupiter has encapsulated it beautifully.  I have rarely seen  &#8220;the problem&#8221;  stated so well and so succinctly. </p>
<p>&#8220;A nation of immigrants&#8221;  is EXACTLY the problem   &mdash;   a nation that has lost its sense of common identity;  a country that has become nothing more than an address, an ID card, and a place to make money.  </p>
<p>Of course, this is just what some people want it to be. They have gotten their wish   &mdash;   because they have organized and worked  hard for it, while we have done nothing.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;I think they&rsquo;ll do it without a civil war,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll take control of the state governments and start voting themselves anything they want.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Most likely true, but the conditions COULD be present which evolve into a civil conflict and war with Mexico would be unavoidable, because they would move to protect their tribal kin, many of whom have dual citizenship.</p>
<p>The key to our tenuous multicultural utopia is the economy.  If it ever plummets causing a severe depression, we will then see why multicultural utopias have always failed throughout the history of mankind, with most of them erupting into internecine warfare.</p>
<p>Too, we shouldn&rsquo;t take the ongoing black/Hispanic riots and racial murders in California too lightly, because they too could spark an armed conflict.  Parts of Texas also could erupt as well.</p>
<p>Multicultural utopias are constantly &#8220;On the brink.&#8221;  The countries of the world that are the most homogeneous will be the super powers of the 21st century:  China, Japan Korea, and Russia.</p>
<p>Europe and the US, alas, are on the way out, either through degenerating into a Brazilian type society or erupting in civil war.  </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not an opinion.  It&rsquo;s a certainty.</p>

			<p> There&rsquo;s definitely a creeping annexation of the Southwest by Mexico.  I doubt a shooting war will happen, but partition sometime in the future seems likely.  Of course, our current privileged elite would never peacefully allow whites to have their own territories devoid of diversity. </p>

<p>I disagree, Mexico does so every year.</p>
<p>It has been pointed out countless times that our national fleet of school busses that are idled every summer could be used to deport illegals to Mexico and do it quickly and at little expense.  </p>

			<p>If it is practical to dispossess the once overwhelmingly White population of the U.S. and turn the nation into a colony of the third world, then anything, ANY THING, is practical.  What is meant by all this &#8220;We can&rsquo;t just send them all back&#8221; talk is that we can&rsquo;t just send them all back without punishing the traitors who invited them in the first place.  Deportation of foreigners inevitably means a public accounting of just how they got here in the first place.  The Reds cannot endure an honest examination of their actions and motives, so they must be committed to our complete destruction.  And so must we be committed to theirs.</p>

			<p>Please, there will be no shooting war between the United States of TODAY, and Mexico. What will happen, in my opinion is the following. There will be a slow and inexorable change in the &#8220;way things are done&#8221; in the areas largely inhabited by Mexican illegal aliens. In other words, there will be no Western World type city councils, where things are discussed and voted on honestly, instead things will be settled by bribes, bodily threats, and other forms of intimidation, just as in Old Mexico.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a far out opinion at all. It has already happened in the politics of South Gate, Cudahy, Bell Gardens, Compton, Lynwood, and Los Angeles, among other Southern California cities with Mexicans exclusively on the city councils. One only needs to read up on the shananigans of one Albert Robles in South Gate, for a look at the future.</p>
<p>Now the reason this will all come about, again in my opinion,is because cowardly whites, blacks, orientals, and others will not stop it and indeed, have personal interests too conflicted to stop any of it. This will give the Mexican majority an easy time of it, for as the old law of real estate(what it&rsquo;s all about) says, possession IS,nine tenths of the law. Shear numbers will decide the issue, and the above mentioned cowardly Americans, will do nothing in the face of those numbers. In fact, how much clearer can it be, that those elites in Washington, could not care less and seem to even be egging the process on?</p>

Just as it is in America with its  servant-class Mexicans, generally illegals, so it is the same elsewhere.  In much of the USA today, the hotel maids (and staffs) are  all Mexican. You will hear only  Spanish spoken in the hallways.  It is the same with restaurants and their kitchen help (and  now more often, the waiters as well).  Low-paid, low-skill labor, producing big-scale profits &hellip; for someone.   All at the expense of the rest of society.</p>
<p>As an American who&rsquo;s been traveling in Europe this summer, and keenly observing the local scene,  I can&rsquo;t help seeing the wider analogies to this.  They extend across the  <i>entire  </i>white world.  In Sweden, as I&rsquo;ve noticed, the hotel maids and staffs seem to be Thais  (both male and female).  In Switzerland, the maids are often South Americans.   In France, they are  nearly always black Africans.  And so on.  In many French restaurants and hotels, the entire behind-the-scenes staff appears to be black, with only a few whites out  in front to greet the public.</p>
<p>In Germany, though, hotel maids are not Turks, despite their abundance. I can&rsquo;t recall having seen  <i>any.  </i>  Interesting!  And though Sweden now has plenty of Somalis and Arabs, and France  has its North Africans by the millions, I see none of their women working in hotels or restaurants   &mdash;    or other outside jobs.   It seems that Moslems  do not send their women out to work,  but keep them  at home where their job is  solely to produce more babies.    </p>
<p>Thus the conquest advances.   And our businessmen wallow in their short-term profits, oblivious to the future.</p>

			<p>If one looks at the vast array of weaponry from handguns to nuclear weapons utilized by our military one realizes these weapons were designed expressly for killing our foreign enemies and no one questions the right of the military to use these weapons in defense of our nation.  Therefore, no one has the right to question the right of our civilians when we are forced to utilize their own personal deadly weapons against our foreign and domestic enemies because our military refuses to do its constitutional and civic duty of defending our borders&hellip;  </p>
