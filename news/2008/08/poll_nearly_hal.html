<h1>Poll: Nearly Half Hearing too Much About Obama</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, August 6, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Barack Obama may be the fresh face in this year&rsquo;s presidential election, but nearly half say they&rsquo;re already tired of hearing about him, a poll says.</p>
<p>With Election Day still three months away, 48 percent said they&rsquo;re hearing too much about the Democratic candidate, according to a poll released Wednesday by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center. Just 26 percent said the same about his Republican rival, John McCain.</p>
<p>Obama, the 47-year-old Illinois senator who would become the first black president, has dominated political news coverage much of the year. According to an ongoing Pew study, Obama has appeared in more news stories this year and more people say they have heard more about him than McCain, the longtime Arizona senator who also ran for president in 2000.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of Republicans and about half of independents said they&rsquo;ve heard too much about Obama, as did a third of Democrats, a significant number.</p>

			<p>The U.S. media is attempting to do with Obama what the Canadian media elites did with Trudeau in 1968. They called it &#8220;Trudeaumania&#8221;. Its the same old propaganda machine at work.</p>

			<p>Obama&rsquo;s popularity is a complete lie crafted by a controlled media.  If you want to see the truth about Obama and how his campaign is crashing and burning, take a look at these clips from his St. Petersburg rally:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHFDR_zeiNI&amp;feature=bz301" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHFDR_zeiNI&feature;=bz301</a></p>

<p>Obama&rsquo;s support, across the board, is disintegrating, mostly because the democratic party is fractured between relatively normal people and psychotic neo-communist losers.  In attempting to speak to both factions, he has found himself alienating both.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s really going to hurt him is loss of support among blacks.  Oh, they will still vote as a bloc for him.  But far fewer will bother to vote.  They simply don&rsquo;t see him as one of their own.  No one will say it, of course, not to his face.  But the fact is, he is of mixed race.  That might not matter the way it should, to whites.  But it does to blacks.  They simply are not willing to give him nearly as much slack as they would a BLACK candidate.  He ain&rsquo;t black enough&hellip;..so when he talks like a normal person, they don&rsquo;t see one of their own.  They see him as a white man, pretending to be black to get their support.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not wrong.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sick of the guy myself. He seems well-meaning  &mdash;   certainly no less so than most politicians  &mdash;  and some of the right wing media&rsquo;s attempts to smear him are quite pathetic.</p>
<p>The trouble is, he&rsquo;s just a politician&hellip; and not a very experienced one. He tends to surround himself with vindictive people. And he&rsquo;s inheriting the biggest mess I&rsquo;ve ever seen in my lifetime. LBJ was the greatest legislative genius ever to occupy the Oval Office, and look where HE got us! Once the novelty wears off and Obama has as much trouble as any other politician getting things done, the backlash could be vicious.</p>
<p>Then, when things go sour, you can count on his dumb wife to start shooting off her mouth bitterly, as if it were all happening just because Obama&rsquo;s black.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be bad enough as it is, with the simple-minded rabble feeling empowered to be even more obnoxious than usual toward civilized (white) society. Raising expectations to all-time highs, then dropping them like lead balloons, isn&rsquo;t really what America needs right now.</p>

			<p>This is a scam.  The more people hear about Obama the more they will know he is a marxist whose allegiance is to a prospective world government and not the people and culture of the United States.  The mainstream media wants to hide the real Obama and will construct any excuse to do so.</p>

			<p> This is alittle off subject, but I thought I&rsquo;d share it. I traveled to Illinois acouple weeks ago and stopped at a diner to eat lunch. While sitting at the counter I could hear the black cooks talking about Obama. One of them said to the other,&#8221;jus thank, a black man fittin to own everythang in the whirl.&#8221; Now can any of you ever remember a White person saying that the White president &#8220;owned&#8221; everything in the &#8220;whirl?&#8221; This is getting scary!!!</p>

<p>Big surprise here, the &#8220;mainstream&#8221; media have been gushing like schoolgirls over this multicultural symbol of theirs for so long, that only the truly blind cannot grasp that he is nothing but a symbol for this degenerate ideology of theirs. Since he has yet to walk on water, or turn that water into wine before he treks upon it, he slowly descends into the vacuous hole of his own ability and substance; thus, he is the perfect candidate for the Red swine and traitors in this country. </p>
<p>The only thing that could possibly prove this more, would be his actual election and the subsequent kaleidoscopic shambles of his &#8220;presidency.&#8221;</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!<br>

			<p>What did someone say you can fool some of the people some of the time.but  you cannot fool all the people all the time.The media really think they can elect Obama president  just because he is a mulatto. Just turn on the local news and see how many Zambos, Happas and undefinables are reporting the news.EG. Ann Curry is half white and half Japanese.</p>

			<p>I think Obama&rsquo;s campaign propaganda has been completely over the top. It is painfully obvious to everyone with a mental age above 12-years-old that the &#8220;Dems&#8221; are trying to promote a new political religion. </p>

			<p>Tom S overheard a black cook saying about Obama: &rdquo;jus thank, a black man fittin to own everythang in the whirl.&rdquo;  </p>
<p>My own experience a couple of days ago was a little different.  I was sitting in the break room at work with a newspaper open to a story about Obama.  One of my black co-workers walked by and looking over my shoulder asked, &#8220;You plannin&rsquo; to vote for that (n-word)?&#8221;  While some black girls sitting nearby nodded their heads and giggled, I said without emotion (as whites are expected to when blacks use the n-word), &#8220;I&rsquo;m not sure yet.&#8221;  To which he replied, exact words, &#8220;That damn c**n ain&rsquo;t qualified to run this country!  I&rsquo;m voting for McCain.&#8221;  Again, the black girls nodded and giggled.</p>
<p>Were my co-workers just having a little fun at whitey&rsquo;s expense?  Could be. On the other hand, it could signal that not all blacks have been sucked in by the media&rsquo;s Obama mania. </p>

Posted by Tom S at 6:43 PM on August 7 </p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right on, Tom.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve no doubt that a large faction of low intelligent blacks truly believe that if Obama is elected it will mean that blacks are now in charge.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s going to be as much of a problem as the ideology of this man himself.  Like every other black leader, every single policy he promotes, every single program he wants to put into effect, all are for the purpose of elevating blacks somehow.</p>
<p>If he wants to prevent a war with Iran, (as most of us do, incidentally, but for far different reasons) it&rsquo;s because he wants all the funds he can muster in order to put into place his agenda for black uplifting and empowerment.</p>
<p>If he wants health care for everybody, it&rsquo;s really just blacks he&rsquo;s thinking of.  If he wants to turn the country into a big government, big brother entity that will give free education, tutors for slow students, and the like, it&rsquo;s because he thinks it will enable blacks to learn and prevent them from dropping out. Because the regular school subjects are too difficult for them to learn, Obama believes giving more black districts more money, plus other benefits will solve the problem.  Barack Hussein&rsquo;s  entire desire to be president is do what he can to empower blacks by hook or crook.</p>
<p>When you listen to every black leader in this country, they all say that blacks are oppressed and exploited and denied even basic human rights.  They speak of the gross injustices that black males, especially, face.  That was a favorite theme of Jeremiah Wright, and, of course, the entire congregation justs eats it up when they hear things like that, because it offers them cover for not being able to compete with whites.  In fact I believe about 98% of all blacks feel the same way.  They would never admit that it&rsquo;s not because the don&rsquo;t have the mental abilities to succeed or a lack of determination, motivation, and a better attitude, it&rsquo;s all because of whitey.</p>
<p>When Wright waves his arms around and dances, ranting that we should God  &mdash;    &mdash;   America for the horrible injustices blacks face today, what he&rsquo;s really doing is screaming out his frustration that blacks just can&rsquo;t succeed, so he believes that the spineless liberals and timid neo-cons will become afraid of a black uprising and will offer many freebies to blacks to get them up to a level they can&rsquo;t reach themselves on their own.  I&rsquo;m sure his motivation is for purposes of intimidation mostly.  And why not, it has always worked so well for them.</p>
<p>After listening to such ridiculous lies for 22 years, this Obama has to believe exactly the same way, although I think he was of those opinions before he joined the United Trinity Church, quite frankly.  His approach to get his agenda to succeed, however, is more covert than Wright&rsquo;s in your face rants.  Obama is masking it under a desire for a climate of universal brotherhood for all the people of the country.  &#8220;Unity.&#8221;  &#8220;Coming together,&#8221; as he calls it.</p>
<p>Blacks like Obama for the same reasons they like a communist system of government.  &#8220;From each according to his ability, to each according to his need.&#8221;  He might not be a full-fledged communist, but Obama gives strong hints of moving in the direction of a state controlled society, which blacks simply love.  Instead of ability being the governing factor for jobs, bean counting will take its place, so many of this race or that will dictate where appointments go.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that, even if this character is elected, he&rsquo;s not going to change the fact that blacks don&rsquo;t have the necessary equipment to do any better than they always have, but the country will be a mess and will have moved in the direction of a big government totalitarian state that is filled with far too many incompetents, just like the ones that are bringing South Africa to ruin.</p>
<p>After Jimmy Carter&rsquo;s inept leadership, his liberal policies pulled the country further to the left, as did Clinton&rsquo;s.  After 8 years of Obama the same thing will occur, plus unqualified blacks will be in positions everywhere and the entire devastating effect will be multiplied by a factor of about 10.</p>

			<p>Thanks to the media, Obama is essentially getting a free pass from much scrutiny. The media are so in love with him that they are suspending judgment, caught up in the emotionalism and romantic moment. They display absolutely no objectivity.<br>
 <br>
A prime example of the bias was when Obama wrote an editorial in the New York Times. John McCain wrote a rebuttal. The New York Times refused to publish the rebuttal! </p>
<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t we all be concerned as Americans that the press has lost its moorings as the Fourth Estate? This is supposed to be one of the checks and balances in our system. But there are no checks on Obama. The guy escapes srutiny. </p>

			<p>To Tom S.,</p>
<p>Your little story isn&rsquo;t &#8220;off subject&#8221; at all. It perfectly fits with the second comment above (4:49) about blacks having doubts about Obama, or feeling that there is something unreal about him. </p>
<p>If the 4:49 poster is correct, and black turnout doesn&rsquo;t surge, then the numbers do indeed look much worse for Obama. Large black turnout is something the Democrats are counting on.</p>

			<p>Lets see&hellip;.how many politicians in history can be described as<br>
&#8220;well meaning&#8221;? In fact there seems to be a relationship between how vague, dreamy, and idealistic a politician is..and the damage he ends up doing. Communism was the most idealistic<br>
dream ever&hellip;class free society, rule by workers, no more privleges, struggle for freedom and equality.</p>
<p>Look at those slogans..and listen to the Obama pablum.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m not hearing too much about Obama. In fact, I&rsquo;m not hearing anything about Obama because I don&rsquo;t watch TV or listen to commercial talk radio or read mainstream newspapers or magazines.  That&rsquo;s the funny thing about these politicians; they&rsquo;re all media creatures. I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a real Obama out there somewhere, but as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, he&rsquo;s nothing but a pattern of electrons on a cathode-ray tube.

			<p>One of the less responsible aspects of the media&rsquo;s grovelling to Obama is the fact that they are hyping his election as it is a certainty.  Even if the opinion polls are accurate, people are notorious for saying one thing when it comes to race and then voting in a completely different manner.  If he doesn&rsquo;t get elected, people who have been convinced it is a sure thing will be outraged, and riots and conspiracy theories about another &#8220;stolen election&#8221; will be widespread.</p>
<p>What makes anyone imagine a one-term freshman senator is qualified to be President of the US, anyway?  Bush II and Clinton were unmitigated disasters, and they at least had experience as state governors.  All Obama has done is make vague statements about how the country &#8220;needs to move foreward&#8221; without explaining what he means by that.  What do the unthinking robots in the press think he&rsquo;s going to be able to accomplish?  Lower gas prices?  Impossible.  For that to happen, we would have to renew offshore drilling and build more refineries, since our refineries are operating at capacity.  It would take at least a dozen years before this would have any effect at all on gasoline prices, and even as a two-termer, Obama would have at most eight years.  Since Presidential elections are usually referenda on the state of the economy, I see no chance that Obama will be elected to a second term, even if he gets one, simply since I see no chance the economy will recover during the next four years.</p>
<p>An Obama Presidency wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily be all bad.  At the very least, a McCain defeat would send a strong signal to Republican candidates that they dare not annoy conservative voters by pandering to the illegal alien lobby, a practice that does not attract as many black and brown voters as the white ones it drives away.  The severe down-side would be the insane Supreme Court judges he would be likely to appoint.</p>

			<p>In spite of the best efforts of the leftist national media to push Barak into the White House, I think something else quite surprising may happen.</p>
<p>I think his support will wain in the next eight weeks, and by the time he gets to the convention, his poll numbers will be weak enough to change super-delegate minds, and Hillary will call for her own convention nomination vote - and win.</p>
<p>Then we&rsquo;ll get back to excessive media idolization of Hillary.</p>
<p>Thus, such events will upgrade the country&rsquo;s election coverage Punch N&rsquo; Judy show from nauseating to slightly more amusing.</p>

			<p>How would blacks vote if Alan Keyes were the nominee?  He, in my opinion, bested Obama in the Illinois senate debates, all if which can be seen on youtube.</p>

			<p>The only ones applauding Obama in this clip are the lighter audience members.  I hate to tell black folks but they just may be getting screwed by their politicians, too!</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re on and on about Obama being unqualified and handing everything over to blacks and other minorities but my two  questions to everyone on this site is:</p>
<p>Have our &#8220;own&#8221; really performed or done anything differently?  Is this an overall better place to live in each passing year?</p>

			<p>HOPEFULLY, the &#8220;public&#8221; will vote its displeasure this coming November   &mdash;   by VOTING AGAINST Obama. Who is nothing but a media creation. A man with no substance. No message. No real plan. A man who, like his wife, is a closet anti-White racist. A liar and an utter and complete phony. No more, no less!</p>

<p>We really need to lay to rest the myth of the black conservative.  Liberal organizations are overflowing with blacks and some of them can make a lucrative career for themselves if they simply switch sides where they are under represented.  Thomas Sowell did an article recently about how he knew conservatives who were planning on voting for Obama.  No doubt they were all black but the article sounded like a pitch to Whites for Obama.  There is no loyalty there either.  I have little doubt that Rice, Sowell, Watts, Keyes and the whole lot of them will vote for Obama this November.</p>

			<p>I didn&rsquo;t think it could get any worse than George Bush vs. John Kerry until this election cycle came along.  John McCain is a very dangerous man and I do not want to see him in the White House.  Whenever he sends me a beg letter I use the business reply envelope to send him a Ron Paul slim jim.  But true to form the Democrats gave us a pro-illegal alien socialist who thinks we don&rsquo;t have enough affirmative action or high enough taxes.  So yes, I&rsquo;m sick of hearing about Obama, but that sure doesn&rsquo;t mean I want to hear any more about McCain.</p>
