						<p>There were no takers in San Diego Tuesday for a trial self-deportation program initiated by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p>
<p>Under &ldquo;Operation Scheduled Departure,&rdquo; which began Tuesday, immigrants who have not complied with a final order of deportation are being asked to turn themselves in to federal immigration officials with the promise that they will not be placed in custody and can schedule their own departure date within 90 days.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The pilot program, which is being tried in five cities including San Diego, ends Aug. 22.</p>
<p>The program has generated skepticism and even ridicule from critics since it was announced. Baker said that while no prospective deportees showed up Tuesday at ICE offices in the federal building at 880 Front St. in downtown San Diego, about five people sought information for family members.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Angel Martinez, a construction worker in Charlotte, N.C., told the AP he did not think the program would work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would have to be crazy &mdash; who would want to turn themselves in?&rdquo; Martinez said. &ldquo;Nobody wants to go back. We risked everything to get here for a reason.&rdquo;<br>

			<p>I wish mexicans and other mestizons from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua would develop their own countries instead of soaking off of our predominantly white created America. Mestizo activists and hippies are primarily the problem for allowing them here and ruining it.</p>

<p>And why would there be? Why would people who have entered the &#8220;promised land&#8221;, compared to where they were living, want to leave? </p>

			<p> This is a stupid idea  created for those who do not want to enforce the laws. Seems there can be no dicipline- everyone has to be nice nice.  No accountability, no punishment, no DP, no law enforcement (only fines).  So what are we paying ICE/DHS/ etc for?   Nothing.  They are buried in excuses, no one is responsible/accountable.  Everyone is drinking kool aid and if you dont you wont be counted.  How many people are employed to protect USA???  Why are we taxed to pay for nonperformance.??  <br>
Ex:  9/11, illegal immigrant murders on BP, Police, innocent children &amp; parents, millions still coming (committing frauds) into USA little is accomplished 7 years later. Feds/States make US pay to house, feed, educate, &amp; medicate them.    V</p>

<p>No? Geez, why am I not surprised? Is there ANYONE here who actually thought they would voluntarily turn themselves in? You want to get illegal aliens, go to Wal-Mart on welfare check day, throw a net over the place, and put the whole catch on a bus to the border.</p>

<p>1) What did they have to lose?</p>
<p>2) How risky is it for Mexicans to get into the U.S.? Tens of millions seem to have made it with very little problem. </p>

<p>WHOEVER thought this one up should be FIRED and DEPORTED himself!</p>
<p>Under &ldquo;Operation Scheduled Departure,&rdquo; which began Tuesday, immigrants who have not complied with a final order of deportation are being asked to turn themselves in to federal immigration officials with the promise that they will not be placed in custody and can schedule their own departure date within 90 days&hellip;</p>
<p>RIGHT!&hellip;they haven&rsquo;t complied with the ORDER of the courts already&hellip;and they THINK these people will VOLUNTARILY go?&hellip;exactly WHAT PLANET do these geniuses come from?</p>
<p>The program has generated skepticism and even ridicule from critics since it was announced. Baker said that while no prospective deportees showed up Tuesday at ICE offices in the federal building at 880 Front St. in downtown San Diego, about five people sought information for family members&hellip;</p>
<p>And&hellip;these &#8220;family members&#8221; seeking &#8220;information&#8221;?&hellip;did ANYBODY bother the check THEIR legal status?&hellip;probably NOT!</p>
<p>Angel Martinez, a construction worker in Charlotte, N.C., told the AP he did not think the program would work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would have to be crazy &mdash; who would want to turn themselves in?&rdquo; Martinez said. &ldquo;Nobody wants to go back. We risked everything to get here for a reason.&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>Hello ICE?&hellip;their is an ILLEGAL in Charlotte, N.C.!&hellip;WAITING to be PICKED UP!&hellip;hello?</p>
