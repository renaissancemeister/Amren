						<p>A Fine Gael frontbencher who sparked a wave of controversy with his call for the &#8220;segregation&#8221; of immigrant children until they learnt English remained defiant last night.</p>
<p>Immigrant groups described the comments of Fine Gael education spokesman Brian Hayes as &#8220;highly irresponsible and offensive&#8221;, while a DCU lecturer said the call was &#8220;clearly, although maybe not intentionally, racist in nature&#8221;.</p>
<p>Mr Hayes said this was a complete over-reaction to his demand for changes to the teaching of immigrant children.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a serious issue that has been raised by teachers and it has to be taken seriously, not in a childish way that some academic wants to raise,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He argued that immigrant children were being &#8220;left behind&#8221; at Junior and Leaving Certificate level under the current system of fewer than four hours of English language teaching per week.</p>
<p>Fianna Fail Dublin South East TD Chris Andrews added to the debate, saying that he believed that &#8220;segregation&#8221; was already happening. He called for a quota system to address the problem.</p>
<p>But DCU lecturer Dr James O&rsquo;Higgins-Norman, who attacked Mr Hayes&rsquo; &#8220;clearly racist&#8221; comments, said segregating children on the basis of ability in reading and writing had been shown in research to affect their socialisation with other students.</p>
<p>The New Communities Partnership, which carries out integration work with immigrants, also criticised the call for segregation as &#8220;highly irresponsible and offensive&#8221;.</p>
<p>Its spokesman, Issah Huseini, said it would be better to provide after-school and weekend English language classes for immigrant children and their parents.</p>
<p><b>Immersion</b></p>
<p>The Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland (ASTI) reiterated its call for English language &#8220;immersion courses&#8221;, which would see immigrant children who did not speak the language temporarily taught apart in secondary schools.</p>
<p>&#8220;This would encourage the speedy integration of these students into the school community and into mainstream subject classes,&#8221; a spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>The ASTI once again said that it was strongly opposed to segregation, and that it had always worked for the integration of immigrant children in the education system.</p>
<p>And John Carr, general secretary of the Irish National Teachers Organisation, which represents primary teachers, said the call for the &#8220;segregation&#8221; of immigrant children was &#8220;discriminatory, inequitable and deeply flawed&#8221;.<br>

			<p>I am already appalled at all the dark skinned people we are being presented with as our English experts, reporters, hosts, etc., with English accents.  Now, we will have to endure the same regarding that most delicate of all English accents; the Irish lilt.  But I hope the Irish figure out that their little Island with its special Irish culture and regional accents and Gaeltach regions will disappear if they settle the nation with Afrians and other non-White, non Irish.  Will the Irish lasses really be as naive and idiotic as all the rest?</p>

			<p>  Failure to segregate children who do not speak the local language slows all other children&rsquo;s learning.<br>
  Failure to segregate children according to ability makes the slower children HATE the brightest and results in life long resentment. <br>
  Even 30 years after leaving a high school where all levels were forced into single classes I still must deal with HATE from the slower and the AVERAGE minds.<br>
  Only 2 months ago there was a drunken attempt to kill me by a man who was in my class at a local high school. His STATED reason to me and to the police was: &#8220;You always read your lessons and you made me feel stupid. &#8220;<br>
  I have physical injuries which were caused by jealous university students who blockaded the door and set fire to my dorm room.  They pled guilty and the reason was: &#8220;No one should be that smart.&#8221;  Other assaults followed and some other very bright students were killed by other students for being &#8220;too smart.&#8221; That the violent envious students used drugs and were drinking is no excuse.<br>
   Yes, I was the youngest student on campus.<br>

			<p>It&rsquo;s also &#8216;racism&rsquo; to have them immigrate. The more people of color move in, the more racism there will be. You can guarantee it. </p>

			<p>After all, who cares about educating students at school?  That was an obviously archaic notion.  The real purpose of all those Irish education taxes is to force racial integration and multicult indoctrination.  One need only take a brief glance at the US to see just how successful that policy has been.</p>
<p>Poor old Ireland, that it has come to this utterly failed policy in the name of &#8220;diversity&#8221;.  I was once foolish enough to actually believe that the goal of education was learning, not social engineering.  After over half a century of forced integration at all costs in the US, I should have known better. </p>

This is indeed true. There may not be any overt actions that can be pointed out as racist, but you can bet the Whites will resent the non-whites more and more, and the non-whites will know this. After a certain point is reached the non-whites WILL indulge in overt, criminal attacks upon their White neighbors just as they do in the United States, Canada, Australia and in England.</p>

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~</p>
<p>As a sympathetic but uninvolved foreigner, although of Irish blood, I quietly note the irony of someone representing &#8220;Fine Gael&#8221; demanding English classes.<br>
But it makes sense,though.  So be it.</p>

Yes. How often I read newspaper articles now, written by some reporter with an unrecognizable, even unpronouncible, name&hellip; a exotic name not derived from any European source. Yet, they are now (and so quickly too!) in positions to be feeding us our information   &mdash;   telling us what we should know and what we should think.</p>
