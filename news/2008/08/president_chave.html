					<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fidel Eduardo Orozco (Gerardo Cárdenas, translator), El Universal Daily News (Venezuela), August 13, 2008</i></p>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez said on Monday that the subcontinent must cease to be called Latin America and should be renamed Indo-America, to honor the roots of its native inhabitants.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us start using this term ( &hellip; ); such concept of Latin America was imposed on us,&#8221; Chávez said. By saying Indian America or Indo-America &#8220;we are including the black American and the white European because we do not exclude anyone. ( &hellip; ) For that reason, everyday I speak less and less of Hispanic America, or Latin America. We are from Indo-America, from Afro-America. That is what we are, instead of any other name,&#8221; Chávez said.</p>
<p>The president made these remarks at the closing ceremony of the First Bolivarian and Indo-American Congress &#8220;Indigenous Young Warriors against Poverty and Imperialism,&#8221; which took place on Monday night at the Municipal Theater of Caracas, after three days of discussions.</p>
<p>The event was attended by a group of international delegates, whom the Venezuelan president urged to plan a Second Congress. He said that the Congress should be carried out every year in a different venue, from Canada to Argentina.</p>
<p>Chávez also suggested them to &#8220;make proposals, requests or petitions to the authorities (of their countries). That way,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we will commit to the needs of our indigenous peoples.&#8221; The Venezuelan head of state invited them to bring their proposals to international organizations such as the Organization of American States (OAS) and the United Nations (UN).</p>
<p>In a talk via satellite, Bolivian President Evo Morales thanked Venezuela for its support and solidarity. Chávez described his counterpart as a &#8220;regional leader.&#8221; &#8220;Evo must be declared the President of all the Indigenous peoples of this continent; he must be the leader of Indo-America.&#8221;</p>
<p>In another contact, Manuel Mariñas, the president of Simón Rodríguez University, said in an interview with the Venezuelan state-run TV channel Venezolana de Televisión (VTV) that the Venezuelan university is planning to create a campus in southern Amazonas state for indigenous communities.<br>

			<p>Doesn&rsquo;t this marxist shill know the word &#8220;America&#8221; is from an the name of an Italian explorer?  He resents &#8220;latin&#8221; but not &#8220;america&#8221;.<br>
Did he attend school in the USA inner cities?</p>
<p>Maybe we American Renaissance readers can help him come up with an appropriate name.  Does anyone know the indigenous language phrase for &#8220;degenerate slobs ruled by marxist dictator&#8221;?</p>

			<p> I will say I agree with Chavez as far as changing the name to Indo-America. I always thought Latin America was a slap in the face to all Latin people. Latins are a high-thinking and very intelligent people. Comparing Latins and Latin Americans is the same as comparing apples and oranges.</p>

			<p>Here in Europe WN are constantly going on about how Europe is theirs (and I agree it is). But as someone with a bit of seminole blood in them I feel it is time the native Americans fought harder to win back THEIR continents.  </p>

			<p>A more accurate name would be &#8220;Third World Indians in the Southern Western Hemisphere&#8221;. But, I think the goal of this renaming idiocy is feel-good politics, not accuracy.</p>

			<p>Ironically, he is absolutely correct - I welcome it.  Italians are the real Latins, as are Spaniards.  I have always been proud of being half Latin, i.e. part descendent of the Roman people, and part Anglo-American.  The vast majority of people in Latin America (especially outside Argentina and Chile) are not &#8220;latin&#8221; in any meaningful way - they are native Indians.  Americans, with our monumental ignorance of history, are always confussed about the origins of these words.  If a LA dictator, following Castro, turns on the white ruling class, the issues of race will be brought to the forefront in LA (Indo-America) and begin to clarify matters.  </p>

			<p>And North America will become &#8220;Indo-North America&#8221;.  And then they will discover (excuse that word) that America is from &#8220;Amerigo Vespucci&#8221;, an Italian.  And that will have to go.  Any suggestions?</p>

			<p>I suppose eventually he&rsquo;ll change the name of his country to an &#8220;Indo&#8221; name, since Venezuela is a European name:</p>

<p>And BTW, &#8220;India&#8221; comes from Indus, the Persian name for Hindu.<br>

			<p>Great news for Europe.  The great identifier Latin can be returned to its rightful owners.  &#8220;They&#8221; never were Latin to begin with.  How about stripping them of all their modern European conveniences as well?<br>

			<p>Well thank the good Lord that some mestizo has finally demanded that the name of Latino be changed to something way more appropriate of &#8220;Indo-America.&#8221;  I welcome the news that the antiwhite and antiAmerican Hugo Chavez wants the change. This change should be welcoming to all those like me who really think there should be a defining racial barometer between the dark, swarthy mestizo indians and the real Latinos of white European descent like a lot of those of Uruguay, Chile and Argentina.   I can&rsquo;t stand it when some dark complected mexican girl, for example, is elevated to something classier sounding in &#8220;Latina.&#8221;</p>
<p>THis is wrong. You can say that a garbage pit is a beautiful rose garden, but it is still a garbage pit.</p>
<p>Living here in mexifornia, I can tell you definitively that a white Spaniard is not the same as some mestizo gardener.<br>

			<p>I&rsquo;d like to see Mestizos deconfused with Romans as well.  The Romans were the ones who built the Hardian and Antoinine Walls to keep the meanest people in the world - my Scottish ancestors - out of Roman-occupied Britain.  I saw it when I was 17.  That summer, I also saw a Roman fort at Hardknott Pass, in northern Yorkshire, south of the Wall, built to to send men to intercept the Scots who came over.  My friend and I swam across Conniston Water and back the day before.</p>
<p>The Romans, by all accounts, had plenty of guts, but when three legions went north of the Wall, nobody went home.</p>

			<p>Personally, I sincerely believe it should be called MESTIZOLAND, because that term more accurately reflects the true mixed population.  Indo-America is inaccurate.  </p>
<p>The name has to include all the races that comprise the inhabitants, not just indians.  Making reference to just indians is misleading and inaccurate.</p>

<p>Actually, it would be Asia-America, since the original inhabitants first came from Asia. However, most &#8220;latin americans&#8221; in mexico, central or s.america are mixed with indian and spaniard blood, though some are pure spaniard or other european and some pure indian.<br>

			<p>Mr. Hugo Chavez is just trying to promote the &#8220;One Continent&#8221; Theory, which is completely false. I know he wants to claim even Canada and Alaska for the Brown Hispanics (and a consequential North and South American Empire), but Indigenous Canadians are genetically different from the residents of the Equator. I have seen pictures of Crees (in Northeastern Canada), and they look more Asian, and even Caucasian, than they do Venzeulean or Peruvian. The Brown Hispanics are also not genetically designed to reside in the Canadian Tundra. This would be like a Dane claiming the whole Middle East and North Africa for Denmark and Europe.</p>
<p>I can also bet, Mr. Chavez could care less about the Iroquois, Crees, and Inuits mantaining real racial purity. </p>

			<p>The &#8220;Indo&#8221; in &#8220;Indo-America&#8221; is also a European imposition, as is, presumably, the only language Chavez speaks, not to mention just about everything else he employs in daily life, down to and including the light bulbs he turns on. Whiny little leftists like Hugo are always very selective in which aspects of Euro impositions they&rsquo;re willing to discard.</p>

			<p>Hugo Chavez, behind the Marxist rhetoric, is politically an advocate for his people, the aboriginal Americans, or Indians.  (Note: I am a NATIVE American.  I was born in the U.S. to parents who were citizens and the grandchildren of citizens.  Don&rsquo;t let the multicultural Reds use our language against us.)  Most of Indo-America is just that, Brown people ruled by a White elite.  Even their revolutionary movements are run by Whites.  The Indians have every reason to resent White rule.  I recommend Amy Chua&rsquo;s book, &#8220;World On Fire&#8221; for a good summary.  <br>
     I would make Chavez an offer: Expropriate every White in the Indian majority countries and deport them to the U.S.  In return, we will deport all of his kinsmen to the Brown paradise of their choice.  A fair trade, as long as the new Iberian-Americans arrive penniless, and receive no consideration for their inability to speak English.  Let them start over at the bottom, where they can assimilate or starve.  </p>

			<p>Interesting that Chavez looks to honor the &#8220;native&#8221; inhabitants of his region and remove an &#8220;imposed&#8221; designation by substituting a equally imposed and erroneous one.</p>
<p>After all, &#8220;Indo&#8221; and &#8220;Indian&#8221; belong to the subcontinent&hellip;.</p>

			<p>Hugo Chavez is an idiot.The term INDO is also of european origin.Columbus assumed he had discoverd a passage to India.That is why we call the Sibero-americans americans indians. Many Mexicans are proud of their Latin Heritage even though they are pure blooded indians.Do you know that the Mexican Pinata is actually Italian.</p>

			<p>But &#8220;Indo&#8221; is derived from &#8220;Indus&#8221; - which, is derived from the Old Persian term &#8220;Hindu&#8221;.  This comes from the Sanskrit word &#8220;Sindhu&#8221; - the historic name for the Indus River!</p>

			<p>To really know where Chavez is coming from, you have to literally look at the man, and look closely at his physical features.</p>
<p>He is a Sambo: neither white nor black nor indian. He is considered the lowest of the low. If this were India, his race would be considered &#8216;untouchable&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Spaniards, Portuguese, Italians, French, and Romanians are considered Latin, as not only the languages are firmly rooted in Latin, but they were Roman provinces centuries ago.</p>
<p>I, for one, have always thought of Latin Americans as the whites who can trace their blood back to the west. For those whose ancestry is 100% Spanish, I consider Spaniards.</p>
<p>You can change the language, but a black will continue being a black, an indian an indian, and a Sambo like Chavez a genetic abomination.</p>

&#8220;We are from Indo-America, from Afro-America. That is what we are, instead of any other name,&rdquo; Chávez said&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
To call this part of the world &#8220;Indo-America&#8221; is dodgy and troublesome enough, but MAYBE intellectually defensible. MAYBE. But to call the region &#8220;Afro-America&#8221; is plainly preposterous. Left to their own devices, the indigenous peoples of Africa wouldn&rsquo;t be aware that the indigenous peoples of the Americas EVEN EXIST. </p>
<p>Or vice versa. </p>
<p>For the very simple reason that their rafts and canoes wouldn&rsquo;t reach that far. </p>
<p>This is nothing more than an anti-gringo racist demogogue&rsquo;s attempt to unite browns and blacks against Big Bad Whitey: rhetorical sabre-rattling that is as craven as it is futile. And it will be no more fruitful for Chavez than the &#8220;Rainbow Coalition&#8221; was for Jesse Jackson. <br>

			<p>Maybe Chavez could change his name as well and starting learning an indian language too. This way he would lead by example.<br>
 I, as a spaniard, always thought that the only latins were us, italians, portuguese, french and romanians not those &#8220;mestizos&#8221; that move to USA.</p>

			<p>Actually, I welcome this move, as it will only seek to awaken people to demographic and ethnographic truths.<br>
  I believe the title &#8216;Latin America&rsquo; was first devised by the French emperor Napoleon III, in the 19th century, at a time when France (wary of Britain) was eager to build up colonial and poltical influence of its own and so exaggerated a &#8216;commonality&rsquo; of language and culture with the continent in order to gain influence.<br>
  The word &#8216;Latin&rsquo; strictly spaking refer to one particular Italianate tribe of ancient times that resided in west-central Italy.They were only one amongst many eg Samnites, Oscans, Etruscans, Sabines etc, but succesfully managed to impose their language on the whole peninsula.</p>

			<p>I agree with everyone cheering Chavez on here. But I think that the Latin American word is Zambo. A Zambo is a cross between a Black and an Indian. People with Black, Indian and White blood are very common in Venezuela, Panama, Puerto Rico, Colombia and even Brazil. In this part of the continent, there were lots of slaves, most of the Indians survived and there were only a few Whites. In the rest of the continent, not so common. Chavez himself is 50% White, 25% Indian and 25% Black. That&rsquo;s quite a common phenotype down in Venezuela. </p>
<p>It is interesting to note that the average Mexican mestizo in Mexico is about 3-5% Black also.</p>
<p>&#8220;Latin America&#8221; is absurd. There are not that many pure Whites down there and there are not even that many majority-White folks. Latin America is an experiment in mestizaje writ large across an entire continent. </p>

I remember  once complimenting a waiter in Argentina on the best meal that I had had in Latin America.  (It was such a pleasure to get really <i> good </i> food    &mdash;    for a change.)</p>
<p>He politely corrected me:  &#8220;Thank you, but we are not Latin Americans. We are European.&#8221;</p>
<p>After that, I knew better.</p>

			<p>As an american who spends about 2 months a year in central and south america and who has learned spanish I can say that its not all indians who live there. Almost of the upper classes, say 10% of the population, are descendants of europeans. Another 10ish % only have the slightest traces of indo blood, could still pass as white. Another 10-15% are primarily white but mixed more. The rest are indo-afros. For example, look at recent presidents of mexico, costa rica and colombia, non withstanding the polital elites of the more white countries such as chile and argentina. Vincente Fox of mexico, Arias of costa rica and Uribe of colombia as far as looks go could pass as an american president. These men are examples of the upper classes that have been in power since the conquistadors. With the whites in power most things go well and fortunes can be made there. Make no mistake, there are grand fortunes in these countries  both land based and manufacturing of the likes of the gilded age in the usa. But as soon as the indians such as Chavez and Morales have the power they almost without fail change things to a marxist state and do all within thier power to eliminate the upper classes such as land reforms and nationalation of industries. Then the economy fails and is blamed on the capitalists. Even with all the oil money Venezuela is rapidly going down. But the indian population, not unlike the blacks anywhere else are easily led and exited by one of thier own who is sticking it to whitey/ upper class  irrespective of the fact that they are far worse off than when the euros ran things. Zimbabwe rhodesia is a perfect example of what we have to look forward to when the euros are put down. I cant see this trend changing anytime soon when the electorate majority is poor and stupid. This is why the orignal framers of america only let the literate or landowners vote. They werent so dumb after all, why are we so dumb now&hellip;.   KF           </p>

Good for you, Schoolteacher!   I am very tired of seeing that PC term, &#8220;Native American&#8221;.   I don&rsquo;t use it and I refuse to recognize it.  If you were BORN here, you are a NATIVE of America.  I know what they mean, of course.  But why don&rsquo;t they just say it?  As they use the term, it implies that you are an intruder who has no legitimate right to be here.</p>
<p>There are alternative terms that would be valid (eg. aboriginal Americans) but  they (the ideological Left) deliberately twist terms in order to  obscure the issues (like calling illegal aliens &#8220;immigrants&#8221;   &mdash;   a usage so common by now that the whole media has fallen for it).  Anyway, I see nothing wrong with the term &#8220;American Indians&#8221;.  It is not pejorative. It&rsquo;s established by long usage and history, and I continue to use it.  As for me, I am a &#8220;native&#8221; American.</p>
<p>We must not let them control our language. Controlling language is controlling thought.</p>

			<p>Great news for Europe. The great identifier Latin can be returned to its rightful owners. &ldquo;They&rdquo; never were Latin to begin with. <br>
Posted by GetBackJack <br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.<br>
True.  They never were.</p>
<p>The term &#8220;Latin America&#8221; was originally a propaganda term coined by Napoleon. When Napoleon&rsquo;s troops invaded  Iberia, the Spanish monarchy fled to exile in England. (And the Portuguese to Brazil).  The colonies in South America were left with no government in the home countries, and the British Navy assumed a protectorate (and a blockade) over all of South America to keep the French out.  Napoleon, in a brilliant stroke of propaganda, invented the term  &#8220;Latin&#8221; America to win sympathy for France in its death struggle with Great Britain, seeking to emphasize their common Latin roots (with France).   Of course, this was aimed at the educated and influential classes there, and it was to these that Napoleon appealed.  Regardless of the Afro-Indian base of the population, the reigning language, religion, and culture were of Latin origin.   The term caught on and stuck    &mdash;   however inaccurate, especially nowadays when it means all but nothing.</p>
<p>I want to add a side comment, that Señor Chavez, in attempting to erase the European imprint, neglects to note that the African element is no more indigenous to America than the European.  If anything, it is less so, having been brought in,<i> by </i>Europeans, <i> after </i> the European discoveries, and not  even having gotten here by their own means.</p>
<p>Why does he ignore that fact?   &mdash;   unless he is simply anti-white.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if he wants to erase what is European, is he prepared to give up ALL that Europeans brought and essentially go back to the Stone Age?</p>
<p>The  proposed  term  &#8220;Indo-America&#8221; is nothing original on Chavez&rsquo; part.  I had seen that  many years ago in a book about race printed under the auspices of the United Nations.  There were other suggested terms too, which I can&rsquo;t offhand remember. It&rsquo;s an old issue.</p>
<p>I commend our poster &#8220;Spaniard&#8221; for making a particularly significant point:  <br>
<i>&#8220;To really know where Chavez is coming from, you have to look closely at his physical features.  He is a Sambo: neither white nor black nor Indian.&#8221;</i> I believe that explains a great deal.</p>

<p>I strongly disagree, apples and oranges are both delicious and healthful foods.  Latins and the aboridginal/mestizo inhabited nations south of our border are better compared as filet mignon to .</p>
<p>As for my name suggestion, how about &#8220;The Aboriginal Nations of the Western Hemisphere.&#8221;  America should be reserved for North America at least and only the U.S. at best.  But what number of ethnic sub-nations we may likely end up being is another issue for deep ponderng.</p>

			<p>This communist indigenous Indian clearly believes he is the ruler of all of central and south America if he believes they will change their names on his command.<br>
  <br>
Venezuelans were crazy enough to elect their first indigenous Indian for president and have been paying the price of their folly ever since.  Universally minorities in position of authority always abuse that authority, because they want to punish the majority for being superior in every way.</p>
<p>I do, however, agree with calling all the land south of our southern border anything but &#8220;Latin America&#8221;.  The Latins were the Italians, a people who accomplished many great things, whereby Latin Americans have accomplished next to nothing.  The word &#8220;Latino&#8221; is Spanish for &#8220;Latin&#8221;.  Hispanics and Latins have as much in common as a gerbil has in common with a giraffe&hellip;          </p>

			<p>This sort of word-gaming has tremendous appeal to a certain type of thick-headed, closed-minded, just-barely-educated Latino. I was explaining in an adult education class once the English names for the five continents, and a particularly obnoxious young Mexican women who was constantly finding fault with everything I said and did began arguing (in Spanish) that there was no North or South America; only &#8220;America&#8221; and whites don&rsquo;t belong there.</p>
<p>No amount of appeal to logic would shut her up. I tried explaining patiently that Europe and Asia were connected, and that even Africa was connected to Asia by the Isthmus of Suez. It was just the conventional way of discussing large land masses, that&rsquo;s all. We were talking about the vocabulary of geography, not politics. If you want people to understand what you&rsquo;re talking about, you have to use the accepted terminology&hellip;</p>
<p>All to no avail. Finally, with cellphone in hand and ready to call the campus police, I told her to leave the room. She sulked, made several insults under her breath (in Spanish), and settled down.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;d insisted on kicking her out, the only person who&rsquo;d have ended up in trouble would have been ME; I&rsquo;d have been reprimanded for bringing up controversial topics in the classroom! So I let her sit and sulk, and marveled at the limitations a thought process that amounts to nothing more than memorizing and reciting slogans imposes on the mind.</p>

			<p>&#8220;It is interesting to note that the average Mexican mestizo in Mexico is about 3-5% Black also.&#8221;</p>
<p>Robert Lindsay</p>
<p>I heard that the average resident of Northern Mexico may even be about 8% Black. This believed information came from Steven Sailer. A less supportable, but possible theory is that some residents in Southern Mexico may be about 20% Black.</p>

<p>I agree, the English language has been twisted around by the left and we are forced to use their invented terms. We should do the same. Why not call illegal aliens or all non-whites as &lsquo;foreign invaders&rsquo; from now on.<br>

			<p>EA Steve: The Blackest Mexicans are in the South. I really doubt if the Mexicans in the North are 8% Black. That stretches credulity. The Mexicans in the North are the Whitest Mexicans of them all. I don&rsquo;t think Chavez is really anti-White. He&rsquo;s probably 1/2 White himself. He&rsquo;s taking a stab at the White oligarchy down there that has been running the show since day one. In Venezuela, they are not so much White as lighter skinned. And in the upper middle class in Venezuela, you find some Blacks, mulattos and lots of Mestizos. It&rsquo;s more about class than race down there.</p>
<p>The one constant in Latin America is that the Indians have been royally screwed from Day One, and to a lesser extent, the Mestizos themselves. And it&rsquo;s that lighter-skinned upper class that he calls the oligarchs that have been doing the screwing. He&rsquo;s trying to appeal to the Indians&rsquo; and mestizos&rsquo; resentment of this oligarchy. Many of Chavez&rsquo; top advisors are light-skinned.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Maybe Chavez could change his name as well and starting learning an indian language too. This way he would lead by example.<br>
I, as a spaniard, always thought that the only latins were us, italians, portuguese, french and romanians not those &ldquo;mestizos&rdquo; that move to USA.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because we are.  The average American doesn&rsquo;t know that fact.  That&rsquo;s why &#8220;latino&#8221; is a vulgarization of &#8220;Latin American&#8221; just like &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; which is a misnomer.  &#8220;Latino&#8221; and &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; are both misnomers purposely used by the US government to label the dark people from Latin America within the US borders to keep track of them.  Of course, I hate being lumped in with so-called &#8220;latinos&#8221; or &#8220;hispanics&#8221; because I&rsquo;m of European descent who happened to be born in Argentina.   Argetina has a legacy of being an immigrant country with people mainly from European countries and those of us from Argentina who consider ourselves &#8220;latino&#8221; are those who have Latin European descent, meaning of Italian or of Spanish descent or a combination thereof.  &#8220;Latino&#8221; is merely a vulgarization of the what now they consider the darker-skinned mixed races of people from Latin America.  &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; is such a bad term it should be discarded by now.</p>
<p>Chavez has his head up his arse.  This why I hate Marxists here and abroad.  I heard their case in Argentina and they sound like the black power idiots here.  Same deal.</p>

<p>This is what I&rsquo;ve been trying to tell people for some time.  Unfortunately, &#8220;democracy&#8221; is bringing &#8220;diversity&#8221; to Argentina now with immigration from China and at least six different countries from black Africa.  If there is a time to fight for our race in a physical way, the time is now.  Some lands are too sacred to just let go.</p>
