<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>A judge ruled Friday that there&rsquo;s enough evidence for Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick to stand trial on two felony assault charges stemming from a confrontation with two investigators.</p>
<p>The investigators testified that an angry Kilpatrick shoved one of them into the other and made racial remarks while they were trying to deliver a subpoena in the mayor&rsquo;s perjury case to one of Kilpatrick&rsquo;s friends last month.</p>
<p>In his ruling in 36th District Court, Judge Ronald Giles said there was no question Kilpatrick was aware that Wayne County sheriff&rsquo;s Detective Brian White and county prosecutor&rsquo;s investigator JoAnn Kinney were at the home where the confrontation took place on official business.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>White said the mayor shoved him into Kinney when he was trying to deliver the subpoena. He and White also testified that Kilpatrick used profanity and made a racial remark during the alleged confrontation.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&rsquo;re a black woman,&#8221; Kinney said the mayor told her. &#8220;You should be ashamed of yourself being with a man with the last name white. You should not be a part of this.&#8221;</p>
<p>The mayor and Kinney are black. White is white.</p>
<p>Kilpatrick&rsquo;s attorneys have denied an assault took place.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a black woman,&rdquo; Kinney said the mayor told her. &ldquo;You should be ashamed of yourself being with a man with the last name white. You should not be a part of this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just keep in mind that he would have went even more ballistic if she were eating Angel Food Cake at the time also.</p>
<p>This is just standard rhetoric and the average anti-white attitude of almost all blacks.  Their hate knows no bounds.  No matter how much whitey gives them or supports them they continue to hate him with all their hearts. </p>
<p>This is the lesson that white radicals refuse to acknowledge, and, of course, it could well mean they will be in denial up until their doors are kicked in and partytime begins in ernest.</p>

			<p>The mayor of a large U.S. city gets arrested for felony assault.</p>
<p>The mayor of a &#8216;major&rsquo; U.S. city states, </p>
<p>&ldquo;You should be ashamed of yourself being with a man with the last name white.&#8221;</p>
<p>Can anyone imagine what would happen to a White mayor-especially one in a large city who stated the same thing about someone with the name &#8216;Black&rsquo;?  And this was only the man&rsquo;s name.  This man hates &#8216;White&rsquo; even as a surname!!!  This is how far down we have sunk. This is only the beginning.  Only the tip of the iceberg.  What&rsquo;s it going to be like down the road in 10, 20, 50 years when the U.S. is far more &#8216;multiculturalized&rsquo;?  What&rsquo;s it going to be like when we are &#8216;Hispanicized&rsquo; too?  What&rsquo;s it going to be like when Whites are a minority in their own land?  This is only the beginning my friends.  Only the beginning.</p>

			<p>Some think blacks deserve reparations for slavery.Ok,we should give them all of Detroit and throw in a bit of adjacent farmland(remember 40 acres and a mule?).Those of other races would be helped to resettle elsewhere if they wished.Greater Detroit could be expanded as the word of a black sanctuary free of the horrors of white racism,a promised land,beckoned to the oppressed.Free at last!A perfect world with Mayor Kwame at the helm&hellip;and then I wake up.</p>

			<p>I would have loved to have been the officer delivering this subpoena.  A few years back I served a stint as a law enforcement officer and I loved situations like this.  You know, ones where you were supposed to show a rediculous amount of restraint, to forego the escalation of force regardless of how justified it may be.  I would intentionally insert myself into these types of situations and then apply a use of force in accordance with the letter of my department&rsquo;s policy.  And I can tell you, without hesitation, that I would have thumped Mr. Kwame the instant his hand touched my body.  </p>
<p>My favorite thing to do in such a situation would be an inside takedown and as the thug&rsquo;s face was bouncing off the ground I would already be transitioning into an arm-bar and from there fitting him with bracelets.  Worked like a charm, worked every time I tried it.   </p>
<p>I hope that Officer White showed as little restraint when he was shoved as I would have.  My guess is that he wimped out since I didn&rsquo;t read that Kwame was also charged with resisting arrest.</p>

<p>One cannot disguise his smartness</p>
<p>A super-duper information display is installed at the Detroit airport. A man approaches the machine and punches the button. The machine says,<br>
&ldquo;You are Kwame Kilpatrick from Detroit, MI. You flight is at 11:30 a.m.&rdquo; <br>
The man surprises. He takes off his coat, puts on sunglasses and steps up again.<br>
&ldquo;You are Kwame Kilpatrick from Detroit, MI. You flight is at 11:30 a.m.,&rdquo; says the computer.<br>
The man persists. He dons on a long wig, shrouds himself  with a burka. The gadget says,<br>
&ldquo;You are Kwame Kilpatrick from Detroit, MI. You flight is at 11:30 a.m.&rdquo;<br>
The man doesn&rsquo;t give up. He paints his face with white pain, and presses the button another time. The machine, says,<br>
&ldquo;You are Kwame Kilpatrick from Detroit, MI. While you were fooling around me, your airplane has departed.&rdquo;<br>

<p>Height of stupidity! There are tens of thousands of blacks with the last name &#8220;White&#8221;. Are they all going to go and petition the courts for a change of name now? Oh, let&rsquo;s not give them any ideas, because they probably will&hellip;</p>

			<p>  Only in a town like Detroit could a thug felon be elected mayor in the first place. Detroit does need one thing in particular from the federal government. Detroit needs a battalion of bulldozers to push the entire city into a heap and set it alight. Detroit is a disaster that could never be rebuilt regardless of the amount of money spent. Detroit should be regarded as a monument to black rule of a city.</p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s an earlier article that was posted on AmREn, wherein the specifics of the assault are described in more detail:</p>
<p><a href="/news/2008/07/judge_tightens.html" rel="nofollow">/news/2008/07/judge_tightens.php</a></p>
<p>Kilpatrick apparently threw detective White off the porch, and doctors stated that White&rsquo;s hip may have been slightly fractured.</p>
<p>Of course, Hizzoner is presumed innocent.</p>

			<p>Too funny for words, Mayor Kwame (what a joke name in itself) antics. Incredible, when you think about this&hellip; how virtually VERY Afro-American getting elected to a mayoral position either manages to make a complete  out of himself (Kwame) or does the drug scene (Washington&rsquo;s Mayor Berry). In addition to driving the city or town into near-bankruptcy.</p>
<p>So PICTURE what the Obama administration would end up like. Just look at Kwame, Berry, Street, Dinkins or some other equally unsavory Black mayoral failures for an example.</p>

Perhaps you forgot Marion Barry of D.C. and if Detroit hasn&rsquo;t secceeded from the union, let&rsquo;s kick it out and if as another poster suggested, we make Detroit into a free black nation! imagine the bathtub ring around Lake Michiganistan.</p>

			<p>All these events he is involved in are enhancing his resume, he is very much a hero among the black population, if there is a trial, he will be found innocent and eventually run for U.S. Congress and be elected with a overwhelming majority.</p>
