<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>In an interview on National Public Radio last week, Democratic National Committee chairman Howard Dean touted the racial and gender diversity of the Democratic Party to the Republican Party. In what sounded like a slip of the tongue, he momentarily referred to the GOP as the &#8220;white party.&#8221; Paging Dr. Freud.</p>
<p>The McCain campaign pounced on the remark. Carly Fiorina, former CEO of Hewlett-Packard and chair of Victory 2008 &mdash; and one of the highest-ranking females in the McCain campaign &mdash; issued a statement calling Dean&rsquo;s comments &mdash; as if they had been intentional &mdash; &#8221;insulting, inappropriate, and have no place in this election.&#8221;</p>
<p>What Dean said was, &#8220;If you look at folks of color, even women, they&rsquo;re more successful in the Democratic party than they are in the white, uh, excuse me, in, uh, Republican party.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In any case, Dean raised an issue that is rarely discussed in public and almost never by politicians: the marked racial division by party in American politics. Members of the country&rsquo;s largest minority groups &mdash; blacks, Latinos, Asian-Americans &mdash; are predominantly Democratic.</p>
<p>According to 2004 statistics, white Americans are split evenly between the two parties with an equal percentage who are independents. But 90 percent of registered Republicans are white.</p>
<p>These cold numbers are reflected in the audiences Sens. Barack Obama, D-Ill., and John McCain, R-Ariz., attract. In this year&rsquo;s presidential race, a crowd at an Obama public event often looks like a Benetton ad, compared to a McCain event, where the crowds are overwhelmingly white.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For more than 40 years, African-Americans have voted overwhelmingly Democratic for president, by margins of up to 9-to-1. Hispanics and Asian-Americans traditionally vote Democratic, but by smaller margins. A look at voter registration shows that 45 percent of Latinos are Democrats. Just 19 percent are Republican. Forty-one percent of Asian-Americans are Democrats compared to 18 percent, who are Republican. The Democratic party overall is 65 percent white and 35 percent non-white. Ninety percent of registered Republicans are white.</p>
<p>For the Republican Party, these figures may be ominous for the future, if not the present. According to a Census Bureau report last week, the country is rapidly becoming less white. It is projected that, in 2042, whites will makes up less than half of the population.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;McCain has campaigned in the African-American community more than any Republican nominee I know of,&#8221; a McCain senior adviser said, although he conceded that Obama will probably win the black vote by a record margin. &#8220;Obviously, with the first African-American presidential candidate (of a major party), Obama will get a record percentage of the African-American vote. That&rsquo;s logical. That&rsquo;s to be expected.&#8221;</p>
<p>[A senior advisor in the McCain campaign] predicted that McCain would do well &mdash; for a Republican candidate &mdash; with Hispanic voters, projecting that he could get as much as 40 percent of the Latino vote, in part because of his sponsorship of last year&rsquo;s immigration reform bill that went down to defeat.</p>
<p>But, so far, McCain&rsquo;s efforts to diversify his support have not shown very visible results. Visit a McCain public campaign event in, say, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Florida, Ohio &mdash; states with diverse populations &mdash; and chances are the crowd will be 90-plus percent white. In fairness, approximately the same percentages would apply to the media assigned to the two presidential candidates.</p>

			<p>The simple fact of the matter is that whites are 80% of all voters, and the Republican Party gets virtually all of its votes from whites.  Therefore, in all but name, the Republican Party is the White Party.  I just wish the Republicans would start believing, it and acting like it.</p>

			<p>Howard Dean has got to be one of the most sickening politicians on the scene. You would think that a guy who was a doctor, would stick with that relatively honest position instead of going into politics, which in this nation is one step below prostitute. I don&rsquo;t want to offend the readers, but a prostitue at least earns her money performing a service for ordinary folks. What does Howard Deans&rsquo; type do for them, but tear them down.</p>

<p>If GOP wants to retain the White House it had better pander   &mdash;   yes, pander   &mdash;   to white voters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Outreach&#8221; to non-whites is a waste of resources.  90% plus of blacks will vote for Sen. Obama.  60% of Mestizos who can vote will do likewise because they believe they will do better with Obama as President.</p>

			<p>The numbers sound pretty ominous for the Democrats, not Republicans.  If this trend holds and there&rsquo;s no doubt it will, sometime way before 2042 the Democrat&rsquo;s White liberal leadership will be thrown out on its ear. How much longer will Howard Dean and his ilk be able hold on?  Look at what happened to Clinton.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Predominately&#8221; does not nearly cover it. Substitute &#8220;racially&#8221; and the picture becomes clear. Of course, if you parse the stats you will note that whites are a large majority in both parties, so the charge of racist voting patterns holds true only for non-whites. Too bad the Republicans did no more than shriek like aggrieved women over this statement. If McCain had the<br>
convictions to match his courage, he might have taken the opening and explained the virtue of interest politics for whites.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve reached the point where I&rsquo;m almost hoping Obama wins. Such a slap in the face may be the only thing that wakes up the stupid party. Just for good measure, I hope McCain busts his buns trying to get the Hispanic vote.</p>

			<p>&#8216;overwhelmingly white&rsquo;</p>
<p>There it is again.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the Republican Party, these figures may be ominous for the future, if not the present. According to a Census Bureau report last week, the country is rapidly becoming less white. It is projected that, in 2042, whites will makes up less than half of the population.&#8221;</p>
<p>Uh-oh, have to scare Republicans into pandering to minorities. I project that an America that does not have a substantial white majority cannot exist as a civilized first world nation so why would should it matter to Republicans to think about their chances in a government that won&rsquo;t exist in 40 years. By the way, I would be overjoyed if Republicans were an actual white party, but it is not. It is the &#8216;colorblind conservative&rsquo; party.</p>

			<p><i>DNC chairman calls GOP the &ldquo;white party.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>This is outright insulting. They use the &#8220;white party&#8221; epithet as if it were wrong or otherwise shameful to be a &#8220;white party&#8221; (which the GOP, unfortunately, is not). </p>
<p>We, the white people of America, should call the Democratic Party what most of them really are: the party of treason. They side with invaders, irredentists, leftist agitators, hostile (towards whites) minorities, and with about anybody who can be characterized as anti-American.</p>
<p>The Democratic Party is on its way to become a cancer on this nation. Every decent American who for whatever reason calls himself a Democrat may wish to consider switching to another party or become independent before its too late. For otherwise they will have to accept their share of blame for the <i>progress</i> of this cancer of America.<br>

			<p>If the Republican party really was the &#8220;white&#8221; party in any way that wasn&rsquo;t incidental, everyone in America would know it, because the media would report it 24/7/365 in roughly the way they&rsquo;d report German bombers strafing Manhattan.</p>

			<p>   If he thinks the Republican Party is the White party that should tell him something, no?  Democrats don&rsquo;t represent white people. They cater especially to minorities. He could bring in more whites by closing the border and deporting illegals.</p>

			<p>  Note in the original story how the writer tries to suggest that Dean just made a &#8220;slip of the tongue.&#8221; The media didn&rsquo;t try to offer that excuse for the Texas congressman who referred on camera to &#8220;Barney Fagg&#8221; instead of &#8220;Barney Frank,&#8221; did they?</p>
<p>  With all these quotes from people about how the Republicans are supposed to appeal to &#8220;people of color,&#8221; there is not one suggestion as to how they are supposed to do that. Do the Republicans say, &#8220;We only want White folks&rsquo; votes; all you other people, begone!&#8221; No, obviously they don&rsquo;t. Is it an assumption that any party that espouses conservative, family values, obviously only wants the votes of Caucasians? If so, why should that assumption be made? Do non-Whites automatically only agree with radical-left politics? If Republicans have to become a liberal party to appeal to so-called &#8220;people of color,&#8221; then they will become just a pale imitation (pun intended) of the Democrats, won&rsquo;t they?</p>

			<p>The republican party IS, in fact, the white party.</p>
<p>The problem is, they are not proud of it.  Because whites are not proud of themselves.</p>
<p>A necessary change in white thinking needs to be that being something like &#8220;the white party&#8221; is a good and necessary thing.  Soon afterward, whites can force &#8220;the white party&#8221; to obey white interests.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not the color of the skin that&rsquo;s important to Blacks, its the party. 90% of the Blacks will vote Democrat no matter who runs. Blacks have been conditioned to vote Democrat no matter what. If David Dukes ran for president as a Democrat, he&rsquo;d still get 90% of the Black vote. </p>

			<p>Why Howard Dean is the DNC Chairman I&rsquo;ll never know. He lacks tact, but also has a knack for speaking &#8220;unspeakable truths&#8221;.</p>
<p>The simple fact is, just about everything progressive in this country came from the Democratic Party. I can no more conceive of the GOP introducing civil rights legislation, or being the first to nominate a female or a minority for the national ticket, than I can imagine Detroit becoming a model for large city management.</p>
<p>Dean is hardly the first to call the GOP a party of tired old white guys, and McCain seems especially to epitomize this. Condoleeza Rice and Colin Powell have been referred to in this context as &#8220;Honorary Dumb White Guys&#8221;.</p>
<p>Like it or not, Democrats have traditionally represented new ways of doing things, while the GOP has always represented resistance to and criticism of new ways of doing things. Much done in the name of social progress has been controversial, but as FDR once said: There are many ways to move forward and only one way to stand still.</p>
<p>Methinks Howard Dean doth talk too much, and in a peculiar form of conservative &#8220;political correctness&#8221; I would never openly embrace his comments. But in my heart, I know he&rsquo;s right.</p>

			<p>  This white liberal race traitor ( redundant, isn&rsquo;t it ? )N.Y.C. born M.D./Marxist politician chose &#8221; white-Christian Vermont &#8221; to become politically active and raise a family safely,then reach the governor&rsquo;s office, why not black-Christian Mississippi ? Typical unconstitutional anti-American  &#8221; limosine liberal &#8220;, Marxist hypocrite. Dean, practice medicine in Detroit and see how long you will live.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;.he momentarily referred to the GOP as the &ldquo;white party.&rdquo; </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to be facetious when I say that people like this Dean should be studied closely to determine how he became so twisted and skewed in favor of dimishing white influence.  I mean, it just isn&rsquo;t natural.  Human nature COMPELS races to look out for themselves above all others.  No other race has people like this man who would even begin to consider critizing one of their organizations for being too non-white.</p>
<p>This phenomenon only occurs among whites, and it&rsquo;s an absolutely disgusting group of people that is involved. </p>
<p>True justice would be if they were someday forced to live and work within a multiracial/multicultural utopia of third world hordes, made up mostly of urban blacks.  </p>

			<p>I wish we <i>did</i> have a White Party, but the Republican party sure isn&rsquo;t it.  Jorge Bush thinks he&rsquo;s president of Mexico.  Unfortunately McCain&rsquo;s adviser is probably right that McCain will get a good number of Hispanic votes   &mdash;   because McCain is a big advocate of illegal immigration.</p>
<p>Frank in Georgia, the more you learn about John McCain the less you&rsquo;ll like him.  He cosponsored the illegal amnesty bill with Ted Kennedy.  He wants a war with Iran.  He&rsquo;s a somewhat more senile clone of Jorge Bush.  His nomination proves that the Republican party has a death wish.  I predict a landslide for Obama, although I certainly don&rsquo;t want it.</p>

			<p> Howard Dean just admitted here that the demoncat party is the Anti White party. It&rsquo;s too bad the repubs aren&rsquo;t man enough to know what to do with an admission-and a creep like this. So much easier it is to chest thump for the next war in which your white son will be expected to sacrifice the only life he has for the foriegners that rule the bankrupt farce that used to be our country. Is this reality starting to sink in yet?</p>

			<p> Dean is a real fruit basket turnover . He and Terry McCauliff were separated at birth . I&rsquo;ll always believe Dean lost his momemtum when he attacked that working class Iowan and began pointing his finger at him telling him to sit down and shut up . I can&rsquo;t imagine this guy performing a delicate surgical procedure on someone,especially if he had found out the patient was ultra conservative . He&rsquo;s also lived a lily white existence, that New English town he was from was over 90% white . So what the heck does he know ? One thing should be obvious, the Dems are the non-white party . Unfortunately there are x number of white Dems who would vote democratic even if they were running Muammar al-Gadaffi as their candidate . For us true conservatives, we have no party .Even if we did most of us would vote Republican out of fear of a Democratic win . We just can&rsquo;t win,rain or shine .</p>

			<p>So what Republicans are mainly white, the Dems are mainly minority, and race traitors. The fact is the Republican party may be white, but it dose not represent whites. I thought it was the brown party, its actually funny the majority whites have no say is ether party. So to be honest about it none of the parties are whites, because none of the parties represent white people. The Republicans need to wake up because their never going to get more then 20%, or even 10% of the minority vote. They need to realize supporting hispanics who don&rsquo;t vote Republican anyway&rsquo;s is going to lead to never seeing another Repub in the white house. They need to stop supporting latinos, and start supporting the people who actually will vote for them. Because no matter what even with all their appeasement they will never get a big chunk of the minority vote.</p>
<p>Its funny that Dean has the nerve to call the Repub party the white party. Blacks, hispanic, asians votes 95% for the dem party while whites vote 35% for the dem party. So who are the real racist? The real racist are the 95% black,asian, hispanics voteing for the dem party. Home come it int seen as racist that 90%+ of blacks, asian, hispanics vote for a party they deem in their races best interest. But when 35% of whites vote dem, 25%of whites vote independent, and 40% of white vote Repub it is then seen as racism. Whites vote evenly for each party, you can&rsquo;t say the same for black, asians &amp; hispanics who vote 90%+ for a party (&#8220;DEM&#8221;) they deem in their races best interest. </p>
<p>Another thing it is not like the Republican party hasnt reached out to the minorities. It is the minorities who segregated them self into one party, the Repubs have done every thing in the book to attract minority votes. It is the people of color who have decided not to vote Repub, even with all the Republicans aim towards the people color. It is high time for the Repubs to realize that they will never attract non-whites in large numbers, no matter how much they bend over backwards to get them. By continueing to bend over backwards they risk losseing the white vote, and never gaining the color vote. Because the color vote will never, I say will ever vote in large numbers for Republicans no matter what.</p>

			<p>If there is a party of color, its most certainly the Dems, for all my life I&rsquo;ve watched the Dems grovel, beg,pander, on their knees in front of black leaders. As i became an adult of voting age, considering whom to vote for, I ruled out the Dems because of their inability to keep from slobbering all over any black who wasn&rsquo;t in prison. </p>

			<p>Without post-1965 non-whites the Democratic would be an insignificant political party. Or to put it another way, the Democratic party has been importing its voters form other nations. This makes the Democratic party an illegitmate  political party. By making that statement,Howard Dean declared a jihad against Native Born White Americans. Question for Howard Dean:Why should Native Born White Americans vote for a party fanatically dedicated to the racial dispossession of White Americans? The above comments apply to the Republican Party.</p>
<p>It is the stupidity of Native Born White Americans that makes this all possible. Of course numbersusa.com and Roy Beck are all on board with Howard Dean and the Democratic Party about the legitmacy of the race replacement of Native Born White Americans.I will be hilarious to watch Roy Beck lecture the mexicans,chinese and muslim majority in California about why they should be in favor of immigration restriction. Do not financially support numbersusa.com</p>

			<p>&ldquo;McCain has campaigned in the African-American community more than any Republican nominee I know of,&rdquo; a McCain senior adviser said, although he conceded that Obama will probably win the black vote by a record margin. &ldquo;Obviously, with the first African-American presidential candidate (of a major party), Obama will get a record percentage of the African-American vote. That&rsquo;s logical. That&rsquo;s to be expected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Logical that they use race as their primary factor for whom they vote for?  But shame upon any Caucasian that applies this logic anywhere in their life? (except for Jews, of course)</p>
<p><br>
I wonder if the 90% majority of whites in the republican party are the number 1 reason the Party doesn&rsquo;t address white issues?  It is much like the Blacks in the Democratic Party; they just get small favors here and there because what are they going to do? Vote Republican?  If they were serious about helping Blacks the Democrats would support a reduction in the war on drugs with probably a goal with it to be sold like cigarettes and liquor.  They don&rsquo;t have to because Blacks will still vote Democrat.  Republicans don&rsquo;t have to address our issues because far too many whites vote Republican without thinking.  </p>
<p>Whoever it was that came up with two party system as we have it was a genius.  What a insidious way to steal the freedom of the US citizenry with their active participation&hellip;</p>

			<p>Bush has appointed more women and minorities to cabinet and high-level positions in his administration than any President in history.</p>
<p>Condoleeza Rice and Colin Powell have occupied the highest offices in the land of any blacks ever, under a Republican President.</p>
<p>The Republicans led the charge, over the generations, to end slavery, promote and pass the Civil Rights movement/legislation, and pack the bureaucracies with &#8220;diversity,&#8221; all the while being resisted by Democrats until only in recent times when Democrats sought to claim the image of fighting for minorities.</p>
<p>With the Trent Lott and George Allen controversies in recent years, the GOP is desperate to avoid appearing to be &#8220;bigoted&#8221; at all, so much to the point that the party has completely abandoned anything resembling loyalty and protection of the rights of whites.</p>
<p>Yet the comments of Dean go unanswered by anyone in prominence on a national stage. </p>

<p>I stand by my statement, but yours is true as well; to square this circle one need only understand that white tribal identity is anti-solidarity, anti-sanity, anti-human, pro-suicide, etc.  But it is perfectly correct to point out that so-called &#8220;anti-racism&#8221; (anti-whitism) is the white tribe&rsquo;s identity.</p>
