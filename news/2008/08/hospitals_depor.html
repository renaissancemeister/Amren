<p>Jimenez&rsquo;s benchmark case exposes a little-known but apparently widespread practice. Many U.S. hospitals are repatriating seriously injured or ill immigrants because they cannot find nursing homes willing to accept them without insurance. Medicaid does not cover long-term care for illegal immigrants, or for newly arrived legal immigrants, creating a quandary for hospitals, which are obligated by federal regulation to arrange post-hospital care for patients who need it.</p>

			<p>Well I&rsquo;m shocked, just plain shocked, that illegal alien Mexicans are getting treated just like American citizens would in many cases without insurance  &mdash;  not.</p>

			<p>Uh, oh, I hear major lawsuit, as the FEDS didn&rsquo;t do the deporting. The recent story was the hospital spent $30,000 to deport the illegal alien back to Honduras, by air ambulance, where he is still sick, after a car accident caused by a &#8216;native&rsquo;. But if he wasnt in the country illegally, it wouldnt have happened.</p>

			<p>     Since he was here illegally, we bear no responsibility for his care. Our bleeding heart liberal rag, The Orlando Sentinel, said his car was hit by a Floridian. They didn&rsquo;t say if the Floridian was an illegal alien. I feel sorry for the guy, but if he didn&rsquo;t break the law in the first place he wouldn&rsquo;t be in the fix he is in now. Our taxpayers should not have to foot the bill for his care.</p>

			<p>The patient should have been shipped back to Guatelama as soon as he was stabilized at the hospital.  Things are starting to change in America because the arithmetic is finally not working.  We can&rsquo;t afford to pay for all the indigents of the world.</p>

			<p>I have a novel idea that would be a logical extension of this practice. Have the attending physician draft a medical opinion letter stating that the patient will have a more desirable medical/spiritual outcome if he is attended to in his home culture and immediate transfer is recommended as a humane measure. Who could argue with that??</p>

			<p>The writer, Deborah Sontag, is just another bleeding heart, hate whitey liberal.  The entire tone of the article is to decry the practice of repatriating nonpaying parasitic illegals back to their homeland.  They should count themselves lucky that they received ANY medical care from the U.S. at all.  </p>
<p>The mention of lawyers blocking attempted repatriation efforts is further reason to detest immigration attorneys, the ACLU and the rest of their ilk. </p>
<p>Although I can empathize for Mr. Jimenez, his suffering pales in comparison to the many U.S. CITIZENS who are routinely killed by drunken ILLEGAL ALIENS.  </p>

			<p>Right on.  Unless two nations have reciprical agreement(such as in the EU), a country is NOT obligated to provide ongoing free medical care for foreign nationals. In the US, we are obligated to provide emergency medical care to foreigners regardless of the fact that they can&rsquo;t pay. However, once the foreign citizen is stabilized, we have every right to send them back to their country of origin for further treatment. We do not have a reciprical agreement with any of these countries. This is a lot better than what Mexico and other countries do, any US citizen or other foreigner must also pay for emergency medical care. We spend FIVE BILLION a year here in Texas for free medical care for mexican nationals, cutting back on social services for americans in order to pay for this. I&rsquo;m sick of our government paying billions in free medical care for foreign citizens while 44 million americans lack medical insuarnce. It&rsquo;s a disgrace and must stop.</p>

			<p>I own my own business and had to drop my insurance when it went from 186.00 per month to 411.00 less than  two years ago even though i never used it once. I had to have major knee surgery from a freak accident and had to pay cash to the hospital to avoid loan shark interest,and had to do the same with the surgeon. I asked what if i had said i was a illegal which they responded they knew i wasn&rsquo;t but if i had of been they would have recieved the same treatment knowing they would never recieve any payments and that was why when we pay for health care we really pay for five people who don&rsquo;t pay. I wonder who these people are. The emergency room says they watch illegal after illegal leaving the emergency room throwing away all the paper work they had just been billed in the garbage by the door. Whats wrong with this picture? What will keep hard working Americans from revolting except for the most powerful weapon in the world called public propaganda through control of  communications!</p>

<p>You should have to ask this question?? ACLU, NAACP, the illegal being deported and the Supreme court of course. </p>

			<p>Isn&rsquo;t this funny&hellip;  I&rsquo;ve just returned home from a two-day &#8220;visit&#8221; to the hospital (suffered a major bronchial infection)&hellip;  </p>
<p>Since my husband and I are self-employed, we&rsquo;re forced to pay our &#8220;non-profit&#8221; health insurance provider a whopping $838.00 a month for basic health insurance!  </p>
<p>Now, with all of the co-pays to go along with my hospital stay, I shudder to think how much more we&rsquo;ll have to pay by the time this &#8220;episode&#8221; is all said and done&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not fair that we, as legal citizens of this country, must pay through the nose for our health care just so that illegal aliens from south of the border can obtain it for free!</p>
<p>As with so many things in America today, something is indeed very wrong with this picture&hellip;</p>

			<p>Whats wrong with this picture? <br>
The answer to your question is the unfunded federal government mandate known as EMTALA (Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act) passed under Regan which made it illegal for hospitals not to treat illegals for free for almost any condition.  The mandate was entirely unfunded by the federal government but is currently funded by you, the taxpayer, as hospitals must either transfer the costs to paying patients or go out of business.  Many of them have gone out of business which imposes another kind of cost on citizens, one which could mean their lives, when they are seriously injured and there is no hospital within many miles because the ones that used to be relatively close have been driven out of business by, you guessed it, being forced to give &#8220;free&#8221; medical care to illegals.</p>

<p>Personally, I do believe that any person who needs emergency care and can&rsquo;t afford it should be given in for humanitarian reasons.  BUT we should shut down the borders and not allow these people in the country in the first place, thus they wouldn&rsquo;t be in our hospitals. Also, if someone manages to get in our country illegally, we also should bill their country of origin for the treatment.</p>

<p>Thats why we need to fight back. Everyone, get involved in local politics and make your way up the ladder. Like ban welfare, scholarships, and Affirmative Action for Blacks and Mexicans and Arabs,  because it is &#8220;racist&#8221; and promotes &#8220;sterotypes&#8221;&hellip;&hellip;..Wink, wink. Use the  Marxist Liberals ideas against them. </p>

			<p>As an aside, as a check processor for a large American bank, note that even OTHER country&rsquo;s embassy personnel BUY PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE from American companies! So the fact that we are returning the illegals back so that their government may or may not tend to them shouldn&rsquo;t cause us to shed a tear for them. Even their governments know that this cost money.</p>

			<p>The alternative is that hospitals go bankrupt, the way they are in California and Arizona.  The bleeding hearts do not seem to have considered that a high proportion of hospitals closing down make all of us inherently less safe in the event of a car accident.  Would you rather have a 15-minute ambulance ride to the nearest hospital after being seriously injured, or a 30 minute ride because the closest one had shut down?</p>
<p>One prediction I read here on Amren that seems like an eventual certainty is that guarded, gated communities will begin having their own medical clinics within the fenced perimiter, making it quite impossible for non-residents to bankrupt them, since they would simply be turned away at the gate.</p>

			<p>There should be a slightly different process.  Instead of flying an illegal back to, say, El Salvador, they should be returned only as far as the last country they were in before the US.  That means dump all Hispanics back into Mexico where they crossed the border in the first place.  Quick and easy.</p>
