<p>International attention has been focused on the execution of convicted killer Jose Medellin scheduled for Tuesday. The International Court of Justice, also known as the World Court, said the Mexican-born Medellin and some 50 other Mexicans on death row around the nation should have new hearings in U.S. courts to determine whether a 1963 treaty was violated during their arrests.</p>
<p>Medellin, now 33, is the first among the 50 who is set to die.</p>
<p>His attorneys contend Medellin was denied the protections of the Vienna Convention, which calls for people arrested to have access to their home country&rsquo;s consular officials. He has been in the United States since the age of 3.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>President Bush has asked states to review the cases. Texas has refused to budge.</p>
<p>The U.S. Embassy in Mexico warned of possible protests there Tuesday.</p>
<p>Medellin&rsquo;s lawyers went to the Supreme Court after the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the state&rsquo;s highest criminal court, refused to stop the lethal injection. The justices ruled in March that neither the President nor the international court can force Texas&rsquo; hand.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Texas officials acknowledge that Medellin was not told he could ask for help from Mexican diplomats but argued he forfeited the right because he never raised the issue until four years after his conviction. In any case, the diplomats&rsquo; intercession wouldn&rsquo;t have made any difference in the outcome of the case, they said.</p>
<p>Medellin speaks, reads and writes English and gave a written confession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t feel sorry for me,&rdquo; he said on an anti-death penalty Web site where inmates seek pen pals. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m where I&rsquo;m at because I made an adolescent choice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Medellin, on death row for almost 14 years, was one of six teenagers arrested and charged with the gang rape and murders of Elizabeth Pena, 16, and Jennifer Ertman, 14. The two Houston girls, returning from a friend&rsquo;s house, took a shortcut home and stumbled on a group of teenagers drinking beer after initiating a new gang member.</p>
<p>Evidence showed the girls were gang raped for more than an hour, then were kicked, beaten and strangled. Their bodies were found four days later.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mexico, which has no death penalty, initially sued the United States in the World Court in 2003. Mexico and other opponents of capital punishment have sought to use the court to fight for foreigners facing execution in the U.S.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The law is clear: Texas is bound not by the World Court, but by the U.S. Supreme Court, which reviewed this matter and determined that this convicted murderer&rsquo;s execution shall proceed,&rdquo; said Jerry Strickland, a spokesman for the Texas Attorney General&rsquo;s Office.</p>
<p>If executed, Medellin would be the 410th condemned prisoner to die in Texas since the state resumed carrying out capital punishment in 1982, far more than any other state. At least six other Mexican nationals are in that total.</p>

			<p>It utterly amazes me (although I don&rsquo;t know why anything that goes on in this nation anymore does) that although Bush has signed the execution of Americans quickly and with an apparently free conscience in the past, and yet when it comes to illegal alien Mexicans&hellip;.. How can any American, I mean ANY, have an ounce of faith left in this man to do what is right by Americans? He is an 100% bona fide Mexican, if not in body then in spirit.</p>

			<p>Despite the state being minority-majority, common sense appears to still rule.  How refreshing considering so many minorites are anti-death penalty.  I guess it&rsquo;s because the youngins haven&rsquo;t voted on the issue yet but once they do, it will be a free for all on its elimination.<br/>

			<p> It is a tragedy that more must die but the death penalty is in place to detour those who might be considering a crime of such a nasty degree and it is the only recourse for justice, these inmates have many many years of appeals and that is far greater then any other country in the world in todays society and if all appeals are exhusted and his or any death row inmates convictions are up held then I would say that this is a last ditch effort by the Mexican Goverment to play the race and nationality card again to try and impose its govermental powers over our courts and our laws and goverment it is no wonder that these illeagal intruders feel that they are above our laws and that our laws do not pertain to them or certain nationalitys, ethnic, and cultural peoples the same cards are played over and over every time one of its citizens gets in trouble andthe story gets to the Media.<br/>
 God bless Texas and may god have mercy upon the soul and souls of those who are about to have their sentences carried out peace and justice be to our naition and peace and prosperity to all who obey the laws of this naition and the rule and law of God.<br/>
AMEN!</p>

			<p>If you want to murder someone come to New Jersey.  New Jersey loves murderers and gives them slaps on the wrist.  NJ even holds off murder trials for several years so witnesses move or begin to forget.  Life in NJ means week end furloughs, congugal visits and out for good behavior in a few years.  NJ feels its wrong to keep a human in a cage the rest of his life.  Murder in NJ.</p>

poor little Medellin was a &#8216;teenager&rsquo; when he committed his crimes, a mere youth who made a bad &#8216;adolescent&rsquo; choice&hellip;. at the age of 19.<br/>

			<p>Only seven out of 410 death row executions conducted in Texas from 1982 through tomorrow are Mexican nationals?? Based on what we anecdotally view regarding Mexican crime in Texas, I&rsquo;d say that Mexicans appear to be getting a big break from Texas prosecutors who opt not to seek death penalties for Mexican capital crime defendants. This is something that needs further study.</p>

<p>Mexico treats its&rsquo; prisoners inhumanely and some americans who have been rightly or wrongly imprisoned in Mexico are often treated inhumanely.  One Texas college student, a young woman who was held on a charge of illegally purchasing prescription medication in Mexico died shortly after her release due to lack of medical care in a Mexican jail. They didn&rsquo;t apologize for that or anything else. </p>

			<p>In Antigua two British honeymooners were shot dead in their beds. The U.K. government - instead of offering every possible cooperation - kept requesting no death penalty be brought against the killer(s). The U.K. government was only concerned for the welfare of foreigner-murderers and not its slain citizenry. That&rsquo;s the Labour party for you.</p>

			<p>I may remind Mr. Strickland as well as some on this board that the Vienna Convention, as an international treaty, IS the law of the land.<br/>
Not that I object to the death penalty as such, especially in a case like that, but imagine for a moment an American on death row in Iran. Dubya´s very last idea would be to call on the World Court.</p>

			<p>Peejay in Frisco: If the Mexican murder rate is only three times ours, it&rsquo;s because ours includes Blacks and Hispanics.  In this country, the Mexican murder rate is over five times the White rate.  In recent years, our Rulers have been trying to conceal the disparity in violence by counting many Hispanics as White.  This makes them look less violent, while we look more violent.  It also makes Blacks, statistically speaking, only eight times as violent as Whites, instead of the actual figure, which is eleven times as homicidal.  </p>

			<p>My first long-term stay in Texas was as a federal prison inmate.  The Flag of Texas ran at the same height as Old Glory, but on a different flagpole.  Why?  Because Texas was an independant nation before it voluntarily joined the US.</p>

<p>Rubbish!  It does not supercede the Constitution.  The Supreme Court often has no problem ruling in violation of the Constitution itself.  Let them violate this treaty then.  I don&rsquo;t care what idiot treaties have been negotiated by idiot diplomats and ratified by idiot Senators.  We, the people, may chose to nullify them.</p>

<p>Hasta la vista</p>
<p>Meaning</p>
<p>Translated from the Spanish - &#8216;see you later&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Origin</p>
<p>This phrase has of course been in everyday use in Spanish-speaking countries for some time. It came to the attention of the English-speaking world via the 1991 film Terminator 2: Judgment Day, which was written by James Cameron and William Wisher Jr.</p>
<p>The phrase &#8216;hasta la vista, baby&rsquo; features in an exchange between the film&rsquo;s characters John Connor (Edward Furlong) and &#8216;The Terminator&rsquo; (Arnold Schwarzenegger):</p>
<p>John Connor: No, no, no, no. You gotta listen to the way people talk. You don&rsquo;t say &#8220;affirmative,&#8221; or some s  &mdash;  - like that. You say &#8220;no problemo.&#8221; And if someone comes on to you with an attitude you say &#8220;eat me.&#8221; And if you want to shine them on it&rsquo;s &#8220;hasta la vista, baby.&#8221;<br/>
The Terminator: Hasta la vista, baby.<br/>
John Connor: Yeah but later, dickwad. And if someone gets upset you say, &#8220;chill out&#8221;! Or you can do combinations.<br/>
The Terminator: Chill out, dickwad.<br/>
John Connor: Great! See, you&rsquo;re getting it!<br/>
The Terminator: No problemo. </p>
<p>It is sometimes misspelled as &#8216;asta la vista&rsquo;.</p>

			<p>Can a treaty set aside the Constitution of the United States?  If you argue that, you are being illogical.<br/>
There needs to be some research done on original intent in this question, as libs are quite fond of claiming that treaties are, in fact, superior to the Constitution.</p>

			<p>   The world court has no say in our justice system, or at least it shouldn&rsquo;t have any say. Bravo Texas! I am an independent concerning politics, you would say I&rsquo;m more conservative than any republican. Therefor, I will say this, George Bush is the most incompetent president since Jimmy Carter. Our congress,(democratic controlled) is showing the worst numbers in competency in its history. We are a laughing stock world wide. We have re-kindled the cold war with Russia, we are on shaky ground with the U.K., our only real ally in Europe. Oil prices are shooting for the moon. And thanks to all the business-led treaties, we are losing our businesses to other countries. The ones that are left, are being filled with illegals that are pouring across our open border with Mexico. The federal government has become the agressor with its own people. We are spending trillions of dollars that we don&rsquo;t have to fight wars in the middle east against people that never attacked us. My whole point is, the U.S. is not running its own country. The world court and its minions are deciding in which direction our country will move and what its policies will be. They are using our military and our children to fight wars for other countries. Remember that you read it here first. The military draft (selective service) will be re-instituted to fill the holes in our military ranks as the volunteers either leave the military or the body count thins it out, or both. We are fighting an aggressive war in the middle east, undeclared, in violation of our constitution. Two major violations stand out for me. No foreign entanglements. And war must be declared by congress, not a sitting president. Texas is right to stand up to the world court and Presidente Boosh. Texas and Kalifornia are the two hardest impacted states by illegls in the union. Big business is behind it all. I say bravo for Texas. Maybe the second war for independence will start in the lone star state. I will proudly join them if it comes down to that ending.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I may remind Mr. Strickland as well as some on this board that the Vienna Convention, as an international treaty, IS the law of the land.&#8221;  - nokangaroos at 2:52 AM on August 5 </p>
<p>It is <i>neither</i> a treaty <i>nor</i> the law of the land. It is a &#8220;convention,&#8221; which is <i>not</i> a treaty. (Not to be too harsh, but the phrase &#8220;international treaty,&#8221; while used on TV, is an inaccurate term for agreements necessarily entered into <i>between</i> countries.) And, more to the point here, the United States is not a signatory to the provisions of the convention that applies to imposition of the death penalty. The provisions of the Vienna Convention that regulate notification of a consular official when a defendant faces the death penalty are called the &#8220;Optional Protocol to the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.&#8221; And the U.S. withdrew from these particular provisions some years ago. Nice try, Mr. nokangaroos. But next time do your homework and remember there are others reading your words that actually work in the field you are addressing.</p>
<p>And, by the way, of course the President wouldn&rsquo;t call on the World Court should a U.S. citizen get the death penalty in a foreign land. The U.S. would simply take direct action, if required, the way any self-respecting human might do if his family was put in harms way by a bully. The World Court is for those countries so weak and powerless that they have no alternative but to appeal to the World Court, a subservient position much of the rest of the world and certain Democrats would love to see the U.S. assume. </p>

Not that I object to the death penalty as such, especially in a case like that, but imagine for a moment an American on death row in Iran. Dubya´s very last idea would be to call on the World Court.</p>
<p>Posted by nokangaroos at 2:52 AM on August 5 </p>
<p>Yes the Vienna Convention is an international treaty to protect those who cannot protect themselves against totalitarianism&hellip;.it was not intended to protect those that kill the innocent among us. </p>
<p>In this case I totally disagree with Dubya because he made the US Supreme Court look like a joke&hellip;as President of the United States who took an oath to defend the Constitution he should have stayed out of this&hellip;whoever advised him on this issues is another wackedout con playing politics and trying to be nice and of course politically correct&hellip;.non-sense.</p>
<p>It is the same as fighting the war on terror while Karen Hughes his confidant gives taxpayers money to Islamic terrorist&hellip;come on&hellip;it is absurd and makes no sense at all. People need to be reminded that if it were not for he courage of Americans we would not have a Europe that is now heading for the same totalitarianism of yester years. Remember NORMADIE! </p>

			<p>George W. Bush granted clemency to only one person, a mass murderer. That was Henry Lee Lucas.<br/>
Jeb granted clemency to Henry&rsquo;s road dog, Otis Toole.<br/>
Both were mass murderers and self admitted cannibals.<br/>
Wonder what they knew that afforded them special treatment?</p>

			<p>I sure hope Texas fries Jose Medellin.  It would be absurd if an American citizen who commits murder can get the death penalty in Texas but an illegal alien from Mexico who commits murder in Texas can&rsquo;t.  If Jose doesn&rsquo;t want to live within our laws he shouldn&rsquo;t have come here.  And with the Mexican government actively encouraging its citizens to violate our sovereignty every day I can do nothing but have a belly laugh when World Court whines about our laws.</p>

			<p>This is a victory for what is left of our constitution.  Even our Supreme Court(which has done so much damage to the constitution in other cases) has ruled that this is a state issue.  The murderer has confessed so there is no doubt that he is guilty.  He was tried and convicted and sentenced to death. The fact that this is even an issue is merely a sign of our times  &mdash;  -neither the UN, nor the EU, nor the Criminal Court of Justice in the Hague, nor any other foreign or international body has any legal standing here.  It is the decisions of the courts of the State of Texas that are, as the lawyers say, determinative and this is exactly as it should be. </p>

Bush&rsquo;s blind love for Mexicans - even for the most atrocious criminals - is notorious.<br/>
But aside from that, I would be worried for the welfare of Americans in Mexico,  especially for  those in Mexican jails.</p>

			<p>If I were President of the United States, I would order an all-out nuclear strike on any nation that takes us before the World Court.  I&rsquo;m not President, so I can&rsquo;t, but someone should.  Let&rsquo;s see how eager the second country would be to try that stuff.  A good teacher is at his or her best with the slow learners, so by the time we got down to Peru or New Guinea, I suspect the lesson would have been learned.</p>

<p>Some anti-death penalty activists and State Department types were warning about riots among Mexicans and retribution by the same against whites.  Looks like it didn&rsquo;t happen, so the left is peddling the kind of &#8220;anti-Hispanic bigotry&#8221; that they like to accuse us of doing.</p>

<p>No loyal Americaan should let any foreign court to have any jurisdiction in our country. That was just another step in the loss of our sovereignty. The Geneva Conventions vis a vis the treatment of POWS is one thing. Those girls were raped and killed in their own country by a monster.  Screw the Vienna conventions!<br/>

			<p>Correct, Scote.  A treaty that has been ratified by Congress is absolutely NOT the same as a &#8220;convention&#8221;.  Even an unratified treaty, like Salt II has no legal force.  An international agreement becomes US law only after the US Congress has ratified it.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m mexican and believe it or not, many of my countryman don&rsquo;t feel any sympathy for people like Medellin, please don&rsquo;t use racial slur, this is only a political thing for many inept mexican politicians, most people don&rsquo;t thing like them.<br/>
In fact, mexican people now is starting to look for the death penalty too. </p>

			<p>One question here is whether at any point Medellin ever ASKED to see Mexican consular officials?  They could have applied at the jail where he was being held before trial to make a legal visit; any lawyer can do that; that&rsquo;s how defendants held without bond hire private attorneys in the first place.  Certainly they knew about him; a crime this gruesome tends to make the local news, even if the media successfully blacks it out on a national level.</p>
<p>Additionally, the inability of Mexico to meddle in the case aside, Medellin received the same access to the public defender&rsquo;s office that a US defendant would have.  What&rsquo;s the problem?</p>
<p>Finally, he could have offered to plead guilty in exchange for avoiding the death penalty.  That&rsquo;s actually pretty common, though since he had co-defendants, it probably would have required him to testify against them, something gang-members are often reluctant to do.  Sometimes they crack, and then it gets to be a mad scramble among defendants in a case to rat on each other - the relevant saying is &#8220;The last one on the bus gets the worst seat.&#8221;</p>
