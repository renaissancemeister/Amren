<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>The State Department has suspended a humanitarian program to reunite thousands of African refugees with relatives in the U.S. after unprecedented DNA testing by the government revealed widespread fraud.</p>
<p>The freeze affects refugees in Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, Guinea and Ghana, many of whom have been waiting years to emigrate. The State Department says it began DNA testing with a pilot program launched in February to verify blood ties among African refugees. Tests found some applicants lied about belonging to the same family to gain a better chance at legal entry.</p>
<p>The U.S. has responded by halting refugee arrivals from East Africa, where hundreds of thousands of people have been stranded in precarious conditions since civil war erupted in the early 1990s. The temporary suspension has generated panic in African communities in the U.S., where thousands wait to be joined by relatives.</p>
<p>Typically, a refugee already living in the U.S., a so-called anchor, is entitled to apply for permission to bring a spouse, minor children, parents and siblings. The process requires interviews, medical examinations and security screening.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In February, the State Department launched pilot testing in Kenya to verify family relationships, mainly among Somalis. When applicants arrived for a previously scheduled appointment, a U.S. official asked them to volunteer for a DNA test.</p>
<p>An expert then swabbed the cheek of those who claimed biological relationships, such as a mother and her purported children.</p>
<p>The cell samples were sent to labs in the U.S. for analysis.</p>
<p>As word spread, some applicants began missing appointments, and others refused to cooperate.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The results prompted expansion of the testing to other countries. &#8220;We had high rates of fraud everywhere, except the Ivory Coast,&#8221; says a State Department official.</p>
<p>In late April, the government decided to temporarily halt the family reunification resettlement program for East Africans. A government official confirms that &#8220;many thousands of people&#8221; are affected by the suspension, particularly Somalis and Ethiopians.</p>
<p>Refugee resettlement agencies report that arrivals have slowed to a trickle.</p>
<p>In Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minn., home to the country&rsquo;s largest East African population, Catholic Charities hasn&rsquo;t handled a single family reunification case since March 19. The agency has resettled 35 East African families this year, compared with more than 450 last year and about 1,300 in 2006. &#8220;Everyone is calling or walking in here and asking what is going on,&#8221; says Angela Fox, a resettlement worker at Catholic Charities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The government testing has raised questions about using DNA as an immigration tool.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Refugee advocates say the definition of family among Africans extends beyond blood relatives, especially when families fleeing persecution are scattered. &#8220;Some families are raising children who aren&rsquo;t their own but whom they call son or daughter,&#8221; says Ms. Fox of Catholic Charities.</p>

			<p>Memo to all charities:</p>
<p><br>
please google &#8220;black on white crime&#8221; before you insist on bringing more blacks into white countries. Also keep in mind that blacks probably would not be interested in living in the USA, that horrible, white, racist, black hating country.</p>

<p>Oh well that clears it up.  Basically African refugees in the US could literally bring over the entire population of Africa.</p>

<p>Personally I don&rsquo;t care how ignorant African refugees define family. Could someone explain to traitor Ms. Fox that African definitions are a non-issue in the great USA, that the legal definition is what matters. Better yet, how many refugees has Ms. Fox relocated to her street?</p>

			<p>I just read an article about this awhile back. One &#8216;suggesting&rsquo; there was hardly any fraud, but the forces of ignorance check anyway. They even did a &#8216;human interest&rsquo; thing, highlighting a couple of cases where the DNA checked out.</p>

			<p>In Sub-Saharan Africa, (Where I lived for 24 years) the black governments are busy kicking white African citizens out, people whose families in some cases have lived in the country more generations than some of the blacks who flooded down from central Africa when the word went out on the bush telegraph that there was prosperity under the European rule.   Now they have taken over that prosperity and are gradually destroying it (already done so in Zimbabwe), the poor wish to flood to the West to do the same here.   </p>
<p>Apply the basic immigration rules which are that you cannot immigrate unless there is a need for your skills.    There are enough potential workers to fill the unskilled jobs if they can be &#8220;persuaded&#8221; to work instead of relying on crime, welfare and food-stamps to live.</p>

It&rsquo;s past time to stop allowing the churches in this country to run immigration and flout the laws of this country. This is the kind of nonsense we are getting from them.</p>

			<p>Some years ago, maybe 2000, I was on a plane going to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN. I was coming from North Carolina and we had stopover somewhere (Minneapolis?) and there were all these Black men getting on. I remember thinking that they were Africans based on their dress and I was wondering what they were doing in Minnesota. </p>
<p>As for the Catholic Church, it&rsquo;s dying. I&rsquo;m a lapsed Catholic myself. Catholicism used to stand for the peoples of Europe, and now that&rsquo;s all gone. By the way, suicide is a sin according to Catholic doctrine now and they&rsquo;re advocating, directly or indirectly, that the European peoples just disappear. </p>

			<p>How many millions of low IQ africans here on welfare did it take before they figured that out?  Try to get a visa if you are an educated Irishman for a comparison if you want to see how pathetic the US immigration system is.</p>

			<p>Why not term the &#8216;Refugee Program&rsquo; with what it really is&hellip; another exercise in bureaucratic stupidity and incompetence. Apparently another government intellectual featherweight got the idea we don&rsquo;t have ENOUGH Black criminals running loose in our midst. That the &#8216;Refugee Program&rsquo; would alleviate that deficiency.</p>
<p>Another thought: Just suppose all Whites decided to move to the U.S. and expell ALL Non-Whites, giving the non-White nations the entire rest of the world, including what was Europe   &mdash;   as theirs. How soon would it be, before the non-Whites start clamoring they&rsquo;re forced to live in abject poverty, or are refugees fleeing for their lives   &mdash;   and DEMANDING entry into a totally WHITE United States   &mdash;   composed of our own and those Whites from Europe?</p>
<p>I personally wouldn&rsquo;t give the non-Whites more than a decade or two, were that scenario to come to pass   &mdash;   before the non-Whites thoroughly trashed and destroyed Europe and were banging on our figurative door   &mdash;   demanding we let them in and help (support) them.</p>

			<p>This has been going on for over a decade.  I remember listening to an Immigration officer in the mid &rsquo;90s who was close to retirement telling the story.  In Africa, you have a man, a woman, a boy, and a girl who all claim they are a family.  When they land in the US, they all claim not to be related and then demand that their real families be allowed to immigrate.    Instead of one family, now we get four.  This type of behavior is encouraged on both ends by social service groups.</p>

			<p>The Catholic Church, among others, have been vilified for supporting, aiding and abating mass 3rd world immigration into western countries. Similar to any political organization, perhaps the Catholic Church is not what it appears to be.<br>

			<p>The entire concept of &#8220;anchor babies&#8221; should be eliminated.  For millennia, nation has fought nation with swords, bow and arrow, canon, guns and bombs.  Who would have thought that the most popular, and effective, weapon of conquest would end up being babies?  Non-white races are using their babies to destroy Human diversity by eliminating whites.</p>

			<p>The fraud must have been extremely blatant and conspicious if the State Department actually decided to do something about it.  Family reunification in general, though, has been an unending scam in each and every country which has adopted it (i.e., white countries, whose idea of family, not to mention honesty, trust and decency, is very different from that of the rest of the world).</p>

			<p>  I was born and raised Catholic. For many years I gave my church 10% of my income. That has stopped. When Catholic charities started using our money to resettle immigrants that are mostly illegal and/or majority black in this country, I quit tithing and stopped going to church. As a no longer devout Catholic, I honestly believe that the &#8220;christian churches&#8221; of all the denominations are falling in step with our government to destroy us. The days of the church being the defender of the faithful are over. Charles &#8220;The Hammer&#8221; Martel would be ashamed if he knew how corrupt the church has gotten. I really believe the government is working with the church to bring about a One World Government. It is truly sad. And trust me, I am not alone in my distrust of the church. Attendance at my former church has dropped dramatically. </p>

			<p>Like Barack Obama, with his many half-sisters and brothers of differing parentage, many native Africans probably have rather murky knowledge of their family relationships, so false claims of lineage may be more based on ignorance than outright attempts at fraud.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, that we would grant black Africans of any description entry to this country seems mad, however tragic their circumstances may be in Africa. We have quite enough black criminality and wanton destruction as it is in the US.  Had we no blacks in this country our crime rate would be less than that of Japan.</p>
<p>While it may seem merciful to black Africans to grant them entry to our nation, it&rsquo;s hardly merciful to those Americans whose neighborhoods and security will be destroyed by the invaders, as they surely will.</p>

<p>What seems to happen is that the initial news, that these poor, honest, colored immigrants (not to mention honest) are being harried about DNA testing by an insensitive US government (whites)&hellip; this news get&rsquo;s picked up by the news wire, and makes a good feature about getting to know new Americans. The real news all along, which we only find out about later, gets printed on page 36 and few other papers pick up the story. </p>

			<p>This is pathetic; &#8220;thousands of people have been stranded in precarious conditions&#8221; - how can one be stranded in their own nation ? Are these people overgrown children ? Can&rsquo;t they fix their own nation, instead of poisoning the West with their unwelcome presence ? Africa is a source of pride and conceit for black nationalists in the West, and a place black africans can&rsquo;t wait to leave. Let China take over the East, and let the West be reclaimed by Westerners&hellip; </p>
