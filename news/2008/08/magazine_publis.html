<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>After a year-long investigation, the Alberta Human Rights and Citizenship Commission has rejected a complaint by the Edmonton Council of Muslim Communities against former Western Standard publisher Ezra Levant over his republication of the Danish Muhammad cartoons.</p>
<p>The allegation that the February 14, 2006, issue of the now defunct magazine was likely to expose Muslims to hatred helped to spark a national debate about human rights law and free speech, and its rejection comes after similar complaints of Islamophobia against Maclean&rsquo;s magazine also failed.</p>
<p>In a report on his investigation, which recommended the complaint not be referred for a panel hearing, AHRCC Southern Director Pardeep S. Gundara wrote that the cartoons are &ldquo;stereotypical, negative and offensive,&rdquo; and they &ldquo;do reinforce stereotypes,&rdquo; but they were &ldquo;related to relevant and timely news&rdquo; and were &ldquo;not simply gratuitously included.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Yasmeen Nizam, a civil litigation lawyer in Edmonton and an ECMC director, said the Council is &ldquo;certainly disappointed with the decision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our whole idea was to educate people,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We thought the cartoons did [expose Muslims to hatred], regardless of the context, because if you look at the broader context in a post-9/11 world, Muslims are at a higher risk of being discriminated against.&rdquo; </p>
<p>She said the Council decided to bring a human rights complaint because, unlike criminal hate speech prosecutions, the publisher&rsquo;s intent does not matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t shopping around for any laws. We thought this was a good way to bring our concerns to the attention of the public,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Obviously we didn&rsquo;t want this to continue, so [another goal was] perhaps to discourage people from further maligning our prophet and our religion &hellip;  We wanted this to have a deterrent effect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said she is unsure whether it actually has. What is certain is that this complaint, and others like it, have roused a broad contingent of free speech advocates to whom the bombastic Mr. Levant is a champion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I basically told them to f-off without using the swear word,&rdquo; Mr. Levant said of his response to the complaint, given during an interview with an AHRCC officer that he taped and broadcast on YouTube.</p>
<p>He said the complaint failed because he is &ldquo;too big a fish for them to reel in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was let go because I&rsquo;m in the media every day. I&rsquo;ve been down to [the U.S.] Congress to testify, I&rsquo;ve been on CNN even. That&rsquo;s why I was let go, because if I caused them this much pain just in an investigation, imagine what the trial would be like,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>He does not consider this a victory, though.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This censor approved what I wrote,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;His decision is not that I have freedom of speech. His decision is that I have his approval. I&rsquo;m not interested in his approval. The only test of free speech is if I can write what he disapproves of with impunity. That&rsquo;s what freedom of speech is, to piss off some second-rate bureaucrat like Pardeep Gundara and know that you have the right to do so, because you&rsquo;re in Canada, not Saudi Arabia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This complaint originally involved two other parties. A respondent, the Jewish Free Press, was dropped after the editor agreed in mediation to print a rebuttal. And an original complainant, Syed Soharwardy, national president of the Islamic Supreme Council of Canada, dropped out after he had a change of heart.</p>
<p>Now that it is resolved, Mr. Soharwardy thinks the AHRCC made the right decision, even though Mr. Levant &ldquo;twisted this whole thing&rdquo; to turn himself into a victim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never wanted someone&rsquo;s freedom of speech curtailed. I always wanted to sit down, with some third party, for mediation, and have a discussion,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I withdrew my complaint because I was adding fire to the debate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He also came to regard the entire human rights complaints process with suspicion. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a very amateur operation,&rdquo; he said, run by untrained people, which resulted in a &ldquo;complete misunderstanding&rdquo; of his goals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I went through this whole process and I saw it very closely, I realized there was some serious loopholes in the processes,&rdquo; he said.<br/>

			<p>This was a great propaganda issue for our side and this is why the Alberta Human Rights and Citizenship Commission backed down, because they didn&rsquo;t want to provoke a huge public backlash that might blow away the whole cursed PC Multi cult/Islamic immigration invasion axis of evil.</p>
<p>I suggest WN in Canada infiltrate these Human Rights Commissions/Tribunals and really push idiotic, extreme stuff to tick off the regular White Canadians.</p>
<p>WN should push for the Alberta Human Rights and Citizenship Commission to call for the banning of hockey playing and beer drinking in Canada because these are not practiced, allowed in Islamic countries and since population projections indicated that Muslim immigrants will form majorities in many Canadian communities, Canada should start working hard now to break down cultural insults to the Islamic immigrants.</p>
<p>My take is that Canadians will accept just about anything idiotic, liberal, PC but when it comes to threatening the regular man in the street Canadian&rsquo;s right to drink beer and support Canadian hockey, then and only then with regular White Canadians fight back.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;d like to think this decision was reached as the result of common sense, but I rather think it was because the human rights commisars are aware that this case, and the Maclean&rsquo;s magazine case, have awakened the Canadian public to the kangaroo court reality of these tribunals - no cost to the complainants, BIG cost to the defendants, no process of due law, guilty until proven innocent (and hardly EVER proven innocent, and then still with big bills to pay), and so forth. Here in Canada, we obviously need human rights commissions to protect us from human rights commissions! Anyhow, good for Ezra! All he was doing was reporting the news, and if there are people rioting and causing mayhem in response to cartoons, then it helps to know what the so-called offending cartoons are really all about.</p>

			<p>Ezra Levant is the one person in Canada of whom it may most correctly be said that he is drilling a hole in the boat from the inside.  Some web searching will reveal that man&rsquo;s past history of creating controversy where there need be none.</p>

			<p>Ms. Nizam wanted to suppress the publisher&rsquo;s right to free speech because that would &#8220;educate people.&#8221; Well, it does teach us that Muslims with alien values don&rsquo;t belong in a free society.</p>
<p>And Mr. Soharwardy, who filed the complaint, thinks people have to &#8220;discuss&#8221; their free speech with him. Let&rsquo;s discuss deporting these fanatics back to their intolerant homelands. </p>

			<p>Pardeep S. Gundera, Yasmeen Nizam, Syed Soharwardy, these people make my spellcheck scream.  How stupid can these Canadians be, to allow obvious foreigners to usurp their government?  Next thing you know, they&rsquo;ll have a Prime Minister named Barak Hussein Obama or something like that.</p>

			<p><i>&hellip;so [another goal was] perhaps to discourage people from further maligning our prophet and our religion … We wanted this to have a deterrent effect.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>So let me get this straight: you want to use force of law to intimidate and bully people so they won&rsquo;t say things of which you disapprove? Not surprised. Sounds about par-for-the-course where muslims are concerned. I suppose we can&rsquo;t expect much from people who deliberately worship an admitted pedophile.</p>
<p>Tell me though, muslim friends: is your god really so weak and petty that he can&rsquo;t withstand the drawing of a couple simple cartoons? For that matter, is he so impotent that he needs you to silence his detractors for him?</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;His decision is not that I have freedom of speech. His decision is that I have his approval. I&rsquo;m not interested in his approval.

			<p>ARE THE CANADIAN BRAIN-DEAD TO PUT UP WITH THESE EVIL LAWS AND THE LIBBARBARIANS IN THEIR GOVT.?</p>
<p>The last time I checked, Canada was a democracy.  I hope the Canadians are shocked &amp; dismayed by the scams being perpetrated by their govt. and these bogus &#8220;human rights&#8221; commissions, which seem to be in the business of abusing human rights, such as the most basic human right of free speech.  Section 13 of the Human Rights Act which restricts free speech is an abomination and an evil barbaric law unfit for a democracy.  </p>
<p>Candidates need to run with the promise of repealing these evil laws and people should vote for them and kick out of office the evil politicians who supports such evil laws. </p>
<p>They need to repeal the Canadian Human Rights Act (esp. Section 13), dismantle all these farcical courts called &#8220;human rights tribunals&#8221; and punish those who ran this racket for their crimes against humanity, viz. terrorizing and abusing punishing ordinary citizens for exercising their human right of freedom of speech.</p>
<p>With the persecution of people like Paul Fromm, Levant and now Mark Steyn, Canada has become the laughing stock of the world.  The Canadian should not put up with these inhumane and barbaric laws and need to repeal them immediately.</p>

			<p>This mohammedan cartoon episode simply illustrates why third worlders shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed into the West.  Muslim or not, something is bound to tick them off, whether it&rsquo;s comments on their religion, skin color, style of dress, accent, customs (e.g. killing goats in the yard), and so on.  Pardeep Gundara sounds like a non-muslim (south Asian) Indian name, so he may be a sikh or hindu.  Knowing all this, why in a majority white country like Canada is this person allowed on a human rights commission - a commission that shouldn&rsquo;t exist in the first place in a place that supposedly cherishes the free flow of ideas?</p>
