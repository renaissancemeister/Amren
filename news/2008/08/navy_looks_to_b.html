						<p>The U.S. Naval Academy is building on efforts to increase student diversity with the help of a new commercial and a graphic novel.</p>
<p>The flashy new commericial will run at least during televised Navy football games. The graphic novel is due out in the fall.</p>
<p>Vice Adm. Jeffrey Fowler, the academy&rsquo;s superintendent, wants to make the academy&rsquo;s student body as diverse as the Navy&rsquo;s enlisted force, in which minorities make up about 47 percent.</p>

			<p>The average African high school graduate has an 8th grade reading level comapred to White and Asian pupils (12th+).</p>
<p>Since a &#8220;graphic novel&#8221; is nothing more than a comic book, sounds as if the Navy has a low trajectory on its aim.  </p>

			<p>What do they mean by &#8220;graphic&#8221; novel in this sense?  Does it mean racy or explicit, or does it mean having a lot of photos?  If it&rsquo;s the latter, then it can be compared to &#8220;fotonovelas&#8221; of Indo-America (as Hugo Chavez wants us to call it), photo and picture heavy and prose-deficient books that appeal to the relatively simple mentalities of &#8220;Indo-Americans,&#8221; who don&rsquo;t seem to like complicated plots, or that much reading.</p>

For those that don&rsquo;t know, &#8220;graphic novel&#8221; is a euphemism for &#8220;comic book&#8221;.</p>
<p> So the Navy is basically saying, &#8220;I know, let&rsquo;s give a bunch of comic books to minorities and they&rsquo;ll join the Naval Academy!&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, it would have taken the Navy medical staff a battery of tests on this old boy to determine that he had slipped into senility.  Instead, the patriot that he is, he enabled them to make that determination just by outlining one of his goals.</p>
<p>As a taxpaying citizen I certainly appreciate that.  I&rsquo;m sending him a coloring book and crayons for christmas.</p>

			<p>It kind of reminds me of this comic book put out by the European Union:</p>
<p>https://ec.europa.eu/publications/archives/young/01/index_en.htm<br>
Scroll down to where it says &#8220;What, Me Racist?&#8221; </p>
<p>Pretty funny for those of us who can laugh at Political Correctness instead of being sickened by it.  And then there&rsquo;s also the Raspberry Ice Cream War, a true children&rsquo;s book, which was so embarrassing that it&rsquo;s no longer publically available.</p>

			<p>I wonder what they mean by &#8216;graphic&rsquo;?  Could they mean a novel that depicts Black sergeants raping White enlisted women?  Could they mean Black recruits raping other women?  Or could they mean a novel that portrays evil White racists lynching poor innocent Blacks in the South?  Probably all of the above with the theme of &#8216;Whitey getting what he deserves&rsquo;.</p>

			<p>Have you seen some graphic novels,lately? They are not like the simple comic books that Marvel comics put out in the 60&rsquo;s. Some are works of art- like &#8220;300.&#8221;<br>
   Which defeats the purpose of this exercise. You need brains and imtelligence to read today&rsquo;s comic books. </p>

			<p>How did minorities suddenly become 47% of the Navy&rsquo;s enlisted force???  Well I suppose if the Navy emphasized women and &#8220;minorities&#8221; in their recruting campaigns instead of white males then what else could they expect???</p>
<p>The question is why does every Federal agency and the US Armed Forces attempting to discourage white males from joining???  There is a lot of social engineering being pushed by this phony Republican president.</p>

<p>Fowler is already on track with his comic books- a population of semiliterate &#8216;minorities&rsquo; is surely America&rsquo;s future.</p>

Don&rsquo;t be too hard on the graphic novels, some of them are quite good.  I read real literary works and still read graphic novels from time to time.  Besides, as already noted this won&rsquo;t work anyway; it still involves <i>reading</i>.  </p>

			<p>What exactly does the Navy want? Nuclear submarine commanders named Mohammad? These are a bunch of Toadies that have risen to the top in the military. The military is controlled by Republican and Democratic presidents who are owned by the Corporations who want to bring about the racial dispossession of Native Born White Americans for economic reasons.</p>

<p>If it&rsquo;s anything like the corporate world, he&rsquo;s probably being evaluated on his  commitment to Diversity and on his &#8220;diversity-promoting&#8221; performance.   <br>
Or maybe he was PUT into that position with the purpose of enhanding  the Navy&rsquo;s diversity program and he knows what his assignment is.  Also, if Obama&rsquo;s elected, Fowler will be up for a nice promotion for having shown the right attitude.<br>

<p>Thanks. I was wondering about that.  Apparently a lot of others here were wondering too. I thought it was something sexy, racy, or elplicitly gory.  <br>
Odd.  But the Navy  giving out comic books is pretty odd too.  I guess pathetic would be the better word.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve been getting some education here. I never heard of &#8220;Graphic Novels&#8221;, so I had to look it up.</p>
<p><i>Writer Alan Moore  [said], &#8220;It&rsquo;s a marketing term that I never had any sympathy with.  The problem is that &#8216;graphic novel&rsquo; just came to mean &#8216;expensive comic book&rsquo; &hellip;<br>
 <br>
Author Daniel Raeburn wrote, &#8220;I snicker at the neologism for its insecure pretension  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s the literary equivalent of calling a garbage man a &#8216;sanitation engineer&rsquo;  &mdash;  <br>
 <br>
Comedian  Robin Williams joked, &#8220;&#8216;Is that a comic book?  No! It&rsquo;s a graphic novel!  Is that porn?  No! It&rsquo;s adult entertainment!&rsquo;&#8221;<br>
 <br>
Writer Neil Gaiman, responding to a claim that he does not write comic books but graphic novels, said that&hellip;&#8221;All of a sudden I felt like someone who had been informed that she wasn&rsquo;t actually a &#8216;hooker&rsquo;; that she was, in fact, really  a &#8216;lady of the evening&rsquo;.&#8221; </i><br>

			<p>This is American progress at its finest. Far East Asia produces excellent students and remains as a financial and technical power. As a whole, the whites and Asians work toward a direction. </p>
<p>America continues to fall behind, while its inner-city students continue to act ghetto fabulous. The blacks serve as the proudest example of welfare soldiers.</p>
<p>What would the founding fathers of this country say if they learned that illiterate freed slaves operate its military? </p>
<p>We will have an illiterate and ignorant military force protecting a land of illegal entrants. Will this country be worth your own life to protect?</p>

			<p>Seems the US military has been using comic books as teaching material since 1951:</p>
<p>&#8220;Sparked by Will Eisner&rsquo;s passing, this [Yahoo] group will revolve around PS-The Preventative Maintenance Monthly. A monthly magazine, the longest running title that Eisner helped found uses cartoons and comics to keep U.S. Army troops informed on how to keep their equipment in tip-top shape.</p>
<p>Launched in 1951, Eisner stayed with it for over twenty years. Artists like Murphy Anderson, Chuck Kramer, and Mike Ploog assisted Will over the years. Anderson later headed the art shop for at time. These days the signature artist is Joe Kubert&#8221;.<br>

			<p>The 3 years I have been away from the USA have left me really ignorant of current English useage. I thought &#8220;graphic novel&#8221; means x-rated, with sex and violence, not a comic book. Looks like my best move is to stay over here, I would be completely lost back in the USA.</p>

			<p>Great!  Recruit future aviators from functionally-illiterate Third-worlders and expect them to master fixed-wing carrier aviation by reading comic books.  What sort of comic book sound effects does the USNA use for a flight deck fire after a botched landing?  This is relative, however; the notion of Serranos and Crips as &#8220;officers and gentlemen&#8221; is no more appalling than anything else our glorious imperial government is doing to us and our country.</p>
<p>In the meantime, China has purchased the incomplete ex-Russian carrier &#8220;Varyag&#8221; and appears to be refitting it for service.  Pictures of it in port on Wikimapia show the rust has been removed and that it has been repainted in PLAN light gray.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m ex-Naval nuclear propulsion. The simple truth is the Navy has a  huge requirement for technically skilled personnel. The knowledge and skill set needed to fill the the various ratings can&rsquo;t be faked. Affirmative action can&rsquo;t substitute for the real thing. If the Navy goes down this path, they will see a mass exit of their best and brightest. If this happenes our country will be in great danger.</p>

<p>Maybe that would do more good than the ever popular &#8220;African American Studies&#8221; And to the X naval Nuclear Propulsion officer I would say that to think imcompetent blacks or (others) will not be put in those very positions!!you already know the answer and the other Navy sub type who has no real objections to a commander named Mohammed!! I hope his XO and bearer of the other sacred key (if that is true practice) is not named Mustafa and both are Muslim. Never, Ever trust Muslims NEVER!!!!</p>
