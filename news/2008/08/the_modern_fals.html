						<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>&#8220;In the past decade,&#8221; the Yale historian David Blight has recently written, &#8220;the neo-Confederate fringe of Civil War enthusiasm .&nsbp;.&nbsp;. has contended that thousands of African Americans, slave and free, willingly joined the Confederate war effort as soldiers and fought for their &lsquo;homeland&rsquo;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Slaves&rsquo; fidelity to their masters&rsquo; cause &mdash; a falsehood constructed to support claims that the war was not about slavery &mdash; has long formed one of the staple arguments in Lost Cause ideology.&#8221; [2]</p>
<p>In this paper we discuss a graphic example of Blight&rsquo;s contention by examining a Civil War-era posed studio photograph of black Union soldiers with a white officer. We maintain that this photograph has been deliberately falsified in recent years by an unknown person/s sympathetic to the Confederacy. This falsified or fabricated photo, purporting to be of the 1st Louisiana Native Guards (Confederate), has been taken to promote Neo-Confederate views, to accuse Union propagandists of duplicity, and to show that black soldiers were involved in the armed defense of the Confederacy. As of the date of this website this photograph is being sold on the web by an on-line retailer, www.rebelstore.com, which promotes itself as &#8220;The Internet&rsquo;s Original Rebel Store,&#8221; and advertises this photograph as a legitimate photo of &#8220;Members of the first all Black Confederate Unit organized in New Orleans in 1861.&#8221; [3]</p>
<p><b>The Photograph</b></p>
<p>In a photographic studio somewhere in Philadelphia, probably in early 1864, a group of black Union soldiers posed for a rather somber photograph with a white officer. We know nothing of this group, but it may have formed part of a unit that had been recently formed in the union army [4]. In his preliminary emancipation proclamation of September 1862, President Lincoln announced that the federal government would enroll African-American soldiers as of New Year&rsquo;s Day 1863. By June of that year, a committee of prominent Philadelphians had been appointed to raise black regiments. By the war&rsquo;s end the federal government had raised 166 black units of infantry, cavalry and artillery totaling 185,000 combatants. Eleven of these units had been formed at Camp William Penn, &#8220;the largest camp existing for the organization and disciplining of Colored Troops,&#8221; located in Chelten Hills (now Cheltenham Township, just outside the northern city limit of Philadelphia). The white officers commanding the troops were trained under the auspices of the Free Military School for the Command of Colored Troops established in Philadelphia in 1863. [5]</p>
<p>The black and white studio photograph (Figure 1) was greatly embellished and used to create a colored lithograph that served as a recruitment poster to entice black men to join the Federal army. On the poster (Figure 2), the union officer&rsquo;s uniform is dark blue, that of the soldiers is very light blue (bordering on grey), but their caps/kepis are dark blue and the bugles on the caps are clearly visible. Other embellishments and additions by the engraver to the original black and white photograph include the tent on the left, the federal flag, the mountainous background, the tree on the right, and the drummer boy. Published by the Supervisory Committee for Recruiting Colored Regiments and engraved by P.S. Duval &amp; Son in Philadelphia, no publication date is given on the poster, but it was probably done in early 1864 (see note 4). The poster caption reads &#8220;United States Soldiers at Camp &lsquo;William Penn&#8221; Philadelphia&#8221; with a sub-caption reading, &#8220;Rally Round the Flag, boys! Rally once again, Shouting the battle cry of FREEDOM&#8221; (Figure 2). [6]</p>
<p>Although the recruitment poster seems to have been relatively well-known to bibliographers of Americana as well as Civil War historians and others interested in the Civil War, the original photo from which the poster was derived was apparently fairly obscure. However, in its July 1973 issue, the widely read Civil War Times Illustrated published a copy of the original photograph which had been submitted to the magazine by James Spina, an antiques dealer who had purchased it years before. [7] The photo published in Civil War Times Illustrated was a slightly cropped version of the original (for example, absent are the handwritten numbers of &#8220;1895 x 1895&#8221; which were scratched into the photographer&rsquo;s original negative and appear in reverse in the upper right hand corner; also deleted is a small portion on the right wall, as well as part of the ceiling shown in the original photograph), but was substantially the same photo as the original (compare Figure 1 and Figure 3). The photograph published in the Civil War Times Illustrated was re-published in 1982 in the well-respected and accessible The Embattled Confederacy, the third volume in a monumental photographic history of the Civil War. [8]</p>
<p><b>Retouching History</b></p>
<p>Sometime after its publication in either the Civil War Times Illustrated or The Embattled Confederacy, the photograph was scanned and digitally manipulated (we have not been able to establish which of the two publications was the source for this manipulation), to produce the photograph shown in Figure 4 with the caption &#8220;1st Louisiana Native Guard, 1861&#8221; that is being sold by www.rebelstore.com.</p>
<p>The actual 1st Louisiana Native Guards, [9] consisting of Afro-Creoles, was formed of about 1,500 men in April 1861 and was formally accepted as part of the Louisiana militia in May 1862. The Native Guards unit (one of three all-black companies) never saw combat while in Confederate service, and was largely kept at arm&rsquo;s length by city and state officials; in fact, it often lacked proper uniforms and equipment. &#8220;The Confederate authorities,&#8221; James Hollandsworth has written, &#8220;never intended to use black troops for any mission of real importance. If the Native Guards were good for anything, it was for public display; free blacks fighting for Southern rights made good copy for the newspapers.&#8221; The unit apparently was never committed to the Confederate cause, and appears to have disobeyed orders to evacuate New Orleans with other Confederate forces; instead it surrendered to Union troops in April 1862. [10]</p>
<p>Circumstantial evidence alone raises the suspicion that the Louisiana Native Guards photo purchased from www.rebelstore.com (Figure 4) is a fabrication. Given the enormous number of publications and known photographs of Civil War soldiers, it is more than slightly curious that a photograph as striking as one showing armed black soldiers in the Confederate Army has apparently not surfaced in these publications, in the many books and websites devoted to Civil War imagery, or even in the enormous Civil War collections of the Prints and Photographs Division of the Library of Congress. [11] Moreover, several historians and specialists on the Civil War we consulted could not recall having seen this specific photograph of &#8220;1st Louisiana Native Guard 1861&#8221; in any publication while, at the same time, it is known that photographs such as the one shown in Figure 1 were used to make recruitment posters for the Union army. [12] Finally, even though we recognize that forgotten documents and photographs may yet await discovery and be brought to light, as far as we are aware every identified published photograph of the Louisiana Native Guards, its officers or enlisted men, depicts them in Union uniforms. It is also noteworthy that the four major published studies of the Louisiana Native Guards during the last forty years do not include a &#8220;1st Louisiana Native Guard 1861&#8221; photograph nor is there any mention of any members of the regiment as ever having posed for a group studio photograph while in Confederate service. [13] Nor are there any Confederate broadsides, songs, poetry, recruitment posters or similar material indicative of Afro-Confederate troop recruitment during 1861-64 similar to the Union&rsquo;s well-publicized, documented efforts during the same period.</p>
<p><b>Image Analysis</b></p>
<p>Although we believe the circumstantial evidence is very strong, the case for falsification rests most solidly on a detailed comparison of photographs shown in Figures 3 and 4. A careful examination of these two photographs reveals that the alleged Louisiana Native Guards photo (Figure 4) is a rather amateurish digital manipulation, most probably, as discussed above, of the photo published in either the Civil War Times Illustrated or The Embattled Confederacy volume (Figure 3). In either case, using Adobe Photoshop or a similar application, the image in Figure 3 was cropped (the most obvious deletions, clearly visible to the naked eye, are the white officer and his sword along with the soldier standing immediately adjacent to him; and the door frame and part of the soldier on the right). An examination of the foreground and background in Figure 4 reveals that the patterned floor and wall coverings visible in Figure 1 have been digitally erased or painted over. A Union belt buckle (with the block letters &#8220;US&#8221;), is faintly visible on the sixth black soldier from the left in Figure 1; however, because Figure 4 is a lower resolution derivative, the belt buckle on the same soldier (now the fifth from the left) is obscured. (It stretches credulity to suppose that Confederate soldiers would be photographed wearing belt buckles of the Federal Army!)</p>
<p>By itself, the text superimposed on the &#8220;1st Louisiana Native Guard&#8221; image (Figure 4) offers clear evidence of falsification. A sampling of a wide range of Civil War photographs has yielded none that contain superimposed text. On close examination, the text (letters) in Figure 4 is much sharper and clearer than the underlying image and does not exhibit the same quality loss as the photograph itself because it has not undergone successive analog and digital reproduction. What is most telling, however, is that the text, which gives the impression of being a nineteenth-century style font, is, in fact, a modern font face named &#8220;Algerian&#8221;. The Algerian font, which has no lower case letters, has come bundled with multiple versions of Microsoft Word, including Word 95, Word 6.0, and Word 7.0. The font vendor Elsner+Flake sells a version of the font, EF Algerian, available for online purchase. [14] It should be stressed that once a font is installed, it is accessible by every application on the computer, including image manipulation software. Perhaps the most damning evidence with respect to the text is shown in the &#8220;1st Louisiana Native Guard&#8221; thumbnail on the www.rebelstore.com website (Figure 5). Although the low-resolution text is not quite legible, the font face clearly contains both uppercase and lowercase letters. The Algerian font used in the photo purchased from rebelstore.com (Figure 4) is composed solely of uppercase letters. The lettering in the thumbnail image is another font style. This inconsistency suggests that the image has been manipulated at least twice, at least once while in the possession of www.rebelstore.com.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the handwritten numbers of &#8220;1895 x 1895&#8221; which, as noted earlier, appear in reverse in the upper right-hand corner of Figure 1 had been cropped from each of the subsequent generation images published in Civil War Times Illustrated and The Embattled Confederacy. The absence of these numbers in the image sold by www.rebelstore.com also suggests that its image was derived from either The Embattled Confederacy or from Civil War Times Illustrated. These numbers, which may have been some kind of catalog reference by the photographer, were hand-scratched on the emulsion side of the original glass plate negative; considerable search has failed to locate this original plate.</p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>In sum, the evidence available to us makes it abundantly clear that the Union recruitment poster shown in Figure 2 was in fact based on a legitimate photograph, and that the photo labeled &#8220;1st Louisiana Native Guard 1861&#8221; that is being sold by www.rebelstore.com as a 19th century photograph is, in fact, a falsification. We cannot determine when this falsification occurred, but it was done within the last decade or so &mdash; judging from the presence of artifacts yielded by digital manipulation and the superimposition of a modern font face.</p>
<p>The specific motives of the fabricator/s of the Louisiana Native Guard photo can only be conjectured, but the manipulation of photographic imagery for ideological/political purposes is a well-established practice. As the editors of Civil War Times Illustrated wrote in their August 2004 issue (p. 80): &#8220;It is tempting to think of photographs as evidence, documents of what reality was like in some specific time and place. But from the earliest days of camera craft, photographers have been much more than mere recorders. At times, they can be outright masters of illusion.&#8221; The editors are discussing a more innocent Civil War photograph of a junior Union officer in field dress. He is posing in a studio in front of a false backdrop to create the impression that the photograph was taken outdoors against a rustic wooden fence. It is commonplace to observe that pictures &#8220;do not speak for themselves.&#8221; [15] The photographs of the Louisiana Native Guards offer an interesting illustration of that adage and show how a legitimate photograph can be altered and used to advance and support a particular contemporary political or ideological perspective in the present-day United States.</p>

			<p>As for &#8216;retouching&rsquo; I would be looking for this kind of thing in old news footage appearing on TV today, back before &#8216;studio audiences&rsquo; had to be hand picked for their &#8216;diversity&rsquo;. In fact, I bet that&rsquo;s what this is all about. The people in charge of the information, like this site &#8216;retouching history&rsquo; aren&rsquo;t dumb. This type of article is a typical of an official response to rumors that the establishment is engaging in fraud. Say make the opposite claim. It&rsquo;s the left who controls the information and then would claim every other version is a &#8216;revision&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Thus 50 years after Western science eradicates Small Pox the official position becomes instead, Western man eradicated people of color with small pox. I think there&rsquo;s a website for this called &#8216;inverted world&rsquo;. </p>

			<p>  Handler and Tuite can pontificate and bloviate all they want to about retouched photographs and falsification, but the fact remains that there were 30,000 to 65,000 (some sources say as many as 100,000) blacks who served as soldiers   &mdash;   not bodyservants of slaveowners or the like   &mdash;   in the Confederate forces. Google &#8220;Confederacy + black soldiers&#8221; and you&rsquo;ll see documentation of this. The old saw about there being &#8220;no black Confederate troops&#8221; is a piece of Unionist-history claptrap. The difference between Union and Confederate black soldiers was, those in the Union Army were almost always in separate, all-black units, while those in the Confederate forces usually fought as part of integrated units   &mdash;   whether the Confederate historians ever acknowledged it or not is another story.</p>

			<p>There were black Confederates. However, most probably did not have combat roles. My great grandfather ran away to join the 54th Alabama Infantry Regiment at age 16. A young slave named Clark ran away with him. Clark did not take up arms but he helped as best he could under tough circumstances, foraging for food, cleaning equipment, repairing clothes, etc. Clark went through many of the campaigns, including Island No. 10, a year in a rat infested prison camp in Wisconsin, Vicksburg, and finally Atlanta where my ancestor was wounded. After the war Clark helped bring my great grandfather (minus his right leg) home from Georgia. After the Freedman&rsquo;s Bureau failed to deliver on its promises, our family gave Clark 40 acres and a mule. He lived on his little farm near our family well into the 20th Century. </p>

			<p>This lengthy article is a good eye-opener for parents and taxpayers of how difficult it is today for conservative White teachers to select an accurate text for adoption by school history departments.  </p>
<p>The first Western Civ I used at my NE Illinois high school had almost no mention of Jesus and Christianity, highlighted so-called black achievement in Egypt, and spoke admiringly of the Sviet &#8220;experiment&#8221;.  Needless to say, much of what I taught was not from our glitzy, expensive book.</p>
<p>When I finally got on the text adoption committee several years later, I volunteered to be the chair of it.  After one meeting, I realized that the diversity, &#8216;world cultures&rsquo; crowd in the group wanted a newer but still blatantly horrendous book.  Since many of these folks were young and drank a lot, I scheduled meetings for after school on Fridays.  Thye rarely came and I basically became a committee of one.</p>
<p>It took me weeks and weeks to finally find a text that 1) accurately explained Christianity&rsquo;s mammoth influence on Western society, 2) put communism in its rightful, evil place, and 3) did not over-emphasize any progress allegedly achieved by Africans.</p>
<p>Every reader of AmRen needs to check his/her children&rsquo;s social studies texts at the beginning (right now!) of the school year to see if the history their kids take will be black-washed, stalinized, or de-Christianized.  The article above is stark evidence of what the diversity, hate America crowd will routinely do.  </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m not really sure what to make of this.  While I&rsquo;ve heard of individual black Confederate combatants, I&rsquo;m sure this would have been the exception, and certainly there were no black units documented in Confederate combat roles.</p>
<p>The leftist establishment would love to &#8220;get the goods&#8221; on the neo-Confederates, but so what if some guy doctored up some picture and falsely claimed that it portrayed a black Rebel unit?  Yeah, deceit always deserves to be be exposed, but in this case, what&rsquo;s the big deal besides the fact that someone got &#8220;taken&#8221; by purchasing a bogus photo?</p>
<p>On the other hand, some of the neo-Confederates are all-too-eager to court blacks&rsquo; approval as if that were necessary to validate the &#8220;Lost Cause&#8221; in today&rsquo;s PC world.  This is a denial of some of the premises that helped to define the Confederacy (though white supremacy was the the status quo on both sides of the Mason-Dixon Line), and it&rsquo;s a huge mistake to be &#8220;negotiating&#8221; (i.e. compromising, then deferring, then capitulating) with blacks over Southern history and heritage.</p>
<p>Jim&rsquo;s post (8:26 PM, August 27) is fascinating, and it rings with accuracy, authenticity, and the kind of inter-racial compassion that was largely lost in the war&rsquo;s aftermath of Reconstruction and Radical rule.</p>
<p>Dr. Smith (7:16 PM, August 27)) has an interesting take on this as well, and the AmRen archive articles are an education in themselves.<br>

<p>You&rsquo;re right about this. I did read my children&rsquo;s books from school and helped them with all of their studies. I was appalled at the lack of HISTORY in the history books. As I said before, very little of WWII, nothing of Korea or Viet-Nam (rather defining moments of history) but page after page of MLK and the contributions to history by blacks. My children know all about history because I am a student of history myself and have an extensive library of EVERYTHING!! and they were always free to read the books and did often. I and they have library cards still, but they are aware that libraries are also subject to the same bias.</p>

			<p>The Post by Jim at 8:26 PM on August 27. Is typical of the private relation that existed between many Black and Whites throughout the South up until the mid 20th century. Many Black slave were well treated and loyal to their masters. Many times the White master that owned one or two slaves, lived at the same economic level and work just as hard along side his slaves. Northerns and now many modern day Southern did not understand this relationship. Pres. Carter wrote about this relationship in his book.</p>
<p>Face it you cannot buy the loyalty that Clark showed to his young master. I want to thank Jim for sharing that story with us.</p>

			<p>Why anyone would want to depict blacks as being on the side of the confederacy is beyond me.  Of course the purpose for doing so, is an attempt to justify the war between the states as strictly a states&rsquo; rights issue, which it was positively, but there&rsquo;s no need to include blacks to give the matter legitimacy.</p>

			<p>I am aware of Photoshop but have never used it.  That said, I have seen manipulated photos, some generated by Photoshop.</p>
<p>Given the ability to &#8216;create&rsquo; new items in any given photos, I have wondered for sometime why I have not heard of any defense attorneys in criminal cases challenging photos presented as evidence.  The attitude of winning at any cost is common in America today.  It exists in the court system.</p>
<p>Given the ability to manipulate photos today, how can any photo be accepted as being true and correct anymore?</p>

			<p>Alternate history author Harry Turtledove did some major-league research before writing my all-time favorite novel of the genre, <i>The Guns of the South</i>, in which the good guys win the Civil War in 1864 after being equipped with AK-47 rifles. (No kidding!) A slave named George Ballantine joined the 47th North Carolina along with his owner, then stayed with the regiment after his owner deserted. The excellent book <i>The South Was Right!</i> by James &amp; Walter Kennedy documents several blacks, both free and slave, who saw action in the war on the Confederate side. So IMHO whether the photo in question is real or not is irrelevant. Even though it wasn&rsquo;t official government policy, many blacks fought for Southern independence, whether the PC revisionists like it or not. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cleburne" rel="nofollow">General Cleburne</a> advocated making it official, but that didn&rsquo;t happen until early 1865, by which time it was too late.) In addition, several thousand free blacks owned slaves whether the PC revisionists like it or not.</p>

			<p>Men of all races, creed, religions and colors were in Confederate army units, all mixed together.  There were little of no &#8216;all-black&rsquo; units, as segregation in the ranks was a Union practice, not a Southern one.  Gen. Beauregard&rsquo;s command had so many languages that it took some time before commands were spread through the ranks, and Beauregard is credited with inventing the now-humorous oath, &#8220;Sacredam!&#8221;<br>
  Handler and Tuite should do a lot more research in Southern libraries before they write any more articles.  ;-)</p>

			<p>  Whatever, fact remains ; Lincoln would reiterate over and over again before 1863 that the war was not about slavery, Congress would eventually make a declaration stating the same thing . Lincoln only agreed to black units after he came to the realization the war just might be lost without them . There were tens of thousands of slave owners in the Union ranks . When the war began, slaveowners were not breaking any law by having slaves .And if the Civil War was about slavery, then the Revolution would have had to have been also . You just can&rsquo;t have it both ways.And it certainly would not hurt to keep a watchful eye on civil rights era photos, even on old movies and TV shows . I hope and pray someone is .</p>
