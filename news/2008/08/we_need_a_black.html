<h1><a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2008/08/rushmore-black.html">We Need a Black Google</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alana Semuels, Los Angeles Times, August 15, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Is Google too white? No, we&rsquo;re not talking about the white home page that&rsquo;s so bright it motivates some people to change its appearance to save energy. We&rsquo;re wondering if it is too white, as in Caucasian, because so many white people use Google that it returns results that alienate the rest of the population.</p>
<p>Johnny C. Taylor thinks so. In April he launched RushmoreDrive, a search engine that returns results more targeted at the black community (it&rsquo;s named after the North Carolina street where its offices are).</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>By way of example, he said that a black person searching for &#8220;whitney,&#8221; for instance, probably wouldn&rsquo;t be looking for the Whitney Museum of Art, which comes up first on Google, or Whitney Bank, which comes up second. Instead, Taylor said, the searcher would likely be looking for Whitney Houston, who doesn&rsquo;t come up in Google until No. 4.  That&rsquo;s why a search for &#8220;Whitney&#8221; on RushmoreDrive, which is part of Barry Diller&rsquo;s IAC/InterActiveCorp conglomerate, turns up the vocalist as its first result.</p>
<p>How does a website know what black people want? RushmoreDrive did a whole lot of research, watching where Web surfers who lived in certain areas with large black populations, such as Atlanta, were going online. The site&rsquo;s creators made note of what black users were clicking on and developed an algorithm that gives &#8220;black&#8221; links more weight. A search for &#8220;diabetes,&#8221; for example, shows the American Diabetes Assn. as the first result on both Google and RushmoreDrive. But RushmoreDrive shows &#8220;statistics about African-Americans and Diabetes&#8221; as its second result and a link to the diabetes section on blackhealthcare.com as its fifth.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Search engines return results based on pages that they crawl through, but they can&rsquo;t crawl through every page on the Internet. RushmoreDrive also digs deeper into pages it thinks black people might visit more, such as soul food site chitterlings.com, Taylor said.</p>
<p>The search engine has already picked up advertisers such as Coca-Cola and General Motors and had nearly 800,000 unique visitors in June. Taylor says RushmoreDrive is a new kind of search engine that he says focuses on &#8220;identity search.&#8221; In other words, it guesses what people are looking for based on the group they identify with.</p>
<p>Since search engines learn from what people are clicking on, RushmoreDrive had a small problem immediately after its launch: So many white members of the media were visiting the site that the results became skewed and turned up more &#8220;white&#8221; results, Taylor said. That&rsquo;s why the company is embarking on a big publicity campaign now, making appearances on the Tavis Smiley and Steve Harvey shows and sponsoring a 10-city gospel tour featuring Regina Belle.</p>

			<p>If a white person had started a black-oriented search engine, that, e.g. returned pages on Whitney Houston as opposed to the Whitney Museum when one searches for &#8220;whitney,&#8221; then he&rsquo;d be tarred and feathered for racism, bigotry, promulgating stereotypes.</p>

			<p>I guess Johnny C. feels there is nothing worse than for a black person to be exposed to a link for the Whitney Museum while searching for the latest gossip on Whitney Houston.</p>

			<p>If I RushmoreDrive/Black Google the term &#8216;blackhole&rsquo;, will it now avoid NASA&rsquo;s site and point directly to an ebony prostitution site?</p>
<p>What about &#8216;Dark Knight&rsquo;, do I get Batman with the new Joker, or some Obama swoon site?</p>

			<p>This article is so dumb. First of all blacks are migrating away from California (especially Los Angeles) back to the South in record numbers right now to escape the La Raza invaders. Secondly, if blacks want to create an ethnocentric search engine geared toward blacks all they have to do is do it. They don&rsquo;t need to whine in the newspapers about it. </p>

<p>This almost sounds like the beginnings of a bad racist joke, but as this story is apparently the real deal, it only goes to show that truth is stranger than fiction.</p>

			<p>Until now, I&rsquo;d thought I&rsquo;d heard it all. So all of us whites (AmRenners?) are alienating the rest of the population? I didn&rsquo;t realize we posted so darned much stuff on the Internet, but I guess that shouldn&rsquo;t be too unusual for the race that split the atom and sent a man to the moon.</p>
<p>Fromj now on, we&rsquo;ll just have to be more sensitive and quit posting things that are so Eurocentric :-).</p>
<p>Honestly, how much do blacks use the Internet anyway?</p>

			<p>That&rsquo;s fine&hellip;in fact I like it. There&rsquo;s a &#8216;white&rsquo; search engine called cuil.</p>
<p>www.cuil.com</p>
<p>Cuil is an old Irish word meaning knowledge. I supposed the blacks named their&rsquo;s RushmoreDrive because there is no african word for knowledge.</p>

			<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ll be sure to set my default search engine right away. I guess these people don&rsquo;t understand that they can string multiple words and phrases together for more defined searches. Though that would require the additional effort of reading the directions and tips. </p>

			<p>So they´re not interested in museums and banks, but in female black singers, Freddie Mac and diabetes. Now why am I not surprised? (g)</p>
<p>Jokes aside, can you imagine the outrage if a White hetero male does something like that? I admit to problems with Google also, as my specialty (ore geology) is too small a market. But if all it entails is having to read five pages instead of one, I think I can live with it ;).</p>

			<p>For 100&rsquo;s of years the blacks have had and still have their own unique communication system, they should stick with what they know best. Unlike the energy draining white mans monstrosity, their is eco-friendly, easily portable and requires no electricity to run.<br>
Does not need hardware, software, programs and the like and is able to communicate their entire philosophy, science, news and history. It is known in the west as the jungle drum.</p>

			<p>You mean they have to look down to item number four to find &#8220;Whitney Houston&#8221;? Poor babies! I have a suggestion: actually type in &#8220;Whitney Houston&#8221;. The singer will come up on #1. It works. I&rsquo;ve tried it. Trying to make an improved search engine is one thing. Claiming that a search engine is &#8220;too white&#8221; because a black cultural reference doesn&rsquo;t come up #1 on every search is just ridiculous. </p>

			<p>The Rushmore Drive search engine seems to be a lot more devoted to ads than content - unless, of course, the audience it seeks is extremely interested in pregnant celebrities. </p>
<p>BTW: Take note of Rushmore Drive&rsquo;s sponsors - not companies I&rsquo;ll be patronizing in the near future.</p>

			<p>Is this so-called &#8220;black google&#8221; written at the 6th grade level?  If it&rsquo;s above that, more than half the African piopulation will be unable to comprehend the vocabulary.</p>
<p>Will it give copious space to African &#8220;inventions&#8221; in America?  Or will the articles be research-driven and accurate?</p>
<p>Finally, what will explanations be of words such as &#8216;equality&rsquo;, &#8216;toleration&rsquo;, &#8216;diversity&rsquo;, and &#8216;discrimination&rsquo; be?  Here&rsquo;s wagering that the articles on these topics won&rsquo;t be the same as those I read. </p>

<p>But public whining is what brings in the public tax dollars to help fund these ridiculous grievance ventures. I&rsquo;m sure no one here doesn&rsquo;t miss the figurative open palm reaching out for some government subsidies for this necessary research, do they?</p>
<p>Funny how the argument presented for this &#8220;black Google&#8221; (Bloogle?) implies that blacks&rsquo; motivations for using cutting edge search engine algorithms are restricted to how long to fry chitterlings, or how much the judge set Whitney&rsquo;s bail at this week.</p>

<p>The black person in this example is lazy and stupid. Lazy, because he can&rsquo;t type another few letters (&#8220;Houston&#8221;); stupid, because he&rsquo;s unaware of any other thing part of whose name is &#8220;Whitney.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perphaps that&rsquo;s the point.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Johnny C. Taylor thinks so. In April he launched RushmoreDrive, a search engine that returns results more targeted at the black community (it&rsquo;s named after the North Carolina street where its offices are).&#8221;</p>
<p>Excellent idea, now if he would only follow through and create a separate state for blacks he would fill a much needed service for the black community.</p>
<p>And the sooner he starts the happier I will be.</p>

<p>The japanese started this. Giving the customer precisely what they want at as quick a speed as possible <br>

			<p>This is great! The more Blacks self-segregate, even &#8220;virtually&#8221; in cyberspace, the better for us(Whites). Blacks continue to demonstrate that they are not, and do not wish to be like Whites - their interests are not our interests, their ways are not our ways! </p>
<p>This type of thing only supports the argument for segregation, albeit in a roundabout fashion, obviously lost on Blacks themsleves. That many Blacks, in the year 2008, still believe they are so different from Whites that even search engines must be taylored to their interests speaks volumes about the state of race in America, despite the illusions on TV and the media that insist otherwise. </p>

			<p>Rushmore Drive.  Just tried it out.  Appears to be an excellent search engine.  The layout is better than Google&rsquo;s.  Easier to read.</p>

			<p>What is incredibly ironic (besides the obvious laugh factor) is that Google (as most of Silicon Valley) is completely in the tank for &#8216;diversity and multiculturalism.&rsquo; They are just as anti-American and anti-straight, white male as almost every other tech site. Why? Because they&rsquo;re cowards, just like the rest of them. Anybody who takes the above positions knows there won&rsquo;t be any social repercussions and you will be hailed by the &#8216;morally superior&rsquo; effete, elite as being &#8216;progressive.&rsquo; Any programmer or techie knows this.</p>
<p>Apparently, that&rsquo;s just not good enough for Johnny C. Taylor. I wonder how many (black) hits he&rsquo;s going to get on his site?</p>
<p><b>As an after thought, maybe some black people were keying in &#8220;Whit<i>e</i>ney&#8221; (Hey, ya never know!)</b><br>

			<p>Not for one second would I suggest &#8216;Noogle&rsquo; as a search engine.. and all the colours used in the name be changed to black only. You won&rsquo;t believe this but I just paused typing this post and &#8216;Googled&rsquo; &#8216;Noogle&rsquo; and it really did come up with a site for blacks..number 4 on the list! Curses, another good idea down the Swanee! I just KNOW you&rsquo;re going to try it out! Probably crash the site with White interest but I can&rsquo;t see black africans searching for &#8216;Noogle&rsquo; unless they &#8216;Google&rsquo;!!!</p>

			<p>Blacks would have to develop it completely independently.<br>
Can you image the law suits if on &#8216;bloogle&rsquo; you typed in a search for &#8216;food&rsquo;, and the results were all about fried chicken and water melon?<br>
Plus I thought search engines worked by finding the most popular results world wide, based on keyword matching; wouldn&rsquo;t they need a black internet too?<br>

			<p>How about your web cam linked to Google? That way Google can identify a person not only by race, but by sex and age as well. A friend of mine had a 10 year old daughter that was looking up Persian cats on the net.  She got the Persian Sex Kittens instead.</p>
<p>Actually I believe that you can allow Google to track your searches and build a profile of you. That way they can direct your searches toward your interests. </p>
<p>The problems comes in when Google turns your search profiles over to the government the way they did in China. If you have  too many of the &#8220;wrong&#8221; kind of searches, you could be charge with a hate crime. So every time you do a search on &#8220;David Dukes&#8221; you have to throw in some searches on &#8220;Jessie Jackson&#8221; and &#8220;Al Sharpton&#8221; to keep the thought/search police happy.</p>

&#8220;By way of example, he said that a black person searching for &ldquo;whitney,&rdquo; for instance, probably wouldn&rsquo;t be looking for the Whitney Museum of Art, which comes up first on Google, or Whitney Bank, which comes up second. Instead, Taylor said, the searcher would likely be looking for Whitney Houston, who doesn&rsquo;t come up in Google until No. 4&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
As other posters have noted, adding the keyword &#8220;Houston&#8221; to their &#8220;Whitney&#8221; searches would solve this (mostly imaginary) &#8220;problem.&#8221; Anyone who does vague, ambiguous, one-word searches isn&rsquo;t going to get the results they want regardless of skin color. </p>
<p>Similarly, adding the keywords &#8220;African American&#8221; to their &#8220;Whitney&#8221; searches would also help blacks find their way to &#8220;Whitney Houston&#8221;   &mdash;   thereby rescuing the poor dears from the terrible racist injustice of having to look at the Whitney Museum homepage for a few seconds.</p>
<p>For that matter, does this entire new RushmoreDrive search engine do anything more than add the keywords &#8220;African American&#8221; to whatever the searcher has typed in? </p>
<p>Speaking of word choices, everyone please note the wording of this LA Times headline: Not something descriptive and objective such as &#8220;Entrepreneur Proposes Black Search Engine.&#8221; </p>
<p>Not even an interrogative such as &#8220;A Black Alternative to Google?&#8221; </p>
<p>But rather the subjective   &mdash;   and frankly RACIST   &mdash;   declaration that &#8220;We Need a Black Google.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8221;? </p>
<p>&#8220;Need&#8221;? </p>
<p>We do? I don&rsquo;t. And I can&rsquo;t see how blacks do, either. <br>

			<p>Might as well. There are black only comedy reviews, cable tv - BET, Starz-Black, etc.<br>
What about whites only clubs, restaurants, TV shows and channels, etc. ?<br>
Now that&rsquo;s racism. BUT anything and EVERYTHING against whites is fine. What a joke.<br>
In this country, the media makes ignorant blacks look cool - to be stupid, dress like a clown, act like a mushmouthed fool. So stupid white teens follow right in line. Now we have adults like this, complete wastes of space. <br>
White men have given NEARLY everything away. Their rights, their freedom, gun control, the constitution, etc. <br>
It&rsquo;s time to take it all back.</p>

<p>Then type in &#8220;black people&#8221; and do the same.</p>

			<p>I remember reading a story about the New Black Panther party and their attempts to create their own web page, seems it was forever crashing, many people who visited the site received a variety of viruses, they eventually blamed it on racism from the white devils, and the only remedy that worked was hiring whites to build and maintain their homepage.</p>

			<p>Seems like a good idea.  A black person entering &#8220;renaissance&#8221; as a search term would most likely be looking for something about the Harlem Renaissance.  A white person, of course, would be looking for American Renaissance. ;)</p>

<p>&gt; They never did and we shouldn&rsquo;t want them.  But they do want us to be dominated by theirs.  Being only 14% of the American population, Black American culture has to be dominating America now.  Just turn on your television and look.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve just searched for the Belgian football (soccer) team &#8220;K.F.C. Germinal Beerschot&#8221; and, upon searching for &#8220;KFC&#8221;, there were no references to it until page 11 of the search results. For 11 full pages and more, Kentucky Fried Chicken dominated the results. It&rsquo;s quite obvious that so many black people use Google that it returns results that alienate the rest of the population. </p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just visited www.rushmoredrive.com, where the popular searches include &#8220;Sho Nuff&#8221; and &#8220;Kanye West Fatburger&#8221;, and discovered that the first result for &#8220;Whitney&#8221; is indeed www.whitneyhouston.com. This is followed immediately by Whitney museaum and then by Whitney bank. </p>
<p>So well done to Mr Taylor and &#8220;Black Web Enterprises Inc&#8221; for this remarkable ethnocentric achievement. You&rsquo;ve only to adopt the Malcolm X segregationist economic model, and only allow black advertisers, and you&rsquo;ll be well on the way to your own black nation. The only thing then would be to cut yourself off from white tax money. I know, it&rsquo;s hard and you need your fix, but you&rsquo;ll be fine after the cold turkey (or the warm chicken).</p>
