						<p>Antiguan prime minister Baldwin Spencer said the murder of Briton Catherine Mullany was a threat to the Caribbean island&rsquo;s survival and called for Scotland Yard&rsquo;s help with the investigation. Here is the full text of his national address:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fellow Antiguans and Barbudans; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Residents and Friends of Antigua and Barbuda: </p>
<p>&ldquo;In a season which, traditionally, has been known for its revelry, pageantry and cultural display, this evening, I address you with a great sense of sadness. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Antigua and Barbuda has long been a nation of law-abiding citizens and residents. We have come to cherish the peace and security that our nation has enjoyed and shared with our numerous visitors from the United Kingdom, United States, Europe and other parts of the world. </p>
<p>&ldquo;In the past decade, however, we have been nearly overwhelmed by events of crime and violence that are alien to this part of the world, which, for generations, has been characterised by peace and tranquility; and I know that every law-abiding person in Antigua and Barbuda is concerned. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Over the last several weeks, in particular, the nation&rsquo;s sensibilities have been outraged by the continuing incidents of rapes, robberies, and shootings &mdash; most recently the wanton slaying of a young Antiguan pursuing studies in Cuba, Rafique Kareem Harris, and the senseless killing of a 31-year-old British tourist, Dr Catherine Mullany, and the shooting of her husband Ben. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The nation&rsquo;s sympathies go out to the relatives and friends of these victims and, indeed, all who have been victims of such violence. Beyond sympathy, however, I assure you that we will employ every legal measure to hunt down and bring to justice those who are responsible for the senseless acts. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Fellow Antiguans and Barbudans; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Residents and Friends of Antigua and Barbuda: </p>
<p>&ldquo;The rising incidence of crime and violence in our society is of serious concern to your government. However, it is important to state that the recent criminal activities are not attacks on any government or any political party. They are attacks on Antigua and Barbuda. They are attacks on every law-abiding citizen, resident and visitor to this country. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The truth is unpalatable to some people. But the recent killing of Dr Mullany and the brutal attack on her husband are threats to our very survival as they directly threaten our main industry: tourism. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Our nation has always been known as a safe destination. Our very brand is based on people being safe in Antigua and Barbuda. &ldquo;Accordingly, your government will not tolerate any action that will tarnish the reputation of this country. Your government will not tolerate murder and violent crime within our society. Your government will not stand idly by while any of its citizens or our visitors are cut down by those who have no respect for human life or the nation&rsquo;s tranquility. No, your government will vigorously pursue every criminal and hold him or her accountable for their actions. But I must remind you, tonight, that you are an integral part of the government and, as such, you are essential to this fight against crime and violence. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Earlier this week, I was advised of the arrest of a Jamaican who was deported from the United Kingdom to Jamaica, from whence he was deported, again &mdash; this time to Antigua &mdash; on the basis of a fraudulently obtained Antigua &amp; Barbuda passport. Diligent police investigations have now revealed that the application for said passport and the relevant photograph had been signed and certified by an Opposition Parliamentarian on the strength of the documents of a dead Antiguan. </p>
<p>&ldquo;No longer can any of us afford to give comfort and shelter to those who break the law and wreak havoc on the society. </p>
<p>&ldquo;While our law officials are mandated to provide a greater sense of security to every resident and visitor, you, too, as citizens and residents, must place a greater sense of trust in them as they carry out their duties. </p>
<p>&ldquo;You, too, must take personal responsibility and play your part in our fight against crime to ensure the safety of each other. You must report any suspicious activity to the police and you must freely offer information to the authorities. The police cannot do it alone. Your representatives cannot do it alone. Only if we combine all our efforts can we truly overcome this problem. </p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my clarion call to all, regardless of nationality or political affiliation. Seventeen-year-old Ken Watkins Junior, all the young victims of crime, and their families and friends are depending on you. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Fellow Antiguans and Barbudans; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Residents and Friends of Antigua and Barbuda: </p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a fact that this country has made significant gains over the past four years, and as a government and a people, we cannot allow lawlessness and crime to erode the tangible benefits and the quality of life that our country now enjoys. </p>
<p>&ldquo;However, we need the help of not only every citizen and resident, but we need the help of our international partners. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Year after year, we have seen a marked increase in the number of criminals being deported from the United Kingdom and the United States back to the Caribbean. Over 280 criminals have been deported back to our 108-square-mile island during the past 10 years. </p>
<p>&ldquo;To any small island-developing-state, this figure is astronomically high. In ours, particularly, with its small population, these criminal deportees, with skills developed and nurtured in the US and UK, are impacting tremendously on our society. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We, as the Caribbean Community, have raised our concerns with our international partners; however, the criminals are still being deported. In many cases they are being sent to countries with which they have little or no connection, except for the fact that they were born here. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Every citizen and resident deserves to live in peace and security, and your government will ensure that this remains true for our nation. Over the past two weeks, I have met with members of the National Security Council to ensure that safety and security prevail during the Carnival season and beyond. I can assure you that we have recommitted ourselves to ensuring that every officer and every resource within the Royal Police Force of Antigua and Barbuda and the Antigua and Barbuda Defence Force are mobilised to reduce and prevent crime and violence within our shores. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Since 2004, we have instituted a number of measures to counteract crime in our country, and we will, necessarily, be getting tougher: </p>
<p>&ldquo;Hence, it is the intention of my government to tighten immigration procedures and practices; and, shortly, we will take to Parliament legislation aimed at monitoring deportees to this country and deporting convicted criminals from this country. </p>
<p>We intend, as well, to revisit The Magistrate&rsquo;s Code of Procedure Act and amend the existing legislation to ensure that fines are not a penalty-option in respect of violent crime, and that bail applications for violent crimes and the possession of offensive weapons will be returned to the High Court. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as important, we will move to implement the legislation that governs the vetting of security firms and their employees. </p>
<p>&ldquo;My government also recognises that illegal firearms are being used to commit various crimes across the country. Accordingly, in joint operations with the Antigua &amp; Barbuda Defence Force, the Police will resume the random stop-and-search of individuals and begin systematic searches of pockets within various communities for firearms and illegal drugs. In this regard, we will also be increasing our border controls by Immigration, Customs and the Coast Guard, which are the gatekeepers of this country. </p>
<p>&ldquo;These extraordinary times and crimes call for extraordinary measures. As a result, my government plans to install surveillance cameras in strategic locations, and is considering the introduction of wire-tapping legislation. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I am pleased to report to you, as well, that my government has made a formal request of Scotland Yard for its assistance in cracking the number of unsolved murders still on the books. </p>
<p>&ldquo;While some of these measures may inconvenience some citizens and residents, we believe that the majority of persons, those who long for justice not only to be done, but be seen to be done, will welcome these initiatives in the long-term interest of the nation of Antigua &amp; Barbuda. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Fellow Antiguans and Barbudans; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Residents and Friends of Antigua and Barbuda: </p>
<p>&ldquo;Despite the recent occurrences, Antigua and Barbuda has managed, so far, to maintain a relatively low crime rate despite the Caribbean&rsquo;s growing problem with crime and violence. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Visitors from all over the world came to our shores for Cricket World Cup and for the Stanford 20/20 Tournament and were able to enjoy the games and activities in relative peace and safety. The same could be said for Sailing Week. We must ensure that those who visit our shores for pleasure and sporting activities continue to enjoy themselves in a safe and secure environment, and we must thwart those who would disrupt that peace and security. </p>
<p>&ldquo;In a concerted effort to take back our country and recapture our sense of security, the United Evangelical Association, the Antigua Christian Council, the Independent Churches Association, the National Intercessory Network, and Women Against Rape will be conducting a National Day of Prayer and Fasting on Sunday, August 24, beginning at 6am. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I urge all citizens and residents of this country to join this national initiative as we seek the assistance of a higher power to aid our earthly efforts. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Fellow Antiguans and Barbudans; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Residents and Friends of Antigua and Barbuda: </p>
<p>&ldquo;In closing, once again, I express the sympathies of my family and the government and people of Antigua and Barbuda to those who have experienced, directly and indirectly, acts of crime and violence. At the same time, my prayers, and those of the nation, go out to the relatives and friends of Ken Watkins Jr; Rafique Harris; Dr Catherine and Ben Mullany; and other victims of violence within our twin islands. </p>
<p>&ldquo;As Chief Servant of this nation, I pledge my government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring that our nation remains a paradise. </p>
<p>&ldquo;May God bless each and every one of us. </p>
<p>&ldquo;May God bless Antigua and Barbuda.&rdquo; <br>

Aside the from the blame-whitey content, let&rsquo;s talk about the tedious and moronic repetition here for a moment, can we? </p>
<p>I count this Caribbean boob   &mdash;   er, I mean, this distinguished international dignity of noble African origins who has, um, endured and transcended unimaginable Eurocentric bigotry and, uh, centuries of white-supremacist slavery and whatnot   &mdash;   saying &#8220;Fellow Antiguans and Barbudans&#8221; or &#8220;Residents and Friends of Antigua and Barbuda&#8221; at least 10 times in one very short address; plus many other gratuitous reiterations and minor variations on the theme. (Your mileage may vary.) </p>
<p>How many times do YOU count? <br>

			<p>To be fair, a lot of the crime in the Caribbean now derives from criminals that have been pampered by stays in the UK and the US: both countries whose judicial systems have been so hamstrung by fears of charges of &#8220;racism&#8221; that they can not and will not give violent black felons the punishment they deserve.  When these fiends are released back to their home societies, they are very much worse as a result of such coddling and appeasement, and countries like Antigua suffer for it.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&ldquo;However, we need the help of not only every citizen and resident, but we need the help of our international partners.&#8221;</p>
<p>No amount of help from anybody will alter basic black behavior.  If, as you claim, your society wasn&rsquo;t too criminalized, then it&rsquo;s because blacks weren&rsquo;t tempted with anything of value to steal or murder for.</p>
<p>The problem isn&rsquo;t the convicted criminals who have returned home, it&rsquo;s the potential criminals you have in your midst. Where blacks are there is chaos, crime, and ungodly problems.</p>
<p>Blacks are the curse of the Western world, and no amount of reparations to whites can ever compensate for it.  The only way to obtain peace and tranquility is to rid a society of its blacks.  Although all aren&rsquo;t criminals, so many of them are the only practical solution is keep them out and deport the ones already there.</p>

<p>While at first glance it may appear that the Prime Minister is just pointing the finger at White nations for the failure of the &#8220;Blacks&#8221; to adjust to the norms of civilized behavior, on second glance he makes an excellent point.</p>
<p>The cowardly and corrupt legal/political systems of Anglo nations, for whatever reason, refuse to control &#8220;Black&#8221; behavior. Those &#8220;Blacks&#8221; migrating in from predominately &#8220;Black&#8221; nations such as those Caribbean nations learn &#8220;freedom&#8221; which is then expressed as typical &#8220;Black&#8221; behavior. </p>
<p>As the Prime minister declares of &#8220;returning&#8221; &#8220;Blacks:</p>
<p>&#8220;In ours, particularly, with its small population, these criminal deportees, with skills developed and nurtured in the US and UK, are impacting tremendously on our society.&#8221;</p>
<p>He is right. They adversely impact ours as well. </p>

			<p>It sounds like they have a &#8220;low crime rate&#8221; because they send all their criminals to the UK and America&hellip;and they have the nerve to get mad because we send them back home.</p>

			<p>Jamaica too has blamed their crime rate on England, blaming the deportation of Jamaican criminals from England on the massive crime in that country. The west should take note that their policies have this disasterous effect on these small countries that cannot afford the police to combat these criminals and spare them the invasions of these criminal. The problem could well be solved by hanging them.</p>

<p>Nice try but why should the US or the UK keep Antigua&rsquo;s criminals in THEIR countries???? They have every right to deport Anigua&rsquo;s criminals back to Antigua. Also, these people aren&rsquo;t criminals because their &#8220;skills were nurtured in the US or UK&#8221;, they are criminals because they CHOOSE to be and they&rsquo;d be criminals anywhere.</p>

			<p>I read the original article and the 73 comments which followed. Antigua sounded like a version of Detroit on a small Carribean Island. The police are getting nowhere in finding the murderers because as the chief of police put it &#8220;People here don&rsquo;t trust or want to talk to the police. People out there know who did this&#8221;. A white former Canadian Mountie and 3 other mounties were hired because the Antiguan &#8220;police&#8221; had been so incompetent and corrupt. One person suggested that prior to hiring real police, the police force was so corrupt they were major players in crime on the islands. The Antiguan prime minister is shedding crocodile tears because the islanders only source of income are the white idiots who pay incredible amounts of money for the privilege of visiting Detroit in the Carribean. There is rampant crime. There have been many  other tourists robbed, a very large amount of murders and recently 4 hotel &#8220;security guards&#8221; robbed the hotel they worked for.The number of crimes committed on an island with only 70,000 people is astronomical. But an astronomical crime rate is logical when stupid, careless, mainly white tourists carry large sums of money and valuables in immediate proximity to 70,000 people of color who believe robbing (and even murdering) whites is appropriate behavior.</p>

In many cases they are being sent to countries with which they have little or no connection, except for the fact that they were born here. Why don&rsquo;t their have jail cells waiting for these newly deported citizens?&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..<br>

			<p>So the Carribean nations have been using Britain and the U.S. as a sink for their criminals until most were reeking havoc in those nations.  Since those nations failed to deport them quick enough they are now part of those cultures and not the Carribean nations that bred them.</p>

			<p>Firstly, I cannot understand why any Briton would want to hoilday in such humid, pest infested places such as Antigua and Jamaica when there are wonderful places such as the Greek Islands, the Algarve, Cyprus, etc virtually on the &#8216;doorstep&rsquo; of Britain (with air travel)where the people are hospitable and glad for tourist income and crime is not an issue.<br>
  Secondly, what sort of twisted logic blames England for native born Antiguans committing crime on Antiguan soil under Antiguan juristiction?</p>

			<p>If the Antiguans were serious about controlling crime, they&rsquo;d import a bunch of Saudi officials and let them deal with it.  After a few public amputations and beheadings, things would be under control and the islands safe for tourists again.  Bottom line: crime flourishes only in societies that tolerate it.</p>

<p> What you say could be extended to the entire Caribbean at large. What a paradise this area of the world would have been if the European powers had just sent out their own citizenry as colonialists instead of developing slave-based plantation agriculture. Slavery was such an incredibly stupid and short-sighted policy.</p>

			<p>CUTIE BENJAMIN leader of the OPPOSITION in the Government of ANTIGUA &amp; BARBUDA - lawyer - honourable politician -<br>
the &#8220;honourable&#8221; lawyer ANTIGUA LABOUR PARTY politician endorsed a criminal deportee&rsquo;s passport &amp; photo swearing he knew the MURDERER and got paid handsomely in the process but this was a DECEIT &amp; FRAUD as the MURDERER was deported from UK to Jamaica - then deported to Antigua &amp; Barbuda and Cutie BENJAMIN did not know him from Adam - but Cutie BENJAMIN did want to know his very sweet money.    </p>
<p>Was it not the &#8220;honourable&#8221; Cutie BENJAMIN that blocked the legislation in Parliament to be strict on crimes of murder, violence &amp; rape? </p>
<p>I should know as I was raped as a result of that &#8220;honourable&#8221; Cutie BENJAMIN&rsquo;s soft approach on crime.</p>
<p>That &#8220;Honourable&#8221; Cutie BEJAMIN of the ALP should be strung up and hanged in public for allowing our paradise to descend to the pariah state of the world and it has now become a killer&rsquo;s paradise. </p>
<p>I have heard those who want to sort out that &#8220;honourable&#8221; BENJAMIN if he does not resign for his treachery.   <br>

			<p>Baldwin Spencer wants to have his cake and eat it.  Today he says that Antigua&rsquo;s problems were caused by the previous government:</p>
<p>&#8216;To ignore the endemic corruption, extortion and theft that flourished up to the change of government, would be to condemn this nation to repeat its past mistakes&hellip;. </p>
<p>Last week, a record $25.7 Million shipload of narcotics was intercepted and seized in Antigua and Barbuda waters. </p>
<p>This historic drug bust, coming in just the tenth week of the first UPP administration, is a definitive demonstration that there now exists a new order in this country. </p>
<p>The view is being widely voiced that if the cartel that ruled up to March 23rd was still in power, that $24.7 Million drug shipment would have been delivered to its destination according to plan. </p>
<p>It had long been common knowledge that senior officials in the Bird government were significant players in the international syndicate of major drug cartels&hellip;.&rsquo; </p>
