						<p>The Democratic Party votes on a national platform every 4 years and now Native Hawaiians are included.</p>
<p>The wording is a bit different from the plank adopted in 2000, but the emphasis on some form of native Hawaiian recognition by the federal government runs on the same track.</p>
<p>This year, Democrats said: &#8220;We support the efforts for self-determination and sovereignty of native Hawaiians, consistent with principles enumerated in the Apology Resolution and the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Although the native Hawaiian portion of the national party is only a few lines in a 75-page document, Hawaii delegates are cheering the inclusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;It lays out the connection very well,&#8221; said state Senate President Colleen Hanabusa, a delegate to the convention. &#8220;It refers to the apology resolution, which is an apology for an illegal overthrow, so it is a major recognition. It tells us all that it was Democrats who took this step for the state of Hawaii.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If he becomes president, Barack Obama is expected to sign the bill if it passes Congress.</p>
<p>In a statement released in January, Obama said he supports federal recognition for native Hawaiians because they are an important part of the local culture.</p>

			<p>If the native Hawaiians get their sovereignty, will Hawaii cease being a State, and will the Democrats pack up their things and leave?</p>

			<p>All of this makes me ill! I am sick and tired of it all. I am angry because I see my once beloved America acting like a DRUNK WHORE - Babylon and its not going to get any better. We truly are in the last days. </p>
<p>Furthermore, on November 23, 1993, President Clinton signed United States Public Law 103-150, which not only acknowledged the illegal actions committed by the United States in the overthrow of the legitimate government of Hawaii, but also that the Hawaiian people never surrendered their sovereignty. </p>
<p>The latter is the most important part of United States Public Law 103-150 for it makes it quite clear that the Hawaiian people never legally ceased to be a sovereign separate independent nation. There is no argument that can change that fact. </p>
<p>Need I say anymore? Why in the hell isn&rsquo;t someone anyone reporting this information? WHY!</p>

			<p>Great!  I&rsquo;m glad to hear it.  I expect Obama and Biden to also praise &#8220;self-determination and sovereignty&#8221; of native South Ossetians.  Otherwise, they are simply lying, pandering, hypocrites.</p>

Well good, as a white separatist will the Democrat party now recognize my self-determination rights and the self-determination rights of other white separatists to form our own country and live apart from a multicultural society that is increasingly becoming something ugly and unpleasant?</p>

			<p>If any of the regular readers get angry about this, then you are hypocrites. The right to self determination is one of the most basic American principles that White people have been robbed of since the Civil Rights Act. You should hope that this passes. It set a precedent to return to fundamental American ideals of local self rule. If White Americans are smart they will use this to their advantage. The end of forced integration and Federal control of local governments is what everyone should be fighting for.</p>

			<p>Hawaii is tax negative, presents no real security advantage,and native Hawaiians are dumber than a rock.  Further, we have the two Senators from Japan, nominally Hawaii, and that&rsquo;s pretty absurd.</p>
<p>Let them go.  We will be better off.</p>

<p>Well, I&rsquo;m all for that.  Get those racists out of our lives and take Peurto Rico with them.</p>
<p>And while they&rsquo;re at it I&rsquo;d certainly like to see the leftist geeks push to give blacks three states to live in, along with $50,000 each, and then show everybody how non-prejudiced they are by moving in with them.</p>

			<p>Yeah Yeah Yeah; but to me, it&rsquo;s FAR more important to end Puerto Rico&rsquo;s affiliation with the US that allows their Commonwealth citizens to come to the USA as citizens. The PR Nationalists have made their views known about how they feel about the US when they closed down our military training areas that were used to train for mock military sea invasions.</p>
<p>What purpose does PR serve the US NOW in any respect that is important to America?</p>
<p>Puerto Rico is nothing more than a giant welfare state that feeds off the stupid American taxpayer.</p>

			<p>I was always taught that Hawaiians got to vote whether or not to join the United States, and the majority voted yes?  Am I wrong here?  Give Hawaii its freedom, and pull out all the welfare that is sent there.  I am sure native Hawaiians take way more than the Federal Government brings in.</p>

			<p>This means that a situation like the mainland Indians have, where they are exempt from much state taxes and in turn get all kinds of Federal aid amounting to millions of tax dollars from the evil white man who &#8220;illegally&#8221; (?) overthrough Hawaii!  What would constitute &#8220;legal&#8221; overthrow?  If my history class was correct, they became a territory long before they &#8220;applied&#8221; for State hood.  And since every State in the &#8220;United States&#8221; is a sovereign and independant State, who is a member of a &#8220;union&#8221; (key word here) of other sovereign and independant States, whom were they &#8220;overthrown&#8221; by?  Being a member of the U.S. is for the general commerce and defense!  This is another prime example of the &#8220;DUMBING DOWN&#8221; of the general population and the worse part is that the stupid elected officials are perfect examples of the dumbed down people who live here!  The stupidity is beyond belief!!!!  If Obama is elected president, then the resulting outcome is exactly what this screwed up, dumbed down lost soul country deserves!</p>

			<p>We can see the subversive and traitorous dynamics of the &#8220;New World Order&#8221; at work, in the Democratic&rsquo;s official positions on issues of loyalty to the nation, so that they are no different from the so called &#8220;Republicans&#8221;(neocons),who have as their motto, &#8220;invade the world invite the world&#8221;. They are both in agreement on what will destroy the U.S.</p>

			<p>The Democrat party&rsquo;s hypocrisy further unmasked!  Note that they will never advocate sovereignty and self-determination for American whites; how will the Democrats come up with all the money they give away to ethnic bloc-voters without a captive nation of working white tax-slaves?</p>

			<p>Hawaii is a racist welfare state where local women undergo &#8220;free&#8221; publicly funded fertility treatments to stay on welfare when their other kids hit age 18. I am tired of paying taxes to support Hawaiians, Puerto Ricans, etc.  Bring back the lower 48 USA.  Alaska is negotiable.</p>

			<p>my guess is that truth be known they would run for Uncle Sam&rsquo;s apron strings should China, Russia or Japan ever come knocking. Most native Hawaiians are not black but they are not white either a dark colored Asian mix. Most do OK under an American system even though they pretend to hate us. </p>
<p>They are so much better off in the real world under our rule if Japan had had their way they would have been exterminated as a race by 1950. </p>

			<p>Dems will do anything to weaken the Sovereign state of the United States of America.<br>
The creation of the sovereign Indian states was a disaster for the Indians and the USA. The lesson should have been learned, but it wasn&rsquo;t. Dems and other marxists want to divide, to create separate warring groups. </p>

			<p>You guys, Hawaii isn&rsquo;t seceding.  If this bill passes, all it means is that Hawaii will divide into &#8220;Native Hawaiian&#8221; and &#8220;American&#8221; areas, similar to the status of states that have Indian reservations on them.  The Native Hawaiians living on their reservations will be able to make their own laws and be exempt from some federal and state taxes.  However they will still retain all the rights of all other American citizens.  </p>

<p>I am from Canada, so I am not sure if I am right on this&hellip;.doesn&rsquo;t someone running for US President have to be US born???? W<br>
ouldn&rsquo;t the above make Obama&rsquo;s candidacy null and void?? Am I the only one that sees the irony in this??? <br>

<p>Or to put it another way, they will be another group in the U.S. that will get to &#8220;have their cake and eat it to.&#8221; One example would be the Indians that own gaming businesses in California. I read a while back that some of the gaming houses owned by them have told employees who complained about the lack of medical insurance, that they should go to the State. Hmm. Kind of like the kid who tells his parents he&rsquo;s running away, but can he borrow twenty bucks. Or as some of the more rough posters on this forum would say, &#8220;just can&rsquo;t do it alone without the man.&#8221;</p>
