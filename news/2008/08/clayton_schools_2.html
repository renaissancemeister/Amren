<h1>Clayton Schools Lose Accreditation; Board Members Ousted</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Megan Matteucci, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, August 28, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Clayton County schools are the first in the nation in the past 40 years to lose accreditation, failing to meet eight of nine improvement mandates.</p>
<p>The action by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools came a few hours prior to Gov. Sonny Perdue&rsquo;s announcement that he was immediately removing four school board members found to have flouted the law. A state administrative judge had recommended their removal.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>By Thursday afternoon, parents flooded school offices to withdraw their children. Two thousand students have already fled the district this school year and the number is expected to grow.</p>
<p>Thompson said he was disappointed that families were not willing to give the district another chance.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>School officials can regain accreditation if they show before Sept. 1, 2009, that have met all the mandates. If successful, accreditation would be restored and would be retroactive to Sept. 1, 2008. If they aren&rsquo;t successful, the school system would have to start the accreditation process from the beginning, which likely would take about three years.</p>
<p>That means that if Clayton meets the mandates by May, this year&rsquo;s seniors could graduate with an accredited diploma.</p>
<p>A loss of accreditation means the 50,000 Clayton students could have trouble getting into some colleges and universities, or receiving scholarship money. High school juniors and seniors will be able to maintain Hope scholarship eligibility because of legislation signed earlier this year by Gov. Sonny Perdue.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Thursday, Perdue heeded the recommendation by Judge Michael Malihi, of the Office of State Administrative Hearings, and issued an executive order removing board members Michelle Strong, Louise Baines-Hunter, Yolanda Everett and Sandra Scott.</p>
<p>The move means there will be special elections in November seeking someone to serve the remainder of Scott&rsquo;s and Strong&rsquo;s terms, both of which end Dec. 31, 2010.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

			<p>There is a critical shortage of white students. There are not enough to spread around in order to teach African students how to &#8220;learn&#8221;, or at least sit still like the white children. </p>
<p>As America turns into Brazil, the hopes and dreams of every African child to sit next to a real white child, and learn how to walk, dress, sit, raise their hands, etc, will vanish. There simply is not enough of us whites to take on this burden to carry the Africans. We whites have done so much, so much, for the Africans. I am sad to say they may have to raise their own children.</p>

			<p>In the Autobiography of Malcolm X, Malcolm is quoted as saying, &#8220;My homemade education gave me, with every additional book that I read, a little bit more sensitivity to the deafness, dumbness and blindness that was afflicting the Black race in America.&#8221;  Now when Malcolm states the obvious truth, he is lauded as a defender and open-minded seeker-of-truth, and everywhere I go in the six districts I work in, I see his autobiography or exerpts of it in certain collections of autobiographical works.  <br>
When I come into American Renaissance I see the same observation of Black dumbness by those who have peeled away years of indoctrination to not state the obvious, my White brothers and Sisters are deemed &#8220;ignorant&#8221; by our detractors.  Which is it, Leftist morons?  Was Malcolm a great Black leader when He saw &#8220;Black dumbness&#8221;, and If Whites at Amren agree with Malcolm&rsquo;s post-literate realization, does that make us &#8220;Ignorant&#8221; and &#8220;Racist&#8221;?  Why give allowances to Malcolm and not give Whites the benefit of the doubt?<br>
Self-hating Whites are as dumb in reality as those they defend&hellip;&hellip; in the arena of empiricism/observation or as I like to put in, the lab of real life&hellip;.</p>

			<p>Similar problem in South Africa with school districts where majority is black pupils failure rate extremely high Where districts are very much white pass rate are much better and higher University entrances gained. Black youth still very militant and angry yet majority rules (black population) but no middle road on the cards.</p>

			<p>THe real yet saddest part of this is, instead of whites boosting blacks, the opposite is the fact. Case in point when did you ever see blacks wanting to dress and act like whites? Is it thought to be cool to emulate black or white behavior? When you toss them together neither benefits, bad behavior trumps good. If America had an official dress, it would be,tattoos, crooked hats, baggy prison pants, and body mutilations. When classrooms are full of rude obnoxious rowdy wannabe drop outs no one can learn much.</p>

			<p>The whole issue is something a good deal more sinister.  It&rsquo;s a land grab, that&rsquo;s all.  Something very valuable is happening in Clayton county involving an industrial client.  If Clayton can secure the initiaal parcel of property by 2013, they will be in the money with development till 2023.  So they HAAD to find a way to drop the prices and marketability of as much county land as was humanly possible.  </p>
<p>They arrived at a unique solution; torpedo the schools.  Then not only will people pack up and leave, they won&rsquo;t be able to give their houses away (unless it becomes a retirement community) since the school ssuck so bad.  Nobody with a family will be moving to Clayton (unless they missed ALL the news).</p>

			<p>Grob Hahn may be on to something. After <i>de jure</i> segregation ended in the 1950s, several real-estate agents engaged in &#8220;blockbusting.&#8221; They would have a black family move into a neighborhood, knowing full well that the majority of white residents would immediately move out. Even though that depressed sale prices, the agents made up for it on volume. (Dishonest stockbrokers do the same thing when they &#8220;churn&#8221; clients&rsquo; accounts to generate extra commissions.) Then the agents made another killing   &mdash;   along with the developers   &mdash;   when the displaced whites bought new suburban homes.</p>

			<p>There is no mystery about what happened in Clayton County.  I worked there for 8 years but I lived two counties away.  Any white family that cared about their children would not send them to school in Clayton.  Clayton County got steam rollered by Atlanta like many other formerly rural counties swallowed up by the metro area. In about ten years the county was demographically completely changed with the white majority being replaced with a black urban majority.  In addition to the blacks the county now has a rather large hispanic and asian population.</p>
<p>Once they achieved majority status the blacks took almost complete control of the school system and most middle class whites fled the county for greener pastures. Although there has been some criminal cases involving misuse of funds in the school system, I don&rsquo;t believe the educational administrators are much worse than any other &#8220;urban&#8221; school system.  The real problem is the only way to improve their test scores would be to attract a better class of students.  Once white students and their families are pushed out by black crime, drugs, classroom misbehavior and antagonistic culture the collapse of a counties academic scores is unstoppable.  The sad fact is you could spend a million dollars per student and you would not be able to significantly move Clayton counties scores.  If you here of some improvement it will only mean that they have either watered down the standards again or they have figured out new ways to cheat the system.</p>

			<p>The only way to &#8220;improve&#8221; black people is to assign each and every one of them a personal &#8220;minder&#8221; the day they are born. This person minder will then poke, prod and pull the child through school and getting settled into a AA job, then proceed to DO the job for the black person all his/her life. The salary of the person minders could be paid for by the &#8216;gubmint&rsquo; thus reducing the white unemployment by nearly 100% given the black rate of reproduction&hellip; </p>

<p>The St. Louis Post-Dispatch has already editorialized that this should be done for blacks from kindergarten through college, that they should have an individual tutor that stays with them during that period of time.</p>

			<p>Public schools in areas which have a large black population are a waste of taxpayer money &amp; young white minds. These schools have to lower their minimum test standards as to keep moving many black students through the system. After all these school don&rsquo;t want 25 year old students still in jr. high.</p>
