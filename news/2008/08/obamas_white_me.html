						<p>Some white folk are causing Barack Obama some very big Black problems!</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama has spent enough time in Chicago Black neighborhoods to know that Black people oftentimes get their news and information in a totally different way than white people do.</p>
<p>If he and his white media advisors don&rsquo;t know, we get our most reliable history, news and information from each other!</p>
<p>Rudimentary research by the Obama campaign would have shown that in order for Blacks to truthfully inform each other we had to plead our own cause.</p>
<p>Black media companies became necessary because the white press would not cover events in the Black community They would not report on Black athletes and Black sports teams, would not respect Black opinions and related editorial views, they would not respectfully write about Black deaths and obituaries, they would not run Black cartoons and illustrations and the white press for hundreds of years, and some say as late as 2008, has little or no respect for Black media and Black journalist professionalism.</p>
<p>OK, OK, what is the issue? You have to know it is economic. No disrespect intended but it seems some people are trying to pimp Obama.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know my friends that love the Black Presidential candidate unequivocally don&rsquo;t like for me to write like this but its true!</p>
<p>Can I prove it? Yes!</p>
<p>What do you call it if someone sends you out on the highways and byways and tells you to bring them all of the money you can so they can pay themselves and do whatever else they want to do? Sounds like pimping to me.</p>
<p>More Black people have contributed money to the Barack Obama Presidential Campaign than to any presidential effort in history. Black people just want to get some of that money back in the form of patronizing Black community businesses, advertising with Black-owned media outlets and the hiring and utilization of Black political professionals. Barack Obama knows that better than David Axelrod and the other whites he has desired to trust his campaign with.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Is it wrong for a Black candidate for President to desire to &ldquo;take care&rdquo; of his people too?</p>
<p>White media companies say they refuse to spend with the Black media because Black newspapers, magazines and Black-owned broadcast stations have no numbers. They say the papers don&rsquo;t have certified circulation figures and the broadcast stations have no rating service numbers.</p>
<p>Well, I say the Black press cannot be accurately judged or evaluated by using white measuring sticks or performance models. You cannot judge Europe, Asia or Africa by using American standards so why would you expect what goes on in the hood by suburbian standards?</p>
<p>If the powerful U.S. Census can&rsquo;t count all of the Black people in the United States, how in the hell can Arbittron or Nielsen count all of the people that are influenced by Black-owned media. If the highly regarded U.S. Marshals can&rsquo;t count the attendees at the Million Man March, how can they count how many hands and households a single Black newspaper goes through?</p>
<p>This issue of Black media utilization is not going to stop Blacks from voting for one of their own but it is going to make Black people and Black voters angry.</p>

			<p>Lol&hellip;.of course Obama is not relying on &#8220;black owned media&#8221;.  Like all black owned businesses, these media outlets are incompetant and unreliable.  Obama wants to WIN his party&rsquo;s nomination (something that is definitely not decided yet) and win the election.  Hiring blacks to be more than tokens to be displayed for the black community, would be a sure way to guarentee failure.</p>
<p>Hahaha&hellip;.but wouldn&rsquo;t it be hilarious if criticism made him rely on these resources only to have his Presidential aspirations killed by them?</p>

			<p>Luctus Gantt must be living in a different world than I.  All I see these days on tv are tributes to blacks and panderings and ethnic cheeleading. It&rsquo;s sickening to me. The biggest reason the cencus bureau can&rsquo;t get an accurate count of blacks is painfully obvious&hellip;.the cencus takers are too afraid to go into the infested ghettos because they might not return. So they estimate.  I thought this &#8220;reporter&#8221; was supposed to show some objectivity.  <br>

			<p>What the? What is the point of this article? Oh, he is &#8220;improvisin&rsquo;&#8221; I guess.</p>
<p>The question should be: Why does Obama have so few BLACKS on his staff if he is so pro-afro? We could ask the same of Oprah. &#8220;Oh&#8221; my very few blacks on her staff! And what of affirmative action for these 2 &#8220;Black Elites&#8221;?  Where is de Blacks, Obama? Where is dey, Oprah? Where oh where is Jesse demandin they be put in charge of sumptin&rsquo;? Hmmmmmm? </p>
<p>Diversity for the chumps,it is a sham for all the sham lawyers to milk off of. But not if you wants to win office or keep you money, it appears.</p>
<p>Yea, you would think this might make an article or 2. Maybe Buchanan will bring it up?</p>

			<p>Obama is half white. He is probably more intelligent than 95% of whites and 99.99% of black Americans.  Since he is perceived as black in politics, his election would diminish many of the arguments black apologists for  use about racism as the root of all ills for black America.   His election would be a blow to pro-affirmative action arguments.  It would make Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton even more irrelevant. Whether or not you like to believe it, President Obama will likely be positive for race realists in the long term. </p>
<p>Unlike McCain and Bush, Obama also has stated he wants to aggressively and more fully wage war against Al Quaida in Afghanistan,  and even in Pakistani border lands if necessary, which is what Bush should have been doing all along instead of getting us mired down in Iraq.  </p>
<p>I think AmRen should re-evaluate their position on this guy. While his election might be a tough bill to swallow for some MN&rsquo;s, it might be just the thing America  needs.</p>

<p>Yes, from barbershops, telephone clairvoyants, the random impressionistic rants of other blacks and &#8220;afro-centric&#8221; clowns like Jeremiah Wright. </p>
<p>&#8220;If he and his white media advisors don&rsquo;t know, we get our most reliable history, news and information from each other!&#8221;</p>
<p>Like I said. B. Hussein Obama would have to be crazy to trust anything whatsoever to black media. They would only make him look like, well, what he is, and what are black poseurs like Lucius Gantt going to do in protest, anyway? Vote for Whitey?</p>

<p>Of course we know where blacks get their news  &mdash;  -through wild rumors and conspiracy theories.  LMAO!  Is this satire?</p>
<p>On a more serious note, the following is an example of why a Barack presidency would cause more problems that it would &#8216;fix&rsquo;.<br>
&#8220;Is it wrong for a Black candidate for President to desire to &ldquo;take care&rdquo; of his people too?&#8221;<br>
Blacks always look out for #1 and the hell with everyone else.  Due to their lack of foresight, they wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to kill the golden goose.<br>

<p>I went to the website of the original article and in the comment section, asked why capital B&rsquo;s on the word black and lower case w&rsquo;s on the word white. After sending my comments and waiting, I tried to see if my comments were posted.

			<p>I could give less than a rat&rsquo;s rump what blacks think about anything. However in this case I think that Obama does need to hire more blacks on his staff. This would give him a better chance of loosing this election which is an idea I support wholeheartedly. Obama knows that having a large number of blacks working on his campaign is a recipe for disaster. There would be so much infighting amongst themselves that his campaign would simply fall apart.</p>

This example of the black writing style is the result of the black learning style. Rambling and nearly incoherent.</p>
<p>As for the capital B for black, lower case W for white, I appreciate his honesty in presenting his position on the matter of black and White.</p>

<p>Yes, there is no more a reliable source of knowledge then the old grapevine! Who needs books and news papers! The government&rsquo;s AIDS plot to wipe out blacks, the Katrina levee destruction, the Ancient Egyptian space program, all valuable pieces of Black knowledge learned through the most reliable news source  &mdash;  Word of mouth!</p>
<p>If you are wondering why I am putting an exclamation point after every sentence it is because that I am writing in Black! It is like English but more exciting! You use see you use exclamation points everywhere! And Black is capitalized! It is so much fun!</p>

<p>I am refering to Obama&rsquo;s Aides, such as Mr. Axelrod, and his other advisors. There is clearly a strong Jewish presence in his Campaign Staff and I think that if asked they would identify as Jewish. Not as White. I think it&rsquo;s worth pointing out and, as I said, I&rsquo;d be interested to hear what everyone thinks about it.</p>

Oh, Yeah&hellip;Barack Obama is no fool, he wants to win so he hires people that can help him get the job done.  You know, &#8220;competent types.&#8221; But I&rsquo;ll say no more.

			<p>&#8220;To be CORRECT in hiring No More than 13.5% of his staff should be blacks as per US Census Records over that is favoritism isn&rsquo;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a fallacy brought on by an incomplete examination of census records. The average age of whites in America is around 40 years of age. The average age of african americans is around 22. If we simply take the average age of those hired by Obama&rsquo;s campaign, his staff should be more like 9 or 10% african american, to look more like the rest of America. We can leave the exact figures to the multiculturalists.</p>
<p>lol  it&rsquo;s been awhile since this kind of thing has been called &#8216;favoritism&rsquo;. </p>

			<p>Regarding Mal Evans posting on David Axelrod, I wasn&rsquo;t aware that Mr. Axelrod was Jewish.  Sadly, it doesn&rsquo;t surprise me. Our rather bizarre attraction to the left continues to baffle this Jew.  But to be fair, we are far from monolithic.  Many of the most outspoken and articulate conservatives and defenders of race realism are Jewish. Any Jew (or white) who would consider voting for Barack Husein Obama should have his head examined.</p>

			<p>I agree Obama is not one of them. Because multiculturalism is just a poisonous ideology of anti-white racism, most Americans are ignorant about the true differences in groups of peoples and cultures. I think Obama should not be referred to as black or African-American. He is half white and half Kenyan. His ethnicity is crystal clear unlike black Americans where it is just a hazy guess of somewhere in West Africa.</p>

<p>   I think we could also find important Jewish advisors (i.e. Lieberman) on the McCain staff. The Jews, who traditionally vote more democratic, are more divided over Senator Obama than any Democratic presidential candidate in recent memory. I believe that most Jews (and everyone else for that matter) will be very disappointed in an Obama presidency.  </p>

			<p>Traditionally, Democrats don&rsquo;t need to advertise or campaign for the black vote.  A couple months before the election they just hand out bribes to the black preachers.  A month before the election they hand out &#8220;get out the vote&#8221; money to the likes of Jack$$$ and $harpton.</p>
<p>You get what you pay for.  The black vote is essentially purchased from the black churches and elites by the Democrats.</p>
<p>I once worked for the State Democratic Committee of Ohio and I can tell you, that is exactly how it is done.</p>

<i>LOL. Shame on Obama. He should start the &ldquo;affirmative action&rdquo; at home and hire an entirely black staff. That should do wonders for his campaign.</i></p>
<p>Yeah, and what I wonder is, if Obama gets elected, what percentage of his staff, cabinet, etc. will be black? If it&rsquo;s mostly black, can it not be interpreted as nothing more than a racial head count? If it&rsquo;s mostly white, will this not be a tacit admission that its hard to find many competent blacks in Washington, or anywhere else for that matter? In either case, it will not look good. Of course, the MSM will do its best to portray the dilemma as proof of a racist white society. In reality, it will highlight the fact that a black president in a majority white nation is a horribly bad idea.</p>

			<p>I knew this &#8220;journalist&#8221; in graduate school. As a student at Florida State University, Lucius Gantt couldn&rsquo;t open his mouth without uttering preposterous racial pronouncements, and using stylized victimization jargon all the way back in the 1970s.  He was later a gadfly reporter in Tallahassee, always publishing mildly paranoid racial editorials in fringe black newspapers with low circulations. I see he is still at it, but operatingout of a bigger market in Orlando. He is a no-count voice of opinion who should not be taken too seriously. On the other hand, he is typical of many black writers who consider themselves insightful analysts &#8220;from the black perspective&#8221; where news, as indicated by Mr Gantt, is generated from from street talk from each other. The facts don&rsquo;t matter much in this context, and news tends to drive the racial paranoia and anti-white sentiment among black &#8220;elites&#8221; who actually read and trust these little pulp fiction racial rags.</p>

			<p>Unfortunately for Lucius&rsquo;s grand strategy, I suspect that the 1 out of 20 Black voters who is voting for McCain is not watching BET or reading Ebony.  For Obama to successfully recruit the Blacks who are still not voting for him, he would probably be best off gathering them all up into his SUV and asking them in person to stop being journalists, reporters, and pundits for the neocon media machine.</p>

			<p> RaceandCountry,  just to clarify:  nearly every estimate of Barack Obama&rsquo;s IQ starts at 130 and goes up from there, with some estimating 148 or higher based on  academic history at Harvard. An IQ of 125 would put him above 95% of Americans.  Whether you like his politics or not, it is hard to doubt his high intelligence. It is also hard to doubt that he is substantially more intelligent than John McCain. While I respect McCain, I don&rsquo;t think he is very bright when it comes to economics, foreign policy, or technology issues.</p>

			<p>Obama&rsquo;s white staffers remind me of all the white technicians and artists who are responsible for the music of black artists like Mariah Carey and Will Smith.</p>

			<p>the white press&hellip; has little or no respect for Black media and Black journalist professionalism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just as the black media and black organizations have no respect for white people?  I hate this about blacks-they have their own assocations, then they whine about whites &#8220;discriminating&#8221; against them&hellip;.AND THEN force us to let them into OUR neighborhoods, banks, schools, corporations, etc.  </p>

			<p>steve conservative jew:</p>
<p>I have always been anazed of how the Jewish people have followed those bent on their destruction.</p>
<p>B.Obama hussein is a muslem/cult-Christian, at best.<br>
His pastor, and his buds at NOI HATE Jews yet, they flock to him and worship at his feet.<br>
Jews are/were the biggest organizers, and supporters of communism which promptly murdered millions of them, yet they still push it through liberalism.<br>
The Jews, other than Isrealies, also worship at the feet of islam the horrid cult that would murder them to the last person.<br>
Can you explain this phenomenon?<br>
Im puzzled!</p>

<p>Perhaps, perhaps not. A quick search on the internet provided a lot of speculation about Obama&rsquo;s IQ, but little hard data, except that his IQ tested in the 150&rsquo;s to 160&rsquo;s in two separate tests as a youngster. But given our history of Affirmative Action in this country, every black achievement is suspect without verifiable data.<br>
Just look at Michelle&rsquo;s thesis. And his own Presidential candidacy.</p>

<p>Thanks for the laugh.</p>
