						<p>Poland&rsquo;s population will likely shrink by two million by 2035, but the country will have twice as many foreigners, reported the daily Dziennik on Monday.</p>
<p>A report from the Central Statistical Office forecasts that Poland will become a more multi-cultural country owing to the influx of migrants from the former Soviet Union, Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>The report details a number of reasons: Only 38 per cent of women will be of age for childbirth, the daily says, compared to 50 per cent today. Polish women also will not think of starting a family until their 30s.</p>
<p>There will be some four million more senior citizens and life expectancy is expected to rise by six years for men and three years for women.</p>
<p>Fewer Poles will also leave the country in search of work, the report predicts, as they are expected to have better opportunities and an improved quality of life in Poland.<br>

			<p>What business do Asians or Africans have being in Poland?</p>

			<p>This infuriates me, because Poland had once been  &mdash;   along with its Central European neighbors  &mdash;   one of the more staunchly White countries in the West, certainly in comparison to disaster zones like the UK or Australia, which import millions of Africans and South Asians even as their own native White populations collapse.  Poland was different  &mdash;   along with Austria and Germany, after all, the Poles were in the vanguard fighting off invasions by Mongols and Turks on multiple occasions since the Middle Ages.  So the Poles needed no convincing about the importance of retaining a strong White population base.  </p>
<p>But things have changed disastrously for the worse in Poland, since the country came under the cultural sway of the USA and UK after the 1990&rsquo;s  &mdash;   with these countries&rsquo; suicidal embrace of mass immigration and multiculturalism.  The decline in Poland&rsquo;s birthrate, while very significant, is not in itself a threat  &mdash;   Western nations throughout history have seen birth rate declines, but without mass immigration causing population replacement, the decline reverses itself after a generation as pro-Natalist values take over, and the population stabilizes.  It only becomes dangerous when a country listens to idiot economists who sell the snake oil of mass Third World immigration &#8220;solving&#8221; a country&rsquo;s labor-shortage problems, and fling open their doors, as Britain, Canada, Australia and the USA have done.  And Poland&rsquo;s foolish leaders have now decided on the same path.</p>
<p>I still have some hope for Poland due to its history of fighting off Turks and Mongols, and also because the Central European, Alpine-Carpathian corridor has been much more resistant to mass immigration and demographic displacement than post-imperial Western countries like the UK, France, Australia and the USA.  Places like Austria and Germany have among the toughest immigration laws anywhere in the West now, explicitly favoring White co-ethnics abroad with some Germanic heritage and expelling Turks and others without a connection to the country, learning German, let alone making an economic contribution.  (This is why places like Denmark, Austria and Germany have become so popular as immigration destinations among Whites with a Nordic background, from countries such as Australia, Canada, the USA and UK that are being overrun these days.)  Poland also shares much of this culture, and similar reluctance to stupidly fling its doors open.  But Poland must work hard to resist the pressure from the British and American diversity-pushers who want to dilute out the country&rsquo;s base population.  The country must remain intact!</p>

<p>I truly get more and more depressed each day as to what has happened to White females over the past 40 years. There&rsquo;s absolutely no pride left in them at all. They have become completely brainwashed and totally self-absorbed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simply not natural for a female to NOT want kids and a family. If it were, we simply wouldn&rsquo;t have existed as a race as long as we have. We&rsquo;d have been extinct a long time ago.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done some research on &#8220;the pill&#8221; and it looks like it contains some chemical that negates and stifles the power of creativity, in all forms. I guess this also applies to the desire to &#8220;pro-create&#8221; as well. It would also explain why those that can&rsquo;t afford it (black and hispanic women) are having kids left and right.</p>
<p>I was hoping the plague of feminism would never reach the former Eastern-block countries that were once a sanctuary from this disease. It looks like another Blitzkreig of Poland, only this time it&rsquo;s Feminazis instead of German Nazis. Sigh.</p>

			<p>I was in Poland 3 times between 2002 -2005.  Living in London at the time it was a relief to visit an all white country, although I saw the beginnings of immigration: a few blacks in the centre of Krakow hissing at the women. It&rsquo;s going to be heart-rending to see another great white country destroyed by third-world invaders.  I can&rsquo;t bear to think about it.  With two new Muslim countries and the white East turning brown, a great cloud of depression is decending over Europe.</p>

			<p>This whole situation with respect to Poland stands out like a long range conspiracy.<br>
Poland is conditioned by the same Hollywood, news media, drug, and multicultural doctrines as America and most of western Europe.<br>
Can it be that high functioning nations are being conditioned to drown into multiculturalism, ignorance, and poverty, so that the few privleged can win a new kind of control beyond money?</p>

<p>The number of new Vietnamese migrant workers to the Czech Republic has risen 37-fold in the past two years, according to the newspaper. But Czech companies seem keen to snap up the cheap, if less-qualified workers. And they plan to employ more than 45,000 Vietnamese workers by 2009, according to the newspaper. But, without Czechs even realizing it, the Vietnamese (and others) migrant issue classifies our country as a developed one (which we like to hear). All Central European countries face the same problem: the notion of &ldquo;us&rdquo; and our homeland is very deeply rooted. It basically means that those who are white and speak correct Czech are allowed to live here.</p>

<b>Poland to open its first-ever baby store selling human babies at 22,000 dollars</b></p>
<p>The opening of the center for surrogate mothers in Poland has sparked controversy. The Catholic Church stands strong against the initiative, although many Polish citizens support the opening of the first-ever center in the country. The center has already released the price list for its services and even obtained its first clients, the Noviye Izvestia newspaper reports.</p>
<p>Thirty-seven women have already addressed to the center offering their healthy bodies to help those who cannot enjoy the happiness of biological parenthood. Specialists of the center pay first priority to addresses of surrogate mothers and infertile couples so that a surrogate mother would not come across her child in the streets afterwards.</p>
<p>The price list of the center says that the price of child-bearing will fluctuate between 15,000 and 22,500 US dollars. The list also says that the prices of happy parenthood are negotiable.</p>
<p>etc</p>

			<p>This is just plain crazy.<br>
The fact is that the UK is simply inundated with Poles of the fertile age.<br>
Why can&rsquo;t they return home and do their patriotic duty?<br>
Incidentally, I&rsquo;m sure many of those Poles, with first hand experience of living in the third-world multi-racial Hel-hole of London, can attest to what an utter, utter failure and disaster massive non-White immigration is.</p>

<p>This is where Jarod Taylor and the globalists agree. Diversity is actually dangerous. Their true goal is to create one unified race, thereby eliminating diversity. Every single action taken reduces diversity. Not just of opinion, ideology, culture, economics, but of race. </p>

			<p>I know it sounds crazy but you could argue that eastern Europe was better off under the Iron Curtain because non-Whites from the third world couldn&rsquo;t go there. Thus with secure borders the White homogeneity of the rgion was secure, in contrast to say, &#8220;free&#8221; open-doors Great Britain for example. Certainly not the communists intention but sometimes the laws of unintended consequences can work to your advantage. Just a thought.</p>

			<p> There starting up the &#8220;we have a labor shortage&#8221; mantra. &#8220;We need immigrant labor&#8221;. These are buzz words for let&rsquo;s destroy a white christian nation by flooding it with uncivilized non-white third worlders. It&rsquo;s happening in Russia, too. Not only in Poland. These one-worlders won&rsquo;t rest until every white country on earth is destroyed. BTW, cant these people see what effect this is having on other countries? I know, the media keeps them in the dark.</p>

I think it is important multiracial U.S.A falls fast as many foolishly think if the world&rsquo;s most powerful nation is so diverse, it may not be bad after all. Besides many Eastern European and many East Asian teens look up to the west for what is cool. If diversity is cool in the West, it must be cool there too. That is why I repeat, multicultural America must fall. White nationalists should create a counter culture immune to Hollywood propaganda in the same way Islam is immune to their rubbish. The moment you see young people of a Euro nation living a modern &#8216;western&rsquo; lifestyle, half the battle is lost.</p>

<p>There is a presence of race-realists and nationalists on this site, but also a distressing number of hard-line Marxists who are hell-bent on denying the reality of multiculturalism and mass immigration. They need to be fought at every turn.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..<br>
It&rsquo;s a great irony   &mdash;    and a colossal piece of hypocrisy as well   &mdash;   that those fanatical worshippers of Diversity are in fact enemies of the very diversity which they the profess to adore.   All of their actions (whether intentionally or not) are directed toward eliminating all forms of human diversity and ultimately making everyone the same. How can they be so blind to this?</p>
<p>More attention needs to be given to this topic.</p>
<p>I am, in fact, an admirer of diversity.  I fully respect it. That is why I favor reasonable separation of breeds and cultures   &mdash;    in order to preserve them, not destroy them.</p>
<p>If we were raising poultry or sheep, there would be no question about the wisdom of this. When it comes to humans, why can we not see the same?</p>
<p>[Note that I distinguish between diversity the scientific fact, and Diversity the cultish new religion.]</p>

			<p>Here may be the reason why (from Wikipedia):</p>
<p>&#8220;The Women&rsquo;s Party (, PK) is a Polish political party which aims to represent the interests and concerns of women. <b>It was registered on 11 January 2007</b> and is led by the well-known author Manuela Gretkowska.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, it does look like creeping Feminazis have infiltrated Poland. Pretty soon, they can start expecting the women to stop going to church, start &#8220;adorning&#8221; themselves with tatoos, act like drunken *****, and exchange having a family with pursuing a &#8220;career&#8221;. Ahhh, the wonders of contemporary Western Civilization! Is it no wonder that some Muslim and other traditional countries fight becoming &#8220;Westernized&#8221;?</p>

			<p>From the first time I heard the word Feminazis, I was bothered by it. It just seems to emphasize the cowardliness of the white male dominated society that allowed it in the first place. I mean, Nazis are supposed to evoke and image of strong and terrifying power. It makes me picture white males down in a cowardly position covering their faces with their arms like a kid being attacked by the school bully. Sorry if this offends, it&rsquo;s just that I tend to think in vivid images.</p>

			<p>Jasper I think&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s just a matter of when this country falls, not if it will.  The only thing holding us together is the White (European) majority.  We&rsquo;re down to 61% now and we&rsquo;ll be a minority in 25 years.  If things stay on the course they&rsquo;re on now, then your right, multicultural America does need to be destroyed.  </p>

			<p>If this were really a question of labor shortages or low birth rates, they&rsquo;re are plenty of European diaspora in the Southern Hemisphere without the need of importing Africans or Asians.  Argentina could supply Italy with Italian immigrants for decades. There&rsquo;s a wealth of Spanish in South America and the Portuguese have no need of bringing Angolans into the country when there are more Portuguese in Brazil than in Portugal.  </p>

			<p>  With the examples of ethnic/racial conflict so apparent in France and formerly Great Britain, Poland would be stupid to follow the same road to misery and decline. I blame the Hollywood, Multicultural, neo-Marxist, one-world privileged elite for pushing poor Poland in this destructive direction. I&rsquo;m sure the average Pole is totally against it. </p>

			<p>My personal experience is that women all over Northern Europe don&rsquo;t think of starting families until their 30s.  The problem is that they want to &#8220;party&#8221; until then.  increasing numbers of them have rendered themselves infertile by then due to their earlier sexual adventures.</p>

What makes you think that after a generation fertility rates return to replacement level? The White TFR in the U.S.A. has hovered around 1.8 since about 1975.<br>
