				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Yoav Gonen, New York Post, August 20, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A controversial initiative that pays high-school students for passing Advanced Placement tests has failed to spur more kids to make the grade.</p>
<p>Students at 25 low-income city public schools and six parochial schools were offered private money on a sliding scale &mdash; from $500 to $1,000 &mdash; if they passed their five-point AP subject tests by scoring between 3 and 5.</p>
<p>The new program, largely targeting black and Hispanic students, was meant to prepare more kids for college and give them a financial boost to get there.</p>
<p>Despite the dangle of dollars, the number of students passing their AP tests in the 31 schools actually dipped to 1,476 this year &mdash; down five from 2007, when no cash was on the table, according to data released yesterday by the Council of Urban Professionals, which distributes the money.</p>
<p>The passing rate fell from 35 percent in 2007 to 32 percent this year in a result that surprised even those who have been skeptical of cash-for-kids programs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Those behind the privately funded initiative said they saw many positive results on which to build, including an 8 percent increase in the number of AP tests taken and a 19 percent increase in students scoring at the top point level.</p>
<p>Passing rates at nine of the 31 schools increased by more than 50 percent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>More than 1,100 students are collecting nearly $1 million for their work.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t care if it is privately funded, it sounds a little racist doesn&rsquo;t it? how many white and asian students have been paid to pass classes? </p>

			<p>so there has been some successes in the program? so does that mean that they were just lazy? how do you cure lazy? will you have to give them incentives over and above everyone else forever? kind of a dangerous preceedent</p>

			<p>I passed two AP tests (Calculus, Western Civilization) before I graduated from high school.  Where was my $500 to $1000 per test?  And I&rsquo;m not exactly to the manor born.  Oh, I forgot, wrong skin color.</p>

			<p>If you pay Robin-Hoodian income tax, and your elected officials already tell you that they have to raise your tax, again, this is where your money will go.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth remembering that federally sponsored give away of homes to blacks in response to riots and home burning during the &#8220;civil rights&#8221; movement era was based on the same logic (&#8220;if they own it, they don&rsquo;t burn it&#8221;).</p>
<p>Here is what you can expect in the future, if sitting back and reading this article is ALL you are going to do about this rip-off.</p>
<p>Paying criminals to not break the law.</p>
<p>Paying thieves to not steal.</p>
<p>Paying gangsters to not kill.</p>
<p>Paying thugs to not mug.</p>
<p>Paying illegal aliens to buy car and health insurance. (No one will pay them to stop jumping the border, though.)</p>
<p>All the above generosity will originate in your wallet.<br>

<p>And the initiative failed for the same reason an initiative that paid 10 million dollars would fail if it were contingent upon swimming the Pacific Ocean. </p>

Regular readers and posters of AR predicted this.</p>
<p>Experiments in social science have shown that you can&rsquo;t bribe anyone to better themselves. People must be self-motivated to improve their lives. They must WANT to improve their lot in life. Without the inner-drive, any external-drive is useless.</p>

<p>Well, we already do that.  It&rsquo;s called welfare, food stamps, subsidized housing, etc.  Supposed to ameliorate crime, which is, like, caused by poverty.  Not working too well, is it?</p>

This idea is not going to go away. It has a committed private group behind it. In fact, I expect it to get more support in the coming years, since any small improvement year-to-year will get enormous publicity. </p>

			<p>Amren should have two levels of membership: the regular membership that entitles you to call yourself a member and receive the Amren newsletter - and then there should be another &#8220;platinum membership&#8221; that costs about $20 more or so.  This &#8220;platinum membership&#8221; money would go into a bucket that could be used as a scholarship fund for worthy white students and to help fellow whites in need the world over.  The sons and daughters of Amren members might get special consideration.  The recipients would have to demonstrate a clear commitment to their white heritage and compose an essay &#8220;Why I am Proud to be White&#8221; or something of that nature.<br>

<p>Excellent idea JAY.</p>
<p>I would go one step further, however, and add a third membership that adds another ten or twenty dollars, with the extra money there going in a fund for running advertisements in college newspapers, etc.  And, if the fund were great enough, hopefully it would cover expenses when Jared Taylor speaks. </p>
<p>Since all membership options would be voluntary, and the regular price would still be the same, I seriously doubt that the number of participants would change, except, hopefully, as an increase in membership.</p>
<p>Right now the membership fee is really low considering that there&rsquo;s no other organization like Amren anywhere in the world.<br>

			<p>You can&rsquo;t buy respect, even self respect. <br>
When the hammier races do something (ANYTHING) to be respected for, perhaps they then will develop true self-respect(not machismo) until that happens (don&rsquo;t hold your breath)nothing will ever improve.</p>

<p>Yes, so true.</p>
<p>Equally of value are the archives to various subjects, the excellent reports like the Color of Crime, plus just a wealth of information on anti-white rhetoric by non-whites, not to mention the lessons in history we get by a contributor from time to time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all for jewamongyou&rsquo;s and Kelly&rsquo;s suggestion to offer different memberships.  </p>
<p>We should be giving Amren our maximum support.  It&rsquo;s way overdo.</p>

<p>I agree.  This is simply educational welfare, and it will further discourage personal responsibility and effort.</p>
