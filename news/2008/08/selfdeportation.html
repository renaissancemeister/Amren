						<p>The federal government will scrap a program for illegal immigrants to turn themselves in for deportation after only eight people volunteered during a nearly three-week trial, an official said Thursday.</p>
<p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement offered the pilot program in five cities, giving illegal immigrants facing court orders to leave the country 90 days to plan their departure and coordinate travel with relatives instead of facing the prospect of being arrested, detained and deported.</p>
<p>ICE will end its &#8220;Scheduled Departure&#8221; program when the trial period concludes Friday, Jim Hayes, acting director of ICE&rsquo;s detention and removal operations, told The Associated Press.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>ICE offered the program to 457,000 illegal immigrants nationwide who have ignored judicial orders to leave the country but have no criminal record. Applicants could sign up at ICE offices in Charlotte, N.C., Chicago, Phoenix, San Diego and Santa Ana.</p>
<p>Immigrant advocates said the program had few incentives and failed to consider undocumented immigrants&rsquo; ties to family in the U.S. They said they worry that ICE will cite the weak turnout as a reason to step up the raids, since it now can say that it made an effort to enforce the law in a way that was less disruptive to illegal immigrants and their families.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>ICE said it hatched the plan to quell criticism of the surge in immigration raids. One supporter of tougher enforcement said the low turnout will help insulate the agency from some of that criticism.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was calling their bluff,&#8221; said Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform.</p>

			<p>ICE can spin this stupid idea anyway they want but it is still a major STUPID idea and is emblematic of the entire immigration system under George Bush AND his &#8220;questionable&#8221;  appoinments.  The Head of ICE is Julie MYERS, the neice of chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen, Richard Myers.  She is also married to the chief of staff for Michael Chertoff.  She is a young woman who is woefully under-qualified with absolutely no background in immigration enforcement or anykind of law enforcement.  Illegal aliens know full well how dysfunctional immigration enforcement has been under Bush and it is really stupid to think these people are going to turn themselves in for deportation.</p>

			<p>Did ICE &#8220;really&#8221; think this would work? This must be the product of years of putting minorities up front for promotions!</p>

			<p>The only surprising things about this article is that they actually suspended an unproductive, unused program, and that they told anybody about it!</p>

<p>In other words, show the public what they&rsquo;ve been saying all along, you can&rsquo;t INVITE them to leave, you have to physically REMOVE them. Deportation is the only thing that works.</p>

			<p>ICE now says that since illegal alien absconders were not willing to self-deport the &#8220;humane&#8221; way, they will increase home and workplace enforcement.</p>
<p>Of course, we have been demanding for increased enforcement all along!  We&rsquo;ve also been demanding the fence all along! </p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if our so-called &#8220;representatives&#8221; stopped procrastinating and started representing We the People?</p>

			<p>the only thing wrong with this program was the fact that when illegals were asked to leave voluntarily, the invitation didn&rsquo;t go far enough. It should have been followed by &#8220;&hellip;and if you don&rsquo;t, you will go instead to prison.&#8221; Might have added a little incentive, ICE.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Forgive my ignorance, but I have been meaning to ask this for a while; when people write &#8216;MSM&rsquo; when speaking of the media, what does it stand for?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

			<p>MSM = MainStream Media.</p>
<p>It has other meanings, but in the political sense, that&rsquo;s what it means.</p>

			<p>The eight should be given Citizenship and be told &#8220;Now Go and Be the Honest American you have showed us you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>Immediate deportation for everyone else and never be allowed to to come here ever due to their dishonesty.</p>

			<p>Perhaps ICE thought that deporting aliens was one of those jobs that Americans just won&rsquo;t do.</p>

			<p>NATIONAL ID CARD&hellip;end of problem.<br>
ID card shows one thing no ID card does today&hellip;Residence<br>
Status. <br>
ID card must be shown for all welfare, apartment rentals,<br>
food purchases etc. No ID card no service. <br>
Illegals cannot exist in the country and will self deport.<br>
The US Govt will provide a bus service into interior Mexico.<br>
The border will be sealed to prevent return.</p>
<p>Its either an ID card and self deportation or the court and police costs of rounding up millions of people.</p>

			<p>Lydia, in an earlier post you mentioned how you talked to your white children and grandchildren about staying with whites instead of non-whites.  You said it worked.  Please tell us what you said, how many times you said the things you said and what ages your children and grandchildren were when you talked to them.  By giving us this information we can do exactly what you did and perhaps save our children from the fate of so many whites who are persuaded by the media that black culture is so wonderful. If you could give us specifics it would be great.  Who knows, you could save some white youth&rsquo;s life!   </p>
