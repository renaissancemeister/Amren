<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>D&rsquo;you know &mdash; and for reasons you might possibly soon understand &mdash; I was rather hoping that someone else was going to pick up on a story which appeared when I was on my summer break. But no one did. Hmmm. I wonder why? Ah well, into the valley of death, et cetera.</p>
<p>Last week, the figures appeared for the numbers of people receiving full state-subsidy for rental accommodation in Ireland. Nearly 40pc of them are immigrants. Most of these are EU nationals, and are entitled by law to the same benefits as are Irish nationals. So, the 3,061 British-born people who are getting their accommodation paid for by the state are enjoying no more than the rights which Irish people in Britain would get. Indeed, the British are top of the league of foreigners who are claiming rent allowance. And this is not surprising, for they are also the most numerous foreign group, numbering some 112,000, according to the 2006 census.</p>
<p>Second in the list of foreign groups availing of free accommodation, courtesy of the State, are who? Citizens of fellow EU states, such as the Poles, the Latvians, the Czechs or Slovaks? No, indeed not. The people who come second in the rent-allowance league table are the Nigerians &mdash; barely less than the British, with 3,024 claimants. But whereas the British figure constitutes just 2.7pc of the total population of Britons living here, the figure for Nigerians is 18.6pc of their total Irish population of 16,300. Alas, just how many more Nigerian dependents are the beneficiaries of the rent allowances that are being granted to the 3,024 family-heads, I cannot say.</p>
<p>Now this reliance upon the state for the accommodation of so many Nigerians reflects another rather uncomfortable truth which was revealed in the 2006 census, but which has never &mdash; so far as I know &mdash; been highlighted in the media. It is this: contrary to almost all predictions about the impact of immigrants upon an economy, a majority of Nigerians are not economically active at all. For even at the height of the boom, in 2006, only 38pc over the age of 15 were at work.</p>
<p>Maybe this is because so many are too old for work? Not so. There are almost no Nigerians over 50. Their average age is 26.6, with some 10,000 between the ages of 25 and 44. Yes, there are a large number of Nigerian children (3,845 under fifteen), but that figure of 38pc at work is a percentage of the over-15s only. The equivalent working proportions are: Poles, 84pc; Lithuanians, 82pc; and Latvians 82pc. On the other hand, the figures for rental-subsidy (remember: Nigerians 18.6pc) are Poles, 1.5pc; Lithuanians, 3pc; and Latvians, 4.3pc.</p>
<p>Now, you may think that what you have read so far has required a colossal amount of sleuthing &mdash; not so. Most of these figures were presented in five separate national profiles &mdash; British, Latvian, Polish, Lithuanian, Nigerian &mdash; by the Central Statistics Office in its report on the 2006 census, no doubt to make life easier for us baffled, thicko, journalists. Yet so far as I can see, no other journalist has chosen to use the startling CSO revelations, leading to the first of many questions, all of them beginning &mdash; why?</p>
<p>Why are so many people, from a country to which we have no moral or legal or historical obligations, living off this state? Why are they being allowed through immigration, if they have no jobs to go to? Why are they choosing to come to Ireland, when 20 countries or more lie between their homeland and ourselves? And finally, and perhaps most important of all, why is no one else asking why? Why did no one else pick up on the immigration digest so thoughtfully provided by the CSO?</p>
<p>Is it because we are too polite? Too timid? Too stupid? Too scared about being called racist? Which is all very well, but such intellectual and emotional repression does not usually end benignly. In place of openly spoken and verifiable truths, risible lies are whispered and believed, such as that &#8220;asylum seekers&#8221; are given free driving lessons and even cars, or that the ducks in public parks are vanishing because immigrants are catching and eating them. The acceptance of such gibberish is the foot-in-the-door of racist scaremongering, and can only happen in the dark of media-contrived ignorance, and all usually ending in tears.</p>
<p>For the real issue is not the number of Nigerians living here, nor even the absurd and unacceptable dependency of so many of them on this State. No, it is the abject refusal of the Irish people, both through the media and the Dail, to have an open debate about the biggest issue facing this country. Instead, to judge from events this time last year, our national broadcaster will soon be accusing the Catholic Church of racism &mdash; either for wanting Catholic children in its Catholic schools, or for not preparing places for African children who were not even in Ireland when the school rolls were being filled. And, naturally, for this is Ireland, it&rsquo;s professionally far more rewarding for the media to go on an easy, Catholic-bashing spree than it is to inquire into the complex and possibly discomfiting truths about immigration.<br>

<p>As for the ducks disappearing from public parks, that&rsquo;s been going on for years here in NY courtesy of Hispanic and Oriental immigrants. In 1995 a Chinese Restaurant in Long Island was shut down after the authorities learned that the roast ducks being served came from a nearby park. </p>

			<p>Why is the influx of large numbers of racially and culturally different people the biggest <br>
issue facing Ireland (and the USA, and England, and Italy, and France, and Germany, and so on)?  It should not be an issue at all, because it should not be happening. </p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s the reality, Mr. Myers: welfare states such as European nations have created need welfare clientele, and the more shiftless, unproductive clients they have, the more the welfare state, its budget, its mission and its functionaries can grow, increase and expand.  <p>Why does a welfare client need historical ties to Ireland as long as the client can consume government services as well or better than native Irish?  A social welfare bureaucrat&rsquo;s allegiance is to his/her job and its benefits, not to race, community, traditions, culture or nation, and the fact that so many of these welfare apparatchiki are politically leftist makes them even more inclined to welcome unceasing importation of Third World &#8220;clientele,&#8221; and to suppress opposition to or even &#8220;honest debate&#8221; about such immigration, thus cloaking their venal self-interest with &#8220;moral principle.&#8221;</p></p>

			<p>I have never in my life met up with a more arrogant type of liberal than the Irish-American from the northeast, especially from Boston or New York.  I&rsquo;m not saying they&rsquo;re all liberal - they aren&rsquo;t.  But the most vociferously multi-cultural ones, the ones who are most likely to get in your face with their fanatical civil rights lunacy come from that area.  It pleases me no end to see the coming fracas in Ireland over the very issue that these Kennedyesque gadflies have pushed for the past half century.  I just hope the older ones, the ones over 65, live long enough to witness a major racial conflagration a la Watts in their homeland.  That would be too poetic to even describe.</p>

			<p>Actually he tempers his heroism in the last paragraph by saying that it is not the number of Nigerians there but the public&rsquo;s refusal to have a debate. Nonsense. It is there very presence that is the issue, even if they were all hard working, productive members of society. Their removal should not even require a debate.</p>

			<p>Maybe a Nigerian president of Ireland will have enough sense to end welfare and free immigration.  I&rsquo;d put up with a black leprechaun on my box of Lucky Charms for that.  </p>
<p>White Irish, like Whites everywhere else, are just too sophisticated to stop their racial suicide.</p>

<p>Why should they work when the can live off the state. European welfare states may work with europeans but they won&rsquo;t work with the 3rd world. This is something the USA has always understood because we have had far more 3rd worlders in our history then europe. This is also one of the main reasons the US has always been less socialist than Europe. </p>

			<p>The British, many of whom wll have at least some Irish ancestry, are entitled to equal treatmet as the Irish have always had the rights to freedom of movement and to benefits in the UK.</p>
<p>Third world mgrants however should have no rights. They have contributed nothing to the establishment of our Western nations.</p>

			<p>kc: &#8220;European welfare states may work with europeans but they won&rsquo;t work with the 3rd world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Exactly.  This is what a handful of European countries  &mdash;   such as Denmark, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Hungary, increasingly even France, Belgium and the Netherlands  &mdash;   have caught onto.  A welfare state works only when you have ethnic solidarity, when people feel part of the group and want to boost each other up.  It&rsquo;s parasitized when you start letting in the 3rd world  &mdash;   which is something that Britain, Sweden, Canada, Australia and Ireland have utterly failed to understand.  Britain in particular, now has about 7 million Muslims and millions more people from South Asia, Africa and the Philippines who have little interest in contributing to the community, b/c they don&rsquo;t feel they&rsquo;re a part of it.  And with their high birth rates, they will soon be the majority in Britain.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is also one of the main reasons the US has always been less socialist than Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the flip-side of this is that the USA was the first White nation to be overrun by the guilt complex over Black slavery, which came to a head at a particularly unfortunate time, when we were suffering defeat in Vietnam, divided and lacking confidence.  This is in part what led to not only the 1965 immigration disaster, but the dozens of little laws that followed in the decade after its wake, which ensured chain migration and massive affirmative action for the budding 3rd world majority in the USA.</p>
<p>Thus, in fact, the USA was the first White nation to decide that diluting out its White population to achieve &#8220;diversity&#8221; was somehow the upright, enlightened thing to do, and this self-destructive mind virus has affected much of the West, particularly other Anglophone countries such as Britain and Australia which follow the US&rsquo;s cultural lead.  Fortunately, it&rsquo;s had less of an effect on other White countries like Germany, Denmark and Hungary, which still use a bloodlines-based immigration policy due to their own history of fighting the Turks and halting the Ottoman invasions.</p>

<p>Maybe they can set an example other European nations will follow. Probably not though.</p>

More splendid &#8220;shots fired&#8221; by Mr. Myers. Very glad to see you still have your job, sir. Hope it stays that way. </p>
<p>But I would caution poster Xenophon not to indulge in too much Schadenfreude re possible race riots in Ireland due to the Universalist arrogance of their long-departed cousins who emigrated to New England. Yes, many among the hated Northeastern liberal elite are of Irish Catholic stock; and yes, such people have PLENTY to answer for. But I don&rsquo;t see why the good people of Dublin should have to watch their lovely city burn just because thousands of miles away in Massachussetts, Ted Kennedy has been acting like an idiot. </p>
<p>Of course, for that matter, the good people of Dublin shouldn&rsquo;t have to put up with this Nigerian nonsense at all. <br>

			<p>Neuromancer, it pleases me in particular to see England going down the drain.  If there is any one nation on this planet that has headed us over the multicultural cliff, it is England.  They RICHLY deserve their Churchillian fate.  White unity?  You must be on crack.  The most we can hope for is that one of the nations of Europe will finally impose unity and some type of uniform ethnic sanity.  Right now, that ethnicity would be either Russian or German.  May the best ethnicity win.  And the sooner we get US troops out of Europe, the sooner they will sort things out. </p>

			<p>20 years ago, Ireland was one of the poorest countries in the EU.  They have received massive subsidies from the EU, and major investment from many multinationals, which has helped it to become one of the wealthiest.  These investments and subsidies, however, came with a catch.  You must &#8220;diversify&#8221;.  Now its payback time. </p>

			<p>   My good friends, blacks and muslims are moving into western European countries for one reason, and one reason only. They are actually invading western European aided by leftist governments. They will mix themselves amongst the population of these countries and they will do their very best to destroy white Europeans en masse. Look at the &#8220;white countries&#8221; around the world. The U.S., Canada, western European. they all have one thing in common, they are being invaded by hordes of immigrants that have no good intentions. What will it take to make us (whites) rise up and demand a reversal of these immigration trends? It is my personal opinion, that the reason the U.N. is raising Hell with Russia is because Russia is resisting the suicide of immigration. I think the whole Georgia-Russia conflict is being forced into play by outsiders (other U.N. nations). I am afraid I must side with the Russians on this one. </p>

<p>(The British and the Unionists do not come out of it well either.)</p>

			<p>It seems that these small all white European nations are <i>driven</i> to destroy themselves. Does anything, can anything, explain such madness? </p>

			<p>Ricpic, the European nations aren&rsquo;t driven to destroy themselves, they are being driven to destruction by people who hate whites. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Really? Does it please you to see the same thing happening in England? How about France? Germany perhaps?</p>
<p>I thought this was a white unity site.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is a white unity site but outside of this site, whites are not unified, quite the opposite. Also, I agree that there should be no pleasure at any white nation going down the tubes.</p>

<p>True enough but we should be encouraging unity among Whites in any country instead of engaging in this Schadenfreude. <br>
Now it appears that Bush wants to go to war with Russia another White country because of Ossetia. Russia tried to prevent Georgia from seceding previously and there was also conflict in Chechniya. Mc Cain declared that no country invades another sovereign state in the 21st century. Wasn&rsquo;t Iraq a sovereign state? <br>
We laid waste to the South to prevent it from breaking away. The Russians in Georgia did little compared to what the US military did to our OWN Georgia in 1864 and the atrocities committed during &#8220;Reconstruction&#8221;.<br>
Over the last 200 years, Whites have spent quite a bit of time annihilating each other.</p>

<p>&gt; Actually, if you really listened, he said &#8220;European&#8221; state in the 21st century.  But your point is still good.</p>
