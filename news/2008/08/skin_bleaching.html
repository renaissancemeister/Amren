<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Scores of Ugandans continue to bleach their skin despite a government ban on the sale of several lotions, creams, gels and soaps which are largely used to whiten, even and tone the skin.</p>
<p>Due to ineffective enforcement of the ban, these dangerous cosmetics are easily accessible anywhere in Uganda; whether sold over the counter, along the roadside or by hawkers, vendors move the skin lighteners easily due to high demand. Such is the popularity that skin-whitening products have gained today in Uganda.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to dermatologists, skin bleaching can be achieved through a combination of treatments that reduce or block some amount of the body&rsquo;s melanin production. Usually in the form of topical lotions, gels, pills and creams, these products contain melanin-inhibiting ingredients along with sunscreen. These treatments also contain amounts of hydroquinone, or mercury.</p>
<p>However, other cosmetics companies use natural ingredients to make melanin-inhibiting products. Extracted from plant leaves like the berry family, shrubs and pears, their naturally occurring arbutin leads to bleaching.</p>
<p>In Uganda, the practice of skin bleaching is common among adults with dark skin, especially women, but men also do it with little regard for the dangers posed to their bodies. Some people even use the products for anal bleaching to reduce naturally darker pigmentation of the genital and perineal area.</p>
<p>Consumers of bleaching cosmetics claim that they want to enhance their beauty. One woman who declined to be named, explains, &#8220;One has to look good, by having fair, lighter skin.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, her skin is now multi-colored from bleaching. She has red skin on her face, yellow on her arms and dark skin on her back. The skin on her knees, toes and finger joints failed to lighten and remain black.</p>
<p>For this woman, the condition of her skin has only brought her shame; she now tries to cover most parts of her body in an attempt to conceal the damage done by the products she thought would enhance her beauty.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Dr Misaki Wayengera of Makerere University Medical School.] explains that the skin of the people using these bleaching products get inflamed, turns red, enlarges and begins to loose function as the cells fail to produce melanin.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Though the East African Custom Management Act of 2006 banned the import of all soaps containing mercury, products like Mekako soaps are readily available in the country having been smuggled in before being re-exported to neighboring Kenya, Tanzania and Rwanda.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ready markets for these highly valued cosmetics suggest that smuggling won&rsquo;t stop any time soon, but demand alone does not explain why one would continue to use these dangerous products.</p>

			<p>I have always thought that the attraction that black men have to white women is based on a deep seated desire to be white.  This transfers to a desire to have &#8220;whiter&#8221; children.  And that idea fits in with a discussion some of us had on Amren posts earlier this year where some posited that whites evolved because of a natural attraction to a lighter skinned partner.  That may be so, even though there seems to be no way to prove that.  The sudden appearance of white people on earth remains a mystery.  (Are we the Martians?) I think it is only a recent social perversion that has promoted black as beautiful and produced so many white women who find black men attractive.</p>

			<p>I caught some of the commercials for the whitening creams used in India on Youtube, and was amused by how many blacks were chastizing Indians for not appreciating the true beauty of dark skin, and that black was beautiful etc..<br>
Of course, they blamed whites for Indians wanting lighter skin, saying it was because of colonial rule. I&rsquo;d love to hear them explain how whites are responsible for women in Uganda bleaching their skin. What white ruler inspired them to this? Idi Amin?</p>

			<p>Sherwood Smith &hellip;The Asians appreciate white skin in their women but most of them have it already, Europeans aren&rsquo;t the only ones with white skin.  In fact, some Europeans have reddish skin, not white.  And I think you&rsquo;re wrong about the hair, most people in the world want straight hair and Asians have that naturally.  I like most of the comments on this board, but sometimes, people sound ignorant and just plain racist and that&rsquo;s a turnoff.  People and the MSM will accept race reality more if we stick to the truth and not promote white superiority across the board.  If people continue to do so, it will give the liberals a valid reason to dismiss everything we believe in.</p>

Yes, many Asians can be light skinned, usually with a more olive tone to it. Others have a more brownish tone to their skin, that can be quite dark. The darkest among them are usually far darker than the darkest Europeans. And it certainly is not true that, most Europeans have reddish skin, instead of white. If you ever view some of these skin lightening commercial from India and Asia, they often stress pinkish white skin, or fair skin with a blush to the cheeks. Such complexions are found mostly in Northern Europeans. English women are famous for their rosy complexions. It is true, that causasian hair can range from straight to wavy to curly, while most Asians do have straight hair. Just as White Caucasians can have hair that naturally runs in any color, or can have any eye color. I think if whites are envied for anything, it is for the naturally variety they have in terms of hair and eye color. Something you rarely see in other races.<br>

			<p>A cursory overview of Japanese art through the Heian through the Meiji eras (ie, from several centuries AGO through to the American Civil War) shows strong preferences for white skin tones - even before there was an America to pin any blame on. Note also the traditional, extremely white make-up preferred by Geisha courtesans and entertainers - another period pre-dating the US by at least 100 years.</p>
<p>The preference for light skin and face as beauty clearly arose autonomously in Japan, before the US existed and with no European &#8216;interference,&rsquo; and it currently carries on through Japanese cartooning (called &#8216;anime&rsquo;) where with skin tones are generally light, hair is straight (another recessive characteristic) and where the occurrence of &#8216;afro&rsquo; hairstyles or even details to indicate wiry hair are rare. Most &#8216;afro&rsquo;-haired characters are comical extremes, prat-fall guys, or sidekicks and are rarely part of the main story line. This is similar to &#8216;blaxploitation&rsquo; shows in the US in the 70&rsquo;s. </p>
<p>Most important is that with the exception of say, a blatantly green-eyed blonde, Japanese viewers consider the characters as &#8216;Japanese&rsquo; when they see them and hear native Japanese voices. Greens and blues are also sometimes used in hair to differentiate characters.</p>
<p>Although parents need to watch for unacceptable exposure at times, for Caucasians raising children many (but not all) Japanese anime shows offer pluses, including: Expectations of chastity through the  high school years except for &#8216;bad&rsquo; characters, family loyalty, and polite behaviour andrespect for elders, teachers, and other authority figures such as the police.<br>
Also, with the exception of magical or horror setting stories, tattoos and unusual piercings are also not present in &#8216;good&rsquo; or &#8216;normal person&rsquo; characters.</p>
<p>Sometimes Japanese animated shows can be a pleasant alternative to &#8216;Mandatory Diversity&rsquo; - a Barbie &amp; Ken world for children, rather than a Bratz world, with Waltons-type families often out numbering Simpsons types.</p>
<p>Even in Japan trends are changing: more broken homes, more &#8216;foreigners,&rsquo; visible especially in Tokyo, and these non-tradtional characters and themes are making inroads into their works of entertainment. But there should still be a good stock of a 15 - 20 year period of &#8216;diversity-free&rsquo; entertainment available for Caucasian families. The window may extend another 5 - 15 years before they import enough liberal values to destroy their sense of homogeneity and they too get &#8216;mandatory diversity&rsquo; projected onto them.</p>
<p>Other than that you may have to time-travel a bit by watching movies like &#8216;The Sound of Music&rsquo; to see a large family of normal, good-looking parents and well-behaved children.<br>

<p>Well, they will, of course. It&rsquo;s the fault of racial preferences in the white entertainment industry.  Try convincing black groups in the West otherwise.  However, there is plenty of evidence for the preference of white skin in the ancient world. There&rsquo;s a book called White Gold that chronicles Muslim trade in whites (mainly female).  Then we have the Japanese preference for pale skin and antithesis towards dark skin going back millenia.</p>

<p><br>
Well, we all know the phrase that &#8220;Black is beautiful&#8221; but quite honestly, I never hear many non-blacks go on about the amazing beauty of black males either. There have also been plenty male heartthrobs in Hollywood, who might not be described as fair, but would definitely be called white. In Bollywood however, light skinned men do seemed to be favored over the darker ones, although maybe not to the same degree as the females. But the fact that they developed a Fair and handsome cream, and that it is selling briskly, shows that even some of the men in India desire lighter skin.</p>

			<p>It was apparent to me, growing up in the Bay Area; many black and minority males in general hate White men - but love White women. In addition, many black and minority women loved the idea of having &#8220;mixed&#8221; babies with &#8220;good hair&#8221; and &#8220;light eyes&#8221;<br>
Decriptions of good and evil from many cultures are described as the &#8220;light&#8221; of goodness, and the &#8220;darkness&#8221; of evil. Caucasians are basically despised for their fairness, both physically and spiritually. Liberal Whites feel guilt and hatred for having desirable genetics, and it makes no sense at all to feel shame for what should be a source of pride. It&rsquo;s Occidental, not accidental&hellip;<br>

<p>The ideal for males seems to be a light tan color (think Southern European). Due to the effects of testosterone, men are naturally a bit darker than females, so this should be expected.</p>

			<p>Isn&rsquo;t it ironic that the only race stupid enough to want to darken their skin are whites?

who is the FAIREST of them all?&rsquo;: <br>
As many studies have revealed, society has a significant impact on the misuse of skin lightening agents. It is known that during slavery years, light-skinned people were often given preferable treatment as compared to their dark-skinned peers&hellip;.The mass media, particularly television, contributes to this perception by portraying &ldquo;whiteness or lightness&rdquo; as a symbol of what is attractive</p>
<p>Now that is some black belt race-card throwing when you can blame American slavery for skin bleaching in Africa! <br>

LOL How true! Yes, they always have a way bringing white guilt into everything. They of course say Asians, Middle Easterners, and Indians favor lighter skin, because of Colonialism. But in recent years, blacks have decided that Whites tan, not to be to capture a summery looking glow, or to look beachy, or rested, but because they want to look black! Not just non-white, or more ethnic mind you, but BLACK. Do they blame the media for showing images of young white stars with spray-on tans? Nope, it&rsquo;s not about the media, or being trendy, it&rsquo;s a deep seated longing to be as beautiful as they are. When non-whites make try and make themselves look lighter or whiter, it is because evil whitey, brainwashed them to feel unworthy. But when whites tan themselves darker, it&rsquo;s because blacks are so great looking whitey is trying to look like them. Bragging or blaming, is what they do best.</p>

			<p>black is not beautiful!  White is beautiful!  The difference is that if you have to go around saying that black is beautiful, who are you really trying to fool. </p>
<p>White people don&rsquo;t have to go around screaming this statement because we already know that it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>This article is a true testament of this fact.    If black is &#8220;so&#8221; beautiful why are they trying so hard to be lighter.</p>
<p>I found the below paragraph espeacially humorous.</p>
<p>[In Uganda, the practice of skin bleaching is common among adults with dark skin, especially women, but men also do it with little regard for the dangers posed to their bodies. Some people even use the products for anal bleaching to reduce naturally darker pigmentation of the genital and perineal area.]</p>
<p>Skin bleaching is common among adults with &#8220;dark&#8221; skin. <br>
So, now black skin is referred to as dark skin.   In Uganda, as well as in all the regions of black Africa, their skin is the blackest of all black skin.   Don&rsquo;t even want to imagine what the other parts look like.</p>
<p>From reading the original article it would appear that Africans don&rsquo;t even like the color of their skin.</p>
<p>I am very comfortable in my &#8220;White&#8221; skin. </p>

			<p>Clontarf: I highly doubt the anime art style has much to do with a fetishization of western features. I&rsquo;ve read from a number of cultural anthropological works that the japanese really don&rsquo;t treat those features as any more foreign, and the roots of the anime/manga art style go much farther back than western influences that popped up in the mid-20th century.</p>
<p>And honestly, the white makeup of geishas is often ridiculously pale, way outside of the range that humans are genetically capable of. Not to mention that the japanese also used to think black-painted teeth on females was an attractive trait.</p>

<p>Wow. You do realize that different cultures have vastly differing values associated with certain colors, right? And how do darker southern europeans factor in with your nordicist fetish? I&rsquo;m so sick of seeing this outlook among white racialists.</p>

			<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s possible that light skin might be more innately desired for females on average among humans, but I find that highly doubtful when it comes to males. How often do you ever see people going on about the amazing beauty of white males?&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
     In India there is a craze for fairness in men as well. Many marriage adverts specify &#8216;wheatish&rsquo; or &#8216;fair&rsquo; complexion in men. Many women who advertising themselves mention &#8216;no dark men please&rsquo;. Therefore they have comeup with this product &#8216;FAIR AND HANDSOME&rsquo; for men.<br>

			<p>There&rsquo;s another thing I&rsquo;d like to note- albinos are incredibly common in africa. The skin of albino blacks isn&rsquo;t as light as albino whites, and is much more similar to the typical skin color average among whites.</p>
<p>Yet albinos are considered pariahs in nearly all african cultures. Too bad there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be much research comparing this to the popularity of these beauty creams.</p>

			<p> &#8220;I like most of the comments on this board, but sometimes, people sound ignorant and just plain racist and that&rsquo;s a turnoff. People and the MSM will accept race reality more if we stick to the truth and not promote white superiority across the board.&#8221;</p>
<p>I agree. It&rsquo;s about white seperatism and whites having the right to their own cultures just the same as non-whites having, valuing and protecting their own cultures. That&rsquo;s all.  The truth of the matter is that it&rsquo;s sad when someone doesn&rsquo;t like how they were born, either  dark or light skinned.  Personally, there are attractive people in all races and all skin tones.  However, physical appearance or preference isn&rsquo;t the issue here.</p>

			<p>They do the same thing here in the USA.<br>
Saw a show on Tyra Bank sabout it - another bleached sista. No ? Look at her when she was little nd now. She looks white.<br>
MANY blacks here stay OUT OF THE SUN, to become whiter. It&rsquo;s sad. <br>
Even Obama - he looks like he&rsquo;s Chinese ? Yellowish. He NEEDS some sun. Purple lips and yellow skin is not right.<br>
There is a HUGE desire by blacks to have a white woman and dump them as soon as they can after defiling them. I have know MANY bm&rsquo;s in college, all the same. Most seemed to see a blonde as the ultimate - pretty intelligent, huh ? But anything white would do- the easier, the better. And we wonder why AIDS is rampant with blacks ? </p>
