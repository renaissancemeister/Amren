						<p>Four Mexican army soldiers entered southern Arizona and pointed their rifles at a U.S. Border Patrol agent early this week, the Border Patrol said.</p>
<p>The incident Sunday was the Mexican military&rsquo;s 43rd incursion across the U.S. border since October, the agency said. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The incident took place just north of the border in sight of the new border fence.</p>
<p>The soldiers held their weapons on the agent for several minutes until he identified himself in Spanish, whereupon they lowered their guns and walked back across a gap in the fence, Scioli said.</p>
<p>In Washington, D.C., State Department spokesman Gonzalo Gallegos said the encounter &#8220;stemmed from a momentary misunderstanding as to the exact location of the U.S.-Mexican border.&#8221;</p>

											<p>
							<i>AP, August 9, 2008</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The city of Ciudad Acuna, across the border from Del Rio, Texas, said Friday that it fined four U.S. residents for carrying extra diesel and would impound their cars until they pay. The fines equal 70 percent of the value of the diesel confiscated.</p>
<p>U.S. drivers can fill up their own vehicles, but carrying extra fuel containers back across the border violates customs regulations and possibly safety rules, a report from the city said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mexican filling stations near the U.S. border have seen an increase in American drivers who cross over to fill up. Mexican truckers and drivers complain the run on fuel is causing temporary shortages and longer lines for them.<br>

<p>Okay, where to begin? I think I&rsquo;ll start with that infuriating Hispanic belief that it is a human right to be addressed in Spanish.</p>
<p>Next issue is the incredibly pathetic spin job here by Senor Gonzalo Gallegos, who tells us that these invading enemy soldiers didn&rsquo;t know on which side of the fence was Mexico. So you see we&rsquo;re not dealing with an act of war, foolish white Americans, we&rsquo;re just dealing with Mexicans who never learned basic land navigation. Now take some soma and go back to sleep, white America. </p>

<p>The government and self-appointed elitists have made doing business and earning money the tenants of their new religion.  Anything that disrupts that process is going to be avoided at all costs.</p>
<p>So, if a few citizens or Border Patrol Agents are murdered in a cross-border attack they will be regarded as nothing more or less than collateral damage, unavoidable costs in the pursuit of the elitist&rsquo;s larger goal and therefore justifiable.  No responsive military action would ever be taken, just a show of force and some angry threats to fool the witless in this country they truly mean business.</p>
<p>Free trade and the importation of low wage worker ants and tax units are vital in the pursuit of the mighty dollar.  Nothing like defending this country&rsquo;s sovereignty, and disrupting those two vital goals, will ever come about, nor would they be tolerated.</p>
<p>This is the age of greed and stupidity.  Mark it as another milestone in this country&rsquo;s slow decline toward disintegration.</p>

			<p>Mexico has some nerve fining american drivers for filling up on extra diesel from mexico&rsquo;s state subsidized oil. Mexico should be giving us free gas after the billions we spend on free medical care for their citizens among other things. We need to send the bill for all of this free medical to mexico. Mexico is no friend of the USA, they are our enemy. We need to shut the border down, enough already. No wonder so many in other countries hate the USA, nobody likes a wimp!</p>

			<p>I doubt anyone in Washington really cares, but technically this is an act of war. </p>

			<p>I really feel sorry for border patrol agents. They know if they actually enforce the law they could well end up being prosecuted by Bush&rsquo;s pal Johnny Sutton. And Mexican soldiers could invade America all the way up to Minnesota and Bush would make excuses for them. And Bush&rsquo;s refusal to pardon Ramos and Compean shows he does not want the border enforced. And Bush&rsquo;s refusal to pardon these men clearly shows Bush leaves a lot to be desired as a decent human being. <br>

			<p>One can only wonder how the uniformed alien thugs would have treated American civilians who were hunting small game or just plinking cans, instead of a uniformed border agent with government ID.</p>
<p>This would immediately cease to be a problem if we mined the border.  Once a few dozen Mexican soldiers were missing legs, the rest would stop their cross-border incursions.  A &#8220;Bouncing Betty&#8221; or a Claymore would do the job on a whole platoon.  To make certain everyone knwe where the border was, both the north and south edges of the minefield would be marked with three rows of concertina wire.</p>

			<p>Gee, too bad our government had already removed the national guard troops - but oh, that&rsquo;s right, they weren&rsquo;t allowed to have loaded weapons anyway. </p>
<p>What a fine track record the Bush non-administration administration will leave us - when it finally sneaks out of office for their expensive vacation spots and privately policed gated communities - clearing room in D.C. for more of the same.</p>

<p>Indeed. For that matter a mosquito flying over the border from North to South Korea puts the military on alert. For some occult reason only our own borders are, according to the political class, &#8220;impossible&#8221; to guard.</p>

			<p>In an earlier time there would have been a shootout, and the Mexican soldiers would have gotten the short end of the gun, as they always did. </p>

			<p>A final observation, that will surprise no one on this forum I&rsquo;m sure. State Department Spokesman Gonzalo Gallegos is lying thru his teeth about a &#8220;misunderstanding&#8221;. The only misunderstanding that exists in this nation visa-vie illegal immigration and the border, is the one that politicians have with 80 percent or more of the American public.  </p>

			<p>Maybe some of our American Muslim converts would be willing to go do suicide bomber duty on the Mexican border, that would eliminate the need to imprison our border patrol agents for enforcint the law and the need to support the illegals that the suicide bomber took our:) Just a thought you understand, taking care of two problems at the same time.</p>
