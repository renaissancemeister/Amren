<p>The U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination also voiced concern at a rise in racist-related incidents in Germany against members of the Jewish, Muslim and Roma/Sinti communities, and asylum-seekers of African origin.</p>
<p>In Switzerland, it noted a lack of substantial progress in combating racist and xenophobic attitudes towards some minorities, including blacks, Muslims, immigrants and asylum seekers.</p>
<p>Another concern in Switzerland &mdash; a country of 7.5 million where one in five people is a foreigner &mdash; was racial profiling, including at airports, as well as allegations of excessive use of force by the police, according to the U.N. watchdog.</p>
<p>The committee, composed of 18 independent experts, examined eight countries&rsquo; compliance with a U.N. treaty banning racial discrimination.</p>

			<p>I hope that Germany and Switzerland will assert their right of self-determination to the U.N. and the EU.  Perhaps only these two countries can be all that will soon be left of white Europe.  I also support their expulsion of non-whites from their territories.  After all, whites can&rsquo;t live on Indian Reservations in the U.S.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t know how much more Germany and Switzerland can do to pander to non-whites, short of surrendering to Osama bin Laden.  It wasn&rsquo;t long after 9/11 that the German political body politic was that, in the years leading up to 9/11, the German authorities were focusing on &#8220;skin heads&#8221; and bent-cross groups as the source of terrorism, and missing Arabs and Muslims.</p>

			<p>Who are these &#8216;independant experts&rsquo;?  When will their conclusions be submitted for peer review, so that white nationalists can respond. </p>
<p>The &#8216;banning of racial discrimination&rsquo; is U.N.-speak for &#8216;white people - give up your rights to self-determination, and hand over your possessions, land, women, and homes to the Third World&rsquo; </p>

			<p>IF they are really doing all this, it would appear to any sane person they are indeed trying to combat racism. What are we doing belonging to an organization that is comprised of nations who hate us, and are trying to usurp our freedom? Also who is always the one who has to fight all their battles, and bail out their sorry behinds? Get the US out of the UN.</p>

<p>Yes, the UN is all of that and worse. Fortunately its days are numbered. When the USA joins the USSR on history&rsquo;s dustbin, the UN will go there as well   &mdash;   it cannot survive without its #1 sugar daddy   &mdash;   namely, Uncle Sam. Even if all the liberal nations of the former USA banded together and tried to keep the UN going, IMHO it wouldn&rsquo;t be enough.</p>

			<p>If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, Switzerland is NOT a member of the United Nations - therefore, I don&rsquo;t think it should concern itself with the opinions of the United Nations. The U.N. has no jurisdiction over non-member states. Switzerland should tell the U.N. to go suck ovaries.</p>

			<p>There can be no racial discrimination in Switzerland if they keep the country white. No Hate, stereo-typing, prejudice, bigotry, or racial incidents either. Yet the enlightened response to all this hate is to call for even more immigration. I say end immigration. These poor non-whites have suffered enough!</p>

			<p>One of the funnier things going on in Africa is BLACK U.N. peacekeepers in Darfur are being identified as the major perpetrators of crimes in that country, especially multiple rapes and robberies. They also refuse to take any armed action against the Muslims who are doing a fair amount of the raping and killing in the country themselves.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Switzerland was forced to join the UN in 2002 after leftists <a>managed to get a referendum passed</a> by a very narrow margin. Direct democracy can be a force for ill as well as for good.</p>

			<p>Whiteplight is right  &mdash;   Germany and Switzerland, as well as Alpine Austria right next door, are basically the only &#8220;core society&#8221; we have left for White civilization.  I&rsquo;ve worked all over the world, and the German-speaking countries  &mdash;   along with Denmark and Hungary  &mdash;   are among the few places left in the West with a core nationalism (forged from centuries of fighting the Turks), a bloodlines-based immigration policy (restricting immigration to ethnic Germans/Nordic peoples overseas including Dutch, Poles, Anglo-Saxons, Baltics and Scandinavians), and a high-tech modern society, who are nonetheless still hospitable to guests.  The UK, Australia, Canada and the USA are too far gone, stuck on the self-destructive course of &#8220;proposition nations&#8221; and determined to undo themselves demographically.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed an awful lot of young White families among old friends and acquaintances, originally from the USA, Canada and Australia, who are emigrating, and Germany and Austria seem to be the top choices.  Aside from the one hassle of learning German, which people do quickly, it&rsquo;s not difficult and it&rsquo;s a major step up in quality of life, with a genuine future for their kids in a country that, in the wake of the horrendous upheavals that will be partitioning the USA, Australia, Canada and the UK in 20 years&rsquo; time, will still be intact.  (Many Italian-Americans and Italian-Australians are moving to Italy, which is also starting to adopt the German/Austrian model.)  The only piece of good news here otherwise is that, even the Netherlands, France, Belgium, Norway and Finland are starting to recognize the unsustainable nature of the US/UK &#8220;open borders&#8221; system and are opting for the German/Austrian model that focuses immigrants on the Diaspora overseas.  So maybe the Central European &#8220;core&#8221; of Europe will increase somewhat.</p>

			<p>The funny side of this thing is that, if Jews are attacked in Germany, the attackers are usually Arabs who came to Germany for asylum. The UN is too tactful to mention that.</p>

<p>Does the UN care about Mugabe killing whites there?  Does the UN care about the fact Hawaiian hates white people?  Does the UN care about the fact that the Malyasian government discriminates against the Chinese?  Apparently, it&rsquo;s wrong for whites to keep their land white, but not for non-whites.  Sounds like racism to me.</p>

			<p>Why is it that America is the only country in the world that thinks it needs the UN&rsquo;s permission to do anything? Right now Pres. Bush is wringing his hands over Georgia because the UN won&rsquo;t act. Regan never needed the UN&rsquo;s permission the way George Sr. and George Jr. thinks America does?</p>

			<p>Approximately twenty years ago I was on a plane bound for Moscow with a stop over in Zürich. On the plane were approximately ten black clergy men, dressed in their black clergymen outfits, with each one getting drunk as skunk. When the plane stopped at the airport, the Swiss came in wearing their funny little uniforms which did not seem quite so funny at the time since each one had that non funny &#8220;look&#8221; on their face and their finger on an Uzi&rsquo;s trigger!   </p>
<p>They took the blacks, and only the blacks, off the plane, lined them up against a wall and searched both them and their baggage. Finding nothing, they were allowed back on the plane and we left.</p>
<p>Of course, from that point on, all the blacks talked about was suing the airline, the airport, the Swiss military, the country of Switzerland, and the United States. Apparently no one had bothered to tell them that the United States Supreme Court somehow lacked jurisdiction over Switzerland!</p>
<p>Not only did the Swiss humiliate the blacks but they had the unmitigated gall not to apologize either! Apparently since slavery never existed in Switzerland, or if it did exist it was done on a limited basis, (since there was no cotton), the Swiss did not possess the required &#8220;white guilt&#8221;!  </p>
<p>On the return flight I sat beside a Swiss official who explained to me in French, German and broken English: &#8220;we find blacks to be dangerous and divisive, we don&rsquo;t like them, we don&rsquo;t trust them, and we don&rsquo;t want them here; and, we aren&rsquo;t going to  apologize to anyone for protecting ourselves&#8221;</p>
<p>From that point forward I loved Switzerland!</p>

			<p>Another irritating thing (among many) about the U.N. is that every time an African country or a Balkan country breaks up into several countries, each of them joins the U.N. and has an equal say in where the money (from the U.S. mostly) goes to and guess who gets it?</p>

			<p>Oh come on Southern Hoosier, what should Jorge II do about Georgia besides shoot himself in the foot and start world war III? When are people like you going to realize that the so called US Govt. is the cause of much evil in the world and the ultimate cause of white dispossesion worldwide? I&rsquo;m hoping that the new Russia will rise up to lead Europe and then the whole White World back to racial sanity. The sooner this unamerican empire flings itself into the dustbin of history, the better.</p>
