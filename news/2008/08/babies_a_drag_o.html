						<p>FORGET those plans to have a third child for the country because further increases in the birth rate could harm the economy, the nation&rsquo;s productivity watchdog has warned.</p>
<p>A major analysis of the nation&rsquo;s increasing fertility rate said it was at its highest level for 25 years &mdash; but the Productivity Commission yesterday warned further increases may aggravate rather than solve the problem of the ageing of the population. </p>
<p>This is because it will shift women out of the workforce while they care for babies, depressing labour supply and reducing the taxation base as our population ages, the Daily Telegraph reported. </p>
<p>The small number of extra babies born would make little difference to the rate of population ageing, the commission said. </p>
<p>And the women having the babies would be exacerbating the financial impacts on the government of the ageing of the population because the tax breaks offered to parents to have children occur up front, while the cost savings of a bigger working population and bigger tax base from extra children are deferred until they are of working age. </p>
<p>The commission&rsquo;s views were of particular interest as next month it is expected to hand down a much anticipated report into whether the nation should adopt a paid maternity leave scheme. </p>
<p>It found the $5000 baby bonus, which is expected to be rolled into any new paid maternity leave scheme, had had only a partial role in lifting the fertility rate. </p>
<p>The baby bonus represented only a 1 per cent reduction in the lifetime costs of a first child, which would cost its parents at least $385,000 over its lifetime. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Any significant fertility effect from the bonus would suggest the presence of short-sightedness by parents about the lifetime costs of raising children,&rdquo; the report said. </p>
<p>The commission said the Family Tax Benefit payments, averaging around $5000 per family per year, were more likely to have had a bigger impact on lifting the national fertility rate. </p>
<p>These payments cut the cost of children by 8 per cent a year and the generosity of these benefits increased significantly after 2000. </p>
<p>More than 285,000 births were registered last year, the highest level in 25 years. </p>
<p>The commission said this was mainly a catch-up effect as women deferred childbirth to later in life. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Having reached older ages, they are now having these postponed babies,&rdquo; it said. </p>
<p>The fertility rate would be even higher but for the effects of high house prices and better educated women, the commission said. </p>
<p>More highly educated women can earn good money if they work rather than stay at home to care for children and this had depressed the birth rate. </p>
<p>The higher cost of housing meant it took longer to afford a house, which has delayed child-bearing.<br>

			<p>In other words this report is demanding that Australia continue down the path of a sort of revervse eugenics that all western countries are going down. </p>
<p>The high IQ individuals must continue to forgo having families so they can concentrate on working hard to bankroll the social programs that allow the low IQ individuals to raise enormous broods that would probably starve to death if left to their own devices.</p>
<p>Thus the gene pool of talented individuals dries up, the schools are dumbed down, and spark of progress and dynamicism fades and Australia is forever reduced to just another miserable and overcrowded third world slum from which it will never escape once its population lacks the genetic capacity to do so.</p>

			<p>Now which is it?  Do we need to import more Third Worlders because White citizens are not having enough babies (bad for the economy), or should Whites have fewer babies, because having White children is bad for the economy?  </p>
<p>Dear reader, are you beginning to understand why every day, more and more thinking Whites turn to web-sites like this one? Are you beginning to understand why we must wrest control of our government, media, and culture from the Leftists puppet-masters who control us and seek to destroy our way of life?</p>

			<p>Australia has a population of just 20 million.                           <br>
                                                                          <br>
Indonesia has 234 million, Vietnam has 85 million, China 1.3 billion&hellip;.  four-fifths of the world&rsquo;s population live in Asia.  </p>
<p>Australia needs to maintain its whiteness through births, or it will swallowed by Asian migrants.</p>

			<p>Can any Australian on this site tell me how many of the 285,000 babies born last year were non-white (aborigine, asian etc). I ask because an Aussie friend of mine works in a Melbourne hospital and he told me that in his hospitals maternity ward white women are the visible minority.<br>
White women in the antipodes not having children could be a cultural or enviromental thing, New Zealand&rsquo;s Prime Minister Helen Clarke is militantly childfree as is Australia&rsquo;s Deputy PM Julie Gilliard (there are both staunch liberals hence want to brainwash others children).    </p>

			<p>While I do agree that any society should take care of it&rsquo;s elderly, I don&rsquo;t think it should be done to the detriment of the new generation. Making sure that one&rsquo;s own people are still around in good numbers is the most important thing any nation can do. Grandma and grandpa will just have to deal with it.</p>

I ask this question all the time: how did the world function before the rise of economists and every other social planner?</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t these people just insist on forced sterilization of whites so white nations can be repopulated with non-whites? That is obviously their goal.</p>

			<p>The sad truth is that many white people prefer having cats and dogs to having children, like many of the women in my office. I doubt its the white Australian thats pushed the nations birth rate to a 25 year high! </p>

			<p>I doubt having a paid maternity leave would significantly reduce the amount of labor performed in that country. With a paid maternity leave the elderly will still receive whatever tax benefits they receive now. Whoever wrote this article seems to be a junior reporter attempting to sound intelligent yet failing miserably in their attempt to do so. </p>

			<p>If (a slight) natural increase of the native population in Australia is a &#8220;drag on the economy&#8221;&hellip;..how is it possible that massive immigration (legal or otherwise) from Third World countries could be such a boom to the economy?</p>

			<p>Most of this little &#8220;baby boom&#8221; in Australia has come about courtesy of the millions of Sudanese, Somalis, Indians, Pakistanis, Filipinos, Bangladeshis and other non-Whites the government has invited in over the past 20 years  &mdash;   the White birth rate is still abysmal, down at about 1.4 or even lower.  Australia has a small base population, so this means the country having a non-White majority soon, not long after the UK, Canada, USA, Russia and Sweden have their own.  </p>
<p>So in fact, Australian Whites have happily heeded this report&rsquo;s suggestions, while others have not.  Population replacement 101.</p>

			<p>We live in the north of Melbourne (a traditional blue collar immigrant freindly area, Broadmeadows our closest large suburb has 25% muslims according to 2006 census).<br>
And we have a 1 and 2 year old and with both births we were the only Anglos in our ward, in fact the only couple who literally didn&rsquo;t require a translator (the nurses were relieved by this fact).<br>
Indians (red dot), Polynesians, Greeks(non-english speaking, around us at least&hellip;even though probably third generation Australians), Turks and Iraqi&rsquo;s.All all of these mothers already had at least 3 kids of their own already visiting along with large multi-child extended families.<br>
I couldn&rsquo;t help but notice that our local high school,ALL the kids have black hair(Arabic mainly).<br>
Some posters say that you have no back bone if you don&rsquo;t stand and fight for your area, but how can you when it&rsquo;s taken 10 years for us to have a Mohamed as a Mayor, Halaal butchers all over, woman hidden under robes everywhere.<br>
Their families are large, united and strong. The kids never pay rent, they move from home to their own home in their late twenties.The only thing they&rsquo;ve spent money on is a hot rod until then.<br>
Mathematically we can&rsquo;t compete(plus some of them are fighting for the right to live in polygommy).<br>
I just want to get my family the hell away from them all.<br>
There is no &#8216;we&rsquo; when it comes to Australian whites, in the country probably but not in the city. <br>
I thought we were meant to be assimulanting them not the other way around. <br>

			<p>Well, since the Australian government, the socialist elites, and big business want whites DEAD, this makes perfect sense. Whites work hard to make their way, and demand respect, and freedom. Third worlders have no such arrogance. They hail from places where there is no right to anything. <br>
Since the hail of foreigners and their offspring will not be stopped, White people will be exterminated, softly.<br>
Figured it all out yet?</p>

If the Australian people continue to do the things they do no doubt more good things will come of it.</p>

<p>Actually, traditional African societies venerate their elderly, far more than we do. We have taken the approach of delegating support for the elderly to the government. This has two big disadvantages:</p>
<p>1. It allows people to claim old-age support even if they refuse to have children. People who have families are unfairly penalized, since their children have to pick up the slack.</p>
<p>2. It sets the elderly apart as a separate class with a sense of entitlement. Vertical ties within a lineage that spans several generations are replaced by horizontal ties among people of the same generation. The elderly become a lobby.</p>
<p>We need to return to the old system of reciprocal support within family lineages. </p>

			<p><i>This is because it will shift women out of the workforce while they care for babies, depressing labour supply and reducing the taxation base as our population ages, the Daily Telegraph reported.</i></p>
<p>In a <a href="https://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1263677258215075609&amp;hl=en-GB" rel="nofollow">fascinating interview that Aaron Russo had with Alex Jones</a>, Russo stated that Nelson Rockefeller had told him that the Rockefeller&rsquo;s support for the feminist movement was primarily so they could tax half the adult population that wasn&rsquo;t being taxed before.  (Yes, I know that Alex Jones promotes a lot of dubious conspiracy theories, but it is the late director Aaron Russo who&rsquo;s doing the talking.)</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve heard this hooey before   &mdash;   white women mustn&rsquo;t have children   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s bad for the environment, interferes with their career development, and lowers the tax base.  Then the next thing you hear is that there&rsquo;s a labor shortage and so millions of third worlders must be brought in, to do the work white people won&rsquo;t do.  Also, we&rsquo;re told that because white women didn&rsquo;t have enough children we need the third worlders to keep the social security Ponzi scheme going.  Third worlders having six kids apiece is never deemed harmful to the environment.</p>
