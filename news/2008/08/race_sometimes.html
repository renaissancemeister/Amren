						<p>In the midst of being raped, Jennifer Thompson-Cannino told herself to pay attention to details that would allow her to identify her attacker.</p>
<p>She was able to give police in North Carolina a description that led to a sketch of the suspect. Then she identified a man from photographs, picked him out of a lineup and told jurors she was certain he was the rapist.</p>
<p>That man, Ronald Cotton, received a life sentence and spent more than 10 years in prison before DNA testing cleared him of the crime.</p>
<p>Now victim and the innocent man she helped convict are writing a book together.</p>
<p>Thompson-Cannino, who is white, had mistakenly picked out one black man; another was guilty of the crime.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Since 1991, 218 people have been exonerated through DNA testing, and in more than three-quarters of the cases, mistaken eyewitness identifications were crucial in the wrongful convictions, according to The Innocence Project, a legal group that has sought genetic testing and led the charge to free innocent inmates.</p>
<p>Of those, nearly half, roughly seven dozen, involved a person of one race wrongly identifying someone of a different color.</p>
<p>Even people with training in law enforcement confront the difficulty of accurate identifications. Boston Police Sgt. Gregory Gallagher, who is white, identified Stephan Cowans, who was black, as the man who shot him twice with Gallagher&rsquo;s own police-issue gun in 1997.</p>
<p>Several years later, testing on a sweat shirt, cap and glass that the suspect wore or touched ruled out Cowans as the shooter. His case was also plagued by misidentification of a fingerprint.</p>
<p>Cowans was released from prison after serving 5 1/2 years. He was found shot to death in his home last year.</p>
<p>The American Bar Association, meeting in New York, is considering whether to recommend that judges use their discretion to make juries aware of the problems that can plague cross-racial identifications.</p>
<p>California, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Utah already employ such instructions in some cases.</p>
<p>&#8220;The majority race is not as good at identifying minorities as it is its own race. This is hard-wired in some way that we don&rsquo;t completely understand. But the phenomenon should be presented to the jury,&#8221; said Barry Scheck, co-founder of The Innocence Project.</p>
<p>Prosecutors, however, do not want judges to raise the issue with juries.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some criminal justice experts believe that mistakes are so pervasive that nothing short of wholesale reforms in identification procedures will fix the problem.</p>
<p>This year, North Carolina became the first state to standardize identification procedures. That includes preventing the police officer who is investigating the crime from conducting photo identifications with witnesses and requiring that lineup photographs be shown one after another rather than in groups of six.</p>

			<p>I think one unmentioned problem is that white crime victims are afraid to tell police that their assailant was non-white, for fear of retribution from the diversity politburo.  I have predicted on this medium that at some point in the near future, whites who report non-white crime will be in more trouble than the non-white criminals they report, for &#8220;bigotry&#8221; and &#8220;discrimination.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Does it matter? Blacks are targeting white women for rape AS A GROUP, not as a matter of individual crime.  This is a type of unconventional warfare, not &#8220;crime&#8221;.  As such, attempting to address individual cases has been a complete failure in stopping this from happening.</p>
<p>Stronger measures are necessary.  Under the circumstances, forced segregation of blacks is what is appropriate and necessary.</p>

			<p>Oh no, just another false reason to let guilty minorities walk!</p>
<p>Because minorities don&rsquo;t have the variety of coloring and features that whites alone possess, such things as height, weight, and descriptions of clothing are often the only things to go by.  Also, duress and fear for life should be counted as part of the equation.</p>
<p>A study performed not too long ago stated that adult eyewitness reports are often unreliable regardless of race of perp and victim.  They found children were far more accurate than adults.<br>

<p>Why not just be honest.  All blacks look alike.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that that it&rsquo;s really only whites and hispanics that are easy to tell apart from one another (at least for myself).  Hispanics usually by their facial features, and whites because well, we&rsquo;re just so varied (hair color, facial features, etc).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like how only asians can tell the difference between one another, you&rsquo;d have to live all your life with the varying types of asians (koreans, chinese, japanese) to tell them apart.  I imagine the same would go for blacks, and when you find a white person insane enough to live among blacks for half his life, let me know.</p>

			<p>Some of us &#8220;evil&#8221; whites can tell a Japanese from a Korean from a Taiwanese rather easily.  Sure; people make mistakes.  I&rsquo;m glad we have DNA testing.  Doing time is bad enough, but when you are totally blameless, it must be hideous.  That shouldn&rsquo;t happen to anyone.  In this case, not only did an innocent man go to prison for ten years, but the real rapist is walking around loose.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t all &#8220;look alike&#8221;, any more than all cats are gray after dark.  Infinite variety.</p>
<p>After I was held up at gunpoint at Subway, I was able to correctly identify our robber from a photo lineup, corroberated from fingerprint matches on our stainless steel countertop.  I described the derringer that had been pointed at me in detail as well.  The police in New Mexico got him first; he&rsquo;s doing seven years for an armed robbery there, and when he gets out, he&rsquo;ll be sent here for more courtroom fun.  His charges will certainly be armed robbery, use of a firearm in the commission of a felony and felony menacing.  Since he marched us at gunpint from one part of the store to another, he can be charged with kidnapping as well (even moving someone from one room to another can and has been successfully prosecuted as abduction).</p>
<p>When he was sentenced, his lawyer had not made arrangements with the state of Colorado to plead guilty here and have the sentences run concurrently, so they&rsquo;ll likely be consecutive.  He may get the Colorado stuff all run concurrently when he is shipped from N.M.  What he did was drive from Albequerque to Denver and back, robbing small restaurants both ways.  He caught us coming back the morning of the second day.</p>

			<p>There is no denying that non-whites are, on casual observance, often almost indistinguishable one from another to us whites. And if you think blacks and asians aren&rsquo;t already enough of a challenge, try it with a crowd of Mestizo Mexicans - they&rsquo;re even all the same height for heavens&rsquo; sake!! </p>

			<p>The media presents this cock and bull story every so often, once again to show us how scary it is to be a &#8220;person of color&#8221;. Oh my gosh, you could be accused of being a perp at anytime by one of those idiotic white people.</p>
<p>Ask ANY cop in a major city in the US. It&rsquo;s the other way around. White generally do better than others in identifying perps no matter the race. Blacks and latinos do not do well, especially when identifying whites (if a white perp is actually involved) and Asians are generally awful at identifying unless they&rsquo;ve lived in the US for many years. </p>

			<p>As a frequent poster on AmRen whose pseudonym most regulars would recognize, I must admit that as a witness to a recent burglary attempt at a neighbor&rsquo;s house, I would not be able to identify the two black suspects I saw prying up and crawling through a window into the house. Luckily, I didn&rsquo;t have to. I called the cops and they busted them red-handed.<br>
How they didn&rsquo;t spot me standing on my porch thirty yards away is beyond me.</p>

			<p>I think it is really difficult to identify nonwhites as individuals because with there fundamentally monochromatic look of being with brown hair and brown eyes makes them as non-diverse as you would think. It is really white people with our wonderful red hair, blonde hair, brown hair and blue eyes, green eyes, hazel eyes and brown eyes that make us have the true reign of diversity.</p>

Blacks used to pretend to be outraged that white people thought they looked alike but they love it and use it to their advantage.</p>
<p>Black boys wearing &#8216;do rags&rsquo; allows them to confuse identifications by witnesses and when removed, they look like a different and unrecognized person.</p>
<p>And remember he Carr brothers? In court they both showed up with completely different hair styles.</p>

			<p>Perhaps this is one reason so many inner-city blacks choose to dress the same, have the same hair &#8220;style&#8221;, walk the same etc.  All in order to confuse white witnesses/victims when they commit crimes.  </p>
<p>Much as I hate to admit it, I sort of agree with anonymous at 6:28.  Blacks have targetting whites (especially white women) as a group.  If the only way whites, as a community, can protect themselves and deter further violations is to stage an occassional lynching of a known criminal thug (even if it&rsquo;s not 100% certain he&rsquo;s the one who committed that particular crime) then so be it.  Desparate times call for desparate measures.  If such actions are some day taken, however, it is extremely important to not target people just because of their race.  Not all blacks are worthless thugs and distinctions should be made.  When a person actively chooses to associate with the criminal subculture.  When he walks, talks, dresses and acts like a criminal - then he should expect to be treated like a criminal. By living that way, he has volunteered to share in the punishment for whatever his cohorts do.  How much more so when they have a policy of no snitching.</p>

			<p>This is what the Innocence Project actually wrote: &#8220;More than <b>one-third</b> of these wrongful convictions were caused by a <b>cross-racial</b> identification.&#8221;  </p>
<p><i>http://www.innocenceproject.org/Content/165.php</i></p>
<p>Yet, this is how the AP put it: &#8220;Of those, <b>nearly half,</b> roughly seven dozen, involved a person of one race wrongly identifying someone of a <b>different color</b>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not only has the AP skewed the numbers (it&rsquo;s actually 38%   &mdash;   closer to the I.P.&rsquo;s one-third), but by using the phrase <b>&#8220;different color&#8221; </b> the AP leaves the reader with the notion that the wrongly convicted individuals were <b>&#8220;persons of color.&#8221;</b> (In fact, <i>many</i> of the freed inmates <i>are</i> white.) In essence, the AP is implying that whites are wrongly identifying blacks. (Because, don&rsquo;t ya know, all whites are such racists they think all blacks look alike?) </p>
<p>But that, of course, is not what the Innocence Project said. Perhaps blacks misidentify whites more than vice versa. Perhaps a black victim will <i>purposefully</i> misidentify a white as the criminal because he doesn&rsquo;t want to admit a fellow black was the immoral cretin who swiped his bling. Who knows? The I.P. isn&rsquo;t saying, because it&rsquo;s simply not germaine to the point they&rsquo;re trying to make about the dangers of relying <i>solely</i> upon eyewitness identification. </p>
<p>What we do know, though, is that the AP is skewing the Innocence Project&rsquo;s statement for it&rsquo;s own anti-white propaganda purposes. Gee, what a surprise.</p>

			<p>If you think this story is bad, there was a similar situation near Charlottesville, Virginia a couple years ago where the white rape victim IDed the wrong black. Only he decided to sue her because of the &#8220;pain and suffering&#8221; he had endured, even though it was an honest mistake. Also, I don&rsquo;t recall him having any anger towards &#8220;da brotha&#8221; that did it, only her.</p>
<p>Moral of the story: Believing that blacks look the same is a greater injustice than rape in our politically correct world.</p>

			<p>Certainly, if DNA evidence was present and collected at various pre-DNA era crime scenes, it shouldn&rsquo;t take years to test these samples now that the technology is readily available.  I disagree with those claiming that, regardless, its acceptable for an innocent black to be punished for a crime that another black may have committed.  This is the same warped logic used by several blacks during the Duke Rape Hoax.  I still remember one black female student in particular who stated that regardless of their innocence, the three accused Duke LaCrosse players should STILL be convicted and sent to prison to atone for past rapes committed by white males against black females.  We all had choice comments regarding her absurd justification, so lets not be hypocritical and claim that its okay when its an innocent black male facing imprisonment for a crime he did not personally commit.  Mistaken identity surely happens from time to time in the legal system.  Therefore, we should all hope that if evidence is produced that exonerates an individual, this person will not spend another second in prison for a crime they didn&rsquo;t commit, regardless of their race.</p>

now today I support those reactions to an even greater extent.<br>
In so many newspapers, no mention is made of the perps. description. Lets you wonder who is committing these home<br>

similar to a cross word puzzle, and about as enlightening.</p>

			<p>It is probable that almost all people wrongly convicted of violent crimes against strangers are in fact violent criminals.  When some shifty black character is charged with a crime, the police and the DA are not surprised and don&rsquo;t scrutinize the evidence as closely as when an honest plumber with one wife and three kids and no drunk driving convictions is accused.  Were ten people to say they saw me rob a bank, the cops would be intrigued about their unusual prisoner, and as a result would investigate more thoroughly.  But were I charged with child molestation, my profile would be a better fit for the crime and their curiosity would not be so engaged.  <br>
     Whenever I see these articles about some guy who spent 15 years in prison for a crime he did not commit, it turns out that he had prior convictions for something else, and no doubt, has gotten away with several other crimes.  <br>
     Again, note that this applies only to persons accused of violence against strangers.  </p>

			<p>I recognized at at young age, that whites are the most diversified in appearance, than any other race.  When I was a child, it was still considered polite and proper to term blacks, &#8220;colored,&#8221; which I thought was all wrong.  Whites are the people with the most color; hair, eyes, skin tone, rudiness or lack of, etc., etc.  None of it has ever made sense to me.</p>

All she could do in the dark was identify the race, and other qualifications like clothing that are most common among black men.  This is not being racist, although I think being racist might have spared her the experience - (she might have planned her day differently or lived somewhere else).  No, she just didn&rsquo;t have enough info to tag the exact black who raped her. </p>
<p>Now, she is doing her pentence by writing a book about it with the black she mistook for her rapist.  She hasn&rsquo;t learned anything from her experience but to grovel further and continue being a victim of the black man.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a problem only with whites, I think it&rsquo;s a problem with any race trying to identify another. I&rsquo;m black, and I have a very hard time recognizing non-blacks, whether they are white, hispanic, asian, or middle eastern. I walk around campus all the time and have white people that I&rsquo;ve had conversations with speak to me and I have to stare at their face and think very hard to match that face with the person I was talking to earlier, but with black people there is instant recollection. I even recognize black people that I&rsquo;ve never talked to. That&rsquo;s just how it is, know one knows why but people just have trouble identifying people of other races, maybe it&rsquo;s because we don&rsquo;t spend enough time around them.</p>

			<p>I am Pakistani. I find South Asians the most diverse in facial features followed by Arabs, Europeans, S.E Asians, North East Asians like Chinese. But blacks look identical to me also. I worked in a British supermarket(TESCO) and frequently I mixed up black customers. I never had this problem with Asians and Europeans. Even though there are significant genetic differences between Pakistanis and Englishmen, Africans are the most different from us both.</p>

			<p>Faulty eyewitness testimony has nothing to do with racism. Victims commonly misidentify people for a variety of reasons. In a college class, the instructor asked us to describe a visitor immediately after he&rsquo;d left. The descriptions were wildly different. Weight, age, race, height, you name it, we had 30 wildly different descriptions of the person.</p>

			<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, the great majority of the population of the earth is black hair, brown eyes, brown to black skin- all the same. This is the future for our people if we stop having children and keep race mixing.</p>

			<p>I had a Rhodesian step father who (claimed) he could indentify down to the tribe which part of Africa, Africans came from.<br>
Even multi-generational African American&rsquo;s.<br>
It was a cool trick.<br>
To me the differences were too subtle, until pointed out at least.<br>
Mixed race blacks always look Arabic or Porto Rican to me.</p>
