<h1>Population Grows at Rapid Rate Across Region</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andy Johns, Chattanooga Times Free Press, August 7, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The latest demographic estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau show the Hispanic population in the tri-state region is growing almost 12 times faster than other groups.</p>
<p>According to 2007 population estimates released this morning, the Hispanic population of Hamilton County and the surrounding 20 counties has grown almost 60 percent since 2000, compared to 5 percent growth in non-Hispanic groups.</p>
<p>Gordon and Murray counties in Georgia lead the region, with Hispanic populations surging 131 percent in Murray and 116 percent in Gordon, census figures show. The Hispanic population has grown 86 percent in DeKalb County, Ala., and 80 percent in Georgia&rsquo;s Catoosa County.</p>
<p>Hamilton County saw its Hispanic population grown 73 percent, figures show, while Bradley County&rsquo;s grew 72 percent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mexicans and Guatemalans make up the bulk of Hispanic immigrants in the Southeast, with sizable populations of other Central American nations and a relatively small number of South Americans, said Dr. Douglas C. Bachtel, a demographer with the University of Georgia. The immigrants leave their homelands in search of higher wages and more job opportunities, he said.</p>
<p>In addition to the jobs Ms. Jones mentioned, Dr. Bachtel said many immigrants find work in the retail industry as maids or waiters. Dalton, Ga., in particular, has many Hispanic immigrants who work at carpet mills, he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t have those jobs, you aren&rsquo;t necessarily going to get Hispanics,&rdquo; Dr. Bachtel said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ms. Jones said she had heard some estimates as high as 15,000 Hispanics in the Chattanooga metro area &mdash; about 50 percent more than the Census Bureau&rsquo;s estimate of nearly 9,600.</p>
<p>School enrollment figures often give a better idea about an area&rsquo;s population and in Hamilton County shows significant Hispanic growth, as well, Dr. Bachtel said.</p>
<p>In the 2006-2007 school year, 1,757 Hispanic students were enrolled in Hamilton County, making up 4.1 percent of the total student body, school figures show. School administrators estimate the number grew to about 5 percent during the 2007-2008 school year.</p>
<p>Those numbers indicate a sharp growth from the 1999-2000 school year when there were 429 Hispanic students &mdash; 1 percent of the total &mdash; enrolled in county schools, and even larger growth compared to 1995-1996 statistics, when Hispanics made up 0.6 percent of the system&rsquo;s students.</p>
<p>Similarly, Erlanger Health System has seen an increasing number of Hispanic patients, officials said. The hospital system admitted 4,168 Hispanic patients between October 2001 and September 2002, compared to 7,302 in the same period of 2006 and 2007, according to Erlanger spokeswoman Pat Charles.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other organizations and institutions are addressing the Hispanic growth as well, according to Ms. Jones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nearly everywhere you go the signs are bilingual,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more visible than it was five years ago.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>As I&rsquo;ve pointed out in other places so often, what is it with States like Tennessee? I&rsquo;ve met people who have come to California, true it was about 15years ago, who have said that they left Tennessee because it was a job depressed State. What&rsquo;s the deal here?</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s all those fertile 14 year old Hispanic girls having babies and don&rsquo;t stop till they have 5 or 7 or more. They have no ambition to get an education, they know they and their &#8216;keeds&rsquo; will get subsizided housing, food stamps, free medical and welfare and anything else their little hearts desire, courtesy of Good Ol&rsquo; Uncle Sam, so why should they bother doing anything else but work for the Raza by squirting out as many babies as possible.</p>

			<p>Just as well cede to Mexico now. How stupid are White people? This is going on all over the world. Are we that incompetent to even keep our own nations?  Are we that selfish and cowardly to hand this hellhole we allowed, over to our own children?  Why won&rsquo;t Whites DO something? Are they waiting for God to do it for them? They are sadly mistaken if they think the &#8220;rapture&#8221; is going to come and save them. I blame what Christianity has become. PC!!! Save all the other races but their own, seems to be the message that these so-called churches have been preaching for the last 100 or so years. Then they have the nerve to bring these people into OUR nation with their smiling faces and fattened wallets.</p>

<p>Actually, what has happened here is typical of what happens with any idea, especially ones that seem perfect at the moment. And even when they reveal themselves to be less than perfect, the imperfections are either ignored or explained away. And if they keep coming back then the people who keep pointing them out and asking for solutions are routinely demonized until the matter becomes a lost cause. Of course, they&rsquo;ll keep a few &#8220;trouble makers&#8221; around so they can serve as a warning to anyone thinking of standing up to the Status Quo. &#8220;If you defy us you&rsquo;ll wind up outcast, like these &#8220;freaks&#8221;.&#8221;</p>
<p>But it applies to all ideas. Like the Car, for example. No one at the time knew it would cause so many problems at that those problems would be so widespread.<br>
The point is - all ideas, ALL ideas, ALWAYS generate more data than the Theory that created them can manage. So, instead of modifying the Theory to accomodate the Data, we ignore the Data and preserve the Theory.</p>
<p>And the results?</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;re living with them now.</p>

			<p>Well if we can&rsquo;t beat them, then join them.  I don&rsquo;t care what color a person is as long as they can do the job I hired them to do.  About 90% of my employees are Hipanic because the lazy Whites in our town are to lazy work hard.  I pay well and even offer benfits.  I own a construction company and I have trouble keeping my White employees.  I have even paid the Whites more and they still don&rsquo;t want to work.  Does anyone have any suggestions?</p>

			<p>I have observed the PC culture for quite a while and I have concluded that the reason the &#8220;white population&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t do much about the displacement of the natives by the immigrants is because to complain, much less to actively oppose, displacement is to oppose the monolithic power of the corporations, to challenge them. Anyone who has worked for a major corporation knows the tyrannical nature of these organizations. They are totally undemocratic and completely opposed to any nativist expression for the simple reason that such expression would be empowering to the employee. And of course because frightened illegals shut up and work, thank you very much. <br>
Joseph Stalin, were he to tone it down just a little bit, would make a great HR administrator today. Affirmative action is a variant of Communist thinking. Promote the &#8220;worthy&#8221;, punish the deviant. That&rsquo;s you, whitey. Keep your cracker jokes to yourself, and all smoking is to be done outside. And yes, Kwanzaa is a holiday equivalent to Christmas.<br>
 At the national level we will never see discussion, much less change, of these policies because the &#8220;little guy&#8221; must be shut out of the process to keep the little guy aware of, well, his littleness. </p>

			<p>Don&rsquo;t tell me&hellip; let me guess!  I&rsquo;ll place bets that the CRIME RATE climbed, commensurate with the increase in Hispanics. Right? Not that the liberal pro-immigration media will ever concede THAT part of the immigration picture.</p>

<p>Sorry, John, no answers here.  It appears that the Marxist doctrine aka civil rights has eaten away at the work ethic of Americans&hellip;..  if there isn&rsquo;t a huge windfall behind the job, they&rsquo;d prefer to get government assistance.  It&rsquo;s not just a minority problem anymore.<br>

			<p>   To John.  I don&rsquo;t care if you can&rsquo;t get any Americans to work for you. Than you should get out of the business. Anyone who hires an illegal Hispanic in these times is a low-down skunk.</p>

			<p>If Tennessee is so job-depressed that the Whites have been taking off for 15 years now, why in the heck does it need to import hordes of illegal Hispanics to do the nonexistent jobs? None of this makes sense.</p>
<p>Mark, they are afraid of being called racist. Here in California, any expression of White racial sentiment, not to mention one word of displeasure about Hispanics or illegal aliens, quickly gives one looks of &#8220;you are talking about things you are not supposed to talk about&#8221;. That&rsquo;s if you are lucky. If you are unlucky, you will be called racist, often in gang attacks, shouted down, often in public. If you work, your job is in jeopardy if you say any such thing that can be remotely construed as racist. This is the way it is a very rightwing all-White town! As towns get taken over by illegals and Hispanics (same thing) it gets worse and worse. The remaining Whites have no racial sentiments whatsoever, develop all sorts of Blacks and Hispanic friends and even lovers wives, and White racial sentiment at this point is even more policed. Now you are at risk of getting thrown out of establishments, challenged to fights by Hispanics, etc. The remaining Whites, dregs though they are, are stripped of any remaining racial sentiment due to sheer terror.</p>
<p>&#8220;Racist&#8221; is the last thing any White wants to be called these days. They run in terror from the word.<br>

<p>Here&rsquo;s suggestion for you pal. Cover the name and/or logo of your company wherever it appears   &mdash;   on your vehicles, on your work clothes, wherever. My mission in life is to bust anyone who hires Mexican aliens. Trust me, I&rsquo;ve made &#8220;the call.&#8221; I live in Chattanooga and my job is closely related to what you do. I am around construction crews and manufacturing plants every single day and to date I see a portion of the work crews are still European Americans. In fact many places refuse to hire Mexicans simply because they&rsquo;re Mexicans!! </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say the white people you can&rsquo;t keep don&rsquo;t like working alongside your swarthy stoop laborers. Watch your back because I&rsquo;m watching people like you. ICE. You know them, right?<br>

			<p>The irony of all this is that Chattanooga is the boyhood home of the late Sam Francis, a true patriot.  If Sam were alive and could see what&rsquo;s become of his native city he would be so disgusted he&rsquo;d&hellip;write an editorial.</p>
