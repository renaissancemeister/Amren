<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>In an interview with The Washington Post&rsquo;s editorial board, Sen. Joe Biden (D-Del.) asserted that he is more prepared to be president than any other candidate, disputed the notion that governors are better suited for the White House than senators and warned that Pakistan is a potentially bigger threat than Iran.</p>
<p>Biden also stumbled through a discourse on race and education, leaving the impression that he believes one reason that so many District of Columbia schools fail is the city&rsquo;s high minority population. His campaign quickly issued a statement saying he meant to indicate that the disadvantages were based on economic status, not race.</p>
<p>After a lengthy critique of Bush administration education policies, Biden attempted to explain why some schools perform better than others &mdash; in Iowa, for instance, compared with the District. &#8220;There&rsquo;s less than 1 percent of the population of Iowa that is African American. There is probably less than 4 or 5 percent that are minorities. What is in Washington? So look, it goes back to what you start off with, what you&rsquo;re dealing with,&#8221; Biden said. He went on to discuss the importance of parental involvement in reading to children and how &#8220;half this education gap exists before the kid steps foot in the classroom.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Biden campaign moved quickly to clarify the senator&rsquo;s remarks in a statement: &#8220;This was not a race-based distinction, but a discussion of the problems kids face who don&rsquo;t have the same socio-economic support system (and all that implies &mdash; nutrition, pre K, etc.) entering grade school and the impact of those disadvantages on outcomes.&#8221;</p>

			<p>It are politicians like Biden that rile me the most.  They know the truth about race, but then spend their whole careers voting the other way.  I can respect a liberal who talks liberal and votes liberal, over a political harlot like Biden.</p>

			<p>  Oh, man, that&rsquo;s rich. I&rsquo;m surprised the NAACP isn&rsquo;t demanding an apology. How is this different from what J. Alvin Wilbanks said? </p>
<p><a href="/news/2008/08/no_apology_from.html" rel="nofollow">/news/2008/08/no_apology_from.php</a></p>
<p>  Geez,Biden even went into more detail than Wilbanks, who, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, was only saying that there were too few black students in Idaho to be fairly compared to those in other cities, making no reference to their performance. <br>
  The upside to this &#8220;no child left behind&#8221; hoo-hah is that, hopefully, people are going to be forced to start discussing the racial &#8220;achievement&#8221; gap in something approaching realistic terms. As it stands, it&rsquo;s like being asked to talk about broken legs but not being allowed to use the words &#8220;bones&#8221; or &#8220;fractures&#8221;, to paraphrase Michael Levin.</p>

			<p>This goes to show what I have told many of my conservative friends before. Liberals know the truth about race. Why do you think the majority of liberals choose to live apart from Blacks and Hispanics? Many of the seemingly absurd policies that liberals implement is just the way liberals dance around this issue. Politically, there aren&rsquo;t many options in dealing with Black and Hispanic underachievement. Imagine the uproar if any politician, liberal or conservative, just came out and said the truth about the intellectual inferiority of these groups. Instead, liberals and even so called conservarives, keep spouting the mantra that diversity is our strength. </p>

			<p>&ldquo;half this education gap exists before the kid steps foot in the classroom.&rdquo;<br>
your right Joe, the gap exists even earlier than you think, about 100,000 years ago in fact</p>

			<p>Yes, oh, yes, of course.  The achievement gap is due to socio-economics, not eating breakfast, not enough pre-K, slavery 150 years ago, white oppression that outrageously commits injustices against blacks, especially black males, anything, just anything, but please&hellip;..don&rsquo;t breathe a word about the proven difference in intelligence.  Please&hellip;.please&hellip;.don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>And also stay mum that there&rsquo;s an achievement gap between blacks and everybody else, not just whites, but&hellip;look&hellip;.let&rsquo;s just pretend.  Let&rsquo;s pretend, by not mentioning, that poor, non-black, malnurioushed kids come to this country, unable to speak the language, some very much abused, yet they accelerate past blacks academically as if they were standing still.  </p>
<p>Remember our leftist motto:  &#8220;Keep it quiet or they will riot.&#8221;  That was given to us by the greatest poet of all times, Jesse.  He just loves rhymes.  But not as much as he loves extorting via threats of boycotts or riots.</p>
<p>Now, if you&rsquo;ve grasped the tactic so far, then remember it&rsquo;s o.k. to denigrate whites.  In fact it is expected of you.  It is encouraged.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the most important poetic quote of all:  &#8220;If it&rsquo;s white, it just ain&rsquo;t right.&#8221;</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re probably right, but PC does have a powerful quality it shares with religions: appeal to individuals&rsquo; feelings of virtue. The current notion of virtue is that it resides in treating members of all races as being the same, and it is very difficult to replace that notion with the idea  that virtue resides in recognizing racial differences and protecting one&rsquo;s own self, family and race.</p>

<p>You are right.  And what is more - I have come to think that Liberal Whites do all that race pandering less out of guilt and more out of pure cowardice.  Tandem with not wishing to deal with ugly issues, they are taking the easy way out by folding on every issue where race is concerned.  They gave crumbs at first to a pig that grew into one of gigantic size with huge demands.  Every single complaint and demand, no matter how far fetched or petty is entertained and indulged by the White Liberal.  Of course, this has a counterpart among conservatives too, but it is rampant in among Liberal/Progressives simply because they have practiced it longer.  It reminds me of several White girls I knew when I was young.  When they were pressured by Blacks for dates, they figured it was easier to get through a date and not be thought a racist.  But the date they went on - each of them, turned out to be one to remember.  Once you date a Black, he always comes back.  They don&rsquo;t like being rejected.  In one case, the Black guy stalked the girl for a year - it was decades before anti-stalking laws.  I mean, he would call her up at all hours and threaten her.  Those three were strong, many others I have known of weren&rsquo;t.  Many of us Whites have acted just like those girls and gone on the date - and things have just become worse and worse until we are nearly overwhelmed with the culture all that cowardice has allowed to grow.  It was on parade tonight on tv via the DNC.<br>

<p>Posted by jewamongyou at 9:30 PM on August 27 &#8220;</p>
<p>&#8216;They&rsquo; are playing this game and will continue to do so, because it&rsquo;s tied into their desire to promote race mixing between white blonde haired, blue-eyed women and black males.  It&rsquo;s a critical component of their genocide program for the white race - although I will confess that I am literally amazed by the unbelievablely large (and apparently increasing) percentage of whites (women in particular) who appear to be accepting this idea that there are no substantial genetic differences between whites and blacks and therefore race mixing isn&rsquo;t the racially destructive lifestyle choice that it most certainly is. </p>
<p>Whites are supposed to be reasonably intelligent. So, why is it that so many whites seem to be unable to see through this deliberate program to encourage them to commit auto-genocide?  </p>
<p>I mean, come on, fellow white racial brothers and sisters!  Do we really need to read 10 or 15 lengthy and boring books on genetics and racial differences (which I went to the trouble of doing) to see the obvious?</p>

			<p>The most likely reason for Biden&rsquo;s &#8220;mistakes&#8221; is that he was not at the time drunk.  Had he been drunk as his good friend Senator Kennedy is most of the time, I am sure that his sense of political correctness would have been much more refined.  He really should know better after spending his entire adult life as a Senator, making burdensome laws for those of us who actually work and upholding all the tenants of the ideology of &#8220;diversity:.</p>
<p>The image of Obama and Biden together as president and vice president is too horrible to imagine for more than a moment.  A poster has suggested that Biden would function as Obama&rsquo;s man servant.  That was a very perceptive image to evoke.  Obama has spent his life absorbing the African American ideology of victimization but he combines that with the another ideology of victimhood, viz. the anti-colonial (anti-British) outlook of his father, Barack Senior, who drunk himself into his grave (I believe that Scotch was his favorite drink) before the age of 50.</p>
<p>  There is no doubt that Obama sees having a white vice president as a living retribution against whites who once colonized his true homeland, Kenya.  He must be relishing the thought of getting back at whitey in this manner.</p>
<p>The only remaining question is whether there are enough white fools who will vote for his ticket.  As the presidential race narrows, and more and more details come out about Obama, an extreme anti-white racist and a completely unvetted candidate, I believe that more and more whites will realize what an Obama presidency would mean, viz. more and greater large scale pandering to American blacks, more governmental intrusion into the lives of Americans, more failed &#8220;Great Society&#8221; programs, massive hand outs to black African nations, especially Kenya, and a hopelessly confused foreign policy abroad and socialism at home.</p>
<p>Thusfar Obama has been given a pass by the MSM.  In the coming days this is less likely to be the case, not because the MSM does not still desire to give Obama a pass but because other news outlets will force them to become more critical.  If the stupid party were to attack Obama by simply showing him to be what he is, a radical socialist, a lier, an individual with very divided loyalties, someone who would like to remove the 2nd amendment from the constitution, someone who has a visceral hatred of the military and would seek to destroy it, someone who also has a visceral hatred of whites, including his own white blood, and believes in the anti-white hatred expressed in the  liberation black theology of his religious mentor, they could easily destroy any chances of Obama&rsquo;s becoming president.  Will they do it?  That is the same as asking just how stupid the stupid party really is.  We will shortly have a definitive answer.</p>

			<p> Biden, like him or not (and I don&rsquo;t) is truly a character  &mdash;  one more reason this is the most interesting, or better yet, entertaining election I&rsquo;ve ever seen, especially considering how much both major tickets stink to high heaven. &#8220;Not a dime&rsquo;s worth of difference&#8221;, as George Wallace said long ago.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m a little surprised that, if I&rsquo;m not mistaken, no comments above mentioned the similar and even funnier episode from earlier in the campaign: remember when Loco Joe decided to relay his mom&rsquo;s comments on BHO?: &#8220;bright! clean! articulate!&#8221;  &mdash;  those were his exact words, and presumably hers too. I think it was utterly clear that Mrs. B was expressing real surprise  &mdash;  and Loco Joe sure sounded to me like he felt the same way. </p>
<p>To spell it out, they acted pleasantly surprised that a &#8220;black&#8221; man could be any or all of those things. Think about that. </p>
<p>My only recollection of the aftermath was a deafening silence from the racial-grievance Establishment and the Duh-versity boosters. I think we all know why  &mdash;  he&rsquo;s still one of their &#8220;good guys&#8221;, even hopping around with his foot in his mouth. And now he&rsquo;s a contender.</p>
<p>As an aside, I heard an interesting comment from some pundit this morning about his getting Obama&rsquo;s veep slot: in one swift move, Obama has written off the South, and he knows it. In that sense, I think one could say he&rsquo;s flipped-off the South.</p>
<p>I want to elaborate a bit on that point  &mdash;  BHO&rsquo;s subtle rebuff to &#8220;rednecks&#8221;. I frankly see Loco Joe as a damned Yankee in VRS mode  &mdash;  &#8220;vigorously reinforcing stereotypes&#8221;  &mdash;  in this case, that of the loud, rude, and especially arrogant know-it-all from the NE US; in short, the obnoxious Yankee, and all the more so because they frequently move to my area to escape the mess that their kind have made in their home states.</p>
<p>But I also realize Joe&rsquo;s type is probably innocent in a certain way  &mdash;  certainly his mom, having lived a life of relative privilege away from non-whites, is probably utterly naive about them. I figure that after some long-ago formative experiences and messages, subtle or not, from her elders, she &#8220;knew all she needed to know&#8221; until recent history forced them back into her consciousness. Having never needed to dance around what she knew, she spoke her true feelings.</p>
<p>Joe&rsquo;s case is only slightly more complicated. I have no doubt that he, like arrogant Yankees in general of his era, had no realistic experience of duh-versity  &mdash;  none. I have no doubt he would say, vehemently he did too!  &mdash;  but it&rsquo;s based on limited contact with minorities  &mdash;  probably very decent people  &mdash;  &#8220;acting white&#8221;. I don&rsquo;t think for a second that, for example, he ever attended a school where he would avoid certain restrooms because of an influx of &#8220;students&#8221; who didn&rsquo;t look like him.</p>
<p>In other words, he is, on the surface, clueless  &mdash;  and I mean egregiously, hilariously clueless. But at some deeper level, I think he knows it. His duh-versity-loving ideological buddies, such as Ted Kennedy, have managed to expose all the US  &mdash;  even our &#8220;elites&#8221;  &mdash;  to sufficient duh-versity that he subconsciously now is finally starting to catch on. But he&rsquo;s bought into the Narrative, and his whole career and life depend on it.</p>
<p>The result? Cognitive dissonance that manifests itself as in this article, in his erratic, dysfunctional, election-poisoning gaffes. I think his ticket will lose, and he profoundly deserves it. I can only hope it shuts him up, if only for a while. And to the voters who&rsquo;ve sent him to Washington for too many years, I won&rsquo;t speak here, out of respect for the civility of this forum.</p>
<p>But I bet that cognitive dissonance makes Biden&rsquo;s brain hurt. I sure hope so.</p>
<p>(Also: Poster 8:36 above who says we will shortly know &#8220;how stupid the Stupid Party really is&#8221;: well spoken!)</p>

			<p>The obama clan is a lot smarter than you think.Biden is their token white guy.It&rsquo;s all carefully planned as to fool us.Obama can now throw his arm around him and say &#8220;see folks,I love white people&#8221; and the idiot left can all join hands and sing coom-byah.I don&rsquo;t understand how anyone can&rsquo;t see how obvious this is.Obamas&rsquo; handlers are as slick as they come.Watch out America,a storm is coming.How did that song go?&hellip;.Teach your children well.</p>

			<p>Like it or not, failure, dysfunctionality, propensity for crime IS a race issue. Always will be. Given that minorities, Blacks and Hispanics, commit the great MAJORITY of crime in America.</p>
<p>With Mexicans, it&rsquo;s a cultural thing. Mexico probably being the most corrupt, most crime-ridden country in the Western Hemisphere. With Blacks, a genetic failing. Look at Africa for corroboration and proof of that claim.</p>

			<p>I think, that with many liberals, it is as sort of a &#8220;The Emperor&rsquo;s New Clothes&#8221; situation. A lot of them are afraid of blacks, or have some idea that race exists, but they don&rsquo;t mention it for fear of what the other liberals will think. Meanwhile, many of the other liberals are having the same thoughts.</p>
