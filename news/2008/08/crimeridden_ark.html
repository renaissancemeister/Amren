						<p>Officers armed with military rifles have been stopping and questioning passers-by in a neighborhood plagued by violence that&rsquo;s been under a 24-hour curfew for a week.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Helena-West Helena City Council voted 9-0 to allow police to expand that program into any area of the city, despite a warning from a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas that the police stops were unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Police Chief Fred Fielder said the patrols have netted 32 arrests since they began last week in a 10-block neighborhood in this small town on the banks of the Mississippi River long troubled by poverty. The council said those living in the city want the random shootings and drug-fueled violence to stop, no matter what the cost.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The area under curfew, in what used to be a West Helena neighborhood, sits among abandoned homes and occupied residences in disrepair.</p>
<p>White signs on large blue barrels warn those passing by that the area remains under curfew by order of Mayor James Valley. The order was scheduled to end at 3 p.m. Tuesday, but Valley said the city council&rsquo;s vote would allow police to have the same powers across Helena-West Helena.</p>
<p>Among the curfew operation&rsquo;s arrests, 10 came from felony charges, including the arrest of two people carrying both drugs and weapons, Fielder said. The police chief said the officers in the field carry military-style M-16 or M-4 rifles, some equipped with laser sights. Other officers carry short-barrel shotguns. Many dealing crack cocaine and marijuana in the city carry pistols and AK-47 assault rifles, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The curfew is the second under the mayor&rsquo;s watch since the rival cities of Helena and West Helena merged in 2006. That year, Valley set a nightly citywide curfew after a rash of burglaries and other thefts.</p>
<p>Police in Hartford, Conn., began enforcing a nightly curfew for youths after recent violence, including a weekend shooting that killed a man and wounded six young people.</p>
<p>Helena-West Helena, with 15,000 residents at the edge of Arkansas&rsquo; eastern rice fields and farmland, is in one of the nation&rsquo;s poorest regions, trailing even parts of Appalachia in its standard of living.</p>

			<p>Notice they&rsquo;re covering up the racial aspect.  Parts of Helena and West Helena, Arkansas have essentially become prisons.  Since half of black men wind up being convicted of a felony, it&rsquo;s almost apropos.  </p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me to find out that the city governments are black.  This &#8220;house arrest&#8221; is similar to the &#8220;Jim Crow&#8221; system that the black civil rights movement wanted us to get rid of, but blacks in power over other blacks wind up re-implementing a lot of it by themselves.  Nobody knows them better than they themselves.</p>

			<p>In these days of the internet, the mainstream media&rsquo;s effort to hide unsavory facts about black crime is doomed to futility.  The Wiki article on Helena-West Helena reports that blacks are 66.63% of its population.  With 2 out of 3 residents black, I don&rsquo;t doubt for a minute that they have a violent crime problem there.</p>

No mention of WHO is causing the trouble. </p>
<p>But it turns out Wikipedia is good for something after all. A 30-second visit gives us the demographic goods on Helena/West Helena that was apparently beyond the investigative abilities of the entire Associated Press. </p>
<p>Not that it will surprise anybody, but for the record, THESE are the people who require a 24-hour curfew to make them stop killing each other: </p>
<p><br>
Based on U.S. Census reports for both cities prior to the merger, the 2000 population of the area comprising Helena-West Helena was 15,012. There were 5,516 households, and 3,765 families residing in the city. The racial makeup of the city was 31.85% White, 66.63% African American, 0.19% Native American, 0.47% Asian, 0.01% Pacific Islander, 0.27% from other races, and 0.58% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.89% of the population.</p>
<p><br>
FUN FACTOID: Wiki also reveals that the county within northern Arkansas in which Helena/West Helena resides is called &#8220;Police State&#8221;! <br>

			<p>Blacks comprise 67% of the population of Helena/West Helen, and whites 32%.</p>
<p>Although the overall poverty rate is greater in Appalachia, the crime problem is just a small fraction of Helena/West Helena.  I wonder if it&rsquo;s because Appalachia is almost all white and the Arkansa town is majority black?</p>
<p>If the multicults are using poverty as an excuse for incredibly high black crime figures everywhere, I wonder how they can square the fact that equally poor white areas have far less crime?</p>
<p>And I wonder how these same leftist radicals can explain why blacks the world over have high crime rates, and why they have a high percentage of people in prisons in every Western nation  relative to their share of the population?</p>
<p>And I wonder if these same people can tell us why the Chinese refused to serve blacks at certain establishments during the Olympics, and why they maintain blacks are trouble-makers and prone to drugs and crime?</p>
<p>And, I wonder if the multicults can understand that they come across as drooling idiots by trying to maintain that blacks&rsquo; crime and misbehavior are the result of racism and oppression?</p>
<p>Obviously they can&rsquo;t understand something that is so evident and so simple, because they continue to make the same laughable excuses.</p>

<p>Yes, this is one area where the Founders failed.  It is clear to the best scholarly interpreters that &#8220;equal under the law&#8221; was what was intended, because it is also self-evident that no one is created equal to any other.  The Founding Fathers were intelligent enough to understand the clearly understood qualifier, never imagining how their written word would become a tool for political dishonesty and social parasitism.</p>

			<p>How did you know the mayor was black?? I assume it was a good guess.</p>
<p>and look at this article, the mayor, James Valley, shut down his town&rsquo;s animal shelter and set all the dogs loose in the forest. </p>
<p>What irony, he gives freedom to dogs, and takes freedom away from residents<br>

<p>That is NOT what they implied. Here is the background on this little misunderstood phrase: &#8220;All men are created equal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Was directed at the white slaves (yes white slaves not indentured ones either) because General Washington was recruiting young white men to form the Continental Army! General Washington promised the white slaves their freedom and a plot of land for farming in exchange for their service. </p>
<p>Learn the horrible true of white slavery in this country. You have been LIED TOO. <br>
Link: https://www.epado.bravehost.com/whiteslaves00.htm</p>
<p>The Naturalization Act of 1790 limits the right of become a naturalized citizen to &#8220;free WHITE persons,&#8221; thereby excluding Africans and Asians. US government takes the first steps toward closing its open attitudes about immigrants by limiting those who could become naturalized citizens on the basis of race and political affiliation. Law remained for 162 years.</p>
<p>Changes the whole concept of &#8220;All men are created equal&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the US Constitution blacks where considered 1/3 that of a white man and therefore not considered equal. Until the 14th Amendment was issued, which considered all individual &ldquo;equal under the law&rdquo;</p>

I believe Jefferson was thinking of and referring to white men in white nations. His comments were political in nature; that all white men born equal and free shouldn&rsquo;t be subjugated by tyrants who believe themselves superior or better.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe Jefferson was referring to &#8216;equal&rsquo; in the PC accepted definition we have today and I don&rsquo;t believe he believed blacks were his equal.</p>

			<p>Helena/West Helena was originally 2 towns that incorporated a couple years back during the school consolidation upheavels statewide.  Lots of cotton, soybean fields, waves of mosquitos and swarms of blacks.  The majority of the city council is black and votes are always in their favor. Mayor Valley (black) recently had a problem with too many stray dogs.  He had them rounded up, taken to a national forest and released.  Kind of like relocating white-tailed deer in another state.  Didn&rsquo;t occur to him that it might not be so easy for a domestic dog to survive. True story.<br>

			<p>Concerning the constitution as to all men being created equal.. I think it likely that the issue here was that all men are born equaly human, equaly sovereign and have equal rights to pursue their own destiny without hindrance from others. As well, founding a republic required severing from divine right of kings or monarchal inheritance. The idea that the wording of equality in the constitution could be used to signify that all men and races are constituted with equal refinement, talent or ability would have been scoffed at.Even 90 years later the great emancipater himself(Lincoln)did not believe that the black man was the equal of the white man or that they be placed on equal social footing with the white man.</p>

Begging your pardon, Sir or Ma&rsquo;am. I misread Wiki&rsquo;s map.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also like to amend the &#8220;Fun Factoid&#8221; is my previous post: As of last night, Wiki ID&rsquo;d Helena&rsquo;s county as &#8220;Police State&#8221; but this was apparently just vandalism   &mdash;   perhaps by one of the chocolate city&rsquo;s majority residents upset with having his freedom to fire his AK-47 at will temporarily compromised by a curfew. The county&rsquo;s correct name is Phillips. <br>

			<p>Have a (White) friend that lives on the outskirts of the White side of Helena. She says she is safe, but the whole area is very tense. Arkansas is an open-carry state, and she doesn&rsquo;t even go out into her garden or front yard without  her pistol. Needless to say she and her husband are trying to relocate. Nobody is buying in that area because of the troubles. </p>

<p>I think that this is a very good and concise analysis of the historical context that motiviated Jefferson&rsquo;s idea.  After all, it had been the historical situation in Europe for centuries as royalty and then nobles thought of themselves as better by an act of God.  And it would have been a glaring mistake in his intelligent eyes if he actually thought that his black slaves were his equals.</p>
