<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>In what appears to be a mass defacement, where several hundred domains take advantage of a shared hosting provider,Net Devilz Netherlands starting as of this Friday, an Islamic hacker known as nEt^DeViL &mdash; this is not the NetDevilz team that hijacked the DNS records of the ICANN and Photobucket in June &mdash; managed to successfully hack a couple of hundred Dutch web sites as a hacktivist response to the release of the Fitna film, a controversial film released by Geert Wilders, a member of the Dutch parliament in March, 2008.</p>
<p>How did they do it? Since all of the sites are parked on a single IP (81.4.97.190) owned by the Geenpunt.nl hosting company, compromising it means having the ability to compromise the content on all the domains hosted there, which is exactly what happened in this case.</p>
<p>The message they left is still active at most of the sites :</p>
<p>&#8220;Anti-Fitna (  Response to the Fitna Movie by &lsquo;Geert Wilders&rsquo; Cow ! ) This hax0ring is to defend ISLAM &mdash; The Religion of [ Abraham, Moses, Jesus &amp; Muhammad ( Peace Be Upon Them All ) ] that Insulted by a Cow ! from Netherlands ! Show Some Respect ! so, I can Leave you in Peace ! [ You&rsquo;ve Started it ! ], I don&rsquo;t have problems with your site but, that what Geert Wilders Cow! chose for you ;) If you think that &#8221; Insulting GOD Religion is a Freedom of  Speech as your country did, then allow me to show you my Freedom knowledge of  Hacking ;)&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Naturally, this isn&rsquo;t the first time Islamic hacking groups attacked web sites belonging to a particular country that somehow offended their beliefs. For instance, in 2006, the same mass defacements took place on over 600 Danish web sites in response to the Mohammed&rsquo;s cartoons released in local newspapers. This hacktivist approach of spreading propaganda isn&rsquo;t necessarily a full-scale cyber war, it&rsquo;s an example of information warfare aiming to reach as many Dutch Internet users as possible due to the apparently insecure web hosting provider that they are all using.</p>
<p>Pure hacktivism isn&rsquo;t dead, as compared to previous web site defacement analysis where the people behind them were hacktivismmultitasking by also hosting malware, phishing and blackhat SEO junk pages on the compromised servers, in this case they only defaced the main pages. However, what pure hacktivism turned into today, consciously of subconsciously, is the propaganda division of an information warfare unit, where given the hundreds of thousands of easily detectable insecure sites within a particular country&rsquo;s Web, this political propaganda can easily turn into a large scale malware attack.</p>

			<p>So does this mean the muslims would understand if &#8220;go home camel jockey&#8221; was spray painted on one of their many European mosques?</p>

			<p>I love this.  As far as I can tell the effects of this will not be good for Islam or Muslims.  Most people can figure out that terrorism isn&rsquo;t good PR, but I guess Muslims find that concept a difficult one.</p>

			<p>The civilized world, as opposed to the 3rd world and Muslim world can expect more of this and worse in the future. The greater problem is the Muslim one. They are mostly 3rd worlders except for the stupid western converts, but they are still, in general, 6th century 3rd worlders and want the whole world to be back in the 6th century. PC wasn&rsquo;t know then so maybe it would be a good thing.</p>

			<p>The notion of Muslims demanding freedom of speech is the most amusing excess of their hypocrisy they have yet displayed.</p>
<p>Dutch law, however, may have a different take on the issue of website defacement.  In the US, for instance, it is a crime.</p>

<p>&gt; Agreed Skip - let&rsquo;s just hope that the white plan is not to return to 14th century Europe.</p>

			<p>Gosh, there must be some western hackers that can raise havoc with these Muslims and their websites. AND I ask again,have the Dutch handed Mr. Wilders over to the Jordanians yet?? I really expect them to do so under the cover of darkness.</p>

			<p>I learned the leet speech from my Finnish professor briefly outside the class and I notice there are some names written in leet speech&hellip;  Try not to learn or use leet speech because it is sometimes very annoying to people around you.  He sure is one of my favourite professors!!  He has Finnish accent, and he also taught me how to say hi in Finnish.  </p>

Saudilx is probably the name of the server, not the person, and lx very likely stands for Linux, a very well-known type of a server.  <br>

<p>Of course those are not the real names of the hackers, but the hackers mostly use the same login name over and over again (including me) and those guys can very likely be tracked down, or those login names can be used to gather enough clues and evidences.  And if you want a precise way of tracking those hackers down, send an email to this address net_devil@hackermail.com with an attachment and see who opened the attachment and where it was opened.  </p>
<p>But I agree what the hackers have done is relatively harmless.</p>
