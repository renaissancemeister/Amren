<h1>Anchorage to Get Mexican Consulate</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Julia O&rsquo;Malley, Anchorage Daily News, August 17, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Mexico will open a full consulate office in Anchorage to provide services and promote trade, according to consul Jose Luis Cuevas.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>An office is under construction and will open this fall at 610 C St. In the meantime, the consulate is looking for temporary space, Cuevas said.</p>
<p>It will have a total of 10 employees.</p>
<p>A Mexican consulate provides a variety of services to people of Mexican descent and tourists, including visas, birth certificates and identification cards. American-born children with Mexican parents can be granted dual citizenship, Cuevas said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hispanics make up one of the fastest growing ethnic demographics in the state. Close to 40,000 Hispanics live in Alaska and about half are of Mexican descent, according to estimates from the U.S. Census and the consulate.</p>

<p>Just another shameful statistics that Mexico must live with because it must encourage its citizens to migrate in order to find work.</p>
<p>If the country were occupied solely by Europeans in the beginning, it would now be a thriving civilization that would be on a par with the US.</p>
<p>Large scale emigration from the country is nothing more or less than an open advertisment of the failure of Mexicans and those south of them.</p>
<p>Nothing else reveals their incompetence any better.<br>

			<p>Unfortunately,thanks to socialist mayor Mark Begich and the leftist municipal assembly Anchorage is a sanctuary city.Catholic Social Services and other agencies with government money have made Anchorage a mecca for immigrants both legal and illegal with a 30% or more minority population and rising.Crime is up and the gangs are here.The quality of life has gone way down.Alaska is a great place but I as a 36 year Alaska resident could never recommend Anchorage as a place to live. Oh by the way Begich is running for U.S. Senate now.Life just keeps getting better!!!</p>

<p>I understand that the Polar Bears further North are organizing against Mexican illegals, too.  Something about there not being enough seal meat to go around for all the Bears and all the Mexicans.  Yes, I even expect a Mexican consulate at the North Pole.</p>

<p>YES! the State of Kuwait. Last year or in 06 I forget, the Kuwaitis rounded up the Crips and Bloods that had gotten there somehow, and those thugs now know they have no civil rights there and no phone call or guaranteed legal reps. I also approve of the Kuwaiti immigration system. Come on their terms, LEAVE on their terms (NOT negotiable)I don&rsquo;t like Muslims but they got immigration right.</p>

			<p>Warning: Sarcasm ahead! </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve fished Alaska several times. Such an idealogical fantasy, just me, my two buddies, a few fish, and 2.5 trillion starving snow mosquitoes!</p>
<p>Alaska is still rough and tough! It&rsquo;s hard for me to visualize Mexicans liking either the climate, or the bugs, since the climate from which they come, as well the one in which I live, both tend to be somewhat hot!</p>
<p>In my humble view however, Alaska at least during the summer, is one of the most beautiful states within our nation&rsquo;s fifty seven plus. Spending a winter in Alaska, with its twenty two plus hours of darkness however, is worst than taking a trip through an Edgar Allan Poe&rsquo;s wonderland of suicidal depression! In short, you&rsquo;ve got to get your mind right in order to do Alaska in Winter! Although the sky does light up with its Northern lights, it also tends to get just a little too cool for this Alabama boy who grew up thinking cold was anything below 40 degrees Fahrenheit!   Talk about messing with your head (that&rsquo;s Alaskan talk for biorhythms)!   </p>
<p>Even so, if there is physical work to be done and the pay is good, Mexicans will always be arriving in droves, whether it is Arizona, Alaska, or on top of the Himalayas!   Take the work away however, by fining the employers (for hiring illegal Mexicans), then hocus pocus, guess what?</p>
<p>Finally, irrespective of what you may think, Alaska ain&rsquo;t cheap!</p>

Maybe the eskimos will get pissed off enough and feed them to the polar bears???? </p>

			<p>Mexico is a failing state.  Establishing a consul is the same as a beach head in an invasion.  A consulate once granted is the consulate nations territory within the granting nation.  The cosulate protects the rights of its citizens within the host nation and may or may not grant visas for entry or citizenship in their nation.</p>
<p>What some may not be aware of is the international law regarding what is known as the &#8220;diplomatic envelope.&#8221;  A diplomatic envelope cannot be inspected or questioned in any way without political complications, including protest and lawsuits.  Few diplomatic envelopes are ever questioned.  A diplomatic envelope can be as large as a ship container.  It can hold the entire household of a diplomat and whatever else you can imagine.  And there is no limit to how many diplomatic envelopes a consul may require - although one might think that dozens of ship containers might alert someone.  But I believe that Customs has no jurisdiction regarding diplomatic envelopes.</p>

			<p>Alaska has a lot more than just Mexicans!  There are large numbers of Japanese and Filipinos up there.  I always wondered how they handled the weather, too. <br>
But then again, Anchor-town is getting to be just another big city.  <br>

<p>You&rsquo;re right, nothing with a diplomatic seal on it falls under custom&rsquo;s right of inspection. I have traveled and my son does travel under diplomatic passports and NOTHING whatsoever is examined. I have seen diplomatic containers sitting in areas that the customs people cannot even go in. That may have changed since 9-11 but I doubt it, the Saudis are especially notable for having large numbers of diplomatically sealed containers leaving and entering the country. If a WMD enters the U.S. it will be through a Saudi container I think.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s just another dumping ground public relations center is all. Remember, they believe they have a right to the entire continent of America top to bottom and nobody else does &#8220;All for La Raza nothing for anyone else&#8221; [mencha slogan]. The fact they are simple mestizos from Mexico who oppress native americans and displace Europeans everywhere they go (Europeans made the country great) doesn&rsquo;t even register in their racist brains.</p>

			<p>Sorry! But I can see a lot of misunderstanding in a lot of people that try to put their opinions. We must to read and research too!! Nobody like ilegals are allowed to get any social services, any welfare, you must read before to say anything. If we don´t care about well informated opinions, we are the same like any not literated people. The diference with ordinary and any insane people is to write good opinions, not that kind of dumb opinions that came from their liver.<br>
Please, get information before write.</p>
