<h1><a href="https://www.wral.com/news/local/story/3415717/">Duke Lacrosse Accuser Writes Memoir</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WRAL-TV (Raleigh), August 21, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The woman at the center of the scandal that rocked Duke University, Durham and the lives of the three lacrosse players she accused of raping her is coming out with a book.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Last Dance for Grace: The Crystal Mangum Story&#8221; is scheduled for publication in early October, according to Vincent Clark, a representative for Fire! Products Inc., a film studio that is representing her.</p>
<p>Magnum will donate $1 from the purchase of each book to help battered women, Clark said.</p>
<p>Crystal Gail Mangum was a student enrolled at North Carolina Central University in March 2006 and also worked as an exotic dancer when she performed at a party hosted by several Duke lacrosse players.</p>
<p>It was at that party, Mangum alleged, that three white members of the team trapped her inside a bathroom and raped and sexually assaulted her. David Evans, Collin Finnerty and Reade Seligmann were later indicted on the allegations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to a news release Thursday, published reports portrayed Mangum as &#8220;a gold-digging hooker searching for a big payday or as an unstable, troubled young woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The truth about Crystal&rsquo;s life, her account of what happened on March 13, 2006, accusations and the motives of the people criticizing her were never seriously explored,&#8221; the release said.&#8221;</p>
<p>A divorced mother of three, Mangum hasn&rsquo;t spoken publicly about the case, other than granting a single interview in the early days of the investigation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The attorney general&rsquo;s office &mdash; which never pursued a case against Mangum, saying she likely believed the allegations &mdash; declined to comment Friday.</p>
<p>Clark said Mangum, who graduated last spring from NCCU, is still living in Raleigh and is looking into law or graduate school.<br>
