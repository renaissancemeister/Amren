<h1><a href="http://wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=73448">Obama Warns Stations Not to Air &lsquo;Radical&rsquo; Ad</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WorldNetDaily, August 26, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Sen. Barack Obama is warning TV stations and asking the Justice Department to intervene in an attempt to block the airing of an ad by a non-profit group that links him to an unrepentant domestic terrorist.</p>
<p>The spot by the American Issues Project questions Obama&rsquo;s ties to William Ayers, a founder of the Weather Underground organization who boasted of a series of bomb attacks at the Pentagon and U.S. Capitol four decades ago.</p>
<p>The Associated Press said Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;going-for-the-jugular approach&#8221; was the kind of response many Democrats complained Sen. John Kerry lacked when he was confronted with the charges of Swift Boat Veterans for Truth during the 2004 presidential campaign.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama spokesman Tommy Vietor, who called the ads false, despicable and outrageous, said supporters of the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate have inundated stations with 93,000 e-mails.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama campaign lawyer Robert Bauer wrote to station managers, the AP said, warning: &#8220;Your station is committed to operating in the public interest, an objective that cannot be satisfied by accepting for compensation material of such malicious falsity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bauer also wrote to Deputy Assistant Attorney General John C. Keeney, calling the ad a &#8220;knowing and willful attempt to evade the strictures of federal election law.&#8221;</p>
<p>American Issues Project counsel Cleta Mitchell responded today with the group&rsquo;s own letter to Keeney</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me be very clear: AIP is not in violation of any federal statute, regulation or other applicable law,&#8221; Mitchell writes. &#8220;This organization, its officers and directors and all those associated with it have taken great pains to comply with all provisions of law applicable to AIP&rsquo;s activities and programs and will continue to do so at all times in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Obama launched his political career with an event in Ayers&rsquo; home, and WND first reported Obama served on the board of the Wood&rsquo;s Fund, a liberal Chicago nonprofit, alongside Ayers from 1999 to 2002.</p>
<p>Obama also was chairman, under Ayers&rsquo; leadership, of the Chicago Annenberg Challenge, or CAC, a school reform organization. The University of Illinois at Chicago, where Ayers is a professor, is scheduled to make available today records of Obama&rsquo;s service on the CAC board.</p>
<p>Responding to the Obama campaign&rsquo;s fierce reaction, American Issues Project spokesman Christian Pinkston said, &#8220;It seems they protest a bit too much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;re going all of these routes &mdash; threats, intimation &mdash; to thwart the First Amendment here because they don&rsquo;t have an argument on merit.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ayers has admitted to involvement in the bombings of U.S. governmental buildings in the 1970s.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t regret setting bombs. I feel we didn&rsquo;t do enough,&#8221; he told the New York Times in an interview released Sept. 11, 2001</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ayers is married to another notorious Weathermen terrorist, Bernadine Dohrn, who also has served on panels with Obama. Dohrn, once on the FBI&rsquo;s Top 10 Most Wanted List, was described by J. Edgar Hoover as the &#8220;most dangerous woman in America.&#8221; Ayers and Dohrn raised the son of Weathermen terrorist Kathy Boudin, who was serving a sentence for participating in a 1981 murder and robbery that left four people dead.</p>

			<p>Bill Clinton is rumored to have called Obama a &#8220;Chicago Thug.&#8221;  This demonstrates that Obama is all that, and he is pure 100% Chicago Machine Politics.</p>
<p>BTW, Obama, until very recently, recommended a book written by Bill Ayers, which calls for the elimination of prisons, because they enforce an atmosphere of shame and inferiority.  (Duh.)</p>

			<p>Dohrn may be worse than Ayers, she praised the Manson family murders as some sort of harbinger of revolution. I hope that shows up in campaign ads too, along with good helpings of rehashed Afro-centric nonsense from Obama&rsquo;s (not too distant) past.</p>

			<p>What does Obama have to complain about?  The ad merely states the obvious truth that he was associated with an unrepentant terrorist.  The fact that he had such an association is not in question.  The fact that his associate, Ayers, was involved in the Weatherman underground bombing of government buildings is not in doubt.  Finally, there is no doubt that Ayers is unrepentant as his own words clearly indicate.<br>
Thus, given that every element in the proposed ad is a well documented fact, on what grounds can Obama attempt to block it by appealing to the US Justice Department.  Last I heard it is not one of the justice department&rsquo;s functions to shield presidential candidates from uncomfortable facts.  Perhaps it will be should he become president but then, many things may change radically should he become president.</p>

			<p>Obama seems a bit thin-skinned (no pun intended) and humorless. He takes himself very seriously. Traditionally, it&rsquo;s not a very good indicator of future success in a U.S. Presidency.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re running against Republicans, you&rsquo;ve got to be ready to deal with spurious side issues, barrels full of red herrings, and just plain maliciousness. They&rsquo;re like a bunch of cliqueish high school girls at a bad time of the month.</p>
<p>That said, his acceptance speech last night was as impressive as any politician&rsquo;s in modern memory. I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s such a bad guy, but as I watched the cameras pan the audience and focus in on various emotionally affected white people  &mdash;  particularly women  &mdash;  I just couldn&rsquo;t help it. In my mind, all I could see were thousands of young black males sitting in front of TVs thinking, &#8220;So many gullible young white women; so little time!&#8221;</p>

<p>yep, bombing, murder and robbery have always been the hallmarks of noble causes!</p>

The behavior of the Obama campaign on this issue sends a loud signal that they know it is his biggest Achilles heel. When Obama tried to get off the hook earlier by saying &#8220;he did these acts when I was eight years old,&#8221; he was trying to wriggle out of responsibility for poor judgment by raising an irrelevant fact. </p>
<p>We will be hearing a lot about William Ayers during the next few weeks.  I&rsquo;m looking forward to watching the Obama supporters squirm.</p>

			<p>Notice the Obama camp said nothing about these being false accusations.  They&rsquo;re on the defensive, especially since McCain picked a woman for his veep.<br>
And can someone tell me whay Ayers is not doing time and why the UI at Chicago would hire such a despicable person?<br>

			<p>General Quagmyer:</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t happen to think that Obama&rsquo;s speech last night was that good.  It seemed to me like an ordinary Clinton-Bush State of the Union &#8220;laundry list&#8221; of gripes and wishes.  Then again, it seems like Obama read the same speech that 100 other speakers recited at this convention; it&rsquo;s clear that the Dems think (mistakenly, IMHO) that Bush&rsquo;s success in &#8216;00 and &#8216;04 was entirely Karl Roverrated, so they think they have to sell their soul to David Axelrod.</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s speech in 2004 was a lot better, frankly.</p>

			<p>This is just a sign of what Obama and the leftists will do if they take control of the country.  They will seek to shut down anyone with a different view than their&rsquo;s through legislation or intimidation; just look at the &#8220;Fairness&#8221; Doctrine they want to pass to shut down talk radio.  America is starting to look more and more like the Soviet Union everyday.  </p>

<p>So is the claim that all the problems of the black race (and other nonwhite races) are due to wickedness of whites, but I don&rsquo;t see anybody in the mainstream being up in arms about that slander.</p>

<p>Actually, what just might be his biggest Achilles heel is the birth certificate/dual citizenship/Kenyan birth questions, unless the MSM is too frightened to consider investigating any of it. I wish we had free, open, honorable media like we once had.</p>

			<p>So what if Obama &amp; his gang manage to get the ad off the air? Like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mopkn0lPzM8" rel="nofollow">the one featuring Charlton Heston as Moses</a> (as well as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetxaA42OuE&amp;feature=related" rel="nofollow">its follow-up</a>, it will simply be posted on YouTube and viewed by even more people than would ever have seen it on TV.</p>
<p>You can run, but thanks to the Internet you can&rsquo;t hide.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s just a matter of time before you can no longer run a web site such as this under penalty of the Orwellian Draconian hate speech laws. They will tell us what emotions we are allowed to have for what groups they decide. I never would have thought that what happened in Germany could happen to America.</p>

			<p>Can someone tell me what&rsquo;s happened to our young people that they would be willing to vote for someone like this?  Twenty-five years ago (I&rsquo;m 40) in my generation, most young people were racially conscious, even if they didn&rsquo;t admit it.  I know every generation likes to make comparisons to the next but I honestly believe we were more mature, intelligent and responsible.  A clown like this would never have been give a second thought.   </p>

Obama&rsquo;s outrage   &mdash;   and his feeling that he should just be able to clap his hands twice quickly and make it STOP   &mdash;   strikes me as merely the typical arrogance of an Affirmative Action hire from an anointed minority, who has so gotten used to his skin color getting him out of every sticky situation, that he now DEMANDS that it should. &#8220;Don&rsquo;t you be running this ad now,&#8221; he seems to be saying, &#8220;or I&rsquo;ll have to call you a RACIST. I&rsquo;m getting ready to do it. Can you see me getting ready? I&rsquo;m getting ready. I&rsquo;ll do it. Don&rsquo;t be runnin&rsquo; that ad now. You&rsquo;re running it anyway? OK, here it comes: R-R-R-R-r-r-r&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>As others here have intimated: this &#8220;warning&#8221; not to run an ad critical of him is but a taste of the repression to come should (god forbid) this man end up with the keys to the palace. </p>
<p>Good ad, BTW, everybody should click on it and have a look. Hope to see lots more of this sort of thing before Nov. LOTS more. I think the Ayers connection will score points with swing voters: non-ideological non-racist whites who might be leaning toward the Biracial Christchild at the moment (cuz the media TELLS them to), but still have their doubts about him. It&rsquo;s not too late to scare such Undecideds off Obama by constantly reminding them about the radical anti-American nature of his various unsavory associates. </p>
<p>So take heart, my white brothers and sisters. He hasn&rsquo;t won yet. <br>

			<p>My Lord, if the American public wouldn&rsquo;t have it&rsquo;s head so far up, they wouldn&rsquo;t stand for this kind of stuff for a minute. We are now going to allow these puppets for big business and corrupt political freaks to take away vital information from the American public, on people who might sit in the White House, and control America&rsquo;s destiny? Give me a break. Have we lost it?</p>

			<p>This is typical behaviour for African politicians across the globe and throughout history. No criticism of them is allowed, or there will be &#8220;consequences&#8221; for those that disapprove of them. CAN..YOU..IMAGINE&hellip; what will happen if Obama becomes president?  </p>

<p>Yes, I noticed that also.  I forget what was said to him a couple of weeks back, but it hit home, and he reacted, I thought, just like the typical arrogant black who feels he is above criticism.  It was apparent to me that if McCain realizes the weakness and works on needling him during a debate, we just might see Super Fly come out in a ghetto accented repartee that will reveal his carefully concealed true personality. </p>

			<p>what happened to our kids?  they have been indoctrinated by our schools, colleges, and universities for the last 35 years.  they have stolen our kids right out from underneath us, as they said they would (ginsberg). we have all been partly responsible by accepting political correctness without saying anything back. if anyone says anything politically correct in front of me now i am going to let them have it in no uncertain terms. dont you see it, communists have infiltrated our education system since j edgar hoover died.</p>

			<p>Anti-Hussein rant:</p>
<p>The only reason B. Hussein Obama is mentioned by anyone in the USA:</p>
<p>&#8220;[Jack] Ryan hoped to succeed retiring Republican Peter Fitzgerald in the United States Senate. On March 16, 2004, he won the Republican primary, thus pairing him against Democrat Barack [Hussein] Obama. However, after allegations from his ex-wife, he withdrew his candidacy on June 25, 2004, and officially filed the documentation to withdraw on July 29, 2004.&#8221;</p>
<p>B. Hussein Obama is a complete, utter fraud.  Never won anything of import; has nothing to utter except scripted platitudes; his only hope is the &#8220;race-card/white guilt&#8221; vote.</p>
<p>Also, he shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed as a Federal candidate, at least under &#8220;my&#8221; proposed U.S. Federal constitutional amendment, which would disallow a candidate for Federal office, of any level, who didn&rsquo;t have two U.S.-born parents.</p>

			<p>To be honest, there is no need to be concerned about Obama&rsquo;s relationship with Ayers - based upon what we know, which is that Ayers&rsquo;s crimes were committed when Obama was 8, and that they have shared little more than chairmanship of an anti-poverty board. A lot of the furore over this is simply hyperbole and distrust spread by the Republicans. What we should be concerned about is the fact that the records detailing the time he shared with Ayers on the board have been sealed by the University of Illinois. Why would they do this unless Obama has something to hide?</p>

<p>Exactly Tom. These young people are what used to be called, &#8220;Dull Witted.&#8221; That&rsquo;s the only reason they&rsquo;re going for Obama. Because anyone with half an ounce of sense can see the guy hasn&rsquo;t got what it takes to run the country. I seriously doubt he could run a small car wash by himself.</p>

			<p>Since this ad was run by Fox news, during the early coverage of Obama&rsquo;s acceptance of his party&rsquo;s nomination, I&rsquo;d say the Obama camp has FAILED to intimidate anyone into not running it.</p>

However, just as with Kerry and his lies about his military service, truth is dangerous to the Left-wing extremists like Ayers. The only option to Obama&rsquo;s campaign is to make Carville&rsquo;s politics of personal destruction seem like a childrens&rsquo; game.<br>
 Obama&rsquo;s backers are the equal of Hitler&rsquo;s Brown Shirts or Mao&rsquo;s foot soldiers in the cultural revolution.<br>

			<p>I feel that Obama will be a much President than McCain as a result of some counter intuitive reasoning.</p>
<p>Is McCain dialed in?  Absolutely, his answers at Saddleback Church weren&rsquo;t just good, they were perfect.  I.e., asked when life begins McCain just didn&rsquo;t provide a good answer (i.e. when a fetus has a heart) he gave a perfect answer(at least as far as Christian conservatives are concerned):at the moment of conception.  He has all the marks of a star pupil who studies hard and knows what the teacher wants, almost too well.  What he thinks and believes that&rsquo;s probably another matter all together.</p>
<p>McCain is also much more at ease with the media, this week while on the Tonight Show Jay Leno said this was his 13th appearance.  I&rsquo;ve also seen McCain on Ellen as well. Never mind his appearances on SNL.  He has an ability to deal with these media pundints and talk headings quite well.</p>
<p>McCain has also spoken at numerous times about his idea of American greatness and how the American people should put aside their personal interests and work for the greatness of the nation as a whole.  Read Myth of a Maverick for further details:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/McCain-Myth-Maverick-Matt-Welch/dp/0230603963" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/McCain-Myth-Maverick-Matt-Welch/dp/0230603963</a></p>
<p>McCain is intelligent articulate and determined to extend the frontiers of American power and influence.</p>
<p>So why does all this make McCain rather than Obama a bad candidate?  Because he has the will determination and ability to consolidate that power.  This makes him exactly the sort of man the founding fathers would not want as President.</p>
<p>The founding fathers envisioned a system where the President was balance by the other three branches.  No branch was suppose to have supremacy over the other branches.  Yet this is exactly what has happened over a period of many decades, the Presidency has grown in power relative to the judicial branch and the legislature.</p>
<p>When the founding fathers gave Congress the Right to Declare War I doubt they envisioned Congress using that power after George Bush I or II had deployed American forces overseas.   Its quite unlikely that the founding fathers would have approved of LBJ deploying hundreds of thousands of US military personnel into Vietnam without a declaration of war.  This of course is just one example.</p>
<p>The Office of the President has become too powerful already and with a man like McCain occupying it there is no doubt in my mind that will the office will become even more powerful.  McCain is just another Roosevelt or Lincoln who seeks to expand the powers of government and hurl America to war.  A dictator rather than a tyrant, who in his mind uses the power of the Presidency to help &#8220;America&#8221;.</p>
<p>Obama on the other hand will be regard with immense suspiscion once he starts to flounder in that office, not if.  Factions will arise and they will be too strong for Obama to control.  Obama is a political amatuer and he lacks the intelligence,experience and sheer will to power that McCain possesses.  If Obama is elected President he shall govern the country with the greatest of difficultly.  This is truly a situation that the founding fathers intended where one branch of government must compromise with the other three.</p>
<p>McCain is a true leader that people fear rather than love and that&rsquo;s why I think he will be President for better or worse.  I admire and fear McCain far more than Obama.  That&rsquo;s why I think Obama will be a better President, we will have a something closer to the compromise and disunity that characterizes representative government.  Rather than the domination of an intelligent and determined man with the will to power.</p>

			<p>It is amazing to me that so far, the Democratic campaign and in fact even the GOP have allowed hardly any airing of some basic facts that ought to blow any candidate out of the water in a presidential race.  His mother used deception to get him U.S. citizenship after pointedly stating that any mate of hers &#8220;Would have to be a man of color&#8221; making her a reverse bigot and racist, who then went to Kenya and found a likely male to impregnate her.  That man went on to marry another white woman in Hawaii, who he repeatedly beat and then deserted, and then married yet another gullible white woman without the event of divorce and repeated his treatment of her.  Meanwhile, Obama&rsquo;s mother took him to Indonesia where she mated with another non-white and produced another mixed race child.  And now the nation is &#8220;celebrating&#8221; the diversity of the &#8220;probable&#8221; first family, full as it is of bastards, polygamy, reverse bigotry and racism.  Obama himself has admitted to smoking marijuana, (we can only guess what else came along during his recreational drug era).  Then there are the well known comments and associations.  </p>
<p>These things would sink a candidate in any other election and in any other time.  That no one seems to be able to bring up these dishonorable origins, dangerous practices and associations shows us how devolved our culture has become when such origins are paraded as some sort of badge of merit and source of pride.</p>
<p>These Young Democrats are acting like Young Pioneers in the USSR and Maoist China.  They have no understanding of the meaning of free speech or rights of expression.  They only feel they have license due to their assumption of moral superiority because they have been trained to think that in public schools and the soocialist uninversities.  What I find ironic is that they seem to be a new version of Puritans and Methodists that have driven the conservative religious politics of this country since its beginning.  These young leftists don&rsquo;t see that they have become what they once (their parents) stood against.  It just happens to be the negative of those who traditionally wanted to run the country from a pulpit.  </p>
<p>And that is my personal problem.  I feel caught between to factions that seem to be warring for the prize of totalitarian control of our society.  I ultimately side with the conservatives because I cannot betray my own skin and bones.  I also happen to think that the White race is beautiful and brilliant and I would see it respected and preserved with its art, science and literature.  But I sure wish I didn&rsquo;t have to choose between two equally deluded camps.</p>

			<p>It may sound perverse, but most of my generally White, conservative neighborhood has come to the conclusion that Obama needs to be elected  &mdash;   since it will be the one thing, the only thing that can spur Whites in the USA to wake out of our complacency.</p>
<p>A McCain victory would be the worst outcome, since it would simply put in another pro-amnesty Republican and allow Whites to sink into complacency and self-destruction in the USA.  With Obama in the Oval Office, and all his radical African-American entourage with all their corruption damaging the country, Whites here will finally wake up and gain a sense of unity.  The most effective medicine also tastes the most awful.  Obama in the Oval Office is the likely spur that we need to push White Americans to wake up and come together!</p>

			<p>In Obammy&rsquo;s book he details all the creeps he admires, Ayres, Farrakan, Wright, and his greatest influence his mammy, an avowed marxist who contrary to what he says attended a church in California known as the little red church, nothing to do with color. The road to that church was known as the little red road. Ms obammy was a fellow traveler, and a follower of critical theory, aka a commy who believed everything normal to be abnormal. P.S. there is no documentation that his [parents] were ever married and he couldn&rsquo;t get a security clearance for any law enforcement agency in the U S, yet half the U S populace will vote for him for the highest position in the world.

<p>Miroslav &amp; Yellow Man:</p>
<p>You need to re-think your misconceived view. It is not okay to vote for Barak Obama. His behavior is thug-like and akin to Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe silencing his critics. Obama&rsquo;s friendship with leftist radicals, husband and wife team Bill Ayers and Bernadine Dohrn is a picture of the type of people  whom Obama will place in his administration if he becomes President.</p>
<p>Bill Ayers was a founder of the Weatherman and summed up the organization&rsquo;s ideology as follows: &#8220;Kill all the rich people. Break up their cars and apartments. Bring the revolution home, Kill your parents.&#8221;</p>
<p>His now-wife, Bernadine Dohrn, famously gushed over the barbaric Manson Family murders of the pregnant actress Sharon Tate, coffee heiress Abigail Folger, and three others:  &ldquo;Dig it! First they killed those pigs, then they ate dinner in the same room with them. They even shoved a fork into the victim&rsquo;s stomach! Wild!&rdquo;  And as Jonah recalled yesterday, &#8220;In appreciation, her Weather Underground cell made a three-fingered &#8216;fork&rsquo; gesture its official salute.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obama will put people like this into power. </p>
<p>I urge everyone to send the information that can be found in the link above my post. This link is to article at the National Review that is far more eloquent than I could ever be about this matter. If the link does not work, Google: &ldquo;National Review &amp; Bill Ayers Unrepentant Terrorist.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>{This is typical behaviour for African politicians across the globe and throughout history. No criticism of them is allowed, or there will be &ldquo;consequences&rdquo; for those that disapprove of them. CAN..YOU..IMAGINE&hellip; what will happen if Obama becomes president?}</p>
<p>   I&rsquo;d like to comment only on the facts- which likely will sting- I hate to say it, but Obama&rsquo;s election is no different from George Bush&rsquo;s as far as legitimacy. For that matter, most other nations have some sort of weird phobia about letting truth be heard (ever heard of Watergate)- So why is this so unusual?<br>
I&rsquo;m sure you are aware of the electoral college- which means your votes in the end don&rsquo;t count anyway (If they don&rsquo;t want them to- Surprise!)<br>
   Do you not realize that the president is just a figure head? So if he is elected, it is because one of the &#8220;White&#8221; leaders wanted him there- not because he forced himself into office. Wake up people. You&rsquo;re prejudice against your very leaders- against yourself- and you don&rsquo;t even know it. Please read more and stop being driven by fear and emotion. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong- I&rsquo;m aware that all comments seem very educated (Excluding this one: In my mind, all I could see were thousands of young black males sitting in front of TVs thinking, &ldquo;So many gullible young white women; so little time!&rdquo;), but America is known around the world for being naive for good reason. Do some research into the way governments operate and the way they are setup- it might be enlightening.</p>

<p>I understand your concerns here, but you&rsquo;re missing the point  &mdash;   of course Obama would be corrupt, of course he would be thuggish like Mugabe, of course he&rsquo;d show favoritism to other Blacks.  *This is exactly the point!*  Having Obama in the Oval Office, seeing his corruption and seeing the race-chumminess he&rsquo;d demonstrate  &mdash;   it&rsquo;s the one and only thing that will wake US Whites out of our self-destructive slumber.  McCain would only ensure our self-destruction.</p>
<p>Whites in the USA are like the frog in the pot of water that&rsquo;s slowly boiling.  Our people are too brainwashed by PC, too afraid to defend ourselves and oppose the Cultural Marxist orthodoxy, to come together and stand up for ourselves.  Even without further immigration  &mdash;   legal or illegal  &mdash;   Whites are destined for USA minority status by around 2030 or so, even earlier if immigration continues.  (The primary schools are *already* majority non-White nationwide, and the problem&rsquo;s even worse since many non-White kids aren&rsquo;t registered in the schools!)  Once the USA has a White minority, it will be our destruction, and the fall of the USA as a Western nation.  </p>
<p>McCain would just allow the water in the pot to continue slowly heating to a boil, since he is pro-mass immigration, open borders and outsourcing.  Obama OTOH, would raise the temperature of the pot to a boil, and bring shocked attention to the crisis that US Whites face.  He&rsquo;d be the only factor to wake us up.  My neighborhood is White and very Republican and conservative, but the vast majority are not voting for McCain, because they see how he&rsquo;d just allow naive White Americans to stay complacent and continue down this self-destructive course.  If they&rsquo;re not voting for Obama outright, they are supporting Bob Barr or Chuck Baldwin, but not McCain under any circumstances.  As I said, for the most part, the most effective medicine tends to be the hardest to stomach.</p>

<p>When Obama was given 100 million dollars<br>
to improve Chicago schools He and his terrorist buddy Bill Ayers denied funding to math, science, English projects. But fully funded the SOUTH CHICAGO AFRICAN VILLAGE Project. They spend millions to build a Africa village in South Chicago to teach blacks about their heritage..and of course to hate whites for being oppressors. <br>

			<p>It is no longer true that a vote for Obama is not a mistake.  Since his VP choice, McCain now has a real chance of winning the conservative vote that until now was dead.  He is the oldest presidential candidate and now has a VP who is a real conservative (life member of the NRA, etc).  It would be worth voting for the Republican ticket now, if only in the hope that McCain is forced to step down either by bad health or a natural death (of course there is always the possibility that he would be attacked by a disgruntled Obama supporter if elected).  Things have radically changed with his VP choice  &mdash;  think about it.</p>

<p>In my view McCain is the Nietzschen Overman with the will and desire not just to dominate people here in the US but to extend his power to even the Russians.  I&rsquo;m not saying the Russians did the right thing but in Caucases but they certainly had to do something when their people were murdered.</p>
<p>Obama on the other seems woefully confused when put upon or asked questions that are not in the script.  Obama simply doesn&rsquo;t have the nerve, intellect or wherewithall to hold people in line the way a McCain or Mugabe can.  </p>
<p>Let Obama appoint his terroists advisors there is not way he&rsquo;s going to get them passed even a Democratic nomination committee.</p>
<p>Perhaps in theory if Obama had the power to do what he wanted he would be worse but I don&rsquo;t think he really is a threat to liberty.  He doesn&rsquo;t have that power and drive that McCain posseses.  Even Sharpton or Jackson would be much more commanding and dangerous figures than Obama, they attained power the hard way: they fought for it.  Obama just isn&rsquo;t made of the same material he got lucky.</p>
<p>McCain on the other hand has literally been a fighter all his life.  He was a short kid but no one crossed him anyway because he was a fighter.  Even as POW he consistently defied his captors,which is why the Vietnamese threw him into solitary.  </p>
<p>A man with that much personal drive and power can be true danger in position of President, without something to hold him in check.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll probably get alot of flack for this but I&rsquo;ll say this right now: Obama can&rsquo;t win.  Is because of race?  Maybe.  However I think a more important reason is at play: Obama is the leader you love and McCain is the leader you fear.  It goes back to Machiavelli&rsquo;s old question is it better to be feared or loved.</p>
<p>Its much easier for a man like McCain to be loved a little more than a man like Obama to make himself feared, at least not without destroying his current image.  </p>
<p>Hitler had the theory that people want a master.  They want to be dominated.  McCain is the natural dominator of men.  Obama, I think he would make a great rockstar or actor.  </p>
<p>In the end who will people pick the Overman or the Popular Guy?  If you frame the question of who will President in those terms as far as most people are concerned its very difficult not to vote for McCain.  </p>
<p>So maybe the polls are close but when it comes to punch those holes hit those voting icons I can&rsquo;t see how Obama is going to win.  I think Obama&rsquo;s chances of becoming President are better than Jared Taylor&rsquo;s.  However I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re that much better, despite the acceptable polling mumbers.</p>

			<p>That a person would seriously express the idea of &#8216;eliminating&rsquo; prisons for whatever reason is as breathtakingly shocking as the idea of &#8216;eliminating&rsquo; the U.S. Military as one San Francisco councilperson has seriously proposed.</p>
<p>The only practical way to &#8216;eliminate&rsquo; all prisons would be to either 1) modify our criminal justice system such that there exists only a single graduation of behavior considered criminal, and punish all crimes within that category with the death penalty or 2) banish felons from the country in a manner similar to Britain&rsquo;s 18th century penal mechanism which sent incorrigibles to Australia.</p>
<p>Seeing as there are no land masses available for a 21st century penal colony here on planet Earth, NASA would have a new round of funding for it&rsquo;s new mandate of finding a habitable planet we can banish our criminal class to, unless, of course, we would prefer to go the Sharia-inspired route of decapitating thieves, arsonists, and rapists even though it may be their first indiscretion. </p>
<p>You really have to stop and wonder how people might seriously float some of the ideas that manage to form in the murky neural pathways of their minds and survive for longer than the half-life of a sneeze.</p>

			<p>9:11 a.m.: I hate to burst your bubble here, but Sarah Palin is not a &#8220;true conservative&#8221; in any sense of the word, but merely yet another poseur.  She is a neoconservative through and through, exactly what we do not need: She supports killing even more thousands of young White Americans in these idiotic imperialistic wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere for the ruling classes.  And she&rsquo;s also embraced the open-borders orthodoxy that McCain is a backer of.  </p>
<p>It is simply naive to believe that any Republican on a national ticket would not do this  &mdash;   one has to pledge allegiance to the neocon anti-White orthodoxy and open-borders lobbies.  It&rsquo;s big money that runs the GOP just like the Democrats, and open-borders is at the heart of it.  Palin is as steeped in this as McCain is.  Allowing the complacency to continue with McCain or Palin is simply not a luxury we can afford  &mdash;   we need the shock therapy now.</p>
<p>Yellow Man, that&rsquo;s an interesting perspective.  FWIW, if anything I see Obama winning in November, with McCain increasingly viewed as the weak-willed one  &mdash;   in fact, Obama&rsquo;s subtle yet unmistakable over-the-top tyrannical tendencies are the best guarantee that he&rsquo;ll shock White Americans awake.  My neighborhood is very White and Republican, but nobody likes McCain here, for a variety of reasons.  Most of the conservatives plan on supporting Chuck Baldwin or Bob Barr, but the general conclusion is that when Barack Obama wins the Presidency, his true despotic stripes will blaze in all their horrid vibrancy of the country to see.  It&rsquo;s the jolt that will finally wake up White Americans to our impending self-destruction in North America, and the only thing that could potentially save our fast crumbling civilization.</p>

			<p>Those of you who think that Obama&rsquo;s presidency would bring the conditions for a White uprising to boil are risking a great deal.  First, I am guessing that after winning, he will simply go to the center because his entire goal is to be the first &#8220;African American&#8221; to become president. Second, it would risk the entire argument of White victimhood; if he doesn&rsquo;t oppress Whites - including the ones that voted him in, they and others will argue the over-reaction of White Separatist groups represents a lunatic fringe that may safely go on being ignored.  And third, (oh, did not say I had a third point) history illustrates all too well the extremes of privation and oppression any group will absorb and suffer under for decades, even hundreds of years, before they rise up and change it.</p>
<p>In my view, the risk of losing the momentum at a dice toss in an election is not worth harpooning the movement.</p>

<p>You are so right about the possibility of McCain needling the O-man during the debates until the O-man lets loose with some ghetto Ebonics.  I used to work with a black guy from Dominica, and he had this very beautiful, lilting, totally put-on way of speaking the King&rsquo;s English   &mdash;   until he got stressed or had to hustle and work hard, at which point he would drop all of the niceties and talk like a typical black.  I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any doubt that McCain could have some carefully prepared zingers that would completely throw the O-man off his game&hellip;IF McCain has the guts to do so.</p>

			<p>Yellow man: Everyone is entitled to their opinion. It is up to others to decide whether it is a well thought out logical one. We are not voting for dictator. The idea that either candidate could rule as tyrant king is absurd. No one knows what would transpire with either candidate. However taking into account the track records, one is obviously a patriot, while the other is voted the most liberal senator {socialist] with beyond questionable associations, parents, and a very reavealing autobiography. If one is concerned that McCain is too hawkish, I would point out he&rsquo;s been a war prisoner,and is against even water boarding. The greatest deterrent to war is a powerful military. Who will pin the bell on the cat?</p>

How is he going to answer these questions? He should bow out for the good of the Democrat party. Wait until November, when TV announces that the black people will riot unless we install Obama.

			<p>The one argument for McCain is this:  The Democrats have a majority in both the House and the Senate, majorities that will increase in the next election.  (This is the primary legacy of the Bush years.)  With Obama the Democrats will actually achieve their agendas   &mdash;   amnesty for illegals, higher taxes, more socialism, and more affirmative action.  Leave it to the Democrats to nominate a man to the left of Ted Kennedy.  With McCain there&rsquo;s a chance of government gridlock, which nowadays is the best we can hope for.</p>
<p>What scares me about McCain is that he not only may get his war against Iran, but he may get us into a shooting war with Russia.  Even if we &#8220;win&#8221; that war we&rsquo;ll lose.</p>

			<p>It is no longer true that a vote for Obama is not a mistake. Since his VP choice, McCain now has a real chance of winning the conservative vote that until now was dead. He is the oldest presidential candidate and now has a VP who is a real conservative (life member of the NRA, etc). It would be worth voting for the Republican ticket now, if only in the hope that McCain is forced to step down either by bad health or a natural death (of course there is always the possibility that he would be attacked by a disgruntled Obama supporter if elected). Things have radically changed with his VP choice &mdash; think about it.</p>

			<p>&#8220;We are not voting for dictator. The idea that either candidate could rule as tyrant king is absurd. &#8220;</p>
<p>The issue for me is the consolidation of power in the executive branch.  Although I believe McCain is ideologically motivated and even well intentioned I think the problem here is that the Executive Branch will be even stronger under McCain.  He brings us closer to the road of Dictactorship, how much closer I cannot say.  This isn&rsquo;t a recent phenomenon but a trend that has been occuring since Lincoln took power, the rise of government power and more specfically the rise of the Executive Branch.</p>
<p>I believe that individually liberty will be curtailed under someone like McCain.  He is a driven and dynamic figure and knows how to wield power.</p>
<p>Are we voting for a Dictator,I genuinely can&rsquo;t say.  However if history is a precident a certain well known European military/political leader in the 20th Century took power under a democrat system and literally turned it into a Dictatorship.  </p>
<p>In any democracy for freedom to thrive the people must constantly on their guard for encrouchments upon their liberty.  I for one believe that a McCain presidency constitutes one such encrouchment upon freedom.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the REALITY CHECK, general whateveryour name&hellip; That speech, as all speeches are written by teams of extremely expert PROFESSIONAL SPEECHWRITERS! Because with political campaigns running into the hundreds of millions of dollars, speeches are far to important to be trusted to the candidzte to write. If that busts anyone&rsquo;s bubble, sorry, but that&rsquo;s the way it is.</p>
<p>Like Hollywood actors and actresses, the politicians get scripts, get coached, primped and groomed. How to walk. what to say. What NOT to say in responding to questions. WHY do you think people actually ALLOWED to ask questions of the candidate are so carefully picked and screened? </p>
<p>The average speech gets written, rewritten, changed, modified, checked for semantic content and impact a dozen times or more. Sure, CONCEIVABLY, Obama might, just might have passed a few ideas on content to the speech writing team. But that carefully crafted speech is the product of those very higly paid speech writers, just as his whole campaign is carefully orchestrated and supervised by the PR staff and publicists. But in fairness to the OBMAINATION, this is done for ALL presidential front runners, for EVERY election campaign. Just another fact of political life, friends.</p>

			<p>Yellow man: All branches of our gov&rsquo;t are too powerful, however when push comes to shove the one that we should fear most is the judicial branch, where the final say comes into play. Fear a president who hates America and appoints liberal judges who ilegaly legislate from the bench, and a house and senate who confirms and supports them, nearly always liberal democrats. Incidently germany did not have the us constitution, which by the way is rarely followed. Every member of our government should be impeached since they are all sworn to uphold it, but then they could hardly impeach themselves could they? I think we all know which candidate would appoint left wingers, and it is certainly not McCain.</p>

			<p>As to the descriptions of Palin as a dedicated neo-con, the following is from Wikapedia and lists her positions on various political topics:<br>
Abortion - In 2002, while running for lieutenant governor, Palin called herself as &#8220;pro-life as any candidate can be.&#8221;[39] She opposes abortion for rape and incest victims, supporting it only in cases where the mother&rsquo;s life is in danger,[105] and suggested that requiring parental consent for abortions be added to Alaska&rsquo;s constitution.[106] Palin does support contraception, and is a member of Feminists for Life.[39][107]<br>
ANWR drilling - Palin has strongly promoted oil and natural gas resource development in Alaska, including opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to drilling.[49]<br>
Capital Punishment - Palin favors capital punishment. She has stated that: &#8220;If the legislature passed a death penalty law, I would sign it. We have a right to know that someone who rapes and murders a child or kills an innocent person in a drive-by shooting will never be able to do that again.&#8221;[108]<br>
Creationism and Evolution - In a televised debate in 2006, Palin said she supported teaching both creationism and evolution in public schools. She clarified her position the next day, saying that if a debate of alternative views arose in class she would not prohibit its discussion. She added that she would not push the state Board of Education to add creation-based alternatives to the state&rsquo;s required curriculum.[109]<br>
Global Warming - Palin does not believe that global warming is human-caused.[52]<br>
Guns - Palin, a long-time member of the National Rifle Association, strongly supports its interpretation of the Second Amendment as protecting individual rights to bear arms, including handguns. She also supports gun safety education for youth.[110]<br>
Marijuana - Palin opposes the legalization of marijuana in Alaska, stating concerns about the message re-legalization would send to her children. She has smoked marijuana in the past.[39]<br>
Same-Sex Marriage - Palin opposes same-sex marriage[39] and supported a non-binding referendum for a constitutional amendment to deny state health benefits to same-sex couples.[111] Palin has stated that she supported the 1998 constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage.[39]<br>
Sex Education - Palin is a &#8220;firm supporter of abstinence-only education in schools&#8221; according to CNN in 2006.[112] When running for governor in 2006, Palin wrote, &#8220;Yes, the explicit sex-ed programs will not find my support,&#8221; in response to a questionnaire by the Eagle Forum Alaska.[113][114]</p>
<p>This is not your typical neocon, in fact she considered running as a libertarian.  Perfect, by no means but a neocon, not really but decide for yourselves.  As opposed to Obama she supports capital punishment, supports the 2nd amendment, rejects &#8220;global warming&#8221;, opposes same sex marriage, supports drilling in Alaska.  There are a few other issues that are of little importance to me personally, e.g. creationism versus neo-darwinian theory, ect.  She does appear to be a &#8220;cultural&#8221; conservative in today&rsquo;s definition of the term, something which McCain certainly is not.  I do not see her,  based of these views, as a neocon, which I would be happy to describe in detail if needed.  Remember that the choice is between the lesser of two evils.</p>

I can&rsquo;t see voting for McCain either because of his warmongering and support for &ldquo;Shamnasty.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t vote for Jorge Boosh, but for Pat Buchanan and Ralph Nader.

<p>Remember that 4 years of Jimmy Carter gave us Ronald Reagan.  Obama is going to make Carter look like FDR, and Michelle is going to make Hillary look like Eleanor.  Hopefully, after suffering 4 years under a corrupt, racist, clueless, liberal black president, white America will wake up and say, &#8220;Let&rsquo;s not ever do THAT again!&#8221;</p>
<p>A McCain victory will just teach the Republicans that the path to victory involves ignoring white middle class and pandering to minorities and rich white elites.</p>

			<p>After giving it much thought, I am convinced that Obama NEEDS to win. I agree with other posters that say Obama will be the one to shock America out of its slumber. Imagine the scenario if McCain wins. The first immediate response will be all out riots, followed by media figures shaming America for their choice. We know how America will respond. Even after seeing the brutality and barbarism unleased on the nation, Americans as a whole will remain silent, bowbeaten into a state of complancency by our leaders; made to feel ashamed. McCain will be the embodiment of this shame. He will tell America that we need to compensate for our racist and narrow thinking and push through his multi cult, open borders, globalist agenda with ease. An Obama loss will be the next 9/11. We can&rsquo;t let that happen.</p>

			<p>After reading an article by Chuck Baldwin, the libertarian presidential candidate, I have been forced to reconsider voting for the Republican ticked.  His argument is basically that, although Palin is a true conservative and not a neocon, she will be forced to either support McCain&rsquo;s leftist agenda or resign in order to be true to her principles.  If she supports his agenda, she will betray her and most conservatives&rsquo; principles.  If she resigns, she will merely have served as a tool to get McCain into office.</p>
<p>Either way, her candidacy as VP cannot be good for conservatives.  This leaves me with the &#8220;worse is better&#8221; option.  However, although open to tactical voting, I personally could never bring myself to vote for Obama/Biden, two individuals who illicit a very visceral dislike.  How much worse does it need to become before someone like Ron Paul can be elected to pick up the pieces?  I suspect that an Obama victory would advance the leftist, anti-white agenda so far as to make it unstoppable.</p>
<p>What do one do when there are no good choices, when every choice is bound to be followed by dramatic negative change?  I am quite open to suggestions.</p>

<p>Well Lisette, since blacks favor Obama over McCain at a 94-1 ratio there won&rsquo;t be too many of them standing in their brother&rsquo;s way should he get elected and start trashing the Bill of Rights.  Your statement also connotes that non-whites oppose the &#8220;liberal multicultural totalitarian MARXIST agenda&#8221; in significant numbers, which they clearly do not since this agenda is good for them and bad for whites.  Part of this agenda entails flooding formerly white nations with millions of non-white, third world people so as to diminish, dilute and eventually extirpate the white gene pool. </p>
<p>Call it want you want, but it most definitely is an anti-white racial agenda.  </p>

There are valid criticisms, some that I have made about conspiracy theories here in the past, but it is possible to gain some insight into how the middle classe and particularly whites are being marginalized and why all these world unions with their trade agreements don&rsquo;t care about borders or the sovereignity of nations.</p>
<p>But a thinking person should always make strong claims pass the test of criticism and viewing the comments of critics helps to arrive at the &#8220;take home&#8221; items in any claim or issue.</p>

			<p>Anybody who thinks that Americans &#8220;need&#8221; to vote for Obama so that white people will &#8220;wake up,&#8221; is deluded.  An Obama presidency will be slow suicide for the white race. You never commit suicide and you assiduously work to protect your own interests. To think that you are strong enough and smart enough to participate in your own destruction is giving into the thanatos (death) instinct rather than the instinct for life.</p>

			<p>I am certain that there are countless men out there lurking in the shadows that are keenly aware that terminating an Obama presidency would earn them an honored place in American history&hellip;</p>

			<p>Obama could appear on national television, grab a white baby out of the arms of its mother, cut out its heart and eat it raw and blacks would still vote for him and the mainstream media would still continue to glorify this fraud&hellip; </p>
