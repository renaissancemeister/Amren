<h1><a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0806/p09s01-coop.html">Could Obama&rsquo;s Rise Signal the End of Black Victimology?</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lawrence E. Harrison, Christian Science Monitor, August 6, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The public heard another wrong horn entry last month when Jesse Jackson&rsquo;s crude complaint about Barack Obama &ldquo;talking down to black people&rdquo; was caught by a live mic. The dissonance represented not the innovative tones of the vanguard but the bitter notes of a depleted and increasingly irrelevant old guard.</p>
<p>Mr. Jackson&rsquo;s vulgarity has been widely characterized as symbolic of a generational conflict among African-Americans. It&rsquo;s that, but also a lot more. It may well mark the end of the dominant, decades-old theme of &ldquo;victimology&rdquo; in African-American discourse that has been Jackson&rsquo;s &mdash; and several other leaders&rsquo; &mdash; stock in trade.</p>
<p>Victimology, in the view of black writer John McWhorter, is the theory that (1) African-Americans are continuing victims of racism and discrimination, and (2) their progress consequently depends chiefly on acts of repentant benevolence by whites &mdash; in the extreme case, reparations for slavery.</p>
<p>Jesse Jackson is the best-known victimologist, but far from the only one. They all must experience acute ambivalence as they view Senator Obama: On the one hand, satisfaction and pride that an African-American may well be elected president this November; on the other, what his success tells us about racism &mdash; the root of their victimhood &mdash; in the United States.</p>
<p>What that success says is that, while they may have had a just cause a few decades ago, today they are dead wrong. Not only dead wrong but also perpetuating a myth that nurtures dependency thinking on the part of many African-Americans: &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t make it on our own because the system is stacked against us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Thankfully, another current of thought has emerged among African-Americans that is wholly consistent with the Obama candidacy and all that it implies about the decline of race as a stigmatizing factor in America today. Bill Cosby has become the symbol of this movement, which emphasizes self-help as the principal engine of progress for African-Americans.</p>
<p>Those who are sympathetic to the victim view of African-Americans should read &ldquo;Out of America,&rdquo; a stunning book by journalist Keith Richburg. After seeing firsthand the reality of the lives of the vast majority of Africans, he expressed gratitude that his ancestors had come to the United States, even as slaves.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In his book, &ldquo;Two Wands, One Nation,&rdquo; former governor of Colorado Richard Lamm poses a novel way to think about race and progress: &ldquo;Let me offer you, metaphorically, two magic wands that have sweeping powers to change society. With one wand you could wipe out all racism and discrimination from the hearts and minds of white America. The other wand you could wave across the ghettos and barrios of America and infuse the inhabitants with Japanese or Jewish values, respect for learning and ambition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which wand would you wave?</p>
<p>Jackson would almost surely wave the first; Obama, like Mr. Lamm, the second. That&rsquo;s the measure of the sea change on race that is taking place in American society, so powerfully symbolized by Obama&rsquo;s candidacy.<br>

			<p>There would have to be a difference between older African Americans and younger ones for there to be &#8216;generational conflict&rsquo;. If there is a difference, I would have to say the older generation is more independant. So, they have this reversed. Surprise. </p>

I predict an Obama presidency will be a disaster, for the US and the world .The day African victimology in the US ends will be the day the US no longer exist in the form the Founders had intended . He is probably going to win and I dread it with every fiber of my existence . He will not be my President, not ever .</p>

			<p>Believe me, Race, Inc. will find something to preserve its line of work.  I could imagine the argument will be:  &#8220;Obama got elected, yeah, but he&rsquo;s only one black person out of 40 million in the country.  And most of those other 40 million are all victims of evil whitey.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Black victomology and white culpability have been the cornerstone of the civil rights movement since it began.  All forms of underachievement by the black community are never the product of inherent or innate limitations, but due to the oppressive atmosphere in which the average black strives to overcome stereotypes in a world that seems to be constantly condemning him/her to one step forward, two backwards. However, nagging parallels (as mentioned by Governor Lamm) keep puncturing this fallacious argument: after all, if the Jewish people (persecuted for more than two millennia)can rise to the top of virtually every profession in our country; if Asians from the rain forests of Vietnam, with no knowledge of English and ostracized by the white community in which they lived, managed, in the space of two-three generations, to produce law-abiding, highly successful offspring, then how does one explain black impoverishment in our society?  Sociologists rarely mention these successful immigrant/exile groups in exculpating blacks from social and individual responsibility in their own lives. Affirmative action has stopped the riots and neighborhood destruction, but embittered the displaced whites in the process.  If Obama is elected, he will play the game of victomology (although he certainly doesn&rsquo;t believe it affected his life).  He has to curry favor with the activists whose very livelihood depends on perpetuating the myth of white bigotry and complicity which have so traumatized young blacks (who in truth have never known either de jure or de facto segration of any sort)that oversight commissions and aggressive bureacrats must stand guard at the social and economic gates (forever).  Without black support, Obama will not be elected or re-elected.</p>
<p>Next on the agenda, reparations for past grievances, apologies extracted from every white official (guilty or not), and a host of other measures that we would rather not contemplate.  It is just beginning&hellip;</p>

			<p>The answer to the question &#8220;Could Obama&rsquo;s rise signal end of black victimology&#8221; is&hellip;No. </p>
<p>Nothing will put an end to black victimology. When the white race disappears, blacks will blame Chinese, Mexicans, the weather, the humidity in the air, the evil spirits, or any thing that they can get their hands on.</p>
<p>End of story, end of useless article.</p>

Victim-hood is the black mans&rsquo; gravy train and they have no intention of letting any measure of success end the ride.</p>
<p>Besides, it only takes one non-incident to set blacks back 20 years. Just look at how they react to the n-word. If they hear that one, they&rsquo;re tied up for months. Even if it doesn&rsquo;t pan out, it still makes it into their collective consciousness as a great injustice. <br>

			<p>   No way it will end, actually an osama, er, I mean, an Obama win would only fuel the fire. This would be the launching pad for reparations and a disasterous move toward communist style socialism. I foresee nothing good for this country in the immediate future. The U.S. is readying itself for a death blow. The worst part of it, it is self-inflicted. Communism: 1  Freedom: 0 </p>

			<p> While there may be much to be be said for this assumed change, I think there will be great conflict within the Democratic Politboro. Remember that when the Dems took congress in the last election, some Black Congressmen assumed they would be placed in ranking positions on commitees but Pelosi bypassed some and side-stepped seniority. If Obama is elected, there will be a new call for a sort of &#8220;reparations&#8221;. These will be having Black politicians moved to higher positions of power inside the beltway controlling more of the day to day workings. However, this will not sit well with the likes of Pelosi, Reid and Kennedy who are racists in that they accept and promulgate the idea that Blacks need assistance and can&rsquo;t stand on their own.</p>

			<p>End &#8220;black victimology&#8221;, are you kidding? The leftwing Democrats are just warming up the &#8220;race card&#8221; victimology to be played in this election. In the last two days alone I read on Slate.com that the word &#8220;skinny&#8221; in describing Obama was racist code for &#8220;black&#8221;. And just today on the Root.com which is linked to Slate.com calling Obama &#8220;arrogant&#8221; after his &#8220;we are the one&rsquo;s the world has been waiting for&#8221; stuff is a euphemism for &#8220;uppity&#8221;. No, this is just the beginning of four years of race-hustling, race-baiting if this guy manages to win the White House.</p>

&#8220;[F]ormer governor of Colorado Richard Lamm poses a novel way to think about race and progress: &ldquo;Let me offer you, metaphorically, two magic wands that have sweeping powers to change society. With one wand you could wipe out all racism and discrimination from the hearts and minds of white America. The other wand you could wave across the ghettos and barrios of America and infuse the inhabitants with Japanese or Jewish values, respect for learning and ambition.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
I understand what Gov. Lamm&rsquo;s proposition is trying to get across; and I generally appreciate any official attempt to break blacks and browns out of their victim mentality. But it&rsquo;s a silly and misleading proposition just the same. Imbuing &#8220;Japanese or Jewish values, respect for learning and ambition&#8221; in ghetto and barrio residents would only work if blacks and mestizos POSSESSED THE INTELLECTUAL CAPACITY TO PUT THOSE VALUES INTO ACTION. </p>
<p>Which they don&rsquo;t. </p>
<p>So unless somebody has another magic wand   &mdash;   this one to effect a wholesale upgrade in the average IQ of certain groups   &mdash;   then the whole notion is not only hypothetical, but pointless. <br>

			<p>Sorry but I don&rsquo;t believe it.</p>
<p>As far as the majority of blacks are concerned, there is no statute of limitations on victimology.  They will never let it go, no more than a leopard can change it&rsquo;s spots.  Why abandon your gravy train?  </p>
<p>I am convinced it is a form of self hatred that perpetuates this attitude.</p>

			<p>Could Obama&rsquo;s Rise Signal the End of Black Victimology?<br>
-No, it will not.</p>
<p>Do Blacks instruct their children about hating Whites as a historical occurrence?<br>
-Yes, they do.</p>
<p>Will there be an end to Black victimology so long as Black parents keep on &#8216;educating&rsquo; their children the way they do, or don&rsquo;t?<br>
-No, there will not. </p>
<p><br>
-This problem of recalcitrance self perpetuates into the future without end in sight. This is the foundation that vicitmology is built upon.</p>

			<p>Barrack Obama, should he end up in White House this November would be historical.  But blacks will still whine endlessly that he is just one black man, and not even a full black at that.</p>
<p>Should Obama win in November, blacks will be clamoring for more handouts from whites.  It will never end.  My father said in 1964, when LBJ signed the Civil Rights Act, that blacks will become even more needy and that they will never be satisfied.  But the most important thing I remember him saying was that blacks do not want a house or car like yours, they want your house and they will never be satisfied until whitey is picking their cotton.</p>

			<p>&#8220;It may well mark the end of the dominant, decades-old theme of &#8220;victimology&#8221; in African-American discourse that has been Jackson&rsquo;s – and several other leaders&rsquo; – stock in trade.&#8221;</p>
<p>This guy has to have either skipped his medication or he&rsquo;s smoking something he shouldn&rsquo;t.  I mean he IS kidding isn&rsquo;t he?</p>
<p>Black victimology is ingrained in every single black in the West.  They need a white whipping boy to blame their failures on.  Without being able to whine about non-existent oppression and injustice, blacks will have to admit that they just can&rsquo;t make it in a civilized society without freebies, and they&rsquo;re far too arrogant for that.</p>
<p>That this guy thinks victimology is going to end for any reason whatsoever indicates just how out-of-touch he is with the real world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to believe there are people in this country who are so naive and gullible.</p>

			<p>How about a third magic wand? One that would get their deadbeat black parent/s to leave and replace them with decent, hard-working, no excuses white parents like Obama&rsquo;s mother and grandparents.</p>
<p>Only problem is, what white folks would they find willing to take the job on?  I guess that is why it is a magic wand.</p>

<p> Your post was bang on. Couldn&rsquo;t agree more. Since black failure in America, just like black failure in Haiti, Jamaica and Africa, is due to low I.Q. levels and black pathology, blacks can never abandon the comforting myth of victimology. It is a necessary psychological survival mechanism for them. The truth hurts.  </p>

			<p>Harrison is overlooking the important role victimology plays in controlling the thoughts and behavior of whites. I mean, just think how different America would be if guilt didn&rsquo;t play a major role in the way whites think about race. Would we even be talking about Barack Obama? I doubt it. In fact, if it ever happens, I&rsquo;m willing to bet that a post-white guilt America will look and sound a lot more like what AR espouses rather than the dreamy, cosmopolitan wonderland that the post-racialists preach about. </p>

			<p>Believing that blacks will cease &#8220;blaming Whitey&#8221; for their sorry state because &#8220;one of their own&#8221; is in the Whitehouse is beyond ridiculous.<br>
This would require a general sense of reason,a facillity absent in the black race.<br>
Moreover,Obama,should he disapoint his &#8220;people&#8221; by not showering them with handouts, will simply be &#8220;re-classified&#8221; as an &#8220;oreo&#8221; or &#8220;not black enough&#8221;.<br>
Thinking a black president will silence the race pimp industry is a thought only conceivable to a &#8220;white&#8221; mind.<br>
A naive &#8220;white&#8221; mind.</p>

			<p>In some ironic, cynical sort of way, I actually wonder if an election of Barack Obama to the Presidency might be the one thing that finally galvanizes US Whites out of our complacency.  I&rsquo;ve worked in many countries throughout the world, and American, British and Australian Whites have by far the weakest nationalism and self-interest instinct of any White group.  (*Much* stronger in places like Switzerland, Denmark, Germany, Italy, even France curiously enough, to which some of my Australian, British, and North American friends have emigrated.)  </p>
<p>We need something obvious to shock us out of complacency, and maybe an Obama election is just the thing to do it.</p>

			<p>Are you kidding, they will never give up victimology. Come Nov. I fear trouble if the Messiah wins and more if he loses. If he wins and within a year when all their problems are not solved it will be the fault of you know who, and any criticism of him will of course be racist. All jokes and wisecracks about him will be completely forbidden under hate crime laws. If he loses of course the election will have been stolen from him and we will have to undergo years and years of investigations and hearings. This election is truly a lose lose situation for this country.</p>

			<p>What Harrison thinks is gonna happen ain&rsquo;t! What African-Americans look for is an angle to play the system, to get over, to get what is due to them without putting forth the required mental or physical effort. Its always the angle. </p>
<p>An example is the black man at the local gas station who runs out and takes your air hose away from you, and then, after filling up a tire wants five dollars, or the man who waits for you on the street who just wants to &#8220;hold a fifty.&#8221; Getting over. </p>
<p>In sports its called &#8220;trash talking&#8221; when one African - American is slick enough to embarrass an opponent. Always an angle, getting over, getting the reward without quite paying the full price. In basketball, the African-American ALWAYS prefers the player who slides around a slower opponent who is paying much harder. That&rsquo;s being slick, getting over.  That, in a nutshell is the Jackson style, a style that will NEVER go out of style   &mdash;   for the black, irrespective of affirmative action, political correctness, and/or any amount of money spent on education. As long as legal extortion can get you lots of money why work?  </p>
<p>Obama is nothing more than the man on the street and the fifty has just become fifty million. Its all the same - getting over on whitey. Obama is NOT the new Messiah. The friends that HE HAS CHOSEN are criminals, radicals, and subversives. He will say anything, do anything, to get elected, including partial birth abortions (he supports it). </p>
<p>Obama is cooler, younger, and hipper than either Jesse or Al but they are all the same. If you think that Obama won&rsquo;t shift the reason why African -Americans are not receiving all that they think is due them (which is impossible) from being his fault to being the fault of good old whitey you don&rsquo;t know the black mindset. Its whitey&rsquo;s fault and nothing that whitey can ever do will ever eliminate that stigma. Because if there is no more guilt there would be no more money!!!!        </p>
<p>One reason that Obama does as well as he does is because he doesn&rsquo;t have atrocious grammar. Virtually every educated African-American that I know, yes including those with Ivy League degrees, can not get through a conversation without, subject, tense, and mood issues. It is overlooked because they are of course African-Americans and are held to a different standard. Different standards translates into finding another angle and getting over on whitey. </p>
<p>Were President Obama white he would be no big deal! But since he is the token black with which the liberals can extrapolate into being typical of all blacks does not mean that all blacks will EVER as educated and professional sounding as Obama OR that President Obama will EVER be able to eliminate basic black characteristics from his character. NEVER!</p>

			<p>I suspect his mixed-race status, while coneveniently overlooked when it&rsquo;s expedient to do so, will be the issue raised to maintain the Black victimhood status-quo. One has to admit, Obama is hardly the personification of your average &#8220;African American&#8221; male aesthetically, verbally, etc. Thus, the usual suspects will likely point out that he is more &#8220;palatable&#8221; to all those otherwise wicked whites, because he is technically just a White as he is Black - or something to that effect. A &#8220;real&#8221; would never be so well received&hellip;thus, proof that America is still lously with racism, balh, blah, blah. I can hear it already&hellip; </p>

			<p>Which of the hordes of black elected officials plopped into office over the past several decades has <i>ever</i> done what Lawrence Harrison thinks the Magic Mulatto will do? To the extent that such things can be measured, I&rsquo;d happily wager that black victimology has increased in direct proportion to the number of blacks holding elected office. Why expect blacks to abandon something (blaming Whitey) which has paid so handsomely? B. Hussein Obama, like virtually every black politician, depends upon black victimology to put him into power and keep him there. His celebrated &#8220;race speech&#8221; was little more than the standard po&rsquo; me boilerplate, dressed up Jesse &#8216;n&rsquo; Al bloviation.</p>

<p>Cleveland had a liberal black mayor presiding over the ethnic cleansing there. There was even talk he might be presidential material one day. His name was Michael White. Eventually blacks in Cleveland began calling him &#8216;White Mike&rsquo;.<br>

			<p>Victimhood is over. I just checked the USA Basketball Olympic roster. </p>
<p>On the twelve man team there are eleven black players and one token white guy. Blacks make up 13.4% of the US population but make up 91.7% of the Basketball team roster. Just a tad disproportionate. I wonder what Jesse and Al think about this. Time to get over the 60s brothas. </p>
<p>Heck it probably should be an all black team. I could name ten better black players to replace the token white guy. Sports are pretty much based on achievement. We need to bring this thinking to all spheres of American life.</p>
<p>Btw. I wish women&rsquo;s boxing was in at the Olympics this year. I would have loved to see Russian Natalya Ragozina owner of seven boxing titles (WBA, WBC, WIBF, GBU, WIBA, IWBF, WIBC) take on Laila Ali ex-owner of the (IBA, IWBF, WIBA, WBC) belts. Ali has been avoiding Ragozina three requests to fights so far.</p>

			<p>Nothing will ever stop the thinking of blacks toward whites. It will always get worse as long as they live in the same nation. The only thing that could slow down the racism against whites by blacks would be the media telling the truth and stop instigating hatred toward whites with their propaganda. Proff of this is how blacks felt and acted toward whites before t.v. There was not even close to the hate they have toward us now.</p>

			<p>Harrison&rsquo;s rather incoherent piece in the CSM comes to a rather strange surprise conclusion, to wit, that American blacks, symbolized by Barack Obama, are now planning to take responsibility for their own lives and futures.</p>
<p>Huh?  Where does he see any evidence of this startling development?  The reflexive 94:1 support of Obama among blacks strongly indicates that there&rsquo;s no thought process whatever involved in how they intend to vote.  It&rsquo;s driven entirely by the conviction that if Obama is elected the doors to the US Treasury will be thrown open to blacks in an orgy of legalized looting.</p>

			<p>from the article - &#8220;with Japanese or Jewish values, respect for learning and ambition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Jews and the Japanese have no monopoly on the desire to learn and accomplish things. These are the desires of intelligent people of all ethnic groups including blacks. It&rsquo;s just that the percentage of those with these traits differ amongst groups due to average IQ differences between groups. These traits are not cultural.</p>
<p>Obama won&rsquo;t end all the victimologists silly accusations made against whites but if Obama does become president he most certainly will make their blame game much more irrelevant, especially in the minds of whites and if you can&rsquo;t get white suckers to go along with the victimology propaganda it becomes a futile pursuit so in this respect Obama would be good for whites. Once there is a black president, affirmative action starts to look very dated.  </p>

			<p>The Army&rsquo;s Equal Opportunity&rsquo;s official policy is to portray White-Americans as the only race that can be racist and all minorities are portrayed as their victims.  In fact, the Commanders Equal Opportunity Handbook specifically state that minorities cannot be racist.  Therefore, the Army&rsquo;s EO policy advocates the minority victimization and white guilt ideas and enforces it.  If Senator Obama becomes President, will he support it or abandoned it?

			<p>Who really believes that Obama doesn&rsquo;t back the black victimology mind-set? His own self described &#8220;mentor&rsquo;, and the man who married him, (Rev Jeremiah Wright) has used White guilt as the very foundation of his hate-filled sermons  &mdash;  - White America once supported slavery, White America bombed Japan, White America stole land from the Native Americans  &mdash;  -Ad nauseam! </p>
<p>And Michelle Obama wrote a self-pitying thesis in college, about how she will always be seen as Black first. This ideology has been the bread and butter of their up-bringing. Put Obama and his wife in the Whitehouse, and anytime they find themselves critisized, they will likely make it out to be a giant white racist conspiracy. Also, many black Americans will never stop drop the race card, when it is also one of their long standing, favorite trump cards. As long as white guilt is seen as an effective tool for manipulation, they will continue to use it for years to come.</p>

She dumped him on his long-suffering grandparents while she moved on to next marry a southeast Asian and have at least one more mixed-race mongrel child, Obama has a sister who is half white, half Asian.

Will they accept their station in life, or will they return to blaming whites?  I think the answer is clear, but unfortunate.

			<p>This psychological characteristic of blacks is interesting.<br>
I was reading &#8220;up from slavery&#8221; by booker t washington, a man with some integrity.  Anyway, in the book he talks about how in the 1870&rsquo;s blacks looked to the federal welfare programs, political posts and becoming a member of the black clergy as means of financial/status ascention.  It blew me away how little things had changed.  This same thing is seen in africa today (http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/0,1518,363663,00.html).  This psychological of the victim seem to be genetically ingrained in su-saharans.<br>

<p>This shows gross ignorance (or deception) on Mr. Harrison&rsquo;s part; Jackson would never, ever want to rid the nation of racism against blacks (real or imagined) because that&rsquo;s his livelihood.

			<p>Here is the simply solution that would end &#8220;victimology&#8221; in one year. All welfare, food stamps, tokens for anything free, whatever it is, eliminated. Of course this applies to all demonstrably able bodied individuals. In short, no more handouts to the lazy. NONE. No work, no eat. Illegal aliens deported, the jobs they did offered to Americans, any left over, we can talk about a strict guestworker program, closely monitored. Any American who thinks this isn&rsquo;t possible, is deluded. The reason the criminality towards taxpayers exists, is because it is serving politicians to keep the present nation bankrupting systems in place. The lazy malcontents who will not work for a living, have much to much time on their hands. Nothing about this would have surprised and earlier, saner America.</p>

			<p>For years it was believed that a well-known and very accomplished black doctor (actually he was nearly white as far as looks and descent) was turned away from white hospital and allowed to die. Can&rsquo;t recall whether it was a car accident or a heart attack. Anyway, the black doctor was not turned away. This was an out and out lie. The doctor was well cared for by white doctors who knew him personally. It turns out this lie was promoted by a &#8220;Communist&#8221;. And I hate to say it, because I hate to rouse the  anti-semitic gallery, but the person was Jewish and admitted that he pushed the story. Why? Why do you think?<br>
This story was promoted right after WWII and Jews were perhaps paranoid and some among them wanted to promoted as much white-guilt producing stories as possible? I was truly appalled when I heard this. Jews have nothing, absolutely nothing, to gain from ridiculous white-guilt promotion. The blacks are too dim to<br>

			<p>Obama&rsquo;s rise will not signal the end of black victimology. In fact I know many seem to think that it will bring back the gravy train that blacks in this country relied upon for so long. Already Obama and his militant wife have indicated their desire to bring back afirmative action. That will just be the start of the many policies Obama has in mind to favor blacks over whites. I&rsquo;m just glad that his wife went home and shut her mouth because I got sick of seeing this woman who obviously dislikes the country in which she was raised. She is chomping at the bit for the power being first lady can bring her. Once she has that power she will use it not just to favor blacks but against whites. I may put in at work for a transfer to Canada if Obama gets elected because this country will not be a fit place to live in with him as president.</p>

			<p>If Obama wins, I don&rsquo;t think Race, Inc. has anything to worry about.  Look at all the big cities that have or have had black mayors.  That didn&rsquo;t hurt the Civil Rights Industry in those places.  </p>
<p>I think the reason is that the existence of black political chief executives in the places where they exist doesn&rsquo;t change the reality of race.  They don&rsquo;t make blacks any smarter, or any more docile.  Thus, crime and poverty persists, and as long as there are racial differences between whites and blacks when it comes to crime, welfare and prosperity, there will always be an opportunity for the NAACPs of the world to hustle based on racial jealousy, in a society that has consumed the egalitarian kool-aid since November 19, 1863.</p>
