<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Some are questioning whether a top city leader showed favoritism when he ordered crews to help a &#8220;single woman&#8221; cope during the storm. That single woman was U.S. Rep. Corrine Brown, D- Jacksonville.</p>
<p>During the height of Tropical Storm Fay, when many Jacksonville residents were trying to keep rising water out of their homes or dealing with fallen trees and power lines, the city sent a public works crew to put sandbags around the Brown&rsquo;s home along the Trout River.</p>
<p>Brown denied getting special treatment, telling Channel 4 that she&rsquo;s like any other citizen who had an emergency. She said that when her roof caved in and water flooded her home, she called the city for help.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Neighbor Joe Deloach lives one door down from Brown and he too has rising waters flooding the foundation of his home. He said when he saw the city with prisoners sandbagging the congresswoman&rsquo;s home, he naturally asked for the same help but didn&rsquo;t get the same response.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m glad she got help to save her house. I&rsquo;m not mad at that. I&rsquo;m upset that the same people wouldn&rsquo;t help me and they denied it was going on,&#8221; Deloach said. &#8220;I had prisoners laughing at me when I approached them about it. They knew what was going on. It was hilarious to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adam Hollingsworth, chief of staff for Mayor John Peyton, told Channel 4 he authorized city crews to go help Brown when she reached him on Friday. He said he helped because she&rsquo;s &#8220;a single woman who lives in her own house&#8221; and he could hear the panic in her voice.</p>

			<p>Why is anyone surprised? <br>
This is typical self seeking, <br>
(me first, screw everyone else),<br>
African behaviour at its best.<br>
Which is why Haiti, or any black run country, is the way it is.</p>

			<p>&#8220;She said that when her roof caved in and water flooded her home, she called the city for help.&#8221;</p>
<p>Am I missing something here? Her roof caved in? Water flooded her home? What good would sand bags do in a case like this? </p>
<p>Now for the rest of the story.</p>

<p>Mayor John Peyton has named CSX Corp. spokesman Adam Hollingsworth to the new position of Chief of Strategic Initiatives. <br>
{snip}<br>
Before joining CSX, Hollingsworth served on the staffs of Mayor Ed Austin, Congressman Charles Bennett and Congresswoman Corrine Brown.</p>

			<p>This story is small potatos compared to the other allegations of graft and corruption against Corrine Brown and her daughter, a lawyer that Ms. Brown has helped along since taking office. When Africans come into power, they shamelessly abuse it.</p>

			<p>The left always believed in taking good care of the special elite squad of committed, life-long marxists. It&rsquo;s how they reward their own.<br>
As for the ordinary people, they are good for only one thing: working to pay for the government&rsquo;s extravagance.<br>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve lived through many floods.  If your roof caved in and your house is flooded, no sandbagging is necessary.  She was lying.  The neighbor says her house was saved.</p>
