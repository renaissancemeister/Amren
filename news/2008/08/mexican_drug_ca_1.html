						<p>Warring Mexican drug cartels have given their hit men permission to cross into the United States to kill their targets, according to warnings received by U.S. authorities.</p>
<p>Police and federal agents told The Associated Press about the warnings today, and official along the border are beefing up security.</p>
<p>&#8220;We received credible information that drug cartels in Mexico have given permission to hit targets on the U.S. side of the border,&#8221; El Paso Police spokesman Officer Chris Mears said. &#8220;One of the first things we did was to notify all officers in our department of the situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Drug cartel violence has claimed thousands of lives across Mexico this year. Nearly 800 people have been killed this year in Ciudad Juarez, a hard-scrabbled city of about 1.3 million people across the Rio Grande from El Paso.</p>

			<p>This story is slightly inaccurate in that it peddles the fallacy that there is such a thing as a &#8220;U.S.-Mexico Border&#8221; anymore.  All this story says is that Chicano gangsters are true to their principles and professions.</p>

			<p>Just this past weekend five Hispanics were executed in an apartment just south of Birmingham, their throats slit in an apparent murder-for-hire.  There is evidence they were tortured prior to being killed.</p>
<p>Three Hispanics and an American black have been arrested in connection with the killings.</p>

			<p>The mexican army (so they call themselves) have taken shots at our own border patrols&hellip;.if washington hasnt done anything about that&hellip;then they know anything goes including killing US citizens&hellip;.maybe they might shot some congressman or senator&hellip;then see if anything happens!!</p>

			<p>   Okay now, this tells me that the war is on. When you see mexicans coming across the border, open fire on them. They are enemy combatants. They will, and actually already have, declared war on us. </p>

			<p>Read the comments that readers are making.  It is very inspiring to see people waking up and talking back.  Whenever there is an online newspaper story like this, I always like to read the comments of the regular people who are readers.  That is where you find the common sense, not from the brainwashed politically correct leaders.</p>

			<p>At first, this bothered me.  Then I thought about who their targets might be.  Most likely they will be targeting rival thugs that are a waste of space to begin with.  This might even bring down crimes against regular citizens.  One can only hope.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;d love for Washington to finally wake up, realize the situation and defend this country right on our own land rather than thousands of miles away. I wish we could pull our military out of Iraq and bring them to our border, armed and ready. Then, I would like to hear Mr. Bush declare war on Mexico. Unlike Iraq, it would be over in about three days. Then, all illegals sent home with the warning that if they returned, it would be to prison. </p>

			<p>Hit men working for gangs generally kill folks who belong to other gangs.  If these vatos take a bunch of Serranos, Mexican Mafia and MS-13 members permanantly out of circulation, I&rsquo;m all for it.  As a bonus, if they get caught killing folks here, we get to execute them.  The state of Texas in particular doesn&rsquo;t mess around in this respect.  This seems very much a &#8220;win-win&#8221; scenario.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m sure glad I live 2000 miles from the Mexican border!<br>
And 8/26 12:06 - maybe it could be a case of lowlife likking lowlife however look what happened to the Bologna family in San Francisco, an apparent case of mistaken identity.</p>
<p>Do we really need to replace most of our police forces with paramilitaries with the tactics associated with an army of occupation?</p>
<p>LET&rsquo;S BUILD THAT BORDER FENCE NOW!</p>
<p>o Let&rsquo;s put members of the Texas, Arizona, California, Nevada, Utah and Colorado National Guard on the US:Mexican border with the Border Patrol as trackers and trainers.<br>
o Let&rsquo;s put Mexico on notice that if El Narcoviolencia starts affecting Americans in the USA we will respond by sending our forces into Mexico to take out the drug lords and their troops.<br>
o Any narcos arrested with military weapons in the USA should be treated as terrorists under the Military Commissions Act.<br>

			<p>This should lead to some interesting crime scenes.  See, e.g. the chainsaw scene from Scarface.</p>
