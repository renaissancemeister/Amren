						<p>Federal inspectors at U.S. border crossings repeatedly turned back filthy, disease-ridden shipments of peppers from Mexico in the months before a salmonella outbreak that sickened 1,400 people was finally traced to Mexican chilies.</p>
<p>Yet no larger action was taken. Food and Drug Administration officials insisted as recently as last week that they were surprised by the outbreak because Mexican peppers had not been spotted as a problem before.</p>
<p>But an Associated Press analysis of FDA records found that peppers and chilies were consistently the top Mexican crop rejected by border inspectors for the last year.</p>
<p>Since January alone, 88 shipments of fresh and dried chilies were turned away. Ten percent were contaminated with salmonella. In the last year, 8 percent of the 158 intercepted shipments of fresh and dried chilies had salmonella.</p>
<p>On Friday, Dr. David Acheson, the FDA&rsquo;s food safety chief, told reporters peppers were not a cause for concern before they were implicated in the salmonella outbreak.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the last year, the agency&rsquo;s data shows that dozens of cases were turned back due to filth, illegal pesticides and in one case, something poisonous.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The agency has long considered salmonella to be a risk in dried chilies, since foreign spice traders often leave peppers to dry in the sun where they&rsquo;re vulnerable to contamination from birds and other animals, Buchanan said.</p>
<p>Inspectors might have looked over the odd box of fresh Mexican chilies, but no one paid raw peppers much attention since they were not mentioned as a high-risk crop, he said.</p>

			<p>I completely avoid food from backward countries. I prefer farmers&rsquo;s markets. In British supermarkets (I do not know if it is the same thing in the U.S.A) we can read the place of origin of most products and can thus choose. The only nations I tend to trust and I have bought food products of in the past are nations of Europe, U.S.A, Canada, Argentina, Australia, New-Zealand, South Africa (most vineries and orange farms are still in White hands I believe), Japan and S. Korea. As far as food grown outside these nations I avoid them as much as possible.<br>

			<p>If the US stops the poisened food from Mexico, Mexico will shut off the flow of oil to us.  Democrats have set up the US for destruction and defeat.  Mexico told us that their people only want to sell their oil to their friends.  Is America a friend of Mexico?</p>

			<p>The problem with Mexican food products is that the farm workers urinate and defecate in the very fields that they work in. There are no bathroom facilities to be found and the workers have little choice but to relieve themselves amidst the lettuce, tomatoes and jalepenos, thereby transmitting all sorts of disease to the end consumer here in the US.<br>
Mexico is a backward, Third World nightmare with little regard for modern food hygenic standards. I can remember vividly, strolling through the marketplace in Mazatlan and seeing sides of beef hanging on meat hooks in sweltering temperatures, completely covered in flies, and the butcher hacking into the beef and weighing out slices for customers, while the flies scattered, eventually resettling upon the beef and continuing to feast and deposit larvae.<br>
Mexicans, in general, have nothing but contempt for Americans, and I am sure they take delight in depositing their human waste onto our food products.    </p>

			<p>I wonder if contaminated peppers is what the 19th Century Senator John C. Calhoun had in mind, when he objected to any U.S. involvment with Mexico?</p>

<p>Yeah, overall and despite being an illegal immigrant, the law takes a dim view of disposing of said illegals. This dim view apparently includes deportation too.</p>

			<p>Knowing how to grow your own food can&rsquo;t be a bad thing. according to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Square-Foot-Gardening/dp/1591862027/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1219348447&amp;sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">this book,</a> it&rsquo;s not that hard. I had a friend tell me that she lives out of her garden.</p>
<p>Even a person living in an apartment could manage this. I&rsquo;ll keep you posted.</p>

<p>Probably not.  But wouldn&rsquo;t he be amazed at his foresight?</p>
