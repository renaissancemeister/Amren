						<p>Rhode Island&rsquo;s Roman Catholic bishop is calling on U.S. authorities to halt mass immigration raids and says agents who refuse to participate in such raids on moral grounds deserve to be treated as conscientious objectors.</p>
<p>Providence Bishop Thomas Tobin asked for a blanket moratorium on immigration raids in Rhode Island until the nation adopts comprehensive immigration reform. Tobin made the requests in a letter sent Tuesday to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Boston.</p>
<p>The letter was sent Tuesday and publicly released Thursday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tobin&rsquo;s action comes during a heated debate over illegal immigration in heavily Catholic Rhode Island. Authorities recently raided six courthouses looking for illegal immigrant maintenance workers and Gov. Don Carcieri, himself a Catholic, signed an order requiring state police and prison officials to identify illegal immigrants for possible deportation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that raids on the immigrant community are unjust, unnecessary, and counterproductive,&#8221; the bishop&rsquo;s letter says. It urges individual federal agents to consider the morality of their actions and refuse to participate if their conscience dictates.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>ICE spokeswoman Kelly Nantel said the agency respects Tobin but believes his diocese &#8220;would be better served by helping individuals to comply with the law or working to change those laws rather than asking law enforcement agents not to enforce it.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Roman Catholic and other religious leaders have repeatedly criticized immigration raids that target migrant workers, rather than illegal immigrants who commit crimes.</p>
<p>Tobin&rsquo;s request is unusual because it suggests the raids are forcing immigration agents to choose between their jobs and their religious faith.</p>
<p>Tobin is bishop of the Diocese of Providence, which covers the entire state. Some 60 percent of Rhode Island residents call themselves Roman Catholic, a higher percentage than any other state.</p>
<p>The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has called U.S. immigration policies &#8220;morally unacceptable,&#8221; saying they keep families divided and encourage the exploitation of migrants.</p>
<p>While the bishops&rsquo; conference has said the federal government has a right to launch raids, it believes they are often counterproductive, said Kevin Appleby, director of the conference&rsquo;s Office of Migration and Refugee Policy.</p>
<p>He said Tobin&rsquo;s letter is unique because it asks that ICE agents be excused from raids on religious or moral grounds.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As the illegal immigrants were being arrested, the state police superintendent assured Tobin and other clergy that his officers would not launch immigration raids. State police later said they were just assisting in a federal investigation.<br>

			<p>And people wonder why church attendence has been going down for years. Pseudo-religious leaders like Bishop Thomas Tobin have dollar-signs in their eyes when they promote open borders and the subsequent dissolution of nation that result from it.</p>
<p>I may not be well-versed in the Bible, but didn&rsquo;t Jesus warn us of &#8220;False Prophets&#8221;? This Tobin, along with guys like Mahoney, fall under that category. Not to mention &#8220;Traitor&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Since this Bishop is a Bishop, he probably supervises a number of Priests.  How would he like it if any of his Priests came out against him on this issue, and cited &#8220;conscientious objector&#8221; status?</p>
<p>From the article</p>
<p><i>Providence Bishop Thomas Tobin asked for a blanket moratorium on immigration raids in Rhode Island until the nation adopts comprehensive immigration reform.</i></p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t enforce immigration law, until we can enact amnesty, at which time there won&rsquo;t be any immigration law to enforce anyway.</p>
<p>This Bishop also wants ICE to stop raiding &#8220;immigrant workers&#8221; and focus on &#8220;criminal illegal aliens.&#8221;  First off, being here illegally is a crime, hence the word &#8220;illegal.&#8221;  Second, even if we do what he wants, just the rising Chicano presence will mean there is a bigger veritable problem of real violent criminality to contend with.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Once again, I have to remind people that virtually all churches push the pro-Amnesty line.  My Lutheran church is doing the same, and I bet we&rsquo;ll hear a lot about it week after next when the most pro-open borders Republican ever accepts his party&rsquo;s nomination for President in a heavily Lutheran state.</p>

			<p>Self interest masked as kindness is nothing new under the sun, but it would be interesting if these priests with empty pews and coffers were forced to face the dispossessed urban working class that is slaving for pennies as a result of these illegals. </p>
<p>The Roman Empire fell for the same reasons as this. Bush is our Diacletian. </p>

<p>It makes me wonder if Bishop Tobin like so many others within the Catholic Church are actually enemies of Christianity.  Their sole purpose being to turn people away from God and dimish the Church&rsquo;s position in society. Getting people angry enough to call on the government to end their tax exempt status.</p>

			<p>Now I&rsquo;m no expert on churches but don&rsquo;t members pay dues?  Why not have a huge number of non-Christians enter his church whenever they feel like it, without permission, and conduct their own services without paying any dues.  See how he likes illegal immigration into his own church.  Maybe then he&rsquo;d get it.</p>

			<p>This Bishop is a heretic, both theologically speaking, and as an American citizen. </p>
<p>Either he is preaching a false egalitarianism, contrary to the doctrine of Election which St. Paul preached, or he is engaging in a Vatican policy which is at odds with the wishes of the American Populace.</p>
<p>Either way, his counsel is tainted, and he should be shunned, if not actually removed from his office. Decent American Anglos should complain to the Office of the Pope for his immediate censure.</p>

Can somebody please remind this anarchist Bishop that we have separation of church and state in this country for a reason. He should concern himself with issues of faith instead of running interference for law breakers.</p>

			<p>He should not be urging the Agents to not do their job.  That is cheating the employer-not Christian behavior.  </p>
<p>I agree with Phil at 6:27 PM on August 22, above.  He is not seeing what illegal immigration is doing to the community.  And he won&rsquo;t see it till those that financially support his church stop.  They should for a few weeks.</p>
<p>I suggest he and all other like-minded clergy go to Mexico and fix whatever is wrong there so that Mexican citizens can earn a living there.<br>

			<p>How about we all WRITE to the good bishop and POLITELY tell him what we think of his idea. Does anyone have a mailing or e-mal address?</p>
<p>I do urge decent language; no name-calling or insults. But TELL this blithering fool that he can STUFF that goofy idea    &mdash;   NOT in the same terms, of course.</p>
<p>The whole problem is that our corrupt whores in Washington seem to have forgotten the original intent of the Framers of our Constitution: A GOVERNMENT OF, FOR AND BY THE PEOPLE! in plain language, a government bound to obey the collective will of the PEOPLE, not the profit-gouging business owners and corporate moguls who sold Americans out to the invasion of third-world for the sake of workers dumb enough to accept slave labor wages and have the short-fall made up by US, THE TAXPAYERS!</p>

<p>Agents who refuse to participate have the right to be FIRED! It&rsquo;s their JOB to do these things. If they do not want to do THEIR JOB for which they are paid with taxpayer money, CITIZEN&rsquo;S money, then they should QUIT! </p>

			<p>This bishop is typical of the Catholic Church&rsquo;s liberal attitude toward illegal immigrants.  Just come in to our house, eat our food, take our women, and then - if you want - you can just evict us whenever it pleases you.  The Church is assisting in the destruction of our country with attitudes like this bishop&rsquo;s.  Eventually we&rsquo;ll all be evicted and we&rsquo;ll be forced to fight for our lives in a country where we&rsquo;ll be viewed as a despised minority in the land our ancestor&rsquo;s fought and died for - And imbeciles like this bishop will still be spreading a message of guilt for White people and also for White people to just &#8216;accept things&rsquo;.  The folks who assist in this destruction (the media) will still be characterizing Whites as evil and racist.  </p>

			<p>If these alleged agents are having a crisis of &#8220;faith&#8221; over enforcing the federal laws they are sworn to uphold, then I suggest they find a different line of work, and allow those not conflicted by religious guilt to do the job of protecting this country!! </p>

			<p>I wonder if illegal immigration to the Vatican is also encouraged. With a population of 800 surely there should be space for around 400 illegal immigrants. Maybe they can put up a tower block and house say 1600 illegals. The only problem is that the place will become ungovernable and the Roman Catholic church will probably vanish due to the demographic changes.</p>

			<p>If the the Catholic Church was was forced to pay the bill for illegal immigration, its treason would stop instantly. There was a documentary a few years a ago called &#8220;Hoop Dreams&#8221; about two inner city black kids who had dreams of playing in the NBA. When they could no longer pay tuition for the Catholic school they were attending, the principal of the school a Catholic Brother, called these two Black kids to his office and told them in no uncertain terms to pay up or leave the school immediately.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church is well aware of two things;1)resources are scarce2)immigration is a massive financial burden on Native Born White communities. I&rsquo;m was born and raised a Catholic but I have left the Catholic Church. Native Born White Catholics should retaliate by stop giving during collection time during mass. </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m not certain if these churches truly care about these people or just want more bodies to fill their pews and load their coffers. I&rsquo;m leaning toward the latter. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, Christianity has never been lacking in greed. But now it is greedy to the detriment of Europeans and their cousins across the globe. </p>
<p>Then again, there is the example of the Sudanese goat herders brought to Maine and else where. People far removed from your media-touted hispanic with his &#8220;family values&#8221;, strong work ethic, and devout Catholicism.</p>

			<p>There&rsquo;s something else I have to add.</p>
<p>Whenever these kinds of stories come up on AR, about the Catholic Priesthood and immigration, we inevitably see comments from otherwise pro-white regular or semi-regular AR posters who worry about our &#8220;anti-Catholicism.&#8221;  Though if they wait, or click this link:</p>
<p><a href="/search.html?cx=009148206432049679303%3Aublljjeli10&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=lutheran+immigration&amp;sa=Search#1274" rel="nofollow">/search.html?cx=009148206432049679303%3Aublljjeli10&cof;=FORID%3A11&ie;=UTF-8&q;=lutheran+immigration&sa;=Search#1274</a></p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll see that not only is the Lutheran Church also knee deep in this perfidy, that AR makes an issue of it.</p>
<p>However, the comparison isn&rsquo;t totally valid, and this is where we run into a thorny problem.  It&rsquo;s been quite awhile before my last comparative religion class, and if I&rsquo;m mistaken here, please don&rsquo;t hesitate to correct me.  Catholic theology has a distinguishing characteristic called &#8220;Vicar of Christ.&#8221;  What it essentially means is that, if Catholic Priest says it, God&rsquo;s thinking it.  And if there is a contradiction between two Clergy on different levels of the totem pole, the one that&rsquo;s higher up wins.  Ultimately, the Pope would win any of these &#8220;skirmishes.&#8221;</p>
<p>I can guarantee you that there are a certain percentage of white Catholics, that would otherwise agree with us, but are too afraid to because the Priesthood seems to be amnesty and open borders.  Ergo God is amnesty and open borders.  So far, I have not yet seen any of that in this thread, but it exists.</p>
<p>Likewise, the old Citizens Councils had a lot of difficulty organizing Louisiana&rsquo;s whites in an effort to save segregation, especially in the southern one-third of the state.  The reason is obvious:  The Priests all said that seggy was bad.  Therefore, the Congregation didn&rsquo;t want to oppose what God was thinking.</p>
<p>The Lutherans don&rsquo;t have the &#8220;Vicar of Christ&#8221; theology.  So, while the Lutheran Church might be amnesty and open borders all the way, it won&rsquo;t be hard for Lay Lutherans to come out against them, both the Clergy and the ideology.  Therefore, any given AR posts on Lutheran Clergy and immig won&rsquo;t offend Lutherans as much as posts about Catholic Priests and immig offend some Catholics.</p>
<p>It is a contradiction that will have to be dealt with gracefully.</p>

			<p>Let&rsquo;s stop acting some nice, legal, prim and proper. </p>
<p>The hard core Left, anti White marxist forces or just idiots in tax exempt &#8220;Christian&#8221; churches are using their tax exempt institutions to aid the invasion, assist the destruction of our people. </p>
<p>So we need to  get in there and try to do the same. We can do a lot better in this area, traditionalists in the Anglican Church have been making some solid progress.</p>
<p>If you come from a nominally &#8220;Lutheran&#8221; background, start a tax exempt organization &#8220;Lutherans for Immigration reform&#8221; - put in some churchy, touchy feely stuff about working agasint teh exploitation of immigrants - which will translate into fighting againstg Walmart for giving such low pay and bringing in endless new waves of third worlders to drive down wages even more.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s not just tax exemptions- they are getting large direct grants from the feds.  Billions, in the case of catholic charities.</p>

			<p>If the church desires to minister to the people, then let the missionaries do their jobs as they did years ago. Growing up in the Church, we had annual collections for the missions. Priests went to the countries to bring the word of God. Today, they want the countries brought here. Besides, Mexico is primarily Catholic, so why are they being given protected status? I think we&rsquo;ll find that the reason is the large families Hispanics have that will fill the pews and donate a small ammount to the coffers. Now, what happens when the big doners back out because the church has turned into a third world church filled with people who will drain it dry? I know McCain says &#8220;we&rsquo;re all God&rsquo;s children.&#8221; So we are, but can&rsquo;t they be God&rsquo;s children in their own countries, or does he expect us to take in ALL God&rsquo;s children?</p>

<p>In the Archdiocese of St. Louis, the racial transition almost happened overnight in 1946.  Before then, the Archbishop (promoted to a Cardinal) was John Glennon (think:  Cardinal Glennon Children&rsquo;s Hospital), and Glennon was as racial as any of us, supported segregation of the St. Louis Catholic Schools.  His successor was Cardinal Joseph Ritter (think:  Cardinal Ritter High School, north St. Louis, mostly black), who was an integrationist, and one of his first acts in STL was desegregation, and did the same at his last post in Indianapolis.</p>

			<p>This bishop does not seem to understand what a conscientious objector is.  A conscientious objector is someone who refuses conscription into the armed forces on moral grounds.  It is not someone who volunteers for the armed forces and then refuses to fight.  In fact, conscientious objector status does not automatically get one off the conscription hook.  One friend&rsquo;s grandfather was a C.O. during World War Two.  The army conscripted him anyway, made him a medic, gave him a first-aid kit and a billy club, and sent him to New Guinea. Being fired on by Japanese - who deliberately targetted field medics - without being able to shoot back must have been a uniquely unpleasant experience.</p>
<p>A border agent who refuses to do his job would simply be fired for cause.  He or she could then &#8220;conscientiously object&#8221; from the welfare line.</p>

			<p>I wonder if the fact that most illegals are Catholic has anything to do with the objections of the bishop?</p>

			<p>The burning issue here is this: </p>
<p>ARE AMERICAN TAXPAYERS AND CITIZENS REQUIRED TO CARRY THE THIRD WORLD ON THEIR BACKS, OR NOT?</p>
<p>Apparently the good bishop is at odds with what the rest of us think. If Bishop Tobin is truly as concerned about the third-world primitives from South of the Border, let him open the Church coffers. Sell of those priceless antiques, that hoard of gold and precious stones the Vatican has in its coffers   &mdash;   at AUCTION! Using the proceeds to help the primitives. Instead of telling us hard-working citizens and taxpayers it&rsquo;s OUR responsibility!</p>

			<p>&#8220;Providence Bishop Thomas Tobin asked for a blanket moratorium on immigration raids in Rhode Island until the nation adopts comprehensive immigration reform. Tobin made the requests in a letter sent Tuesday to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Boston.&#8221;<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t there an understanding in the United States   &mdash;   one that has kept the peace for two hundred years   &mdash;   that church and state will observe mutual respect and keep out of each other&rsquo;s business? Doesn&rsquo;t Bishop Tobin know that?   Or does he want to have a return to the religious wars and persecutions that took place in Europe, precisely because church and state there couldn&rsquo;t agree to keep out of each other&rsquo;s business?</p>

			<p>Am I the only sane person who would love to confiscate the evil Catholic and Christian churches who sell out to invaders, sell the churches and their property, and give the proceeds to the American people who lives have been cheated by those perverted idiots?  I think not.</p>

			<p>The Bishop needs to go to another country instead of using  church for fronting violation of USA immigration laws.  Send him the bill for all the anchor babies.   V</p>
