			<p>
				We have selected some of the best articles from American Renaissance. Click on any linked heading to read more about the following subjects:
			</p>
			<h2>
				<a href="/about/rg-philosophy.html#philosophy">The Philosophy of Race Realism</a>
			</h2>
			<p>
				What we call race realism is what was considered traditional common sense until perhaps the 1950s. It is a body of views that was so taken for granted it had no name, but it can be summarized as follows: That race is an important aspect of individual and group identity, that different races build different societies that reflect their natures, and that it is entirely normal for whites (or for people of any other race) to want to be the majority race in their own homeland. If whites permit themselves to become a minority population, they will lose their civilization, their heritage, and even their existence as a distinct people.
			</p>
			<p>
				All other groups take it for granted that they have a right to speak out in their own interests. Only whites have lost this conviction.
			</p>
			<h2>
				<a href="/about/rg-iq.html#iq">Race and IQ</a>
			</h2>
			<p>
				One of the most destructive myths of modern times is that people of all races have the same average intelligence. It is widely accepted that genes account for much of the difference in intelligence between individuals, but many people still refuse to believe genes explain group differences in average intelligence. This blindness leads to futile attempts to eliminate &#8220;learning gaps&#8221; between the races and forces whites to accept the view that if blacks and Hispanics are less successful than whites, it is because of white &#8220;racism.&#8221;
			</p>
			<h2>
				<a href="/about/rg-consciousness.html#consciousness">Racial Consciousness</a>
			</h2>
			<p>
				Racial loyalty or racial consciousness is normal and healthy. All non-white groups instinctively pursue their own interests, and legitimately so. It is only whites who have been taught that it is immoral to take even the most basic steps to ensure their survival.
			</p>
			<p>
				AR has published several key articles on the significance of racial consciousness as well as studies of how people of various races express that consciousness.
			</p>
			<h2>
				<a href="/about/rg-history.html#history">History</a>
			</h2>
			<p>
				For anyone brought up on the cartoon history taught in American schools, it is a surprise to learn what really happened in the past. The egalitarian left unabashedly distorts history in the name of orthodoxy. It is our job to resurrect the truth.
			</p>
			<h2>
				<a href="/about/rg-accounts.html#accounts">First-Person Accounts</a>
			</h2>
			<p>
				Some of the most powerful writing in AR is by ordinary people describing their everyday experiences with non-whites. Each of these accounts &mdash; which could never be published in a mainstream publication &mdash; is a compelling story about the continuing tragedy of multi-racialism.
			</p>
			<h2>
				<a href="/about/rg-law.html#law">Race and the Law</a>
			</h2>
			<p>
				The legal framework of the United States has changed almost unrecognizably with regard to race. School integration, &#8220;civil rights,&#8221; racial preferences, the franchise &mdash; all have evolved in ways that undermine the ability of whites to lead their lives as they wish. The record in this area is a triumph of ideology over common sense, justice, and the Constitution.
			</p>
			<h2>
				<a href="/about/rg-crime.html#crime">Crime and Disorder</a>
			</h2>
			<p>
				When there is demographic change, the entire texture of life changes. One of the most obvious consequences of an increase in the black population is an increase in crime.
			</p>
			<h2>
				<a href="/about/rg-science.html#science">Science</a>
			</h2>
			<p>
				Race realists have a great advantage over those who push egalitarian orthodoxy: We accept what science says about race and genetics, and are eager for further discoveries. The more progress science makes the more secure our positions become.
			</p>
			<h2>
				<a href="/about/rg-immigration.html#immigration">Immigration and the Demographic Transformation</a>
			</h2>
			<p>
				The single greatest threat facing whites is mass immigration of non-whites into white homelands. If it continue, whites will become a minority in the United States before mid-century. Britain, Canada, and Australia will also lose their white majorities. The culture of the West will not survive the disappearance of the people who created it.
			</p>
			<h2>
				<a href="/about/rg-realism.html#realism">Race Realism in a World Perspective</a>
			</h2>
			<p>
				In every white nation it is only a minority that recognizes the crisis we face and fights for national preservation. A number of European countries, which are not hampered by slogans like &#8220;we are a nation of immigrants&#8221; and that do not have slavery to apologize for, are defending themselves better than we are.
			</p>
			<h2>
				<a href="/about/rg-reality.html#reality">The Reality of Race</a>
			</h2>
			<p>
				It has become fashionable to argue that race is some kind of sociological illusion and not a valid biological classification. No one really believes this any more than he believes that the differences between Dachshunds and Saint Bernards are sociological rather than biological. Still, the reality of race is a basic point that must occasionally be made, and AR has published excellent articles to refute this silliness.<br>

				Although I was familiar with Jared Taylor and his book Paved with Good Intentions (early 90s) from his appearance(s) on The Bob Grant Show and National Review (of all places) I had lost touch with him and did not know of AR. It was through reading a Front Page article/seminar led by a liberal black woman, Carol Swain, who rightfully worried about the overbearingness(?) of liberal race activists that I learned of this website. It may be too late as it is beyond Sick and Getting Sicker but I&rsquo;m am extremely grateful to have this site to peruse each day Monday through Friday, except holidays (excepting MLK Day-lol).

				This might be a good place to make one request of the editors. I peruse American Rennaisance on public access computers, and wish that noose with the &#8220;Jena 6&#8221; story weren&rsquo;t displayed so prominently on the homepage for everyone to see as I look thru things.
			</p>
			<p>
				Yeah, yeah&hellip; freedom of speech and all that. But as a white guy, I have no rights in public places. If a library employee or ordinary member of the public takes offense, I&rsquo;m toast.
			</p>
			<p>
				It would be nice if the homepage were a little more nondescript.

				I have noticed that there a lot more comments on a daily basis in the last several weeks, by looking at the comment tally number. I think the reason why is named O-B-A-M-A, and the racial reality of dispossession finally sinking in to whites. Note that &#8220;Why Obama Will Win&#8221; on July 25 has 200 comments, the highest number of comments for an amren.com post in my recollection.
			</p>
			<p>
				Therefore, AR has a lot of new eyeballs.

				Since this is a how-to article, when do subscribers normally expect to receive their monthly magazine, specifically the electronic PDF format?
			</p>
			<p>
				I subscribed back in May, but I have not been able to determine when I should expect each month&rsquo;s issue. I received my May issue on 6/11 and my July issue on 6/15. It&rsquo;s 8/1 and I have yet to receive the August issue which has been posted on AR for at least a week.
			</p>
			<p>
				I&rsquo;m a newbie to AR, but an old grunt to the cause. This post is excellent for people like me. I just want to know if my subscription info somehow fell through the cracks. Otherwise I look forward to the next issue.

				Is this an indication that traffic to the website is increasing? Informally I have noticed an increase in comments. I also looked at Alexa.com and their traffic ranking but these show a decrease. I&rsquo;m not entirely convinced by that. It&rsquo;s generally difficult to tell whether the word on WN is getting out sufficiently. My sense is that it is, just from talking to people, noticing the increase of stories in the MSM and the comments on their sites, which even on such sites as SFGate and Washington Post is sometimes overwhelmingly in our favor on some stories (taking into account multiple posts). But sometimes it seems that I&rsquo;m at a football game played in a fog, sitting at one end zone and getting to see only the opposition scores. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m the only one who&rsquo;s waiting for the half to end so we can switch goals.

				The problem is that although we still have &#8216;free speech&rsquo; in America, we do not have 1.Power 2. Media
			</p>
			<p>
				Another problem is irrifutabilty. As Jarad Taylor has shown, even a well-&#8216;educated&rsquo; Canadian College Professor cannot argue with facts, or statements by Taylor, he can only spout pre-conceived notions of how the world &#8216;should be&rsquo; according to a leftist elite well well paid, (overpaid?) college professor.
			</p>
			<p>
				Political Power, media power, and the constitution. We have 2 of the 3, and the third is getting in their way.<br>

				First-Persons accounts are the strongest evidence on the impact ofnon-white immigration on White Americans. I highly recommend that you set up something very similar to what Brenda Walker has on her website. Brenda Walker has a Victims Wall. Since many more people visit this web site there would be a much longer list of pain and suffering caused by post-1965 non-whites. Next time some asks :&#8221;where is the evidence that post-1965 non-white legal and immigration harms Native Born White Americans&#8221; refer them to the American Renassaince Victims Wall. The horror stories told by Native Born White Americans are the most important and irrefutable empirical evidence against post-1965 non-white immgration. If OUR enemies do not accept this evidence, debate over.
			</p>
			<p>
				Jared, American Renassaince should be the place where Native Born White Americans-thousands of them-can tell their horror stories with post-1965 non-whites. Vdare.com should have had a victims wall years ago. I can not over emphasize the importance of having a victims wall.<br>

				Very nice. I hope to see this site expand further. For example:
			</p>
			<p>
				1. More audio content, as it becomes available. Perhaps some material from the earlier Amren conferences.<br>
				2. A place where readers can leave comments on subjects other than recent news stories.<br>
				2. A top ten reading list.

				The new Reader&rsquo;s Guide is convenient and rich source of links to informative articles in back issues of AmRen. It&rsquo;s especially good for a novices who need to catch up on realism. Very good idea, AmRen webmaster.
			</p>
			<p>
				The archived news stories are also a good source of information on events that support essays found in AmRen plus other realist websites and books. It could be better if:<br>
				- There was a link on the top left hand side menu to mtnews/date.php and news.php.<br>
				- Reader comments were restored to stories before 2008. They are missing for 2007 and earlier. Some of the most insightful comments were left by readers which could be useful to anyone interested in having a thorough understanding of a particular topic.

				Some say that the purpose of language is communication. But I think it is more accurate to say that language functions by coordinating behavior. And even more precise to say that language functions by controling behavior.<br>
				One of the oldest modes of behavioral control through language has been Shame and Guilt. From this perspective Politcal Correctness is very old-fashioned because Shame, Guilt and Sentimentality are virtually their ONLY modes of communitcation and behavioral control. When this spreads and is continuously reinforced the result is an incredible cultural incoherence.<br>
				The only way to resolve this incoherence is through language. But language that is designed to confront Reality, not build a wall that seperates us from it.<br>
				This, for me, is the difference between Political Correctness and the Realism Movements, whether Race Realism, Immigration Realism, or, as I like to put it, Social Realism, if you will, which takes into account the place where the Individual (the crowning acheivment of Western Culture) is first Socialized, ie; The Family.<br>
				The Realists are as interested in &#8220;control&#8221; as the PC gangs are, but with an important difference. They simply want to control everyone, whereas the Realists merely want have better control over their own lives as they encounter an ever present, indifferent, and unyielding, Reality.<br>
				But you can&rsquo;t do it alone. That is why sites like AR are so valuable and important. It might not be what everyone wants in a site, but that&rsquo;s to be expected. For me, it&rsquo;s as solid as a rock. One of the most exciting things about AR is the quality of theory and writing, whether from Mr. Taylor or Rushton and Levin and Lynn, and how that translates in the urgency, the immediacy, of those of us posting from the frontlines, so to speak. When one reads the comments, as I try to as often as possible, it becomes clear that the problem of Race today is no abstraction. It is a real problem effecting real people. I can&rsquo;t imagine life today without the Internet, and for me, that is almost synonymous with sites like AR, VDARE, Nicholas Styx, and many others. It&rsquo;s easy to take something for granted instead of taking the time to express ones gratitude. So, I&rsquo;d like to correct that, for today at least, and tip my hat to Mr. Taylor and the folks at AR for the service they provide, and that we desperately need.<br>

				Bogus. We need to close down non-white special interest groups, and end the appeal of racial consciousness, at the same time we vigorously form our own.

				I have been reading American Renaissance for several years now and have subscribed to their newsletter for about 3 years. It is from this website that I have learned the disparaging way in which the media, both tv news and newspapers report crimes. There have been several serious, horrendous crimes against whites that have never made it to mainstream news media outlets. If published in newspapers, the story usually ends up buried on the back pages.
			</p>
			<p>
				Just a year a half ago, in Knoxville, 2 white young people were kidnapped, taken to an apartment and brutally raped and tortured for 4 days before they were both murdered. A small report of the crime appeared on page 5 of the Johnson City Press and there no reports on our local news. Since Knoxville is only 2 hours from Johnson City, where I live, you would think that it would at least make our local news stations. It didn&rsquo;t.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, over the weekend, a white man walked into a Unitarian Church in Knoxville and shot 5 people, killing, I believe 3 people. He left a letter saying he didn&rsquo;t like the church&rsquo;s liberal views, marrying gays, etc. The article said he would probably be charged with murder and a hate crime. Where was this story - the front page of the newspaper and then yesterday, a follow-up article on a memorial service that was held to remember the victims - where did the follow-up article appear - the front page of the newspaper.
			</p>
			<p>
				It was only from Amren that I learned of the Witcha massacre that took place several years ago in Kansas. The only news outlet that carried a story about the crime, was The O&rsquo;Reilly Factor and only once.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you want to get a true account of what is going on this country, regarding race and immigration, this site is the place to go. It is probably one of the few where you will get the true facts.
			</p>
			<p>
				I recommend Amren very highly and glad for the time and work that it&rsquo;s writers and editors have put into it.

				Follow-up.
			</p>
			<p>
				This article has prompted me to take another look at the Amren site, and I see that one of my suggestions above has actually already been implemented &mdash; audio selections from previous conferences are available in the &#8220;AR Attic&#8221; section.
			</p>
			<p>
				So this leads to some revised suggestions:
			</p>

				1. Highlight additions to the website in a mini-section before the news starts. <br>
				2. Since those AR Conference speeches are truly excellent, perhaps they deserve a more grandiose name for their location than &#8220;AR Attic,&#8221; which is very modest and easy to skip.

				3. Since many corporations block the Amren site from company computers as part of their mind control programs, we could have a mirror site that contains everything on the Amren site, but with a different URL. That URL name might have to change every few months, but it would allow us to access Amren from the office without being flagged by the Thought Police. (Maybe something as simple as www.amren2.com, www.amren-mirror1.com, etc.)

				What I would love is a weekly audio (or video) segment hosted by Mr. Taylor.
			</p>
			<p>
				Instead of Mr. Taylor trying to find someone willing to give him air time, Mr. Taylor would be free to speak out on any subject. As the host, he could have his own guests and be the interviewer and not the interviewee and the victim of a setup or attack. Mr. Taylor could announce the guest and subject a week in advance and people could submit questions. After each broadcast, people could post their own comments.
			</p>
			<p>
				If they were video, they could be on youtube, ipods, zunes and passed around and shared with the whole world. As much as we might want people to read more, modern media is video. AR should embrace the technology.
			</p>
			<p>
				It would be great to have a forum that was pure and uncensored American Renaissance.
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr. Taylor, please give this serious consideration.<br>

				I highly recommend that you set up something very similar to what Brenda Walker has on her website. Brenda Walker has a Victims Wall. Since many more people visit this web site there would be a much longer list of pain and suffering caused by post-1965 non-whites. Next time some asks :&rdquo;where is the evidence that post-1965 non-white legal and immigration harms Native Born White Americans&rdquo; refer them to the American Renassaince Victims Wall. The horror stories told by Native Born White Americans are the most important and irrefutable empirical evidence against post-1965 non-white immgration.

				This site has been a boon to my mental health. <br>
				I have read Vdare for years, and hopped around to different sites now and then. I don&rsquo;t know how AmRen got by me all those years &mdash; I became a regular reader earlier this year, starting posting just a few months back (my cat was sitting beside me, so &#8216;kitty&rsquo; seemed an appropriate screen name, lol).
			</p>
			<p>
				I enjoy reading the site (and everyone&rsquo;s posts) daily and hate when Friday comes around! <br>
				This site helps me realize that I am not alone &mdash; and it gave me a name for what I have been for many years &mdash; a racial realist!!<br>
				Like I said, it&rsquo;s been good for my mental health &mdash; a good outlet. The topics discussed here are not the kinds of things you can talk about freely in society with repurcussions.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thanks to all who keep this site going.<br>

				The reason why comments for stories are not kept indefinitely is that the database gets too huge, which means that moderators (I am one of several moderators) must wait an intolerably long time to accomplish basic functionality on the blog&rsquo;s comment moderation system. Before the decision was made to delete comments older than a certain age, there were around 210,000 stored comments.

				This is the only place I can go to share observations of multicultural indocrinations and forced integrations. I never bought the idea of sameness in races. I have always observed the differences. Even when I work and associate with other races I notice different communication lapses, different moral attitudes &amp; beliefs. The most outstanding differnce is vocabulary and the limited ability to transfer thoughts in English. Similarities are mostly physical. The differences in living are marked. I do not buy the idea that socioeconomics has valid cause/effect in the differences. V

			</p>
			<p>
				One commenter above, &#8220;kitty&#8221; mentioned how it has benefitted her in the mantal health area. I could not agree more &mdash; for so many years I had so much inner conflict over what I&rsquo;d been trained and browbeaten to believe about history and about race issues.
			</p>
			<p>
				After getting on the internet, and especially since finding American Renaissance and observing Jared Taylor debating various Marxists, along with reading the precious comments of so many of our astute and brilliant participants, I can only say that my inner conflict has lessened significantly and I feel so much better about my deeply held convictions.
			</p>
			<p>
				I, too, no longer feel so isolated and uncomfortable about ideas and thoughts that go counter to the politically-correct liberal dystopia of this age.
			</p>
			<p>
				I&rsquo;ve even begun to openly challenge certain workplace conditions and so forth, with varying degrees of success &mdash; but the fact is that enough evidence of victory has encouraged me toward the sense that many, many people are simply waiting for someone to stand up and say &#8220;enough!&#8221;

				Well, actually, though I have to say that I admire your determination, when you&rsquo;re at work, you&rsquo;re at work. You&rsquo;re not supposed to be reading anything no matter what the site.<br>
				And, if you have a job that allows you time to read, as some of us do, then simply print the stuff at home or at a local Cyber and bring it to work.<br>
				On the other hand, even in that case, if the PC Police are as diligent in crushing Freedom as we are in defending it, then they could still make problems for us.
			</p>
			<p>
				In one sense we are in the position of the Cultural Heroes of Western Europe during the beginning of the Enlightenment. What these men saw was that if the Enlightenment was to succeed it must remain, at least in part, undercover.<br>
				This is NOT cowardice, it is common sense. But more importantly, it is a basic pattern of behavior. Just as a thinker must have the appropriate time and space to develop an idea so that he doesn&rsquo;t have to continually defend it before it&rsquo;s ready. In that case he will engage in contention, and the worst kind, sincere contention. &#8220;Worst&#8221;, because emotionally, he knows he&rsquo;s right, but intellectually he can&rsquo;t deliver, yet. And they can (the PC Gang), but ONLY because their explanation of the world is over-simplified to the point of being simple-minded. And, being corrupt, they have no shame. Having no shame, they don&rsquo;t hesitate to convert their simple-minded view of the world into an absolute truth to be blindly obeyed - BY US! And we, quite sensibly, don&rsquo;t want to. THAT is the source of our conflict with them - about everything. But, because they have control of the levers and buttons, so to speak, they can, and are, making problems for us. Lord Acton&rsquo;s &#8220;Absolute Power corrupts absolutely&#8221; is true, but NOT because of Power. It&rsquo;s true because it&rsquo;s a case of Power operating in the realm of the Absolute! Power, properly understood, as it almost never is, is merely the ability to exercise Self-Responsible Authority. It&rsquo;s what is meant by the words &#8220;Individual&#8221; and &#8220;Adult.&#8221;<br>
				So, until we take the power back, as the expression goes, then we will have to do our level best to avoid the rather unhappy, and unhealthy, Children in power today.

				My suggestion, reach the college kids! The aging hippies teaching at the colleges love their precious people of color because they lack social lives, have a sense of entitlement and make good shrieking activists. Is it beyond Amren to find one or two students at each university to pass out flyers or leave them somewhere? Anything even vaguely pro-white is likely to become major news at any of our Stalinist universities.

				Our Normandy Beach are the &#8220;readers&rsquo; comments&#8221; sections on on-line news articles. I&rsquo;d like to see quick and easy links so those of us here can inundate reader&rsquo;s comments in appropriae MSM stories. People who wouldn&rsquo;t ordinarily come here read those comments.

				What I find incredible about the way some people view Am Ren. and other internet sources as being racist and therefore,illegitimate as a source of information, blows me away. I often check other sites which I won&rsquo;t mention, that are described on internet links as &#8220;serving white racists.&#8221; Why are they characterized exclusively as such, when one reads them and finds that all they do is identify who committed what crime, which is something the so called &#8220;legitimate&#8221; MSM hides.
			</p>
			<p>
				In other words, the MSM purposely keeps people ignorant. Now the ancient Greek philosopher Plato said, &#8220;It takes all of our knowledge to make the truth simple/obvious&#8221;. Why shouldn&rsquo;t citizens interested in the truth be able to check ANY site they want for information that is purposely not reported at the so called &#8220;legitimate&#8221; sources? It doesn&rsquo;t mean that one wholeheartedly agrees with every thought on those sites.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I was in high school, the Soviet News Agency TASS used to be critized for leaving the Russian people in the dark, because of selective/slanted reporting of the news. Now we have the Main Stream Media doing it here, in the service of social engineering like the Soviets were engaged in. These social engineers are an abomination; what gives them the right to &#8220;guide&#8221; supposedly free people? We need all of the facts, to form a valid idea of what the truth is.

				Hello. I am the 8:59 PM poster.
			</p>
			<p>
				At the time of writing this reply, there were 23 comments on this story totalling about 20K characters. So, averaging and doing the math, 210,000 comments amount to about 20 MB of plain text excluding non-displayed data. That is tiny in terms of file size, and nothing but plain text data type too. It can&rsquo;t be a hardware issue. So if you are experiencing severe performance problems &#8220;to accomplish basic functionality on the blog&rsquo;s comment moderation system&#8221;, then it&rsquo;s probably some inadequecy with the software. Maybe it&rsquo;s an antiquated system that tries to unnecesarily display a non-filtered list of all 210K comments in open and closed topics at the management interface each time.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am uncertain what you are using in terms of CMS, app server and database or whether you have your site externally hosted. But perhaps you could research other tools. This could be a place to start:<br>
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog_hosting_service" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog_hosting_service</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				You might consider converting to a forum with original postings restricted to moderators which would effectively make it a blog. The nice thing about this alternative is you can have a different section for registered user initiated topics.<br>
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Internet_forum_software" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Internet_forum_software</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				Hopefully the comments have been properly archived and one day we will see them restored.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you are considering upgrades, one thing I&rsquo;d really like to see in reader comments is for other readers to vote on comments. Then sort the comments according to positive responses. THE BRILLIANT COMMENTS CAN THUS STAND OUT. THIS WOULD BE VERY USEFUL FOR A RESEARCHER. It also can allow comments to be semi-moderated by allowing readers themselves to vote which ones are alerted to moderators as offensive or otherwise not worthy of being displayed. I am seeing more and more of these features at other sites so it must be in some of those blog and forum softwares.
			</p>
			<p>
				Best wishes on your website upgrade initiative.

				American Renaissance Man Jared Taylor, considered by many to be a front runner in the first draft of the Race Realism Hall of Fame, will get partial credit for turning back the red tide of socialism that almost overtook America in early &#8216;08. In addition to being a lightning rod for White people the world over, he has been able to damage the MSM while undercover. Great job Amren and when obama loses this fall I will lift many toasts indeed to my fellow Amreners.

				Those people that search for and post the news story on a five day a week basis are different from the moderators. AFAIK, the former category know how to moderate, (and do when the need arises), and are familiar with AR&rsquo;s standards, but moderators cannot create &#8220;posts&#8221; (i.e post a news story). My guess is that any reforms here will involve keeping the dichotomy between news posters and moderators intact.
			</p>
			<p>
				Moderators can obviously send news URLs to the webmasters. This moderator has done so several times in the past.
			</p>
			<p>
				AR.com is a formal weblog, it just doesn&rsquo;t happen to look like the quintessential blog. How you can tell that it is a blog is that it has an RSS Feed. If you use Mozilla Firefox, you&rsquo;ll see the RSS symbol in the URL location bar, toward the right side.

				I&rsquo;ve read this theory&hellip; in 2 works, one on black interests, and the other on feminist theory&hellip; the feminist book notes that the world was a paradise of peace and plenty, until the day men discovered they contributed to the baby making process, and wherever they discover this fact, the society becomes a heirarchy and oppressive, to both man and beasts. The black interest book notes the same thing, that every place on earth experiences peace and plenty, until it encounters the western value system. In other words white man are responsible for all evil in the past, and evils continuation in the present.
			</p>
			<p>
				I don&rsquo;t think the writers were being serious, but they pretended to be. If you look at the statements being made by the minority interest groups, and by the diversity establishment, and the media, if you look at all the information as a whole, and not individually, that&rsquo;s exactly the statement that&rsquo;s being made, white men are responsible for all evil in the past and it&rsquo;s continuation into the present.
			</p>
			<p>
				There is no alternative viewpoint. You either go along with it, to one degree or another, or you disbelieve/resist to one degree or another. There are rewards and punishments for picking either side. There are all kinds of rewards for going along with this viewpoint (perhaps I&rsquo;m showing my age here).
			</p>
			<p>
				Steve Sailor has pointed out, that whites farthest up the economic scale, or more filled with hope, are more likely to accept this diversity idea. They don&rsquo;t really believe non-whites will be taking their jobs.
			</p>
			<p>
				Those lowest on the economic scale are more likely to resist. I think this is also, not mainly but at least partly, cause and effect. People who believe like us AmReners (and don&rsquo;t have the right support) do, don&rsquo;t get very far. There are certainly a high percentage of posters who seem to have unconsciously accepted Marxist ideology as a starting off point (that could be for a number of reasons), so perhaps my opinion is wrong.
			</p>
			<p>
				I think AmRen needs to try and be more mainstream and integrated into society more, for the younger readers out there (keep posting my views of course).

				I&rsquo;ve never bought the idea, that before 1950 whites were racially conscious. Oh, I believe they may have been less anti-white than they are now, but &#8216;racially conscious&rsquo;? Callously unconscious may be a better word.
			</p>
			<p>
				It has been an unconscious white supremacy idea that has kept whites from seeing the dangers they face.
			</p>
			<p>
				And for the last, who knows, maybe forever, outward &#8216;white supremacists&rsquo; have been so obnoxious they turn people away from race realism.

				Dedalus said &ldquo;when you&rsquo;re at work, you&rsquo;re at work. You&rsquo;re not supposed to be reading anything no matter what the site.&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
				That is a ridiculous statement. People arrive at work early, and leave late, and have many breaks during the day. It is completely common and acceptable for employees to use the internet to read new about news, business, sports, or whatever else interests them during the work day.

				I have been reading this site for several years now. I stumbled onto it and it put to &#8216;pen&rsquo; what I had been thinking for awhile. I was glad to see I wasn&rsquo;t the only one out there!
			</p>
			<p>
				I have a couple suggestions&hellip;
			</p>
			<p>
				First, when you clicked on a story, the story headline used to stay highlighted even after you left the story and site. This was helpful to me to come back to stories for many reasons. Maybe you could do this again?
			</p>
			<p>
				Also, it would be great to help folks get the word out. A previous poster thought finding a couple college kids at each college would be good to hand out flyers, host meetings, etc. Great idea!
			</p>
			<p>
				How about expanding this to include folks in each local voting precincts? We really need to work on getting people involved at this level to take back control of our parties and our country. This is a great way to do it. I am running for my precinct committe chair position next time. I hope to win!
			</p>
			<p>
				Thank you all for a job most well done. What you do makes a huge difference to us all.
			</p>
			<p>
				I leave you with your quote from above: The culture of the West will not survive the disappearance of the people who created it.

				One thing I like about AR is we&rsquo;re united only in unlearning the lies about Race. We have no ideolgy. You don&rsquo;t have to believe anything here; just go round and round in our collective heads, trying to understand what we can know about race, and what we can&rsquo;t know. What we can do about it (a political program) may be left mainly to a future time when we&rsquo;re stronger. Confucius said, &#8220;Wisdom is knowing what you can know, and what you can&rsquo;t know.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				Our role is to be iconoclasts, smashing ideas in the mind about race that get a free ride in our time.

				Gentlemen,
			</p>
			<p>
				The other day I was reading the Columbus Ledger-Enquirer and found it amazing that the editorial letters pictured a Dr.Drew and named him the &#8220;father of the blood bank&#8221;. Said his, &#8220;credit was over due&#8221;.
			</p>
			<p>
				I quickly checked our AR website as i knew the info did not seem right. I corresponded with the correct info found at AR.
			</p>
			<p>
				My letter was published (un-edited for once) and was titled &#8220;Do not give credit where it is not do&#8221;.
			</p>
			<p>
				All i can do is battle at my door step. Thanks for the info. Oh, yea my door step reached thousands of others.

				&#8220;This might be a good place to make one request of the editors. I peruse American Rennaisance on public access computers, and wish that noose with the &ldquo;Jena 6&rdquo; story weren&rsquo;t displayed so prominently on the homepage for everyone to see as I look thru things.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				I&rsquo;ll second that. The noose image on my screen makes me jittery when accessing the AmRen web page.
			</p>
			<p>
				P.S. Thanks to Jared Taylor and all the contributors, for all their erudite and accurate analysis and commentary on how race informs the future of American society. I once stumbled onto Wilmot Robertson&rsquo;s &#8220;The Dispossessed Majority&#8221; from the 1970s, and it is a great book. Mr. Taylor now carries that torch.

				I&rsquo;d also like to second the sentiment that Mr. Taylor should be making regularly scheduled &mdash; preferably WEEKLY &mdash; speeches on Youtube. For an example, here&rsquo;s one of a series called &#8220;Chapin&rsquo;s Inferno&#8221; by Bernard Chapin from mensnewsdaily.com. (Chapin usually addresses men&rsquo;s issues, but this one&rsquo;s about the book &#8220;Liberal Fascism&#8221;):

				No production values, no budget, not even any editing. Just set up a video camera &mdash; and Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s intelligence, eloquence and charisma will take care of the rest.

				1. More audio content, as it becomes available. Perhaps some material from the earlier Amren conferences.<br>
				2. A place where readers can leave comments on subjects other than recent news stories.<br>
				2. A top ten reading list.

				I agree with this poster, particularly as to a place where comments can be left. I just finished reading the book &#8220;Coloring the News&#8221; and would like a place to leave a comment. A bulletin board or whatever it was called would allow us to be more of a community than just as individual posters to current articles.
			</p>
			<p>
				Amazon.com has a great section where posters can put up a question or a statement and invite comments.
			</p>
			<p>
				I want to thank Jared Taylor for what he does. I have my copy of &#8220;Paved With Good Intentions&#8221; that he autographed for me in Coral Gables, Florida years ago. <br>

				If we&rsquo;re suggesting improvments to the site, might I suggest a dating and singles section? Consider that whenever Amren posts an article about the low birthrate of whites, or posts news of that &#8220;Quiverfull&#8221; family that has a baby every 18 months, the responses are instantly split down the middle, with hostile men blaming women for not doing the same, and indignant women blasting men for being too immature to even consider them marriage-material, let alone stay married long enough to have enough children to reach replacement.
			</p>
			<p>
				I&rsquo;ve mentioned this before, and I&rsquo;ve gotten enthusiastic emails which support my idea. Amren has credibility; those few other sites that say that they are whites only are filled with fake ads, trolls, and moles. Also, they are just downright frightening to look at: confederate flags, SS&rsquo;s, and swastikas galore! I&rsquo;m turned off by all those things, and I&rsquo;ll bet so are 98% of the people who go to that site, hoping to find someone special. Another poster here once said that it must be drilled into every single one of us here that our business must be &#8220;squeaky clean&#8221;. No links to Stormfront, no use of foul or &#8220;racist&#8221; language. Just normal white people who believe in the preservation of our race, and understand that families, children, and white communities are top priority.<br>
				There is a major market here, and Amren could seriously lead the way. Just imagine if a site was launched that led to matches, marriages, and most importantly, new children. Imagine the American Renaissance convention with a wall-sized collage showing all the children born from Amren-readers who met and married!

				I think American Renaissance is a great platform for articles and news dealing with diversity, immigration and ethnicity issues. The possibility to write comments below these (news) articles is not of a less importance than the articles themselves, because it allows to exchange thoughts, insights and ideas with other readers.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, there is still space for improvements. My suggestions are the following:
			</p>
			<p>
				- As someone already stated before, comments of earlier articles should reappear for the reasons described above. I can´t imagine that pure text is consuming so much (digital) space. If it will still be causing a deacceleration of site speed, I have another suggestion: To offer a download of all published news/articles including the comments for each year, in a compressed space-saving format.
			</p>
			<p>
				- I would like to see Amren conferences to take place more often and in different locations. One conference within two years is too less in my opinion. One conference per year would be better. Perhaps some conferences could be held in central USA, since it would make traveling more convenient for those living in the West/South/Midwest/North?
			</p>
			<p>
				- The suggestion of having a Singles sections coming from Anglokraut is one of the most constructive from my point of view. Why not? I guess there aren´t so few readers and commenters here who are singles and who wish to find a partner who is family conscious and aware of his/her race/ethnicity?<br>
				But, as Anglokraut said, this section should have no associations with Nazi-, 14/88-, swastika-sites, communities or whatever&hellip; It has nothing to do with Amren-philosophy, and it would alienate level-headed readers.

				This site and Amren have been a great source of understanding for me. A kind of &#8220;Grand Unificaton Theory&#8221; of social ills. I heard Jared Taylor on the radio in Baltimore while visiting there. I had learned over the years that blacks just could not keep up with other groups. Any normal thinking person can&rsquo;t help but notice that white areas and towns are by and large well run and crime free, and that black areas are to be avoided; in an unspoken way. Yeah, we know the black areas are screwed up, but we can&rsquo;t mention it.
			</p>
			<p>
				It just came to me that race and the low IQ&rsquo;s of blacks, along with other inate characteristics were responsible for the destruction of the cities and the cause of white flight. I learned that those who really love blacks live far from them, and that the poor working class whites who really harbored ill will towards blacks were simply acting on personal experience.
			</p>
			<p>
				If one examines the problems facing American society, it is obvious that these problems are the result of what I and others call &#8220;negritude&#8221;, that special black way of interacting with their envirionment. The mortgage crisis? I know, I tried getting black people loans for houses I rehabbed. It was obvious ten years ago that loans were made to blacks who would clearly default. Urban sprawl? Just whites fleeing the crime in the streets and schools that blacks bring. The draft? The military got rid of it right after Vietnam, the first war fought with a fully integrated force.
			</p>
			<p>
				I have also learned to be a stealth racialist. Pick your time and place to mention race, or else the brainwashing will kick in and you be subjected to a hysterical outburst.
			</p>
			<p>
				I have come to believe the South Africans had it right, that living apart from them is the only answer. Of course so do 95% of white Americans(and 10% of the blacks), but they won&rsquo;t admit it. I do now, thanks to AmRen.

				I have been a fan of Jared Taylor&rsquo;s writings since October 1992, when I saw an employee shelving &#8220;Paved With Good Intentions&#8221; in the New Non-Fiction section of a chain bookstore. I looked at Taylor&rsquo;s photo on the back of the dust jacket, read that he was educated at Yale, and skimmed the book, assuming it would be filled with predictable mass-media liberal cliches. What a mindblowing surprise! I had NEVER come across a white writer who had the courage to present a pro-white point of view. Too many Ivy League educated white writers are mealy-mouthed and neutered when it comes to the issue of race. (Many blacks view whites as cowards.) Here at long last was a white MAN taking a forceful stance against the conventional wisdom on race relations. After skimming through different chapters in the book for about 30 minutes, I decided to buy 2 copies, one for myself, and one as a lending copy.
			</p>
			<p>
				It wasn&rsquo;t until late 1995 when Dinesh D&rsquo;Souza&rsquo;s &#8220;The End of Racism&#8221; was released, that I learned Taylor had a monthly magazine, American Renaissance. Although D&rsquo;Souza intended to put AR down, he inadvertently advertised its existence. I subscribed to AR in January 1996, and have been reading it ever since.
			</p>
			<p>
				Too many pro-majority organizations and websites play into the hands of anti-racist organizations with swastikas, confederate flags, and poor quality, self-indulgent, juvenile writings. AR, Occidental Quarterly, Kevin MacDonald&rsquo;s website, and VDARE are the few sites I visit because they are professional and serious. Only dignified material can reach a thinking audience.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the article &#8220;Twelve Years of American Renaissance&#8221; (from the November 2002 issue of AR) Jared Taylor states &#8220;For some, AR has been a lifeline.&#8221; YES! It&rsquo;s good to know that I&rsquo;m not alone feeling the way I do. That&rsquo;s good for my mental health and morale. It&rsquo;s good to have an online community that talks back to orthodoxy and gives political correctness the punch in the mouth that it deserves. Keep it up!

				I am a Korean guy currently doing his undergraduate in Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada, it has been a little big longer than a year since I started reading AmRen.
			</p>
			<p>
				and I mostly answer questions, especially questions related to East Asia. It is not very often when I express my opinions. There are a lot of compliments regarding East Asians, but I would still read AmRen even if there were no compliments regarding East Asians. If you have any questions regarding East Asia, post your question in any thread in AmRen!! I will read and answer to my best knowledge. Even if it is not regarding East Asia, I will answer to my best knowledge. It has been quite a few years since I left Korea but of course I can provide some information.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sometimes, I also read hilarious stories in AmRen such as when a man in Texas tried to cash in 360 billion dollars in order to fund his record company named Fulla Comp and Entertainment

				If it&rsquo;s slowing down the system, then by all means ditch the older reader comments. For me, AmRen.com is a reference source, not a place to read what others used to think about something. When I need to quote an article, the comments are useless to me &mdash; it&rsquo;s the original article that&rsquo;s important. As a matter of fact, I&rsquo;m thankful that AmRen.com has a news section at all: It would still be my most important source of racialist information even if it did little more than provide back issues of American Renaissance on-line. Collecting and posting all those news stories, and then moderating the comments, has to be a huge job. I hope that NCF is getting more out of it than mere traffic.

			</p>
			<p>
				Maybe. But here are the reasons why, other than just posterity, news and their comments should not be ephemeral as you suggest, indeed be streamlined going forward.<br>
				- By offering an outlet for participation among like minded people and being the only interaction possible at this website, it builds a community. Not only is this connection to other people important to readers, AR gains by having a loyal following.<br>
				- It would be nice if one was able to be reminded of stories or somebody&rsquo;s comments that made a particular impact on one&rsquo;s transformation to a realist, what made one a consummate AR reader.<br>
				- Some of the comments have brilliant analysis which could be valuable if one needed to quote an article, as you say you may need to, and then elaborate upon it.
			</p>
			<p>
				To expand on the third point, here is one example involving our Jared Taylor. As early as last year, there have been some commenters who suggested that an Obama presidency would act as some sort of inoculating pathogen long before Jared Taylor&rsquo;s <a href="/news/2008/07/why_obama_will_1.html" rel="nofollow">&#8220;Why Obama Will Win&#8221;</a> was published on July 25, 2008. Irrespective of when the idea first occured to whom, the point is that some &#8220;ordinary&#8221; readers&rsquo; comments could make their way into the thoughts of &#8220;professionals&#8221; who write for AR, VDARE, Brussels Journal, Occidental Quartery, etc. Possibly even mainstream media.
			</p>
			<p>
				Given the advanced age, experience and reasoning skills of the average AR readership, a properly categorized, intact archive would give a researcher, writer, speechmaker or would-be activist a precious reference library to access the collective wisdom represented by comments on any given topic to which they pertain. Collective wisdom is not disposable.
			</p>
			<p>
				And as I mentioned in a previous post on this page, it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt going forward if comments could be rated by fellow readers so that a resource limited researcher could rectroactively read the most salient ones per story notwithstanding all passed the moderator&rsquo;s quality filter in the first place.

				To any new readers, I&rsquo;m not a White nationalist at all and I have some serious differences with the movement. I&rsquo;m a race realist though. Not everyone on here is a WN. There are also just race realists and even some antis now and then. One thing that is really cool here is the straight up talk about race that you find here. There is quite a bit of nonsense on this site, but there is a much greater amount of more or less straight up undiluted 100 proof truth and race and ethnicity that you can&rsquo;t find anywhere else in our media. That&rsquo;s why I like to come here. Ppl here tell it like it is!
			</p>
			<p>
				Another nice thing about this site is, whatever the politics of the posters, there are a LOT of *really smart* people on here, and quite a few darn good writers. And I&rsquo;m just talking about the commenters. I always learn stuff, just about every time I come here. In our dumbed-down culture, how many places can you say that about.

				Anonymous Moderator: Seems like you need to upgrade your server or upgrade your database. Depends on which database you are using. The db itself is probably not the problem. The problem is probably more on the server end in terms of memory, CPU and hard drive I would think, but then I&rsquo;m not a networking guy. You should probably talk to your webhost about this. There is no reason whatsoever per se that a large number of comments would automatically slow down a website. They will only slow down a site that does not have enough CPU, memory and hard drive to power the database. Vast websites run on MySQL, which is probably what Amren is using. These db&rsquo;s do not necessarily have any size limit. The problem is only money, whereby to power more comments in the system, you are going to need to spend more on the hosting end for CPU, memory or hard drive.
			</p>
			<p>
				For anyone who is interested: This site gets 20,000 visitors a day minimum and maybe more. That&rsquo;s quite good for a website. I only get 1,300/day on my site.

				That is a ridiculous statement. People arrive at work early, and leave late, and have many breaks during the day. It is completely common and acceptable for employees to use the internet to read new about news, business, sports, or whatever else interests them during the work day. </i><br>

				Not at all. It is certainly NOT ridiculous to some posters who have lost their jobs for that very reason. We have had posters here who were actually fired because of this. I am not defending the practice, but only saying it is quite common for organizations to regulate what may be accessed on THEIR computers &hellip; whether you&rsquo;re on your own time or not. If you like your job and want to keep it, it&rsquo;s not a wise thing to do, as some posters have learned to their grief. It all depends on YOUR organization and its rules. Those rules do not apply everywhere. It is definitely not &#8220;common or acceptable&#8221; in some organizations that I know of.

				Your harsh criticism of Dedalus is unfair in this regard. He had an excellent point.

				Oh, incidentally, Amren is often blocked in public libraries, hotels, and on other public-use computers &mdash; - the reason being that it contains &#8220;hate-based&#8221; or other &#8220;objectionable material&#8221; (so they say). This is were such a strategy as recommended could be useful.<br>
