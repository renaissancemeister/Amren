<h1>Kilpatrick Will Spend Night in Jail</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>M.L. Elrick and Joe Swickard, Detroit Free Press, August 7, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Judge Ronald Giles sent Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick to jail moments after the mayor pleaded for forgiveness and admitted he made an unauthorized trip to Windsor on city business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first day you were before me, I thought I made it clear to you that this court comes first in everything,&rdquo; Giles said. &ldquo;I do understand that you&rsquo;re under &hellip; pressure &hellip; but I have to look at how the system should be run and perceived by the public.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the beginning of this case you were given every privilege that could be given to you with regard to travel,&rdquo; Giles said, adding that he later imposed restrictions after learning Kilpatrick had been abusing his privileges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At that time I made it perfectly clear &hellip; don&rsquo;t come back &hellip;,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Giles revoked Kilpatrick&rsquo;s $75,000, 10% bond and ordered him jailed.</p>
<p>Sheriff Warren Evans said Kilpatrick was being booked in to the jail shortly before 1 p.m.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Giles&rsquo; comments came after Kilpatrick told the judge he had been living under incredible pressure for the past 7 months.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that there is a person that&rsquo;s ever been through this process that respects it more than I do,&rdquo; Kilpatrick said, referring to the legal proceedings stemming from the eight felonies ranging from conspiracy to perjury to misconduct in office to obstruction of justice filed against him in March.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last week was a tremendous wake-up call to me,&rdquo; he said, referring to Giles&rsquo; rebuke last month after he allegedly assaulted law enforcement officials trying to serve a subpoena.</p>
<p>Kilpatrick admitted violating the terms of his bond by traveling to Windsor without notifying the court. He said he was sorry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My life has been revolutionarily transformed and it&rsquo;s transforming in front of the eye of these media people who don&rsquo;t know me at all,&rdquo; he said, referring to what he called intense scrutiny. &ldquo;Your honor, I ask for your forgiveness &hellip;  it will never happen again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said his sons were watching these proceedings because he asked them to. &ldquo;I told them that I did something wrong,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Kilpatrick further said he was not &ldquo;frolicking&rdquo; in Windsor, but trying to make a deal that would let him avoid laying off more than 1,000 city workers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Assistant Wayne County Prosecutor Robert Moran said the mayor&rsquo;s pleas rung hollow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that he&rsquo;s caught, he&rsquo;s taking responsibility &hellip; he thought he got away with it,&rdquo; Moran said.</p>
<p>Prosecutors had argued before Kilpatrick addressed the court that the mayor was not taking the case against him seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The defendant left the state of Michigan, left the country, without prior notice to the court,&rdquo; Moran said, referring to a recent trip to Windsor. &ldquo;All you have to have him do is call me &hellip; he has my cell phone, he can call me anytime &hellip; we would never say the mayor of Detroit cannot travel for an emergency matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moran said he found out about the trip from the media.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a flagrant violation of this court&rsquo;s order,&rdquo; Moran said. &ldquo;At the very least we are going to ask the court to cut off all travel to the defendant &hellip; for business or personal, because he violated the very generous terms that this court has set up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Thomas acknowledged that the mayor violated the terms of his bond, but said it was an emergency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was dying?&rdquo; Giles asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The City of Detroit was sick,&rdquo; Thomas said, adding that the mayor was trying to save a $75-million deal that would help balance Detroit&rsquo;s budget.</p>
<p>Last month, Giles put new restrictions on Kilpatrick&rsquo;s travel after Wayne County law enforcement officials accused him of assaulting them as they tried to serve a subpoena. The judge also revoked the mayor&rsquo;s personal recognizance bond and required him to post $7,500 cash to remain free.<br>

			<p>In other words, America&rsquo;s first Hip Hop Mayor is going to the place where all good hip hoppers wind up going.  Now that he&rsquo;s actually in the gray bar hotel, his street cred will go way up.</p>

			<p>Hip Hop Hooray!  At least for one night, anyway.</p>
<p>Notice how the national media OMITS the part where &#8220;Hizzoner&#8221; screamed anti-white epithets and obscenities at the detective (and at the black female who accompanied the white detective on official business) as he knocked the man off the porch, apparently breaking the detective&rsquo;s hip? (See the article posted on AmRen from July 26th)</p>
<p>No double-standard of reporting in the MSM, of course&hellip;</p>

			<p>I am humbled at some of the intelligent commentaries that are on amren. For my piece of the action, this article is a prime example of the dumbing down of the United States. How did this appalling, whatever, get into office? How brutally disrespectful to his people and all other examples like it. affirmative action must be and commanded to be removed for all time. thank you Mr Taylor for this assume opportunity.</p>

			<p>If you or I did what Kwame has done we would be in jail until the trial, not just overnight.  But that&rsquo;s how it goes when you are King of Detroit.  He really needs to be replaced but does not have the decency to step down because if he can hold on to the mayor job until November, he can pick up a retirement pay of $180K per year for life.  That is the permanent bling ticket at taxpayer expense that he so wants.  If he doesn&rsquo;t get it, look for him to have some kind of meltdown and accuse white people of &#8220;lynching&#8221; him.  He has only himself to blame. <br>

			<p>The judge is white.  </p>
<p>On the video, as Kirkpatrick reduced himself to near begging and offering ghastly compliments to the judge hoping his childish attempts at scamming him would keep him out of jail, I wondered if he was so dense he didn&rsquo;t understand that the obvious anti-white hatred he spewed so vigorously a few days ago made a stark contrast to his groveling before a white and lent an incredulous air to everything he had to say.</p>
<p>If this is one of the best blacks have, it&rsquo;s no wonder they can&rsquo;t succeed on their own.  How utterly pitiful.</p>

<p>How does winning an election fall under the heading of &#8216;affirmative action?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Any any event kudos to the black policewoman and the (most likely) black judge in doing the right thing even though they will be called every type of &#8216;sellout&rsquo; and &#8216;white lover&rsquo; the other blacks can think of.</p>

			<p>Normally, a bond revocation would result in a defendant being jailed until trial.  In my own case, I was held without bond and fought my case out for 17 months from behind bars.  </p>
<p>With Fitzpatrick&rsquo;s attitude, he will naver last on parole once he finishes his sentence - the perjury case is open-and-shut.  Federal &#8220;supervised release&#8221; is less strict than state parole - it is really just probation, as any federal inmate sentenced after 1986 must serve all of his sentence - there is no federal parole anymore.  I was still required by law to maintain employment, even if it meant taking fast-food work.  I was required to provide a complete financial statement every month, and individually account for any expenses that ran over $500.  I was required to provide notification if I would be away from home more than three days.  To leave the state, I would have needed permission.  I was required to provide urine samples on demand, even though I had never used illegal narcotics.  When I wanted to take Davron painkillers prescribed to me after I wrenched my back, I took the bottle to my P.O.&rsquo;s office and asked permission before using any of it.  She photocopied the label on the bottle and put it in my file.  I was forbidden to have any contact with any previously-convicted felon.  I was required to report any contact with law-enforcement officials, such as the time I received a warning for driving 43 in a 40 zone (it was the beginning of the school year, and police here crack down on speeders then).</p>
<p>On parole, Fitzpatrick will have conditions like these, but in addition be forbidden to drink alcohol or enter any place where liquor is served or sold.  I think he&rsquo;ll last between six months and a year before he goes back to prison.  Judging by his own behavior, I just don&rsquo;t think he has the self-discipline.</p>

			<p>Given the incredible history of big-city black mayoral and congressional buffoonery in this country, it&rsquo;s truly remarkable that we may soon have a black president.</p>
<p>Truly, whom the gods destroy they first make mad.</p>

			<p>There&rsquo;s one thing we can all be grateful to Fitzpatrick for: his will be an interesting chapter in the book about America&rsquo;s black mayors/governors.  Of course the book will constantly have to be added to - but such a book will make fascinating reading, especially the last chapter comparing their deeds/behaviors with those of African rulers.</p>

			<p>Now that he&rsquo;s out of jail, Michigan AG Mike Cox has just charged Kwame Kilpatrick with a slew of new felony charges.</p>
<p>https://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080808/NEWS01/80808033</p>
<p>This Cox is a pretty good guy.  He was the only prominent Michigan Republican to come out for MCRI in 2006 (and thus was the only prominent MI-R to win.)  He&rsquo;s very good on immigration, and now we see he has the racial courage to put &#8220;America&rsquo;s First Hip Hop Mayor&#8221; in the sling personally.</p>
<p>Methinks we&rsquo;re looking at the next Governor of Michigan.</p>

			<p>The MSM reported this morning that Kilpatrick had spent Thursday night in a one-man cell with no TV.</p>
<p>The horror&hellip; THE HORROR! No cellmate to pester, and no TV to watch. For a whole night!</p>
<p>To a black man, that must constitute &#8220;cruel and unusual punishment&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Detroit is trying to sell its side of the Detroit-Windsor tunnel to a private company. To foreclose that from happening, the Windsor city counsel has offered to purchase it instead. The Detroit city counsel is the one balking. Maybe de mayor should instead be visiting with them?</p>
