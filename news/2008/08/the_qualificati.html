						<p>Is being black hurting Barack Obama in his run for President?</p>
<p>Well, something is hurting him, because he&rsquo;s not where he should be in the polls. Given the unpopularity of Bush and the state of the economy, a Democratic candidate should have a much larger lead than Obama&rsquo;s current spread of 3% over John McCain in the Real Clear Politics average of all polls.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Obama&rsquo;s problem with race goes much deeper than that small slice of the public that&rsquo;s adamantly against a black President. Obama, as a black man, is particularly vulnerable to a challenge to his qualifications.</p>
<p>Unqualified blacks getting into high positions reminds some white voters of the worst stereotypes of affirmative action.</p>
<p>Even the mere mention of affirmative action is so powerful that it can activate white prejudice. In a national split sample of white voters, half of the sample was asked their opinion about affirmative action prior to being asked a short battery of standard questions about prejudice. The other half was assessed on prejudice first. Whites who merely heard the phrase &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; first were more likely than other whites to think that blacks were violent, less intelligent and lazy.</p>
<p>This is why the McCain ads that focus on Obama&rsquo;s short résumé are so brilliant. While only a small portion of the white electorate is unwilling to vote for a qualified black candidate, a much larger percentage of whites resent it when they feel blacks are getting promoted faster because of race.</p>
<p>If the Republicans can subtly portray Obama as an affirmative-action nominee, McCain could well be our next President.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Still, ads about qualifications hurt Obama more than they would a white candidate, because they remind some white voters of affirmative action. That&rsquo;s simply how white opinion works on this issue.</p>

			<p>I see. There&rsquo;s such a thing as &#8216;white opinion&rsquo; now. I guess it&rsquo;s Ok for whites to have an identity when it&rsquo;s sufficiently grounded in dastardly deeds. </p>

<p>Besides reasons that have to do with AA, many whites are reluctant to vote for a black candidate because they know that the vast majority of blacks always favor their racial kin, but, even worse, there&rsquo;s fear among these same whites that they will fare badly under a black, because they rightly perceive he dislikes them, especially after viewing the Jeremiah tapes so many times.</p>

			<p><i>Unqualified blacks getting into high positions &hellip;</i></p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s exactly how did Obama get where he is now: &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; type of &#8220;scrutiny&#8221; that gives him, and undeservedly so, the benefit of doubt of about everything, even against the (inconveninent) evidence.</p>
<p>This is going in definitely wrong direction, folks. When times are tough as they are these days, when our country and nation are under siege and fierce storms test the strength of ship America, it&rsquo;s imperative that we elect the best of the best to the Oval Office. We must not try to replicate in presidential nomination process the &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; idiocy that has already been plaguing the process of hiring of American workers and impeding the economic and technological progress; the idiocy that resulted in outsourcing of high paying jobs and transfer of our national intellectual property to countries that don&rsquo;t preach diversity but reward meritorious achievement, instead.</p>
<p>Playing a &#8220;race card&#8221;, a &#8220;gender card&#8221;, or any other similar &#8220;card&#8221;, creates a deadly threat for entire nation and should be avoided at all cost. For otherwise we may end up electing a mentally retarded person, quoting the American with Disabilities Act as an excuse, a practice that is currently quite common at many American universities and colleges that quite often award degrees in math and sciences based not on student&rsquo;s knowledge and intellectual capabilities but on his/her learning disability. (No, I&rsquo;m not kidding).</p>

			<p>Ironically, at the Saddleback Church forum last Saturday, Obama said he wouldn&rsquo;t have picked Clarence Thomas for SCOTUS, because Thomas was too inexperienced.  Obama tried to say that C.T. rose too quickly through the ranks because of affirmative action.</p>
<p>Pot kettle black.  That coming from the man who had all of 140 some odd days of work in the U.S. Senate before he declared candidacy for President.</p>

			<p> Do Barack Obama&rsquo;s slender qualifications remind people of &#8220;the worst stereotypes of affirmative action,&#8221; or of the worst facts of black officeholders? Incompetency, corruption, nepotism   &mdash;   you name it. Name me a city, state or country run by blacks and I&rsquo;ll show you one that is being poorly run   &mdash;   almost certainly as a dictatorship, in the case of a country.</p>
<p>  Would the Republicans be using the same attack mode against Obama if he were White? No   &mdash;   because if he were White, his extreme positions and lack of a resume would mean that he would be treated as a joke by the media. A White Obama, all other things being equal, would self-destruct. The black Obama may have started to do just that   &mdash;   but the mainstream media hope to hold him together just long enough for him to eke out a narrow victory in November. </p>

			<p>Maybe the answer is to visualize OBAMA as embodying the WORST KIND OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION   &mdash;   using that as an excuse to vote AGAINST him in November. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong&hellip; I despise McCain and Hillary Clinton fully as much as I despise PHONY OBAMA. But either of those have experience and skills that leave Obama in the dust.</p>
<p>I can vote FOR McCAIN as the lesser of evils and will probably have to do so. But with luck, perhaps illness or whatever will force him to retire EARLY in his administration   &mdash;   and ideally a much more intelligent, more qualified V.P. will step into the breach before too much damage is done our country.</p>

			<p>&#8220;If the Republicans can subtly portray Obama as an affirmative action nominee&hellip;&#8221;  </p>
<p>This is typical of the establishment press.  Neither Republicans nor anyone else need to &#8220;portray&#8221; Obama as our first affirmative action presidential nominee; rather, we should REVEAL him as the affirmative action nominee that he is.  </p>
<p>Obama has indeed received preferential treatment, not just from &#8220;the mainstream (left-leaning) media,&#8221; but from the so-called &#8220;alternative media&#8221; of &#8220;conservative&#8221; talk radio. At least this was the case during the Democratic primaries when one right of center talking head after the other was gushing over what a &#8220;nice guy&#8221; Obama seemed to be, and commending him for positioning himself, not as a &#8220;black candidate,&#8221; but a candidate &#8220;who happened to be black.&#8221;  Even if he wasn&rsquo;t the front runner then, he was a first-tier candidate who, as such, deserved sharper scrutiny.  There was no white Democratic candidate on whom they would have been so soft. </p>
<p>That Obama secured his party&rsquo;s nomination after all that was revealed about the radical character of his friends, especially his &#8220;spiritual mentor,&#8221; the anti-white, anti-American Jeremiah Wright, again shows that there is a double standard for white and black candidates. </p>
<p>Obama IS our first &#8220;affirmative-action&#8221; nominee. And I believe an increasing number of people are beginning to wake up to this fact.  This is a primary reason why Jared Taylor is mistaken and Obama will lose big in November. </p>

<p>This may be a bit off topic, but your comment reminded me of something that I saw at my local supermarket a couple of years ago. They had a bagger who was obviously retarded. He had a very dull look and was almost expressionless. He was a White man, by the way. It took him forever to bag the groceries, but I would always wait patiently. I felt sorry for  him. </p>
<p>Well, one day I got out of my car and as I was approaching the entrance to the supermarket, I had to wait for a car to pass. Guess who was driving?! Yep, you guessed it, that retarded man who could barely bag groceries. How, in the name of God, did he ever get a driver&rsquo;s license? Talk about a road hazard!</p>
<p>I swear, this government would rather see 100 die than hurt the feelings of one retarded person. Truly, the inmates are running the asylum.   </p>

			<p>its not obamas fault. look around folks, its your white freinds, you know the ones you see on tv behind obama looking at him like he is some kind of a saint, who are the problem. start drawing battle lines now and let your freinds and relatives know, in no uncertain terms, of your displeasure of them for supporting obama. start ostracizing the race traitors amongst us. if obama becomes president, i will personally end all freindships forever and always with any white person, friend or family etc, who i know voted for him. and i will further let them know why. this [position will be etched in stone.i ask that you all do the same.</p>

There is a very important piece of information in this article for the Amren &#8220;movement&#8221; (race realist movement).</p>
<p>It is that people suppress their true thoughts about race relations, but that thinking about affirmative action makes them so irritated that those true feelings come to the surface.</p>
<p>Any future efforts to win converts should make use of this.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if there are statistics that measure laziness but there certainly are studies/statistics that measure violence and I.Q.  They consistently show blacks (as a group) to indeed be more violent and less intelligent.</p>
<p>As for the mention of AA bringing out negative feelings toward blacks.  Doesn&rsquo;t the mention of slavery bring out negative feelings, among blacks, toward whites?  I can already hear the leftists screaming, &#8220;how can you compare AA to slavery!?&#8221; &hellip;and I answer, &#8220;you&rsquo;re right; slavery was 150 years ago.

			<p>Here&rsquo;s some interesting information available online.</p>
<p>&#8220;His entire real world work resume.  6 weeks work in the Senate with nothing to show for it. Two years as a lawyer and only 14 minor trials.  And two years as a &#8220;community organizer&#8221; with nothing accomplished.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;He has only been a Senator for 18 months.  But with all the recesses, four day weekends, campaigning and absences, Obama has only spent about 6 weeks of workdays on the Senate floor as one of the most junior Senators.  Most of his votes, about 80% when he was not absent, have been &#8220;present&#8221; or &#8220;abstain&#8221;.  He also chairs a committee that has never met because the chairman has never called a meeting.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is sufficient proof that Obama is bought and paid for.  The problem of course is that McCain is owned by the same people.</p>

			<p>If the Democratic Party implodes (as a we may all hope it does)<br>
it will because of the leadership of Howard Dean. Dean has led the way on handing over the party of Truman and Kennedy to the Far Far Left. Dean is in my opinion mentally disturbed. His<br>

			<p>Barack Obama is the radical left&rsquo;s manchurian candidate. He hasn&rsquo;t revealed 1/100th of his intentions, when once in office, to erode America into a Federal Government tyranny, in which individual rights and property are constantly bled away and the Constitution goes the way of the Dodo bird. </p>

			<p>Something practical to think about&hellip; There are a million blog sites on the Internet. Including some run by TV stations like Houston TV station&rsquo;s KHOU.COM.  Look under the Local News drop-down. Then open a news story or two. Read the comments. Now sign up as invited and then after receiving your password, start writing comments of your own under appropriate stories. Making sure to throw the spotlight on Obama, whenever possible. Reminding people about his racist pastor and best friend, Jeremiah Wright and how it would have gone in the media, had McCain had David Duke as mentor, pastor and best friend.</p>
<p>We need to keep the voting public REMINDED of what Obama is like; what he would be like for America. Using the various blog sites is easy enough. BUT be civil. Be careful in phrasing, in your choice of words. Do not appear to be insulting Obama. But GET VOTERS THINKING!</p>

<p>Lucky me I was home from work today and while channel surfing spotted Noel Ignatieff on C-Span. On this show:<br>

<p>the guests referenced study after study showing the &#8220;guilt&#8221; of whites such as police profiling or medical discrimination (this was brought up this vile woman-https://www.commentarymagazine.com/viewarticle.cfm/medical-apartheid-by-harriet-a  &mdash;  washington-10878) but I did not hear anything about the negative effects of AA or how it is possible in this horribly racist society that Obama could actually be the front runner for Presidency. </p>
<p>&#8220;Average&#8221; whites can see the hypocrisy of Affirmative Action and know it hurts them. The problem is all the Professional Agitators, the Professional Race People who want to see the overthrow of our society. Hopefully more will wake up to the fact that half white Barack is firmly in the Anti-White, Anti-America camp. </p>

			<p>THEY should hold their heads down in shame. After all this time, after all the cash white America has thrown to them, they are still for the most part BOTTOM OF THE BARREL people. For the time that has passed, for them to still beg for SPECIAL HEP at every crossroad is a shameful look into the  window of who they really are. People come from around the world and thrive in America with little or no special help. The blacks fall behind everyone and anyone who is willing to work to get what they want. Few people lay on the street after a hurricane and moan &#8220;WE NEEDS HEP&#8221; without every lifting a finger to hep themselves. Breaking into stores doesn&rsquo;t count!</p>

			<p>Maybe, just maybe, Barak needs to be elected so that our brothers and sisters of European descent will wake up and see what is going on around them. If not, then by the year 2040 (U.S. census statistics), we are going to designate November as white history month. WE will be the minority.</p>

<p>Cheap shot Leo&hellip; they&rsquo;re descended from Africans. In other words, it&rsquo;s a genetic thing. You wouldn&rsquo;t understand. </p>
<p>Seriously now. Seems like ALL Africans fall into that bottom barrel category. Look at those magnificent countries between Cape Town north to the Sahara. Prosperous, industrial, happy, healthy   &mdash;   and forever brandishing their beggar bowls at the rest of the world.!</p>
<p>Those Africans who migrated to and are in the European nations&hellip; GUESS what people commit the majority of crime in their host countries. I&rsquo;ll make it easy for you if you can&rsquo;t guess the answer. With a hint or two.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I can already hear the leftists screaming, &ldquo;how can you compare AA to slavery!?&rdquo; &hellip;and I answer, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re right; slavery was 150 years ago. AA is happening right now, with living victims&rdquo;.<br>
Posted by jewamongyou at 12:02 AM on August 21 </p>
<p>Very good point.</p>
<p>I just might add that besides AA to point to as a present injustice against whites and one that is very real and not of the abstract variety,  black on white crime has been way out of proportion to white on black for the past many years and is a serious ongoing problem right now.  There is literally a one-sided black on white war going on right now, proving that it doesn&rsquo;t take two sides to wage a war.</p>
<p>Contrast all that with black complaints about a societal situation that ended almost 150 years ago and involved no one on the scene today, and it becomes very clear that black whining is really baseless and absolutely outrages when compared to the atrocities whites have endured and are still beset with right this minute, with every promise of getting worse every year.</p>
<p>If whites ever do wake up for whatever reason, the result will be earth shattering chaos.</p>

			<p>Obama is most certainly not the &#8220;affirmative action candidate.&#8221; What must &#8220;most qualified&#8221; mean to the typical liberal Democrat primary voter? It means having the wimpiest foreign policy, the most confiscatory tax policy and the most redistributive welfare programs. Even if Obama were white, he would still be the most qualified candidate by the standards of the Democrat party. Let&rsquo;s give credit where credit is due.</p>

			<p>Is Obama the affirmative action candidate?</p>
<p>What were his SAT scores - did he get an AA boost for college?</p>
<p>What were his LSAT scores - did he get an AA boost for law school?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing yes to both.  If there was an honest reporter we would have that data.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Even the mere mention of affirmative action is so powerful that it can activate white prejudice.&#8221;</p>
<p>That makes as much sense as the following: &#8220;Even the mere mention of Jim Crow and segregation is so powerful that it can activate black prejudice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Would any newspaper weenie ever attempt to publish that?</p>
