						<p>Some illegal immigrants arrested in workplace raids by federal agents will now have a resource to help them post bond and have a day in court.</p>
<p>The National Immigrant Bond Fund will launch a fundraising campaign and make its national debut during a news conference at Casa de Maryland in Silver Spring on Monday. The immigrant advocacy group helped workers seized in a recent federal raid in Annapolis access the bond fund, which was formalized about three months ago.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how the fund works: Illegal immigrants arrested in raids who do not have any outstanding criminal violations can apply for financial assistance. Churches, legal organizations or groups such as Casa help facilitate their requests. The fund provides half the bail money and immigrants must pony up the rest.</p>
<p>&#8220;The chance of somebody in essence absconding is by and large eliminated because they have their money invested in their freedom as well,&#8221; said Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum in Washington and a member of the fund&rsquo;s committee.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The fund grew out of a series of efforts by 57-year-old Boston financier Bob Hildreth, owner of International Bank Services Inc., which buys and sells loans worldwide.</p>
<p>Hildreth said he gave $130,000 last year to help detainees post bond after a raid at a New Bedford, Mass., factory by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. The detainees&rsquo; families pitched in $100,000.</p>
<p>Hildreth contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars more this year after following workplace raids, including one on June 30 at Annapolis Painting Services company, where federal officials arrested 45 employees on administrative immigration violations.</p>
<p>The financier studied Spanish in Mexico as a college student, and over the decades he has contributed millions to establish education and citizenship programs for immigrants in Massachusetts, among other initiatives.</p>

			<p>Aiding and abetting is no longer a crime. Nation of laws, exists no more. Because there is not a single enforcer of the law from the White House on down, that isn&rsquo;t on the enemies payroll. With apologies to Sheriff Joe, who still understands the Constitution, and his job description.</p>

			<p>Mr. Hildreth sounds like a true patriot, how can I contact him to express my gratitude?</p>

			<p>I wonder how the &#8220;politically correct&#8221; crowd would react to creation of a defense fund like the one described in this article for whites accused of hate crimes against the minorities? (Imagine the outrage if any organized effort to legally help those accuesed of Holocaust, or even Holocaust deniers, took place.)</p>
<p>As usually, the duplicity of anti-American &#8220;do-gooders&#8221; is blatant. Comforting and abbetting illegal aliens is a federal crime, so Mr. Hildreth belongs to jail as far as my opinion is concerned.<br>

			<p>  This guy Hildreth is a deadly enemy of anybody who wants to preserve their country and culture. He should be on some kind of &#8220;list&#8221;.</p>

			<p>The enemies within no longer have reason to hide.  They have full support from the elite aristocracy. If USA had real Constitutional leadership, those who fund aiding and abbetting would be prosecuted for such.  Both parties have served up empty suits so USA has no choice.  Sounds like USSR.  <br>
Using religious &amp; ethnic fronts to fund law breaking does not make it legal. (These groups are not far from AL Quida)They just use people instead of bombs.   The lines of laws have been blurred deliberately to disable distinguishing differences.    V</p>

			<p>Just another traitor and person who believes he is above existing U.S. immigration law. A criminal really, no different than the congresspeople, Senators, Chamber of Commerce, churches and others who have been violating existing U.S. law. They are all people showing disregard for the existing laws. They have a totally cavalier attitude toward the law. They are bringing this nation down to anarchy.</p>

			<p>I think this is great since there are no Americans in (deserving) need of help. All they have ever done is WORK, raise a family, and Love America. Why help them when there are so many illegals who would spit on us with a dirty hand out for a FREEBIE?</p>
