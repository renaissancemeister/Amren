						<p>A riot broke out and an officer was wounded in a neighborhood of Montreal where a young man had been shot and killed by police.</p>
<p>Several hundred police officers fanned out trying to track down an undetermined number of youths who began setting fires in the neighborhood late Sunday before running off.</p>
<p>Fire trucks arriving to fight the blazes in the borough of Montreal North were pelted with beer bottles, while bus shelters were trashed. People of all ages were seen looting computers, TVs and other items from stores.</p>
<p>Montreal police spokesman Ian Lafreniere said two police officers and an ambulance technician suffered non-life threatening injuries. One of the officers was shot in the leg. The ambulance technician was hit in the head by a Molotov cocktail that did not ignite.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Montreal North is a multiethnic borough where tensions between residents and police have simmered in the past.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The catalyst for the violence was the shooting by police on Saturday night of three people, including an 18-year-old man who died. The man, identified by his sister as Freddy Alberto Villanueva, died from his wounds in hospital.</p>
<p>The other two, an 18- and a 20-year-old, were listed in stable condition.</p>
<p>Montreal police said the officers were trying to arrest an individual in Henri Bourassa Park when they were surrounded by a group of about 20 youths.</p>
<p>A few individuals allegedly broke away from the group and rushed the officers.</p>
<p>According to police, one of the officers then opened fire.</p>

Until the &#8220;Blacks&#8221; began their periodic &#8220;burn down&#8221; of the Los Angeles  - Long Beach area, attacks against fire and rescue personnel were unheard of events. Apparently the word is spreading. &#8220;multiethnic&#8221; Canada is now learning what diversity is really all about. </p>

<p>These people don&rsquo;t need an excuse for mindless destruction. Even on the most tranquil of days, they actively destroy their communities. Claims of social injustice are a code for looting.</p>
<p>In this PC world, they will be excused and forgiven in a vain attempt to quell future blood lust. </p>
<p>These people are their community. This community is its&rsquo; people. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what you give them because they will destroy it. They can&rsquo;t help it because it&rsquo;s their nature.</p>

			<p>Key word: multiethnic. Of course in politically correct, off the deep end Canada, the MSM is not going to say this had any sort of racial overtones, but the truth might make it out eventually, and then the official party line will be that it was not race related in the slightest. Funny how those sorts of things never happen in all white neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Of course if some white boys had chased a Pakistani out of their neighborhood, it would make national headlines up there.</p>
<p>Alberto Villanueva&hellip;&hellip;..sounds like this crime might have occurred in East LA.</p>
<p>Heaven forbid! Canada does not have race problems.</p>

			<p>They were from Honduras and were a bunch of Hispanics. You should see the mayor of Montreal grovelling to them and basically blaming the police. He &#8220;shares the family&rsquo;s pain&#8221;. He is &#8220;determined to get to the bottom of the matter&#8221; He &#8220;is going to shed light on every detail of this matter&#8221;. He &#8220;has personally asked the minister of public security to identify the most effective way to ensure a transparent investigation can take place as quickly as possible&#8221;. And he &#8220;wants that investigation to be very well known and understood by the community&#8221;. Finally the good mayor wants the rioters to know &#8220;this is a group of people that are trying to tell us something and I am willing to listen&#8221;. </p>
<p> GOOD GRIEF! No support for the police. No condemnation of the arson and widespread thievery and looting. I guess when people torch your car and loot your store blind they are &#8220;tryng to tell you something&#8221;. This mayor of Montreal makes Neville Chamberlain look mild with his appeasement of these thugs.</p>

			<p>If one were to point out to these government types in Canada that they would have these very same problems, before these third worlders were imported, he would have been mocked as &#8220;racist,&#8221; which is exactly what happened.  </p>
<p>How many times have we pointed out to these types that the proven&hellip;.and natural&hellip;.consequences of continuing a program of societal fractiousness will eventually lead to Balkanization wherein the country is bound to split along lines of race and ethnicity in this country, Europe, and Canada?</p>
<p>And how many times has their response been accusations of &#8220;racist,&#8221; and the like for offerring that truth also?</p>
<p>Everytime, right?  So I propose just waiting, watching, and preparing with survival provisions, and oodles of armament, while continuing to gather other like-minded people around us, as we have been doing here on Amren, the CCofC, EAIF, and other similar orgs for quite some time now.</p>
<p>Our white opponents are naive, gullible fools who are brainwashed, indoctrinated dolts, or they just don&rsquo;t have the mental capacity to really grasp the enormity of the situation.  They&rsquo;re as much or more our enemies as any white-hating non-white.</p>

			<p>Montreal North is known as the &#8220;Haitian Quarter.&#8221;  </p>
<p>As well as the incidents listed above, cars were set on fire, as was a fire truck.  Looters stole proprane tanks from stores and proceeded to throw them into the flames causing explosions.  Guns were being shot off by the rioters as well.  These same rioters were challenging the officers to take off their protective gear. The article does not convey the absolute terrifying horror of what really went on. </p>

When are you folks going to learn that opening the gates to your country will lead to an influx of barbarians.  It&rsquo;s happened in Europe, USA &amp; Canada.  The wider you open the doors the more barbarians will flood in &amp; eventually overwhelm you. Wake up!!</p>
<p>You are going to lose your culture, your very way of life that the rest of the world envies will disappear under a cloud of third world violence.</p>
<p>Wake Up for God&rsquo;s sake.</p>

			<p>I read a brief piece on this in one of our Australian newspapers.  The article mentioned &#8220;Montreal police chief Yvan Delorme said he&rsquo;s prepared to do whatever it takes to mend the shaky relations between police and the community.&#8221;  I was absolutely disgusted upon reading this.  What is happening to the great nation of Canada?  </p>

			<p>This area of Montreal is rife with gangs, the unemployed and other low-life with criminal intent on their minds. If police try to crack down on the gangs then everyone there cries police harassment. Of course the area is home to many outstanding and law abiding Haitian and African &#8220;citizens&#8221;. Expect more problems from the area. </p>

			<p>This article doesn&rsquo;t mention the fact that one of the officers trying to make an arrest in Henri-Bourassa park was a female and that she was being choked when her male partner opened fire in defending her. Last night, CBC news interviewed the dead Villanueva&rsquo;s family, and all the boo-hooing began about how he was a, &#8220;good boy&#8221; who, &#8220;just wanted to go to school and make something of his life,&#8221; (sarcasm) no doubt an innocent victim of the racist, Montreal police. Anyway, the Surete de Quebec,(our version of the State Police), will be conducting an inquiry into the shooting instead of arresting rioters who caused hundreds of thousands of dollars damage, so, in the end it will be business as usual in the multicultural paradise of Montreal. </p>

			<p>Another example of people bringing their culture when they<br>
&#8220;relocate&#8221;. These felons should be immediately deported to the<br>
countries of origin, or be imprisioned in a remote location to<br>
get their attention. This type of violence has been escalating<br>
since the &rsquo;60s in So. Calif. Now the &#8220;new&#8221; trend is home invasion<br>
and they seem to target elderly. The MSM has not been very forthcoming in providing much information in these crimes.<br>

			<p>As a multi-generation White English-speaking Canadian I have mixed feelings about this. On the one hand I am genuinely sad that the once great and very safe city of Montreal has become overrun with third-world ethnics. ON THE OTHER HAND I can&rsquo;t help feeling a little bit of Schadenfreude at the Quebecois&rsquo; plight. What you HAVE TO UNDERSTAND about Canada is that it was the Federal Liberal party that was WHOLLY RESPONSIBLE for changing Canada&rsquo;s racial and ethnic makeup. And this party was always SOLIDLY SUPPORTED BY French-Canadians. It is NO EXAGGERATION to say that the Liberals would never have formed the governing party in Canada without the support of Francophones. As late as the mid-1960&rsquo;s Canada was 98.9% White. (Most of the rest, about 1%, were Aboriginals, with Orientals and blacks making up the most minute remainder). When I was young it was REALLY UNUSUAL to see anyone who was not White amd I live in Toronto the biggest city in Canada. (Toronto is now overrun with third world ethnics). It was the Liberal party that was responsible for all of this. In 1967 they totally changed Canada&rsquo;s immigration laws - without asking or consulting the Canadian people. Pierre Trudeau - overwhelmingly supported by Francophones - said &#8220;it doesn&rsquo;t matter where the immigrants come from&#8221;. It was the Quebec vote ALONE that saved Trudeau in the 1972 election when Anglo-Canadians utterly rejected him. Thus connect the dots. No French-Canadian support for the Liberals equals no Liberal federal government. No Liberal government, no third world ethnic invasion. It is all coming back on Quebec now.</p>

			<p>I have nothing against either Canada or the UK, but I confess to some Schadenfreude whenever they experience race-riots.  They were so very condescending towards Americans on racial matters back in the 1970s &amp; 80s, before they developed identical problems of their own   &mdash;   and with no one to blame but themselves, for learning nothing from our experiences.</p>
<p>Heh heh.  Riots in beautiful, clean, white Montreal.  Heh heh. </p>

<p>You&rsquo;re right. My uncle was a fireman in Newark, NJ, during the riots in &#8216;67. The blacks were shooting at the firemen trying to put out the fires. Shooting at unarmed rescue personnel was unheard of at that time. My uncle never had a good word to say about blacks after that. </p>

<p>You are right about home invasions in So. Cal.</p>
<p>The following, which took place in the SV Valley area of LA, was on the front page of the Daily News, which used to be the &#8216;conservative&rsquo; alternative to the decidedly leftist LA Times.  Unfortunately, the paper has been co-opted by those who wish to crush Whites, throw open the borders and re-create the failed Soviet Union workers&rsquo; paradise here in Cal. (and we are well on our way..):</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The blacks kicked in the door  &mdash;  only to come face to face with one of the couple&rsquo;s sons who was armed with a rifle and shot the intruder dead in the door&hellip;At least one of the sons&hellip;opened fire, hitting one of the intruders&hellip; The man died in the doorway, clutching a revolver&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>Exactly, when instead Canada, being so close to the USA, should have been looking, listening and learning from us. If they saw what it has done to our country, they could have avoided making the same mistake. Instead, they foolishly assumed the problems in the USA were due to &#8220;racism&#8221;. Now, through 3rd world immigration, they are turning their inner cities, what were once  beautiful, very low crime, and peaceful, into a replica of American inner cities. If they had only listened.</p>

I can remember when Canadians cities   &mdash;    clean, safe, and all white, were considered &#8220;boring&#8221; (by some Canadians).  &#8220;Toronto the Good&#8221;, they scoffingly said.  Just too damn Anglo, Christian, and white. They (certain elements) agitated to get more &#8220;diversity&#8221; to make the place more &#8220;vibrant&#8221;.

<p>Ha!   Well, they got diversity aplenty, and now they&rsquo;re vibrant all right!  Now they can live with it.</p>

Montreal has also put a premium of the French language over white. They have allowed French speaking Moroccans to flood their city. Their hatred for English speaking Canada could be their own death sentence.</p>

			<p>Was the guy that was killed was Black? NOOOOOOOOO. He was a Latino.  So why Blacks in Mtl-Nord are even  making a big deal out of this one as if the victim was Black. What happened is none of their business. </p>
<p>That just shows how non-whites aren&rsquo;t really concerned about promoting their respective races. They&rsquo;re just interested in one thing and that&rsquo;s teaming up together to declare war on the White man.<br>

			<p>The Quebec government invited the Haitians in back in the 1970&rsquo;s to &#8216;build the Francophone population&rsquo;.  </p>
<p>Now, most Quebecers would rather have pure Anglophones as neighbors, as long as they&rsquo;re white. </p>
<p>The Haitian invasian of Montreal north inspired the term &#8220;Bronxification&#8221;. </p>

<p>Ed:</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s only part of it.  They are looking for ANY excuse to foment a riot so they can LOOT local businesses.</p>
<p>During the 1992 riots in LA (I could see the pillars of smoke from my home) many (some papers reported the majority) of the arrested looters were hispanics who only saw an opportunity to smash and grab anything they could get their greedy hands on  &mdash;  they knew nothing about the riots, let alone Rodney King.</p>
<p>Later, of course, they blamed Whites for oppressing them and causing them to riot  &mdash;  including idiots on the City Council who called it a Civil Uprising after years of White opression.</p>

<p> It gave them an excuse to loot and steal. It gave them an opportunity to set fires and create some mayhem. It is their way of making themselves feel important. They get to cloak their vile actions in the veil of &#8220;legitimacy&#8221; because of the mantra of liberalism. Self-appointed, self-proclaimed, &#8220;community activists&#8221; get to go on television and be asked a lot of questions from reporters. Government officials talk (grovel) to them. What an ego trip for a bunch of blacks who would otherwise never be of any importance to anyone but themselves. </p>

			<p>&#8220;If they had only listened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;We did. But you kept telling us that racism is evil.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid you can&rsquo;t blame this on the US because in BOTH countries, the multicultural crowd trumpeted that racism is evil, even more so in Canada, which would look down upon the US racial problems. I also think what the OP meant was that Canadians(just like Americans) should not have listened to such people and found out the truth themselves.</p>

			<p>Also, the &#8216;Qubecois&rsquo; policy of importing hundreds of thousands of &#8216;Francophone&rsquo; blacks in an attempt to slight the &#8216;English&rsquo; (in a silly little inter-ethnic low intensity conflict), has back-fired big-time.<br>
Not only has it had a disasterous impact on crime etc, but recently a referendum on Qubecois independence was defeated by a small but significant margin.<br>
It turned out that the votes of the non-White minorities eagerly imported by the Quebecois were decisive in keeping Quebec in Canada.</p>

			<p>You reap what you sow. </p>
<p>Nations are built on, language, culture and race, meaning one language, culture and race.</p>
<p>Diversity is a pseudonym for communism; it has never worked since the tower of Babel (which was the first attempt of the new world order diversity) and will never work.</p>
<p>Racism means, we have a white problem, its a control word to keep the white spineless fools in line and it works because it has been placed in the minds of white people for a generation by propaganda and the media.</p>

<p>Well this isn&rsquo;t a surprise giving how some blacks consider anyone who isn&rsquo;t White or Asian to be &#8220;black&#8221;. Although we hear it less nowadays, it wasn&rsquo;t an uncommon thing in the 1990s to hear an African-American saying that East Indians, Hispanics, Arabs and even Italians were all part of the black race.</p>

<p>Not Asians?  I&rsquo;ve been told even quite recently that ANYONE who isn&rsquo;t white (100%)  is black.  According to them, you&rsquo;re either white or you&rsquo;re black, and there isn&rsquo;t room for anything else.</p>

And it&rsquo;s a code word for white replacement. It&rsquo;s only used in white places:   white neighborhoods, white jobs, white schools and white countries. It doesn&rsquo;t apply to other races.</p>

Huh, imagine that.</p>
