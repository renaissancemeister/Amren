<h1>No Apology From Gwinnett Superintendent</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>D. Aileen Dodd, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, August 25, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A meeting between the Gwinnett County Schools Superintendent J. Alvin Wilbanks and members of the Gwinnett branch of the NAACP apparently ended Monday in a stalemate.</p>
<p>Gwinnett NAACP branch president Jorge &#8220;JP&#8221; Portalatin said Wilbanks has refused to apologize for comments he made about the disproportionate discipline of minority students in Gwinnett.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Wilbanks refuses to acknowledge that his comments were offensive,&#8221; Portalatin said Monday in a statement. &#8220;His behavior today was condescending and he was clearly not open to constructive feedback.&nbsp;.&nbsp.;&nbsp;. The inability to see from others perspective and apologize is unacceptable in a leader.&#8221;</p>
<p>Portalatin said he would take up the matter next with Carole Boyce, the chairperson of the Gwinnett Board of Education.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Gwinnett&rsquo;s schools said Wilbanks had no comment about the meeting with the NAACP.</p>
<p>During a discussion two weeks ago, an administrator said the disproportionate discipline of minorities is a problem for school districts nationwide except in Idaho, according to a study.</p>
<p>Wilbanks then asked: &#8220;Do they have any blacks in Idaho? They don&rsquo;t have many.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilbanks has said his statements were not meant to be &#8220;racist&#8221; or &#8220;insensitive.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, the NAACP has asked for Wilbanks to apologize.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Portalatin has said that Wilbanks&rsquo; remarks at the meeting seemed to blame African-Americans for the disparity in discipline in Gwinnett instead of what could be the inconsistent application of the discipline penalties. Some Gwinnett parents have called for Wilbanks&rsquo; resignation.</p>
<p>Gwinnett school board members and colleagues of Wilbanks have defended him, citing his record of creating a diverse workplace at Gwinnett&rsquo;s schools and his reputation as a visionary in education who serves all students regardless of race.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are the standards for him?&#8221; Tillman asked. &#8220;If we can hold a child accountable for their actions, why can&rsquo;t we hold him accountable.&#8221; School board member Dr. Robert McClure has said Wilbanks was simply seeking more information about Idaho demographics during the presentation. Idaho had 272,058 students last school year and only 1.15 percent of them were black. School officials in Idaho, however, said race plays no role in discipline.</p>

			<p>This is crazy. </p>
<p>An administrator at the meeting mentioned a study which showed that minorities were disproportionately disciplined - except for in Idaho. </p>
<p>Wilbanks then asked a simple, honest question: &#8220;Are there any blacks in Idaho?&#8221; followed by a TRUE STATEMENT &#8220;There aren&rsquo;t many&#8221; (only 1.15% in fact)</p>
<p>And for THAT, they want him to be fired??? </p>

<p>Accountable for what?  Daring to speak the truth that is abundantly clear to anyone who is familiar with discipline problems that are caused by blacks at school systems across the entire country?  Refusing to be intimidated by the utopian socialist who have destroyed this countries schools and willfully harmed white and black students alike with 50 years of forced integration?  </p>
<p>As a native Georgian my guess is that one way or another they will force Superintendant Wilbanks out of the state.   He is guilty of thought and speech crimes against the tyranny of politically correct group think.  Once you suppress anyone who is brave or stupid enough to tell the truth we can all get back to worshiping at the alter of multiculturalism in peace.  By the way Georgia slipped down another place in the national ranking of average SAT scores this week.</p>

<p>Same argument is made with every state and federal prison in the USA. </p>
<p>If blacks are so great, why are they always, always at the bottom of the social strata? We arent that organized to keep them there forever, nor do we have that interest. </p>

			<p>  Bad Black attitudes about learning and &#8220;white man&rsquo;s learning&#8221; or studying being called &#8220;acting white&#8221; are to blame for much of the problem. All studies have shown that the blacks in most districts as punished more lightly than white students for the same offense.<br>
  Since the NAACP is certain that it is unfair application of discipline that is the problem why don&rsquo;t they start ALL Black schools run by the NAACP itself and teach black cultural norms which will help their students compete without preferences in the work place.</p>

			<p>I love these, stories about someone who not only said something politically incorrect, but subsequently refused to apologize.  It happens about once every year or two in my experience (which I admit is insufficient given such a long interval).  Consequently, when it does happen I get the feeling that the heretic must be a die-hard race-realist.</p>
<p>I wish more people would get the message; it shouldn&rsquo;t take a die-hard race-realist to refuse to apologize, given the fact that apologizing or backtracking actually seems to make matters worse (admitting wrongdoing only seems to encourage the swarm of insects that always attacks the politically incorrect, and never seems to have the intended effect of soliciting forgiveness).</p>

			<p>Sounds like Mr. Wilbanks may be looking for a job in Idaho. There are no answers to the diciplinary problems with African Americans. They are completely out of control and the situations are getting more visciuos daily, a reflection of life in the US today. <br>

  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -<br>
And this moron refuses to acknowledge the truth, and it&rsquo;s one of the reasons black students misbehave. They know there will always be someone around to make excuses for their bad behavior expecially if the person doing the complaining is white. And it looks like you can only be white and a &#8220;leader&#8221; if you&rsquo;re willing to grovel at the feet of blacks on demand.</p>

<p>It works both ways.  Gwinnett NAACP branch president Jorge &ldquo;JP&rdquo; Portalatin seems to have &#8220;the inability to see from others perspective&#8221; and, therefore, should apologize to Mr. Wilbanks.</p>
<p>When the &#8220;disproportionate discipline of minorities is a problem for school districts nationwide except in Idaho, according to a study&#8221;, it is highly likely that there is a good reason for that being so. And the reason is probably that minorities are disproportionately guilty of bad behavior.</p>

			<p>Bravo! If more whites stood up and spoke the truth without backing down it would be a great start. Keep fighting - don&rsquo;t let them try to twist things around with their &#8220;dim and senseless responses.&#8221; When confronted with truth and loic, they have no choice but to retreat to their tired and worn out blathering. Soon, real soon, it will not work anymore!<br>
The truth is like a tightly clenched fist - keep swinging. </p>

			<p>  The naacp is just another zit on the backside of this country. They should be the ones apologizing for all the trouble blacks cause everybody else. Wilbanks needs to hold his ground. Stand up to the racist black preachers of hate. BLACKS DO NOT DESERVE ANY SPECIAL TREATMENT. Unless somebody gets insensitive with these morons, they will continue to run rough shod over whites. That is the one thing you have to say for the mexicans, blacks try to run over them, and they get a boot in their collective behinds. Mexicans aren&rsquo;t afraid of blacks.</p>

			<p>Entirely predictable, of course  &mdash;  it all fits the Narrative. (&#8220;drink the Kool-Aid! Now! NOW!&#8221;).</p>
<p>I was hoping for a figure to admire in this &#8220;non-apologetic&#8221; Wilbanks guy, but the article claims, as counterargument, that he&rsquo;s actively promoted &#8216;diversity&rsquo;. Since he doesn&rsquo;t have an honest job, uh, I mean he&rsquo;s an &#8220;educator&#8221;, it&rsquo;s probably true.</p>
<p>And for predictably excrement-brained comments, you may find amusement here:</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s really disgusting that these black miscreants always try to obfuscate the discipline issue in order to force administrators to stop disciplining blacks, thinking that blacks might then stay in school longer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fact of life:  Where blacks are there is chaos, dumbed down studies, violence and crime.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it in a nutshell.</p>
<p>Only segregation will solve the problem for whites.  Blacks will always be beset with their black criminals, and they will continue to fail.</p>
<p>Doubt these truths?  Just take a look at Africa, and you&rsquo;ll learn all you need to know.</p>

			<p>It is of course very telling and vey predictable that the NAACP<br>
is more interested in an apology than looking into whether or not Mr. Wilbanks is correct. Could it be that thet already know that he is.</p>

			<p>They&rsquo;ll get him to back down.  Probably a behind the scenes death threat, or loss of job, etc.</p>
<p>But he shouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is how it&rsquo;s been for so long and how it will continue.  There is simply no let up.  </p>
<p>I wish this man luck.  But, I must say, I am SO glad I don&rsquo;t live in the United States anymore.  </p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Portalatin refuses to acknowledge that Mr. Wilbanks comments were true&#8221;</p>
<p>Apparently, the comment is &#8216;offensive&rsquo; quite independent of whether or not it is &#8216;true&rsquo;, and while the former is of sufficient weight that we can talk about firing the man who merely verbalized a well-known fact that is statistically valid across the USA, the latter is completely irrelevant, even though it is true.</p>

			<p>Yet another example of the alternate mental universe in which liberal blacks operate.  Instead of taking serious note of the superintendent&rsquo;s findings and necessary steps to correct the behaviors of unruly black children, as any educated adult presumably would, they attempt to humiliate and technically kill the messenger. As I&rsquo;ve said many times before, blacks are their own worst enemies, and this is but another indication of such.</p>
<p>To use a quote spoken by Golda Meir: &#8220;When they love their children more than they hate us, there will be peace&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Not going to happen, folks.  </p>

			<p>It is very hard to find a white man who will stand up and tell it like it is and not be bullied into submission by the racist NAACP.The liberal guilt pounded into whites from grade school up by the media and the politically correct crowd must be stopped.Every race should be proud of who they are and where they come from.Blacks stick together and whites do not.Without a change in attitude whites will not survive as a race and America will become just another third world backwater.I hope Mr.Wilbanks maintains his position.Maybe it will start a trend.</p>

			<p>A simple video camera in the classroom, which is probably legal, you could even &#8216;tell&rsquo; the students,black and white, they were on tape, would solve this issue rather rapidly, that is, you would have maassive amounts of blacks disrupting school classes. I&rsquo;ve already seen plenty insane school disruptions from blacks on PBS news shows. This is no secret, and its no secret how to deal with this problem.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s understandable that blacks don&rsquo;t get the point of Wilbank&rsquo;s question.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure Wilbanks is overly financially stable and taken care of. He has put in his time and he probably does have a good record. It&rsquo;s a shame that one has to wait until this point in life to state facts and add intelligent reasoning on a subject involving race. Yeah, freedom of speech. </p>
<p>Begging for an apology. How childish and pointless. It doesn&rsquo;t change what he said, how he feels, or what is the truth.</p>

			<p>As usual, I am blushing with pride at the intelligent and polite demeanor of your discussion of these issues. I don&rsquo;t have much to add except this: We(I&rsquo;m talking about those of us rational folks who frequent this site)constantly lament the decline of our culture, and we understand the cause, but rather than join together,and routinely support those people who have the courage to speak out, we continuously bemoan our state of affairs. I know that many of you from time to time beseech our other Amren followers to email the evil and praise the brave, but it needs to be more concerted - after all, our people do not have many champions (Mr. Taylor being one)to plead our case.<br>
I for one am boycotting television programs and companies that  misrepresent the truth about our societal situation. Money and fear are two of the strongest motivators for behavioral modification, and since most of us prefer the civilized approach, the appeal of greed may be an effective weapon. Look we have to do something!<br>
  I also try to contact and encourage those who speak out and who are invariably labeled as racist and morally inferior for their efforts. <br>
We know that we are in a crises. We owe it to our predecessors and our decendents to fight for our culture and traditions.</p>

			<p>The newspaper has not printed a single syllable that even hints that perhaps just possibly maybe there is some tiny chance the the disparity in punishment is related to a difference in behavior.  </p>
<p>And, despite what Portalatin says, Wilbank&rsquo;s Idaho comment does not raise the issue either.  Apparently Portalatin has difficulty understanding the English language.</p>
<p>Of course, Wilbanks SHOULD BE raising this issue.  If he doesn&rsquo;t he is not doing his job.  If blacks and whites are equally well-behaved, and there are disparities in punishment, then one course of action is called for.  If blacks are misbehaving more often and more seriously than whites, then another curse should be taken.    </p>

			<p>All students in the U.S. are fed the idea of black entitlement due to previous discrimination in the segregated schools of the South. But the reality is that a higher percentage of blacks learned decent educational and social skills in such schools than is the case now.</p>
<p>But the myth of the evil whites causing the present downtrodden situation of too high a percentage of blacks needs to be perpetuated as part of liberal dogma in the school system, and as white children become simply a minority among minorities in a country which has no majority school age population there is going to some threshold point at which white youngsters and their parents will wake up and realize that just as other minority groups need to play &#8220;political hardball&#8221; to protect their interests, whites are going to need to do the same.</p>
<p>In politics, as in physics, &#8220;for every action there is a reaction&#8221;, and the day when whites finally unite to protect their interests is not as far off as some people think - in the meantime we can expect to see increasing cases of individuals being outspoken and &#8220;politically incorrect&#8221;, as was the case with this Atlanta educator, as a prelude to effective white unity.</p>

			<p>Years ago I was preparing an article for the Canadian Heritage Front monthly when I came across a story from the U.S. regarding a teacher who was fired for making statements that were deemed racist. His name is Scott Phelps, and while I forget which state he is from, this is what he said: &#8220;Overwhelmingly, the students whose behavior makes the hallways deafening, who yell out for the teacher and demand immediate attention in class, who cannot seem to stop chatting and are fascinated by each other and relationships but not with academics&hellip;are African American.&#8221; Another courageous educator sacrificed on the alter of political correctness and diversity.</p>

			<p>I served on a school board for three years and I can tell you that these school administrators are major cowards when it comes to disciplining blacks about their behavior problems.  And they are a problem.  A major problem.  But they will call you a racist for just enforcing the rules.  In our school district blacks were 10 percent of the population but more than 50 percent of the &#8220;problem&#8221;.  Of course, black &#8220;leaders&#8221; attempted to confront white administrators and call then racists for just enforcing the rules in a &#8220;disproportionate&#8221; manner.  It never ends, and I commend this white leader for not backing down to the race hustlers.</p>

&hellip;this is very true.  I think it stems from bad parenting.  Black kids don&rsquo;t get the right kind of attention from their parents.  Where I live in Naperville Illinois (predominantly white but fading fast), a lot of blacks are moving in from the Aurora area and Cook county area (predominantly black), and I notice that the black kids get no attention unless they are gettin in trouble.  Some black parents just let their very young kids run all over the neighborhood causing mayhem UNATTENDED and when you complain they get mean and nasty with you like they want to start a fight.  And when its time for the kids to get their butts home the parents just yell out the friggin window from the 3rd floor instead of actually GOING AND PICKING UP THEIR KIDS.  Goes to show the typical laziness from blacks that is so evident in the workplace, especially in factories.  Blacks are always less productive and tend to complain more.<br>

<p>Anyway, I think we need to stop being so leniant on blacks and treat them equally.  Isn&rsquo;t that what the whole Civil Rights movement was about?  I am utterly sick of these guys who just sit and wait for something like this to happen only to pounce on it and use it as propoganda against non-black races, especially white people.  Besides, if they don&rsquo;t like it here in america they can always go back to starving in Africa with their relatives whom they always praise and hold on high.  Makes you wonder how many of these types actually care that there own are dying of poverty and disease in their &#8220;motherland&#8221;.</p>

			<p>It bemoans me to speak harsh criticism of black people or any people for that matter but all to often the child who screams the loudest gets the most attention. Black children need help, not to be put in a closet (segregation) and forgotten about. Keeping with the air that this website is maintained under, only because I fear any thought of whites and blacks working together will fall on deaf ears, blacks must take responsibility for their children because no one else will. I praise the truth and the supreintendent for his honest observation and true remarks. Black people need to face the truth, that the children are being misled into a culture that is moving further from peace and closer towards anarchy. It sickens me when I hear black people cry racism and prejudice about true and observable facts instead of taking steps to improve and grow the children positively and with strenth. Maybe one day we can,as a nation, teach each other without bias or refrain but in order for that possiblity to occur, we must EACH (black and white) overcome our learned prejudices against each other and that is only possible with real and truth filled inter- and intra-spection. Each One Teach One</p>
