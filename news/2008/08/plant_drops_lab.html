<p>Workers at the Tyson Foods poultry processing plant in Shelbyville will no longer have a paid day off on Labor Day but will instead be granted the Muslim holiday Eid al-Fitr.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tyson&rsquo;s director of media relations Gary Mickelson said the contract includes eight paid holidays &mdash; the same number as the old contract.</p>
<p>Eid al-Fitr &mdash; which falls on Oct. 1 this year &mdash; marks the end of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month of fasting.</p>
<p>Union leaders said implementing the holiday was important for the nearly 700 Muslims, many of them Somalis, who work at the plant that employs a total of 1,200 people.</p>
<p>Nineteen-year plant veteran William Pentecost doesn&rsquo;t agree with the decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s right. I really don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Tyson company spokeswoman Libby Lawson said by phone that, &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a religious accommodation, this is a contractual agreement. The majority asked for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The change didn&rsquo;t bother some workers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s fine. I don&rsquo;t have any problem with it. There&rsquo;s a whole bunch of them here, so they&rsquo;ve got to do something for them,&rdquo; said worker John Smith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shouldn&rsquo;t happen. I mean, I think, we&rsquo;re in America, you&rsquo;re in America, I think that they should go with our holidays,&rdquo; Pentecost said.</p>
<p>Channel 4&rsquo;s Cynthia Williams could not reach any of the plant&rsquo;s Muslim workers, because Channel 4 News&rsquo; crew was not permitted on the property.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The decision will only apply to workers at the plant who are union members. All other employees at the plant will still have their normal Labor Day holiday.</p>

			<p>This is only the tip of the multicultural ice-berg! I foresee so much more of this down the line as the whole identity of an &#8220;American&#8221; becomes little more than a designation of one&rsquo;s geographical home. It should be interesting for future generations&hellip;sad.</p>

			<p>Problem here is that, while being Moslem, the workers are still LABORERS. Why not enact a different holiday and make the ones who do not want the religious holiday off, come to work on make-up Saturday? Seems win-win and no-brainer to me.</p>

			<p>As I understand it, Tyson  has a long history of employing illegals also. And Tyson was a big supporter of the Clintons. I will not buy Tyson products because this policy of catering to Muslims seems to me anti-American. I don&rsquo;t like Muslims of any kind and think none should have even been allowed here. I never eat red meat by do eat chicken on occasion and will buy Foster Farms at least until or if I hear something about them I don&rsquo;t like.</p>

			<p>I agree that multi-culturalism is not necessarily a good thing and people should be pissed about it, especially if they&rsquo;re muslim AND black.  But you can&rsquo;t be pissed because 60% of the union voted for it, that&rsquo;s just fair.  What if it was 99% muslim, would that bother you?  </p>

Considering our union contracts, labor laws, and civil laws, Muslims must think this place is heaven. I bet they&rsquo;re on the phone every night telling their family and friends how wonderful they have it here and telling them to board the next plane.</p>
<p>Chain migration = ever lower wages. Ever lower wages = chain migration.</p>
<p>Immigrants do not lower wages. The WSJ said so.<br>

			<p>Well, everyone should ALREADY be boycotting tyson products.  They support so many un-American values, including illegal immigration.</p>
<p>For those that support this? You make a good argument, however, where does it end?  Give a holiday, take a country?  Please observe the European countries who already have a HUGE number of not just Muslims but immigrants all together.  The only solution is to be firm.</p>
<p>Given the fact that this country has a freedom of religion.  I think we should adopt or expand this idea to limit citizenship to religions that do NOT CLASH with the originally founded government&rsquo;s Religion.  We all know this country was founded on Christian prinicples.  Muslims and Christians simply DO NOT get along. It would be like forcing a homosexual to marry a heterosexual.  Sure it could work, as long as there was a huge long list of rules and conditions.  Is that what we want?  NO, just throw out the homosexuals, problem solved.</p>

<p>Perhaps you have a derivative of Stockholm Syndrome if you do not see what is wrong with the picture.</p>
<p>The issue is that Labor Day, a popular holiday I&rsquo;ve known all my life as a White American, has been disposed of by unwelcomed, third-world invaders.</p>
<p>As I said before, I will never buy or eat another Tyson product again.<br>

<p>I&rsquo;m afraid you miss the point. Labor Day is a traditional American holiday. If these people come to the US, we shouldn&rsquo;t have to change our holidays to suit them. Of course we should have never let these people into the country in the first place. Islam clashes completely with American culture and values.</p>

<p>No, this is how globalism and out of control immigration today works. Capitlism is where each individual country, through its&rsquo; own resources and national workforce, makes, buys, sells or trades with the goods and products made by other individual countries and their workforces. Globalism says there are no individual countries, cultures or national boundaries, the world is just one big group where the business elite pick what they can get anywhere for the lowest slave wage and pocket the rest and let the average citizen pay for the social costs of crime and welfare as well as other social problems by importing 3rd world people. Globalism only cares about money for the elite, it doesn&rsquo;t care if it destroys a country and its&rsquo; culture through mass immgration. So as you see, this isn&rsquo;t a &#8220;free market system&#8221; it&rsquo;s a ponzi scheme where the business elite get theirs at the expense of the country. If you accept globablism, then you accept the eventual death of the USA and the rest of the western world.</p>

			<p>This is terribly depressing. </p>
<p>My wife is from Shelbyville, Tennessee, and I have nothing but great memories of what was once a traditional Southern small town and the pretty countryside and hollows of surrounding Bedford County.</p>
<p>Shelbyville was being overrun with Mexicans when we left there for my native England, and my wife cursed Tyson for bringing them in to her hometown. She would NEVER buy anything from Tyson.</p>
<p>My guess is that the Muslims mentioned in the article are Somalians. For some reason,and I suspect the involvement of the do-gooding churches, Bedford County was being flooded with Somalian asylum-seekers. We still can&rsquo;t figure out the source of their apparently immediate material affluence and how most of them drove around in late-model SUVs. I can&rsquo;t imagine Tyson wages paid for them.</p>
<p>They were a regular sight in the aisles of Wal-Mart, where they would arrogantly barge into people,as if we were somehow in their way &hellip; as if it was their country.</p>
<p>Oh, and the black folks of Shelbyville didn&rsquo;t much care for the Somalians, either.</p>
<p>What a tragedy.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;700 Muslims in this small town? Man, they must stick out like sore thumbs. I&rsquo;ll bet the residents of this town didn&rsquo;t ask for these throwbacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>I grew up in Shelbyville, and lived there until Feb. of this year. I&rsquo;ve recently emigrated to the UK because my husband is British.</p>
<p>I have to say that they do stick out like a sore thumb, and they are quite rude when you see them out shopping. They act like you are in their way, and you should move. </p>
<p>I stopped buying Tyson products long ago when they brought tons of illegal Mexicans to Shelbyville to work in their plant. They got in trouble over the Mexicans, so they started hiring Somalis instead. </p>
<p>I worked at Tyson years ago, when I was 18(1982), and it was an ok place to work back then.  I don&rsquo;t remember any Mexicans or Muslims then. If I still worked there, I would protest taking away Labor Day to give the Muslims a day off. </p>
<p>Personally, I think if they want their days off to suit their religion, then they should go back to where they came from.</p>

<p>WHY NOT?&hellip;Labor Day is an AMERICAN holiday and we all KNOW that TYSON Foods does NOT employ AMERICANS anymore!&hellip;this company&hellip;needs to be put OUT OF BUSINESS&hellip;ASAP!&hellip;at the very LEAST they should get NO tax breaks or subsidies from OUR government!</p>
<p><br>
Union leaders said implementing the holiday was important for the nearly 700 Muslims, many of them Somalis, who work at the plant that employs a total of 1,200 people&hellip;</p>
<p>And the OTHER 400 employees?&hellip;if they are AMERICANS will they be FORCED to recognize and OBSERVE this MUSLIM&hellip;NON-AMERICAN&hellip;RELIGOUS &#8220;holiday&#8221;?&hellip;ah! yes!&hellip;the SOMALIS&hellip;those &#8220;down-trodden refugees&#8221;&hellip;ALLOWED into this country&hellip;at OUR expense!&hellip;ah! yes!&hellip;the UNION!&hellip;those people who are HELPING to put AMERICANS out of WORK!</p>
<p>Nineteen-year plant veteran William Pentecost doesn&rsquo;t agree with the decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s right. I really don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>The &#8220;majority&#8221; being FOREIGNERS shipped into this country on a WHOLESALE basis!&hellip;I wonder if the majority would rule if they were AMERICAN?&hellip;I wonder if they would be so ACCOMMODATING to AMERICANS if THEY were in the MAJORITY?&hellip;obviousy NOT&hellip;since AMERICANS are NOT in the MAJORITY to begin with!</p>
<p>The change didn&rsquo;t bother some workers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s fine. I don&rsquo;t have any problem with it. There&rsquo;s a whole bunch of them here, so they&rsquo;ve got to do something for them,&rdquo; said worker John Smith&hellip;</p>
<p>NO!&hellip;Mr. Smith&hellip;they don&rsquo;t!&hellip;the Somalis can celebrate on their OWN time!&hellip;say&hellip;Mr. Smith&hellip;what happens if this &#8220;whole bunch of them&#8221; decide that CHRISTMAS, the 4th of JULY and MEMORIAL DAY are &#8220;offensive&#8221; to them and DON&rsquo;T WANT such holidays observed!&hellip;will they&hellip;the MAJORITY get their way on that TOO?&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shouldn&rsquo;t happen. I mean, I think, we&rsquo;re in America, you&rsquo;re in America, I think that they should go with our holidays,&rdquo; Pentecost said&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called ASSIMILATION!&hellip;and NOBODY wants to&hellip;or is EXPECTED&hellip;to do that anymore!&hellip;it doesn&rsquo;t matter if they come here VOLUNTARILY or if they are given REFUGEE status&hellip;by OUR COUNTRY&hellip;to SAVE their COWARDLY HIDES!&hellip;ANYONE who&rsquo;s country is in such chaos&hellip;who ESCAPES to ANOTHER country&hellip;who does NOT stay and FIGHT for THEIR country and THEIR people&hellip;are COWARDS!&hellip;yet, they COME here and proceed to DEMAND that THIS country MORPH INTO the country THEY CHOSE TO LEAVE&hellip;instead of EMBRACING this country!</p>
