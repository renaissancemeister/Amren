<h1>DA Will Pursue Death Penalty for Atwater</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>News &amp; Observer (Raleigh, North Carolina), August 11, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Orange County District Attorney announced today he intends to pursue the death penalty for the man charged with killing UNC-Chapel Hill&rsquo;s student body president.</p>
<p>District Attorney Jim Woodall said there are potential aggravating factors that would justify the death penalty for Demario Atwater, 22, should he be convicted of murder.</p>
<p>Last month, a grand jury indicted Atwater and Laurence Lovette with more charges of armed robbery, first-degree kidnapping, felonious larceny and possession of stolen goods, in addition to Carson&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Woodall said during today&rsquo;s hearing prosecutors believe that Atwater and Lovette were on foot on Rosemary Street in the Chapel Hill area, looking to rob people.</p>
<p>There were varying statements made about whether Carson was taken from her home or if the two men pretended their car was broken down and then took her, Woodall said.</p>
<p>Most likely, they abducted Carson just outside her home, Woodall said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After the hearing, Woodall said he had talked to Carson&rsquo;s parents, and that they would support his decision.</p>
<p>Orange County has not sent anyone to death row since 1970; no offender in Orange County has been executed since 1948.</p>
<p>Lovette, 17, is not eligible for the death penalty because of his age.</p>
<p>Lovette is charged also with first-degree murder in the death of Abhijit Mahato, a Duke University engineering student from Bengal, India, shot in a robbery in January.</p>

			<p>He&rsquo;s old enough to murder 2 people, but to young to be given the death penalty. Perverted justice at it&rsquo;s best.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t see why Mr Lovette shouldn&rsquo;t be eligible for the death penalty, he&rsquo;d be 37 by the time they got around to teleporting him to outer space, or however else they&rsquo;ll be executing people in 2028.</p>

			<p>Yes, the poor little darling is old enough to kill, but not old enough to die.</p>
<p>Something&rsquo;s is wrong with this picture, and it&rsquo;s likely the bozos making the laws and working within the judicial system, as usual.</p>

			<p>Watch Demario Atwater walk. (by premeditated design on the part of Orange County DA Jim Woodall) No Capital Convict from Orange County has gotten the &#8220;juice&#8221; since 1948. Unless there is a change of venue, there&rsquo;s no way in hell that Woodall won&rsquo;t get nullified by a largely white Orange County jury.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;Lovette, 17, is not eligible for the death penalty because of his age.&#8221; Even though this is his second murder?</p>
<p>Mr. &amp; Ms Carson probably don&rsquo;t even know that AMREN exists. How can they sleep every night knowing that these two bastards (literally and figuratively) will never get the punishment that is due them?  <br>
I, for one, hunger for the day I hear a story about a family who exacts its own righteous revenge against one of these primitive mutants. If Lovette were twelve years old it wouldn&rsquo;t matter. He needs to die.</p>

			<p>It is amazing.  In Britain there are left-wing politicians advocating that youths as young as 16 years should be allowed to vote in general elections, hoping of course that at that age they are impressionable enough to be seduced by the basic principles of Marxism without going into the terrifying historical facts.   But we can all read in the UK Press now how the once &#8220;Great&#8221; Britain is morally deteriorating with the gangs and amorality, shootings and stabbings in the streets, 23 teenagers in London alone so far this year.  Mainly blacks, of course, but many London areas are that way now where to be white is to stand out as an oddity.  But there are many blacks who do not like the new conditions as well because they wish for the same standards to exist as we all do but the conditions generally are there also because of the move from religion from a young age, and also both parents having to work just to live in this age where a basic home can now cost hundreds of thousands of dollars due to the greed of people.  </p>
<p>Now you good people in the USA have a case where a youth is old enough to brutally murder with premeditation, but deemed too young to face the consequences of his act.   I lived and worked for two years in St Louis, (McDonnell Douglas factory) and it was great to be able to walk around our suburb, Florissant, at any time day and night, even my young, sexy wife on her own during the day, with no fear of being abused, just the occasional nice appreciative wolf-whistle (even with the baby in a push chair) which no woman should object to anyway.   That was in the 1960s. I wonder, can anyone tell me if you can still do that now there?</p>
<p>We, my wife and I, are coming to New York soon for a holiday staying in the Manhattan area and the hotel assures us it is safe to walk out at night.  I hope they are 100% right as we wish to absorb some of te Big Apple &#8220;magic&#8221; and still go home to Spain where we live safely, retired.  </p>
<p>God bless America for, like us, it looks as though we need all the help from God we can get.</p>

			<p>When I see these grandstanding prosecutors &#8220;pursue the death penalty&#8221;, especially here in California, I can&rsquo;t help but shake my head and laugh.  The fact is that you can count on one hand the number of states that actually have the will to impose the death penalty.  The rest of the time it&rsquo;s pure political posturing by prosecutors trying to get their &#8220;tough on crime&#8221; credentials lined up for the next election.<br>
If the sysem worked, executions would keep pace with capital murder cases, and no state would ever have more than one or two dozen people on death row waiting for their comeuppance.</p>

			<p>Deepest sympathy to Mr. &amp; Mrs. Carson and family. Eve&rsquo;s beautiful photograph here is beyond heartbreaking. It speaks more eloquently everything I had originally intended, but then found myself struggling (vis-a-vis rules of civil discourse) to post. So I guess I&rsquo;ll just be leaving it at that  &mdash;  thanks Eve.<br>

			<p>This article lists the charges, but leaves out the multiple rape charges.</p>
<p>Anyone who is that young and already viciously killed two people in furtherance of other crimes has no business being alive.</p>

			<p>He won&rsquo;t walk, even if the jury does not give him the death penalty.  They&rsquo;ll still convict him and he&rsquo;ll get sent away, at the least.</p>

			<p>I have a simple solution to this apparent conundrum: execute him after he turns 18.</p>

			<p>The idea to execute him after he turns 18 sounds like a good one, but it can&rsquo;t happen.  The age at issue is his age when he COMMITTED the crime.</p>

			<p>Perhaps in the eyes of God all human lives are equal. Not in my eyes however! Ms. Carson represented the very best of what the future could hold. These young thugs represent the very worst of what the present has. </p>
<p>Young women like Ms. Carson need and deserve our protection; as to protect them protects our potential unborn as well. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure the perpetrators&rsquo; explanation will go something like this: </p>
<p>&#8220;O. K. feel me this, see uh, we uh like, know what I be saying, well this ho be dissing us, and like we all know what time it is and all, and uh we uh, well, we be rapping bout dustin da bitch and on, so the ho kept dissing and we kept rapping, feel me, if da ho bitch be in da road, feel me, da bitch had to go, know what I&rsquo;m saying,  that bitch made us be keeping it for real, feel me, its that ho&rsquo;s fault, feel me, like da ho be dissing and making us keep it real feel me, cause know what I be saying?&#8221;  </p>
<p>Translation: It was Eve&rsquo;s fault because she was born white.  </p>
<p>Just imagine Eve&rsquo;s final thirty minutes on this earth. Think about what she went through. She probably woke up happy in the morning, merely concerned over some minor problem, if any. Now her very life was in the hands of Atwater and  <br>
Lovette who intended to use her and then discard her as if a piece of garbage. </p>
<p>And then think about what if anything Eve had ever done in her entire live to warrant this!</p>
<p>In my view a &#8220;pleasant death&#8221; is much too lenient - - unfortunately for the world, Atwater and Lovette were not aborted instantly upon conception.<br>
__________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>To Eve.<br>
 <br>
My heart tears for what happened Eve <br>
A fragile rose, the mother of us all<br>
The butterfly flies no more<br>
The peak of your flower&rsquo;s bloom<br>
CRUSHED!</p>
<p>And the long train running with it&rsquo;s soft refrain&hellip;.</p>
<p>This is not the end!</p>
