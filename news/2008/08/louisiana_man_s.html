<h1>Louisiana Man Sentenced for Nooses Targeting &#8216;Jena Six&rsquo; Marchers</h1>
					<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fox Business Network, August 15, 2008</i></p>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Grace Chung Becker, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department&rsquo;s Civil Rights Division, and Donald W. Washington, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Louisiana, today announced that Jeremiah Munsen, 19, of Pineville, La., was sentenced to four months in prison for his role in using nooses to threaten marchers who participated in the &#8220;Jena Six&#8221; civil rights rally. In addition to the four-month prison term, Munsen received one year of supervised release and 125 hours of community service.</p>
<p>On Sept. 20, 2007, in an incident that garnered national media attention, Munsen and another person allegedly attached the nooses to the back of a pickup truck and repeatedly drove slowly and menacingly past a large group of African American individuals who had gathered at a bus depot in Alexandria, La., after attending the civil rights rally in Jena.</p>
<p>The defendant pleaded guilty April 25, 2008, admitting that he displayed two large, life-sized nooses from the back of his pickup truck with the intent to frighten and intimidate the demonstrators. He and the other person with him hung the nooses in a manner so as to be clearly visible to the gathered demonstrators, and Munsen then drove past the group two or three times while the other person glared out the window at the demonstrators. Munsen further admitted that he and the other person had previously discussed the Ku Klux Klan and how they thought the Klan would have responded to the rally in Jena, and he acknowledged that the Jena Six rally followed extensive public discussion regarding, among other things, the history of racial lynchings in the United States and the perception that a noose, when displayed in a racial context, constituted a symbol of racial violence.</p>
<p>&#8220;The defendant used a threatening and offensive tactic to intimidate peaceful civil rights marchers who were in Louisiana to rally against racial intolerance,&#8221; said Acting Assistant Attorney General Grace Chung Becker. {snip}</p>

			<p>In my hometown of Tucson, several black/Mexican teenagers hung an effigy of Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio and proceeded to beat and behead it in front of a Barnes &amp; Noble Book Signing which Arpaio was attending.</p>
<p>Not only did they not get any jail time, for threatening violence upon a government official, the local fishwrap excused their actions as childish fun.<br>

			<p>Again, there are so many traitors to the principles of free speech   &mdash;  judges, politicians, police, and citizens in this nation. They should be removed from office wholesale, and would be if the citizenry demanded an end to the hate speech and thought speech, and other attempts to limit freedom of expression.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Munsen and another person allegedly attached the nooses to the back of a pickup truck and repeatedly drove slowly and menacingly past a large group of African American individuals who had gathered at a bus depot in Alexandria, La., after attending the civil rights rally in Jena.&#8221;</p>
<p>Who would believe that a pick up truck could drive menacingly past a mob of blacks, except a zonked out mind-numbed politically correct zombie?  Actually I&rsquo;m wondering why he wasn&rsquo;t mobbed.  Probably because he made a couple of quick passes and fled the scene, more than likely.</p>
<p>If he had stuck around, he and his passenger would have been pulled from the truck and beaten whether they had a noose or not, just because they were white.  How many stories have we read on here of exactly that kind of racial attack by a mob of blacks on whites?</p>
<p>And why does the biased media seek to portray this as a cut and dried case of white guilt when they regard attempted murder by 6 blacks beating a white kid as not worthy of explanation, or called the vicious unprovoked beating a school fight, which is exactly what they did?</p>
<p>If the situation were reversed, we wouldn&rsquo;t be reading about the black racists getting four months in prison.  I mean, prior cases where whites have suffered broken bones, teeth, and have endured brain damage, have resulted in probabtion or nothing.</p>
<p>Whites have too many gullible, naive types, and they are the worst enemies we have.</p>

This one should go all the way to the US Supreme Court.</p>
<p>To be truthful the display of a noose is covered under the free speech provisions of the US Constitution.  The marches are using their right to free speech to make a statement.  The noose hangers are doing exactly the same thing. </p>
<p>The parties disagree, no one was threatened.  If Jeremiah Munsen&rsquo;s lawyer advised him to admit to threatening behavior, he should be lynched (metaphorically of course).  </p>
<p>Protest and counter protest are covered under the free speech rights of every American from African Americans to sodomites to Zoroastrians.     <br>

			<p>In other words, 4 months in prison because of a non-violent protest against a gang of marchers. And how do you drive &#8220;menacingly&#8221; anyway? Notice that while the media loves to use scare quotes when it suits them, they apparently had no trouble with the word &#8220;menacingly&#8221; in the article.</p>

<p>You notice how those millions of whites came to the guy&rsquo;s defense.  Just like blacks do for other blacks&hellip;</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve said all along, whites are the problem.  Minorities are only doing what they should be doing.  Looking out solely for their own interests.  Not American interests, their own interests.<br>

			<p>Where is the White Man&rsquo;s leadership?</p>
<p>If this had happened to a black man the Rev Jackson would be all over this. Where is the White Man&rsquo;s leadership?</p>
<p>If this had happened to a mexican, La Raza would be protesting. Where is the White Man&rsquo;s leadership?</p>
<p>If this had happened to a homosexual, their activist leaders would be making news. Where is the White Man&rsquo;s leadership?</p>
<p>If the American White Man had just ONE leader, one man who is as commited, as effective as the black man, the mexican, the homoesexual activisits, the feminist, etc..  We have a lot of educators, a lot of managers in the so called White Cause&hellip; but not ONE leader. </p>

			<p>Reading this story, and the &#8216;acknowledgements&rsquo; of the white defendant, at the mercy of a chinese woman and a black man, immediately brings to my mind the show trials of the communists in the Soviet Union. Does anyone really believe that this white man thought up all these &#8216;acknowledgements&rsquo; on his own and was sincerely contrite of heart? The simple fact of a white person being tried and judged in a severly threatening manner by non-whites incenses me to no end. This is the fate of the white race in the entire western world, being judged and convicted by non-whites, for every perceived infraction, be it large or small, rightly or wrongly, until the last white person is sent to the gallows, if this anti-white racism is not dealt with in the most quick and forthright way. </p>

			<p>It may say, &#8220;Fox Business Network&#8221;, but this article is as dripping with carefully-crafted bias as anything from the New York Times.  Notice how the article doesn&rsquo;t use the word &#8220;teen&#8221; once - which is a requirement in writing about accused blacks.  Usually, when leftists &#8220;frighten and intimidate&#8221; demonstrators, it&rsquo;s merely considered a counter-demonstration.  But non-leftist whites aren&rsquo;t allowed to use street theater.  How on earth can you drive &#8220;menacingly&#8221;?  It&rsquo;s almost comical that this poor kid was convicted of &#8220;glaring&#8221; at black people - the masters of the hateful, hostile glare.</p>
<p>But still, a pretty stupid thing for him to do.  This kid played right into the hands of the media and the hands of our beloved government.  In a fair and just country, he would have gotten some competent defense and hearing, all though the appeals process, based on freedom of speach.  But, for whites, it is no longer a fair and just country.  Increasingly, whites are given draconion sentences for expressing their sentiment - while judges slap the wrists of truly brutal violent blacks for &#8220;acting out&#8221; with fists and clublike feet.  And now blacks are accorded even more special rights and privileges - the right to forbid the use of any image which evokes their childlike apprehension.</p>
<p>For blacks are indeed little more than children - and our beloved government knows it.</p>

			<p>Well that will teach him now wont it? The good white citizens of Lousiana that have been there for 10 generations will now learn to respect Multicultural ideology rammed down their throats by appointed Federal judges. They will also respect the <br>
professional race hustlers like Sharpton and the New York media.<br>
Yes sirree. And the good people of Louisiana will have a renewed respect for the Law that does the bidding of the editors<br>
of the New York Times, now wont they? Yes indeed, jail sentences for shenanigans like will put an end to hatred and racism, you betcha.</p>

<p>It reminds me of the history of black on white violence.</p>
<p>That said, I don&rsquo;t want to see anybody go to jail over a &#8216;feeling&rsquo;, because I believe that would be a violation of our fundamental constitutional freedoms.</p>

			<p>  I can honestly and with great sadness in my heart say that I&rsquo;m beginning to hate my own country. I never in a million years ever thought that would ever come from my lips. But sadly enough, it has come to that point. I am white, therefor, in the eyes of my government, I&rsquo;m trash. I have no respect for this country and I will be looking for someplace to go. But like Sherwood Smith says, &#8220;we have no leader, not one.&#8221; The way I see it, as long as you give a white man Monday night football, and cold beer, and a over-rated, over-paid black athlete he can worship, he is satisfied and the minorities can have his job, wife, children, and his country. Shame on us white men!</p>

			<p>I have long felt that one of the reasons that our Enemies are so anxious to flood the universities with Orientals is that they are deaf to the traditional rights of Americans.  The citizen-aliens regard them as roadblocks to, rather than guarantees of, justice.  No real American, even a liberal, would defend this judicial atrocity, so they need non-Americans to help do the dirty work.  </p>

			<p>This Jena Six stuff is nonsense. Six kids assaulted another, putting him in the hospital. That&rsquo;s assault, pure and simple. </p>
<p>The marchers are fools, and anyone who tries to mess with them, is only making their case for them. </p>
<p>Bottom line, this kid deserves 4 months in the clink, for stupidity, and a good yelling from his father, for ruining his future and giving the yahoos who came to protest &#8216;racism&rsquo; something to get wag their tongues about.</p>

  I wish this guy and his friend had just printed up a sign, like maybe &#8221; Stop Black Crime Against Whites &#8221; or something else about the crime we suffer from blacks.  But in todays police state it&rsquo;s foolish to display controversial symbols.  A local politician admitted to me that he and other legislators are afraid to vote conservative because of the newspapers. And he told me he knew several Judges who are terrified of being targeted by leftwing papers and will rule on cases to avoid being written up.  The media is our enemy.</p>

			<p>I am opposed to this prosecution, as it is a clear violation of the 1st Ammendment. </p>
<p>However, don&rsquo;t be surprised if the &#8220;anti-hate&#8221; laws get worse in Louisiana (especially in the Northern region).  The state is on the path to turning Black, and the Blacks of North Louisiana will be capable to cut off (and isolate White Southern Louisiana), if a Civil War 2 were to occur. But without a Civil War, it will still turn Black, with an uninterrupted path. </p>
<p>Louisiana is a nice state, and I know it&rsquo;s the homestate of Dr. David Duke; but if you are White, I strongly suggest you leave Louisiana ASAP, if residing therein.</p>

			<p>This article re-affirms my belief that the reason white people aren&rsquo;t more assertive in their demonstration of their objection to the current culture of black acceptance is fear of retaliation from their government.</p>
<p>Everyone from employers to realtors to Dennys are afraid of the government supported tyranny now employed by Civil rights pundits and with an Obama nomination will get alot worse, political correctness will go into hyperdrive.</p>
<p>Putting up nooses doesn&rsquo;t really limit anyones freedom of expression or speech.  Throwing them in prison for it does.</p>
<p>White people in this country, particularly men, do not have any consideration in this political climate and therefore have no vested interest in keeping it viable. </p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going to happen to the fabric of this country when the white Atlas&rsquo;s shoulders shrug?<br>

			<p>Interesting that our government regards blacks as so infantile, superstitious, and hopelessly stupid that the mere sight of anything resembling a noose sends them into a state of quavering terror.</p>
<p>Do we next outlaw chains of any sort?  The question is more than rhetorical.</p>

			<p>I mostly agree with you, P Noctura.  He should have never plead guilty and this is the result of poor advice from inadequate representation.  Any semi-competent attorney could have gotten him off scott-free.  Force the prosecutions hand by picking a jury of this kids peers.  The jury pool would comprise of Louisianians, not New Yorkers or San Franciscans.  Show the jury how the prosecution is attempting to suppress freedom of speech.  Explain to them how freedom of speech is for speech that people disagree with, since speech that is non-controversial does not necessarily need protection.  And if burning or shredding an American flag is considered protected free speech, regardless how antagonistic the act may be, then certainly displaying a nose in a public place is equally protected.  The ACLU should have been all over this case and provided pro bono representation if they had an ounce of credibility and truly stood for civil liberties.  Since they didn&rsquo;t, this kid was left with inadequate representation, probably from a public defender, and was therefore advised to plead guilty to exercising his constitutional right.<br>
Where I disagree with you is in expecting the Supreme Court to right this wrong.  By the time this case worked its way through the courts, the Supreme Court will have been Obamanized, and an Obamanized Supreme Court would show no sympathy for a white boy that displayed a noose in the presence of sensitive blacks.  Plus, taking this case to a liberal Supreme Court would provide legal precedence to further erode the freedom of speech of politically incorrect whites.  &#8221;The Fairness Doctrine&#8221; is the first salvo in this war against those that voice opposition to their relentless indoctrination attempts.  Taking this case to an Obamanized Supreme Court would be the second.</p>

			<p> I am numb from the ascendancy of idiot logic and false history that&rsquo;s being applied everywhere to suppress whites and deny them their Constitutional rights . They tax the heck out of us and then use the funds to disfranchise us of our simplest rights . You know the tax payers payed for those tens of thousands of African activist/nationalist to descend on poor Jena and perpetuate a lie . And then there are the powerful whites who betray their own people . I fear for our children .My own grand father used to say the same thing about us way back in the early sixties . I wish I could tell you about him . 6&rsquo;5, a head full of jet black hair he combed straight back . A retired railroad man born in 1899, I still have his pocket watch, highly valued back then for their accuracy and required by the railroad . He wore those tan, Jungle Jim type work clothes and a big fedora or sometimes a tan pith helmet .We&rsquo;d get up at 4:30am to go fishing in the summer, granny would fix these huge cat head, butter&rsquo;d  biscuits made from scratch and home made fig and pare preserves . Always drove a Buick until &#8216;65 when he had to switch to Chevys because of the price . 1964, he knew what was headed our way even then .Today I am amazed at his insight . </p>

			<p>&#8220;Where is the White Man&rsquo;s leadership?&#8221;<br>
Posted by Sherwood Smith at 7:59 PM</p>
<p>The leaders are here and have been here all along. If the sheeple don&rsquo;t want to get behind them that&rsquo;s not the leaders fault is it?</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>I was at a BNP meeting last week. After the speeches there was a Q&A; segment. An elderly guy blurted out a statement blaming the leadership of the party for not correcting what he saw was the problems in Britain today. The party officials defended Mr Griffin quite well and the session moved on.</p>
<p>Spoke to the guy afterward and it turns out that he&rsquo;s prepared to vote BNP but not join the party or do any activism. He&rsquo;s angry because of the situation he and his family have found themselves in because of the immigration situation.</p>
<p>His whole attitude seemed to be:</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&rsquo;t the BNP get elected years ago and sort this mess out?&#8221;</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>&#8220;If I wasn&rsquo;t having these problems then I wouldn&rsquo;t really care.&#8221;</p>
<p>This guy is like many others, he has come to expect things to be done for him, and the government, the media and the education system are doing things for him. Dismantling the nation for him and his offspring basically.</p>
<p>If Whites want our nations back, then they will have to be prepared to work to take it back and it&rsquo;s not going to be easy. More than 40 years of &#8216;liberal&rsquo; brainwashing has left most Whites clueless as to how our society is built, maintained and the principals that uphold it.</p>
<p>As they say, if your not part of the solution then your part of the problem. I&rsquo;m sick of hearing lazy loosers blame &#8216;leadership&rsquo;. This has to be a grass roots revolution.</p>

			<p>The really sad part of this fiasco is while gov. prosecutors were spending time villifying and condemning this teenager for his thoughts and non-violent actions, rampant crime and corruption were going unpunished all over the US. Seldom is a first offender given jail time for a non=violent crime, only in a situation where a group of welfare mommas are dissed could this happen.</p>

			<p>Seldom is a first offender sentenced to prison time for a non-violent crime, in this case a thought crime, but in this case there&rsquo;s a message being sent by federal prosecutors to white America, and it is; You aren&rsquo;t going to get away w/dissing our beloved blacks, no matter what.</p>

			<p>Many of the comments here are valid but we have the rules of engagement that exists at this time. Agree that these two young men shouldn&rsquo;t have done this and then turn back the debate to why six people can assault one person and entire communtiy makes excuses as to why this isn&rsquo;t a crime. The leftists and black racists are adept at changing the subject, don&rsquo;t let them. </p>

			<p>That&rsquo;s my home town, Alexandria. Used to be a beautiful Southern city, right on the Red River. You guessed it, not a beautiful city any more. There was a time, not so long ago, when this foolishness would not have been tolerated, especially down there.I dont know when the tipping point came, or what it was exactly. Probably the Civil Rights Act of 64? I think that was the nail in the coffin. Alexandria always had a large black population, but you hardly ever saw them; they stayed mainly in Samtown, the name of the neighborhood where they all lived, and I do mean ALL lived, they didnt even think about moving into our neighborhoods. They didnt dare. They just stayed in the quarters. Yep, those were good days. </p>

			<p>This man was a perfect example of how badly whites handle THEIR rights.  He attempted to make a show of protest by driving around with the noose.  He was caught and arrested, but did not make a big scene out of this being his right to free speech.  He pled guilty, but did not proudly stand up and proclaim this was his right.  And he will serve his time and not appeal.  Until whites stand up for THEIR rights and make a big scene out of THEIR rights being trampled on, there will be no justice.  Whites care too much about what other people think.  If you truly believe in something, then be prepared to go all the way with it.</p>

<p>That is the pattern we see here, indeed. Hundreds of thousands (millions?) who immigrated from the (former) Soviet Union brought a piece of their &#8220;culture&#8221; to America.</p>
<p>If you see new phenomena in American politics and jurisprudence that resemble Soviet practices, it&rsquo;s safe to assume that some of those who have roots in Russia transplanted them here.<br>

			<p>Jeremiah Munsen, 19, of Pineville, La., was sentenced to four months in prison for his role in using nooses to threaten marchers who participated in the &ldquo;Jena Six&rdquo; civil rights rally. In addition to the four-month prison term, Munsen received one year of supervised release and 125 hours of community service&hellip;</p>
<p>This is RIDICULOUS!&hellip;</p>
<p>Munsen and another person allegedly attached the nooses to the back of a pickup truck and repeatedly drove slowly and menacingly past a large group of African American individuals who had gathered at a bus depot in Alexandria, La., after attending the civil rights rally in Jena&hellip;</p>
<p>And&hellip;why weren&rsquo;t the &#8220;attendees&#8221; of the civil rights &#8220;rally&#8221; ARRESTED too?&hellip;THEY were REPEATEDLY MENACING the people in JENA!&hellip;THEY had NO BUSINESS in JENA&hellip;AT ALL!&hellip;THEIR &#8220;rally&#8221; threatened and MENACED the people in JENA a lot MORE than a kid in a PICKUP TRUCK did!&hellip;besides, at least he drove SLOWLY AROUND them than SPED THROUGH them!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The defendant used a threatening and offensive tactic to intimidate peaceful civil rights marchers who were in Louisiana to rally against racial intolerance,&rdquo; said Acting Assistant Attorney General Grace Chung Becker&hellip;.</p>
<p>BLACKS who have these civil rights marches TO intimidate and threaten!&hellip;THEY are MORE threatening and offensive than two kids in a pickup truck &#8220;glaring&#8221; at them!&hellip;Had these people kept THEIR noses out of the business of JENA&hellip;NO ONE wold have felt &#8220;threatened&#8221; OR &#8220;offended&#8221; and NO ONE would have pled guilty to a BOGUS &#8220;CRIME&#8221;!&hellip;RALLY AGAINST RACIAL INTOLERANCE?&hellip;the BLACKS are the LEAST TOLERANT race of people on the planet!</p>

			<p>Prison for a first time offender. Of a non violent crime no less? Someone must be very scared to respond in such a stong manner. Why do the idiots in the media continue to believe that blacks must be protected from Whites? Who kills more blacks, truckloads of drunken Klansmen or car loads of other blacks? How long would it take for the black race to become extinct if we stopped saving them from themselves? Maybe it&rsquo;s time.</p>

			<p>I am confused.  While dragging nooses behind your car probably isn&rsquo;t the best way to show your distaste for the Jena 6 marchers,  I don&rsquo;t see how it is illegal.  He wasn&rsquo;t doing anything &#8220;threatening&#8221;, but making a controvesial statement.</p>
<p>Last I checked we lived in America and people we allowed to express their beliefs, even if they deemed to be outrageous.</p>

			<p>As to driving menacingly:  If he was driving towards someone so that he would have hit them if they didn&rsquo;t get out of the way, then that would be &#8220;meancingly.&#8221;  I doubt that he was doing anything like that.  He was saying, in effect, &#8220;I don&rsquo;t respect you bozos&#8221; to the black demonstrators and that is (I suspect) the only reason he is scheduled to serve time in prison.</p>
<p>This sad situation illustrates some differences between Left and Right.  Left wingers running afoul of the law were often courageous, articulate people who did things like block the entrances of defense plants.  They would get top-notch legal representation and their legal defense fund-raisers would inspire greater levels of political activism.</p>
<p>As a side note, the infamous <a href="https://m3peeps.org/03/hc.htm" rel="nofollow">Central Michigan University Noose Incident</a> has been resolved:  it was a prank with no racial intent.  (The FBI really made sure of that, too.  They inspected about 100,000 &#8220;images and personal documents&#8221; on the guy&rsquo;s computer.)  Nonetheless, some legislators are proposing an expanded Hate Crime law so that, in the future, such pranks do not go unpunished.  </p>

<p>This guy was railroaded by a leftist leaning lawyer who should be disbarred for not representing his client. </p>
<p>What he did was not illegal, it could be construed in any number of ways, but he didnt have a good lawyer.</p>
<p>This ruling is a threat to all Freedom of speech. </p>

			<p>The part that gets me is that the Federal prosecutors would have had no evidence if Munsen&rsquo;s passenger/friend (some friend) wouldn&rsquo;t have ratted him out, by saying that intimidation was the motivation.  If not for that, then it would have been Chung-Becker&rsquo;s word against Munsen&rsquo;s, and I highly doubt 12 people would have seen it Chung&rsquo;s way.</p>

			<p>The federal government is obviously appeasing blacks who thought the Jena High School lariat club should have been prosecuted, but wasn&rsquo;t, since the prosecutors looked into it and determined that hanging nooses isn&rsquo;t actually against the law.  I guess the federal government can now prosecute activities that aren&rsquo;t against the law - if the color of the prosecuted is right.</p>

			<p>This sentencing stinks to high heaven and we all know it.  Most blacks don&rsquo;t even serve time when they seriously injure a white person, so the the U.S. Dept. of Injustice is no friend to the common white man.  When this story first broke last year the maximum prison time for &#8220;racial harassment&#8221; was something like 5 years which would have been draconian and Stalinist to say the least.</p>
<p>I think the difference here is that this poor white young man couldn&rsquo;t afford competent legal counsel nor did he have the backing of his white community.  After all we are now just a collection of individuals who don&rsquo;t see each other as members of larger group.  Had white public officials and local whites raised cain about this then the charges would likely have been dropped.  But of course most whites lacked the courage nor did they want to be perceived as racist.     </p>

			<p> 3:31 pm poster, I appeal to you - cling to your Fourth of July .Do not surrender who we once were to the liberals, they only pretend to cherish the memory .I am Southern, I love my heritage and my Confederate flags .But I also love the American flag, and I will never abandon it or the memory of those who fought believing they were doing what was right for America .From 1776 until the War On Terror, they are all hallowed,that would certainly include the Confederates .The WBTS was an American tragedy, not a liberal triumph as is being portrayed today . The liberals have usurped our flag and our history . They fly it now only as a convenience,only because they have been told to fly it .  As recently as after 9-11 they burned an American flag at the School of the America&rsquo;s at Fort Benning . As soon as they get Southern heritage and the Confederate flag out of the way they will turn their attention on the Stars and Stripes, if you are young, you are going to see this happen . At best you may see a new hybrid flag, at worst you will see one that carries no hint of who we once were .</p>
