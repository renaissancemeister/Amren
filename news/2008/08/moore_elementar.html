<h1>Moore Elementary Starts Dual-Language Learning for Youngest Students</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Zach Smith, TCPalm.com (Fort Pierce, Florida), August 13, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Chester A. Moore Elementary] will become the first in St. Lucie County to host a dual-language program that provides instruction in English and Spanish for students in kindergarten and pre-kindergarten.</p>
<p>C.A. Moore Principal Keith Davis said the curriculum, commonly referred to as a 50:50 immersion program, will help Spanish-speaking students learn English while providing English-speaking students with an opportunity to start learning Spanish at an early age.</p>
<p>Classes will be composed of native Spanish- and English-speaking students. A teacher who is a native English speaker will teach half of the class time in English only, and a teacher who is a native Spanish speaker will provide instruction speaking only Spanish during the other half of class.</p>
<p>The dual-language curriculum will meet the same district grade-level requirements for students enrolled in standard pre-K and kindergarten programs.</p>
<p>Social studies and science lessons will be in Spanish, while math lessons will be in English. Concepts will then be reinforced in the opposite language from which they were learned through reading and writing activities.</p>

			<p>This is wrong, wrong, wrong! Has the United States not learned from Canada what can happen with bilingualism? Whatever happened to immigrants (legal only, please) in America learning English? It is their duty to integrate and adjust, not the responsibility of native-born Americans to bend to their customs, languages, and foreign traditions. Bilingualism in Canada hasn&rsquo;t produced anything in the way of harmony, but it has threatened to break up this country (Quebec separatism soared after the country officially went bilingual) more than once, depressed the economy, and slanted the federal political scene heavily in favor of French-speakers (unilingual English speakers don&rsquo;t stand a chance of succeeding at the highest political levels). On a closing note, I once encountered a Grade 3 student (8 years old, going on 9) who attended a French immersion school in Calgary, Alberta, and thus received bilingual education. He was bright but completely unable to write in English at all, and he lived in an English-speaking city! Yes, folks, that&rsquo;s what unnecessary bilingual education will get you!</p>

			<p>This isnt a bad idea. Language racism is a phony issue that only serves to distract from the real problem: the immigraton of people itself.  Teaching Spanish to white kids isnt going to turn them all into leftist mind slaves any more than teaching English turns all Mexicans into Republicans. Most American whites learn Spanish in high school anyway.</p>

			<p>Both Matt and Sleep are correct.  Sleep is correct that teaching Spanish will not make a white person a leftist.  Matt is correct that teaching Spanish will make us more like filthy Canada.  Our nation is done folks.  I thought most of us on this site already knew this.  I&rsquo;m here for collective civil rights for white people and to energize us into mass protest and solidarity.  Through mass demonstrations we will stop foreign invasion, stop Bolshevik control of our Gov&rsquo;t and foreign policy, stop oppression and discrimination and terror against our people by black and brown racist throngs, and make our lives have more dignity.  When we become &#8220;mean&#8221; then we&rsquo;ll get the civil and human rights that are God given.</p>

			<p>  In no way should we be made to accommodate these people if they refuse to learn english. Look at all the other &#8220;western&#8221; countries. They have bent over backward to beg outsiders to assimilate. It doesn&rsquo;t happen, they always demand more from their host country. What the west has to understand is this, immigrants, especially from other lands that have a totally different value system, will not attempt to assimilate. That is not what their intentions are in the first place. They are in our countries to OVER-RUN us. They are here to conquer us. We, the western nations, are at war. They know it, and we are still in denial. The U.S. is being over-run by spanish-speaking third-worlders. Europe is being over-run by muslims, asians, blacks, and what-ever else decides to scream for asylum. And Canada, I won&rsquo;t even discuss, they have totally lost their country. Which brings me to a very important point. WHO are the ones that are encouraging these illegals? None other than our collective governments. The very people we elected to serve us in government has commited treason against us. Big business and government. I wish I knew what the answer was, I don&rsquo;t. I know alot of others posters here are alot more insightful than I. I would love to read some of their ideas.</p>

			<p>I agree with Sleep here.  The whole English-only movement is just an utterly disastrous distraction, a side issue that draws our attention away from the source of the problem: Demographic change itself.</p>
<p>Obsessing about the English language or teaching English to the budding Third World majority here will do nothing to save Western Civilization in the USA.  Latinos and Sudanese don&rsquo;t become more law-abiding, educated, less prone to vandalism or drug-running just because they learn English.  In fact, English-speaking Latinos have even-higher rates of drug and violent crime than those who don&rsquo;t speak English.  Even worse, focusing on the language is obsessing over a symptom rather than the underlying problem, drawing away scarce resources and hiding a problem that&rsquo;s going to explode very soon.</p>
<p>In short, the only way to save ourselves here is to focus on the demographic assault itself, not on feel-good Band-Aids like English-only laws.  It&rsquo;s demographics, not linguistics, that&rsquo;s killing us as a people here.</p>

			<p>I have a Masters in Linguistics and have worked as a professional linguist and anthropologist. The English Only movement is predicated on the notion that the English language in the US, if not in the world, is in danger of becoming extinct! Surely you jest! It&rsquo;s the other way around. English is like a linguistic nuclear bomb going around the world Hiroshimaing all of these little languages we linguists love to study. </p>
<p>OTOH, I must say that having English as an official language for the US is not a crazy proposition. Most normal and sane states have an official language, or more than one. That we do not here is due to the reigning cultural hegemony of Political Correctness. </p>
<p>I went to a SF Chronicle site the other day and was pleased to see that even a lot of San Fransisco liberals were calling it quits on what they called the PC Left. They were proud liberals, but the PC Leftists were going too far. That&rsquo;s a good sign. The success of a Marxist theory of culture in conservative America never made much sense to me.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been to Canada many times and it&rsquo;s not filthy but a beautiful country that, like the USA, is destroying itself through mass immigration. Both countries are done for unless whites in both wake up and wake up soon.</p>

			<p>Learning Spanish is a good thing.  How many times have you been around a group of them speaking in their native tongue and wondered exactly what they were saying  &mdash;  about you?!  Know thine enemy. <br>

			<p>Knowing Spanish is possibly a good thing, but it shouldn&rsquo;t be crammed down our throats in order to simply get a job in our (formerly) native land, and it should never be force-fed to our children! If the border patrol was allowed to do their jobs, and our elected officials stood up for our country, we wouldn&rsquo;t have to wonder what the alien criminals were saying about us, because they wouldn&rsquo;t be here. English Only is a side issue, true, but I think it is a very important one, and if the droves of non-English speaking &#8220;immigrants&#8221; (documented or not) were FORCED to speak English, a lot of them would find it much harder to live so comfortably in OUR country, and it wouldn&rsquo;t be such a magnet.</p>

<p>I am a Canadian and greatly offended by you calling us &#8220;filthy Canada.&#8221;  I would never say anything of the sort about our wonderful American neighbours.  </p>
<p>Au contraire Americans.  While Canada is in dire straights due to the uncontrollable immigration, I will say one thing for us:  when immigrants come to Canada and enroll in school, they are forced to learn English.  (This excludes Quebec, our francophone province)  Students who speak not a word of English are placed in regular classrooms where all lessons are taught in English.   Within a couple of weeks, the students are beginning to string together full sentences in English.  Being exposed to nothing but the English language forces them to learn it.  Students receive only 40 minutes a day of French language instruction, and that only begins in grade 4.  And why not have our children learn French?  It was the British and French that founded our wonderful country.  </p>
<p>While I am of course against any further immigration to our country, at least we are forcing them to learn our language(s).  </p>

			<p>The underlying reason for this dual language is the real problem. This is the first time in our country&rsquo;s history that we have let a foreign culture take over. Never, even during the great wave of immigrants of the nineteenth century did we ever even think of subjagating the English language. Immigrants (not illegal aliens) learned English. We were not encouraged to speak German, French, Italian, Dutch or any language they brought with them. They were expected to learn the language of this country. It&rsquo;s fine to be able to speak another language, but we expect that anyone becoming a citizen of this country to learn our language, first and foremost. When did the Hispanics get annointed? It&rsquo;s remarkable that a superpower can be overcome and overrun by a third world country and our President remains silent. How about that &#8220;territorial integrity&#8221; speech Mr. President. Tell it to Mexico!</p>

			<p>In response to my objections about the forced teaching of Spanish, I will always get replies like,&#8221;It&rsquo;s good to know a second language,&#8221;, &#8220;are you racist&#8221;? Europeans know other languages, etc. </p>
<p><br>
My objections center around three points:</p>
<p>1)the forced teaching of Spanish is based on an agenda of La Raza&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>2)is desired by the elites in this nation,and</p>
<p><br>
3)is against someones free choice.</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t students pick any language they want?</p>

			<p>I agree it should not be forced, but it would be difficult for a school to have the resources to have so many language choices available.  They seem to have chosen a language that is mutually beneficial.  No matter what the language, teaching a child a second language at such a young age makes it easier for them to learn additional languages down the road.  It also helps them academically, as well as their self esteem.  I think Spanish is convenient because it is the language of our neighboring countries, and will most likely be more useful in the future.  Hard to change what has already happened.  The US is known as the melting pot after all.  </p>
<p>I personally homeschool my kids so that they get the education that I want them to have.  I also personally have sessions with a variety of tutors on www.edufire.com, so that I can pass the languages I learn onto my kids selectively.  Something to think about.</p>

			<p>I also want to add that if you think about it our schools have been providing ESL to Hispanic students for quite some time.  I think it is about time that our kids have the benefit of being multi lingual, as it puts them at an advantage that was previously denied our kids.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m for learning foreign languages, but languages that matter for a child&rsquo;s future academic development and ability (if they so desire) to do business on the global stage.  For the academic part, it&rsquo;s hard to beat Latin and/or Greek.  For the business, it&rsquo;s obvious that the future of the world when it comes to economic commerce will be speaking German and Chinese.</p>
<p>Spanish is hardly important anywhere, except in the Western Hemisphere.  Do you think there&rsquo;s some big rush in, e.g. Poland, to teach Spanish?</p>
