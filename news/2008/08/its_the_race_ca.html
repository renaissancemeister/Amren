<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>The reason aboriginal leaders in Manitoba have no credibility when alleging police racism is because even when they&rsquo;re presented with clear evidence that cops sometimes have no choice but to shoot armed suspects, they still cry racism. </p>
<p>Anybody remember the case of Donald Miles? He was an aboriginal man fatally shot by police outside a Winnipeg gas station in 2001. </p>
<p>He lunged at an officer with a knife and cops had no choice but to shoot him. </p>
<p>The case was investigated by homicide detectives and reviewed by an outside agency, as per the law. </p>
<p>The case went to a coroner&rsquo;s inquest in front of a provincial court judge, which is also mandated by law. </p>
<p>All of the evidence was laid on the table, examined, questioned and tested. The conclusion by the judge was cops did everything in their power to stop Miles &mdash; including emptying three canisters of pepper spray on him &mdash; and had no choice but to shoot. </p>
<p>Did aboriginal leaders come out and condemn Miles for his actions when presented with the facts? Did they recommend to their own people that if asked by police to drop a weapon that they comply? </p>
<p>No. </p>
<p>We all remember the case of Matthew Dumas, the aboriginal man fatally shot by police in 2005 after he lunged at a cop with a screwdriver. </p>
<p>The case was investigated by homicide and was reviewed by an outside police agency. </p>
<p>It went to a coroner&rsquo;s inquest where all the facts were scrutinized and all the witnesses examined and cross-examined in court. </p>
<p>It was a thorough probe and the evidence clearly showed the cop had no choice but to shoot. </p>
<p>Two civilian witnesses &mdash; both of whom were aboriginal &mdash; testified in court they saw Dumas lunge at the officer with a screwdriver. </p>
<p>Did any aboriginal leaders come out and condemn Dumas for his actions? Did they state the obvious, that he was the author of his own misfortune? </p>
<p>Nope. </p>
<p>Instead, they maintained the shooting was an act of racism. In other words, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what the facts of the case are. </p>
<p>Aboriginal leaders will always stand up at press conferences and say cops are shooting native people for no reason. I don&rsquo;t know how they expect the public to take them seriously. </p>
<p>Craig McDougall, an aboriginal man, was fatally shot by police over the weekend. </p>
<p>Cops say he was brandishing a knife. We don&rsquo;t know the facts of the case yet. But we will. </p>
<p>Because, just like the Dumas and Miles cases, it will go to a coroner&rsquo;s inquest where all the evidence will be examined and scrutinized. </p>
<p>If cops used excessive force and shot when they shouldn&rsquo;t have, we&rsquo;ll find out. </p>
<p>If McDougall was not brandishing a knife as his family alleges, we&rsquo;ll find that out, too. </p>
<p>In the meantime, using the McDougall death as another soapbox for aboriginal leaders to make blanket statements about how cops are running around shooting native people for no reason is not only irresponsible and preposterous, it hurts their own cause. </p>
<p>Because every time they make these false claims, they lose credibility with the public. </p>
<p>Their claims recommendations from the 1991 Aboriginal Justice Inquiry have not been acted upon are also bogus. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simply not true. The former Filmon government acted on many of them and the Doer government has acted on many more. </p>
<p>Despite that, many aboriginal leaders refuse to even acknowledge some of the progress that&rsquo;s been made. </p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s just easier to keep playing the race card. <br>

			<p>They don&rsquo;t need the law to judge that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s racism. Only to create enough doubt to make all whites susceptible to crime or worse. </p>

			<p>This is a common complaint in my area too. blacks complain and have rioted because cops shoot and kill black criminals. The fact that the perp was armed and trying to harm or kill the cop, or the fact that the cop is sometimes black, is inconsequential. It is amazing to watch the &#8220;black community&#8221; including the &#8220;black reverends&#8221;, the media, and the local bleeding hearts gang up and accuse the cops of racism. The facts be damned. </p>
<p>The riots did indeed bring the desired effect. The cops have backed off big time on black criminals. Strangely enough the black crime rate, including murders, soared. Now who would have guessed that would have been the net effect of the cops ceasing their &#8220;racism&#8221; towards violent black criminals. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Because every time they make these false claims, they lose credibility with the public.&#8221;</p>
<p>And after the continued loss of credibility comes resentment from whites.  White people are getting tired of it all.  Every last bit of it.  </p>

			<p>What are your Aboriginal Indians there in Canada? are they Native North American Indians, Australian Aboriginal immigrants, Sub Continent Indians? other 3rd world immigrants? Not doubting that the race card is being played, justs wondering if these criminals should be in Canada in the first place.</p>

<p>Of course it&rsquo;s racism. Don&rsquo;t you know that non-whites, especially blacks, should be able to pull weapons on people and kill whomever they please.LOL</p>

			<p>Tom Brodbeck is a good writer.</p>
<p>In recent days, many a Winnipeg Sun reader has e-mailed letters to the editor expressing their frustrations with Aboriginals and their leaders playing the race card over and over again.</p>
<p>The mother of Matthew Dumas had the audacity to describe her darling boy as &#8216;just a regular kid&rsquo;.  So, according to her standards; regular kids go around breaking into houses, stealing cars, getting mixed up in gangs, and into armed standoffs with police!  So much for going to school, participating in sports, music and arts programs, and maybe working at a part-time job somewhere.</p>
<p>It truly makes you wonder how these kids are being raised if they do not respect authority of any kind; be it police, schoolteachers, principals, and parents.</p>
<p>Perhaps some of these racism accusations, justice inquiries, and so forth, could be avoided outright - and so easily - if Aboriginals would teach their children that getting into a standoff or a high-speed chase with police is an argument you are destined to lose.<br>

			<p>White Guilt is claiming more victims at this time than any combination of minority criminals - oops, alleged criminals, that is. Jose Medellin was a victim too of the White conspiracy aimed at punishing all Mexican murder/rapists in American jails.</p>
<p>I have had it with career criminals taking over the streets of every city in the USA. The ACLU [which should officially change its name to American Criminal Liberation Union] has done nothing but ensure murderers, drug dealers, rapists and pedophiles are guaranteed more rights than the average law-abiding citizen. When will white America wake up and take back their country? When?</p>

			<p>The &#8220;aboriginals&#8221; are behaving the same way non-whites in the US do under similar circumstances. They seem to truly be incapable of accepting guilt or fault with any of their own. While some of this might be genetically based as in looking out for one&rsquo;s own, it&rsquo;s probably a good idea to start looking into who taught these people to complain in this fashion, to pressure in this fashion.</p>

<p> &#8220;Aboriginal&#8221; is a term that has recently come into use in Canada. It&rsquo;s used to describe what we used to call Indians and Eskimoes. The latter are often now referred to as Inuit. Because of government benefits and political correctness making it &#8220;bad&#8221; to be White and &#8220;cool&#8221; to be a &#8220;native&#8221; vast numbers of people in Canada with hardly a single drop of Indian blood are now calling themselves &#8220;Aboriginals&#8221;. Canada even has a category for mixed-race types &#8220;Metis&#8221;. In Canada the &#8220;Aboriginals&#8221; commit crimes, cause social problems and are an economic burden on the same scale as blacks in the USA.</p>

			<p>If &#8220;Aboriginal&#8221; kids have no respect for the police and other forms of authority, the so-called leaders of their communities can blame themselves for instilling this attitude in them. </p>
