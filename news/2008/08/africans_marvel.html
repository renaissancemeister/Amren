<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>An influx of workers from China is receiving a mixed reception in Africa, where people both admire and resent the hard-working newcomers&rsquo; pursuit of wealth.</p>
<p>Awe at the efficiency with which Chinese build roads, run shops and manage factories is matched by unease at a growing Chinese presence in Africa&rsquo;s fragile labor markets.</p>
<p>Delight at cheap shirts, toys and shoes sits aside concern at the undercutting of local retailers, Africans told Reuters correspondents around the continent.</p>
<p>The ambivalent response poses a potential risk to China&rsquo;s push to win hearts and minds in Africa, a priority for Beijing amid Western accusations that it is cutting corners on labor and human rights&rsquo; safeguards in its African investment drive.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>However, most African leaders show no reservations in welcoming the billions of dollars spent by China to gain African oil and minerals for its growing economy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Algerian officials say the country had 19,000 Chinese workers in 2007, mostly builders and craftsmen implementing parts of a $200 billion national economic development plan. Some Algerians believe the real number is several times that.</p>
<p>&#8220;YOU MIGHT AS WELL COMMIT SUICIDE&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In neighboring Morocco, respect among retailers for Chinese mercantile determination is tainted with dismay over a slump in profit margins due to Chinese price competition, and over the willingness of Chinese to work for low pay.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;A Chinese worker gets about 300 dirhams ($41) a month. A Moroccan wants around 2,000 dirhams. For 300 dirhams, you might as well commit suicide,&#8221; [said Azzeddine Lahlou, who runs a boutique in Casablanca&rsquo;s Derb Omar district].</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The array of Chinese skills in Africa grows by the month: from doctors and fish farmers to barbers and beauticians. In Gabon, Chinese hairstylists attract a demanding clientele.</p>
<p>More than 800 Chinese state-owned firms are active in the African economy, plus an unknown number of private concerns.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The International labor Organization says about 55 percent of working people in sub-Saharan Africa do not earn enough to lift themselves and their families above the dollar-a-day poverty line, and that about 86 per cent subsist on $2 a day.</p>
<p>This abiding poverty means Africa&rsquo;s workplace can be highly sensitive territory for all foreign investors.</p>
<p>In April, China withdrew more than 400 of its workers from Equatorial Guinea after two Chinese laborers were killed in a clash with security forces during a strike by local employees.</p>
<p>While details were sketchy, it was believed to be the first case of Chinese workers being killed in a labor protest in Africa, and appeared to be one of the most serious disputes to affect a Chinese project in the world&rsquo;s poorest continent.</p>
<p>Some Chinese have become targets for crime or rebels. Separatist Ogaden rebels killed nine Chinese in a raid on an Ethiopian oilfield last year and Chinese employees have been taken hostage in other incidents in Nigeria and Niger.</p>
<p>LOW WAGES, LONG HOURS</p>
<p>In March, workers at Zambia&rsquo;s Chinese-owned Chambishi smelter went on strike and rioted over pay, slightly injuring a Chinese manager and damaging property.</p>
<p>In South Africa, textile sector job losses in recent years created concern about South African imports of cheap Chinese textiles that &#8220;spanned the usually fractious ties between the country&rsquo;s trade unions, businessmen and government officials,&#8221; wrote Chris Alden, London School of Economics lecturer.</p>
<p>Africans cite low wages, long hours and language and culture barriers as problems in working for the Chinese, Alden wrote.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One way of circumventing such problems has been simply to minimise African employment in Chinese ventures.</p>
<p>In Sudan, increasingly wealthy thanks to growing exports of oil to China, thousands of Chinese are working on major projects in energy, roads, dams and telecoms.</p>
<p>They tend to live apart from Sudanese, with their own accommodation, restaurants and shops in a practice often adopted by large Chinese companies elsewhere in Africa.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>An unknown proportion of Chinese workers flout African law by staying on after their contracts expire in order to seek their fortune in Africa, Africans and experts say.</p>
<p>There are also other illegal immigrants, most of whom come on tourist visas with the intention of scouting out opportunities, and then stay when they find them. South Africa appears to be the only country where there are a significant number of Chinese actually smuggled in, Sautman says.</p>
<p>He expects more workplace integration as African managers are appointed in Chinese firms. African-Chinese marriages have taken place, but reliable statistics are hard to find.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are some examples of Chinese bosses of small and medium enterprises having good relations with their employees, but more of Chinese and African workers socializing, despite the lack of full comprehension of each others&rsquo; languages,&#8221; he said.<br>

			<p>&#8220;Africans cite low wages, long hours.. as problems in working for the Chinese.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unreal. These people were starving with no income and now they complain about their hours and pay?</p>
<p>Of course they don&rsquo;t really want jobs, just handouts like their cousins in the First World. </p>

			<p>Africans should not attempt to emulate any race other than their own.Getting their per capita income above a buck or two a day is impossible for them because of their uncontrolled explosive procreation.I just wish all races other than black Africans would leave sub Saharan Africa for good.Money and an economy are foreign concepts that were introduced to them that they cannot ever master.</p>

<p>that&rsquo;s the same affect illegal alien mexicans have on american workers, I thought it was just my imagination when I found myself having to continually lower my standard of living as the number of mexicans increased!</p>

			<p>African-Chinese marriages?  Well, if you kill newborn girls in hopes of getting a boy next time, as Chinese have been doing for years, and if many of the surviving women get &#8220;White fever&#8221;, the poor Chinese workingman may have to lower his standards.  <br>
     I suspect, however, that most of these &#8220;marriages&#8221; will evaporate when the Chinese worker moves on to the next job, or back home.  Were I the Chinese government, I&rsquo;d quarantine anyone returning from Africa,until it can be determined that they were disease-free.<br>

Before their new Chinese overlords are done with them, Africans will be apologizing to the Boers and pleading for the British to come back. </p>
<p>But it&rsquo;ll be too late. </p>
<p>Because they were such jerks about working for the white man, instead they&rsquo;ll end up SLAVING for the yellow man. </p>
<p>And it&rsquo;ll serve them right. </p>
<p>Same goes for the Algerians who waged guerilla warfare on the French and bombed their cafes. &#8220;Ahmed, this is Mr. Wang   &mdash;   but you can call him &#8216;Sir.&rsquo; Ahmed, Mr. Wang owns you now.&#8221;  </p>

			<p>Off topic a litte bit&hellip; I can accept the racist position that on average Asians are smarter than whites who are smarter than blacks. And that an Asian nation, all things being equal, will have less crime than a white one, which will have less crime than a black one - I&rsquo;m beginning to think that Hispanics are wired to be able to work the most of all. So that has me wondering why Hispanics can&rsquo;t get anywhere in the USA. I know the key to great success in the US is in getting a college degree, but the inability of legal Hispanics to get any where in the US has me wondering just how backward and evil we have become.  </p>

			<p>We should be relieved that China has taken up the &#8220;responsibility&#8221; of Africa. It is only the Main Stream Media that is promoting a sort of unease that the US should feel about losing out on the African Markets. It won&rsquo;t make a whit of difference to the US whether China becomes Africa&rsquo;s<br>
new overlord. The only people in the West who are hurt by this is the international bankers for the Kleptocratic Governments who will lose out to the Chinese and Hong Kong bankers. For the average American we will have fewer &#8220;refugees&#8221; from Africa to fill our welfare rosters.</p>

			<p>I have been absolutely amazed at how hard the Chinese work. They don&rsquo;t stop! If they do war like they do work, then we had better not go there at all.</p>
<p>My next-door neighbor is Chinese. I have admired his wiry, glistening frame as he works in his yard. I have also admired the chivalrous way he treats his wife, and the loving way he treats his children. </p>
<p>The press is partly to blame for this. When Whites work this hard (when!, if at all, anymore) the press calls it derisively, the &#8220;Protestant work ethic.&#8221; Sad.<br>

			<p>In the early 1960&rsquo;s a group of blacks from New Jersey decided to go back to Africa to live. I can&rsquo;t remember to which country in west Africa they went, but at the end of one year they all came back to Jersey. A reporter from a local paper was sent to Africa to find out why they didn&rsquo;t stay. He interviewed a government official who said,&#8221; They kept asking about something called welfare.&#8221; I told them, &#8221; I don&rsquo;t know what you are talking about.&#8221; They looked very disappointed and left.</p>

<p>The black propensity for violence and crime is being felt by the Chinese.  It&rsquo;s in the initial stages.  As the numbers of Chinese increase in Africa, so too will black racism increase against the Chinese, until eventually the Chinese will realize the full impact of living in a country where the inhabitants haven&rsquo;t evolved for thousands of years and are stuck in a primitive state.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see what the Chinese response will be.  In their own country, they would come down so hard on the blacks they would probably leave rather than face Chinese wrath, realizing that their usual bad conduct, crime and violence will only get their heads beaten to a pulp, and if they try to demonstrate they&rsquo;ll be thrown in a jail that would make a Russian Gulag look like the Hilton by comparison.</p>
<p>But, it wouldn&rsquo;t be the same in Africa.  In fact, I&rsquo;m guessing that the black standard operating chaos will drive them out.</p>

			<p>The truth is that racial diversity causes disharmony.  It is a problem when a lot of Chinese migrate to Africa.  It is a problem when large numbers of Africans migrate elsewhere.  Yet we here at Amren do get some satisfaction knowing that the major source of disharmony on Earth, Africa,is getting a taste of its own medicine.  Some of you keep saying that the Chinese will ending up ruling over Africa.  I doubt it.  The inevitable short term result will be Africans massacring Chinese - just like in Malaysia. This will happen a few times and the Chinese will return home.  They will find other way of getting African resources - without needed to put a lot of Chinese in harm&rsquo;s way.</p>

<p>Oh, please, spare us the white self-loathing.  Come to my neighborhood in Alhambra, CA on trash day and you can watch the glistening frames of chinese ladies picking though trash looking for recyclables.  I don&rsquo;t know where you live, but I bet you&rsquo;re speaking about a &#8216;token&rsquo; asian family surrounded by whites.  Come to LA and you&rsquo;ll see how totally incompatible these people are with white western culture.  Ya, they&rsquo;ll speak english at the office, but as soon as they&rsquo;re home the act is over.  Their loyalty is not to this country.  I don&rsquo;t care how smart or dumb they are, would rather take white neighbors anyday.</p>
<p>Please people, stop the loathing and admiration of other races and have some pride in your own.  Our future depends on it.</p>

			<p>I am thrilled with this for two reason 1) the Chinese really have it coming to them and believe there is no one, I mean NO ONE better to give them a lesson in staying away from other peoples lands (Russia, Canada, US) then the Africans, 2) For once Africans will see that it is NOT the Europeans, Chinese, AIDS, Colonialsim, neocolonialsim that is the problem with Africa it is get ready for this&hellip;. drum roll rather the AFRICANS that are to blame</p>

			<p>&#8220;Dinosaur hatching&#8221; is using the same worn out, tired, roundabout tactic of pretending to go along with truths while moving in on another attack on whites. Why don&rsquo;t hispanics get anywhere in the US? Because as a group, they aren&rsquo;t very intelligent. Also, saying they are wired to work more than any group isn&rsquo;t true either. In CA they work hard until they can hit a certain level of public assistance, then their work ethic drops a good percentage. The children of these hispanic illegals work even less, most don&rsquo;t work at all, they get into gangs, get pregnant at 13, along with other acceptable activities in most latino cultures. </p>
<p>The Chinese work hard and aren&rsquo;t burdened with the fantasy of PC beliefs. </p>

			<p>I think this is great. Maybe the Chinese will completely take over Africa. Even though it poses a risk to the white world, Chinas&rsquo; rise to power should be seen as a momentous step for human evolution. They are a highly intelligent, industrious, cultured, and hard working people. They even show a lot of respect for the once great white culture. While I&rsquo;m geatly pained to see the white world falling down around us, at least I know that one of the higher races is moving forward. If we as a race can&rsquo;t get past our current moral paralysis/complete laziness/stupidity, we don&rsquo;t deserve to survive as a race. Perhaps China and Asia as a whole will carry the torch of civilization into the next era of human existence.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Oh, please, spare us the white self-loathing.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not white self-loathing to acknowledge that other races <br>
have favorable attributes. </p>
<p>I work in Silicon Valley, and I see many Chinese (yes, I&rsquo;ve seen <br>
some Asians pick through recycling, what&rsquo;s your point?) and <br>
other races. I&rsquo;ve seen lots of white bums too. While white, I <br>
consider myself a race realist, not a white nationalist. Han <br>
Chinese, Koreans, and upper caste Hindus are on average much <br>
more intelligent and better behaved than blacks and mestizo <br>
Mexicans. </p>
<p>Seeing as we already have large numbers of indigenous blacks and <br>
mestizo Mexicans in the US, the important question to me is <br>
how we formulate policies to deal with what we have. </p>
<p>As Jared Taylor has said, ending illegal immigration (&#8220;first, do <br>
no harm&#8221;) and affirmative action would be huge positive steps. <br>
Perhaps that&rsquo;s unrealistic, but less so IMO than race war, <br>
genocide, splitting the US into different countries, etc. </p>
<p>As far as the Chinese in Africa, I don&rsquo;t think the current situation is quite the same as that of diaspora Chinese in <br>
Malaysia and Indonesia. It seems like a win-win, since even if <br>
the Chinese get bloodied in Africa, that helps us. </p>

			<p>The British imported a lot of Indians to work in their colonial regime. When they left, the Indians prospered until the 1970s, when a series of black-on-Indian pogroms drove most of the Asians off the continent. Many wound up in London. </p>
<p>This could happen again. </p>
<p>But I prefer Chinese in Africa to Chinese in the United States or Europe. We should drop our liberal pretenses and fight the Chinese for the land and resources. </p>

			<p>Dinosaur Hatchling,</p>
<p>First you discuss intelligence, asians are smarter than Whites who are smarter than blacks, conveniently leaving hispanics out of the discussion. Then you switch to discussion of working hard physically and hispanics not seeing results in America. Maybe if you had included them in your first observation you would have your answer. Your lack of logic and politicized captilization (which I have seen fit to use also) has caused me to dismiss your post. </p>

			<p>This is quite pleasing until you get to the African-Chinese marriages bit, though that won&rsquo;t be a problem as long as the Chinese govt. dosen&rsquo;t allow any spouses or offspring from these marriages to enter China.</p>
<p>The reason it pleased me is that it shows a) Africans getting a taste of teir own medicine, what with immigrants ruining the labour market, inter-breeding with natives and no doubt having a corrosive effect on the local culture, and b) that Western governments really have scored an own-goal by forcing multiculturalism on their subjects, in paving the way for the Chinese to aggressively assert their interests and predominance in Africa in a way that we no longer can - and to reap the benefits while we continue to slowly decline.</p>

			<p>I get so sick of hearing people like &#8220;Dinasaur Hatching&#8221; talk about how Asians are smarter than whites.  If anything, the average IQ difference between the two groups is about 3 percentage points.  Based on my experience with Asians at work, their speed in generating numbers and replicating work given to them don&rsquo;t compensate for their lack of creativity.  As one person put it here once, most of them have the common sense of a garden hose.  Meanwhile, the two near-toothless redneck whites who showed up in their pickup truck with the Confederate flag on the front to do manual labor at my house the other day were as courteous and intuitive in their understanding of what I had to say to them and in communicating back to me as anyone I work with in my job as a consultant in the hard sciences. Oh, and none of the Asians I work with put in longer hours than I or other whites at my office do.  So all you self-loathing whites can stuff it.  Don&rsquo;t dare tell it to me, at least, not to my face, because you&rsquo;re going to get it back with both barrels. </p>

<p>Much is explained by IQ.   The average black IQ in the U.S. (85) is lower than whites (100).   However, 85 is higher than the average sub-Saharan nation&rsquo;s IQ.

			<p>China is going to use Africa as a way to relieve population pressure while at the same time getting control of land and resources.  They are not going to take any responsibility for anything, they are there to bleed the place dry for oil, minerals, etc&hellip;and use the land for crops to feed the PRC.  Once they are there in sufficient numbers any black attempts at uprising will be met brute force as the Chinese do to their own or to the Tibetans.  If you though Tianamen or Tibet was brutal, just wait.  These people are disciplined and not afraid to take casualties or apply force.  The PRC does not have a rag-tag military either.  Ask anyone who fought them in Korea (my uncle rated them tougher and better than the Japanese).  Remember the hand-wringing about civilian deaths in Vietnam or Iraq/Afghanistan by the left in the US?  Well, not in China. They don&rsquo;t have any white guilt either and no NYT/MSM to cry about how horrible their own nation is.  The Chinese are serious, we are not.     </p>

			<p>The average Chinese demonstrates two superior cultural strengths Africans never developed: determination and discipline.</p>
<p>As that unforgiveable difference becomes clearer to the Africans, Africans will resort to theft and murder, and attempt to drive the Chinese out rather than become outperformed in their own country.</p>
<p>The question then becomes whether the Chinese will leave or establish effective protection for themselves.</p>
<p>And that could become a replay of the Imperialist nineteenth century all over again. </p>

No, it is the Africans who need to be very careful.  <br>
The Chinese are very, VERY good at handling disturbances like this.<br>

Not so long as the Chinese can continue to bribe and buy  Africa&rsquo;s very venal politicians   &mdash;    a thoroughly pragmatic practice about which the Chinese have no Western scruples or qualms.  </p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re able to be generous, now virtually owning the US Treasury, with billions of  US dollars at their disposal  (thanks to America&rsquo;s retailers).   <br>
And when bribery fails, threats will work.</p>

			<p>6:47&rsquo;S post is exactly what I wanted to state as well.  I believe Whites are the smartest of all because we have translated know-how in applied sciences, whereas Chinese have to steal what they have from us.  Their education is rote, which can be good, but it doesn&rsquo;t connect the dots as Whites do, which translates into military strength.  </p>

<p>The Chinese in Africa are capable of the same thing, but it will not be dogs they&rsquo;ll be skinning.</p>
<p>The Chinese are in Africa to stay.  And bred and expand and take over.</p>
<p>And then it may be as the Amish no longer live in Europe, so too blacks will no longer live in Africa.</p>

			<p>Good. It will be a nice experiment to observe. What will be the Chinese style of Imperialism? How will they treat the Africans? Asians are not exactly fond of Africans, by any means. Come to think of it, no race on earth seems to be fond of Africans, except brain-washed, dumbed-down Westerners who&rsquo;ve accepted self-hating inoculations of propaganda.</p>

Rioting?   They had better think twice! They may be good at it, but they&rsquo;ll meet their match.</p>
<p>They will not be dealing with tolerant, permissive Europeans who have been brainwashed with white guilt, or who have been taught to &#8220;turn the other cheek&#8221; or &#8220;love thy neighbor as thyself&#8221;.  They will find (to their grief) that the Chinese are a whole other ball game!</p>

			<p>Unknown to many people, the Chinese imported millions of African slaves.  Where are the African-Chinese you ask?  They don&rsquo;t exist - China only accepted male slaves - who had been castrated.  The Africans who terrorized the Whites out of Africa are going to get what they deserve.</p>

			<p>Posted by at 10:50 PM on August 21 is correct for the most part on his remarks about the Chinese. Behind closed doors, E Asian men are tyrannical with the women, and often times with the children also. This is one reason so many E Asian women chase white men. Lots of people thinks it&rsquo;s because of looks, but in fact white men don&rsquo;t have the reputation for being despots at the dinner table. Farther down, a poster from Silicone Valley remarks on the Chinese and other E Asians being more intelligent than blacks and mestizos. True, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean we need them here. </p>
<p>I agree that the Africans will eventually wade in and massacre droves of Chinese. And the Chinese will eventually run for it, even if they send in some troops to extract revenge. </p>
<p>All of the deteriorating conditions for whites in the US and Europe are good in the long run. Worse is better. When things hit rock bottom, whites will be forced to stop watching their big-screen and listening to the fake right wingers on the radio and for once start looking at who&rsquo;s really in charge. </p>

			<p><i>Come to my neighborhood in Alhambra, CA on trash day and you can watch the glistening frames of chinese ladies picking though trash looking for recyclables.</i></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny you should mention this, because just the other day I took my trash out and there was some Oriental woman digging through the the dumpster (I&rsquo;m in the Phoenix area.) </p>
<p>Say what you want about that, it&rsquo;s honest work and a whole lot more that most blacks are willing to do. About 15-20 years ago when I was a kid, there was some guy who came through our neighborhood once in a while and went through the dumpsters, and he was white. </p>
<p>In any case, I think Courtney&rsquo;s comment about lusting after Chinese men was a subtle dig at some of the men around here who run down white women while extolling the virtues of Asian women. I don&rsquo;t think she was being at all serious.</p>

			<p>During the depression, whites went from house to house asking for food in exchange for manual labor.  Imagine poor blacks doing that.  </p>
<p>Poor whites in that time still had values and still avoided stealing if they could help it.  Tent cities were not the most civil places, but they were not hell on earth like that stadium in New Orleans&hellip;</p>
<p>Witness how homeless people in Japan take care of themselves and refrain from begging.  They do what they can to retain some semblance of a civilized life while living in cardboard boxes.  They still try to stay as clean as they can, and avoid inconveniencing others!</p>
<p>Bottom line - Whites and Asians are AT LEAST compatible in the sense that they can live in a civilized fashion.  Africans, statistically speaking, are simply unable to maintain this level of behavior.<br>

			<p>China never has to formally take over to control Africa as Europeans once did. I can envision asian companies dominating the African economy. This wont be because chinese will work for less(wait twenty yrs for chinese middle-class) but because we cannot expect people without education and stable government to advance very far.</p>
<p>Perphas Chinese companies will bring physical labor/manufacturing jobs to Africa-a structured environment with something for the people to do w/ their time will be good for Africans.</p>

Probably you&rsquo;re right.  China will learn from Europe&rsquo;s mistakes. They will just take the minerals and agricultural products, and avoid getting involved in the politics.  </p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re smart, they should avoid African politics like the plague.</p>

			<p>I dont think there will be much, if any, miscegenation between Chinese and Africans.</p>
<p>In &#8220;Dark Star Safari: Overland from Cairo to Cape Town&#8221;, Theroux mentions how in the 1960&rsquo;s Chinese labourers built the Tanzam Railway from Lusaka to Dar es Salaam.  This obviously took thousands of labaourers several years to complete but, even so President Kaunda proudly proclaimed that the enterprise was completed without a single illicit Chinese-African baby being born.  </p>
<p>The Chinese are famously unfussy about eating any and all wild creatures, but when it comes to mating habits it seems they are more selective than some whites, to the everlasting discredit of our race.      </p>

			<p>One thing the Chinese will never do is try to better the lives of Africans. There will be no Dr. Schwietzers, no Dr. Livingstons, no missionary schools and hospitals, no Univesities<br>
set up for blacks, and never any immigration rights to the home country. All that was a white Christian thing. The Chinese are impervious to human suffering, indifferent to 75,000 Chinese dying in a single earthquake, 40 million in a famine. There will be no demands for human rights. The Chinese will make deals with any dictator no questions asked. As for the &#8220;racism&#8221; con game the Africans play on whites&hellip;let them try that on a Chinese. </p>

			<p>Bantu Education&rsquo;s remarks about the Tanzam railway are quite true. I was living in Dar es Salaam at the time and their behaviour then gave rise to the mistaken African ideas that they were true brothers to the blacks. When the Chinese landed the railway contract, the American came in and  rebuilt the almost 2000 mile road to Zambia. The Americans practically took over the Kilimanjaro hotel, a raucous drunken whoring lot. They may have operated all the heavy equipment, but when it came time to pick up a shovel, that is what the blacks were there for. In contrast, the Chinese sent over much of their equipment in huge packing cases which were carefully unpacked in used as living quarters for their engineers. The did not hire any locals cooks or servants, they did their own dirty work. I lived fairly modestly then, as most other whites I only had a gardener, maid,nanny, cook and an askari. My wife and I did our own driving, unlike those pretentious snobs who had not had to have their own chauffeur, but one for the memsahib as well. The Chinese had no servants, they shoveled with the best of them, they did not bring their own women and were too fastidious the to use the very widely available local supply. This could of course been on orders from chairman Mao or a simply reluctance to bring home the very prevalent aids, syphilis and a host of other STD&rsquo;s. In short, the blacks saw saw what they were supposed to see, poor hard working brothers in arms, not a people who were so disdainful of them that they would not allow them into their shacks. So it will be today and in future. They need raw materials, they will deal with the devil to get them, they do not give a damn if the dictator they deal with kills or starves half his people, that is his business, not theirs. There is only one thing they will never allow that dictator to do and that is to touch any of their property or on of theirs. If the Chinese conquest of Africa goes on at the rate it has been going, in fifty years I can see shrines being erected to  those colonialists they once kicked out. The only good things are that all things are finite, the oil and minerals will one days run out and then the Chinese will pack up and leave as quickly as they came in the first place.<br>

			<p>Good. The world needs Africa&rsquo;s resources and Africans are incapable of extracting and processing them. South Africa used to be the world&rsquo;s no. 1 gold producer. No longer. Apparently &#8220;production problems&#8221; have caused this slippage.</p>

			<p>According to an article in the Financial Times:   <br>
<i><b>&#8220;China reverting to form as the world&rsquo;s workshop&#8221;</b><br>
&#8220;China is set to overtake the USA next year as the world&rsquo;s largest manufacturer,  four years earlier than expected, as a result of the rapidly weakening US economy, according to forecasts for the Financial Times. <br>
 <br>
Last year the US was easily in the top slot accounting for a fifth of the world&rsquo;s total. China was second. The data underline the surge of China&rsquo;s economy in the past 20 years.  In 1990, it accounted for a meagre 3% of global manufacturing.  <br>
 <br>
The expected change will end more than 100 years of US dominance. It returns China to a position it occupied, according to economic historians, for some 1,800 years up about 1840 when Britain became the world&rsquo;s biggest manufacturer after the Industrial Revolution.&#8221; </i></p>
<p>This is followed by another  depressing article on  &#8220;America&rsquo;s decline&#8221;.  And a full-page story on how  former &#8220;junk bond kings&#8221;   Michael Milken and Steve Schwartzman are &#8220;back in demand, selling expertise&#8221; on  &#8220;How to Profit in  Adversity.&#8221; </p>
<p>There is a new book out in France, &#8220;La Chinafrique&#8221;,  about &#8220;Peking&rsquo;s conquest of the black continent&#8221;, which I just bought but haven&rsquo;t read yet.  It contains some stonishing photos of the new Chinese managerial class living like potentates, with African servants standing rigidly at attention and holding their parasols.  Amazing. </p>
