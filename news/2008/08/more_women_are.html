						<p>More women in their early 40s are childless, and those who are having children are having fewer than ever before, the Census Bureau said Monday.</p>
<p>In the last 30 years, the number of women age 40 to 44 with no children has doubled, from 10 percent to 20 percent. And those who are mothers have an average of 1.9 children each, more than one child fewer than women of the same age in 1976.</p>
<p>The report, Fertility of American Women: 2006, is the first from the Census Bureau to use data from an annual survey of 76 million women, ages 15 to 50, allowing a state-by-state comparison of fertility patterns. {snip}</p>
<p>The survey found that in 2006 women with graduate or professional degrees recorded the most births of all educational levels. About 36 percent of women who gave birth in the previous 12 months were separated, divorced, widowed or unmarried.</p>
<p>Unemployed women had about twice as many babies as working women, although women in the labor force accounted for the majority &mdash; 57 percent &mdash; of recent births. Only a quarter of all women who had a child over the past year were living below the poverty level.</p>
<p>Coupled with fertility data collected biannually, the report also revealed longer term trends, including how second-generation Hispanic women are having fewer babies than their foreign-born grandmothers and first-generation American mothers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

															<h2>New Analysis Offers State-by-State Look at Fertility</h2>
											<p>
							<i>U.S. Census Bureau, August 18, 2008</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:<br>
MONDAY, AUG. 18, 2008</p>
<p>* Robert Bernstein<br>
* Public Information Office<br>
* 301-763-3030/763-3762 (phone/fax)<br>
* e-mail: <pio@census.gov><br>
* CB08-125<br>
* Broadcast release [PDF]<br>
* Detailed tables</p>
<p>A new Census Bureau report on fertility shows that 20 percent of women 40 to 44 were childless in 2006, twice as high as the level 30 years earlier. Among other highlights, the report, Fertility of American Women: 2006, found:</p>
<p>* The majority of women with a recent birth (57 percent) were in the labor force.</p>
<p>* Of the 4.2 million women who had a birth in the previous 12 months, 36 percent were separated, widowed, divorced or never married at the time of the survey. Of these 1.5 million unmarried mothers, 190,000 were living with an unmarried partner.</p>
<p>* Second generation Hispanic women tend to have lower fertility rates than either foreign-born Hispanics or those who were third generation (i.e., native and of native parents).</p>
<p>* The highest levels of current fertility (67 births in the year prior to the survey per 1,000 women) were among those with a graduate or professional degree.</p>
<p>The report is the first from the Census Bureau on this topic to use data from the American Community Survey, resulting in state-by-state comparisons of fertility characteristics. Data from the Current Population Survey are also included in the report, permitting historical comparisons of levels of childlessness and births.</p>
<p>This report shows a great deal of variation among states in the characteristics of mothers who had given birth in the previous year. Such mothers, for instance, in the District of Columbia, Mississippi and North Carolina were the most likely to have never married. In addition, recent mothers in California were the most apt to be foreign-born, while those in Mississippi were the likeliest to be poor.</p>
<p>The report also finds that the national birth rate for women age 15 to 50 receiving public assistance in 2006 was about three times of those not receiving public assistance. A decade after the passage of welfare reform in 1996, data show that women in this age range receiving public assistance had a birth rate of 155 births per 1,000 women, compared with 53 births per 1,000 women not receiving it.</p>
<p>-X-</p>
<p>These data were collected from the 2006 American Community Survey and Fertility Supplement to the June 2006 Current Population Survey. As in all surveys, these data are subject to sampling and nonsampling error.

			<p>The downward trend indicated has been for the last 30 years.  But what about during this decade?  It would seem the trend either has leveled off or has been reversed.  How else do you explain all those fertility clinics popping up around the country?  Somebody out there wants to get prgenant   &mdash;   I don&rsquo;t care what their age is.  </p>
<p>Forget about this so-called &#8220;epidemic of childlessness.&#8221;  There&rsquo;s baby strollers, I tell you, over the local Chuck E. Cheese and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.  Don&rsquo;t press the Allan Carlson panic buttons just yet.   </p>

			<p>   I agree with you, Seek. Here in suburban Boston the subways and buses are clogged (and that&rsquo;s the word) with young mothers with baby strollers - almost all of them white. They may not have been breeding 10-15 years ago, but they sure are today.<br>
   And when these babies reach school age they&rsquo;ll be another round of school construction. Which we, the childless majority will pay for just as much as those who incur the expense.</p>

			<p>I find the data hard to believe.  I see more pregnant girls in CA than anywhere I have ever lived.  The real big item here is that 3times as many women are funded by the state now. It will get worse.  Immigrants are rewarded free living for having babies and this is exactly what they are doing.  <br>
The falacy is the idea that continuous population growth is good.<br>
Maybe women know instinctively that overreproduction leads to poverty in any nation.  What rational woman would want to bring a child into a minority dominated global poverty system??<br>
Only the ignorant illiterate do such things.  Unsustainable future resources will determine the reality of overpopulaion.<br>
USA once determined to stay at zero population. This concept was overcome with millions of immigrants who come here from overpopulated countries to reproduce. The attainment of raising standards of living has been destroyed by inviting poverty business into USA.  Povery is big business but overreproduction always leads to poverty or unsustainable quality of life.  V</p>

			<p>The catastrophe awaiting the USA and Britain (as well as Canada and Australia) is a product of mass 3rd-world immigration coupled with differential birth rates.  My background is in statistics and engineering, and I&rsquo;ve done multinational studies looking at TFR&rsquo;s throughout the world.  </p>
<p>The USA is in horrendous shape  &mdash;   the White birthrate here, overall, is now down to 1.4-1.5.  Though it is higher in some parts of the country, in most blue-state big cities, the rate is about 1.2 at the most.  (If it looks higher, that&rsquo;s only b/c public locations are now enjoined to provide services and physical assistance to young mothers, whereas in the past they mostly stayed home and were less visible.)  The Black and Latino birth rates are much, much higher and further compounded with mass immigration.  The Black birth rate is close to replacement, with added numbers of African and Caribbean immigrants.  The Latino TFR is still close to 3 with, of course, further mass immigration.  Forget about 2042  &mdash;   the USA will be majority non-White no later than about 2027.</p>
<p>As bad as the USA&rsquo;s situation sounds, it&rsquo;s even worse for Britain (and similarly bad for Australia and Canada).  British Whites have among the lowest fertility in the Western world, down to about 1-1.1  &mdash;   with British feminism (as seen for example in affirmative action and divorce laws) helping to drive down the birth rate even further.  However, Pakistanis and Somalis in the UK have a birth rate close to 4, Bangladeshis around 3.4, and Caribbeans, Filipinos and Indians also much higher than the White rate.  Canada and Australia also show a similar profile  &mdash;   White birthrate around 1.2-1.4, non-white birth rate around 2.8-3.2.  It&rsquo;s a tragedy all around, but especially so for Britain, since it&rsquo;s an indigenous White country as opposed to a White settler nation that has  &mdash;   nonetheless  &mdash;   embraced the PC &#8220;diversity&#8221; and proposition nation culture of the United States, a toxic practice for the survival of any Western nation.  This is why so many White families in these countries have been moving to raise their families in nations like Denmark, Germany, Austria and Switzerland, where the immigration laws are expressly limited to Nordics and ethnic relations abroad  &mdash;   they will be among the only countries to survive the coming demographic onslaught.</p>

			<p>Maybe one of the reasons fewer women are having babies is because more men are waking up to the fact that should the marriage end in divorce, as most do nowadays, men are going to get raked over the coals in divorce court, regardless of fault.<br>
After the &#8221;lesson&#8221; I received, the first thing I did after my divorce was head straight to the doctors office.  I could afford to pay child support to one woman, but should I eventually have to pay child support to two, I&rsquo;d either go broke or be working 80 hr work weeks just to have enough money left over for my own survival.  No thanks.<br>
Feminism and the &#8221;If I don&rsquo;t get my way, then I&rsquo;ll just divorce you&#8221; mentality that it fostered have, in my opinion, been devastating to marriage and as a result, child-rearing.  The risk vs. reward is just too great for men.<br>
Before I get blasted on here by some of our female AmRen&rsquo;ers, understand that I love women.  But you know as well as I do that the 50 yr marriages of the past are just that; a thing of the past.  With women so willing to file for divorce nowadays and, as a result, transform a father into nothing more than a paycheck and part time dad, is it any wonder why white men are responding by avoiding marriage and avoiding fatherhood?</p>

			<a id="c487710"></a> 
			<p>Cop is exactly right.  The ridiculous divorce laws in the USA, UK, Canada and Australia  &mdash;   which heavily penalize productive people and make no consideration of education, opportunity costs and the hard work that go into building a career  &mdash;   combine with affirmative action (which is a dagger aimed at the earning power of White men in particular) to powerfully drive down the White US birth rate.  </p>
<p>As Cop says, the divorce laws introduce a serious financial deterrent to marriage and children.  While affirmative action, even if geared to &#8220;benefit&#8221; White women, damages the earning power of White men so much, that they become less attractive as mates and fathers.  Along with mass immigration and crowding, it&rsquo;s yet another attack on the White population by the cultural Marxists who run the media and government in the USA, UK, Australia and Canada.  BTW c23  &mdash;   the data you&rsquo;re interested in are available in the Statistical Abstracts, which I&rsquo;m not sure are online.  AFAIK it&rsquo;s public info though usually it&rsquo;s the eggheads and number-crunchers who access it most.  For obvious reasons, the US, British and Australian governments don&rsquo;t explicitly break the numbers down based on race on a national level, but you can easily figure it out based on school enrollments and locality-by-locality birth certificate data (which are compiled).</p>

			<p><i>&#8220;Here in suburban Boston the subways and buses are clogged (and that&rsquo;s the word) with young mothers with baby strollers - almost all of them white.&#8221;  </i><br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br>
That&rsquo;s encourging to read. I hope that is true elsewhere  too.</p>
<p>Here in France, the subways and buses are also frequently clogged with baby strollers.   In America,  I&rsquo;ve seen signs on  buses requiring baby carriages and strollers to be folded up before taken aboard.  Not so in France,  where  everything possible  is done to accommodate babies and mothers.  Here, strollers are pushed right aboard and there is special space provided for them.  Often, there are too many, and passengers, even if elderly, must give up their seats if necessary.</p>
<p>The difference in France is that almost all the mothers and babies you see  are Africans.  Certainly in Paris!  Yes, there are a few white mothers  to be seen  too   &mdash;    but too few, and very often  with non-white babies.   And occasionally, even a  French daddy with a non-white baby (something only seen here).  France is enjoying a baby boom   &mdash;    but they are not &#8220;French&#8221;  babies (although legally, they are, as France is officially blind to any distinctions).</p>

<p>This is so very true, and can&rsquo;t be emphasized enough!<br>
Diversity and the Proposition Nation are deadly bottles that should be labeled for the nation-killing poisons that they are.</p>

Posted by Miroslav </i></p>
<p>Miroslav, I greatly respect what you are saying   &mdash;  -  but, unfortunately, this part is simply not so!   I think you are speaking mostly out of wishful thinking. </p>
<p>Yes, Germany (like Ireland) does offer some special allowances for those of German parentage, but it does not limit immigration to them alone.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Expressly limited to Nordics&#8221;?   Have you visited Geneva or any large German city (eg. Frankfurt, Cologne) and seen the large colored masses there?  Whites would seem to be the minority already. </p>

			<p>To Cop and Miroslav - I&rsquo;m a regular (female) AmRen reader, and it pains me to agree with the points you both bring up. And, I&rsquo;ve warned my son about the exact same things, although he pretty much had it figured out anyway. The results of multiculturalism, with it&rsquo;s sub-set of feminisim, is a continuing tragedy.</p>

			<p>We would think that the in vitro procedures would enable the older women to have children, thus making up for a part of their youthful indigressions, but at $50 thousand a pop few can afford it.</p>
