						<p>A skull found on the banks of a Wairarapa river has turned out to be a European woman aged between 40 and 45 years, who died between 266 years ago and 302 years ago, says a coroner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This suggests that the deceased may have been alive somewhere in the South Wairarapa in or about 1742,&rdquo; said Masterton coroner John Kershaw.</p>
<p>The coroner noted in his findings that despite radiocarbon dating by GNS Science indicating the woman was alive in 1742, historians said the Wairarapa was not settled by Europeans until after the New Zealand Company sent settlers to Wellington a century later, in 1840.</p>
<p>The European discovery of New Zealand was by Abel Janszoon Tasman in December 1642, and history records the first two white women to arrive in New Zealand as Kathleen Hagerty, and Charlotte Edgar, two convicts who escaped from New South Wales and arrived on this side of the Tasman in 1806.</p>
<p>Mr Kershaw said there were few facts available.</p>
<p>Sam Tobin was walking his family dog when he found the skull in October 2004 on the banks of the Ruamahunga River, south east of Featherston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know the deceased was possibly a European female and likely aged between 40 and 45 years,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>In 2005, GNS Science indicated a radiocarbon age between 296 years &mdash; plus or minus 34 years.</p>
<p>Two Auckland forensic pathologists Dr Rex Ferris and Dr Tim Koelmeyer said the skull was an adult female, but was not Maori, and was probably Caucasian.</p>
<p>A Wellington forensic pathologist, Dr Robin Watt, said the woman was probably of European origin, aged 40-45, but he could not discount the possibility of Maori ancestry.</p>
<p>Masterton archivist Gareth Winter said there were no European inhabitants in the area 300 years ago.</p>
<p>Abel Tasman only journeyed along the west coast of the country and did not land anywhere in the North Island. And there were no records of a ship missing in NZ waters during this period.</p>
<p>English explorer Captain James Cook, visited Cape Palliser early in 1770.</p>
<p>Mr Winter noted that whalers used to visit the Wairarapa coast, but records of their activities were very rare.<br>

			<p> This is an very interesting discovery. I recall an book I have read, and re-read over the past number of years, «The Story of the Pacific,» written by an Dutchman, Hendrik Willem van Loon (1882 - 1944). It is written (as are his other texts), in what «Amazon» terms «an dry, personable style.» </p>
<p>  I agree. In the particular text cited here, he refers, in an aside to the «amiable alibis» told him by his grandchildren; when discovered in the act of some childish indiscretion. </p>
<p>  In this text, which is an not disagreable melange of personal observation, anecdote, subjective interpretation, very little analysis, and irony,  as well as history, he refers to an helmet, dredged off the harbour floor, in New Zealand, I believe, or Australia. In the early 20th. century. And then, and perhaps at the present time, on display somewhere in an Museum in the Antipodes. </p>
<p>  van Loon makes the (obvious) observation that European helmets do not travel by themselves. And wonders how it had arrived in an part of the world 60 years before the recorded arrival of the first Europeans. </p>
<p>  He also records that, when an European ship (Dutch, or, perhaps, English), did arrive in that part of the world, the natives were exceedingly hostile, attacked the Europeans when they went ashore, and killed (and kept), an number of them before the survivors were able to pull away. </p>
<p>  I think that he did mean New Zealand, and perhaps, to the harbour at Wellington.  This is fascinating. However, identifying the remains as European is not sufficient. The same sorts of analyses which were performed on the remains dredged out of the Solent with what was left of Henry the Eighth&rsquo;s flagship, Mar Rose, ought to be performed on this find. </p>
<p>  If the results indicate an Southern European,  then the first vessel to make landfall in New Zealand would probably have been Portuguese. At least upon the basis that the Portuguese, in an manner rather unique to other European nations during the «Age of Exploration» habitually took women aboard ship with them. when they sailed overseas. </p>
<p>  The women may have been an passenger aboard an Portuguese «Nau» that became lost, perhaps, or,  sailed out of Goa, on India&rsquo;s north west coast, or, more probably, Pondicherry, on India&rsquo;s south - east littoral (now Tamil - Nadu Karnataka), on an unrecorded (perhaps even illicit), voyage of exploration. The vessel may have been commandeered by the crew, or the complement of roustabouts, layabouts, and petty thieves that the Portuguese crown swept from the gutters of Lisbon or Gadés, and exported abroad;  the so - called «Soldados.» </p>
<p> These ad hoc mutineers would then, just like the mutineers aboard HMS Bounty, would have sought to find an remote and discreet landfall somewhere faraway from Portuguese territory. And Portugal at this time ruled (even if rather waveringly), an immense empire; «Portuguesa Ultramarin» extended from Bahia Brazil, to «la Peninsula» as far east as Taiwan (Formosa).</p>
<p> Knowing this, it is not surprising that an gang of mutineers would have set a course for the south, bracketed as they were if they remained in South/South East Asia, by Portuguese colonies to the East, the West, and to the North. Arab corsairs, sailing out of the heel and toe of the Arab peninsula, and who harried Portuguese (and European shipping)&rsquo; habitually, were also an danger. Only the unknown lands and seas to the South and East offered an possible refuge. </p>
<p>  It is fascinating. And, science is probably the only analytic vehicle which will be able to provide even provisional answers to how an female European was found so far from home. The Portuguese national archives are in an habitually and irremedially chaotic state. Beyond the capacity, the patience of even the most patient and dedicated archivist to order and catalog. A fascinating discovery. Certainly.<br>

			<p>Our ancestors have long been explorers, and much of this has come to light in the past 25 years. From Kenniwicke Man and Seattle to the mummies of the Tarim basin in China, we keep finding the remains of our race scattered throughout the world. The Hopi had a legend of a man they reffered to as &#8220;White Brother&#8221; who they regarded as a prophet. We were obviously in Central and South America as well, which is why when we returned they thought we were their returning Gods. Even the Chinese had an emperor they reffered to as the &#8220;Blonde Emperor&#8221;.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading alot on this recently. It&rsquo;s funny how the Tocharians are kind of a hush, hush subject, though there&rsquo;s some videos on youtube about them. I found out about them by accident. I had read &#8220;Your Heritage&#8221;, by Berterand Comparet, where he spoke of the home of our race as being in the Tarim Basin, so I did a google search on it and found out about the mummies. He wrote the book in the early 60s, but the mummies weren&rsquo;t found until 1988.</p>

			<p>You know, I really, really, really, really wish White nationalists would quit calling Kennewick Man a Caucasian. He was NOT a Caucasian. He was a member of a race that no longer exists, but had similarities to the Ainus, the Moiriori (close to Maori) and the Cook Islanders. IOW, he looks like a Polynesian or an Ainu. And Ainus are *not* White either. Physically they are Australoid and genetically they are NE Asian. I think that when you cross and Australoid with an Asian, you get a Caucasoid phenotype, and that&rsquo;s why you see these Japanese, Ainu, Cambodians, Polynesians, Filipinos and even Aborigines who look somewhat Caucasoid.</p>
<p>Saying Kennewick Man is Caucasian is just dumb (check out the recent scholarly lit on the subject) and it makes WN&rsquo;s look like idiots. There were no Whites or Caucasians in the New World over 1,000 years ago. It&rsquo;s as dumb as Black nationalists claiming Olmecs.</p>

			<p>Since she didn&rsquo;t get there by herself, there has to be more bones and artifacts. Now that we know she was there, we should launch an archaeological search of the area. As usual, it will probably raise more questions than it will answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Masterton archivist Gareth Winter said there were no European inhabitants in the area 300 years ago.&rdquo; He should have said &#8220;no known Europeans&#8221;</p>

Interesting, but not astonishing. The date 1742  is not at all improbable or hard to imagine.  In fact, it&rsquo;s well into the era of European exploration: by about two and a half centuries in fact!  </p>
<p>The early explorations, while sponsored by one European royal house or another, were often quite international in character. Columbus, of course, in the service of Spain, was Italian. So were Verazzano (in the service of France) and Cabot (in the service of England).  Henry Hudson, an Englishman,  was in the service of Holland, and Labrador was explored by João Fernandes Lavrador, a Portuguese in the service of both Portugal and England.  And so on.</p>
<p>Balboa, a Spaniard, was the first to  sail the Pacific in 1513.  And Magellan, a Portuguese in the Service of Spain,  followed in 1522.  Magellan&rsquo;s expedition  contained many European nationalities.  Among those who set out, there were approximately 232 Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, French, English, and German sailors  who  perished on  Magellan&rsquo;s  3-year expedition around the world  (1519-21).  Others were marooned or abandoned along the way (when there weren&rsquo;t enough provisions or ships for everyone).</p>
<p>By the early 1500s, the Portuguese were active all over the islands of the East Indies (now Indonesia) and in that entire region.  Their explorations were  followed  soon after  by the Dutch who  were even more thorough. The first recorded  Europeans  <i>&#8220;known to have reached&#8221;  </i>New Zealand were the Dutch, in 1642.</p>
<p>Not all discoveries would necessarily have been recorded   &mdash;   especially those of ships that were blown off course, or were lost, or had mutinied, or which were captured by pirates.  Furthermore, the early Portuguese discoveries are often shrouded in mystery, as they were a carefully guarded royal secret   &mdash;   something like the Atomic Secrets were to us in the 1940s. They were the source of Portugal&rsquo;s wealth and power. </p>
<p>And then, after Spain colonized the Philippines in the mid-1500s, there were  regular convoys of Spanish ships crossing the Pacific from Mexico to Manila for the next 300 years. Surely, some of those ships were lost to storms or pirates or blown astray. </p>
<p>In short, most of the Pacific was being regularly frequented by passing European ships, even though New Zealand was far off the main routes, long before its official &#8220;discovery&#8221; or settlement by Europeans.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know about that.  I think there was a good chance that the Solutreans were in the New World and they were from Ice Age Europe.  </p>

			<p>The story was cautionsly vague, stating only that the woman   <i>&#8220;was  <b>probably </b> of European origin&#8221; </i>  and <i> &#8220;was  <b>probably  </b>Caucasian&#8221;. </i>   That does not give us much  to go on.</p>
<p>Since the analysis so uncertain, I suggest that she might have been a  person of mixed-race,  such as someone traveling from either  Mexico or the Philippines on one of those Spanish convoys.<br>

<p>I&rsquo;ve recently learned that numerous remains have been found all over the Americas.  Also evidence of technology and religious practices identical to those of Stoneage Europeans. The most ancient sites are on the East coast of the US and it&rsquo;s likely that people crossed the frozen North Atlantic from Europe. This link takes you to a documentary about the Stoneage tribes of the Americas.  I believe National Geographic also made such a documentary called The First Columbus.</p>
<p>The site also contains the Nat. Geo. documentary about the Tocharians - the mummies of western China.</p>

			<p>The idea that we know all about history and prehistory is preposterous.  The recorded data and the relatively few traces found of humankind are mere minutiae compared to the immensity of the human experience over the ages.  </p>
<p>Billions of human beings have passed over the surface of this earth, 99.9999999999% of whom left NO trace whatsoever.  </p>
<p>DNA technology will be invaluable in tracking our footsteps. </p>

			<p>If was European is almost certainly connected with the Portuguese, the first European Power in the region. But they are not the first Caucasians; Arabs, Persians, Armenians, Greeks, Indians and Jews, have been travelling in southeast Asia (close to Oceania), since ancient times&hellip;</p>

			<p>The Soultrean technology is very interesting, but European Whites don&rsquo;t even really show up until 9,000 years ago anyway, and the Soultrean stuff is supposedly from 16,000 years ago? The Soultrean stuff is not even proven to be human made technology AFAICT, but I&rsquo;m not really up on that. Soultrean theory is really freaky, far out stuff and there&rsquo;s no consensus about it whatsoever. No one seems to know what it is. Also, Ainus are not White either! They are Australoids like Aborigines, but their genes are European. </p>
<p>Europeans 16,000 years ago did NOT look like Whites. Around 12,000 years ago, they looked like Arabs. Before that, we don&rsquo;t really know. </p>
<p>Cro-Magnon himself didn&rsquo;t even look White! He looked like a Black man from Africa. Of all prehistoric types, the one that is most commonly confused with Blacks is the Cro-Magnon. Get it? Cro-Magnon is closer to an African than any other type. In particular, Cro-Magnon seems to resemble the Caucasoid-appearing Africans in E Africa such as the Maasai and the Tutsis. The Caucasoid remains from 22,000 years ago in Southern Russia look awfully African to me. The first Caucasoid skull that actually looks like a modern Caucasoid appears about 22,000 years ago. </p>
<p>The Caucasoid race goes back 45,000 years, but before that, they did not look like modern Caucasoids. If you want to see what ancient Caucasoids looked like, check out Berbers, Bedouins, Kalash and some East Indians. Those are probably some of the most ancient Caucasoid types around.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true that there were Tocharians in Eastern China 6,000 years ago or so, but most of that region was populated by East Asians or mixed types. The people in that area right now as so mixed between Caucasian and Northeast Asian that it&rsquo;s really hard to figure out which race to throw them. There&rsquo;s a new theory out that Southern Siberia was the birthplace of the Caucasians, Northeast Asians and Amerindians all three. </p>
<p>This stuff is all really cutting edge, and there&rsquo;s new data coming out all time overturning previous paradigms. It&rsquo;s really confusing and it&rsquo;s changing all the time.</p>

<p>All those you just mentioned are mongrel &#8220;races&#8221;. The Berbers are a mixture of Phonician, Greek, Roman, Vandals, and Arab. They are not what Caucasians looked like.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s possible there may have been some Norse settlements in Labrador and other places in North America about 1,000 years ago. They may have failed due to climate, sickness or hostility from Indians and be lost to us today. Who knows?</p>

			<p>Browser: The European phenotype with White skin shows up about 9,000 years ago. The problem when we go back in time is that we are dealing with races that no longer exist. 12,000 years ago in Europe, Europeans looked something like Middle Easterners or Arabs, not like Europeans. The first Caucasian phenotype doesn&rsquo;t even show up until 22,000 years ago. And it is true that Cro-Magnons are the one non-African skull that is most commonly confused with Blacks. Out of all non-African skulls, the one that looks the most like Blacks is Cro-Magnon! He looks something like the Nilotics such as Maasai or Tutsi. If you look at that type of Black from East-Central Africa, you can see that they do have somewhat &#8220;Caucasian&#8221; looking features.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry, no. I DON&rsquo;T&hellip; &ldquo;get it&rdquo;! How would you know who &ldquo;looked white&rdquo; or who &ldquo;looked black&rdquo; some 16,000 years ago?&#8221;</p>
<p>Going by skulls and skeletons. The skull and skeleton of one Cro-Magnon looks closer to a Maasai than anything else. And white skin supposedly only goes back 9,000 years, but I don&rsquo;t know how they figured that out. They can date genes though.</p>
