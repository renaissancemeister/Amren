						<p>Australian Aboriginal children can count even without having words for numbers, according to a study by British and Australian experts released Tuesday.</p>
<p>The findings run counter to recently revived scientific claims that children can only count if they know the words for numbers, said the lead author of the research, from University College London (UCL).</p>
<p>The study found that four to seven-year-olds from two Aboriginal communities have an &#8220;innate system&#8221; to count with, even though their languages only have normal words for one, two, few and many.</p>
<p>&#8220;Recently, an extreme form of linguistic determinism has been revived which claims that counting words are needed for children to develop concepts of numbers above three,&#8221; said Professor Brian Butterworth of UCL.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is, to possess the concept of &lsquo;five&rsquo; you need a word for five,&#8221; he said, adding that evidence from numerate societies as well as Amazonians whose language does not have counting words have been used to support the claim.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, our study of Aboriginal children suggests that we have an innate system for recognising and representing numerosities .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and that the lack of a number vocabulary should not prevent us from doing numerical tasks,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The study looked at two communities: one on the edge of the Tanami Desert northwest of Alice Springs whose language is Warlpiri; the other on Groote Eylandt in the Gulf of Carpentaria, where the local language is Anindilyakwa.</p>
<p>The researchers devised a series of tasks to test how the children understood numbers, and compared them with an English-speaking indigenous group in Melbourne.</p>
<p>&#8220;For example, children were asked to put out counters that matched the number of sounds made by banging two sticks together,&#8221; said Butterworth.</p>
<p>&#8220;They had to use an abstract representation of, for example, the fiveness of the bangs and the fiveness of the counters.</p>
<p>At the end he said: &#8220;We found that Warlpiri and Anindilyakwa children performed as well as or better than the English-speaking children on a range of tasks, and on numerosities up to nine, even though they lacked number words.</p>
<p>The study was co-authored by UCL and the University of Melbourne, and published in the US journal the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>Australia&rsquo;s indigenous Aboriginal population make up just 470,000 of the country&rsquo;s population of 21 million and remain the poorest and most marginalised of Australians.<br>

			<p>Do these liberals realize how ridiculous they look claiming that the abos are just as smart as white chidren except they can&rsquo;t count past 9?  </p>
<p>Reminds me of a joke that Joan Rivers used to do in the 80&rsquo;s : &#8220;That guy is so dumb he has to take off his socks and shoes to count to 20 and has to get naked to count to 21!&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Australia&rsquo;s indigenous Aboriginal population make up just 470,000 of the country&rsquo;s population of 21 million and remain the poorest and most marginalised of Australians.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is what is known as the &#8216;Politico/Activist Insertion.&rsquo; This silly article uses Aboriginals in the way U.S. articles use blacks when they are attempting to make some point. The &#8216;Point&rsquo; being that those terrible &#8220;racists&rsquo;&#8221; assertions that blacks (Aboriginals) are not up to par intellectually with Whites is poppy-cock, and HERE&rsquo;S the PROOF! Of course, no real PROOF is given, as AR&rsquo;s quip denotes.</p>
<p>As with U.S. papers this Australian rag then furthers the guilt-trip by informing the reader that these &#8216;gifted&rsquo; Aboriginals are &#8220;the poorest and most marginalised of all &#8220;Australians.&#8221;</p>
<p>Never mind that your stock Aboriginal DOES NOT consider himself an &#8220;Australian.&#8221; And to my knowledge no Aboriginal ever considered himself &#8220;poor&#8221; or &#8220;marginalised&#8221; until Leftist Australians informed him of these deficiencies.<br>

			<p>A primitive hunter-gatherer society doesn&rsquo;t need to use measurements or take inventory of surpluses.</p>
<p>Numbers aren&rsquo;t necessary until those first steps are taken to civilization.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Australian Aboriginal children can count even without having words for numbers, according to a study by British and Australian experts released Tuesday&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shows how ignorant some of these so called experts are. Many years ago in an ornithology class the professor recounted how jays, I believe, can count up to 5. If 3 hunters would come into the woods, the birds would take cover and wouldn&rsquo;t show themselves until 3 hunters had left. They did experiments and found that the maximum number they could keep track of was 5.</p>
<p>So, for small numbers it seems the numbers don&rsquo;t have to have names. Even some birds can do it.  </p>

<p>What an &#8216;inverted&rsquo; world Australia must be.</p>
<p>Well, if it got the following in print: &#8220;Aboriginal communities have an &ldquo;innate system&rdquo; to count with, even though their languages only have normal words for one, two, few and many.&#8221; maybe it was worth it. <br>

			<p>We know that Australian Aboriginals only had words (no written language) for the numbers one and two, and the concepts of few and many.  Yet, we&rsquo;re supposed to believe that they have some innate ability to discern up to the number nine.  As if it makes them that much better.</p>
<p>Sorry, can&rsquo;t do the algebra, calculus and differential equations necessary for aerospace engineering or nuclear science with &#8220;innate&#8221; numbers.</p>

			<p>I find it shocking that groups of humans exist who don&rsquo;t even have a word for &#8220;three&#8221;!  I can understand Aborigines not having words like &#8220;trigonometry&#8221;, but not being able to express numbers higher than 2 is really disturbing.  But Australian aboriginals have the lowest group IQs of any humans (62), making <b><i>most</i></b> of them retarded by white standards.  </p>
<p>For those that don&rsquo;t know, Aborigines also never managed to connect sex with making babies.  They thought that babies just happened randomly, as &#8220;spirit children&#8221; who possessed a woman&rsquo;s womb!  Can you imagine being the first missionary to try to explain it to them??  </p>

			<p>Actually, that&rsquo;s not strictly true.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a website with the aboriginal names for the numbers. Some do have a full set up to ten, while many others say &#8220;three&#8221; and &#8220;four&#8221; by basically combining their words for &#8220;one-two&#8221; and &#8220;two-two&#8221;.</p>
<p>A few languages like Pitjantjatjara borrowed the English words for numbers higher than four, adapting them into their own language.</p>
<p><a href="http://zompist.com/aust.htm#australia" rel="nofollow">http://zompist.com/aust.htm#australia</a></p>
<p>However, they are still way behind the Eskimos, who really DO have a full set of numbers (and, being of the East Asian race, have IQs substantially higher than aborigines).</p>

Fish can count up to four says study<br>

Coot Birds Can Count, Study Says<br>

<i>&#8220;Many animals apparently have a brain-wiring that in the right circumstances can support competent counting without verbal symbolic representation of numbers&#8221;</i></p>
<p><br>
But I guess we&rsquo;re supposed to be impressed with the &#8220;natural&#8221; math of the Abo children and their IQs that average <b>62</b>??  Liberal race-deniers truly have no shame.  </p>

			<p>Russian scientist do have found, that Australian Aboriginal children can count without having words for numbers, except one and two. Multiple researches and experiments have helped to approach the problem, build a reliable concept and solve the problem, unfortunately almost. </p>
<p>It has been proven, that while all males can count up to 21, the females are able to count only till 20! Moreover, being shod, the males are able to reach only number 11, while the females can count till 10. The difference supports the notion, that being barefoot, the smartest Abos, both males and females, know how to use their toes.  </p>
<p>Still a part of the problem remains unsolved.  It was noticed, that while wearing pants, the males can count only up to 10, as well as females.</p>
<p>The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced, that a Nobel prize on Mathematics is to be awarded to the Abo, who will be able to explain the mystery and DEMONSTRATE the SOLUTION in front of the committee.</p>

<i>&#8220;At the end he said: &ldquo;We found that Warlpiri and Anindilyakwa children performed as well as or better than the English-speaking children on a range of tasks, and on numerosities up to nine, even though they lacked number words.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>This reminds me of comparing baby chimps to baby humans. At a very early age, they are as &#8216;intelligent&rsquo; as each other. However, human babies quickly surpasse chimps.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ridiculous to even make the statement that at an early age, they&rsquo;re smart as each other. That they match each other at one moment in development does not predict how they will match up at a later moment in time.</p>

<p>Exactly right. And when you think about it, the anthropologists are lamenting the disappearance of the world&rsquo;s primitive languages and cultures. How else to preserve these unless the primitive cultures ARE marginalized; in other words, left alone???</p>

			<p>      Numerosity-now I understand. It must be generosity applied<br>
to arithmetic. The Aboriginess are good at spatial relations. It<br>
has survival value for traveling through what to us would be a<br>
nearly trackless desert. And that part of their brain is large-<br>
the rest: woefully small. A study that possible brings these two<br>
areas together is the estimate of number at a glance such as beans in a jar. Bedeouns were found to be superior to Europeans.<br>
Could this be a combination of visual acuity and a narrow spatial<br>
ability perhaps related again to desert travel?</p>

			<p>I have a Masters in Linguistics and this kind of work is important for Linguistics but mostly for Cognitive Science. I&rsquo;m also very happy to hear that Warlpiri (one of the most maddeningly complex and crazy languages on Earth) and Anindilyakwa (never heard of it) are doing great. If they&rsquo;re going to function in Australian society though, do they not need to know some English. And I would think that these aboriginal languages need to borrow some terms for other numbers since they need them now in modern society.</p>
<p>There is a false claim out there by guys like Richard Lynn that primitive people have primitive languages. That&rsquo;s completely insane. The most wild, nuts, crazy, complex and undecipherable languages out there, that we almost still can&rsquo;t figure out,  are among the more primitive types. Once a group gets civilized, the structure of the language undergoes massive simplification. The more civilized, the simpler and more dumbed down the structure of the language is. The reason is that in a modern society, everything is rush rush rush, and people want to get concepts and whatnot across in the simplest and quickest manner. Because they are busy making money, because time is money, because when they are not making money, they are busy multitasking doing this or that. </p>
<p>In the more primitive societies, humans are still actually quite intelligent, though they may not seem that way to us. We can tell how smart they are by looking at their languages. These people are bored. They don&rsquo;t have much to do all day, so they sit around using their language to be creative and exercise their minds, sort of playing games with language, figuring out the most complicated, difficult and arcane way of saying this or that. That&rsquo;s what we think anyway. </p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;compared them with an English-speaking INDIGENOUS group in Melbourne.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sounds like is a comparison between non-english speaking indigenous groups against similarly indigenous (ie. non white) who happen to speak english. </p>

			<p>Robert Lindsay, I must say that post trying to convince us of the &#8220;brains&#8221; behind primitive languages is hilarious. Tongue in cheek humor is what we need more of.</p>
<p>Wait, you weren&rsquo;t serious were you?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as inane as people telling us the Chinese character &#8220;alphabet&#8221; is more advanced. No, it&rsquo;s not. They never came up with the idea of creating an alphabet that would allow them to produce unlimited sounds from a limited numbers of characters. Instead, they have to memorize 5000 small drawings. </p>

			<p>&#8220;In the more primitive societies, humans are still actually quite intelligent, though they may not seem that way to us.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very odd criterion of intelligence that doesn&rsquo;t demand achievement in anything requiring intelligence, including moving out of the stone age. Even if we accept the idea that the languages of primitives are sometimes &#8220;complex&#8221; (something I&rsquo;m not inclined to believe) this is hardly evidence of intelligence in any meaningful sense. A more &#8220;complex&#8221; thing is not necessarily a more intelligent thing. Where is the Aristotle of the Aborigines?</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&rsquo;t have much to do all day, so they sit around using their language to be creative &hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Which places them slightly below my three-year-old niece. Wouldn&rsquo;t intelligent people think of something more useful to do? Agriculture, perhaps, or writing, or some other rudiment of civilization? It is an indictment not an endorsement of a population that they&rsquo;ve lived virtually the same way for millenia, apart from outside influences.</p>

I don&rsquo;t dispute the concept of or the importance of IQ. Nor<br>
the fact that they are lacking therein. But just maybe, they<br>
have some other things. Their art for example seems very ab-<br>

			<p>I&rsquo;m speaking of Africans, New Guineans, American Indians, Aborigines, the people of the Caucasus, the Andaman Islanders..anyway, just about anywhere you find primitive societies, you find these most incredibly arcane languages. You would have to understand Linguistics to understand what I am talking about. For instance, noun classifiers, polysynthetic languages, languages with all sorts of different kinds of case, mood, and aspect systems. </p>
<p>Many of these languages have noun classifiers where you stick this little marker on something depending on what kind of an object it is - animal, non-animal, or it just go on and on. Long, animate, moves sideways, it could go on and on and you could have up to 1-20 different noun classifiers to stick onto something to tell you what it is. And they keep track of all this stuff. You have verbs that can turn into nouns or adjectives or adverbs, or nouns that can turn into verbs or adjectives or adverbs, you get the picture. </p>
<p>The words are all just bases or roots and you can create most any kind of word out of any other kind of word and the process is almost endlessly creative just by sticking these bases together to make new words for just about anything. You could probably make a million words just be lopping on roots on top of each other. Plus, in these languages they have words for concepts and distinctions we don&rsquo;t even have, so it&rsquo;s a trip to study them.</p>
<p>Well, you guys can laugh all you want, but when we go to study these languages, it&rsquo;s often hard to figure out what the Hell is going on in the language. Try to read a grammar of one of these languages sometime. It&rsquo;s almost impossible for a non-specialist and I can&rsquo;t even get through them myself most of the time. These people do seem stupid on IQ tests and maybe in our modern societies, but when you study these languages, you are just amazed at the genius that went into it. It was like every one of these languages was made by the smartest guy that ever lived or by God himself. </p>
<p>So even primitive humans are pretty smart. They have to be to create an insanely complex language system like that.</p>
<p>Most of these groups are agriculturalists, or herders, or hunter -gatherers, living in some remote valley somewhere. As they move into civilization, the language falls apart and become stupidified and dramatically simplified because in modern society we don&rsquo;t want to screw around with arcane languages and play language games all day. But these people are working in their fields all day and talking and messing around with their languages and sort of playing intellectual games with each other as they speak, because the tongue is so complex and there&rsquo;s an art to using the language in a clever way.</p>
<p>Why no writing system? Who knows? Maybe they really don&rsquo;t need one. They&rsquo;re pretty happy out there, they don&rsquo;t worry about a damn thing, and a lot of these groups have few to no stress related diseases. So don&rsquo;t knock it. Sometimes I envy them.</p>
<p>Blacks don&rsquo;t have a complex primitive-type language, since they speak English, but Ebonics is a full working linguistic system last time I checked. There&rsquo;s really nothing wrong with Ebonics from a scientific point of view. Linguistically, it&rsquo;s just as functional and workable as any other language out there. Scientifically, there&rsquo;s not much difference between the Queen&rsquo;s English and Ebonics. They&rsquo;re both workable and functional linguistic systems that work just fine.</p>

			<p>Well, Micheal T, I have an advanced degree in Linguistics and what you just quoted me saying there is standard knowledge in the field. I&rsquo;m sure all my professors believed it, as they are the ones who told me. Plus the journals talk about it all the time. Linguistics solved the question of &#8220;Do primitive people speak primitive tongues?&#8221; long ago. Answer being NO. I doubt if there&rsquo;s one dissenter in the field. The simplified tongues are like American English.</p>
<p>And Ebonics is certainly not debased or simplified last time I checked.</p>
<p>Cassio: The very act of creating and manipulating one of these out of this world complicated tongues is act of sheer genius in and  of itself. Sit down with a grammar sometime and try to figure out how they thought that system up.</p>
<p>You can go on and on about that Chinese alphabet but it is a work of genius. Also, it looks like it makes Chinese people smart right there having to figure that thing out or else they selected for intelligence to read that stuff. That society is very &#8220;g&#8221;-loaded and part of it is that alphabet.</p>
<p>Go make fun of me all you want. Take your complaints to any working linguist and he will laugh you right out of his office. We quit arguing about this stuff in the field long ago.</p>

			<p><i>&#8220;Wouldn&rsquo;t intelligent people think of something more useful to do? Agriculture, perhaps, or writing, or some other rudiment of civilization?&#8221;</i> -Cassiodorus</p>
<p>Also in defense of Robert Lindsay, the things that are described by the above commenter   &mdash;   agriculture and writing   &mdash;   are not products of intelligence (so long as we are talking about Homo Sapiens), but of necessity.  An extremely bored hunter-gatherer genius might very well dream up a system for writing, but without any sort of demand for it it would be nothing more than a curiosity, and would probably be forgotten after his death.  Much later in history, once populations grew and trade began, a system for record-keeping finally became important, and from there, systems for the expression of language gradually evolved.  </p>
<p>So even though I have no linguistic training, Lindsay makes a lot of sense when he says that materially-primitive peoples have very complex languages.  The larger and more complex the society, the more need one has for a simplified and efficient means of communication, so it stands to reason that a very small group, would, conversely, have a relatively complex (and inefficient) means of communicating.  I don&rsquo;t think it has anything to do with intelligence, though, just the nature and size of the society.</p>
<p>Finally, using the evidence that &#8220;x&#8221; tribe has not yet moved out of the stone age as direct proof of lack of intelligence is rather silly.  A better argument would be that they are in the stone age because of lack of contact, and this lack of contact is also linked to lack of gene exchange, which has kept beneficial mutations from reaching the tribe (even though they are easily intelligent enough to learn reading, writing, and arithmetic).  So the lack of material advancement is a just a symptom of the lack of contact, which is the real cause of any shortcoming in intelligence. </p>

Much later in history, once populations grew and trade began, a system for record-keeping finally became important, and from there, systems for the expression of language gradually evolved.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason to speculate, in the absence of any evidence, what some bored hunter-gatherer may have imagined. Things like writing do begin as a necessity, but they become necessary because a culture has already advanced to a stage that demands it. The first writing systems were essentially bookeeping tools, and were necessary because societies of the ancient Near East (more developed 5,000 years ago than aboriginal societies have ever been) had already developed sufficient trade, agriculture and so on to have things that needed recording. That is, writing, to take one example, presupposes a level of advancement and sophistication; it must be preceded by considerable advancement in other areas. That aborignes never reached this stage of development is simply another way of saying the same thing, as is the observation that they never developed sufficiently to grow their numbers significantly or travel abroad.</p>
<p>&#8220;Finally, using the evidence that &ldquo;x&rdquo; tribe has not yet moved out of the stone age as direct proof of lack of intelligence is rather silly. A better argument would be that they are in the stone age because of lack of contact, and this lack of contact is also linked to lack of gene exchange, which has kept beneficial mutations from reaching the tribe (even though they are easily intelligent enough to learn reading, writing, and arithmetic).&#8221;</p>
<p>The fact that x has not done something in millennia is not exactly proof that x is as capable of that thing as y who has accomplished the thing in question. You cannot base an argument on what someone may have done in an alternate universe of your creation. If a tribe needs genes from outside, there must of necessity be something lacking in the genes they do have. Furthermore, this ignores the genetic pressure exerted by environments of <i>human</i> creation. Positive pressure for ability in mathematical reasoning, literacy, and myriad other traits is extremely unlikely to arise in the world the aborigines have created for themselves. There may be some force external to themselves which prevented in part their reaching some benchmark of civilization, but the fact remains that civilization itself changes its inhabitants in a basic and genetic way, probably much more rapidly than used to be thought (this is the theme, of course, of sociobiology).  There is no positive reason to believe they are as skilled in literacy, mathematics, and the rest. Finally, modern aborigines have had plenty of contact with the world&rsquo;s civilizations; they can hardly plead their case based on their ancestors&rsquo; isolation. Unless the media have been asleep at the wheel for several decades, there is very little reason to believe that the aborigines are an especially intellectually gifted people, language games not withstanding. One doesn&rsquo;t see them, for instance, as the world-beaters in Australian schools, universities or in Australian society generally. There is no positive evidence for aboriginal intelligence, just the usual excuses, which vary in quality but nevertheless only explain (to some extent) the brute fact of backwardness.</p>
<p>&#8220;So the lack of material advancement is a just a symptom of the lack of contact, which is the real cause of any shortcoming in intelligence.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is not true that &#8220;any&#8221; shortcoming in intelligence is a symptom of &#8220;lack of contact.&#8221; Lots of people of all races are just plain stupid, and some races are stupid on average, contact notwithstanding (see &#8220;Africa&#8221;). Further, a shortcoming in intelligence is just that, a lack of intelligence, regardless of its cause. Finally, modern aboriginals are lacking despite &#8220;contact.&#8221; The studies were conducted not in the jungle but in London.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Stupid&#8221; and &#8220;intelligent&#8221; are relative terms. I think that Aboriginals have not evolved the intelligence necessary to compete in our modern society. This is true. But modern society requires an incredibly intelligent mind, much smarter than that evolved by many primitive peoples. We can see the IQ tests for the groups, and for our societies, they lack the brains that they need for the time being anyway (I think they can get smarter pretty quickly). </p>
<p>Point is that any human is a relatively intelligent being just for living in a human society, having a religion, building structures, having some form of medicine, and in particular, having a language. Maybe not intelligent enough to compete in a modern society, but quite intelligent in their own way anyway.</p>
<p>In addition to working as a linguist, I&rsquo;ve also worked as an anthropologist. When you study these groups (I worked with Amerindians) you do realize, that in their own way and about certain things, these people are almost geniuses. Now, Amerindian IQ is somewhat low for modern society. </p>
<p>But the tribe I worked with created these baskets. These baskets require a woman working something like all day long for something like an entire month to make just one. When they are finished, tourists snap them up for about $1000. These things are a work of genius. For one thing, they actually hold water. You can fill the thing up with water and carry it around and it won&rsquo;t leak one drop. That&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>Also, you don&rsquo;t need a high IQ to develop agriculture or work metals. Blacks developed ag in Africa like 9,000 years ago and developed ironworking like 3,000 years ago. </p>

<p>I was not trying to argue that the Aborigines are as intelligent as Chinese or Europeans   &mdash;   you have mentioned the fairly conclusive evidence that they are not   &mdash;   just saying that being in the stone age, per se, does not equal lack of intelligence.  In 10,000 B.C., all people on planet earth were in the stone age and had been there for tens of millenia, but I do not believe that means everybody was equally &#8220;dumb&#8221; at that time, and that subsequent changes in intelligence drove changes in technology.  My uneducated guess is that differences in intelligence ALREADY existed at that time, having developed during previous ice ages and the population bottlenecks that accompanied them.</p>
<p>I do not know enough to say much about whether the arrival of civilization actually sped up selection for intelligence in some additional way, but for a few reasons it does not seem likely to me.  For one, I think agricultural life actually coddles the less intelligent in ways that the hunter-gatherer life does not: the relative abundance of food means that a lot more people of all types survive, whereas in hunter-gatherer groups, frequent lean times might take their toll on the weaker or less cunning.  </p>
<p>And, given your comment that lots of people of all races are stupid, it does not seem likely that a large population size alone speeds up positive mutations (presumably there are equally smart and dumb people within small same-race groups).  </p>
<p>Finally, the positive selection for people good at math, writing, etc., for the vast majority of history was extremely minimal, as literacy in most pre-modern societies was extremely low across the board.  And in some places, like medieval Europe, the highly-competent were made to take vows of celibacy   &mdash;   not a good recipe for reproductive success!</p>

			<p>Linda Gottfredson has a good essay that in part deals with a people called the Ache in Paraguay. They were still living a primitive life up until 1970 or so, but they had great memories of the past century or so, so they were a gold mine. She talks a lot about the stupider people seemed to be getting killed a lot over the course of the past century. Also, after someone got killed for doing something stupid, if he had a little kid, a lot of times they just killed the kid! The net effect was to stop short any genetic idiot tendencies in the guy who got killed for acting dumb. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s primarily a question of degree. The Abos have done very little over a very long time. Even though outside influences sometimes have spread various features of civilization (&#8220;stimulus diffusion,&#8221; in the academic argot) many relatively small population have developed all sorts of improvements (the sort of thing not confined to the tastes of individual cultures but the sort of thing everyone wants when he has it, eg. adequate shelter and plentiful food) on their own.</p>
<p>&#8220;Finally, the positive selection for people good at math, writing, etc., for the vast majority of history was extremely minimal, as literacy in most pre-modern societies was extremely low across the board.&#8221;</p>
<p>This may be true by modern standards, but even your example  &mdash;  medieval Europe  &mdash;  selected for higher degrees of intelligence and other desirable things than aboriginal societies.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that it&rsquo;s really possible to know that, for sure.  In pre-modern societies, the most intelligent (or those seeking education generally) set out for cities, which had very high mortality rates compared to the countryside.  It also seems likely to me that the educated folks had lesser numbers of children than their illiterate counterparts (e.g. later ages of marriage, lessened importance of kids in cities, etc).  So even if the society had some rewards mechanism for intelligence, you would still need to show that the intelligent folks actually had more reproductive success.</p>
<p>As for the Aborigines, I have no idea what sorts of characteristics are being selected for.  Why couldn&rsquo;t it be intelligence?  To say, &#8220;obviously they are NOT selecting for intelligence since they are still in the stone age&#8221; just begs the question.  Robert Lindsay makes a good point that this kind of selection does take place in stone-age societies   &mdash;   and possibly at a faster rate than in civilized societies, since there are no pesky laws getting the way of killing the weaker and less intelligent.</p>

			<p>&#8220;As for the Aborigines, I have no idea what sorts of characteristics are being selected for. Why couldn&rsquo;t it be intelligence?&#8221;</p>
<p>Two reasons at least, so far as I can tell. First, their society simply doesn&rsquo;t demand it. What about aboriginal cultures would require intelligence? The article Lindsay mentions (apparently  he trusts Gottfredson, whom he derides elsewhere, when it suits him) deals with a tribe in Paraguay, not the Abos, so it cannot serve as direct evidence. Furthermore, that &#8220;stupider people&#8221; were being &#8220;killed a lot&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t really address the nature of the &#8220;stupidity&#8221; which resulted in their deaths. It it highly doubtful that this was the sort of abstract intelligence measured either by intelligence testing or by concrete evidence of achievement in something requiring intelligence (literacy, mathematics, etc.). It may well be that a lack of common sense led to the deaths of many; this would probably result in a population generally more suited to life in South American jungles than it would otherwise have been, but I can&rsquo;t see any reason to make much more of it than that, nor would even this very basic kind of street smarts have necessarily spread throughout the population as a result. The Greeks and Romans exposed deformed infants, but of course that didn&rsquo;t eliminate birth defects in their descendants.</p>
<p>Second, I think the proof is in the pudding. If Abo society exerts positive pressure for intelligence, it ought to be manifest <i>somehow</i>, in some way that can be tested or that is obvious in other ways (again, moving out of that pesky stone age). This does not seem to be the case.</p>
<p>You are correct about the movement of intelligent persons from country to city, but in fact this is, relatively speaking, a very modern trend (Murray and Hernstein are very good on this; it&rsquo;s an important aspect of their book and has been overlooked too often). Even a couple of centuries ago a high-IQ person was very likely to remain local, which was of obvious benefit to the community. I&rsquo;m not at all certain that this trend towards movement among the intelligent would pertain among a group like the Abos. For many, many centuries the smarter ones would have had no place to go; in all likelihood they would have remained very close to the place of their birth, which of course would have been beneficial to their tribe and family.</p>
<p>In short, this kind of question is unlikely to be settled with utter, unimpeachable finality. The best we can do is judge from the facts, and the facts and evident reason don&rsquo;t seem to suggest that these cultures select for intelligence as highly as many others do.</p>

			<p>People were dying from things like getting eaten by a jaguar and not finding their way back to the village at night. If you don&rsquo;t make it back the village at night, in some seasons, it&rsquo;s so cold there that you may just die of exposure overnight.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also interesting in the Ache that the classic ghetto situation of a woman having 5 different husbands by the time she was 30 was actually the norm. And it seemed to actually function in their society, so it&rsquo;s not a pathological catastrophe everywhere. There was also quite a bit of promiscuity, and males would take their brothers&rsquo; wives out in the jungle and have sex with them. That worked ok too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not like you, Cassio. I don&rsquo;t immediately dismiss everyone from the POV I disagree with. This is the nature of your most curious sort of &#8220;empiricism&#8221; (ahem). I don&rsquo;t like some of Gottfredson&rsquo;s work. She&rsquo;s biased and pushing an agenda and I think she&rsquo;s just wrong. </p>
<p>But on some other stuff, she&rsquo;s done some very interesting work. Especially on how IQ correlates with making smarter or stupider decisions in life. There&rsquo;s not much of an agenda to drive there, and there&rsquo;s hardly anyone arguing with her. She&rsquo;s extremely bright and does fine scholarship, but IMHO, sometimes she&rsquo;s just wrong. She&rsquo;s also a racist, but that doesn&rsquo;t make her wrong.</p>
<p>You see, Cassio, in Lindsay World, scholars can be sometimes right and sometimes wrong without being totally discredited. Your game is one error invalidates all subsequent work. That&rsquo;s a very well-known logical fallacy as any Logic instructor will point out.</p>

<p>The question is really one of evolutionary psychology.  Evolutionary psychologists suggest that the certain modules developed that may have evolved for a specific purpose, for sample &#8220;hunting&#8221;.  However perhaps this hunting module also had other applications aside from hunting such as writing.</p>
<p>Civilization and the ability to due mathematics may have developed from modules with very different initial functions such as hunting or gathering.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not familiar with native fauna and flora of Australia but I native plants and animals play a major role in human civilization.  </p>
<p>Civilization really got into high gear when humans along the Euphrates and the Yellow River discovered agriculture.  From there we have the development of the first city states, organized warfare, laws,etc.</p>
<p>Perhaps the Aborigines didn&rsquo;t have any native plants that were suitable for agriculture.</p>
<p>Also as the number of human beings expands, due to agriculture, you start to see population pressure.  </p>
<p>Another possibility might be the fact that maybe they might have been well adapted to their environment and simply didn&rsquo;t need to develop &#8220;civilization&#8221;.  Look at the coackroach and the alligator two designs that have been around for hundreds of millions of years because they work so well and don&rsquo;t need change.  Sometimes life doesn&rsquo;t change because its well adapted to its environment.<br>

<p>I think your two reasons conflict somewhat.  In the first, you are assuming that it is the structure of the society which drives changes in intelligence, while in the second, you assume that changes in intelligence will drive changes and advancements in the society.  If the society cannot change without increases in intelligence, yet intelligence cannot increase without a change in society, the Aborigines   &mdash;   and all stone-age cultures   &mdash;   will be forever condemned to live as hunter-gatherers.</p>
<p>But we know this is not the case. If the Aboriginal society doesn&rsquo;t demand intelligence, why would the Egyptians of 8,000 B.C., the Chinese of 7,000 B.C. or the Europeans of 6,000 B.C. demand it either?  Did the pre-agricultural Germans of ten thousand years ago really select for intelligence in some way that the Aborigines did not?  Both societies were semi-nomadic stone-age peoples who constantly warred with each other in competition for scarce resources.  As I&rsquo;ve argued, it does not work to say that the proof is in the pudding, since material cultures may change drastically and over short time periods despite big differences in intelligence.</p>
<p>My guess, as I said before, is that the differences in intelligence originated at least 10k years ago, and possibly as far back as 40k years ago.  Remember: the Aborigines migrated to Australia before any Homo Sapiens had arrived in Europe, and were cut off from the Eurasian mainland repeatedly and for long periods.  Yet, Australia was heavily affected by the ice ages just as Europe and Asia were, and the Aborigines faced many of the same environmental challenges that others faced, so it&rsquo;s difficult to say where the difference in intelligence originated.  Perhaps it occurred even earlier   &mdash;   a &#8220;founder effect&#8221; from the very earliest settlers?  Compounded by physical isolation from the mainland?  Either way I do not think it is a recent development. </p>
<p>It would be a mistake, though, to say that their stone-age technology is a direct result of this low intelligence.  No: the stone age culture is an artifact of their isolation.  Until you reach the upper levels of civilizational achievement, even relatively big differences in intelligence won&rsquo;t have that great an effect in influencing wealth.  Compare Celtic Britain with Pharaonic Egypt, or Roman Gaul with Mauryan India, or feudal Japan with medieval Mali.  In each case, the presumably higher intelligence group had the lesser material standard of living (due mainly to the differences in local resources and agricultural development).  I have no doubt that if Chinese had begun trade with the Aborigines in 2,000 B.C., rather than Europeans showing up 3,500 years later, a bronze-age culture with agriculture and a sizeable population would have developed, despite the innate lack of intelligence.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;This is the nature of your most curious sort of &ldquo;empiricism&rdquo; (ahem).&#8221;</p>
<p>I have no idea what this means. When have I ever claimed that someone&rsquo;s single error invalidates his work elsewhere? You&rsquo;re the one constantly making irrelevant, whining accusations of &#8220;racism&#8221; against those you disagree with. By what possible standard is this accusation of value in determining the truth or falsehood of something? Of what scientific or empirical value is the claim that someone  &mdash;  Gottfredson, Murray, anyone who&rsquo;s not on board with you  &mdash;  is &#8220;racist?&#8221; Why not indulge these childish impulses to the full, and claim that your opponents are &#8220;icky&#8221; or &#8220;poo poo heads?&#8221; &#8220;Gottfredson and Murray are poo poo heads&#8221; has just as much logical significance as &#8220;Gottfredson and Murray are racists.&#8221;</p>
<p>I certainly believe in empiricism, but I am unaware of your having disproved anything I&rsquo;ve claimed on these boards. Quite the contrary; your own assertions are often quite demonstrably wrong, such as your odd assertion about Murray and the non-closing of the IQ gap, or your claim that the psychological profession takes no position on the heritability of IQ. Even the APA&rsquo;s very careful response to The Bell Curve gives the lie to this statement. And of course there&rsquo;s the famous Census of 1825. It&rsquo;s remarkable that you show your face here after that laughably incompetent attempt. When your claims aren&rsquo;t wrong I don&rsquo;t bother with them. </p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s a very well-known logical fallacy as any Logic instructor will point out.&#8221;</p>
<p>True, with the following caveats. 1)You have a very weak grasp of logic, as your sundry defenses of your own positions usually reveal. 2)I don&rsquo;t know anyone personally who is in any need of a lecture on logic from you.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I think your two reasons conflict somewhat. In the first, you are assuming that it is the structure of the society which drives changes in intelligence, while in the second, you assume that changes in intelligence will drive changes and advancements in the society.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is something to your objection, but this circularity seems to be what happens. That is, the <i>natural</i>environment places certain adaptive pressure on humans (as it does on all animal species); mankind in turn changes his environment, and the new modified environment places new pressures on the population.</p>
<p>As to why some environments seem to place this initial pressure (for the selection of intelligence) while others do not, it is certainly an open question. Part of the answer, though not exhaustive, IMHO, lies in the analysis of scholars like Rushton, who believes that temperate climates place more emphasis on the development of intelligence than does life in the subtropics or, I suppose, aboriginal Australia. As for the Near East and Egypt,(not temperate zone environments, of course, but early creators of civilization) that&rsquo;s a valid objection. It must be that there was some degree of genetic differentiation for some reason very early on among these different groups.</p>
<p>Given the state of knowledge in the human sciences, it is certainly safe to say that human populations differ genetically and that these differences are due in part to the natural environments in which humans have lived. It would be very odd if that were not the case. In addition, humans have created many different kinds of societies which in turn exert pressures of their own aided, as we&rsquo;ve seen already, by various kinds of intentional human intervention. </p>
<p>The observable fact is that human groups differ radically in intelligence and myriad other characteristics; these differences are very largely biological, however the symbiosis between natural and human environments are eventually untangled. To take an exaggerated example, I doubt that a Swedish infant raised among the Abos would be as successful an Abo as one of their own, and vice versa.</p>

<p>I strongly agree that the environmental conditions must have played some role in the development of intelligence; however, in the original version of my above post, I did just as you did and assumed that prehistorical Australia was a more favorable environment than, say, ice age Europe &hellip; before realizing that I knew absolutely nothing about Australian climate history.  In fact, it seems that during the ice ages Australia was in a severe drought that parched the entire continent, leaving only a handful of habitable &#8220;refugia&#8221;    &mdash;   much like the refugia from the cold in ice-age Europe!  In other words, the population in both places was sharply reduced and at much the same time, under similar selection pressures.  And even at its best, the Australian continent was not exactly a land of plenty, especially when compared to the fertile farmlands and abundant fresh water of Europe.</p>
<p>So I agree that it is hard to know how much environment influenced the development of intelligence.  It seems logical that those human groups which moved into new and unfamiliar areas with unpredictable climates would have increased selection for cleverness, but among these groups are both the most and the least intelligent races of man.  Something else is clearly going on too.</p>

			<p>Studies have shown that dogs can recognize &#8216;larger vs. smaller&rsquo; amounts of food. Any animal trainer could train most animals at the sound of a click to pick an item up and move it per click. So what does this really prove? </p>
