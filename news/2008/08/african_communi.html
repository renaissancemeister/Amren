						<p>The African community has grown faster than any other immigrant group in the state, but although many emigres are well educated they&rsquo;ve been unable to get jobs that match their professional backgrounds, according to a report released Wednesday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you talk to Africans driving cabs in Chicago with master&rsquo;s degrees you wonder what are the reasons you see this shocking disparity between education and professional status. It reflects a certain attitude toward Africa, that there&rsquo;s not much coming out of Africa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The report surveyed 160 African immigrants in Illinois and found that 53 percent have bachelor&rsquo;s or graduate degrees, a figure similar to 2006 statewide census estimates. The average income among those surveyed was $44,000 a year. Compared to other workers with similar education, Africans are underemployed in jobs that do not take advantage of their skills, according to the report. The disparity often leads to frustration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their expectation was high, and they are really disappointed,&rdquo; said Erku Yimer, executive director of the Ethiopian Community Association of Chicago. &ldquo;Some of them want to go back (to Africa) but the situation is worse there. At least they can survive here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Africans are among the smallest immigrant groups in Illinois, with an estimated population of 43,000. Still, the African community grew 63 percent between 2000 and 2006 compared with 16 percent for Latin American immigrants and 22 percent for Asian immigrants, according to 2006 census estimates.</p>

Have they assimilated to some degree?</p>
<p>Or do they insist on being a typical African, mumbling in their native tongue, and not giving quality service?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot more to the job market than having a degree.</p>
<p>Speaking of language, can someone tell me what &#8220;&hellip;cabs in Chicago with master&rsquo;s degrees&hellip;.&#8221; are?  I know a lot of people with advanced college degrees, but I never heard of a vehicle with one.  </p>

&ldquo;When you talk to Africans driving cabs in Chicago with master&rsquo;s degrees you wonder what are the reasons you see this shocking disparity between education and professional status.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because one receives a degree does not mean he is educated. Our own domestic &#8220;Blacks&#8221; have proven that. </p>

			<p>I have had excellent experiences with Black African cab drivers in Chicago. They are hard working, honest and treat White cab customes with respect. Cab drivers can&rsquo;t fool around with issues of race and crime. They understand how violent poor Black Americans are and who robs and murders cab drivers.</p>
<p>I have a lot of fun talking with them about history, their countries America, Chicago.</p>
<p>The Nigerians have a colorful sayings in English that are not part of the rest of the English speaking world.</p>
<p>What to Nigerians call a traffic jam?</p>
<p>They call it </p>
<p>&#8220;A Go Slow&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we are coming up to a GO SLOW&#8221;.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s what the local, regular Nigerians call some show off Black Nigerians who brags about all the foreign places he has visited.</p>
<p>They call him</p>
<p>&#8220;a Been To&#8221;.</p>
<p>Because he brags that has&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;Been to Chicago, been to Paris, been to London&#8221; etc.</p>
<p>Yeah, lots of Blacks are violent, destructive. But some Black Africans, Black African Americans are good people. </p>
<p>Black African cab drivers are mostly good people. </p>

<p>Haven&rsquo;t we been through this before? The degrees are either bogus or were granted by African universities. Driving cabs is at the high end of what degree holders in Witch Doctor are qualified to do. I disagree with JR, incidentally; several of these African cabbies have tried to rip me off with low-IQ scams, for example, by not having change for small bills. Invoking the police is the magic ju-ju you need to make change appear.</p>

<p>Hmmm&hellip;I wonder why that is&hellip;unless it&rsquo;s because there never HAS been much to come out of Africa&hellip;except Nigerian email letters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of them want to go back (to Africa) but the situation is worse there. At least they can survive here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh, is that all? It&rsquo;s the difference between life and death? And these fools still feel they have the right to complain? Is it any wonder that Americans don&rsquo;t think much comes out of Africa?</p>

The problem with those nice African immigrants is that they always give birth to African Americans. Why, I just met a nice African fellow today who had 2 children, 1 on the way, and no job.</p>

<p>We have enough problems with black americans, why do we need to import more blacks. I&rsquo;m sure many of these black african cab drivers are good people becuase they are often the cream of the crop out of africa. However, often it&rsquo;s not the immigrants but their american offspring that are the problem.</p>

Aw, come on. You&rsquo;re selling Africa short; we got female genital mutillation, polygamy, Islam, canibalism, voodoo, slavery, brutality towards women, children and animals (not to mention every other living thing), tribal hatreds and violence, sexual profligacy and astronomically high STD rates, AIDs, flesh-eating bacteria, baby-rape, well, I could go on, but, I mean, isn&rsquo;t this a glowing resume?</p>
<p>Even though most Americans are as unconscious as heroin addicts, regarding the full and true nature of what&rsquo;s &#8220;comng out of africa,&#8221; they are yet vaguely still aware of enough instinct to keep such alien people at arm&rsquo;s length.</p>

<p>I think you&rsquo;re making a grave error in judgement. Of course, it it can be argued that American blacks represent a subgroup that sprung from the worst of the worst i.e; they got caught and enslaved by other Africans. Then they were bred for their strength and endurance, not for brains. <br>
However, we see utterly bestial behavior from all sub saharan african black populations; savagery, brutality, canabalism, female genital mutilation, baby rape, witch doctoring, murderous exorcisms, a total inability to self-govern, or even maintain the infrastructure that whites built. Plus, Intelligence studies for decades, written, administered and interpreted from many sources-including black africans-are astoundlingly, PLAINLY, consistent. Africans score at or near the bottom of intelligence tests, among the whole world. Now, Liberal PhDs, argue against reality until they&rsquo;re out of oxygen, but even they know the truth. So should you. <br>
Africans are at a very low level in intillectual development. My God man, isn&rsquo;t it screamingly obvious, in the simple observation of their lives accross their continent? <br>
Sure, there are smart and decent Africans, as there are wonderful american blacks. But this idea that African blacks are &#8220;intelligent,&#8221; by and large, is unfounded.  If they were smart, on average, they wouldn&rsquo;t have such horrible societies. <br>
If they were intelligent, they would not  allow, or participate in the wholesale mayhem that pervades their cultures.</p>
<p>(Africans are by and large unintelligent, just as surely as whites are by and large, idiots). The latter is clear in that whites have outlived their collective wisdom. If they were wise, they&rsquo;d never allow their freedom, security and future to be squandered as they are crushed by greedy elites, and ravenous third worlders)!<br>
I guess the one thing in African&rsquo;s favor, is that they drinking the font of life dry, while whites are doing all they can to give it all away. Africans will win, at current rates. They outbreed us by what, five to one? We keep propping them up, and the overbreed. We feed them more, and they breed yet more. Not only are white populations shrinking and being replaced, but practically nobody sees that we&rsquo;re way past the point of no return. This population imbalance is acelerating at an exponential rate, and about the time we&rsquo;re saying,&#8221;gee, it&rsquo;s happening quicker than we thought,&#8221; it&rsquo;s going to smash us like bugs, as it accelerates beyond what anybody imagined. &#8220;Camp of the Saints&#8221; was far too tame. We won&rsquo;t even have that much time.<br>
So, dumb as they are, the Africans have won.</p>

			<p>I once asked an angry black woman, who drove a Mercedes Benz, why she didn&rsquo;t drive an African car, since she thought those white Germans were so &#8220;racist?&#8221;<br>
Of course, we all know her reply;<br>
She doesn&rsquo;t drive an African car, because of all the WHITE RACISM that has prevented Africa&rsquo;s automobile industry from getting off the ground!<br>

<p>As the above poster wrote, how many times do we have to point out that an education in Africa, where university students average about an 84 I.Q., is worthless? (P. Rushton, http://www.vdare.com/misc/rushton_african_iq.htm)  </p>

			<p>&#8220;However, often it&rsquo;s not the immigrants but their american offspring that are the problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>  I think you are right. Some black African immigrants are grateful to be in the United States away from their poor, inefficient and corrupt home countries. However, some do develop a sense of racial entitlement that becomes more pronounced in their American children.</p>

			<p>In Canada, there&rsquo;s a website named <b><a href="http://www.notcanada.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.notcanada.com/</a></b> that was set up by disgruntled 3rd world immigrants who claim there are few jobs available for their <i>alleged</i> university trained skills. Instead of finding work in their respective fields, many must resort to low paying jobs such as cab drivers, office cleaners, etc. </p>
<p>For the most part, this website appears to serve as a place for them to vent and blame the Canadian gov&rsquo;t for the current predicament they find themselves in. They continue to grumble, and many immigrants express an interest in returning to their own countries but claim they&rsquo;re unable to do so because of having depleted their savings. At least, that is the lame excuse they use. </p>
<p>Anyhow, they do have a legitimate complaint because the Canadian gov&rsquo;t not only paints a false picture in encouraging these 3rd worlders to come here, they also sell out working Canadians and our own university graduates numbering in the thousands every year who could easily fill many of these jobs. Instead, Immigration Canada continues to import thousands of dubious degree holders from foreign lands where an academic degree can be easily obtained from corrupt officials.</p>
<p>In addition to the above link, their forum is located <a href="http://www.notcanada.com/forum/" rel="nofollow"><br>

			<p>After looking at the list of national I.Q.&rsquo;s for African countries and verifying their authenticity, I think it doesn&rsquo;t say much for the intelligence of some whites if they think Africans are intelligent, and the puff pieces written about them are true.</p>
<p>One thing is for certain, I.Q. aside, and that is whites are the most gullible, naive people on earth.  It&rsquo;s easy to fool them and make them hate themselves and like people who hate them.</p>
<p>We need communities where only aware whites are allowed in.  We will be small, but strong and united, a force to be reckoned with.</p>

			<p>Having a degree in something, even when it is not from a diploma mill does not automatically entitle one to work in that field.  I am a chemist who is taking night classes in welding.  Apparently wicked American whites have been refusing to work in the microelectronics industry for some years now, forcing the industry to hire H-1bs from abroad.  My hope is to work in the oil and gas industry or in a local machine shop.  My mother&rsquo;s degree was in education.  She has worked as a banker, and not a teacher, for the last 27 years.  How many of these educated Africans were working in the fields they trained for before they left Africa?  Hint: how many highly-paid professionals have any of you other AmRenners met who aspire to pull up stakes and move abroad to become a can driver - or a welder?</p>

			<p>I once asked an angry black woman, who drove a Mercedes Benz, why she didn&rsquo;t drive an African car, &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>What is an Afican car? Never seen one. Must have been designed by ghosts, or white South Africans you mean?</p>

			<p>&#8220;What is an African car?&#8221;</p>
<p>I think Egypt builds a Fiat variant on license.  Basically the same car as the old Yugo.  I don&rsquo;t think Algeria, the other populous North African Arab nation builds cars at all.  The foreign car builder who could deliver at the best bid got a one-year monopoly for civilian vehicles there.  For passenger cars, this was usually the Brazilian branch of Volkswagen.  South Africa builds lots of its own vehicles.  In between South Africa and the Arab north?  Absolutely no auto-manufacturing at all.</p>

			<p>To the commentor who wanted to know what an African Car was, in my experience it is almost any car that someone is stupid enough to leave his keys in.</p>

			<p>Fifty-three percent of adults do NOT hold a degree of bachelor&rsquo;s or higher. Dollars-to-doughnuts, no &#8220;statewide census estimates&#8221; estimate any such thing. Among the general adult U.S. population, about 25% hold a B.A. degree, and an additional five or six percent hold an M.A. or Ph.D. Fifty-three percent may include people who baled out of college after a single drunken semester, plus a few who watched Mister Roger&rsquo;s Neighborhood. I also wonder about the quality of the reporting, with such phasing (pointed out above) as &#8220;cabs in Chicago with master&rsquo;s degrees&#8221; &hellip; Then you have the diploma mills business. I&rsquo;d say these African immigrants are doing well enough that a story wasn&rsquo;t warranted. It&rsquo;s the &#8216;acclimated&rsquo; American Blacks who worry me.</p>

We&rsquo;re supposed to feel sympathy. Sorry. There are millions of Americans who can&rsquo;t find jobs that they are qualified for, thanks to actions of congress. Whole industries have gone to China, Mexico and India, with the blessing of congress.<br>

			<p>Again, the people who post on this website are shooting themselves in the foot. Yes, we know that degenerates occur at a higher rate in black populations and intelligent people at a lower rate, when compared to white populations. By focusing on black this and black that; you&rsquo;re just going to turn a lot of people off. Instead focus on attacking the general degeneracy in society. Attack &#8220;no skill&#8221; immigration from the third world. Make rational and well-constructed arguments and if you&rsquo;re attack as being racist, deny it. Say you never mentioned race at all and are just trying to do the best thing for your country. You&rsquo;ll get a lot farther that way.</p>

			<p>I would venture to say, and feel assured of the accuracy, that an African college degree is equivalent to about the eighth grade here, and, believe me, I&rsquo;m not being facetious nor do I suggest that because of a dislike for the people and their behavior.</p>
<p>And, as I mentioned, I&rsquo;m pretty sure that would be accurate or very close to it.</p>
