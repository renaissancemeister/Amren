						<p>Riot police were deployed on the streets of West London last night to break up a mob of youths intent on disrupting the Notting Hill Carnival after running battles on the streets around Europe&rsquo;s biggest street party.</p>
<p>More than a million people enjoyed the dazzling spectacle of Caribbean costumes, dance and music over the weekend. There was a huge police presence to prevent a repeat of the violence that has marred carnival in previous years and a total of 33 arrests were made for offences including possession of drugs, offensive weapons, robbery and assault.</p>
<p>There was no serious crowd trouble, however, until after dark when gang of around 40 young men started throwing missiles at police officers around Ladbroke Grove. Scotland Yard said that at least one officer was injured after being hit in the face with a bottle before officers in riot gear were sent in to disperse the group.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our officers came under attack from bottles, bricks and other missiles for two hours,&#8221; Chief Inspector Jo Edwards told Times Online. &#8220;There are a small minority of criminals who use the cover of darkness and crowded streets to cause trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>Earlier, six miles across town, police detained no fewer than 151 youths after encircling another mob outside the Oval cricket ground.</p>
<p>Police intelligence suggested that many of the youths were gang members headed for the carnival and they were held at a South London police station for around five hours to prevent a breach of the peace.</p>
<p>After race riots at the 1976 carnival and further violence in the years afterwards, it appeared at one point that the event would be banned. But strict and highly visible policing has managed to calm things down in recent years and reduced the risk of party-goers getting caught up in violence.</p>
<p>Ms Edwards said that only a quarter of the arrests involved crimes with a victim such as theft, robbery or assault. The remainder was the direct result of &#8220;proactive policing techniques&#8221; such as stop-and-search and numberplate recognition.</p>
<p>Those techniques extended to the seizure of 21 dangerous pit bull-style dogs which are used by gang members as status symbols and to intimidate their victims. Weapons seized included knives, a baseball bat and a Taser stun gun.</p>
<p>Scotland Yard had been planning their operation to combat violence at the carnival since May. Tactics included sending letters to more than 200 suspected troublemakers warning them about their conduct and using warrants to search their homes for weapons. The two-day extravaganza, themed Welcoming The World, saw huge crowds party in the streets of West London. Floats &mdash; with themes including Back From Space, Tutti Frutti Sweeties, Creatures Of The Earth and Paradise &mdash; snaked their way through the streets as revellers danced and clapped to the sound of steel drums and Caribbean music.</p>
<p>Although the Met was not claiming a completely successful operation given last night&rsquo;s trouble, Ms Edwards said that there had been no serious violence compared to previous years. &#8220;No-one got stabbed and no-one got shot,&#8221; she said.<br>

											<p>
							<i>AFP, August 26, 2008</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>More than a million revellers packed the streets of west London over the weekend as masquerade floats entertained party-goers at the Notting Hill Carnival, Europe&rsquo;s biggest street festival.</p>
<p>Nearly 300 people were arrested for a variety of offences in connection with the two-day festival on Sunday and Monday, many for drug and alcohol-related crimes, while more than 150 others were detained for the duration of the event.</p>
<p>The vast majority of the festival, however, went off peacefully &mdash; massive crowds danced and clapped in the streets to Caribbean music and steel drums, while colourful masquerade floats moved through Notting Hill, with several stalls selling Caribbean food a short walk away.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s carnival was themed &#8220;Welcoming the World&#8221;, while the floats had themes including &#8220;Back From Space&#8221;, &#8220;Tutti Frutti Sweeties&#8221; and &#8220;Creatures Of The Earth&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have watched the Notting Hill Carnival go from strength to strength each year to become an internationally acclaimed event,&#8221; the capital&rsquo;s Mayor Boris Johnson said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing beats the sounds of the steel pans, the aroma of delicious Caribbean food and the dazzling colours of the costume parade.&#8221;</p>
<p>Michael Williams, marketing director for London Notting Hill Carnival Ltd said that more than one million people attended the festival, though London&rsquo;s Metropolitan Police estimated that a total of 850,000 revellers visited the street carnival over the two days.</p>
<p>&#8220;The carnival is the perfect London spectacle to captivate the world with its dazzling array of costumes and music,&#8221; Williams said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This year&rsquo;s event was enjoyed by more than a million people as the sights and sounds of the Caribbean and other cultures came alive on the streets.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kishor Warasani, a 24-year-old university student living in east London described the carnival as &#8220;absolutely amazing&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I love the music and the dancing and I&rsquo;m definitely going to come again next year,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The outfits are gorgeous.</p>
<p>It did not go entirely without incident, though &mdash; 165 people were arrested on Monday for a variety of offences, including 54 drugs-related crimes, as well as 22 arrests in connection with possession of weapons, in addition to the 110 people arrested on Sunday.</p>
<p>In addition, officers detained 151 people in south London after they received intelligence that a group was travelling to the carnival &mdash; the people were detained to &#8220;prevent a breach of the peace&#8221;, with Scotland Yard saying that allowing them to Notting Hill &#8220;could have put public safety at risk&#8221;.</p>
<p>A spokesman for London&rsquo;s Metropolitan Police said that, except for those carrying drugs or weapons, they would be released once the carnival had been concluded.</p>
<p>The festival was launched in 1959 by post-World War II immigrants from what were then Britain&rsquo;s Caribbean colonies, as a community act of defiance following ugly race riots the year before.</p>
<p>It was held in various parts of London before settling permanently in Notting Hill in 1964. The annual event is now the world&rsquo;s second-biggest carnival after Rio de Janeiro.</p>
<p>The festival has been marred by violence in recent years &mdash; last year, two teenagers were shot, while two men were murdered in 2000, and memories of riots in 1976 linger.<br>

			<p>Another example of racist whites refusing to open their minds and accept other peoples cultures. Whites never consider that other peoples may have different ways of celebrating and expressing joy. Did you ever think that one man&rsquo;s rioting and looting is another man&rsquo;s expression of brotherhood and praise for mankind? no you didn&rsquo;t because you&rsquo;re racist whites, always trying to keep people down</p>

It&rsquo;s a shame the police just can&rsquo;t pull back and let nature run its course. Naturally, if they didn&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;d be condemned for not responding or caring about minorities.</p>
<p>Damned if you do and damned if you don&rsquo;t. With blacks, it&rsquo;s lose-lose.</p>

<p>151 thugs is a &#8220;small minority?&#8221;  And they didn&rsquo;t include the ones they confronted to begin with.</p>
<p>I see also where they&rsquo;re calling the non-whites &#8220;gang members,&#8221; just as they do here in order to try to fool whites into believing the majority of non-whites are o.k.  I mean, it&rsquo;s just the gang members who are the problem, see?</p>
<p>I wonder how they square calling intense, numerous non-white violence gang-related, thinking that dismisses the matter, when they didn&rsquo;t have violent gangs before the non-whites were imported, which is just as bad as having the rank and file involved in crime and violence?  I mean, either way the importation of these people has caused great angst, chaos, and ungodly problems.</p>
<p>Well, we know that change is coming:  It will get far worse.</p>

			<p>Who wants to bet that the &#8216;youths&rsquo; and &#8216;young men&rsquo; who were throwing bricks and bottles were BLACK? If it had been white men who had done this it surely would have been splashed all over the front page of every newspaper that they were white. A once lovely, quiet, and dignified England has fallen, like Alice, into a deep dark hole and has become surrounded on every side by strange creatures with even stranger ways. How very exceedingly sad.</p>

<p><br>
A small minority of criminals cause trouble?!  Jeez, lady!  Criminals are the perpetrators of crime.  You can&rsquo;t have a criminal without a crime having been committed.  &#8220;Criminal&#8221; is not a term used for people unless they have committed a crime.  It&rsquo;s not some neutral demographic category. Jo must have been conflating the racial term &#8220;minority&#8221; with &#8220;criminal.&#8221;  She&rsquo;s getting her politically correct newspeak all mixed up.</p>

			<p>How could somebody stealing another person&rsquo;s things be considered &#8220;brotherhood and praise for mankind?&#8221; </p>
<p>Gang Member: I am going to steal that person&rsquo;s stuff, because I feel he needs to be felt that he has brothers in the hoods.</p>
<p>Normal Person: That doesn&rsquo;t make any damn sense.</p>
<p>As for praise for mankind, these types of people are the ones who are ruining mankind, and should have been detained for a lot longer then two days. They should have been locked up for a week or longer, or if they have a criminal record (which I feel most of these types of people would have) be held as a responsible adult.</p>
<p>Let them commit adults things, and let them feel the adult punishment.</p>

			<p>Do a Google Image Search for &#8220;Notting Hill Carnival&#8221; and you&rsquo;ll see something like Mardi Gras in this country  &mdash;  some pretty weird getups and a large percentage of nonwhites.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a representative sampling:</p>

			<p>Meanwhile, elsewhere in Europe, tens of thousands of White christians gather for the annual &#8216;La Tomatina&rsquo; organised street fight festival held in the town of Bunal in Spain. Lots of info via Wikipedia. There is music, fireworks and lots of dancing. No arrests, police patrols, loud insulting rap, pit-bull dogs, knives, guns, drugs or other typical black african gang related activities as at Notting Hill. Just White people enjoying themselves whilst throwing around 10,000 metric tons of rotten tomatoes at one another, and, at the end, instead of washing blood off the streets, just tomato pulp which is acidic enough to clean the road surface for free. I don&rsquo;t think there is  better proof for avoiding &#8216;cultural diversity&rsquo; and the evil it has historically proved to spawn.  </p>

			<p>Ray Davies is from Muswell Hill, not Notting Hill.  If you want to hear a set of songs about the loss of a community, listen to the Kinks&rsquo; album, Muswell Hillbillies, from 1971.  Britain&rsquo;s destroyers have been at it for years.  Non-White immigration is just one of their more recent, and more successful weapons.</p>

<p>There is no place for English celebrations in England. A few months ago a children&rsquo;s St George&rsquo;s Day parade had to be cancelled &#8220;for health and safety reasons&#8221;, because the city council feared it might offend immigrants.  They demanded that the organisers pay for extra policing for the event.  Note, though, that the six million pound bill for policing the Notting Hill festival was paid by the government.</p>

<p>Look for mediumly high placed diversikins to get right on that. I&rsquo;d be looking for &#8216;german week&rsquo; and &#8216;spanishfest&rsquo; and &#8216;Cezchfest&rsquo; celebrations popping up all across England. This way they can keep whites from having a white celebration too at the same time they can imply everything is all &#8216;equal&rsquo;. </p>

			<p>  Our controlled media has not reported on this violence. The only news report I saw about the Notting Hill Carnival (of crime) was a complementary report on the &#8220;vibrant diversity&#8221; of the &ldquo;street&rdquo; celebrations. On a side note, most of the African students at my university have some relatives in Londonistan. I&rsquo;m afraid merry ol&rsquo; London is not high on my places to visit. This is a shame because it was a friendly and beautiful city thirty five years ago. </p>

			<p>I very much agree with the above. I just want to say how glad I am that the oppressive library system in my county of residence (DeKalb in metro Atlanta) has seen the light and added this web site back. For a while after allowing it, the system banned it. I was very disgusted with such hypocrisy. (I am at the library now. I have no home computer).</p>

			<p>We have the same problems here in Canada. In Toronto, where there is a Caribanna celebration every year, you can always expect some sort of violence. One year they had as many as six murders during the celebration. The same is true in every Canadian city that holds these kind of festivities. </p>

<p>&gt; I was going to write this correction myself, but figured someone else would.  &#8220;Muswell Hillbilliles&#8221; was my favorite, most played album of 1972.  Yep, they&rsquo;ve been at it for years.  I&rsquo;m a 21st Century Man, but I don&rsquo;t wanna be here.</p>

			<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the real gory truth about black behaviour a the Notting Hill Carnival then got to youtube and look at the videos. It took 11,000 officers to police the event, the money being paid from our taxes by the British government. The cowards in the mainstream media did their annual whitewash of this orgy of black violence and not a word was mentioned in the MSM. Police are instructed to ignore all but the most serious crimes. Even so they still got attacked by the cowardly black mob. Nothing unusual there.</p>

			<p>I am almost 100% certain that the youths doing this are not only Caribbean, but Jamaican.</p>
<p>Jamaican immigrants to the UK have arguably been a catastrophe. The first generation was ok, but their kids are a nightmare. Heard that song before. The recent stuff about &#8220;knife crime&#8221;, the homicides by knife that have London up in arms, is almost 100% a Black affair. There was a big to-do about one poor White kid who got killed, but most of the perpetrators, and surely most of the victims, have been Blacks. And a vastly over-representative section were also Pakistanis.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting about the festival in Spain where a bunch of civilized White people throw tomatoes at each other. Could you imagine 1000&rsquo;s of Blacks throwing tomatoes at each other? Very quickly, you would have assaults, gangs would get involved, you would probably have rapes of any females stupid enough to be present, and I figure there would be some homicides or attempted homicides. No way could 1000&rsquo;s of Blacks toss tomatoes at each other without things escalating into at least serious assault. Some of the &#8220;deep masculinity&#8221; crowd can&rsquo;t handle being &#8220;dissed&#8221;.</p>

<p>Yes, but in the northern countries (such as England) February isn&rsquo;t a very nice time to be out in the street carowsing and going wild. <br>
Blacks like to riot when the weather is nice. Ever notice that?  Even in New york, they only riot in the summer.</p>
