						<p>Spain plans to allow legal immigrants from outside the European Union to vote in municipal&rsquo;s elections, Deputy Prime Minister Maria Teresa de la Vega said Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they live with us, work with us and pay taxes like us .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it is fair that they could decide like us through the right to vote,&#8221; she told parliament.</p>
<p>De la Vega said her socialist government would only extend voting rights to immigrants from nations that allow Spanish citizens to vote in their local elections.</p>
<p>She said the government would appoint a &#8220;special ambassador&#8221; to negotiate reciprocity voting agreements with other countries, beginning with nations that have the highest number of immigrants living in Spain.</p>
<p>&#8220;The question presents a variety of difficulties which depend on the laws and situation of each country,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Spain&rsquo;s ruling Socialist Party decided earlier this month at their annual congress earlier this month to extend voting rights to immigrants from outside the EU.</p>
<p>Around 1.5 million residents from EU member states who live in Spain have been allowed to vote in local elections since the early 1990s.</p>
<p>The next municipal elections are scheduled for 2011.</p>
<p>Traditionally a nation that sent workers abroad, Spain has seen the flow reversed in the past decade as its economy boomed.</p>
<p>The number of foreigners living in Spain, a nation of just over 46 million people, has soared from around half a million in 1996 to over five million.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero&rsquo;s government provided an amnesty for more than 500,000 illegal immigrants in 2005.<br>

			<p>Italy is getting it correct, they just went Right, again. Spain just went Left, so what do you expect? You have to go Right to get them out. So is it just Italy and maybe Finland or Iceland that have it right? Not a great track record.</p>

			<p>Like the article on Poland, the situation with respect to Spain stands out like a long range conspiracy.<br>
Spain never asked for illegal immigration let alone the right for immigrants to vote in elections until they accepted their governments approval long after immigrants became situated there.<br>
Could spain be so entranced by Hollywood, drugs, and news media points of view that they, like Poland, are accepting a fate of multiculturalism, ignorance and poverty, lead by government?</p>

			<p>This is  a step toward erasing the value, or even the meaning, of citizenship.  Another little step toward globalism.</p>
<p>One step at a time, this is how these things are taken. That&rsquo;s how America began with desegregating the army barracks.  Then baseball, then the schools, then came forced busing, then affirmative action. Now, it&rsquo;s open anti-white discrimination in contracts, jobs, promotions, scholarships, even beauty contests. Reading the news back in 1954, who would have imagined what half a century would produce?  It&rsquo;s akin to heating the proverbial frog in the pan of water.  The Marxists are patient and they have a long-term view of history. They can wait.</p>
<p>Well, anyway, at least these are <i> legal <i>immigrants, and at least it&rsquo;s reciprocal.  I&rsquo;ll grant that much. It&rsquo;s not entirely bad.</i></i></p>

			<p>   Please correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but wasn&rsquo;t Spain over-ran and pretty much conquered roughly 1000 years ago by muslims? Don&rsquo;t anybody in Spain own a history book? Or read the internet postings about said problems? Somebody please comment about my posting, maybe I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>

<p>Spain was overrun by the Moors in the eighth century. The 12th century witnessed the rise of the Reconquista, with the most notable leader being Rodrigo Diaz de Bivar, otherwise known as El Cid.</p>
<p>By 1492, Castilla and Aragon were united, and the Muslims driven out of their last stronghold of Granada.</p>
<p>In 1992, Spain was invaded by foreigners without one shot being fired.</p>
<p>Nothing sickens me more than to see the land of my fathers overrun and desecrated by hordes of animals with names. I know that there are many in Spain that feel the same way. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, Spain, like most of the West, is in the grip of what can only be described as cultural Marxism. </p>

<p>The government in Finland is calling for more immigrants. Expect the country to join in the fray soon.</p>

<p>Your answer:  In a word,  yes!<br>
===================<br>
<i>&#8220;Please correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but wasn&rsquo;t Spain over-ran and pretty much conquered roughly 1000 years ago by muslims? Don&rsquo;t anybody in Spain own a history book?&#8221; </i></p>
<p>Those history books have been re-written.  Columbus, for example, once the hero of Spain, is now an evil white colonialist who oppressed native peoples.  Young Spaniards are ashamed of him.  His statue was defaced in Barcelona, and the 500th anniversary of  his great discovery (1492)  was virtually ignored.  Guilt for European colonialism is now the fashion.</p>
<p>For example, when I was in Madrid several years ago when Susan Sontag died,  there was a huge display honoring her at the Madrid Public Library and out in the street.  You would think she was America&rsquo;s greatest thinker and writer of the 20th century!  She&rsquo;s much more celebrated there than here. (She&rsquo;s the one who said &#8220;the white race is the cancer of history&#8221;.)  She had also received the Prince of Asturias Prize, Spain&rsquo;s greatest literary honor.</p>
<p>A lot of history depends on how you interpret it.  There is a great deal of historical revisionism going on.  The leftist, anti-white, multicultural version is now in fashion. Guilt is &#8220;in&#8221; and pride is &#8220;out&#8221;.  That determines what is taught.</p>
<p>Like how Moslems and Jews spread civilization to the otherwise barbaric Christians of Europe;   what wise, tolerant rulers they were;  how the arts and sciences flourished under their enlightened patronage &hellip;.  and so on.</p>
<p>The fact is, Spain endured three waves of Moorish conquest   &mdash;   each one more fanatical and intolerant than the one which preceeded it.  And Spain suffered greatly from the 800-year occupation.  But don&rsquo;t tell that to Spain&rsquo;s present socialist rulers.  It doesn&rsquo;t fit with the agenda.  </p>

Spaniard<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>That was the exact anniversary of the Moors&rsquo; expulsion, 500 years earlier, in 1492!    <br>
What an insult to Queen Isabella!   And  a betrayal of everything Spain fought for during the Reconquest, 800 years of bloody struggle.   Such a disgrace.</p>
