<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Real estate experts warn Australia faces an acute shortage of affordable housing as immigration reaches record levels. There are estimates that Australia needs to build an extra 40,000 new homes a year simply to cope with current demand. From Sydney, Phil Mercer reports.</p>
<p>Australia opens its doors to about 300,000 new migrants next year as part of a plan to address a chronic lack of workers. That means the country will see its highest immigration flow in more than 60 years.</p>
<p>An army of temporary and permanent settlers will be granted visas as part of a government effort to sustain a decade-and-a-half of economic growth.</p>
<p>There are three major strands to Australia&rsquo;s migration program: skilled workers, family reunions and humanitarian migrants.</p>
<p>The skilled component is at unprecedented levels, with qualified migrants being recruited in vast numbers from traditional areas including Britain and New Zealand, as well as emerging nations such as China and India.</p>
<p>In demand are accountants, engineers, computer professionals, health care workers and many workers in skilled trades, such as construction workers.</p>
<p>Such an influx of new migrants puts pressure on Australian society and has helped create a housing crisis as demand for inexpensive accommodation in major cities outweighs supply.</p>
<p>Demographer Bernard Salt says Australia is struggling to cope with the expanded immigration program.</p>
<p>&#8220;During calendar 2007 the Australian continent added 332,000 people,&#8221; Salt said. &#8220;Never before in our history have we added that number of people to our population base. 330,000 people per year is a rate and pace that we&rsquo;re not really comfortable with. We&rsquo;re used to growing at the 220, 230,000 per year. Our systems, our infrastructure, our culture can cope with that. We&rsquo;re un-used to traveling at this pace.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thousands of Australians find it hard to buy or rent affordable homes, a problem exacerbated by decade-high interest rates, increasing land prices and taxes.</p>
<p>The government recently began a program to add 50-thousand rental properties for low-income earners to the market. Real estate experts, however, say it will take at least four years before such measures help make housing more affordable.</p>
<p>They say an average wage earner in Australia will struggle to buy an apartment or house in a country where housing inflation has been rampant in recent years, although does show some signs of easing.</p>
<p>The rental market, however, remains strong; a shortage of properties led to double-digit rent increases in the past year.<br>

<p>Immigration is junk-food for the economy, because new immigrants go on a buying spree to set themselves up, and that pumps up numbers.</p>
<p>Growth by mass immgration is a pyramid scheme.  It always demands new investors to keep it from collapsing.  </p>

<p>The airhead elites have been maintaining throughout the West that they encourage immigration because they need tax units to support their social programs, because they don&rsquo;t have enough people.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t be long&hellip;.wait and see&hellip;.before the headlines will be screaming about the problems of over crowding, which this story here touches on, and nothing will be offerred to explain just why they insisted on bringing in so many third world bums, since too few people obviously was just a ruse.</p>
<p>Then the airheads will be calling for unity saying that this isn&rsquo;t the time to &#8220;point fingers,&#8221; but to come together to solve the problem.</p>
<p>These people are absolutely criminal.</p>

			<p>Most of Australia is desert and forest, from the central interior to the west coast. That means more and more people are going to be jamming the cities on the east coast. It should be fun! We could very well see Cronulla riots on a daily basis.</p>

			<p>Most of these &#8220;migrants&#8221; are whites fleeing countries like Britain.</p>
<p>The biggest threat Australia faces is the liberal values these people may have.  Although many are racially awakened by the horrible experiences from their home countries and are fleeing for the simple reason that they no longer think their country is viable anymore.  Many have NOT learned their lesson.  They destroyed their own country and are fleeing the horrible situation THEY created and intend to recreate it in Australia through contamination of the political process there.</p>

			<p>In 1968 the Australians wouldn&rsquo;t let black U.S. soldiers off of the planes for R&R;, so the U.S. military took Australia off of the places we could go to for R&R;, I know, I tried to go there (I&rsquo;m white) What will happen here will be the raping of the forests for building materials and then the slums will come. I&rsquo;m sad for Australia, but sadder for my own country. </p>

			<p>What we are really seeing here is a symptom of Chinese economic supremacy.<br>
You see, for the past 30 odd years, Australia was economically depressed and growth was stagnant.<br>
 Due to Chinese demand for the commodities and minerals that Australia produces in abundance, the country is now awash with cash, and development has speeded up full tilt.<br>
 A similar situation has occurred in Russia.</p>

			<p>Our Govt here is embarking on an ambitious program<br>
to reinvigorate the economy and boost economic growth<br>
The problem is that  key infrastructure,e.g housing,public transport etc is not keeping up with this massive growth and hence the inevitable downturn in living standards,increasing rents and food/water prices  etc.<br>
Another key point is what quality of migrant are we attracting? Highly skilled and educated European migrants are most welcome but I am not too sure about the wave of so called humanitarian refugees from Africa,notably Sudan, who have already attracted much media attention and caused considerable social problems.<br>
 At least we dont have 100 million plus hispanics/Mexicans  on our doorstep,just 200 million plus Indonesians who may one day<br>
decide to head south in search of some more living space.  </p>

<p>  I agree. Australia is a desert continent with limited carrying capacity. Why does Australia need any immigration at all?</p>

			<p>The demographic self-destruction of Australia both saddens and angers me.  It&rsquo;s an extremely dry continent with a very low carrying capacity (20-25 million people tops), and thus Australia had the potential to be a relatively small, but decent White nation with a rugged population healthy young Whites.  Instead, Australia got bamboozled by the same USA-based politically-correct &#8220;proposition nation&#8221; dogma that is also destroying Canada and Britain  &mdash;   with massive non-White immigration, affirmative action and severe urban decline, all in the name of &#8220;diversity.&#8221;  It&rsquo;s starting to make me wonder if US power these days is becoming the single most destructive danger for White countries throughout the world, since our pro-diversity and PC policies are taken as &#8220;models&#8221; to imitate in countries like Australia, without adequate thought about the consequences.</p>
<p>Australia already has a massive population of Sudanese, Lebanese, Indonesians, Malaysians, Indians, Filipinos, Zimbabweans and Pakistanis, and the numbers are going to explode very soon due to open-door immigration policies.  While the Australian Labour Party has exacerbated the problem (just like in Britain), even John Howard contributed to it heavily during his tenure, despite his rhetoric.  Even in the 1990&rsquo;s and early 2000&rsquo;s, most of Australian immigration was based on chain migration policies like post-1965 USA, and Australia&rsquo;s intake of African economic migrants is, per capita, by far the highest in the Western world.  I&rsquo;ve worked on-and-off in Sydney and Perth, and one can see the changes there over the years.  A number of my old Aussie acquaintances have gotten so angry that they&rsquo;ve up and left, often leaving to raise their kids in a country like Denmark, Germany or Austria, which is more nationalistic and with more openly pro-White immigration policies that favor those with a Germanic/Nordic background.</p>

			<p>Excuse me. A third of a million &#8220;immigrants&#8221; to enter as part of &#8220;government effort&#8221;. What can one really say except that Australians should be desperately trying to find out who is doing this to them. The citizens of Western Nations deserve everything coming at them now and in the future, when they remain so utterly clueless and passive. </p>

The last I read, Australia was suffering from a devastating drought that is only getting worse and shows no indication of ending. Yet the Aussie government wants to bring in more people who are going to need and use more water?</p>
<p>Why? How can this make anything better?</p>

			<p>GetBackJack is spot on.  We Australians are a dissapointing lot.  Despite the avalanche of non-whites being &#8216;pitchforked&rsquo; on us, I read recently that immigration was low on the list of community concerns leading up to the relatively recent federal election.  While the displacement of whites in Australia, whose ancestors must be turning in their graves, is of paramount concern to me, the vast (greedy, materialistic, feministic) majority are too concerned about their materialistic survival. </p>

<p>We are wondering the same thing here in So. California.</p>
<p>In LA, the idiot mayor and city government continue to rubber stamp major housing projects even though we are in the midst of a years-long drought.  Also, our freeways are perpetually jammed which should preclude any further development.</p>
<p>As the old canard goes:  &#8220;Follow the money&#8221;  &mdash;  in this case, straight to the mayor&rsquo;s main campaign contributor.</p>
<p>I fear the water Nazis are coming, as it is now:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Mayor Antonio Reconquista today will sign into law a revised city ordinance that limits how and when Angelenos can use water outdoors and imposes water restrictions on restaurants and hotels. </p>
<p>Under the ordinance, residents are prohibited from watering their lawns between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., and watering is limited to 15 minutes a day&hellip;.residents are also prohibited from using a hose to wash off paved surfaces and must use a hose equipped with an automatic shut-off nozzle when washing their cars. </p>
<p>Residential DWP customers who violate the rules will be fined $100&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>Are neighbors supposed to turn each other in for water violations? Will water brownshirts soon patrol neighborhoods looking for violators?</p>
<p>It will get a lot worse as long as LA remains a sanctuary city and continues to add thousands of new housing units.</p>
<p>Thank God I no longer reside in LA and why anyone would want to live there is beyond me.</p>

<p>Australia is one of the few Western countries that has a high birthrate.  They do not have a problem with an aging population like other Western countries.  How many people do you need in a country that&rsquo;s almost all worthless desert and jungle?</p>
<p>If people understood Malthus better, they wouldn&rsquo;t be in such a hurry to reach their Malthusian limits.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Australia is one of the few Western countries that has a high birthrate. They do not have a problem with an aging population like other Western countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Australia has a low *White* birth rate  &mdash;   its higher fertility rate is mainly due to the Aborigines, Sudanese, Lebanese, Somalis, Filipinos and Indians who are there.  It&rsquo;s similar with the UK, where the White fertility rate is abysmal (about 1.1-1.2) while Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Indians, Somalis and Zimbabweans have a birth rate about 4 times as high.  </p>
<p>This is actually a much *worse* situation than a country like Austria or Germany, which also have low White birth rates but largely preclude non-White immigration with their policies (limiting it to Germanic/Nordic immigration from abroad).  These countries may have a couple decades of slow growth, but their demographics will survive intact.  Whereas, Britain, Australia, Canada and of course the USA, are busy race-replacing themselves and will not survive as Western nations beyond another couple decades.</p>

			<p>Even if every single one of these immigrants was White and spoke fluent English I don&rsquo;t think Australia could absorb that many people. Also what about the water table? Huge as it is the great bulk of Australia is very arid and much of it is outright desert. Australia shrinks remarkably small in terms of really good or usable land suitable for human settlement or agriculture. This population increase may not even be ecologically feasible.</p>

<p>Proud Australlian,</p>
<p>We have the same exact problem in the U.S.  The sheep are not asleep in regard to entertainment and pleasure but they&rsquo;ve been unconscious for decades in regard to their prosperity (soon to end) and survival (ending right behind prosperity).  I would bet that the same thing that plagues the U.S. and Australia, is the same thing that plagues each and every white Western country on the globe.</p>
<p>The worst things get, the more I despise whites.  Not only for what&rsquo;s happening but for what they literally have become.  There is no loyalty to tribe.  The only thing they are loyal to is the reflection in the mirror but that is, in fact, also superficial.  They are on their way out, they did it to themselves (and us), and they don&rsquo;t even know it.</p>

<p>One more thing.  Feministic is right on.   Western men have become more feminized over the years (and to some degree Western women have become more masculinized)&hellip;.. earrings and other certain jewelry (both type &amp; placement), hair dye, hair perms, eye brow and groin waxings, pink clothing, manicures, pedicures, and you could even say long hair and ponytails.  All traditionally part of female role playing, they have now become routine grooming and accessorizing for men.  Today, perfectly acceptable.  But is there more to it?  Is it part of a deliberate attempt to de-masculinize Western man thus allowing easy oppression?  A girly man will tend not to fight, correct?  Only time will tell.<br>

			<p>I often read comments talking favourably about Australia&rsquo;s supposed &#8220;skilled&#8221; migration program relative to the US&rsquo; family reunion from conservative immigration commentators. While in comparison it may be a marginally better system, it is still by any account disasterous.</p>
<p>Being married to a foreigner myself (I am Australian born and live in Sydney) I have met many of these so called &#8220;skilled&#8221; migrants. Most of them have Masters degree however they almost all work in low level process jobs (if they are lucky) or hospitality (if they are not) or are dependent on their parents money. The biggest obstacle to their advancement is their English language ability. It is almost impossible to get a professional job without native or near native level English. Those with technical skills may be able to secure entry level positions but their advancement is stymied by poor English. </p>
<p>The only exception is white migrants who already speak English or, because of the similarity of Western European languages, can achieve a high degree of proficiency.</p>
