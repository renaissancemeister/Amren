			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ben Lynfield, Telegraph (London), August 5, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Israel has ended a three-decade-old policy of immigration from Ethiopia, saying it wants to devote resources instead to integrating Ethiopian Jews already in the country.</p>
<p>The move evoked a furious reaction from leaders of the 120,000-strong Ethiopian Jewish community in Israel, who said the &ldquo;discrimination&rdquo; and &ldquo;prejudice&rdquo; of the Israeli government would strand thousands of people in Africa and thwart family reunifications.</p>
<p>Government spokesman Mark Regev said the step &ldquo;will enable us to focus more effectively and invest resources on the successful integration of Ethiopian immigrants&rdquo;. </p>
<p>He added that the government was abiding by a cabinet decision in 2003 to bring to Israel a total of 17,000 Ethiopians, known as falash mura, who are descendants of Ethiopian Jews who converted to Christianity but who consider themselves Jewish.</p>
<p>In accordance with the quota, the falash mura have been flown to Israel at a rate of about three hundred a month since 2003, with the last group of 61 of them arriving yesterday.</p>
<p>Israel mounted major operations &mdash; codenamed Moses and Solomon &mdash; to bring thousands of Ethiopian Jews to the country in 1984 and 1991, depicting the immigration as fulfilment of the biblical prophecy of a gathering of Jewish exiles to Zion.</p>
<p>But the Ethiopian community of about 120,000 immigrants and their descendants is the poorest sector of the Israeli Jewish population and is beset by unemployment and school drop-out rates, although there have also been success stories. </p>
<p>In an affirmative action to make up for their impoverished background the government has underwritten their mortgages.</p>
<p>Ethiopian Jewish groups in Israel say there are still about 8,000 falash mura in Gondar, Ethiopia, seeking to move to Israel. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It is inconceivable that the descendants of Jews and Jews, who need to emigrate, should have the door shut on them,&rdquo; said Danny Kasahon, director of a coalition of Ethiopian lobbying groups. &ldquo;There are many families here who have parents or children in Ethiopia waiting to come to Israel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is discrimination. It cannot be defined by any other word. It could be based on prejudice,&rdquo; Mr. Kasahon added.</p>
<p>Mr Regev denied the charge and said there could still be family reunifications &ldquo;on a case by case basis&rdquo;, but added that &ldquo;collective mass immigration is behind us.&rdquo;<br>
