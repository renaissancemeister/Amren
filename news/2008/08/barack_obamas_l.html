						<p>George Hussein Onyango Obama, Senator Barack Obama&rsquo;s long lost brother was tracked down living in a hut on the outskirts of Nairobi Photo: Guy Calaf, Vanity Fair, Italy</p>
<p>The Italian edition of Vanity Fair said that it had found George Hussein Onyango Obama living in a hut in a ramshackle town of Huruma on the outskirts of Nairobi.</p>
<p>Mr Obama, 26, the youngest of the presidential candidate&rsquo;s half-brothers, spoke for the first time about his life, which could not be more different than that of the Democratic contender.</p>
<p>&#8220;No-one knows who I am,&#8221; he told the magazine, before claiming: &#8220;I live here on less than a dollar a month.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Italy&rsquo;s Vanity Fair his two metre by three metre shack is decorated with football posters of the Italian football giants AC Milan and Inter, as well as a calendar showing exotic beaches of the world.</p>
<p>Vanity Fair also noted that he had a front page newspaper picture of his famous brother &mdash; born of the same father as him, Barack Hussein Obama, but to a different mother, named only as Jael.</p>
<p>He told the magazine: &#8220;I live like a recluse, no-one knows I exist.&#8221;</p>
<p>Embarrassed by his penury, he said that he does not does not mention his famous half-brother in conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;If anyone says something about my surname, I say we are not related. I am ashamed,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>For ten years George Obama lived rough. However he now hopes to try to sort his life out by starting a course at a local technical college.</p>
<p>He has only met his famous older brother twice &mdash; once when he was just five and the last time in 2006 when Senator Obama was on a tour of East Africa and visited Nairobi.</p>
<p>The Illinois senator mentions his brother in his autobiography, describing him in just one passing paragraph as a &#8220;beautiful boy with a rounded head&#8221;.</p>
<p>Of their second meeting, George Obama said: &#8220;It was very brief, we spoke for just a few minutes. It was like meeting a complete stranger.&#8221;</p>
<p>George added he was no longer in contact with his mother and said: &#8220;I have had to learn to live and take what I need.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huruma is a tough place, last January during the elections there was rioting and six people were hacked to death. The police don&rsquo;t even arrest you they just shoot you.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have seen two of my friends killed. I have scars from defending myself with my fists. I am good with my fists.&#8221;<br>

While one can&rsquo;t select one&rsquo;s blood relatives, one has to wonder why the great liberal-hope doesn&rsquo;t do more to help his relatives.</p>
<p>I know he wants to take my money to help strangers but why doesn&rsquo;t he lead by example and give until it raises his brother (and all his relatives) out of poverty? Then again, who knows how much aid he plans to give his African &#8216;brothers&rsquo; as a whole?<br>

<p>Yes, he&rsquo;s the one they consider the wealthy recluse who lives in what would be considered a Kenyan mansion.  He has 40 billion dollars, and was thought to be quite wealthy until it was discovered the 40 billion was all in Zimbabwe currency, which would only buy a loaf of bread.</p>
<p>If Obama gets in will these same kinds of huts be permanent fixtures on the white house grounds?</p>

			<p>He lives on $1 a month.  Yet, his half sister in law&rsquo;s salary from the University of Chicago Hospital tripled when her husband became a U.S. Senator.  BHO is fond of quoting the Bible when he says we should do for the least of our brothers.  Maybe he should take care of his half brother who is &#8220;low&#8221; on the economic totem pole.</p>

			<p>Guess OBAMA&rsquo;s first offical act would be to bring 20 million Kenyans here to live OFF American welfare checks. Like the somewhat UNDER 20 million or so Blacks we now support.</p>
<p>Then Obama can beat the hollow log drum for REPARATIONS; give EVERY Black or person claiming to have a lot of Black blood in his/her family tree a heft hand-out, courtesy of the U.S. taxpayers&hellip; then a half-decade later we can hear the plaintive wails: &#8220;They didn&rsquo;t give us &#8216;nuff reparations. We demands more!&#8221;</p>

<p>Posted by Peejay in Frisco at 7:12 PM on August 20</p>
<p>That is not the reason why we refer to each other as Brother, the reason is because after the brutal systematic slavery that was perpetrated on blacks, being torn from our families, raped, indoctrinated White Christian beliefs. Because we taken from various parts of Africa and put together(Whites being afraid we would have tried to start a mutiny)there are so many languages spoken in Africa about 57, this would be the ideal thing to lesson the threat on our captors.<br>
We had a very difficult time communicating, but in the new world, learning english, we had to form a bond, learn the language and at the same time trying to speak having to live with one-another, our way of speaking or Ebonics as some want to call it evolved from this. Being the same race, coming from the same continent. We ARE brothers in that sense.<br>
By the way, there are also many Whites that have siblings from various marriages and many of them, how did you put it, &#8220;do not know who their sperm donors are&#8221; is it more prevalent in the black community yes, and there are many, many reasons for it. But in the white community, it&rsquo;s not quite that far off either. Especially in the lower income branch. Most blacks that I know, have &#8220;Whole&#8221; siblings, but I know a few that don&rsquo;t. Same goes for my white friends. Try not to pigeon hole people, remember; just like whites, blacks are not a monolithic group.<br>
There is your answer, now you don&rsquo;t have to speculate.</p>

			<p>How much would it cost this guy to send a few dollars a month to his half brother and grandmother?</p>
<p>Something is very wrong here - how can people vote for such a mean spirited guy?</p>
<p>Or are there some facts about his family life that would not play too well to his &#8220;constituency&#8221; if they came out?</p>
<p>He seems determined to reject his african family - how come the liberal media is giving him a pass on this unchristian behaviour?  </p>

<p>Unfortunately Barack Ombama Sr. was able to score at least one other idiot Leftist White American woman Ruth - met at Harvard (Lord I despise that place) brought her back to Kenya while he was still supposedly married to Barack&rsquo;s White Mother Ann and his first Black African wife - he had children with White idiot race mixer Ruth - she eventually couldn&rsquo;t take his booze induced violent rages where he beat her. </p>
<p>All these facts are in the UK Daily Mail newspaper report and in our music video:</p>

			<p>This is not unusual. Most blacks adopt a &#8220;Screw you, I got mine&#8221; attitude whenever they become wealthy. This is shown by how quickly they leave the hood and move to a white neighborhood. Someone should do a study and see how many endowments, trusts or charities are set up and run exclusively by blacks. I bet it would make an interesting project. </p>

			<p>How can any voter expect Obama to take good care of his country, when he lets his own flesh and blood live in squalor, while his own children go to elite private schools? What a poor excuse for a human being, not even to mention President of the United States.</p>
<p>Somebody needs to go over there and flip that poor man a C-note and do a video interview inside the shack he lives in, then plaster it on the evening news. Imagine the panic in the damage control department over at Obama&rsquo;s election headquarters!</p>

			<p>Not to defend the good senator Obama, but it is just possible his brother George prefers the way he lives, absurd as it seems to us. After all he IS an African, and they think different from us. (Also considering the Obama family history, he might be the smartest one of the bunch, wanting nothing to do with any of them!)</p>

			<p>Many of BHO&rsquo;s supporters and family members in Kenya want to him to win, just to receive those foreign aid (int&rsquo;l welfare)checks from America. This socialist demon will not rest until Whites have given every penny they earn to 3rd world bums like lottery winnings. McCain may have many faults, but BHO is Fidel Castro in blackface. His wife Michelle Mugabe is even worse.<br>

			<p>I can&rsquo;t help but wonder what would happen to Obama&rsquo;s chances were pictures of his extended &#8220;family&#8221; shown daily in all US news media.  He seems to have only half-brothers and sisters, with with none of his siblings being of the same parentage.</p>

			<p>If you really want to know who Obama is, you need to read about his mother Stanley Ann Durham. Thats right Stanley.<br>
Her father expressed his disapointment in her from birth by <br>
naming her after the son he didnt have. With that chip on her shoulder she became a radical feminist, rejected white culture, married a Kenyan and later a Indonesian. Never returned to the USA. Wrote anthropological papers on the superiority of the Third World. Rejected Christianity as oppressive.</p>
<p>And all because of being called Stanley. Where is Johnny Cash when you need him?</p>

			<p>Even if the mass media were to plaster pictures of Obama and his much extended family every day from now until election day, it wouldn&rsquo;t change the media&rsquo;s sickening obsession with Obama or the little lemmings that worship at his feet.  This guy is the communist media&rsquo;s dream come true.  They&rsquo;ve been fueling racial divide in this country for years, they got us at each other&rsquo;s throats.  Should he and his wife decide to change the color of the &#8220;White&#8221; House, after they move in, the media would be all for it.</p>

			<p>To 9:57 PM August 20:What really bothers me is how Baracks sperm doner father helped to create Barack, who I think is a decent man, and then after 2 years decided to split.He wanted to do his own thing, getting more eddjamucation. After several years he then returned to Barack for a few monthes, as I saw on a broadcast last night.After that, he disappered again, never to return to Barack.This behavior is far more common in black males than it is in males of any other race.But his mother should have used better judgement before she committed herself to Baracks father.He didnt commit himself to her or Barack.</p>

			<p>There is some talk in this thread about Billy Carter.  Billy Carter supported the Citizens Councils of America (CCA), sometimes referred to incorrectly as the &#8220;white Citizens Councils,&#8221; the organization the Council of Conservative Citizens (CofCC) succeeded.  He told a bunch of George Wallace supporters in 1976 that he was really for Wallace, but had to vote for his brother just because.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t half the drunk or lush the media made him out to be.  He was also wise to a lot of establishment shenanigans, and named the extremist hate groups Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) and Trilateral Commission (TC) by name.  And was none too happy that his brother was cavorting with them.</p>
<p>If he were still alive, he might be a frequent AmRen.com reader.  Maybe not much of a profound commenter, though.</p>

			<p>Only a black candidate could have a crazy family background like this. Mother named Stanley (?), half-siblings scattered all over the place, etc. Imagine a White presidential candidate with unknown half-siblings scattered across Europe living in extreme poverty? Hard to imagine. Obama&rsquo;s mother was a real strange type. Steve Sailer has writen several interesting articles about both Obama and his mother. </p>

			<p>When I was studying anthropology and sociology at a community college in California, my teachers were from Kenya.  Both had PhD&rsquo;s and were very knowledgeable.  My anthro teacher I had for two semesters, and he had worked with Richard Leakey.  My sociology teacher was a wonderful man, with a great sense of humor and teaching skills.  His classes were always filled to the max.</p>
<p>Both of these individuals came from a life similar to the half brother of Obama.  My anthro teacher brought slides of his life in Kenya, and my sociology teacher stated he had two moms!!! They worked hard to get to their degree of expertise and make a name for themselves in education.  They embraced their humble beginnings, but didn&rsquo;t make anyone feel like they needed to pity them.</p>
<p>While I firmly believe there are racial differences in the intelligence and social intelligence, these two were definately on the high side of the Bell Curve.  However, they also helped their families in Kenya, and had a sense of pride.</p>
<p>I think most of Black America wants one of their own so badly,they are willing to chose anyone to obtain that office.  While I don&rsquo;t care for Obama, I would have voted for Colin Powell if he ran.  I vote for the person, not the party or race.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, McCain has my vote.</p>
