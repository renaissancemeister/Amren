<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>In 2005, the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that up to 3 percent of the 30,000 individuals called for jury duty from voter registration rolls over a two-year period in just one U.S. district court were not U.S. citizens. While that may not seem like many, just 3 percent of registered voters would have been more than enough to provide the winning presidential vote margin in Florida in 2000. Indeed, the Census Bureau estimates that there are over a million illegal aliens in Florida, and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has prosecuted more non-citizen voting cases in Florida than in any other state.</p>
<p>Florida is not unique. Thousands of non-citizens are registered to vote in some states, and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide. These numbers are significant: Local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes, and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non-citizens illegally registered to vote.</p>
<p>Yet there is no reliable method to determine the number of non-citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored, are inadequate, or are systematically undermined by government officials. Those who ignore the implications of non-citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting.</p>
<p>Americans may disagree on many areas of immigration policy, but not on the basic principle that only citizens &mdash; and not non-citizens, whether legally present or not &mdash; should be able to vote in elections. Unless and until immigrants become citizens, they must respect the laws that bar non-citizen voting. To keep non-citizens from diluting citizens&rsquo; votes, immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date, and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non-citizen voting that are already on the books.</p>
<p>An Enduring Problem</p>
<p>Costas Bakouris, head of the Greek chapter of Transparency International, says in an interview that ending corruption is easy: enforce the law. Illegal voting by immigrants in America is nothing new. Almost as long as there have been elections, there have been Tammany Halls trying to game the ballot box. Well into the 20th century, the political machines asserted their ascendancy on Election Day, stealing elections in the boroughs of New York and the wards of Chicago. Quite regularly, Irish immigrants were lined up and counted in canvasses long before the term &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; ever applied to them &mdash; and today it is little different.</p>
<p>Yet in the debates over what to do about the 8 million to 12 million illegal aliens estimated to be in the United States, there has been virtually no discussion of how to ensure that they (and millions of legal aliens) do not register and vote in elections.</p>
<p>Citizenship is and should be a basic requirement for voting. Citizenship is a legal requirement to vote in federal and state elections, except for a small number of local elections in a few jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Some Americans argue that alien voting is a non-existent problem or dismiss reported cases of non-citizen voting as unimportant because, they claim, there are no cases in which non-citizens &ldquo;intentionally&rdquo; registered to vote or voted &ldquo;while knowing that they were ineligible.&rdquo; Even if this latter claim were true &mdash; which it is not &mdash; every vote cast by a non-citizen, whether an illegal alien or a resident alien legally in the country, dilutes or cancels the vote of a citizen and thus disenfranchises him or her. To dismiss such stolen votes because the non-citizens supposedly did not know they were acting illegally when they cast a vote debases one of the most important rights of citizens.</p>
<p>The evidence is indisputable that aliens, both legal and illegal, are registering and voting in federal, state, and local elections. Following a mayor&rsquo;s race in Compton, California, for example, aliens testified under oath in court that they voted in the election. In that case, a candidate who was elected to the city council was permanently disqualified from holding public office in California for soliciting non-citizens to register and vote. The fact that non-citizens registered and voted in the election would never have been discovered except for the fact that it was a very close election and the incumbent mayor, who lost by less than 300 votes, contested it.</p>
<p>Similarly, a 1996 congressional race in California may have been stolen by non-citizen voting. Republican incumbent Bob Dornan was defending himself against a spirited challenger, Democrat Loretta Sanchez. Sanchez won the election by just 979 votes, and Dornan contested the election in the U.S. House of Representatives. His challenge was dismissed after an investigation by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform turned up only 624 invalid votes by non-citizens who were present in the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) database because they had applied for citizenship, as well as another 124 improper absentee ballots. The investigation, however, could not detect illegal aliens, who were not in the INS records.</p>
<p>The Oversight Committee pointed out the elephant in the room: &ldquo;If there is a significant number of &lsquo;documented aliens,&rsquo; aliens in INS records, on the Orange County voter registration rolls, how many illegal or undocumented aliens may be registered to vote in Orange County?&rdquo; There is a strong possibility that, with only about 200 votes determining the winner, enough undetected aliens registered and voted to change the outcome of the election. This is particularly true since the California Secretary of State complained that the INS refused his request to check the entire Orange County voter registration file, and no complete check of all of the individuals who voted in the congressional race was ever made.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Quick Ticket&rdquo;</p>
<p>Non-citizen voting is likely growing at the same rate as the alien population in the United States; but because of deficiencies in state law and the failure of federal agencies to comply with federal law, there are almost no procedures in place that allow election officials to detect, deter, and prevent non-citizens from registering and voting. Instead, officials are largely dependent on an &ldquo;honor system&rdquo; that expects aliens to follow the law. There are numerous cases showing the failure of this honor system.</p>
<p>The frequent claim that illegal aliens do not register in order &ldquo;to stay below the radar&rdquo; misses the fact that many aliens apparently believe that the potential benefit of registering far outweighs the chances of being caught and prosecuted. Many district attorneys will not prosecute what they see as a &ldquo;victimless and non-violent&rdquo; crime that is not a priority.</p>
<p>On the benefit side of the equation, a voter registration card is an easily obtainable document &mdash; they are routinely issued without any checking of identification &mdash; that an illegal alien can use for many different purposes, including obtaining a driver&rsquo;s license, qualifying for a job, and even voting. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, for example, requires employers to verify that all newly hired employees present documentation verifying their identity and legal authorization to work in the United States. In essence, this means that new employees have to present evidence that they are either U.S. citizens or legal aliens with a work permit. The federal I-9 form that employers must complete for all new employees provides a list of documentation that can be used to establish identity &mdash; including a voter registration card.</p>
<p>How aliens view the importance of this benefit was illustrated by the work of a federal grand jury in 1984 that found large numbers of aliens registered to vote in Chicago. As the grand jury reported, many aliens &ldquo;register to vote so that they can obtain documents identifying them as U.S. citizens&rdquo; and have &ldquo;used their voters&rsquo; cards to obtain a myriad of benefits, from social security to jobs with the Defense Department.&rdquo; The U.S. Attorney at the time estimated that there were at least 80,000 illegal aliens registered to vote in Chicago, and dozens were indicted and convicted for registering and voting.</p>

			<p>When the government(elected leaders)does little to nothing about illegal aliens voting, then we really aren&rsquo;t living in any kind of representative government, are we. At least not one that represents the citizenry. Again, politicians will do nothing, nothing at all, unless citizens turn the screws on them big time.</p>

Doing something about it would simply be bigotry. Unless of course, the majority of immigrants where white. Then I&rsquo;m sure doing something about it would make good sense. </p>

			<p>Which is, of course, why we are very close to insisting that those who vote supply ID.</p>
<p>It needs to be asked.  If every alien who voted illegally were yanked from the polls, would the democrats have any chance of winning elections at all?</p>
<p>This is no small thing.  Marginalizing the democrats by blocking this criminal behavior could, in fact, force them to reform.  There is only one pool of votes they can tap if they wish to win office ever again&hellip;..and it ain&rsquo;t blacks and criminal alien fugitives.</p>
<p>If the democratic party were to return to its white nationalist roots, it would go a long way toward reforming american politics.  Both parties would have to compete for the white vote.</p>

			<p>If illegals can become Border Patrol Agents, which they have, then the number of them voting must be significant.And you can bet that they are voting for all of the open border candidates that they can.</p>

			<p>Someone did an analysis of the 2000 Presidential Election, and concluded that at least 3 million illegal aliens voted then.  It&rsquo;s probably going to be higher by now.  After all, many illegal aliens live in political jurisdictions sympathetic to them, so who&rsquo;s going to tell them no when they register to vote?</p>

			<p>I can&rsquo;t believe the arrogance and audacity of these trespassers to feel they have rights in my country they broke into without any permission. There are so many problems associated with illegal aliens it isn&rsquo;t even funny. Why can&rsquo;t they make their own pathetic countries better instead of making ours worse?Thank you liberals in our country for allowing these idiots to be here in the first place.</p>

			<p>I voted in the primaries only because I wanted to cast a vote for Ron Paul, not that I thought he stood a chance. That was the only vote I cast, I left the rest of the ballot blank. </p>
<p>I basically quit voting about 10 years ago when I went to the polling place and saw all these signs in Spanish. I knew right then and there what was going on. And, no, I don&rsquo;t plan to vote in November. </p>

			<p>The enemy within acts like HIV of this nation. It practically disabled the national immune system (the immigration and border enforcement, etc.) that was supposed to fight infections (invasions, that is) and to guard jelously the privileges of citizenship.</p>
<p>Now, we are going to die of trivial infection (Mexican invasion, that is) because our national immune system has been paralyzed. Unless we cure ourselves of AIDS (figuretively speaking).<br>

			<p>You can be sure very few Democrats really want to prevent illegal aliens from voting.  That&rsquo;s just about the only way they can get elected.</p>

			<p>The new Indiana law requiring picture ID goes a long way in that state to stop illegals from voting.  Why else would the DNC and the ACLU oppose it?  Every state should enact similar laws.</p>

			<p>This article is really retarded. I have no doubt whatsoever that illegals *register to vote*, probably by giving the application to someone who can speak English to fill it out. They do this to get into the system so they can get their fake ID&rsquo;s so they can work. But I doubt if many of them vote. I live in a community that is completely overrun by illegals and their anchor baby horror children. These people are not involved in their communities in any whatsoever. I would laugh if I heard of any significant number of them voting in an election. They&rsquo;ve probably heard that voter fraud is a felony and they&rsquo;d like to avoid that. We are talking about a community that takes no interest whatsoever in politics, that can&rsquo;t read, write or in general even speak English, and who lives on the margins. The idea that they would vote, or could even read a ballot, is comical.</p>
<p>Legal Hispanic aliens are another story. Most of them don&rsquo;t speak English really well either, don&rsquo;t read much English and are estranged from US society. I guess a few of them might vote, but I doubt it. They do speak English better than the illegals, but they have a lot of problems with it.</p>
<p>These illegals avoid anything having to do with government in any way. After a traffic accident or if they get victimized by crime, they refuse to go to the cops. You will never see one near the government building. They are voting? GMAB.</p>

			<p>Let me be the first to remind those that are choosing not to vote this November.  Regarding the selection of president, there is really no good choice.  Feel free to throw a &#8221;protest vote&#8221; towards a third party candidate.  This is precisely what I am doing, if for no other reason than to make a statement that I do not accept the neocon takeover of the Republican party.  They MUST show me that they care about White concerns if they ever want my trust, and therefore my vote, again.  That said, there will be many congressional seats at stake as well come November, and THIS is where we must focus our attention.  THIS is our only hope at stemming the tide.  Regardless who sits on the White House throne, they will get zero of their liberal bills passed as long as we flood Congress with politicians that share our beliefs and have a spine.  Completely sitting this one out is not to our benefit, in my opinion.</p>

			<p>Voter fraud, whether by illegal aliens, graveyard residents (as in Philadelphia particularly), or simply registered voters who vote repeatedly is a direct assault on the integrity of the republic.  As this piece correctly notes, it&rsquo;s the ultimate form of disenfranchisement, since every fraudulent vote cancels the vote of a legitimate citizen.</p>
<p>The punishment for this offense should be the same as for espionage in wartime.</p>

			<p>  I don&rsquo;t think any blue state will go red(republican) anymore. But red states might turn blue(democrat) because of illegal aliens voting. The Republican party is finished. That&rsquo;s why the corrupt media is for open borders. More brown voters = democratic victories!</p>

			<p>If any laws are to be changed, these laws will have to be introduced by elected officials, and they are not about to upset the applecart they rode in on. Therefore nothing is going to change for the better.</p>

			<p>I live in South Florida and sometimes come across illegals. I know they are illegals. What can I do? Is there a place I can call? Border states and Florida should have their citizens informed as to who to call or what to do when you spot illegals. People just accept this as a way of life down here. I&rsquo;m sure CA is the same. <br>
Generally most feel sorry for illegals. They don&rsquo;t realize the strain created on the taxpayer and all the laws that are being violated and can potentially be violated by their illegal presence. I feel sorry for some, but not for those who could care less about our country, becoming a law abiding citizen or the price that was paid by brave patriots to obtain these freedoms. They&rsquo;re here for the free ride (no taxes) and good medical attention.</p>

			<p>in the debates over what to do about the 8 million to 12 million illegal aliens estimated to be in the United States,</p>
<p>A more realistic estimate for the total number of illegals in the US is 30 million, not 8-12 million.</p>
<p>Why do you think that the Democrats have fought so long to cheapen the franchise by extending it to just about anything that walks?  Why have the Democrats supported every illegal amnesty that was ever conceived?  Why did Hillary propose that the electoral college be replaced by direct voting for president?  What party was behind the change from state legislators to popular election of senators?</p>
<p>Is there a pattern here?  One need only ask the ancient legal question of &#8220;Cui bono&#8221;,i.e. &#8220;who benefits&#8221;.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Let me be the first to remind those that are choosing not to vote this November. Regarding the selection of president, there is really no good choice. Feel free to throw a &rdquo;protest vote&rdquo; towards a third party candidate.&#8221; Cop</p>
<p>  I&rsquo;m with you on this one. Unless McCain comes out against shamnasty, I really can&rsquo;t see supporting him. If I was for Obama, I doubt I&rsquo;d be reading and contributing to the AR website. </p>

			<p>I have known of two Philipinoes, one a neighbor and one a member of my Church, who were registered even though they told the registrar that they were not yet citizens.  One was actually told by the registrar that he could be deported if he didn&rsquo;t register!</p>
<p>The Democrat party here in Chicago sends these registrars out to ethnic social clubs to register as many as they can, the law be damned.</p>

			<p>Well you have to say the Republicans designed their own destruction.  Rove believed the Mexinvaders would vote GOP, so he and McCain went along with the invasion.  Bush appointed Mel Martinez, a pro-open-borders Hispanic as the head of the RNC to poke a stick in the eyes of the conservative white base of the party. </p>
<p>Now you can stick a fork in the GOP as a major force in national politics for at least a generation. </p>
<p>People who care about a working, traditional, constitutional Republic to live in need to start thinking of new strategies.  Capturing the FedGov from the looters is no longer possible. </p>
<p>Seperation or secesion may be a more realistic option.  Perhaps some widespread resistence movement?   Like the Selma bus boycott for the rest of us? </p>

			<p>This has to stop. elections are for american citizens to elect their representative.  All materials must be in english and there must be photo IDs.<br>
   If Mexico can require photo IDs, we can also.</p>

			<p>It makes me sick to think that this is happening. I guess it explains why the last time I voted,there were signs in spanish under the english ones. We need a national I.D. card, and states have to stop handing out drivers licenses to any one </p>

			<p>Its really very understandable. The first sign that the people have lost their country is when the government refuses to follow the laws of the land.We see this everyday. We lost our country over eighty years ago to traitors and internationalist.The looting of our country is almost complete.Some of us will live to see,and our children will surely see the unthinkable to what will become of a once great nation. We all have to take some of the blame even though i feel as Henry Ford once said lets atleast make it a fair playing field with no stacked deck!</p>

			<p>If Obama wins the presidency, every unemployed Black can THANK Obama   &mdash;   who will open our borders to millions more Mexican immigrants   &mdash;   eager to take jobs out from under the noses of Afro-Americans. But then again, maybe the Afro-Americans really DON&rsquo;T WANT JOBS   &mdash;   they might prefer life-long welfare to working. So either way, they can find reasons to thank OBAMA as their supreme benefactor.</p>
<p>Of course once another 30-40 MILLION AFRICANS arrive, domestic Blacks might feel a bit resentful towards Obama for giving those new African &#8216;immigrants&rsquo; a free ride as soon as they set foot here. </p>

			<p>Zane: Well you have to say the Republicans designed their own destruction</p>
<p>Although I entirely agree with you, it might be more accurate to say that the Republicans, a party which emerged prior to the 2nd War of American Independence on the dual platform of raising tariffs paid almost entirely by the cotton states and spending the money on &#8220;internal improvements&#8221; in the North, designed our own destruction by allowing themselves to be co-opted by the neocons, leaving us with no one to represent our interests.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s an easy victory for the Illegals and the Power Elite.</p>
<p>They are united, not with themselves, but AGAINST US.</p>
<p>And we aren&rsquo;t united at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an easy victory.</p>
<p>We aren&rsquo;t united because, for the most part, we&rsquo;ve lost our will to live.</p>
<p>and the Power Elite KNOWS this.  But many of us don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Again, easy victory.</p>
<p>If we are to do anything we have to be organized.  <br>
That means there has to be a principle we can organize around.<br>
And don&rsquo;t say White Nationalism. There&rsquo;s no time to waste.</p>
<p>We have two serious problems.</p>
<p>1- We&rsquo;re not unified or organized.<br>
2- We still can not accurately describe our enemy. It&rsquo;s illegal.</p>
