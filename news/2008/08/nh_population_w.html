						<p>It may be difficult to believe today, but by the middle of the 21st century, Hispanics and other minority groups will become the majority in the Granite State, according to U.S. Census Bureau projections.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Even though the state&rsquo;s population today is overwhelmingly made up of non-Hispanic whites, who outnumber other racial and ethnic groups by ratios ranging from 40-to-1 to 300-to-1, New Hampshire will mirror the national trend, and the demographic changes will happen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, New Hampshire is very white today,&#8221; Alamgir said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Alamgir said the existing white population in New Hampshire is growing older. Based on the median age, which is now in the early 40s, planners can estimate these people have either already had children or are not going to have children, she said.</p>
<p>Alamgir said Southern New Hampshire, where more first- and second-generation immigrants are settling and raising families, will reflect the demographic changes more than other parts of the state.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to state population charts, the white population in Rockingham County grew by more than 53 percent between 1980 and 2005, climbing by more than 100,000 people.</p>
<p>The black population increased by more than 100 percent over the same time period, but blacks were still grossly outnumbered by whites &mdash; 3,038 to 297,902.</p>
<p>Asian and Pacific Islanders also increased their presence in Rockingham County &mdash; growing from 772 to 5,168. Hispanics, who are not a race and are therefore already counted in with the white and other groups, are broken out separately for comparison, she said. Over the 25-year period, the Rockingham County Hispanic population increased from 1,226 to 5,377.<br>

<p>And &#8216;overwhelming&rsquo; appears yet again.</p>
<p>These articles just prove that these census figures are just part of a psychological warfare campaign designed to make whites &#8216;just give up.&rsquo; Write your congressman and senators, cite the census figures, and demand third world immigration, both illegal and legal, be restricted and tell them it is unacceptable that your children and grandchildren will be consigned to minority status in the country that your parents and grandparents built.</p>

<p>Hispanic fertility drives U.S. population growth<br>
https://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/latestnews/stories/081908dnnatbirthrate.39dcfdf.html</p>
<p><br>
Readers&rsquo; comments seem to reflect popular sentiment towards this trend.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t help quoting here this lying liar (or an idiot), Ted K.  Here is what he said in the U.S. Congress in 1965 on the occasion of passing Immigration and Nationality Act:</p>
<p>&#8220;What the bill will not do: First, our cities will not be flooded with a million immigrants annually. Under the proposed bill, the present level of immigration remains substantially the same. [&hellip;] Secondly, the ethnic mix of this country will not be upset. [&hellip;] Contrary to the charges in some quarters, S. 500 will not inundate America with immigrants from any one country or area [&hellip;].&#8221;</p>
<p>I hope he will get well soon and live long enough to answer before the American court for his deception that literally ruined America.</p>

			<p>Sad, but not at all surprising.  The self-hating White elites who are working so feverishly to destroy White civilization in the United States (as well as in Canada, Britain and Australia), are also seeking to destroy the few places in North America that could still function as refuges for our people.  </p>
<p>The only White countries that will survive, are the ones that have immigration policies specifically favorite White ethnic diaspora overseas (which is why so many White families I&rsquo;ve known have been learning a bit of German and emigrating to places like Germany, Switzerland and Denmark, for example).  Without this bulwark, a country&rsquo;s federal government will destroy it from within, even places like New Hampshire that aren&rsquo;t particularly interested in changing themselves demographically.  The USA as a whole will be majority non-White by 2025-2030.</p>

			<p>Unfortunately, this is the only way that some whites in the small towns in predominantly white states will ever &#8216;get it&rsquo;.  I have a relative who lives in a town in Kentucky that has about a 13% black population, and she raves about her town&rsquo;s &#8216;diversity&rsquo;.  I tell her, &#8216;Sweetheart, I live in Georgia.  Diversity is when they are the 87% and YOU are the 13.  Then you&rsquo;ll know diversity.&rsquo;</p>

Mestizos have Mexico, Central America and most of South America</p>
<p>Blacks have most of Africa, most of the Caribbean, and increasing amounts of North and South America</p>
<p>Asians have Asia</p>
<p>Europeans have rapidly shrinking pieces of North America and their historic homeland and, judging by the reactions that I&rsquo;ve read in response to the most recent U.S. demographic projections, they&rsquo;re just fine with it!</p>
<p>Whites have been at the top of the heap for too long.  Even the most liberal whites know that their race is inherently successful and, somehow, they resent themselves for it.  We need a true global crisis to wake whites up to their own impending demise. </p>

<p>They usually are more like hard boiled eggs: white only on the outside.</p>
<p>Genetically, the fact that someone has white or off-white skin doesn&rsquo;t make him white (Caucasuan, that is).</p>
<p>Out of all actually white people I know, no one belongs to this self-hater category (not to be confused with those suffering from the implanted sense of guilt). I would encourage everyone on this forum to do their own research. Just don&rsquo;t be deceived by the appearances.<br>

			<p>Question:  Is there any place on Earth that will still have a majority white population by mid century?  Most of Africa will still be black.  Most of Asia will still be Asian.  Most of South America will still be mestizo.  What is it about leftists that makes them consider the extinction of the white race a good thing and yet they&rsquo;ll sacrifice their lives to save an obscure species of snail?  The answer is hate.  They have an overriding hatred in their hearts against all things white.  If they could, they would make angel food cake illegal and paint the White House black.  Oh, they don&rsquo;t usually hate individual whites - just the White Race.</p>

			<p>     Folks, we have to be careful when we read these projections from the government.  I believe that the government wants very much to engender among Whites a spirit of defeat and demise.  For example, recently there were news reports that non-Whites would become the majority in the United States even sooner than earlier projected.  Now, think back and remember how you felt when you heard/read that.  Didn&rsquo;t you feel like throwing up your hands and giving up?  I think that is EXACTLY what the government and the corporations WANT us to think.  They want us to give up.  The government lies, so, why shouldn&rsquo;t they lie about the &#8220;inevitability&#8221; of White disappearance.  Very few things are inevitable.</p>

			<p>What this article omits is the factor of white flight to New Hampshire from other areas of the country where the quality of life is going down because of too much &#8220;diversity&#8221;.  The assumption is that only minorities will emigrate to New Hampshire which is counter-intuitive considering the demographic changes in the United States.  New Hampshire and Maine, for example, have the distinct possibility of becoming white enclaves in a diverse, hostile, 21st Century America.</p>
<p>So all you AmRen readers it might be prudent to buy your second, or retirement home in a white enclave state instead of Florida or Arizona which are already doomed.</p>

			<p>Does anyone actually believe that the United States will survive as we know it past mid-century?  We all know what happened to the Soviet Union.  Ethnic Russians became a minority and it dissolved almost overnight.  At this point I would say that the  breaking apart of the US is close to certain.  There are going to be some interesting times both here and in Europe in the coming decades. </p>

<p>I absolutely agree. If people think it is hopeless, they won&rsquo;t bother. A lot can happen in fifty years. Just look at the 50 years between say 1905-1955? A huge depression, 2 world wars and massive changes. The truth is that the only thing predicatable about life is that it is totally unpredictable.  </p>

			<p>Reading the comments about Hispanic fertility, is it any wonder than a race who listened to the abort merchants and &#8220;Pill&#8221; pushers, now finds themselves at a reproductive impasse? Or that Russia&rsquo;s effort at encouraging White Russians to &#8216;have babies&rsquo; is er,&hellip;. good for the &#8216;fatherland&rsquo;?</p>
<p>Is it also indicative that, during war, the murder of all men of the opposing army, as well as any pregnant females, was a sure way to &#8216;win&rsquo; a war. Perhaps White Anglos will remember the lessons of teh Greek city-states, their wars against the Persian invaders, and the &#8216;Molon Labe&rsquo; of former years&hellip;. or even the wars of Christendom, where a race fought both for its&rsquo; religion, as well as her populace.</p>

<p>Boomers did not create and pass the 1965 Immigration and Naturalization Act.  The fact is that the Boomers were manipulated by forces far more sinister than they.  It was our naivity and idealism that made us tools for their plans. That includes Feminism, which was a political force in the 19th century.  They just kept the young women stirred up continuously, increasing divorce and single parent (female) child rearing.  It just goes on from there&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. and continues in large scale today.  It is the GenXers that are largely the &#8220;Hitler Youth&#8221; of Muliticulturalism today.</p>

			<p>Marxism has taken over all western nations. The plot is to make the white man a minority in Europe, America, Canada, and Australia, thereby robbing him of a homeland. He has been spoon-fed white guilt, white privilege, and pro diveristy propaganda for so many years now, he has lost the nerve to even speak up for himself, or his people. </p>
<p>Whites are the oppressors, non-whites the oppressed, Whites are the majority, non-whites the minority. Whites are in positions of power, non-whites are the powerless. But what&rsquo;s this? A black man groomed for presidency, whites on the verge of minority status. No power, no numerical advantage, and one day soon no country. And worst yet, no voice. He sat back and let it happen. So long New Hampshire, so long America, so long White man. You were such a polite and considerate sucker.<br>

			<p>&#8220;It only took the Boomers less than 50 years to literally give it all away to strangers they don&rsquo;t even know.</p>
<p>Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>The smart ass answer is, of course, Who cares? </p>
<p>In reality the answer is that the Liberal/Socialist mindset is that we are all pawns in the great chess game of the world. It does not matter the surface features of the pawns, only that they can be fooled into voting for socialist policies that will cement their power, up until voting is no longer necessary. White Americans resist more than most, so if one population of voters resist, well hell, replace them! Hence the &#8220;outreach efforts&#8221;, resistance to immigration reform, voting for felons, etc. And it works, blacks vote for their policies 90% of the time, good little blacks that they are. Did you realize that only 2 Democrats have EVER been voted in on the majority of the peoples vote? LBJ on a sympathy vote (Kennedy had been shot the year before) and Carter, on the outrage of Ford pardoning Nixon (Clinton was voted in because of a split Republican ticket, but never reached 50%). Whites in the U.S. are just too resistant, so the Liberals instituted a long term effort to replace them. </p>
<p>The future is grim. If history shows anything, it&rsquo;s that Whites will give up their countries to blacks and &#8220;others&#8221; with little protest. While we watch movies where whites fight for their countries tooth and nail (300, Lord of the Rings, WWII movies, etc) the truth is that it is OK in the U.S. for a Black kid to walk down the street with a Malcolm X hat, but not for a White Kid to do the same with a hat sporting the Confederate Flag.</p>
<p>It will get worse before it gets better, if it gets better.</p>

<p> This estimates of the non-white population in the future are so off it&rsquo;s almost not worth looking at.  It predicts Georgia will still be a majority white state in 2040 (51%).</p>
<p>  In reality we&rsquo;ll go majority non-white before 2020, maybe 2018 or before.  We&rsquo;re losing ground so fast here it&rsquo;s nauseating. So take no solace in this sites prognostications.</p>

			<p>Nothing like a few carjackings, and gang bangings on the quiet maple lined streets of New Hampshire to teach the liberals up there the reality of multiculturalism.</p>

<p>Nixon carried NH in 1960, but Kerry prevailed in 2004. From what I&rsquo;ve read, the state has been invaded over the last ~20 years by liberals fleeing Taxachusetts, Vermont &amp; Maine. Those liberals then vote for the same high taxes &amp; social programs they moved to NH to escape. Further proof that liberalism is a mental disorder.</p>

			<p>&#8220;So all you AmRen readers it might be prudent to buy your second, or retirement home in a white enclave state instead of Florida or Arizona which are already doomed.&#8221;</p>

<p>I am a resident of Florida; (Kissimmmee) Osceola County, Florida, to be precise. My area is turning all Hispanic, very quickly, especially as the Puerto Ricans are moving in, and most of our White &#8216;girls&rsquo; are dating and marrying Browns (and even Blacks), &#8216;left and right.&rsquo; However, not all is lost, right?</p>
<p>Theoretically, Florida is split. The Southern half is already a pre-Country for the Hispanics. Sarasota, St. Petersburg, and the Palm Beach areas will be deathtraps will Whites. The Pinellas Peninsula will just have to be cut off from the top, and will become a virtual or de facto island. The Palm Beach and Sarasota areas will be easy to cut off, isolate, and suffocate. The Western (from Tallahassee, westward) Floridian Panhandle will probably be destroyed by Black Seccessionists. </p>
<p>The rest of Florida belongs to the Whites. But even our new state homeland is being invaded. My Osceola is the first spot. Orange and Seminole Counties are also lost. Now we just have the coasts starting at Clearwater and Brevard County, and central from Lake and Marion Counties). We will also have multiple fronts, if we even get a Civil War 2. The Black militias to the North and West, and Hispanic seccessionists to the South. We would also be well isolated from White America. </p>
<p>If a Civil War were to occur, I would predict Whites will put up a fight in North(east) Florida until a third or half way-point. then, we would probably have a sort of naval prescene, which would stealthly sneak Whites into South Carolina. The brave would stay therein, and the more fearful will move to Tennesse and Western North Carolina. After wising up, White militias will probably leave North Florida, for the Blacks and Hispanics to fight over. </p>
<p>I suggest Floridian Whites move to South Carolina, before this predicament is even necessary. SC is very important for our cause, and is open for saving. As long as migrants are kept out, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Western NC, are already locked in. Next, we need White migrants from lost states to move to Northeast and Central South Carolina and the state of Maryland.</p>
<p>Even in the short term, Arizona is a lost cause. We need to encourage Whites to leave the Southwest (and Florida) and maybe some (but not necessarily all) of the Gulf South, such as Louisiana, Mississippi, South Arkansas, South Alabama, and South Georgia.</p>
<p>As this study evidences, we will lose even &#8220;safe&#8221; states such as New Hampshire and Maine, if we don&rsquo;t plan properly. </p>

<p>Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. Liberals vote for their destructive socialist/social engineering programs, and when everything falls apart, they go &#8220;Huh?&#8221;, move somewhere else and mess that place up as well.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget their usage of &#8220;grossly outnumbered by whites&#8221;.</p>

			<p>I have owned houses in both NH and Florida for some time - NH was the state in which I was raised, and Florida is the state in which I&rsquo;ve been generally living and working for two decades now.  Contrary to what many have done historically, I will not be retiring to Florida, but rather to NH.  You need only spend a handful of days here to see why.  </p>
<p>There are increasing numbers of news items about an emigration out of Florida that is unprecedented.  You are going to read a lot of sanitized reasons for that movement and direction of same; hurricanes, high property taxes, etc.  Don&rsquo;t believe it.  Decent people are leaving because the indecent are taking over.</p>
<p>The &#8220;progressive&#8221; types in NH who think a substantial rise in non-white population will be great because they&rsquo;ll be living among the Huxtables are in for a rude awakening.  Florida is soon lost, but states like NH still have a chance if whites are willing to fight for it&hellip;principally by opting against another BMW and in favor of having another child.  </p>
