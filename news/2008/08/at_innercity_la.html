<h1><a href="https://apnews.myway.com/article/20080819/D92L7MB00.html">At Inner-City LA High, Nearly 6 in 10 Drop Out</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Christina Hoag, AP, August 19, 2007</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Amid the verdant lawn and leafy trees of the tidy Jefferson Senior High School campus, a police officer patrols the grounds and a sign warns that guns are illegal.</p>
<p>Students in this inner-city school say gang members frequently disrupt class, and teachers spend much of their time dealing with troublemakers.</p>
<p>The biggest problem here, however, may be what you don&rsquo;t see &mdash; all the dropouts.</p>
<p>With a 58 percent dropout rate, Jefferson has the worst dropout record in the Los Angeles Unified School District, the nation&rsquo;s second-largest.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While half the students typically quit inner-city schools nationwide, Jefferson is at the lower end of the spectrum of so-called &#8220;dropout factories&#8221; because of a concentration of factors that are rarely all present at schools in other cities.</p>
<p>Located in South Los Angeles, where new immigrants mostly from Mexico and Central America settle, the area has a large minority population and high poverty.</p>
<p>Of its 1,977 students last school year, 45 percent qualified as English learners. More than 90 percent qualified for free or reduced-price lunches.</p>
<p>The newcomer population means families shift quickly, following jobs or fleeing immigration raids. The school has a 57 percent transience rate, compared to a 38 percent average across district high schools.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A shift in demographics has spurred racial divisions that peaked three years ago when blacks and Latinos clashed in several bloody melees.</p>
<p>A quarter-century ago, Latino students totaled 31 percent of the student body; now they account for almost 90 percent. Blacks comprise about 10 percent and a sliver are Asian or white.</p>

			<p>As bad as that is, perhaps it&rsquo;s all for the better, for the students that don&rsquo;t drop out.  IIRC, Jared Taylor referenced this school in &#8220;Paved With Good Intentions.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Jefferson High School in Los Angeles occassionaly gets even national attention for the many brawls and fights that occur during school hours there even with armed security everywhere.</p>
<p>Was a nice whitebread school in the 1920&rsquo;s. Now it&rsquo;s a just a dark haven for South American army ants on their way northwards toward finishing their invasion of the USA. </p>

			<p>Let them drop out! Don&rsquo;t try to stop them, raise standards and stop worrying about these potential trouble makers except to finger print and DNA swab them if you can. Protect and encourge the real students and start deporting whoever you can. It&rsquo;s about time we protect our own and stop being sucker-hearted.</p>

			<p>90% immigrants; a 58% drop-out rate&hellip; and what is the CRIME RATE, perperated by Latinos, one might well ask.</p>
<p>Why do we have a military? Or even a national guard, if they can&rsquo;t be used to secure the border, then drive the damned illegal parasites and criminals out of OUR AMERICA?</p>

			<p>Just 6 in 10 drop out?  Heh, compared to the other dismal schools in California, that&rsquo;s probably a blue-ribbon graduation rate.  </p>
<p>California and Arizona are ruined lands, already a part of the Third World.  Throughout my old stomping grounds in these states, well over half the White families have left for good  &mdash;   some have even been among those emigrating to European countries (like Germany and Denmark) that limit their immigration to ethnic Diaspora, and so are staying largely White.  </p>
<p>Hard to see how California could get only worse.  But then again, the whole country will be majority non-White by 2025 or 2030, and in elementary schools, most kids are already non-White.  So, I guess we&rsquo;ll see soon enough.</p>

			<p>Of the 60 % that drop out, what % of them are illegal or anchor babies? Probably most. Hispanics are like some lifeform that was introduced to control another destructive lifeform, namely blacks, but it eventually gets out of control, and becomes an even bigger problem, but the difference here is that hispanics came here on their own.</p>

			<p>&#8220;the area has a large minority population and high poverty.&#8221;</p>
<p>When my grandparents came to this country, being poor was a good reason to NOT drop out of school. Being here illegally was a good reason to go back where they came from.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read several articles in the recent past which puts the drop out rate at about 50 or 60 per cent for Hispanics, so I&rsquo;m wondering why this article is citing this school in particular as having a 58% rate.  I&rsquo;m pretty sure that&rsquo;s about average or close to it.</p>
<p>I did read one article that said school districts fudged the figures in drop out cases to make them look smaller than what they actually were.</p>
<p>But considering this story came from the Associated Press, which is far left, I&rsquo;m not surprised at anything they put out that&rsquo;s incorrect or exaggerated.</p>

			<p>Let them drop out. Keeping any of these &#8220;youfs&#8221; in school against their will a day past the age of 12 is counter-productive to the students who really want to learn something and the teachers who are trying to teach them! It&rsquo;s not like they are going to learn anything anyway. They were born knowing how to prey on whites and be gangbangers which they will do and be for a few misery-causing years before they are locked up in prison or killed off by others of their own ilk.</p>

			<p>Of course, this statistic has to be weighed up with the of-quoted fact that the majority of new births in the USA today are non-White.<br>
Couple this with the fact that every Chinese family that can possibly afford it packs off their precious child to college - where more than likely he/she will emerge with a degree in engineering or a hard science.<br>
These are facts, that must be consudered most carefully and dispassionately. </p>

			<p>And thats bad? <br>
This saves the taxpayers. When 100% drop out then they can close the schools. <br>
This is not a bad thing just like gangs kill each other. It saves taxpayers and the cops. <br>
Hell let all these criminals drop out and kill each other. This is a win win.</p>

			<p>Another manifestation of the No Illegal Immigrant Left Behind Act.  Los Angeles public schools are a Hispanic and black disaster area.  Libertarians are as clueless as the Left.  Even if these schools were privatized, the same problems would happen.  It&rsquo;s the race, stupid. </p>

This was exactly my reaction to this item. The shocked-n-appalled tone of the article is puzzling, as a 58% dropout rate is merely the norm for these people and this area. Consequently, it&rsquo;s nothing but a &#8220;dog bites man&#8221; story; a non-event; a yawner. </p>
<p>If a school in Occupied Mexifornia managed to get its failure rate down to below, say, 40%, now THAT would be news. <br>

			<p>What these troubled youths need is practical vocational training for their future. Along these lines all classes should<br>
be cancelled and a model Crack House should be set up on the playground. Mathematics could be taught via crack transactions.<br>
For example: If LeBron sells quarter ounces for $100 less than<br>
Antwone, and Tuneisha sells herself for $50 less than that, who should Tyrone cap first for disrespecting him?</p>

			<p>Odysseus is exactly right. Let them fall. My kids will still do well and I wager the children of those on this board will do very well. The overwhelming failure of the black and browns will make our kids that much more valuable to potential employers.<br>
 Dont think for a minute that these statistics are being overlooked by Americas employers. When a white kid or asian kid or an Indian kid comes into an interview they wont come out without an offer. WE know what to do fellow AMREN&rsquo;ers. WE know what to teach our kids. WE will continue to outperform blacks and browns in EVERY measurable parameter.</p>
<p>   This news is good news. The money they will pour into these schools will be wasted. The best thing we can do is make DAMN SURE our kids toe the educational line. WE will be fine</p>

But sadly,if this were introduced as a way to teach math to &#8220;inner-city yufs&#8221;, many White liberals would go for it.</p>

<p>There is high poverty because 58% drop out of school. In this way, South Los Angeles maintains its growing status as part of New Azatlan while also maintaining the simple cultural traditions of Mexico and Central America. See? A Mestizo win-win.
