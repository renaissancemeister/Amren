<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>When I made the hard decision to forgo buying a house in Dallas [and move to] Plano].{snip} I started getting comments from readers at one of my other publications about &#8220;diversity,&#8221; whatever that means. Apparently, in choosing a house in one of the top school districts in the country, in a suburb where the poverty rate is low and the median income is high, I was guilty of the high crime of white flight.</p>
<p>My humbled, guilty reaction consisted of two words: &#8220;So what?&#8221;</p>
<p>I mean, what the heck does diversity mean? Some of my new neighbors in Plano include people from Thailand, Armenia, India, Afghanistan, Hong Kong, Colombia and the Ukraine, but apparently that doesn&rsquo;t count. And when a school is 85 percent white, it&rsquo;s not diverse, but when it&rsquo;s 85 percent Hispanic, it is?</p>
<p>I was scolded that my daughter, by being in a Plano school, would be sheltered from &mdash; nay, ill-equipped for &mdash; life in the real world.</p>
<p>Well, yeah. Probably. The real world is a lot bigger than Dallas, bigger than (Sam Houston, forgive me) Texas, and bigger than the United States. The majority of the real world is dirty, violent, poor and absent indoor plumbing and two-ply toilet paper. More than half the world&rsquo;s people live on something like $1 a day.</p>
<p>{snip} I want a school that will prepare her for living in a professional, high-paying world so Daddy won&rsquo;t have to pound out columns in his dotage.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Seriously, if the only exposure to other people your kid gets is when she&rsquo;s sitting in a place where you move about like cattle at the sound of a bell and have to ask permission to go to the bathroom (i.e. school), what kind of sheltered life are you giving your kid?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird. We&rsquo;ve made &#8220;diversity&#8221; into some kind of totem, an end to itself, and we haven&rsquo;t even defined what it is. Do I learn more about a different perspective chatting with my Ukrainian neighbor (whom the census counts as white), or from a guy brought up five miles from me who happens to be black?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not entirely sold that diversity is automatically good.</p>
<p>Look, diversity is great when it comes to nightclubs, workplaces, cultural experiences, restaurants and all that. But I don&rsquo;t want diversity in my neighborhood.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I want uniformly boring neighbors with uniformly boring, middle-class values who spend Saturdays working on their lawns and whose kids know to stay off mine. I want neighbors with Home Depot on speed dial. That&rsquo;s how I choose to live. Your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>And isn&rsquo;t that diversity, too?<br>

			<p>Apparently diversity is good only when it has an adverse effect on whites. Whites need to be punished dontcha know? <br>
The only thing &#8220;positive&#8221; about diversity that I have learned is that I need to lock my mountain bike with a sturdy lock &amp; install an expensive home and car security system. <br>

			<p>For some &#8216;odd&rsquo; reason, diversity never includes whites. You&rsquo;ll never see a black college seeking &#8216;diversity&rsquo;.  You&rsquo;ll never see diversity training at school and corporations that include white culture yet, when immigrants move to the US, they make it OUR responsibility to learn their culture.  Just why should I be required to say Spanish last names with a Spanish accent?  I don&rsquo;t see them saying &#8216;Johnson&rsquo; with a British accent or &#8216;McDonald&rsquo; with an Irish one.  Just why should I be expected to know the wonderous ways of the muslim yet say Christmas at work and you&rsquo;ll be pulled aside and told to say &#8216;holidays&rsquo; (this happened to me in &#8216;tolerant&rsquo; San Francisco). Way too many whites are silent.  Everyone seems to be afraid of the &#8216;r&rsquo; word.</p>

			<p>Very brave, and very perceptive column.  And the gentleman is right: the religious dogma (I&rsquo;d go further than calling it a &#8220;totem&#8221;) of diversity is satisfied only where whites are forced to live, work, learn and raise children among ethnic and racial groups with high rates of sociopathy and antipathy to whites.  The fact that a white person or family lives among people from diverse cultures like the Ukraine or Armenia, or even &#8220;people of color&#8221; like high achievement Asians will not satisfy the diversicrats and racemongers.  If whites are living in communities without blacks or Mexicans, the diversity dogmatists are willing, nay, they insist on, importing the same even from halfway around the world to make white people &#8220;live with diversity.&#8221;  Such diversity inevitably leads to neighborhood degradation, dilapidation, deterioration and so-called &#8220;white flight,&#8221; which is nothing but a pejorative term for white people&rsquo;s freedom of movement and association.  Under these circumstances, I predict that with the increasing minority status of whites, their freedom of movement will become legally restricted, just as their freedom of association now is.</p>

			<p>I mean, what the heck does diversity mean? Some of my new neighbors in Plano include people from Thailand, Armenia, India, Afghanistan, Hong Kong, Colombia and the Ukraine, but apparently that doesn&rsquo;t count. And when a school is 85 percent white, it&rsquo;s not diverse, but when it&rsquo;s 85 percent Hispanic, it is?  </p>
<p>Exactly! The word diverse is just a psedudonym for non-white these days. When Italy makes an (ALL) black issue of Vogue, they call it a triumph in diversity. Generations back, when White Europeans arrived in America, they settled in neighborhoods, and enclaves, where they could be among their own, which is why there were German towns, and Italian neigborhoods, and Irish ones, and so on. This made it easier for first generation Americans to adapt. Today, all those former white European communities have been replaced by minorities. Harlem is now considered a historically Black community, even though it was named by the Dutch, who originally settled there. And when whites move in and gentrify parts of it, blacks cry foul, and say it has always belonged to them, and should remain that way. Because White communities have always tradionally been safer, and cleaner, they eventually always attracted non-whites. And whites have never been allowed to resist. There were always ways of getting around it, even if it mean&rsquo;t blockbusting, or having the Government set up section 8 housing. Ironically, even though most non-whites are happy to move in on white communities, most of them do not wish to live among other non-whites. Who hasn&rsquo;t heard the reports of Hispanic and Blacks having turf wars, in an attempt to dominate an area? And Asians are still setting up Koreatowns and Chinatowns, while there are now Lebanese or Arab communities springing up. But when whites attempt the same today, they are called racist. Which is why only the most wealthy and elite neighborhoods these days, still have a white majority. But the wealthy elite are a minority as well, aren&rsquo;t they? They are often the first to say they are open to diversity, but it&rsquo;s easy to say that, when you are living in a gated communitiy.</p>

			<p>Trey Garrison must be sipping the same brew as Kevin Myers, both have reached the nirvana of racial enlightenment at nearly the same moment. I will anxiously await the fate of these men, as the PC machine seeks to purge them from the MSM. This will be a true test for America and Europe. We and they will have to answer the question, &#8220;is writing about group self defense permitted to whites?&#8221;</p>

<p>This is the &#8216;racial isolation&rsquo; argument that the left now uses. They&rsquo;ve totally reversed themselves. Before it was black kids needed to get into white schools because they couldn&rsquo;t learn in black schools. Now it&rsquo;s white schools need black kids because whites will be bewildered out there in a world full of affirmative action hires and bogus media portrayals of blacks.</p>

			<p>The following comments are sarcastic!</p>
<p>Hmmm Well lets extend this concept of &#8220;diversity&#8221; as a post academic preparation for the &#8220;real world&#8221;!</p>
<p>In the real world are criminals. Should my child be exposed to criminals in grade school?</p>
<p>In the real world are prostitutes, drug addicts, mentally impaired, death, and destruction. Should I be expected to live in a war zone so that my child can experience the &#8220;real world&#8221;?</p>
<p>In the real world are classes of students that will never perform as well as others. Should the more gifted students, whether black or white, be expected to somehow benefit from being in classes where the average student is four to five years behind where they are? Just exactly how in the hell is my child going to benefit from taking five times as long to cover basic material.</p>
<p>The reality is that everyone is not the same. No matter how hard I train I will never run the mile under four minutes. I will never run the forty yard dash under 4.7 seconds. Never. I will never play pro football at 6&rsquo;3&#8221; tall and 210 pounds at 60 years of age. It ain&rsquo;t gonna happen. Do you think that the New England Patriots would benefit having me on their team? Hardly!</p>
<p>Only when it comes to race is it expected that white people are expected to automatically act stupid! No matter how much the politically correct, multicultural, racial homogeneity, diversity is our creed, liberal Ivy League egg headed professors want us to believe it is just not the way the world is. There are fundamental racial factors that simply can&rsquo;t be mandated away by governmental intervention. </p>
<p>Most people in the world understand that you can&rsquo;t turn a cat into a dog; BUT, tell whitey that it can be done, and tell him long enough, and tell him that he is to blame if it isn&rsquo;t done, then wahla whitey will start telling you that &#8220;yes it is possible to turn a cat into a dog&#8221;!               </p>

			<p>America was extremely diverse at least 120-years ago.</p>
<p>During that time period we have had Native Americans, blacks, Chinese, Japanese, hispanics, Jews, Germans, Dutch, English, Irish, Polish, Italian, Hungarian, Armenian, Syrian, Portegeuse, Swedes, Scots, and more. We also had a natural balance that allowed enough assimilation to take place so as to keep some form of co-existense.</p>
<p>The only difference now is that the spoiled child-like races and ethnicities of the world want to be greater in number and demand more benefits from their benefactors.</p>
<p>In nature there has to be a balance.  To brainwash modern society into believing that majority numbers of third-world people are good for all of society is beyond fantastic.  </p>
<p>It is nothing less than propaganda.</p>

			<p>I wish I could remember where I read it, but somebody once defined freedom as the right to be left alone. That about sums it up for me. I&rsquo;m tired of various &#8220;experts,&#8221; who never have to live with the consequences of what they preach, telling me how <i>I</i> must live <i>my</i> life to make <i>them</i> feel better. </p>

			<p>What&rsquo;s so frustrating is that most people are like Mr. Garrison here, yet no matter how strenuous their efforts, the federal government still insists on inundating their communities with the Third World.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether it&rsquo;s Democrats, or pseudo-conservative Republicans like Jorge Bush or John McCain who are in power  &mdash;   the result is the same.  Especially in Southwestern states, Florida and Texas, where Mr. Garrison lives, if you live in a mostly-White neighborhood, look out  &mdash;   you&rsquo;re in the crosshairs, and your neighborhood&rsquo;s lack of &#8220;diversity&#8221; will be remedied by importing an entire village from Somalia, India or the Philippines, and dumping them and all the attendant crime and gangs right on your doorstep.  Any of us from Arizona or California can attest to this, and it looks like Texas, New Mexico and Florida are headed in the same direction.</p>
<p>The simple truth is, so long as the USA continues to bring in over 1 million *legal* immigrants every year  &mdash;   those are the quota numbers, not even counting illegal immigration  &mdash;   our mess will only get much worse, very fast.  Even without further immigration, Whites in the USA will become a minority by 2025.  With continued legal immigration, we&rsquo;ll hit minority status by 2015-2020, barely a decade away.  In US schools, Whites are already a minority.  This portends nothing less than the utter collapse of the USA as a Western nation.  Unless this impending disaster is addressed, and legal (not just illegal) immigration halted, with mass deportation  &mdash;   the country is finished.</p>

			<p>When is somebody in the MSM going to have the guts to write an article asking why it is only white nations that should appreciate diversity, because the other nations of the world certainly don&rsquo;t, especially our neighbor to the south, Mexico?</p>
<p>Who is going to be the first mainstream type to tell the truth and write or say that diversity is weakness and that all societies are made weaker with diversity?</p>
<p>And who is going to come right out and say that every indication is pointing toward a civil war in this country, breaking along lines of race and ethnicity?</p>
<p>Pat Buchanan, Jared Taylor and a few others on the right have either alluded to all the above or came right out and warned of it it, but the so called MSM have been quiet even though they couldn&rsquo;t truthfully disagree with a word of this post.</p>
<p>To know and be silent is to be complicit in the crime.</p>

			<p>This is a recent letter to the editor of the Raleigh News &amp; Observer from a woman (name seems white)so entralled with diversity that she would invoke a sort of converse of the legal theories underlying the Supreme Court&rsquo;s Kelo decision in order to prevent a private landowner from redeveloping his property. Look for more of this under Obama Nation.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;You&rsquo;ll never see a black college seeking &lsquo;diversity&rsquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, that&rsquo;s wrong, they all seek diversity, even going so far as to offer all expense paid scholarships to Eastern Europeans (white Americans generally have no interest.)  There are a few HSBC&rsquo;s that are less than 50% black now, and the average enrollment at black graduate schools is 20% white.  </p>
<p>The Valedictorian at Morehouse college this year was even a white guy.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I mean, what the heck does diversity mean? Some of my new neighbors in Plano include people from Thailand, Armenia, India, Afghanistan, Hong Kong, Colombia and the Ukraine, but apparently that doesn&rsquo;t count. And when a school is 85 percent white, it&rsquo;s not diverse, but when it&rsquo;s 85 percent Hispanic, it is?&#8221;</p>
<p>Although I agree with what this writer is saying, the inclusion of the above paragraph just indicates this is another brainwashing propaganda piece.  The MSM has accepted the fact that most Americans, even liberals, don&rsquo;t want to live around blacks and Mexicans.  What they&rsquo;re doing here, it seems to me, is rewrite the definition of diversity to mean muslims, asians and non-Mexican mestizos. It&rsquo;s ok if you don&rsquo;t want to live around Shaqil or Heffey but you better have neighbors like Quong Chung-Ho or Khamel Khan.  Same thing with the 85% White school remark.  It conditions you to believe that you have to accept a certain amount of diversity.  Although this article sounds like it&rsquo;s delivering what you want to hear, it&rsquo;s just more window dressing on the same old multicult diversity agenda.</p>

			<p>Why can&rsquo;t he just admit he doesn&rsquo;t like being around black folks?  People who feel that way should be able to say so, like admitting you don&rsquo;t like broccoli. And we could all just shrug if off, instead of acting like it was some kind of heresy. </p>
<p>Honesty, white people have been acting nuts on the topic of race for as long as I can remember.  </p>

<i>In US schools, Whites are already a minority.</i></p>
<p>And in the 40 and under population, Whites are now a minority.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Between the rising minority population   &mdash;   particularly of Latinos of any race   &mdash;   and the low median age of Latinos, a new kind of generation gap is arising across the country, experts said: <b>Most people over 60 are non-Hispanic whites, and most under 40 are not.&rdquo;</b> </p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.<br>
Well, something like that.  Apparently, the answer is &#8220;yes&#8221;.</p>
<p>Diversity (let&rsquo;s  face it) is just a euphemism which simply  bolls down to white removal and white replacement.  </p>
<p>Of course, no one will ever mention that. You&rsquo;re not supposed to know. Not so early in the game.</p>
<p>Diversity is just like the other euphemisms we&rsquo;ve been fed over so many years now, sort of  a palliative to anesthetize us to  the stiletto when it finally gets shoved in.  Years ago (the 60&rsquo;s) we got bi-lingualism,  harmless enough sounding, which we thought meant two languages, English remaining primary of course.  But no, that was just the first step.  Somewhere along the way, it  imperceptably morphed into multi-lingualism. Which in turn gradually morphed further  into entrely foreign-language neighborhoods and shopping malls with no English spoken anywhere for miles. And then multi-lingualism  became transformed, ever so subtly, into multi-culturalism. And then, all of a sudden,  without even knowing it, we had &hellip; Diversity!  We were told this is  &#8220;the American way&#8221;.  It has always been so. It is in the Constitution (somewhere or other); it was intended by the Founding Fathers; and anybody who questions it is not a patriotic American!  Our diversity  gives us strength.  Diversity is what America is all about.  Everyone who watches TV knows that.</p>
<p>Well, who&rsquo;s going to argue with the Constitution?  And if Jefferson, Washington, Lincoln, and Franklin all said it (somewhere, we&rsquo;re told), it must be so. I&rsquo;m not going to take on Thomas Jefferson!</p>
<p>And then, as it had been with language, so it will be with race   &mdash;  -  just a few at a first, then just a few more, and finally an irresistible flood of humanity that overwhelms us like a tsumani. </p>
<p>Diversity will at last have been achieved when American whites are reduced to an irrelevant minority in the country that their people built.  But by that time it won&rsquo;t be a country anymore either because it will have been torn apart by all the warring alien tribes (who couldn&rsquo;t even get along with their neighbors or each other back home) who will have replaced us as they squabble over  the carcass of whatever is left.</p>
<p>America   &mdash;  -  it was nice while it lasted.  Some of us can remember.</p>

Ha!<br>
I&rsquo;m fro &#8220;as far south as it gets,&#8221; Miami. My family dates back to south Florida as far back as the late 1800s. <br>
My parents left Miami for Central Florida (thank God) about 1970. They were successful entrepreneurs who saw that their days in Miami were numbered, because they weren&rsquo;t Cuban. So I grew up in the white paradise of Central Florida when there were but a few million people in the state. Of course there were some towns nearby with significant black populations, replete with school riots, and other such diverse enrichment. <br>
But my town was almost 100% white, and beautiful, safe, tranquil, just heaven. <br>
No more&hellip;it is being changed every day for the worst. I knew somethig was desperately wrong when I noticed South American Mestizos hanging around the laundromat. The town is being squeezed by dvelopment on all sides, and a daily influx of foreigners (gasp, such a racist idea)!<br>
My point is, where are you going to go? You SHOULD leave Mexifornia, of course! Get out now. But don&rsquo;t expect any remaining white paradise to last. If there&rsquo;s a chicken farm, a meat processing plant, a social services office, or a bus service, you&rsquo;ll soon have hordes of third worlders hanging about.<br>
And if there isn&rsquo;t a chicken farm, some agribusiness giant will put one there. <br>
The south is a myth. It&rsquo;s really just a bunch of isolated white enclaves, dwindling, crushed from without, and decaying from liberal ideology within.<br>

			<p>Kudos to the poster at 10:48pm.  You&rsquo;re the only one who broke the politically correct code Trey Garrison is using. Note how Garrison is careful to make sure you don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s a bigot (i.e., racially conscious): he&rsquo;s wants you to know he has non-white neighbors from all over the Third World, and he&rsquo;s (presumably) happy with that.  Note also how he praises diversity in nightclubs and the workplace.  Why is diversity there, where whites get hasssled, stalked, attacked / raped and even murdered by non-whites every day, so great, but not so great in the neighborhood?  Finally, he clearly lets us know (lest we, again, think he is - God forbid! - a segregationist or something) that the diversity he opposes is the diversity of values, not diversity in skin colors. </p>
<p>Dollars to doughnuts this guy is OK with mass Indian, Chinese, Pakistani immigration, as long as they&rsquo;re &#8220;hi-tech,&#8221; &#8220;educated,&#8221; and &#8220;polite.&#8221;  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give him one good paragraph, the one where he cleverly debunks the idiotic concept of &#8220;exposing your child to the real world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Besides that, trust me.  This guy isn&rsquo;t on our side.  Beneath a little camouflage paint, his colors are PC.</p>

<p>Perhaps the storm of controversy and general revulsion aroused by Jeremiah Wright and all of the attendant black agitators coming even more to the forefront (Ludacris, et. al.) as the Obama campaign chugs along is making these mainstream editors and producers more bold and gradually accomodating to troubled conservative whites?  </p>

			<p>I live in a Houston, Texas &#8216;burb.&rsquo; Yes, our area, including our subdivision, is burgeoning with DIVERSITY. Let me relate briefly what diversity means&hellip;</p>
<p>It means hearing about lots of drive-by shootings, gangs of youths stabbing other youths. About lots and lots of violent crimes in the newscasts and daily paper. The kind of stuff you DON&rsquo;T get in a homogeneous WHITE community or city. Granted, rape in a White city or town HAS happened&hellip; even Whites can stoop that low&hellip; but an occurrence SO RARE it would be newsworthy for rarity&rsquo;s sake alone.</p>
<p>It means stores suffer a greater percentage of &#8220;stock shrinkage.&#8221; Euphimistically called &#8220;five finger discounts&#8221; when I was a teenager growing up. If you&rsquo;re careful and discrete, you can actuall witness Hispanics at the local Wal-Mart, helping themselves to five-finger discounts (we have). Security guards? Guess their presence must be bad for business given that I&rsquo;ve seen MORE SHOPLIFTING than security guards in our local discount emporiums.</p>
<p>It means you learn fast to NEVER leave your kid&rsquo;s bike leaning againt the front of the house after dark&hellip; or even during the day. That is, if you prefer it not to be stolen. Unattended lawn mover? One neighbor stopped mowing his front yard; went in the house for a phone call lasting a bit too long. His phone call ended up costing him the price of a replacement mower.</p>
<p>No, you learn fast, DIVERSITY (Hispanics and/or Blacks) is but a code-word for C-R-I-M-E! For dumbed down public school systems where the curriculum has to be paced back to the speed of the slowest brown learner. Or having the class clown practicing African drum music on his desktop. White children literally AFRAID to use the restroom during school hours.</p>
<p>It even means coming home from work, hoping for a peaceful evening&hellip; which ends when Jose or Vittorio arrive, their ancient pickups or vans blasting trash music as loud as the music system can play. Then our &#8216;culturally diverse&rsquo; neighbors leave the radios blasting, as they go into their (rented) homes, but not before tossing empty beer cans thoughtfully into White neighbors&rsquo; yards and flower beds.</p>
<p>It also means that house next door, meant for single-family occupancy, is bursting at the seams   &mdash;   with four to six adults and eight to ten kids. Creating commensurate noise, traffic, trash being flung around, not to mention screaming brown kids considering YOUR yards, YOUR flower beds their rightful playground&hellip; to be vandalized at will. Of course, should you mention it to Jose, Vittorio or Manuelo, you&rsquo;re told you&rsquo;re just an anti-Mexican racist.</p>
<p>Amazing how those people espousing diversity and multi-culturalism NEVER have to live with those &#8220;diverse&#8221;, multi-cultural types. But then in gated communities with private 24-hour guards, the Hispanic types you see are the gardners and house help&hellip; who are required to be long gone by sunset.</p>

<p>Let the liberals live in all of the &#8220;diverse, vibrant&#8221; neighborhoods.  I&rsquo;ll take a boring neighborhood   &mdash;   or country, for that matter   &mdash;   where the residents all think and act as I and my family do.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Now, put down the pitchfork. I don&rsquo;t mean the superficial diversity of skin color. I mean diversity of values. That&rsquo;s what I don&rsquo;t want in my neighborhood, or my neighborhood school.&#8221;</p>
<p>He still manages to get politically correct and that&rsquo;s where he loses me.  I still don&rsquo;t want to live around different races even if they share my values.  It&rsquo;s not that I hate other races.  I want future generations of my family to have caucasian colors and features.  White is beautiful to me!  I also want to pass on treasured American/European traditions but once you mix races you lose all of that.    <br>

			<p>My high school in Cleveland was the most diverse school in the nation at the time in the 60&rsquo;s.It was 85% white and 14% black and 1% other races.The black children I went to school with my father went to school with their parents.It was always integrated.But the powers to be decided it wasn&rsquo;t diverse enough.The school is now 99.9% black and recently forced busing was done away with because the governmemt achieved it goal of integration.All the whites moved and the most integrated school in the nation was detroyed by the politicians.This is how they detroyed it through forced busing.There was a solid Italian neighborhood behind the high school.Mike White the mayor at the time wanted to destroy this section.What he did was to shut down the elementary school in the middle of the Italian  neighborhood so the the young chidren would be bused 45 mins a day to a all black inner city school.So the young white families moved from the Italian area to the suburbs.When young families stopped feeding the neighborhood the elderly were left behind.When the older people died the children had no connection to the neighborhood so they dumped the house and sold to blacks.Make no mistake our government was the major player in destroying the school and the white neighborhood.</p>

			<p>My sister and I each own a house in a tiny white area on the south side of Chicago that is surrounded by all blacks. Her children are approaching school age so she and her husband made the decision to move to Woodstock, IL.  When she gets the usually criticism about white flight from our liberal friends, she informs them that Woodstock is actually more diverse because the area is 85% white and our area is 95% black.  She explains the pie chart and how real diversity can be shown by how many different ethnic groups are represented.  She receives mostly blank stares from the liberals who don&rsquo;t understand statistics but she does a good job at shutting them up.  By the way, most of her liberal friends live in very white areas themselves.  </p>

			<p>How much exposure to diversity do white people need?  The idealism of the call to diversity is best thought of as many cultures learning from each other.  However, all of this contact and presumed learning must take place inside the framework of Western culture.  Is the true diversity of participating in a public stoning, selling people into slavery or mass child rapes going to be celebrated?</p>
<p>Face it: diversity is a meaningless term in much the same way as any other word appropriated for leftist social engineering is defined as whatever it&rsquo;s most fanatical supporters want it to mean.  About the most flattering meaning of diversity I have come up with is the belief that non-whites who refuse to assimilate into society and persist as minorities have grand insights into their repudiated host culture.  Need it be said, horrifically laughable and totally devoid of logic.</p>

I wonder if it&rsquo;s a coincidence that one of the main purveyors of diversity is the media, which benefits greatly from the &#8220;copy&#8221; diversity generates.  Another purveyor is the government, which becomes bigger and more powerful as the chaos and disintegration increase.  Another is academia, which receives attention, prestige and money to solve the &#8220;troubling problems&#8221; that accompany diversity.</p>
<p>But I think we can get sidetracked analyzing diversity&rsquo;s nuances and absurdities and fail to notice diversity&rsquo;s ultimate goal - the annihilation of white people and influence.</p>

Articles like this should be in all newspapers. Newspaper are going out of business because they will not show both sides of the story. What&rsquo;s wrong with one side talking about the benefits of diversity, and then another talking about the downside. Illigal immigrants pro and con. People will buy newspapers is they are a public forum not a propaganda piece.</p>

			<p>I know exactly how you feel &#8220;fed up at 7:50 AM.&#8221;I lived in Houston from &#8216;78 to &#8216;04 and finally moved out of that hellhole to the great White midwest. Four yrs. later I&rsquo;m still in awe when I go places and it&rsquo;s all White people. I never thought I&rsquo;d see a White Wallmart,but they are here. In Houston,going to Wallmart was awful. Black/mexican thugs hanging out in the parking lot blasting 15 different rap songs and staring you down. Would YOU feel comfortable leaving your car out there? Up here I have acually left my car unlocked, windows down at Walmart and never worried about it. They all do that up here. Inside Houstons Walmart &#8220;ghetto&#8221; music is on the store sound system and HORDES of black/brown kids being loud and running everywhere unsupervised, while 5-6 different languages are being spoken around you. I finally got &#8220;fed up&#8221; and got out of there and don&rsquo;t regret it one bit. My high blood pressure is history and I sleep good at night [with my windows open of course].</p>

			<p>The pursuit of happiness and the pursuit of diversity are diametrically opposed. Why? Because it is impossible to be happy without a sense of connection to those around you. And you can&rsquo;t connect to those you can&rsquo;t read. There is no way to read those who speak differently, gesture differently, think differently than you do. In fact what you feel is constant friction, distress, unhappiness in their presence. In other words, diversity is the perfect formula for continual unhappiness, sometimes low-level sometimes rising to the level of murderous rage. <br>
Thank you, elites, for having loosed the misery of diversity on America. </p>

			<p>What is curious about this is the mass psychology involved.</p>
<p>In the past, such a question as &#8216;Why didn&rsquo;t you move to a diverse neighborhood?&rsquo; would have been puzzling or laughable. Now people take such things seriously.</p>
<p>To solve our plight, we need to find out why people change and begin to take seriously notion which in the past would have seemed unintelligible.</p>

			<p>According to the media we all get along and everything is just fine.  I was getting a haircut the other day and while I was waiting I read the Lexington newspaper that was in a chair next to me.  One section about an interracial couple losing their house and a picture of them in their new apartment with their black children on the bed.  Another story about a black guy losing his house because of the subprime mortgage mess also showing a picture of his White friend helping him move.  The majority of the stories featured Whites and blacks together helping and supporting each other.  No wonder I haven&rsquo;t subscribed to a paper in years.  </p>

			<p>I can&rsquo;t even believe this guy defends his neighborhood as being diverse.  Who cares?  I don&rsquo;t.  I really could care the hell less anymore if someone tells me that I am not exposing myself to enough &#8220;diversity&#8221;, or that I am engaging in &#8220;white flight&#8221;.  Instead of defending yourself, do what I do and tell everyone that you don&rsquo;t care.  I moved from a &#8220;diverse&#8221; neighborhood to a white neighborhood.  When people asked, I told them the truth:  this is a better place to live than the old place.  If they ask if that&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s a white neighborhood, then I always answer YES.   </p>

			<p>The Man and H Doumpty, </p>
<p>I can assure that Cleveland was a great town, even after the nation&rsquo;s first black big city mayor made Cleveland the laughing stock of the nation.  There were solid blocks of all white neighborhoods on the East Side and the except for a  Puerto Rican minor problem, the West Side was filled with one peaceful neighborhood after another.  </p>
<p>When I moved to the Puritas area from near East Side in 1972 it was for all practical purposes totally white.  Only the blacks were the descendants of the railroad gandydancers who were confined to a section off Bellaire Rd.  Real Estate agents could steer whites to white neighborhoods and blacks to theirs.  The Junior High down the street from my house had an all white football team that practice on its grass field.  </p>
<p>I had problems with rowdy kids.  Some friends of my son put a paper bag filled with dog poop in my drive way and set it afire.  I heard them behind the neighbor&rsquo;s bushes trying to muffle their laughter as I pretended to stamp it out.  When I told the ring leader&rsquo;s father what he had done, I&rsquo;m sure he got a good strong lecture on not embarrassing his father.      </p>
<p>Those who despise the white race and curse Christianity went to court and worked through politics to bring disorder to our peaceful lives.  We all moved out at great cost and sacrifice.  Now nowhere in that neighborhood is it safe as blacks have taken over and roam freely.<br>
 <br>
Sometimes I think that the white haters and Christian cursers bring disorder by making a  flaming bag of disorder filled with minorities and drop in the mist of peace loving Christians.  That is why I think we have to go after the head of the snake.  We have to stop stomping on the bags and go after the guys who drop the flaming bags on us. <br>

			<p>&#8220;Actually, that&rsquo;s wrong, they all seek diversity, even going so far as to offer all expense paid scholarships to Eastern Europeans (white Americans generally have no interest.) There are a few HSBC&rsquo;s that are less than 50% black now, and the average enrollment at black graduate schools is 20% white.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a racist canard. The only thing true about it is that black universities do celebrate diversity. Black schools, colleges, employers, neighborhoods, and cities, all preach diversity as fervently do their white counterparts. Diversity is respected and celebrated by them as much, if not more so, than it is by whites. And by respect for diversity, they also mean the promotion and elevation of non-whites, the dehumanisation of whites at every possible opportunity, and the enlightened celebration of both, and of course, themselves. </p>

<p>Very interesting post; I&rsquo;d like to be sure of this &ldquo;detail&rdquo;. (And was the mayor black?)</p>
<p>Mike White is very black, but to make up for it he has a white trophy wife.</p>
<p>The Italian community in Cleveland is (or was when I lived there) very tight, and blacks were not welcome anywhere near their neighborhoods. That alone is enough reason to destroy their community.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t want diversity because of VOODOO.I have a cousin who has been an upper-level office manager at The U.S.Dept of Health in Washington &hellip; the U.S. Govenment brought in a BLACK PROFESSIONAL from HAITI&hellip;.Well he did/nt like her and put A CURSE on her. He put a dead monkey on her desk.<br>
Posted by Billiam Mortain.</p>
<p>I hear you!  A colleague of mine was a supervisor in charge of an office with many black employees. She had on her desk some of those silly little dolls with funny faces that stationery stores sell, joke items.  Well, a new employee (black, West Indian) claimed that the supervisor had the dolls all staring at her and that they  had put a hex on her. She filed a formal complaint!  My colleague was shocked.   Incidentally, she was &#8220;black&#8221; too (well, very light though). </p>
<p>I had experiences with blacks putting things on your desk too.  On one occasion, I came in to find a bit pile of excrement on the top of my desk.  (I shall presume it was canine.)  I instinctively knew who did it, but couldn&rsquo;t prove it. He was an incessant troublemaker and management was afraid of him.  Upper management (white and spineless) was terrified of the whole matter. They didn&rsquo;t even want to know. They didn&rsquo;t pursue it. Nothing was done. </p>
<p>There were various incidents, all of that same type.  When he finally left, they stopped.</p>

It&rsquo;s only normal.  The fact that it takes massive propaganda campaigns, simultaneously applied in  all Western countries, coupled with laws and governmental pressures, to coax or  force people to integrate (ie. ultimately miscegenate) is only PROOF that this is <i> not  <i>a natural thing.   If it were truly natural and desirable, then everyone would do it, without having to be  coerced, tricked, threatened or brainwashed into doing it.</i></i></p>
<p>There would be no need for laws, campaigns, and special organizations to force people into doing what came naturally.</p>

<p>I would have though so  too, at first. But after carefully re-reading his article and after reading many of the comments above, I see that he very timidly tiptoed around the issue, and actually PRAISED the idea of racial diversity, all the while pretending to criticize some other minor cultural aspects of it. Not much courage was shown here, and it definitely was not racial.  Of course, that was the only way to get it printed, I suppose.</p>

			<p>Diversity, if not in the beginning, then now, has become a strategy to disempower white people from any voice in the nation they created. It seems obvious to me, since we now have so many disagreements coming from the dozens of different cultures on some of the most simple matters of law, etc. whereas, before the massive non-European immigration, many of these problems never even arose.</p>

			<p>Quite honestly, I can find enough diversity in just being around white people.  Plenty can be learned from people of my own race that have had different life experiences and lived in different parts of the country.  When I find myself around blacks or browns their life experiences seem to be about whining about some perceived injustice or about partying or sex. </p>

			<p>Blacks demand diversity everywhere Whites are but want none of it in their own enclaves, associations, and organizations. There are thousands of Black professional, educational and business associations - do they welcome Whites or even Asians? Try to start any corresponding White associations and it becomes automatically a racist organization. </p>
<p>&#8220;Diversity&#8221; is forced only on Whites because they are the only group sucker enough to put up with and even encourage it. </p>

			<p>I have long found it curious that while the left claims to love diversity, they openly detest diversity in political opinions.  They hold that diversity in physical appearance is good, but anyone who can think for himself is strange and threatening.  They become VERY upset when one describes Political Correctness as a pseudo-religion, even though they are the first to insist that the basic, underlying assumptions in the ideology are not subject to debate, and thus can only be called dogma by any honest individual.</p>
<p>The notion that someone like Mr. Garrison should feel guilty for moving his family to a town where they will enjoy good schools and an absence of car-jackings, drive-by shootings, or gang-rapes isn&rsquo;t merely unthinking dogma; it&rsquo;s pathological insanity.  Trying to secure a peaceful, safe life for one&rsquo;s family is a large part of what being a husband and father are all about. </p>

			<p>&#8220;But notice that the article was very careful to boost (or at least not oppose) RACIAL diversity!:&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Dumpty, you&rsquo;re right about that of course. But Mike B. is right, because a few years ago we wouldn´t have seen the story at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an evolution towards outright white consciousness. From the first timid suggestion to learn english to the intermediate legal-good/illegal-bad and to the slightly more advanced like this column. </p>
<p>Mark Krikorian&rsquo;s new book falls in the intermediate/advanced column, because he still does not make the racial argument, but it is important because he has eliminated the legal/illegal split. His argument that the immigrants aren&rsquo;t different from 100 years ago but that it&rsquo;s the fault of our welfare society today is partly bogus. It&rsquo;s the combination, of course, of that plus non-white leeches, but he can&rsquo;t say that yet. Yet. </p>
<p>Sooner or later someone will make the racial argument in the MSM and others will pile on. I don&rsquo;t know, but the frog seems to be unboiling. </p>

			<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve made &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; into some kind of totem, an end to itself, and we haven&rsquo;t even defined what it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>The most important thing to understand about the word diversity is - it&rsquo;s a word.  </p>
<p>Words do not fall from the sky.  They come from Human beings.  And they don&rsquo;t just come from any one place.  Meaning, there is NO conincidence that the word Buddha did not come from the geographical area now known as Yorkshire England. Anymore than the word Mohammed came from Patagonia.</p>
<p>So too there is NO conincidence that the word &#8220;Diversity&#8221; first emerged in one form or another some 200 years ago from the geographical areas of Western Europe and North America. In terms of Cultural History it was a word used to lend support to the notion of the Soveriegn Individual, which, without a doubt, is the greatest creation (and that&rsquo;s the right word) of Western Civilization.  In fact, you might call it the West&rsquo;s crowning acheivement.  Long story short, there has always been a conflict in the West between the interests of the Individual and the interests of the Group (as can be seen in the conflict between the terms &#8220;Self-Reliance&#8221; and &#8220;Team Player&#8221;).  A conflict that does not exist anywhere else because no other place in the world recognizes Individuality - obviously. What the great Cultural Heroes of the West realized was that the conflict was a contradiction that could never be resolved, but was there to be dealt with and celebrated, not explained away or dismissed. But, some people LIKE living in a Black and White, Either/Or, World, where all of our answers are neat and tidy.<br>
So, in a nutshell, what happened was the Group mentality of Whites took the word Diversity and used it to kill, literally and figuratively, the people who created it.<br>
And to do that they used a word originally associated with Individuality and the Morality of Empathy, and converted it into a Political concept with NO moral code at all, and applied it exclusively to Race (&#8220;There are no morals in Politics, only expedience&#8221; Lenin).  And, since the ONLY racial group with a History of Individuality was and is Whites* they had to attack not just Individuals, but the entire White Race! (except themselves of course).  And they did so by using the Press.  Again Lenin, &#8220;The press should be not only a collective propagandist and a collective agitator, but also a collective organizer of the masses.&#8221;<br>
THIS is how THEY would define &#8220;Diversity&#8221; and organize the Masses around it, ie; in a way that  is absolutely antithetical to it&rsquo;s original intention. As Sun Tzu said, if you don&rsquo;t know your enemy OR yourself your enemy will crush you.  And the fact of the matter is not enough Whites had a clue so the Left saw their chance and took it.  Happily the Internet is having its effect. But there is no time to waste.<br>
*Of course there ARE individuals from other Racial groups; but so far they are so small in number as to practically prove the point.<br>

<p>I wanted to respond to that again. If you think in these schools that are 40%, 20%, 10%, 1%, or 0% white, if you think there is a concern for whites or the white students there, you are mistaken. In all matters, the less whites there are, the MORE they push this blanket, anti-white, pro people of color, agenda. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Now, put down the pitchfork. I don&rsquo;t mean the superficial diversity of skin color. I mean diversity of values. That&rsquo;s what I don&rsquo;t want in my neighborhood, or my neighborhood school.&#8221;</p>
<p>There it is folks.  The &#8220;I&rsquo;m really not a racist, really, I&rsquo;m not&#8221; statement so he can&rsquo;t be called a nativist or worse.  Most on this site know that a &#8220;superficial&#8221; diversity of skin colors brings with it the diversity of values that the author rightly abhors.  Are we to believe that different races within a given neighborhod, city or state will adhere to the same value system?  Not hardly and the evidence of that is all around us.  I guess one doesn&rsquo;t have to be European to be a co-national of Mr. Garrison, he/she just has to have Home Depot on speed dial.   </p>
<p>For Mr. Garrison to think that the answer to the intractable problems of diversity is for third world invaders to simply adopt our value system is wrong headed and an insult.  The various races are genetically predisposed towards certain value systems and behavior patterns.  Assimilation has it&rsquo;s limits and isn&rsquo;t possible on this large a scale and with this many disparate races.  </p>

			<p>The pursuit of happiness and the pursuit of diversity are diametrically opposed. Why? Because it is impossible to be happy without a sense of connection to those around you. And you can&rsquo;t connect to those you can&rsquo;t read. There is no way to read those who speak differently, gesture differently, think differently than you do. In fact what you feel is constant friction, distress, unhappiness in their presence. In other words, diversity is the perfect formula for continual unhappiness, sometimes low-level sometimes rising to the level of murderous rage.<br>
Thank you, elites, for having loosed the misery of diversity on America.</p>

<p>What you are talking about is what bothers me most about this thing they call diversity.</p>
<p>I always feel kind of down and depressed walking through my neighborhood. All I see is fat, unattractive Hispanics constantly cackling and laughing with their huge broods of children in tow, no jobs or responsibilities to worry them, horrible music blaring from every car and every window, people urinating in public, garbage everywhere&hellip;.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t that I fear them, and they certainly are an upbeat people, but I just feel no sense of community where I live.  I don&rsquo;t say hello to anybody who lives on my street, I don&rsquo;t know any of my neighbors&rsquo; names even though I have lived on my street for five years now. I simply have absolutely no affinity towards my neighborhood or its inhabitants whatsoever.</p>
<p>I simply feel anxious and isolated when I am in my neighborhood.<br>

			<p>As Bob Whittaker has so rightly said, &#8220;diversity&#8221; means fewer whites.  That is why an 85% white school is not diverse but an 85% Hispanic school is.  When your media masters tell you to &#8220;celebrate diversity&#8221; they are telling you to celebrate the extinction of your own race.<br>

Why on earth would a sane, rational White man or woman WANT either racial group living next door? Can anyone explain this concerted effort to destroy our White nation in the name of diversity?</p>

			<p>   I agree with a lot of the posters here. When my neighborhood started to get hispanics I started to feel angry all the time. This can&rsquo;t be good for my health.</p>

			<p>  I don&rsquo;t like diversity because I like white people too much. Any diluting of their numbers I  cant handle .  For example, I&rsquo;m a cashier, so I see a lot of children. When I see a white child, a warm feeling comes over my heart. I don&rsquo;t have that same feeling for a non white child. That&rsquo;s how I know I don&rsquo;t like diversity. My heart tells me who I like. Very simple deduction.</p>

			<p>&#8220;You&rsquo;d be better served avoiding the coastal areas- heavy black population and the larger cities. Try the mountainous areas of the South (GA, NC or SC. The more rural, the better.&#8221; Aunt Bea</p>
<p>  This is good sound advice Aunt Bea! I would go on epodunk <a href="http://www.epodunk.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.epodunk.com/</a> and check out the racial/ethnic composition of any town your thinking about moving to. Good luck. </p>

			<p>   Whites have to put up with blacks because we brought them here, much to our disgrace.  As for the hispanic invasion, I lay the blame at the feet of democrats. They more than anyone else put votes ahead of the good of the country. These democrats don&rsquo;t care what they&rsquo;ve done to white people, because they hate the country. That&rsquo;s why the powerful media, who also hates the country, put them in these positions of power.  They only care about bringing in more brown voters. Everyone of them should be thrown out of office. </p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s the cars parked on front lawns that caused me to move to greener pastures (in my case a house on the side of a hill with a view of pasturelands and hills).  The lawn cars, as I call them, are the first sign of a neighborhood in decline.  The town I lived in not only didn&rsquo;t enforce nuisance statutes, but actually started something called &#8220;Hispanic Days,&#8221; a weeklong celebration during the summer. It was clear that my services as a white taxpayer were no longer desired, so I sold my house and moved away.  <br>
Oh, I should add that the town had a rash of drive by shootings last summer.   Good luck, town that I left.  You&rsquo;re going to need it.</p>

Trey Garrison has found a clever way to wiggle out of being, technically, a racist, and it&rsquo;s not a bad strategy. </p>
<p>While you&rsquo;re a racist if you say that one race is better than others, one can still get away with saying one prefers the company of one particular culture over others. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s politically-incorrect, but one can still say it, without being ostracized completely. </p>
<p>And if other races don&rsquo;t care to behave in such a way as to fit in with Garrison&rsquo;s culture of choice, or simply can&rsquo;t fit in, then Garrison can tell himself he&rsquo;s not a racist, even if his actions are indistinguishable from one. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a familiar variation on the lies liberals tell themselves so that they can send their kid to a private school, or they can move to an affluent, white community, or avoid doing business in certain areas   &mdash;   even while feeling that they&rsquo;re &#8216;good people.&rsquo; </p>

			<p>I have some black neighbors who live two houses down.  They&rsquo;ve lived there two years and I don&rsquo;t know their first names, where they work nor do I make any effort to associate with them, and it&rsquo;s mutual.  I was coming home last month and happily noticed a sale sign in the their yard. I&rsquo;m only guessing, put possibly a victim of the subprime meltdown?   </p>

			<p>The popular seems to be, that any setting that is primarily white &#8220;needs&#8221; diversity, because there is some flaw in whiteness calling out for balance. ANd that then the nonwhite persons, somehow already complete in &#8220;diversity&#8221;, bring that quality to the white setting.  IN this view, diversity means nothing but &#8220;white deficiency.&#8221;  If we are to consider diversity as benefcial for all people, then there are many areas in the country and world badly in need of an influx of white people, to bring them the needed diversity.  Best of all would be to stop focusing on &#8220;diversity&#8221; as something that is external to us, and start looking inward and cultivating our own &#8220;diversity&#8221; in our own personalities.  </p>
