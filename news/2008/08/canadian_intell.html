<h1><a href="http://ia.rediff.com/news/2008/aug/27can.htm">Canadian Intelligence Seeks Support of Muslim Leaders</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ajit Jain, Rediff (Bombay), August 27, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A grieving member of Air India victims&rsquo; family told the regional director of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, &#8220;You were responsible for the death of my father.&#8221;</p>
<p>Andy Ellis reportedly told leaders of the local Muslim community that this encounter took place while he was attending a memorial service last year for 329 people killed in the Air India bombing in June 1985.</p>
<p>&#8220;I came back to my staff and said I never, never want to go to the consecration of another memorial for victims of terrorism,&#8221; Ellis said.</p>
<p>He said the report of Judge John Major about the Air India tragedy is likely to be released soon, but no judge reportedly needs to tell him CSIS failed.</p>
<p>The Muslim leaders were invited for the round table as Canada&rsquo;s spy agency is reportedly frightened of potential terrorist attacks on Canadians and now are seeking the help of Muslim leaders.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you to help.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  Us doing it alone is like one hand clapping,&#8221; Ellis told the group on August 16 in Toronto.</p>
<p>Not many Muslims were interested in attending this round table and in fact some e-mails were reportedly circulated advising Muslim leaders to stay away from the meeting.</p>
<p>Ellis admitted that attendance was small, which was unfortunate for him. He conceded that prior to the meeting, certain opinion makers in the Muslim community had circulated e-mails suggesting it was best to give the meeting a pass, since no high level political officials from Ottawa were there.</p>
<p>It happened as &#8220;the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, CSIS and other agencies have lost credibility,&#8221; one of about 20 Muslims who came for the meeting reportedly stood up to tell Ellis.</p>
<p>His reference was to 18 young Muslims who were arrested two years back for allegedly conspiring to commit terrorist acts within the country, targeting important buildings and some political leaders. Charges against many of them have been dropped.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&rsquo;t target the Muslim community; we are trying to work with you,&#8221; Ellis said. He reportedly stressed that CSIS and RCMP lawfully zero in on the tiny percentage of Muslims who are drawn towards violent extremism, and urged Muslim leaders to get past &lsquo;urban legend&rsquo; and read up on what judges are actually finding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our security is threatened by jihadists,&#8221; author and broadcaster Tarek Fatah said.</p>
<p>CSIS and other law enforcement agencies are worried as many Muslim terrorists in Canada are homegrown, without any connection with Al Qaeda or Taliban.<br>

<p>  Non Whites will always blame Whites for everything. Everytime. There is no winning with them. They will always blame you irrespective of what you do. Most non Whites especially Blacks, Hispanics, South Asians and Middle-Easterners believe that Whites want to harm them and keep them down. Irrespective of all the community outreach, anti- white laws, charity etc&hellip;, irrespective of all the bending over backwards by Whites to assimilate them, they will always believe that Whites are evil who want to harm them. There is nothing Whites can do to change this.<br>
The Air India tragedy was due to Sikh separatists, not Canadian officials.</p>

			<p>The surprising thing is that the Canadians are surprised.  The muslims know they are not us; that we are &#8220;the other&#8221;.  Only the marxist white is do deluded to deny the basic tribalism that is part of all mankind.</p>

<p>Sorry, boys.  Dudly Do-Right will just have to work alone from now on.</p>
<p>Not only will the community refuse to assist, they&rsquo;re going to constitute a very troublesome faction for these multicult eggheads in the very near future.</p>
<p>Can anybody say jihad?</p>

			<p>   well, well, well, it would seem that Canada&rsquo;s lax security and &#8220;welcome all muslims&#8221; attitude&#8221; has come back to bite them real hard. I remember a saying I once heard: &#8220;reality is a cold hard thing when it comes up and bites you.&#8221; Now what are you gonna do? Hey, ask for help from our immigration idiots. Maybe you can ask these terrorists to self-deport. It would seem that the words Canadian and intelligence used together are an oxymoron.</p>

<p>Marxist whites - that is everyone who hasn&rsquo;t been living in a cave the last 50 years&hellip; they see Everyone as the &#8216;other&rsquo;, not just some foreigners. Family bonds can be broken. A house is not a home. Perhaps this is why a racial consciousness is needed among whites. Perhaps. While &#8216;Muslims&rsquo; only see groups like whites as strangers, the modern Whites see everyone as a stranger. They must be equally standoffish from everyone. Of course there will always be those in groups A who will be more equal than those in group B.<br>

			<p>Canada&rsquo;s spy agency was too busy looking for &#8220;terrorists&#8221; in anti-immigration groups during the 80&rsquo;s and 90&rsquo;s to be of any use now. </p>

			<p>White Canadians who are now waking up big time to the danger of Muslim immigrant extremists, terrorists, gay killing, liberal hating Muslims will not get far in recruiting moderate Muslims to work with them to protect the beautiful, John Lennon style &#8220;Imagine&#8221; multi cultural society of Canada.</p>
<p>Instead Canadians need to start to work with Central and Eastern Europeans who have centuries of experiences dealing with encroachig Muslims - Romanians, Serbs can usually be counted on to take the White, non Muslim side. </p>
<p>Vlad the Impaler - Count Dracula of Romania - now there was a guy the Muslim invaders respected.</p>

			<p>What a shock&hellip;Muslims don&rsquo;t want to help a nation that is actively engaged in lobbing shells and ordinance costing upwards of $150,000 at peasants, anmong other awful war crimes. This nation has proved it&rsquo;s no slouch when it comes to joining into the Bush/Cheney &#8220;war on terror&#8221;. </p>
<p>Hopefully, if Canada goes to the polls in a few weeks, we may get a new governmment that will pull us out now and hopefully ease the well-founded animosity of those whose peoples we have killed, maimed and blinded and destroyed the homes and lives of.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a big if&hellip;.</p>

			<p>I just attended a meeting of Muslims living in Canada.  </p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t be happy with anything less than their people in the driver&rsquo;s seat, and whites being subservient to their wishes.</p>

<p>That is true, Jasper.  The reason non-whites blame us is that our race is so politically correct and kind to others that we appear weak to them.  </p>
<p>The more aggressive races dislike us because they are jealous of us in many ways, though they will never admit it.  </p>
<p>If the Canadians came across as proud of being native-born white Canadians, and made it clear that their land belongs to them first and foremost, no foreign races would dare using guilt-trip, manipulating tactics on them.  </p>
<p>Right now the Russians are my role models for what strong, proud white people look and act like.</p>

<p>May the next Muslim piloted aircraft hit YOUR home. It wasn&rsquo;t a country that hit our towers down here BOB, it was MUSLIMS in the left seat, you clown. Muslims are the same everywhere, they want the whole world MUSLIM or dead. My choice of course, is all of them dead instead of us.</p>

			<p>Muslims infesting Western Christian nations count every new immigrant from an Islamic state as bringing them one day closer  to conquest, while white citizens of these Christian nations count every new immigrant from an Islamic state as another future target for termination.  </p>
<p>These arrogant and incompatible Muslim primitives will cease to exist once the domestic traitors who comprise their support base are eventually tried for treason and executed&hellip;    </p>
