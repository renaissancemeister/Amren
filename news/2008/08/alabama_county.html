						<p>Alabama&rsquo;s largest county appears headed for the biggest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history, a $3.2 billion mess created by the nation&rsquo;s credit crunch and a colossal, corruption-riddled sewer project.</p>
<p>Politicians in Jefferson County &mdash; which has 658,000 residents and includes the state&rsquo;s biggest city, Birmingham &mdash; are struggling to find a way out of the jam, but they have mostly abandoned talk of raising taxes and fees after running into fierce opposition at raucous public meetings.</p>
<p>On Thursday, with their options running out, the county commissioners all but threw up their hands and decided to let the voters weigh in on Election Day with a nonbinding referendum on whether to file for bankruptcy.</p>
<p>&#8220;The entire nation is watching to see how we handle this,&#8221; said Jeff Sewell, an assistant county attorney. &#8220;This is a question of character as well as one of finance.&#8221;</p>
<p>A bankruptcy filing by Jefferson County would shatter the previous record of $1.7 billion, set by Orange County, Calif., in 1994.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And it could damage the county&rsquo;s credit rating for years to come, making it more expensive to borrow money and more difficult to finance the infrastructure improvements that can draw industries to Birmingham, a banking and medical-research center once known as the Pittsburgh of the South, back when it was a steelmaking powerhouse.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The crisis has come amid a federal bribery-and-kickback scandal involving contracts awarded on the project. Twenty-one people have been convicted in the still-unfolding case, including contractors, engineers and two former county commissioners.</p>
<p>Federal investigators say some of the deals by which the project was financed were corrupt, with politicians suspected of steering investment business to friends for kickbacks. But they say the corruption didn&rsquo;t directly lead to the runaway debt.</p>
<p>Because of the project&rsquo;s costs, water rates have gone up 329 percent since 1997, with the average customer now paying about $65 a month. Those increases, combined with the investigation of possible sweetheart deals, have left taxpayers angry and distrustful.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The graft investigation reached a shocking point last year with the bribery conviction of former Commissioner Chris McNair, whose daughter was one of the four black girls killed in an infamous racist church bombing in Birmingham in 1963. McNair, who oversaw the sewer work from 1996 until he resigned in 2001, was sentenced to five years in prison.</p>
<p><b>Mayor under suspicion</b></p>
<p>Among those still under suspicion is former Commissioner Larry Langford, who was elected mayor of Birmingham last year in a landslide. He has denied any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>The county has won repeated extensions from its creditors since March, with the latest one running through mid-November. After that, it is unclear how long the crisis can go on.</p>

			<p>I am a Birmingham resident, and this is nothing new. Corruption by black politicians has been rampant. Ever since segregation, the totally corrupt black leadership has been draining the coffers.</p>
<p>They just move money from one pocket to another. Every town in the suburbs of Birmingham is thriving, but Birmingham is dying on the vine.</p>

			<p>And yet, the county has Birmingham&rsquo;s central business district.  I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re going belly up because they&rsquo;re not getting enough revenue, it&rsquo;s just that they&rsquo;re spending too much.</p>
<p>In a related story, the tourist authorities for Birmingham, England accidentally put pictures from Birmingham, Alabama in a brochure.  Maybe that&rsquo;s our Birmingham&rsquo;s only hope, that tourists who want England&rsquo;s wind up coming here.</p>

			<p>You are correct that Jefferson County, Alabama is a prime example of what happens when blacks are at the helm and political correctness runs a muck! </p>
<p>However there is a white knight! In Alabama there is a man by the name of David Bronner who is a financial genius and who is in charge of the the retirement funds for state workers aka. RSA (Retirement Systems of Alabama). </p>
<p>David Bronner is in the process of BUYING Jefferson County to keep it from going into bankruptcy. With David in charge it will be run correctly, I guarantee it! Of course, that will never make a headline since David is white.</p>

<p>Sir, i decided to edit your thought: &#8220;I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re going belly up because they&rsquo;re not getting enough revenue, it&rsquo;s just that they&rsquo;re spending too much.&#8221; Now it reads &#8220;I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re going belly up because they&rsquo;re not getting enough revenue, it&rsquo;s just that they&rsquo;re STEALING too much.&#8221; </p>
<p>Another point. I dont blame the black thieves, this the business they are only able to do. I blame the white idiots who elected them in a landslide.</p>

			<p>The real issue here is that they are funneling money from outside the area into lining each other&rsquo;s pockets.  Who cares if they waste their own money and have to live in a rat hole because of it.  That&rsquo;s what the blacks voted into office and they should have to live with it.</p>
<p>The problem is the federal system that funnels a tsunami of money their way.</p>
<p>Our country desperately needs tax reform.  Basically, we need the right to decide who can and cannot live in our neighborhoods and we need the power to ensure that taxes collected in our neighborhoods STAY in our neighborhoods.  Do this and you shatter the liberals ability to do mischief with &#8220;other people&rsquo;s money&#8221;.</p>
<p>The first step to making that happen is the national Fair Tax Act.  The big thing to understand about this reform is it abolishes the IRS, shifting the duty to collect taxes from a federal to a local level.  At a later date, should the local governments refuse to turn it over to the feds for redistribution to other municipalities&hellip;.well, there is little they could do about it.</p>

			<p>Besides the obvious blackness of the Mayor, what is the black content of the rest of the governing body of this fiasco and their culpability? I could guess but I know some of the AR readers know and could post pictures, as has been done before (at least for my amusement here in Iraq) </p>

			<p>A $ 3.2 billion dollar shortfall in a community with 685,000 people? These Jefferson County Commissioners should be Washington DC politicians. </p>
<p>By the way, anyone who paid a dime towards Mayor Langford&rsquo;s new set of choppers, paid 10 cents too much.</p>

They tell us all they want is the opportunity to run their own communities, when they fail, they blame whites for not doing enough.</p>
<p>Blacks create their own circumstances then blame us.</p>

			<p>Gosh, what a shocker! Black administration mired in corruption!</p>
<p>Actually, the real shocker would be the headlining of a scrupulously clean and honest black adminstration of anything, be it municipal, county, state, or national government.</p>
<p>I can think of no examples at any level of this.  I&rsquo;m not saying for a fact that there aren&rsquo;t any, just that I&rsquo;ve never heard of any.</p>
<p>Can anybody enlighten me with an example?</p>

			<p>To Skip:</p>
<p>Corruption in Jefferson County is legendary! It goes back for years.  The modern variety can be traced to the tenure of one mayor, Richard Arrington, an African - American, who had, to put it mildly, questionable ethics. That was the start of the modern decline.</p>
<p>Alabama is fundamentally a poor state. For example, city attorneys in Alabama, which are on retainers, are RARELY paid more than one hundred thousand dollars a year. Mayor Arrington&rsquo;s attorney, one Donald Watkins, a mostly white, bright, mulatto lawyer, with ties to Alabama State University, a black college in Montgomery, was reportedly paid approximately 1.5 million A YEAR as a city attorney for Birmingham. Donald&rsquo;s one task, along with keeping his white girlfriend out of the spotlight, was to keep the mayor out of jail.</p>
<p>I would doubt that any city attorney anywhere could get away with this.</p>
<p>As an aside, Donald was the first attorney on the team of Richard Scrushy a financial wizard who put together an enterprise known as &#8220;Health South&#8221; until it fell apart and Richard was federally indicted (to put it mildly, Scrushy  didn&rsquo;t like African - Americans - AT ALL!!!!). To everyones amazement Richard hires Donald, who was semi retired at the time, to be his defense lawyer. Hmmmmmmm. </p>
<p>Shortly before the trial was to begin the largest black church in Birmingham began a huge church project funded entirely by Richard Schrusy! Surprise!  Surprise!</p>
<p>At the trial, the front row of the court was filled with African - American preachers who did little more than glare at the African Americans on the jury. Scrushy was acquitted. Donald made millions. And Alabama discovered a new twist on political correctness! </p>

<p>Funny you mentioned that. My first thought when I saw his picture was, &#8220;Good God, where did he get those awful teeth?&#8221; You can tell they&rsquo;re fake from a mile away! </p>

<p>Perhaps, but Birmingham metro is almost 75% black, and the overall county has only a fairly slim white majority.<br>

			<p>Birmingham sounds a lot like my old hometown of Memphis. In the last 4 or 5 years alone over 150 elected (almost all Black) officials in Memphis have been convicted of crimes. </p>
<p>As they say, Africa is wherever Africans are.  </p>
