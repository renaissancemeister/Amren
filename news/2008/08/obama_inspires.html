<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Sen. Barack Obama isn&rsquo;t just inspiring black voters to register in large numbers as he gets closer to being the Democratic presidential nominee. Evidence indicates that he&rsquo;s motivating some black Republicans to switch parties.</p>
<p>The only three states that track voting registration by party and race show black Republican registration dropping slightly since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>Florida has 81,512 more black Democrats compared to a loss of 784 black Republicans; Louisiana has 34,325 more black Democrats, while the number of black Republicans dropped by 907; North Carolina has 92,356 more black Democrats and 2,850 fewer black Republicans.</p>
<p>While the number of blacks who have left the GOP for the Democratic Party can&rsquo;t be pinpointed, it&rsquo;s not hard to find voters who have made the switch.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Whitfield Jenkins of Ocala [Florida] became a Republican nearly four decades ago, abandoning the Democrats out of anger when black voters helped elect a state lawmaker who later opposed a state holiday for Martin Luther King Jr. In 2006, Jenkins helped Republican Gov. Charlie Crist&rsquo;s campaign, but this year he switched back to the Democratic Party for one reason: Obama.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Overall, Florida now has nearly 1.1 million black Democrats, compared to just under 64,000 black Republicans. Louisiana has about 704,000 black Democrats and 26,000 black Republicans, and North Carolina has more than 1 million black Democrats and just under 44,000 black Republicans.</p>
<p>Three other states &mdash; Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina &mdash; track voter registration by race, but voters don&rsquo;t register with parties. Each has seen large increases in black registration over recent seven-month periods, Georgia by almost 123,000, South Carolina by 43,198 Alabama by 20,844.</p>
<p>The biggest impact could be in Florida, where polls show a tight race between Obama and Republican John McCain. President Bush carried the state by only 537 votes in 2000. Democrats believe the result would have been different if not for problems in largely black precincts.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Florida GOP Chairman Jim Greer acknowledges that attracting more black Republicans has been difficult because of Obama&rsquo;s candidacy and says he doesn&rsquo;t expect a significant change in registration numbers this year despite party efforts to reach out to black voters.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some black Republicans say they&rsquo;re supporting Obama but not switching parties. They include former Florida Black Republican Council President Dorsey Miller, who helped former Republican Gov. Jeb Bush&rsquo;s campaigns and supports Crist.</p>

			<p>O my G-d! It&rsquo;s so boring. Again and again they pour from empty glass into vacant one. Every sane man and every insane man knows, that blacks, like wolves, will follow blacks, and it doesn&rsquo;t matter what the party is.</p>

			<p>I have said it on this medium before, and I&rsquo;ll say it every time a story like this comes up.</p>
<p>Most black &#8220;Republicans&#8221; are only &#8220;Republicans&#8221; because of two reasons:  (1)  The Queue in the Democrats is longer, and (2) The Republicans pander for them.  Therefore, the way to be a &#8220;star&#8221; in a hurry, if you&rsquo;re black, is to become a Republican.  Whether or not you actually think like most Republicans think.</p>
<p>Now, they&rsquo;re all demonstrating themselves for what they were all along.  And the Stupid Party is so shocked.</p>

			<p>Sounds good to me.  Let all the blacks move to the Democratic party so we can reform the Republican party into a real white nationalist party.  As long as the Republicans keep trying to keep up the myth of the big tent white conservatives issues will continue to be ignored.  </p>

			<p>So black republicans make up roughly 4% of some state policital parties? And those guys are going to vote for obama no doubt. Big deal. When a black votes black, its support, when  a white doesnt vote for a black, its racisim! </p>
<p>Where are the secret anti black meetings held? No one invites me, because they dont exist. </p>

			<p>If I were black I&rsquo;d probably vote for Obama. No black has ever come this close. However, I&rsquo;m White and will vote for John McCain. Not so much because I like him, I just don&rsquo;t trust Obama &amp; Friends.<br/>

			<p>That&rsquo;s actually a very good thing.   Not mentioned, of course, is how far more whites are being influenced to leave the democratic party and join the republicans.</p>
<p>For example, polls done by FOX news show that a whopping half of all Clinton supporters (about half of all democrats are Clinton supporters) say they will never vote for Obama, no matter what.  An unheard of 10% or so, have plans to vote for McCain instead.</p>
<p>I think the democrats are about to learn the hard way that diversity is a weakness, not a strength.  Not only will it lose them this election, but they will be substantially weakened forever afterward.</p>

			<p>  Honestly, everyone here obviously has enough intelligence to know that alan keyes and other republican leaning blacks will vote the race card. Surely nobody really thought blacks would vote for a non-black if a black was running for the same office. Minorities have enough sense to vote for people whom will cater to their needs. We whites seem to have lost our perspective and are willing to commit racial suicide and vote for non-whites. What has happened to us as a race? Have we no pride left, what-so-ever?</p>

			<p>I am not surprised by this. Up until recently I was one of the naïve white folk who thought that given a chance, Africans would eventually mature enough to play by the rules of hard work and success. I have learned first hand the fallacy of that belief. It&rsquo;s about tribalism and stickin it to Whitey. That is why I will never support an African candidate regardless of political beliefs. </p>

<p>Blacks are for blacks first, last, and always, so long as they don&rsquo;t advocate individual responsibility, and aren&rsquo;t against affirmative action.</p>

			<p>In order for the Republican party to attract black voters, they have to act more like Democrats, thus alienating all important white voters.  This should be a no brainer for them, but year after year the morons in blue suits go through this obligatory song and dance like the annual Easter sermon of the Pope&hellip;it&rsquo;s who they are.  Ronald Reagan had it just right in the seventies.  He called the Nixon/Ford led Republican party &#8220;the banker for the welfare state.&#8221;  What has changed?</p>

			<p>this is an article that baffles me, what difference does it make if blacks vote for a Republican or a Democrat. Both parties are simply opposite wings of the same bird and as such they are both taking the country to the same destination. That destination is the destruction of the United States as a nation. The elites in this country think they can have a bilingual nation based on a North American Union, in reality what hey are doing is laying the foundation for civil war. The outcome will be several seperate natioons based on race, ethnicity and language with the SouthWest rejoining Mexico.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Overall, Florida now has nearly 1.1 million black Democrats, compared to just under 64,000 black Republicans. Louisiana has about 704,000 black Democrats and 26,000 black Republicans, and North Carolina has more than 1 million black Democrats and just under 44,000 black Republicans.&#8221;<br/>
Well, this is simply shocking!</p>
<p>I would never have guessed that blacks are so overwhelmingly Democratic in orientation and that some of the few black Republicans, are going to vote for Saint Obama simply because he is black; next, someone will prove that the earth is round and really shake my brains loose. What has happened to the concept of a &#8220;multicultural&#8221; and &#8220;nonracial&#8221; political system, that is equally distributed among the various nonexistent &#8220;races&#8221; of the USA? Certainly, for every black that believes that government should wet-nurse all Americans through life, there are equal numbers of them who understand that the federal government should be limited and provide only basic: military, regulatory, mediating, and security services? Moreover, am I the only one here at AR who is moved to tears of despair by the surprising fact that race seems to be playing such a large role in this election?</p>
<p>I have to stop writing now, because I am simply sobbing in despondent horror at the apparent failure of MLK&rsquo;s dream that all would (or should) be voting for the content of the candidates&rsquo; characters and not the color of their skins!</p>

			<p>&#8220;The Quinnipiac poll includes language from the ballot measure that says &#8216;the state shall not discriminate against or grant preferential treatment to any group or individual on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin&rsquo; in hiring, contracting or education. The Rasmussen poll used similar language.</p>
<p>&#8216;On the surface, this amendment sounds like something most Democrats would want to vote for; it gets rid of what sounds like racial favoritism,&rsquo; Loevy said. &#8216;It takes a while to explain to people that there are certain implications to this &mdash; doing away with certain affirmative action programs.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>It never ceases to amaze me that people like this fool Loevy, always feel that most voters are so stupid that they cannot figure out that an anti-affirmative action proposal is exactly that, an anti-affirmative action proposal. No, it always has to be that some dark and mysterious force has crafted an initiative or amendment that simply has &#8220;mystified&#8221; the lumpen proletariat yet again. Never mind that much Republican electoral success has been crafted over the last 25 years in denouncing this vile anti-white reverse apartheid, or that every such a measure is put on a ballot it passes with an overwhelming majority; nope, it just has to be the outright ignorance of the people that allows for such catastrophic miscarriages of &#8220;justice&#8221; and &#8220;equality.&#8221; </p>
<p>In particular, the &#8220;ignorance&#8221; of most white people; this is of course when the &#8220;anointed&#8221; media and political &#8220;elites&#8221; are being kind enough (as they are in this article) to not accuse us of &#8220;racism&#8221; in tandem with &#8220;ignorance.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, things are not always so simplistic as these self-absorbed and sanctimonious Red idiots would have us believe; most white voters do live in a real world, not in ivory towers and gilded compounds. This is why CCRI spokeswoman Jessica Peck Corry, really does hit a homerun on the topic when she notes above that: &#8220;the high support among Democratic voters reflected &#8216;a huge divide between the Democrat elites&rsquo; and the party&rsquo;s rank and file,&#8221; who &hellip;&#8220;&#8216;don&rsquo;t have time for lofty political debates that many elite Democrats can afford to have.&rsquo;&#8221; </p>
<p>Those very succinct and insightful observations by Mrs. Corry, simply makes a point that even &#8220;Republicans&#8221; tend to forget once in power: we are not isolated from or inoculated against the nonwhite plagues of affirmative action and &#8220;immigration,&#8221; we live with and in them. That is why we wish to do away with them!</p>
<p>Perhaps, if things change enough, that situation can be reversed?</p>
<p>What more to say, other then, God let it be so!</p>

			<p>I always laugh when I read that 95% of voting blacks intend to vote for Obama.  It will be 100%.  </p>

			<p>The tenor of the responses thus far is that, by some sort of compulsion, all black Republicans will vote for Obama, regardless of race.  As someone who is young, (mulatto), and a registered Republican, Obama no more has my vote than any other Democrat for that matter.</p>
<p>When it comes right down to it, a Liberal of any stripe (no pun intended) doesn&rsquo;t belong in the White House.</p>
<p>Of course, let&rsquo;s be honest&hellip;McCain is no paragon of conservatism, either; Republican or otherwise.  When we speak of conservatism with respect to McCain (and I&rsquo;m assuming that is what posters to amren ultimately mean), we&rsquo;re ultimately speaking to a matter of degree, not a difference in type.</p>
<p>We could state the matter this way:  McCain is less Liberal than Obama.</p>
<p>Whether you posters to amren like my type or not is immaterial.  <br/>
Ultimately, we are all Americans; our nation is the greatest in the world.  </p>
<p>Nevertheless; point conceded: It is quickly being destroyed through rampant immigration and immorality.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s funny how the dishonorable MLK admonished Americans to judge not by the color of one&rsquo;s skin but by the content of his character only for his people to judge strictly by skin color.  What a joke only the joke is on white people who were foolish enough to believe in that fraudulent black man and to think that blacks could be as fair minded as they.</p>

			<p>There is a local black in Memphis talk radio who has criticized Obama from the start. He calls him Hussein. This radio host says he is a conservative who loves America, has benefitted from the Bush tax cuts, does not want his taxes raised by Obama. He says Obama is an ultraliberal and he does not support him and plans to vote for McCain.</p>
