						<p>EDUCATION bosses have come up a with a bizarre way to stop bored and disruptive teenage girls from dropping out of school &mdash; hip hop classes.</p>
<p>Pupils on the verge of leaving or being thrown out of school will be taught bounces, body ripples and butt spins to the music of Kanye West and 50 Cent in a bid to spark their enthusiasm in learning.</p>
<p>Educational experts believe the pilot project will re-engage troubled youngsters who have been playing truant or behaving badly.</p>
<p>If successful, the project, developed jointly by dance charity Showcase the Street and Angus College, could be rolled out across the rest of Scotland.</p>
<p>Fergus Storrier, a community policeman and chair of the lottery funded group, yesterday said the classes were not a &#8220;soft option&#8221; and warned girls would not be allowed to slack off.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want the course to act as a vehicle to re-engage them, but we will be setting ground rules,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&rsquo;t want to simply take them out of school and that is all they do. There will be a clear understanding that this is an add-on, conditional on carrying out their normal school work.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 60-hour scheme teaching basic moves has been accredited by the college to provide six Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework credit points. A Higher is worth 24 credits.</p>
<p>Initially, 15 youngsters from Arbroath will enrol.</p>
<p>Iverene Bromfield, curriculum manager for communication, arts and social sciences at Angus College, said it would teach the girls useful skills. She added: &#8220;This qualification will be of use anywhere where people are trying to enthuse and inspire youngsters. It will promote a can-do attitude and give them a sense of achievement on which to build.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, critics insisted disruptive and bad behaviour should not be rewarded.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Smith, Conservative schools spokeswoman, said: &#8220;It is up to individual headteachers if they think it would be appropriate for some pupils. It may be that some pupils will respond, but I would be sceptical.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very much our policy that pupils who are persistently disruptive should be removed from class until they learn to behave and that is popular with teachers and parents alike.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, teachers refused to knock the scheme. Jim Docherty, depute general secretary of the Scottish Secondary Teachers&rsquo; Association, said: &#8220;There have been various initiatives of this type and while it is maybe a bit unusual it may have a function.</p>
<p>&#8220;The SSTA has no objection to anything that retains contact between children and the education system.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are an estimated 35,000 teenagers in Scotland who choose to claim benefits rather than study or work.</p>
<p>A study by Westminster&rsquo;s education department in 2002 calculated each such youngster cost the country £45,000 in benefits.<br>

Why go half way?  The hip hop gyrations is no way to tease the youngsters.  Keep the lads and lasses in school by having classes in sexual intercourse.  <br>

			<p>Sure,a little voodoo music to compliment the Marxist indoctrination will go a long way in enlightening the diverse student body comrades.There&rsquo;s no end to the insanity in our world.And the USA leads the way in the destruction of the West.I hear the fiddle playing and can almost see the flames leaping all around us as this nation burns to the ground.The Gestapo will have no need to include these kids in their roundup patrols.In fact,they may be our guards listening to hip-hop in the concentration camps.</p>

			<p>How&rsquo;s this work?  They do hip-hop classes because they&rsquo;re ready to drop out.  But the &#8220;butt spinning&#8221; is somehow supposed to rejuvenate their interest in the academics they weren&rsquo;t interested in to begin with?</p>
<p>Maybe now these schools will have to give diplomas in hip hop, to comply with diversity mandates.</p>

<p>Wow!! I&rsquo;ve got to get back on the dole. In my day it was £40.00 a week plus £40.00 for housing benefit, that&rsquo;s a grand total of 4K a year. That was not even 5 years ago.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;d they get £45,000 from? unless they meant £4,500 which is much more likely.</p>

			<p>This story is an other reason to believe their are agents out there who are bent on destroying our lives, and through the children. They plot their wicked sceme. That is, dumbing down education to fit the needs of the liberal-fascist machine to keep the money flowing in. But, I for one, know that I&rsquo;m happy as hell that I bailed out of a  disfunctional, MIDDLE-SCHOOL, in Forida, the conditions were not what was familiar with me, i.e., civil. I came from the north-east and was not ready for it. I was a white kid in public school system that back then, mandated I sit a-long-side  these total and utter losers.&#8221; Who could learn a thing&#8221;! they couldn&rsquo;t shut their mouths long enough ever to be even taught how to wipe their own asses correctly.</p>

			<p>I have some better ideas.  They are predicated on common sense and individual responsibility which means they are unfashionable and will be rejected.</p>
<p>Allow children to quit school at 14 if they are not academically inclined.</p>
<p>Encourage them to develop a skilled trade like plumber, carpenter, or electrician - skills that are constantly in demand.</p>
<p>No welfare for such people since one gets more of what one subsidises.</p>
<p>Severe prision sentences for feral behaviour - crimes against property (which includes the person). </p>
<p>Corporal punishment reintroduced including public floggings for &#8220;urban yoot&#8221;. </p>
<p>Immigrants are educated only if they speak English fluently.</p>

<p>Now, I&rsquo;m no fancy, big city economist, but when you are faced with the problem &#8220;Too many parasitic teenagers&#8221;, the solution is not &#8220;Introduce buttock-wagging lunacy into the school system,&#8221; but rather, &#8220;Quit giving freeloaders other people&rsquo;s money.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dump welfare, dump public education.  Let these children join the real world with both its rewards for success and penalties for failure.  &#8220;Bored and disruptive&#8221; will not be an option in that case.  </p>

AmRen&rsquo;s magazine recently featured the cover story &#8220;The Re-Africanization of the West.&#8221; The depressing news item above   &mdash;   straight outta blue-eyed, freckle-faced Scotland   &mdash;   suggests that &#8220;Africanization&#8221; is even more widespread and deeply ingrained a problem than we&rsquo;d imagined. </p>

			<p>How will teaching kids to act Black make them do well in school?  Why not teach them to dance in sex-segregated circles to Klezmer music, and hope that some of that Jewish love of scholarship rubs off on them?  </p>

			<p>Lovely.<br>
 And let&rsquo;s not forget the side benefit of inculcating a sense of comfort when hearing these familiar tunes come blasting out of night clubs and cars. The girls will identify with the black culture and be that much closer to miscegenation without the blacks even having to &#8220;work&#8221; or rape for it.</p>
<p>Hell, we might as well strip our White girls of their clothing, drug them, then dump them out in the ghetto.</p>

			<p>You know, if a certain segment of the student population (and I think we all know which one ;)) needs hip-hop classes to maintain interest, perhaps it&rsquo;d be better to hold separate classes teaching them to become better floor moppers or sweepers, in preparation for their future careers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but if you need to be physically stimulated all the time for you to concentrate on simple math problems, you&rsquo;re NOT going to become the next Einstein. It might come as a harsh truth to the libtards out there, but a truth it is nonetheless.</p>

			<p>&#8220;This qualification will *be of use anywhere where people are trying to enthuse and inspire youngsters*. It will *promote a can-do attitude* and *give them a sense of achievement* on which to build.&#8221;</p>
<p>Does anyone else posting on American Renaissance feel that Europe, the United States and all former-majority-white nations<br>
 are slowly entering a bizarre, Orwellian Twilight Zone where *Up is Down*, *Love is Hate* and *2 + 2 = Fish*? How is teaching female students the human equivalent of animal mating rituals somehow going to turn them into &#8220;upstanding citizens&#8221;, or impart on them &#8220;any&#8221; lifeskills?<br>
This reminds me of how Americans are always told &#8220;African-American students need an &#8216;Afrocentric&rsquo; course&#8221;, which involves little more than blatant theft of inventions and nations accredited to non-sub-Saharan Africans.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d wager that - in a few years time - half the &#8220;upstanding, white lassies&#8221; involved will either be shacking up with black thugs, or raising the inevitable mulatto love-children of these unions.</p>

<p>Why? They are also going to be giving them &#8216;your&rsquo; job later, regardless of academic achievement. </p>
<p>&#8220;Americans are always told &ldquo;African-American students need an &lsquo;Afrocentric&rsquo; course&rdquo;, which involves little more than blatant theft of inventions and nations accredited to non-sub-Saharan Africans&#8221;</p>
<p>The push is always toward more &#8216;inclusion&rsquo;, sure, but even the whitest schools are already afrocentric. As is much of the government and media where only the experience of blacks is important, and every issue is discussed as to how it does or does not affect them - ignoring everyone else. Of course nowadays &#8216;inclusion&rsquo; demands we ignore only white boys. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the problem, cut off the welfare. Instead of introducing them hip hop music, counsel them. Tell them straight up that without an education or degree, they will only get low paying jobs. If they still won&rsquo;t listen, let them drop out. They will soon be educated by the &#8220;school of hard knocks&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Everyone here misses the point, seems to me. &#8220;Hip-Hop&#8221; is not related to music whatsoever.  I saw the dj&rsquo;s &amp; break dancers doing their thing in Times Square etc. 25 + years ago.  None were musicians then or ever.  None whatsoever can do a real gig.  PC liberals won&rsquo;t admit that the farce called &#8220;hip-hop&#8221; is a &#8220;black&#8221; version of karaoke.  Take their samplers, turntables &amp; other gizmos away &amp; the noise will stop.  &#8220;FAKE MUSIC&#8221;.</p>

			<p>If I am not mistaken, it is Classical music (European or Asian) which is said to help improve the cognitive ability of children and adults alike. As far as my children are concerned I started this during the pregnancy of my wife. She was forced to listen to her daily dose of Mozart, Tchaikovsky, Chopin etc&hellip;, European folk music and even some Japanese and Chinese classical stuff I got from my Asian friends. As soon as my child was born, he too enjoyed some soft classical music from day one. I had read somewhere that when exposed to hip-hop canines howl loudly but when exposed to classical music they calm down and become cheerful. </p>
<p>  These liberals are doing exactly the opposite and are thus foolish or evil.</p>

			<p>Please don&rsquo;t forget that the current UK scottish communist government (lead by scot brown and his scottish cronies in the cabinet) syphons off £1,400 per annum to fund each scottish person from the English taxpayer and that&rsquo;s why scotland has free mecical prescriptions, free university places, free travel, lower council tax and a host of other services. Meanwhile, scotland enjoys the highest death rate in the UK from smoking, obesity and alcohol. No wonder the SNP (scottish national party) pulls in so few electoral novotes as a break from England would cost them a fortune and the scots would have to say goodbye to all these free or subsised perks. Canny or what?? They can easily afford these stupid african jigs in place of a real education, we English fund it anyway.</p>

AND make sure they are &#8216;sterilized&rsquo;.<br>
Honestly, I truly admire many of the strict laws in countries like China. The laws are very firm, but they are a major success. They don&rsquo;t teach hip hop classes for slackers. They don&rsquo;t slap rapists and pedophiles on the wrist and release them from jail, or give free medical, food, housing, education, cable tv, etc. to serial killers, etc., they execute them. Simple. For a better society. AND they don&rsquo;t let dirty politicians take money to cheat those who elected them. </p>

<p>Cousin Charlie from TN&rsquo;s comments:</p>
<p>1. Don&rsquo;t post comments re: music unless you are trained/literate in the field, or at least awake.<br>
2. Why choose two 1960&rsquo;s AA big-money druggy cats for your examples?  Why not Scott Joplin, or James P. Johnson?  They were both musically literate, and American blacks.<br>
3. &#8220;peace and love and respect for their fellow man&#8221; (guffaws).  Music is an abstract art, with no bearing whatsoever upon the fate of any so-called fellow man.<br>

			<p>blacks are not scots. they have done nothing to develop scottish culture. they should be expelled. scotland should free itself from the PC &#8220;commonwealth&#8221; and its parasitic immigrants. scottish values of thrift and hard work, respect for education and logic are the opposite of African &#8216;values&rsquo;.</p>
