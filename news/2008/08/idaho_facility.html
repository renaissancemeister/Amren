<h1>Idaho Facility to End Bone Marrow Program</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, August 7, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Officials at St. Luke&rsquo;s Mountain States Tumor Institute in Boise say the facility is shutting down it&rsquo;s bone-marrow donor registry because it can&rsquo;t meet new standards for adding hundreds of potential minority donors a year.</p>
<p>New standards requiring more than 500 potential minority donors be added annually were recently set by the National Marrow Donor Program based in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>Officials at St. Luke&rsquo;s say they will shut down the program in September.</p>
<p>Mark Allen, the institute&rsquo;s Marrow Donor Center coordinator, says the demographics of the region make it impossible to recruit 1,000 minority bone marrow donors.</p>

			<p>Of course they can&rsquo;t get 1000 minority donors, I doubt they top 1000 donors a year, period. They don&rsquo;t need minority donors because there are no recipients. Still, small as it is, the region needs this facility, now political correctness will close it down. This is just one small example of this country going over the edge.</p>

			<p>The minorities will complain bitterly that there are not enough<br>
minority bone marrow donors but when they are specifically asked to be a donor they hide in the bushes.<br>
Now white children will actually die at the alter of &#8220;Diversity&#8221; because their parents can&rsquo;t afford to travel to Minneapolis to receive a donor bone marrow.</p>

			<p>I remember a semi-regular commenter here at AR, who is a nurse, warned us on several occasions that the health care system is going to engage in a concerted effort to deny health care to whites, in order to enforce &#8220;equality.&#8221;  I think this is one example.</p>
<p>Even if whites have to pay and non-whites can get on the list for free, I bet there will be more whites on this list.</p>

			<p>So, if you are White and live in Idaho, and need bone marrow, you may not get it, even is someone wants to donate it to you, because of the anti-white, racist policies of our government?  </p>
<p>Idaho is predominately white, and so Idaho should predominately collect marrow and store from whites.  Detroit is predominately  black, so Detroit should collect and store marrow primarily from Blacks.  What is so difficult about that?  Why is that racist?</p>
<p>Note that under &#8220;PC&#8221; correctness, every, tiny portion of your entire existence must be somehow directed, connected to, and judged by &#8220;Diversity&#8221;  When is this insanity going to end?</p>

			<p>If the situation were reversed, they would be busing in donors by the thousands to keep the program open</p>

			<p>Oh, this article speaks volumes about the insanity of diversity.  Unfortunately, the real losers are the recipients of bone marrow donation.   They even take something genuinely good and turn it into something no one wants to be a part of.  Good job you loonies in Minnesota!<br>

			<p>So seriously ill patients of Idaho will have to do without a bone marrow registry only because Boise&rsquo;s branch of the registry can&rsquo;t add 500 potential minority donors per year due to demographics? How charitable and kind of the National Marrow Donor Program!</p>
<p>If the NMPD is having a difficult time, in general, finding donors who are non-white, they should put the blame back where it belongs – on the minority populations who won&rsquo;t register to become donors.</p>
<p>In no way should it elect to make rules that shut down a program in a state where the demographics make such a task ridiculous – not to mention impossible.</p>
<p>If you do a search on this organization, (or look-up: marrow.org), the first thing you&rsquo;ll see on their website is a link to: you guessed it - a narrative about a black woman who needed a marrow donor. In fact, it is hard to find a blond-haired, blue-eyed person pictured on their site. It does seem they aren&rsquo;t having a great deal of luck getting donors from non-white population groups – no matter where these individuals are located.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d care to drop this organization a line regarding the short-sightedness and prejudicial nature of their policies, they can be reached by writing:</p>
<p>National Marrow Donor Program<br>
3001 Broadway Street N.E.<br>
Suite 100<br>
Minneapolis, MN 55413-1753</p>
<p>or by:<br>
using their &ldquo;contact us&rdquo; page on their website. Phone them at: 1-800-627-7692</p>
<p>By the way – are any AmRen readers from Idaho? It sure sounds like a beautiful state!<br>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve heard before that many blacks refuse to donate organs out of fear that their donation will be given to a white person in need.  I&rsquo;m sure that bone marrow donations are no different.  Whether its taxes, social services, volunteering for organizations such as Red Cross and other charity work, or donated organs, blacks take more out of the system than they are willing to contribute.  And they absolutely will not donate to anything that could somehow benefit a white person.  From black pro athletes and black celebrities, to regular black citizens, they only donate to programs that benefit minorities in general, and blacks in particular.  Whites will donate to programs that benefit anybody, regardless of race.</p>

<p>So we once again have an example of how the inability of nonwhites to plan ahead and prepare for the future, is going to not only negatively impact whites but also be blamed on them ultimately. We also have, yet again, an ominously rainbow example of just how twisted the diversity pimps are in this country; they will literally commit a stealth form of murder against whites, to prove their &#8220;enlightenment.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have said enough here, since this is one of those stories that is so disgustingly perverse, anything else I would have to write wouldn&rsquo;t go up anyway!<br>

			<p>Frankly, I think this is sick. In some two thirds of organ transplant cases white-to-black you have compatibility problems. And it also is well known that blacks will not donate as much as the dirt under their fingernails (except if mandated by court) i.e. they do not even care about their own! What does that tell you about a community?<br>
The tenor of this legislation is &#8220;If we can´t have transplants, the peckerwoods can´t have either.&#8221; The hatred and vindictiveness are interesting, but hardly surprising.</p>

			<p>When I worked for the Post Office I saw first hand how &#8220;racisss&#8221; blacks are when it comes to donations. Every year the United Way would &#8220;pimp&#8221; the P.O. employees for donations and would pass out booklets listing all the places you could direct your donation to. The blacks would go to GREAT pains to seek out the ones that ONLY helped blacks. I heard one say, &#8220;I only want to help MY people!&#8221; They would also convince some of the &#8220;guilt ridden&#8221; Whites to donate to the black ones also. It still amazes me how many Whites are total suckers when it comes to blacks.</p>

			<p>Why can&rsquo;t whites in Idaho simply raise money on their own and start a private donor program? We may have to buy our way out of this diversity nonsense. Or is the marrow program somehow regulated to prevent this?</p>

			<p>The goal of PC is not to help blacks, the goal is to destroy whites and destroy white America (culture, history, society).</p>
<p>And in this case it is clearly a matter of life and death.</p>
<p>Only if you view PC in this way for what it really is does this kind of thing start to in a way make sense.</p>
<p>Of course then the question arises, what are you going to do about it?</p>

<p>This country is dysfunctional in its present form.  It has been a failed experiment in democracy whose inhabitants were too naive and gullible to keep the seditious elements from coming in, and those who were already here weren&rsquo;t dealt with as harshly as they should have been.</p>
<p>This is the new Babylon and its destruction is guranteed. </p>

			<p>Everyone knows Black people don&rsquo;t donate to ANYTHING! If it won&rsquo;t work in Idaho, how will it work anywhere? All this will do is punish and endanger White in critical need of bone marrow. But I suppose that&rsquo;s OK, they&rsquo;re only White.</p>

			<p>Wow, learn something new every day.  I never realized before that blacks will go to great pains to avoid something that just might benefit a white person.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t work in other people&rsquo;s offices anymore, but if I did, and if the United Way situation came up, I&rsquo;d be very careful what and where I donated.  Wouldn&rsquo;t want to give to any organizations that only help blacks, after reading the above.</p>
<p>Matter of fact, I&rsquo;ve got enough trouble taking care of myself, my partner, and my pets.  No donations for anyone else at all, for now. </p>

			<p>Pressed for his position on apologizing to blacks or offering reparations, Obama said he was more interested in taking action to help people struggling to get by. Because many of them are minorities, he said, that would help the same people who would stand to benefit from reparations.<br>
&ldquo;If we have a program, for example, of universal health care, that will disproportionately affect people of color, because they&rsquo;re disproportionately uninsured,&rdquo; Obama said<br>
&ldquo;I fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say, &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve paid our debt,&rsquo; and to avoid the much harder work.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>And when we have &#8220;federal&#8221; health care under President Obama, backed by Senator Clinton, race &#8220;equality&#8221; will make the US health care system a mess. The current system is flawed but functions. The federally run system will be a nightmare with mediocre care,long waits and lawsuits about &#8220;white&#8221; hospials better financed than &#8220;minority hospitals&#8221; (of course how much money do blacks and hispanics leave in their wills to hospitals or to charity in general?). Oh yes, your doctor will have to treat a minimum percent of persons of color or his license is toast.</p>

			<p>Here is a clear example of how diversity isn&rsquo;t just some &#8220;political&#8221; issue and cannot be treated as if it&rsquo;s as important as one&rsquo;s favorite football or baseball team. Apathetic white idiots will now get a wake up call,especially if their relatives unfortunately need the services of a Marrow Donor Center. Almost all whites who frequent this website know from the &#8220;Color of Crime&#8221; of the war against whites and the massive white &#8220;casaulties&#8221;. Obviously, antiwhite leukophobic diversocrats have really gone too far. Why not see if aconservative legal foundation that supposedly takes these types of cases such as Judicial Watch would sue everyone responsible for this potential homicide. Diversocrats want funds for the Third World but in this case are killing white Americans. When someone requires a bone marrow donor,they are on death&rsquo;s door. We can&rsquo;t allow this. It is simply murder. </p>

			<p>&#8220;And when we have &ldquo;federal&rdquo; health care under President Obama, backed by Senator Clinton, race &ldquo;equality&rdquo; will make the US health care system a mess&hellip; .your doctor will have to treat a minimum percent of persons of color or his license is toast.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition, YOU will be required to be treated by Minority Physicians, many of whom received their MD degrees through Affirmative-Action programs, and who dislike Whites, and who really don&rsquo;t care if you live or die.  In fact, some will see your suffering as their chance to get back at &#8220;Whitey&#8221; for &#8220;300 years of slavery and 300 years of lynchings.&#8221;   We all know what happens when Africans run hospitals, be it in Africa, Haiti, or LA.  Would you trust your child&rsquo;s life to a physician who received his/her medical degree because of skin color?  </p>

			<p>Do diversity dreamers realize that this is one of the best arguments for White Supremacy that has ever been made, or were they hoping to get Idaho to import tons of non-Whites to keep the program alive?</p>
<p>Whites are being told that they have no health care access because their prescence is not being &#8220;graced&#8221; by non-Whites.  It would be considered very wrong for Whites to do this in reverse wouldn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;The goal of PC is not to help blacks, the goal is to destroy whites and destroy white America (culture, history, society).</p>
<p>And in this case it is clearly a matter of life and death.</p>
<p>Only if you view PC in this way for what it really is does this kind of thing start to in a way make sense.</p>
<p>Of course then the question arises, what are you going to do about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>I would suggest that we White Patriots confront the traitors who support our displacement.  Where ever we see and hear them.  Where ever they feel safe.  When reality is brought to their doorstep and their places of refuge they will dread the thought of trying to destroy White people and culture.</p>

			<p>My wife and I have officially withdrawn our willingness to donate bone marror or organs.  She will dondate no more blood.  Does the NMDP have anything it would like to say to us, except that they are sorry, along with a million-dollare check?  A million dollars might make us feel willing to donate marrow.  Or it might not.  We might change our policies.  We have policies, too.</p>
<p>We would be willing to resume our old policy, provided our tissue would be donated on our deaths to whites and/or Japanese only, and no others, for any reason, ever.</p>

			<p>   I remember right after 9/11, the company and union where I worked were asking everybody to donate anything they could afford to donate. Mind you, this isn&rsquo;t a huge company. We have upward of 5,500 people. Of all the money and other items donated, not one single black person, not a single one, donated a single dime to help the people of New York and the Pentagon. Even though the work force is 1/3 black.  I know this to be a fact, they refused to give anything. Their reasoning was, &#8220;let the government help them.&#8221; </p>

			<p>I personally REFUSE to donate anything to any charity. Because I am afraid some of my donation might possibly help Blacks. Something I am totally against. I urge ALL AmRen readers to rethink their personal giving policy and follow suit. You can help people on a one-on-one basis and KNOW whom you&rsquo;re helping. Invite the charities to &#8220;pound sand&#8221; when they come begging for donations at your door.</p>

<p>Black has a long history of stopping white people from taking advantage of science&rsquo;s gifts.  It is because blacks hate white people.</p>
<p>Years ago the phone company came out with caller ID.  I had three daughters and wife all of whom answered the phone.  Not a few times after answering their jaws would drop, eyes bug out and they would freeze.  It was an obscene phone call.  This happened far too often.  Caller ID came out.  It would put a stop to these perverts.</p>
<p>The blacks and only the blacks led by Jesse Jackson held up caller ID for years, because they said that with the ID a company would exclude blacks in their selling campaigns.  He claimed, probably rightly so, that businessmen who wanted to avoid the trouble that blacks cause would note the black area code and not answer the call.  So I couldn&rsquo;t stop one set of perverts, because another set of perverts called the shot in Congress.</p>
<p>Another instance of blacks using their power to harm white people occurred when the head black councilman in Cleveland held up cable TV for years until the cable company satisfied him with some cash and Affirmative Action payoffs.</p>
<p>These example of blacks&rsquo; envy and hatred of whites, note blacks also were denied the benefits, are only inconveniences.  Preventing whites from obtaining the life saving benefits of science is a grave moral offense.</p>
<p>When a group of people, the blacks, complain that some one is hurting them, (a person with white skin), you can be sure they are going to go out of their way to hurt that some one.</p>

			<blockquote>Pressed for his position on apologizing to blacks or offering reparations, Obama said he was more interested in taking action to help people struggling to get by.

<p>Obama has some funny ideas about who&rsquo;s avoiding hard work.</p>

Then we could rap about how the debt he imagines &#8220;we&#8221; owe blacks has been paid, and actually amounts to a debt owed by the (black) recipient class to the (white) taxpaying class.</p>

			<p>After reading this article, I have a question for anyone with a decent understanding of the law: I&rsquo;m an organ donor now, but I would like to change that. Then I want to specify in a legal document that when I die, I want my organs donated to whites only. Would that be allowed or not? I have a feeling it&rsquo;s not, but I figure there&rsquo;s no harm in asking.</p>

This kind of mentality actually could lead to reparations.  Even if it doesn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s a dangerous one by itself.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re to do &#8220;race-neutral&#8221; things that just happen to benefit in a disparate sense those that would benefit from reparations, they&rsquo;re almost reparations in and of themselves.  However, there are many things that could fit this definition.  </p>
<p>For instance, repealing laws against violent felonies would be &#8220;race-neutral,&#8221; but it would &#8220;help the same people that stand to benefit from reparations.&#8221;  Do we want to do that?</p>
<p>Besides, because the U.S. House has apologized for slavery and acknowledged it as an official wrong with the U.S. House has some culpability over, one could say that we need reparations for the descendants of slaves.  And that would &#8220;help the same people that stand to benefit from reparations.&#8221;</p>
<p>You would do well to think affirmative action or racial pandering when you hear &#8220;disparate impact.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Organ donors are almost always white, while the recipient rate is not exclusively white. Blacks receive white donated organs all the time, since so few of their own are willing to donate. They aren&rsquo;t even generous enough to tip in a restaurant, so they aren&rsquo;t goint to give an organ they have no use for, nor will they donate marrow while still living. They are a selfish lot, always have been. And now whites in need are being punished, because there won&rsquo;t be enough blacks around to receieve any donations, even though the risk of rejection is high.</p>

<p>Remove your name from any and all organ donation/bone marrow transplant lists.  Make your wishes known and clear to your next of kin.  Tell them you will not donate any of their organs if you find yourself in such a position.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t forget to tell them why. </p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to tell a transplant committee why I will not donate my loved ones&rsquo; organs  &mdash;  I don&rsquo;t believe in AA, at the expense of Whites, for ANY reason, including organ donations.  There is plenty of documentation on this site about blatant discrimination against Whites when it comes to medical care, especially organ donations.</p>

<p>We could do this, but it would be required &#8220;by law&#8221; that an equitable amount of the money be donated to minorities. Only minorities are allowed to have programs exclusively for their own race. </p>

That is exactly the same at the place where I have given blood.  </p>
<p>However, many blacks (who may want to donate) can not pass the screening, due to their promiscuous lifestyles, drug use, etc.  I know of two black women where I work who wanted to donate (because they were getting paid for it) but they were rejected.  One of them was married to an African (who probably had AIDS), that ruled her out. The other one has had too many &#8220;boyfriends&#8221;.</p>

The mention of Stephen Girard brings up an interesting case.  It&rsquo;s another point relevant to Amren: the most able who often die childless.</p>
<p>He was a man of extraordinary abilities.  Born in France, he lost his right eye at the age of eight. He lost his mother at 11.  He went to sea at age 13.   (His grandfather had gone to sea at the age of ten!)    By 23, he was a ship&rsquo;s captain traveling to the West Indies and America.  At 26, he settled in Philadelphia and became a wealthy merchant and banker, possessing a large fleet of vessels engaged in worldwide commerce. He was involved in the creation of the Bank of the United States, and the Girard Bank.  He financed the U.S. government in the War of 1812.  His innate business intelligence made him the foremost business titan of his time and the richest citizen of America at his death. He was known for his many civic and charitable works. He has been rated, given adjustments for the time frame, as the fourth wealthiest American of all time.  In his will, he provided generously for his slave, Hannah. He left most of his fortune to charitable causes, a good part of it to found a school for <i> &#8220;poor, white, male orphans.&#8221;  </i>  In 1968, that part of his will was voided as contrary to the public interest.</p>
<p>Despite all his abilities and  his &#8220;success&#8221;,  <b><i>he died childless.  </i></b></p>
<p><br>
 [<i>Stephen Girard, in his will, allocated millions to build and operate a boarding school for &#8220;poor, white, male orphans.&#8221; That legacy was carried out as he willed it for one hundred and twenty years.  The will was amended in 1968 by order of the Supreme Court of the United States to strike the &#8220;poor, white, male orphan&#8221; provision so as to include the underprivileged without regard to race, creed or color. It was later amended a second time to allow for the admission of females. </i>]</p>
<p>Oh, incidentally, in a number of sources (such as Wikipedia) which I checked, there is no mention at all of this incident.  It&rsquo;s become hard to find!  It&rsquo;s as if it never happened!  Or that it is of no interest and not worth mentioning.</p>

			<p>On the Stephen Girard case, I did a little internet research, and found out that the ignoble Warren Court took it upon themselves to modify the &#8220;poor white male&#8221; part of Girard&rsquo;s will.  This is really a frightening precedent.  Does this mean that any given court can change your will at its own will?  Or does it mean that everybody&rsquo;s estate automatically is transferred to the NAACP, MALDEF and the SPLC?</p>

			<p>My wife was at a fundraiser saturday night. Rural small town in the midwest. Rock band playing for charity, admission and a canned food item, all went to the local food pantry. She mentioned to me that she really enjoyed herself, won something in the raffles, and didnt worry about our teenage son wandering about with his female friend until well after midnight when it broke up. There was no danger, just a bunch of white farm kids dancing at what was the only excitement in town that night. </p>
<p>  What she also noticed was that EVERY person there was white, and as such, she was even more pleased to be there. The food pantry helps out in that town, and judging from the demographics of the town, helps whites out a good deal. If I can choose whom to help, it will be my own people. If the africans can do it, so can I. </p>

<p>And trust me these people who did this have angry grins and dead eyes. And this is what they really mean by &#8220;Minnesota Nice.&#8221; And the people who say it are the ones who have already left.</p>

<p>Oh, and if I specified that I wanted my organs to go to whites only, I bet they&rsquo;d be purposely donated to a black felon.</p>
