						<p>Although polygamy is banned in the Netherlands, the marriages of Muslims who have several wives are recognised by Dutch authorities.</p>
<p>Registrars in the major cities, in particular, record dozens of bigamous or polygamous marriages per year. These marriages are prohibited and an offence in the Netherlands. However, polygamous marriages that take place in countries where more than one wife is permitted, such as Morocco, are accepted, newspaper NRC Handelsblad reports.</p>
<p>If immigrants with several wives settle in the Netherlands, the local authorities register all the marriages. However, the Central Bureau for Statistics (CBS), where all marriages are registered nationally, removes these bigamous or polygamous marriages from its files, on the assumption that administrative errors have occurred. As a result, it is not known how common the phenomenon is in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Amsterdam city council has informed the CBS that the marriages are not a mistake. &#8220;We will now investigate whether this can be regarded as a trend that was previously not recognised. If this is the case, it is out task to report this,&#8221; CBS researcher Jan Latten explained in NRC Handelsblad.</p>
<p>&#8220;At present, it is not included in our statistics,&#8221; Latten pointed out. &#8220;In the same way, we delete marriages involving fourteen-year-olds. A man with two wives just cannot exist by law.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spokesman T. Verhoeven of the Rotterdam city council disclosed that polygamous marriages are registered almost every week. &#8220;They are simply acknowledged. It is important for us to check that the documents are authentic and that the husband does not have Dutch nationality.&#8221; Otherwise the construction is illegal, Verhoeven explained.</p>
<p>In Amsterdam, local government employees must inform the Public Prosecutors&rsquo; Office (OM) if there is any suspicion of marriages of convenience or exploitation of women. But this has never happened, a spokeswoman revealed. In Rotterdam, too, the registration of bigamous or polygamous marriages is &#8220;practically never&#8221; refused, Verhoeven observed.<br>

			<p>Warren Jeffs of the Ladder Day Saint (Mormon) religion is depicted as a child moleter and basically evil person. If he only was willing to renounce his Mormon religion and adopt Islam he would be made a regious martyr by Katie Couric.</p>

			<p>The real issue is not polygamy.  It is the presence of non-Dutch in Holland.  As a modern European state, Holland will gladly give welfare to single mothers impregnated by the same single irresponsible man.  At least the muslim polygamist acknowledges some responsibility for himself and his family. </p>

			<p>Same thing goes on in the United States.  Many Muslim or Morman &#8220;wives&#8221; are legally single so they qualify for and often receive welfare.  </p>

The Dutch need to assert their authority and say, &#8220;Look, Ahmed, we don&rsquo;t CARE how you did things where you come from. If you want to live here, pick ONE wife and lose the rest. Don&rsquo;t like it? Then SCRAM!&#8221; </p>
<p>This would solve not only the polygamy problem, but would also go some distance toward improving ALL Muslim behavior in their country. <br>

<p>When I first heard that the Mormons who practice polygamy receive welfare, I was quite angry. After thinking it over I&rsquo;ve changed my mind. Think of all the money the Whites pay out through taxes to take care of  Blacks, Mexicans, Bantus, Somalis, Pakistanis, etc., etc., etc.. At least the Mormons are White.  <br>

			<p>To Flamethrower: Kudos. I remember the same remark on chronicles magazine by an individual who said &#8216;Better to be the third wife of a good Muslim than be a &#8220;playa&rsquo;s hoe&#8221; etc.&rsquo;</p>

			<p>Actually a pretty good setup for Muslims with multiple wives emigrating to Europe. You are then allowed to sign up all your wives for welfare that way. Who can imagine a sweeter deal than that? Ahhh, isn&rsquo;t the West a great place to live? Have to go to the mosque now. Don&rsquo;t want to miss the sermon about the evils of the society we live in!</p>

<p>I know and this needs to stop. If these men want all of these &#8220;wives&#8221; and children, then let the man support them, NOT his fellow taxpayers. I can guarantee you, both these muslims and mormon men wouldn&rsquo;t be so gung ho for this if they had to work 3 jobs to support them and still live in abject poverty.</p>

			<p>It never ceases to amaze me how once proudly &#8220;progressive&#8221; Europe(often missing no opportunity to thumb her nose at backward America) continues to backslide into nowhere, all in the name of their blessed, non-white Muslim immigrants. What would have been loudly condemned if practiced by Whites is embraced, perhaps even encouraged as multicultural &#8220;enrichment&#8221; by the non-white invaders.     </p>

			<p>In the first place Mormons (LDS)haven&rsquo;t practiced polygamy since 1890. Anyone who does gets excommunicated. So anyone who does is not a Mormon, at least not for very long.  Warren Jeffs has no connection with the Latter Day Saints (LDS) Mormons.  If you really knew what you are talking about you would know this.  Unfortunately when you are talking about Muslim polygamy you are correct. I have never understand why we tolerate Muslim unique practices in the U.S. or in Europe. We must have a deathwish or something.</p>

<p>This is bad. The West is just running up the flag of surrender against expansionist Islam. When we go to their countries, we have to obey their laws, and if we don&rsquo;t, we go to jail. Same with these selfish Muslims in the West.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an excellent feminist argument that polygamy is just a male scam to get lots of women. Arguably it&rsquo;s just bad news for women all the way around. In an equal society, I guess you could allow polyandry, but most women feel one husband is almost too much right there. Plus, polygamy leaves lots of guys with no women, and that&rsquo;s messed up right there. </p>
<p>I never understood the appeal, other than getting to have free sex with different women all the time. I would think one wife would be a Helluva handful right there. My God, could you imagine having *more than one wife*? Shudder.</p>

			<p>The Mormons in the US don&rsquo;t use welfare to support their families.  Do you think they bought that massive compound with food stamps?  Only the successful ones who are able to support multiple wives and their children, generally men who own businesses, actually engage in polygamy. </p>

<p>While their welfare state does dole out money to irresponsible people, at least when they give it to Dutch single mothers impregnated by irresponsible Dutch men, they are Dutch and that has how they as Dutch people have decided they want THEIR society. These muslims are NOT Dutch, they are hostile aliens, and by allowing polygamy now, they are  changing their society to placate these aliens.<br>

			<p>   Strange, the Mormons in the United States are persecuted for polygamy but not the Muslims in Holland? Maybe the polygamist Mormons should move to Holland  &mdash;  oh, I forgot their normally white. I doubt the Dutch would accept them. </p>

<p>Hahaha that belongs on Comedy Central. No marriage, multiple wives or single wife brings free sex. There is always a bottom line, only the blank needs to be filled in. I personally like being married, but let us no suggest it is free, it IS fun, but not free.</p>

			<p>My aunt worked in social services while she was naive enough to think that she could help those people coming to her.  She gave up in disgust when she realized that many of them did not want to be helped.  They just wanted to be taken care of.  There is a difference.</p>
<p>The black population was small in her state, but she did deal with some &#8220;married&#8221; &#8220;Mormon&#8221; women who were legally single.  She really felt that they were a weak link in the white population whose own children would probably grow up and have more welfare babies with some loser &#8220;husband&#8221; who was going to eat at the family table but never put much there himself.</p>
<p>Blacks in my father&rsquo;s home state are pulling the same sort of nonsense.  My father&rsquo;s family is mostly in Minnesota, and there are a bunch of black Muslim &#8220;refugees&#8221; from Africa there.  The women who can&rsquo;t provide for their children are having more with men who are mooching off of the mothers&rsquo; AFDC checks.  </p>

			<p>This is very bad news for the Netherlands, but in the UK, where the tax and benefits system has recognised Muslim polygamy for some time (with absolutely no public discussion initiated by our lawmakers, and therefore great unawareness on the part of the general public), this is - alas! - OLD news.</p>

			<p>I support healthy Whites with good genes having very large White families. I don&rsquo;t have any problem with what Warren Jeffs of his fundamenalist Ladder Day Saints did/do. These White families work hard in agriculture, the children don&rsquo;t join gangs and nobody watches violent video games, lying anti White TV shows produced by any of Summer Redstone&rsquo;s vile networks.</p>
<p>If most Muslims were bright, healthy White Indo Europeans, I wouldn&rsquo;t have a problem with their marriage systems - anything has to be better than the California divorce/enslave the man system we have here. The biggest problem with the Muslims is that 99% of them are not White and the religion will take anyone including the lowest, most violent, hostile non Whites. Islam accepted Mike Tyson. That shows you what we are up against.</p>
<p>I also support healthy White women having children outside of the traditional two parent 1950s norm - that norm is not posible for most Whites now. A single career White woman can have a child or two later in life and her parents, the children&rsquo;s grandparents are happy to help out, the women can even move back with their parents.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be flexible and look at other (White) cultures including socialist cultures, communal societies. The straight, White, Conservative, GOP, suburban America is not making it any more, but that is no reason for our race and culture to die.</p>

As David Reed said, above, Mormons gave up polygamy in 1890.  Those who do practice it aren&rsquo;t Mormons. </p>
<p>Aside from whether this practice exists among Mormons, but addressing those cults or religions which do practice it, just look at your sentence.  OF COURSE  they are legally single!  What else?  This is not a matter of choice. There is no way they can legally be married.  </p>

<p>I do. It is very wrong for grown men to have sex with underage girls such as he and his followers did. They&rsquo;re a bunch of old peverts and Jeffs is in jail where he belongs. It is wrong for young girls to be forced into &#8220;marriage&#8221; against their will. I also feel polygamy is wrong and it&rsquo;s also against the law as it should be. Polygamy is harmful to the family and to children.</p>

			<p>Robert Lindsay raises an issue that&rsquo;s often ignored. He points out that polgyny (one man with more than one wife)&#8221;&hellip;leaves lots of guys with no women, and that&rsquo;s messed up right there.&#8221; In these cultures, do they run off the excess boys or men? Presuming you the male population hasn&rsquo;t died off, why would you want to unbalance things? Why leave anyone without a partner?</p>

			<p>Frankly, if a man can support all those wives, and all their children, I don&rsquo;t have a problem with it. </p>
<p>That, however, is almost never the case. </p>
<p>If, on the other hand, they&rsquo;re being supported at taxpayer expense   &mdash;   at MY expense   &mdash;   then I have a HUGE problem.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m basically supporting the children of men who &#8216;play the field&rsquo; and impregnate lots of women. This disgusts me. </p>
