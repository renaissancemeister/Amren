						<p><i>NAM Editor&rsquo;s Note: A Mexican government official called on Mexican workers in the United States to send more money home, but Mexican migrants did not respond favorably. Gardenia Mendoza Aguilar reports from Mexico City and Eileen Truax from Los Angeles for La Opini√≥n.</i></p>
<p>Remittances to Mexico are down and people like Rosalinda Ortiz, who depend on money sent from the United States, are feeling the impact on their wallets. Ortiz&rsquo;s husband, an undocumented immigrant who worked as a bricklayer in Wisconsin, stopped sending her money six months ago when he lost his job. Since then, he has traveled to various states in search of work: Illinois, Nevada, and even Texas, where he considered crossing the border back to Mexico.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Most families that depend on remittances spend the money on food, medicine and their children&rsquo;s education. They can&rsquo;t afford to put money into savings toward building their own homes or other expenses.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the Bank of Mexico, 12.6 percent of the families residing in Mexico&rsquo;s municipalities receive money from the United States. Remittances are the second largest source of income for Mexico, behind oil exports.</p>
<p>In 2007, remittances flowing into Mexico reached a high of $23.98 billion, but the Bank of Mexico estimates that they declined by 2.2 percent in the first half of this year.</p>
<p>Additionally, an estimated 100,000 Mexicans have returned to their home communities so far this year as a result of their perilous economic and social situation in the United States, which may begin with the loss of a job, and end in detainment and deportation.</p>
<p><b>The Mexican Government Intervenes</b></p>
<p>The drop in remittances to Mexico has prompted Mexican Secretary of the Interior Juan Camilo Mourino to urge Mexican nationals in the United States to keep sending money and invest in their home country.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Yet he said that the Mexican government has taken steps to prepare for the crisis, including tax incentives in marginalized communities, increased public spending and temporary employment programs for returning migrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>U.S. Mexicans Respond</b></p>
<p>But Mexican nationals in the United States did not react favorably to Mourino&rsquo;s call to action.</p>
<p>While they are willing to support their home country, migrants say they expect the same from their government.</p>
<p>One day laborer expressed his frustration with Mourino&rsquo;s speech, saying, &#8220;He wants us to send more money? Well get us more jobs.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Efrain Jimenez says that it is good that the Mexican government recognizes that migrants can be part of the solution and Mexico&rsquo;s economic development, but added these words need to be followed by action, and the Mexican government needs to be consistent in its policy towards migrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We want the United States to recognize our matricula consulares as our official IDs, but they don&rsquo;t in Mexico,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There is no consistency. They want migrants to invest in Mexico, but we can&rsquo;t get a legal ID.&#8221;</p>

<p>The future of Mexican children is not my problem. Period. National borders are the limit of my habitation, influence, and charity.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;Remittances are the second largest source of income for Mexico, behind oil exports.&#8221;</p>
<p>That should read, &#8220;behind oil exports and drug money.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mexico encouraged large families for years, but never had the foresight to see that there was work for all the peons.  It&rsquo;s just one more example of a third world government that has third world mentalities, expecting other countries to take in their starving hordes because they&rsquo;re too incompetent to feed them.</p>
<p>The should turn the country over to Europeans, Chinese or Japanese.  Only in that way could the country be a thriving civilization.  </p>
<p>That will never happen, of course, so the country will be forever sending people to the US looking for food and things to steal.<br>

			<p>&#8220;Remittances are the second largest source of income for Mexico, behind oil exports.&#8221;  &mdash;  Please allow me to present one factual correction. </p>
<p>Narco production/narco conversion/transnational narco trafficking squarely places remittances as at most the number three generator of income for Mexico. And when you isolate from the so called &#8220;remittances&#8221; that portion of same which constitutes retail scale narco money laundering operations, remittances from labor based income collected in the U.S. by Mexicans tend to drop to maybe fifth or sixth place. Exports of tainted food products might well exceed remittances generated from labor by Mexicans in the U.S.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve come up with a new motto. Next time a rally is in my area, I want to carry this sign:</p>
<p>GO HOME AND FIGHT FOR YOUR OWN COUNTRY. <br>
I&rsquo;M FIGHTING FOR MINE.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it ironic how many illegal aliens will defiantly stand in the streets, going to the mat for &#8220;their rights&#8221; - but yet refuse to take such action in their own country, against their own government?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to close the cafeteria.</p>

			<p>Mexico is one of the most deeply corrupt nations on this earth and it is astounding that so many Americans allow their children to vacation and goof off there. It says alot about the state of the American parent&rsquo;s mentality.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve been to Mexico more than once on business. Yes, it&rsquo;s corrupt. One time I was taking some family planning devices for a clinical trial and had all the paperwork in order, but I still had to pay the &#8220;mordida&#8221; (the bribe.) It wasn&rsquo;t unusual for our Mexican doctors to submit claims for the &#8220;mordida&#8221; on their way back if they were taking study product with them. Of course, they had no receipt. The company just paid them, just as they paid my claim.  </p>

			<p>Force the undocumented workers back across the southern border; give them TEC-9s, 300-rds of 9mm ammo, and a map to get back to Mexico City right before they cross. It would serve the Mexican government right to have their mayhem exported back to them.</p>
