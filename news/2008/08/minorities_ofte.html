						<p>Foreshadowing the nation&rsquo;s changing makeup, one in four American counties have passed or are approaching the tipping point where black, Hispanic and Asian children constitute a majority of the under-20 population, according to analyses of census figures released Thursday.</p>
<p>Racial and ethnic minorities now account for 43 percent of Americans under 20. Among people of all ages, minorities make up at least 40 percent of the population in more than one in six of the nation&rsquo;s 3,141 counties.</p>

			<p>Americans can hardly win this &#8220;birth-race&#8221;.</p>
<p>If you cannot compete, then drop out of this race.</p>
<p>The best thing would be to concentrate in a few states (by moving there) and then secede.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like the point I was making for a few years now. How can Asians and Mexicans, for example be considered minorities, when they so outnumber whites in many areas. When will the day come that &#8220;equalization&#8221; arrives, and whites become a &#8220;protected group&#8221;, also?</p>

			<p>Racial thinking among whites might be taboo now, but wait until a generation passes and those under 20s are in their 40s.  Imagine how openly and overtly racial the white body politic will be.</p>

			<p>We are slowly going to be overwhelmed.  There is no future for White Americans.  Everywhere one looks you see the rot.  It will be just a matter of time before they will have the numbers to dictate to us outright.</p>
<p>It all seems so pointless and hopeless.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s bad, but consider that some of the time, these ethnic groups will be fighting each other. AND alot of them will be gangbangers, who have no political outlet. They need to be locked into their cities though. White flight will keep white homogeneity together for a while longer, but the future is third world, crime ridden hellhole, unless your able to afford to move out of these areas.</p>
<p>But as White population has peaked, these people must also peak in population, as there is no growth in the economy with blacks and hispanics.</p>

			<p>There&rsquo;s a rule of thumb emerging in Western countries:</p>
<p>The older a person is, the odds are they&rsquo;re white. The younger they are, the odds are they&rsquo;re not.</p>

			<p>More than 10% of the counties in the US are in just two states  &mdash;   Texas and Georgia  &mdash;   and many of those have always had &#8220;minority majorities&#8221;.  So this statistic is a bit misleading.</p>
<p>What flummoxes me is that whites are moving into the same states, and often same counties, as the blacks and non-white immigrants.  When are they going to wise up and move back to the Rust Belt?</p>
<p>Baron Rotschild was right.  Now is the time to buy up land in Detroit.  &#8220;Re-blanching&#8221; it could make you a billionaire.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Racial and ethnic minorities now account for 43 percent of Americans under 20.&#8221;</p>
<p>I honestly have the greatest sympathy (and also the deepest hope) for the white 20 and under demographic; my sympathy lies with them, in what will likely be their brutal (and what should have been a largely unnecessary) struggle in the future, while my hope is to be found in my belief that they will be up to the challenge. These young people are the future of our race, and they have the right to claim to be the most abused and betrayed generation of Americans ever to have populated this country. They will actually have to live in a &#8220;diverse&#8221; country without a white majority, but infiltrated by an ever growing smorgasbord &#8220;majority&#8221; of bitter and squabbling nonwhites who hold that the American Dream is to be found in handouts or &#8220;equitable&#8221; representation for themselves. </p>
<p>The full article hints at this, when the author Comrade Roberts notes that:</p>
<p>&#8220;The latest population changes by race, ethnicity and age, as of July 1, 2007, were generally marginal compared with the year before. But they confirm the breadth of the nation&rsquo;s diversity, and suggest that minorities  &mdash;  now about a third of the population  &mdash;  might constitute a majority of all Americans even sooner than projected by census demographers, in 2050.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh really Comrade Roberts, you and your kind have just observed this possibility?</p>
<p>And here is to be found my truest sympathy with these wonderful and betrayed young whites, the outright idiocy of the fools that came before them. Their &#8220;insightfully&#8221; altruistic elders, who have had such comfort and security that they felt tossing it to the abjectly undeserving and incongruent was a &#8220;noble&#8221; undertaking.</p>
<p>And when I describe my hope for them and their ability to confront the great mistake of multiculturalism, it is that they so thoroughly correct it and its authors that remain, that it is as if that mistake never was!</p>
<p>If not, God help them all!!!<br>

			<p>At some point, that i doubt i&rsquo;ll live to see, (i&rsquo;m 60), this nation will have to reconsider its organization as a federation of allegedly sovereign states, but which has become a centralized dictatorship that deliberately allowed millions of immigrants to arrive without any loyalty to Western values or law.  These immigrants can and will be bought off by socialists who run our government in coaltion with media monopolies and corporate speculators on Wall St and in London.  </p>
<p>Hopefully, my children or grandchildren will join with the remnanants of traditional America and secede. I have no illusion that the parsitic hordes who live off govt benefits and jobs will try to prevent ethnic partition.</p>
<p>By God, they can have LA, Detroit, Memphis, and New York City. Just let us have some arable land, access to international markets, and leave us the hell ALONE!</p>
<p>The UNITED States of America is dying. It had a good run for a while. But like the history of our seas and continents, change is inevitable, and this country needs to become partitioned. It should have been done in South Africa and Zimbabwe.  Let the fate of civilization in those formerly decent, civilized nations be a warning for Americans. Americans. You know who I mean. </p>

			<p>That&rsquo;s simply because they breed like rats for the welfare check. When the parent starts footing the bill their incessant breeding will slow down. Which brings us to another problem. Bags! These kids that run the streets all hours of the day and night murdering, being murdered and pillaging. They mostly have no father, the mothers only interest in their many children is the welfare check. Basically they are left to their own means to survive. Hence their propensity for criminal behaviors because there are no role positive role models. Only jailbird parents and gangsta rappers for guidance. Of course this will be viewed as racist talk but then I have no respect for people that only blame and assume no responsibility for their actions. Therefore, I give less than a rats rump what they think.</p>

			<p>The federal government, large corporations, and special interests finally got what they wanted: A dysgenic, third world USA. Way to go, they finally succeeded in destroying a once great country!</p>
<p>At this point I have little faith that there will be a renaissance favoring the Euro-American majority. Our &#8220;leaders&#8221; in Washington DC (and the corporate and special interests who pay them off) are so far gone in their corruption that they&rsquo;re unreachable. They REALLY don&rsquo;t care. </p>
<p>Ten years ago I acquired dual citizenship with an EU country that one of my parents was born in. I just recently renewed my EU passport at the consulate (my U.S. passport is still good for a few more years). I plan to leave the U.S. because although there&rsquo;s been a small (tiny) minority of resistance here at AR and other related sites, the larger white population is clueless and passive. I don&rsquo;t think it just APPEARS to be hopeless. It IS hopeless!</p>
<p>Leaving the U.S. is increasing as a trend. Just google: A Growing Trend of Leaving America. You will be taken to a July 28, 2008 article from US News and World Report. The article itself is watered down, but look at the Reader Comments where the readers give replies that get down to the real reasons why so many people are dissatisfied, disgusted, and fed up with what our country has become. </p>
<p>There was one person by the name of &#8220;nygrump&#8221; who said &#8220;Cowards flee&hellip;if you really believed in the American Constitution and democracy you&rsquo;d stay here and fight for it&hellip;.&#8221; Another person replied by saying &#8220;Nothing left to protect&hellip;you can say &#8216;cowards flee&rsquo; all you like, but when the PRESIDENT calls the Constitution a &#8216;goddamn piece of paper&rsquo;, you know you&rsquo;re in trouble&hellip;this country has been stolen by bad people and the masses who prop them up are way too ignorant and lazy to do anything about it. One can not just reverse course of a raging train wreck, one either jumps from the train or hangs on and hopes not to die in the crash. I once hoped to hang on, then the powers that be started stealing elections and the masses slept. The train is picking up speed, not slowing down. Time to jump before you get shackled to the caboose.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thank you. I couldn&rsquo;t have said it better.</p>
<p>Amazon.com is selling books with titles like &#8220;Getting Out: Your Guide to Leaving America&#8221; and &#8220;Leaving America: The New Expatriate Generation&#8221; and other related books that will appear when you look at said titles on Amazon. </p>
<p>You can talk all you want about staying and fighting and so-called democracy, but let&rsquo;s face it, unless you have the power and money of a Rockefeller or Soros, you are strapped down in the seat of a train over which you have no control. A roller coaster ride horror into an increasingly authoritarian, third-world Police State America. Oh, and anti-racist training will be mandatory for your children. With the exception of the UK and France, I think if there&rsquo;s going to be any worthwile success in stopping all of this, it&rsquo;s most likely to come from various European countries whose citizens are far less propagandized than the citizens of the USA, and are therefore more outspoken and more willing to take action.  </p>

			<p>I think it&rsquo;s a testament to the birth rates of white American women that minorities aren&rsquo;t a majority of births or people under 20 nationwide. White American women have a total fertility rate of 1.8-1.9 children per woman. If it was 1.5 like in Canada or Europe, we&rsquo;d be in much worse trouble!</p>

			<p>In less than 40 years a nation built over centuries by one people has been given to another. If you shed a tear when the Titanic went down in Cameron&rsquo;s film, recognize that the Titanic is allegory for our own catastrophic age. Our age is that of the end of America, Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, The Netherlands, Belgium, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and any other nation you can name in the West. We live among the toppling ruins built of greater men in better times.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t there anything mighty or noble left in us? After all the millennia the West led the Human race, how can we end in such a manner? Like men, won&rsquo;t we stand up and leave a mark on history, fight with passion, go to the flames as we always have when down, with a lionlike ferocity?</p>
<p>But there won&rsquo;t be any history when we&rsquo;re gone.</p>
<p>Asians are too placid; they wouldn&rsquo;t understand the passion which governs the Western mind. Any history they write of us would be of our illogical mistakes, coolly anaylized. They&rsquo;d see the battle but never hear the battle hymn. They&rsquo;d see a rose and turn away because of the thorns.</p>
<p>Arabic Muslims will continue to imagine themselves as their historical caricature, as wrapped in glowing white raiments, as being logical demi-humans charged with educating the wayward infidels, as inhabiting a world of sterile cleanliness. Of coarse in actuality, they will remain themselves, dirty in all aspects, illogical and uneducated, and failing to even maintain (let alone improve) the once glorious institutions of the West. Any history held by these people will be a sort of daydream. If we factor in their history at all, (and postmortem), we&rsquo;ll be a tool for building up their victories. Our Crusaders will be great and powerful, but only so far as their Mamluks are more powerful still. With the Arabic peoples, history is a tool for Alah, and Alah can&rsquo;t handle the truth.</p>
<p>Hispanics, the inheritors of North America, won&rsquo;t care. Hispanics look neither behind or ahead. Much like the Black genes they carry, they prefer not to hear about it. They&rsquo;ll be too busy minding their caste system, based of the occasional diluted White genes which pop up in their gene pool from time to time.</p>
<p>Africans wouldn&rsquo;t know history if someone else wrote it for them (as is currently being done). If Hispanics think of neither the past or the future, Blacks don&rsquo;t even think of the present.</p>
<p>With our demise, history will be at a end. What a wretched group of inheritors we&rsquo;ve entailed the world upon.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a man who curses often, but I will at present, and I mean this in the most literal sense; may God damn the people who did this to us! God damn them strait to hell! I trust in Him. I trust in His justice.</p>

			<p>Too many White women are having bi-racial children.  Also some White men are doing the same. Are the offspring of miscegnation considered White? This fact alone brings down our numbers considerably.</p>

			<p>Most white women are too selfish and stuckup to want a white man to have children.  Instead, they play games, have sex for fun (as do most men today), and are more focused on careers than being mothers.  If a white girl does date, chances are she wants a loser bad-boy type or a non-white male.  Are there no more real, decent, strong-willed white men?  Or did they end with my grandfathers&rsquo; generation?</p>

			<p>I relocated to Europe for the same reason &#8220;packing my bags&#8221; intends to. I wont downplay the pleasures of living in an almost all-white society. They definitely exist. My stress levels have gone down, but that has other causes as well.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m left with a feeling of having abandoned my real culture, and honestly, having abandoned my people when they were facing hard times. You&rsquo;ll always realize, when soccer matches come, that you dont belong where you&rsquo;re at. Even if your ancestors came from where the land you moved to, it doesnt matter. It really doesnt matter, you&rsquo;ll realize soon enough how American you are, as you discuss for the 500th time why you relocated and where you&rsquo;re from. Good luck with discussing that one topic for the rest of your life, and good luck learning whatever language will take you years to master, and you&rsquo;ll never feel as free while speaking it.</p>
<p>You can congratulate yourself on having secured a relatively (?) stable future for your children and yourself, but you DID leave your people behind. Thats fair enough. I dont think its an act of cowardice per se, but it strikes me as directly similar to those who duck and bow to multiculturalism. Why do they do it? To avoid pain and confrontation. If you have roots in America and you leave, you do it for the same reason, to avoid pain and confrontation. </p>
<p>I wish everyone who goes this path, i.e. leaving America, the best. But please spare us the doomsday portrait of you getting off a hopelessly lost sinking ship, doing the only reasonable thing, the thing any sensible person would be compelled to do, a thing you were absolutely compelled to do by the severity of circumstances. If only out of respect for the morale of the people you are abandoning. Somebody has to make a stand, and the potential for catastrophic loss is there, but thats the precise definition of a hero: someone who perceives the danger, and thinking of family, goes and does it anyway.  </p>
<p>In short, please voice your opinions with the morale of your fellow Americans in mind. We dont need any more contempt poured out on us or our situation.</p>

			<p>I wonder what percentage of whites know or even if they know,care they will soon become a minority in the US. Maybe it&rsquo;s a combination of the MSM, and schools being so anti-white that most whites are brainwashed into thinking being white is something to be ashamed of. I also believe in addition to being brainwashed, the lack of intelligence of many whites contributes to this. Whites that frequent this website had the insight to ignore the brainwashing and recognize what the reality is.How can the totally unqualified racist Obama be leading by as much as 15 points in 3 totally white states: NH, Maine, and Vermont. Several months ago, I briefly worked in an area of New York State that is essentially 100% white. My &#8220;co-workers&#8221; were all going to vote for Obama. When they would explain why, they sounded so stupid, I realized why the founding fathers established the electoral college. The Founding Fathers felt the need to establish an electoral college even though only male whites who owned property and had a certain amount of education could vote. They clearly didn&rsquo;t underestimate the stupidity of a large percentage of white people. I believe it&rsquo;s mainly the indoctrination of whites to hate themselves that accounts for the apathy of whites to their becoming a minority.  </p>

<p>Our only hope, at this 11th hour, is that the impending US economic meltdown causes an anti immigration (legal and illegal) backlash! </p>
<p>If history is any guide, this will indeed be the case.</p>

			<p>&#8220;White American women have a total fertility rate of 1.8-1.9 children per woman.&#8221;<br>
-Posted by Brendan at 8:56 PM on August 7</p>
<p><br>
That&rsquo;s still below replacement level. </p>
<p>And the perplexing thing is, the US Census counts people from North Africa and the middle east as &#8220;non-Hispanic White&#8221;.</p>
<p>Take a drive through rural American counties and you&rsquo;ll notice an increasing percentage of them do not match their official Census population estimates. <br>
I&rsquo;ve recently been through several counties that, according to 2006 Census estimates (the most recent) are suppose to be around 97% White, yet what I actually saw was areas closer to 60% White.</p>
<p>Immigration, legal and illegal has increased a hundred fold in the past eight years, and seems to be increasing with each passing month.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d guess that America is only 55% White as of 2008. And many of those are elderly or those choosing to remain childless. </p>
<p>2050 is 42 years away!</p>
<p>By then, if current trends continue, (and there is no reason to think they won&rsquo;t) America will most likely be around 18% to 28%  White.</p>

			<p>It will either take a revolution (like the French Revolution) or a civil war   &mdash;   between Whites and non-Whites to right the wrong! Fleeing the country being hardly a viable answer. Every once pure white nation is being flooded with non-White third-world immigrants. Bringing with them their incessant demands for hand-outs, insatiable appetite for crime and tendency to trash their homes and neighborhoods creating slums everywhere.</p>

&#8220;White American women have a total fertility rate of 1.8-1.9 children per woman. If it was 1.5 like in Canada or Europe, we&rsquo;d be in much worse trouble!&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take a look at the glass half-empty then as that&rsquo;s still<br>
below the 2.1 rate needed to simply MAINTAIN the White population. It also doesn&rsquo;t take into consideration what percent OF the 1.8-1.9 rate for White women are mulattos. From what I&rsquo;ve seen over the past 10-20 years, that probably reduces that rate by another 10-20% or so.</p>
<p>Where I work, there are eight White women in my department. The only one that has any children is the secretary. She is in her upper 50&rsquo;s and has one child in college. The other women, all combined, have ZERO children. They are all between the ages of 28 and 44. Sadly, this is not an atypical situation anymore. All but one has one or more dogs. I guess dogs have taken the place of White babies for them. This is not how it was meant to be. Something has gone terribly wrong.</p>

			<p>A very FAIR question being: How many non-White births, including pre- and post-natal care of mother and child are paid for by our government (the American TAXPAYERS)? Also how much welfare subsidies go to these non-Whites breeding like mad in our country?</p>
<p>Africa is suffering from a severe overpopulation problem caused by mindless overbreeding by the Black inhabitants. The Latin American countries also having a population problem from overbreeding. Why do you suppose so many Mexicans have been pushed north to become a burden on Americans? China has gotten smart. Instituting strict population control measures (viewed by some as DRACONIAN). India, Pakistan   &mdash;   a bad joke, people steeped in abject poverty yet breeding like demented lemmings.</p>
<p>There are two possible scenarios: Either Whites downsize and form small but healthy and efficient nations, ours included. Then LOCKING OUT non-Whites. Or it will come to a series of bloody mostly civil wars in what were once White nations.</p>

			<p>I am a single, White man looking for a &#8220;good&#8221;(less than twenty sexual partners?!)White woman to marry and have children with.  Let me tell you that it is much worse out there than this article implies.  On the dating websites I go to, they ask: Have children? and then: Want children?  I would say that nine out of ten White women in their forties answer these questions&#8221; no&#8221; and &#8220;definitely&#8221;, respectively.  And most of them, when describing their ideal man, will reply to the question of ethnicity:&#8221;any&#8221;.  These women have lived their entire lives believing the feminist and politically correct lies.  Now, when their biological clock is ticking, they realize the error of their ways, but would still date any race of man.</p>

			<p>The options:1)America ceases to exist and is partioned into smaller race based states or 2)Native Born White Americans throw out millions of hispanics,asians,muslims and post-1965 africans and afro carribeans.</p>
<p>How will Native Born White Americans react to a massive loss of their territory? When this happens, a lot of myths will be shattered.The White areas of the nation are going to feel very crowded. Everyone one is going to want there McMansion. The amenities in the White areas will be destroyed.I have the view that the White middle class in these White areas will expect to have wage slaves from the White population. They will expect to be  parasitically live off a wage slave White underclass. You might see violent class conflict within the White area.</p>
<p>As far as the non-white areas go, well, non-whites will continue to expand their numbers with no concern for the the ecological impact of this. The non-white areas-and I will say this with 100 percent certainty-will become ecological disaster areas.</p>
<p>Of course borders in former US will have to be enforced. A combination of very rapid and explosive population growth in the non-white areas and Whites  enforcing the White borders-non-whites don&rsquo;t respect White borders-makes it inevitable that there will be violent conflict between the differnt race-based micro states.</p>
<p>Something else to think about. If the white population in the White area of the fromer US increases,the White areas will become ecological catastrophe areas also. Everyone will be living on top of each other. The great National and State parks will be paved over for the growing White population in the White areas and the growing non-white population in the non-white areas. The amenities will all be gone. Forests will be gone. Open space will be gone. Mammal species will be gone.</p>
<p> What I have written above is the most likely scenario if  America is racially balkanized. A much better option would be to throw post-1965 non-whites out of the America. This will provoke violent resistance from non-whites no doubt.  The point of no return has been reached. </p>
<p>China,Mexico,India,Pakistan and Korea will hve moved their borders right up to the White borders in the White homeland in the former US. It is infantile to think that there wouldn&rsquo;t be military conflict between the White areas of the former US and China, India  and Pakistan. First outbreak of violence between the White regions and the non-white regions over a border dispute or conflict over acces to a scarce resource and China,India and Pakistan will get involved to protect their own kind.</p>
<p>Pray for a complete collapse of the American economy.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t rule out the possibility that Native Born White Americans will come to their senses. If they do, millions of non-whites are going to be sent packing.</p>

			<p>&#8220;You&rsquo;ll always realize, when soccer matches come, that you dont belong where you&rsquo;re at. Even if your ancestors came from where the land you moved to, it doesnt matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>I studied over seas so I understand this BUT it is an even worse feeling when you get it in an area where your people have been since the American Revolution AND you don&rsquo;t have the benifit of being around polite whites. What is important to you? this you have to answer; what do you like? answer this too, because you can&rsquo;t have it all anymore. I think what we want is community but this takes time and most  &mdash;  like mine here in the South  &mdash;  will fall soon enough. No, sir, I like classical music concerts and since I have a little bit of money left from the ravages of crime and the governments I may relocate in an Eastern European country and go to concerts all the time until I die. As for fighting, a small number of us have been holding up the banner  &mdash;  literally (Confederate flag)  &mdash;  for years now and our folks treat us as either crazy or not at all, as they go to some college football game. Sometimes I wonder if we failed them. After all we all have our part to play. But we haven&rsquo;t  &mdash;  we&rsquo;ve all pleaded with them but they won&rsquo;t listen. I know what all of you have endured and it&rsquo;s maybe worse. These people are brainwashed by the TV and that&rsquo;s the end of it. When reality finally sets in for the few that can even grasp what is going on, then, if they wish to resist their extinction, then I may return. And even if I do stay here I have lost so much respect for my friends and family that I cannot look at them in the eye. We all deserve to be happy too. Some of these people will willingly vote a man of a different race into the presidency, what can you do with people like that? The Republic is dead. The mobacracy is profane. Like a fish that needs a certain type of water to swim in, so we need a certain environment and it shrinks here and the rest are too lazy to even get to the point of awknowleging it much less doing anything about it. Also they are scared they will lose their job, house, reputation ect. Oh you&rsquo;ll lose it alright, in the end. We live in a nation of con-men and whores. But if folks want to stay and fight let&rsquo;s run full force at the media. They are the first that must fall for anything to happen  &mdash;  use the anti-trust laws on them, USE whatever works. The public school system would be next. Then we could build something again. But this waiting? Every new outrage and STILL the TV coralls them into good cattle. I don&rsquo;t think stark poverty in a ditch would wake up the average white as long as the omnipresent media continues it&rsquo;s campaign: to destroy whites. Just think, if we had control of the media for one week I bet we could deprogram the whole lot. That&rsquo;s the power, that&rsquo;s the enemy. CofCC says &#8220;1% of white South Africans murdered&#8221; I bet an indepth docu-drama would wake a few up, it might would hurt Obama too. But alas, it&rsquo;s about a black immigrant that is carrying the US flag at the Olympics.</p>

<p>   I agree with you but I&rsquo;m too old and my roots are too deep to leave this country. An old tree can&rsquo;t be successfully transplanted to new soil. Whites will survive and still prosper in America, but it won&rsquo;t be the country I loved and grew up in. If you are still young, go to Europe and see how you like it. You may be doing yourself and your future children a big favor by leaving.  </p>

			<p>Actually Fed Up, most Chinese women IN THE RURAL VILLAGES have 2 or 3 children (which are off the communist control radar), its the urban educated career minded chinese woman who CHOOSES to have 1 or no kids that has pushed the birth rate down. However China&rsquo;s population CONTINUES TO GROW, it seems only white people have gone off child bearing enn masse.<br>
Also to be fair to the Indians,Pakistanis and Africans safe birth control is not avaliable, I think many of them would want to have fewer kids.     </p>

			<p>Thanks piccard for the excellent map references.</p>
<p>Perhaps the only rational solution is to partition the country.  I&rsquo;ve been looking at the numbers.  </p>
<p>If the folowing states; California, Nevada, Alaska, Hawaii, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey and the district of Columbia were expelled from the union, the remaining 30 states would have a population that is about 80% White. </p>
<p>White areas of Appalachian North Carolina, Maryland, Greorgia, Alabama, and Virginia can be attached to the New White Republic as well. </p>
<p>Perhaps the remaining 30 states can form a new confederation with some of the Canadian provinces to form a new White Nation.</p>
<p>This new White nation could be about 85% to 90% White.  It would stretch from the North Atlantic to the North Pacific and from Hudson Bay to the Tennessee River.</p>
<p>However, at the rate that non-whites are migrating into core White areas there is only a 10 to 20 window of oppurtunity here.  After that partition becomes almost a moot point, except on a very small scale.</p>
<p>Maybe AR can dedicate a thread to just this toopic.  Maybe AR can produce some maps showing possible partition possibilities.</p>

<p>&#8220;We live in a nation of con-men and whores.&#8221;</p>
<p>Your mind is panicked and confused, and you are alienated from your fellow whites, while you feel the world collapsing around you. I understand, its OK. I very often felt overwhelmed as well.<br>
It feels like the weight of the world is on your shoulders and no one even understands why you feel that way. You are talking in superlatives and seeing visions of the end of days&hellip;<br>
I can only urge you to calm down, we will get through this somehow, together. Your own fears will cripple you and prevent you from accomplishing anything. They act as a self-fulfilling prophecy, no matter how much power our enemies actually have, panicking and fear-mongering gives them more. You cannot make up for the half-asleep state of middle America by shouting yourself hoarse and you cannot make up for their lack of awareness by being schizophrenically paranoid, with alarm bells ringing always in your head. </p>
<p>If going away for a while is what you need to reach a level-headed state, then maybe thats best. It has been wonderful therapy for me. I just dont think that I can live my life as a man, and be proud of myself, having left behind my countrymen in their darkest hour because I like clean streets, safety, and classical music. There is something about the comfort of European cafe society that I absolutely despise, and I&rsquo;m not going to run into their arms anymore to escape from the nightmare we created on our own soil. I know the chips are stacked against us, but fortunes can change in a moment. </p>
<p>Nations have dark hours, my friend. Nations have very, very dark hours, where the outlook is bleak and their existence is threatened. Just look at Serbia for example, and how they suffered under the Ottomans: they came close to being annihilated multiple times. We are certainly experiencing that now. It is all the more important, in times like these, to not give up. The dangers that threaten us are no more serious than what other nations have faced before and survived. It turns out that it is very difficult to wipe-out or disposess an intelligent, resourceful, adventurous people. Losing Detroit or St. Louis or California does not mean checkmate. </p>
<p>But I understand you because I know how living in America can play tricks on your mind and make you feel insane. Clear up your head however you need to, and consider rejoining the fight when you&rsquo;re well. </p>

<p>So really the idea of &#8216;growth&rsquo; is only in warm bodies, not in high level productive citizens. So the home builders cannot make money off of them, bankers cannot make money, credit card cos, etc so minorities are a financial disaster for capitalism. It is only when the corporations who run America figure this out that the government abuses may end. Also, the illegal aliens ARE NOT PAYING HOSPITIAL BILLS for live births, at 40 or 50 MILLION  a year. All they do is drain drain drain. It will have to be dealt with eventually.</p>
<p>Do not dispare. Obama should be getting in like greased lightning if all these minorities were legal. They are not. We need to fight to keep it that way. </p>

			<p>&#8220;In short, please voice your opinions with the morale of your fellow Americans in mind. We don&rsquo;t need any more contempt poured out on us or our situation&#8221;</p>
<p>Posted by Tony from OL at 11:45PM on August 7</p>
<p>My highest respect goes to my fellow AR people. They are the exception to the rule. I hold them in highest esteem. Most of my contempt is reserved for the corrupt leaders of our society. The demographic displacement we face was completely avoidable and unnecessary. Thanks to politicians and special interests, our children will be living in the United States of Brazil.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t originally intend to depict a &#8220;doomsday portrait&#8221; as you say. It&rsquo;s true that the USA won&rsquo;t turn into Cuba tomorrow morning. On the other hand, in terms of majority influence, who can deny that there&rsquo;s been a slow but constant decline for about 40 years? It never gets better or even stops. Sorry if this insight brings people down. Just don&rsquo;t blame me. I&rsquo;m just the messenger. My opinions are merely words on a computer screen. I&rsquo;m guilty of venting. <br>
Don&rsquo;t you think the REALITY of what America has become is even MORE DEMORALIZING to thinking Americans? As far as unthinking Americans go, their stupidity has enabled the corrupt and powerful to get away with all of this. Unthinking Americans wouldn&rsquo;t think of visiting a site like this because they conform to their conditioning uncritically. These Americans would probably call you a racist for posting here. They are going to vote for Obama. I&rsquo;ve held on to my sanity and morale DESPITE these type of Americans. </p>
<p>Perhaps the best way to describe my outlook is to refer to an AR book review of &#8220;When William Came&#8221; from the December 2001 issue. I don&rsquo;t want to live under what I consider to be an alien occupation of the country I live in. Hostile elites hate the things that I love. That tends to color how I feel about living here. </p>
<p>My way of dealing with this is not for everyone. I really don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s going to be a mass exodus of whites. My plan to move is not done to spite those who choose to stay. I want to give it a try at least. Maybe I&rsquo;ll return. Maybe not. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually lived for a brief period in the country I&rsquo;m intending  to move to, so I know how it feels to be an American outside of America. It has its downside. There are feelings of not belonging. But that is also true for many white Americans within their own country (as Dan Rather 12:23PM on August 8 has rightly noted). </p>

			<p>Joe is 100% correct in his comments.  I was one of the low-level foot soldiers doing some field work and processing for the 2000 census, and the vast majority of US countries are in sparsely populated rural areas.  The vast majority of US population, however, is concentrated in less than 15% of the country&rsquo;s counties, mostly urban centers  &mdash;   and these are overwhelmingly non-White.  You&rsquo;ll also see this reflected in the school population  &mdash;   already by 2005, a majority of US students in middle school and below were already non-White, by 2010 a majority of US students will be non-White.  (Even this underestimates it  &mdash;   large numbers of Black and Latino kids don&rsquo;t go to school if they&rsquo;re in agricultural work, school breakdown and so forth.)</p>
<p>The future is with us now, folks.  It will make little difference if we beat around the bush, make cuts in illegal immigration, since it&rsquo;s legal immigration that&rsquo;s overwhelming us.  And even if this could be halted tomorrow  &mdash;   natural growth will make the USA majority non-White by 2015.  IOW short of a mass deportation of even legal immigrants, the USA will no longer be a Western nation  &mdash;   very, very soon.</p>
<p>The 2:53 p.m. comment is also right on, since now there are really only 2 choices.  One is a likely partition of the country  &mdash;   hopefully a peaceful one though such things are scary to contemplate.  If you&rsquo;ve worked in Arizona before (5 years in Scottsdale), let alone in Florida or New Mexico, Colorado or California, New York or Michigan, you&rsquo;ll know immediately that these are the vanguards of the disappearance of White Western USA.</p>
<p>OTOH, my White colleagues are emigrating in increasing numbers, as well.  Perhaps the one &#8220;fall-back&#8221; that USA Whites have is that  &mdash;   since we&rsquo;re not indigenous to places like Canada, Australia, or Australia  &mdash;   we have ancestral connections to Europe, which at least in some places still has survival potential.  The UK is unfortunately a lost cause, and Britain is if anything even worse than the USA in its trajectory, as is Sweden.  But most of Central Europe (the corridor stretching Hungary/the Adriatic, through Germany/Austria, Denmark and Finland), is in better shape  &mdash;   most now have a practically &#8220;no-Muslims&#8221; immigration policy, they&rsquo;re well more than 96% White, and they will take in their Diaspora in the USA with ethnic connections, provided that some criteria are met.  You&rsquo;ll have to learn some German but that&rsquo;s about the only minor inconvenience  &mdash;   a number of my acquaintances have done just that, emigrated there, and they&rsquo;re now thriving and raising their children there.</p>

			<p>I agree with Jupiter&rsquo;s post. If we Partisan America into the different races, their will be a never ending fight for space and resources.  </p>
<p>As it stands now America is already over populated. Approx. 1.5 million LEGAL immigrants from third world countries come to the USA each YEAR and approx. 87 thousand break into America each month. Don&rsquo;t you think that is way to many people in one year from third world people? Now add to the birth rate of all Americans and the birth rate of illegal alien women that their children are NOW US citizens. </p>
<p>I say expel them all out of the country now. SHUT of legal immigration from all third world countries, period. </p>
<p>As it stands approx. 30% of the prison population constants of foreigners – illegal and legal. We the people are forced to pay for their time in prison. Start the deportation of all foreign inmates to their home countries ASAP. If the alien is a legal resident or a naturalized citizen the USA, then the USA takes it from them permanently. The USA should charge 5 – 10 thousand per alien to the country of origin considering the trade deficit is considerably high thanks to NAFTA – minus the deportation fees from the trade deficit! </p>
<p>The USA could even offer to free the entire black prison population provided they and their families renounce their USA citizenship and become a citizen of Libra! After all President (traitor) Lincoln purchased Libra for them to start! </p>
<p>This action alone would free up much needed monetary funds. The prison guards could then be re-trained and relocated to ALL borders in the USA and help stop the flow of aliens trying to get in! </p>
<p>The USA could then take our tiny white minority in South Africa and bring them here under the refugee program. </p>
<p>Furthermore, we the people must gain control of the MSM, maybe through anti-trust laws to accomplish that? </p>
<p>Kill the NEA, the UN, NAFTA, GATT and any other free trade agreement because it an&rsquo;t free! </p>
<p>Kill the Federal Department of Education as it is unconstitutional to start. Begin implementing the curriculum into the public schools that was taught before the dumbing down began!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>That should help un-brain wash the masses. And promote marriage, family and children! </p>
<p>Re-implement the 1792 Naturalization act – free white people of good moral character. <br>

			<p>If they would simply deport all the illegals, the White population base would be back to what it was in 1990, 75%.  Second, cut off the government benefits.  When teenager Loqueisha is living with her parents, sorry, her momma and she doesn&rsquo;t have any prospects and no future, she can turn to da gubmint.  All she gotta do is get down and dirty and end up pregnant.  She can get her own apartment or maybe a house in a White suburb on a voucher, food stamp cards and a little bit of money every month for doing little more than raising a bunch of little future criminals. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve toyed with the idea of leaving myself after I get older.  There are better and cheaper places to live in the world than  &#8220;Amerika&#8221;.  I read that article and the comments that followed and I&rsquo;m a little dismayed at these people.  These posters sound like left-wing kooks to me.  America is too far to the left as it is and these people moved because it&rsquo;s not liberal enough?  I got angry over the comment about happy to be leaving rednecks and Jesusland.  They live in Europe so they can get socialized medicine and their kids can go to college for free.  Seriously, what is their problem?  What makes them think the government owes them anything?  There&rsquo;s something suspicious about this.  Someone who can afford to live in Europe can afford to pay for health insurance and college tuition.  What&rsquo;s the big deal?  I pay $240.00 a year in premiums and $12.00 for a doctor&rsquo;s visit.  Most people who don&rsquo;t have insurance are minorities and even they can go to the emergency room and skip out on the bill. </p>

<p>Miroslav is 100% correct about our demographic trends.  Even if we were to stop all legal and illegal non-white immigration right now tha United States has already passed a demographic point of no return.  Stopping all non-White immigration will only delay the coming minority-majority America to about 2060 or so instead of the late 2030s or 2040s based on current figures.  Note: the 2050 date is off by at least 10 years.  Expect minority-majority America by as early as 2035.</p>
<p>Look the data is already in.  The majority of those five years younger are already majority non-white.  The majority of school age children are still white, but barely.  In a few  years the majority of all people under the age of 20 will be non-white.  </p>
<p>So the deed has been done.  We have thrown away our country.  We will go out with a whimper.</p>
<p>Emigration is no real solution for most of us.  Throwing out the no0n-whites (legals/illegals) will not happen either.  In fact, expect Obama to win and Amnesty granted to the illegals.  Plus even more legal immigration.  Its almost all over.  Partition - even though I fully support it is not going to happen either.</p>

			<p>Those of you talking about white birth rates are missing the point. Even if whites had a much higher birth rate, it would only postpone our minority status by a few decades, and, in the meantime, we would still have to deal hundreds of millions of non-whites within our society. We should have never been put in this position in the first place. The only solution is for us to have our own society, or, at the very least, our own communities. We simply cannot out breed all the non-whites already here and the millions more that are following them, and we shouldn&rsquo;t have to.</p>

			<p>We are becoming North Brazil.  It&rsquo;s a dirty, corrupt place but the white upper class makes it work for themselves to some extent.  Don&rsquo;t keep your money in bonds since the pressure to inflate increases as diverse people demand more from the government, and be careful where you buy real estate.  Even if we don&rsquo;t have formal political partition, various racial groups will continue to congregate in different areas.  There are still many entirely white areas of the US.</p>

			<p>As I look around the St. Louis, Missouri area, I see whites continuing to push further and further away from the central city in order to maintain a mostly white living space.  Jobs and stores follow so the city is re-created step by step.  Non-whites are left to themselves in the inner city.  This internal migration is clearly what will be happening more and more.  The other thing which will happen is that government benefits will be drastically cut.  Whites may not be able to expel the non-whites but they can and will stop paying for them.  </p>

			<p>Those thinking of jetting off to Europe, you&rsquo;d be advised to consider that most demographic projections show that Western European nations will likely have MUSLIM MAJORITIES by the end of this century.<br>
European Whites have fewer children than American Whites so when the percentages catch up with them in a few years, the transformation of Europe will be faster and more traumatic than what has and is happening in America.</p>

			<p>Of course, the brute unavoidable facts of mathematics and demographic momentum means that the USA will be by 2030-40 (not the 2050 that is commonly cited), a non-white majority nation.<br>
  This from a nation that as recently as 1960 was 90% White, this is just one indication of how fast things can change when we are dealing with differential growth rates, and it is likely that the nations of Europe (eg France the UK), that encouraged mass immigration aren&rsquo;t too far behind. - This must be taken as atimely warning to those few remaining White nations that haven&rsquo;t (as yet) countenanced mass immigration - once the process has started it never reverses and inevitably culminates (much sooner than people think) in race replacement.<br>
  By 2100 the USA will have the racial profile of Brazil.</p>

Will Native Born White American parents have an indifferent reaction when there children do not earn enough money to start a family? How about young White males? Do you think they will passively accept becomming economically redundant while the asian male with a wife,family walks down the tree lined suburban street with a golden retriever?

<p>Why are so many people eager to write off Europe because 3-4% of the continent&rsquo;s population is muslim?  Neocons, especially seem to fawn over the idea of Europe being islamified and destroyed.  Why? Are they worried about Europe&rsquo;s growing economic power and the strength of the euro in conjunction with the decline of Americas? Are they worried about an expat population that grows every year?  </p>

Sure there are a lot of broken white neighborhoods but there are also thousands intact. We must keep them that way. This is how it will be done. Every white neighborhood will have councilmen who will vote the neighborhood  &#8220;protected&#8221;. No minorities will be allowed in under any circumstances. We must protect what&rsquo;s ours before there isn&rsquo;t any desirable places to go. </p>

<p>Be prepared for an all out propaganda war when this happens.  Six months ago there was a story in the media about a black woman who threw her black babies from an overpass onto the freeway.  She said she wasn&rsquo;t getting any help from the &#8220;gubmint&#8221; or her baby daddies.  There was such an outpouring of sympathy for this woman who tried to kill her children it made me sick to my stomach.  No doubt it had the effect of greasing the wheels in the State Legislature to ensure that no black woman was left behind.  I wonder if this whole thing was setup just for that purpose but I&rsquo;d like to think people aren&rsquo;t that monstrous.<br>

<p>No one is writing Europe off. Simply stating the facts as best as they can be determined at this point.</p>
<p>You say 3-4% of the population is muslim.<br>
I don&rsquo;t know where you get that from but assuming it were true, what is the current percentage of Hindus, African Christians and various Asian groups?<br>
What is the percentage of mixed race persons?</p>
<p>Nations like Belgium and France do not even keep track of race, so we don&rsquo;t know how many non-Whites are there.<br>
Britain is about 11% non-White, if not more.<br>
The Netherlands is much, much worse and Germany is not far behind.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the birthrates that are significant. Since non-Whites are having far more children than Whites, twenty years from now the demographics will catch up.</p>
<p>For example, today Britain is around 82% British (with about 6% non-British Whites), BUT, according to The Times,<br>
 <br>
&#8220;Muhammad is now second only to Jack as the most popular name for baby boys in Britain and is likely to rise to No 1 by next year.&#8221;<br>
-Helen Nugent and Nadia Menuhin, The Times, June 6 2007</p>
<p></p>
<p>The first step in dealing with a problem is to admit that there is a problem. And far too many Whites today do not know what is coming at them a few years down the road.<br>

			<p>If you live on a street or in a nieghborhood where a nonwhite family  &mdash;  nice or not  &mdash;  moves in, I would advise you to move out while you still have some capital. The last white on that street won&rsquo;t be so lucky and he won&rsquo;t leave with his chin up either. THEREFORE, if a state becomes a majority non-white or hastens to get close, I would advise you to move to a majority white state. (However even these states are full of white communists ignorant of the real joys of multi-cult). AND SO, if a country  becomes majority non-white, or is hastening in that direction, AND the whites show no signs of resisting I must advise moving to a majority white country that shows healthy signs of resisting this demonic religion of cultural-marxism.</p>
<p>Anyone [Tony in OL] that advises otherwise is not being honest. And calling someone &#8220;panicked and confused&#8221; for advancing this observation comes from a delusional outlook. In fact knowingly going down with a ship when there are options and the chance to fight another day is suicidal  &mdash;  the hight of mental illness, if we are forced to use such terminology.</p>
<p>But how&rsquo;s this for &#8220;panicked and confused&#8221;:</p>
<p>Get passport in order.<br>
Call embassies of countries, check on dual citizenship ect<br>
Travel in Eastern Europe.<br>
Look at real estate while there, invistigate banks and lawyers.<br>
See about work or business opportunities.</p>
<p>Even if one decides to stay here and watch everyone make fools of themselves living under a black president it&rsquo;s nice to have an exit plan  &mdash;  just like an exit plan in case your house catches on fire.</p>

			<p>So many Whites think it is wrong (impolite? unseemly? disconcerting?) to discuss anything concerning race and that is why nothing is done until nothing can be done.  They also think if we don&rsquo;t acknowledge we have a problem, maybe there isn&rsquo;t one.  (Magical thinking!)   </p>
<p>The reason Whites are not having enough children to maintain our population is that many of us sense the current zeitgeist.  The less advanced races do not sense anything and continue reproducing in huge numbers, as though ample food and water will always be there.       </p>
<p>The world is in dire straits, from the melting polar caps to the polluted ocean dead zones to toxic air pollution especially in China to the dwindling fresh water and food available for the masses.  But beyond all that, there is probably going to be another World War in this century.  </p>
<p>In decades hence when the survivors pick up the pieces and start setting up new countries with new Constitutions, I hope our future Founding Fathers will establish a land or lands where Whites can be safe, unabused, optimistic and left alone to achieve our own unique ethnic destiny.  When this happens, you will see that Whites will be more than happy to have large families again.  It is just that now times are tough and bound to get tougher, and Whites, being sensitive souls, don&rsquo;t breed so well in captivity.</p>

Evaluate everything you deal with as to whether or not it is &#8220;good for the whites.&#8221;  Care about who your employees are, where you live, what charities you support, the positions of your politicians, and defend your rights.  Jews do this all the time.  We need to as well.</p>
