						<p>The largest single-workplace immigration raid in U.S. history has caused panic among Hispanic families in this small southern Mississippi town, where federal agents rounded up nearly 600 plant workers suspected of being in the country illegally.</p>
<p>One worker caught in Monday&rsquo;s sweep at the Howard Industries transformer plant said fellow workers applauded as immigrants were taken into custody. Federal officials said a tip from a union member prompted them to start investigating several years ago.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>About 100 of the 595 detained workers were released for humanitarian reasons, many of them mothers who were fitted with electronic monitoring bracelets and allowed to go home to their children, officials said.</p>
<p>About 475 other workers were transferred to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Jena, La. Nine who were under 18 were transferred to the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The superintendent of the county school district said about half of approximately 160 Hispanic students were absent Tuesday.</p>
<p>Roberto Velez, pastor at Iglesia Cristiana Peniel, where an estimated 30 to 40 percent of the 200 parishioners were caught up in the raid, said parents were afraid immigration officials would take them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Those detained were from Brazil, El Salvador, Germany, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, and Peru, said Barbara Gonzalez, an ICE spokeswoman.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Howard Industries is in Mississippi&rsquo;s Pine Belt region, known for commercial timber growth and chicken processing plants. The tech company produces dozens of products ranging from electrical transformers to medical supplies, according to its Web site.</p>
<p>Gonzalez said agents had executed search warrants at both the plant and the company headquarters in nearby Ellisville. She said no company executives had been detained, but this is an &#8220;ongoing investigation and yesterday&rsquo;s action was just the first part.&#8221;</p>
<p>A woman at the Ellisville headquarters told The Associated Press on Tuesday that no one was available to answer questions.</p>
<p>In a statement to the Laurel Leader-Call newspaper, Howard Industries said the company &#8220;runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for its jobs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is company policy that it hires only U.S. citizens and legal immigrants,&#8221; the statement said.</p>
<p>Gov. Haley Barbour recently signed a law requiring Mississippi employers to use a U.S. Homeland Security system to check new workers&rsquo; immigration status.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Under the law, a company found guilty of employing illegal immigrants could lose public contracts for three years and the right to do business in Mississippi for one year.</p>
<p>The law also makes it a felony for an illegal immigrant to accept a job in Mississippi. A message was left with the district attorney&rsquo;s office after hours seeking comment on whether he would use the law to bring state charges against Howard Industries or the workers.</p>

			<p>One thing that jumped out at me in this article, and does in most of the articles about mass ICE raids at work sites, is this:</p>
<p>The executives of the companies raided are spoken of as being dismayed, disappointed, or no comment.  Where do we hear that they&rsquo;re being led off in the perp walk?  Seriously, if ICE would do this, it would deter the suits from hiring illegals, and with no job opportunities, the illegals wouldn&rsquo;t sneak in to begin with, and the ones here would self-deport.</p>
<p>Of course, this analysis does not consider welfare.</p>

			<p>&#8220;One worker caught in Monday&rsquo;s sweep at the Howard Industries transformer plant said fellow workers applauded as immigrants were taken into custody.&#8221;</p>
<p>The applause was an expression of relief after having endured the third worlders pushed on them by their criminal employer in order to enrich himself at the expense of everybody else.  </p>
<p>That these deadheads didn&rsquo;t prepare for such a raid after considerable forewarning indicates how backward they really are.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s hoping the rest of them get the message that they&rsquo;re not welcome, pick up their brats and make a bee line for Senor Calderone&rsquo;s corrupt country.</p>
<p>My sympathy certainly isn&rsquo;t with them.  It&rsquo;s with the citizens of this country who have been forced to support them and watch as they run down the neighborhoods and drive down wages after taking all the jobs from citizens who need them just as as much as anyone.</p>

			<p>Two years ago, when Mexican flag-waving mobs hundreds of thousands strong had much of the MSM in awe, I felt just exactly the way I&rsquo;ve felt since living in Latin America decades ago:</p>
<p>All you need is a big symbolic punch-in-the-nose, and these people will scatter like cucarachas. Chanting empty slogans and showing up in large numbers doesn&rsquo;t cut it, and it doesn&rsquo;t matter HOW many of them there are. They&rsquo;ll break and run at a show of Yankee firmness every time.</p>
<p>Oh, how I wish blacks were as easy to handle as hispanics!</p>

The rest is a sleazy verbal diarrhea about suffering of saint illegal==criminal creatures saving us from an imminent disaster.<br>
There&rsquo;s nothing about the harm and suffering the criminals bring upon our everyday life.<br>

Sitting here at my desk, many hundreds of miles from MS, I too am applauding. Applauding the raid, yes   &mdash;   but mostly applauding the worker at the plant who finked to the feds. You, Sir or Ma&rsquo;am, are a true American. Got Illegal Aliens? Put &#8216;em on ICE. </p>

			<p>   I find it really hard to believe that Howard Industries did any checks at all considering they had almost 600 illegals in their plant. Obviously the union member knew it. Bravo, a step in the right direction. In the original article an illegal said they were treated like criminals. THEY ARE CRIMINALS!!!!!!</p>

			<p>This needs to be the beginning of thousands more raids as illegals intimidate me everyday at work and managements support them.  I agree with question diversity.  Why were the suits not included in the roundup???  The employers &amp; immigrants are all complilcit in the violation of USA immigration laws.  Book &#8216;em!  Same goes for drugs: Buyers& sellers are breaking laws/same for ID sellers/buyers.  Those who violate USA laws needs to get big fines, make reciprocity and time if necessary.<br>
I want my taxmoney to support the laws not illegal immigrants and anchor babies.        V</p>

<p>I think we can safely assume that these &#8220;Germans&#8221; are not the kind we normally associate with Germany. Instead,I guarantee they are of some black african muslim illegal, and how did they get here from Germany in the first place?</p>

			<p>Looks like these co-workers have figured out who is forcing wages down, and that this is labor arbitrage, plain and simple.  American families can not afford to compete for the lowest possible wages with illegal aliens from the Third World, and are right to resent it when they are told they must do so in their own country.</p>
<p>Thankfully, ICE was smart enough to fit the hundred or so mothers they released with ankle monitors, rather than simply putting them back into circulation with no way of tracking them.  They&rsquo;re learning.</p>

<p>Yeah, right.  They really had no choice when ICE raided the plant.  If 2 or 3 were to slip through their &#8220;thorough&#8221; background checks, but almost 600? Someone in management knew what was going on and should pay the price.<br>

			<p>Go to this discussion site http://www.alipac.us/ftopic-129384-days0-orderasc-0.html to read Icefan&rsquo;s eyewitness account of the raid. He/she also posted pictures of the raid and of Americans showing up at 6am the next day to apply for jobs. Many hoping to get a place left vacant by an illegal said they have applied before, some many times, but were told they weren&rsquo;t hiring.</p>

			<p>Alright, One thing I noticed about this and every other story like it is that these raids always occur at a &#8220;plant&#8221; somewhere. Never a landscaping truck or a restaurant. What about those that don&rsquo;t work. Tell ICE the can catch about 3,000+ any given morning just standing around doing nothing at all on Yonkers ave. Yonkers, NY or in the villages of Mt Kisco or Ossining. Practically anywhere in Westchester county. When are they coming there??</p>

			<p>Every once in a while you get these huge raids with hundreds. It doesn&rsquo;t matter, there are MILLIONS of illegals here. And it took them years to do this single one where they rounded up what amounts to a grain of sand of the total illegal population. Meanwhile we have border fences being stalled, border agents handicapped and sometimes punished for doing their jobs. Does anyone honestly think this is any more than a diversion?</p>

			<p>  Ken in Fishkill. I know how feel. I wish they would come and round them up here in NE IL. I&rsquo;m jealous. There must be a large breath of fresh air in that Mississippi town.</p>

 I always thought blacks would ruin the area. I never thought of illegal aliens until about 7 years ago when I read the 2000 census figures. I was shocked. Waukegan, the Fox River Valley,NW Indiana,etc. We have major panderers in Daley, Blagojevich, Obama and especially, Durbin. These men all seem to want more and more of them. They&rsquo;re traitors, all of them.</p>

			<p>Management really has no excuse in this case.  Note that the complaint by that union member was lodged several years ago; this was not some temporary slip-up that management was willing to correct on its own, but a years-long, ongoing policy.  Moreover, this was 600 illegal aliens working at the plant, instead of a handful.  Management has no claim whatever to upstanding conduct when they decided to obey US and Mississippi law only after dozens of armed agents showed up in a suprise raid.</p>
<p>The &#8220;German&#8221; - almost certainly a Turk - probably came to the US on a tourist visa and then deliberately overstayed.  This is relatively common with illegal aliens from outside the North &amp; South American mainland.</p>

<p>   Yes, I&rsquo;m afraid North East Illinois has become more like New Jersey, Maryland, D.C. and Northern Virginia. Uncontrolled diversity/immigration has ruined/spoiled the entire area. I believe some parts of Central and all of Southern Illinois are still mostly white. Chicago is still a better city for middle class whites than LA, PHilly, Atlanta or New York.</p>

			<p>It must have been more shocking to the Americans who were  applauding the removal of the illegal aliens then it was for the illegal aliens being removed. They were applauding because they couldn&rsquo;t believe what they were witnessing, an actual case of the law being upheld. I mean, I can understand their emotions, what they saw is so rare. </p>
