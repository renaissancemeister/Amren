<p>It&rsquo;s about culture in the end. In its escalating dysfunction Belgium demonstrates the inextricable link between culture and nationhood. As acting mayor Mr. Thi√©ry presides over tense meetings at which nationalists from out of town listen to hear if he utters a word in French instead of Flemish, as the various Dutch dialects of Flanders are known. If so, he said, all council decisions can be annulled, and he can be replaced as mayor by someone the Flemish choose.</p>

			<p>I do wish Europeans would quit bickering among each other for once and do something about the invading Muslim and African hordes. Otherwise, the French vs. Flemish issue may be irrelevant in several years.</p>

			<p>Nahhh, this article is not about kicking out &#8220;real&#8221; foreigners, so at this point, little will change in Belgium. All I can think of is that the French quarter might get more of it, and the Flemish might crack down.</p>

			<p>I remember visiting Belgium in the 1980&rsquo;s. What a marvelous country, both halves. Each section had a flavor, an &#8216;elan&rsquo; uniquely it&rsquo;s own. I never could figure out how the Flemish and the French lived side by side, when they are completely distinct, different cultures. While I loved the food in the French part of the country, I attended a local production of the Classic Audrey Hepburn film, &#8216;Wait until Dark&rsquo; done in Flemish at a local theater. Being an English-speaker, at first I understood NOTHING, but as the evening went on (because Flemish and English are rather related) I began to think I knew every word. A most enjoyable evening.<br>

			<p>I forget which Belgium city it is, but there is one that is almost exclusively populated by black Africans.  So the Flemish and Belgian French go at one another, while ceding increasing amounts of territory in their little country to Africans.  This is truly madness.  I guess it is okay to be nationalist as long as it is whites against whites?</p>
<p>When I was in Luxemborg in 1997, there were an awful lot of Morrocans settled in.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I think that today is not the 16th century and the foreigners of that time were Europeans, even the Jewish ones.  (Re-full article) Today, they are not European.  Even if Belgium splits it is better than the European Union&rsquo;s apparent Marxist plan to adulterate European genetics beyond identity.  </p>
<p>The micro-nations that would result due to a restructuring - division of territories may do more to preserve local ethinicities and cultures - and peace than the EU promise.  A Europe with a higher number of smaller states might actually counter balance the much smaller world of the 21st century.  After all, if there are no longer Flemish people, those Belgian Waffles would go extinct too.  Africans aren&rsquo;t interested in producing Belgian tapestries either.</p>

			<p>&#8220;With Flemish Nationalism on the Rise, Belgium Teeters on the Edge&#8221;</p>
<p>So, what&rsquo;s the big deal?  I mean, it&rsquo;s common knowledge that the entire continent of Europe and the United States are both on the brink of full scale upheaval.</p>
<p>The West is just one incident, or one riot away from serious conflict, and if the economy goes in the tank we&rsquo;re going to be even closer to the edge.</p>
<p>Those of us who have warned of this will be proven right.</p>

<p><br>
Because altough they&rsquo;re of different nationality, they&rsquo;re the same race. It&rsquo;s a bit like Quebec. Altough they&rsquo;re French they&rsquo;ve lived side-by-side with other Canadians and both had a very parallel evolution. There&rsquo;s a few sparks here and there in both cases but never anything major.</p>

In the past, little countries were conquered or absorbed by larger nations. Today, because such European wars are in the past (though the future is always uncertain), all these micro-nations can reform and be independent.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason this artificial union should be forced on everyone. Let them separated and be happy. Then maybe they can join forces against the real common enemies.<br>

			<p>It is nice to see the nationalist flame still alive in Europe but Belgium is largely irrelevant tiny country. It would be like if Delaware broke up.  I wish Europeans would fight the real enemy first, then correct these ancient grudges between their brothers&hellip;..</p>

			<p>One thing our secular age forgets or finds incomprehensible is that Belgium did once have something tying it together: the Catholic faith.  It&rsquo;s why Flanders is not part of the Netherlands today; they are the Dutch people who did not fall away from Catholicism when the &#8220;Reformation&#8221; happened.  </p>
<p>In the worldview of the time, then, what divided the Flemish from the Dutch (religion) was far more important than what united them (language and ethnicity).  Carving out a chunk of northern France made &#8220;Belgium&#8221; big enough to be a buffer state between France and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>I agree that vapid gasbaggery such as seen in the EU or &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; organizations can never be a source of national or supra-national feeling strong enough to overcome ethno-linguistic differences; but something like deeply and sincerely felt religious conviction can and did, especially among peoples who, while quite distinct, were at least reasonably closely related.  After all both Flemings and Walloons are north western Europeans.</p>

			<p>I thought this was an interesting quote from the article:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Flemish friend,&rdquo; Mr. Dannemark said, &ldquo;put it to me this way: &lsquo;Flanders has nothing in common with Holland except language, and the Flemish and Walloons have everything in common except language.&rsquo; But there&rsquo;s almost no communication between the two communities, except through rock music, which everybody sings in English, and sports, which transcend everything.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>It is not only subsidizing the Socialist parasites and nonsense I think the kicker is that they are relocating french speaking african refugees into Flemish areas and destroying them (intentionally or unintentionally).  Time for independent Flanders.  Merging with Holland would be a huge mistake also.</p>

			<p>Belgium was and is an artificial state, largely created by British foreign policy in the 1830s.<br>
 In the aftermath of the Napoleonic wars, Brtiain sought to create a neutral&rsquo;buffer&rsquo;nation adjacent to north-east France in order to check French expansionism.<br>
 To this end, Britain guranteed Belgian sovereignty and independence.In fact this was the declared instigation for Britaion&rsquo;s intervention in World War 1.</p>

<p>While the linguistic situation in  tiny Belgium is  perhaps interesting in the abstract,  there are far more major problems, racial problems,  afflicting us in the wider world for us to waste so much time here on this minor family squabble. And anyway, this is not a racial issue.</p>
<p>I might, in other circumstances, sympathize better with the Flemish and Walloons, but at this time of Third World invasion pouring into Europe, I have little sympathy left in me for special interest white groups  - whether in Spain, Ireland, or wherever   &mdash;   who persist in rocking the boat.  In unity is our strength.</p>

			<p>The nationalist flemish movement Vlaams Belang is one of the most vocal anti immigrant and anti islamic groups in belgium if not europe, it has tried to be banned by the authorites numerous times. The break up of belgium would be a major blow for the EU and multi-cult project. long live a free flanders.</p>
