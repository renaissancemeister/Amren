<h1>Murder Suspect&rsquo;s Unrelated Charges With Grand Jury</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WRAL-TV (Raleigh), August 12, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More than a dozen charges against a teenager accused of killing two North Carolina college students will go before a grand jury next week, according to a court decision Tuesday.</p>
<p>The charges are related to a crime spree authorities said Laurence Alvin Lovette, 17, went on during the two months between the deaths of Duke University graduate student Abhijit Mahato and former University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill student body president Eve Carson. Lovette has been charged with first-degree murder in both deaths.</p>
<p>The grand jury will consider a slew of charges unrelated to the murders, including first-degree burglary, breaking and entering, resisting a police officer and possession of a stolen motor vehicle. Lovette also faces two counts of larceny after breaking and entering, according to WRAL-TV.</p>
<p>Court records show Lovette had been arrested several times and charged with felonies ranging from burglary to car theft between Jan. 18, when Mahato was found dead in his Durham apartment, and March 5, when Carson was found shot five times in a Chapel Hill street.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lovette was already on probation, having been charged with misdemeanor larceny and breaking and entering shortly before his 17th birthday. Those were originally felony charges but were reduced in a plea agreement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

			<p>Probation. Parole. These slugs are always on one or the other when they kill innocent people. These judges should be tossed in the same cell as the monsters they grant parole or probation to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so predictable.</p>

<p>One often hears of instances where &#8220;Black&#8221; males (including this tiny tot) are arrested and then they are put back on the street by the corrupt legal-political complex. Perhaps it is they who should be locked up. </p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that killing one non-white person was not enough for him. This is like a serial killing or mass-murderer hiding as someone interested in $20</p>

			<p>Lovett looks like a black Alfred E. Newman.</p>
<p>&#8220;What, me worry?&#8221;</p>
<p>Why legislators vote to exclude under 18 from the death penalty is a mystery to me.  Possibly they have an image of some naive young white kid in mind, instead of a black, mature primitive that delights in killing.</p>
<p>From the looks of him, he could probably escape being executed also by claiming retardation.</p>
<p>But, to my way of thinking, being young and/or retarded should be points FOR the death penalty, not against it.</p>

			<p>Lovetts defense will probably be paid for by Lutheran Social Services of Minnesota.</p>
<p>Aside from that, don&rsquo;t you just get so tired of reading these types of stories and seeing these mug shots?  Sweet Jesus, when will it ever end?</p>

			<p>Maybe John Edwards can defend them.  That &#8220;son of the south&#8221; has surely got plenty of time on his hands-at least until he cuts off his tramp&rsquo;s &#8220;hush money&#8221; and the paternity suit is filed.  </p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t legislators. It was the United States Supreme Court that decided we cannot execute anyone who was under 18 when they committed their crime, no matter how badly they deserve it.</p>

<p>What was their decision based on, guy?  I have no doubt you&rsquo;re right, but I&rsquo;m just wondering why it is determined that teenage killers should get a break. </p>

<p>It was based on the usual gutter logic and mental gymnastics that judges resort to when they want to openly defy the will of the people.</p>
<p>Here is a synopsis of the case:</p>
