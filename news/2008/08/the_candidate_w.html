<p>Obama has also been defeated by racism (again). He can&rsquo;t connect and &#8220;close the deal&#8221; with ordinary Americans too doltish to comprehend a multicultural biography that includes what Cokie Roberts of ABC News has damned as the &#8220;foreign, exotic place&#8221; of Hawaii. As The Economist sums up the received wisdom, &#8220;lunch-pail Ohio Democrats&#8221; find Obama&rsquo;s ideas of change &#8220;airy-fairy&#8221; and are all asking, &#8220;Who on earth is this guy?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Frank Rich is right.  With this horrible economy, the *ONLY* reason McCain will win (if he wins) is because of race, in this case, justified white fear of Obama&rsquo;s constituents.</p>

			<p>Obama&rsquo;s problem is his inexperience and &#8220;big plan&#8221; appeal which is starting to unravel. </p>
<p>His &#8220;big plan&#8221; is for all of us to come together into a radical liberal worldview with Obama as our leader and those that refuse to be persecuted for their unwillingness to surrender their beliefs, morals, ethics, and values to the &#8220;big plan&#8221;. </p>
<p>The purpose of all this appears to be so that we can corporately deny ourselves and suffer for the good of the everyone else to our own national peril in the greatest government sponsored taxpayer funded give away in the history of the world. </p>
<p>What&rsquo;s happening is that voters are starting to realize this.</p>

			<p>I expected this article to tell us something of substance about Obama.  It&rsquo;s true we hear too much about him but what we hear is all junk.  Where he&rsquo;s going to be, his speeches, etc.  Very little about his plan for America, defining his policies and politics.  What&rsquo;s all this &#8220;change&#8221; we hear about?  I expected the New York Times would clear this up but instead it just attacks McCain.</p>

Cokie Roberts is right about Hawaii. It happens to be a tropical island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, where Americans go to get away from it all.</p>
<p>And lunch-pail Ohio Democrats are asking the right question. There is indeed something strange, exotic, and foreign about Barack Obama. He doesn&rsquo;t fit into any known pattern. They should be wary.</p>

			<p>The American public does not understand that political leaders have secret missions. Will a black president of America supply U.S. military weapons to the black leaders of Africa? Will the black leaders of Africa resell the same American weapons to the radical Muslims? Will the radical Muslims achieve a successful nuclear detonation on American soil?</p>
<p>The world is in danger.</p>

			<p>Guess that makes me, and most of my friends, family, associates, &#8220;dolts&#8221; since we&rsquo;re not taken in by the media bull droppings about our Mulatto Messiah. A man with all the depth and substance of a rainbow. A proven liar. A habitual flip-flopper who stupidly tells us what we sure as hell do not want to hear: &#8220;White countries need to tear down walls. Admit lots more immigrants!&#8221; To which all I can say is: THANKS BUT NO THANKS! We already have a hundred times more than enough criminals and freeloaders in our Afro-American and illegal Hispanic immigrant population.</p>

			<p>I doubt that people have that many illusions about Barack Obama  &mdash;   it&rsquo;s just that, quite simply, electing Barack Obama to the Presidency would be the one event that wakes White Americans out of our self-destructive complacency.  White Americans now are like lemmings, blindly following the crowd as our country collapses demographically.  Victory by Obama would be the one event to shock our people enough to wake up, and stop looking at things through rose-colored glasses!</p>

<p>My sentiments exactly.  I wonder if this out-of-touch dork even understands the impact a white hating racist preacher and his flock, which have been described as nothing out of ordinary in the black community, have on those who sat and watched such a display of racial hatred time and time again on their televisions.</p>
<p>A large percentage of whites are beginning to pick up on the fact that they are hated by the majority of blacks, and this Obama is just another of them that spent twenty-two years being programmed with hatred for whites in an evil, racist church that is only one of many. </p>
<p>And this moron thinks whites are racist for not wanting a black in office.  He should be drawn and quartered and left for the buzzards.</p>

Then again people pay to have a stomach churning experience on a carnival ride or pay to be nearly scared to death by an unpleasant thriller movie.

			<p>Obama is a socialist.  He thinks the government isn&rsquo;t big enough, that it doesn&rsquo;t tax enough, and that it doesn&rsquo;t have enough deficit spending.  He favors illegal immigration and more mass immigration.  He is eager to see whites become a minority.  Although he is less likely to start a war than McCain he does not reject the role of America as world cop, so he&rsquo;ll continue wasting hundreds of billions of dollars a year overseas.  Those are enough reasons for me to reject Obama, even if he was white.</p>
<p>Unfortunately all the negative things that editorial had to say about McCain are true.  </p>

<p>Its best not to vote. if less than 10% vote then the system is shown to be a lie that it is. until the electronic machines are gone its the only thing to do </p>

			<p>Whilst in a bookstore today, I sat down and read some of &#8220;The Audacity of Hope&#8221;. I found it surprisingly well-written, by the way. In any case, I flipped to the chapter entitled &#8220;Race&#8221; and I was horrified at what he had to say if for no other reason than that it was so predictable. </p>
<p>For a candidate who is billed as being &#8220;beyond race&#8221;, he certainly seems obsessed with the topic. In the first 4 pages (all I read) he catalogs perceived racial slights, such as security guards following him (happens to me sometimes; I&rsquo;m white) and being pulled over &#8220;for no reason&#8221; (happens to me too).  Also in the first four pages I read there is the standard nonsense about the rich ruling class conspiring to keep the poor coloreds down, with Obama positing that more must be done to encourage &#8220;equality&#8221;. I must say I was surprised at the superficiality of his opinions; it was in contrast to the elegant writing style. </p>
<p>I would encourage everyone to go to the bookstore or library and read this book (but buy something else&hellip;I spent my money on an educational book instead). I think a president with Obama&rsquo;s juvenile views on race will make for a very difficult four years.</p>

			<p>Obama is exactly like those smooth talking car stereo salesmen who were rampant in the 80s.  They could talk great, and then when the off brand speakers you bought blow up, he&rsquo;s nowhere to be found.</p>

			<p>Just look at the history of black occupation anywhere and you will see what that entails; corruption, violence and ill treatment of their own. If elected, Obama would become another one of them.  Eventually his militant side would dominate his judgement and all would suffer. And his wife is worse than he is. She&rsquo;s a Cynthia McKinney in the making. Very dangerous people and a disaster for this nation.  </p>

			<p>From my perspective here in England, Obama is a mixed-race, American version of Tony Blair.  Let me emphasise that I don&rsquo;t mean that as a compliment.  The problem with Blair (and, paradoxically, it was also his greatest political asset) is that he has no philosophical underpinning of firmly held political belief.<br>
Put simply, he doesn&rsquo;t actually believe in anything at all.  He&rsquo;s not a liberal, or a conservative, or a marxist or a socialist - the Labour party was for him merely a convenient vehicle on which he could ride to power.  He would say whatever was required to achieve his objective - power, for its own sake, lying and dissembling shamelessly whenever it suited his purpose.<br>
To Lincoln&rsquo;s famous adage about not being able to fool all of the people all of the time, he might have added a rider - if you have charisma and a gift for producing high-sounding but essentially meaningless phrases, you can fool enough of the people enough of the time.<br>
Blair had those qualities, and Obama has them, too.</p>

			<p>    I agree with the above posters, but I don&rsquo;t think Obama is an actual Marxist. He is more of a &#8220;Useful Idiot&#8221;. I do not believe that the man&rsquo;s thinking is organized enough to follow Marxist thought which has a certain intellectual component. Obama is more of a &#8220;Kumbaya&#8221; guy. His thinking is more along the line of the great philosopher Rodney King (&#8220;Can&rsquo;t we all get along?&#8221;)</p>

			<p>Frank Rich sums up the stupidity of the liberal elite &#8220;why don&rsquo;t these idiotic, ignorant racist whites support us&#8221; the answer, of course is in the question..</p>
<p>Its interesting that Rich also ignores Black racism, Obama&rsquo;s racism and blames anyone and everything against Obama as &#8216;racist&rsquo;&hellip;Frank Rich, I suspect comes from that old Bolshevik leftist mentality that anything which destroys Middle America is good&hellip;as with most radicals they never seem to realize the revolution consumes its own. </p>

			<p>if this man becomes president, it is time for white in america to wake up and draw battle lines. decrease in size,declare certain bordering states a white nation, call a constitutional convention and elect a white president for that nation. if this means all out warfare against the federal government so be it. this notion of a multicultural nation just will not work, unless minorities comprise less than 20 percent of the nation with whites in charge. otherwise it will not work with whites in the minority. there is obviously so much white hatred by minorities that whites will be slaughtered by the millions. just look at the history of haiti, zimbabwa, and south africa. if  minorities are in charge, there will be no rule of law, no judicial system, no fairness, only corruption. etc. start organizing now.</p>

			<p>&#8220;What makes you think America can buck that trend?&#8221; </p>
<p>Apparently such nebulous concepts as &#8220;American values&#8221;, the &#8220;American dream&#8221;, and the &#8220;American spirit&#8221;, that the media and public school teachers love to talk about. Didn&rsquo;t you know? American soil has a property that magically makes everything turn out alright. And as soon as one becomes an American citizen, they automatically inherit and become part of the &#8220;American tradition&#8221;.</p>
