<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>The U.S. government has spent more than $51 million over the past four summers flying nearly 64,000 illegal immigrants home to Mexico City.</p>
<p>The flights are intended to break the smuggling cycle and reduce the desert death count. But evidence shows the binational Interior Repatriation Program has not made any substantial difference in border smuggling or desert deaths. And the principal beneficiary is a Mexican airline contracted to operate the twice-daily flights out of Tucson, critics say.</p>
<p>In the 362 days the voluntary flights were offered, during 2004-2007, the bodies of 342 illegal immigrants were discovered along Arizona&rsquo;s stretch of the U.S-Mexico border &mdash; nearly one per day, Southern Arizona medical examiners&rsquo; records show. The yearly totals recorded by the U.S. Border Patrol show that the number of border deaths each year since the program started in 2004 has been higher than in any of the previous years.</p>
<p>Taking just the number of bodies handled by the Pima County medical examiner, and comparing 2001-2003, before the repatriation program started, with 2004-2007, the number of bodies found hasn&rsquo;t decreased.</p>
<p>&#8220;The repatriation efforts have not stopped deaths. There&rsquo;s not even a decrease in deaths,&#8221; said Jennifer Allen, director of Border Action Network, a Tucson-based immigrants-rights organization. &#8220;This continues to be this deadly, exorbitantly costly shell game.&#8221;</p>
<p>The program &mdash; launched in July 2004 after the U.S and Mexican governments agreed on terms &mdash; is designed to separate illegal immigrants from smugglers by flying them to Mexico City rather than busing them to Nogales, where they are left at the border and susceptible to smugglers awaiting them with offers to try again. Those who participate also get bus transportation from Mexico City to their hometowns in Mexico.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Through the first two weeks of the program this year, 3,615 illegal immigrants have taken the flights home, she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s 3,600 individuals who we know are not subject to extreme heat in the desert, to traffickers and smugglers who don&rsquo;t have their safety in mind,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We&rsquo;ve seen smugglers and traffickers right there at the border who are only interested in making a buck, waiting to see if they can exploit the individuals.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Money to Mexico</b></p>
<p>Another criticism is that the United States pays nearly the entire tab &mdash; in 2007 Mexico paid $190,000 to provide staffing for the program &mdash; and a big chunk of the money lands in the hands of a Mexican airline: AeroMexico.</p>
<p>CSI Aviation Services of Albuquerque, which has the federal contract, partners with AeroMexico, which operates the twice-daily flights out of Tucson International Airport, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The discrepancy is likely explained by two factors, said Judith Gans, immigration-policy program manager at the University of Arizona&rsquo;s Udall Center for Studies in Public Policy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&rsquo;s paying reflects both the capacity to pay and the interest in stopping illegal immigration,&#8221; Gans said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Thousands turn down offer</b></p>
<p>The program is voluntary, and every year thousands of illegal immigrants turn down the plane ticket home and hop on the bus back to Nogales, presumably to try again.</p>
<p>An average of 176 illegal immigrants per day have taken the flights home in the past four years. That accounts for only 20 percent of the Mexican illegal border crossers apprehended daily in the Border Patrol&rsquo;s Tucson Sector in July-September over the past four years, agency figures show. Illegal immigrants from countries other than Mexico cannot take the flights to Mexico City, nor can illegal immigrants with criminal records.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Small portion of budget</b></p>
<p>U.S. officials consider it money well spent because it keeps those who take the flights safe, and, as Nantel says, there is no cost on human life.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Annual money spent on the program accounts for less than 1 percent of the Department of Homeland Security budget, Gans said. That said, the $51.6 million could have been more wisely spent on a program that targets the root causes of illegal immigration, she said.</p>
<p>The flights home do no harm and likely reduce the odds of dying for the people taking the flights, but the numbers clearly show it hasn&rsquo;t stopped the death toll, Gans said.</p>
<p>&#8220;All of these enforcement efforts are going to make a difference at the margin, but anytime the laws are so fundamentally out of alignment with the economic incentives and forces, the economic incentives are going to overwhelm the system,&#8221; Gans said.</p>

			<p>I was living in Tucson when this happened.  I don&rsquo;t know a single person who supported this.  I still wonder how programs like this make it through the government.  Are they really that stupid?</p>

<p>I should have stopped reading there. I wonder how long until that phrase becomes part of the lexicon?</p>
<p>Actually, I think the flights are a good idea. It would be better idea, however, if they didn&rsquo;t come here in the first place. </p>

			<p>Wasting the taxpayers money has been a long-time, a very long-time tradition in Washington. If small nations like Switzerland, Holland, etc. had operated the way the U.S. does, they would have been poor years ago. It seems it has finally caught up with us, also. And as the old saying goes, &#8220;the bigger they are the harder they fall.&#8221; God help America to survive its apathetic people and corrupt leaders.</p>

			<p>About $800 each? A cruise ship with all the amenities would cost half that amount. A Chinese freighter, about $200 per ton. </p>
<p>Making sure they never set foot on America soil in the first place? Priceless.</p>

<p>How about just shutting down the border and enforcing our immigration laws, then these people wouldn&rsquo;t be coming in the first place.</p>

			<p>Economic forces are just another excuse used by those who have no regard for USA immigration law enforcement.   The time has come to enforce the law or &#8216;We The People&rsquo; will have lost US to foreigners.  All those who enter US need to be docuemented OR they do not belong here.  Mexico needs to be fined and the President of Mexico needs to be prosecuted for economic poverty and joblessness while aristocracy props up narcoMexico. USA can and will secure its borders.  USA can and will overcome the narcos because this is the real evil.  Keeping millions in poverty and sending them to USA is evil.  USA needs better PR awareness of WHO really is to blame for millions of ignorant illiterate peasants.  V</p>

<p>And a whole lot more fun. Has anyone done the math on this thing to see what the cost of those plane tickets are individually? It seems to me a ticket from Texas isn&rsquo;t but a few hundred dollars to Mexico City, been a long time for me though. Any help here?</p>

			<p>The $51 million is what a fighter jet would cost, but that makes it a bit under $800 to fly each of the criminal alien invaders home.  It cost the US government approximately $120,000 to lock me up for three years, so incarcerating the criminal alien invaders for two years each - the usual sentence for illegal reentry in federal court - would be just over five billion dollars, or the price of an aircraft carrier or a space shuttle.</p>
<p>I think it is well-worth $800 each to not have them driving drunk down our roads without insurance, raping underage girls and lowering wages in an already depressed job market.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the US taxpayer should have to foot the bill, however.  The employers who hire them should be subjected to total asset forfeiture.  That would mean they lose their businesses and all businesses assets, their homes and all of the contents, vehicles and other chattel property, all bank accounts, stocks, retirement savings like 401(k) and IRA accounts - in short, everything they own.  This could be done under existing laws.  Money laundering law says that since money is fungible, one dollar of dirty money entering a bank account or a household budget contaminates all of the clean money.  Employers of criminal alien invaders are destroying the white middle class, and with it the country.  We can&rsquo;t execute them for treason at this time, but existing laws certainly allow us to bankrupt them.</p>

			<p>I forgot to mention something: when Tucson&rsquo;s local media covered the first flight to Mexico, the illegals were happy as hell. None ever flew on a plane before. They were all smiles. They even waved at the camera&rsquo;s as they boarded the plane.</p>
<p>It is time the US treats illegals the same way Mexico treats theirs.</p>

			<p>Demand oil from the foreign countries as reparations.  It is our right and duty to do so.  Stop their invasion via mass protest.  Be aggressive and demanding as more and more and more people are joining the mass protest movement against unwelcomed, unwanted, and invading foreign people.  Tell them to get the hell out.  I truly believe we the people shoud sue the oppressive Government that has not protected our constitutional rights and demand reparations for the American citizens who have been screwed by foreign invasion.</p>
