						<p>All pupils aged between 11 and 14 will be taught about the slave trade and the British empire when term begins next month to help them understand modern-day issues such as immigration.</p>
<p>The two subjects, aimed at highlighting the influence of ethnic minorities, will join the two world wars and the Holocaust as periods that must form part of the history syllabus.</p>
<p>Schoolchildren will learn about the roles of William Wilberforce, the MP who campaigned for the abolition of slavery, and Olaudah Equiano, a former slave who drew attention to the horrors of the trade after buying his freedom and writing an autobiography.</p>
<p>They will also be taught about the origins of the empire, with one unit looking at rise and fall of the Mughals in India and the arrival of the British. Another is titled &#8220;How was it that, by 1900, Britain controlled nearly a quarter of the world?&#8221;</p>
<p>Kevin Brennan, the children&rsquo;s minister, said: &#8220;Although we may be ashamed to admit it, the slave trade is an integral part of British history. It is inextricably linked to trade, colonisation, industrialisation and the British Empire.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is important that children learn about this and its links to wider world history, such as the American civil rights movement &mdash; the repercussions of which are still being felt today. That is why the slave trade will join the British Empire, the two world wars and the Holocaust as compulsory parts of the secondary school history curriculum from this September.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under the guidelines 25 per cent of the course must cover British history.</p>
<p>There will also be a change of emphasis away from historical dates to learning about themes &mdash; such as religion and social issues &mdash; which could be relevant to other subjects.</p>
<p>Mick Waters, director of curriculum at the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, said the revised history curriculum for pupils in England gives a broader view of the subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;Core British history such as both the world wars is present, but it also includes curricular content which provides the opportunity for pupils to explore the social, cultural, religious and ethnic roots of modern society,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Black history is not just about slavery &mdash; it is much broader than that. It is about the contribution that black and Asian people have made throughout history. The benefits are that pupils gain a better appreciation of the multicultural society around them and the contribution they can make.&#8221;</p>
<p>The change follows a comprehensive overhaul of the secondary curriculum.</p>
<p>According to a Government briefing document one of the aims of the switch is to &#8220;put immigration, the Commonwealth and the legacy of the Empire into a clear historical context.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This can help pupils prepare for life in a diverse and multi-ethnic society&#8221;.</p>
<p>However, the decision last year to omit Sir Winston Churchill from the list of figures that must be studied in history angered traditionalists.</p>
<p>Michael Gove, shadow secretary for children, schools and families, said: &#8220;Winston Churchill is the towering figure of 20th century British history. His fight against facsism was Britain&rsquo;s finest hour. Our national story can&rsquo;t be told without Churchill at the centre.&#8221;</p>
<p>A QCA spokesman said teachers were aware that they would be unable to teach the Second World War without mentioning Churchill.<br/>

			<p>Instead of mentioning Winston Churchill cover something else, like black american servicemen stationed in England. Servicemen raping, assaulting and rioting. Oops, I&rsquo;m sorry (revision mode on) black servicemen fighting fascism abroad but instead becoming innocent victims of white racism in England.</p>

			<p>As it is taught black history is not history. It is nothng more that propaganda full of lies and distortions. When my son was in the 7th grade he was required to go on a field trip to the so-called &#8220;Civil Rights Institute&#8221; in Birmingham, Alabama. I asked him what it like and all he said was that they preached about how bad white people were.  He then started to cry and went on to say that if black people were so good and innocent, why were he and his friends threatened, beaten, and robbed for years in elementary school. He went to say that he never told us about it because the black kids would always say &#8220;we know where your parents are and we&rsquo;ll kill them if you tell&#8221;.</p>
<p>Needless to say, he never went back to that school and finished high school in a specialty private high school and is now a highly regarded graduate student working on his PhD. Many of his earlier black classmates are probably in prison or dead.</p>

			<p>If I were black, I think I&rsquo;d rather that any reference to slavery be omitted in every book possible, because it places blacks in an extremely bad light.  I mean, isn&rsquo;t anybody with half a brain going to wonder how a people who allowed themselves to be enslaved so easily could ever be thought of as on a par with other races?</p>
<p>By constantly concentrating on black history time and again won&rsquo;t that be a constant reminder to all that these people have lived a stone-age existence for centuries with zero advancements of their own?</p>
<p>I mean, always harping on slavery is great if blacks want to be perpetual victims, but right along with perpetual victims is the nagging realization by most people that blacks are just not up to par with the rest of the world. </p>

			<p>&#8220;All pupils aged between 11 and 14 will be taught about the slave trade and the British empire when term begins next month to help them understand modern-day issues such as immigration.&#8221;</p>
<p>Question: How does anyone use &#8220;black slavery by Britain&#8221; to understand &#8220;contemporary immigration to Britain&#8221;? That logic jump is as silly as using the role of the &#8220;Germanic tribes  defeating Rome&#8221; to &#8220;help German students understand Turkish immigration&#8221;.</p>
<p>I sense more P.C. indoctrination - but I&rsquo;m curious:<br/>
* Will they cover the thousands of sub-Saharan Africans/Arabs, various sub-Saharan African kingdoms and tribes that profited from capturing/selling their kinsmen into slavery?<br/>
* Will they cover the estimated 30 million sub-Saharan Africans sold throughout the Arab world between the first Arab explorations of Africa down to the 19th Century?<br/>
* Will they cover the role the British Navy played in abolishing the slave trade, despite the pleas of many sub-Saharan African chieftains and kings to continue this profitable practice?<br/>
* Will they cover the thousands of British men and women throughout history that were sold into slavery to Islamic countries, after being captured by Islamic corsairs?</p>
<p>I think not.</p>

<p>Dinesh D&rsquo;Souza claimed this isn&rsquo;t about &#8216;victimhood&rsquo; at all. In his book &#8216;illiberal education&rsquo; he wrote, &#8220;Thus the victim becomes a victimizer while continuing to hold superior moral credentials&#8221;. </p>

			<p>I bet whites would be a lot less hostile if they had their own specific white-history also and not simply another version of this hate-the white man history displayed here. It&rsquo;s like that movie &#8216;Over the Top&rsquo; with Syvester Stallone. The young kid is kind of mad and bitter in the cab of a truck saying, &#8220;any stupid guy can drive a truck&#8221; Then his dad says, &#8220;It&rsquo;s so easy, you do it then&#8221; and lets him drive. Then the kid is quite happy and excited about it. </p>

			<p>The new masters substitute their version of history for the old history of the conquered people.  Whether your conquerers are of your race or not, the principle is the same.  <br/>
     When the Japanese decided to incorporate Okinawa into the Japanese State, they gave them a new history.<br/>
     When the Soviets occupied Eastern Europe, they gave them a new history.  <br/>
     When the Yankees wanted to crush the South, they invented a new history, and crammed it down their throats.  And our own Reds are doing the same.  This fraudulent history is as clearly the mark of a traitor as black and white stripes identify a zebra.  And as a teacher, I know that the Reds are as attuned to non-PC history as I am to their lies.  They and I can smell each other out as readily as male dogs can find a female in heat.  I&rsquo;m glad they can&rsquo;t have me arrested, yet.</p>

			<p>England today is the result of good intentions gone awry and aristocratic inbreeding.  Throw in the occasional oafishly inept politician like Churchill and you get what England has become.  Outside a small minority of patriotic Englishmen, most of the country is sliding into a hopeless morass of racial chaos.  In another fifty years, England will closely resemble Brazil&hellip;with bad weather and worse food.  Ipso facto.</p>

			<p>about 1-3 million Europeans were enslaved by the Barbary Pirates -many from Cornwall. Will schoolchildren learn about this? of course not. </p>

			<p>No Winston Churchill? Have they lost their minds? What is it going to take for people to wake up and fight this rewriting of history? What would Americans say if it was decreed that schools could no longer include Dwight Eisenhower, Patton or FDR (what little they do include anyways) anymore? </p>
<p>Its already close to that point, my high school American History class textbook had more pages devoted to the plight of Blacks during WWII than it did about the entire war itself. The whole book was written with that slant in mind. How long will people just sit back and let their history be changed by self-haters?</p>

			<p>Oafishly inept Churchill? Has somebody been studying black history<br/>
again? Churchill, the gentleman who called the Muslims the most degenerate cult on earth, who was all for the return of all ethnic minorities from all over eastern Europe to their country of origin<br/>
for the very simple reason that any ethnic minority is a potential problem in the event of political or demographic change. Having said that, a thorough lesson of slavery has long been called for.<br/>
For almost 600 years, slavers ravaged the Mediterranean, going as far afield as Ireland, emptying 100&rsquo;s of coastal villages for the slave markets of Cairo, Constantinople and the rest of North Africa. Nor should the recruitment of the janizary forces from Muslim occupied Christian lands ever be forgotten. Not to be forgotten either are the extremely high prices obtained for Georgian Christians.</p>

			<p>Why, because racial tensions aren&rsquo;t high enough?  It may be of value to state that there are more African blacks in the UK now than Afro-Carribean, people whose ancestors were never slaves of the white man and, in many cases, may themselves have been involved in the slave trade.  Of course, this is unlikely to be made clear. I bet also the Muslim slave trade won&rsquo;t be touched upon either, for fear of offending Muslims.  </p>

			<p>Again, as has been pointed out by several writers, not in the Main Stream Press however, Britain is the headquarters of some very devious politics that affects the Western World in a negative way. Something is terribly wrong. There are parts of the puzzle that just do not fit when it comes to modern day Britain.</p>

			<p>I think the headline of this article is misleading, and designed to provoke a response one way or another. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with learning about the slave trade - surely children should learn about the Empire, and slavery did play an important role in the earlier stages of the Empire.</p>
<p>What is wrong is disseminating it as &#8216;black history&rsquo;, as this gives licence to &#8216;black pride&rsquo;, white guilt, and notions that British people &#8216;owe blacks&rsquo; some recompense for slavery. This latter sentiment was the primary excuse used by advocates of multiracialism in the Sixties, and it&rsquo;s woefully obsolete as anyone bearing witness to the constant decline of African nations since the end of colonialism can testify. Surely, on balance, children should also learn of the civil, cultural and technological benefits that the British (and other whites) brought Africa? This might give white children a clue as to why black people choose to live in Britain in the first place, or why African-Americans are in no rush to desert the country they were dragged to by force and return to their ancestral lands in Africa.</p>
<p>Imagine if the tables were turned: had my ancestors been enslaved by West Africans and I had been born in, say, Senegal, I would SWIM back to Britain if I had to! Carribean and American black don&rsquo;t seem in any hurry to do this themselves, and not just because the Atlantic is a more challenging swim&hellip;</p>
<p>Black history is only helpful towards understanding modern Britain in that it explains how multiracialism befell our nation. It hints as to how blacks were able to set foot in Britain in the first place. If the tide of multiracialism was to be reversed, black history would be obsolete as our present race problem would be nonexistent, and thus its origins would requie no explanation.</p>

			<p><i>Oafishly inept Churchill?  </i><br/>
Yes!</p>
<p><i>Churchill, the gentleman who called the Muslims the most degenerate cult on earth, who was all for the return of all ethnic minorities from all over eastern Europe to their country of origin&hellip;. <br/>

Ciccio, I&rsquo;m aware you&rsquo;re a Canadian of German origin.  Your Canadian/British brainwashing is showing here.  Those unfortunates are still stuck in reliving WW2,  and Churchill remains an unquestioned god on a pedestal for them.   In  point of fact, he&rsquo;s responsible for much of the situation that they are living with today, though they refuse to see that.   You ought to check out his hatred for Germans, his needless bombings of a prostrate Germany and his determination to &#8220;make them burn and suffer&#8221;.</p>
<p>I can agree with the rest of your post (yours are always interesting),  but Xenophon was right about Churchill who started every day drunk and barely knew what he was doing throughout the war  (by his own son&rsquo;s statement).  Was he a useful tool?</p>
<p>As for returning &#8220;all ethnic minorities to their countries of origin&#8221;, he had the opportunity to do exactly that when Prime Minister in the 50s.  Yet, when asked to do so, he elected to do absolutely NOTHING.  The Jamaican/ThirdWorld invasion had already begun in 1948 and it was taking place before his eyes.  Churchill did hold a number of strong racial/eugenic views (though quite ordinary for that time), but if you judge him by his  public actions, not his private opinions, he comes up drastically short.</p>

			<p>If you want to teach black &#8220;history&#8221; included should be the current slavery problem in Africa and Haiti.   </p>
