						<p>A group of Native Hawaiians claiming to be the state&rsquo;s legitimate rulers occupied the grounds of a historic palace for two hours before being arrested by state officers in the second recent takeover of its kind.</p>
<p>A staff member of the Iolani Palace said she was assaulted and slightly injured during the takeover Friday night and then snubbed by city police who claimed that they didn&rsquo;t have jurisdiction. Gov. Linda Lingle said Saturday that there would be an investigation into the police response to the takeover.</p>
<p>A group of men, wearing red shirts with &#8220;security&#8221; stenciled in yellow on the back, took over the grounds by chaining the gates of the palace next to the State Capitol and posted signs saying, &#8220;Property of the Kingdom of Hawaiian Trust.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kippen de Alba Chu, executive director of the Friends of Iolani Palace, said he and other staff members were locked down in the palace and a nearby administration building during the takeover.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;ve got a king, and the king wants to sit on the throne,&#8221; de Alba Chu said.</p>
<p>State law officers climbed over the fence a couple of hours after the takeover began and made about 20 arrests. The palace, normally open to tours, will remain closed during the weekend to assess any damage and to ensure its security, police said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The takeover of the palace &mdash; built in 1882, when the islands were ruled by a monarchy &mdash; came on Admission Day, a state holiday marking Hawaii&rsquo;s admission to the United States on August 21, 1959.</p>
<p>Several Native Hawaiian organizations have rival claims to sovereignty over the islands. Another group calling itself the Hawaiian Kingdom Government occupied the palace grounds April 30 and has been getting permits to set up on the grounds each week since then. That group claims to be operating a functioning government from the palace grounds.</p>

			<p>Everything I read on AmRen about Hawaii only reinforces what I have long believed in my gut. Hawaii should NEVER have been made an American state. It is a bad fit at best. It would have been better to have given Hawaii its independence while retaining a 99-year naval lease on Pearl Harbor.</p>

<p>For some irony, I read that Obama supports a bill that will give the Native Hawaiians a separate government, based on blood. This would likely lead to seccession, by (at least some of) the Hawaiian Islands, for the Indigenous tribe. Even its racially liberal advocates admit it!</p>

			<p>Let the King and his people have their country back!</p>
<p>The Hawiians never wanted to be part of the U.S.</p>
<p>Obviously, they still desire their sovreignty.</p>

			<p>Hawaiians voted to become part of the United States.  Another country would have taken them over, not gave to them what the American government has.  Do they realize when they are no longer part of the United States, all the welfare programs go too?  Step back from the meth and think it over.</p>

			<p>Seeing as how most navy ships can be run off noo-kya-ler (oops, had a Bush moment: it&rsquo;s &#8220;NUCLEAR!&#8221;) power, and B-2 bombers and other aircraft can be refueled in flight, what do we need Hawaii for anyway? Surely not the marijuana farming; California has them beat. As &#8220;9:09 AM&#8221; alluded to, it&rsquo;s not for methamphetamine production; when you mix the chemicals correctly, meth cooks itself, as any number of high-school chemistry flunkees have found out. </p>
<p>And &#8220;9:09 AM&#8221; and other anonymous posters, please pick a screen name. The FBI, USSS, DHS, etc. know that this site is mostly a bunch of White guys bellyaching about how bad things are, who don&rsquo;t actually DO anything about it. You&rsquo;re safe. (Yes, I am aware that I fit into that category myself. That was not a criticism, merely a statement of fact.)  </p>

			<p>This will be a blow to the multicultural American Empire. An empire which George Washington the Great never wish for the USA when he helped form it.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve stated this before on Amren but I believe that the US should allow not only the Hawaiian Islands but Guam, Philippines, Puerto Rico and our other territories to part company. I say this for numerous reasons, not least of which it is no longer economically justifiable in retaining them. Let them go.</p>

			<p>We were playing golf in Weilea a few weeks ago and a carload of Native Hawaiians yelled out the window &#8220;You F&hellip;.ing Howlies go home&#8221;.If they do get their soverenity back I want everything that the Howlie brought over to be taken back from them.Including toilet paper and the wheel.<br>
Polanesians are some of the fattests and ugliest people on the planet</p>

			<p>While we&rsquo;re on the subject, I&rsquo;d like to pass on <a href="https://www.lewrockwell.com/buppert/buppert11.html" rel="nofollow">this excellent essay</a>, along with <a href="https://www.lewrockwell.com/buppert/buppert12.html" rel="nofollow">its follow-up</a>. I liked the original so much I e-mailed the author with my praise!</p>
<p>I still think Alaska will be the 1st state to withdraw from the Yankee Empire. It&rsquo;s geographically isolated from the rest of the nation, it has <a href="https://www.akip.org/" rel="nofollow">a well-established independence movement</a>, its residents take the 2nd Amendment very seriously, and its climate &amp; terrain are tailor-made for guerrilla warfare.</p>
<p>I become more convinced with each passing day that whichever megalomaniac wins in November will ultimately wish he&rsquo;d lost, as he will go down in history as the <i>last</i> president of the US. Not exactly a plus on one&rsquo;s résumé.</p>

			<p>Reply to Jasper:</p>
<p> The USA has today adopted foreign policies that would have horrified Washington and the founding fathers. The hundreds of overseas U.S. military bases and endless &#8220;entangling alliances&#8221; were the very last thing those great men wanted for this country. To say nothing of the imperial presidency and bloated all-intrusive federal government.</p>

			<p>To the poster that thinks Alaska would leave the Union first, keep in mind, Alaska gets like $2.50 for every $1 in taxes they pay in.  They have some crafty politicians that keep Alaska swimming in tax dollars.  Now, that said, we keep messing with the Russians, and who knows what they will offer the Alaskans.  Since Fancy Nancy likes the Caribou more than the people she is supposed to represent, there is a lot of money to be made in Alaska.</p>

			<p>Before the coup, Hawaii was supervised by Germany, Britain and the USA.  If Hawaii had retained nominal independance before World War One, German interests would have been quickly taken over by Britain and Japan, the way Kaiser Wilhelmsland (northern Papua New Guinea) and the Marshalls and Carolines were.  A Japanese military presence on the Hawaiian Islands would have made for some very unpleasant fighting there during World War Two.  </p>
<p>I have always read the articles posted here about Hawaiian seccessionists because their demands really seem to be code for wanting the non-Polynesians to leave.  What would an Polynesian-only independant Hawaii look like?  Firstly, the business and professional class is white, Japanese, Koreans or Chinese.  These would be forced out, leaving Hawaii in a terrible recession.  Second, with the military bases closed, a major employer of civilian workers (the US Department of Defense) would be gone, causing ripple-effects thoughout the retail and service sectors of the economy.  Third, with the massive economic slump, the remaining tax base would not be able to support the infrastructure; this would demolish the tourism industry.  Converting Hawaii into a seedier version of Puerto Rico does not seem to be in the best interests of anyone, especially not the native Polynesians, who live in a state much more prosperous than any they could have created themselves.</p>
<p>That said, part of me does like the idea of Hawaiian independence, because it would provide a useful precedent for other states/regions to secceed from Washington&rsquo;s inept and criminally parasitical rule.</p>
