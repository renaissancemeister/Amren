						<p>
							More than half of Ottawa&rsquo;s 600 confirmed street gang members were born outside of Canada, according to Ottawa police intelligence.
						</p>
						<p>
							In a report published in the RCMP Gazette magazine, Ottawa police Staff Sgt. Mike Callaghan of the guns and gang section said that 314 of the city&rsquo;s 600 confirmed gang members were born outside the country.
						</p>
						<p>
							And the membership of Ottawa&rsquo;s two &#8220;predominant&#8221; gangs &mdash; the West Side Bloods and the Ledbury Banff Crips &mdash; is made up of 57 different nationalities, according to the report.
						</p>
						<p>
							The police intelligence is based on data collected in January 2006, although a report on the state of Ottawa&rsquo;s street gangs commissioned by Crime Prevention Ottawa and released this year found that the number of confirmed gang members in the city remained roughly the same as earlier statistics.
						</p>
						<p>
							According to Staff Sgt. Callaghan&rsquo;s report, 95 per cent of Ottawa&rsquo;s gang members are male &mdash; only 30 female gang members have been identified &mdash; with an average age of 17 to 25 years.
						</p>
						<p>
							Only 56 confirmed gang members were under 18, although recent reports have suggested a trend of street gangs using children as young as eight to sell drugs or run guns because they are immune from prosecution.
						</p>
						<p>
							The demographics of Ottawa&rsquo;s 19 confirmed street gangs are emerging as Ottawa police hailed the deportation of two alleged members of the Ledbury Banff Crips to their home countries as a positive development, sending a strong message to current and would-be gangsters that their stay in Canada could be in jeopardy if they get involved in organized crime.
						</p>
						<p>
							Remy Maliragora, 27, was deported to Rwanda last week following convictions for crimes ranging from assault causing bodily harm to robbery and forcible entry, while 23-year-old Sharmarke Ali was deported in January.
						</p>
						<p>
							While Mr. Maliragora remained adamant he was not a member of the gang, evidence presented to an immigration and refugee board hearing suggested he frequently wore gang colours and was involved in a robbery where the victims were told &#8220;not to f&mdash; with the Crips.&#8221;
						</p>
						<p>
							During Mr. Maliragora&rsquo;s immigration hearing, the former head of the Ottawa police gang section, Sgt. John Medeiros, testified that the Ledbury Banff Crips were formed in 1999 and consist of between 70 and 100 members.
						</p>
						<p>
							The gang has a &#8220;corporate identity,&#8221; including territory, leadership and a &#8220;loose hierarchical structure&#8221; with &#8220;original gangsters&#8221; at the top and ordinary members below.
						</p>
						<p>
							Sgt. Medeiros told the hearing that members of the Ledbury Banff Crips typically wore dark blue bandannas, although one senior member told him that the gang also wears black bandannas when they go on &#8220;special missions.&#8221;
						</p>
						<p>
							Ottawa police Sgt. Anthony Costantini of the guns and gangs section said yesterday that the West Side Bloods have a similar-sized membership as their rivals, and were formed in the early part of this decade sometime after the creation of the Ledbury Banff Crips.
						</p>
						<p>
							Sgt. Costantini said police are noticing new trends emerging in Ottawa&rsquo;s street gangs, particularly in terms of how they are formed and the breakdown of traditional cultural-based allegiances in favour of ties based on the neighbourhoods where they live and operate.
						</p>
						<p>
							This hybridization of Ottawa&rsquo;s street gangs is leading individuals from a wide array of cultural backgrounds to work together to further their criminal enterprises, which revolve predominantly around the sale of crack cocaine, Sgt. Costantini said.
						</p>
						<p>
							&#8220;The downside for them is less loyalty,&#8221; he said, adding the result has been some violent internal rivalries.
						</p>
						<p>
							&#8220;With less loyalty you get fewer Bloods versus Crips and more Blood versus Blood or Crip versus Crip things,&#8221; said Sgt. Costantini.
						</p>
						<p>
							Sgt. Costantini said police rarely see violence between the two gangs, who largely respect each other&rsquo;s turf.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Ledbury Banff Crips are based predominantly in neighbourhoods in the south and east sides of the city, including Overbrook and the Heatherington, Heron, Walkley and Russell roads areas.
						</p>
						<p>
							The West Side Bloods operate in areas around Ritchie Street, Ramsey Crescent and Grenon and Carling avenues.
						</p>
						<p>
							&#8220;They stay in their own areas,&#8221; said Sgt. Costantini.
						</p>
						<p>
							However, unlike other organized crime groups, like the Hells Angels, the membership and leadership in Ottawa gangs is &#8220;fluid&#8221; and doesn&rsquo;t involve junior members financing more senior members.
						</p>
						<p>
							&#8220;If you are selling drugs for the Bloods, it doesn&rsquo;t go up the food chain,&#8221; he said.
						</p>
						<p>
							Sgt. Costantini said bandannas are still worn by Ottawa gang members, although they have been replaced by athletic clothing featuring the logos of sports teams. Often gang members will wear team colours that are similar to their gang colours.
						</p>
						<p>
							He added that less than two per cent of the graffiti in Ottawa is gang-related.
						</p>
						<p>
							&#8220;If you can&rsquo;t read it, it is not gang stuff,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They want stuff to be seen.&#8221;<br />

							When these groups are addressed in North America they are called gangs. We are told to feel bad for them and give them a break because it&rsquo;s not their fault. When they are addressed in foreign countries, they are called militias. Everything they do is evil and we are encouraged to destroy entire neighborhoods in order to kill them.

							In a twisted way, this is an example where diversity and multiculturalism is working. Nevertheless, the fact has not changed as this article shows that immigrants, no doubt from a few certain countries or regions of the world, are far more likely to engage in violent criminal activity.

							&#8220;More than half of Ottawa&rsquo;s 600 confirmed street gang members were born outside of Canada, according to Ottawa police intelligence.&#8221;
						</p>
						<p>
							And a good portion of the rest, who were born in Canada, are descended from the Third World immigration waves that have &#8220;enriched Canada with diversity&#8221; in the past 30 years. In fact, substitute just about any city in Australia, Britain or the USA for Ottawa in Canada, and you&rsquo;ll see the same process at work. The UK and Canada are thus heading for non-White majorities almost as fast as the USA, with Australia just a couple years behind.
						</p>
						<p>
							All this has been making Canada, once among the most polite and good-natured countries in the world, all but unlivable. On my business trips to countries like Denmark, Italy, Germany, Austria and Finland &mdash; all with stricter immigration policies than the USA, Australia, the UK and Canada, and which favor their co-ethnics abroad &mdash; I frequently encounter new citizens who were originally from Canada, Australia, the UK and even the USA. The reason isn&rsquo;t hard to discern &mdash; Canadians have already seen once-bustling cities like Toronto and Winnipeg overrun by Third World migration, and when even Ottawa starts to succumb to this process, they can see the same process overrunning the entire country overall.

							What&rsquo;s hybrid about it, sarge? I mean, they&rsquo;re all non-white types who are much closer to their tribal roots than they are to the honkies and their technology.
						</p>
						<p>
							Putting a suit and tie on them isn&rsquo;t going to mask their behavior.
						</p>
						<p>
							Most all the posts I&rsquo;ve read from Canada from whites are in favor of &#8220;diversity,&#8221; so I&rsquo;m guessing this deplorable situation is something they don&rsquo;t mind.
						</p>
						<p>
							Well, the gangs and crime are now firmly entrenched and Canadian deportation of a few of the worst isn&rsquo;t going to matter one bit, because as time goes by crime and violence will increase and the gangs will grow.
						</p>
						<p>
							A masterful job has been accomplished by making most whites eager to applaud and participate in their own destruction.
						</p>
						<p>
							I&rsquo;m convinced that the only whites in the world that have an ounce of sense or gumption are the people on this board&hellip;..and those who agree but are not yet here&hellip;..and the rest are all drooling idiots.

							Just three decades ago, the only &#8220;gangs&#8221; that Canada&rsquo;s capital city had to contend with, were the Mafia and Hell&rsquo;s Angels. Now with 3rd world mass immigration brought in by the federal politicians of that city, they&rsquo;re reaping their <i>just desserts</i>.

							Canada&rsquo;s diversity problem strikes a red light because the situation shows that greater violence can be imported when several nationalities are represented in one area.

							It may be small consolation considering our own problems are of a far greater magnitude, but at least we can be thankful for the operatives of &#8220;The underground railway&#8221; shipping the ancestors of the other half off to Canada.

							It&rsquo;s a shame that all those &#8220;drooling idiots&#8221; cant experience a cataltytic event&hellip;some trip, conflict, epiphany, which would wake them to the stark reality that their world was ending. <br />
							For me, it came in stages&hellip;it took about fifteen years. And I always had some racial sense. <br />
							My first reip to Los Angeles in 1990 was a jolt. But Kalifornia seemed a long way away from my home state, and when i returned, i somehow believed the hordes of LA could be kept at bay. (Now, Denver, Houston, Dallas, Chicago, and even tiny farm towns, look more Mexican today than Los Angeles did in 1990!<br />
							My next trip to Kalifornia in 2005 was literally like visiting five different countries-none of them Western. Then i returned to my hometown and was suddenly more aware of the daily surge in Mestizo infiltration. It took living in Kalifornia to get sensitized. From that point forward, I was awake. <br />
							But the young, the indoctrinated, the sheltered, the less-than-individualistic&hellip;these people are likely to be the last to get a clue. Now i don&rsquo;t know how anyone can avoid the sight of Mestizos wherever they look, but, somehow, many whites seem to see through them. They need to be awakened, but everybody comes to realization at their own pace&hellip;even if it&rsquo;s too late.

							Canada&rsquo;s immigration policy seems determined to vault Canada into the (not so exclusive) status of Third World country. It&rsquo;s well on it&rsquo;s way.

							The rise of capital offenses, like rape and murder, has skyrocketed in all major Canadian cities, not just Ottawa. None of our cities are anywhere near as safe as they were twenty years ago. Still, the majority of traditional Canadians can&rsquo;t seem to make the link between the rising violent crime and immigration. The NWO and its state religion, multiculturalism, are well entrenched in this once beautiful country, and have absolutely nothing to fear from the descendants of the founding peoples.

							I must concur with &#8220;MITCH&#8221;. I, too, consider anyone who embraces the absurd p.c. slop dished out by our polticians and the media about the &#8216;joys of multi-cultural divesity&rsquo; to be a hopeless fool. It really does NOT take a doctorate degree in sociology or criminology to realize and accept the reality that Non-Whites commit by far, the MAJORITY of crime in the United States, Canada, Australia or the European nations. However, that anyone actually ADMITTING such an &#8216;inconvenient truth&rsquo; is automatically regarded as a hopless racist.
