						<p>Police on Thursday accused a Brazilian man of killing and dismembering his 17-year-old British girlfriend, taking pictures of her body parts with his cellphone and stuffing her torso in a suitcase.</p>
<p>Officers found the suitcase with the torso of Cara Marie Burke at the edge of a river Monday in this central Brazilian city, Goias state police inspector Jorge Moreira da Silva said.</p>
<p>Burke&rsquo;s boyfriend, Mohamed D&rsquo;Ali Carvalho Santos, 20, was arrested and charged with homicide Thursday after &ldquo;he confessed he cut her up and even photographed the body on his cellular phone,&rdquo; Silva said.</p>
<p>One photo appeared to have been taken in a bathroom shower stall, showing Burke&rsquo;s severed head placed on the chest of her torso along with a bloody butcher knife.</p>
<p>Silva said Santos confessed he killed Burke because she threatened to tell his parents he was a drug dealer addicted to cocaine, and she was considering turning him in to police.</p>
<p>After fatally stabbing Burke on Saturday, Santos left her body in the bathroom and went to a party, returning to dismember her the next day, the police inspector said.</p>
<p>Burke&rsquo;s family in England identified her from a tattoo that said &ldquo;Mum&rdquo; after images of the body were broadcast on TV, Silva said.</p>
<p>Burke met Santos in London, where his mother lives, Silva said. She had been in Brazil for about three months.</p>

			<p>Part Amazonian cannibal, part black.  There&rsquo;s boyfriend material for you!  Is this union that far above beastiality?  Maybe if British marxists didn&rsquo;t sabotage the British family, promoting multi-culturalism, promiscuous sex, and out-of-wedlock child birth, this young lady would have had a father to raise her right.  A healthy British nation would not allow itself to be colonized by third world miscreants.</p>

			<p>This is just another sad story of a naive white that is murdered for the cause of multiculturalism.  All whites need to be cautious about Brazilians.  Last year I saw a newstory about a white man from the US who met a Brazilian woman online and flew to Brazil to meet her with lots of cash.  She took him somewhere secluded where he was killed and robbed by her Brazilian boyfriend.</p>

			<p>I know this space is generally reserved for rolling our eyes and saying &#8220;I told ya so,&#8221; but this time I would like an education:  I don&rsquo;t know much about Brazil.  This chap&rsquo;s name is &#8220;Mohammed blahblahblah Santos.&#8221;  Arab first name, Spanish surname.  Is this guy an anomaly or are there a lot of the usual suspects in Brazil too?</p>

			<p>  Not only is this creature part black but he had a Muslim name. Between his blackness and his Islamistness we have a great canvass on which to create a murder and dismemberment.</p>
<p>Our white children are conditioned to be tolerant even of the worst the world has to offer and for some reason White girls tend to buy into the program much more willingly than males.  I suppose that there will be someone who will declare that this girl got what she deserved. She is a product of the society that we permitted to supplant the one that existed for centuries. We have only our unconsciousness and permissiveness to blame. We are guilty either of making our kids what they are today or of allowing others to do it.<br>
I have heard that the maximum penalty in Brazil is only 25 years regardless of the crime.</p>

			<p>We had a similar case here in Texas where a young white woman was chopped up by her black ex-boyfriend and cooked. Now I realize that some white men do horrible things too but it is so much more common among blacks. Why did this young lady&rsquo;s parents allow her to go to Brazil alone, I would never let my 17-year-old daughter go alone to another country.  A 17-year-old does not have the maturity to be traveling  halfway around the world by herself.</p>

			<p>It just struck me after reading this that I can&rsquo;t remember ever hearing of a case where a white man killed his black, underage, girlfriend and then proceeded to cut her body up.</p>
<p>The fact that is clear from this and other cases is that black people really hate white people.</p>

<p>No, I certainly don&rsquo;t say this, no victim is at fault, just the killer. However, others are right in that we have made our kids what they are and her parents were far too permissive.</p>

			<p>Look at her gentle facial features, fair complexion and sky blue eyes.  She definitely got more than she could handle by falling in love with this Muslim Brazilian person.    </p>
<p>We must have a public campaign in the West to educate White youth as to their value, emphasizing the many accomplishments of the White race.  We don&rsquo;t need to be arrogant toward other races, but our children need to know that Whites are important and deserve to exist.  In my opinion, Whites have been brainwashed in the West to dislike themselves and to lift up all other races but their own, and because of this combination of low self-esteem and altruism so many blithely marry non-White and bear non-White.</p>

			<p>The most dire consequences await white females who think &#8216;other&rsquo; races will treat them respectfully.  Media hides the examples.<br>
My observations define my attitudes.  I watch white women &amp; men <br>
&#8216;gamed&rsquo; everyday for marriage, citizenship, and most often just reproduction.  There is no word to describe the deceit of immigrating to formerly orderly white countries just to breed yourself into the culture and overcome it.  This is what I am watching.  Innocent girls being taken by old men and drug dealers. I have been thinking about starting a finishing school to train the young boys/girls what their country/schools are not teaching them.  Then I realized they have been indoctrinated by schools not to believe me.  It will cost many their lives.   V</p>

			<p>Seventeen years old, then seduced by this &#8220;exotic&#8221; creature who lures this naive young girl back to his own country so he can showcase his white conquest to his hometown pals was not enough. She had to suffer the worst indignity by being murdered, decapitated and dismembered by a person she apparently trusted with her life and who probably thought she could &#8220;save&#8221; from the perils of the illegal drug world.</p>
<p>If only these young women would learn discernment &#8220;in affairs of the heart&#8221;, they&rsquo;d have a greater chance of simply dying of old age, surrounded by several grandchildren.  </p>

			<p>The article gives a graphic and telling exposure of the sheer brutality socially conditioned whites face at the hands of blacks, hispanics, and asians of the multicultural and countercultural distinctions and those with gang affiliations.<br>
Beautiful white women from Britian, and Australia can be found traveling alone with black and muslim companions in the Middle East despite areas openly considered hot spots by the U.S. Navy.<br>
Internationally, the most beautiful and voluptuous women of European descent are most often the first to greet black and hispanic sailors when Navy ships arrive in port even when white women are meeting sailors for the first time.<br>

			<p>Yet another brainwashed, self-loathing White female bites the dust at the hands of multiculturalism.</p>
<p>Perhaps if the MSM would do their job and report, just once, all of the 15,000+ rapes of White women by blacks and other non-Whites every year, perhaps, just perhaps, ever-so-slightly, there may be the remote chance to save some of these White females&hellip;from themselves.</p>

<p>I think the latter is true. We have allowed our politicians and government to indoctrinate our schools and media with this tolerance/celebration of multi-culturalism laced with White guilt and total abandonment of our European-American culture. One can celebrate multi-culturalism in our country by going to the local Chinese restaurant or watching a foreign film, but not at the expense of eradicating our own culture. I see black kids wearing Black History month t-shirts with pictures of their leaders. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be awesome to see white kids wearing t-shirts celebrating our forefathers during European History month? Exactly.<br>
My wife and I agreed to homeschooling our children. Most folks at our church already do.</p>

			<p>Terribly sad, awful, preventable story. I see the term &#8220;brainwashing&#8221; here a lot and I agree that the media, schools, and society in general constantly promote diversity, but I don&rsquo;t understand why *so many* young people accept it. *I* have never done so no matter how much inculcation I was exposed to. Young, impressionable minds, I understand. But can they not see the difference between the races ANYWAY??</p>

			<p>In our ongoing war of black versus whites, white victims like this girl are 99% liberal and they have bought into the leftist propaganda lock, stock and barrel.</p>
<p>How many black male/white female killings have we read about over the last few years?  Somebody ought to research the data available on the approximate number of black/white relationships, from O.J. Simpson forward, and then obtain the number of killings, serious beatings and assaults, in all these cases in order to arrive at a percentage.   I&rsquo;m positive the figure will be dramatically higher than the percentage of white on white relationships.  </p>
<p>And if the information, plus the revelation of the high percentage of HIV among black males, doesn&rsquo;t warn these gullible liberal white girls away from blacks, then I think we can then say that whatever happens to these women is their own fault.  </p>
<p>The price of liberalism is a lack of awareness that often leads to death or injury.  Diversity not only is a weakness, it is wrong, and most certainly dangerous.  Let the buyer beware.</p>

<p>People on here forget that she was only 17, high school age. At this age, people are stupid and naive. That&rsquo;s why they should have adults looking out for them. I blame the killer but I also blame this girl&rsquo;s parents for allowing her to go. The parents would have been the ones to allow this and fund the trip. No parent in their right mind would allow their underage teenage daughter or son to go alone halfway around the world. </p>

			<p>Although its true that when you lie down with a dog your going to get up with fleas I am still inclined to blame the girl&rsquo;s family. Where were the parents? Where was her father? An older brother? Uncle? Someone who could have brought some sanity and race-realism to this dangerously naive young British girl. I must say that - EVEN TODAY - a lot of British people, especially females are still very naive about colored people, particularly blacks. Even 60 years after Labour betrayed the U.K. many Britons are still remarkably clued out. Sad.</p>

<p>Your reasoning could be correct.  However, I think there are other issues at play here.  </p>
<p>Some girls are brought up by liberal parents who will invite anything and anybody into their homes and pound into their young childrens&rsquo; minds that they are no different than the black guy who lives across town in the projects.</p>
<p>And then there are the girls who think they don&rsquo;t deserve any better.  </p>
<p>And there are some girls who think by being with a black guy, that it gives them some sense of power.  Like look at me. </p>
<p>And then the worse cases are the girls who do it just to give the finger to their parents.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry for the parents of this young girl but if we knew anything about her home life, I can guarantee that her parents encouraged these types of relationships.</p>

			<p>If we look back a hundred years or two, most white women would find the prospect of a &#8220;swarthy&#8221; husband anything but pleasant. Those women were racially conscious and realististic. The most important influence on children are the parents. It&rsquo;s easier to teach children from a young age the &#8216;rules of the game&rsquo; rather than trying to break-up a problematic relationship later on. I taught my kids they should respect all people (or at least pretend to anyway) and where possible maintain cordial but as distant as possible relationships with minorities, particularly those of African and middle-eastern descent. An that they should never become close friends or marry such types, lest it have major implications for their personal or genetic survival. </p>

Moslem first name, Portuguese last name.  An interesting case.  I would say this illustrates what is happening in Brazil, just as in many other countries. They have fallen wholesale for globalism and multiculturalism.   It&rsquo;s seen as &#8220;the thing to do.&#8221;  After all, isn&rsquo;t it the rage in North America and Europe? All the &#8220;advanced&#8221; countries are doing it.</p>
<p>There was a time, not too long ago, when virtually the only immigration allowed  into Brazil was white immigration  (Japanese excepted).  And  it  pretty much had to be European/Christian  (or Jewish) &hellip; not Moslems!   Now, all of  that has changed,  just like the &#8220;white Australia&#8221; policy, and everywhere else has changed. The US, Canada, Sweden, etc., all have loosened their immigration policies to accommodate the world and invite in the world.  They have all lowered their standards.</p>
<p>And so, we see here one of the results of it.  Nice, isn&rsquo;t it?  A generation or two in the past, this would not have happened.  In Catholic Brazil?  Never. This creature would not have been there.</p>
<p>Another crime to chalk up to Diversity.</p>

			<p>&#8220;In my opinion, Whites have been brainwashed in the West to dislike themselves and to lift up all other races but their own, and because of this combination of low self-esteem and altruism so many blithely marry non-White and bear non-White.&#8221;</p>
<p>I agree with you and would say this is the biggest problem I see in young white people aged 30 and under. They have no sense of their grand history and no sense of the exotic and beautiful race they belong to.  They are brainwashed, dumbed down and demoralized. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Sorry to say it&hellip; but I have a hard time feeling sympathy for this White victim of multi-culturalism. Any White female jumping into bed with a non-White simply has to take her chances. ..she really has only herself, her abysmal stupidity to blame at the end.<br>

Do consider that she was only seventeen! This is the race-mixing culture that she was brought up in, the values that she was fed by the sources all around her. She probably never heard any views to the contrary.  At seventeen, I didn&rsquo;t know any better either.  It takes some time for us to wake up to the fact that not everything that is fed to us by the culture and the media is true.  It takes a while for us to sort things out and learn to think for ourselves.  For some of us it takes many years.  And, sadly, for many others  (the majority), they never figure it out at all. This girl was only a kid.<br>

			<p>My first cross-Atlantic travel alone to visit friends was when I was 17.  The difference, though was that I was travelling to England, a then-developed country, and my (white, English) friends were well-known to both of my parents.</p>
<p>What this deluded girl&rsquo;s criminally-negligent idiot parents did was allow her to travel unacompanied to a Third-World dump to stay with a partly-black Muslim.  Parents are supposed to second-guess their children and look out for them precisely so they don&rsquo;t get hit by motorists, molested by perverts, or end up dead and dismembered in suitcases in Third-World countries.</p>
<p>I am also curious as to what these criminally-negligent, idiot parents were thinking when they allowed their minor daughter to get a tattoo.  One recent AmRen article said that 80% of children inherit their parents&rsquo; political views, so the poster above who said she was probably encouraged in this relationship - and this lifestyle - by her parents is 80% likely to be absolutely correct.  This makes poor Cara&rsquo;s parents 80% likely to be politically-correct, criminally-negligent idiots.</p>
<p>I have a daughter.  She will not be making any airplane trips to either Brazil or Falluja or Compton as an unaccompanied minor.  If, while a minor she attempts to date anyone resembling Santos - or even brings one home as a friend, she will very quickly find herself living with Grandma and Grandpa in Japan.  If she does that as an adult, my wife and I couldn&rsquo;t legally stop her, but we would have to sit her down and tell her we don&rsquo;t have a daughter anymore.</p>

			<p>White women it seems are the most sexualized, aggressive and territorial animals of the human species.  Without strict forms of social cost to the exercise of such behavior, we can see the end result with all the rampant promiscuity and wickedness they have brought to bear.  In my town, the frequency of bm/wf pairings has surpassed any other.  It&rsquo;s as if the first born white female to a family is to be sacrificed at the altar of African race mixing.  This is a social travesty.  </p>

			<p>There was a time, not too long ago, when virtually the only immigration allowed into Brazil was white immigration (Japanese excepted). And it pretty much had to be European/Christian (or Jewish) &hellip; not Moslems! Now, all of that has changed, just like the &ldquo;white Australia&rdquo; policy, and everywhere else has changed. The US, Canada, Sweden, etc., all have loosened their immigration policies to accommodate the world and invite in the world. They have all lowered their standards.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t attest to all of the above statements, but I can attest to the fact that in 1968 I intended to take an R&R; from Viet-Nam combat to Australia, and our R&R; there was declined because the Australian government would not allow black soldiers off of the plane. How little I knew and appreciated then, and how far Australia has fallen.</p>

			<p>Chalk that to an incomplete family, too:<br>
<i>Anne-Marie brought up her children by herself after Cara&rsquo;s estranged and troubled dad Andy Ruff died of a drugs overdose in 1997. He was 32.<br>
The former cleaner lived with Cara and sons Michael, now 32, and Alan, 23, in Southfields, South London, where Cara began playing football as a child in the street.<br>
&hellip;<br>
Anne-Marie said: &#8220;Cara&rsquo;s dad was never on the scene. It was always me and the kids and it was tough.</i></p>
<p>The girl was at first a footbal fan, participating in Chelsea club activities, but after an unspecified incident in a bus she, so to say, went to a dark side&hellip;</p>
<p>Her mother says:<br>
<i>&#8220;After she went to the institution I hoped she&rsquo;d start a new chapter in her life but she met Santos and a group of his mates at a party in East London.<br>
&#8220;It was obvious she was smitten with him. But I had heard lots of terrible things about him and her friends warned her to keep away.<br>
&#8220;When her tag came off in April she told me he was taking her to Brazil and I was devastated. I cried for days and rang the high commission to see if I could stop her but I was powerless.&#8221;</i><br>

			<p>Chalk up another victory for the miscegenation-pushers and the haters of White people.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s check the goods on this fellow:</p>
<p>Mohamed D&rsquo;Ali Carvalho Santos, aged 20, from Brazil; drug dealer addicted to cocaine.</p>
<p>Sounds like the perfect match for a nice, impressionable young White, Christian, British gal.  Right BBC?</p>
<p>Gayle Sollenberger made several key points:</p>
<p>&#8220;And there are some girls who think by being with a black guy, that it gives them some sense of power. Like look at me.&#8221;</p>
<p>You can thank years of MTV-based race-mixing videos, movies, and even regular television commercials for misleading White girls into believing that Black men are the best thing for them.  If you daughter is old enough to watch a music video; teach her that what she is watching is as credible and as real as a Disney movie, a cartoon, or Sesame Street.</p>
<p>&#8220;And then the worse cases are the girls who do it just to give the finger to their parents.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ah, the typical rebellious stage culminates in reaching for the forbidden fruit.</p>
<p>The case in question refers to a man with a Latin family name, but an Arabic/Islamic given name.  Hmmm, given the latter tidbit, I would have to say it should be written to White girls:</p>
<p>If his name includes the name &#8216;Mohammed&rsquo;, leave him alone.<br>

That&rsquo;s a tough call.  But completely agree, having come to the same conclusion myself with my own daughter.  So far, so good.</p>

			<p>I wish to encourage Mr Scott and Mr Wilson and any others who worry about their daughters:  Years ago, I dated a foreign woman.  We wanted to marry, but her father forbade it, telling her that she could choose me or her family.  She chose her family.  I have nothing but respect for her father, he had nothing personal against me and he was always perfectly civil, but he was determined to defend his family and culture.  He gambled and won, and has four grandchildren and a couple great-grandchildren so far to show for it.  He was my adversary, but an honorable one.  Too bad this girl&rsquo;s parents didn&rsquo;t have the courage of my late, almost father-in-law.  <br>
     Of course, his ultimatum wouldn&rsquo;t have worked if his daughter did not know him to be a man of his word.  Spineless parents are a blight on their children&rsquo;s lives.</p>

What another poster informs us is that her &#8220;troubled&#8221;  father died 11 years ago when he was only 32 - and she was 6.  Even before that,  <i>&#8220;he was never on the scene.&#8221;  </i>  She and her siblings were brought up by her widowed mother, alone. Under the circumstances, no doubt the mother was troubled too. Her mother states,  <i>&#8220;I had heard lots of terrible things about him  [Santos] and her friends warned her to keep away. &hellip;she told me he was taking her to Brazil and  <b>I was devastated. I cried for days and rang the high commission to see if I could stop her but I was powerless.&rdquo; </b> </i></p>
<p>It seems to me her mother had all she could do to cope, and tried to do the best she could.  It was the mother, all alone, up against the culture.   The culture won, and took her child.</p>

			<p>That makes the story a bit sadder, 6:17 PM, but a parent who can&rsquo;t manage a minor child is no parent.  I still wonder why Cara&rsquo;s mother let the relationship progress as far as it did.</p>
<p>What a pity!  I&rsquo;m sure he flew her to Brazil on drug money.</p>
