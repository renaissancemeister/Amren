						<p>In what has been a strongly Republican county for years, a dramatic increase in Democratic registrations should be credited for the rise of Latino voters in the county, according to political experts.</p>
<p>Increasing numbers of Latino Democratic voters combined with the launch of an aggressive &#8220;Viva Obama&#8221; campaign in the county have contributed to the changing tide, they said.</p>
<p>There were 301,765 registered Republicans and 300,435 registered Democrats in the county, a difference of only 1,330 voters, as of July 28. The numbers reflect a rapid increase in Democratic voters just over the past few months, according to the San Bernardino County Democratic Party.</p>
<p>Drawn by less expensive housing, Latinos have been moving to the county from Orange and Los Angeles counties, said Armando Navarro, a political science professor at UC Riverside.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The populations in San Bernardino and Riverside counties are growing quickly, and the majority of those moving to the counties are Latinos, Calderone said. He has also witnessed an upsurge in political organizations that are working on voter registration.</p>
<p>The faltering economy, rising unemployment and troubled school systems are driving people&rsquo;s interest in November&rsquo;s election, he said.</p>
<p>Gil Navarro, chairman of the bilingual advisory committee for the San Bernardino County Registrar of Voters, said he has devoted his career to strengthening Latino political power in the county.</p>
<p>More Latino political candidates, more bilingual pollworkers and more registered Latino voters are making a difference, said Navarro, who is also a board member of San Bernardino County Superintendent of Schools.</p>

			<p>Yes their population is increasing in SB as well as Riverside<br>
counties here in So.Cal.<br>
That being said, you can also read the daily news about all<br>
the increases in crime in these areas as well.<br>
The problem is they do not follow up on the outcome of most of these crimes. People should be informed!</p>

			<p>  The stupid Republican Party has abetted their own disenfranchisement by advocating open borders. Hispanics (outside Cubans and a few white Latin Americans) will never support the Republican party in large numbers. </p>

			<p>   This has to be mind blowing on a high magnitude to watch white politicians betray their people. Utterly mind blowing! As mind blowing as the drug LSD. People in California and a few other states are witnessing this mind blowing abhorrence up close and personal. These cowardly traitors will get away with it. Another mind blowing occurence.</p>

			<p>  We must force the Nancy Pelosi&rsquo;s and the Harry Reid&rsquo;s and the Dick Durbin&rsquo;s to issue a proclamation that they will do everything in their power to preserve white people as a majority. They must do this in public. Those are my terms. Even if it means closing the border and deportations. They must do this or we will considered them traitors. We must force these people! We don&rsquo;t have much time, but we do have some time if we all pulled together.</p>

			<p>This is why Democrats absolutely refuse to stop illegal immigration even though it pushes down wages for the working class.  Ever since the busing debacles of the 70s the white working class has recognized that the Democrats are not on their side, so the Democrats have decided to replace them with Hispanics.  Of course the Republicans are not on the side of the white working class either, they have no where to go.</p>
<p>The Republicans have proven once again that the G.O.P. is the Stupid Party.  Their leaders have pushed for amnesty both to satisfy their big business constituency&rsquo;s desire for cheap labor and to try to get the Hispanic vote.  But for every 10 Hispanics made eligible to vote maybe 3 vote Republican (at best) and 7 Democratic.  The Republicans will never be able to out pander the  Democrats.<br>
