						<p>Mexican agriculture officials said Thursday that U.S. colleagues hunting for the source of a salmonella outbreak are rushing to a conclusion about finding the strain at a Mexican pepper farm.</p>
<p>The salmonella sample that one U.S. official called &#8220;a smoking gun&#8221; was taken from a water tank that had not been used for more than two months to irrigate crops, said the director of Mexico&rsquo;s Farm Food Quality Service, Enrique Sanchez.</p>
<p>Sanchez told a news conference on Thursday that the tank held rain water and suggested that roaming cattle or other factors could have recently contaminated the tank with the same strain of salmonella that has sickened 1,300 people in the United States since June.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sanchez said the U.S. officials &#8220;totally lacked scientific evidence&#8221; to make such statements and said they had broken a confidentiality agreement by announcing findings before their investigation is complete.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re eating this same produce in Mexico and we haven&rsquo;t had any problems,&#8221; Sanchez said.</p>
<p>He suggested the FDA officials confused the source of the samples because the tainted water was found on a farm in the Tamaulipas state municipality of Hidalgo &mdash; not in Nuevo Leon as the FDA reported.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Miguel Angel Toscano of Mexico&rsquo;s Federal Commission for Protection against Health Risks said Mexican investigators also took samples from the soil, water and vegetables the FDA had tested and found salmonella in some of the samples taken in Tamaulipas. But he said more tests need to be done to determine the strain.</p>
<p>Previously, the FDA had traced a contaminated jalapeno pepper to another farm in Tamaulipas. Both farms shipped through a packing facility in Nuevo Leon, raising the possibility that contamination could have occurred there.</p>
<p>The FDA has advised consumers to avoid raw serrano and jalapeno peppers from Mexico and any foods that contain them.</p>

			<p>How do we know that Mexicans aren&rsquo;t getting these diseases?  After all, the Mexican authorities, who are pushing for the American government for some kind of amnesty, would cover it up, and the American media, also hungry for American amnesty, would also cover it up.</p>

			<p>Of course THEY aren&rsquo;t getting sick from tainted produce. They are filthy people living in a filthy country. They are probably immune to most of the common food-borne illnesses endemic to that particular region of their squalid villages.</p>

			<p>A few points need to be made here.</p>
<p>1. Do we really need to be chastised and informed by &#8220;Mexican scientists&#8221;?</p>
<p>2. If a &#8220;confidentiality agreement&#8221; must be broken to save lives, and public safety&hellip;so what?</p>
<p>3. Mexicans aren&rsquo;t getting sick because either the peppers from that farm are all destined for export or the local people have grown accustomed to third-world parasites and bacteria.  That&rsquo;s why the tourists, and not the locals, get &#8220;Montezuma&rsquo;s revenge&#8221; form drinking the water in Mexico.</p>
<p>4. This is yet another reason to boycott all things south of the border.</p>

			<p>This strain must be stopped. Serrano and jalapeno peppers are simply bad for your digestive system and bad for your health. It&rsquo;s not just these outbreaks, the jalapeno plant has no place in the American diet. The public needs to find out what&rsquo;s going on and then regulate what can and cannot be consumed at the local store and sandwich shop. Lawsuits need to be brought to bear on the manufactures of this produce. Corporate big wigs shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to escape responsibility for the harm being caused by their products. </p>

<p>Obviously, living among disease and garbage, one builds up a certain amount of immunity to it.</p>

			<p>Unlike the spinach salmonella case, no wild pigs involved in this disease-transfer story  &mdash;  yet. Bet this just the tip of the iceberg, disease=wise. I suppose you do build up a tolerance for these kinds of diseases by living in squalor.  </p>

			<p>Have you noticed that food recalls, which were rare a decade ago, are happening on a weekly basis now?  Strawberrys, tomatoes, peppers, peanut butter, meat, etc. either washed in dirty water, salmonella, ecoli or tainted with fecal matter.  I wonder if this a covert threat to White America to give them amnesty or they&rsquo;ll continue to poison our food supply?  One of the unspoken benefits of diversity and another sign of decline.   </p>

			<p>Mexicans do not practice proper hygiene.<br>
Let&rsquo;s not mince words when peoples lives are in harms way by big business and cheap labor.<br>
The Federal government and big business place Americans under biological terror by criminal neglect and disregard for the health and safety of American&rsquo;s in pursuit of the big money.</p>

			<p>I agree with the general sentiment here about how filthy people living in a filthy country build up a tolerance to various bacteria and whatnot. We can see this on a smaller scale with humans living together. After six months, their digestive tracts are in symmetry with each other, so they don&rsquo;t need to worry about catching things from each other so much.</p>
<p>However, a lot of the comments about this issue suggest that it comes from raw sewage. This is not the case. Salmonella strains such as this one come from animals and animal manure. In this case, I am almost certain that cow manure contaminated the water used to irrigate these plants. A similar case in Salinas, California involved cow manure tainting spinach, and resulted in an E.Coli scare. </p>
<p>Back in the Vietnam War, the US military went into a village and cleaned up the water supply. The villagers refused to drink the new water. It just didn&rsquo;t have that nice familiar taste that they were so used to.</p>

			<p>  Bill Clinton signed free trade and its been all downhill from there. But do our leaders stop free trade? No. The people who died and have been sickened are just being sacrificed on the altar of free trade. Capitalism is evil and greed is not good. Their greed for fast profit (captalists) has blinded them to the harm they are doing to the country. They are deaf to the peoples shouts to fix it. I register independent and will vote third party. If theres no third party on the ticket i will vote against the person in office at the time. But i know its to late to fix anything in this country now. The dice are cast!</p>

			<p>Just because no one has been DIAGNOSED with salmonella poisoning, does not mean that they do not have it.  My guess would be that since salmonella has the same symptoms as a stomach flu, that you would have to do a lab test to diagnose it as such.  Anybody know this for sure?</p>
<p>So I am going to go out on a limb here and speculate that the average Mexican hospital gives these patients some cipro and sends them home, never even bothering to find out the cause of their illness.  </p>

			<p>Mexicans will say anything to cover-up the fact that the salmonella outbreak has been traced to Mexico. They don&rsquo;t want to admit it, because, who then in the USA would wantt to eat Mexican food? They can&rsquo;t have that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just salmonella and food. The Mexican tourist industry goes to great lengths to cover up crime in the so-called &#8220;resort areas&#8221;, by denying its existence.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an actual case in point:</p>
<p>A few years ago in Acapulco, a young American couple was found brutally murdered outside their hotel. I think they were newlyweds on their honeymoon; or vacationing there. When the victims&rsquo; families made inquiries, they were told by Mexican authorities that the couple died as a result of a mutual &#8220;lover&rsquo;s leap&#8221;, whereby the husband and wife clasped hands and jumped from their hotel window. Under no circumstances did Mexico admit they were killed by Mexican criminals. They didn&rsquo;t wantt to ruin Acapulco&rsquo;s &#8220;tourist haven&#8221; image.</p>
<p>Mexican justice is to justice, as Mexican water is to water. <br>

<p>I stand by my statement. What we need are warning labels, alerting Americans to the dangers of Mexican imports. Starting with all derivatives of the jalapeno plant and moving onto all peppers from Mexico. </p>

Peppers from Mexico, probably, but peppers in general are GOOD for the human digestive system. Be careful to say what you really mean when making sweeping statements or someone will misunderstand.</p>

			<p>I posted once about Mexican Illegal criminals on a neighbours farm using tobacco leaves as toilet paper and then loading the dirty leaves into the bulk barn while never washing their hands, although porta-potties and clean water were at their disposal.</p>
<p> Do you think they are more sanitary with lettuce or spinach? I cringe at the thought of personal hygiene in the fields of Mexico. This country needs point of origin on all products, especially food stuffs. We grow almost all we eat on our farm but, when the wife has to buy a food from the grocery store and it says Mexico or California on the package, it stays in the store.</p>
<p>I said then that there is a machine to plant, groom, harvest and package everything we consume, including apples and oranges and I stick to that statement. The only thing keeping most farmers from using machine technology in the fields instead of filthy Mexicans is nothing but GREED!!!!! It&rsquo;s your life and the well-being of your families at stake&hellip;&hellip;CHOOSE WISELY!!!!</p>

			<p>Here in northern Chicagoland, all sorts of mestizo-associated diseases are making unpredented appearances. In the next suburb over (overrun with illegals), there is a sudden and dramatic miniature whooping cough epidemic. The response of &#8220;health officials&#8221; (where&rsquo;s Chesterton when you need him?) are shocked, shocked, at this development. They&rsquo;ve absolutely <i>no</i> idea whence it&rsquo;s originated, they claim. Of course this is a lie; it&rsquo;s being imported from sunny Mexico. Naturally there&rsquo;s a hue and cry about &#8220;educating the public.&#8221; It&rsquo;s funny that these feckless, disease-transmitting illegals, who need &#8220;education&#8221; with regard to the simplest things (eg. not washing your hands after using the bathroom can spread bacteria to the lettuce you&rsquo;re chopping, another problem we&rsquo;ve had) are said to be something we just can&rsquo;t live without. We&rsquo;ve lived without them very recently, and I bet we can do so again.</p>

<p>Here in Texas, it&rsquo;s the same. We have had an increase in whooping cough as well as having the second I believe, highest TB rate in the nation. Of course the authorities can&rsquo;t figure out why we almost lead the nation in TB cases. Just can&rsquo;t imagine.</p>
