<h1>Fort Pierce Officer Suspended; Black Colleague Didn&rsquo;t Find Comment Offensive</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Will Greenlee, TCPalm.com (Fort Pierce, Florida), August 27, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A white police lieutenant received a three-day unpaid suspension for comments in a conversation with a black detective that &#8220;deeply offended&#8221; the white police chief, but did not offend the detective, according to records released Wednesday.</p>
<p>Lt. Katherine England, who is white, received the suspension following the July 3 interaction involving Detective Jesse Streeter, a longtime friend of hers, and Officer Christine Davis, who at the time was with her new K-9 dog partner, Boss.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;They then told him that the dog had not been trained yet,&#8221; a report states in summary of Streeter&rsquo;s comments. &#8220;Lieutenant England then told him that the dog would not bite him and that she would prove it to him. At this point she told the dog to, &lsquo;bite the black man, bite the black man.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Streeter saw Chief Sean Baldwin walk by as England said, &#8220;Bite the black man, bite the black man.&#8221; Baldwin, who is white, reported being &#8220;deeply offended&#8221; and directed an internal investigation into the matter.</p>
<p>Streeter said he, Davis and England all laughed as the comment was made. England hugged him and said, &#8220;You know that I love you,&#8221; and Streeter said he did.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Baldwin wrote the investigation indicates Streeter wasn&rsquo;t offended and found no evidence of &#8220;malicious discriminatory intent,&#8221; but that it was &#8220;in contempt of our policies, which are intended to promote a value for diversity within our organization and support positive relationships within the community we serve.&#8221;<br>

			<p>One of my former jobs was to look for gas leaks on the underground piping. One of the places that I did this was Hunters Point, San Franciscos infamous ghet-toe.It seemed to me that dogs and cats there  were less hostile to me than they were to anyone else there. I think that they were just glad to see a non black person.</p>

			<p>  Sounds like chief Baldwin doesn&rsquo;t know his job too well and is trying to get brownie points with his boss by playing the race card for a black person. Truly disgusting. I really hope they fire him soon. Baldwin (Bag-of-wind) is a perfect example of what is wrong with the white race. He is willing to throw his own under the bus to make his stupid butt look good. Believe me, he doesn&rsquo;t look as good to his superiors as he thinks he does.</p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s a <a href="https://www.fppd.org/" rel="nofollow">PHOTO</a> of this over-the-top, political correct police chief who deserves to be suspended himself for bringing discredit upon the force for his utter foolishness. This guy wouldn&rsquo;t measure up to any real police chief from the &rsquo;80s or &rsquo;90s.</p>

At this point she told the dog to, &lsquo;bite the black man, bite the black man.&rsquo;&rdquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I can understand the chief being upset, seeing as how that dog will probably be biting a LOT of &#8220;black men&#8221; in his career.</p>
<p>And that Lt. <i>deserves</i> the suspension for not knowing that woman does not trump black in PC speak. How smart do you have to be to figure out that you DO NOT say something like that? Especially when the chief (a political appointee, as like as not) is around?</p>

			<p>A late white neighbor of mine once told me his family dog would not harm me but would bite a black. I did not know what to make of that: a &#8220;racist&#8221; dog? </p>

			<p>Actually dogs CAN be &#8220;racist&#8221;. Usually having been mistreated by a person of the color they are discriminating against, but not always. We had a dog who would invariably growl and threaten Hispanic men. He was never abused by one, we got the dog when he was 6 weeks old. He just couldn&rsquo;t stand Hispanic men&hellip; <br>
I personally thought it was the smell of the spicy foods Hispanics eat, because he would bark and growl at a plate of chili peppers too.</p>

			<p>Maybe the answer for whites is to just totally avoid and/or ignore blacks. To do otherwise is to bring unnecessary hardship upon oneself. This story is further proof that even when you build a friendship with a black co-worker, you must still walk on eggshells when you speak. And as this story also proves, its not just blacks that you should be weary of when speaking about race, even if your conversation is between you and a black friend. There&rsquo;s always the chance that some white do-gooder will overhear your innocent comments or joke and report you to Big Brother. On further analysis, maybe the answer for white people is to just totally retreat into their own little private innerworld and avoid all contact with anyone out of fear of being reported as a thought-criminal.  Looks like &#8221;1984&#8221; is no longer a work of fiction.  George Orwell was Nostradamus reincarnated.</p>

			<p>We had a German Shepherd when I was a kid.  He didn&rsquo;t like rats - does that make him a rat racist?  Of course, he used to go absolutely nuts when the black guy would come down our alley everyday, selling fruits and vegetables.  </p>
<p>My Dad had a friend who had a German Shepherd.  Once a black guy tried to hit Mr. Ghrout over the head and his dog tore that black guy up.  I guess his dog was a racist too.</p>
<p>Do you think maybe it&rsquo;s a generational racist thing.  Maybe the Nazis breed them that way.</p>
<p>Maybe we should start senstivity training classes for German Sheperds.  Let&rsquo;s call Pet Smart and Petco and tell them to make it part of the pet training classes</p>

			<p>Everyone calm down! This event is actually GOOD! Everytime something like this happens the fruits of dissention are sowed even deeper into our people. In this case EVERYONE (including the minority who was supposed to be offended) sees the utter silliness and unnecessary actions this scene inflicted on the innocent White. Every White in that department (save for Baldwin) will get a little bit more disgusted with Marxian PC forced upon them and their bias towards all Leftist causes like &#8216;Affirmative Action,&rsquo; &#8216;Diversity,&rsquo; &#8216;Inclusion,&rsquo; etc. will grow exponentially.  So, painful as it is to watch we should BEG for more of this to happen. It seems to be the ONLY way our people will get their ire raised sufficiently enough to fight back against all this oppression one day.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;in contempt of our policies, which are intended to promote a value for diversity within our organization and support positive relationships within the community we serve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And precisely how is the administrative penalization of genuine expressions of friendship and camaraderie supposed to bring about enhanced &#8216;support for positive relationships&rsquo; that they purport to seek?  Is it not manifestly obvious that the &#8216;correction&rsquo; that a suspension will likely bring about is most likely to be a hesitency to allow for the uninhibited, natural expression of one&rsquo;s feelings, a diminished level of trust, and therefore weaker &#8216;support of positive relationships within the community?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Does anyone believe that if this contradiction were to be pointed out in a clear and dispassionate fashion, that it would nevertheless be dismissed due to the apparently ingrained preconceptions of socially acceptable behavior that is Political Correctness?</p>
<p>The institution of Political Correctness is an Orwellian engine working against it&rsquo;s own claimed goals.  A genuine movement that held PC in the same regard as was communism in the 50s would be a huge boon to civil society.</p>

<p>You can alway count on a dog for a natural reaction. And to be looking out for his best friend.  </p>
