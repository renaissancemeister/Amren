						<p>Asian-Americans have not always been the most politically active constituency, but that may change this November.</p>
<p>&#8220;Historically, they are less focused on politics, but they are an emerging bloc, suddenly in the last few years in both state and national elections,&#8221; said Gautam Dutta, the executive director of the Asian-American Action Fund.</p>
<p>Of U.S.-born adults eligible to vote, Asians were 18 percentage points behind non-Asians in voter turnout in the 2006 midterm election. The naturalized Asian community was four percentage points behind non-Asians in voting rates that same year, according to a UCLA report released earlier this month.</p>
<p>But the voter turnout during California&rsquo;s primary on Feb. 5 suggested a boom in voter participation could be in the making. More than half a million Asian Americans went to the polls in the nation&rsquo;s largest state, according to Presidentpolls2008.com.</p>
<p>There, Asian-Americans made a difference voting for Hillary Clinton over Barack Obama by a 3-1 margin. CNN, using exit poll data, credited Clinton&rsquo;s victory in California to &#8220;an Asian American and Latino voting bloc.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;In 2008, we&rsquo;ll probably see more Asian-Americans at the ballot box because of large numbers,&#8221; said Paul Ong, a professor in the Public Relations and Asian-American Studies departments at UCLA. &#8220;I&rsquo;ve noticed my students are much more interested this year.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;In local and state elections, (Asian-Americans) are very critical of who wins and loses,&#8221; Ong said. &#8220;(If they are) concentrated in large numbers that makes a difference, and around D.C. and Virginia they are starting to emerge as a potentially important vote.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Asian American political awakening could trace back to 2006, when fierce debates over immigration raged and talks about anti-immigrant legislation got many of them thinking about politics, Ong said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve been ignored for the longest time, and this time noticed a little more,&#8221; said Kathleen To, president of 80-20 Political Action Committee. &#8220;We only make up about 5 percent of the U.S. population, nobody thought we&rsquo;d be that important.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Nothing makes me more angry than hearing comments on here about how they&rsquo;re so smart and they&rsquo;d rather have asians in America rather than mexicans or blacks.  Wake up people, they&rsquo;re really not that different than any other minority.  I live in Alhambra, CA and I&rsquo;m not impressed by these people one bit.  They do better in school because of intelligence and family support, but they never really assimilate fully.  They form enclaves, only speak English when not around fellow asians, and still act entitled whether they&rsquo;ve been in this country for 2 months or 20 years.  Even the 2nd generation ones still feel more loyalty to their parent&rsquo;s home country than this one.  Then their women have the habit of wanting to marry a white guy, can&rsquo;t figure this one out.  Ohh, me love my asian culture, but me have to have white guy.</p>

			<p>First of all, &#8220;Asian&#8221;, is not an ethnic group.  Lumping all Asians together is ludicrous.  Koreans, Chinese, Filipinos, East Indians, Pacific Islanders, and many more groups have are radically different, and are but generalizations in themselves.  For instance a Gujarati Jain would not be naturally allied to a Pubjabi Sikh just because an ignorant American bureaucrat thinks they both eat curry.</p>
<p>What is happening is that American born descendants of functional racial minorities are learning marxist identity politics.  See, our major universities are getting through to the kids.</p>

			<p>Asians do not assimilate into European descended American society and the chance that asians will do so diminishes with the governments criminal unregulated immigration policies.<br>
Asians tend to favor Marxism. Asians become socially incongruent and irreconcilable toward other ethnic groups.<br>
Asians are touchy and become prone to violence under the fabricated presumption that everyone loves everyone else.</p>

			<p>We also have to look out now for Native America, Muslim and Arab groups. No politician outside the south will attend a CofCC conference. If we show our pride we are racist, personally I think we are being played by the Demirats. If whites voted in a united force both Dems and cowardly Republicans would be out of work. So the Dems and cowadly Republians along with their media and anti-white racist groups, like NAACP  attack WNs. Because white nationalism united is a threat to the non-white controlled government. hink again if you think the white majority controlls the government. No, groups like the NAACP, ADL, La Raza, SPLC controll this nation.</p>

			<p>Unpalatable as this bit of truth might be, some Asains don&rsquo;t want to mix with whites because they don&rsquo;t want their genetic IQ lowered to the white level, any more than we want our white IQ lowered by mestizos or blacks.</p>

			<p>We must welcome Orientals too.  No amount of diversity is too much. <br>
And it&rsquo;s such a shame that Orientals are &#8216;only&rsquo; 5% of the population.  That&rsquo;s much too low.  We need more Chinese restaurants and laundries and Computer people.  OH NO!  I believe I&rsquo;m stereotyping people.  It&rsquo;s strange, but if there were 200,000,000 Chinese and 1.5 Billion Whites and we were moving into China en masse and opening businesses like the above - WITHOUT BOTHERING TO LEARN SUFFICIENT CHINESE and acted like we owned the country - I wonder what they&rsquo;d do about it?  Of course there&rsquo;s no need to wonder.  We all know what they&rsquo;d do.  They&rsquo;d close their borders mighty quick and drive the Whites in China right on out.  Of course if White Europeans did anything remotely resembling that there would be public outcries of racism faster than you can say Jackie Robinson.  Evil Whites!</p>

			<p>Lets be real here folks, East Asians are an asset to the communities.  If you disagree, you just sound ignorant.  And if Asian women are marrying White men, then that&rsquo;s the biggest sign og integration, isn&rsquo;t it?  No one like blacks for many reasons but none of those reason&rsquo;s apply to Asians.  </p>

Non-western women want white men for two obvious reasons:<br>
1) White men make good providers.<br>
2) White men treat women, animals, kids, and all living things better than any other men on the planet do. When you find a white man with the above qualities, PLUS the backbone to be a real man (masculine, quietly strong and confident without all the useless third-world macho bravado), You have the most valuable man on the planet.<br>
 Every woman from another culture knows that. <br>
Just like a white woman with beauty, brains and dignity is the most prized posession for all men in the world. ( I say POSESSION, because that&rsquo;s what third-worlders think of the great prize of a white woman).<br>
Everybody knows these things, in their bones. They may be horrified by the realization, but they know it.</p>

<p>From Wikipedia&hellip;&hellip;The 1991 Sacramento Hostage Crisis occurred on April 4, 1991, at Sacramento, California, United States, in which four perpetrators took hostages at a Good Guys! Electronics store. During the incident, three hostages as well as three of the four hostage-takers were killed. An additional fourteen hostages were injured during the crisis. To this date, the situation remains the largest hostage rescue operation in U.S. history, with over 50 hostages being held at gunpoint.[1]<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..Background</p>
<p>Just before 2:00pm on April 4, 1991, four young Vietnamese refugees, brothers Loi Khac Nguyen, 21, Pham Khac Nguyen, 19, and Long Khac Nguyen, 17, and their friend, Cuong Tran, 16, drove into the parking lot of The Good Guys! Electronics store, in the South Area of Sacramento County, after botching a robbery at a different location. The group exited the vehicle, a 1982 Toyota Corolla, and entered the store armed with three pistols and a shotgun. They herded customers and staff into a group, including a shoplifter attempting to exit the store and began shooting. Several customers managed to escape and alerted police of the situation.</p>
<p>[edit] Police and Media</p>
<p>When the call came in at 13:35, the Sacramento County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department Special Enforcement Detail (SED) was already in the process of gearing up in anticipation of executing a previously planned drug raid. They immediately paged off duty team members, and began preparations to rush to the scene along with the Department&rsquo;s Critical Incident Negations Team (CINT), and other local and state law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>As the situation developed, the local media descended on the area in force, broadcasting the unfolding incident, which was able to get footage of the event because of the store&rsquo;s huge glass front doors, which allowed video crews to see into the store, where the hostage takers lined up some of the hostages in front of the entrance as human shields&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>There is more to this, but those gunmen should be deported once their sentences are up.  I don&rsquo;t care that they are refugees; they are certainly able to take care of themselves, and after they are released from prison they will forever be a danger to society.  The neighborhood has never recovered.</p>

			<p>Asians might be tired of &#8220;being ignored&#8221; but are certainly not reluctant to come to our country and steal White Americans&rsquo; jobs. </p>
<p>That beheading incident on that Canadian bus, that whacko Korean who went berserk on campus a couple of years ago&hellip; just call it the blessing of having to live in a multi-cultural society, I guess. Nor can you forget the MORE diverse (immigration by non-Whites) we become, the more such ugly incidents   &mdash;   will surface in our daily news.</p>

<p>Our government, schools and media encourage, pay them, and reward them for self-segregating immediately after arrival. Also enforcing this &#8216;marxist indentity politics&rsquo;, this mental segregation. Of course, only for them. It&rsquo;s the height of enlightenment for them. The height of evil when done by us. </p>
<p>I see a lot of whites on AmRen who seem to accept Marxist identity politics. The word to stress being &#8216;Marxist&rsquo;. You&rsquo;re right, Universities are getting through to the kids. At least, as far as the marxism is concerned.   </p>

			<p>The whole &#8220;but Asians are smarter&#8221; canard is little more than a smokescreen to neutralize accusations of &#8220;supremacism&#8221;.  They avoid the point, which is that we wish to retain our ethnic and national character - our extended racial family.  The point about Asians being &#8220;smarter&#8221; is far from resolved, as the differing intelligences obfuscate attempts at apples to apples comparisons.  Murray&rsquo;s exhaustive work, &#8220;Human Accomplishment&#8221;, implies what many intuitively suspect - that there is a certain deficit of creative genius among East Asians.</p>
<p>The conundrum is similar to the ones people who rail against &#8220;illegal immigration&#8221; run into.  If the lack of legality of immigrants is the real issue, then the logical thing to do would be to legalize.  Right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll keep ending up with unconvincing arguments and smacking of insincerity as long as we refuse to defend the perfectly defensible position that we are a people and that we wish to retain our unique nature, sovereignty, heritage, and way of life.</p>

			<p>  This country was built by white men for white people. That&rsquo;s how it should be. This multicultural baloney the MSM promotes is to weaken the white race, that&rsquo;s all. I&rsquo;m getting tired waiting for white people to wake up. This is our country, we built it! Whoever builds a society on a piece of land, owns the land. Period.</p>

			<p>Mating with an Asian is still a betrayal to one&rsquo;s race.  Tribalism trumps IQ, which is the problem with many racialists.  See, the white  race could be the most ignorant on the planet and I&rsquo;d still support it because it is MY race.</p>
<p>The Asian invasion is as menacing as the mestizo invasion.</p>

			<p>Great Comments.  Flamethrower is absolutely correct: American Marxist social policy breeds identity politics and forges anti-white/European alliances between groups who naturally loathe each other.  Koreans and Japanese are enemies, no less becuse of the brutality the latter exercised on the former.  In fact, all other Asians tend to despise the Japanese for their genocidal wars of aggresion.  The same thing happens among Hispanics who share nothing except a deep-seated hatred (read: envy)of the Yankis/Greengos.</p>
<p>And yes, white people are sought after mates for the reasons indicated above.  The non-Europeans I have known who marry whites, many of them otherwise decent folk, have a noticably different relationship to their wife/husband than a regular white couple.  There is none of the residual romantic love that characterizes a Western marriage; it is all about the white person &#8220;learning&#8221; from the &#8220;rich culture&#8221; of the Other and playing a subordinated role.  I was revolted to hear an Aussie woman married to a Asian describe herself as just a boring Scot-Brit with no culture whereas her third world husband, whom she attneded like a servant, came from such a deep, ancient and wise tradition.  The spark that will light the fire in the soul of the West is the gradual replacement of romantic love with brutal Asian practices of ownership and submission.</p>

			<p>As an &#8221; original-American &#8220;, aka, white-Christian; I tired of my culture being total ignored by the 3 branches of our corrupt federal government since the 1965 A.D. Immigration and Reform Act. Reformed all right, from a republic,aka, representative democracy to a non-representative &#8221; diversity &#8221; via treason. The last time I looked, treason is still not constitutional.</p>

<p>That is a ridiculous claim. Case in point, Stormfront - the so called &#8220;White Nationalist&#8221; community whose views parallel many, if not all, of those stated here on AMREN. The racially aware white men on there are so insecure that they heavily blame white women for race mixing and hence helping the destruction of white society. The gender hostility is so great that it actively drives females away, to the point where a &#8220;women only&#8221; section had to be created separately on the site. If you think white men treat women better than all others then you are deluding yourself.</p>

			<p>Like I&rsquo;ve said many many times before, we need to limit immigration from everywhere but especially from the 3rd &amp; 4th world countries. The e asians are lower on my list of concerns as compared to other criminal and low functioning races. That doesn&rsquo;t mean every e asian is hi IQ and good citizen just as not all blacks are dumb and criminal. But e asians in general are pretty good citizens and white society can learn from asians about racial and cultural integrity and loyalty to their homeland. Whites can teach the e asians about individuality and independence. We&rsquo;d all benefit.</p>

Incorrect.  Where did you get that assertion?   The peoples of India and Africa, despite a coincidental similarity in skin color due to the climate,  are anthropologically (and linguistically) entirely distinct.  Just look at the hair and features.  Carleton Coon classifies even Dravidians (South India) as dark Caucasians.   (Note that I am not equating Aryans and Caucasians here.)</p>
<p>And incidentally, the term &#8220;East Indies&#8221; traditionally applies to what is now loosely known as Indonesia and Malaysia&hellip; (as opposed to the West Indies).  After all, you wouldn&rsquo;t call a Brazilian  or Mexican a West Indian.</p>

			<p>In general, the most honorable orientals I have ever come across who made a life in the U.S., were the Japanese. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, even some whites could learn a lot from them. These people always followed the rules, tried to assimilate, and worked hard at whatever occupation they had.  </p>

			<p>It is fascinating to read such farcical stories that interest groups like La Raza and SPLC and the Asian-American Action Fund do.  If they were in their home countries, say Chinese and Japanese, those two would be jumping to kill each other by the throat with a sai (an east asian weapon).  I will say the Chinese have contributed much to this country, and they assimilate far better than others, even Russians.  But race, particularly in America, is one confused mess.</p>

			<p>Lets be real here folks, East Asians are an asset to the communities. If you disagree, you just sound ignorant. And if Asian women are marrying White men, then that&rsquo;s the biggest sign og integration, isn&rsquo;t it? No one like blacks for many reasons but none of those reason&rsquo;s apply to Asians. </p>

<p>&#8220;If you disagree, you just sound ignorant.&#8221;</p>
<p>The above sentence is straight out of the PC Handbook.  It&rsquo;s another way of saying &#8220;If we are in agreement, then you are good.  If we are not in agreement, you are bad.&#8221;<br>
It&rsquo;s extremely immature.  Not to mention, well, &#8220;ignorant.&#8221;</p>
<p>Extreme thinking of this sort is usually designed to conceal a secret of some kind.  The secret in this case is that in saying that someone must agree with him or be closed minded, he is concealing the fact that HE is close-minded. Obviously.  And this explains the character of his Black and White thinking.</p>
<p>Now, having said that.  I won&rsquo;t engage in extremes myself and say that because Jeffery does then everthing he say is wrong. And not because I&rsquo;m such a nice person, but because it wouldn&rsquo;t be true.  He&rsquo;s right, in a sense.  Especially his last sentence that Asians can&rsquo;t be blamed for why we don&rsquo;t like Blacks. For me, what he&rsquo;s touching on there is that Asians are Racial Allies. There is a great essay here at AR about forming Political Alliances. It doesn&rsquo;t mention Asians, as I recall, but it easily could. They are as disgusted with Blacks as we are, and would much prefer us as allies, then Blacks.</p>

			<p>I disagree with many American Renaissance people here.  Adding some (not too many) East Asian genes to the white gene pool will be to the betterment of the white pool, just as the white admixture has raised black American intelligence above the level of their all-African forbears.  In general, east asians have most of the positive traits that we look for in immigrants, with few of the negative ones.  The way that they deal with blacks in particular - think of your average Korean grocier in the ghetto -is also a good lesson for white people in race realism and plain old common sense. Even Jared has occasionally written articles praising the Japanese.  Of course, he wants us to find our own racially inclusive path, and this is worthy goal, but it does not and should not preclude learning things from other people, and the fact is that we will tend to learn more about the good qualities of the higher Asian civilizations if there are a significant amount of Asians (again, not too many) in the USA.  </p>

Well, call me ignorant then, because  I don&rsquo;t necessarily agree with all that you say. </p>
<p>However, regarding  your comment about Asian women marrying white men, I must grant your point that  people (posters here) complain that Asians don&rsquo;t integrate, and then they complain when they do!  Actually, it can&rsquo;t be both ways.</p>
<p>I guess that inter-marriage is integrating too much! But that&rsquo;s the inevitable result.</p>
<p>But you call them an asset? You seem to be looking at this in terms of economics instead of race.  Miscenenation, even if it&rsquo;s with a cultured, educated, suave billionaire, is still  <i>racially  </i>destrucive.</p>
<p>I would phrase your statement somewhat differently, saying that while they can be an asset (economically),  when they (any racial outsiders) move into our communities, those are no longer  <i>&#8220;our&#8221;   </i>communities.   Our communities become &#8220;diversified&#8221;  and in the process we lose our identity.   To me, no amount of economic benefit (if there really is any at all) is worth that  sacrifice. </p>
<p>But the goal of the central  &#8220;diversifiers&#8221;  will have been achieved:  to get us de-racinated. One could say racially  gelded.  That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s really all about.  Cheap labor,  alleged economic benefits,  cultural festivals, ethnic restaurants, and blah, blah are all side benefits  for the diversifiers&hellip;..  but the main goal is to excise and remove from us, as if surgically, any sense of racial identity or cohesiveness.  </p>

<p>Rachel:   Yes, there are SOME white men (assuming they&rsquo;re white and not trolls) who do write deprecatingly about women.  But I&rsquo;ve seen worse elsewhere. At any rate, the rest of us cannot control them or change them.   They are driven by their own demons.  Their comments are ofttimes regrettable, but we are responsible only for ourselves.</p>

<p>You have been clobbered over and over again about your pro-asian tendencies on this web site. The majority of people who read and post on American Renassaince don&rsquo;t want asians entering America and would like to see most of them leave as soon as possible.Native Born White Americans are not inter-changeable with asians street-by-steet,town-by town and city-by city.Asians are not natural allies of Native Born White Americans. Native Born White Americans are competing with the asians for the scarce resources of America. There is no benefit to Native Born White Americans having asians around.If it were up to the asians there would be no Native Born White medical doctors,engineers,scientists,programmers and many other occupations. A vicious battle is being fought with LEGAL asian immigrants and their &#8220;American&#8221; born gene-line over the H-1 B and L-1B scab labor programs. The presence of Asians in America is bringing about the destruction of thousands of years of collective engineering that resides in the brains of Native Born White Americas. Before the post-1965 mass arrival of asians America had no problem developing home-grown engineering and medical talent in engineering and medicine to meet the nations needs. The case for asian legal immigration is non-existant. The case against asian legal immigration is very strong. Native Born White Americans did quite well with out having asians around. And WE will be much better off not having asians around US within the borders of America, the nation Native Born White Americans founded and created.</p>
<p>I am very curious to know what your race or ethnicity is realist. Why don&rsquo;t you tell us what it is.</p>
<p>White America managed to put several White Men on the  moon several times when the asian population in America was very small. </p>

<p>  Certainly, if you look at Western/European (white) society women are treated better than Asia, Africa, Latin America or any other place. Name a non Western society where women are treated better? Even if one exits, would you care to live there? By all measures, the status of women is highest in the West with the Scandinavian countries ranked among the best. </p>

Maybe you should ask him what race or ethnicity  <i>his wife  </i>is.  Perhaps it&rsquo;s not so in his case, but  I find that is very often the key that solves the puzzle.</p>
<p>As with some others who  post here, when they (or a sibling)  marry outside their race, it seems that  they effectly cease in their minds to be white or to  identify with other whites or white interests.  They no longer think as whites&hellip; and they make rationalizations for intermarriage, for immigration, and for others who act in a way to undermine the race&rsquo;s unity.</p>
<p>Let me finish by saying that I have no hostility and great respect for Asians. I regret any hurt caused. But they have their own countries. They don&rsquo;t need to be here, colonizing us in ours.  (And that&rsquo;s exactly what it is.)<br>

No, I didn&rsquo;t read that article, Mr. Dumpty, but on your recommendation I definitely will.<br>
 <br>
The Chinese are widely dispersed, and wherever they may be, they retain their identity tenaciously. (Btw, I find nothing wrong with this loyalty to their culture and people.) They are often called the Jews of Asia. There are Overseas Chinese families who have been living in other Asian countries for centuries, but they remain Chinese first and foremost.  Is America likely to be any diffferent?  In those  other Asian countries they could have assimilated much more easily than here. But they didn&rsquo;t. In America, some will inevitably assimilate and intermarry, yes, no doubt.  But will that include them all?  </p>

			<p>I read this web site sometimes because I have a professional interest in genetics.  The friend who told me about it did stop subscribing to American Renaissance and seeking live meetings of white people&rsquo;s groups due to the misogyny others have mentioned is allowed here.</p>
<p>She doesn&rsquo;t seem particularly mean.  She just said that she thought that the solution to race relations in this country was for us all to give each other some space.  She got sick of the men  here who ranted about what other races were doing but were quite open about their own interracial relationships.  She wondered if they were really racially conscious or just mad at the world because people with very high IQ&rsquo;s can still be losers if they don&rsquo;t know how to use their intelligence.  </p>
<p>My two cents on Asians is that they do tend to be a rather insular community.  They do take care of their own.  White people are chumps about this.  I have noticed that people who will go for broke to support or even import Asian spouses and Asian inlaws may be willing to let their own white children go without while they owe child support for their white children.</p>
<p>My friend who has given up on white people ever doing more than venting on the Internet was trying to help people in Appalacia because it is full of impoverished white people who will compete for dirty, dangerous jobs like coal mining knowing that these jobs will take years off of their lives.  White liberals who would gladly write huge checks for any non-white charity would not give a dime to white families who sometimes didn&rsquo;t even have indoor plumbing and were more likely to live 20 miles down a dirt road than to hang out on street corners and commit crimes.  </p>
<p>I believe that white people serve the race we marry.  We need to ask ourselves how many of the immigrants some of us are so angry about are here because they were sponsored in on fiances&rsquo; visas or came here as the families of people who were.  </p>

Nothing makes me more angry than hearing comments on here about how they&rsquo;re so smart and they&rsquo;d rather have asians in America rather than mexicans or blacks. Wake up people, they&rsquo;re really not that different than any other minority. I live in Alhambra, CA and I&rsquo;m not impressed by these people one bit. They do better in school because of intelligence and family support, but they never really assimilate fully. They form enclaves, only speak English when not around fellow asians, and still act entitled whether they&rsquo;ve been in this country for 2 months or 20 years. Even the 2nd generation ones still feel more loyalty to their parent&rsquo;s home country than this one. Then their women have the habit of wanting to marry a white guy, can&rsquo;t figure this one out. Ohh, me love my asian culture, but me have to have white guy.</p>
<p>black/hispanic/asian=Minority=Trouble</p>
<p>Bingo! This guy is smart and seems to hit it the needle on the head! Why Whites want to cherry pick is beyond me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Non-western women want white men for two obvious reasons:<br>
1) White men make good providers.<br>
2) White men treat women, animals, kids, and all living things better than any other men on the planet do. When you find a white man with the above qualities, PLUS the backbone to be a real man (masculine, quietly strong and confident without all the useless third-world macho bravado), You have the most valuable man on the planet.<br>
Every woman from another culture knows that. <br>
Just like a white woman with beauty, brains and dignity is the most prized possession for all men in the world. ( I say POSSESSION, because that&rsquo;s what third-worlders think of the great prize of a white woman).<br>
Everybody knows these things, in their bones. They may be horrified by the realization, but they know it.</p>

<p>My, my, you are a little overconfident aren&rsquo;t you? I think you have been watching too many Suzy Wong movies. First of all, to say that &#8220;all non-whites&#8221; think of White women as possessions is at best hilarious. Most non-Whites I know don&rsquo;t think that way in the slightest. This sounds like typical white paranoia.  Half the people on this thread worry too much about how Asian women see White men, kind of insulting to them, wouldn&rsquo;t you think?<br>
They have the right to date and live in any community they choose and some Whites talk about them as if they are some prized, rare collection that ONLY the White man can have. The level of insecurity here is enormous. Bottom line, some Asians prefer to stay with their own (most) and some want to date outside their race. I live in Japan for about 15 years and I see more and more biracial children which at one time was something unheard of. When I see white men with Asian women I couldn&rsquo;t care less, but then again, I look good and as a non-White, I have not had any problems, so yea, I know some Asians that hate White, Black, Muslims and other people that don&rsquo;t look like them&hellip;so what.<br>
Everyone has totally strayed from the original topic. It went from Asians in the U.S. their political constituency is growing to &#8220;how non-Whites&#8221; are envious of White men dating and courting Asian women as if they are pieces of meat. Amazing.</p>

			<p>Interesting site. But let&rsquo;s get real.</p>
<p>The fixation on &#8216;race purity&rsquo; flies in the face of history and genetics. Long before the discovery of the New World by Europeans in the 1500s  (using maps given to them by the Chinese in the early 1400s), armies and navies and merchants and slavers and pilgrims travelled all over the Old World with considerable race-mixing taking place.</p>
<p>When the Moors of North Africa conquered and invaded Spain before the Middle Ages tremendous amounts of African blood entered Europe.</p>
<p>Since discovery of the New World, and emigration (or transportation) to it of people from all over the world, tremendous amounts of mixing has taken place. And not just in Brazil and Mexico. It was estimated a few decades ago that in the American South, about 85 percent of the population that &#8220;passed&#8221; for white has some African blood. With the recent influx of Hispanics - almost all of whom are &#8220;mixed race&#8221; -  into the South in recent years, the South is now a lot more like Brazil than North Dakota!</p>
<p>So things were different, say, 10,000 years ago, but we&rsquo;ve all got to stop believing in fairy tales.</p>
<p>So watcha gonna do? People are not going to stop being people, and they are going to continue  marrying and mating with the cutest, handsomest, smartest, richest guys/gals they can find! Hard to turn a multi-thousand year tradition around, even with the internet.</p>
<p>C&rsquo;mon all you AmRen folk, stop pretending you&rsquo;d take Roseanne Barr over Halle Berry. We won&rsquo;t tell on you!</p>
<p>None of this is to deny the importance of greatly reducing immigration rates. And of restricting immigration as much as possible to those who have the potential for making a contribution to American society. But that means, of course, favoring engineers from Hong Kong over punk rockers from Liverpool&hellip;..</p>

And, yes, I&rsquo;m also married to an Asian woman.  Never particularly had yellow fever, it just worked out that way.  Its not ideal, it has its problems, and in fact my marriage has made me much more racially conscious than I was before.  Sometimes though, believe it or not, people with innate differences including racial ones can and do manage to have a fruitful partnership.  </p>
<p>You seem to be a white separatist, or nearly so.  Whereas I think that genie is out of the bottle, and rather than pulling up stakes and abandoning most of the USA to the Mexicans in order to create some white homeland, I&rsquo;d rather live in the USA, a USA with a dominant white majority, were traditional Western values are nurtured, uncivilized behavior by members of any race is not tolerated, and various minorities ARE tolerated and welcomed as equal citizens as long as they are able to live harmoniously with the white majority.  </p>
<p>Lastly, any difficulties between whites and east asians in america are tiny compared to the diversity nightmares that take place when whites and blacks, or whites and Hispanics, or Christians and Muslims, are forced to live together.  Most of the problems with East Asians in America have to do with a few of them resenting and wanting to join blacks and Hispanics on the ethnic spoils gravy train.  The solution is to stop that train, not kick American citizens of asian descent out of this country.  </p>

			<p>I think we need to draw a distinction between White Nationalists and race realists.  White Nationalists are pro-white.  Race realists can be pro-white, anti-white or indifferent to the well being of white people.  They can be of any race as well.  The only requirement is that one acknowledges racial differences.  </p>
<p>Those of us who are pro-white, the majority or people reading mosthis website, need to remember than many &#8220;race realists&#8221; are not on our side.  </p>
<p>Race realism seems to be a popular self-description of people of non-European ancestry, usually from Asia, who want to continue to enjoy the benefits of living in a white society, but don&rsquo;t want blacks and Mexicans ruining it.  Most of these people also want white societies to continue to allow immigration of some non-whites, especially those of their own ethnicity.  So fundamentally, these people are hostile to the idea that white people have the right to have their own societies for themselves.  Therefor, they can only be regarded as enemies.  </p>
<p>I would encourage all pro-white people to stop using the vague and misleading term &#8220;race realist.&#8221;  Any term that can encompass those who wish for race replacement of white people should not be used to describe ourselves.  That&rsquo;s just common sense.  </p>

			<p>Whitecornerback is an example of why  racial intermarraige is a problem for the vast majority of Native Americans White Americans who do not marry outside of their race. Marrying outside of ones race brings about a change in ones racial allegiance.</p>
<p>Asians in America-at their current scale-have already inflicted severe damage upon Native Born White Americans. When the scale of the Asian presence increases beyond what it is today, the scale of the damage to Native Born White Americans will be even much greater. So let me put some flesh and blood on asian aggresion towards Native Born White Americans. Take my late father. He was a veteran, a devout Catholic father of seven and a mechanical engineer. My late father along with thousands of other Native Born White Men in the engeinnering profession were replaced by asian and muslim scab engineering workers during the seventies-1972 and 1977. when this occured the asian immigrant population was much smaller than it is today.Billy Reed the editor of the American Engineeering Association used to write about this in his news letter.  However, it was highly focused in one profession which made the impact of LEGAL asian immigration nontrivial. Another example. Several years ago a Native Born American Male shot his brains out in the parking lot of the bank he used to work at as a computer programmer. This was a bank in the San Franicisco area. He shot himself in the head after he was forced to train his H-1b replacements from India. Go over to Brenda Walkers web sight and check out the Victims Wall. Account after account of devasting Native Born White Americans whose families have been greatly harmed by LEGAL immigrant asian tech scab workers.</p>
<p>It really bothers some people that Native Born White America put several Native Born White Americans on the moon. It apparrently bothers you White cornerback that I pointed this out.This is an indication of where your current racial allegiance is. Here is a litmus test for White Nationalst:do you prefer a California State Univeristy that will have a large asian &#8220;American&#8221; student body or one that was 90 percent white like it was before the passage of the 1965 immigration refrom act.</p>
<p>Legal asian immigrants and their &#8220;American&#8221; born gene-line do not harbor benign intetions to the majority Native Born White American population. The benefit of LEGAL asian immigration to Native Born White Americans is 0 unless you beleive White America is too stupid to produce its own medical doctors,engineers and computer programmers. The LEGAL asian immigrant and it&rsquo;s &#8220;American&#8221; born gene-line would have us believe this. So would the White guys who have a fixation on asian women. Very weird.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The fixation on &lsquo;race purity&rsquo; flies in the face of history and genetics.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tendentious examples in your post involve a miniscule portion of the world&rsquo;s population. How many Chinese have any non-Asian ancestry? </p>
<p>&#8220;It was estimated a few decades ago that in the American South, about 85 percent of the population that &ldquo;passed&rdquo; for white has some African blood.&#8221;</p>
<p>Estimated by whom and published where?</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;When the Moors of North Africa conquered and invaded Spain before the Middle Ages tremendous amounts of African blood entered Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tremendous&#8221; amounts? Not really. And this, like your other examples, is the result of invasion, conquest and rapine, not &#8220;romantic&#8221; attraction.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the recent influx of Hispanics - almost all of whom are &ldquo;mixed race&rdquo; - into the South in recent years, the South is now a lot more like Brazil than North Dakota!&#8221;</p>
<p>Why should anyone want the American south to be more like Brazil than ND? That is something to be avoided. As for &#8220;hispanics,&#8221; they are msotly amerind with an increasingly small admixture of European ancestry. They are as alien a race as it&rsquo;s possible to be. What makes their presence here desirable?</p>
<p>&#8220;So watcha [sic] gonna [sic] do? People are not going to stop being people [really? what a discovery], and they are going to continue marrying and mating with the cutest, handsomest, smartest, richest guys/gals they can find!&#8221;</p>
<p>The natural tendency of people is marriage within kinship groups, exceptions notwithstanding. That is what about 95% of Americans do, despite several decades&rsquo; worth  of miscegenation propaganda. You talk as though the fact that some oily swarthy raped a Spanish woman in the eighth century exerts some kind of power over the free choices of contemporary Americans. It is perfectly obvious, from the example of places like Brazil, that a population comprised of half-castes, mulattos and mestizos bodes ill for the civilizational prospects of this or any nation. Why shouldn&rsquo;t a wholly preventable evil be opposed?</p>
<p>&#8220;C&rsquo;mon all you AmRen folk, stop pretending you&rsquo;d take Roseanne Barr over Halle Berry&#8221;</p>
<p>They can both jump off a cliff as far as I&rsquo;m concerned. In any case this is a ridiculous straw man. <br>

			<p>Jupiter   &mdash;   I&rsquo;m sorry if your late dad got replaced by a scab worker.  The particular race of the scab SHOULDN&rsquo;T MATTER, but if the H1-B visa program makes scabbery more likely, then I&rsquo;d say do away with the program.  My understanding, and I&rsquo;m open to contrary arguments from Brenda Walker and others, is that there is a lack of white young people in graduate engineering, science and medical studies.  They&rsquo;re not studying this challenging material because of inferior K-12 education, screwed-up parenting by baby boomers, and most of all, a decandent, destructive popular culture that produces spoiled, immature, undisciplined kids looking for the quick, easy, glamourous buck.  Given these factors, a little competition from a few less spoiled Asians would seems to be a salutory kick in the butt.  </p>
<p>I certainly would prefer for 90% of the students in engineering programs were white, but not if it means radically reducing the number of overall slots, and not if it requires affirmative action for whites!  And if you&rsquo;re going to claim that the reason white kids aren&rsquo;t going to engineering school is because the deck is stacked against them in job hiring, I&rsquo;m gonna say that you sound just like a whining black. </p>
<p>Also, my pride in being a white person, appreciating my heritage and trying to preserve it develeoped AFTER becoming involved with my now-wife, getting to know her and her family and visiting her country made me realize the importance of race and kinship and cultural differences.  As many have pointed out, Asians have a much more realistic attitude towards race than most whites.  It was only after meeting her, and also moving to a multicultural big city wasteland, that I came to appreciate where I came from (small town white America), my connection with it and the larger European civilization that it is a small part of.  </p>

			<p>white comerback, excellent post!<br>
Amren is an amazing tool for us to discuss and understand the changing world around us. I hope that it can also help us develop strategies to become more aware of our precarious situation in our own country and to address the many problems and discriminations that we face every day.</p>
<p>There are white nationalists and white racialists here but I don&rsquo;t think that each side can&rsquo;t talk to each other. We all agree on which groups are the most problematic and I think we have to address this in the near future with new policies that are clear and far sighted. Even MSM will at some point have to acknowledge the destructive behavior of these groups and present some version of reality and not the total fantasy of today.</p>
<p>Some whites are against all non-white groups and this is where I disagree with them. We already have the asians in our country and we can&rsquo;t turn the clock back to before their mass arrival. I am certain that most e and some se asians are perfectly able to integrate smoothly into white society and even those who don&rsquo;t won&rsquo;t be killing, raping, mugging, and causing general mayhem in our cities. </p>
<p>The asians are still a fairly small group and my focus is to keep them that way while aggressively dealing with the violent criminal blacks and hispanics to reduce their population through deportation, prisons, new legislations, segregation, and by making them responsible for their own welfare. </p>
<p>Whites have to get out of the black preservation business.</p>

<p>But questioning National Loyalty based on race is a little bit antiquated.</p>
<p>My programming prowess, which is based upon mastery of English and Calculus, was wholly learned here in the United States of America.</p>
<p>I can tell you from experience that it is very embarrassing to correct a fellow Engineer on his English and Algebra.  Did the corrected Engineer develop a sense of racial elitism over the incident?  Probably so.  I know he refused to talk to me ever again.  What was I supposed to do?  Let the error go?</p>
<p>What are Asians supposed to do?  Dummy down?</p>
<p>If anyone on American Renaissance can provide a sensible answer to the aforementioned questions, I would be more than eager to entertain such answers.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we have a country to support, expand, improve, and to defend   &mdash;   the United States of America.</p>
<p>I hope you find solace, Mr. Jupiter.</p>
<p>Mr. White Cornerback, yours was a very good commentary.</p>

<p>And you have that right to feel and believe in that if you like and even if it is based on propaganda, but once your kids are adults, they have the right to date which ever race they choose to, case in point; I have a cousin that married out of her race, her parents were so strict and taught her well about her race and to be proud and they did all they could, but in the end, she still married a White man, so you can try, but ultimately the decision will be theirs not yours.</p>

			<p>Whitecornerback</p>
<p>Go have a look at the the Victims Wall over at Brenda Walker&rsquo;s website.</p>
<p>Where post-1965 asian-LEGAL immigrants have moved in, Native Born White Americans have moved out.They vot with their feet against LEGAL asian immigration. These asian controlled areas of America are alien and hostile to Native Born White Americans. This is classic race-replacement supported and cheered on by both Whitecornerback and realist. What is the benefit of this to Native Born White Americans? There is no benefit.It is a loss of White territory and the resources that come with it.If you look at the areas that asians have moved into, housing and property taxes are extraordinary high. It is not a coincidence. The resources of these areas of America where post-1965 asians have moved are scarce:land is scarce,space in schools is scarce and high wage jobs are made scarce. There are plenty of examples of this from across the nation:NJ,Long Island and California. Without a doubt asians are pushing up housing costs and in doing so drive up the property taxes. Toss in a reassessment and you basically become a renter from the county in the home you supposedly own. And you can lose it in a tax lien sale to a predatory asian LEGAL immigrant. I have seen this happen where I live. Because asians drive up the cost of living in the areas the move to in OUR America, Native Born White Americans are made much more economically  insecure.Fewer paychecks separate Native Born White families from the steet. To do this to Native Born White American Families is an attack upon community. This is an act of violence against Native Born White American families.</p>
<p>In the areas of America where post-1965 asians move into. Young Native Born White American Males are in direct competition with young post-1965 asian males for affordable breeding spave. Over the past two years in the NYT there was a front page story about delayed marriage in the youn Native Born White American. The main reason for this acording to the New York Times is inability of increasing number of young White Males to afford a home which is a precondition for marriage and family. The times pointed out that there is now a growing population of White Males living alone in apartments who end up dying alone. This is just what you would predict when you force young White Males to compete for the scarce resources of an area of America infested with post-1965 asians. This is an act of violence against Native Born White American Males.</p>
<p>Whiteconerback, by marrying an asian, you racial allegiance has switched. You have done your part to change the racial compostion of America. Your silly comment about Whites needing a &#8220;little bit&#8221; of competition from asians reeks of nastiness towards the majority Native Born White population.</p>
<p>Realist, would you like to reveal your ethnicity?</p>

<p>Cho and the guy in Manitoba were psychos. The fact that they were Asian was irrelevant.<br>
 Charles Whitman, Harris and Kliebold (?), the Green River Killers, Boston Strangler, Son of Sam, Richard Speck, Charles Starkweather, Richard Beigenwald and a host of others were not Asian.<br>
The Manitoba incident was another example of lousy immigration policies for which the Canadians are just as guilty as are we.</p>
<p>Good news. The illegal Mexican Jose Medellín was executed yesterday in Huntsville TX for the rape and murder of two teenage girls some years ago. May God bless Texas and the precious few other states that aren&rsquo;t afraid to kill killers.</p>

<p>As I too have long suspected.  They may often be Whites who at some earlier point in their lives got swept away in the love-see-no-color, &ldquo;we are the world&rdquo; type of propaganda.  They then married some non-White.  Flash forward some years later and they find themselves at the dinner table,  possibly eating  foreign food looking across the table at a non-White spouse and their mixed children that don&rsquo;t resemble them at all.  They suddenly realize that they traded away their genetic legacy to follow some vapid trend, but they are now buried in a situation they truly cannot extricate themselves from.  Perhaps they even have trouble connecting with their foreign-looking children so unlike themselves.</p>
<p>They may be really envious of  the Whites that had too much sense to buy into that same race-mixing propaganda and who today enjoy a marriage with a co-racial and children that look like themselves and other White family members.  Real Whites who continued their excellent European lines instead of snuffing them out in a trendy bid to prove they weren&rsquo;t racist.  It may be tough in public for them if when they are alone with their child people ask if the man adopted from China or Korea and then remark to the White family next to him how their attractive White kids are so like their parents.</p>
<p>They also can&rsquo;t face the notion that their race-mixing is the same as wf/bm and so get on boards like this in order to get &ldquo;a nod&rdquo; that their Asian marriage and mixed family can be counted as White.  And then they make ridiculous assertions that Whites can be &ldquo;improved&rdquo; by mixing with Asians.  Today I saw a white man, his Asian wife and their Asian daughter.  The girl was 100% Asian appearance, you could not tell she had a white father.  Just how does being genetically non-represented in a family that you created count as improvement?  That&rsquo;s more like erasure.  Whites created the modern world we live in today without Asians, who are still heavily involved in copying and pirating all of our creations while pouring into our countries often illegally or on H-1 visas begging for jobs at companies founded by Whites.  Can anyone seriously believe that mixing our valuable White DNA with these third-world aliens is going to improve Whites?  Probably only sad race-traitors who don&rsquo;t want to be shut out of White nationalism. So they try to shoehorn their Asian family in by pushing this laughable, awkward canard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They also created a problem for me - I don&rsquo;t want their mixed offspring or any nonwhites marrying my kids.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ditto and likewise.  I stand staunchly in the WN camp and really the issue is not how Asians behave in White countries.  The problem is that they are here at all. Every race needs its space to thrive and reach it&rsquo;s full potential, and Whites have a right to our space free from racial aliens regardless of who those aliens might be.  I don&rsquo;t want some race-traitor&rsquo;s mixed offspring nor any other non-Whites marrying my kids either.</p>

			<p>Dear god, are we talking to brick walls here? How do you guys who oppose any non whites being in this country propose to get them all out? Are you sure that this type  of action is something that most of us white people can or are willing to take on? If you are advocating a purging of all non-whites by violence and/or force then you will surely alienate many whites everywhere!</p>
<p>I think most reasonable white people in US or in Europe are not willing to promote violence and forced deportation of lawful immigrants of any color including non-criminal blacks!! Please don&rsquo;t wallow in fantasies and vent here because it really isn&rsquo;t productive. We need to assess our current situation and go into damage control and come to some acceptable solution that will be beneficial to us the majority whites as well as being humane and rational towards others.</p>
<p>I am very close to being a libertarian, if a white person marries a law abiding and hard working non-white, it is their business. Our focus should be on limiting how many immigrants we allow into the country. The descendents of the interracial marriage will gradually become mostly white if we keep our population as majority white people. Like I&rsquo;ve said before, any productive and law abiding non-whites are not hateful to me. I only detest and abhorr the criminal, the violent, and the cheaters and moochers of our welfare system.</p>
<p>I have no superiority complex but still want to preserve our white culture because it is just as valuable as any other culture. I expect others&rsquo; to respect my choices as I respect their&rsquo;s in their lives. I don&rsquo;t dislike anyone of any color who is a good citizen but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I want to have children with them or have my children breed with them.</p>

I find that to be so too.  And much of the commentary above proves it.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;But questioning National Loyalty based on race is a little bit antiquated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve seen lots of Asians come on this board and make similar self-serving statements.  Of course, it is still expected that Asia belongs strictly to Asians, and they wouldn&rsquo;t tolerate boatloads of Africans or any other race colonizing their countries.  So the philosophy seems to go &ldquo;what&rsquo;s mine is mine&rdquo; but then when it comes to White societies &ldquo;what&rsquo;s yours can be mine too.&rdquo;  Asians are so eager to grab at a piece of the pie baked by Whites that it becomes inconvenient for them whenever Whites notice the logical connections between national loyalty, sovereignty and race for themselves.  It&rsquo;s natural when Asians do it for their homelands, but &ldquo;antiquated&rdquo; if Whites do.  Asians embrace their right to their space, but bristle at the notion of Whites&rsquo; right to the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can tell you from experience that it is very embarrassing to correct a fellow Engineer on his English and Algebra.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My husband, White of course, feels the same way.  He holds a high level IT programming position and changed jobs a few months back.  He was frustrated in his prior position because he was called upon to spend ridiculous amounts of time correcting mistakes made by Asian programmers.  He found a higher salaried job at a well-known company that wisely decided to utilize White male talent for their IT team instead of Asian foreigners.  He now enjoys focusing on cutting edge programming for their business and has already won much trust and praise for his efforts despite being a relative newcomer to the company.  Definitely a step up over being &ldquo;clean-up man&rdquo; for shoddy Asian work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did the corrected Engineer develop a sense of racial elitism over the incident? Probably so. I know he refused to talk to me ever again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maybe, maybe not.  It could be that he just got fed up with his land being colonized by racial foreigners.  When I was younger and the country was solidly White it was easier to feel friendliness toward the occasional visiting non-White foreign national.  Now that they&rsquo;re no longer just visiting and our formerly White hometowns are becoming seas of black, yellow and brown faces I have become rather cold towards them myself.  It&rsquo;s just difficult to be friendly and of good cheer during an invasion.  Would Asians be fine with it if blacks, muslims, or any other manner of racially alien people were colonizing their home cities in Asia?  Certainly not, but Whites are expected to &ldquo;celebrate&rdquo; our own displacement, while Asians seem to expect to have their cake and eat ours too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My programming prowess, which is based upon mastery of English and Calculus, was wholly learned here in the United States of America&hellip;.What are Asians supposed to do? Dummy down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another Asian tooting his own horn about how smart Asians are, yet coming to the White man&rsquo;s land, to learn at the White man&rsquo;s schools and get a job in White society.  (BTW,  I believe the term is &ldquo;dumb-down&rdquo; not &ldquo;dummy down.&rdquo;).  Those pesky ol&rsquo; questions continue to dog &mdash; if Asians are so intelligent compared to Whites why are they coming to our schools and immigrating to live among us in such huge numbers? If Asians are so bright why haven&rsquo;t they established the premier societies that everyone is dying to get into?  Why do they have such rampant piracy of White creations?  Why don&rsquo;t you want to live amongst your own people?  As to what Asians are supposed to do &mdash; how about going home and building Asia instead of insisting on your right to a place in the society that the White man built?  Societies established by Whites are for Whites and their children.<br>

Please don&rsquo;t wallow in fantasies and vent here because it really isn&rsquo;t productive. We need to &hellip;. come to some acceptable solution that will be beneficial to us&hellip; as well as being humane and rational towards others.&#8221;<br>

 *  Most people with jobs, homes, and  full stomachs are not in favor of deportation right NOW.  But &#8220;our current situation&#8221; could change radically at any moment, given a  war, a terror strike, or economic collapse.   &mdash;    all of which are not  farfetched possibilities.  In that case, these notions will not be fantasies. They will become instant realities.</p>
<p>PS. I too don&rsquo;t hate or dislike anyone because of their color. And I agree with the need to be humane and rational. No argument there.  A humane and just way will have to be  found to end/curtail immigration and encourage repatriation.</p>

<p>It will be very interesting see how Native Born White Americans react when they realize that they have lost a tremendous amount of territory to Mexcio and a few other nations.</p>
<p>Here is something to think about. Immediately after 9/11 the lid of civility was completely blown off. The muslims and asians were very nervous and fearfull. They were in fact fearfull of mass deportations. They were justifed in their fear. The mood in Native Born White America had turned against them a very serious way.</p>
<p>For example, At Tech companies EGAL immigrant asians were recieving a massive a massive amount of hate mail from their Native Born White co-workers. The situation was so out of controll that the tech companies went out and hired clinical psychologists to counsel the traunatized LEGAL immigrant asian scab workers. This was a front page story in the NYT two weeks after 9/11.</p>
<p>I will say with one hundred percent certainty that the anger and rage at both asian and muslims in America is just right below the surface after 9/11 provide a lot of evidence for this. The Bush administration was so terified of a major backlash against muslims that two weeks after 9/11 the wicked KArl Rove had Bush invite several dozen mullahs to do a photo op on the front lawn of the White House.</p>
<p>If one of those passenger jetsslammed into Indian Point nuclear power plant  just below peekskill, muslim legal immigration would have shut down to 0 and the muslims who are here legally would have been all deported. Also there would ave been much less tlerance of the Asians and their shennanigans.</p>
<p>As the Putnam study makes very clear, American has devolved into several race-based nations.None ofthese groups have positive feelings towards the other. It is very much within the relm of possibility therefor that Native Born White Americans will view hispanics,asians and post 1965 africans and afro-carribeans as invaders and act accordingly.<br>

<p>Actually, I think you are the one that is ruled by emotion rather than reason.  You lack the moral imagination to tolerate reasonable differences among your fellow citizens, tolerance that is a distinctive characteristic of white, western civilization.  Just because it would be catastrophic for a large percentage of whites to marry outside their race, or be homosexual, or die without having children, it does not follow that individuals who through particular circumstance are unable to marry within their race, have heterosexual relations, or produce offspring, cannot find other ways to live useful, productive, civilized lives and be a credit to their nation and their race.    </p>
<p>Regarding the lack of affordable housing, how would removing skilled asian workers and replacing them with white skilled workers make housing any cheaper?  If every Asian at Microsoft was replaced by a white person, wouldn&rsquo;t you still have the same number of people seeking to purchase the same number of houses?  Like I said, you sound like a whiner.  Perhaps you should demand your forty acres and a mule.  </p>
<p>realist   &mdash;   &#8220;How do you guys who oppose any non whites being in this country propose to get them all out?&#8221;</p>
<p>First of all, with roughly 25% of America currently one minority or another, understand we&rsquo;re talking about 75 million people or so.  Basically, the options are genocide, property confiscation and forced migration, mandatory sterilization, or ceding large parts of the United States to &#8220;hostile aliens.&#8221;  </p>
<p>The latter involves dividing up the country into white and non-white areas, confiscating property and deporting millions of minorities from the white areas to the large areas that we would have to give up, and vice versa, then ceding Texas, the Southwest and California to &#8220;Aztlan,&#8221; and much of the southeast to the Republic of New Afrika.  </p>
<p>A stupid goal.  All kinds of people have pointed this out, including Sam Francis (see Amren archives from around 1995).  </p>
<p>What white separatists and white nationalists ignore is the fact that America has never been an exclusively white country.  (Thanks in large measure to the real race traitors, those who saw fit to import for their own short-term profit millions of blacks onto America soil in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.)  Like British India, Rhodesia, South Africa and Australia, America was a country dominated by whites. Unlike those other countries, it can return to that state again, if we gain control over our demographics and immigration.    <br>

<p>I would prefer to live in an America of 33O Native Born White Americans-more accurate estimate of currnt US population size-then one where Whites are rapidly becomming a minority. Your assumption-and preference-about the interchangeability of Chinese living in China with White Americans living in America is something that White Nationalist completely reject. It does make a diference if the population growth came from the Native Born White population.</p>
<p>But the fact of the matter is Native Born White Americans brought their fertility level down to replacement level beginning in 1973 and has remained there ever since. For supposedly doing the right thing by the environment, Native Born White Americans have been taken advantage of punished by the phony environmentalist(this includes all those professional environmentalist) hispanics,asians muslims and post-1965 immigrant africans. This is a completely irrational environmental policy. To punish Native Born White Americans for bringing down their fertility to replacement level is irrational. There is no longer any incentive for Native Born White Americans to be good environmentalist. Therefor the phony environmentalist shouldn&rsquo;t be shocked if the Native Born White population starts to increase its fertility level. And when this happens,watch and see how loud the lefties scream about  what a terrible thing this is while they cheer on massive population growth through massive non-white immigration.</p>
<p>If Native Born White American fertility does increase without a massive reduction in immigration-down to 0-the US population will explode to over a billion,possibly within the next 25 years. It is going to be a major ecological catastrophe. The most likely scenario is that life is going to be a dystopian living hell in the near future. Resources will be very scarce and the nation will be balkanized along racial nationalist lines. There will be violent conflict over borders within the US and violent conflict over access to scarce resources within the US.Mass deportation will also -with very high probability-provoke a violent response from hispanicsand other non-white groups.. Honestly we have reached the point of no return. All of this is so obvious.</p>

			<p>I do NOT agree that the fact (that they were Asian) was necessarily irrelevant! <br>
Even a psychiatrist with a Chinese name (whose quote I read in one of the news articles) said that it could have been a cultural way of releasing of releasing immigration stress.</p>

<p>Yes. The very same. I&rsquo;ve always felt that some of the anti-Asian and anti- Jewish ranting draws our focus away from the true problem in the US i.e. out of control Black sociopathy &amp; psychopathy and illegal immigration. </p>

<p>I do not want my children to suffer thru a dystopia which you seem to anticipate with relish and perhaps some glee? I want them to live in an orderly and wealthy society with strong legal rules and enforcement. I don&rsquo;t want my family to experience civil war and violence just to ensure that there are no non-whites which probably isn&rsquo;t something we can achieve anyway. </p>
<p>Most of us envision a peaceful majority white american society with a well integrated small minority of non-violent and high achieveing non-white immigrants. (We should take in more white immigrants and they won&rsquo;t have any problems with assimilating.) Ideally they should be immigrants with the highest IQs and least criminal lifestyles. </p>
<p>We hope that soon the blacks and hispanics will be neutralized by very harsh criminal laws and enforcement. Violent and criminal blacks and hispanics should be in jail or executed and segregated into their own area with sterilization as a legal enforcement method. </p>
<p>Illegal and/or criminally violent mexicans, hondurans, puerto ricans, salvadoreans, haitians, or criminal anyone etc&hellip;. will be deported back or be forced back to their respective hell holes. This should help shrink down the most criminal of these people. </p>
<p>This is an achieveable goal, not your fantasy of an all white America purged of every non-white immigrants. And small numbers of interracial marriages don&rsquo;t bother me at all since most people marry within their group. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want my children to mix but if that is what they want to do, that is also their choice. I have no value judgment on mixed marriages and there are good/bad and good looking/ugly people in all racial groups but my only concern is if our culture is lost through excessive mixing. But I don&rsquo;t think this is going to happen. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that most average, educated, and non-terrorist non-white immigrants generally want to become &#8216;american&rsquo; which means mainstream white. I&rsquo;ve never met a middle class immigrant parent happy with their kids rapping, speaking ebonics, hanging out with blacks/hispanics, and/or running with gangs.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s work with what we&rsquo;ve got now. Sure, if I had my druthers, I&rsquo;d go back in time and stop the black slavery trade before it even starts but, oh no, I don&rsquo;t have a time machine. :(</p>

<p>Is it really your kids choice to marry another race when all the messages they receive is that they need to mix with other races?  No and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s up to parents to show their kids the pitfalls of marrying another race/culture and the rewards of marrying your race.  </p>

<p>You think that they mix because we all tell them they need to mix??? Huh??? Of course we teach the kids our values??? Most parents of any ethnicity teach their kids their values just as we here on this site assume most of us would do the same. </p>
<p>If you think you can control your kids, good luck. I pray, teach, and raise them the best that I can to counter popular media and then leave the rest to god, their IQ, and their commmon sense. At some point (around 16-18), it starts becoming more and more their choice and their decision in how to lead their lives. Most parents just hope and pray that they&rsquo;ve done enough to guide their chilren.</p>

			<p>The reason white men marry Asian women is that they see them as being cute and submissive compared to white women. They believe that Asian women take care of their men better than the careminded white women. If you don&rsquo;t believe this then explain to me why there are so many mail order bride webpages filled with Filipinas and that white men are going to the Philippines and marrying these women and bring them back to the states?</p>

What do you consider a &#8220;small minority&#8221;?  Or &#8220;just a few&#8221;?  (And what do THEY consider it to be?  Remember that they will have a voice too.) </p>
<p>Ideally, your solution may sound very nice and acceptable   &mdash;   in pure theory   &mdash;    but in reality, there is never such a thing as &#8220;enough&#8221;  when it comes to ethnic groups.   Every national/racial group, once in,  lobbies and agitates  to get more of its own kind.  And then more. And still more. Some of them want more of ANY other group   &mdash;   just to weaken the hated, distrusted majority.   Unfortunately, there is no such thing as  &#8220;just a few&#8221;.  Ask THEM what they would consider an acceptable number!</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that white men who look for &#8220;mail order brides&#8221; are more thrilled about Filipina women than about, for example, getting a beautiful(not cute) Russian women who advertises in this way.</p>
<p>In any case, to answer Rachel&rsquo;s concerns and other white women over the denigrating way some white guys characterize white women who go with other races, you must understand the thinking behind it. First, I&rsquo;m not trying to be patronizing by saying this I really believe it  &mdash;   the vast majority of white men instinctively are drawn to white women above all other women. this is true because that is their background. Their mothers, their sisters, friends, etc, are usually white and who they relate to. Then, as so many posters have pointed out a number of times, white women are probably the most beautiful, in general, women in the world. Now can you see the jealousy, the feelings of loss, the feelings of rejection many white men have when they see white women leaving the flock, so to speak. </p>

<p>Good point, it&rsquo;s exactly that, White dominance. That is what this whole thing is about. Hypocritical at its worst! In other words; to marry an Asian woman because she is so submissive and subservient then it is fine. Whites shouldn&rsquo;t think that the Asian community belongs to them or any other non-White community for that matter and think they can do with and or decide which can reside with Whites and which ones cannot. This is beyond childish and so indicative of White selfishness.<br>
Most Asian women would rather prefer to stay within their race, but there are some that want to marry non-Asian, be it Brown, Muslim, Black or White, remember Whites don&rsquo;t have a say in this, they can think whatever they like, I know many that don&rsquo;t like whites because of this self-entitlement fantasy thinking. Worry about your own people and respect the diversity of Asians and with whom they&rsquo;d rather be with.</p>
