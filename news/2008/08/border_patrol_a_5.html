						<p>A U.S. Border Patrol agent was held at gunpoint Sunday night by members of the Mexican military who had crossed the border into Arizona, but the soldiers returned to Mexico without incident when backup agents responded to assist. </p>
<p>Agents assigned to the Border Patrol station at Ajo, Ariz., said the Mexican soldiers crossed the international border in an isolated area about 100 miles southwest of Tucson and pointed rifles at the agent, who was not identified. </p>
<p>It was unclear what the soldiers were doing in the United States, but U.S. law enforcement authorities have long said that current and former Mexican military personnel have been hired to protect drug and migrant smugglers. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, this sort of behavior by Mexican military personnel has been going on for years,&rdquo; union Local 2544 of the National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) said on its Web page. &ldquo;They are never held accountable, and the United States government will undoubtedly brush this off as another case of &lsquo;Oh well, they didn&rsquo;t know they were in the United States.&rsquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;It is fortunate that this incident didn&rsquo;t end in a very ugly gunfight,&rdquo; said the local&rsquo;s posting. </p>
<p>The NBPC represents all nonsupervisory personnel among the agency&rsquo;s 16,000 agents. </p>
<p>Border Patrol spokesman Michael Friel did not return calls for comment Tuesday. </p>
<p>State Department spokeswoman Nicole Thompson said Tuesday that the department had no information on the incident, and referred further questions to the Border Patrol. &ldquo;It is not an incident that we are aware of,&rdquo; she said. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Since 1996, there have been more than 200 confirmed incursions by the Mexican military into the United States. </p>

			<p>Notice that our current government will bankrupt the USA, send our nation into a recession, bring death and disability to thousands of our soldiers, and destroy the good will of the entire world toward the USA in order to &#8220;protect&#8221; the people of Iraq, but refuse to protect our southern border against the chaotic, dangerous, crime- and disease-infested failed nation of Mexico.  Watch how long (if at all) this incident remains as a news item in the MSM.</p>

			<p>  &#8220;Since 1996, there has been 200 confirmed incursions by the Mexican military into the United States&#8221;. There is also an invasion of their people into the United States. I would think this would be considered an act of war by Mexico. Where the Hell is Bush and the Pentagon? According to the constitution of the U.S. this should be considered an act of war, and the fact that Bush and our military ignore it, their actions should be considered treason.</p>

<p>Actually a gunfight is what it would take to put pressure on the Bush administration, John McCain and the cowards in Congress to defend our borders. Maybe. In the meantime, our brave border guards who shot the dope dealer from Mexico in the butt continue to rot in jail for doing their jobs. Mr. compassionate, George tough guy bush, hasn&rsquo;t lifted his finger to help them or pardon them. His love for Mexicans is incredible. We now know he forged documents to get us into the Iraq war.  For that and for imprisoning US officials defending our borders, this moron should be impeached and removed from office. But the Democrats run Congress. Despite their rhetoric, they voted with Bush to go into Iraq and they can&rsquo;t wait to open the borders even more if Obama wins.  I hope the govt is ordering plenty of AIDS medication. The AIDS rate will go thru the roof after a year of Obama, more immigrants and black celebrations in the street.</p>

			<p>Unbelievable, we have a foreign army infringing on American sovereignty and the worthless US government sits around with it&rsquo;s head in the sand. Yet, when the US government puts some National Guardsmen on the border to help out the Mexican government howls how unfair this is until the US government removes them. This situation is just ridiculous.</p>

			<p>So let me get this straight, people successfully crossed our border, with weapons/live ammo, and the border patrol threw their hands up? Isn&rsquo;t their job to GUARD the border from people with guns/ammo/explosives/IEDs/WMDs/etc. crossing from the other side? Why didn&rsquo;t they shoot? Or arrest them?</p>

<p>Good thing there was no gunfight.  If there had been and any of the Mexicans were killed, God knows the Border Patrol agents would have been prosecuted by our government.</p>

			<p>Is it not amazing the kind of leaders we have in this nation, that things could get this far? There was a time the Mexican government wouldn&rsquo;t dream of looking at American law enforcement sideways,for fear of the reaction they&rsquo;d receive.</p>

			<p>Thank God the BP Officer didn&rsquo;t have to fire on those Mexican soldiers. If he survived the gunfight he would have undoubtedly been prosecuted for violating their civil rights. That would have cost him about 10 or 11 years in the federal pen.</p>
<p>Of course, nothing will be said by our feckless leaders regarding this armed incursion by a foreign military. Sadly we can look forward to at least four more years of this with either Obama or McCain. </p>

<p>You can bet there will come a day when they just keep on coming, and they will be the ones with backup. By that time &#8220;Anglos&#8221; will be a disarmed minority, sitting huddled in our homes defenceless against the invading horde and their U.S. living allies.  </p>

			<p>Go figure how the Mexos got the money for the incursions. The Feds most likely sponsored the machines/artillary.  <br/>
According to recent news I read; this year Bush signed (in San Antonio,TX) and US AF Gen. Gene Renuart hailed the signing of a Civil Assistance Plan (CAP) to combine the US, Canada, &amp; Mexico army. Secretly behind our backs the Feds/State/Military complex is working to erase USA Borders.  Guess military does not want to defend US anymore.  Now it is the New World Order Military.  USA is just another country forced to pay for our own destruction.  Bush I started the process &amp; Bush II is orchestrating the finalization before election. Please call for Bush resignation. <br/>
This smells of treason.   V</p>

They hear of everything. The affrontery of this claim of ignorance is breathtaking. Except when you realize that it&rsquo;s business as usual. </p>

			<p>The Border Patrol SHOULD have engaged the Mexican military with lethal force.</p>
<p>A - They have a perfect right to do so.</p>
<p>B -  The resulting news coverage/frenzy would be priceless. </p>
<p>C - Can you really see a jury convicting the Americans for using lethal force in self defence against a foreign army that had invaded the United States? (Unless the jury was all Mexican, of course).</p>

<p>No, it&rsquo;s very unfortunate that it didn&rsquo;t. A nation that won&rsquo;t defend its borders against armed enemy incursions is on its way to the dustbin of history.  </p>
<p>No doubt the Mexican soldiers were defending a major drug shipment. And we help, by permitting it.</p>

<p>The United States State Department has &#8220;no information on the incident?&#8221; If Ms. Thompson spoke truthfully she would have said: &#8220;this is not an incident that we are allowed by the Executive Branch to become aware of, let alone properly act on.&#8221; </p>

			<p>And WHERE, might one ask, is our Federal Government&rsquo;s response to this act of foreign aggression? We get oh, so concerned, about whether Iran has a nuclear program   &mdash;   which would not amount to a hill of beans for at least another decade or more. While the REAL enemy lurks just beyond the U.S.-Mexican border.</p>
<p>I can just &#8216;hear&rsquo; Obama&rsquo;s answer, should he actually get to be prez: &#8220;We need to tear down those walls. We need to accept MORE immigrants. Do MORE to help impoverished countries.&#8221; While Mexican drug cartels control the Mexican military and Mexican government   &mdash;   so they can ship their mind-poisoning drugs here with impunity.</p>

			<p>Fundamentally, I don&rsquo;t see any difference between Nazi Germany&rsquo;s invasion of France and the Immigration Invasion of the United States.</p>
<p>Well, there is one important difference.  Germany never hid the fact that they were Germans.<br/>
In that case, the people who orchestrated the invasion were the same ones who carried it out.  Today, the ones who orchestrated our invasion are NOT the ones doing the invading.  </p>
<p>But as everyone knows - except for those who don&rsquo;t want to know or who just plain don&rsquo;t care - the same people who have us in Iraq, and will probably have us in Iran, are the ones responsible for our Immigration Crisis. But they hide. When they do surface it&rsquo;s with the assurance that they are above reproach. And that brings us to what very well might be the defining feature of those in power today.  A feature that sets them apart from every other power of the past.</p>
<p>Whereas it&rsquo;s true that no Authority has ever allowed itself to be criticized, today those in control do not even want themselves to even be RECOGNIZED!</p>
<p>THAT is unprecedented in World History.</p>
<p>This point should not be lost. Those in power today hide. They hide behind Flags, Documents, Institutions, other Countries, Slanderous Accusations, etc. You name it.  Even the Dark Ages had more nobility. Actually our time in History doesn&rsquo;t have any - except in individual, isolated cases.  Or with Groups that, as yet, have no power.  Those in power today are so thoroughly ignoble, craven, and dishonest, not to mention ruthless and mericiless, that it is virtually unprecedented in History.</p>

			<p>&#8220;So let me get this straight, people successfully crossed our border, with weapons/live ammo, and the border patrol threw their hands up? Isn&rsquo;t their job to GUARD the border from people with guns/ammo/explosives/IEDs/WMDs/etc. crossing from the other side? Why didn&rsquo;t they shoot? Or arrest them?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not their job to foolishly throw their lives away! One guy with a pistol against soldiers with automatic rifles? Tell you what&hellip;you take point. </p>

			<p>Never before has the West made it a crime to defend itself.  As Michael Scott said, we had no problems being patriotic and fighting off enemies in the past, but now we don&rsquo;t want to offend mexican illegals and muslims fanatics.  I wish white western men would, pardon me saying, get some balls!</p>

<p>One difference is that France had declared war on Germany, whereas the U.S. hasn&rsquo;t declared war on Mexico.</p>

			<p>Read &#8220;Domestic Enemies: The Reconquista&#8221; by Matthew Bracken. This very realistic novel lays out our future, and how we will lose the Southwest.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;d love to help the Minutemen secure our borders, but as a 52 yr old woman in bad health, I would be more of a liability than an asset. Is there anything ordinary citizens can do to stop this treason? </p>

			<p>I live and work in SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS&hellip;far far away from the border&hellip;I work at the county jail&hellip;and I know of TWO instances where MEXICAN MILITARY crossed OUR border and ended up HERE&hellip;arrested for TERRORISTIC THREATS&hellip;and were waiting to be picked up by ICE&hellip;you can NOT tell me that these people DIDN&rsquo;T know they were in OUR country!&hellip;by the way, THEY were picked up QUICKLY by ICE&hellip;yet, OTHER illegals are being kept here for MONTHS!&hellip;ICE is NOT interested in picking THEM up!&hellip;and they are here for VIOLENT crimes NOT crimes like DWI!&hellip;THOSE crimes are being committed by the Mexican TRUCK DRIVERS being allowed to drive their trucks on OUR highways!&hellip;and there ARE a LOT of them in our jail!<br/>
These &#8220;incursions&#8221; make me wonder if they are SCOPING out OUR country for the MEXICAN GOVERNMENT to see how easy it would be to out and out INVADE, TAKE OVER and CRUSH the AMERICAN PEOPLE and AMERICA!&hellip;like RUSSIA invading GEORGIA!&hellip;if THAT happens you can BET that OUR government &#8220;leaders&#8221; will react the same way as they are right now on the Russian/Georgian problem&hellip;TALK TALK TALK and do NOTHING but ROLL OVER and LET IT HAPPEN!<br/>
Living here in San Antonio feels like it has ALREADY HAPPENED!</p>
