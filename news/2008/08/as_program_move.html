<h1><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/09/us/09housing.html">As Program Moves Poor to Suburbs, Tensions Follow</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Solomon Moore, New York Times, August 9, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Under the Section 8 federal housing voucher program, thousands of poor, urban and often African-American residents have left hardscrabble neighborhoods in the nation&rsquo;s largest cities and resettled in the suburbs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The foreclosure crisis gnawing away at overbuilt suburbs has accelerated that migration, and the problems. Antioch is one of many suburbs in the midst of a full-blown mortgage meltdown that has seen property owners seeking out low-income renters to fill vacant homes. The most recent Contra Costa County records available show that from 2003 to 2005, the number of Section 8 households in Antioch grew by 50 percent, to about 1,500 from 1,000. Many new residents are African-American; Antioch&rsquo;s black population has grown to about 20 percent, from 3 percent in 1990.</p>

			<p>This sickens me.  My dad grew up in Antioch.  He was part of a very small Spanish Catholic diaspora in a town of WASPs.  They were hardcore about forcing the group to assimilate, and so the Spanish did blend.  My great grandmother never spoke Spanish in public.  Hence my current resentment toward illegals&hellip;  This town has been through so much, and now this.  Heart breaking!  Antioch has some of the kindest and most decent people you will ever meet.  </p>

<p>&#8220;Payne, a 42-year-old African-American mother of five, moved to Antioch in 2006. With&hellip; a housing voucher covering two-thirds of the rent, she found she could afford a large, new home, with a pool, for $2,200 a month.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whitey pays $1500 dollars a month for this woman&rsquo;s rent.<br>
Can any poster tell us if this is a typical housing voucher across America?  </p>

<p>It seems to be. There has been an explosion of obvious fresh-from-the-hood blacks here in northern Chicagoland; they couldn&rsquo;t afford the market rate around here.</p>

			<p>To the poster @ 6:15  &mdash;  I do not know if this is a typical voucher or not.  I do not know as I am a working white and will never live as good as Ms. Payne.</p>
<p>I often wonder how they can afford the upkeep of the landscaping and pools in these places.  Or is there a voucher for that too?</p>

			<p>It is now happening in my neighborhood. Some minorities moved in our quiet neighborhood a few years back, thanks to the change in the housing market, soon they wound up in foreclosure, and now blacks are moving in them. They stand around in the driveway glaring as my white neigbors drive or walk to their homes. Their presence is menacing and unwelcome.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s not unusual for a large collection of Section 8s to cause a community neighborhood  to become ghettoized, and cause White flight.  These  people with Section 8s believe they have no responsibility to take care of the rented property, and have no problem in referring the landlord to the federal govt. if the property is trashed.   I believe the people in Antioch will figure this out in quick order.</p>

			<p>Ms. Payne, a 42-year-old African-American mother of five, moved to Antioch in 2006. With the local real estate market slowing and a housing voucher covering two-thirds of the rent, she found she could afford a large, new home, with a pool, for $2,200 a month. <br>

So, not only does whitey have to pay for his own house he now has to pay the rent-through taxes- for the blacks who live next door to him. Wait until they start handing out school vouchers for blacks to attend mainly white private schools. Say goodbye to a safe, agenda-free learning environment too.</p>

			<p>Our working class neighborhood has consisted of mostly white-occupied houses until the past few years. </p>
<p>Some homes in our neighborhood - which were &#8220;For Sale&#8221; for a long time - have now become rentals due to the declining housing market and this has become fertile ground for the Section 8 folks. </p>
<p>Three black males now occupy one rental which is five houses down from us. They don&rsquo;t dress like gang-bangers and we believe they may be from outside the USA. These guys sit out on the front steps on weekends with their front door wide open and no screen door in sight.</p>
<p>It is difficult to imagine what that house must look like on the inside with all the flies and other insects that have to be living in there with them. Sure glad I&rsquo;m not renting my house to this crowd!</p>

			<p>The town I grew up in was completely white, with beautiful large homes and tree lined streets.</p>
<p>Whites have since been run out of most of the town. </p>
<p>It started with the schools. Once they were ruined (many were really living in Newark, but the white liberals running the schools looked the other way)</p>
<p>But the section 8 thing makes sense. I always wondered how so many blacks were able to afford so many large and expensive homes. I figured they couldn&rsquo;t all have jobs with the state of NJ!</p>
<p>Give it another 20 years and the town will be destroyed. Blacks don&rsquo;t maintain houses, even when they own them. They don&rsquo;t tend the gardens as well, and they won&rsquo;t paint anything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen so many black ghettos around NJ where the actual houses were nicer and bigger (but older and unmaintained) than many of the suburban white areas.</p>

<p>Posted by kitty at 8:36 PM on August 12 </p>
<p>Kitty:</p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t perform any up-keep.  They shut off the sprinklers and let the landscaping and up-keep go to hell  &mdash;  after all, they figure that&rsquo;s the evil landlord&rsquo;s job.</p>
<p>Does anyone believe that Section 8 losers are going to take care of a pool?  &mdash;  let alone have any understanding of what is involved in the maintenance and expense of a pool?   I suspect it will be destroyed shortly, the filter broken, the water foul and filthy.  The landlord will be blamed, of course.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wondering why the pool wasn&rsquo;t filled in before it was rented out  &mdash;  especially to those with vouchers.</p>
<p>In California, we are having terrible problems with foreclosed homes in nice areas being turned into drug and alcohol  &mdash;  sometimes even sexual offender  &mdash;   re-hab facilities. It turns out this is a lucrative business for shady operators of these homes who collect fat paychecks from the state for taking in and &#8216;rehabilitating&rsquo; these offenders. They could care less about destroying neighborhoods.</p>
<p>When the neighbors fight back, they quickly find out that the sexual offenders, alcoholics, drug users have been designated as &#8216;disabled&rsquo; and protected under the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act).  Try fighting against that.  </p>
<p>I have heard many horror stories on talk radio about what it&rsquo;s like to live next to one of these horror houses  &mdash;  you can count on your property value plummeting instantly should one of these facilities take root in your once-peaceful neighborhood.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know which would be worse to have in one&rsquo;s neighborhood, Section 8 housing or a drug/alcohol/sex offender rehabilitation facility. Both destroy White neighborhoods  &mdash;  but then, maybe that&rsquo;s the point.</p>

			<p>This paradigm of rewarding those of us who are the least productive  in society has actually crossed over to where the most detrimental to society are rewarded.  </p>
<p>This is untenable.  We are burning through the collective wealth of our forefathers at an exponential rate.  You can challenge natures law of cause and effect only so long using credit and fancy bookeeping.  The bill always comes due, and when it does the pendulum always OVER swings to the other side. </p>
<p>So stay turned&hellip;</p>

			<p>Seems to be happening in the Detroit Suburbs as well. My city of 130,000 had 1,000 blacks back in 2000, now there are 10,000 as of 2008. Crime has shot up 20% since 2006. The local police department is understaffed since Michigan has a terrible economy. Back in 1990, There was 1 Black person in my High School and 2 Mulattos out of 1800 Students, now there are 2100 students in that same school with 200 of them being blacks. A lot of the Black people that live in my city are in rental homes and many dominate the apartment buildings around town where you did not see that 10 years ago.</p>

			<p>In Brentwood, East of Antioch - Section 8 terrorism exists on a lesser scale. The feds are forcing law-abiding citizens to live with destructive criminals. These voucher vultures are dragging civilization down to a 3rd world level, and any dissent is considered &#8220;racism.&#8221; HUD&rsquo;s Section 8 must be abolished. The motto should be &#8220;We put hood-neighbors in good neighborhoods&#8221;<br>

<p>This probably isn&rsquo;t exactly what you are observing&hellip; but there&rsquo;s a difference between a black area and a sort of crime-center area. A place where most blacks would feel lucky not to live. A large city will have some of these area&rsquo;s not centered on public housing. Being desperate and destitute does not automatically mean having bad taste, and some of these &#8216;crime centers&rsquo; are located in nicer or more interesting areas of the neglected inner-city. Who is going to argue with them about their choice of home?</p>
<p>Most wont noticed the superior architecture being they are so afraid while being around it in the first place. </p>

			<p>Anyone who would rent a large new home to a black with a Section 8 voucher is an absolute fool.  The house would need total rehab within two years costing many thousands of dollars.  Its not an accident these people are poor.  </p>

			<p><i>It is now happening in my neighborhood. </i></p>
<p>Mine, too. The previous neighborhood I lived in was about 90% Mexican, and I never felt as uncomfortable and unsafe there as I do in my current neighborhood which is only about 5-10% black.</p>
<p>There is definitely something to be said for living in a Mexican neighborhood: it&rsquo;s the only place a white person can go anymore to get away from the blacks.</p>

   Why haven&rsquo;t white people brought up the legitimate issue that it is unfair to give a person / parasite a home that is equal in value to what we have to work and pay for.  Seems like this would be anice way to stop Section 8, by sending petitions to the legislators demanding that they be given only minimum housing allowances since it&rsquo;s all free for them. </p>
<p>   But I guess it&rsquo;s the fear part, that communities would be afraid to organize the petitions and speak out for fear of reprisal from &#8221; them&#8221;.  I think our laid-back politicians would do a little something if we organized and fought Section 8, as long as enough people would sign the petitions.  Your thoughts ?</p>

<p>Remember:  The &#8216;them&rsquo; we fear is the federal government  &mdash;  they have all the power, backed by force.  The government has the ultimate power to destroy White lives and communities through punitive taxation, implementation of legal policies that shut Whites out of jobs, scholarships and colleges, forced integration, control of the K-12 school curriculum, and the ability to force Section 8 into peaceful, settled White communities.</p>
<p>This is done on purpose. </p>
<p>Government heavily favors this small minority at the devastating expense of the majority.  Government sponsorship is the only way 13% of the population can control the majority.</p>
<p>It will take another Revolution to undo this; it may be too late.</p>

<p>It seems strange indeed to me that the most ardent proponents of diversity rarely, if ever, personally experience it themselves!</p>
