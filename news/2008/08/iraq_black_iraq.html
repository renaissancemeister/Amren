						<p>Abdul Hussein Abdul Razzaq laughs wearily when asked if racism is a problem in Iraq. As a black Iraqi, Razzaq says, he faces job and social discrimination and has little chance of getting a political appointment or being elected if he ran for public office.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why Razzaq, a longtime journalist from the southern city of Basra, is hoping that Barack Obama becomes the United States&rsquo; next president. Not only will it be better for Americans, he says, it will help  blacks the world over. {snip}</p>
<p>Racism isn&rsquo;t new in Iraq. Blacks were brought here as slaves from Africa more than 1,000 years ago to work for wealthy landowners in Basra, where most of Iraq&rsquo;s black population still lives. Today, one of the insults sometimes hurled at black people is &#8220;Abd,&#8221; which means servant or slave in Arabic, said Razzaq, who has founded a political organization called the Free Iraqis Movement to press for equal rights for black people.</p>
<p>Its goal includes amending Iraq&rsquo;s constitution to ban discrimination against blacks, who Razzaq says number about 2 million here, and getting blacks elected to the national parliament.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Another problem, according to Razzaq, is that many of Iraq&rsquo;s most powerful people still think of blacks as servants. Some tribal sheiks still keep blacks as slaves, he says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As he travels through the country, Razzaq carries with him the resumes and biographies of black Iraqis who he says have been denied jobs and high political appointments because of their race.</p>

			<p>If Obama wins, blacks around the world will become even more unbearable than they are now. Then again, that could be the wake-up call that white countries need. I don&rsquo;t know, I just wish something would happen to make whites fight back against this multiculturalism insanity before it&rsquo;s too late.</p>

			<p>My father used to work in Oman (a pleasant contry on the south of the Arabian Peninsula) and blacks were treated with similar contempt there. Arabs are under no illusions about blacks and would be offended at the idea of considering them as equals. It just seems that the political upheavals of recent European history - coupled with humanist ideas derived from the rotten Palenstinian superstition of Christianity - have conditioned the Western mind to accept an obviously false view about the different peoples of the world, even to the point of wilful ignorance.</p>
<p>It annoys me that Third Worlders are openly welcoming white dispossession - in this case, an Obama presidency - in the hope of improving their lot. It is assumed that a black US president will automatically make their lives that little bit better. The idea of controlling their own destiny, and trying to actually achieve something that will make their lives better, dosen&rsquo;t seem to enter the consciousness of any blacks across the world. Better living standards aren&rsquo;t something to be earned - and therefore deserved - but are there to be handed out on plates.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Yemen, which borders Oman and Saudi Arabia, is the Brazil of the Arab world: by which I mean, miscegenated into misery. With by far the highest proportion of African blood in its national gene pool (35%), Yemen is unsuprisingly the only country in the Arab world to be officially classified as impoverished by the United Nations.</p>

<p>Denied jobs because of their race or their proven inabilities?</p>
<p>Some, mostly blacks, want people to believe that it is only because they are black that people don&rsquo;t want to hire them or elect them to office, but few people base their opinions of blacks on just skin color.  Many Indians are just as dark and they do well about every place the migrate to.</p>
<p>The whole world is on to what blacks are all about and they don&rsquo;t like them at all, especially American blacks.</p>

			<p>If America remains the lone superpower much longer, it will force its vassal states (such as Iraq)to have their own &#8220;civil rights laws&#8221; including set-asides and quotas for blacks.  If this insanity is America&rsquo;s gift to the world, perhaps it is just as well that America decline into oblivion.</p>

			<p>Found this interesting fact elsewhere:  &#8220;Even though Islam teaches that all people are equal before God, Abdullah said that medieval Arab slave owners made distinctions based on skin color. White slaves, known as mamluks, which means &#8220;owned,&#8221; were more expensive than black slaves, or abds.&#8221;</p>
<p>This corresponds roughly to what I learned from history books: the black slaves in the south of Iraq were used for truly miserable, backbreaking work, whereas white slaves became military and political leaders, often surpassing their Arab enslavers (the Ottomans did much the same thing later with the Janissaries).</p>
<p>Incidentally, these &#8220;Mamluk&#8221; slaves actually ended up taking control of Egypt and forming a dynasty which lasted almost 300 years there.  The worldwide pattern in which whites climb to the top of any society, and blacks drift to the bottom, seems clearly defined no matter what the time and where the place.  It&rsquo;s little wonder slavery in the Arab world is hardly taught about at all in American schools.</p>

			<p>There is some truth to the above, but keep in mind that Arabs are for sure part Black themselves. Your average Iraqi is easily 6% Black. Omanis themselves, who supposedly hate Blacks, are easily 13% Black themselves. And Yemen is 19% Black, not 35%. The Black in the Arab World is all on the mtDNA side (mothers side) not on the Y chromosome side (fathers). Arab men were having sex with Black slave women and Black slaves could not touch an Arab woman.</p>
<p>So the attitude towards Blacks in the Arab world is pretty complicated. Obviously, a lot of Arabs are somewhat Black, though most will ferociously deny it because in general, they *really* hate Black people. So it&rsquo;s ok to be a little Black, but at some point, your features are too Black, and now you go into the &#8220;Black&#8221; column. </p>
<p>Blacks in the Arab World don&rsquo;t act very bad. I&rsquo;m not aware of a lot of pathologies, and they seem to commit little crime. My opinion is that Islam is good for Blacks because it keeps their latent bad qualities in check. There&rsquo;s hardly any crime in Oman or Yemen. </p>
<p>Yemenis are into being White. I know some who run a store near me. They hate summer because it makes them too dark. I told them they were White just like me and they were giving me high fives all around. These guys are practically White Power dudes. Funny how so many ppl around the world actually want to be White.</p>

			<p> All this shows is how gullible human beings can be regardless of race or geography. <br>
 Mr. Razzaq only needs to examine how the Congressional Black Caucus behaves to realize his hopes have already been dashed. The political aristocracy, both Black and White, have little regard for their subjects except when elections are near. <br>
 A Black Marxist as president will, in no way, make life better for anyone except those in the American Politboro.</p>

			<p>It seems that blacks are always disadvantaged, no matter where you put them. Whether it is in the US,Canada,the UK or even Cuba, they are always at the bottom of the ladder. Who cares. They shoulf learn to help themselves and stop moaning. He is probably better off in Iraq than in some hellhole in east or west africa.</p>

			<p>Mr. Lindsay,</p>
<p>You  forgot  to  mention  that  the  predominant  Y(male) hapologroup  in  Arabized  North  Africa  is  the East  African  E3b, whose  deepest  clade is  in  Tanzania.  The same  principle  applies  to  the  blacks of  Upper  Egypt  who  firmly  reject being  classified as  Arab.</p>
<p>Sudan  considers  itself  part  of  the  Arab  world but its haplogroup  genetics  is  almost  100% African  on  both  Y and  MtDNA sides.</p>
<p>Your  point  about  blacks, crime  and  Islam is in error  since  there  are  non-Islamic  societies in Africa  where the  crime  rate  is  very  low.  Botswana, Namibia, Lesotho, Togo, etc. come  to  mind.</p>
<p>You should  also  recognize  that  blacks  have  lived  in North Africa  and  West  Asia  ever  since  the  dawn of  humanity and  there  are significant  populations  of  such  indigenous  to  that  area.</p>

			<p>Yeah I know, light skin is a real status symbol for the non-whites of the world, particularly in North Africa. I thought Yemenites had more African blood &hellip; are you sure only 19%? Oh well, all the better for them I guess.</p>
<p>Blacks may commit little crime there, but they were known amongst the Arabs who my dad used to work with for being lazy workers and untrustworthy. There was a black guy who worked for my dad called Zaram who was notoriously corrupt, and used to extortionate junior workers for illegal work permits! He was also the only Omani my father knew who celebrated the 9/11 terror attacks on the US.</p>

			<p>You can look it up on my blog. It&rsquo;s all pretty uncontroversial. It&rsquo;s in an article called <a href="https://robertlindsay.blogspot.com/2008/05/little-black-in-everyone.html" rel="nofollow">A Little Black in All of US</a>. If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, in the Levant, Mesopotamia and the Gulf, it&rsquo;s all on the mother&rsquo;s side and little to none on the father&rsquo;s side. That means that Arab men were having sex with their Black female slaves and there was little to no Black slaves having sex with Arab women. </p>
<p>There is a figure that is something like 35% in Yemen, but that is for mother&rsquo;s side only. They&rsquo;re 35% Black on the mother&rsquo;s side. On the father&rsquo;s side, only like 3% Black. Add em up, divide by two, and you get 19%.</p>
<p><i>How long do you think they would survive if they raped Arabic women at the same rate that they rape white women in the West? </i> </p>
<p>Hey, whatever works. If Islam or socialism works for Blacks, cool. We can&rsquo;t exactly implement them here, but it means that Blacks aren&rsquo;t doomed to be sociopathic and chaotic animals everywhere. I&rsquo;m not into hopelessness.</p>

			<p>Sorry, it&rsquo;s 4.5% Black genes in Iraqis and Black genes 16% in Omanis. Arabs are really sensitive about that though, so don&rsquo;t bring it up. They fly into wild rages and angry denial. A lot of them just flat out refuse to accept that they have Black blood in them. WRT the Omani you know, he&rsquo;s probably part-Black himself, but in those places most people are. The &#8220;Blacks&#8221; he&rsquo;s referring to is just a lot more Black than he is, that&rsquo;s all. At low levels, you can&rsquo;t see Black phenotype too much, and a lot of such folks just look kind of like swarthy, dark Whites.</p>
<p>I figure if you look White and you act White, you&rsquo;re White. Welcome to the club. What the heck, we&rsquo;re disappearing anyway, maybe we should expand membership rules. The Nazi Low Riders White Power prison gang just announced that they are accepting Hispanics who are over 50% White. They&rsquo;re way outnumbered in prison and need all the help they can get.</p>

<p>Something&rsquo;s going on here!  Something social science doesn&rsquo;t want to acknowledge.  Worldwide, there&rsquo;s just too much consistency in these attitudes.  They seem to be universal.</p>

			<p>The average iraqi is not mixed. The admixture hapenned in the South, between the Chiites. There is no trace of admixture in the Kurds and few on Sunnis. In Lebanon, Siria, Jordania, etc..; the &#8220;Black contribution&#8221; is lesser than in USA or England&hellip;There´s no such thing like &#8220;White&#8221; slave; Arabs  are not a Race, and don´t think in Europeans (for instance)like a diferent race. They called to slave Christians(Armenians,  Greeks, Jeorgians, etç..) Rum -  meaning Roman. And Caucasians don´t have a specific kind of &#8220;white&#8221; skin. The average Sweden is ligther than the average German, that by ther turn, are lighter than the average Italian, etç..East Mediterranics are generally darker by natural selection, not admixture. </p>

<p>So who&rsquo;s an &#8220;Iraqi&#8221; anyway?  Just what is an Iraqi?   It&rsquo;s like asking what race is an American. Iraq is composed of various peoples. And racial types.</p>
<p>(Of course, once-apon-a-time we knew exactly what was meant by an &#8220;American&#8221;, but that was before the drastic changes effected in the 1960s made everyone and everything into an American. Before this became a Proposition Nation.  And when everyone&rsquo;s an American, no one&rsquo;s an American.)</p>

			<p>Sure, Iraqi *Jews* don&rsquo;t have any Black in em. The rest of the Iraqis do. I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s more in the Shia, but I think there&rsquo;s a lot in the Sunni too. It&rsquo;s not true that the Kurds have no Black - they are 2% Black. Jordanians are 6.5% Black and Syrians are 5% Black. I don&rsquo;t have any figures for Lebanon. That&rsquo;s all on average. At those kind of low levels, you don&rsquo;t see any Black phenotype. Those levels are of 4.5-6.5% Black are similar to various populations in Portugal, Sicily and Greece. It doesn&rsquo;t effect phenotype in them either. There&rsquo;s a little Black in a lot of us Whites. </p>
<p>Geez, it&rsquo;s not the end of the world you know. You guys act like Superman and Kryptonite at the notion that you might have the tiniest drop of Black you.</p>

<p>The only Whites that I know that don&rsquo;t have any Black blood are those those Mizrachi and Mountain Jews and those Whites from the Caucasus above. All other White groups have some Black in them. Horrors! I&rsquo;m not sure if Sephardic refers to Mizrachi or actual Sephardics from Iberia. I suspect Mizrachis from the Arab World.</p>
