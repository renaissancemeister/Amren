						<p>The Democratic Party has historically attracted women and minority voters, and this year&rsquo;s national platform reiterates the party&rsquo;s support of affirmative action programs.</p>
<p>So why do so many Colorado Democrats support Amendment 46, the measure on the November ballot that would end state-sponsored affirmative action programs?</p>
<p>Three recent polls show that support for the measure &mdash; which would ban race and gender preferences in state hiring, contracting and education &mdash; is higher among Democrats than Republicans.</p>
<p>Critics of the measure and political observers say the polls likely reflect voter confusion over what the measure would really do. They say some Democratic voters think the measure is aimed at eliminating discrimination against women and minorities rather than ending affirmative action programs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The most recent poll, released Aug. 13 by Rasmussen Reports, showed that likely Colorado voters supported the measure 55 percent in favor to 23 percent against. But the poll showed that 71 percent of Democrats supported the measure while only 34 percent of Republicans supported it.</p>
<p>Two earlier Quinnipiac University polls also showed higher support for the measure among Hispanics than whites, and one poll showed more women supporting the amendment than men.</p>
<p>Bob Loevy, a political scientist at Colorado College, said the wording of the poll questions, which was similar to the wording of the amendment itself, is instructive.</p>
<p>The Quinnipiac poll includes language from the ballot measure that says &#8220;the state shall not discriminate against or grant preferential treatment to any group or individual on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin&#8221; in hiring, contracting or education. The Rasmussen poll used similar language.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the surface, this amendment sounds like something most Democrats would want to vote for; it gets rid of what sounds like racial favoritism,&#8221; Loevy said. &#8220;It takes a while to explain to people that there are certain implications to this &mdash; doing away with certain affirmative action programs.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jessica Peck Corry, a spokeswoman for the Colorado Civil Rights Initiative, the campaign in support of the initiative, said she didn&rsquo;t think there was any confusion about the ballot measure. She said the high support among Democratic voters reflected &#8220;a huge divide between the Democrat elites&#8221; and the party&rsquo;s rank and file.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the average Democrat voter, he or she is concerned about their kids getting into college,&#8221; Corry said. &#8220;They don&rsquo;t have time for lofty political debates that many elite Democrats can afford to have. The liberal elites already have their (college and employment) connections, whereas ordinary blue-collar voters don&rsquo;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Amendment 46 opponents filed a lawsuit in April challenging whether some petition circulators who gathered signatures for the ballot measure met legal requirements.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Mike Coffman&rsquo;s office is re-examining the signatures for the initiative after a preliminary sample count of signatures could not determine if there were enough to place the measure on the ballot.</p>
<p>But opponents&rsquo; main strategy may lie in a counter-initiative they are trying to get on the ballot. The proposal is worded similarly to Amendment 46, calling for ending discrimination based on race and sex, but contains a phrase that would allow for all current affirmative action programs to remain in place.</p>
<p>Essentially, the proposal would do the exact opposite of Amendment 46 &mdash; preserving affirmative action in the Colorado Constitution.</p>

			<p>Opponents argue that the language of Prop 46 is confusing despite the language is very similar to the Civil Rights Act enacted years ago.  The opponents then offer a contradictory and confusing measure that should be shot down by the state.</p>
<p>Despite shoddy tricks, Prop. 46 will pass.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone is confused about what this ballot measure would do.  My now, the media has let everyone know.</p>
<p>Ironically, the salesmanship of this measure as &#8220;civil rights&#8221; is the reason it didn&rsquo;t make the ballot here in Missouri.  Many white people, thinking it was about more civil rights for blacks, didn&rsquo;t sign it.</p>

			<p>This whole thing is so confusing. I think it&rsquo;s because liberals must have their cake and eat it too. The more it&rsquo;s fashionable to ignore whites, or outright discriminate against them, the more we are told it is whites who are evil and who are discriminating. This anti-American and anti-white propaganda is a separate beast from affirmative action itself. It&rsquo;s just more convenience for some when they go together. </p>

			<p>I find it very hard to believe that republicans don&rsquo;t support this bill.  As far a democrat support, it just shows that there are still many Whites who are members of a party that they simply do not realize left them behind years ago.</p>

			<p>Yeah right. It&rsquo;s must of been a problem with the wording. There is no way ordinary white people, let alone ordinary LIBERAL white people, would ever act in their own self-interest. Only white elites can do that. The Kennedy&rsquo;s, the Bush&rsquo;s, the Blue Bloods&hellip;they are all allowed to pursue their own narrow and selfish interests, but ordinary white people&hellip;no, no, no,&hellip;they have to go to the back of the line. They are only allowed to pursue their interests if they don&rsquo;t clash with the interests of the Blue Bloods. </p>

			<p>Racial preferences are a good thing. Society has the right to, and should choose racial traits that are superior. The choosing should be wise and thoughtful. There is a need for ditch diggers and &ldquo;rocket scientists&rdquo; and every thing in-between. What we really don&rsquo;t need is 50 or a 100 ditch diggers competing for 2 or 3 ditch digger jobs. </p>
<p>It is time for pro-creation (having sex and kids) to come into the reality of science and the question of race and racial fitness and quality.</p>

			<p>Political scientist Bob Loevy needs to get his head out of the sand. The results mean what they mean - a majority of Democrats in Colorado don&rsquo;t want affirmative action or any other nonsense along that line. </p>
<p>Most likely, these are the very folks who have seen their chances for being hired or promoted on merit vanish with every non-white added to the labor pool.</p>
<p>As for the pro-AA activist efforts to employ a similarly-worded ballot question with an opposite objective; this sort of conduct demonstrate what desperate and corrupt measures these sleazeballs will utilize to &#8220;win&#8221; at any cost. It isn&rsquo;t surprising behavior, but it sure is shameful.</p>

			<p>Racial preferences are a typical marxist ploy to take from the achievers and give to the parasites. What society can survive when the wagon pullers are burdened with brakes on the wagon? Keep on working millions on welfare depend on you. Who are the slaves now?</p>

			<p>&#8220;The Quinnipiac poll includes language from the ballot measure that says &#8216;the state shall not discriminate against or grant preferential treatment to any group or individual on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin&rsquo; in hiring, contracting or education. The Rasmussen poll used similar language.</p>
<p>&#8216;On the surface, this amendment sounds like something most Democrats would want to vote for; it gets rid of what sounds like racial favoritism,&rsquo; Loevy said. &#8216;It takes a while to explain to people that there are certain implications to this &mdash; doing away with certain affirmative action programs.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>It never ceases to amaze me that people like this fool Loevy, always feel that most voters are so stupid that they cannot figure out that an anti-affirmative action proposal is exactly that, an anti-affirmative action proposal. No, it always has to be that some dark and mysterious force has crafted an initiative or amendment that simply has &#8220;mystified&#8221; the &#8220;lumpenproletariat&#8221; yet again. Never mind that much Republican electoral success has been crafted over the last 25 years in denouncing this vile anti-white reverse apartheid, or that every such a measure is put on a ballot it passes with an overwhelming majority; nope, it just has to be the outright ignorance of the people that allows for such catastrophic miscarriages of &#8220;justice&#8221; and &#8220;equality.&#8221; </p>
<p>In particular, the &#8220;ignorance&#8221; of most white people; this is of course when the &#8220;anointed&#8221; media and political &#8220;elites&#8221; are being kind enough (as they are in this article) to not accuse us of &#8220;racism&#8221; in tandem with &#8220;ignorance.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, things are not always so simplistic as these self-absorbed and sanctimonious Red idiots would have us believe; most white voters do live in a real world, not in ivory towers and gilded compounds. This is why CCRI spokeswoman Jessica Peck Corry, really does hit a homerun on the topic when she notes above that: &#8220;the high support among Democratic voters reflected &#8216;a huge divide between the Democrat elites&rsquo; and the party&rsquo;s rank and file,&#8221; who &hellip;&#8220;&#8216;don&rsquo;t have time for lofty political debates that many elite Democrats can afford to have.&rsquo;&#8221; </p>
<p>Those very succinct and insightful observations by Mrs. Corry, simply makes a point that even &#8220;Republicans&#8221; tend to forget once in power: we are not isolated from or inoculated against the nonwhite plagues of affirmative action and &#8220;immigration,&#8221; we live with and in them. That is why we wish to do away with them!</p>
<p>Perhaps, if things change enough, that situation can be reversed?</p>
<p>What more to say, other then, God let it be so!</p>

			<p>From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Critics of the measure and political observers say the polls likely reflect voter confusion over what the measure would really do&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why do the critics always assume that the voters are too stupid to figure out or understand what ending AA actually means?</p>
<p>We heard the exact same thing here in California about Prop 209 which was written clearly so as to avoid any confusion about what it would do.  The California ballot stated:</p>
<p> &#8220;&hellip;The state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet we heard leftist after leftist, seemingly with unlimited MSM time screaming and avering that voters were being tricked and deceived by confusing language and that we had no idea what we were voting for. </p>
<p>It was insulting to say the least (although I do strongly suspect many in California cannot read a ballot in ANY of the zillion languages in which it is written, another reason literacy tests should be brought back).</p>
<p>Could it possibly be that working-class Democrats have been the most affected by AA policies?  That they and their children have been the direct &#8216;beneficiaries&rsquo; of racist, anti-White edicts that shut them out of jobs, promotions, scholarships, college placements? That their complaints are deemed hate-speech and they are called racists and Nazis for opposing such unfairness?</p>
<p>Nah, couldn&rsquo;t be that&hellip;</p>

			<p>My father a long, long time ago saw all this coming.</p>
<p>He commented on a survey taking of very earnest Smith College Students (mom&rsquo;s college) that asked these two questions:</p>
<p>1) Should Smith College ban all racial and sexual discrimination in job hiring at Smith?</p>
<p>Overwhelming majorities of students voted for &#8220;yes&#8221;.</p>
<p>2) Should the next President of Smith College be a woman?</p>
<p>Overwhelming majorities of students also voted for &#8220;yes&#8221;.</p>
<p>My father looked at the results and said this showed that Smith College students were &#8220;enthusiastic&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same with elites and non Whites, sexual degenerates in Colorado and most everywhere. They are strongly, strongly against any for of racial or sexually discrimination in jobs, housing, college scholarships&hellip; and they went to give lots of preferences to various racial, ethnic, sexual groups in jobs, housing, college scholarships etc.</p>
<p>These people see no contradictions in these two viewpoints - straight out of Orwell&rsquo;s 1984.</p>

			<p>The Democratic leadership just doesn&rsquo;t want to admit that they&rsquo;re anti-white racists.  And yes, that includes the white ones, since they&rsquo;re so very sure that they&rsquo;re in an exalted position where none of that discrimination will apply against them.</p>
<p>What I don&rsquo;t understand is why so few of the Republicans polled are against ending anti-white discrimination.  Maybe they just lack reading comprehension, which could explain why they give us candidates like G. W. Bush and McCain.</p>
<p><i>But opponents&rsquo; main strategy may lie in a counter-initiative they are trying to get on the ballot. The proposal is worded similarly to Amendment 46, calling for ending discrimination based on race and sex, but contains a phrase that would allow for all current affirmative action programs to remain in place.</i></p>
<p>In other words they&rsquo;re going to have a self contradictory ballot proposal.<br>

			<p>I recently purchased, and have been reading, &#8220;The Affirmative Action Hoax&#8221; by Steven Farron (https://www.amazon.com/Affirmative-Action-Hoax-Diversity-Importance/dp/1931643628/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s;=books&qid;=1219840826&sr;=8-1).  It is an excellent expose&rsquo; on the greatest scandal of our generation written from a race-realist perspective.  I highly recommend both buying it (to support the author and so you can keep it as reference) and reading it cover to cover.  I&rsquo;m wondering why Amren does not list it in its book store.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m sure many of you may not like to admit it, but there is some sound logic behind affirmative action. While most think the fairest system is one based on merit, a meritocracy will always favor the highly intelligent and skilled over everyone else. So for a black man with and IQ of 85, there is little prospect of achieving anything worthwhile in life besides maybe working in a factory, warehouse or at a fast food restaurant. Add to that the blacks&rsquo; inability for long term planning and general lack of motivation caused by their sub-Saharan ancestry and you have a recipe for crime, drug abuse and high birth rates. So what is an advanced civilization to do?</p>
<p>Would it be better to let them fester in squalor in shanty towns, as they would still be living if not for affirmative action? Or should society help artificially uplift the blacks into positions of power and responsibility so that they can achieve some level of financial success? As long as white people are forced to live amongst black people, they will have to make these tough decisions. For some, it is cut and dry - a merit based system is best. But that will inevitably lead to more destitute blacks and higher crime rates. It&rsquo;s a difficult balancing act and not as simple as some of you would like to imagine it is. </p>

<p>  I think a black may be qualified to be a community college professor, but not the Dean of Arts and Sciences at Harvard.  Affirmative Action (really quotas) distorts this natural employment progression. It downgrades the efficiency of our institutions by promoting people who are clearly unqualified. In addition, it also degrades the hard work of minorities who are intellectually qualified for these positions. I really don&rsquo;t think that blacks will go on a crime rampage without it. Black communities were poorer, yet at the same time, stronger and more cohesive before the great government sweepstakes of Affirmative Action. </p>

			<p>WE can thank the fuzzy feel good thinking of former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O&rsquo;Connor for the fact that &ldquo;Affirmative Action&rdquo; (i.e., anti-white discrimination) still plagues the land pretty much in full force. She blew the one great chance to end this nonsense, instead she was the deciding vote in Grutter v. Bollinger maintaining this injustice. Her face should be on dartboards everywhere. Sure, there where qualifications given on the use of AA but of course they get ignored or circumvented. </p>
<p>&#8220;We expect that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today&#8221;, She said.<br>
 <br>
Right! What a naïve liberal head. She actually thought Blacks 25 years hence might not still be the problematic underclass they always have been. There will be probably an even wider academic gap 25 years from now, and AA will be, of course, deemed as necessary as ever. I suspect a hundred years from now African Americans will still be calling their failiures the &ldquo;legacy of slavery&rdquo;.  </p>
<p>These referendums are our only hope. <br>

			<p>The passing of prop 46 will have just as much influence as the US Congress authorizing  border fencing. Our unelected masters don&rsquo;t give a hoot what White America wants.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m sure many of you may not like to admit it, but there is some sound logic behind affirmative action.&rsquo;  Wrong.The poster must be watching too much msm and is just as confused as the Marxist confusers. &#8220;So why do so many Colorado Democrats support Amendment 46, the measure on the November ballot that would end state-sponsored affirmative action programs?&#8221; Answer: Controlled opposition.A shell game.Besides a small number of honest politicians,they are all corrupt in both parties.And those few that aren&rsquo;t certainly do not have a voice or get media coverage.And the bulk of citizens in this nation that still value freedom do not pay heed to polls,media editorials,or political rhetoric.But they know there is nothing to be done at this late stage except waiting for the coming collapse of the economy and government,and then take action.There&rsquo;s no way to work within the system because our leaders are traitors.</p>

			<p>These proposals are useless.The hellish AA has been extended for anotther generation on the national level already.Further,it is so entrenced in society that removal would have no effect whatsoever.Minorities would continue to file specious lawsuits against anyone or any entity.Employers will continue to their AA hiring practices.The politicians will continue to denigrate whites.And the controlled mainstream media will continue to indoctrinate the sheeple into globalist views and compliance as human resources. &#8220;For some, it is cut and dry - a merit based system is best. But that will inevitably lead to more destitute blacks and higher crime rates. It&rsquo;s a difficult balancing act and not as simple as some of you would like to imagine it is.&#8221; That poster is mind-controlled.The black crime rates have exploded in the past 40 years.Giving people a false sense of worth is not the answer.And accepting differences in behavior,IQ,and other areas does not mean superiority of one race over another.It is the proponents of AA and diversity that are the true racists.Lastly,there is nothing wrong with blue collar work.If one cannot qualify for skilled or professional vocations they do not benefit soviety by being given them by virtue of race or minority status. <br>

			<p>let all of the aa blacks have all of the elite jobs.  then some day when the time is right, all the white boys working the normal daily jobs that hold our whole systems together ( water, sewers,hospitals,electric, gas, roads etc) can just wqlk off the job and say shove it. then the whole infrastructure will come tumling down.</p>

<p>I will never agree with a system that blatantly discriminates against Whites.  I will never support a system that allows those who are unqualified to be given preferences over those who have worked hard and sacrificed only to be told &#8216;no Whites need apply.&rsquo;  </p>
<p>AA is inherently unfair and evil. </p>
<p><br>
&#8220;&hellip;While most think the fairest system is one based on merit, a meritocracy will always favor the highly intelligent and skilled over everyone else&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>So what. Preferences are discrimination against Whites  &mdash;  and since it&rsquo;s against Whites, the government doesn&rsquo;t care and in fact supports it. Real people, real lives are destroyed by AA as qualified Whites are denied jobs, promotions, scholarships over those less or un-qualified.</p>
<p>What would you tell this real person? (one of millions):</p>
<p> I applied for dozens of professorships but could not get a job. &hellip;the department chair&hellip;.asked me to stay behind&hellip;. he said, &#8216;I&rsquo;ll deny saying it, but I want to save you the wondering. You are, by far, the best candidate for the job, but you don&rsquo;t stand a ghost of chance of getting it. The dean has informed us that the next seven hires will be women or minorities.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p> <a href="/ar/2005/07/index.html" rel="nofollow">/ar/2005/07/index.html</a></p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;So what is an advanced civilization to do?&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Stop the high birthrates and expansion of ANY parasitic, violent underclass.</p>
<p>As Jared Taylor points out:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Yes I wrote about Norplant in 1992&hellip;for those on welfare, on the assumption that anyone who is feeding at the public trough, who depends on your tax money simply to stay alive, does not have the right to bring yet more children into the world for you to house, to feed, to clothe, to try to educate. No that should not be your duty. If you were dependent on society for your groceries, for the roof over your head&hellip; For as long as you are dependent on society&rsquo;s handouts you should not have the right to have three or four more children&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="/features/gutierrez/transcript.html" rel="nofollow">/features/gutierrez/transcript.htm</a></p>
<p>So, as a White, I am not only denied promotions, jobs and scholarships, I am forced to pay for a seething White-hating, expanding underclass as well.</p>
<p>Tell me how that is fair.</p>

			<p>Why don&rsquo;t we hire governors who are blind?  Why not hire surgeons who are blind, accountants blind and eye doctors who cannot see?  Why have any standards at all, we could have utopia without competition here in obama&rsquo;s paradise.</p>
