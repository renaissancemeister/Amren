						<p>AFL-CIO Political Director Karen Ackerman says she believes racism is playing a role in limiting Barack Obama &lsquo;s appeal to some union members, but she said union leaders were making a concerted effort to overcome prejudice among their members.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ackerman said the AFL-CIO has launched a $53.4 million grass-roots campaign to convince union members to come out for Obama, including mailing 1 million pieces of direct mail this week touting Obama to union members in four states expected to be battlegrounds: Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Ackerman acknowledged Obama&rsquo;s struggles during the primary campaign to win over white workers without college degrees and said it was the union&rsquo;s job to make the case for Obama.</p>
<p>&#8220;There has never been an African-American candidate for president and many folks around this country have never voted for an African-American candidate for any office,&#8221; she said. So Ackerman said union leadership is urging local union officials to reach out on a one-to-one basis to members resistant to voting for a black candidate. {snip}</p>
<p>But AFL-CIO officials said that white union members already are more supportive of Obama than working class whites who are not union members and that turning out union voters in key states could make the difference in the campaign. At the same time, Ackerman said that if the AFL-CIO fails to turn out union voters in just Ohio and Michigan, Obama would have a less than one percent chance of defeating presumptive Republican nominee Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.</p>

			<p>Obama isn&rsquo;t getting the trade union vote of the White workers, but of course, he&rsquo;ll get the black vote. Most times, the White vote goes against the union leadership. I wonder how the union leadership has gotten so liberal? We didn&rsquo;t used to be this way.</p>

			<p>The AFL-CIO has room to talk.They have turned on the American people.Their support of illegal immigration has betrayed the union workers they are supposed to protect.Their support of affirmative action is against the very contracts they negotitate for working people.My contract under Article 2 of the national agreement states my employer can&rsquo;t discriminate against me based on race.Yet the unions support affirmative action which is discrimination against me as a white male.How can they reconcile this position?Now they want me to vote for B.O.!Unfortunately I have to vote for Mc Cain,God help us!</p>

			<p>I was a union member for 20 yrs (construction trade) and this may come as a surprise to Democrats and union officials but a huge number of white union members (especially in the construction trades) are conservatives who won&rsquo;t vote the way the union leadership thinks it should. Alot of them are veterans too as am I and yeah you can use the term &#8220;redneck&#8221; to describe a good number of them too.</p>

			<p>It should be noted that some of the Unions support illegal immigration even when it is clearly against the interests of American Workers both Unionized and Non-Union.  The bond of racial politics and the Democratic party is more important than the single mission Unions are charged with.  The same can be said for environmental groups.  They would rather advocate for partisan politics than for the environment which is why they will not touch immigration.  Why not just call them what they are; racists?  Or we can call them racists of color if you prefer.    </p>

			<p>Far too often these corrupt union officials misuse members&rsquo; money to advance their own personal agendas under the guise of advocating a candidate that will advance union interests.</p>
<p>Add these miscreants to the corruption in politics, the media, academia, and the corporate world, and the resulting total is a country that is beyond repair in its present form.</p>

			<p>  It used to be that unions were the greatest way to protect workers from the abuse of employers. Now, they protect only minorities. They couldn&rsquo;t care less about the whites in the unions. I was a union member at a steel mill for 33 years. The only people the union was concerned about was minorities. Whites took a back seat to all minorities. Anybody says different is lying, I was there. Way too many unions sell out to companies or they go the opposite route and do their best to bankrupt the companies. Deadbeats should be fired regardless. I doesn&rsquo;t happen that way. The unions have been infiltrated by marxists and out-right communists. Remember communism?  Trust me, it isn&rsquo;t dead. </p>

			<p>I was a Union officer for over 25 years and it sickens me to see the dues-paying members hard earned money spent on brainwashing them.  It&rsquo;s a shame that we need unions, but we do.  Were I not retiring next week, I would be quiting my Union over it&rsquo;s endorsement of Obama.  My Union especially owes the Clintons, but my Union is run by a Black and it doesn&rsquo;t surprise me he threw Obama our Union&rsquo;s support.  The only positive thing is, a lot of liberal White union activists are getting a lesson about the realities of race. Race trumps craft, at least among Blacks.</p>

			<p>The numbers from recent elections show that white union members don&rsquo;t vote that much differently from whites who don&rsquo;t belong to a union.  Ditto for blacks and Hispanics.  It&rsquo;s not unions, but race.</p>

<p><br>
Well I don&rsquo;t see why. After all, Obama sure doesn&rsquo;t consider it HIS job to make the case for unionized or working-class whites.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s already made it plain he despises us. We bitterly cling to our guns and our religion, and we don&rsquo;t eat enough arugula from Whole Foods.<br>

			<p>The former Deputy Attorney General of Pennsylvania filed a federal lawsuit last week against Obama and the DNC to remove Obama as Constitutionally ineligible for POTUS:</p>
<p>https://www.obamacrimes.com/index.php/component/content/article/1-main/1-philip-j-berg-esq-files-federal-lawsuit-requesting-obama-be-removed-as-a-candidate-as-he-does-not-meet-the-qualifications-for-president</p>
<p>Obama is knowingly attempting to defraud the entire country, because as a &#8220;Constitutional law scholar/lecturer&#8221; he knows full well that his dubious citizenship and divided national loyalties disqualify him.  </p>
<p>GOP operatives travelled to Mombasa, Kenya, last Feb. and found a birth certificate for Barack Hussein Obama dated Aug. 4th, 1961, and several of Obama&rsquo;s Kenyan relatives insist that he was born there.</p>
<p>Even if it is &#8220;proved&#8221; that Obama was born in Honolulu, the conflicts involved with his later Indonesian adoption/exclusive citizenship, and failure to produce documentation of re-establishment of U.S. citizenship (along with his use of an Indonesian passport to travel to Pakistan in 1981  &mdash;  not to mention the divided loyalties among Kenya, Indonesia, America, et. al.) all will combine to force the courts and the MSM to blow the question/case wide open for scrutiny.</p>
<p>Get out the popcorn, we&rsquo;re in for a wild ride over the next couple of months.</p>

<p>When a black person kills a white, and the white family members have to tell the media that they aren&rsquo;t racists, any recalcitrance showing from the whites is usually labed racism. Actually, no matter what they answer will never quite clear their name.  </p>

			<p>White Union worker support were the key to the Nixon, Reagan landslides. Pat Buchanan tapped into this group&rsquo;s culture and concerns and he did great.</p>
<p>In contrast the various 2008 GOP Presidential candidates fooled around and didn&rsquo;t even bother to acknowledge this hugely important White group. You folks that went down the rat hole of libertarianism where businesses, corporations can hire and fire at their whim, seek the lowest cost labor and a basic competitive business strategy, you missed the boat, and your candidate got destroyed.</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with Whites working in blue colar, union jobs - in fact, these are the folks we need to win anything.</p>
<p>Get off the golf course, get out of the LIbertarian pro management, anything goes Capitalism sand box. Reconnect with some White union workers.</p>

			<p>Although Unions are beneficial to it&rsquo;s members. There can be no denying they are the labor wing of the mafia. As it has become more corrupt than even the government. I have a friend who was running for leader, he was terrified for his life, and was packing a gun at all times, fortunately I beleive for him, he was defeated, because he was against the present leadership of his local. For the most part unions are used to force companies to retain lazy unproductive workers. Ps I doubt the legimaticy of the poll figures.  Most members would be terrified to tell the truth of their voting intentions, if it conflicted with what was was expected of them.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m sure that the fact that the union officials are spending $43.4 million of the member&rsquo;s union dues in a failed attempt to brainwash members into voting for an unqualified black for president will go over real well among the white membership&hellip;</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s clear what the union bosses should do.  They should encourage the employer of any union member who will not pledge to vote for Obama to fire that employee.  After all, the union doesn&rsquo;t exist to serve its rank-and-file members  It exists to serve its political masters in the Democratic party.  That would at least show the workers what their union representatives think of them.</p>

			<p> Some of the unions endorsed Bill Clinton and he signed the free trade bill which just about destroyed the auto cos. They are all in trouble. Union dues are like a giant theft for white males, you pay and pay and get no representation. About like paying taxes to this gubmint. Workers really have nobody to represent them in my opinion. Lou Dobbs always talks about the destruction of the middle class. I agree with the comments on this subject. Will somebody please come up with a solution.</p>

			<p>Calling anyone VOTING AGAAINST OBAMA A RACIST is a shrewd tactic. Wholly wrong, which anyone with even half a brain can see, but still a good gambit.</p>
<p>The problem is that so mamy people can count to 20 without taking their socks off, and even more can actually read and UNDERSTAND what they read. Which is why the Obama Myth is not selling all that well. Obama makes a lot of effort now, about &#8220;saving American jobs.&#8221; Yet when he HAD that opportunity, serving as senator, he made not the slightest effort in that direction. No, I doubt EVERY union member slurps his beer and can&rsquo;t think of anything more complex than how to pop the top of the can. A lot of union guys DO read, DO think, and are immune to this kind of brainwashing effort. Just as a lof of union members are only too painfully aware that illegal immigration is having a very negative impact on unions and on American jobs as well.</p>

			<p>  The nightly news headlines started out with &#8220;bad behavior on the assembly line&#8221;. What were they talking about but a mitsubishi assembly plant. The people were talking about how they were harassed on the job. They talked about how the people who they were supposed to report it to were harassing them too and how any complaints to the union were ignored. You could probably look it up on the net still. When i first went into a auto plant the first thing i was told was &#8220;this place is corrupt and it will corrupt you too&#8221;. It probably did some. What happened with the mitsubishi plant is people and groups of people called for a boycott. So you had bad behavior + bad publicity = boycott. We could google unions and corruption and see if anything comes up. All i know is we are losing auto jobs to free trade,robots, some self destruction on auto workers part. In my opinion. They said at one time 1 in six jobs in this country were related to autos. Wonder what it is now? In a way unions have lost the right to any expectation to any loyalty to their endorsements in my opinion. Just wait and watch the political process take its course now. </p>
