<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>What with the Bush legacy of reckless war and economic mismanagement, 2008 is a year that favors the generic Democratic candidate over the generic Republican one. Yet Barack Obama, with every natural and structural advantage in the presidential race, is running only neck-and-neck against John McCain, a sub-par Republican nominee with a list of liabilities longer than a Joe Biden monologue. Obama has built a crack political operation, raised record sums, and inspired millions with his eloquence and vision. McCain has struggled with a fractious campaign team, lacks clarity and discipline, and remains a stranger to charisma. Yet at the moment, the two of them appear to be tied. What gives?</p>
<p>{snip} If you break the numbers down, the reason Obama isn&rsquo;t ahead right now is that he trails badly among one group, older white voters. He does so for a simple reason: the color of his skin.</p>
<p>Much evidence points to racial prejudice as a factor that could be large enough to cost Obama the election. That warning is written all over last month&rsquo;s CBS/New York Times poll, which is worth examining in detail if you want a quick grasp of white America&rsquo;s curious sense of racial grievance. In the poll, 26 percent of whites say they have been victims of discrimination. Twenty-seven percent say too much has been made of the problems facing black people. Twenty-four percent say the country isn&rsquo;t ready to elect a black president. Five percent of white voters acknowledge that they, personally, would not vote for a black candidate.</p>
<p>Five percent surely understates the reality. In the Pennsylvania primary, one in six white voters told exit pollsters race was a factor in his or her decision. Seventy-five percent of those people voted for Clinton. You can do the math: 12 percent of the Pennsylvania primary electorate acknowledged that it didn&rsquo;t vote for Barack Obama in part because he is African-American. And that&rsquo;s what Democrats in a Northeastern(ish) state admit openly. The responses in Ohio and even New Jersey were dispiritingly similar.</p>
<p>Such prejudice usually comes coded in distortions about Obama and his background. {snip} To some white voters (14 percent in the CBS/New York Times poll), Obama is someone who, as president, would favor blacks over whites. Or he is an &#8220;elitist&#8221; who cannot understand ordinary (read: white) people because he isn&rsquo;t one of them. Or he is charged with playing the race card, or of accusing his opponents of racism, when he has strenuously avoided doing anything of the sort. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The No. 1 best-seller in America, Obama Nation by Jerome R. Corsi, Ph.D., leeringly notes that Obama&rsquo;s white mother always preferred that her &#8220;mate&#8221; be &#8220;a man of color.&#8221; John McCain has yet to get around to denouncing this vile book.</p>
<p>Many have discoursed on what an Obama victory could mean for America. {snip} His defeat would say that when handed a perfect opportunity to put the worst part of our history behind us, we chose not to. In this event, the world&rsquo;s judgment will be severe and inescapable: The United States had its day but, in the end, couldn&rsquo;t put its own self-interest ahead of its crazy irrationality over race.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>You may or may not agree with Obama&rsquo;s policy prescriptions, but they are, by and large, serious attempts to deal with the biggest issues we face: a failing health care system, oil dependency, income stagnation, and climate change. To the rest of the world, a rejection of the promise he represents wouldn&rsquo;t just be an odd choice by the United States. It would be taken for what it would be: sign and symptom of a nation&rsquo;s historical decline.<br>

			<p>The reason obama might lose is&hellip;a lot of white people will  wake up in time&hellip;.and find out he&rsquo;s an empty suit with a phoney smile and no brains&hellip;.he wouldn&rsquo;t even make a good dog catcher!!! Racism has nothing to do with it!!<br>

			<p>I can&rsquo;t believe that journalists are pushing this garbage, its almost if they&rsquo;re working for McCain on the down low.  By stating that people don&rsquo;t support Obama out of racism they really risk turning people off to Obama even more.</p>
<p>If you look at all the mistakes Obama has made I think he is by far and away his own worse enemy.  His lackluster performance at Saddleback Church, the fact his VP can&rsquo;t even say his name properly is pretty damning in and of itself.</p>
<p>Obama really needs to work on himself first and foremost.</p>

			<p>Now if John McCain would enthusiastically endorse &#8220;Obamanation&#8221; he would invigorate his core base.  And just why is Jerome Corsi&rsquo;s book &#8220;vile&#8221;?  Because it dares to tell the truth, warts and all? <br>

			<p>When White voters say, &#8220;I will not vote for a Black candidate,&#8221; it&rsquo;s &#8220;racism.&#8221; When over 90 percent of Black voters vote for the Black candidate, its commendable.</p>
<p>I deeply regret that the U.S. government failed to complete the Liberia plan, as it promised, after the civil war.  </p>

			<p>What does Mr. Weisberg think of the fact that the first potential black president is NOT a descendant of North American slaves? He&rsquo;s no more relavent to the history of race and slavery in the U.S. than the offspring of any other third world immigrant in the U.S.? It&rsquo;s like the media trying to pass a Bulagarian off as relevant to the lineage of the English Founding Fathers. His black skin is the only noteworthing thing about Obama. </p>
<p>And his &#8216;eloquence and vision.&rsquo; Don&rsquo;t make me laugh! The media is like elementary school parents gushing after their children mangle &#8216;Annie&rsquo; at the school musical just to make them feel good.</p>

			<p>Is this guy for real? I dont believe he could have come up with a more politically correct piece of tripe if he had a stable of writers working on it for weeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;The United States had its day but, in the end, couldn&rsquo;t put its own self-interest ahead of its crazy irrationality over race.&#8221;</p>
<p>First I&rsquo;d ask why black America isnt putting its &#8220;own self interest ahead of its crazy irrationality over race&#8221;, by voting for John Mccain. But since this airhead no doubt believes blacks cannot be racists, it is a moot point. But the other way around? Whites not voting for obama? Can only be racism. Right Mr Weisberg. Millions of whites will be voting for obama this November. But since not enough whites will be voting for obama, then Weisberg must paint the entire white population with the racist brush. </p>
<p>By the way Mr Weisberg, can we assume you will be voting for obama? If so, why are you not voting for McCain? Are you racist against white candidates? That must be the case. You apparently think only in terms of race. Why else accuse white America of being racist for not voting for a black candidate? Or are you allowed an excuse other than racism for not supporting McCain. An excuse that you allow for yourself and black voters, but not white voters. </p>

			<p>Obama trails behind the older white voters because this group is immune to political correctness.  They see Obama for what he is rather than what Obama&rsquo;s handlers wants them to see.  This claim that not voting for Obama makes you a racist falls on deaf ears.  An American born Pakistan madras educated Saudi-American radical Muslim running for president could make the same insane accusation.  </p>
<p>Electing a black as president would only remind whites that our ancestors should have shipped all the slaves back to Africa when they were freed.</p>
<p>The word racism was invented in 1933.  It is a creation of the communist intelligensia.  These wretches would have you believe that being a racist is the most evil thng a person can be.  I have news for them; the most evil thing a person can be is a communist&hellip;          </p>

			<p>Older white voters have had the experience of seeing what Detroit became after Black leaders came to the helm. Washington DC, Newark NJ, Camden NJ, Atlanta all have followed suit in their downhill descent into mismanagement and white hostility.<br>
Unfortunately the liberals can&rsquo;t brain wash older white voters like they do with college students and Peace Corp volunteers.</p>

			<p>No matter what reason spurs normal people to vote against this marxist, the whole country will be called racist if he loses. The day after the election the media will all be glum and gloomy. The articles, the letters to the editor, the speeches, the talking heads discussions will all be over one thing: how racist this country is. Jesse Jackson and the other race-hucksters will give their opinions and it will be that the country is totally racist.</p>
<p>I would vote for Condi Rice or Colin Powell. I would not vote for a marxist no matter what his skin shade is.<br>

			<p>tough luck for Obama. He will lose because for at least one more election, most voters will be conservatives, independent whites who care about American values and blue collar workers who understand that McCain for all his money relates better to rodinary people than this Harvard-U of Chicago intellectual and his Communist supporters.</p>
<p>Obama could have become a conservative Republican like a JC Watts and a role model for individuals of any color who work hard and rise because of individual talent. He wants however to ride the surf of affirmative action: elect me because I&rsquo;m &#8220;black&#8221; even though I&rsquo;ve only several years of legislative experience,no executive experience,no military experience and no business experience.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Obama isnt ahead right now is that he trails badly among one group, older white voters. He does so for a simple reason: the color of his skin&#8221;</p>
<p>Either that or the still White majority has figured out this nobody for the leftist-socialist he is. A less than one term Senator elected in a very liberal state who&rsquo;s only documentable accomplishment is that of a &#8216;community organiser&rsquo; - newspeak  for leftist radicle. I doubt there has ever been a less credentialed canidate in the history of the country. Only an incompetent GOP could lose this election. <br>

			<p>It might be a good idea for all freedom loving Americans to pray to their God that this creature is not elected to destroy all that our country stands for. His background is filled with evil and the words that come out of his wifes mouth are an insult to all that is decent and good. He is about as qualified to run our country as Mickey Mouse. He is unqualified period. When he reads from a script he is a good actor BUT when he speaks without one he stutters and fumbles like a grade school fool He never answers one question in a straight forward manner, he just rambles on like a black preacher on Sunday Service. Promises he can&rsquo;t honor and in my mind wouldn&rsquo;t honor if he could.  </p>

			<p>&ldquo;If you break the numbers down, the reason Obama isn&rsquo;t ahead right now is that he trails badly among one group, older white voters. He does so for a simple reason: the color of his skin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am so sick of this I could VOMITT! But yet blacks are voting for him solely because he his black! HELLO. </p>
<p>Obama has been a Senator for 145 days. His experience speaks volumes. He is the NOW candidate just as much as McInsane is. There is NO difference between the two except the tactics they deploy to get there self-elected. That&rsquo;s it. </p>
<p>Pre-1965 America radicals and Communists were the ONLY ones pushing the idea that race and religion were meaningless trivialities. Forced racial integration was considered to be a Communist plot, largely because it was a Communist plot. And if you think I exaggerate, just consult some history books.</p>
<p>The semantic distortions surrounding the expression &#8220;hate speech&rdquo; invented by the &ldquo;liberal system, by using &#8216;soft narratives&rsquo; and &#8216;sentimental normative locutions,&rsquo; is no less dangerous than the violence and vulgarity of communist double-speak. It is less transparent and therefore it better deceives the masses. But its not working anymore as people are FED UP with the lies. </p>
<p>The United Nations defined genocide in 1948 (in part) as &#8220;acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, &hellip; deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life, calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Multiculturalism is a communist plot plain and simple it does not work. History proves that. If the liberals really valued self-determination for all races and peoples; so they are free to develop and practice their own cultures and traditions in an environment that will continue their own unique development then they would not be promoting a race-less and class-less society through a Multiculturalism Utopia Society. That destroys each unique race! HELLO</p>
<p>The liberals mind set is the vision of Utopia which is defined as a coffee colored race – through miscegenation which is ethnic cleansing of the different races as an entire whole. </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m not voting for Obama because he&rsquo;s dangerously underqualified.  I honestly believe that Obama has the capacity to blunder into a nuclear exchange.  Here&rsquo;s my reasoning:<br>
No one really talks about the threat of nuclear attack anymore, but it&rsquo;s still a possibility.  I think that part of what has kept the US safe from attack thus far is we&rsquo;ve been lead (for the most part, Carter excepted) by tough-minded, mature white males whom our enemies know will use force if we are attacked.   I believe that we being reevaluated by our enemies, and they are going to view Obama with genuine contempt if he&rsquo;s elected.  They will push and prod him, and if he&rsquo;s found to be weak, we will be attacked. </p>

			<p>If Obama loses there will be deadly rioting all over the country. And who will be to blame? Liberals are preparing the answer in this and other articles: white racism will be to blame&hellip;for the deaths of scores, or hundreds, or thousands of whites. In fact, murderous black rampages will be justified as an expression of their - you guessed it - legitimate rage.</p>

			<p>On the other hand, if Obama wins the fact that 95% of blacks cast their ballots in favor of the black prince because of race will be quickly forgotten.  In fact nobody even barely mentions it now.    </p>

			<p>There would be no surer sign of America&rsquo;s decline than to have this affirmative action jackson in the White House.  His own VP pick, Biden said he wasn&rsquo;t qualified not too long ago during the primaries.  If Obama loses, and he will, it will be because of what he&rsquo;s said, what his wife has said and his associations with controversial people.  Picking Biden instead of Clinton was the nail in the coffin.  All those female voters aren&rsquo;t going to appreciate the &#8220;bros before hoes&#8221; strategy.</p>

			<p>Yes, if Barack Hussein loses it will indeed because of racism:  Black racism.  And also anti-white hate.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t realistic to present to the world an anti-white black preacher, Jeremia Wright, spouting vicious hate against whites, with a congregation that wildly supports his hate, and expect them to support a black church member, especially when black talking heads on television announce that such hatred is common in most black churches.</p>
<p>For someone to try to depict white racism as the cause if Obama is defeated is about as dumb as anybody can get, and if his intent is to instill guilt in white people he failed miserably with me.  He comes across as a total idiot, and an incompetent one at that.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;serious attempts to deal with the biggest issues we face: a failing health care system, oil dependency, income stagnation, and climate change.&#8221;</p>
<p>Huh? The &#8216;serious&rsquo; Obama plan for health care.</p>
<p>More government, more income redistribution.</p>
<p>For oil dependency.</p>
<p>More dependency, more consumption, more immigrants, legal and illegal. And more taxes.</p>
<p>For income stagnation.</p>
<p>See number 2.</p>
<p>For climate change?  Even if the democrats believe the messiah can control the weather, even if there was some compelling reason to try, government would screw it up irreparably.</p>
<p>O.K., More taxes.</p>
<p>I see a candidate with no significant experience. No exposure to American values and traditions during his formative years. No father as a role model. Highly questionable political and personal associations both historically and currently. Another affirmative action tale  rising from obscurity with the hand of Ted Kennedy propelling him into the spotlight. All I can think of is 4 decades of White America being stabbed in the back over and over by Ted, and as he exits the worlds stage, his legacy will be defined by leaving us with Obama, his one last &#8216;poison pill&rsquo;. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not Obama that scares me nearly so much as his handlers. Those who have groomed and delivered an uninspiring and mysterious nobody in an empty suit to the brink of the Presidency. Not gambling with your entire life savings or your nations future in exchange for the hope and change of a lottery ticket isn&rsquo;t racism, it&rsquo;s common sense.  <br>

			<p>Or maybe voters picked the one who has at least a resume&rsquo; that qualifies him for the CEO job over the one who hasn&rsquo;t any experience at all for the job; hasn&rsquo;t answered a single question asked him; is liberal beyond belief; hasn&rsquo;t a plan for anything except the word &#8220;change&#8221;; will not salute the flag; he and wife are embarrassed to be Americans; insulted most of the population from time to time during campaign trips; is false in every aspect of his life and may not even be a true citizen of the country (which the drive-by media will not even cover)! Race hasn&rsquo;t a thing to do with it!  This false thug just happens to be black - which of course is misleading because he isn&rsquo;t from mainland Africa, he is more of the Asian clan and comes from the tribes that actually rounded up slaves and sold them to the evil white man  &mdash;    &mdash;  but of course you don&rsquo;t hear about this by the drive-by media either!  So the support of &#8220;African-Americans&#8221; truly shows their own &#8220;racism&#8221; because they are supporting &#8220;him&#8221; because of &#8220;color&#8221; and is a true example of their simple stupidity!  If they would remove color, they would HATE him!  But they are too stupid to do so! </p>

			<p>&#8220;Obama&rsquo;s white mother always preferred that her &ldquo;mate&rdquo; be &ldquo;a man of color.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After reading up on her, this statement rings true.  The colured men in her life weren&rsquo;t random occurance, but her design.  She was racially predjudiced in a way favorable towards colored men, and quite possibly had an ax to grind against whites in general.  If so, her actions displayed the worst attribute of feminism and liberalism.</p>

			<p>  Sounds like the MSM is already making excuses in advance of the electoral butt-whippin&rsquo; I predict Obama will take come election day. Media outlets like the NY Times and CNN have been in the tank for the anointed one for almost a year, so if the electorate doesn&rsquo;t agree with the media, it has to be for the most base of reasons. During Obama&rsquo;s recent trip to Europe, network news basically became an Obama infomercial. But despite the most obvious case of media advocacy in modern times, Obama&rsquo;s popularity is declining. Perhaps the fact that can&rsquo;t open his mouth without advocating a new tax, or quote some anti-americanism, or reveal his Bolshevism, or his lack of respect for caucasians. Without a third party candidate to siphon votes from the GOP, the Dems can&rsquo;t win a national election&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>

			<p>This article along with most media are completely inconsistent.<br>
According to the liberal pundits, it is acceptable for blacks to vote for Obama, and well over 90% are doing so, just because he is black.  But, it is racist for whites to vote for McCain because he&rsquo;s white. This view is absurd and hypocritical!</p>
<p>The Obama campaign has been trying its best to inject race into this election. This is probably not too smart based on Obama&rsquo;s 20 year indoctranation in Jeremiah Wright&rsquo;s church.<br>

			<p>&#8220;If you break the numbers down, the reason Obama isn&rsquo;t ahead right now is that he trails badly among one group, older white voters. He does so for a simple reason: the color of his skin.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obama also leads very well among one group, black voters. He does so for a simple reason: the color of his skin.</p>
<p>Racism in conventional American media means white racism. It is a default definition with a built-in assumption of white wickedness. This is a racism and racial prejudice that many blacks and white liberals must strive to overcome within themselves. (Not that I really expect them to be open minded enough to come to this realization. Their minds are too clenched shut for that.)</p>
<p>&#8220;To some white voters (14 percent in the CBS/New York Times poll), Obama is someone who, as president, would favor blacks over whites.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s associations with the Reverend Jeremiah Wright and with the former Weatherman Bill Ayers is an obvious indicator of his private beliefs. The Weatherman group years ago yapped about stripping themselves of &#8220;white-skin privilege.&#8221;  The Weatherman were the forerunners of the &#8220;white privilege&#8221; bilge we hear so much of these days. You can thank people like Ayers, and his wife Bernardine Dohrn (her birth name was Bernardine Ohrnstein) for popularizing this worldview now so popular with communists, anti-racists, and other assorted dirtbags. If you go to Bill Ayers website (www.billayers.org) you will see on the left side of the home page the &#8220;tolerance&#8221; symbol from the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), you know, the organization that labeled AR a &#8220;hate group&#8221; and posts essays by Tim Wise on their Tolerance.org website. Bill Ayers put the SPLC symbol on the homepage of his website because he obviously agrees with them. Ayers also much admires Malcolm X. </p>
<p>Might some of this be why &#8220;older white voters&#8221; are reluctant to vote for this black candidate? Maybe they have good reason to suspect that Obama will &#8220;favor blacks over whites&#8221; and shove more civil rights laws down their throats. Is this &#8220;crazy irrationality over race&#8221;, or just whites following their cultural and racial self-interest, just like other groups do?</p>

			<p>Maybe because it&rsquo;s not just &#8220;crazy irratinality&#8221;. Maybe it&rsquo;s because he&rsquo;s just not qualified. The &#8220;crazy irrationality&#8221; is that it&rsquo;s racist if whites don&rsquo;t vote for him, but it&rsquo;s not racial if Obama gets 99% of the black vote. Heck their only doing so because it&rsquo;s a historic event. &#8220;the worlds judgement will be severe and inescapable&#8221;. Sorry Jacob Weisberg, I don&rsquo;t care what the world thinks, this is still America.</p>

<p>Get that?  Even having fundamental disagreements with Obama&rsquo;s policies isn&rsquo;t a good enough excuse for not voting for him.  NOTHING is a good enough reason, apparently.  No matter what you say, you&rsquo;re a racist.  </p>
<p>And despite saying that Obama has &#8220;strenuously&#8221; avoided race-baiting (totally false), the writer&rsquo;s entire piece is nothing more than a gigantic exercise in race-baiting of the absolute worst sort   &mdash;   he turns the entire election into a referendum on Obama&rsquo;s blackness, after all, accusing anyone who votes against him of acting on racist impulses!  </p>

			<p>Clearly, the only reason one wouldn&rsquo;t vote for Obama is that he is a racist swine.</p>
<p>That Obama is a man of too meager qualifications to be a Burger King night manager, that he seems remarkably incoherent when not in front of a teleprompter, that he doesn&rsquo;t know how many states comprise the US, that he is a far-left socialist whose acquaintances read like a Who&rsquo;s Who of risible Sixties radicals, and that he clearly believes that government is the source of all wealth obviously make him the best the Democrats could possibly muster.  </p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll go along with that final observation.</p>

			<p>&#8220;His defeat would say that when handed a perfect opportunity to put the worst part of our history behind us, we chose not to. In this event, the world&rsquo;s judgment will be severe and inescapable: The United States had its day but, in the end, couldn&rsquo;t put its own self-interest ahead of its crazy irrationality over race.&#8221;</p>
<p>To the contrary: The defeat of Obama will be the Countries&rsquo; opportunity to put the completely sensible, though perceived worst part of our history behind us, laugh at the world&rsquo;s judgment (only whites can be judged), have a brighter future and end its crazy irrationality over race by rejecting a wholly unsuitable and un-qualified candidate without regard as to his racial makeup.</p>

			<p>Is anyone surprised at an article like this?  It is to be expected from a media shill for the virtues of diversity.  I am sure we can expect to find many articles in the future denouncing the 95+% of blacks who will vote for B. Hussein Obama simply because of his skin color.  Including a large proportion of ersatz conservative Africans.  Yes I will NOT vote for BHO, and I wouldn&rsquo;t even if he was a free market right leaning capitalist.  I am extremely familiar with the race favoritism exhibited by the African members of our country, and will not be party to the further destruction of the White race.</p>

			<p>Obama will be denied the presidency because Americans are sick and tired of being unfairly characterized as being racists. As has been shown time and again, more overt racism is manifested by blacks against whites than the reverse.  This is especially evident when examining hate crime statistics.</p>

			<p>There are so many fallacies and distortions in this article that it is hard to know where to begin. One could go through it point-by-point, but the most ridiculous claim is the last, that Obama&rsquo;s poll numbers are a &#8220;sign and symptom of a nation&rsquo;s historical decline.&#8221; This of a nation that has done everything in its power to lift up blacks, from a brutal war that spilled the blood of thousands of young men, to black males being given the vote even before women, to &#8220;civil rights,&#8221; to &#8220;affirmative action,&#8221; to forced integration, to open borders. And yet, even as we go to more and more ridiculous lengths to help blacks, we are &#8220;a nation in decline&#8221; because we don&rsquo;t want to elect a radical, inexperienced &#8220;feel good&#8221; candidate. Just goes to show, the more we try to help blacks, the more we seem to be hated for it.</p>

			<p>People vote for the person they are most comfortable with, which is the person most like them.  So yes, older whites will vote for McCain.  That is not racial prejudice.  This author commits the sin of omission by not mentioning the fact that Obama is getting 98% of the black vote.  Of course blacks are voting for the &#8220;best&#8221; candidate.</p>
<p>The author then suggests that Obama should be elected for what he represents. Change for the sake of change.  And what do Americans care what the rest of the world thinks anyway?  This election is for what&rsquo;s best for this country, not the world.  Most of the world doesn&rsquo;t have elections, doesn&rsquo;t know what they are, ahd half of those who do hold elections arent honest and fair.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Obama Nation by Jerome R. Corsi, Ph.D., leeringly notes that Obama&rsquo;s white mother always preferred that her &ldquo;mate&rdquo; be &ldquo;a man of color.&rdquo; John McCain has yet to get around to denouncing this vile book&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Weisberg sees nothing wrong with a white woman preferring that the father of her child be &#8220;a man of color.&#8221;  Had a black woman announced that she wanted the father of her child to be white, there would be wailing and soul-searching among the likes of Weisberg.  They would interpret such an attitude as showing a tragic lack of self esteem and a sign of self-loathing.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how one professor sums it up (https://www.answers.com/topic/wedding-band-play-8):</p>
<p>&#8220;just another black woman who prefers a white man.&ldquo;This scene,&rdquo; Wiley declared, &ldquo;points to the inseparability of racism and sexism.&#8221;</p>
<p>That is exactly what plagues so many white women these days (including Obama&rsquo;s mother) - a deadly combination of racism and sexism.</p>
<p>There is plenty wrong with a woman of one race specifically excluding men from her own race; it does display pitiful self-loathing.  To recognize this fact is not &#8220;vile&#8221;.  Indeed, it is Mr. Weisberg who is vile.</p>

			<p>Obama did plenty of playing the race card. His snotty remarks about rural Pennsylvanians, his degrading use of &#8220;acting white,&#8221; and his characterization of his mother as a &#8220;typical white person&#8221; all show us his mind.</p>
<p>But even worse than his explicit bigotry as revealed by his speach is his refusal to apologize for smothering the diversity of the white American peoples, and for slandering them as acting in a way that must not be copied by members of other demographics.</p>
<p>No apology, no presidency.</p>

			<p>Actually, if Obama becomes president, it seriously means this country has lost it bearing.  Obama was built up by the media into a fantasy as this article is an example.  Hopefully, the older generation still has some common sense and can discern between reality and wish full thinking.  The Kennedys have done alot of harm to this country and continues to do.  They hold tightly to their money as most liberals do while others continue to pay for the consequences of their fantasies and demons.</p>

			<p>One of the very rare times I agree with the talking heads.</p>
<p>However, he just doesn&rsquo;t understand the implications of this.  Let me spell it out.  Those racist attitudes, for the most part, did not exist prior to Obama coming on to the scene.</p>
<p>Like with most elements of racism, it&rsquo;s caused by contact with the other race, where people get to see the TRUTH of racial stereotypes and the harsh immorality of the other.  Obama is doing a fine job of dispelling white fantasies about what blacks are like, and making liberals face the consequences of their screwed up world view. Like the moron who supports higher and higher gasoline prices in order to &#8220;save the planet&#8221; from global warming, he backs way off that position once he understands that he in fact is the one who has to pay.  In similar fashion, liberals are figuring out what they will get if Obama is elected.  And they don&rsquo;t like it one bit.</p>
<p>Just a continuation of the rapidly accelerating awaking of white americans to racial consciousness.  One day soon, the author of this article will point at the end of Obama&rsquo;s political career and say &#8220;that&rsquo;s racist&#8221;.  And everywhere he goes, whites will smirk at him and say, absolutely yes&hellip;.and that is a good thing.  Racism is good, anti-racism is evil.</p>
<p>Not soon after that, maybe in my lifetime, anti-racism will no longer be tolerated.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s infuriating to read such a shallow and slanted article.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d vote for a black man in a heartbeat if he was a hardcore conservative up against a lily-livered white Marxist dhimmicrat, such as the author of this abomination of an excuse for journalism.</p>
<p>Obama will be humiliated by McCain not because of his skin color, but because of his character.  He&rsquo;s a sleazy, dishonest, spineless, subtly race-hustling communist and Muslim sleeper jihadist who&rsquo;d dismantle our national security and nourish our enemies.  He and his wife and all of his mentors and associates and collaborators hate America with such stealthy agendas that it&rsquo;s really only an indication of just how sick our country has become, that he&rsquo;s even gotten this far.</p>
<p>Obama is about to be sidelined by the federal judiciary:  Phillip Berg (former Deputy Attorney General of Pennsylvania) filed a lawsuit last week to stop Obama and the DNC from putting Obama on the ballot, based on Obama being Constitutionally ineligible to run for President.</p>
<p>https://www.obamacrimes.com/index.php/component/content/article/1-main/1-philip-j-berg-esq-files-federal-lawsuit-requesting-obama-be-removed-as-a-candidate-as-he-does-not-meet-the-qualifications-for-president</p>
<p>The preponderance of evidence points to Obama being born in Kenya, and therefore not being a natural-born citizen of the U.S., or at least having lost whatever purported U.S. citizenship he allegedly had from Hawaiian birth when he later lived in Indonesia and was adopted by Stanley Ann Dunham&rsquo;s second husband.  Obama has not produced real proof of birth in Hawaii, nor any record of re-establishing a formal citizenship oath upon returning to the U.S. later on&hellip;he travelled to Pakistan in 1981 on an Indonesian passport, and there&rsquo;s just so much murky and heavy legal stuff weighing against his being legit for POTUS that the court will have to grant Berg the injunction, at least setting in motion full discovery and forcing the MSM to finally get on the story&hellip;</p>
<p>Back in Febuary, GOP operatives travelled to Kenya, where they unearthed a birth certificate for none other than&hellip;Barack Hussein Obama, JR., dated August 4th 1961!</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s salad days are peaking right now, and soon to wane, and crash.  Berg himself is somewhat of a whackjob, being involved in 9/11-was-an-inside-jobm type windmill-chasing, but I read his entire lawsuit and it&rsquo;s highly compelling.  <br>

			<p>This is what we are facing in this election.  Those of us who WILL NOT vote for Obama will be labeled as racists.  However, the truth of the matter is that I WILL NOT vote for Obama because I believe in my heart that he is a socialist.  His call for changing America sends chills down my spine.  </p>
<p>Whites are facing minority status in just 30-35 years.  We have been pounded with affirmative action, diversity and multiculturalism for 40 years, since the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Our right of free speech has been drawn and quartered so as not to offend certain ethnic groups - except for the white race.  We are facing the possibility of slavery reparations.  </p>
<p>We have been and are now funding some of the most socialist programs in this country - free housing, free food, etc.  We dole out billions whenever a hurricane hits a town and then watch our hard earned tax dollars being squandered by a bunch of people who can&rsquo;t manage any money in the first place.  </p>
<p>Every company in this country has a diversity program specifically for blacks.  Hiring practices have been turned upside down just so corporations can avoid lawsuits from people who couldn&rsquo;t do the job to begin with.  </p>
<p>So what change does Mr. Obama intend or want.  Is he going to do away with affirmative action laws - never.</p>
<p>Is he going to bring peace and harmony between whites and blacks - the powers that be will never allow it.  </p>
<p>Is he going to lower our taxes and bring a stop to government waste?  Not going to happen.</p>
<p>Is he going to weed out government employees who are not capable of fulfilling their job requirements?  Not going to happen.</p>
<p>Is he going to change his mind and suppose the ban on partial birth abortions?  Not going to happen.  </p>
<p>So, Mr. Obama, what exactly do you want to change about America?</p>
<p>And for all the things I&rsquo;ve listed above (and I&rsquo;m sure there are many more), I will be labeled a racist.</p>

			<p>Perhaps the simple reason NOT to vote for Obama is that he is not experienced enough for such a senior job and has proved it during his speeches recently.  Britain has endured 11 years now of socialist mismanagement with one reason being that they, Labour,  were voted for due to the young and personable Tony Blair (women loved him), a man who talks well, but was unable to deliver with much tax cash being thrown at problems but no good management and discipline.   Please USA do not make the same mistakes.  Vote in someone who has political and life experience, otherwise disaster may soon follow.</p>

			<p>Barack Hussein Obama&rsquo;s political views are unacceptable and many times change&hellip;  His background and true cause are worse.</p>
<p>The thing is, blacks are voting for him only because of the color of his skin.  If a white person does not vote for him, it&rsquo;s because the white person is racist.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not even black, he&rsquo;s mulatto.  He and his racist wife hate this country, they don&rsquo;t belong here, they will do more harm than good.</p>
<p>Everything Barack Hussein Obama represents is disgusting, everyone he aquaints himself with are all anti-American.</p>
<p>Does he even have American and/or White friends? NOPE!</p>

			<p>&ldquo;..but, in the end, couldn&rsquo;t put its own self-interest ahead of its crazy irrationality over race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The most unwittingly accurate comment in the whole article. It&rsquo;s the WN position, actually. It&rsquo;s that we define &#8220;crazy irrationality over race&#8221; just a little bit differently than he does.</p>
<p>On a side note, it must really be frightening to the MSM that they have pulled out all the stops and still don&rsquo;t seem to be able to put their candidate over the hump. Go to the original article and look at all the overwhelmingly negative comments.<br>
I&rsquo;ve noticed that a lot lately, even on lib sites. Then Drudge has this headline today:</p>
<p>PINCH: NY TIMES July revenue down 10.1%; ad revenue down 16.2%&hellip;</p>
<p>We may or may not pull this out for the white race world over, but with more news like this if we go down swinging we also might be able to do it laughing a little bit.</p>

			<p>Jacob Weisberg is still at it.  Good God.  This is one of those race-liberals you just want to choke.  Jack Weisberg&rsquo;s refusal or inability (they amount to the same thing) to confront racial reality stands as a monument to the rank stupidity that sinks every liberal uplift effort; yes, liberals can be the kindest, most caring anti-racists imaginable (though typicall they&rsquo;re simple hypocrites) but their resistance to racial reality defeats their social efforts as judged by their own liberal standards. Of course, Mr. Weisberg, one suspects, has his own rather personal reasons for race-denial, but again, he, like an appalling number of his sort, defeat themselves, since the &#8220;new majority&#8221; their policies are creating will not be nearly as sympathetic as the old one.  </p>

			<p>Let&rsquo;s be very clear about something. What Weisberg and others mean by racist is someone who has a racial preference for a America that is majority White.sically the word racism can mean anything you want it to mean. Race Replacement enthusiasts-Liberals,Leftists and corporatists- are waging a vicious propaganda war against Native Born White Americans. If WE let them define the terms of the debate, they will defeat and conquer Native Born White Americans. We need o define the terms of the debate in an uncompromising way. WE need to start calling Barack Obama and his supporters racist. That is to say, put the burden of the racist charge on Barack Obama on his suporters. Start calling Barack Obama a racist for being hell-bent on reducing Native Born White Americans to a racial minority through the continuation of post 1965 immigration policy. The question We should always confront Barack Obama-and McCain and his &#8220;conservative&#8221; supporters with this:Why should Native Born White Americans be in favor of an immigration policy that would reduce Native Born White Americans to a racial minority?</p>
<p>A Barack Obama presidency will represent the legitimacy and respectibility of a policy of race replacement of White Ameriacns. If you try and prove that you are not a racist to people who hate US intensely-Barack Obama for exampleyou have already lost the debate. Barack Obama and his liberal,leftist and corporte supporters should have the burden of explaining to millions of White Americans why they are  not racist. WE need to state loud and clear that a racist is someone who expects White Ameriacans to tolerate an immigration policy that would reduce the majority White American population to a racial minority in the very nation that they have been a majority since day one. If Native Born White Americns do not define the terms of the &#8220;debate&#8221;, they will be conquered by post 1965 non-whites within a very short period of time.</p>

			<p>I think there is a plot to elect a black man as president so that when we start the future wars that we are going to start it won&rsquo;t look as if those countries are being bombed by old racist white guys. I think there is a feeling that a black man can now get away with more on the world stage because other leaders will be afraid to citicize him for fear of being called racist. </p>
<p>In short I think the real leaders of American want to be in a position to play the race card on an international level. You only hate us because we are black. We have tried everything else. Blacks are now sacrosanct and everyone wants in on it, even the war mongers. </p>

			<p>Actually, you know what folks?</p>
<p>Since the Election is already bought and paid for, and has nothing whatsoever to do with Democracy,<br>
Since there is no more real Free Speech, which means there is no more Democracy for any elected offical to represent, <br>
Since we all know that the Politically Correct, Multi-Cultural Critque of the West, which is designed to pathologize the West, ie; Whites, is ITSELF a pathology, inflexible in its categories and strident in its tone, <br>
then it is clear that this Hit Piece on Whites - one among many - is itself a part of the overall pattern of the Power Elites aggresive efforts to denigrate, demonize, and eventually displace, the White population.<br>
Again, I don&rsquo;t know what more there is to say.<br>
But there is  plenty to do.</p>

			<p>&hellip;&hellip;..&#8221;the truth of the matter is that I WILL NOT vote for Obama because I believe in my heart that he is a socialist.&#8221;</p>
<p>Posted by Gayle Sollenberger at 9:23 AM on August 26 </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s part of my reason too, but to be honest, NO, I won&rsquo;t vote for a black and specificlally, this black.  That is because I know that a black man is clearly - and clearly is in this case, going to favor black beneficial legislation and programs.  So for me, yes, race does come into it.  And to that I say, SO WHAT?  After all, the 90% of blacks in America that say they will vote for him are not voting for him because they understand the complexities of his &#8220;plans.&#8221;</p>
<p>We have to make being called &#8220;racist&#8221; a badge of courage, not a badge of shame, if that is what it takes to stand up for your own people.</p>
<p>But one thing I would like to insert here is that in order for whites to survive as a race and a people, WE are going to have to look at fellow whites with more care and compassion than we have in the historical past.  That means that a form of socialism would be neccessary.  If we cannot have a theoretical white government help our least of members to better themselves so that they can contribute better raised children to our white future, then we will eventually repeat the pattern that led to our government and national corporations to desire &#8220;new blood.&#8221;  And that new blood, has been consistently non-white.</p>
<p>I lived in Slovenia for a while.  Through that experience, I was able to experience the strengths and weaknesses of socialism.  I can tell you this much quickly, Slovenians prize being who they are, they make no qualms about that.  They don&rsquo;t mind paying high taxes because they all benefit alike.  There are only two million of them, so they see themselves as a large familiy.  That is what white Americans lack.  In our history we let everything divide us; different sects of Christianity opposed one another during colonial times and also in the 19th century.  After our CW, the divisions became broader.  But in a nation wher everyone is of the same mind, socialism is a very effective survival mechanism for the particular white, ethnic group.</p>
<p>We spend a lot of time venting our objections to how things are and expressing how we would change what we don&rsquo;t like.  But little thought seems to be given to how whites would save themselves are we become more and more marginalized in the nations we formed.  With no realistic plan, except perhaps creating some vague form of Christian Theocracy, which I think would only revert us back to contending sects of whites as we were in Europe in the 17th century, which influenced the colonial establishments and so our patterns of strife would likely repeat.</p>
<p>It is going to require a lot of new thinking on the part of whites if we really want to plan a future for white survival.  It is going to have to be able to circumvent and not alienate those of us with less religious objectives, for example.  It is going to have to recognize that although presently, opposing enviromental issues has been part of conservative identity, whites can&rsquo;t survive any better than anyone else if planetary health is neglected, etc.  In essence, we will have to be as smart as our claims to intellect supposes us to be.  </p>
<p>We could take a lesson from the Chinese and Japanese who can act as a national group on a given issue out of racial unity and nationalistic pride.  We must cease to have this &#8220;every man for himself&#8221; attitude about survival and the acquisition of wealth.  A great test awaits us, and I have to wonder if we can or will face up to it and change ouselves into a people who can work together?</p>

<p>A &#8220;rejection of the promise&#8221; Obama represents would not be &#8220;a sign and symptom of a nation&rsquo;s historical decline&#8221; as the Wobbly Weisburg says. The very appearance of Obama on the political stage was the sign of our nation&rsquo;s decline, O Wodin-like Weisburg!</p>

In our crazy society, race is his strongest, rather than his weakest point. Because he is black, he gets off on everything wrong with him: the fact that he had an extreme, anti-white pastor for 20 years, his outright lying to the American people about his economic strategy. It will only do more to erode American financial power. Putting Obama in office will just let him and his buddies plunder the imperial coffers like never before. Or the fact that this stuttering, bumbling fool can&rsquo;t remember the number of states in the country he wants to run, or the number of years he can legally serve as such. Every compliment showered upon him further proves how much of a joke the system is.</p>

They know that anywhere from 95-98% of blacks will vote for Obama because of proper pigmentation.</p>

			<p>There have been frequent warnings on this site that blacks will riot nationwide after the election, whether BHO wins or loses.  Such violence would be good for our country, as it would prompt the long sought &#8220;national dialogue on race&#8221;, on the best possible terms for us.  But I think that it is much more of a hope than a realistic prediction.  Unless, as some posters have written, BHO is Constitutionally prohibited from the Presidency by reason of foreign birth.  Should Obama lose, Blacks will angrily ascribe the loss to racism and vote stealing, but if their man is disqualified, they will go into apoplectic fits.  As is usual in high profile cases with a racial angle, the courts give a couple hours notice that a decision has been reached in order that the police can break out the tear gas and flak jackets before the action starts, but even pre-emptive deployment by the cops may not be enough to dissuade the community from throwing a tantrum.  I&rsquo;m glad I work in a Black-free neighborhood.   </p>

In this event, the world&rsquo;s judgment will be severe and inescapable: The United States had its day but, in the end, couldn&rsquo;t put its own self-interest ahead of its crazy irrationality over race.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wrong Comrade Weisberg,</p>
<p>I will vote against him because he is a Red and that is in my self-interests, and my country&rsquo;s as well; however, I will (without, &#8220;crazy irrationality&#8221;) enjoy doing so because of his race. The &#8220;severe and inescapable&#8221; judgments of Communists like yourself in this country and across the globe only increases that pleasure for me, like a very good wine with an excellent meal.</p>

			<p>Some people here have claimed tht they are not voting for Barack Obama because he is a Socialist. Barack Obama is not a Socialist. He is owned by the corporations. His economic policies will reflect this. Barck Obama&rsquo;s health care plan is a gift to the mega corporations. The insurance industry loves Obama&rsquo;s health care plan as they did Hilary Clinton&rsquo;s health care plan.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is there is a large White American population that would like protection from the more brutal aspect of the free market. I&rsquo;m glad there are laws that protect people from being maimed and killed at work.</p>
<p>A White Nationalist candidate who epouses across the board free market policies will never have much support among mllions of Native Born White Americans. Ron Paul&rsquo;s free market policies obviously didn&rsquo;t have much appeal to millions of White Americans.</p>
<p>Combining White Nationialism with the economic policies of Ron Paul is a blueprint for making White Nationalism irrelevant to a majority of Native Born White Americans.</p>

<p>Daniel, the first part of your quote above is interesting.  But the judgement that the rest of the world is as cowed as the majority of Whites in this country is in error..</p>
<p>There is NO coincidence that at the same time the Power Elite is doing all it can to get Mexicans across the border and Obama in the White House they are also using their Public Relations Department - MSM - to denigrate Russia, and even bad mouth China in a way.  But mostly Russia, and for obvious reasons.  <br>
1 - Russia is in NO mood to be pestered by ANYONE from Washington.<br>
2 - Russia has not in any way been deracinated.<br>
3 - Russia is filled with millions and millions of White people who have the sort of Spiritual Discipline that comes from prolonged suffering.  And that suffering was the result of the same sort of thinking that has taken hold of America and turned it into a Politically Correct, Multi-Cultural, Police State. Which brings us to number four. <br>
4 - They are MORE than a match for us in a showdown.  </p>
<p>We lost our country because we were naive and thought we were walking on a prim-rosed lane.  It turned out to be wet cement. Hopefully we&rsquo;ll get ourselves out - somehow. We&rsquo;ll probably have to be blasted out.<br>
But the Power Elite has an Achilles Heel - Single-mindedness of Purpose.  The Hunter, steady and focused, aiming his Rifle at the Charging Lion, can not feel the tickling of the Spider crawling up his leg.<br>
The Power Elite&rsquo;s Modus Operandi was Divide and Conquer. And, to a large extent, they have done just that.- DOMESTICALLY!<br>
But how do you get a Divided Nation who has been conquered by an unapologetically contemptuous Power Elite, who uses BOTH Friend and Foe to accomplish their goal, to fight together for that Power Elite in its equally self-serving Foriegn Wars?<br>
The simple answer is - You can&rsquo;t.<br>
The conclusion? The moment they have acheived complete &#8220;success&#8221; Domestically, will be the moment of their undoing Internationally, which will lead in turn to their unraveling Domestically.<br>

			<p>Our &#8220;African American&#8221; friends are very conspiracy minded(and superstitious),if Obama loses by any margin-especially if it&rsquo;s close-there will be claims of &#8220;disenfranchisement&#8221; and other nonsense which will inevitably result in cities being burned and whites being attacked even more than now(as hard as that is to imagine).<br>
This will be an interesting election indeed</p>

<p>Jupiter, I am one of those posters who are always saying that any successful White community would have to be somewhat socialistic in order to succeed.  Retrostructing will not help, only forward and new thinking for the survival of the race will work - unlikely as it is.</p>
<p>But regarding BHO, he IS a socialist, just as MLK was a communist.  But what a socialist can accomplish in this nation dominated as it is by international corporations is limited.  So they are making deals with for example, the insurance industry to have a kind of privatized socialized medicine, which will probably be even worse than what we have now because they will staff themselves with more foreign born and trained doctors and staff.  This combines with the problem of providing health care for profiteering to produce what I predict will be an incredibly careless health care delivery that will none-the-less be touted and advertised as the best.  And we will all have no choice but to join in and pay.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Barack Obama is a racist and a bigot. He disrespects his own white mother his anti-white racism is so severe. His father abandoned him, his white mother raised him and he calls his book &ldquo;Dreams of My Father.&rdquo; What a bigot!<br>
Call Obama a racist every opportunity you have to everyone you can. Call anyone who is voting for him a racist because they are not voting for a white person.&#8221;</p>

<p>I posit that calling people racists and bigots - even when it is true, only sets up a cycle of accusation.  So we&rsquo;re equal - so what?  When do we get honest and just say, yeah, I&rsquo;m racist - if racism means that I want to see myself represented by those of my own race because all evidence PROVES that only this insures my race&rsquo;s survival?  And when do say - yes, I am a bigot because I KNOW that I am better off in every way when I live in a neighborhood that is all white. Until we become frank, all we will be doing is playing games.</p>

			<p>Regarding Nixon&rsquo;s responsibility for affirmative action: He didn&rsquo;t originate it, some guy in JFK&rsquo;s administration came up with the concept in 1962.  It was rejected, but the idea  became part of the liberals&rsquo; consciousness.  Nixon allowed it to go forward, on the grounds that it would embitter Whites toward the Democrats.  He was right.</p>

			<p>my contribution to Slate:</p>
<p>Reporters hound white voters, pressing them on the &#8220;Bradley effect&#8221;, trying to find the one white voter who will tell them, &#8220;I am not voting for Obama because he&rsquo;s Black&#8221; It&rsquo;s the holy grail this year, but you know what? it would be so much easier to find the black voter who will tell you he&rsquo;s voting against McCain because he&rsquo;s White, or they are voting for Obama because he&rsquo;s black, is there a difference? is there such a thing as a &#8220;positve racism&#8221; and a &#8220;negative racism&#8221; they sound equally racist to me. And the media never fails to point out that it&rsquo;s the uneducated (read ignorant racist whites) whites who support McCain, but they never get around to mentioning that the ave. IQ for blacks in america is only around 80, and that 97% of Blacks will vote for Obama. So, it is equally true to say that Obama will win because of racism, and it was the idiot block carried him to victory.</p>
<p>note to the reporter, there are more whites voting for Obama because he is Black than there are Whites voting against him because he is Black<br>

			<p>1:43 Am on August 28: When posting our racial views on non-racist websites, it&rsquo;s important to ensure that our grammar, spelling, capitalization, and punctuation are correct.  I&rsquo;m glad that the readers of Slate will be exposed to a different point of view on race than what they usually hear, but if there are obvious writing errors, it becomes easier for the muddle-minded to disregard our logic.  Don&rsquo;t give them the chance to dismiss us as ignorant semi-literates.  </p>

<p>I know what you mean Schoolteacher.  But believe me, Slate and other such publications are well aware that AR has some fine Posters to match the material Mr. Taylor provides.<br>
They visit this site and can see posts from people like Dedalus, Robert Kelly, John PM, and many others. Yourself included.<br>
Plus, we&rsquo;re entitled to our semi-literates.  Hell, compared to the posters I just mentioned I&rsquo;m closer to the semi-literate side myself.  And so what?  Like they don&rsquo;t have theirs?</p>
<p>AR is not a perfect site. But I&rsquo;d pick it over Slate on matters of Race any day. And unlike Slate, there are no signs of pretension and no psuedo-intellectuals.</p>

			<p>Jupiter, there is no contradiction between recognizing that Obama is a socialist and that he is also a tool of the corporations.  Socialism is statism and corporations have no problem with that.</p>

			<p>On his own merits, McCain is a waste of space. But thanks to the Democratic Party, there is now a reason to vote for him, simply because he isn&rsquo;t Black when the MMS is stuffing the idea of voting Black down our throats. This globalist, open-borders, liberal moron is now the rebellious White pride choice, which just goes to show how diseased our democracy is.</p>
