<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>More than a hundred asylum seekers are being held tonight after a British student was gang-raped by illegal immigrants in Calais.</p>
<p>The woman was writing a story on asylum seekers for her journalism course when she was attacked, police said.</p>
<p>Up to 100 men have been rounded up as potential witnesses to the crime, which is alleged to have taken place in a notorious squatter camp nicknamed &lsquo;The Jungle&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Police said the attack was of a particularly &lsquo;brutal nature&rsquo;. The victim is still in Calais.</p>
<p>The victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was described as &lsquo;a London student who had travelled to France to highlight problems surrounding clandestine immigration&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Police confirmed tonight she was born in Vancouver and also carried a Canadian passport.</p>
<p>A police spokesman added: &lsquo;She appeared to be working alone, which was clearly a very dangerous thing to do.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We fear that the men she was reporting on attacked her in the wood where they were staying.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The woman, who is thought to be in her twenties or early thirties, told locals she wanted to spend time with would-be illegal immigrants who were attempting to reach Britain by stowing away on lorries.</p>
<p>The squatter camp is in a disused industrial zone called &lsquo;The Dunes&rsquo; and is a short walk from the ferry port.</p>
<p>Up to 500 men live there, supported by local charities.</p>
<p>Father Jean-Pierre Boutoille, of the refugee charity C&rsquo;Sur, said: &lsquo;There are lots of journalists, including students, who come here to get to the heart of what&rsquo;s going on, to write reports and produce films.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When reporters contact us, we always ask to accompany them. We know the refugees as we see them every day.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We would never allow a young female adventurer in this wood, especially not at night.</p>
<p>&lsquo;On Tuesday we did not receive any requests for assistance, and nor did any other charities.</p>
<p>Yesterday, some 100 would-be immigrants to Britain were rounded up by a force of French riot police.</p>
<p>Most of the men claimed to be from Iraq, Afghanistan or the Middle East, although police believe many were from eastern Europe and the Balkans.</p>
<p>One, who asked not to be named, said: &lsquo;Yes, I saw a young journalist with a camera. Lots come this way.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know who she was exactly, but she was young, perhaps 30, and a student from London.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The word is that something happened to her in the woods.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In 2005 a gang of immigrants was implicated in the rape of a resident of Oye-Plage, near Calais.</p>
<p>Calais became a magnet for immigrants in the late 90s following the opening of the Sangatte Cross Centre, which housed 67,000 immigrants over three years.</p>
<p>Before its closure in 2002 following an agreement between the French and British governments, many tried to jump on to slow-moving trains at the entrance to the Channel Tunnel, or hide inside lorries crossing to Britain on ferries.</p>
<p>The election of a new Right Wing council in Calais saw plans to open a Sangatte II abandoned, but would-be immigrants to Britain still arrive by the day.</p>
<p>The Home Office said the number of refugees caught entering Britain illegally from Calais has fallen to around 1,500 a year from 10,000 in 2002, when Sangatte closed.<br>

			<p>funny how some people insist on learning lessons the hard way. this journalism student should do a little more reading, less writing. It would be interesting to see if she writes a 1st hand account of her &#8220;adventure&#8221; though</p>

			<p>There is a God!!!  Of course, silly liberal women who attempt stunts like this will not be dissuaded by these incidents.  But it&rsquo;s a start.  Attention all liberal female journalists: be sure to wear &#8220;rape me&#8221; t-shirts the next time you go into minority controlled areas to get your sappy liberal story.  That way, you get to &#8220;keep it real&#8221;.  Know what I mean?</p>

			<p> How much you want to bet this journalism student sympathized with them and was getting ready to write an article about how inhumane it is to keep them in this squatters camp. I&rsquo;m betting that article doesn&rsquo;t get written now, but then again liberals never learn their lessons.</p>

			<p>The article didn&rsquo;t say whether she was white.  But <i>A police spokesman added: &lsquo;She appeared to be working alone, which was clearly a very dangerous thing to do.</i> sounds stupid enough to be white to me.</p>

			<p>How does that phrase go? A Conservative is a Liberal who just had been mugged.</p>
<p>I suppose that particular journalist had her eyes opened rather abruptly. Lucky for her she at least lived to fell of her ordeal. I just wish there was a way for the woman to SUE those charitis, supporting the illegal immigrants   &mdash;   for her suffering. Which would be poetic justice, since these well-meaning charities simply are accomplices to the immigrants&rsquo; crimes.</p>

Well, let&rsquo;s hope that something good comes of this terrible event, and the young lady in question at least learns from the error of her ways. </p>
<p>Even the most liberal and idealistic of women can only be gang-raped so many times before they start to question their naive assumptions about the true nature of the sainted &#8220;Other.&#8221; <br>

			<p>In the past I felt sorry for such liberal dupes, but no longer; it occurred to me that they&rsquo;re perfectly aware of the (bygone) &#8220;conventional wisdom&#8221; surrounding such matters, but choose to believe the liberal sneering at this wisdom.</p>
<p>They were warned, but they were too smart for that.  Am I supposed to feel sorry for people who are bitten when they swim with sharks?</p>

			<p>I read several accounts of this attack and learned that there are many African illegals in the squatter camp, not just Middle Easterners and Afghans.  More than likely the leftist press doesn&rsquo;t want anyone to know that.</p>
<p>But, what does this Miss Leftist Priss think is going to happen if she goes into a camp like that alone?  Here&rsquo;s where her leftist ideology has caused considerable trauma for her.</p>
<p>This is an example of similar wake up call the liberals here are going to get when the restless natives believe their numbers are great enough to takeover by force.</p>
<p>At that moment they&rsquo;ll realize the horror their perverted belief system has wrought upon them.</p>

			<p>  Stupid young liberal woman, I won&rsquo;t say she deserved it, nobody deserves to be raped. But I do hope she learned a lesson. But then, she and the other brain dead liberals will probably find some excuse for them. Must be white oppression.</p>

			<p>Well, part of the problem with things like this, as I see it, is that a lot of us women have bought into the idea that a woman &#8220;should&#8221; be able to go anywhere she wants without fear of being attacked.</p>
<p>And while that&rsquo;s a nice idea (let&rsquo;s all hold hands and sing Kumbaya, everybody!), it&rsquo;s not the way things work in real life.</p>
<p>Most women are smaller than most men, and are not as physically strong.  It&rsquo;s just a fact of life.</p>
<p>Hell, I&rsquo;m 6&rsquo;1&#8221;, and although I&rsquo;m big and strong for a woman, I know for a fact that I&rsquo;m not as strong as my live-in guy, who&rsquo;s only about 5&rsquo;6&#8221;.  He&rsquo;s stronger.  He&rsquo;s male.  He has more testosterone and more muscle mass. </p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t go into a squatter area like this woman did&hellip; I&rsquo;d be worried that what happened to her would happen to me, whether or not I even had a weapon.  And she most likely was totally unarmed. </p>

			<p>this reminds me of that story from South Africa about a blonde girl who fought for &#8220;equality&#8221; and against &#8220;apartheid&#8221; and was killed by &#8220;poor&#8221; Africans and how her parents became &#8220;freinds&#8221; with her killers, sometimes women just don&rsquo;t learn until they are the next Nicole Brown Simpson. I still see more and more miscgeniation is this because Obama inspires white girls to be with affirmative action receivers?</p>

			<p>&#8220;The first country formally to embrace &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221;  &mdash;  to the extent of giving it a cabinet post  &mdash;  was Canada, where it was sold as a form of benign cultural cross-pollination: the best of all worlds. But just as often it gives us the worst of all worlds. More than three years ago, I wrote about the &#8220;tournante&#8221; or &#8220;take your turn&#8221;  &mdash;  the gang rape that&rsquo;s become an adolescent rite of passage in the Muslim quarters of French cities  &mdash;  and similar phenomena throughout the West: &#8220;Multiculturalism means that the worst attributes of Muslim culture  &mdash;  the subjugation of women  &mdash;  combine with the worst attributes of Western culture  &mdash;  licence and self-gratification. Tattooed, pierced Pakistani skinhead gangs swaggering down the streets of northern England areas are as much a product of multiculturalism as the turban-wearing Sikh Mountie in the vice-regal escort.&#8221; Islamofascism itself is what it says: a fusion of Islamic identity with old-school European totalitarianism. But, whether in turbans or gangsta threads, just as Communism was in its day, so Islam is today&rsquo;s ideology of choice for the world&rsquo;s disaffected.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Only lends creedence to the saying: &#8220;stupidity should be painful&#8221;. She is probably one of those liberals who support allowing those largely undesireable asylum seekers into the country in large numbers, so as far as I am concerned, it is a good reality check for her. </p>

			<p>She&rsquo;s probably indoctrinated beyond home.  Therefore, upon recovery, she&rsquo;ll probably write a sympathetic article about them, blame her ordeal on &#8220;white oppression&#8221; and set up a charity fund for her assailants.  It&rsquo;s always the same old pattern over and over again: &#8220;Central Park Jogger Syndrome&#8221;.</p>

			<p>A very foolish move on her part. I have a feeling her article was mean&rsquo;t to be a sympathetic piece, showing the sad, and desperate plight of asylum seekers, trying to stowe their way into the UK. Of course, most of them prefer the UK simply because it has better benefits. A good many of them are also hardend criminals, and violent opportunists. It was incredibly naive of her to go there alone. No less risky than it would be for an American woman to go across the border to interview Coyotes and border crossers.<br>

			<p>Oh, now she&rsquo;ll write a story telling how she &#8220;felt&#8221; something was wrong, but didn&rsquo;t want to appear racist, so she stayed and got what these feral Africans deal out. Then she will write how she &#8220;forgives&#8221; him and bonds with his disadvantaged family and &hellip; oh gag me with a spoon &hellip; we&rsquo;ve read it all before &hellip; there is no teaching some of these stupid, liberal, whites.</p>

<p>I would hope that this young woman is a leftist. I would also hope that this was her Road to Damscus moment. Experience makes me a pessimist, however.</p>
<p>What will her eventual story say? It&rsquo;ll probably say that these men acted terribly because they&rsquo;ve lived under terrible conditions.</p>
<p>What it should say is that those terrible conditions are created by terrible people, and not the reverse. And these men aren&rsquo;t the symptoms - they are the infection.</p>

Yes I noticed that and it simply wouldn&rsquo;t be true due to freedom of movement in the EU and it feels just so tacked on in. They would be Kurds or Albanians who aren&rsquo;t Euros but most in the camp would be other Arabs and Africans. Thank God for the economic downturn and the coming ousting of the Labour party, things can only get better.</p>

			<p>I see it a lot here in South Africa, white girls from Europe and America getting raped in squatter camps. White girls from here will under no circumstances enter such territory. In it lies the hypocrisy, it is illegal to have a neighborhood for whites that does not allow blacks but whites can not enter a black neighborhoods, you stand a 70% chance of getting raped or murdered. What I never understood thou is when I read about 16 year old white girls from Europe getting raped in squatter camps in South Africa is, How on earth can there parents allow them to go there and how come they do not first speak to local whites who can tell you how to keep safe and where not to go like&hellip;black squatter camps.<br>
Don&rsquo;t want sound mean but perhaps it should happen to all future liberal writers, so there won&rsquo;t be any.  </p>

<p>  It&rsquo;s entirely possible she may become a spokesperson against<br>
the violence of white males. These deluded liberal diversity-loving females never put the blame where it should go  &mdash;  O.J. was a great case in point. As I recall, some California feminists were thrown out of The Movement for putting the blame on minority domestic violence. They looked sympathically on Nicole and Mr. Goldman and were punished accordingly. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Multi-culti&#8221; indoctrination is very convincing and dangerous to a young student who has little life experience.<br>
The results are especially tragic when a dangerous philosophy such as multiculturalism is blended with a dearth of reading material that contradicts these outlooks.<br>
One thing is certain,her father is not a reader of AMREN,for had he been,he would have done a better job of inculcating caution into this young ladies mind.<br>
Let us hope she gained some wisdom from this and that she will pass this to her children. </p>

			<p>The liberal mind is an impenetrable fog of naivete, sentimentality, and moral self-righteousness. No doubt this do-gooder had been manipulated by her college&rsquo;s PC commissars into thinking that immigrants everywhere are fundamentally harmless, even virtuous. But even without the brainwashing, young liberals   &mdash;   especially those with an activist bent   &mdash;   have absolutely no sense of judgment. They perceive the world not how it is, but rather how they want it to be. Thus they moralize incessantly about &#8220;racism,&#8221; embark on romantic crusades to civilize the uncivilizable, and generally make a nuisance of themselves.</p>
<p>So even though this woman is the victim of a despicable crime, I find it hard to feel any sympathy for her. Perhaps it&rsquo;s because I take a grim sense of satisfaction at seeing liberal hubris brought low. I also tend to wonder whether her experience at the hands of these predators might constitute a badly needed awakening. Egalitarian delusions persist, in large measure, because those who most vigorously promote them are able to avoid the consequences. Coming out of one&rsquo;s ideological trance can be a shock, and as the West gradually descends into Third-World barbarism, more and more people will be subjected to the tender mercies of the cultures our elites (journalists included) have so foolishly romanticized.</p>

			<p>Looks like another Amy Biehl type story. I had the strange experience of running into Amy Biehl&rsquo;s sister in a wealthy San Diego area restaurant, she introduced herself as a director of the Amy Biehl Foundation and tried to recruit my daughter to participate and carry on the noble deeds of her murdered sister&hellip;</p>
<p>She was not successful.</p>

<p>I suspect there will be no &#8220;Road to Damascus&#8221; epiphany for this woman.  She will merely attempt to fit this hideous incident into her existing set of beliefs, and will continue on as she has done, as if living in a squatter camp as an illegal alien and gang-raping young women is something that undergrad lacrosse players from affluent families do.</p>

			<p>When I started my career as a teacher in the inner city, I was a naive liberal.  Experience has woken me up but as I am still teaching in an &ldquo;urban&rdquo; community, I suffer from the cognitive dissonance that comes from being a thought criminal and not being able to speak the truth.  If I did speak up, I would loose my means of supporting myself.  I think many whites are in the same position.  It is sad.  What can be done about it?  White people need to start organizing and helping each other. </p>

			<p>Her reaction to her own tragedy would be the most telling. If she is sane she will curse the third world rabble who raped AND her marxist professors who set her up for this tragedy with their bald-faced lies about the nature of barbarous peoples and white racism. If she is an insane true believer, she will contort all logic to actually blame the rape on whites through some appeal to an &#8216;historircal narrative.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I have to agree with a point made above. Feminism and its purge of any dissenting opinion actually places women at great risk. Feminism tries to convince college girls they are invincible superwomen and it works in the West because there is a powerful judiciary to make the illusion seem real. When they bring their illusion into an environment, like immigrant or South African squatter camps, where it cannot be enforced they truly risk life and limb. What is ironic is that feminism will be the first thing to go under an Islamic regime, but feminists support Muslims because they are not white.</p>

That comment touched a  responsive chord in me, because I think it is so true of such a great many of us.  We are kept in line by a very effective sort of self-censorship  Nobody has to threaten us or say a word.  We know that we cannot afford to speak the truth against the reigning orthodoxy without incurring very heavy penalties: professional ruin and personal disgrace.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;Albanians and Kurds not Euros&#8221;&hellip;Some years ago, travelling in old Yugoslavia, I find myself in a midle of a fight to defend a group of girls (Spaniards) from a Albanian gang of thiefs. They are all white. Maybe Muslims, but religion is not race. There is another Albania? Since then, I met a lot of Kurds (and Iranians).<br>
Almost all can &#8220;pass&#8221; easily by south europeans. Certainly, they are not &#8220;euros&#8221;, but surely they are &#8220;white&#8221; to me.</p>

			<p>ex-liberal you should  use &#8220;grayisms&#8221;.  What I mean is that there are many things you can say, using leftist jargon, that are not according to official dogma but that they really can&rsquo;t attack you for.  When you bring up European-American heritage to your white students (if you have any), you&rsquo;re doing it to &#8220;help their self-esteem&#8221; and to achieve &#8220;inclusiveness&#8221;.  When you praise &#8220;dead white males&#8221;, you&rsquo;re doing so within the framework of &#8220;cultural relativity&#8221; because they, having lived hundreds of years ago, did not have the same culture as we do.  Therefore you judge them according to their own culture.  Not ours.  When you read something out loud in front of your class and happen to come across a politically incorrect statement - you act surprised, raise your eyebrows and say &#8220;hmmm&hellip;&#8221; in a neutral, thoughtful sort of way.  You can throw around hints here and there without actually coming out and stating something controversial.  When a white student doesn&rsquo;t do so well on a test or fails to do his homework, you can give him some slack, just as leftists do all the time with blacks.  If they call you on it, explain that you did this because he is trying to &#8220;overcome adversity&#8221;.  With some imagination, it&rsquo;s amazing how much can be said without actually explicitly saying it.  Good luck!</p>

<p>I think that there is much truth in this statement.  There is a world in which talk is cheap and action speaks louder than words.  When women (and a great many men) are removed from their protected environment, they all too often learn the hard way.</p>

<p> It appears the student was a 31 year old Canadian. That makes some sense. Canadians are among your more brainwashed and historically naive White peoples. It also seems the &#8220;immigrants&#8221; (as the BBC website insists on calling them, I would say illegal aliens or criminal trespassers) were mostly from Ghana and the Sudan. </p>

<p>Excellent post. I would mention a powerful judiciary only applies where there is rule of law and respect for law. Obviously the third world doesn&rsquo;t meet either criteria. Too bad this foolish female had to learn this lesson the hard way. Don&rsquo;t listen to your college professors girls. They will only lead you astray and into possibly danger.</p>

			<p>A little bit of race-realism could have easily prevented this. So many White females are in a state of utter ignorance about colored peoples, especially blacks. Thanks to Hollywood, MSM and MTV they are brainwashed to think blacks are &#8220;cool&#8221;. Then they go off to college where a bunch of marxist clap-trap professors cram a lot of P.C. orthodoxy garbage down their throats. You have to make sure your children UNDERSTAND the truth about these things. Their safety is at stake.</p>

			<p>Albanians are surely White. I have pictures of them and they look like any other White people. Some might be a bit dark and swarthy, but so are Italians.</p>
<p>Kurds are White. They&rsquo;re as White as Jews, and Taylor says Jews are White. They&rsquo;re related to Jews. Kurds are actually one of the purest groups of Whites out there - they hardly have any Black in them. I can show you pics of Kurdish guys who just look like White people. Maybe a bit swarthy.</p>

<p>I worked with thousands of Bosnians and Balkan lads in Afghanistan. The difference between a &#8220;Bosnian&#8221; and a &#8220;Bosnian Serb&#8221; is huge. The Muslims are terrible who descend from race traitors who took muslim names to get goverment jobs in the Ottoman empire. The &#8220;Serbs&#8221; are the greatest white patriot&rsquo;s on earth who have given up prosperity for generations to remain true to Christ and the white race. </p>
<p>Do not let the press mingle the two. It is a disgrace to the &#8220;Medal Of Honor&#8221; winners of our race. </p>

<p>I do not think it is this so much as that society insists that Blacks and other groups, such as Muslims in the West, are no more dangerous, violent or criminal than any other group. </p>
<p>I have a feeling the rapists are White. The asylum-seekers in France, I think, are mostly Blacks. There should not be many Arabs seeking asylum there, and there won&rsquo;t be any E Europeans seeking asylum. You know this just another Black gang rape.</p>

			<p>I wonder if she&rsquo;ll carry the pregnancy? Diversianity encourages abortion, but only when the life of a White child is at stake. In this woman&rsquo;s case, the resulting child will be encouraged through her religion as it will truly be &#8220;diverse&#8221;; her child could be Middle-Eastern, Black, or whatever qualifies as an asylum seeker in France these days.</p>
