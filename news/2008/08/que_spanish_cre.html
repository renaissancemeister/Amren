						<p>For generations, the reason why the Mary Rose sank during a battle with a French invasion force has divided historians.</p>
<p>Now a new theory can be added to the list of suggestions about why the pride of Henry VIII&rsquo;s navy was lost: two thirds of its crew were foreigners who failed to understand orders.</p>
<p>Forensic science examinations of the 16th-century crew&rsquo;s skulls have revealed that the majority were not British but southern European, most probably Spanish.</p>
<p>Researchers believe that the vessel&rsquo;s fate was sealed because of their inability to understand their officers&rsquo; orders when it began taking on water in the Solent, off Portsmouth, in 1545.</p>
<p>It is believed that the crewmen were either mercenaries from the Continent recruited to fight by Henry VIII or Spanish soldiers shipwrecked penniless in Britain and forced into military service.</p>
<p>The new theory also goes some way towards solving the riddle of the last words reputedly shouted by the ship&rsquo;s admiral, George Carew, to another English ship, that his men were &ldquo;knaves I cannot rule&rdquo;. The latest explanation has been put forward by Hugh Montgomery, a medical researcher at University College London.</p>
<p>Until now, it had always been believed that the Mary Rose sank as it performed a sharp turn, causing the open gun ports to submerge, flooding the vessel.</p>
<p>However, Professor Montgomery claims that the ports were left open only because the Spanish crewmen could not understand quickly enough the command to close them.</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;In the chaos of battle, with all the shouting and guns going off, it would have taken a very clear chain of command and a very disciplined, well-rehearsed crew to close the gun port lids in time.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He reached the conclusion after he and a team of experts carried out an exhaustive examination of the crew&rsquo;s remains with the permission of the Mary Rose Trust. After the skulls of 18 crew members were examined to determine where they had lived, it was discovered that about 60 per cent were of southern European origin.</p>
<p>Scientists can determine roughly the region where a person grew up by analysing the chemical composition of their teeth, which retain the type of water molecule they consumed in childhood. </p>
<p>A device called a mass spectrometer can detect whether heavy or light atoms of oxygen were present in the region&rsquo;s rainwater, which is absorbed into the soil and subsequently plants and people&rsquo;s teeth. Heavier atoms indicate a warmer climate.</p>
<p>Professor Montgomery said: &ldquo;The analysis of the teeth rules out Britain and countries in northern Europe. It suggests that the men grew up in a warm climate, probably somewhere in southern Europe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is also known that at this time Henry VIII was short of skilled soldiers and sailors and was trying to recruit mercenaries from the Continent.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Previous experiments have revealed that the ship would have capsized if a sudden wind had sprung up as it attempted to perform a sharp turn to outmanoeuvre the French. It would have heeled, submerging the gun ports, which were open because of the ensuing battle and were only about 3ft above the waterline.</p>
<p>The ship was raised in 1982 after the recovery of a wealth of artefacts, as well as 10,000 human bones.</p>

			<p>Well&hellip;mebbe.  I suppose it&rsquo;s quite possible the Mary Rose had a largely foreign crew, but this single method of determining their origins&hellip;is this conclusive?  I&rsquo;d like to see some different types of supporting evidence.  </p>
<p>And it seems to me there&rsquo;s a LOT of extrapolation going on here about why the ship sank.  Hugh Montgomery seems convinced that the Spanish sailors&rsquo; presumed inability to comprehend the order to close the gun ports is THE cause.  But was the order even given?</p>
<p>Englishmen are notorious for taking a far fetched theory only thinly supported by physical evidence and conjecturing their way to why it&rsquo;s a dead lock cinch.  Look at this chap who has written two books claiming that the Chinese were first to circumnavigate the earth (beating Magellen by a century) and actually started the European Renaissance by sailing to Italy and giving those poor Eurotrash blockheads the fruits of their advanced civilization.</p>
<p>The Mary Rose thing sounds a little more plausible, but still&hellip;more evidence, please.</p>

			<p>One for all to use:</p>
<p>Whenever an English language challenged individual attempts to speak to me in the language I can now easily identify as Spanish, I always purposefully muck up the conversation until I get the &#8216;que/K?&rsquo; (translated from Spanish as &#8216;what&rsquo;?) out of them, in which I simply reply to the soon to be dumbfounded denizen with,&#8221;L, M, N, O, P&hellip;now what?&#8221;</p>
<p>Is this not the perfect retort to &#8216;que?&rsquo;!<br>

			<p>Mary Rose had been rearmed with heavier cannon on the upper gun decks in place of the earlier - and obsolete - &#8220;murdering pieces&#8221; - swivel guns that were useful only in a boarding action.  The Swedish &#8220;Wasa&#8221; sank for much the same reason: top-heavyness.</p>
<p>I have been called &#8220;juvenile&#8221; here in a post that made it past the editor for my assiduous study of sea battles during the age of sail, but the Royal Navy had a firm policy of actually lightening captured foreign ships by changing out their upper deck guns during the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries.  Even during the Battle of Quiberon Bay, the French had several ships founder with nearly all hands, while the Royal Navy lost only ships that went aground, and who&rsquo;s crews were saved.  During the Seven Years&rsquo; War, the American Revolutionary War and the Napoleonic Wars, the Royal Navy even replaced lower deck guns of captured ships.  The French 36-pounder fired a ball that was about 40 English pounds.  These were replaced with English 32 pounders and the captured French cannon used ashore in fortifications.  The English made up for the disparity in broadside weight by firing faster broadsides.</p>
<p>The last navy that pretended not to care about a given ship&rsquo;s metacentric height or curve of stability was the Russian navy during their 1904-1905 war with Japan, during which they got their clocks thoroughly cleaned.</p>
<p>The Spanish employed many mercenaries themselves, especially Italian crossbowmen from Genoa.  The English at the time the Mary Rose went down were not big on crossbows, since the Welsh longbow has been proved for some 250 years as the ideal weapon for slaughtering Scots, French and Spaniards.  It required much more training to use, but could fire six times as fast as a crossbow.  One of the skeletons removed from Mary Rose was quickly identified as a professional longbowman, due to the deformations of his arm and hand bones.  Henry VIII required all Englishmen to practice with their bows after church every Sunday, instead of playing games.</p>
<p>It seems singularly unlikely that Henry VIII would have crewed a major warship with captured Catholics, since he had made himself the sworn enemy of the Catholic church.</p>
<p>I am not buying this bridge.</p>

			<p>The lead ship of their line crewed by foreigners, possibly forced to serve?  It seems Britain has always dabbled in multiculturalism and never learned the lessons.  But the ruling class was famous for exhausting almost every generation of young Englishmen for their enrichment.</p>

			<p>This hypothesis, if ultimately accurate, is certainly a cautionary tale. But not for the need of a common language. It is a warning to the fools who hire mercinaries, foreign nationals, immigrants, etc., to fight for them.<br>
Just like the US military.<br>

			<p>During the age of sail, Spanish sailors were among the worse sailors. Poorly trained and low on morale. Throw in a language problem and you have a disaster in the making.<br>
   Not the first time they have chosen cheap labor over quality labor.<br>

			<p>maybe if someone kept statistics on the causes of workplace injuries, we would not need to speculate about a shipwreck that happened hundreds of years ago. OF COURSE LANGUAGE MATTERS! lack of communication in any dangerous situation KILLS PEOPLE! i have seen it in the factory floor. this point has been proven to anyone willing to see it.</p>

			<p>This has to be one of the most ridiculous historical commentaries I&rsquo;ve ever read, assumption, speculation, supposition, fantasy, and science fiction piled atop one another like an endless layer cake.</p>
<p>Small-skulled British tars, actually press-ganged Spaniards, can&rsquo;t understand English commands because they speak no English, fail to close gun hatches during turning maneuvers, ship floods and sinks with all hands.</p>
<p>The story bristles with ethnic overtones and we would do well to take heed. </p>
<p>I can see the headline:  MacDonald&rsquo;s sinks because counter-people don&rsquo;t understand English!</p>

			<p>Gun ports three feet above the waterline is absurd.  How often does open ocean NOT have three foot swells?  If you look at photos of the U.S. Navy&rsquo;s pre WW2 battleships, you will see &#8220;notches&#8221; in the hull that look like covered up gun positions, because that&rsquo;s what they are.  The navy decided it wasn&rsquo;t worth having guns that couldn&rsquo;t be worked in heavy weather, and removed them.  Those five inch guns were 20 feet above the waterline.  <br>
     During the Napoleonic Wars, the Royal Navy crewed its ships with &#8220;impressed&#8221; Americans.  Many ended up fighting their own countrymen in the War of 1812.  The Royal Navy relied on the lash to keep sailors, of any nation, in line.  I&rsquo;m sure that Spanish captives of the 1500s earned their keep, whether serving the British or the Turks.</p>

			<p>This is sheer speculation and little more. An interesting theory perhaps. They&rsquo;ve taken a known fact here and a known fact there, and tried to piece them together.  But this is not history.</p>
