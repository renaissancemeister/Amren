<h1><a href="/ar/2000/02/index.html">Do Americans Really Want Diversity?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jared Taylor, American Renaissance, February 2000</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Diversity of religion, language, culture and especially race is now one of the official benefits of living in the United States. From the President on down, public officials glory in the transfor-mation of our country from a European nation into an Afro-Hispanic mish-mash. It is impossible to find a mainstream defense of homogeneity or even of free association, now that every American institution and major organ of communication is an ardent branch of the church of diversity.</p>
<p>But what do ordinary Americans think about diversity? Or at least what are they prepared to tell a poll-taker about it? Last December, the <a href=" https://archive.nc-f.org/" target="ncf" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>New Century Foundation,</b></a> which publishes American Renaissance, hired a polling company to conduct a telephone survey. We had Opinion Research Corporation International of Princeton, New Jersey, ask a representative sample of about 1,000 Americans the following questions and propose the following possible answers:</p>
<p>(1) Would you rather live in a neighborhood where your race is in the majority, or one in which it is a minority?</p>
<p>a. Majority.<br>
b. Minority.<br>
c. Makes no difference.</p>
<p> (2) The Census Bureau predicts that if current levels of non-European immigration continue, in 40 or 50 years whites will become a minority in the United States. Overall, do you think this will be a good thing for the country or a bad thing for the country?</p>
<p>a. Good thing for the country.<br>
b. Bad thing for the country.<br>
c. Makes no difference.</p>
<p>(3) Until the 1960s, immigration to the United States was overwhelmingly from Europe. Now, with large-scale immigration from non-European countries, the United States is becoming more diverse in terms of race, language, religion and culture. Do you think this a good thing for the country or a bad thing for the country.</p>
<p>a. Good thing for the country.<br>
b. Bad thing for the country.<br>
c. Makes no difference.</p>
<p>The replies, tabulated in percentages and separated by race, are displayed in the three <em>left-hand</em> graphs below (the percentages of &#8220;don&rsquo;t know&#8221;s and &#8220;refused to answer&#8221;s are small and are not displayed). Disregarding for now the three graphs on the right, what is most striking about these results is the number of people who claim that diversity-related changes make no difference. In the top left graph, for example, we find that 70 percent of whites and about 80 percent of blacks and Hispanics say the racial makeup of their neighborhood doesn&rsquo;t matter. Likewise, for the second and third questions, the largest overall answer is &#8220;diversity&#8221; makes no difference.</p>
<p>Can we trust these answers? No. It is impossible to believe that 70 percent of whites don&rsquo;t care whether they live in a white or black neighborhood. That, however, is the fashionable answer to a sensitive question, and when a pollster throws out the lifeline by offering &#8220;it doesn&rsquo;t matter&#8221; as a possible answer, whites and non-whites alike gladly reach for it.</p>
<p>At the same time, since the poll made it easy not to take a position, the people who actually expressed an opinion were probably being honest &mdash; and their opinions are significant. By a margin of 26 to one (26 percent to one percent) whites would rather live in neighborhoods where they are the racial majority. Not surprisingly, non-whites are less adamant about being in the majority. Everyone knows white neighborhoods are desirable, and blacks and Hispanics probably assume that if they are going to be a minority, the majority is going to be white. Even so, almost four times as many Hispanics want to be a majority as want to be a minority (11 percent to three percent). For blacks the numbers are eleven percent to eight percent.</p>
<p>As for a white-minority nation, whites oppose it four to one. By a slim margin blacks want whites to become a minority, but Hispanics do not.</p>
<p>For all groups, the majority of people who expressed a preference say they think diversity is a good thing, with Hispanics leading by a considerable margin. Not surprisingly, whites (at 25 percent) are the most likely to say diversity is bad for the country.</p>
<p>Taken together, these three responses show that whites, at least, have contradictory opinions about &#8220;diversity.&#8221; They are in favor of it as a general proposition, but they don&rsquo;t like its actual consequences, that is, more non-white neighborhoods and minority status for whites. This contradiction is not hard to understand. People have heard over and over that diversity is good, so they think they agree. What they have <em>not</em> heard over and over is what &#8220;diversity&#8221; really means. Whites don&rsquo;t want to become a minority and they don&rsquo;t want more neighborhoods to go south. They probably don&rsquo;t want the other things &#8220;diversity&#8221; brings &mdash; more people who can&rsquo;t speak English, more Santeria, more anti-white hatred, fewer white playmates for their children, more non-white television &#8220;role models,&#8221; etc. &mdash; but the poll did not go into all that.</p>
<p>The black replies are the most consistent. Slightly more than half want to live in black-majority neighborhoods and a slim majority thinks it would be good for the country for whites to become a minority. It is therefore perfectly consistent for blacks to be in favor of more racial diversity.</p>
<p>Hispanics want to be the majority in their neighborhoods, and since they are the largest current source of it it is no surprise they favor diversity. Why do they oppose whites becoming a minority? Perhaps they understand better than blacks that it is whites who have made this country a desirable place to live and that America would go downhill if whites disappeared.</p>
<p>What about the people who claim that none of this makes any difference? It is tempting to think many of them are lying. People who read AR are more concerned about racial questions than most Americans, but it is still hard to believe that <em>more than half</em> of respondents of all racial groups really think <em>it makes no difference</em>  if their neighborhoods change race or whites become a minority.</p>
<p>Therefore we decided to ask Opinion Research to ask a different but statistically comparable sample of Americans the very same questions but not to offer &#8220;makes no difference&#8221; as a possible answer. We hoped to get more realistic answers by forcing respondents to take a position. The results of the second poll are displayed in the three graphs on the <em>right</em> side, below. It is striking that even when the polltaker did not offer it as a possibility, &#8220;makes no difference&#8221; was the largest overall winner in two out of the three questions. Are Americans really as indifferent as they say they are to these issues or are they once again hiding their opinions? It&rsquo;s not easy to say.</p>
<p>Whites are the group we would most expect to be hiding their opinions, but when the easy way out of &#8220;makes no difference&#8221; is taken away from them, respondents who dodged the issue when they had the chance now take positions that are inconsistent. For example, if we compare the top two graphs asking the question about neighborhoods, when the &#8220;makes no difference&#8221; option wasn&rsquo;t offered, the number of whites who said the race of the neighborhood didn&rsquo;t matter dropped 26 percent &mdash; from 70 percent to 44 percent. And which way did those 26 percent go? Most of them gave the politically <em>incorrect</em> answer. Those saying they wanted a majority-white neighborhood jumped from 26 percent to 50 percent, while those claiming they want to be a minority went from one percent to only three percent. On the basis of this single answer, we would assume that a large number of whites who took the easy way out in the first poll were hiding unfashionable opinions that were smoked out in the second poll.</p>
<p>However, the white fence-sitters sorted themselves out very differently on the second and third questions, largely giving the politically <em>correct</em> answers. To the question about whether whites becoming a minority would be good or bad, the number saying it would be bad scarcely budged, going from 28 percent to 31 percent, while the number who said it would be good more than doubled from seven percent to 15 percent. Are true opinions being flushed out or are whites hiding behind the politically correct answer? It&rsquo;s not possible to know. (It&rsquo;s worth noting that this was the question that got by far the largest percentage of &#8220;don&rsquo;t know&#8221; answers. For the first poll, when whites were offered the &#8220;makes no difference&#8221; option, six percent said they didn&rsquo;t know. When the &#8220;makes no difference&#8221; option was taken away, that number rose to 15 percent.)</p>
<p>For the question about the overall benefits of diversity, nine percent of the white fence-sitters moved over to the politically correct, &#8220;good for the country&#8221; answer while only four came out against diversity. It is hard to know which poll gives the more accurate picture of what Americans really think.</p>
<p>Hispanics seem to be giving reasonably consistent answers. They are the most likely to say that it would be a good thing for whites to become a minority, and are most likely to say &#8220;diversity&#8221; is a good thing. They are currently the main source of &#8220;diversity,&#8221; so they are bound to like it. And at least in the second poll they don&rsquo;t seem very bothered by the prospect of whites becoming a minority.<br>
<div class="text-center"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">  <tr>    <td align="center"><img src="/news/2008/08/22/classic.gif" alt="graph"><br><img src="/illustrativeArticles/images/spacer.gif" width="20" height="2"></td>  </tr></table><br>
</div></p>
<p>Here we have a classic group conflict: Hispanic advance comes at the expense of whites. Not even today&rsquo;s browbeaten whites are very happy at that prospect of decline, but Hispanics don&rsquo;t mind seeing their numbers grow. And, as a general matter, Hispanics are free to express their preferences about the changing population but whites are supposed to keep their mouths shut.</p>
<p>Opinion Research analyzed the answers in terms of respondent characteristics like age, sex, education, and income but the results were not particularly striking. For example, men and women gave similar replies to the first two questions, but five to six percent more women than men gave the politically correct answer to the third question about general diversity. Perhaps women were less able to grasp the contradiction between favoring diversity in the abstract and opposing its actual consequences.</p>
<p>Older Americans are consistently less &#8220;liberal&#8221; than young people. In the first poll, 37 percent of respondents age 65 and over thought the prospect of whites becoming a minority was a bad thing; only 14 percent of 18- to 24-years-olds did. In the second poll, 51 percent of the youngest group thought &#8220;diversity&#8221; in general was a good thing whereas only 32 percent of the oldest groups thought so. Americans appear to wake up to reality as they grow older. There were equivalent differences in the answers to all the questions.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the more education Americans have, the more likely they are to say they want to live in neighborhoods where theirs is the majority race. In the first poll, 31 percent of college grads but only 16 percent of high school dropouts wanted to be the majority. At the same time, perhaps hypocritically, college grads are considerably more likely to favor &#8220;diversity&#8221; in the abstract &mdash; 43 percent and 54 percent in the two polls, versus 18 percent 26 percent for high school dropouts.</p>
<p>No matter how these results are interpreted, it is clear that only a minority of whites are prepared to express to a poll-taker views that we wish were more widespread. Still, we are by no means a tiny minority. According to the second poll, half of all whites don&rsquo;t want to live in minority neighborhoods, nearly a third dislike the idea of becoming a minority, and a quarter say that diversity is bad for the country. They say these things in the teeth of very strong official opposition to these views. There is <em>no doubt</em> that some whites &mdash; perhaps many &mdash; were afraid to tell a stranger what they really think. This means we still have a substantial base of racially conscious whites who, if mobilized, could have a tremendous influence on the future of our country. AR<br>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve always been a person who&rsquo;s spoke my mind no matter how politically incorrect it may be.  I&rsquo;m starting to wonder if these kinds of stories register in White people&rsquo;s brains and act as mental straight jackets.  You read about other people not speaking their mind and you start to think maybe you shouldn&rsquo;t either.  </p>

<p> I&rsquo;m a young American, and nothing made me hate<br>
diversity more than living in it. The brainwashing<br>
wears thing and the double standards get old. What<br>
really gets old is that my race is condemned <br>
nonstop.</p>

<p>This, of course, is our worst fear.  Tim might be right.  Over 30 years ago, even before his Harvard Address, Solzhenytsin talked about his first impression, not just of America, but of those in high up in the misty realms of Government, Business and Education.  And what was his first impression?</p>
<p>He was shocked at the obvious and pervasive lack of will among those in the drivers seat, so to speak, of the West.  A full generation later and the Children and Grandchildren of the generation before appear, for the most part, like a bunch of shallow conformists who aren&rsquo;t at all concerned about their future. <br>
But not all of them are like that. And it&rsquo;s the ones who aren&rsquo;t that I think about every single day. I hope they&rsquo;re ok.</p>

			<p>You&rsquo;ve managed to hire someone who&rsquo;s not offensive, congradulations. Now try hiring someone who&rsquo;s not an idiot. And while on the subject&hellip; how about hiring someone who doesn&rsquo;t Look like an idiot. Aren&rsquo;t there communications departments all across the country churning out graduates en masse, most of them white and not exactly first pick for the local news.  </p>

			<p>Actions speak louder than words. When you look at the actions of people, they prefer their own race.  It is quite evident that even whites who are the most liberal on the subject of diversity, generally still live in mostly white areas or move to a different neighborhood and school district if too many blacks/hispanics move in. I live in Texas. There is a woman in my office who has two kids. She claims to love diversity and talkes about how she wants her kids exposed to &#8220;divesity.&#8221; Well, there is a school two blocks from here home, but it is like 70% hispanic and about 25% black. Instead of sending her kids there where they could simply walk to school, she registers her kids in her ex-husband&rsquo;s school district which is 90% white and about 10% hispanic or asian. There are few blacks. She gets up early and drives across town in rush hour traffic to take them there. Then she brags about how the school is 10% non-white which gives them diversity. I asked her why not just send them to the school 2 blocks, it would be so much easier for her. She replies it&rsquo;s not a good school. Here is the thing, for those of you from out of state, Texas has the &#8220;Robin Hood&#8221; plan where are schools, regardless of the  inocme level of the neighborhoods they are in, are equally funded by the state. Furthermore, all teachers in Texas must have the same educational and state credentials. Since this school is equally funded and the teachers are equally trained, then why would it be so much worse??? Again, whites say one thing but do another, even the most liberal when it come to diveristy. Whites vote with their feet.</p>

			<p>Diversity is being forced upon all Western nations, via laws and propaganda. It&rsquo;s a plan being carried out, and the majority of Westerners are laying down for it  &mdash;  so effective is the propaganda.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s a matter of common observation that older people are more conservative than younger ones, due to their greater experience. As to who&rsquo;s right   &mdash;   where do you go for wisdom, to the young or the old?</p>

			<p>The existence of concentrations of non-whites in any previously majority or all white nation proves that most whites prefer to live in all white areas.<br>
If an area has 1,000 houses and all are owned by white families, and one family moves out, what are the chances of that house being purchased by a non-white family, if the non-white population of the country is, say, 5%? 1 in 20. Allowing for greater poverty among non-whites, let&rsquo;s improve the odds and say it&rsquo;s 1 in 10. There are nine potential white buyers for every non-white buyer.<br>
Following this pattern, how is it possible for any area to become 25% non-white, 50% non-white, etc? UNLESS the vast majority of whites actively AVOID buying houses in areas with even a small number of non-whites in?</p>
<p>And that, in a nutshell, is the proof that MOST white people want to live in an all white country - and why the hell shouldn&rsquo;t we?</p>

			<p>Race in the country is always defined along the fault lines of white, black, and Hispanic.  Of course, this is partially because these are the three more prevalent racial groups.  East and Central Asians are generally not broken out.</p>
<p>White aversion to black and Hispanic association and presence is not unthinking prejudice. It&rsquo;s the settled conclusion of many years of observation and experience.  Blacks are foremost among the violent and criminal element (by a huge margin), Hispanics are a distant second, and Asians hardly figure at all in the picture.</p>
<p>Would I prefer to live surrounded by like-minded people?  Who wouldn&rsquo;t?  But I can live happily among people with whom I have little in common as long as they&rsquo;re civil, law-abiding, respectful of my privacy, and keep up their property.</p>

			<p>Watching the Olympics last night I found myself happy the underdog Russian all-White relay team pulled an upset win over the Black and mixed-race teams. Blacks are more talented runners, but against all odds, partly due to better baton passing, they surprised everyone. The communal hug and joy of the four women warmed my heart; it seemed to spring from something instinctive in me.</p>
<p>If one could measure in Whites the number that had that same identification, one could get a better sense of what&rsquo;s in Whites than any superficial survey. But it&rsquo;s really impossible. You can&rsquo;t separate the situation from the emotion or attitude. Life rises to the occasion. If you took your cat to the Vet because you thought it too lethargic, it would in front of the Vet be alert and wary at the smells and sights of danger.</p>
<p>Whites are asleep to danger. When the danger is near, we&rsquo;ll know, one way or the other, not before. I distrust theoretical questions and answers. Backs against the wall courage will tell. The lull in lack of danger is unnatural and due to aberration of normal historical circumstances. As it says in the book of Job: &#8220;Man is born for trouble as the sparks fly upward.&#8221; We&rsquo;re already beginning to see things come apart. The World isn&rsquo;t going to end; it&rsquo;ll go on like it always has, with people living dangerously; that&rsquo;s when you&rsquo;ll see White at their best, calculating on their feet, part of a family of other Whites, as they live in a dangerous open-ended world.</p>

			<p>You don&rsquo;t need a poll for this, look in the real world.  All the subdivisions I&rsquo;ve ever lived in were at least 95% White and the schools my kids go to are overwhelmingly White.  Everyone else is following the same pattern!  </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m sure the oppion has changes alot sense 1999/2000 when you made this article. I think a great deal more whites hold views more towards our side today. Back then many white were not faceing multi-culterism down the throat like they are today. Many more white are awake, how do I know because white people are so much more open to me about their oppions then before.</p>

			<p>I believe from observation and some experience that not only do most Americans not want diversity, most other nations and the native people in them don&rsquo;t want it. This almost seems obvious to me, unless I have my signals really screwed up. You can that most don&rsquo;t want diversity in a millions different settings. Even the progressives, who write books critizing conservatives, live in gated lily white communities as a rule. </p>

			<p>&#8220;I believe from observation and experience that not only do most Americans not want diversity, most other nations and the native people in them don&rsquo;t want it. This seems obvious to me, unless I have my signals really screwed up.&#8221;<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;  -<br>
No, you don&rsquo;t, Bobby. Your signals are right. Those who control us want diversity, <b>regardless </b> of what we want. And they are determined to impose it upon us, by hook or by crook, by whatever means necessary.</p>

			<p>Whether we want diversity or not it&rsquo;s being shoved down our throats.  Katrina refugees spread to the four corners of America, section 8 vouchers to move in suburbs, blockbusting, the disastrous subprime loan fiasco.  We need to fight back against the politicians who are doing this to us.  Form an organization and raise money.  The next time a city council member, the mayor or any other politician comes up with another way to force crime and mayhem in our neighborhoods then we fight back.  Find out where they live, rent a house in the neighborhood and pack it with as many Haitians, Somalians, Guatemalans, Mexicans, etc. as much as the square footage of the house will allow cots and sleeping bags.  Let them live there rent free. </p>

			<p>Diversity makes buying a house nerve wracking.  People don&rsquo;t live in their houses as long as they used to and a neighborhood could change very quickly in a few years.  Finding a house is alot more involved than it used to be.  I always check the demographic information and schools about an area then go to the Police Department and ask if they&rsquo;ve had any problems in the subdivision.  Then my wife and I take turns driving through the neighborhood on different days at different hours to see if we spot any &#8220;enrichment&#8221;.   </p>

			<p>Allow me to be blunt here folks.No white family in their right mind wants to live with the multicult in their neighborhood.They will steal from you,they will harass(or do worse)to your daughters.They will beat up(or do worse)to your sons.They will devalue your property.They will do everything in their power to make you regret you are living there.Then as in most cases you will move out.They win you lose.This scenario is being repeated all over this country every single day.Neighborhoods going down the toilet,schools going down the toilet,crime rates soaring,violent crimes soaring.I ask you folks how can America possibly survive this? The answer is,WE CAN&rsquo;T.With Americas&rsquo; &#8220;changing demographics&#8221;(the fall of the white race)This once great nation WILL fall.I don&rsquo;t want to leave you with a doomsday prophecy,however there is but one hope.That is the hope that some day the great euro-american culture will rise up and pull our nation from the brink.We have the power to do so if and only if we stand together and be proud of who we are.Teach your children the same.Strength in numbers.A nation devided cannot stand. Honest Abe said that just before he devided it! I pray we have the strength to withstand the coming storm.Like the man said &#8220;God help us all&#8221;</p>

<p>This is funny. I&rsquo;m a single female, aged 27, and I do that. I have to be careful about my safety. I drive around and if I see to much, as you say &#8220;enrichment&#8221; in the complex, I go somehwere else.<br>

			<p>&#8220;This conclusion appears to be a naively optimistic non sequitur. It could be simply that older Americans are familiar with the old attitudes in this country, whereas young Americans have had nothing but pro-diversity brainwashing. Therefore, as older Americans die out, the more realistic attitudes toward diversity will die out too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Come one guys.  Where do you find the energy to post this pessimistic garbage?  More and more people are obviously waking up.  The evidence is all over the internet. White people are using the internet as a way to vent.  How can true racially conscious whites NOT see this?  How do you have so little faith in your own people?  Obviously the more whites are around minorities, the more they become conscious, and you are irrational if you don&rsquo;t realize this.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we all go sit home and cry and just wait for the white race to disappear since there is nothing we can do about it?  This seems to be the way the pessimists on here want things to be.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been told that, in my area, it&rsquo;s illegal for a real estate broker to discuss demographics at all.  S/he cannot discuss the percentage of various ethnic groups, or comment on whether or not it&rsquo;s a &#8220;nice&#8221; neighborhood.  Of course the info is easily available elsewhere; however the legal gagging of a professional, on possibly the single most important aspect of his industry, is interesting, to say the least.</p>

			<p>I like Steve Sailer&rsquo;s explanation for white support for AA, diversity, multiculturalism, et cetera.  This support is status-mongering, not altruism; whites don&rsquo;t feel &#8220;white guilt,&#8221; that&rsquo;s for the other guy.  So basically they want the other guy to pay for AA, diversity, multiculturalism, they want the other guy to suffer from white guilt, etc.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a witch hunt; all anyone has to do to prove he&rsquo;s Catholic is kiss the Pope&rsquo;s ring and point out the scapegoat for burning, and he can go right back to his favorite sins.  Who cares if there really aren&rsquo;t any witches?</p>

			<p>The greatest contributors to multiculturalism are actually all of those white, blue collar Democrats who have been blindly voting for the party of massive immigration.  They are the ones who have kept the liberals in power for over thirty years.  When are they going to notice that their party is under the control of America-hating Marxists?  When are those morons going to wake up.</p>

			<p>Those pessimistic about the young should ask themselves if the 18-24 year old set was more liberal twenty years ago. It probably was. But then, twenty years later, they are now 38-44 and considerably more disillusioned with the &#8220;benefits&#8221; of &#8220;diversity&#8221;.</p>

			<p>DIVERSITY can be a wonderful thing. I remember the enclaves of Jews, Italians, Mexicans where you could go to enjoy their cultures and lifestyles but at night you would go home to Your Own People. In the work place we were all just American Workers. Today THIS FAUX DIVERSITY is shoved down our throats and every race and culture is treated as something special (with the exception of the one we all know) this is wearing pretty thin and is more than just an insult, it is something more sinister and evil than we know.</p>

<p>Yes, so do I. Steve is on the mark.   But WHO gave those qualities status?  WHO invested those terms with a glowing aura of virtue and better-than-thou superiority that makes people want to compete to earn them?</p>

			<p>To see the effects of media brainwashing you need only watch the Oprah talk show where the statistic that whites were becoming a minority was met by APPLAUSE from the whites in the audience. Thats right APPLAUDING their own demise.</p>

			<p>Notice the Blacks response. After 40 years of giveaways,<br>
preferential treatment, housing, college scholarships..they want whites to be demolished. And brother, when they get in charge dont expect the slightest interest in things like fairness in return. </p>

<p>I live in what used to be a predominantly white, liberal area.  Then, the coloreds started started showing up.  First the black one, then the brown ones.  Lo and behold, and these liberal whities that thought diversity was so wonderful MOVED when it started invading their neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Go figure&hellip;</p>

<p>Today (here in France) I saw an obviously Caucasian/Oriental woman, tall and blond but with strongly Oriental features, pushing a carriage with a wooly headed mulatto half-breed in it.  </p>
<p>Oops!  Make that triple-breed. Things are getting more and more bizarre here.  </p>
<p>And just moments before that I saw another white daddy pushing a non-white baby. This is the only place where you&rsquo;re likely to see that.<br>
