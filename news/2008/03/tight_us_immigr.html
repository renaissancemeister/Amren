						<p>US high-tech companies are being forced to outsource more jobs overseas because of outdated restrictions on immigration, Microsoft chairman Bill Gates told Congress Wednesday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Congress&rsquo;s failure to pass high-skilled immigration reform has exacerbated an already grave situation,&#8221; Gates said in remarks prepared for delivery to a hearing of the House of Representatives Science and Technology Committee.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a result, many US firms, including Microsoft, have been forced to locate staff in countries that welcome skilled foreign workers to do work that could otherwise have been done in the United States, if it were not for our counterproductive immigration policies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gates said the limits on so-called H-1B visas aimed at highly skilled professionals are far too low for the rapidly growing tech sector.</p>
<p>He said the current cap of 65,000 H-1B visas &#8220;is arbitrarily set and bears no relation to the US economy&rsquo;s demand for skilled professionals.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;If we increase the number of H-1B visas that are available to US companies, employment of US nationals would likely grow as well. For instance, Microsoft has found that for every H-1B hire we make, we add on average four additional employees to support them in various capacities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gates also said the United States needs to improve science and math education to train a new generation of tech leaders, reversing a move away from these fields.</p>

			<p>Gates simply wants more cheap labor imported to the US.  Offshoring will also continue apace.</p>

			<p>Either we have to import the cheap programming and coding labor, or the work is moved to where the cheap labor already is.  There is a third option, but unfortunately for Mr. Gates and Microsoft&rsquo;s ever-increasing profit margins, it involves hiring Americans and paying them substantial salaries.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Grave&hellip;counterproductive&hellip;arbitrary&#8221;, sez Bill.</p>
<p>What? 65,000 a year, every year, is not enough? Gimme a break.</p>
<p>How does ZERO sound to you, Bill? Yes, the number is arbitrary, and its arbitrarily way too high. Ask anyone who doesn&rsquo;t profit from immigrants, and you are likely to hear that even zero is too many. That be arbitrary enough for you? Works for me.</p>
<p>He said the current cap of 65,000 H-1B visas &ldquo;is arbitrarily set and bears no relation to the US economy&rsquo;s demand for skilled professionals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thats entirely correct. The economy doesn&rsquo;t determine immigration law. The economy is one tiny consideration in the big picture. And please don&rsquo;t flatter yourself by equating Microsoft&rsquo;s needs with the needs of the USA. 65,000 are allocated and I am sure you will get your fair share. That&rsquo;s your budget, live with it. Everyone else does.  </p>

			<p>In other words, if America was more like India and China or some other Asian ant-hill, we&rsquo;d keep more jobs in the country. </p>
<p>Wow! Thanks for the advice, pal.  </p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t stand Bill Gates. He&rsquo;s a parasite. Plain and simple. </p>
<p>In fact, his whole &#8220;philosophy of wealth&#8221; is literally parasitism. </p>
<p>He has said that the key to his success is his ability to &#8220;embrace and extend the ideas of others.&#8221; </p>
<p>Computers and the Internet were created by the government using OUR money and OUR intitiative. </p>
<p>And this is how he repays us.</p>
<p>If he&rsquo;s NOT a parasite, we better think about reclassifying tapeworms.</p>

<p>Oh yea Billy Bob&hellip;four minimum wage jobs serving food, ferrying people in Toyota Hybrids and sweeping up after hours!</p>
<p>I have worked in and around Microsoft for the last 21 years&hellip;what a crock of feces for a Billionaire to whine about not having enough coder/slaves to take further advantage of. I have had Indian national software developers tell me that Microsoft holds them hostage via their Green Cards and H1B renewals! BTW, the Federal Traitor Government holds all parties hostage with their HUGE initial and renewal fees for H1B work visas!</p>
<p>Here is another trend that rankles spoiled rich boy Billy Bob Gates&hellip;many Indian and Chinese S/W devs DO NOT want to come to the states anymore. In both India and Commie China, they are becoming the Noveau Riche with abundant salaries, affordable housing and elite status.</p>
<p>Gates was essentially forced out of Microsoft for his micro-managing megalomania and now he can only get the attention of the Marxist press with stupid, anti-America statements like these.</p>

			<p>This is a total lie.</p>
<p>What is true is that H1B visas are being used ILLEGALLY to force skilled american workers to accept ever lower wages or face unemployment.  Large numbers are either unemployed or underemployed (forced to accept lower level jobs they are WAY overqualified for).  The problem is particularly severe in the IT sector.</p>
<p>H1B visas have certain laws that apply to them.  These laws are being flagrantly broken but no one is going to jail over it.  Specifically, no H1B visa holder is allowed to take a job unless a qualified american worker is unable to be found to fill the position.  Further, it is ILLEGAL to pay the H1B visa holder less than what similar positions pay.  Both of these laws are broken in almost every instance an H1B visa holder is hired.  The problem is massive.  Often, a company will hire a third party to provide workers for them.  Usually, the entire company will have workers of only one race (usually from India).  People who are not Indian are not hired, no matter how many american citizens are looking for a job.  Entire companies have a 100% workforce of non-citizens while americans face massive unemployment.</p>
<p>Just to add insult to injury, these people cannot get the job done.  The truth about foreign technical labor is it is a scam.  Only a few months ago, there was literal rioting in India because the government there decided to enforce rules against cheating on college exams.  The students felt it was their right to cheat on those exams and used violence to get their way.  Needless to say, they are not actually qualified to do those jobs and their test scores mean nothing.  The results of hiring them reflect this as whole sections of companies go belly-up rather than admit they&rsquo;ve been scammed.  Quite literally, those outsourced jobs are downsized because of non-production.</p>
<p>What is behind this?  Liberals who outsource those jobs as a form of welfare.  The net result of making business decisions based on &#8220;social justice&#8221; instead of profit motives is the destruction of those businesses and a massive loss of high paying technical jobs.</p>
<p>At this point, fines and finger wagging won&rsquo;t cut it to make these people stop.  What is needed is stiff prison sentences and the outlawing of the complete outlawing of foreign labor.  Simply put, the entire H1B system needs to go.  It&rsquo;s a scam and always was.</p>

			<p>Hey there, BILL GATES&hellip; here&rsquo;s news for you! The AMERICAN PEOPLE don&rsquo;t want any more damned immigrant job thieves   &mdash;   from Pakistan, India, or anywhere else!</p>
<p>Why should American computer engineers, software engineers and other professional, semi-professional or even hourly workers be tossed asside so you can get a little richer with cheap immigrant labor. You want Americans to BUY your company&rsquo;s software   &mdash;   yet you cheerfully would screw them out of their jobs. You, sir are a damned lying hypocrite of the first magnitude!</p>

			<p>I cannot understand how any white American can admire Bill Gates.  His rise to riches is filled with manipulation, deceit, strongarm tactics, racketeering, and unending greed.  For all his &#8220;supposed brains,&#8221; he comes off real short on character and integrity.  He&rsquo;s not smarter than the next guy, he&rsquo;s ruthless.  Will someone please deport this self-serving race traitor to some East Indian ghetto on a reverse H-1B visa?  The man that ruined Lotus Development and WordPerfect Corporation, to name a few, with vastly inferior products and services isn&rsquo;t worth the space he fills!!!  And to think this is the type of white that is producing offspring?<br>

			<p>This is because whites share the same blood, values, and abilities,  integrating seamlessly into our community.  Non-whites don&rsquo;t.  Furthermore when whites immigrate here, settle on some land, take some jobs, and have some children, the net number of whites does not go down.  When a non-white does the same, the net number of whites does go down.  In terms of group preservation, white immigration is a healthy natural activity, non-white immigration is genocide.  What is so complicated?</p>

			<p><i>Gates also said the United States needs to improve science and math education to train a new generation of tech leaders, reversing a move away from these fields.</i></p>
<p>This is a clear case of schutzpa. </p>
<p>Gates and company are the ones to blame for prospective students moving away from these fields (like, for instance, computer science) because most of the well paying jobs there were sent abroad by Gates and his alikes, and now he insinuates that it is &#8220;tought&#8221; immigration policy that causes it and threatens that he will send even more jobs abroad if he can&rsquo;t hire enough immigrants.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like if a person tried for killing his parents pled mercy on a basis of being an orphant.</p>
<p>Bill Gates: you are one of those who co-engineered the current lack of interest in pursuing technical degreees among young Americans. If you think that you are so much smarter than everybody else (so that we don&rsquo;t see through your self-contradicting rhetoric), you should better figure out how to fix your brainchild (DOS and all Windows&rsquo;es that DOS spawned) so that a bunch of high school kids from a Third World country cannot penetrate its &#8220;hacker-proof&#8221; security.</p>

			<p>Rich moguls like Bill Gates love to complain about how we&rsquo;re not producing enough scientists and engineers.  Well, there&rsquo;s some truth to that.  Part of the reason is because our schools and media have been dumbed down for the diversity.  But the other big reason is that smart kids can see the handwriting on the wall.  They see they could spend 6 years getting their M.S. in electrical engineering and then simply lose out to some cheap H-1b import.</p>
<p>Provide a good salary and bring back defined benefit pensions and you&rsquo;ll have no problem attracting native born Americans.  Needless to say, that&rsquo;s the last thing the moguls want to do.<br>

<p>Posted by GetBackJack at 8:48 PM on March 12 </p>
<p>Actually, that&rsquo;s exactly why he IS SMARTER than the next guy! </p>
<p>This is something that I&rsquo;ve never understood about most supporters of this organization (AmRen): How in the world can people talk about &#8220;race traitors&#8221; when your average &#8220;White&#8221; person in the US is a self-hating, ill-dressed, brainwashed robot who doesn&rsquo;t care a jot for his race in the first place? In order to feel genuine loyalty towards something, first and foremost you need to RESPECT that something. And, no one will EVER come to respect something that doesn&rsquo;t even possess respect for ITSELF. This principle operates everywhere, both at the individual AND the group level   &mdash;   if you want people to respect you and maintain their loyalty, you should start by having respect for yourself! Hence, a race of human beings that doesn&rsquo;t possess self-respect will simply be incapable of maintaining &#8220;in-group&#8221; loyalty for any real length of time.</p>
<p>Formerly, White people in the United States had enormous respect for themselves. They were a very proud, confident people, and this manifested itself in countless ways, most importantly in the organization of their society and their individual behavior. And, due to this fact, the entire world respected them, and in all accuracy it was because they COMMANDED respect, not because they begged or pleaded for the rest of the world to respect them. Similarly, WITHIN their society, the elites also maintained their primary loyalty to their race to a much greater degree (think of all the &#8220;pro-White&#8221; presidents from the past), and undoubtedly one of the reasons for this was because if they hadn&rsquo;t, they already knew that they would be overwhelmed by an angry, self-confident citizenry that was actively involved in the affairs of the country. Now, your average White American is so culturally deracinated and without even the most elementary sense of self-respect, that it&rsquo;s no wonder that the dwindling class of White individuals who are highly intelligent are putting the interests of their race off the radar screen completely.</p>
<p>The reason that Bill Gates doesn&rsquo;t care about the state of his race is not because he&rsquo;s ignorant, diabolical, or unintelligent. No, it&rsquo;s because he is without any REASON to care. As I alluded to before, all throughout history, national and racial loyalty has been a &#8220;many-sided&#8221; situation, not a situation in which the elite of society simply &#8220;take care&#8221; of the rest of the common population out of sheer good-will or mindless favoritism. Each segment of the population has always done their part, and at bottom this is generated by an underlying desire to preserve their common identity which is the basis for stability, upward advancement, and SURVIVAL. But, as it has happened, White Americans are basically unable to maintain loyalty at the GROUP level anymore, because they have lost self-respect at numerous segments of society. Why should Bill Gates behave any differently towards a self-hating people that seems perfectly content to be wiped off the planet and is incapable of even SPEAKING ITS NAME?</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m certain that the unscrupulous hack, Bill Gates, could be replaced with some unscrupulous hack from India, who would do his job (bribing Congressmen and displacing American workers) for much less.  That would be one H-1B visa I&rsquo;d be willing to see granted.</p>
<p>David Bolingbroke (from a previous post) is quite right - Gates is - and always was - a parasite.  Microsoft didn&rsquo;t even write MS-DOS - their first big product.  Gates inked a deal with IBM to supply MS-DOS, knowing that he could buy it (for $50,000) from an unsuspecting programmer (without of course telling him the nature of the deal).</p>
<p>Microsoft has traditionally made its&rsquo; money, not by producing good products, but by producing the lousiest products they can get away with, and still retain a monopoly position.</p>
<p>Ever notice how every new Microsoft product is &#8220;like something else&#8221;.  People will say something like: &#8220;Have you tried the new version of Internet Explorer?  It&rsquo;s a lot better now.  It&rsquo;s more like Firefox.&#8221;  Why is that?</p>
<p>Gates got a building on the University of Washington Campus named after his mother, although he only ponied up 10 million out of the hundred million needed for the renovation.  And the new law college building is named for his father (who conveniently has the same name as Gates himself) - he probably only shelled out a fraction of that as well.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just another one of our new arrogant over-lord class, who apparently think that they are an entirely different species than the rest of us.  I think that history shall remember him far less fondly than it does the robber barons of old.</p>

			<p>The H-1 B visa program should be completely shut down. In general, LEGAL IMMIGRATION should be shut down to 0. Never fear a labor scaricity. I&rsquo;ve never met one I didn&rsquo;t like. Labor scarcities have always been a great benefit to Native Born White Americans. </p>

			<p>Bill Gates must suffer from severe &#8220;white guilt&#8221;, and of course greed.  The Bill and Melinda Gates foundation likes to throw millions of dollars, that were mostly earned from white people, at the poorest brown and black people of the world.  Of course these poor brown and black peoples&rsquo; conditions never really improve. If Bill Gates would like to truly make changes, he could insert himself in the American educational system.  One I am sure he has made plenty of money from.  He could fund training and proficiency in Microsoft from elementary school to college.  He could have his own little American army of Microsoft workers educated here in the United States.  Of course once these Americans were ready to work for Microsoft, they would expect a livable wage.  Makes too much sense, and when your as rich as Bill Gates, you don&rsquo;t have to make sense.  After all you can buy a lake and all the homes around you for privacy.  And of course you never have to deal with the brown people that you want to subject your fellow Americans to.</p>

			<p>I would caution everyone to start following the business reports, especially the Telegraph, because this visa and immigration business just might take care of itself.</p>
<p>With a crushed US economy, immigration will not only come to a halt, but many who have fled to this country will leave.<br>
  <br>
I&rsquo;m referring to a global economic meltdown that is presently at a stage far more critical than what the US media is reporting.  Whether or not we tip over into a situation similar to the Great Depression of the thirties is still open to question, because the big shot money handlers are scrambling around like panicked rats, but we are heading that way now if nothing they try works.</p>
<p>But, make no mistake about it, I&rsquo;m in no way looking forward to economic hard times, but at the same time I can&rsquo;t ignore the situation.  It doesn&rsquo;t look well at all for the world and, especially, the US.</p>

<p>Quite right.  I say we apply Gate&rsquo;s argument to his own business: Declare that there is a &#8220;shortage&#8221; of money available to buy Microsoft products, and pressure Congress to pass a law mandating that Microsoft sell them at below cost.</p>
<p>I would do just that, if I played golf with Congressmen, and schmoozed with all the other Wise and Powerful at Davos.  But of course, I don&rsquo;t.<br>

			<p>&#8220;If most of the immigrants were white, the white supremacists wouldn&rsquo;t be complaining about immigration one bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re admitting this immigration is racist? That it&rsquo;s mostly non-whites, moving into America? </p>
<p>Non-whites setting up their own communities inside of small and large towns in America, because they want to live among those like themselves? Setting up their own interest groups, voting for their own causes, promoting and getting in touch with aspects of their own race? I suppose when non-whites do this, and they are the only ones doing so, you must think this is only a natural expression of a vibrant culture, good for a special in the sunday paper, and if any of this happens to upset the &#8216;racial balance&rsquo; it&rsquo;s a small price to pay for what you consider harmony? Besides, it&rsquo;s only evil and racist, and only worth mentioning, if whites do any of that stuff. Or at least, if you can say they are. </p>

			<p>I listened to this pathetic exploiter and opportunist in an interview yesterday on NPR discussing this issue.  The man is a walking contradiction but dares anyone to oppose him.  He is opening a plant in Vancouver, BC where he can hire all the foreigners he wants.  He claims that our new restrictions forces him to do this.  Behind it was his contention that America does not produce enough engineers to fill his needs.  He also claimed that when foreign students graduate, they are now forced to leave the U.S.  Since they have many job offerings, they go where the deal is best.  The result he said, is that American looses even more jobs because these people create jobs around them.  So he is now opening a plant in Vancouver because the Canadian government lets American trained grads of any nationality move in with no problem.</p>
<p>To NPSs credit, they did have a panelist who cross examined him to some extent.  However, the final point made was that American is going to loose its edge because we have limits on how many foreigners can remain in the U.S. after finishing their education here.  Will we soon be told that they are here to do jobs Americans won&rsquo;t do?</p>
<p>Until we re-employ all those computer engineers that were laid off due to outsourcing, this argument is bogus.</p>
<p>The reality is that America with a population of only 300 million cannot employ the all world&rsquo;s engineers.  But there is no reason that our colleges, which are still (according to the interview I heard) the best in the world, should not make money from all of those nations educating their best.  It is scary to think that our intelligensia should be made up of foreigners who are only here because they can make great money.</p>
<p>Listening to Bill Gates make his case was like what I imagine it might have been like to listen to JP Morgan defend his monopolies while justifying poor working conditions for his employees.  The guy&rsquo;s just trying to make a buck!</p>

			<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if Microsoft had trouble hiring inside the US; everyone in the computer science field knows how they came to power and how they stay there. Why would anyone want to work for them?</p>

			<p>A few random comments:</p>
<p>1) Most of the billions that Bill made off of Microsoft that is going to charity is going to charitable endeavors overseas. Since Bill&rsquo;s not gunna hire people from here, and isn&rsquo;t going to spend his tax dollars here, what concern does the US have for Microsoft&rsquo;s success?</p>
<p>2) A few years ago Microsoft established a program in India to train tens of thousands of new programmers. Why haven&rsquo;t they done so in the US?</p>
<p>3) If Bill really wanted to increase the H1B numbers, which I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d disagree with, maybe what he should try to do is reduce the overall immigration numbers. I suspect Americans would be more sympathetic to more H1Bs if our total immigration was a lot lower.</p>
<p>4) Much of the overseas competition the US is facing in the tech industry, expecially in software and especially in India, is coming from foreign nationals who acquired skills in the US then returned home to open competing companies. Of the Silicon Valley startups founded by Indians, over half have outsourced work to India.</p>
<p>5) Many of the folks being brought over to the US are nothing more than cheap coders. Instead of all but giving these visas away let&rsquo;s BID THEM AWAY. If we gave out 65,000 a year and each was worth $50,000 (remember these are - allegedly - highly skilled workers) that would raise over $3.2 billion annually for the treasury. Not bad, no?</p>

			<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;If most of the immigrants were white, the white supremacists wouldn&rsquo;t be complaining about immigration one bit.</p>
<p>Good Point, White Liberal. Now lets look at what White immigrants (opposed to non-Whites) would mean to Americans:</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re much more likely to be distant kin or countrymen of OUR ancestors. They&rsquo;re more likely to blend seamlessly into our culture, our way of life.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re more likely not to have come from a culture (Mexico, for ONE example) where thievery and crime is generally winked at. Something you just turn to, when opportunity presents itself. If you want to get ahead.</p>
<p>That well-deserved reputation India (Hindus) have as the rape capital of the world. Or the Pakistani (Muslim) idea that White women not adhering to Islamic dress codes are common whores   &mdash;   to be raped and molested at will.</p>
<p>WhiteLiberal is welcome to post his phony rantings&hellip; but the counter-points I&rsquo;ve rebutted him/her/it with have been verified too many times. Including on that bastion of liberality, NPR RADIO!</p>
<p>The mentality of too many liberals is &#8220;do as I say, not as I do.&#8221; In short, I&rsquo;m not aware of too many White liberal professionals gladly relinquishing their jobs to Pandit, Kaleem or Wu   &mdash;   fresh off the airliner from Asia. No, thank you kindly, that&rsquo;s for the others to have to suffer&hellip; isn&rsquo;t that YOUR view, WhiteLiberal?</p>
<p>Nor, I would be willing to bet, do too many liberals have the house next door occupied by an extended family of illegal Mexican immigrants, or worse, by 20 illegal Mexican males sharing the rent. Both examples being far too prevalent in any city or town cursed with a heft Mexican subpopulation.</p>
<p>If you want our readers to agree with you, WhiteLiberal, you&rsquo;d do best by sticking to the TRUTH about immigration. What it really means to American people. The ugly DOWNSIDE of the picture. How Americans are displaced in the job market by cheaper working H1B visaholders on the one hand. How underskilled and/or undereducated Americans are forced out of the job market having to compete with the Mexican illegals. Note, please, many of them DO use fraudulent documents   &mdash;   so I&rsquo;ll spare you from having to  make the claim &#8220;illegals can&rsquo;t get jobs here.&#8221; A reality far too many of us are well aware of.</p>
<p>That immigrants DO commit crimes far out of proportion to their numbers has also been very well established. Crimes by Mexicans, for example. Crimes by Muslims   &mdash;   many of whom believe themselves to have ample reason to hate Americans. The social problems accompanying virtually ALL non-White immigrants. Another negative too well established by the actions and behavior of non-Whites in Europe, Australia, England (the British Isles are part of Europe), Canada and America.</p>
<p>But WhiteLiberal and all those like him would rather hide their heads in the proverbial sand, rather than admit the points I&rsquo;ve raised to be true. To be indeed real and extremely verifiable.</p>
<p>I concur fully with that old saw: &#8220;A liberal is only a liberal until he or one of his family has been mugged or raped.&#8221; (Rape to be construed also as &#8220;screwed&#8221; out of your job, as well as the proverbial sense.</p>
<p>Just wondering if WhiteLiberal actually has the intellectual ability to distinguish between &#8220;White Supremacists&#8221; and White people who just might have had damned good reason to feel righteous anger over endless immigration.</p>

			<p>Bill Gates is your typical liar who want nothing but cheap labor. Cost whatever it will to the American people!</p>
<p>Those stories aired on NPR   &mdash;   How so many Silicon Valley S/W and computer engineers were fired and replaced by Pakistanis and Indians. Gates, for all that pretense of &#8220;giving away&#8221; so much of his wealth   &mdash;   is stealing from the pockets of American people with the other hand. By taking THEIR jobs, their livelihood from Americans. Giving them the choice of working for greatly depressed wages or starving.</p>
<p>That picture holds true for so many corporations and business entities. Not stopping with just high salaried white-collar jobs and professional positions. Outsourcing   &mdash;   the sending of manufacturing and so many other jobs overseas   &mdash;   is just as reprehensible. A dastardly practice motivated solely by corporate greed.</p>
<p>The stories of how immigration truly does depress the wage structure have been aired all too often. Even on NPR Radio. If Bill Gates were really as altruistic as we are expected to believe, he&rsquo;d be the first to rail out AGAINST IMMIGRATION rather than demanding more slave labor to expand his personal fortune.</p>
<p>Something for ALL liberals to think about: Relations between America and China and/or North Korea have been quite strained at times. With our domestic manufacturing capability taken from Americans, what would happen if a real war broke out? We DO have a treaty guaranteeing America would come to the aid of Taiwan, should China attempt to forcibly bring Taiwan back into the fold. China&rsquo;s history of human rights abuses is legendary. As is the penchant for China to constantly indulge in espionage here in America   &mdash;   stealing both defense secrets and industrial processes and technologies.</p>
<p>Had Americans been so steeped in our current outsourcing culture at the start of World War II, Americans would either be REQUIRED to speak German or Japanese as our national language. But, as always, the liberals and the greedy capitalist crowd tend to ignore anything defined as an inconvenient truth.</p>

<p>St. Louis CofCC,</p>
<p>Thanks for that link.  Most interesting, and instructive.  We&rsquo;re often told, by the likes of Bill Gates and others, that America no longer produces programmers and computer technologists, because the people who used to do that now want to go into investment banking and the like.  But there were many I-banks on that list (amounting to hundreds of visas).  And, as you pointed out, accounting firms.  So, accounting is now one of the &#8220;Jobs that Americans won&rsquo;t do?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s another consideration.</p>
<p>Bill Gates wants all this cheap labor from H-1B visas to work for Microsoft, but he won&rsquo;t apply the same logic to his software products.  The retail box prices for its cash cows, Windows and Office, are higher than ever.  Even though most people and businesses that have Windows and/or Office didn&rsquo;t get them buy purchasing a retail box, the OEMs of their computers installed and pre-loaded them, and paid Microsoft for the privilege, I&rsquo;m sure that Microsoft&rsquo;s license fees for OEMs haven&rsquo;t gone down either, based on the near-monopolistic ecosystems of Windows/Office, and the popular presumption that everybody who&rsquo;s anybody that wants to accomplish more than walking and chewing gum at the same time needs at least Windows and probably also Office.</p>
<p>Though one can scroll up in this very thread to see one of my posts under my old nickname that shows that the popular presumption isn&rsquo;t true for everyone.</p>
