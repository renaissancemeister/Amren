						<p>Low graduation rates in Palm Beach County show the school district has failed its students, especially minority children, by not providing a &#8220;uniform, efficient, safe, secure and high-quality education,&#8221; according to a lawsuit filed Tuesday by the American Civil Liberties Union.</p>
<p>The lawsuit addresses a topic never before challenged in the courts. The ACLU and other organizations have sued school districts for not distributing resources equally, but no group has pursued legal action for dismal graduation rates.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re really making a more basic point,&#8221; said Chris Hansen, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU. &#8220;Graduating from high school is virtually the minimum requirement for success. A large percentage of the students are being essentially written off.&#8221;</p>
<p>The suit alleges that the district is violating students&rsquo; rights to a high-quality education as outlined in the state constitution.</p>
<p>According to state calculations, 71.8 percent of students across the county graduated on time last school year, up from 66 percent in 2003 but slightly below the state average.</p>
<p>The rate is higher than five of the other six largest &#8220;urban&#8221; school districts in the state, including Miami-Dade and Broward counties. Only Hillsborough County, at 79.1 percent, had a higher rate.</p>
<p>But the graduation rates drop off among the county&rsquo;s black and Hispanic students. While more than 80 percent of white students graduated on time in the county last year, only about 55 percent of black students and 64 percent of Hispanic kids did, according to state statistics.</p>
<p>The percentages may actually be slightly higher. School district officials initially submitted incorrect student information to the state, but the error has since been corrected. The district&rsquo;s total graduation rate increased from 71.4 percent to 71.8 percent in the correction, but the rates among particular races were not available Tuesday.</p>
<p>The three high schools with the highest percentage of black students &mdash; Palm Beach Lakes, Glades Central and Boynton Beach &mdash; also had the three lowest graduation rates in the county last year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The suit calls for the school district to improve the graduation rates among students in every racial group, students who qualify for the school lunch program and English-language learners. It also calls for the school district to adopt a more-accurate method for calculating graduation rates.<br>

					<p>If the government had a spine, this suit is a dream come true, because it would allow them to prove conclusively that non-whites, especially blacks, do not have the mental level to compete with whites.</p>
<p>And if they don&rsquo;t have the capacity to learn on a first world level, there&rsquo;s nothing the school can do to improve on that.</p>
<p>But the defenders of this suit are PC advocates themselves who pretend as if all these test scores, please a wealth of common experience, prove nothing.  By doing that they have made themselves perfect defendants in a case where the plaintiff only has to prove a disparity of outcome.  Their chickens have come home to roost.</p>
<p>Personally, I hope the <span class="caps">ACLU </span>wins, and I hope more white parents initiate causes of action against school districts every time they see that their kids are being picked on and everytime they experience some injustice due to the school&rsquo;s pursuit of political correctness.</p>
<p>Hopefully, the entire public school system will collapse and people will have to return to neighborhood school houses, financed by the citizens of the area, free of all public control.</p>

					<p>The answer is easy.  Just give every black student a diploma as a civil right and a privilege of his or her reaching his 18th birthday, in case s/he isn&rsquo;t able to flop over the low bar that is secondary public education these days.  The standards have been dumbed down this far, why not dumb then down even further.</p>

<p>Translation:  Higher property taxes from mostly whites and lower lifetime standards for our children so the minorities can graduate from dumbed-down schools.  One day Mr. Hansen, you and your nosy, arrogant comrades will be tried in our courts under our rules and you will pay for your crimes. </p>

					<p>Can you actually sue an educational establishment if the students don&rsquo;t want to learn? Stay tuned for the next bizzaro action of the <span class="caps">ACLU.</span> Why is it that the ancient Greeks for example, taught students sitting on the grass and writing in the sand and produced geniuses? Computers, calculaters, and other modern electronic devises are useless without the basic knowledge one needs to understand what is being done by those devises.</p>
<p>It reminds me of a story I read about ten years ago, how the 90 year old physicist and Nobel laureate, Hans Bethe, discovered a mistake in a calculation done by a group of scientists using a computer. The interesting thing was, that Bethe discovered the error using his slide rule. Now that&rsquo;s understanding your field.</p>

					<p>The only way to increase the graduation rate for black and hispanic students is to lower the standards for all of the students,but doing that will have the effect of raising the graduation rate for whites and asians.I wonder how that would sit with the <span class="caps">ACLU</span>? Would they sue to lower the graduation rate for whites and asians?</p>

					<p>Translation: they want the school system to dumb down yet again, to lower the bar yet again, so that blacks can graduate.  I fail to see how it is the school systems fault if the blacks won&rsquo;t study and apply themselves and if their parents won&rsquo;t make them.  Seems it&rsquo;s just another example of blacks not taking responsibility for their actions and instead passing the blame onto whitey.  <span class="caps">IMO </span>the school system should sue all the parents of those failed kids for not making them study and do their school work and require they pass.</p>

					<p>My school was probably 40% minority, and I can absolutely assure the blinded eyes of the <span class="caps">ACLU </span>that it was these very people that prohibited a &ldquo;uniform, efficient, safe, secure and high-quality education&rdquo; from the rest of us.  </p>
<p>Why is it that they&rsquo;re rewarding these people for terrorizing the rest of us?  Shouldn&rsquo;t they be sticking up for those of us they robbed of a high-quality education?</p>
<p>How in the world do they feel they are justified?</p>

					<p>The majority of these minorities are born to mothers under the age of 18, with an absent father.  Most are daily witnesses to violence, and drug abuse.   The welfare system works its magic, and these kids grow up with no hope, and no respect for anything that&rsquo;s right or normal.  They never have a chance.  The <span class="caps">ACLU </span>should be suing the government for subsidizing these dysfunctional families.  Think about the lives these kids live.  Who could do well in school?  </p>

					<p>  The <span class="caps">ACLU </span>is defending Communist Teachings that everyone is absolutely equal as demanded by the pc codes.  Equality could not be forced or made to exist by the state in the Soviet Union and the Communists had sense enough to stop trying to enforce equal results. They did try to distribute the extra production but the system changed to &#8220;we pretend to work and the Communist Commissars pretend to pay us&#8221;.<br>
   People are not the same. The cheerleaders for Diversity cannot understand that diversity means differences and differences mean different outcomes.  Their world view requires sameness of results but they cannot see that diversity will always mean that the results are diverse, that means <span class="caps">NOT </span>the same for all you PC supporters.</p>

					<p>This is nuts!  A high school diploma is &#8220;the minimum necessary&#8221; for success?  then what the h*ll are we doing letting in 20 million Mexican illegals?  Over 90% of them have no high school diploma. I would guess that over 75% of them are incapable of reading or writing English, and over 50% of them cannot even read and write Spanish.</p>
<p>And they are not a success?  They have &#8220;successfully&#8221; taken millions of jobs from Americans in construction, in food processing, in food services and in hotel services.</p>
<p>Yet they are not a &#8220;success&#8221;? What the h*ll measure of &#8220;success&#8221; is the <span class="caps">ACLU </span>using? Because if success means a high school diploma at an absolute minimum, then we need to send at least 18 million of these people back home to Mexico, where a high school diploma is not needed for &#8220;success&#8221;. </p>

					<p>This certainly stands the concept of education on its head. An education is not a thing that one either receives or doesn&rsquo;t. It is a process, a mutual give and take of information and knowledge - and the retention and absorbtion thereof. The school merely provides the materials, the instruction, the metrics, etc&hellip;but the real responsibility is and always has been upon the student and those who are directly responsible for the student(parent, guardian, etc.) <br>
A school is no more responsible for willful student failures than police officers are for crime! The fact that it is widely known that &#8220;African-American&#8221; culture has largely rejected acedemic standrds as &#8220;White man&rsquo;s rules&#8221; or some such, this case should embarassingly easy to dismiss. Of course knowing the American court system&hellip;  </p>

					<p>This is the second article (in a row) showing the <span class="caps">ACLU </span>going off the deep end. </p>
<p>In the 1988 election, Michael Dukakis was criticized as being &#8220;a card-carrying member of the <span class="caps">ACLU.</span>&#8221; As an insult, I think that would hit a lot harder now than it did then.</p>

					<p>I think the ultimate outcome of this is that the school district will &#8216;redefine&rsquo; what it takes to graduate, and viola&rsquo; the graduation rate will miraculously reach the level the lawsuit demanded.  What is missed, of course, is that the students will know next to nothing.  </p>

					<p>I&rsquo;m white, grew up in a poor area, had a broken family, lived in projects, had a drug/alcohol abusing mother and father, and went to a mostly black school.  I never had to try, at all, to do well in that school.  I didn&rsquo;t receive any encouragement from anybody to do well.  Basically, I&rsquo;m a white guy who grew up in a black world.  I&rsquo;m now about to finish my masters in computer science, have five+ years work experience, money invested, and live in a great area.  Having an awful background, similar to many blacks, I just don&rsquo;t have compassion for people who sit around and complain and blame their problems on others.

					<p>If 55% of blacks graduated&hellip;that means one needs an IQ of about 88 to graduate from High School.</p>
<p>And we force kids to spend a third of their lives there.</p>

					<p>There were many things I wanted to say about this thread, but  I think Oberweis at 11:41 summed it up.  That&rsquo;s the way I grew up as well, one of six kids in a school of about 1200 black kids.<br>
I was torture, it was child abuse.  You know what? I&rsquo;m just fine now.  </p>

					<p>Perhaps the <span class="caps">ACLU </span>needs to examine the Kansas City Missouri School District. All the predominately black schoolboard here can do is fight among themselves and fire school superintendants. It&rsquo;s such a joy living in the black murder capital of the United States. We even have to have armed guards at the inner-city schools to keep the students from killing each other and those trying to teach them.</p>

					<p>I do teach in a &#8220;diverse&#8221; classroom environment. About 30% of the kids want to learn. About 50% will tolerate it. The other 20% come to class every day with the intention of raising hell. they do everything that they can to make sure that no one else learns anything. They cannot be thrown out of class simply for disrupting. They cannot be sent to the office unless they do something more serious than &#8220;just&#8221; disrupting class. They run around the room, shout at one another, tear the covers off of books, and throw things at one another. The 30% of students that want to learn, manage to block them out enough to learn the material pretty well. The 50%, the ambivalent group, are lost. They either cannot block out the chaos, or they get caught up in the &#8220;fun&#8221;. Can you guess the ethnic background of the troublemakers? </p>
<p>At my school, they (administrators) whine incessantly about the low testing scores, and  they ride the staff hard, insisting that we somehow bring the scores up. They impose program after program, and plan after plan to &#8220;bring the testing scores up&#8221;  &mdash;   all of this on the backs of the already overwrought teachers.</p>
<p>Well, I have put in for a transfer to a less diverse school on the other side of town  &mdash;   I love to teach, but I am tired of going home pissed off and defeated every day. (thank God spring break in in two days)</p>

					<p>Fear not <span class="caps">ACLU.</span> If any of these minority students do graduate and then go on to earn a &#8216;college degree&rsquo;, they&rsquo;ll be pick number one at every whites-need-not-apply building in the nation, which is pretty much most of them.

					<p>&#8220;They could be opening up a can of worms they don&rsquo;t want opened. No telling what a smart lawyer could come up with in defense of the school district. Interesting case.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes. The district can probably show remediary tutors, mentors, and after school study help for minority children. An Afrocentric curiculum, or Latin one, whichever the case may be, complete with celebrating all the appropriate holidays from the home country, to get the students involved. Violence and harassment complaints much higher actually among the sparse white population, even though there&rsquo;s no official channel for them to complain - for the oppressor can never really be a &#8216;victim&rsquo;. Think about it. Multiple &#8216;Minority&rsquo; student groups active on campus. Racial pride days. &#8216;Diversity days&rsquo; at school too. And much teaching about the overwhelming importance of diversity, multiculturalism, respect and tolerance - the importance of tolerance toward people of color, that is. </p>
<p>Yes, <span class="caps">ACLU </span>might lose. Though a legal case really probably would prove embarrassing for &#8216;Palm Beach County&rsquo;, there is at least a fair chance they might get off.  <br>

					<p>This has to be a winner for the schools for there are documented statistics where the black only colleges have traditionally and still do have low pass rates.  If the facts are well presented the Court may insist that the black students and Hispanic students are taught in separate schools in an attempt to solve the &#8220;problem&#8221;.  No more complaints except when those students still fail perhaps.  Who then to blame? </p>
<p>The other thing is for them to learn through the New Afrikan Republic College.  I have just found this.  It is a joke surely?</p>
<p>This is one case that <span class="caps">AMREN </span>readers would subscribe to with small cash donations to support the schools legal team and get the facts out into the  open at last. </p>

					<p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned this before. I went to HS in Los Angeles in the early 1980&rsquo;s. The school I went to was &#8220;majority-minority&#8221; - whites were the minority. This gave everyone a good look at what was going among different ethnic groups. The blacks and hispanics generally were horrible students and troublemakers. Violent. The hispanics actually did worse in school and dropped out a higher rate than blacks, just like they do now. The Asian kids for the most part would go home and do homework and study for several hours after school. Almost every Asian kid I was friends with would have to study at home like this, their parents making sure this was priority. There were a few Jewish kids and they were the same way. The white kids were a mix, some would study, some would goof off, but they weren&rsquo;t violent or predatory like the blacks or hispanics. We had 7 valedictorians in my graduating class, 2 Asians and 5 whites (1 of the white kids was a Jewish guy and another was a Mormon girl if anyone is keeping count). No blacks or latinos even in the running. This is a reflection of cultures and genes. No matter what is done with blacks and &#8220;non-white&#8221; hispanics, they are not going to succeed in school. It is not in their make-up and is not in their &#8220;cultures&#8221; at all.  Whites can certainly do better if made to focus like Asians as has been shown by different cultures and countries. Lots of bright whites are marginalized, ignored or bored in school. I know I was. I had the highest <span class="caps">SAT </span>score in the school (1570 - 800 math) but was middling grade wise because I was bored and always felt like something was &#8216;wrong&rsquo;. We are now all seeing what was and is wrong.  </p>

					<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Low graduation rates in Palm Beach County show the school district has failed its students, especially minority children, by not providing a &ldquo;uniform, efficient, safe, secure and high-quality education,&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="caps">BUT.</span> . . since these schools have a predominantly <span class="caps">BLACK </span>(Afro-American) student body, you simply can&rsquo;t have a &#8220;uniform, efficient, safe, secure and high-quality education&#8221;! A contradiction in terms, if you will.</p>

					<p>I believe Wash. DC spends $15k-$17k/yr. per student, the highest in the country. yet the test scores and graduatiuon rates are among the lowest. Sooner or later folks like the <span class="caps">ACLU </span>will come to the conclusion that there is no amount of money you can throw at Blacks that will make them &#8220;white&#8221;. It will probably be later though, even after 40 years, we&rsquo;re throwing more money than ever!</p>

					<p>Surely by this point in time the liberals who run all the schools have figured out somewhere in this country, <span class="caps">SOMEWHERE, </span>where blacks  and hispanics can keep up with asians and whites. Somewhere, and not some upper middle class school that cherrypicks the wealthiest students. Where is this successful schools or a school????? Where ???? Why not offer a reward to a school that educates hispanics and blacks to asian and white levels???? Where is Bill Gates??</p>
<p>Didnt the university system just assess that Hispanics will be dumbing down the educational levels because they wont be attending college? How can the leftwing university system do that? How can they predict that <span class="caps">HISPANICS </span>as a racial group will not attend college?? The hypocracy trancends lunacy.</p>

2. do not study<br><br>
3. have parents who do not care<br><br>

					<p>Correct me if I am wrong, but isn&rsquo;t the graduation rate for blacks and hispanics about 50% nationwide (and even lower globally)?  So why in the world would this be a &#8216;problem&rsquo; only in Palm Beach county and within their school district?  How ignorant does one have to be to not realize its a much bigger cultural or racial/ethnic issue?  Just out of curiosity, what is the graduation rate in Haiti (biggest black population in the western hemisphere)? How about Africa? Is the Palm Beach county school district to blame for the poverty in those places too? I went to a HS that was 70% black/15% hispanic and the crime &amp; violence there was significant.  These problems cannot be fixed unless and until peeps realize and admit what the <span class="caps">REAL </span>problem is - sadly the <span class="caps">ACLU </span>clearly does not.</p>
