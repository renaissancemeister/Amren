<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>For overseas students, a U.S. college education has suddenly gotten much cheaper &mdash; and many more are applying to study here.</p>
<p>University of Washington officials say the number of foreigners applying to be freshmen this fall is up a whopping 40 percent.</p>
<p>And the UW is not alone: Foreign applications are up 32 percent at Washington State University. Across the 10-campus University of California system, foreign freshman applications are up 25 percent this year and 50 percent over the past two years.</p>
<p>The tumbling dollar, experts say, is one factor.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nearly 2,200 people from outside the U.S. have applied to be freshmen at the UW next fall, along with another 7,500 from other states. They are part of a record year in which almost 20,000 people have applied for 5,500 slots. Total UW freshman applications are up 12 percent.</p>
<p>But unlike many colleges, the UW limits students from other states and other countries to 20 percent of its freshman class. Consequently, those slots are becoming ever more competitive.</p>
<p>At Seattle University, foreign freshman applications are up 16 percent this year, to 304. Like many private schools, Seattle U. doesn&rsquo;t charge a different rate for out-of-state or foreign students or limit their numbers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Interest from abroad</b></p>
<p>Jasmeet Singh, president of the UW&rsquo;s Indian Student Association, said her e-mail box has been flooded this year with questions from India. Prospective students want to know about where they might live, the social scene and academic life.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>More diversity</b></p>
<p>Philip Ballinger, the UW&rsquo;s director of admissions, said foreign students add a &#8220;wonderful diversity&#8221; to campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;All our students are richer for it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The best thing is that it all happens unconsciously, often during fun, extracurricular activity.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>China leads the way</b></p>
<p>Perhaps most striking in the numbers is the demand from China. At WSU, freshman applications from China are up more than tenfold in the past three years, and China has now topped South Korea for the most international applications there. The UW has received nearly three times as many applicants from China this year as from any other foreign country.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But while many colleges are welcoming the increase in international interest, Green said, some are becoming more dependent on foreign students &mdash; and the big tuition dollars they bring &mdash; to balance the budget.</p>

					<p>&#8221; foreigners applying to be freshman up a whopping 40%&#8221;<br/>
 I  once saw a regular customer  throwing away a full  five minute old drink. Thinking there must be something wrong I quickly told him I`d get him a new one. He told me in reply that he really didn`t imbibe at all, he was merely ordering drinks to have a chance to hit on the cocktail waitress.<br/><br/>
 In a similar vein I don`t think the foreigners are scrambling for a College education at all. I think they view admission to a University merely as a renewable four year visa to get entrenched in this country. The education is merely a side benefit to getting in and staying in&hellip;</p>

					<p>We have seen this before. Remember when Iranians over-ran our colleges and we buddied up to them, only to have them turn on us?  Well it is going to happen again but with different countries, some of whom want to destroy us like China!  And watch the stupid American government just grab at every opportunity to get money to feed their greed while selling out the country, in which sooner or later middle and lower class men and women will be asked to give their lives &#8220;for&#8221; their country even though they could not afford to go to college like the masses of foreigners running around enjoying the freedom purchased with American life and blood. If thee was ever a time for a &#8220;house cleaning&#8221; in <span class="caps">DC, </span>it is <span class="caps">NOW</span>!</p>

					<p>Where international students, like <span class="caps">U.S. </span>students, are indoctrinated with all the relentless leftwing hate-whitey hate-the-West Marxist propaganda. So this vile hate-filled destructive leftwing ideology is spread internationally.</p>
<p>Leftwing campus indoctrination is <span class="caps">DEADLY.</span> Some of the world&rsquo;s worst mass-murderers were indoctrinated in Marxist hate at quite prestigious Western leftwing universities. Pol Pot was brainwashed in Marxist ideology at the Sorbonne in France: He went back to his country of Cambodia, formed the Khmer Rouge, over threw the government, and proceeded to form his Marxist &#8220;paradise&#8221;, murdering 3 million of his countrymen in the process.<br/>
And the Left wants to protest the &#8220;School of the Americas&#8221; in Fort Benning <span class="caps">GA, </span>because a very few of the graduates became tin-pot dictators back home?</p>

					<p>GW Bush has stated more than a few times that he wants more foreign students to attend US universities.  This &#8220;crowding out effect&#8221; makes it more difficult for young Americans to attend college so perhaps they will join the military to fight in the Middle East for the benefit of some barbaric Muslim tribes and the oil companies.</p>
<p>A few years later the Chinese kid will have a degree, and obtain a good job.</p>
<p>The American kid comes home without a limb, will have no degree, and it will be difficult for him to find a job. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you love being in a nation that is led by a neo-conservative, post-nationalist president???</p>

					<p>The problem is <span class="caps">NOT </span>foreigners who seek admission to US universities.  The problem is the US universities.  Yes, they can provide terrific education in math and science and engineering to anyone, Americans and all others who are qualified.  But with affirmative action, some American enrollees are <span class="caps">NOT </span>qualified.  And the liberal arts and social sciences have become ideological propaganda departments.  Often, the foreigners avoid such nonsense.  The trouble is that too often American natives are required to attend the courses that are simply duller versions of Rev. Wright, hate-whitey  sermons.  Too bad, more academic lectures are not taped, we might compare them with Rev. Wright and Farrakhan.  The problem is not the intellectual foreigners who love America and want to come here.  The problem is the hate-America academics and Affirmative Action that precludes most Americans from acquiring a decent education.  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  HM</p>

					<p>This is something that should really get more attention.  Lots of desirable positions are being taken by foreigners now.  Go to a medical school or other professional program which will give its graduates the skills they need to earn the money to comfortably raise a family on one income and you will find lots of Asians and Middle Easterners.  That just means it&rsquo;s that much harder for our kids to get into those programs.  This benefits us how?</p>
<p>We white Americans, even racially aware ones, are so bound to the idea of meritocracy that we don&rsquo;t see this.  Even racialist complain about low-IQ immigrants and ignore Asians, but it&rsquo;ll be Harold and Kumar&rsquo;s kid competing for my kid for a job, not Jose&rsquo;s and Ra&rsquo;Kanda&rsquo;s kids.  Yeah, affirmative action takes some slots away, but not nearly as many as all-work-and-no-play Asian kids who have been polishing their applications since they were in diapers.<br/>

					<p>Skipper, above, it is the foolish American, who goes and fights a war for the Bankers, that is to blame. </p>
<p>He is stupid to die for &#8220;god&#8221; and &#8220;country&#8221; when he should stay home and love his family <span class="caps">FIRST AND ONLY.</span> Like I did and have taught my children.</p>
<p>All wars are fought for the greed of the leaders and all wars since 1815 have been planned.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just blame &#8220;neo-conservatives&#8221;, ect. since it was Democrats who got us into World War 1  (Wilson),  World War 2 (Roosevelt) and Vietnam  (Kennedy).  And good ol&rsquo; Republicans got us into Iraq and Korea.</p>
<p>Notice how we are always in a constant state of &#8220;war&#8221;? It is a great business and the fools are those who join.</p>

Trying to stem the flow of Indian students out of the country along with that some 13 billion dollars that the sudents spending abroad.

					<p>The Bush&rsquo;s, the Klintons, the Obamas and Osamas are all on the same page of music. Destroy white America so it will be a third world country like the others around it and then it will be easier for the rich thugs like they are to control everyone. Gun control, mind control, fuel control, people control, rape with taxes, lie, mislead, dumb down is all necessary for them to secure their little nests in the global market. And we sit around watching it!  Knowing that we are getting the shaft and doing nothing about it!</p>

					<p>Can we please go about these discussions without dishonoring what our soldiers are doing in Iraq?  Someone&rsquo;s mother or wife might be reading these comments.  Most of the soldiers who have died in any US war have been white men.  Please don&rsquo;t spit in their faces like many of you do.  Keep the war out of these   discussions.  It really isn&rsquo;t necessary to bring it up.</p>

<p>These are good points, but let&rsquo;s remember that Indians and Middle Easterners as a whole are not high IQed people in any sense like so-called East Asians are.  We are just somehow getting the cream of the crop from those areas (India especially but from the Middle East only to a certain degree).</p>
