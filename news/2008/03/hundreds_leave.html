						<p>Prince William County&lsquo;s crackdown [in Virginia] on illegal immigration could be having a chilling effect in some of the local schools.</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly is an anomaly that we would have a little more than 600 fewer students in the ESOL (English Speakers of Other Languages)program than what we had at the beginning of the year,&#8221; says Prince William County school spokesman Ken Blackstone.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many of the students who left the school system left after the county&rsquo;s crackdown on illegal immigrants started March 3. No illegal immigrants have been arrested on felony warrants since the crackdown began.</p>

			<p>I was just listening to some commercial on thne Radio for an investment firm. You know the people who manage your 401k.They mentioned A DWINDLING WORKFORCE.Are the people on Wallstreet concerned that the racist bigotted proles who are driveing illegal aliens out of the country might affect their stock porfolios.</p>

			<p>Please explain to me how the apparent loss of 600 students, who do not speak English, can have a &#8220;chilling&#8221; effect on the local school system? By my understanding, the disappearance of thousands or millions of illegal aliens and their families would have virtually no adverse impact on public schools in this country. </p>
<p>Perhaps the article is written from the standpoint of the ESOL teachers who are no longer needed in a program that has 600 fewer participants. Were there no ESOL program at any school in America, it would not have a &#8220;chilling effect&#8221; on public schools. There would be less crowding, less traffic, fewer buses, less violence, and less costs for local schools. We need this. Maybe the article means we can all &#8220;chill out&#8221; since there are fewer invaders in that particular county.</p>

			<p>I live in that area. I just saw this on the news and the funny part about it was that they were reporting as this was a BIG mystery as to where all of these kids went? They didn&rsquo;t draw the line that these kids are &#8220;missing&#8221; because their criminal parents ran and cowardly hid because &#8220;the man&#8221; is finally decided to do something about them. The media is so biased that it&rsquo;s sickening&hellip;. Thank GOD we have outlets like American Renaissance and the internet for all of us to go to&hellip;. May not be that way too much longer&hellip; </p>

			<p>It is unbelievable that the American citzizen had to wonder if the &#8220;illegal aliens&#8221; are going home. I mean, look at how utterly powerless Americans are that we have to depend on the illegal aliens or LA RAZA to decide when THEY have had enough of being here ILLEGALLY!! In truth, we should be ashamed of ourselves.</p>

			<p>This goes to show what happens when the massive federal government falls down on the job. States&rsquo; rights get trampled, the system gets raped, and sooner or later the people decide to stand up and be counted or roll over and ask for more. This county obviously decided to stand up and be counted, and to its&rsquo; benefit - how&rsquo;s this for alleviating school overcrowding? And now perhaps they can scale back on bi-lingual staff and get back to the language all the Italian, Irish, Swedish, Welsh, French, German, Hungarian, Russian&hellip;.heritage students have been brought up speaking - ENGLISH.</p>

			<p>Memphomaniac, the chilling effect is because of loss of federal money (taxes we pay), the more students, the more federal funds. As to any thought of these criminals returning to Mexico, not likely, they are not wanted there, an overwhelming burden on the dysfunctional Mexican government, they have already resettled in another area of U.S., they were directed to another area and are now busy signing up fo the social programs in that area, entering their non-english speaking offspring in schools and becoming a huge burden to the taxpayers in the new location.</p>

			<p>The disappearing ESOL students and their families are NOT going back to Mexico. They are simply moving to more friendly states. Those states that fail to pass laws against employing illegal aliens and giving them social service benefits will soon find themselves overwhelmed by illegals as the other states crack down on them. I live in a state with a very left wing Governor <br>
(Wisconsin) and I can&rsquo;t wait until the next election. I am sure he will be voted out of office because of his support for illegals and his tax and spend economic policies.</p>

<p>If it&rsquo;s chilling to &#8220;them,&#8221; it&rsquo;s warming to &#8220;us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Think of the health benefits to Whites when they leave. As a friend of mine says, &#8220;Build those muscles and lose that spare weight. Stand up straight. Your skin is your uniform WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT. Make sure your appearance is always neat and clean.&#8221;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll have to cut their own grass and landscaping; they&rsquo;ll have to clean their own houses; while doing so, they might actually get to know their neighbors and re-establish a sense of White community.</p>

			<p>Yes, the illegals are merely moving to other counties, other states, and sanctuary cities.</p>
<p>However, what we are seeing is merely the opening round.  As these other counties and states are overwhelmed by illegal aliens, they will also crack down, leaving the criminal invaders fewer places to run.  It will be a process much like a game of &#8220;Musical Chairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>The final holdouts will be the sanctuary cities, which will see a massive, white flight during this process.  The sanctuary cities themselves will see an accelerating decline in their tax revenues and livability as this happens. </p>
<p>When Civil War Two kicks off, it will begin in a sanctuary city with a summer of non-stop riots.<br>

			<p>The probability that the illegals leaving Prince William county will simply relocate to less diligent areas of the US is, in the long run, likely to ultimately speed up the self-deportation of illegals out of this country. </p>
<p>Why? Because as each state passes anti-illegal laws there will be fewer and fewer places for illegals to go, and more and more of them will migrate to these fewer and fewer places - and the pressure of that successively greater build-up of illegals will speed up passage of anti-illegal laws in those places.</p>
<p>I predict that this action-reaction dymanic will eliminate all forms of sanctuary in any state within two years.</p>

<p>Well abc, I read my post several times. I am sure I did not say the illegal aliens were returning to mexico, nor does this article. Since that is the case, the Federal dollars you lament are still being spent, they just end up in another school district. Don&rsquo;t worry.</p>
<p>If we eliminate havens and sanctuaries, school district by school district, county by county, and state by state&hellip;..at some point the silly parasites will have fewer and fewer places left to go. That is what I call progress. Dry up the pond and watch how many fish collect in the few puddles that remain.<br>

			<p>I think there is something at work here that most people don&rsquo;t realize, Mexico does not want these people back, it would probably be more difficult for them to go back to Mexico than it was to come to America, it shold be evident by now that the Mexican government has a lot to do w/their ability to come here. But, not to worry, Nancy Pelosi and her team are working feverishly, along w/LaRaza and others, to pass an amnesty bill.</p>

			<p>I once taught ESL (the fore-runner of TESOl, now ESOL) in the 1980&rsquo;s thinking I was &#8216;helping foreigners adjust to live in the USA.&rsquo; I know now that the vast majority of those ESL/[T]ESOL colleagues I knew, WANTED unrestrained immigration, merely to ENSURE THEIR VIABILITY for the next twenty/thirty years, in their cushy jobs at state-funded institutions!</p>

			<p>Fr John, you hit the nail. That IS what it so often is about. The viability as you say, of government cubicle worker job security. People who produce nothing but are dependent on those that do for their pay. If people would read the statistics as to how many people in this nation already earn their livelihood, working at a city, county, State, or Federal government job or a job dependent on these entities, they&rsquo;d be shocked. It is approaching half the population of the nation, believe it or not.</p>
