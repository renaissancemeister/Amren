						<p>PORTLAOISE, Ireland &mdash; As revelers worldwide celebrate St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day with a pint of Guinness, dyed-green milk or visions of red-bearded leprechauns, it&rsquo;s a good bet that few of them will have Rotimi Adebari in mind.</p>
<p>But, for those seeking an authentic vision of today&rsquo;s Ireland, perhaps they should.</p>
<p>The election last year of Nigerian-born Adebari as mayor of Portlaoise is the most prominent manifestation of the changes sweeping this island, which is rapidly evolving from a land of emigration into one of immigration, where at least 1 in 10 people is foreign-born.</p>
<p>This transformation &mdash; fueled by a decade-long economic boom and relatively liberal immigration laws &mdash; means Ireland has gone from Western Europe&rsquo;s poorest and most homogeneous country to one of its wealthiest and most cosmopolitan in little more than a generation.</p>
<p>For the first time in its history, Ireland, which sent hundreds of thousands of emigrants to the United States, Britain and elsewhere, is wooing large numbers of migrants.</p>
<p>That has forced the country &mdash; and communities like Portlaoise, a commuter town of 14,000 residents 50 miles southwest of Dublin &mdash; to get a crash course in integration.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Fastest-growing country in Europe</b></p>
<p>The Irish economy now depends on migrant workers &mdash; whether Asian medical personnel, Eastern European service staff or Polish construction workers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the 1980s, Ireland was barely able to retain its own. The unemployment rate was around 18 percent and thousands of young people were fleeing the country annually for Britain, the United States and elsewhere. The endless conflict in Northern Ireland along with divisive battles over social issues in the south combined to scare off the best and brightest.</p>
<p>But boosted by generous tax benefits for multinational companies, the Irish economy roared to life during the nineties, earning the moniker, the &#8220;Celtic Tiger.&#8221; Between 1995-2000, the economy expanded at an astounding average of 9.5 percent per year; now it has eased to a still robust rate of 4-5 percent annual growth.</p>
<p>The newest arrivals have helped boost Ireland&rsquo;s population &mdash; now at around 4.2 million &mdash; to its highest level since 1861. It&rsquo;s the fastest-growing country in Europe.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Under the most generous immigration laws in Europe, Ireland until 2003 automatically granted citizenship to foreign parents of Irish-born children and, until 2004, gave citizenship to Irish-born children whose parents were not Irish nationals.</p>
<p><b>A nation transformed</b></p>
<p>As the number of asylum applications and economic migrants rapidly began to increase, both laws were rescinded &mdash; the former by the high court in 2003 and the latter by national referendum the following year.</p>
<p>Although official statistics vary due to difficulties in monitoring movement within the open-bordered European Union, estimates for the number of Eastern Europeans &mdash; mostly Poles &mdash; living in Ireland range from 150,000 to 300,000. Since the mid-1990s Ireland also accepted an estimated 30,000 asylum seekers, especially from Nigeria, Africa&rsquo;s most populous country.</p>
<p>Compared to the United States, the influx may not appear significant. Ireland remains nearly 95 percent white. But in a country that had virtually no people of color just a couple of decades ago, the change on the ground is unmistakable.</p>
<p>Parts of north Dublin, chiefly Parnell Street and nearby Capel Street, are developing into the country&rsquo;s first Chinatown. Just yards away, on Moore Street, the Dublin brogues of the loquacious market vendors would be familiar to generations past, but the noodle shops that line the street would not.</p>
<p>On the south side of Dublin&rsquo;s River Liffey, the influx of young people from across Europe has helped the emerging arts and cafe culture in the trendy, cobble-stoned Temple Bar district rival its better known continental counterparts.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Brazil in the West</b></p>
<p>For example, in the western town of Gort (pop. 2,500) half the population is non-Irish, including nearly 900 Brazilians. To the south, in Ennis, Nigerian-born physician Taiwo Matthew became the first immigrant elected to local office when he won a seat on the town council in 2004. A Dublin-based South African dance studio owner, Joshua N. Amaechi, choreographed last year&rsquo;s St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day parade in the capital, the country&rsquo;s largest.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Warmth and openness?</b></p>
<p>But the absorption of so many foreigners &mdash; especially those who may be nonwhite and non-Catholic &mdash; has at times tested Ireland&rsquo;s reputation for warmth and openness.</p>
<p>Many economic migrants from non-EU countries complain the country appears to have an ad hoc immigration policy that, at best, leads to administrative headaches and, at worst, leads to abuses of vulnerable workers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But unlike other European countries, Ireland has yet to have any major anti-immigration political parties. Still, acts of racism &mdash; and violence &mdash; are not unheard of.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Balbriggan, a Dublin suburb, children of African immigrants found themselves attending an all-black school this fall because the country&rsquo;s overcrowded education system could not find a place for them in any existing schools. The incident was blamed on a paperwork snafu, but suspicions of racism lingered.</p>
<p>An open question remains how welcome recent arrivals will feel should the Irish economy begin a downturn and the competition for jobs becomes fierce.</p>
<p>The soaring cost of living is already testing Ireland&rsquo;s lure as a base for international companies.</p>

			<p>The future color for Ireland is not green or red, but coffee. Coffee as in the mulattoes who will soon be running around Ireland raping and pillaging. To have fought for so long against the English only to have blacks take-over is astonishing. Besides the Russians and Serbs are there any White men who stick up for their culture. Because that is what being a White man is really all about.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t think the &#8220;Celtic Tiger&#8221; has anything to do with open immigration.  Someone found out that the Irish (both in Ireland and elsewhere) tend to have a natural knack for information technology, and with the world depending on computers, the Irish have gone from an oppressed &#8220;lumpenproletariat&#8221; (the English invented the word to describe the Irish), to being on the world&rsquo;s catbird seat.</p>
<p>However, the stereotypical Irish liberalism still remains, extending to their immigration policy, and that is what is going to undo the Celtic Tiger.  To remain ferocious, the Celtic Tiger must first remain Celtic.</p>

			<p>Ireland was such an earnest and beautiful place when I was there.  It relatively slow economy helped keep it Irish and just poignant enough without real suffering, except for the continued troubles.  Now, the Irish will be preyed upon in their homeland until there are no more Irish.  The Irish sympathy for all other historic sufferers of oppression has provided them with their Achilles Heel.  Paddy, we will miss ya, boy-o.</p>

			<p>Nice to see diversity is going so well in Ireland.</p>
<p>Lucky for them their immigrants are mostly Asian and eastern European. </p>
<p>But I thought it wuld be appropriate to view their crime statistics as well. So I Googled &#8220;crime rate Ireland&#8221; and wouldn&rsquo;t you know that the US State Dept. says: &#8220;Ireland has a low rate of violent crime, although that rate is increasing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just a coincidence, I&rsquo;m sure.<br>

			<p>A friend that visited Ireland last summer commented to me about the homogeneous population.  She said that you have to look very hard to find a single dark face in the crowds because there just weren&rsquo;t many at all.<br>
Considering what my friend told me and looking up pictures of Ireland online, I become suspicious of articles such as this. Somehow I feel that they are nothing more than an attempt by the leftist media to discourage whites (taxpayers) from escaping the U.S. for greener pastures.  What better way to do so than to give the illusion that the grass is not greener on the other side? </p>

			<p>I suppose one can say &#8220;Bye, Bye, Ireland.&#8221; The Irish appear to have as much self-hatred, as the English/British do. It took them ten years to turn 10% percent non-White, with an idigenous population below 4 million! I believe many Muslims will emmigrate from Britain, to Ireland, so they can completely take over Ireland, and have a sustainable base to fight the United Kingdom. I believe Ireland&rsquo;s idigenous population will actually only plummet, while the Muslims in the British Isles will be larger than 4 million. The Irish are almost finished. :( </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have one drop of Irish (or even Scottish) blood; but I sympathize with them, if they are willing to fight. </p>
<p>Obama might be the future &#8220;Irishman.&#8221; I think the Irish are almost finished, although I wish them the best of luck. Maybe the Irish will wake up after Bono&rsquo;s (hypothetical?) daughter marries a pure-blooded Black-African. Why is Bono trying to get his own people to feel self-hatred, when the Black Africans may have actually harmed them (certainly not vice-versa)? </p>
<p>I am worried I might find an article just like this, pertaining to Slovakia, in 5-10 years. :( </p>

			<p>*Some observers point out that immigration  &mdash;  whether by Celts, Normans, Britons or Vikings  &mdash;  is not a new phenomenon for Ireland. *</p>
<p>They always throw this little tid-bit out, as if black African, East Asian, Indian etc migrations to any white European country are somehow &#8220;equal&#8221; to historic migration by white populations - as if mass black, Indian etc migration will have as &#8220;discernable an effect&#8221; on the native population as Swedish, Latvian or German immigrants.</p>
<p>But the sad thing is, *the non-white migrants do not, and will not, care about the white European heritage of these countries*, outside proving that obscure historical figures/populations &#8220;were black&#8221;, or the &#8220;historic contributions of Asians/Indians/Iraqia to Country X&#8221; - tell me, what will:<br>
* The *Great Irish Potato Famine* mean to a Pakistani?<br>
* The *Irish Civil War* mean to a black South African?<br>
* The *Celtic heritage of Ireland* mean to a Chinese person?</p>

			<p>  Ireland is a small country of four million people.  Why it needed immigration at all is a mystery to me. Why they have allowed Third World people from failed societies into the country is even more mysterious. What happened to Irish nationalism? Perhaps, its poverty protected it all these years. Alas, poor Eire she will soon become a Deirdre of the sorrows herself.</p>

			<p>Something to think about on this St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day in Ireland&hellip;</p>
<p>St. Patrick was credited for chasing the snakes out of Ireland. Regrttably those snakes have been replaced with something far worse these last three decades   &mdash;   Black Africans! Don&rsquo;t know about you good folks   &mdash;   me, I would prefer the snakes. Snakes, at least don&rsquo;t commit crimes, nor are they a perpetual social and welfare problem.</p>

			<p>I am suspicious about the stats in this article, but I looked up the source:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cso.ie/statistics/popnclassbyreligionandnationality2006.htm" rel="nofollow">https://www.cso.ie/statistics/popnclassbyreligionandnationality2006.htm</a></p>
<p>Please note that a little over 45,000 people&rsquo;s ethnicity is &#8220;unknown&#8221;, plus 21,000 from America, plus 16,000 &#8220;other nationalities&#8221;, so judging from these stats, my guess is that Ireland is probably actually about 95-98% White, not the 94.8% that is cited in the article.  If you add the African and Asian numbers, then throw in a few more thousand, non-Whites only come to about 2.5% if the country&rsquo;s population.</p>

			<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;US State Dept. says: &ldquo;Ireland has a low rate of violent crime, although that rate is increasing</p>
<p>Crime rate rising   &mdash;   in direct proportion to increased immigration? How could it be anything but a coincidence?</p>
<p>Even the most outspoken racist knows immigrants, particularly, dark-skinned immigrants, hardly EVER commit crimes. The social unrest and riots in France over the last three years   &mdash;   undoubtedly the work of disaffected White French, angry over the price increase of their favorite wines.</p>

<p>Another idiotic multicult journalist at work. St. Patrick&rsquo;s day celebrates the traditional culture of Ireland. The &#8216;authentic vision&rsquo; of any Western country is one polluted by Third World immigrants. Who is going to celebrate that?  </p>

<p>You only need to look at the White flight going on in the US to realize that emigration will be the next step once there&rsquo;s nowhere else to run here.  A country is really just one big neighborhood and once it turns, people will flee.  Europe&rsquo;s nonwhite population is about 3.5% and more than half of these people would be considered White by US standards.  </p>

It is certainly a term of very obvious German  origin.  Hardly English. <br>
So I looked it up. It was coined by Karl Marx, in 1850.  However, he was living in England at that time. So take your pick.</p>

<p> Excellent post. These jokers always say things like this. They try to give the impression that the various European countries are really just immigrant nations and thus provide a cloak of legitimacy to the black and brown invaders of today. It is historical revisionism at its worst.</p>

<p>Cop, check out where your friend went, some regions in Ireland are probably quite homogenous. I visit Dublin every year, and the Nigerians, Chinese, Thais, Burkas and Rumanian gypsies begging with their stinky babies are definitely on the increase.  There are plenty of Poles too, but they&rsquo;re blue-eyed blondes who work hard, integrate and don&rsquo;t bring in third world lifestyle and culture.  The Third World immigrants  are also setting up in the smaller neighbouring towns and this reflects the situation that occurred in other European cities 30 -40 years ago. When England was first being invaded and colonized by the third world on a large scale it was the capital city London that was targeted and people were reassured that Capital Cities have always been &#8216;cosmopolitan don&rsquo;t ya know&rsquo;. Similarly with Ireland, Dublin is definitely a multicult city, there are all the usual signs, govt. quangos set up for immigrants, multicult centres, travel agencies and phone ads for 3rd world destinations. I&rsquo;ve also noticed an increase in the indoctrination process: Irish youths handing out begging leaflets for starving Africans, and information about Irish Racists, (CAIR- Campaign Against Irish Racism). I can&rsquo;t pass one by without giving them a good talking to; I left the one from CAIR almost in tears last year after informing her about Irelands past.<br>
 Rotimi Adebari the Mayor of Portlaoise(pron. Portleesh) is Nigerian. Irish girls are appearing with  mixed race children, Chinese children with Irish names&hellip;  <br>
The signs are not good for Ireland.</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;St. Patrick was credited for chasing the snakes out of Ireland.<br>

<p>According to my relatives in Jo&rsquo;burg, Africans are terrified of snakes, so some Whites put fake snakes in their cars/homes to deter would-be thieves. Perhaps Ireland&rsquo;s &#8216;snakelessness&rsquo; is the reason for its appeal to Africans!!.<br>

&#8220;These jokers always say things like this. They try to give the impression that the various European countries are really just immigrant nations and thus provide a cloak of legitimacy to the black and brown invaders of today.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, many of those &#8220;jokers&#8221; currently owning and running the various European countries ARE immigrants or relatively recent immigrants (as Sarkozy, for one example). So, as outsiders and immigrants themselves, it serves their interest to portray the European countries as &#8220;immigrant nations&#8221;. In fact, I supose that from THEIR OWN point of view, that&rsquo;s how they honestly do see them.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Since the mid-1990s Ireland also accepted an estimated 30,000 asylum seekers, especially from Nigeria, Africa&rsquo;s most populous country.&#8221;</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s the rub: Why is Africa&rsquo;s internal conflicts Ireland&rsquo;s problem to take in?<br>
Africa is a vast continent with dozens of countries: Resettle them there, where they belong.<br>
Hey you Irish idiots: Look up the &#8220;Eve Carson&#8221; story in Chapel Hill NC. Or the &#8220;Lauren Burk&#8221; story in Auburn GA. Just to see what daily life will be like some years from now in Ireland. You have no idea.</p>
<p>And you know what, SCREW &#8220;economic growth&#8221;: This is endlessly trotted out as justification for ethnic cleansing of any and every last white European ethnic culture and people. There are things in this world more important than endless &#8220;economic growth&#8221;. </p>

Google the name Grace Moore and Belfast and you will find this sort of thing is already happening in Ireland. </p>

Yes, the Nigerians are there now,  and they&rsquo;re doing what comes naturally.</p>
