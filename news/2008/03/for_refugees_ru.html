						<p>You can&rsquo;t smoke in most places. Bribes are a no-no. Car seats and kids&rsquo; bicycle helmets are the law.</p>
<p>And beating your wife will land you in jail &mdash; not to mention get you deported.</p>
<p>These are among the new rules and customs the world&rsquo;s refugees face in California, but they aren&rsquo;t so tough to handle considering they come with a package of liberties unknown in their native lands.</p>
<p>Several times a year, immigrants &mdash; primarily from the Middle East and Africa &mdash; who have won refuge in the United States undergo orientations just days after stepping off planes at Los Angeles International Airport.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On a recent morning, about 55 immigrants from Iran gathered for coffee and doughnuts in the courtyard of a small Episcopal church that serves as the center&rsquo;s headquarters.</p>
<p>Center director Anna Baghdassarian, a native of Iran, addressed the refugees, just days off a plane, in their native Farsi.</p>
<p>Her talk is the same to immigrants from all countries. None is singled out for warnings about life in America compared with life at home.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to tell them the policeman is not a bad guy. Unlike in your country, they&rsquo;re not out to get you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If you&rsquo;re pulled over, don&rsquo;t try to bribe your way out of it like you do in most countries.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The brief orientation lecture, typically three days after refugees arrive, also explains day-to-day life in the United States. These new residents learn their adopted nation&rsquo;s dress, how to get health care, how to pay bills and get credit, and when to call 911.</p>
<p>&#8220;Make sure to drink water. We live in a desert,&#8221; Decker said. &#8220;Use perfumes sparingly. Here&rsquo;s how traffic signals work. If you get an ATM card, don&rsquo;t tell anyone your password. It is the law girls attend school.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s talk of earthquakes and brush fires, smoke detectors and bus schedules. They learn about car seats and bike helmets and the importance of being at work on time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Americans have a saying, &lsquo;Time is money,&#8221;&rsquo; Decker said. &#8220;You have to be on time. You can&rsquo;t be late for work. You can&rsquo;t take off for a few hours; you have to work your eight hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>The one that really throws the newcomers is the concept of innocent until proven guilty, she said.</p>

					<p>&#8220;the world`s refugees face in California&#8221;&hellip; This pretty much somes up the article and the situation. Why are we hosting the entire world?!?  What political alliances that benefit the national interest could ever be served by having the entire world coming here. None. Especially our own! </p>

					<p>To Tim McHugh,<br>
   Welcom to the real world. At one time I thought there was a One world Government (OWG), or at least an attempt to make one. For a <span class="caps">OWG </span>to function, they need a passive, <span class="caps">UNITED</span> States. In the last 40 years the educational system and media have succeeded into turning americans into sheep. <br><br>
   So why upset the applecart by importing violent foreigners? Why would the <span class="caps">OWG </span>allow 100,000 Mestizos to march demanding &#8220;right&#8221; (actually, privilges, they have more rights here than in their old country.) If you give them rights, they may want more.<br><br>
   In a nutshell, the third world has discovered that by controlling certain resources they can control the industrial world. They are dumping their trash on us to destroy us! Many in government are aiding this menance.<br><br>
   We can fight back, but first we must unite.</p>

					<p>I&rsquo;ve been wondering who is responsible for bringing &#8220;refugees&#8221; to the United States - who&rsquo;s allowing it. What I believe is that the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>has an agreement with the United Nations to accept a certain number annually, as do some other countries. The &#8220;refugees&#8221; get to choose the destination. We need to get out of the United Nations and get the United Nations out of our country!</p>

					<p>I have always wanted to live in California but in my profession $65,000 a year in just about the income I can expect. In most places I can live in relative comfort, but Not California. My question is.. How do the people they send to California who have never made over minimum wage Live and Survive there?<br>

					<p>If third-worlders are not allowed to beat their wifes here in America, they should hold their immigration lawyer responsible for lying and misleading them.</p>

<p>The same way they survive in the new Los Angeles(Las Vegas). Welfare and food stamps. Your paying for your own destruction Whitey&hellip;..The last year I lived in southern California(Orange County) I made 41,000 dollars. I was able to afford a studio apartment. You won&rsquo;t do much better with 65,000.</p>

					<p>Tough rules to follow. Don&rsquo;t stone your wife or any other woman. Don&rsquo;t mutilate your daughters. Don&rsquo;t chop children&rsquo;s heads off to spite a family member. Don&rsquo;t fly planes into buildings. </p>

					<p>&#8220;How do people who make minimum wage live and survive there?&#8221;<br>
 By turning the purse upside and shaking it after they`ve let the parking lot&hellip;</p>

					<p>The wife beating thing - reminds me of a joke Slovenes tell concerning Bosnians (a Bosnian is a muslim living in Bosnia-Herzegovina, where a Bosnian Serb (the indigenous ethnic group) is not muslim)).  Anyway, here is the joke; &#8220;The Muslim man beats his wife when she is bad, and beats his wife when she is good to make sure she isn&rsquo;t bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>Because when you are a low or no achieving waste of oxygen the government (ie: the taxpayer) has an obligation to pay for essentials. This includes rent, food, basic utilities, legal representation, language translation, medical care, etc etc. </p>
<p>In the multitude of benefits recieved by these eternal dependants the only things not covered are what are deemed &#8220;luxuries&#8221; such as cosmetics, consumer electronics, motor vehicles etc. But even these are aquirable through the endless charities extended to such people. If not they&rsquo;ll simply steal it with minimal consequence.</p>
<p>This is all information I have seen first hand, not just propaganda from so called &#8220;hate sites&#8221; They are raised on handouts from cradle to grave and encouraged to see it as their right, not a privelage. </p>
<p>Of course this is not self sustaining even for 1% of the population and will implode without warning and with dire consequences for those of us who work for a living.</p>
