<h1>Basil Brush Probed by Police Over &lsquo;Racist Abuse&rsquo; in Gipsy Spell Sketch</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Christopher Leaker, Daily Mail (London), March 16, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>You would hardly put him in the risque category when it comes to entertainment.</p>
<p>But these days, it seems that even Basil Brush is classed as controversial.</p>
<p>The wisecracking puppet, who has been on children&rsquo;s TV since the Sixties, is being investigated by the police for racism, after his show featured a gipsy selling pegs and heather.</p>
<p>Members of the gipsy community complained to the Northamptonshire force, saying this was racial abuse.</p>
<p>And although the episode was first shown on the BBC six years ago, and has been repeated eight times since, officers now plan to study it for evidence.</p>
<p>The programme features Basil&rsquo;s friend Mr Stephen, played by Christopher Pizzey, falling under a gipsy spell which makes him attractive to women.</p>
<p>Dame Rosie Fortune, who lives above the pair, tries to sell Basil pegs and heather &mdash; but he turns her down.</p>
<p>She then offers to tell Basil&rsquo;s fortune, but he says: !I went to a fortune teller once and he said I was going on a long journey.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Stephen then asks him what happened, to which Basil replies &#8220;He stole my wallet and I had to walk all the way home.&#8221;</p>
<p>The episode, also on a DVD called Basil Unleashed, was last shown on the digital channel CBBC, last month.</p>
<p>Critics believe that the investigation is a waste of police time. But Joseph Jones, vice chairman of the Southern England Romany Gipsy and Irish Traveller Network, said: &#8220;This sort of thing happens quite regularly and we are fed up with making complaints about stereotypical comments about us in words that we find racist or offensive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Racist abuse of black people is quite rightly no longer deemed acceptable, but when a comedian makes a joke on TV about pikeys or gippos, there&rsquo;s no comeback.</p>
<p>&#8220;Travellers have historically sold heather and pegs, but they don&rsquo;t do it anymore for a living. It could be that someone thought this was a kind of stereotyping.&#8221;</p>
<p>Basil Brush was created by Peter Firmin in 1963 and was given his own show in 1970.</p>
<p>In 2002 he made a TV comeback and now stars in a new version of the Seventies children&rsquo;s show Swap Shop, on BBC2.</p>
