<p>If the McKinley kids seem especially knowledgeable about history, it&rsquo;s because the entire fifth-grade class recently returned from an all-day field trip to the African-American Historical Museum and Cultural Center of Iowa in Cedar Rapids.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the only such museum in the state of Iowa,&#8221; said McKinley fifth-grade teacher Ta Rae Evans, &#8220;and we thought the field trip would be a perfect way to conclude our social studies unit on Black History Month.&#8221;</p>
<p>February is Black History Month, but never mind. During the March 20 trip, students had a chance to learn about famed inventor and educator George Washington Carver as well as tackle the issue of slavery in an interactive program called &#8220;Doorways.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jordan Nelson said he was astonished that slaves were permitted only one meal a day. &#8220;I know I couldn&rsquo;t live that way,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;What surprised me was that kids weren&rsquo;t allowed to own shoes until they were 12 years old,&#8221; said Tina Brown. &#8220;I&rsquo;m only 11, and I know I love shoes. Well .&nsbp;.&nbsp;. (fashion) boots, actually.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Even for a 30-year elementary teaching veteran like [Kris] Flewelling, the trip proved to be a real eye-opener.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had no idea Iowa played such a significant role in the Underground Railroad,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Plus, I was actually a student at Iowa State University and had no idea the role George Washington Carver played in ISU&rsquo;s history!&#8221;</p>

					<p>The field trip is okay if there is another field trip focused on the whites and non-blacks who helped shape this country. &#8216;Equality&rsquo;, right?</p>

					<p>It&rsquo;s interesting how the article starts out with &#8220;If the McKinley kids seem especially knowledgeable about history&hellip;&#8221; Notice how it implies that they are now &#8220;knowledgeable about history&#8221; instead of simply knowledgeable about one interpretation or one &#8220;color&#8221; of history. If it had said &#8221; McKinley kids seem especially knowledgeable about African-American history&#8221; then it would sound like they were propagandized, which is exactly what they were, so of course the article couldn&rsquo;t say that. Also notice how it says nothing about how the kids learned about how Africans sold each other into slavery, because they learned no such thing. This is simply about focusing on the sins of one group of people (whites) while ignoring the sins of everybody else. Like I said, propaganda.</p>

<p>Can&rsquo;t you just picture this featherhead whooping it up at a Barry Obama rally?</p>
<p>50+ year-old women such as her are the ones who do a major job polluting the minds of impressionable children.  They majored in nothing but ElEd at a state diploma mill and then pass on all the global warming, African history, and women&rsquo;s lib garbage.</p>
<p>As a high school teacher I had to spend far too much time unravelling the webs of falsehood these Baby Boomer teachers wove.  And I&rsquo;ll bet it isn&rsquo;t going to get any better with today&rsquo;s poorly prepared, semi-literate &#8220;professionals&#8221;.<br>

					<p>Dear Lord! The takeover of our youth is just about complete. Lies are fed to them daily in our schools and the media. Will there ever be an awakening of White Americans before it is too late? There is a war going on and Whites are the only race that doesn&rsquo;t know about it. Come to think about it, most Whites wouldn&rsquo;t lift a finger to protect themselves or their children to begin with. That is how pathetic they have become. They are &#8220;mommies&#8221; to the nonwhite hordes.</p>

					<p>When are they going to take them to Reverend Wright&rsquo;s black church and let them listen to how much he despises whites and hates the US?<br>
  <br><br>
Actually, according to most blacks, that kind of rhetoric isn&rsquo;t unusual in black churches so I guess almost any black church will do.</p>
<p>Also, did the museum get a chance to give the kids some false history and show them the list of black invention myths?</p>

					<p>you poor white children being escorted into white race extermination camps. having your white racial-cultural-heritage-history removed from your psyche. being forcefed multi-culti-diversity poison. you will grow up thinking your dead white race cannot survive without the inclusion of other non-white races and most importantly of all you will learn that your savior race will be the wonderkin black race. when your generation rises to full adulthood you will find that your white race has disappeared and you as a former member of the white race will become invisible (color-blind)   </p>

					<p>More examples of stereotypical generalizations that do not bear out accurately.  While it is undoubtedly true that some slaves only age one meal per day or that they worked long hours during &#8216;season&rsquo;   &mdash;   it is equally true that many did not have it so bad.  Sundays was generally a non-work day, Saturdays were often half days, and often during the non-harvest period there were periods of extended free time.  Moreover, in VA and other eastern southern states huge numbers of slaves were actually &#8216;free&rsquo; to earn jobs as skilled laborers in towns such as Petersburg or Richmond and were basically non-supervised.  This is <span class="caps">NEVER </span>mentioned.  Nat Turner had every weekend &#8216;off&rsquo; to meet with all the other conspirators in the woods where they cooked plentiful meals while discussing their murderous plans.  Frederick Douglass wrote how he literally bribed other white boys his age to teach him to read   &mdash;   who were quite literally worse off than he   &mdash;   by sharing loaves of bread which he always was able to get from a relative working in the master&rsquo;s kitchen.  He also got extended &#8216;sabaticals&rsquo; to work in the city where he was unsupervised.  It was only when his condition &#8216;worsened&rsquo; and he had to return to the agricultural like of a laborer that he &#8216;rebelled&rsquo; and sought his freedom.  The authors of &#8220;Time on the Cross&#8221; shared the diet and work hours of chattel slaves with the &#8216;wage slaves&rsquo; of the north and found them comparable and often that the wage slave had it worse.  The authors point out the fact that only in the United States were slaves able to reproduce on their own without much importation of new stock.  In virtually every other island and nation in the Caribbean and Latin America the loss of slave life was horrendous.  Certainly the Molly Maquires or the western miners - who worked 364 days per year even up to the early 1900s - had it much worse.  But this is never brought up to these little &#8216;darlings&rsquo; who seemingly think only that whites were racists and that only blacks had it tough in the last century.  While I&rsquo;m no apologist for slavery and lost ancestors at Gettysburg to destory that institution, neither will I allow this propaganda to go &#8216;unanswered&rsquo;.  The teacher is doing a grave injustice and our kids are literally being brainwashed!</p>

					<p>It&rsquo;s the same as when they say whites came to America and enslaved, massacred the Native Americans&hellip; as if the Indians were all sitting around smoking peace pipes with each other. </p>
<p>In reality, most of the tribes loved to fight and they had wars all the time. They stole from each other, they captured Indians from other tribes and enslaved them or tortured them to death. Yet people still insist they were like innocent children cultivating corn when we arrived and decimated them. </p>

					<p><span class="caps">WHERE </span>in the <span class="caps">USA </span>is my museum? My people need a museum too! </p>
<p>My Scot-Irish ancestors came to this wilderness and won it from the Indians, then helped drive out the British authorities, then pushed back the frontier to realize our Manifest Destiny. Their graves dot the landscape from Fairfax County, Virginia to Mexico and they have served this country in every major war (foreign and domestic) since before the Revolution. No, they were not brought here as slaves&hellip;.they <span class="caps">WANTED </span>to be here&hellip;.or more accurately&hellip;.they wanted to be gone from where they were originally. (Ha Ha.) Yes, they owned slaves. Bought them good and proper at the slave market, with a receipt, under the laws in place at the time. They also owned land provided them by the Federal government as land grants to Revolutionary War veterans. They also killed animals and ate their flesh, which they continue to do. They also made whiskey&hellip;some of which they drank and the rest they sold or shared with visitors and friends. </p>
<p>As part of the first generation of my people to graduate college, I can tell you that my people are vigorous and aggressive. They work hard and they play hard. They take women from other tribes. (My mother was Scotish Presbyterian. My dad was English Baptist. Both sides of the family thought they married outside their race. Ha Ha.) Foxworthy says you might be a redneck if your mother does not even take the Malboro from her lips as she tells the state trooper to go to hell. (I have actually seen it happen.) So I guess I am a redneck after all.</p>
<p>Redneck Museum&hellip;.sounds like a winner. Maybe we can get Larry the Cableguy to greet people at the door. (And yes, it is quite acceptable to speak English with a Southern accent.)</p>

					<p>As part of social studies will these kids learn about the racist dictator Mugabe in Zimbabwe who instituted a policy of ethnic cleansing against whites and simultaneously destroyed the economy and agriculture.</p>
<p>And will they learn about the genocide in Rwanda, or the Sudan, or the deep poverty throughout much of Africa.</p>
<p>If they can find a way to blame whites, they will teach it, otherwise, no.</p>

					<p>Let me get this straight. No shoes &#8216;til age 12?  Washington at the Battle of Trenton, combat soldiers leaving bloody foot prints in the snow because they were shoeless. Battle of Gettysburg, Southern units head there for supposedly available stocks of shoes. Many Rebs are shoeless. Children&rsquo;s growing feet will be shod whenever a newly fitting shoe is required? </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try and recall some history. America mainly rural &#8216;til after <span class="caps">WW2.</span> On our farm, the operator&rsquo;s youngest children walked around and  played shoeless during the summer months. That was in the late 50&rsquo;s!!  If people will examine American painting by the likes of Norman Rockwell, they may be surprised by images rendered for covers of the Saturday Evening Post. All-American Boy is a good example. The painting, Steamboat Race on the Connecticut River, is another faithful rendering of American life, for wich Rockwell is so famous. Deck hand or steersman,depicted barefoot.</p>
<p>My Dad taught from the late 40&rsquo;s to the early 80&rsquo;s. We lived in<br>
 the Chicago metro area. During the mid 60&rsquo;s one of his<br><br>
 colleagues, impoverished by medical costs for his mother, could not afford shoes for his son. He concealed this fact by having the youth wear soleless vamps. In desperation, he sought <br><br>
from the Hammond welfare office, money to purchase a single pair of shoes for the boy. It was his misfortune to have his request evaluated by a negress. He showed the case worker his son&rsquo;s bare sole. She dismissed the need and sent him away. My Dad bought his friend shoes for the son.</p>
<p>Africans, enslaved by their own race, for sale outside the continent of Africa, left behind a tradition of magnificent <br>
 footwear, only to be rendered shoeless upon reaching another<br><br>
continent. I guess that earns a, &#8220;Cry me a river&#8221;, epigram.  </p>

					<p>I am dismayed by how few parents even notice what is being taught to their children - perhaps they think that only inner city schools are indoctrinating.  It is a mistake as even in the most monochromatic suburbs and private schools, the children are pounded year after year with lessons on slavery.  Between 2nd and 6th, my children studied slavery every year, in addition to the horrors the white man visited upon the Indians.  They studied the &#8220;enormous cultural contributions&#8221; of these two groups and a rosy picture of peaceful, loving people was painted. In contrast to the one white group focused on - the Vikings, with special attention to the &#8220;berserkers&#8221; ( think I have that right). I started home schooling after school and on weekends - just a few hours a week, to try and cover a few minor things left untouched as of 6th grade by their top notch public and private schools - Greeks, Romans, etc.  <br>
My oldest is in high school and has been bringing home handouts copied from Zinn&rsquo;s &#8220;People&rsquo;s History&#8221; that are assigned reading.  Liberal garbage.  The American educational system turns out vast numbers of poorly educated &#8220;products&#8221; incapable of critical analysis because the curriculum is designed to indoctrinate the multicultural message that every culture is important and has something to teach us - except the one deemed white (ignoring its very roots).  A suburban school, or a private one is no guarantee of immunity to the same garbage being taught in an inner city school - the teachers are often products of  the same education schools/teacher&rsquo;s colleges where self-esteem and multiculti reign supreme, and history is rewritten to serve as propaganda. Anti-white, anti-American propaganda.  </p>

					<p>For those that are interest in Black History I would highly recommend this website.</p>
<p>https://www33.brinkster.com/iiiii/inventions/<br>
Black Invention Myths</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you&rsquo;ve heard the claims: Were it not for the genius and energy of African-American inventors, we might find ourselves in a world without traffic lights, peanut butter, blood banks, light bulb filaments, and a vast number of other things we now take for granted but could hardly imagine life without.</p>
<p>Such beliefs usually originate in books or articles about black history. Since many of the authors have little interest in the history of technology outside of advertising black contributions to it, their stories tend to be fraught with misunderstandings, wishful thinking, or fanciful embellishments with no historical basis. The lack of historical perspective leads to extravagant overestimations of originality and importance: sometimes a slightly modified version of a pre-existing piece of technology is mistaken for the first invention of its type; sometimes a patent or innovation with little or no lasting value is portrayed as a major advance, even if there&rsquo;s no real evidence it was ever used.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well I hope that Ta Rae (whether he or she) learned something. I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a lot of black history to be found in Iowa!  </p>
<p><i>&#8220;Jordan Nelson said he was astonished that slaves were permitted only one meal a day.&#8221; <br>
&ldquo;What surprised me was that kids weren&rsquo;t allowed to own shoes until they were 12&#8221; </i></p>
<p>Where do they get this stuff?  It was not to a master&rsquo;s interest to starve his slaves! Or abuse his slaves.  How could he get any work out of them?  And I suppose they received a whipping once a week too?  Just for the master&rsquo;s fun, of course.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;I had no idea Iowa played such a significant role in the Underground Railroad,&rdquo; she said.  </i></p>
<p>Well, I had no idea either!  And I still don&rsquo;t.  Where would  such slaves be going?  Western Canada wasn&rsquo;t developed at that time. There were no railroads or highways or population centers yet there. There was noplace for escaped slaves to go.  And slaves coming up the Mississippi, or from St. Louis, would have jumped off in Illinois, well before they got to Iowa. There might have been a trickle coming into Iowa up from Kansas City, but KC didn&rsquo;t really start developing  until well  <span class="caps">AFTER </span>the Civil War.  In 1853, it was a tiny town with a pop. of only 2500.    And Winnipeg wasn&rsquo;t even incorporated as a city until 1873. The total black population of Iowa in 1860 was only 1069, most of them being free mulattoes.  Where were all those escaped black slaves?</p>
<p><span class="caps">THAT </span>is actual history!   What they&rsquo;re teaching isn&rsquo;t history,  it&rsquo;s  propaganda and fiction.</p>

					<p>&#8220;Jordan Nelson said he was astonished that slaves were permitted only one meal a day. &ldquo;I know I couldn&rsquo;t live that way,&rdquo; he said.&#8221;</p>
<p>What selective nonsense is pumped into these little children&rsquo;s impressionable minds, all for modern day political objectives. It is absurd to make such a sweeping generalization, since the conditions of slaves would individually vary: There was no national policy &#8220;slaves may only have one meal a day&#8221;. In fact the material conditions of slaves compared favorably with whites of that time. Reference for example &#8220;Time On the Cross&#8221; by (1993 Nobel Laureate) Robert William Fogel and Stanley L. Engerman:<br>
Regarding slavery as practiced in the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> South: &#8220;The belief that slave-breeding, sexual exploitation&hellip; destroyed the black family is a myth.&#8221; &#8220;Most slave sales were either of whole families or of individuals who were at an age when it would have been normal for them to have left the family&#8221; &#8220;The material conditions of the lives of slaves compared favorably with those of free industrial workers&#8221; &#8220;Slaves were exploited in the sense that part of the income was expropriated&hellip;but the rate was lower than generally presumed&#8221; &#8220;Over the course of his lifetime the typical slave field hand received about 90% of the income he produced&#8221;<br><br>
But why is this in Iowa in any case: There was no slavery in Iowa. In fact, many white boys from Iowa died and many more horrifically mutilated fighting in the Union army against the South.<br><br>
And do you ever suppose these kids will be taken to the &#8220;Victims of Communism Museum&#8221; to learn about the 1/3 of humanity that was enslaved under Marxist regimes for the better part of the past century, or the 100 million human beings murdered by Communist regimes. This is, after all, a lot more relevant and still present threat than slavery in the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> South that ended 150 years ago. All parties involved in that are <span class="caps">DEAD, </span>many generations ago. Millions of victims of communism are still alive today. And millions still live under communist slavery (North Korea, Cuba,&hellip;).<br><br>

					<p>&#8220;Children&rsquo;s growing feet will be shod whenever a newly fitting shoe is required?  <br>
America was mainly rural &lsquo;til after <span class="caps">WW2.</span> On our farm, the operator&rsquo;s youngest children walked around and played shoeless during the summer months. That was in the late 50&rsquo;s!! &#8221;    &mdash;  -  Walt<br><br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;  -<br><br>
Oh, now I see.  Well, finally that makes some sense. Thanks, Walt.  I&rsquo;m sure that children in the South, and all over the country, went shoeless in the 1800&rsquo;s  [just look at all pictures of Huckleberry Finn]    &mdash;   and went that way well into the 20th century too.   That was nothing unusual for the time   &mdash;    and not reserved for blacks alone.  How selective they are about whining over their &#8220;suffering&#8221;!</p>
<p>My family did not consider itself  &#8220;poor&#8221;  but was not well-off either.  Even so, when I was a kid, in the Depression years of the 30s and the war-rationing years of the 40s,  we used to cover the holes in our shoes by cutting  out cardboard inserts made from cereal boxes. These, however, wore out quickly.  Later, much better more durable ones could be made of plastic cut from bottles, when plastics became available (such as detergent bottles). </p>
<p>Also, old leather, such as purses, could be recycled.  We did our own shoe repairs. I remember my father had a kit for this. (He also rolled his own cigarettes with a little machine for that purpose.) It was costly to keep replacing shoes for a growing child, and active kids wore shoes out quickly.  It was perfectly common to go barefoot in summer. No big deal and no disgrace.  In fact, kids liked it.</p>
<p>Those days are long past and forgotten by all but the elderly. Now, kids have &#8220;fashion boots&#8221; and designer sneakers that cost a small fortune, and are shocked that people didn&rsquo;t have them in 1850. What these spoiled kids need is to learn some <span class="caps">REAL </span>history!</p>

<p>In the old South, so many people being barefoot caused very widespread hookworm infection, with its resultant listlissness in a large part of the population.</p>

					<p>This is the way our children are being psychologically enslaved so that as they grow up feeling ashamed of their own skin color they will be passive victims as they submit to oppressed second class citizen status, racially discriminated against and racially vilified at every turn in their lives.</p>
