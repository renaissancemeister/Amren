						<p>BOCA RATON &mdash; A crowd of more than 500 people waiting for hours this morning for housing voucher applications were dispersed by police in riot gear at the Boca Raton Housing Authority when the applications ran out sooner than expected.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Two people were arrested and six to eight people hospitalized for exhaustion during the ordeal.</p>
<p>Hundreds of people, mostly mothers who had spent more than eight hours in line, were forced to leave the property at 2333 W. Glades Road by 30 Boca Raton Police officers, including SWAT team members, who walked toward the crowd in unison holding their police shields up about 10:30 a.m.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The overwhelming turnout of people desperate for housing money came as little surprise to Suzanne Cabrera, president of the Housing Leadership Council of Palm Beach County.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an indication that housing it&rsquo;s still a huge problem,&#8221; Cabrera said this afternoon. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a reflection of people&rsquo;s concern for housing, their uncertainty. I got people today asking me: was this my last chance to get housing I can afford?&#8221;</p>
<p>Several other things, such as mortgage foreclosures and high gas prices, are contributing to that feeling of insecurity and desperation, she said.</p>
<p>So whenever word gets out that voucher applications are being handed out, which she said doesn&rsquo;t happen very often, people get full of hope.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>By 10 a.m. the crowd had swelled to more than 500 people, with most unaware that the bulk of applications had already been passed out.</p>
<p>The parking lot was a mass of women nursing crying babies, pushing strollers and waiting anxiously for officials to give them information.</p>
<p>People grew agitated. Several fights broke out. Police and firefighters said they were prepared if things were to turn violent on a large scale. Nearly 50 firefighters and paramedics from the city, county and Delray Beach set up across the street in the Town Center mall parking lot.</p>
<p>Then an official came out of the housing authority building and announced through a megaphone that disabled people should come forward.</p>
<p>Instead, the entire crowd surged forward. People fell down and were close to being trampled, witnesses said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Most of the crowd disagreed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re all working people and we&rsquo;re all bitter right now,&#8221; said Deborah Davis, 37. &#8220;To be turned away like this hurts.&#8221;</p>
<p>People in the line said they came overnight, from as far away as Riviera Beach and Pahokee, to apply for the housing subsidy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Shayla Williams, 22, of West Palm Beach, was angered by the police tactics.</p>
<p>&#8220;This place is going to get shot up later,&#8221; she yelled to officers. &#8220;They can&rsquo;t treat us like this.&#8221;</p>

					<p>Surprised this is happening in Boca Raton, The Land of Retirement Elderly? Don&rsquo;t be. This is also a high crime area. I feel for the old Jewish people in the area. This is the same area that had the suspect who stalked women near a large shopping mall. He tied up a little girl and her mom and, when her mom fought back, shot and killed both of them. He targeted high end <span class="caps">SUV&rsquo;</span>s. Maybe someone else has the link to the story? I can&rsquo;t remember all of the facts just yet. Florida has become a nasty crime ridden state. From the city of Jacksonville all the way to Miami you can drive around and quickly figure out where the &#8220;bad are&#8221; is and there are too many of them. Sorry to say, the mentality of these people who were getting unruly- who we know aren&rsquo;t <span class="caps">WHITE </span>no longer surprises me. Sigh</p>

					<p>This sort of behavior can be contained when only 30% of the population is poor, uneducated, and ignorant.  However, because of massive immigration from Third World countries, and the high birth rates among such immigrants, soon such people will comprise 505, 60%, or 80% of the population   &mdash;   then what happens?  What happens when 50% of Americans are screaming for free houses, welfare, and food stamps?  This demographic nightmare will occur just about the time that oil runs out, and gasoline, food, electricity, and clean water are all too expensive for most people.  </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t believe it?  Check the percentage of Minority students in elementary schools.  Go to any maternity ward and count the number of Minority babies   &mdash;   it is already over 50%.  Next generation, that number will nearly double.  This is the future our leaders have arranged for us.</p>

					<p>Interesting how most of these &lsquo;poor&rsquo; people needing assistance can afford cigarettes, fancy hair-dos and portable lawn chairs to plop their fat butts into. If laziness was a commodity, the blacks would be the richest people on the face of the Earth.</p>
<p>Also – Look at all of the trash they left behind in picture 12, eerily reminiscent of Katrina.<br>

					<p>In other words, Section 8 people behaved like Section 8 people as they were waiting to apply for Section 8.  Odds are they won&rsquo;t be much better behaved in their Section 8 domiciles.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t feel for the &#8220;Boca bluehairs,&#8221; regardless of their religion. They and the other &#8220;condo commies&#8221; from up north who have taken over Palm Beach and Broward counties are the enablers for these black sociopaths; therefore, much of the blame for the crime wave can be laid at their feet. They&rsquo;re the local equivalent of Seattle&rsquo;s &#8220;latte liberals,&#8221; Chicago&rsquo;s &#8220;lakefront liberals,&#8221; and the &#8220;limousine liberals&#8221; in <span class="caps">LA, NYC </span>& elsewhere. If it weren&rsquo;t for them, the country wouldn&rsquo;t be in the gargantuan mess that it&rsquo;s in.</p>
<p><span class="caps">BTW, </span>&#8220;boca raton&#8221; is Spanish for &#8220;mouse&rsquo;s mouth&#8221;   &mdash;   which in this case is ironically appropriate.</p>

					<p>I would really like to object here. I know some Whites on Section 8. They are on disability. Yes they have to live with other Sec 8 folks in what are often not real great places, but that is the way it goes. </p>
<p>And around here anyway, a very large % of Sec 8 users are employed Hispanics. They are just the working poor, that&rsquo;s all. Maybe some are single Hispanic Mom&rsquo;s raising kids. Hispanics generally work. One of my White friends went to the Sec 8 meetings to get on the system and the people were quite well behaved. Just low income working class Hispanics, that&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really incorrect to say to Sec 8 folks: Get a job! Around here anyway, majority of them work or if they do not, they are on disability. You have to pay $200-300/month usually on Sec 8, so it&rsquo;s pretty much impossible to be on Sec 8 and have no source of income.</p>
<p>This site just seethes with hatred for low income and poor Whites. You don&rsquo;t spell it that way, but when you cast aspersion on the poor and low income, you condemn millions of your White brethren. Shame on you.</p>

<p>No Section 8 housing.</p>
<p>No <span class="caps">SSI.</span></p>
<p>No food stamps.</p>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do with these being section 8 people. I currently live in section 8 housing that is mostly populated by disabled and elderly whites and Mexican families with young children. The neighborhood was quite quiet and peaceful until relatively recently when a certain group of people started moving in. I think everyone knows what group I&rsquo;m talking about. </p>

					<p>&#8220;And around here anyway, a very large % of Sec 8 users are employed Hispanics. They are just the working poor, that&rsquo;s all. Maybe some are single Hispanic Mom&rsquo;s raising kids.&#8221;</p>
<p>How did it become the responsibility of whites to pay for the housing of such people? Shouldn&rsquo;t they have thought of all these terrible difficulties before having children in the first place? Or is prudence not a mestizo strong suit? With all those Strong Family Values, shouldn&rsquo;t mestizos even be able to support their own families?</p>
<p>&#8220;This site just seethes with hatred for low income and poor Whites.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to you. I defy you to point to a single example of this.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&rsquo;t spell it that way, but when you cast aspersion on the poor and low income, you condemn millions of your White brethren.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another fanciful Lindsay interpretation. Pointing to the abysmal behavior and culture of welfare blacks and mestizos somehow casts &#8220;aspersions&#8221; on whites. Really? This class war exists only in your own sorry mind. I also know low income whites. They won&rsquo;t make anyone forget the Vanderbilts, but they don&rsquo;t behave like this. Your childish attempt to &#8220;shame&#8221; us is more fit for the third-world children over whom you&rsquo;ve been given charge. Please get back to us when you can point to an actual example of any white person being ridiculed because of his income.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also amusing to note that white racial solidarity now seems to be ok with you; have you given up your hopes for white extinction, that grand program you promote on your blog?</p>

					<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;This site just seethes with hatred for low income and poor Whites.</p>
<p>Sorry, friend <span class="caps">YOU </span>are way off-base on this one. I&rsquo;ve pointed out for years working poor are screwed   &mdash;   because illegal immigrants <span class="caps">DEPRESS </span>wages, and working poor have a hard time getting the benefits illegals get unquestioned!</p>
<p>Sure many of us are justifiably angry over wellfare freeloaders. Emphasis being on <span class="caps">FREELOADER </span>as opposed to the working poor.</p>
<p>As to Hispanic single moms, Blacks living off the system   &mdash;   that&rsquo;s what we rail about. As a taxpayer and citizen, I sure as hell hate seeing 30 million criminal illegal aliens flood our country. Then the male takes a $6 or $8 dollar an hour job; the female works in the fast food slop franchises   &mdash;   and goes to the welfare office with her sob-story about Jose left her and her seven kids for another woman. While the family then gets lots of hand-outs we American tax-payers fund. While both male and female are <span class="caps">STEALING JOBS </span>from American workers.</p>
<p>The Blacks, of course are another story. Lazy, shiftless, uneducated, and generally <span class="caps">UNWILLING </span>to either work, much less clean up their act. By going to school, taking job courses, and actually developing a work ethic   &mdash;   which includes showing up <span class="caps">EVERY DAY AND</span> ON <span class="caps">TIME</span>! Not taking off &#8216;cause of that hangover the cheap booze left you with last night.</p>
<p>I firmly believe in welfare   &mdash;   but welfare for which you have to do <span class="caps">SOME </span>useful work for your community. In short, welfare, <span class="caps">YES, </span>free ride, NO! Those physically or mentally unable   &mdash;   if a doctor says they can&rsquo;t work, that&rsquo;s an entirely different story.</p>
<p>You might find my views a bit radical, Robert Lindsay, but think about it   &mdash;   before generalizing us AmRen readers in the tone you used. We might be racist and unfeeling to you, but we firmly believe America IS <span class="caps">NOT OBLIGATED </span>to accept 30 million Hispanic poor people   &mdash;   from Mexico or any other Latin American or Caribbean country. That <span class="caps">OUR </span>own should get first crack at jobs. That jobs should be required by law, to pay a minimum salary (i.e., no loopholes or dodges like forcing workers to count on tips, for example).</p>
<p>Also that American working poor <span class="caps">SHOULD </span>get help from local government agencies   &mdash;   without stigma, if they are working but forced to work for an unreasonably low wage. But <span class="caps">NOT, </span>emphatically <span class="caps">NOT </span>illegal aliens or American-born parasites and freeloaders to whom welfare handouts is a cultural way of life.</p>

<p>&gt; I really must disagree with you, Strider.  Where do you get that?  It is well known in the NY Jewish community for example that they typically dreamt of retiring in Florida to get away from crime, and blacks too.  Your comments are based on broad uninformed assumptions, such as all Jews must be communists, etc., - far from the truth.</p>

					<p>You have covered all of this subject well&hellip;violence is coming when the &#8220;gravytrain&#8221; ends.  We are a broke nation of wornout taxpayers and they (the same groups as always demand entitlements), always want more.</p>
<p>Get ready, prepare, vote for freedom and arm yourself to protect your loved ones.</p>

					<p>New Orleans redux.  These appear to be the same type of dismal, weird people.  The pandering shots of the &#8220;sad little children&#8221; in the slideshow just leave me cold.  My only thought now is that if these people can&rsquo;t house and feed their children, they shouldn&rsquo;t have given birth to them in the first place.  I just don&rsquo;t care about their offspring anymore.</p>

					<p>&#8220;I sure as hell hate seeing 30 million criminal illegal aliens flood our country. Then the male takes a $6 or $8 dollar an hour job; the female works in the fast food slop franchises  &mdash;  and goes to the welfare office with her sob-story about Jose left her and her seven kids for another woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>Variations on this scam are extremely common. My brother-in-law supervises welders, many of them Mexicans, in a suburban machine shop. Management fired several of the mestizos for phony documents, and have recently found, to my utter lack of surprise, that many others have lied about the number of dependant children they&rsquo;ve got on their tax forms. Which is in effect merely another welfare rip-off. Why on earth do such people deserve subsidized housing, sympathy, or anything other than a free bus ride back to sunny Mexico?</p>

					<p>Hi, kitty here!  I&rsquo;m one of those low-income whites (at least right now), but I take no assistance and have never attempted to.  I never feel &#8220;put down&#8221; on this website.</p>

					<p>Boca Raton (&#8220;Mouse Mouth&#8221;) is only 3.8% black. But 90 percent of those lined up for the government &ldquo;housing voucher&rdquo; hand-outs were black. So once again you see the government carrying out ethnic displacement/cleansing of yet another non-black (=safe) community by flooding it with blacks who did not have to work for the homes they will be given, unlike the present residents who had to <span class="caps">WORK, EARN </span>and <span class="caps">SACRIFICE </span>in order to buy a home and live there. To add insult to injury, the government uses the tax-dollars of those working present residents to subsidize the destruction of their own neighborhood, putting them and their loved one&rsquo;s lives in grave danger in the process. As a representative cross-section of blacks flood in the crime and violence, often racial in nature, will drive the non-blacks out, who will loose their life savings they tied up in their homes they sacrificed for in order to have a safe place for themselves and their family.</p>

					<p> This site just seethes with hatred for low income and poor Whites. You don&rsquo;t spell it that way, but when you cast aspersion on the poor and low income, you condemn millions of your White brethren. Shame on you.</p>

<p>Robert:  I never thought I&rsquo;d see the day when <span class="caps">ANYONE </span>would accuse AmRener&rsquo;s of that.  As far as being concerned about the plight of  millions of poor and low-income Whites, you&rsquo;d do well to research <span class="caps">NAFTA, </span>the <span class="caps">WTO, </span>and <span class="caps">GATT, </span>those responsible for our immigration policies, the abject failure to secure American borders from the Mestizo invasion, the hate-Whitey control of our media, and those responsible for your living amongst your once-celebrated, now-despised dearth-of-whites diversity you&rsquo;re notorious for.  </p>
<p>I hold out hope for you, Robert.  Living amongst the glorious diversity (as I know from your <span class="caps">OWN </span>writings that you do) can heal many a plagued, liberal soul and cure the disease of Cultural Marxism.       </p>

					<p>No, they sure don&rsquo;t look like they&rsquo;re starving. Of course they always counter with the excuse that high calorie junk food is cheaper than healthier foods, although it isn&rsquo;t true at all, a bag of beans, carrots, or potatoes is not that expensive. They over indulge, on junkfood and blame it on poverty. Poverty must also explain why most of them have not missed a trip to the beauty parlor to get their hair relaxed or some elaborate weaves, not to mention their sculpted, manicured fingernails.</p>

					<p>There is also a video on the Palm Beach Post website, that is even more eye opening:<br>
http://www.palmbeachpost.com/localnews/content/south/epaper/2008/03/12/0312vouchers.html</p>
<p>In addition to the tribal behavior and attitudes, as other posters have mentioned, none apparently seem to be missing a meal.  They would not be so fat and disgusting if they&rsquo;d get off their butts and work.  Also, couldn&rsquo;t help but notice despite being poor (cry ME a river, why don&rsquo;t ya), they have clean, stylish clothes and bling bling, top of the line baby strollers, and apparently travel well, judging from the one big fat black lady complaining from her late model <span class="caps">SUV.</span></p>
<p>Another pet peeve- have you ever noticed they bring their entire extended family whereever they go?  Leave granny at home with the chillens while you <span class="caps">LOOK FOR</span> A <span class="caps">JOB</span>!!!!  With all of their friends and neighbors apparently not working, certainly at least a few of them could provide <span class="caps">HOME DAY CARE </span>for other neighbors, so some could work outside the home as well.  Rather than <span class="caps">EARNING </span>their income, they&rsquo;re content to live up to the stereotypes and then complain about racism.</p>

<p>Uh, what part of &#8220;regardless of their religion&#8221; did you not understand? You&rsquo;re the one assuming all the &#8220;condo commies&#8221; in SE Florida are Jewish. I know nothing of their religious demographics, and (most importantly) I don&rsquo;t care. What matters is that they&rsquo;re leftists. All leftists are equally dangerous, whether they&rsquo;re Jews, Christians, Muslims, Hindus or Druids.</p>
<p><span class="caps">FYI, </span>there are more registered Democrats in Broward County alone than in the state&rsquo;s 28 westernmost counties <i>combined</i>   &mdash;   and that includes the Democrat bastion of Leon County (Tallahassee). If not for them, Florida would be a solid &#8220;red&#8221; state rather than a &#8220;swing&#8221; state. Maybe they truly wanted to escape crime and blacks, but thanks to their political leanings they helped create those same problems down here; hence the term &#8220;enablers.&#8221; </p>
<p>Much the same thing has happened in New Hampshire   &mdash;   hordes of liberal &#8220;tax refugees&#8221; from neighboring states have moved in, only to vote for higher taxes to pay for more liberal social programs. Now NH   &mdash;   which Nixon carried in 1960   &mdash;   has gone &#8220;blue.&#8221; So much for &#8220;live free or die.&#8221; Also further proof that leftists&rsquo; political baggage is just as negative as the cultural baggage of blacks and Hispanics.</p>

					<p>Did they import these people from New Orleans, they seem to have so much in common, vastly overweight, multiple illegitimate children, loud mouths screaming for something they did not earn, the liberal policies of the past 4 decades have created a totally new breed, and it is dysfunctional beyound belief.</p>
