<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>There was a time when patriotism and an outsize love of country was a given in anyone running for president of the United States. Not any more. Barack Obama and his wife have demonstrated that being black means never having to say you&rsquo;re sorry about your &mdash; or your fellow blacks&rsquo; &mdash; conditional love for America.</p>
<p>At two Wisconsin rallies last month, Michelle Obama declared, &#8220;For the first time in my adult lifetime, I&rsquo;m really proud of my country.&#8221;</p>
<p>For such transparent civic disdain, a white candidate&rsquo;s wife would have been made to crawl over broken glass to beg forgiveness, and both would have babbled endlessly on about her unconditional love for her country. Not the Obamas. For all his vaunted humility, Obama never really admits wrong-doing. Obama &#8220;clarified&#8221; Michelle&rsquo;s remarks, then Michelle &#8220;clarified&#8221; her remarks. Neither apologized.</p>
<p>Then on Tuesday, Obama delivered a major speech in Philadelphia to quell public indignation around the incendiary anti-Americanism of his spiritual mentor and erstwhile campaign team member, Jeremiah A. Wright, pastor of Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama has willingly identified himself with Wright&rsquo;s vision for 20 years. Wright married the Obamas and baptized their two children. Yet this church is the very antithesis of what you would expect as the spiritual home of a man running on his ability to heal divisions and transcend racial identity.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Which brings us to the pith of the matter. Obama has been planning his bid for the glittering prize for years. He&rsquo;s supposedly a canny fellow. How did he fail to realize that his separatist church (in which his own white mother would not be welcome) and racist pastor were going to be a huge political liability to him? Why didn&rsquo;t he quietly drop out a year ago, and &mdash; here&rsquo;s a radical thought &mdash; join a church that reflects his public persona: a church that encourages and attracts a mixed membership of blacks and whites, and whose pastor preaches unity and race-blindness.</p>
<p>That he stayed at Trinity United suggests he and his wife felt morally comfortable in that pew. We must conclude that until they saw his effect on others, they didn&rsquo;t see anything wrong with the church or with Wright.</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s instinct to escape personal censure for a stunningly poor choice of mentor and religious institution speaks to a troubling sense of personal entitlement. Americans&rsquo; unwillingness to accept such behaviour for what it is speaks to the soft bigotry of low expectations.</p>
<p>I am reminded by this episode of another such Democratic presidential candidate&rsquo;s hypocritical sanctimony: &#8220;I smoked, but I didn&rsquo;t inhale.&#8221; Bill Clinton got a pass on a single joint (although not without sustained ridicule).</p>
<p>Nobody can smoke institutionalized vulgarity for 20 years without inhaling. And no white candidate&rsquo;s career would survive the shame of it. Obama&rsquo;s rhetoric transcends racial division in America. White Americans&rsquo; guilt-fuelled reluctance to condemn Obama&rsquo;s failings and selective silence embodies it.<br>

					<p>I want to thank Rev. White to waking up the white voters who were leaning toward Obama. Through Wright, we are starting to see Obama&rsquo;s true color and agenda. Thankfully, many blacks have the natural ability to shoot their foot off with their mouth. In this case Wright shot his own foot off and got Obama&rsquo;s as well.</p>

I can&rsquo;t understand this issue of Obama&rsquo;s pastor. March 2008, in the middle of a campaign Obama &#8220;repudiates&#8221; certain things his pastor said in the past. Why didn&rsquo;t obama stand up and say something 5 years ago? 15 years ago? How could Mr. Obama sit through 20 years worth of &#8220;why we should hate whitey&#8221; lectures unless he was in substantial agreement? that Obama now &#8220;repudiates&#8221; what the pastor said only proves he knows the right thing to say in the middle of a campaign. <br><br>
In his &#8220;blame whitey&#8221; speech, he says <br><br>
&#8220;I could no more dis-own Pastor Wright than i could dis-own the Black race&#8221; <br><br>
really? then it&rsquo;s reasonable to believe Obama identifies closely with Pastor Wight&rsquo;s beliefs too. <br><br>
How does obama separate the man from his beliefs? this is like the Jews embracing Hitler while &#8220;repudiating&#8221; that whole ovens thing <br><br>
The title of Obama&rsquo;s next book: &#8220;The Audacity of Hypocrisy&#8221; or &#8220;The Dreams of my Opportunism&#8221; <br><br>
it gets more confusing. before, Pastor Wright is described by Obama as his closest personal advisor. After, Obama says: &#8220;I knew him, I knew him as a man from the church&#8221;. Quite a fall from grace eh Mr. Wright? now go stand in the box with Al and Jesse till after the election! </p>
<p><span class="caps">VOTE FOR OBAMA</span>! A <span class="caps">MAN FOR</span> 13% OF <span class="caps">THE PEOPLE</span>! <br>

					<p>No doubt.  A Fox News reporter (a white woman) was already making excuses for Write, saying she could not judge him because she is not black.  She also said, Write might have faced so much discrimination in his life that maybe we shouldn&rsquo;t blame him for his anger towards America, but rather try to understand it.</p>
<p>Yep, right on cue.</p>

					<p>We read and heard the racist, anti-White rantings by Jeremiah Wright. we read and heard Obama trying to &#8216;distance&#8221; himself from Wright   &mdash;   without offending his brother Blacks but trying to placate the perceived White enemies.</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s fine-sounding rhetoric said <span class="caps">ABSOLUTELY NOTHING</span>! Wht? Because what actually did he say   &mdash;   beyond admitting there are race-based differences?</p>
<p>Take the comment on White anger over forced busing! Why did Obama fail to address the basis for that White anger? That the intention of forced busing was to provide a better education for Blacks. What forced busing <span class="caps">ACTUALLY DID </span>was to <span class="caps">LOWER THE QUALITY</span> OF <span class="caps">EDUCATION FOR WHITES</span>! Visit a classroom with at least half the students being Black   &mdash;   you&rsquo;ll quickly understand my comment.</p>
<p>With respect to Affirmative Action   &mdash;   Obama sidestepped the real reason for White outrage. Affirmative action primarily <span class="caps">SERVES</span> TO <span class="caps">LOWER THE BAR </span>  &mdash;   <span class="caps">FOR BLACKS</span>! By often giving Blacks preference to more intelligent or better-qualified Whites!</p>
<p>I refer to Barak Obama as &#8220;PHONY <span class="caps">OBAMA.</span>&#8221; With damned good reason, I think. The man talk being as empty and as insubstantial as a rainbow! Pretty to look at (or to listen to)   &mdash;   but utterly devoid of real meaning. This is the man who is expected to bridge the chasm between the races? The man to lead not only our America   &mdash;   but also the world?</p>

					<p>Here&rsquo;s the test:  would I, as a white male, be made to feel comfortable and would I be welcomed into Obama&rsquo;s church.  The answer is no.  It&rsquo;s a snakepit of seething racial hatred.  Obama is not the healer that he&rsquo;s portrayed himself to be.</p>

					<p>I simply cannot believe that so many Americans - make that white Americans - are stunned at this Obamination.  Most blacks - and I mean most like in the range of 99.9% - feel the same way as Barack &amp; Michelle Obama and Jeremiah Wright.  Blacks refusal to acknowledge the genuinely good things whites have done for them is the epitome of their indifference.  It&rsquo;s not have we&rsquo;ve done, it&rsquo;s what we still have to do.  That neverending list of retribution.  All the things we still must do as punishment for things we haven&rsquo;t done.  All the exaggerations and lies, the accusations and threats, the constant beating of the war drum is nothing new, the decision to finally see it for what it really is - well, is new.  Whitey, wake up and smell the hatred, for it ain&rsquo;t ever going away!!!<br>

					<p>So far, no one in the media is pointing out the blindingly obvious. Yes, they will mention that perhaps Obama went to the Trinity church to validate his blackness, to build a political base among South Chicago&rsquo;s biggest and most important black church. He&rsquo;s half black and half white, so he goes to the uber-black church to prove his genuine core blackness.</p>
<p>But what about Wright himself? In photos cheek by cheek with Obama, it&rsquo;s obvious he has even more of that nasty evil white blood flowing in his veins.  He is even less black than Obama, who at least had a full-blooded Kenyan African father.  Wright is probably only 1/4 black.</p>
<p>So what is Wright&rsquo;s story? How did he come to be the ranting screaming white hater?  Is it also a case of &#8220;proving&#8221; his essential blackness, in spite of his very light skin, by screaming most loudly his hatred of the white race?</p>
<p>There is some serious social pathology here, both in Wright and Obama.</p>

					<p>Many white liberals support Obama in the hope his election will appease black anger once and for all. Our experience however in America is that blacks are only peaceful sadly when oppressed and not when gaining power. As a matter of fact blacks are the only race that newly acquired civil rights and properity only lead to incredibly high rates of violence. South Africa has experienced the same phenomenon. The odd anamoly with blacks is that as their income increases so do their their rates of immorality increases(crime and illegitimacy). </p>

					<p>Perhaps the most infuriating aspect of this whole fiasco, is how many Whites, particularly those of the movement conservative/neocon talking head(and their listeners/viewers) set, are <span class="caps">FAR </span>more put-out by the anti-American sentiment than anything whatever to do with race! Over and over again, I have heard everyone from Lou Dobbs to Loudmouth <span class="caps">O&rsquo;R</span>eiley, Hannity, et al and back bemoan all this dastardly anti-Americanism, while bending over backward to play-down the race-issue.(as if they don&rsquo;t know that this alleged anti-Americanism is just anti-White hatred by another name - they hate <span class="caps">WHITE</span> America&hellip;or Whites period) </p>
<p>America as it stands right now, is an <span class="caps">ENEMY </span>of our(White) people! If anyone should be leveling intense criticism against what this country has become, in public and private sector alike, it is enlightened <span class="caps">WHITES</span>!! Thus, all this misplaced jingoism not only rings hollow with me, but it seriously detracts from the <span class="caps">REAL </span>issue here, which is 100% about race. <br>
That even the Whites who are supposed be at least cautiously wise to all this Leftist racial flim-flam are so utterly clueless, basically speaks volumes about just how far gone this country really is. </p>

					<p>The National Post is the only Canadian newspaper that would print this kind of commentary, and I&rsquo;m quite proud to see it on AmRen. As with the majority of leftist American papers, Canadian media coverage of Obama&rsquo;s speech was effusively swooning, comparing the speech to the Gettysburg address or some of the soaring and beautiful language employed by Thomas Jefferson!!! I don&rsquo;t know why this kind of mindless adulation of a well spoken but, except for his blackness, ordinary, lying and disingenous politician/lawyer still suprises me. All Obama did, as others have noted, what the bait/switch game. He changed the context of the discussion and thereby avoided the crucial questions tis controversy raised. As a bonus he managed to blame Whites for Wright&rsquo;s sickening views; they are a result of justified black rage.</p>

					<p>So, Obama, whilst &#8220;rejecting&#8221; the beliefs of this &#8220;Pastor&#8221;, stands by him as to do otherwise would mean him rejecting his black community?</p>
<p>Well, in Ireland they have a saying - &#8220;You can tell a man who boozes by the company he choses&#8221;.</p>
<p>Obama has been shown for what he is. An anti-white, racist, snake oil salesman. </p>

					<p>The 2008 presidential race was a shoe in for Democrats this year. The key word being &#8216;was&rsquo;. It was all but assured. A done deal.</p>
<p>A Democratic victory in 2008 right now is in serious doubt. Who could have screwed this up? A black man. Worse, he doesn&rsquo;t even realize it.</p>
<p>If Barack Obama was a true Democrat and a team player he would bow out at this point. He cannot win. If he did that, Democrats would once again become the &#8216;shoe ins&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Will he do this? Of course not! That&rsquo;s not what Blacks do. Another good example is Kwame in Detroit. A Black will almost always hang on despite their obvious incompetence and other Blacks will support them despite their obvious incompetence. Its amazing really. The arguments they present to support their case usually ends up digging the hole deeper for them.</p>
<p>Barack Obama said in his speech that his White grandmother was afraid to run into Blacks in public. No kidding. So would anyone else with half a brain. Now he says its because she didn&rsquo;t know them. Balony. It was because he they were Black!</p>
<p>Its because she didn&rsquo;t know them, huh? Barack Obama doesn&rsquo;t even realize the silliness of this argument. He expects people to buy it.</p>
<p>Wow!</p>

					<p>The usual double standard is perfectly obvious here, as the reporter notes. It&rsquo;s odd that no one in the media has asked the logical question: exactly which elements of this church&rsquo;s &#8220;unabashedly Afrocentric&#8221; doctrines does B. Hussein Obama embrace? We&rsquo;ve heard all sorts of foggy, sentimental pseudo-statements about what he <strong>doesn&rsquo;t</strong> believe, but it is safe to assume that a church Obama attended weekly for twenty years held some kind of allure for him beyond the disco music and circus costumes of the pastor and choir. What was the basis of Trinity&rsquo;s appeal for the would-be first couple?</p>

					<p>I also would like to thank Rev (bigot) Wright for getting the attention of many comatose white voters.  The thing that surprises me is that many whites are surprised by this language&hellip;what naive fools we have in this country.</p>
<p>Thanks Rev, keep the hate moving and demonstrating what the &#8220;real black agenda&#8221; is.</p>

					<p>Obama is a a racist pig and what is typical of blacks and black politicians.  They are self contradicting, illogical, emotional, directionless, and expert liars.  They blame every failing of their race and themselves on perceived injustices that occurred hundreds and hundreds of years ago to people whom they have never met.  What sort of leader would someone like this make. Maybe like Eddi Amin Dada.  Elect Obama so the black man can do for America what he has done for Africa.   </p>

					<p>While I agree with the posts I see so far, I hope that readers can see the flaw in the &#8220;my country, right or wrong&#8221; as inflected by Kay in the beginning of her article.  We would be far too easily led if all a corrupt leader needs to do is call on our patiotism and knee-jerk compliant patriotism - something that has been done in the past too often - and too our great loss.  Similarly, thoughtless patiotism can lead to the embrace of Hitlerian leaders, who when the cause crumbles due to insane management, turns on his own &#8220;beloved&#8221; people and murders them.</p>

					<p>Many missed the ulterior cleverness of Obama&rsquo;s speech - that of attempting to redefine Reverend Wright&rsquo;s vile diatribes against America into only bitter, understandable, perhaps even forgivable reactions to long-standing white racism.</p>
<p>But racism was hardly Wright&rsquo;s main offense - Reverend Wright&rsquo;s real revelation is his deep and virulent hatred for this country. </p>
<p>Therefore the part of Obama&rsquo;s speech everyone should notice and not forget is his absolute refusal to cut the umbilical cord, to fully disassociate himself from this contemptable anti-american demogogue and his continuing influence on his own life. </p>
<p>That refusal makes it America&rsquo;s burden that Obama remains a Senator - let alone get elected as President of the United States.   </p>

					<p>I just saw a movie on Jesus last weekend and was struck anew by the company that he kept and the tolerance that he had.  Obama is certainly not Jesus, but if you truly wish to bridge the divide between whites and blacks, which he truly does.  You do not cut yourself off from the extremes, you appreciate what is good in them, black or white, and understand their anger and pain.<br>
What counts is not Rev. Wright&rsquo;s words and heart.<br><br>
What counts is Obama&rsquo;s words and heart.  And there is no evidence that he has &#8220;inhaled&#8221; the hateful portion of the otherwise admirable church work done at his church.  Only a politically correct politician would cut off all controversial associations.  And such a politician would be unlikely to be able to actually bridge the gap.<br><br>
It is usually true that &#8220;Where there is smoke there is fire&#8221;, but look at Obama and find <span class="caps">ANYTHING </span>that suggests he is anti-white or anti-black.  You will see the opposite.  He is generally the best of both.</p>

					<p>I&rsquo;m not mad at Barack Obama for not sincerely apologizing for Wright&rsquo;s anti-white racism. Nor am I angry at the conservative lemmings for not demanding a sincere apology. No. I&rsquo;m ticked off at all the honkies, especially the rich powerful ones, who have supported Obama &hellip; and continue to support him!!! </p>

					<p>Thank God White America now knows what kind of guy it&rsquo;s dealing with. It is impossible to attend a church for 20 years and not know the anti-White and anti-American beliefs of their pastor. For him in his much adored &#8220;speech&#8221; to suggest that is an insult to our intelligence.</p>
<p>I have had an dark, uneasy feeling about Obama almost since I first heard him speak several years ago. Now we know the truth. Do some research on this guy. For &#8220;all his adult life&#8221; he has had associations with  communists(Frank Davis, who he mentions in his book) and anti-Amercian anarchists(William Ayers of the Weather Underground and with whom his campaign spokesperson described their relationship as &#8220;friendly&#8221;). </p>
<p>It makes me ill to think he was almost elected by millions and millions of unsuspecting, naive White supporters - who, when asked,  could never tell you anything productive(for his country)the guy has ever done. A blank resume&rsquo;. Maybe this will give the liberal White masses is Iowa and Utah(and a few other nearly all-White states he won) something to think about.  </p>

					<p>i think thousands and thousands of white people should unite and attend reverend wrights church every sunday, as many as we can muster, just overwhelm it. sit there in silence and listen to the sermon. more or less just disolve it. swarm technique.</p>

					<p>As my father used to say - you can take a black out of Africa, dress him up, and send him to school, but ever so often the African will come through.  Whites beware - watch for the snake in the grass.  Hopefully, this all came out in time to keep this slick con from being voted into the White House.</p>
<p>In the case of Wright and Obama, both have a lot of Caucasian ancestry, but both claim themselves as black.  Why don&rsquo;t they identify with their whiteness?  Unfortunately, the one drop rule is true.</p>
<p>As far as whites being dazzled by Obama&rsquo;s oratory skills, I could have told them that was a bunch of garbage a long time ago.  My spouse and were watching Nightline a few years back and Cornell West appeared with some imagined grievance about white injustices against blacks.  Listening to him speak, I was somewhat awed by his large vocubulary and polished oratory prowess.  But upon closer listening, I realized what he was saying was incoherent and didn&rsquo;t make any sense.  All he was doing was spewing out a bunch of 50 cent words.</p>
<p>Many white people marvel at this from a black because their altruistic nature makes them start thinking &#8220;listen at that - he/she really is my equal.&#8221;  But, if whites listen more closely to what blacks say they will notice the message doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>

<p>Following the chronology of posts on a particular point by any black who comes on here will reveal the same thing.  More often than not I&rsquo;ve read silliness from a black on here who can put a few sentences together but his thinking processes are blaringly inadequate.</p>
<p>For example, in rebuttal to a white charge about the epidemic of black, everyday crime in this country, we&rsquo;re more apt to read a black rebuttal, claiming our complaints doesn&rsquo;t have a leg to stand on because Hitler was white and killed millions of people, not understanding that their response is an apples and oranges dissimilarity.</p>
<p>When Jared Taylor went on the Queen Latifah show, expounding on the black crime rate, an obese black woman with an angry look got up and said in reponse to the prevalence of everyday black crime throughoput the country that serial killers were mostly white.  Her comments drew a heavy round of applause among the blacks in the room, making them out to be a mob that was applauding their own stupidity.  The subject to them was closed, because they believed they had proven that white serial killers amounted to the equivalent of widespread and numerous black crime.</p>
<p>It goes on and on, and even their best and brightest are inept.  Those who re-read Obama&rsquo;s speech will see the contradictions in his reasoning in certain paragraphs.</p>
<p>Blacks are just not far enough along the evolutionary scale as the rest of the world.  </p>

					<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Why didn&rsquo;t Obama stand up and say something 5 years ago? 15 years ago? How could Mr. Obama sit through 20 years worth of &ldquo;why we should hate whitey&rdquo; lectures unless he was in substantial agreement?</p>
<p>And <span class="caps">THOSE </span>are the unanswered questions which will <span class="caps">END </span>the dream of Obama to become a Black President. Why? Because the <span class="caps">ONLY </span>rational answer being that Obama essentially concurred with Wright!!! </p>
<p>Surely anyone somewhat brighter than a turnip would realize that attending sermons by a Black racist preacher repeatedly ranting about Whites and thereby inciting more hatred of Whites   &mdash;   would surely surface sooner or later. Would come back to haunt. To irreparably damage his campaign and his image.</p>
<p>It always comes back to the beginning of the circLe, doesn&rsquo;t it? If a White politician or other public figure makes a racial slip   &mdash;   he gets hounded unmercifully   &mdash;   by Blacks <span class="caps">AND </span>the pandering media! </p>
<p>Yet Blacks want, demand a double standard   &mdash;   a standard which can be defined as:</p>
<p><span class="caps">BLACKS DEMAND</span> TO BE <span class="caps">HELD</span> TO A <span class="caps">LOWER STANDARD</span> OF <span class="caps">BEHAVIOR, SPEECH AND ACCOUNTABIITY COMPARED</span> TO <span class="caps">STANDARDS SET FOR WHITES</span>!</p>
<p>Blacks want, even demand that all standards relating not only to ethics, but also academic, professional and behavioral standards   &mdash;   be lowered for them ON <span class="caps">THE BASIS</span> OF <span class="caps">THEIR RACE</span>! Still they can&rsquo;t understand why Whites consider them inferior to Whites. <span class="caps">THINK ABOUT THAT ONE</span>!</p>
