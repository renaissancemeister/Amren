<p>I submit [Governor Bill] Richardson knew, even as he basked in Clinton&rsquo;s supplication, that he would eventually &mdash; treacherously &mdash; endorse Obama. Richardson&rsquo;s public statement justifying the Obama endorsement proves as much.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a Hispanic .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.,&#8221; Richardson explained, &#8220;race trumps everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh wait, the &#8220;race trumps everything&#8221; part was from Willie Brown, the former San Francisco mayor, longtime speaker of the California assembly, and a black man, spelling out to the Washington Post why black voters have so embraced Obama, even against the legacy of the Clintons. &#8220;I think most white politicians do not understand that the race pride we all have trumps everything else,&#8221; explained Willie Brown.</p>
<p>Does Bill Richardson&rsquo;s race pride, too, trump everything else? Is even the debt he owes the Clintons, whose patronage it was in the first place that made him a national figure capable of commanding a public plea for support from a former president &mdash; is even that debt trumped by race pride?</p>
<p>It would appear so, judging by the reason Richardson gave nearly a year ago for why he supported former US Attorney General Alberto Gonzales even as his co-ethnic was (deservedly) going down in flames. &#8220;As a Hispanic .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.,&#8221; began Richardson&rsquo;s explanation for his support for Gonzales.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But with Richardson&rsquo;s endorsement of Barack Obama, I wonder now whether I was even being represented secondarily. In the email announcing his Obama endorsement, Richardson wrote, &#8220;As a Hispanic, I was particularly touched by [Obama&rsquo;s Reverend Wright speech]. I have been troubled by the demonization of immigrants &mdash; specifically Hispanics &mdash; by too many in this country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Demonization? The big national debate over immigration is about enforcement of our immigration laws. Is support for the enforcement of our immigration laws what Richardson terms &#8220;demonization?&#8221; Was it me and the eight out of ten Americans who support the enforcement of our immigration laws whom Richardson was attacking as demonizers?</p>
<p>If so, then I was represented in Congress for half a decade by an enemy, a threat to the rule of law, and a racial demagogue not fit to hold public office.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The only demonization I&rsquo;ve run across lately, in fact, is the demonization of white people by the rabid Reverend Wright &mdash; the hatemonger who led to Christ the half-black candidate for the presidency that the treacherous half-Hispanic governor of New Mexico just endorsed on racial grounds.<br>

					<p>I find this quite puzzling.  Even though I know there are millions of crazed whites who are hellbent on racial suicide, there is still a large anough section to counter the blocks of blacks, browns,yellows, and loonie race-traiting white trying their best to tip the scales.  You can&rsquo;t keep this pot of caustic materials over an open flame and not expect an eventual explosion.  Will it ever recover.  I say no.  It can&rsquo;t remover any more than it can heal.<br>

					<p>I&rsquo;m far more troubled by the demonization of America by racist black and hispanic groups and the high and intolerable black-on-white and hispanic-on-white crime rates than I am about people bashing invaders.  The invaders can go home.  Also, the racist Obama&rsquo;s and Richardson need to be told that <span class="caps">ALL PEOPLE HAVE CIVIL RIGHTS </span>- not just them.</p>

					<p> Craig&rsquo;s views match mine perfectly. When Richardson made his announcement that &#8220;As a Hispanic&#8221; he was stabbing Bill and Hillary in the back, the first thing I thought was, &#8220;You ungrateful skunk! If it weren&rsquo;t for them, you wouldn&rsquo;t be much better known than one of these half-Indian stoop laborers that stream across the Rio Grande every night!&#8221;</p>
<p> I hold no brief for the Clintons, but I know a traitor when I see one. Wonder if he grew that mustache and goatee to look more like Pancho Villa   &mdash;   er, to look more &#8220;As a Hispanic&#8221;? Wonder what Obama has promised Richardson in return for his endorsement? My guess is, secretary of state.</p>
<p> In conclusion, I would remind Bill and Hillary of Harry Truman&rsquo;s famous quote: &#8220;If you want a friend in Washington, buy a dog.&#8221;</p>

					<p>&ldquo;I think most white politicians do not understand that the race pride we all have trumps everything else,&rdquo; explained Willie Brown.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s right, of course.  He could also say that most white Americans don&rsquo;t yet fully realize that race trumps everything among non-whites.  He could have added that, &#8220;However, most whites don&rsquo;t understand that we expect you to refrain from adopting this same view.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the very most important thing for all white Americans to realize and especially politicians is that the open doors policy, the love and tolerance policy, the multicultural policy, the multiracial policy, of allowing non-whites into the country has resulted in, for the most part, among most non-whites,  jealousy of us, resentment of us&hellip;&hellip;.. even dislike and hatred of us&hellip;&hellip;.. so much so, they have included all of themselves under one umbrella when it comes to whites. They have become anti-white adversaries that seek to diminish white influence and power any way they can. </p>
<p>Allowing third world peons into a society that has well-to-do whites who have had years to establish themselves and who are above the non-white average in intelligence and can therefore acquire more and accomplish more, and therefore have more, is just inviting resentment and hate.</p>
<p>The leftist radicals who advocate everything beneficial to non-whites at the expense of whites see these third worlders as peons who are awed and greatful to their great white supporters and are cluless of the fact that they are resented and even hated.  When it is brought to their attention they call the person informing them a racist or a hater, so dense are they and blinded by their own visions of self-importance.  The Clintons are learning these facts right now.</p>
<p> Classism is just as great a danger to the peace and tranquility as racism, and when crime and poverty is imported a nation has both.  Eventually the downtrodden masses will get tired of being outdone, of seeing only whites in power, of only whites having nice things, all flaunted in their faces, and they don&rsquo;t care that the disparity exists because whites being established in our society for a much longer period of time than they, and they certainly won&rsquo;t admit they&rsquo;re not on an intellectual par with whites.  </p>
<p>How long has Richardson held his grudge?  How long has he longed for a society where mestizos were not the failures, and, in his view, the arrogant whites were not the power and influence?  Probably most of his life.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no surprise this vile racist figuratively spit in the faces of the Clintons.  After all, no matter how radically to the left they are, after all, they <span class="caps">ARE </span>white.</p>
<p>The only ones who have been unaware of such white hatred are fools like the Clintons.  And isn&rsquo;t it payback time for many whites who have been deserted by both these people in favor of non-white support when they see how their non-white supporters are flipping them off in favor of a cherished non-white like themselves?</p>

					<p>All the world is a stage and we are merely players!  Bill Richardson looks quite White to me.  Although the article says he is &#8220;half-Hispanic&#8221; I would venture to guess he is something like 70% or 80% European ancestry.  I think Bill Richardson needs to get in touch with his European roots instead of trumpeting like an arrogant fool about Hispanics.  If he is going to pay so much lip service to his Amerindian side he can at least wear a &#8220;White Pride World Wide&#8221; shirt a couple days a week.  </p>
<p>Seriously though, he talks like this because Hispanic people at this time and for whatever reasons have a lot more fight in them that White people do.  Just look at how millions of them marched in the streets a couple of years ago and how virtually no Whites counter marched against them.  Like a typical politician, Bill is on the bandwagon of the louder and brassier people. </p>
<p>According to articles on the web, 30% of US born Hispanic men and women are married to people outside their own ethnic group.  All the Hispanics I have seen in mixed marriages are married to Whites.  I am sure many of these people wish Bill Richardson would shut his mouth.  </p>
<p>After reading an incredibly disparaging and factually flawed &#8220;essay&#8221; on the web about the genetic make-up of Mexicans, I checked out some Wiley-Interscience abstracts on the subject.  Although it&rsquo;s a bit off topic here, I think as we ponder Bill Richardson&rsquo;s behavior it is worth keeping in mind that tens of millions of Mexican people have strong European genetic roots.  As I recall, in three northern states of Mexico, <span class="caps">DNA </span>analysis showed that the average person profiled had close to 60% European ancestry.  <span class="caps">DNA </span>from Mexicans in poor neighborhoods around Mexico City averaged just a hair under 40% European ancestry with 5 to 8% African ancestry and the rest Amerindian.  The people in northern Mexico were 1 to 3% African on average.  In stark contrast to northern Mexico, the southern most states there is almost exclusively Amerindian with the average person being 98% of native stock.  </p>
<p>Fred Reed wrote something to the effect that parts of Mexico have really improved because a lot of low class people immigrated to the <span class="caps">US. </span> That reminded me of a similar thought expressed by a White Southerner from 50 years ago when he observed that the black migration to the north was a blessing and great relief to the south.  I hope Fred is at least partially wrong in his prediction.  This country can only take so much.  It is already like a forest fire.  </p>

					<p>I wonder what all of the White feminists think now of their four-decades-long strategy of siding with other races against &#8220;their own&#8221; White males. They&rsquo;ve now learned the hard way that &#8220;race trumps everything.&#8221; The extent of their intended damage and alienation of White males also explains why the majority of White males are voting for Obama over Hillary. The irony being, of course, that it is now White males that are using that White feminist mantra against them and siding with a black man instead of a White woman. Call it a side of Karma topped with whipped cream and a cherry. Sadly, it can also be called the annihilation of the White race. But that&rsquo;s what the White feminists wanted all along anyway. They&rsquo;ve just had to take a dose of their own medicine to get it.</p>

					<p>Bill Richardson is of white European origin, as is obvious by taking one look at him. Ironically, he is the most conservative of the Democrat candidates. He is a strong 2nd Amendment supporter and good friend of he <span class="caps">NRA. </span>(Obama is a gun-ban extremist.) Hispanics have been the strongest Clinton supporters. They certainly have no &#8220;racial loyalty&#8221; to blacks: They are much closer culturally and racially to whites, of course. Hispanic migrants especially have been on the receiving end of a lot of violence at the hands of blacks (Tifton GA massacres etc.).<br>
Here is what no doubt actually happened: Richardson was in negotiations with both the Clinton and Obama camps to see who made him the best offer before he made his endorsement. When Obama was plummeting in the polls due to widespread exposure of his Black Nazi &#8220;spiritual advisor&#8221;, and in utter desperation to save his disintegrating candidacy, he offered the vice presidency to Richardson in return for his immediate endorsement in this time of critical need. Clinton could not make this guaranteed offer to Richardson since she had gone on the record to make a first offer to Obama which she must do to keep the black vote.<br><br>
So Richardson simply went for the best offer. It&rsquo;s as mundane as that.<br><br>

					<p>From the article;<br>
&ldquo;I think most white politicians do not understand that the race pride we all have trumps everything else,&rdquo; explained Willie Brown.<br><br>
This is why the White race is doomed. Many Whites, who have much to be proud of are constantly falling over themselves to elevate worthless minorities to a superior status. These same Whites try to downgrade the accomplishments of their own race.</p>
<p>On the other hand blacks, who have done nothing to be proud of are especially proud of their race. </p>
<p>Until Whites have the same fierce pride as blacks, we will never be able to take back our own country.</p>

					<p>According to liberals like Willie Brown, when nonwhites vote along racial lines it&rsquo;s &#8220;race pride.&#8221;<br>
 When whites  do the same it&rsquo;s a hate crime.</p>
<p>And if you oppose open borders you&rsquo;re responsible for &#8220;the demonization of immigrants- specifically Hispanics.&#8221;</p>

<p>   Excellent point. However, I wouldn&rsquo;t expect these same Ivy League, privileged, white gender feminists to change their philosophy. If they didn&rsquo;t change their outlook after the <span class="caps">O.J. </span>verdict and other obvious examples, they certainly won&rsquo;t change now. We must look to the younger generation of white women to change.</p>

When that happens those same politicians will wonder why they can never get elected anymore.</p>

					<p>&ldquo;I think most white politicians do not understand that the race pride we all have trumps everything else,&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think we need to find some white politicians who DO understand this.</p>

					<p>Once white liberals, at last understand that blacks and hispanics think this way, they will abandon them.  You can&rsquo;t have a grand, marxist, multicultural revolution if the races won&rsquo;t abandon their ethnicity and unite, lol.</p>

					<p>I&rsquo;ve only met one Obama supporter and I believe that he was supporting him only because it was politically correct to do so.  Every other white who talks of the subject understands how racist and dangerous Obama is.</p>

					<p>Richardson owes the Clintons <span class="caps">NOTHING</span>! Because he worked in the administration of Bill Clinton doesn&rsquo;t mean he has to be loyal to Clintons wife!</p>
