						<p>GENEVA (AP) &mdash; Two human rights experts for the United Nations on Thursday criticized a plan by New Orleans authorities to raze public housing projects, saying it will force the predominantly black residents into homelessness.</p>
<p>They charged that demolition would harm thousands of people by denying them a place to live in a city where housing already is scarce since Hurricane Katrina hit in August 2005.</p>
<p>The joint statement was not a U.N. finding, but only the individual views of Miloon Kothari, a special investigator on housing matters for the U.N. Human Rights Council, and Gay McDougall, a lawyer who is an expert on minority and rights issues.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The high-density housing complexes for the poor were not heavily damaged by Katrina. But city officials argue the decades-old projects were a failure, becoming warrens of crime and entrenched poverty, and say they do not fit with the vision for a rebuilt New Orleans.</p>
<p>&#8220;The authorities claim that the demolition of public housing is not intentionally discriminatory,&#8221; Kothari and McDougall said, but the &#8220;predominantly African-American residents&#8221; will be denied their &#8220;internationally recognized human rights&#8221; to a home.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The U.S. mission in Geneva said much work remains to be done to help Katrina&rsquo;s victims and some criticism of the recovery effort is reasonable. But &#8220;problems in such efforts cannot be fairly described as racial discrimination or other violations of human rights,&#8221; it said.</p>

<p>No, it won&rsquo;t. The displaced black residents will end up in public/subsidized housing somewhere else, most likely Section 8 units in middle class white communities. They don&rsquo;t care where they live as long as taxpayers are footing the bill. Declaring that housing is not a human right would go a long way in getting these people off their oversized rear ends to find a job.<br>

____</p>
<p>Who said there was a human right to own a home? People have equal rights under the law, not equality. It is obvious the UN is Communist. The only problem is, under Communism, no one will want to work since they must share their work and prosperity with those who can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t work. The whole society will eventually break down as our country turns in to the likes of Haiti. </p>

<p>- Or Maybe, after a lifetime spent living off the public dole, they could get off thier dead asses and Go To Work. There is still quite a lot of clean-up/ re-building work to be done after Katrina. But that&rsquo;s silly. That would require WORK, and that would probably be a violation of thier &#8220;civil rights&#8221; in the UN&rsquo;s view.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;The high-density housing complexes for the poor were not heavily damaged by Katrina. But city officials argue the decades-old projects were a failure, becoming warrens of crime and entrenched poverty, and say they do not fit with the vision for a rebuilt New Orleans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hah! I saw those Projects (the St. Thomas, The Calliope, The Desire, The Fishcer etc&hellip;) when I lived there. Indeed, they were not heavily damaged by katrina. They were heavily damaged before Katrina by the life-long-rent-free-utility-free occupants of those buildings who, having no personal investment of any kind in thier maintenance, trashed them to the core in a matter of years. You would think having to Live there would at least instill a little pride in maintaining the appearance of the place, but no. Trash &#8216;em out then complain that they&rsquo;re trashed out is the modus operandi with these people.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t suppose the UN has even bothered to take the 1 hour drive East to coastal Mississippi which was hit much harder. No, of course they haven&rsquo;t. Those towns and neighborhoods that were totally and completely wiped out were mostly White, and have largely been cleaned up and re-building has begun BY the White inhabitants that lived there, Sans little to no help from FEMA or the FedGov let alone the Useless UN! Those people lost everything they actually WORKED for and OWNED and are cleaning it up THEMSELVES with their OWN money. When&rsquo;s the last time you saw a &#8220;sob story&#8221; about those people in the MSM?</p>
<p>A few cry-baby blacks might lose thier tax-payer provided &#8220;free&#8221; housing and the UN swoops in on a civil-rights charge?<br>
Maybe the UN could put them to work? Send them on a &#8220;Peace-Keeping mission&#8221; to Rwanda in thier beloved &#8220;Mother Africa&#8221;. they would be begging to come back home in less than a week.</p>
<p>Cry me a River Black People.<br>
Here&rsquo;s a tissue, now grow up, get to work and solve your own self-inflicted problems.  <br>

			<p>Those inner city N.O. blacks will be placed in section 8 somewhere in some white neighborhood. They won&rsquo;t be homeless, whitey will continue to subsidize them as usual. If the UN is so concerned, why doesn&rsquo;t it pay for the housing, huh? Better yet, why doesen&rsquo;t the UN just butt out?? </p>

			<p>This story reeks of the FEMA formaldehyde trailer sob story.  Formaldehyde vapors have been a fact of life in the &#8220;manufactured housing&#8221; industry for decades. And the Feds (HUD)have had hands on regulation of the &#8220;manufactured housing&#8221; industry for decades.  These vapors are a residual by-product of the polymer resin adhesive compounds used in the cheap particleboard interior paneling common in singlewide trailers.  Decent working class whites and white trash have been huffing these vapors for over 40 years.  Most of these vapors dissipate within a few months of initial occupancy of a new singlewide. The vapors in a new singlewide are more problematic if new occupancy is initiated during the winter months in a place like Minnesota for example. Otherwise, cracking some windows and running the fan are quite effective in abating the problem.  The last time I checked, it was no big deal in terms of climate for someone to do quite nicely in a pup tent in January with a summer sleeping bag for protection in Lousiana.</p>
<p>I guess nothing short of including and targeting for restoration at taxpayer expense as a National Registry of Historical Properties project every mold infested slum structure in N.O. will satisfy the UN.<br>

			<p>If they&rsquo;re that concerned, then let the UN pay for the housing expenses of the black population of New Orleans it thinks is neglected.  </p>
<p>Otherwise, as for their contention that everyone deserves a home, I have come to the conclusion that certain people, by their actions, demonstrate that they do not deserve one.</p>

			<p>Absolutely! Where does it say ANYONE has a &#8220;right&#8221; to a home? They have a &#8220;right&#8221; to BUY a home, or RENT a home, but that&rsquo;s about it. If they have a &#8220;universal right to a home&#8221; then I have the same &#8220;universal right&#8221; to have a bigger home at the same price, or a free swimming pool added on, or new siding, remodeled kitchen, etc.</p>

			<p>The displaced Whites from New Orleans have either settled elsewhere and gotten jobs, or returned to their jobs in New Orleans and rebuilt.  But the blacks are still sitting on their butts three years later with their paws out whining.  Pathetic.</p>
<p>And how do blacks have a &#8220;human right&#8221; to a home anymore than Whites or any other race?  Maybe if they still want to live in New Orleans that instead of waiting for the government to provide a free home they should get off their lazy asses and get a job and rent an apartment like everybody else.</p>

			<p>I do not understand what the UN wants. Do they want blacks to live in housing that may collapse because it was damaged by hurricane Katrina? Or do they want blacks to live in decent housing? If the second question is true, the UN must send money. Uncle sugar is broke.</p>

			<p>My mother lived near New Orleans before Katrina. Metairie was a safe haven from the project residents. She told me that the current plan is to construct mixed-use housing whereby people with different incomes can live in the same complex (welfare and all others in the same area). A grand socialist experiment. I would like to have the proponents move in first and stay there with their beloved welfare charges. Imagine that!   </p>

<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a new one on me.Perhaps you can break the news gently to the thousands upon thousands of Americans living in trailer parks, just for starters, and then get on to the millions of Indians who live on the street, not forgetting the millions of Brazillian favela-dwellers.<br>
Yes, &#8216;human-rights&rsquo; pop up like mushrooms after the rain these days.The only pity is that they have as much force as the empty rhetoric that engendered them.</p>

			<p>Who was it that made that famous quote: &#8220;Freedom is the right to work or starve.&#8221;</p>
<p>If the Blacks want better housing, let them go to work and pay for it! They&rsquo;ve freeloaded off taxpayers too long already. Time to put a real end to welfare. How? By requiring work performed to obtain welfare subsidies. By basing the amount of welfare on the amount of actual (usable) work performed!</p>
<p>The fat Black woman claiming her condition won&rsquo;t allow her to work &hellip; can babysit The men can clean streets, pick up trash and litter. Too demeaning? Too dehumanizing? Tough cookies, baby! You want to eat, you do some honest work&hellip; like us White taxpayers!</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t know about YOU, friends&hellip; me, I&rsquo;ve had it up to here with that self-pitying whine from Afro-Americans. It&rsquo;s time to stop feeling sorry for these misfits and failures and get tough with them! If they protest, hell, we can always find more jail space somewhere, I&rsquo;m sure!</p>

 &#8220;Two human rights experts for the United Nations&hellip;&#8221; What an amazing contradiction in terms! This is the UN that, under Kofi Anan, sat back and watched Rwanda self-destruct, has sat by while the Congo has rotted for decade after decade, coddled African dictators who have killed millions of their own people, failed to stop ethnic cleansing in the Balkans and now they see fit to criticize the US.<br>
 They pull this garbage because it&rsquo;s safe to attack us. In third world locales, UN offices and workers are targets as in the bombing of their first office in Iraq. This caused their retreat from Iraq as they stated it was too dangerous for them.<br>
 All this is pure political posturing as the UN&rsquo;s history has shown a willful disregard for third world peoples and a craven dislike for America.<br>
 Time to evict them from their &#8220;subsidized housing&#8221; in NY.</p>

<p>Two &#8216;experts&rsquo;, expert at redistributing the earnings from those who work to those who don&rsquo;t. When freedom of choice is removed, when charity is forcibly converted from one to give to another, the humanitarian aspect is lost, perverted into something else altogether, and entirely repugnant.</p>
<p>There is no reason at all to remain in the UN, or allow it on our soil. Not one more day, or one more dime of tribute given. If allowed to exist at all, it should always be headquartered in the nation with the greatest need. Let them see first-hand, and live among those who need them most. When they fix that nation, then they can move their offices to the next trouble spot. Sudan first.</p>

			<p>There is no right to housing, food, clothing, medical care, or any other material thing.  These supposed &#8220;rights&#8221; are simply claims on someone else&rsquo;s labor.  When these &#8220;rights&#8221; are backed by individual power, it is called &#8220;theft&#8221;, and the person who pays is called a &#8220;victim&#8221;.  When backed by government power, it is called &#8220;tyranny&#8221;, and the people who pay are called &#8220;slaves&#8221;.  </p>

			<p>     So, they have an international right to own a home ? Good, let the United Nations build them a home - like maybe in Zambia, Mali, Zaire, Liberia, etc.</p>

<p> &#8220;We should remove ourselves from this crummy organization&#8221;,,,</p>
<p> The U.S. has only itself to blame. It was responsible for creating the U.N. This was Roosevelt&rsquo;s big move. Instead of developing a rock-solid military and political plan to ensure peace and stability in Europe he spent all his time and energy on this cloud-cuckoo &#8220;Grand Design&#8221; of his. All the &#8220;peace-loving&#8221; nations of the world would join together and stroll of into the sunset holding hands and singing &#8216;Kumbaya&rsquo;. Stalin was happy to pay lip-service to anything Roosevelt said until he got the Red army into eastern Europe and then he could absorb it. Roosevelt never had a clue! Later when it became neccesarry to define a &#8220;peace-loving&#8221; nation he determined it was one that had DECLARED WAR on the Axis country(s). Unreal.</p>

			<p>As I recall, the U.N. constitution is based upon the old Soviet Constitution, and was largely penned by Alger Hiss. I may be wrong and if anyone can clarify it&rsquo;s bloodline, let me know.</p>
<p>What I do know is that in a world democracy we are a minority.<br>
The United Nations represents the ideal of a world-wide democracy.</p>
<p>I realize that the Western Elite believes [it] can control this democratic political body for its own ends.</p>
<p>Thos of us that have actually been educated n factual history might ask, &#8220;where have we seen this reasoning before?&#8221;</p>
<p>And what were the end results?</p>

			<p>&#8220;Where does it say ANYONE has a &ldquo;right&rdquo; to a home?&#8221;</p>
<p>United Nations Universal Declaration Human Rights, it&rsquo;z where:</p>
<p>Article 25.<br>
(1) Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.</p>
<p>(2) Motherhood and childhood are entitled to special care and assistance. All children, whether born in or out of wedlock, shall enjoy the same social protection</p>

<p>It would blend right in with all the foreigners and liberal politicians.</p>

			<p>  I worked routes in the black belt for years . It was very common to see young black couples in a new doublewide with a couple of new compact cars in the yard and no apparent means of affording it all . While I had a better than average job and yet it seemed we were stuck in our singlewide driving cars that had 100,000 miles or more on the odometer . We cut coupons and lived off of 99 cent bologna and wieners, while my wife stood in the checkout line behind them as they paid for buggies full of fresh meat and vegetables with stamps or a government debit card . So now they even have the UN plugging for them, well la-di-da, I&rsquo;ll cry them a river of crocodile tears . In all fairness I couldn&rsquo;t help but notice on those routes that old black men could not get help from the government and I always wondered if it was because of their inability to stoke the liberal machine with fresh new students and soldiers with which to staff their egalitarian programs .</p>

			<p>I personally have no problem with Blacks having a home. But as a taxpayer, I do not see any reason to have to support these pathological failures in the lap of luxury. Section 8 housing should ONLY be built in predominantly Black neighborhoods. Building government-assisted housing in White neighborhoods is neither fair nor reasonable, given the crime and social problems Section 8 housing inevitably creates.</p>
<p>I also firmly believe ANYONE wanting public assistance should either have to work for the community, cleaning streets, if necessary, or providing other social service work, as a requisite for obtaining aid. Those claiming to be physically or mentally incapable of performing useful work   &mdash;   let a government designated doctoral exam certify that person to be unable to work.</p>
<p>If anyone can point out a flaw in my thinking, well, I am willing to listen. </p>
