						<p>Certain areas in Britain will still have to remain off-limits for servicemen and women in military gear, despite the Government&rsquo;s desire for a nationwide uniform free-for-all, senior RAF sources acknowledged yesterday.</p>
<p>After the ban on uniforms in Peterborough, ordered by the station commander at nearby RAF Wittering, one senior air force source said that military commanders had to be aware of potential problems of personnel wearing combat and other military clothes in the street.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re aware of the sensitivities, for example, in some ethnic minority communities which is why we need to have a dialogue with local authorities and police if we don&rsquo;t want to cause a problem,&#8221; the source said.</p>
<p>Group Captain Ro Atherton, station commander at RAF Wittering, was praised by her superiors for taking the &#8220;sensible precaution&#8221; of advising personnel under her command to wear civilian clothes in parts of Peterborough after a number of incidents of abuse by members of the public.</p>
<p>The RAF said the ban would be reviewed but there was no question of overruling Group Captain Atherton who was in the best position to make a judgment, after taking advice from the military police and the local police force.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was not a blanket ban for the whole of Peterborough but service personnel were advised to watch out for certain areas,&#8221; the senior RAF source said.</p>
<p>Yesterday it emerged that students at University College London voted to ban the military from setting up recruitment stalls there. They also backed a ban on the Officer Training Corps at the college campus.</p>
<p>A meeting of the students&rsquo; union supported a motion condemning British Forces for waging &#8220;an agressive war overseas&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Defence said that it was disappointed by the students&rsquo; decision. On the Peterborough incidents, a spokesman said there was no evidence that this type of abuse was widespread in other towns and cities in Britain.</p>
<p>Gordon Brown condemned the incidents and urged all members of the Armed Forces to wear uniforms in public.</p>
<p>&#8220;All our Armed Forces should be able to, and encouraged to, wear their uniform in public and have the respect and gratitude of the British people for the huge commitment to public service they show,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister urged local police forces to back the Armed Forces.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe the great majority of the British public would condemn any form of abuse. I condemn absolutely any members of the public who show abuse or discrimination to our Armed Forces,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>David Cameron, the Leader of the Opposition, said that police should come down &#8220;extremely hard&#8221; on people targeting members of the Armed Forces in the streets.</p>
<p>Stewart Jackson, the Conservative MP for Peterborough, said he felt that the ban on uniforms in the city was a &#8220;sledgehammer to crack a nut&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suspect it&rsquo;s probably a very tiny minority of people, and they don&rsquo;t represent the views of the community in Peterborough,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Quentin Davies, Labour MP for the nearby Grantham &amp; Stamford constituency, who is carrying out an official review of the public&rsquo;s attitude towards the Armed Forces, said: &#8220;There must never be no-go areas in any part of our country for any citizen. Least of all should there be no-go areas for those who are wearing the Queen&rsquo;s uniform.&#8221;<br>

			<p>What would the men and women who served proudly in WWll think of this travesty? This is utterly ridiculous. If the minorities are offended, please let them know they are welcome to go back to their own countries where I&rsquo;m sure the treatment they received  there was what drove them to the UK. Just revel in your good fortune and keep your mouths shut! Do you realize how you offend US just by bringing your whining and demanding to our country. </p>

			<p>Parades in Northern Ireland are a sensitive issue, as they usually involve Protestant organizations triumphantly marching through Catholic neighborhoods to celebrate Protestant victories over Catholics, such as that Battle of the Boyne.</p>
<p>(I use the religious terms here in a tribal, rather than religious sense; the Protestants are descendants of Scottish settlers; the Catholics are native Irish; ultimately both are related Celtic groups).</p>
<p>Seems to me that ethnic natives of the British Isles of all ethnicities and religions should agree that a little triumphalist marching through non-white neighborhoods would be a welcome show of force.  Perhaps on the anniversary of a major white (and especially British/Irish) victory over the non-white group in question.</p>

<p>The poor darlings are obviously far too sensitive for the harsh life in the west. Best for everyone if they went back to the muslim paradise from whence they came.  There, they wouldn&rsquo;t run the daily risk of being offended.  Win-Win.  </p>

			<p>My father served in the RAF during WWII, he would be mortified to see the craven state of the country he fought and suffered for; he spent months being bombarded and starved during the siege of Malta, and what for? for this traitorous government and preceding ones to give in to an unarmed invader. <br>
and<br>
Flying tiger said:<br>
&#8220;If Doug Bader was alive, he would walk on his two tin legs through the &ldquo;minority&rdquo; neighborhood beating the stuffing out of anyone who would have objected!&#8221; Exactly so. He wouldn&rsquo;t have stood for any of this current nonsense. Also, Bader was an unflinching supporter of Prime Minister Ian Smith of Rhodesia, another person we admire here at AmRen. <br>
 My family lived in Kenley where Bader was stationed prior to the war and when he still had his legs.  As children we spent many a summer climbing in and around the bunkers and cycling on the airfield up there; in those days, before the rot set in, children could still play away from their homes without fear of molestation or being murdered.  Kenley Aerodrome is still there, I visited it 4 years ago, its now a flying club. I saw Bader fly in Australia a few years before he died; he was there for a demonstration during a Sydney airshow. This would have been around the late 70&rsquo;s. Thanks for your post, it brought back pleasant memories.<br>

			<p>These sorts of assaults on US sailors in southern California were common during World War Two.  The attackers were always Mexicans wearing &#8220;Zoot suits&#8221;.</p>
<p>When base commanders complained to the San Diego city government, they were told that they couldn&rsquo;t do anything about it, because they couldn&rsquo;t identify any individual culprits.  After all, they were all wearing Zoot suits.</p>
<p>The eventual result was large mobs of uniformed US enlisted sailors marching down city streets, beating the daylights out of anyone wearing a Zoot suit.</p>
<p>When the city complained to the base commanders, they were told that nothing could be done, as since everyone was wearing navy uniforms, it would be impossible to identify any individuals.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.<br>
So now in Britain, just as in France, there are certain unofficial but recognized &#8220;no go areas&#8221; that are being carved out as extraterritorial possessions of an alien, colonizing populace.  If left unchallenged, they will grow in time to be de facto colonies with their own laws, administration, etc. This is the first step in conquest. History has seen it many times over.</p>
<p>This is utter madness, and the spineless politicians who allow it are nothing less than traitors.</p>

With all respect to Mr. Miller, parades, stickers and T shirts are nothing more than a mere annoyance to the invaders. They&rsquo;re not going to accomplish anything.  If you&rsquo;re suffering a problem with wolves, you don&rsquo;t tease the wolves, you get rid of them.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Another Yellow Man&#8221; has the right idea.</p>
<p>I would like the march to be conducted on either the anniversary of Omdurman or Rourke&rsquo;s Drift.  Since Winston Churchill actually fought at Omdurman, in a cavalry charge of all things, I would prefer a celebration of Omdurman.  Rourke&rsquo;s Drift was also a Welsh affair, and while my mother&rsquo;s maiden name is Welsh to the point of having no vowels, the march should be pan-British.</p>
<p>I started school in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1971.  The milk and coal came on horse-drawn carts, and we didn&rsquo;t have a refrigerator.  My mother merely put our perishables in a shady spot in the back yard.  We didn&rsquo;t get paper at school.  We had chalk and slates.</p>
<p>The butcher worked next to my school.  Mr. Brown once gave me a pheasant feather, which I stuck in my cap.</p>
<p>To me, Britain seems much like an oft-beaten wife who doesn&rsquo;t know how to escape her abuser.</p>

			<p><b><i>Anyone still believe that England &ldquo;won&rdquo; WW2?</i></b></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very valid question! It deserves some serious thought.<br>
 <br>
Frankly, it&rsquo;s my impression, in reading the comments of some of our British friends who post here, that quite a few of them (not all) - despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary - are STILL laboring under the delusion that it was some kind of a victory. And that Churchill was some kind of a hero! They can&rsquo;t quite explain why, of course. </p>
<p>That alone would seem to be evidence enough of the tremendous barrage of brainwashing they have been subjected to in that country, from cradle to grave   &mdash;   even worse than in the USA. The present plight of Britain is proof of it. But some people will never open their eyes and see the reality all around them  &hellip; or at least put two and two together.</p>

Britain and the United States were on the victor&rsquo;s side, but the real winner was the Soviet Union and International Socialism/ Communism. Hitler was a National Socialist who after a temporary pact with Stalin turned on him with Operation Barbarossa. A fatal mistake. He lost, Communism won, we helped.<br>
 Having assisted Communism to emerge victorious from years of aggressive warfare, the Left in the US and UK in all its myriad forms could claim the moral high ground on just about any issue. The most important issues they promoted were,Pacifism, anti-racism and Internationalism. The Nazis had already been labeled &#8216;rightwing&rsquo; by Stalin so Conservative ideology immediately became suspect when in fact it was Nazi and Communist ideology that bore many similarities.<br>
 Pacifism is seen as the only good, and war is always wrong. Anti-Racism has destroyed Western society, and Internationalism is destroying cultures and economies. Additionally,other Nazi approved practices are emerging as respectable and vitally important issues &#8216;for our survival!&rsquo;, but they are promoted from the Left and with no mention of their Nazi heritage: New Age Religions, the war on smoking, animal rights, homeopathy, organic foods, natural healing, the moral bullying of environmentalism, vegetarianism, nutrition, the assault on free speech were all implemented and practiced by the Nazis. Not that any one practicing any of the above is necessarily a Nazi or Communist, but I just wonder how many people are aware of the heritage of these ideas. It&rsquo;s a useful exercise to question the purpose and political origin of these practices. </p>
<p>So to answer the question I would say that the Allies won a military victory, but it cost them their fundamental nature.  No longer could a White Christian proclaim his Nationalism, patriotism or consider himself as pre-eminent amongst nations. Something has eaten away at their hearts.</p>

			<p>Something to think about on this St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day in Ireland&hellip;</p>
<p>St. Patrick was creditted for chasing the sdnakes out of Ireland. Regrttably those snakes have been replaced with something far worse these last three decades   &mdash;   Black Africans! Don&rsquo;t know about you good folks   &mdash;   me, I would prefer the snakes. Snakes, at least don&rsquo;t commit crimes, nor are they a perpetual social and welfare problem.</p>

			<p>What is particularly disgraceful about this story is the way in which much of the media, especially the BBC, have gone out of their way to conceal the identity of the people responsible. </p>
<p>One would imagine reading the BBC reports that this was a case of badly-behaved white teenagers causing trouble when in fact the guilty are Muslims, in particular Pakistanis. In addition, this is not a case of petty verbal abuse: in nearby Birmingham a gang of Muslim terrorists were recently found guilty of plotting to kidnap a soldier and film themselves beheading him.</p>
