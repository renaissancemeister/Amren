						<p>The white working class are far more pessimistic about Britain&rsquo;s future than their middle-class counterparts, a survey reveals today.</p>
<p>More than half said no one represented their views and that their quality of life had got worse over the past decade.</p>
<p>Some 71 per cent of those polled also said they thought crime rates had gone up in the past ten years, compared with 66 per cent of the middle class.</p>
<p>The survey was carried out by Newsnight as part of the BBC Two&rsquo;s White season, which examines what it means to be white and working class today.</p>
<p>Special programmes include Rivers Of Blood, which looks at the legacy of Enoch Powell&rsquo;s controversial speech, and The Poles Are Coming, which is billed as an &ldquo;entertaining&rdquo; look at the impact of Eastern European immigration.</p>
<p>Roly Keating, BBC Two&rsquo;s controller, said: &ldquo;This is a timely look at how life has changed for the white working class in Britain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will enable the audience to consider the views and circumstances of people who have a strong point of view.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Newsnight survey was commissioned to discover how the white working class &mdash; once viewed as the backbone of the country &mdash; feel about life in modern Britain.</p>
<p>In most areas, they were more pessimistic about the future and more negative about the last ten years than the white middle class, the BBC said.</p>
<p>Some 68 per cent of the middle class said they could no longer afford to buy homes in the area they lived, but 80 per cent of the white working classes said the same.</p>
<p>And 62 per cent of the white working class believe life in Britain has generally deteriorated over the last decade, compared with 51 per cent of the middle class.</p>
<p>The poll also suggested that opinion is divided about immigration, with 52 per cent of the white working class believing it is &ldquo;a bad thing for the country&rdquo;, compared with just 33 per cent of the white middle class.</p>
<p>Asked whether they thought new immigrants had put British jobs at risk, more than twice as many of the working class thought it had.</p>
<p>The BBC has launched the White season on the back of concern about the role of the white working class in modern society.</p>
<p>In the documentary Last Orders, members of Wibsey Working Men&rsquo;s Club, just outside Bradford, even refer to themselves as &ldquo;the forgotten people&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Commissioning editor Richard Klein told the Mail: &ldquo;The voice of the white working-class is barely allowed to intrude into British politics or culture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In metropolitan circles, where sneering at any minority ethnic group would be regarded as an outrage, this white working-class opinion is all too often treated with suspicion or contempt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He also attacked the pejorative use of the word chav.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any similarly abusive description of ethnic minorities would lead to police inquiries,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The Newsnight survey was carried out on a random sample of 1,012 white British adults aged over 18. It will form part of a special edition of the programme at 10.30pm tomorrow.</p>

															<h2><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/newsnight/7279997.stm">White Working Class &lsquo;Voiceless&rsquo;</a></h2>
											<p>
							<i>BBC News, March 5</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>A majority of white working class Britons feel nobody speaks for people like them, a BBC survey has suggested.</p>
<p>Some 58% said they felt unrepresented compared with 46% of white middle class respondents to a Newsnight poll.</p>
<p>White working classes were also negative about the past decade with 62% saying life had generally become worse in the UK.</p>
<p>In response to BBC Two&rsquo;s White Season, a special Newsnight on 6 March will feature full poll results and debate.</p>
<p><b>Pessimism</b></p>
<p>The researchers defined the middle classes as the ABC1 category of occupations &mdash; senior professionals, office workers and junior managers &mdash; while the working class was defined as the C2DE grades &mdash; skilled manual workers, semi and unskilled workers, and people on benefits.</p>
<p>In most areas covered by the survey the white working classes are more pessimistic about the future and more negative about the last decade in Britain than white middle class people.</p>
<p>Of the working class people questioned 71% believe crime has got worse over the last decade, compared with 66% of middle class people.</p>
<p>On housing, 80% of the working class say that people like them can no longer afford to buy homes in the area they live. A smaller majority &mdash; 68% &mdash; of middle class people believed they had been priced out of the local housing market.</p>
<p>Overall 62% of the white working classes believe that life in Britain has generally got worse over the last decade compared with 51% of middle class white people.</p>
<p><b>Jobs risk</b></p>
<p>When asked whether they thought immigration into Britain, on the whole, was a good or bad thing for the country the survey suggests that opinion was divided between people from different social groups.</p>
<p>Some 52% of the white working class people questioned thought immigration was a bad thing (42% thought it was a good thing), while just 33% of white middle class people thought it bad (62% thought it a good thing).</p>
<p>When asked whether they thought new immigrants had put their jobs at risk the survey suggests that more than twice as many white working class people (27%) compared with middle class (13%) people thought it had.</p>
<p><i>Populus interviewed a random sample of 1,012 white British adults aged 18+ by telephone between 29th February and 2nd March 2008.</i></p>

	<h2>Comments</h2> 
			<a id="c432783"></a> 
			<p>Four points:</p>
<p>(1)  If the BBC thinks that the white working class is &#8220;voiceless,&#8221; they&rsquo;re in an ideal position to solve that problem.</p>
<p>(2)  The Daily Mail is biased toward the Tories, and thus have nothing but scorn for the only party that seems to want to do something about what this paper now admits is the problem, that being the British National Party (BNP).  The reason is that the DM/Tories think that a vote for BNP means one fewer Tory vote.  Actually, I think BNP growth would come rather evenly at the expense of both Labour and Tories.</p>
<p>(3)  Why the picture of a white man holding a knife in the Daily Mail story?<br/>
 <br/>
(4)  &#8220;Impact of Eastern European immigration?&#8221;  I bet the last thing a &#8220;chav&#8221; fears is being mugged by a Pole.  England&rsquo;s PC establishment does allow consternation over immigration, as long as it&rsquo;s about white immigrants from Eastern Europe.  Nary a peep is allowed about non-white immigration.</p>
<p>As an aside, and bringing the matter closer to home, East St. Louis, in its heyday, was heavily Polish and Eastern European.  Somehow, they didn&rsquo;t make East St. Louis a less desirable place, nor cause white working class anxiety.  They were the prosperous white working class in East St. Louis.</p>

			<p>&#8220;*The BBC has launched the White season on the back of concern about the role of the white working class in modern society.&#8221;*</p>
<p>Look, the whole &#8220;seasons&#8221; is just another pathetic insult towards the white working class.</p>
<p>(*1.*)&#8221;*Rivers of Blood*&#8221; - let&rsquo;s have a gander at the commentator&rsquo;s, shall we?:<br/>
Frank Field MP, <br/>
Professor Stuart Hall, <br/>
Lord Hattersley, <br/>
Simon Heffer, <br/>
Lord Heseltine, <br/>
Lord Hurd, <br/>
Lord Lester QC, <br/>
Kenan Malik, <br/>
Lord Parekh, <br/>
Professor Roger Scruton, <br/>
Ambalavaner Sivanandan <br/>
Baroness Lola Young.</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m sure &#8220;Ambalavaner Sivanandan&#8221; and &#8220;Kenan Malik&#8221; will glady concur with me that non-whites have been a negative influence on Britain.</p>
<p>(*2.*)&#8221;*White Girl*&#8221; - About a white family that relocates to a &#8220;majority non-white&#8221; city.</p>
<p>Maxwell Martin plays &#8220;Debbie&#8221;, an *illiterate, borderline alcoholic mother of three*, who moves her family to a new city to escape her *lazy, pot-smoking and abusive husband*, Stevie (Daniel Mays). (Yes, they are white - but wait, there&rsquo;s more!)</p>
<p>&#8220;Debbie&rsquo;s 11-year-old daughter Leah though, is struggling to cope, firstly with her alien surroundings (she and her younger siblings are the only white children at the local school) and then with Debbie&rsquo;s repeated relapses. *Inspired by the example of her classmates* and a *family of good-natured neighbours*, Leah takes refuge in an unlikely place: *Islam*.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t hold much hope for the &#8220;*Poles are coming*&#8221; being an &#8220;unbiased look at the effect of Poles on Britain&#8221; either&hellip;</p>

			<p>You asked for it, White working class Britain.  If you think you&rsquo;re being ignored, read above what one person said about speaking out against minorities.  You could end up in jail. You&rsquo;ve been betrayed in so many ways.  Some muslim burns your flag and you could go to jail if you say something about it, let alone express outrage.  </p>
<p>You voted for these &#8220;leaders&#8221; time and again, and they&rsquo;re merely doing what you voted them to do.  Now shut up, work, pay your taxes and obey. </p>

			<p>The BNP is a joke and has no chance of ever transforming itself into a serious political party. The conservative party is actually alot more open than the Republican party is to white nationalists.<br/>
Influencing and infiltrating the conservative party or forming a new political party are the two choices. That said I will be voting BNP in the forthcoming London Mayoral elections.</p>

			<p>Klein is right. </p>
<p>The class prejudice I&rsquo;ve noticed on these issues (especially immigration) has been atrocious. Words like &#8220;nativist,&#8221; &#8220;xenophobe,&#8221; and &#8220;racist&#8221; have all pretty much become synonymous with low-class white people. </p>
<p>Personally, if I was black I think I&rsquo;d rather be called the n-word than any the three names above. At least people would feel sorry for me and defend me. NO ONE in his &#8220;right mind&#8221; would ever defend anyone accused of being a nativist, a xenophobe, or a racist. </p>
<p>P.S. I never thought I&rsquo;d say this, but I think we should seriously consider reading Karl Marx. He could come in handy.  </p>

<p>Amazing, even though it&rsquo;s OBVIOUS that there&rsquo;s a direct link between the massive third world invasion of Britain and the pessimistic attitudes of White Britons, it is not really reflected in here&hellip;only 52% and 33%? It should be equivalent with the 70+% that are pessimistic. It shows how &#8220;White guilt&#8221; and PC&rsquo;ism is affecting the minds of White Britons.</p>

<p>In the yester-years of America what you say would be true. But, in today&rsquo;s world these immigrants,whether they are White or not, do not assimilate or love America. They come to this country to exploit the economy(welfare). Say no to immigration, even White ones.</p>

<p>I agree with you in most of what you say.  The exception I note is the Russian/Ukrainians I have known.  Most are very relgious - converts to American Baptist or Pentecostal missionaries and then brought over as religious refugees.  Then, they are told how to vote and make up a part of the Christian Conservative Movement.  While I don&rsquo;t approve of that sort of tactic anymore than the Left and Catholic tendancy to advocate open borders because it creates more Democratic voters, I have to note that overall these Eastern Europeans are often straight A students, hard working, etc.  Talking to two sisters that I taked into going into the nursing program at the local community college about nationalism they once said, &#8220;We are Ukrainian, not American.&#8221;  I told them that while they might be, their children would be Americans, just as my mother was.&#8221;  I know I am right.  While today&rsquo;s immigrants come over more for the opportunities and somehow feel less grateful than my grandparents did, they don&rsquo;t compare with the non-white immigrants negative impact we discuss constantly here.</p>

<p>Substitute the name of any major American city for the name of &#8220;Britain&#8221; above and it would fit right into that city&rsquo;s newspaper. The reason is the same as well - immigrants, in the US case, illegal immigrants, taking jobs, bankrupting social services, flooding emergency rooms, multiplying inner city gangs, and overcrowding prisons nationawide - all at our expense.  <br/>

(4) &ldquo;Impact of Eastern European immigration?&rdquo; I bet the last thing a &ldquo;chav&rdquo; fears is being mugged by a Pole. England&rsquo;s PC establishment does allow consternation over immigration, as long as it&rsquo;s about white immigrants from Eastern Europe. Nary a peep is allowed about non-white immigration.</p>
<p><br/>
Excellent post, as usual, Mr. Blogmeister. </p>
<p>Not long ago, the long-running British TV drama &#8220;Coronation Street&#8221; featured a plotline about the seamstresses in the local clothing factory reacting badly to some of their sewing machines being operated by new workers from Poland. Some of the indigenous British seamstresses resented the Poles&rsquo; &#8220;taking our jobs away from our people,&#8221; etc. </p>
<p>So far, so standard. But here&rsquo;s where it gets weird: in the multiculti UK of today, the &#8220;Brits&#8221; complaining loudest about the Eastern European immigrants included blacks from the Caribbean! The black &#8220;Brits&#8221; were hand-in-hand with the white natives   &mdash;   who were portrayed as their allies and close friends   &mdash;   fighting against the &#8220;foreigners&#8221; who &#8220;don&rsquo;t belong here.&#8221;  </p>
<p>The idea that the working-class whites would be against the importation of well-behaved white colleagues from Poland, yet would regard Jamaicans   &mdash;   with their stratospheric rates of crime, violence and dysfunction   &mdash;   as their comrades-in-arms strikes me as pure fiction. </p>
<p>The whole presposterous narrative demonstrates only that Hollywood&rsquo;s diversitoid propaganda machine is no longer confined to Hollywood, but has gone global. <br/>

			<p>Whites invented communism and communism requires a vast peasant-class to replace the middle-class in order to successfully conquer a country.  Since the white nations have no vast peasant-class their communist traitors in government are importing them by the millions from the third-world.  The ruling elites don&rsquo;t care what race or religion these imported bottom-feeders are so long as they are uneducated, malleable and corrupt.  </p>

			<p>It is interesting to see the class divide on the issue of immigration. Middle class Britons have yet to feel the effect of non-white crime in the way that working class people have as the non-white immigrants have not colonised the wealthier areas to the same extent. In fact the wealthier are benefiting in the short term as immigrant slave labour is fueling their lifestyle. Non-whites working for very low wages are of course providing the labour in the restaurants, shops etc that the wealthier classes disproportionately use.</p>
<p>However as the non-white population grows and the economy suffers more and more of the middle classes will be confronted with the ugly side of non-white immigration.</p>
<p>The BNP have just published a British version of &#8216;The Color of Crime&rsquo;, and unsurprisingly the picture is very similar to that of the USA despite the huge differences between the histories of the non-white populations in Britain and the USA: http://www.bnp.org.uk/2008/03/06/racism-cuts-both-ways/</p>

			<p>Interestingly enough. it is the white working class that has supported the Labor party for decades while that same party has done nothing but betray the interests of it&rsquo;s electorate and the nation at large. You get the type of government you vote in. If you keep voting Labor, you will continue to get the same type of treatment from the party because they basically despise it&rsquo;s electorate. Why should they change or care at all about what people think if they keep getting put back into office no matter what they choose to do. People always cry and say they want change but the truth is they do not. A nationalist party exists, dedicated to the interest of the true Britons, white people, and people will not put them into power because it seems too &#8216;racist&rsquo;, or too &#8216;rightest&rsquo;, or too this, or too that, while the whole time they become disenfranchised in their own country, decrying the rising crime rates, the dark skinned invasion, the lack of responsiveness from their own government, and the truly desperate situation that the U.K. has allowed herself to be put into. The truth is, the white man is extinguishing himself, at a rapid rate. It is the white man who will not take the necessary steps to insure his own survival. Do what must be done!!! Put parties into office who will listen to our legitimate claims. It is our country!!!! It belongs to us!!!. It does not belong to self serving, traitorous individuals who are transitory on the world stage, whether they be white, black, yellow, or purple. It does not belong to the invading non-white hordes. Britain belongs to Britains and if we wish to keep it that way we had better act quickly, else we will become nothing more than a pathetic, crying, little minority in our own once great nation. Our fathers, who gave their lives to insure our freedoms, lie weeping, lamenting, and moaning in their graves, because we, their children, seem not to have the courage to defend that which has been handed down to us through the centuries. Britain is in our care now. What will be the fate of our children and our childrens children if we do not act now?</p>

What&rsquo;s happening in Britain is the result of 50+ years of indoctrination by government education, the BBC and the print media. All of these institutions have a markedly extreme Leftwing bias and they have done an excellent job in creating a docile and craven people.  If anyone dare to voice opposition to government&rsquo;s dictate it is evidence of White racism (and ungrateful working class racism to boot).  The miserable wreckage that was once my once harmonious and beautiful country is the proof of the Left&rsquo;s success.   Let&rsquo;s face it, how many poorly educated working class people would have the expertise to present an argument against helping the poor, the oppressed, the colored immigrant or refugee.  It takes time, effort and research skills to demonstrate that simply giving handouts eventually backfires on the provider and the recipient. Socialist slogans are a shortcut to feeling good and demonstrating ones munificence, and are judged as evidence that your intentions are above reproach. Not to do so immediately casts one in the light of being uncaring, selfish and of course racist, and who wants to be cast amongst those Rightwing haters who only want to make money and steal oil etc from oppressed peoples? <br/>
 It&rsquo;s all about control, the Far Left never gave a hill of beans about the poor/working classes, they are now discarded in favour of the immigrant.  They had their plan to use the masses as voting fodder, but when the workers rejected the Left&rsquo;s controlling reins they imported more from overseas.  Leftists relentlessly seek to be in total control of others, it&rsquo;s the way weak and needy people achieve fulfillment. There are millions of them out there seeking to manipulate others and give their lives purpose. Unfortunately for all of us, their latest imported voting block may turn out to be just a tad more controlling than they could ever imagine.<br/>
I&rsquo;m really feeling pleased that the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph are starting to print articles that reflect the true situation on a regular basis. These two papers are the most Conservative papers in UK.<br/>

			<p>Unfortunately, I am afraid the only Britons who are serious about the problem are the ones who are emigrating.</p>
