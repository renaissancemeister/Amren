						<p>Future historians of the phenomenon known as &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; that the West bone-headedly adopted towards the end of the second millennium will note the precise time when it was dealt a mortal wound.</p>
<p>It was at 8:46 on Tuesday morning of Sept. 11, 2001, when the first of the four commercial airliners hijacked by Islamist terrorists &mdash; all of Arab origin &mdash; struck the north tower of the World Trade Center in New York City.</p>
<p>Since that time other western cities &mdash; Madrid, London, Amsterdam, Los Angeles, Toronto, Paris, Washington &mdash; have been targets of successful or failed attempts by Islamist terrorists determined to spread random death and destruction.</p>
<p>Those involved in the planning and execution of such terror are immigrants or born of immigrant parents belonging to the rapidly growing Muslim population in the West over the past 40 years. I happen to be a part of this wave of immigration to the West.</p>
<p>This western Muslim population, with its ethnic diversity reflecting the vastness of the Arab-Muslim world &mdash; stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific and from central Asia to sub-Saharan Africa &mdash; could have given some timely ballast to multiculturalism by unambiguously and unapologetically defending the West against barbarity.</p>
<p>This was the minimum Muslims in the West owed to the civilization where they sought refuge, and where they found security, prosperity, freedom and self-fulfillment of the like denied them in their native lands.</p>
<p>Instead Muslim-based organizations, at first having offered denial, followed with an unending volume of polemics condemning the West for past sins. By exploiting the West&rsquo;s post-colonial guilt they held it responsible for the conditions in the Arab-Muslim world that breeds the politics of terrorism.</p>
<p>These bald-faced polemics are sheer nonsense, and yet they resonated in much of the West that went limp with the anodyne of wishful multicultural thinking.</p>
<p>The idea that all cultures are equal in merit and deserving respect, an idea devoid of any historical perspective, could be seriously proposed and adopted only in western liberal democracies. And logically such an idea meant only one thing, the diminution of the West and its achievements in comparison to other cultures.</p>
<p>Multiculturalism institutionalized as a policy, run by self-perpetuating bureaucracies and sustained by entrepreneurs of a growing multicultural industry, became an easy ride for its proponents and clients.</p>
<p>Immigrants were not required to embrace the West&rsquo;s culture and complex history; and the West did not have to strain itself in instructing immigrants on the need or importance of embracing it, warts and all.</p>
<p>Multiculturalism worked so long as the illusion of cultural harmony could be maintained.</p>
<p>But once the sham of equality got exposed by the heat of Islamist violence &mdash; once it became undeniable that a culture in which a woman, for instance, can assert her individual freedom without fear is not at par with a culture where a woman&rsquo;s worth is less than that of a man &mdash; multiculturalism as an idea was dead.</p>
<p>Historians will note a period of confusion followed the death of multiculturalism before the West asserted its ideals of freedom and democracy, and moved on.<br>

					<p>I have this to say about multiculturalism:</p>
<p>When I hear proponents of multiculturalism advocate the public acceptance of women wearing chadors and burkas, I respond by asking them if they&rsquo;d hire a man who showed up at a job interview wearing a lace dress, nylons, and high heels.</p>
<p>When they claim that all cultures are equal, I ask them what they think of honor killings, forced marriages, and female genital mutilation.</p>
<p>When they champion multiculturalism as Canada&rsquo;s greatest virtue, I ask them why they don&rsquo;t then insist that third-world countries also practice it.</p>
<p>In other words, I don&rsquo;t believe in multiculturalism because its proponents always turn out to be hypocrites.<br>

					<p>Really?  As it turns out, 9/11 didn&rsquo;t do much to reverse the trend.  The <span class="caps">FBI </span>has all but adopted Islam as its official religion.  More than 100,000 immigrants from countries that the State Department fingers as terrorist sponsors have been accepted into America since 9/11.  And if Multiculturalism is &#8220;dying,&#8221; then that would be news to the diversity/equality/Human Rights commissars in the country in which this article was published, because they&rsquo;re stronger than ever and more strident than ever in punishing right-wing racial dialogue.</p>

					<p>&#8220;Historians will note a period of confusion followed the death of multiculturalism before the West asserted its ideals of freedom and democracy and moved on.&#8221; One can only hope that &#8220;a period of confusion&#8221; will be the only final consequence of the grand experiment.  One can only hope.  I only know that I am tired of political and social experiments being thrust upon my civilization.</p>

					<p>&#8220;Multiculturalism&#8221; is actually a chronological term.  It describes the period between when the first black family moves into a neighborhood and when the last white family moves out.</p>

					<p>Wow, is the Toronto Sun a mainstream newspaper? This sounds like something straight out of AmRen.  Maybe the <span class="caps">MSM </span>is finally waking up and realizing that in order to improve their slumping sales, they need to actually try to correct the disconnect between themselves and the white population who used to read their papers.  Just look at the recent series on <span class="caps">BBC </span>about England&rsquo;s white working class.  On the <span class="caps">BBC&rsquo;</span>s website today they had a message board relating to the new series and the reader&rsquo;s comments made me think I was reading AmRen.  Maybe there is hope yet.  It may take a while but the truth will always come out - let&rsquo;s just hope it happens before it is too late.</p>

					<p>Does anyone here in Amren think for one minute that multiculturism has been a success??? Hell no would be the answer from most of us&hellip;the sane ones among us anyhow.  It <span class="caps">WILL NOT WORK&hellip;</span>you see most of the so called &#8220;immigrants&#8221; of today are not really immigrants&hellip;they are mostly illegals and other garbage that sneak into the country and latch on to the &#8220;tit of the easy life&#8221; provided by our idiots in washington. They are not <span class="caps">OUR </span>elected officials&hellip;they belong to big business once they get into office.  Then they forget about all who fought to make this country great, the hard working men and women in this country.  They only see, black, brown and any other color but <span class="caps">WHITE&hellip;.</span>we do not count&hellip;we are slaves to our jobs in order to feed taxes that will not benefit us but <span class="caps">THEM&hellip;.THE GARBAGE THAT OUR GOVERNMENT ALLOWS</span> TO <span class="caps">COME OVER OUR BORDERS. </span> Now that they are ready to war in south america&hellip; more and more of them will be here&hellip;shooting at <span class="caps">US. </span> The muslim are allowed to do exactly as they please&hellip;God forbid they should somehow insult them&hellip;by telling them they shouldnt lop off heads in our country&hellip;.when will all this insanity end????? I hope I see it in my lifetime&hellip;but I doubt it&hellip;we are in the sewer now&hellip;how much lower can we go???? </p>

					<p>&#8220;Multiculturalism works only as long as the Illusion of Harmony Exists.&#8221;</p>
<p>I would add that,since the &#8220;harmony&#8221; is so often an illusion,  it isn&rsquo;t really working at all,certainly not in some positive way. Witness the tension that exists in a city that can be called the laboratory for the  multicultural experiment, Lost Angeles. Los Angeles has already had two major riots, and they haven&rsquo;t &#8220;solved&#8221; anything.</p>

					<p>What should concern people <span class="caps">GREATLY </span>is what is likely to replace multiculturalism.</p>
<p>The left, in this world, and in the <span class="caps">US, </span>in particular, has been engaged in an internal struggle of marxism vs fascism, for over a century now.  This struggle fueled two world wars (and perhaps our own civil war).  It could very well fuel a third world war.</p>
<p>If you want a fascinating read, on this, pick up a copy of John Goldberg&rsquo;s book, &#8220;Liberal Fascism&#8221;.  The american left wasn&rsquo;t always beholden to secularism, communism, multiculturalism and &#8220;social justice&#8221;.  There was a time when they used the same techniques they do today to grip the western world in an iron fist based on radical patriotism, military adventurism and a real penchant for using violence to force compliance and conformity.  The US came damn close to becoming a fascist dictatorship with none of the freedoms we take for granted today.</p>
<p>The real danger is this was the time in our history when the left was successful as a political movement.  Ever since they flipped over to marxism, it has just been one failed policy after another.  Multiculturalism is just one in a long list of pathetic disasters with regard to foreign and domestic policy.  Eventually, they will realize the source of that failure and may return to fascism.</p>
<p>And is will be seductive&hellip;.damn seductive.  To deal with islamonazism with an iron fist?  To tell the traitors and miscellaneous freaks that infect every level of our society to shut the hell up (or maybe even, get the hell out)?  To force a solution to the problems created by abuse of our immigration system?  To solve the crime being committed by blacks, using the most draconian techniques?</p>
<p>A great many would welcome that, and never bother to count the cost.  It&rsquo;s one of the reasons we need conservatism in this country and the rest of the western world.</p>
<p>If you refuse to give people sane solutions to problems, they will find insane ones.  It&rsquo;s happened before.  It could <span class="caps">EASILY </span>happen again.</p>

					<p>I happened upon this article with mixed feelings, seeing &#8220;Toronto Star&#8221; and then the title. i <span class="caps">KNEW </span>it had to be too good to be true. no way would a liberal rag in an even more liberal country let such truth be posted without obscuring it in some fashion.</p>
<p>To my surprise i was wrong but there still was that catch.</p>
<p>It takes a non-white to say what whites are forbidden to say.</p>
<p>The few good ones that&rsquo;ll look the truth straight in the eye, even if its degrading, and confront it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too bad i feel one or more of the following will happen.</p>
<p>Muslims will condemn him for his honesty.</p>
<p>The article will be taken off the internet.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll never see an article from a &#8220;Salim Mansur&#8221; ever again.</p>
<p>The orthodoxy cannot have truth speakers, no matter their color, shed light on their cult. Though a non-white will be given a slap on the wrist compared to what a white will get. the truth will be silenced all the same.</p>

<p>When Pim Fortuyn exposed this fraud the proponents and clients  demonized and labeled him a danger to society&hellip;.the created the climate of hatred which led to the assassination of a man who put his life on the line to tell the truth.

<p>Personally, I&rsquo;m still waiting and hoping for multiculturalism to die; it can&rsquo;t happen soon enough for me.</p>

					<p>Even in the days before multiculturalism was the unofficial policy in America, blacks and hispanics still practiced their own culture or what they called culture, whether we liked it or not.  Other than making English the official language and ending bilingual classes, there&rsquo;s not much else we can do.  We will still be a multiracial country no matter what happens to multiculturalism.  Europe and the rest of the West have an overwhelming numerical advantage in native populations and can force monoculturalism on their immigrants.  European Americans are 62% of the population in the <span class="caps">US. </span> If we return to an official Western culture there will still be competing cultures.  </p>

					<p>Attributing the abject failrue of Multiculturalism to &#8220;9/11&#8221; and Muslims/Islam is hardly an accurate assessment of the situation - at least not in America. While Muslims are certainly part of the problem(much more so in Europe and Canada evidently), and perhaps more openly and obviously ill-constituted for life in the west, they are surely no greater an problem in America than Blacks and Hispanics! Multiculturalism failed because it is a hopelessly flawed, even ludicrous supposition from the ground up. Muslims in the west are but a piece of the much broader failure of a sick and impossible idea in general.</p>

					<p>Some fan of National Review&rsquo;s Jonah Golberg or more likely Jonah Golberg himself has posted a comment here:</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want a fascinating read, on this, pick up a copy of John Goldberg&rsquo;s book, &ldquo;Liberal Fascism&rdquo;. The american left wasn&rsquo;t always beholden to secularism, communism, multiculturalism and &ldquo;social justice&rdquo;. There was a time when they used the same techniques they do today to grip the western world in an iron fist based on radical patriotism, military adventurism and a real penchant for using violence to force compliance and conformity. The US came damn close to becoming a fascist dictatorship with none of the freedoms we take for granted today.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ok&hellip;.. yeah right&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>I am sure the remaining White citizens in Detroit <span class="caps">MI,</span> East St. Louis Illinois will have a tough time believing Jonah Goldberg&rsquo;s book that American was/is almost a Fascist, <span class="caps">NAZI,</span> White Racist state! I think the few remaining White folks in Detroit or Phily might have a few kind thoughts about El Duce or former tough Phily police cheif/mayor Frank Rizzo - &#8220;Fascists&#8221; if you want to call them that, but certainly not pathetic cowards who led Black/Muslim criminals rape and murder our women.</p>
<p>Jonah - it is you Jonah isn&rsquo;t it? Nobody much cares what you and National Review publish these days, American Renaissance is certainly not the place for this stuff.</p>
<p>American Renaissance is an intelligent, principled, American White Nationalist magazine/web site. Our writers and our readers, commentors are intelligent, reasonable, well educated White folks who take our own side -the White, Western side. We are kind to our own kind - it&rsquo;s called &#8220;kindness&#8221;. We are not idiots, nut cases, wackos and we don&rsquo;t fall in to the tired routine of screaming that everyone is a &#8220;Fascist&#8221;. And America then and now is almost a Fascist dictatorship. </p>
<p>This is our forum, we shouldn&rsquo;t let the Neo Cons at National Review or Jonah Goldberg himself come over to spread their nonsense. National Review hasn&rsquo;t published any sane, White patriots since about 1990, we should return the favor and show them the door in a nice, polite, &#8220;Uptown&#8221; way.</p>

					<p>Multiculturalism has many meanings, but the white European American peoples need to take a closer look at it to see how the meme can be utilized to give new life and meaning to the Right of Free Association.</p>
<p>A knee-jerk rejection of mlticulturalism is harmful to our long term interests. </p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve long been familiar with the concept of multiculturalism in the world, why can&rsquo;t we move to adapt its energies to our purposes?</p>
<p>I suspect the problem is that multiculturalism radically changes the meaning of America to an unrecognizable hodge-podge in which groups based on ethnic interests battle it out. It is such an obviously available meme for us that if we were to embrace it, the powers-that-be would undoubtedly move quickly into some new kind of universalism model.</p>

Most everybody says, &#8216;Yes, I&rsquo;m in favor of diversity and I really like multiculturalism,&rsquo; but if there&rsquo;s nothing to pull people together they get kind of nervous.</p>
<p>Multicultural Canada is becoming a collection of monocultural neighbourhoods. </p>
<p>In Canada, you may live in a multicultural society, but the evidence suggests that fewer and fewer people are living in multicultural neighborhoods. So much time is spent on congratulating ourselves on our tolerance and diversity that we have allowed it to slide into self-segregated communities, isolated along ethnic lines.   <br>
Both communism and the New Left are alive and thriving in today&rsquo;s Canada.  People favor code words: tolerance, social justice, economic justice, peace, reproductive rights, sex education and safe sex, safe schools, inclusion, diversity, and sensitivity.  All together, this is Cultural Marxism disguised as multiculturalism.</p>
<p>The main issue now is whether Canada and the West are committing suicide?   </p>
<p>A compelling argument of the state of affairs can be made that &#8220;it&rsquo;s the demography, stupid.&#8221;  The challenge is no longer to save Canada and the West, but to see if anything can still be saved. For the West, make no mistake, is dying.<br>

					<p>This article was published in the Toronto <span class="caps">SUN </span><a href="https://torontosun.com/News/home.html" rel="nofollow">https://torontosun.com/News/home.html</a> - a newspaper that willingly describes the race of wanted criminals and could be described as our only conservative newspaper   &mdash;   unlike the <i>Toronto <span class="caps">STAR</span></i> that has a policy of <span class="caps">NOT </span>revealing the race of perps because they already <b>know</b> what race of people are responsible for most violent crime in Toronto.</p>
<p>But, during the past 2-3 weeks, I&rsquo;ve caught the <i>Toronto <span class="caps">STAR</span></i> breaking their own rules on two separate occasions when the perpetrators&rsquo; race was described in print. Guess what! The two wanted men were described as being White.  </p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s unfortunate that a <b>visible-minority immigrant</b> has to write an article in a Canadian newspaper telling us what we already know. Let&rsquo;s hope a few white Canadian columnists learn something from <i>Salim Mansur&rsquo;s</i> candid views, and also denounce these fables we call multiculturalism and the &#8220;joys of diversity&#8221;.  It&rsquo;s time we pointed out to the emperor that he&rsquo;s actually wearing no clothes.</p>

					<p>      It seems to work because it works at first when the<br>
number of minorities is small. And of those small groups, Whites<br><br>
are only exposed to the most adaptable and seemingly compliant.<br><br>
Things begin to change but too slowly for the average person to<br><br>
notice. And when Whites begin to feel uneasy, they compare the<br><br>
present to a past that was already altered by the minorities-<br><br>
fatal mistake. Whites should compare the unliveable present <br><br>
with a past that was really good not just a bit better. But<br><br>
most people are too young or if old eneough, too old to rememb-<br><br>
er correctly, or if cogent, too socially conditioned to reason<br><br>
correctly from the data available. All of this is incremental-<br><br>
ism-one of the great weapons used against our People. <br><br>
      Too abstract? Ever ask yourself how you got into <br><br>
a terrible relationship? It&rsquo;s because the person wasn&rsquo;t like<br><br>
that when you first me them. They only gradually revealed them-<br><br>
selves. If they did it all at once, you would have just left.<br><br>
This is incrementalism, the great weapon of the Evil. Thus all<br><br>
traditional societies emphasize memory as a divine faculty.<br><br>
Without it, you will have no valid data to reason from, but <br><br>
only files increasingly adulterated by propaganda. Yes, you<br><br>
will do it to yourself. The Maoists called it self-correction.</p>

					<p>I have known and worked with many Iranians; they refer to themselves as Persians. Their families were all alligned with the Shah at some point, so they emigrated to the West. I considered them to be white, found them highly intelligent, ambitious and driving, with a very sharp wit and sense of humor. These people treated women well. They were not Muslims&hellip;</p>

					<p>Multiculturalism in the West is the result of our elites, both neoconservative and neomarxists, promoting globalization, both economic and social, meaning total intergration of the World&rsquo;s finance and goverment. It is a universalist principle of free capital flow and migration of populations, not to mention outsourcing ect. But the most damaging product by far to come out of universalist principles was multiculturalism. The effect, most severly seen in places like Canada and esp. the <span class="caps">U.K, </span>was the total loss of the Whites in these &#8220;universal&#8221; countries of a sense of themselves as a people, the product of 3000 years of history. The Western peoples achieved the greatest civilization the world had known, and yet those who know it (few) can&rsquo;t say it, and the young dont even understand the concept of Western history and culture. Multiculturalism stripped European descended peoples of their identity. It is in question weather our elites are going to change. The choice for ED peoples will then be either revolution or extinction.</p>

					<p>It is refreshing to read an article by a reasonable immigrant with his eyes open  &mdash;  well done.  There are two problems with multiculturalism, firstly it is false and secondly it is always a one way street, it is the West that is supposed to accept other cultures, never the other way around.</p>
<p>What has always bothered me is the following question:  who exactly benefits from multiculturism, aside from those who are its direct beneficiaries?  What exactly do our elites get out of the destruction of their own culture unless they are all misguided fools(i.e. cultural marxists and the like).</p>

 The hallowed ground for the Multi-cultists is &#8220;higher education&#8221; in this country. However, one must avert one&rsquo;s gaze on many campuses today because overt, active and intentional institutional segregation is practiced. From seperate freshmen orientations for select groups to segregated dorms, dances and graduation ceremonies, sacred Diversity exists, literally, within fenced areas.<br><br>
 A Harvard political scientist(contradiction in terms) named Putnam was forced to publish research he had sat on for several years because it demonstrated that &#8220;diversity&#8221; damaged interactions even within seperate groups.<br><br>
 It is a benefit only to those whose goal is to destroy the United States.</p>

Couple of responses to post by Stuck in No Mans Land:</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;It takes a non-white to say what whites are forbidden to say.&#8221; </p>
<p><br>
Yes, that is so   &mdash;   and it is unfortunate, to be sure. And I hope it will not always be this way, and that white people will eventually get their voice back. But my feeling is that, during these censorious times, it&rsquo;s better to have <span class="caps">SOMEBODY </span>saying this stuff than <span class="caps">NOBODY.</span> Same situation when Chris Rock makes observations about his fellow blacks that are 100 <span class="caps">TIMES </span>more insulting and offensive (and accurate) than Don Imus and Michael Richards put together. </p>
<p><br>
&#8220;The article will be taken off the internet. We&rsquo;ll never see an article from a &ldquo;Salim Mansur&rdquo; ever again.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Salim Mansur is a regular columnist for the Toronto Sun. His opinions are generally very conservative   &mdash;   and occasionally even sound like Race Realism. This is not the first time he has criticized multiculturalism   &mdash;   although it may be the first time he has gone so far as to declare that it &#8220;cannot survive.&#8221; I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll catch a lot of flak for this from a rainbow coalition of knee-jerk Marxists   &mdash;   but I would be very surprised if he was fired or &#8220;disappeared&#8221; as a result. </p>
<p>Personally, I would rather have an intelligent, thoughtful non-white who believes that &#8220;The idea that all cultures are equal in merit and deserving respect [is] devoid of any historical perspective&#8221; move next door to me, than yet more white liberal multicultists sipping lattes and quietly plotting my destruction. <br>

					<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;The idea that all cultures are equal in merit and deserving respect, an idea devoid of any historical perspective, could be seriously proposed and adopted only in western liberal democracies.

					<p>&#8220;Multiculturalism&#8221; exists only because the host community allows itself to be displaced by alien newcomers and acquieses in its own displacement. It wasn&rsquo;t a case of 300-400 years ago, Tamils, Chinese, Koreans, blacks, Arabs, Pakistanis and Whites all coming together and building Canada collectively, each group contributing an equal share to the development of the country. The country of Canada was essentially built and created by Whites. Much, much, later these other peoples arrived and were happy to avail themselves of the fruits of White peoples labour.</p>

					<p>You should check out the forum at www.city-data.com.  They have occassional posts such as &#8220;Where&rsquo;s a Diverse Area I can Live in?&#8221;.  But there&rsquo;s also people who are making posts criticizing diversity there too.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be surprised how many white people yabber on about &#8220;they couldn&rsquo;t imagine living in an all white world.&#8221;  They&rsquo;ll also say things to the effect of &#8220;living in an all white area is bland and boring.&#8221;  So I guess a diverse area with its multi-cultralism and its accompanying street gangs, graffitti, car jackings, drug trade, racial demands, etc. is considered a more desirable way of life compared to a clean, safe, white area?</p>
<p>But from what I gather, most well-meaning whites and even the mush head ones operate from assumptions rather than hard facts.  They believe because of the constant use of the word &#8220;minority&#8221;, and barriage of TV pictures of starving people in third world countries and their <span class="caps">AIDS </span>crisis and poverty that those people are stuck in some hell hole and we have to rescue them.  </p>
<p>I also believe that many of these people because of the abovementioned, think that third world people are near extinction and that whites make up 90% of the global population.  I know this is what my I used to believe.  </p>

<p>But they have already written about it, in a way.  Gibbon&rsquo;s &#8220;Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&#8221; has long made this historical scenario plain.  The problem is that so few today respect history as a lesson or guide.<br>

					<p>Integration has failed in France . Multiculturalism is failing worldwide, never mind the <span class="caps">UK, </span>yet the Ruling Class persist in defiance of the empirical data that such societies are either a disaster, totalitarian or both.<br>
The <span class="caps">USSR </span>spent the best part of a century suppressing ethnic divisions but they immediately reappeared when it collapsed. A qualitative description of how Multi-ethnic societies are a failure worldwide is given by Professor Tutu Vanhanen in his book &ldquo;Ethnic Conflicts Explained by Ethnic Nepotism&rdquo;.  <span class="caps">ISBN</span> 0762305835 . An illuminating review by Johan <span class="caps">M.G. </span>van der Dennen, Center for Peace and Conflict Studies, University of Groningen, the Netherlands can be found  at https://rint.rechten.rug.nl/rth/dennen/vanhanen.htm. The review is well worth the time it takes to read it. A synopsis is <i>&hellip; Vanhanen&rsquo;s macroquantitative research on ethnic conflicts, a life-work spanning several decades, is an important contributing factor in this tide-turning process. </i></p>
<p>Conflicts are common in all countries of the world where people are divided into separate groups on the basis of racial, ethnic, national, linguistic, tribal, religious, caste, or other differences. &hellip; explained by our evolved predisposition to ethnic nepotism, which is regarded as an extended form of kin nepotism. Evolutionary theories of inclusive fitness and kin selection &hellip; explain the evolutionary origin and universality of nepotism. &hellip; (1) significant ethnic divisions tend to lead to ethnic interest conflicts in all societies and (2) the more a society is ethnically divided, the more political and other interest conflicts tend to become canalized along ethnic lines. These two hypotheses are tested by empirical evidence covering 148 contemporary states &hellip; the degree of ethnic conflict is indeed strongly related to the degree of ethnic divisions. &hellip; What the cultural theorists have in common &hellip; is a reluctance of acknowledging the existence of ethnic conflicts &hellip; Ethnic groups can thus be perceived as extended kin groups. &hellip; People belonging to the same ethnic group tend to support each other in conflict situations. &hellip; Our tendency to favor kin over nonkin has extended to include large linguistic, national, racial, religious, and other ethnic groups. &hellip; Ethnic divisions seem to have produced ethnic conflicts in practically all countries of the world. Vanhanen notes that cultural theories are hardly able to explain the universality of ethnic conflicts. &hellip; etc.<br>

<p>Yes, a revolution is coming and it will be violent.</p>
<p>Brenda Walker over at VDare.com writes (about Hispanic violence and ethnic cleansing in Los Angeles):</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; No citizen child should have to stay indoors to be safe from rampaging foreigners. Living with a reasonable expectation of protection against crime is part of inhabiting a first-world country. We spend a lot of money on police and prisons. </p>

					<p>Reality Check at 3:01 PM: I too have met liberals who think that living amongst Whites is boring, and claim to find such joy in diversity.  They can tell themselves this because they only mingle with non-Whites on White terms in White territory.  The nice Black or Black male/White female couple at the Unitarian church, the friendly Hindu behind the counter at the little market, all the diverse faces at the local college.  They put their kids in private schools with a few 3rd or 4th generation Hispanics for variety.  They do not move into diverse neighborhoods unless &#8220;diversity&#8221; means lots of White homosexuals, with a sprinkling of well-behaved Blacks.  And they shop where, aside from a few Orientals, all the diversity is among the employees.  They want enough non-Whites for spice, to take as much or as little as they wish, but they don&rsquo;t want to make a meal of it.  </p>

They would  be denounced and ostracized as white racist bigots and xenophobes. It&rsquo;s pretty hard to do that with someone named Salim Mansur. Well, that&rsquo;s at least one advantage that multiculturalism brings us.  Somebody is allowed to stick up for us, even if we can&rsquo;t do it ourselves.</p>

And this foreign musical ethos in Vienna, destroyed Western Art Music, over a hundred years ago. That Schoenberg was not &#8216;German&rsquo; is a clue as well, as to why &#8216;harmony&rsquo; can only occur between consonant intervals&hellip;..or individuals. Like begets like. <span class="caps">IT&rsquo;</span>s a tale &#8216;as old as time.&rsquo;</p>

					<p>&#8220;Multiculturalism worked so long as the illusion of cultural harmony could be maintained.  But once the sham of equality got exposed by the heat of Islamist violence &mdash; once it became undeniable that a culture in which a woman, for instance, can assert her individual freedom without fear is not at par with a culture where a woman&rsquo;s worth is less than that of a man &mdash; multiculturalism as an idea was dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not an accurate analysis nor a logical conclusion.</p>
<p>The West still has not learned anything at all about the truth of the dangers of its multicultural societies, and it will not adequately respond to correct the situation, instead preferring to continue to pretend that all is well and diversity is their strength.</p>
<p>In fact, the West will never admit to it&rsquo;s diversity fiasco and will evolve, day by day, into a more tumultuous, contentious mass of tribal hostilities until critical mass has been reached wherein the elements themselves resort to fighting, thereby causing an implosion that will rip each country into ethnic/racial partitions.</p>
<p>At when that time arrives, as it is certain to do, even then the diversity advocates will refuse to denounce their preposterous utopian dreams even though they may be in the midst of internecine warfare from fractious elements who are fighting for control.</p>
<p>Where this writer makes his mistake is in assuming that white multiculturalists have the ability to reason in logical terms when they do not, which is <span class="caps">EXACTLY </span>why we are on the brink of a large scale catastrophe right now.<br>

					<p>The great example of multiculturalism of a bygone era would be the Austro-Hungarian Dual Monarchy. This political entity of the mid-eighteen hundreds and early nineteen hundreds governed the lives of over one hundred million people of very different cultures. Some great things were accomplished by the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. It sponsored great symphonic orchestras,all kinds of sporting contests, including great chess tournaments(called Chess Congresses),all kinds of scientific enterprises that lead to many noble prizes,and more things,too many to mention. But if you read about the inner workings of this multicultural Super-State, there was always immense friction,much underlying unrest, and even hate between the different cultures. Mixed in with the beautiful Viennese Strauss Waltzes and general facade of culture that characterized the late Victorian Era, was much poverty. In the end, it was the extreme tension between the Dual Monarchy and certain lands in the former Yugoslavia called &#8220;Crown territories&#8221;that led to the Empires demise. In spite of the fact that the Austro-Hungarian Empire did everything it could for most of its culturally different &#8220;Crown territories&#8221;, it wasn&rsquo;t enough to overcome those cultural differences. In the end,the constant pressure for autonomy of certain &#8220;Crownlands&#8221; that comprised the former Yugoslavia, eventually led to World War 1 and the subsequent collapse of the Multicultural Austro-Hungarian Monarchy.</p>
<p>Interestingly,this process is continuing today in nations all over the world. Scotland vs United Kingdom, the break-up of the former Yugoslavia into a half dozen or more, smaller independent nations, the continuing movement for Basque Independence in Spain, the separation of Slovakia from the Czech Republic in the former Czechoslovakia, Quebec vs greater Canada,and on and on. It seems as if multiculturalism just can&rsquo;t work in the long or not so long run.</p>

<p>The tendency of non-White immigrants migrating to a previously White nation, doing their utmost to make their new country resemble the country they just came from! Their <span class="caps">NEW </span>country rapidly takes on the appearance of that older hellhole.</p>

					<p>That was an interesting little essay on the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. Thanks, Bobby. The Hapsburgs (or at least their government) stood for culture and progress and accomplished a lot in difficult circumstances, although some of the monarchs were personally pretty ditzy. They tried to be fair and impartial to all. But it was basically the Germans, their language and culture, that provided the central &#8220;glue&#8221; which held the whole rickety thing together. </p>
<p>Eventually, in the 20th century, under attack from all sides, the center could no longer hold.  They withstood centuries of external attacks from the Ottoman Turks better than they resisted the subversive ideologies of the 20th century which brought them down.</p>

					<p>Thank you,your welcome ghw. It was during my college days some moons ago, that I was required to do a lengthy essay on the Hapsburg Monarchy. The Hapsburgs ruled for such a long time that covering their whole history was too vast a project, so I restricted myself to the period of the Dual Monarchy Austria-Hungary. Take care.</p>

					<p>&#8220;Multiculturalism,&#8221; as the end is so un-natural, so foreign to the existent society for which it is now the, &#8220;Policy,&#8221; that the grief and disharmony it brings in its being imposed, will be like nothing to the end destruction it causes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Multiculturalism,&#8221; is a disguise for multiracialism; The goal of the new world order.</p>
