						<p>An eastern Pennsylvania judge known for creative sentencing has ordered three men to learn English or go to jail.</p>
<p>Luzerne County Judge Peter Paul Olszewski Jr. said the men, who faced prison for criminal conspiracy to commit robbery, can remain on parole if they learn to read and write English, earn their GEDs and get full-time jobs.</p>
<p>Olszewski noted that the three men, Luis Reyes, Ricardo Dominguez and Rafael Guzman-Mateo, plus a fourth defendant, Kelvin Reyes-Rosario, all needed translators in court when they pleaded guilty Tuesday.</p>
<p>The four, ranging in age from 17 to 22, were in a group that police said accosted two men on a Wilkes-Barre street in May. The two said they were asked if they had marijuana, told to empty their pockets, struck on the head, threatened with a gun and told to stay off the block.</p>
<p>The judge sentenced the four men to jail terms of four to 24 months. But he gave Reyes, Dominguez and Guzman-Mateo, who already had served at least four months, immediate parole. Reyes-Rosario remains imprisoned on an unrelated drug charge.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He has ordered young defendants who are school dropouts to finish school. He often orders defendants to get full-time employment. But he also has his staff coordinate with an employment agency to help them find the jobs.</p>
<p>In this case, Olszewski said, &#8220;There&rsquo;s no way young kids can be hurt by knowing how to read and write the English language.&#8221;<br>

					<p>If they don&rsquo;t know any English by that age, the odds are that they are not legal.  So now we get to pay for them to learn English, get a <span class="caps">GED, </span>and help in finding a job!  Who says crime doesn&rsquo;t pay?  Only in America!</p>

					<p>All the money that is put into educating illegals, and the majority drop out of school anyway.  You can&rsquo;t fix innate stupid.</p>

					<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that a judge can force anyone to appreciate learning and education. These &#8220;youths&#8221; wouldn&rsquo;t have dropped out of high school if they had the IQ and the drive to succeed and learn English back in childhood, like the rest of us do.</p>

					<p>You know whats funny is I read this somewhere else and the article reported that the attorneys for these fine upstanding men are researching the legality behind the sentencing&hellip;. meaning they may fight it???? How stupid do you have to be. Lets see here, hmm prison or learn english? <span class="caps">HMMM </span>prison or get a job? <span class="caps">HMMM </span>prison or get an education? Are they serious? The attorneys should be kissing the ground the judge walks on for a deal like that. Its not that difficult of a thing to do to get a job and learn english and stop committing crime. Wish there was a stupidity penalty if they decide to fight it and we can add a few more years to their sentence just for being so ignorant! </p>

					<p>This is a great judge&hellip;.I just wanted to let ya all know that I called that so called Senator Bob Casey&hellip;just saw his speech that he endorsed the other moron Obama&hellip;.I let his secretary know in no uncertain terms, would I ever vote for Casey again. I said it is an obamanation that he would endorse a person like obama who is not only anti white&hellip;but unpatriotic &hellip;and a few other things I won&rsquo;t bore you with.  I was to say the least, angry and not very nice.  I only wish I could speak face to face with our traitorous congressmen and senators&hellip;.but they hide&hellip;.they like the other idiot we have in the whitehouse now, could care less what us little people need or want.  </p>

Absolutely true.  I am confident we&rsquo;re going to experience a revolution, and it will be against us, our system, our institutions, our culture, and our skin color.  </p>
