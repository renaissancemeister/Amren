					<p>A possible explanation for SC Bears &#8220;striking African-American suspects with their patrol cars&#8221; might be because the &#8220;African-American suspects&#8221; were fleeing, and the Bears were chasing said fleeing suspects in their patrol cars.</p>

					<p>I don&rsquo;t condone that stuff.  Much of the problem is due to many cops having authoritarian personalities.  They&rsquo;d have domineering personalities no matter what their profession.  However, it has to be difficult dealing with black thugs day in and day out.  I certainly don&rsquo;t envy cops in &#8220;diverse&#8221; cities.  And while racial profiling is a good idea, running over people with police cars is not.    </p>

					<p>Who cares? Blacks do and say far worse to and about Whites. Blacks need to be segregated and have their own police force. I am sure Black cops have done the same and worse. This is what desegregation has brought us. The two races can never be <span class="caps">FORCED </span>to live together. Another social experiment gone to the dogs.</p>

Now, now, people. Don&rsquo;t try to condone the use of racial slurs by police officers. They can do their job without crossing that line. What they <i>think</i> while doing their job is their own business, of course.</p>

How about a program on the hundred or more white officers murdered by black suspects each year?<br><br>
How about a program about the 30,000 white women raped by blacks each year (the reverse nearly non-existent)?<br><br>
How about a program about the over <span class="caps">ONE MILLION </span>white victims of violence at the hands of blacks each year (12 times the reverse)?<br><br>
How about a program investigating the <span class="caps">RACIST HATE </span>propaganda directed against whites that permeates places like black churches and academia?</p>

					<p>If you have ever worked or ran a business where blacks are the majority you would certainly understand why the white officers acted in the manner they did. </p>
<p>In Memphis. Tennessee (which is now a hell hole) if you are ever there, take a good look at the shopping centers and malls that are closed and are closing. As soon as they take over an area the metal bars, bullet proof glass and plywood go up, the robberies, killing, fights and car jacking go through the roof.</p>

					<p>A friend of mine has been a cop in Atlanta, GA for almost 20 years. I love to hear his stories about the stupid things that blacks do when they are arrested. One idiot went on a rant about how he was going to claim that my friend was a racist and that he violated his civil rights and called him the &#8220;N&#8221; word. Mike, my friend, asked him to repeat what he had just said - and the idiot did just that. Fortunately, Mike had the video camera on and everything was recorded. <br>
Mike has his &#8220;special&#8221; methods of dealing with the loud mouths that he arrests. My favorite is the &#8220;screen test.&#8221; When a perp has been handcuffed and put in the back seat of his patrol car Mike expects for him to keep his mouth shut. If he keeps on running his mouth he will slam on the brakes and send the arrestee face first into the divider between the front and back seat (years ago it was a wire screen). Of course, any marks on their face were caused when they were &#8220;resisting arrest.&#8221;<br><br>
This next story is not related to the subject matter - but it is really funny. Mike got a call that a hispanic male called 911 and said that another hispanic male would not get out of his car. Mike arrives at a convenience store where the call originated and finds the complaining hispanic male sitting on the curb drunk out of his mind and yelling &#8220;that <span class="caps">SOB </span>will not get out of my car. Mike walks over to the car and the guy &#8220;who will not get out of the car&#8221; is lodged in the windshield with his bloddy head on the front seat. The drunk Mexican had hit this guy on the interstate and it threw him through his windshield. Ya gotta love it!</p>

					<p>Black Ghetto thugs are America`s home grown Al Qeda. They hate whites and everything white except the stupid women who haunt their cribs, trading sex for crack.<br>
     All decent folks should spend a night on patrol with the cops in any big city. After that trip, all illusions about brotherhood and &#8221; The Audacity of Hope,&#8221; will be dashed forever. The cops travel in a world controlled by thugs and are watched every second by look outs and enemies.  The friends of the cops, decent black folks, are intimidated and murdered daily. Rememeber the charming, &#8221; Don`t snitch,&#8221; program in Jacksonville?<br><br>
     There is no difference in big city America after dark than in Baghdad or Basra. The streets are full of folks who would loot  the bodies of dead police officers and not come to their rescue if injured and dying on the street.<br><br>
     My only objection to the cop car chases is that the thugs were not splattered on the car hoods. The thugs have declared war on decent white and black men.We need to utterly destroy them and give them the same treatment we do the sand demons in Guantanamo.<br><br>

					<p>I am a lifelong resident of <span class="caps">SC. </span> I have experienced, firsthand, abusive behavior from both black and white highway patrolmen during routine traffic stops.  I believe there is a certain mindset to some in law enforcement that causes them to become little Hitlers.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is one thing to be stopped for speeding- it is entirely another thing to be stopped in a stolen car or after leaving the scene of an accident.  Let&rsquo;s face it- regardless of your race, if you are finally apprehended in SC after avoiding arrest in a stolen car, don&rsquo;t expect them to treat you very well.  Knowing arrest will be unpleasant is one primary reason civilized people choose to obey the law.</p>

					<p>Gee, I thought that when a police officere turned his flashers on and then the siren, that I was supposd to pull over and sit until he came to my car.  If those blacks did not do that and ran instead..then&hellip;please tell me, what was the officer supposed to do?  I think, handcuff him and if the black is running too fast, like mabye he practiced running with the thought that he may play football, he could outrun the officer.  Is the officer supposed to let him go because he is black?  I dont think so, that is the problem, they say he was a raciest, etc but its o.k. for the balck person to be racist to us whities, honkies, etc&hellip;guess the pol are afraid they will not get re-elected.  misfit</p>

<p>First of all, your friend should be behind bars himself! This is a gross abuse of power! He has no business being a police officer.</p>
<p>Snapjack:</p>
<p>No, I could not understand why police officers would mow down people with their cars, regardless of what they did.</p>
<p>While I realize that many police officers have a very stressful job, this fact in and of itself does not justify police officers injuring citizens and abusing their power!</p>
<p>Sometimes when I read some of the comments of some <span class="caps">AMREN </span>posters, it makes me wonder where the White realist movement is heading <br>

					<p>I am on both sides of the fence on this one. </p>
<p>First, one must not fail to recognize predictable human behavior, meaning, that since police overwhelmingly arrest/detain blacks, and, not without reason I might add, they are inclined to maintain a bias against them. Let&rsquo;s face it  &mdash;  aside from the liberals who continue to live in a fantasy world, most of us can read a news story can tell from the particulars of the crime what the demographics of the perpetrators are.  we know to avoid Africans except in very controlled environments where we are unlikely to be victimized by their highly impulsive behavioral patterns.  From the standpoint of law enforcement, it therefore becomes perfectly logical for police to maintain a heightened &#8220;edge&#8221; when facing Africans on the street.  They tend to resist arrest more, run more, lie more, etc.   Most significantly, they are decidedly more likely to be carrying weapons and most importantly, are incredibly more likely to use them against police.  Remember, if a policeman makes a mistake once i.e., let&rsquo;s down his guard, etc., he is <span class="caps">DEAD</span>! In short, as it pervades society, it becomes logical for Africans t receive &ldquo;special&rdquo; care.</p>
<p>ON the other hand, however, i understand how police can act when their behavior is completely unchecked. it is common, and for that matter accepted, for them to &#8220;bend the truth&#8221; and the like to increase the likelihood of a successful prosecution.  &ldquo;Profile-based&rdquo; stops are common though you never hear of them in Texas on I-40, for example, where they routinely find a reason to stop the unsuspecting motorist for things like &#8220;following too closely&#8221; and the like (which happened to me <span class="caps">BTW</span>) because the driver fit the profile of one who might be transporting narcotics.  The Supreme Court, mistakenly I might add, has given these officers the green light to, <span class="caps">WITHOUT </span>probable cause, bring out the dogs to sniff the vehicle. </p>
<p>As I mentioned previously, I was stopped on I-40 E, just west of Amarillo, for following a vehicle too closely in a construction zone!   At first, the exchange was rather cordial but I began to sense that he was suspicious of me, though, I might add, I wasn&rsquo;t doing anything wrong.  I was just a single, solitary white male driving a luxury vehicle cross country.  However, he accused me of telling a story that in his words, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t add up&rdquo;, and proceeded to insist that he was going to search the vehicle. The exchange went on for a few minutes and finally, just to tick him off, as I knew that he needed consent (this was in 2k2, before the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision), I allowed <span class="caps">HIM </span>to search so as to make him look like an idiot when he didn&rsquo;t find anything  &mdash;  which, of course, is what happened.  He pounded and pounded with his little rubber mallet, all the while carefully listening with a stethoscope when finally and much to his dismay, he found squat.</p>
<p>With respect to the later, it is amazing what one finds out from the &ldquo;common man.&rdquo;   I was traveling through the same area and stopped to get gas at a station a few miles from where I had been stopped the previous year. The owner told me that they brag about all of the reasons that they can find to stop a suspected vehicle.<br>

					<p>For the record, South Carolina has had a history of bad police officers. This goes as far back as 1990 when the newsmagazine Inside Edition did an investigative report on police officers in South Carolina. That was almost 20 years ago and they still sems to be having the same problems.</p>
<p>I am not tarring all the police officers in the state, but it has been well-known that police misconduct has been a significant problem there. Perhaps, there needs to be a revamping of how they select officers or the <span class="caps">U.S</span> Department of investigations needs to step in. Obviously something has to be done. The citizens of the Palmetto state deserve better!</p>

					<p>I see the self righteous &#8220;carpet baggers of criminal justice&#8221; have their feathers ruffled. My, how smug one can be when they have never been in the trenches!<br>
Perhaps I should have mentiond that I was a cop for four years. I, unlike Mike, couldn&rsquo;t take all the PC garbage, the verbal abuse, and the fear that my next perp was going to turn the tables on me with some bogus story that the PC district attorney would believe - and then press charges against me!<br><br>
Whether you like it or not, you need men like Mike out there on the street. In 20 years on the job he has been shot, nearly run down by fleeing felons, spit on, cursed at, threatened, and attended numerous funerals of his friends on the police force who were killed by no-good thugs. He is a highly decorated and well respected officer in his department - thank you very much!<br><br>
Maybe Mike, as some people do, embelished his story to add a bit of comic relief - I don&rsquo;t know. For all I know, the &#8220;screen test&#8221; could have happened only once and it was a matter of him getting so irritated at the perp that he slammed on his brakes. <br><br>
I must say this - don&rsquo;t presume that you have the &#8220;moral superiority&#8221; to pass judgement on someone like Mike who lives this life everyday. He walks up to vehicles frequently and wonders to himself if he will ever see his family again. I don&rsquo;t know how the man controls such fear. Until you pin on a badge, strap on a gun, and face the ugly world of the criminal mind, you would be better suited to just sit there in your house and pray to God that police officers like Mike don&rsquo;t just say &#8220;the hell with this.&#8221; <br><br>

					<p>For those in this thread saying that we shouldn&rsquo;t judge cops until we walk in their shoes   &mdash;   I agree.  I was able to use the St. Louis City Police Department&rsquo;s firearms simulator a number of years back.  What the FS does is give you a pretend gun, and you stand in front of a screen with what appears to be a real world law enforcement situation.  If you shoot the gun at one of the simulated objects, you will hit or miss the object virtually, depending on your aim.</p>
<p>After five scenarios and a night to sleep on it, I vowed never to second guess a cop ever again.  It&rsquo;s hard enough and tricky enough as it was, and the FS didn&rsquo;t contain the racial quicksand that is major inner cities like St. Louis.  Add the racial element on top of it, and it&rsquo;s virtually impossible to be a white cop in a black neighborhood.  You&rsquo;re always one accostation away from your career or life ending.</p>

					<p>Where is the same outpouring of concern when Blacks commit heinous crimes against Whites?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tired of the Left arguing that the highly disproportionate volume of misbehavior and crimes perpetrated by Blacks is excusable because &#8220;White people misbehave and commit crime too&#8221;.</p>
<p>Imagine a fictional litmus test where parents of any race are forced to send their children, unaccompanied, into a room to live unsupervised and unmonitored with strangers for a week. One room is occupied by Black people and the other room is occupied by White people. Nothing else is known about the inhabitants or conditions in either room. Which room would any rational parent choose to send their children into? What does normal risk assessment methodology suggest?</p>

					<p>I see all kinds of comments on these boards decrying black thuggery. Yet, I see so many comments on this board condoning and celebrating the abuse of power by cops. Whether blacks did anything to deserve this treatment or not is irrelevent. If the race realist movement wants <span class="caps">ANY </span>credibility, we need to be far above this. </p>

					<p>This is just police business as usual. The audio is about as real as it gets, and is nothing to deal with. A suspects runs away and he says hey &#8220;N9999 you stop now!&#8221; What is so bad? No one got shot, there is very little here that you dont see on cops, when they show cops taking down older white-trash women who barely say anything. This is all on videotape on <span class="caps">TV.</span> Where is all the video for this silly news clip? </p>
<p>It sounds like some kind of witchhunt is going on here. Remember, when cops <span class="caps">DONT </span>racial profile, as in cases in Cinncinatti and <span class="caps">LA, </span>the violence goes <span class="caps">OUT</span> OF <span class="caps">CONTROL.</span></p>

<p>Like you, I am a race realist. You are exactly right! While criminals deserved to be prosecuted for their crimes, this is no justification for police officers to abuse their power toward citizens. Police misconduct must be denounced and officers who engage in such misbehaviour should be prosecuted and placed behind bars themselves.</p>
<p>On another note, I beleive that a number of people who post on this board are not race realists, but rather, race nationalists. Race realists examine things from a more sensible, pragmatic and I would dare to say, humane perspective.</p>
<p>Secondly, I agree with you that we must make a greater effort to distinguish ourselves from race nationalists and more extreme groups. They will not do anything to advance our movement. If anything, they will discourage more rational minded Whites from joining our cause, </p>

					<p>First, this would never have been a story were it not for the racial aspect.<br>
Second, police officers represent the law and should follow it.<br><br>
Third, ever since becoming a reserve deputy I have learned to appreciate the outlook of the police a little better and am very careful about judging them.  Remember that every time a cop walks up to a car, especially a car full of blacks, there is a real chance that he will be assaulted, shot at or killed.  Think about that when judging the behavior of the police.  And don&rsquo;t forget that we need good police on our streets and the ones who do it everyday deserve a great deal of respect.</p>
<p>Just one more thing to add: I am a reserve deputy, which means that when I am on duty I am a cop.  I do it part time.  The rest of the time I work in the operating room taking care of giving anesthesia to my patients(yes, I am a doctor, an anesthesiologist).  So, no, we are not all examples of the &#8220;authoritarian personality&#8221; although I don&rsquo;t doubt that it can play a part in the behavior of what I consider to be bad cops.</p>

					<p>Truly the real story is that the US Justice Dept has to get involved. If it were a state outside the South they would unlikely automatically investigate. The South is always on the chopping block by the feds, and the rest of the brainwashed country. I&rsquo;m sick of it. We can handle our own problems, including unprofessional cops. And by the way  &mdash;  as a resident here, I can say that the city cops are far, far worse than the usually professional Highway patrol.</p>
<p>I wish that the South had won. Let it fall, boys, let it fall. Soon, soon.</p>

					<p>What I have noticed is that many of the posters here are remarkably articulate and well informed. I am assuming that all are whites, thoroughly sick of multiculturalism, mass immigration and black con games. There are coherent powerful arguments to support these movements, our movement. There is a very very real possibility that Whites will become a powerless<br>
marginalized force in the very civilization we created..unless we fight back, unless we become a mass movement. We will <span class="caps">NEVER </span>become a mass movement of middle class whites who have &#8220;had enough&#8221; UNTIL WE <span class="caps">DISASSOCIATE OURSELVES FROM WHITE </span>&#8220;SUPREMACISTS&#8221;. The Nazi regalia, the skin head, the <br><br>
violence are all disgusting to most of us. If this movement is to go forward we behave in the very ways that wont allow others to stereotype us as a lunatic fringe to be ignored. Good manners, high civility, articulate coherent arguments, are weapons our opponents can never match. Think you can out scream<br><br>
out vulgarize a 300 lb black welfare mama? Think again.</p>

					<p>Statistics show that oftentimes police officers are the guys who were frequently the bullies, the dumb jocks, less than academically stellar boys who resented the smart college bound kids.</p>

I can understand the frustration dealing with criminals but you can&rsquo;t go down to their despicable anarchial level.Get into another line of work to avoid these low-lifes.</p>

					<p>Dave:</p>
<p>As a 26 year old Black man who works in advertising, No I do not &#8220;love it!&#8221; to use your sick, twisted mindset!</p>
<p>To give an example, one weekend, last October, I was driving back from a party at a fellow colleague&rsquo;s home. I live in a midwestern town with a very small Black population. It was about 1:30am.  As I was driving along, a police car comes up behind me and flashes it&rsquo;s lights. I stop and pull over to the side of the road. </p>
<p>These two tall huge White police officers get out of the car. They must be at least 6&rsquo;1 and over 220lbs. They look to be in their mid to late 20s. They were in good shape. I am 5&rsquo;6, 155lbs. I also do not have facial hair or a mustache, thus I look more like someone who is 19 or 20 as opposed to 26. </p>
<p>One walks toward the left of the car. The other toward the right. We are on the middle of a highway and there are no other cars in sight. My blood pressure begins to rise. One of the officers taps his baton on my left window. I roll down my window and he asks me for my license and proof of insurance. I provide him with information for both of his requests. He asks me to get out of my car so he can perform a breathelizer test on me. They do and found out that I had not been drinking heavily. In fact, I drink very lightly!</p>
<p>Both officers then ask me to do ten jumping jacks and ten sit ups. I was taken aback by such a request and I wanted to question them, but I was admittedly too fearlful to question or disobey them. After I was able to make only 6 push ups, the officers started laughing and said &#8220;okay get up little boy, you are a weakling. you would have never made it past police training.&#8221;  Mind you I am 26 years old and they still felt that it was totally permissible to refer to a grown man as a &#8220;little boy&#8221; and efer to me as a &#8220;weakling.&#8221; I was so angry inside, but I contained it.  </p>
<p>Then as if was not humiliating enough, they checked my car for drugs. One of them started adjusting my car radio listening to various music stations while the other was searching my trunk and seats. I could not beleive what was going on. </p>
<p>The last thing they made me do was squat down on my knees and lift my hands up as one of them stood in front of me and the other in back of me. Afterwards, they decided that although I was driving too fast (which was a lie), that they would let me off this time. As they were driving off, I saw both of them laughing! They had harrassed and humiliated me! Moreover, I had no witnessees.   </p>
<p>After this ordeal, I was so shaken that I stopped at the local hotel a two miles down the road and stayed there overnight. By midday next morning I had had a good night sleep and was functioning back to normal, checked out of the hotel and headed home to my apartment.  </p>
<p>When police officers misuse and abuse their authority we are all in danger! There is nothing funny about police misconduct Dave!</p>

<p>I think you make a very good point about the race realist vs race nationalist argument. A rece relaist would not condone police brutality against nyone regadless of race. We are too aware of the importance of a civil soicety.</p>
<p>I think that the nationalists make it much more difficult for the movement to gain any real progress. We must learn how to effectively distance ourselves from them.</p>

					<p>Arrogence and abuse of power can never be attractive to civil people, take the murder of Randy Weaver&rsquo;s wife and son or The Waco compound slaughter at the hands of the <span class="caps">FED&rsquo;S, </span>its not attractive to see this abuse. Concerning the N word directed at a man fleeing a car containing drugs and a weapon,its not very polite  but then the jungle is not a house where manors rule, and I&rsquo;m sure these cops see allot more primitivism than their judges realize.</p>

<p>Normally I am skeptical of Blacks who post on this board(and of some other Whites too for that matter); however, I do believe your story. I am White and had a 21 year old nephew (then 19) who was detained by two police officers (both were White) in 2006 who claimed that he and his friend were speeding. Which they (my nephew and his friend) adamantly deny.</p>
<p>When they pulled he and his friend over, he asked them (the police officers)what did he and his friend do wrong. One of the police officers told them to &#8220;shut up&#8221; began cursing them and making insulting remarks to them. He then ordered him (my nephew)to give him a license and proof of insurance. He asked for his friend&rsquo;s license as well and ordered them out of the car. They both obliged the officer&rsquo;s request. <br>
 <br><br>
The officer in question gave the two license to the other one who according to my nephew was laughing inappropriately as the other officer was making rude comments to them.</p>
<p>The &#8220;amused&#8221; officer apparently ran their licenses to see if they had any criminal records etc&hellip; After he returned he informed Landon (my nephew) that they would be checking the car for drugs and alcohol. They found nothing!  </p>
<p>After realizing there was nothing, did not even apologize, rather they told my nephew that they would &#8220;cut him some slack this time,&#8221; even though they &#8220;smelled alcohol in the car, but next time, they owuld not be so easy on them.&#8221; For the record, Landon does not even drink. Nor did his friend from what he told me.</p>
<p>Both officers got back in their police car and took off. Like you my nephew and his friend were angry and scared. Those officers could have planted drugs or did a number of unethical things to my nephew and his friend. </p>
<p>Such behavior by police officers has made me change my view of law enforcement. If anything, I am more distrustful of them than I used to be.</p>
<p>Sorry for your ordeal.</p>

					<p>Did you see <span class="caps">THIS </span>in today&rsquo;s news:<br>
https://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,346152,00.html<br><br>
&#8220;&hellip;Jaguars cornerback Brian Williams&rsquo; racist rant to police the night he was arrested&hellip;&#8221; &#8220;The police officer involved wrote &hellip;that Williams called him &#8220;Honky mother (expletive),&#8221; and said, &#8220;I (expletive) your momma &hellip; I (expletive) your wife twice.&#8221;  &ldquo;Williams allegedly went on to say he would do something to the officer&rsquo;s daughter, &hellip;.&#8221; &#8220;&hellip;Williams had recently signed a multimillion dollar deal with the Jaguars&#8221;  &#8220;&hellip;The officer stated Williams told him his car cost more than the officer would ever make.&#8221;</p>
<p>So this racist multi-millionaire spoiled black football player uses racist slurs against this white police officer, makes sexually explicit comments against the officers mother and wife, and threatens the officers daughter. Fits pattern of blacks who try to provoke white officers so they can then scream &#8220;racism&#8221; and play the victim. There&rsquo;s more to what your told by the media when there is some video of a police officer hauling off on a black arrestee. I don&rsquo;t know about you, but if someone called me a racial slur, make lewd remarks about my mom and wife, and threatened my daughter&hellip;.. What would you do?<br>

<p>I would not use racial slurs against him (that would have me sinking to his gutter level)I would not run him over with a car or violate his civil rights in unnecesary ways.</p>
