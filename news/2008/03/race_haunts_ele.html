<h1><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23743895/">Race Haunts Election After Shootings</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, March 21, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Six weeks after a deadly shooting rampage rife with racial overtones in Kirkwood&rsquo;s City Council chambers, the issue of race has spilled over into the contest for mayor of this St. Louis suburb and produced a uniquely tense campaign. </p>
<p>A community activist, Michael Moore, is running as the sole black candidate in the four-way contest and has portrayed the Feb. 7 rampage as a symptom of smoldering black resentment in Kirkwood. </p>
<p>At a recent standing-room-only candidate forum, the 37-year-old truck mechanic let voters know he wants to overhaul a city government that he says ignores poor, black residents of a neighborhood known as Meacham Park. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I think if the truth comes out about Meacham Park &hellip; I think you&rsquo;ll understand the things that are going on. Even if I don&rsquo;t condone it,&rdquo; Moore told the crowd. And in a later interview, he warned: &ldquo;Until the truth comes out, mark my words: Something else is going to happen.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Some spectators squirmed as Moore made repeated references to the night a black Kirkwood resident, Charles &ldquo;Cookie&rdquo; Thornton, opened fire inside City Hall and killed five white people, including three city officials, before being gunned down by police. Mayor Mike Swoboda <br>
was critically wounded. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Moore doesn&rsquo;t seem to have attracted a large following in Kirkwood, a city of about 27,000 people, 91 percent of them white. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The guy obviously has an issue,&rdquo; Charles Walbaum, who is white, said after the forum. &ldquo;He has a race issue. That&rsquo;s the only thing he could talk about. Granted, there are issues.&rdquo; But as for the shooting rampage, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not convinced it was a black-and-white issue.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Moore and Thornton were neighbors in largely black Meacham Park, which has a long history of uneasy race relations with surrounding sections of Kirkwood. </p>
<p><strong>Development stokes tensions</strong></p>
<p>Kirkwood annexed Meacham Park more than a decade ago. Soon after, the city leveled neighborhoods there and helped build a strip of big-box stores, stoking tensions that remain high today. </p>
<p>In 2005, a black Meacham Park resident murdered a white police officer in his patrol car, widening the divisions. The killer said at his trial he was furious that police had not done more to save his 12-year- old brother when the boy collapsed and died of a heart defect earlier <br>
in the day. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the first City Council meeting after the shooting, City Attorney John Hessel explained that in his opinion, state law prohibits postponing the election or adding a candidate to the ballot. Members of the audience who had begun the meeting with a moment of silence for <br>
the dead booed and jeered Hessel. </p>
<p>Hessel hung his head and closed his eyes. Just two weeks earlier, he hid behind the dais as Thornton gunned down his victims. Hessel survived by throwing a chair in Thornton&rsquo;s direction and running. </p>
<p>&ldquo;For people to come out and attack me after such a short period of time, with a complete disregard for what had previously taken place, I was stunned by that and terribly disappointed,&rdquo; Hessel said. </p>
<p>While the political atmosphere is tense, Moore said the shooting rampage might indirectly help the city. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The community wants to understand the problems that are going on,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think it has opened people up. Out of a very bad situation, a good thing happened.&rdquo;<br>
