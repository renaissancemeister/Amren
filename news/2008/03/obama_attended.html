						<p>Obama claims he was completely unaware that the Reverend Wright&rsquo;s trademark preaching style at the Trinity United Church of Christ targeted &#8220;white&#8221; America.</p>
<p>Clarification: The Obama campaign has told members of the press that Senator Obama was not in church on the day cited, July 22, because he had a speech he gave in Miami at 1:30 PM. Our writer, Jim Davis, says he attended several services at Senator Obama&rsquo;s church during the month of July, including July 22. The church holds services three times every Sunday at 7:30 and 11 a.m. and 6 p.m. Central time. While both the early morning and evening service allowed Sen. Obama to attend the service and still give a speech in Miami, Mr. Davis stands by his story that during one of the services he attended during the month of July, Senator Obama was present and sat through the sermon given by Rev. Wright as described in the story. Mr. Davis said Secret Service were also present in the church during Senator Obama&rsquo;s attendance. Mr. Davis&rsquo; story was first published on Newsmax on August 9, 2007. Shortly before publication, Mr. Davis contacted the press office of Sen. Obama several times for comment about the Senator&rsquo;s attendance and Rev. Wright&rsquo;s comments during his sermon. The Senator&rsquo;s office declined to comment.</p>
<p>**************************</p>
<p>Contrary to Senator Barack Obama&rsquo;s claim that he never heard his pastor Jeremiah A. Wright, Jr. preach hatred of America, Obama was in the pews last July 22 when the minister blamed the &#8220;white arrogance&#8221; of America&rsquo;s Caucasian majority for the world&rsquo;s suffering, especially the oppression of blacks.</p>
<p>Senator Obama has sought to separate himself from his pastor&rsquo;s incendiary remarks, issuing a statement Friday rejecting them as &#8220;inflammatory and appalling&#8221; but failing to renounce Wright himself for his venomous and paranoid denunciations of America.</p>
<p>In his press release, Obama claimed, &#8220;The statements that Rev. Wright made that are the cause of this controversy were not statements I personally heard him preach while I sat in the pews of Trinity [United Church of Christ] or heard him utter in private conversation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Appearing on cable news shows this past weekend, Obama claimed when he saw recent videos that have Wright making such comments as &#8220;God damn America,&#8221; he was &#8220;shocked.&#8221; Obama implied that the reverend had not used such derogatory language in any of the church services Obama attended over the past two decades.</p>
<p>If Obama&rsquo;s claims are true that he was completely unaware that Wright&rsquo;s trademark preaching style at the Trinity United Church of Christ has targeted &#8220;white&#8221; America and Israel, he would have been one of the few people in Chicago to be so uninformed. Wright&rsquo;s reputation for spewing hate is well known.</p>
<p>In fact, Obama was present in the South Side Chicago church on July 22 last year when Jim Davis, a freelance correspondent for Newsmax, attended services along with Obama. [See: &#8220;Obama&rsquo;s Church: Cauldron of Division.&#8221;]</p>
<p>In his sermon that day, Wright tore into America, referring to the &#8220;United States of White America&#8221; and lacing his sermon with expletives as Obama listened. Hearing Wright&rsquo;s attacks on his own country, Obama had the opportunity to walk out, but Davis said the senator sat in his pew and nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Reverend Wright&rsquo;s anti-white theology that Senator Obama expressed surprise over is evident on the church&rsquo;s website. The site says the congregation subscribes to what it calls the Black Value System, which is described as a disavowal of &#8220;our racist competitive society&#8221; and the pursuit of &#8220;middle-classness.&#8221; That is defined as a way for American society to &#8220;snare&#8221; blacks rather than &#8220;killing them off directly&#8221; or &#8220;placing them in concentration camps,&#8221; just as the country structures &#8220;an economic environment that induces captive youth to fill the jails and prisons.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the 21st century, white America got a wake-up call after 9/11/01,&#8221; Wright wrote in the church-affiliated magazine Trumpet four years after the attacks. &#8220;White America and the western world came to realize that people of color had not gone away, faded into the woodwork or just &lsquo;disappeared&rsquo; as the Great White West kept on its merry way of ignoring black concerns.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Relationship Unravels</p>
<p>Senator Obama now is attempting to minimize his long and close relationship with the controversial minister.</p>
<p>On Friday, John McCain&rsquo;s campaign distributed a Wall Street Journal op-ed &#8220;Obama and the Minister&#8221; written under my byline based on my reporting for Newsmax going back to early January of this year.</p>
<p>The op-ed included details of a sermon Wright gave at Howard University blaming America for starting the AIDS virus, training professional killers, importing drugs, shamelessly supporting Israel, and creating a racist society that would never elect a black man as president. [See: &#8220;Obama&rsquo;s Minister&rsquo;s Hatred of America.&#8221;]</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Saying he strongly condemns Wright&rsquo;s comments, Obama continued, &#8220;I categorically denounce any statement that disparages our great country or serves to divide us from our allies. I also believe that words that degrade individuals have no place in our public dialogue, whether it&rsquo;s on the campaign stump or in the pulpit. In sum, I reject outright the statements by Rev. Wright that are at issue.&#8221; [emphasis added]</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama went on to claim that he first learned about Wright&rsquo;s controversial statements when he began his presidential campaign. But this assertion conflicts with the fact that just before Obama&rsquo;s nationally televised campaign kickoff rally on Feb. 10, 2007, the candidate disinvited Wright from giving the public invocation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Apparently Obama never foresaw Wright&rsquo;s sermons making national television or becoming a sensation on YouTube. But lending graphic detail to the saga, ABC News and other networks began running a 2003 sermon in which Wright said, &#8220;The government gives them the drugs, builds bigger prisons, passes a three-strike law and then wants us to sing &lsquo;God Bless America.&rsquo; No, no, no, God damn America, that&rsquo;s in the Bible, for killing innocent people &hellip; God damn America for treating our citizens as less than human. God damn America for as long as she acts like she is God and she is supreme.&#8221; [Click Here to see video]</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&rsquo;re black, it&rsquo;s hard to say what you truly think and not upset white people,&#8221; the New York Times quoted James Cone as saying. Cone is a professor at Union Theological Seminary and the father of what is known as black liberation theology.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama often refers to Wright as being &#8220;like an old uncle, who sometimes says things I don&rsquo;t agree with.&#8221; Wright is not Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;uncle&#8221; &mdash; a person born into a blood relationship &mdash; but a man he has cultivated for decades as a close friend, mentor and adviser.</p>
<p>After Newsmax broke the story on Jan. 14 that Wright&rsquo;s church gave an award to Louis Farrakhan in December for lifetime achievement, Obama again sought to denounce his minister&rsquo;s action without criticizing Wright himself.</p>
<p>Like Wright, Farrakhan has repeatedly made hate-filled statements targeting Jews (calling Judaism a &#8220;gutter religion&#8221;), whites, and America. He has called whites &#8220;blue-eyed devils&#8221; and the &#8220;anti-Christ.&#8221; He has described Jews as &#8220;bloodsuckers&#8221; who control the government, the media, and some black organizations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Again, Obama was careful not to condemn Farrakhan himself or Wright who had spoken adoringly of Farrakhan and put their church behind the award to the controversial Nation of Islam leader.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Having gotten away with sidestepping Wright&rsquo;s adoring comments about Farrakhan, Obama told Jewish leaders flatly in Cleveland on Jan. 24 that the award was because of Farrakhan&rsquo;s work with ex-offenders. To date, no news outlet has pointed out that Obama&rsquo;s claim is false.</p>
<p>Obama went on to explain away Wright&rsquo;s anti-Zionist statements as being rooted in his anger over the Jewish state&rsquo;s support for South Africa under its previous policy of apartheid. As with his claim that the award to Farrakhan was made because of his work with ex-offenders, Obama made that up. Wright&rsquo;s statements denouncing Israel have not been qualified in any way.</p>
<p>On Fox News&rsquo; Hannity &amp; Colmes on Friday, Obama said he would have quit the church if he had &#8220;repeatedly&#8221; been present when Wright made inflammatory statements. He was not asked why he did not quit the church when it gave an award to Farrakhan.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

			<p>Whether Obama personally attended these sermons or not is really irrelevant.  His pastors views were well-known to Obama and his associations with the man are an endorsement of those views.  Obama is a modern day Malcolm X who has been smart enough to somewhat conceal his radicalism and racial politics.  I think this story will destroy Obama&rsquo;s chances of becoming president.  His black supporters and liberal, white college student supporters will likely continue to be entranced with Obamania.  However, his associations with Wright will cause his support amongst moderates and independents to virtually disappear.  Not to mention, this story will give Hillary&rsquo;s superdelegates the cover they need to override the popular vote - i.e. they will be able to say that Obama won all of these primaries before this story surfaced and that he has no chance to win in November so they must do what&rsquo;s best for the party.  Either way, things are going to get VERY interesting at the Democratic Convention.</p>

			<p>Pat Buchanan so ably pointed out a few weeks ago that if Obama has more delegates and votes than HRC in all the primaries (even if it&rsquo;s not 2,025), then the superdelegates will go to Obama because &#8220;They&rsquo;re not the kind of people that like to ride to the Alamo.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m beginning to have second thoughts, but for the same reason.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget that the Alamo was two things: First, it was a fight between the Texas separatists and the Mexican Army. Second, it was a huge defeat for the Texas separatists.</p>
<p>The Democrat superdels won&rsquo;t want to &ldquo;ride to the Alamo&rdquo; in the sense that they want to pick an impossible fight (i.e. give the nomination to HRC even if Obama wins more delegates and votes). But they also don&rsquo;t wan to &ldquo;ride to the Alamo&rdquo; in the sense that they want to get wiped out Alamo-like.</p>
<p>And with the MSM finally giving legs to the Wright-TUCC affair that us right-wingers have been squaking about for months, the Obama shine is turning to rust, and with each passing day, it becomes more and more evident that he&rsquo;s not electable in November. The anti-white and anti-Semitic rhetoric espoused on the part of the Wright/Farrakhan axis has irreparably burnt bridges between the Obama campaign and white and Jewish voters, or at least enough of the former. (Though, when it comes to black radicals, anti-Semitic rhetoric is anti-white rhetoric).</p>
<p>The Democrat establishment will find a way to throw this to Hillary. If that doesn&rsquo;t happen, then the Democrats can forget about Florida, and even reliably blue states with a lot of Jewish and Chicano Hispanic voters like New York and California will be in play.</p>

			<p>This would be almost as comical as Bill Clinton&rsquo;s claim that, while he smoked marijuana, he did not inhale. However, this is more serious, in that Obama purportedly is the candidate of new ideas, and he is kissing up to a slf-styled hater. Do we really wanty him as president?</p>
<p>His phony-baloney cover is blown. Now the Beast has revealed himself for what he really is.</p>

			<p>If there&rsquo;s any horse sense left in White Americans, this will be the end of Obama.</p>
<p>Of course he was there.  A person can&rsquo;t attend a church for as long as Obama has attended that church and NOT be present during at least one or two raving sermons of this Wright fellow.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad this information is finally getting out to the public.  We&rsquo;ll see how America reacts.</p>

<p>Yes and I have visited the National Aliance and David Duke websites for the past 5 years and I never noticed that they have this thing about Jews.I would also like to know tghe percentage of White blood that the BLACK people have that attends Barack Obamas church.I get the idea that BLACK who really hate whites the most are mostly Mulattos and Quadroons with the exception of Shelby Steele.</p>

			<p>Well whaddya know.  Obama&rsquo;s a racist AND a liar.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter though, Clinton committed perjury, raped juanita broderick, accepted bribes, molested paula jones and kathleen willey and even murdered dozens of people (hundreds if you count the branch dravidians.)  He also sold nuclear secrets to China, started a war with Serbia, and welcomed America&rsquo;s &#8216;third revolution&rsquo; where whites would become the fading minority of the country.  I don&rsquo;t care if Obama eats babies for breakfast, nothing can ever be worse than the Clintons.</p>

<p>As a side note, I wonder how Hillary felt when she found out that MIssissippi&rsquo;s Blacks spit in her deluded liberal face and voted 97% along racial lines.</p>

			<p> It&rsquo;s obvious that the Rev. Mr. Wright is a typical black preacher, both paranoid and fond of feeling sorry for his poor, beknighted black brethren. His ranting and raving about the Satanic Whitey, so to speak, makes one wonder if Barack Obama was not alone in that church in feeling he was &#8220;not black enough.&#8221; Look at Wright&rsquo;s picture; he&rsquo;s lighter-skinned even than Obama. Maybe he&rsquo;s three quarters White, instead of just half like his protege the senator.</p>
<p> Obama&rsquo;s claim that he wasn&rsquo;t in attendance when Wright said any of these racist, hateful things about Whites rings about as true as a lead dollar. If he managed to miss every service where Wright was screaming his virulence, then he must have missed half the sermons of the last 20 years. But even if he didn&rsquo;t actually hear the invective, does anyone seriously believe that he wouldn&rsquo;t have heard about it in the church? If he went for 20 years without knowing about something like that going on right under his nose, then he&rsquo;s OBVIOUSLY (or should I say, OBAMAOUSLY?) not fit to be president.</p>

			<p>This is a shame.  I was hoping that the fools of America would elect BHO President, and reap the consequences, but it seems that the MSM is doing Hilary&rsquo;s work for her.  We&rsquo;ll have a choice in the fall between an old do-nothing and a communist in the pay of China.  Obama would have brought us chaos, instead of mere stagnancy and decline.   </p>

<p>Whether Barack Hussein Obama (aka Barry Soetoro) attended any particular service might be interesting, but it isn&rsquo;t really relevant. He&rsquo;s known the extremist Jeremiah A. Wright, Jr. for the two decades or so that he&rsquo;s been a member of that black-separatist church, and he has long looked upon Wright as an adviser and mentor. Now, THAT is relevant. </p>

			<p>&#8220;the minister blamed the &ldquo;white arrogance&rdquo; of America&rsquo;s Caucasian majority for the world&rsquo;s suffering, especially the oppression of blacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>And what do you think will happen when Obama wins?  They&rsquo;ll stop blaming Whites?  </p>
<p>Get ready folks, a Zebra doesn&rsquo;t change its stripes.</p>
<p>Whites will be blamed for,</p>
<p>Education<br/>
The failure of the Family and the breakdown of Society<br/>
The Economy<br/>
All relations Foriegn and Domestic<br/>
Race Relations (of course)<br/>
They&rsquo;ll be blamed for the details as well.  Like, not enough raisins in ones Raisin Bran, and forgetting to flush the toilet even though you have guests over for dinner.<br/>
And, last but not least (though obviously the list could go on and on) every last loving mistake Obama makes in the White House.</p>
<p>I lived among Blacks nearly all of my life, with one half of that life studying psychological pathologies. The lack of accountability (or, a little more direct, the inability to tell the truth, or, the very direct, LYING) is, with Blacks, a pathology.  That they are not allowed to be criticized has only enabled the pathology to grow.  And this unconscienable, irresponsible, enabling came from Whites with no direct relation with Blacks (who, btw, account for the overwhelming majority of Whites who have voted for Obama); Whites who also go out of their way to silence or demonize (same thing) Whites with lots of personal contact with Blacks.  This behavior of said Whites most certainly counts as a pathology in my book.  But what IS a pathology?</p>
<p>A pathology is described, in the sense used here, as a mood-altering substance, attitude, or belief, that is designed to remove the person from reality and its attendent responsibilities; when it becomes a full blown addiction, one that determines ones every move, it carries with it life-damaging consequences.  And, of course, the responsibility of the consequences are avoided by the addict like the plague.</p>
<p>Blacks will never give up this addiction, and neither will their shallow and sentimental White enablers; especially at a time when both are working hard to put a symptom of this sickness into the White House.</p>
<p>There are two directions this will go (notice I said &#8220;will&#8221;, not could).</p>
<p>1- the addicts in this case will hit bottom and begin to work their way out of their addiction.</p>
<p>2- the addicts in this case will hit bottom and NOT work their way out of their addiction but actually go deeper into it until they come to an explosive and violent end.</p>
<p>There IS no other option.</p>

			<p>The point is: Has Obama ever spoken out AGAINST the hatred Blacks feel for Whites? If not, WHY not?</p>
<p>For a man wanting to bring &#8220;change&#8221;, Obama has been strangely silent on the problem of race relations and the hatred and Black-on-White violence and crime. Posturing and &#8220;distancing&#8221; himself from his pastor/uncle is hardly the same as reasoning with Wright BEFORE Wright delivered his racist rantings!</p>

Obama&rsquo;s protestations of innocence   &mdash;   to have attended this church regularly FOR TWENTY YEARS and yet conveniently just happened NEVER to be in attendance on those Sundays when these &#8220;controversial&#8221; &#8220;sermons&#8221; were being &#8220;preached&#8221;   &mdash;   were simply not credible. It&rsquo;s as ludicrous an assertion as Bill Clinton&rsquo;s disclaimer that he &#8220;didn&rsquo;t inhale.&#8221; <br/>
 <br/>
OF COURSE Obama was &#8220;in da house&#8221; when this stuff was being said. And OF COURSE he just sat there nodding without challenging it in any way   &mdash;   either before or after the service   &mdash;   because (to perhaps a milder degree) HE BELIEVES THIS STUFF HIMSELF. <br/>
 <br/>
Although these revelations about Brutha Jeremiah may   &mdash;   and I stress MAY   &mdash;   be enough to shake white liberals out of their Diversitoid stupor and torpedo the Obama juggernaut for THIS election year, we still won&rsquo;t be rid of this guy. </p>
<p>My guess is, even if we dodge the &#8220;Obama in 2008&#8221; bullet, we&rsquo;ll still have to dodge future bullets marked &#8220;Obama in 2012&#8221; and &#8220;Obama in 2016&#8221; and &#8220;Obama in 2020,&#8221; etc. He&rsquo;ll become a permanent fixture   &mdash;   and a perennial THREAT   &mdash;   on the presidential-election circuit. And with each time America that fails to elect him, louder will grow the howls of &#8220;white supremacy&#8221; from his supporters. </p>
<p>In fact, with each passing cycle, it will get worse   &mdash;   for the Obamaniacs will be able to taunt us with, &#8220;OK, back in &#8216;08 you said it wasn&rsquo;t racism that stopped you from voting for him, but his lack of experience. Well by now he IS experienced enough   &mdash;   and if you don&rsquo;t vote for him THIS time, then you really ARE a racist!&#8221; </p>
<p>And if not Obama, then some other nonwhite who&rsquo;s just as bad or (if possible) worse. From now on, we can expect Obama or an Obama-surrogate from the Democrats in EVERY election year&hellip; FOREVER. </p>
<p><br/>
PS. Interesting tidbit about BHO&rsquo;s fellow Chicago-resident Oprah Winfrey having left TUCC years ago due to her discomfort with Wright&rsquo;s inflammatory rhetoric. Although I&rsquo;m not generally a fan of hers, Oprah apparently has more credibility and integrity than the man who might be our next president. <br/>

What are the other possibilities; The angry, feminist, womanoid, who will bring more of the usual &#8216;business&rsquo;, or the resurrected hope of the republican party, and criminal warmonger? Let Obama win, and watch him build his administration around the Sharpton/Jackson types. If that doesn&rsquo;t wake the sleeping masses, nothing will.</p>

			<p>At this point, I don&rsquo;t know which is going to be sweeter:</p>
<p>1.  Obama wins the nomination and suffers the largest, most crushing defeat ever seen in US politics, permanently damaging the image of the democrats and probably handing control of Congress back to the republicans.  It will be decades before the dems become a viable political force again.  Serves them right.</p>
<p>2.  The superdelegates wisely try to avoid this by nominating Clinton.  At this point there is no way to avoid the fact that the superdelegates are the ones who will choose the democratic nominee.  Neither condidate can win a margin now to counteract their decision.  Probably, they will be more interested in viability, than ideology.</p>
<p>There is a bit of a problem though.  Blacks will not stand for that.  They would barely stand for Obama losing the nomination by popular vote.  But to lose it to backroom politicking?  The left is already lodging death threats and planning to riot if Obama doesn&rsquo;t get the nomination.  The situation is explosive and WILL turn violent.</p>
<p>This ALSO will cause a landslide defeat for the dems but for a different reason&hellip;.withdrawal of nearly the entire block of the black vote, perhaps forever.  Likely, the rest of the far left will go with them.  Likely, they will form a third party (or merge with another radical party).  Although the third party will quickly atrophy and die, the democrats won&rsquo;t recover from the loss for decades and will likely lose majority in Congress.</p>
<p>I just can&rsquo;t see how the democrats can avoid disaster, at this point.</p>
<p>Way to lower the bar, Barack!</p>

			<p>If anyone still has trouble believing Obama has a credibility gap, try this excerpt from the Philadelphia Inquirer:</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;For the first time, Obama publicly acknowledged he had heard some &#8220;controversial&#8221; remarks from the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, his spiritual mentor and former pastor of the Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago. He condemned remarks in some of Wright&rsquo;s sermons that blamed the U.S. for the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and accused America of being irredeemably racist</p>
<p>He was there. He was not there. He heard some remarks. We reasonably intelligent Whites are really going to believe this to be the FIRST anti-White venom spewed by Wright? That Obama never heard Wright spouting his racist poison and didn&rsquo;t make even a token effort to rationalize with the preacher can be taken for granted. This Obama is what so many misguided White dupes want for the next President?  Like John Stossel was wont to say: &#8220;GIMME A BREAK!&#8221;</p>
<p>Does Obama really think those Blacks (the prisons comment) are jailed because they&rsquo;re innocents? That the Philadelphia criminals in Lewisburg, Graterfors and Riverbend and others are simply the victims of bad legal representation?</p>
<p>Obama glossed over Wright&rsquo;s vitriolic harrangue. Which in Obama&rsquo;s case would be the same as tacit approval of his preacher&rsquo;s racist rant. Think about it, people. Think about it!</p>

			<p>The ruthlessness of the Clintons unleashed upon the black racist Obama!! This is one of the greatest spectacles in the history of American politics! If this was Obama vs a Republican nobody would have heard of Rev. Wright until he gave the inaugural benediction. But the Clintons have finally gave their marching orders to their media lackeys - the spectre of Vince Foster is still pretty powerful. </p>
<p>Previously, Clinton vs. Obama is a little like choosing sides in the Iran-Iraq war. Is one really worse than the other? Qualtitatively, no. Just like Obama&rsquo;s people, however, I am going to root for &#8216;my people&rsquo; as represented by Hillary for the Democratic nomination - but I&rsquo;m still going to hold my nose and vote for McCain in the fall.<br/>

			<p>As I&rsquo;ve said all along&hellip;  Barack Obama truly scares me&hellip;  And now the chickens have come home to roost!  </p>
<p>Of course, we here at AmRen, have known about Obama&rsquo;s black power church for months; so I blame the MSM for not releasing this information much sooner.  But then, what else is new?  Our coporate-controlled MSM hardly ever give us the truth about anything!  Anyway, I&rsquo;m glad that this &#8220;truth&#8221; finally hit the fan because it&rsquo;s better late than never.</p>
<p>This so-called pastor, Jeremiah White, is an absolute disgrace!  He is nothing but a racist, anti-American hate-monger and to think that this was Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;spiritual advisor, mentor and friend&#8221;?  Give me a break!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also angry with the blatant double standard in our society!  Imus comes out with one single &#8220;racial&#8221; statement, and the poor guy is chastized for months; yet, White preaches pure evil racism for 30 years, but we must put it in &#8220;context&#8221; because of all of the suffering we caused our black brethen all those years ago&hellip;</p>
<p>Barack Obama attended this church for 20 years!  This &#8220;pastor&#8221; married Barack and Michelle and baptised their daughters!  This pastor was the head of Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;African-American Religious Leadership Committee&#8221; during his campaign.  Obama donated $22,500 to this church just in 2006&hellip;  And now he expects me to believe that he had no idea what his advisor, mentor and friend was preaching for all of these years?  He had no idea where his money was going?  Yeah, right!  And I was born yesterday.</p>
<p>This should be a strong wake-up call for America!  I, for one, am tired of every minority group blaming &#8220;bad whitey&#8221; for all of their woes!  The more we&rsquo;re forced to give, the more they complain and the more &#8220;tolerance, understanding, compassion&#8221; and hand-outs they demand.  We call Obama on the outrageous sermons delivered by his pastor (A picture saves a thousand words); but yet, somehow, it&rsquo;s still our fault!  We&rsquo;re the racists; not Jeremiah White!  Up is down, and in is out, and wrong is right&hellip;  </p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t buy it; and I can only hope that most Americans with any common sense or any shred of loyalty to America or to our own race will see it for what it is!  Again, this is a horrible double standard in which, as always, we are to blame.  It&rsquo;s funny; but the reality is that we are the true victims of racism; and more and more, we are the ones being oppressed. If it&rsquo;s not the Mexicans, it&rsquo;s the Muslims.  If it&rsquo;s not the Muslims, it&rsquo;s the blacks&hellip;  We&rsquo;re being bashed from all sides on our own soil, and it&rsquo;s just not fair!</p>
<p>I believe that Obama is not &#8220;guilty by association&#8221; but guilty by affinity, and this new &#8220;revelation of information&#8221; should definitely be the end of Obama&rsquo;s crack at living in the &#8220;White&#8221; House!  </p>

I feel it is wrong to judge Obama because of Reverend Wright Mr. Obama deserves to be given the chance to prove where his true intent resides. </p>
<p>Its obvious that no matter what Obama says he will be tarred and feathered with another mans choice of words. </p>
<p>Minister Wright Was Guilty of Racist Statements Not Mr Obama. All of us need to be aware of the company we keep, All Racism and bigotry should be avoided but unfortunately that is not always possible.  </p>
<p>All of us to a certain degree are guilty of some kind of racism and bigotry whether or not we admit it; at some time we have kept silent when a friend or relative has said something that makes us cringe. </p>
<p>The pity is the people that wanted to find a reason to justify their own distrust will use this as an excuse. After all we cannot allow a true color blind candidate we must trap them in a morass of our own low opinions of others. </p>

			<p>I am relieved this is out and he is - at least for this election - not electable. An Obama presidency would be a nightmare. Every day, the America would have a reaction to what happened or what was said by him, his wife or a member of his majority-Black cabinet and appointees to various levels of government. When his anti-Amercian behavior becomes intolerable and the majority of Americans want him to resign or leave office, Blacks will react violently like we&rsquo;ve never witnessed before. This time, the National Guard - commanded by the White House - may not be summoned to quell the riots. Weeks and weeks of violence may very well develop into an all-out race war. Whites will be forced to defend their lives and property as out-of-control Blacks take and do as they please. Why not? It&rsquo;s OK with &#8220;Barry&#8221;. <br/>
I predict that Blacks will react to the outcome of this election, no matter the outcome. Time will tell. <br/>
In the meantime, keep the powder dry!</p>

			<p>Neoconned Bush paved the way for Obama with all his screwups. Its that simple. Bush has doubled the national debt and caused oil prices to rise going on 600% since 2001 not to mention his farce Iraq war and nation building that he ignorantly stays the course on to make it appear he believes what he is doing when in fact he is a fraud. Bush cares less about Muslims killing Muslims and neither should America. Bush has been neoconned and will go down as the biggest fraud and liar big spender waster destroyer of white America in world history. <br/>

			<p>Remember Trent Lott   &mdash;   hounded for a fairly innocent (racist) joke. Or those many other politicians, public figures, etc.   &mdash;   who were hounded by Blacks and the media into resigning. Well, maybe it&rsquo;s payback time. </p>
<p>We need to start screaming out about the hidden racist views of Barak Hussein Obama. That not having rebutted Preacher Wright&rsquo;s racist ravings until the story finally broke   &mdash;   Obama should drop out of the running!</p>
<p>Blacks love to ruin the careers of any  White making a racist slip. It&rsquo;s time to pay them back in their own coin, I would think!</p>
<p>Phone your local talk shows, write to the Letters to the Editor column of your local rag. That Obama never spoke out about Black on White racist crimes, about Black racial hatred for Whites   &mdash;   simply means Obama agrees with his preacher pal. Therefore Obama should drop out!</p>
<p>Like I said: Payback time for all those Whites having their careers ruined by Black racists.</p>

			<p>I see the media hacks are already falling all over themselves, trying to &#8220;whitewash&#8221; our closet racist, Obama, over that little firestorm.</p>
<p>Granted he made a decent speech. But WHY, pray tell, did he wait for a major problem to surface   &mdash;   before addressing the racial issues? Seems to me, if he disagreed with the rantings of his dear friend and pastor, J. Wright, he&rsquo;d have spoken out ages ago over that racist rhetoric. Seems to me, friend Obama is simply lying again. Sugar coated lies, of course, but definitely LYING THROUGH HIS TEETH!</p>

			<p>Hey, there are white and other liberals,who agree with everything that Obamas Pastor said. This isn&rsquo;t even an issue with so called liberal progressives  &mdash;  so clueless are they. In fact, I predict Obamas popularity among them will go up. </p>

			<p>11:57PM said: &gt;&gt;&gt;I feel it is wrong to judge Obama because of Reverend Wright Mr. Obama deserves to be given the chance to prove where his true intent resides.
Arc says:<br/>
How many chances? He&rsquo;s been asked plenty of times. Perhaps you mean give him a chance by electing him President and we can all Hope he will have Changed.</p>
<p>11:57PM said:<br/>
 &gt;&gt;&gt;Its obvious that no matter what Obama says he will be tarred and feathered with another mans choice of words<br/>
Arc says:<br/>
 And quite right too. Do you not understand that because Obama kept company with a racist bigot for 20 years, took him as his Mentor, refers to him as an Uncle figure, used excerpts of his racist rants in his book, added him to his election campaign that it kinda gives the impression that he might just have some teensy weensy feelings of comradeship and an affinity with this holy man of God? Or might Obama have poor judgment? Not what we&rsquo;re looking for in our Commander in Chief. The current one is bad enough. </p>
<p>11:57PM said:<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Minister Wright Was Guilty of Racist Statements Not Mr Obama. All of us need to be aware of the company we keep, All Racism and bigotry should be avoided but unfortunately that is not always possible.<br/>
Arc says:<br/>
 Hey right again! There is the odd racist statement made here, I don&rsquo;t like it, but they don&rsquo;t hang around for long, we like reasoned argument here not hollering slogans. If there was consistent foul language, hate speech and venom against Black people for no other reason than they were Black I wouldn&rsquo;t post here. I sure wouldn&rsquo;t stay for &hellip; 20 years&hellip;ahem. </p>
<p>11:57PM said:<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;All of us to a certain degree are guilty of some kind of racism and bigotry whether or not we admit it; at some time we have kept silent when a friend or relative has said something that makes us cringe<br/>
Arc says:<br/>
 That&rsquo;s a sweeping statement to make about all of mankind but I&rsquo;ll grant you some leeway as you may know a few billion more folks than I do; but in any case by your own admission it is &#8220;at some time we have kept silent&#8221; rather than on a continual and repeated basis for &hellip; 20 years&hellip;</p>
<p>11:57PM said:<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; The pity is the people that wanted to find a reason to justify their own distrust will use this as an excuse. After all we cannot allow a true color blind candidate we must trap them in a morass of our own low opinions of others.
Arc sighs.</p>

			<p>There are dozens of black churches in and around Chicago that Obama could have attended.  But the fact that he attended Trinity church for 20 years must mean he agrees with its general religious principles. </p>

			<p>The Obamanible Showman&rsquo;s wife also recently said that this is &#8220;the first time in her life that she is proud of the US.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go on record by saying that Geraldine Ferraro&rsquo;s recent statement that &#8220;Obama would never have been allowed into politics if he had been a white man or a woman of any color&#8221; and her subsequent refusal to grovel is the first time in my life that I have been proud of a liberal democrat.</p>

			<p>The reality is that one attends a church they agree with. A Catholic is not going to claim memebership in a Baptist church. Obamaa is no different.  He felt at ease here with the hate speech and all, otherwise he would not attend.  He talks about Wright &#8220;leading him to Christ&#8221;.  Which Christ I wonder?  The Bible says there is no Jew or Greek, slave or free in Christ.  Accoording to Black Liberation Theology, Christ has to defend and condone the overthrow of &#8220;white oppression&#8221;.  This sounds radically different from how Jesus stated things.  Obama is not a good choice for POTUS.</p>

			<p>Has it ever been reported how these sermons got out into the press?  I mean I know that people were aware of Wright and the things he was saying but somebody, somewhere saw fit to make sure that Obama was exposed for the real racist that he is.</p>
