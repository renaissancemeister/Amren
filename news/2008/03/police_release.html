						<p>CHAPEL HILL &mdash; The Chapel Hill Police Department has released a photo from an ATM machine of a man they say is a suspect in the murder of UNC student body president Eve Marie Carson.</p>
<p>The murder of the 22 year old leader on UNC&rsquo;s campus has shocked many across the state and the whole campus community has come together to mourn their loss.</p>
<p>Chapel Hill Police released two photos of the unknown suspect to the media this morning, but according to Police Chief Brian Curran during the press conference, the police had already circulated the photos to law enforcement officials by the end of the day on Friday to try and identify him.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police investigators said during the press conference they could not confirm that the man was driving Carson&rsquo;s vehicle, but it certainly looked similar.</p>
<p>Carson owned a blue 2005 Toyota Highlander SUV with a Georgia license plate number of AIV-6690.</p>
<p>A comparison of a photo of a 2005 Toyota Highlander with the second image released by police show identical color-moulded door handles, dark plastic window pillars, and roof rack details between the two vehicles:</p>
<p>The photos released by the Chapel Hill Police show a man wearing a dark blue baseball cap with a white &#8220;H&#8221; and an orange star behind the &#8220;H&#8221;. The hat appears to be a vintage Houston Astros baseball team hat similar to the one the team wore from 1980 to 1993.</p>
<p>Carson&rsquo;s body was found near campus on Hillcrest Circle on Wednesday morning and police say she was determined to have been killed by multiple gunshots, including one head wound. Her Toyota Highlander was not found by police until Thursday on nearby Hillsborough Street.  The police said today that her car had already received a parking ticket because it was in a no parking zone.</p>
<p>Police have not released a potential motive in the murder, but have already stated to the media that Carson was not sexually assaulted. Carson&rsquo;s wallet was not recovered from either crime scene.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Friday, the UNC Board of Trustees authorized a $25,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of a suspect in the murder of Carson.</p>
<p>Those with information regarding the case can call the Chapel Hill Police at 919-968-2760 or Crime Stoppers at 919-942-7515. Callers do not have to reveal their identities.</p>

			<p>How many more of our women are we going to allow these barbarians to kill and do nothing?</p>
<p>Our ancestors are rightly rolling in their graves.</p>
<p>Of course, nothing is made of these killings by the mainstream media or, for that matter, the so-called &#8220;new&#8221; media.</p>
<p>A society that does not protect its women does not deserve to survive.</p>

			<p>I have some already, but any documentation of Miss Carson&rsquo;s left-wing political activity would be much appreciated.  I&rsquo;m going to add her and Miss Burk (/news/2008/03/auburn_police_o.php) to the St. Louis CofCC regular webpage&rsquo;s list of Poetic Justice cases:</p>
<p>http://archimedes.galilei.com/stlcofcc/poetic-justice.html</p>
<p>I do have documentation that Miss Carson could have gone to an ivy league school, but she chose UNC explicitly for racial diversity in its student body.</p>

			<p>Can the Raleigh Chronicle and Richard Saunders not bear to say in their story that the perp appeared to have been BLACK?</p>
<p>I suppose that everyone in the Chapel Hill area will thus be out looking for a blonde-haired, rosy-cheeked lad whose last name might be Dombrowski, Westenheimer, or Swensen.  </p>

			<p>The suspect is probably a Katrina refugee who ended up in Chapel Hill but way of Houston.  One thing I do give blacks credit for is their insatiable appetite for violence.<br>

			<p>Since the stories of these two girls being murdered broke, I have been in an almost constant state of inner-rage.  I knew from the start that this was the work of violent black animals.  The thought that someone like this girl, Student President of UNC, beautiful and smart, going to be ultra-successful in her life, being thrown into the void by this inhuman detritus is just so demoralizing.  Our universities are becoming hunting grounds for black criminals that prey upon students. Serious crimes such as this one, the murdering of two Indian Phd. students at LSU and countless others are covered up, while made up crimes, i.e. Duke rape case are shown non stop for months.  Something must change. </p>

			<p>This senseless killing, and others like it, is such a tragedy. Sadly, this sort of thing occurs more often than we realize all across the country. The perpetrators are heartless monsters who must be erased from our society. Eve was such an intelligent and generous soul. She would have contributed greatly to this sorry world.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m glad that this horrific crime is getting significant national media attention.  Unfortunately, too many crimes like this occur on a very regular basis without the national (or even local) media batting an eyelid.  In this case, the victim was a well-known student government leader and, at the time of initial reporting, the race of the culprit was unknown (although suspected, correctly, by many).  For every publicized story like this, there are so many other murders / assaults of whites by blacks that never get reported because the victim wasn&rsquo;t in the public eye and the culprit was known to be black (and hence the story is swept under the rug).</p>

			<p>It is quite evident that these black predators are targeting our white daughters.These crimes are increasing against our children.There is a time and a season for being responsible and a time to take action.The time for action is now.The time to stand up is now.What type of people are we if we can&rsquo;t protect our most vulnerable.These wolves hunt in packs when they want to attack our mighty.They have no courage.These low lifes prey on women because they are a easy mark and because they are not man enough to stand up to white men.How long white men are you going to remain silent. These crimes should be shouted to the mountain tops.They should be shouted through the halls of Congress.We should not stop til we have sent a message that we as a people are not going to take this any more .This is a new day and season.</p>

			<p>Already the &#8220;progressive&#8221; White folks are saying they&rsquo;re &#8220;afraid&#8221; people will make this a - - - [drumbeat please] racial issue!!!! And I&rsquo;ll bet that had 2 White guys murdered two black girls with-in a week, these same White cowards would have no problem making it a &#8220;racial issue.&#8221; And as the cowardly Whites hold &#8220;candle light&#8221; memorials, blacks would be looting and burning the place down!!!! I think the reason these White folks are called &#8220;progressive&#8221; is that they&rsquo;re progressively slipping into mental illness!!!</p>

			<p>I send my condolences to the friends and family of this murdered young White woman. <br>
Eve Carson was very beautiful. She was also a complete, brainwashed idiot, diversity, multi cult model. Check out the picture of this airhead waving the Communist Cuban flag on some multi cultural trip to bond with the Third World People of Color. Check out her Diversity campaign platform when she ran for and won student body president.</p>
<p>No White woman deserves to be raped and or murdered. But, just understand that Eve Carson was going down a terrible path, one that is leading our people to hell.</p>
<p>If she didn&rsquo;t die here or have some extreme experience to make her change her anti White ways, she would have ended up the trophy wife for some Black African United Nations Secretary General - some Black Conservative Governor of a New South State.</p>
<p>No white woman deserves to be raped or murdered. It would have been ok, healthy for her and our people for her to have been mugged by racial reality. It could have changed her, changed her life, saved her life, saved our race.</p>
<p>No pain, no gain. Pain is healthy, it&rsquo;s a warning system telling the body that something is wrong, and something needs to be changed.</p>
<p>White American are experiencing pain now. Pain can be a good thing.</p>

			<p>   The FBI is not worried about white victims . They want to find some eighty year old white guy from the South that they paid another eighty year old white 20 to 30 thousand bucks to testify against ( like he can actually be believed ) and try him for the tenth time then throw away the key to the jail to placate the so-called minorities and the liberals . It also allows them to juggle the stats to prove that whites are the ones committing all of the crime. And while we are on the subject, someones&rsquo; head should have rolled in the FBI and the CIA over 9-11 but it didn&rsquo;t ?</p>

			<p>While a tragedy, and I am greatly angered and thirsting for revenge, at least half of the problem with this type of thing is the attitudes of white women themselves towards blacks. They simply cannot bring themselves to believe that these animals are just that, animals. O.J. Simpson cuts his ex-wifes head off and still he can have the pick of any gorgeous white woman he wants. White women flock to support Barak Obama. They will not listen to their male counter parts, considering us &#8216;racists&rsquo; if we protest too much and point out the obvious. I am not saying, of course, that this applies in every case, but it is not often that a white woman will side with a white man on racial issues. White women need to change their attitudes about blacks, and non-whites in general.</p>

<p>Her profile page for student body president mentions that she did a study abroad semester in Havana, as in Havana, Cuba, in 2006 (would be interesting to learn how such a study abroad is possible with the travel ban).  Strong circumstantial evidence that she may have had far left-wing activism as a motivating force in her life, I should think.</p>
<p>It also mentions membership in &#8220;Nourish International,&#8221; which looks to be a garden variety anti-poverty organization.</p>
<p>Finally, membership in something called &#8220;UNITAS Diversity Theme Housing,&#8221; an organization which &#8220;actively works to erase stereotypes and prejudice based on gender, race,<br>
nationality, religion and sexual orientation. In order to break down cultural barriers, all residents are assigned roommates based on their cultural and/or racial differences rather than their similarities&#8221; (see link below).</p>

			<p>In a TWO DAY period of time, TWO young pretty white female university students in the South are murdered by black males. (Just the tip of the iceberg, since the vast majority of such daily black on white atrocities you never hear about.) At Auburn University in Georgia, a white female student, Lauren Burk, is kidnapped, robbed, sexually assaulted (attempted rape), and shot dead by a black male (Courtney Larrell Lockhart). At UNC Chapel Hill North Carolina, a white female student, Eve Marie Carson, is robbed and shot dead by two black males.</p>
<p>Now if it is OK for blacks to ALWAYS make a racial issue out of any extremely RARE (by comparison) white on black incident, such as Bill Cosby&rsquo;s racist wife did, given a forum by USA Today, when a Ukrainian immigrant killed her son who was driving an expensive vehicle during a robbery/carjacking, and such as was done by blacks/leftists during the Durham hoax, and was done by blacks in a West Virginia case of domestic abuse of a white man&rsquo;s live-in black companion, and such as was done recently when two white female teachers were caught having sex with black male high-school students,&hellip; then we are all the MORE justified to make a MAJOR RACIAL ISSUE out of the RAMPANT black on white atrocities occurring on a daily basis in communities all across the country.</p>
<p>You wonder what part these universities had, given the intense indoctrination given white students that if they trust their instincts regarding blacks then they are &ldquo;racist&rdquo; and must feel intense guilt for that and must resist the urge to exercise caution (because that urge is &ldquo;baseless&rdquo; and is just an example of whites&rsquo; innate &ldquo;racism&rdquo; and &ldquo;prejudice&rdquo; against innocent blacks). Did these two white girls absorb this lesson in white guilt and black &ldquo;victimization&rdquo; and thus did not use better judgment, let down their guard so as not to appear &ldquo;racist&rdquo; and  thus  &ldquo;victimize&rdquo; these black males they encountered? Whereas if upon first sight of these loitering black males they had immediately turned around and RAN to safety they might be alive today.<br>
And what part have these universities, permeated with hate-whitey propaganda (&ldquo;white racism&rdquo;, &ldquo;white oppression&rdquo;, &ldquo;white skin privilege&rdquo;&hellip;.), played in helping create the environment that encourages black racist thugs to target white victims, feeling racially entitled to do so, their white victims dehumanized as &ldquo;racist oppressors&rdquo; they can feel justified to rob, rape, and murder at will?<br>
Oh you&rsquo;ll hear that &ldquo;robbery&rdquo; was the motive. Well, that might have been the motive for the robbery, the LEAST of the crimes committed, but what was the motive for the gratuitous MURDER? Certainly these petite little white girls were not keeping those black male thugs from escaping. And what is the motive for these black thugs to go out of their way to specifically seek white victims in white communities? It does not matter WHY they are targeting whites for robbery (because they think whites have more money, because they think whites are &ldquo;soft&rdquo; targets, because they hate whites, or because of some combination of this), if they are specifically racially targeting whites then it is STILL a racially motivated HATE crime. (By the legal definition of a &ldquo;hate crime&rdquo;. If some whites were specifically targeting blacks because they thought blacks carry more cash or &ldquo;bling&rdquo;, you can BET the NAACP would be DEMANDING hate crime charges.) And you would be very naïve indeed to think there is not racial animus in black criminals&rsquo; targeting of whites. All the more indicated when gratuitous violence and murder is added, which clearly shows that the black perpetrators do not consider that white lives have any value. Why should they? They had drummed into their heads from childhood to view all whites as their evil racist oppressors who are to blame for anything and everything. Black hatred/resentment of whites is almost uniform, and is ratcheted up orders of magnitude among the black criminal class in particular. White victims (who survive) of black crime regularly report racial slurs/comments having been directed against them. Black criminals are quite open about specifically targeting whites for racial reasons.<br>

			<p>&#8220;These crimes should be shouted to the mountain tops.They should be shouted through the halls of Congress.We should not stop til we have sent a message that we as a people are not going to take this any more. This is a new day and season.&#8221; <br>
THE MAN has it right. I appreciate his sentiments, but it&rsquo;s the movie Groundhog Day until decent people gain the courage to voice their disgust publicly - the &#8220;R&#8221; word be-damned. We are all indebted to Jared and the (shamefully) few other high profile spokespersons who argue for sense and civility, but where are the other outraged wealthy white conservatives. This epidemic of violence will never be stopped until we lobby and publicise and educate the masses. This can only be accomplished my a public ( marches and rally&rsquo;s) show of support for families traumatized by these sensless, brutal events, and by using the  broadcast media and producing our own true documentaries and TV.<br>
The popular media bears a major responsibility for brainwashing the masses into believing that everyone is equally thoughtful and good. Those of us who can articulate our position in a reasonable manner should be given the opportunity to spread the word - beyond this wonderful website. That can only be accomplished with money. It&rsquo;s time for decent conservatives to start financing an offensive.<br>

			<p>I have some already, but any documentation of Miss Carson&rsquo;s left-wing political activity would be much appreciated. I&rsquo;m going to add her and Miss Burk (/news/2008/03/auburn_police_o.php) to the St. Louis CofCC regular webpage&rsquo;s list of Poetic Justice cases:</p>
<p>http://archimedes.galilei.com/stlcofcc/poetic-justice.html</p>
<p>I do have documentation that Miss Carson could have gone to an ivy league school, but she chose UNC explicitly for racial diversity in its student body.</p>

<p>I want to know how this guy got this thng posted.<br>
To imply that these two girls deserved what they got and to refer to it as &#8220;poetic justice&#8221; is hideously cruel. <br>
These kids were the products of our educational system that taught them to be tolerant and propagandized them to the point where they saw no danger. Would the &#8220;Blogmeister&#8221; feel this way if a loved one of HIS fell victim (God forbid) to one of these mutant bacteria? Such Schadenfreude is egregious. <br>
The fact that the parents want to send the money to help the eternally starving kids in Africa is evidence of the kind of upbringing the the girl had. White America has lost its sense of anger and I blame Christianity with its &#8220;turn the other cheek&#8221; mentality. I think we&rsquo;re slowly running out of cheeks to turn and if things don&rsquo;t change soon the only thing turned will be the barrels of rifles in the direction of the infection.</p>

<p>The only thing with which I disagree is the &#8220;Halls of Congress&#8221; part. These people don&rsquo;t represent us.  This genocide has been going on for decades and nothing has been nor ever WILL be done to stop it. The courts have castrated law enforcement to the point that they can only react. We need to take organized action against our enemy who has made it perfectly clear that he means to annihilate us.</p>
<p>We need to declare &#8220;Never Again&#8221; as did Menachem Begin when referring to the Holocaust. We need to focus on our Whiteness and what we need to do to defeat this enemy who has been waging an organized war against us for decades.<br>

Its becoming so pathetically obvious that these so called progressive enlightened ones are essentially racial sado masochists and it woudn&rsquo;t suprise me if they secretly fantasized with pleasure of being cannibilized by these dark people they&rsquo;ve come to worship.</p>

			<p>There is a breaking story out of Oklahoma City tonight that there may be yet another black serial rapist on the loose.  I have noticed an increasing and disturbing trend in this country over the past several months in the number of black on white crimes (as if it was not disurbing already). I attribute this increase with the corresponding rise of Obama.  </p>
<p>People, if you think black violence against us is bad now, wait until Afro-centric Obama is President and the blacks REALLY feel the power to get back at Whitey.  Or worse, wait until Obama loses the Democratic primary race and the blacks violently cry out that they have been cheated by Whitey.  You havn&rsquo;t seen anything yet!  We are damned if we do or don&rsquo;t.  </p>
<p>However, maybe this upcoming, unpleasant situation is what is needed to awaken our brainwashed, liberal White kinfolk by forcing racial reality upon them.</p>

			<p>I know a woman who was killed in NC last November. Her name was Lori Beaudry, and she was a math tutor and Phi Theta Kappa advisor at my school. She was one of the nicest, most patient people I ever knew, and then she was killed while on a leave of absence. Her case finally got a break, and now the police have someone in custody; I shouldn&rsquo;t need to give a racial description, as I knew what it would be right from the start.<br>

			<p>Miss Carson did, indeed, spend time in Cuba and various Latin American countries as a student. And she was head of the student body. Only students who toe the party line would ever have a prayer of rising to that level in student government. Her naivite and the constant reinforcement of that naivite in the college environment appears to have cost her her life. Praising multiculturalism and diversity will get you a lot of pats on the head at college, but it will not stop a bullet from piercing your skull. Young, white college women beware: black men target you because you are naive and physically weak. The only thing unique about this case is that she was not raped first.</p>
<p>And two unrelated cases of random murders of white college women by black male criminals within one day. Sorry, leftists, that is a racial issue. </p>

			<p>The staple of every bit of second-rate American fiction for years has been the archetype of a gentle giant of a poor abused ill-treated black being symbollically crucified (with a very obtuse and direct inference to Christ)by evil, nasty &#8216;white-trash&rsquo; &#8216;red-necks&rsquo;.<br>
This guff was peddled in &#8216;To Kill a Mocking Bird&rsquo; and the execrable garbage of the &#8216;Green Mile&rsquo;, for example.<br>
  The fact is the converse, where a black actually has committed the murder he is accussed of, is much closer to reality.</p>

			<p>According to Fox News, the cops can see another man in the back seat of the car. I think all 3 of these men, if you can call them men, need to be executed in the same way they killed the woman in public view and tv.<br>
Although I think that many blacks try to be fine people, the bad ones pull the good ones down down into the disrespect of all people. It is time that law enforcement gets tough with people who kill, rob and rape. By getting tough, I mean that the judges need to turn a deaf ear to groups like the ACLU,SPLC and people that whine that the death penalty is to tough and does not reduce crime. I beg to disagree because even in prison these people will continue to rape and rob the weaker men they are incarcerated with. <br>
We are letting liberals, and immigrant&rsquo;s rights groups lead us down a path of no return and unless we get real men in office that are willing to pull the switch when needed and deport people that do not belong here and stop letting ignorant 3 world people into our Great United States of America we are doomed as a people of great culture and pride and destined to be a Country lacking law and order,and see much more poverty and homelessness. <br>
I think we are at the portion of the road were there is a high road and a low road. We must force our Government to take the high road because if we take the low road, as another poster says, God help us &hellip;I wont say all of us, because all of us do not need help from God, they need help from the man that pulls the switch that snuffs out their life and makes the Country one person less we have to fear.  </p>

<p>So Mr Pitts,<br>
 <br>
2 dead white southern college girls, (at least) 2 black male perps sought or in custody. Chalk in another black perp at Mississippi State and what do we have? How many is that in the past year,I wonder? More than all the poor &#8220;innocents&#8221; lynched in a hundred years, I&rsquo;ll bet. I mean whats is going on that black men think they can just go out and murder innocent college co-eds? Shouldt they stick to killing each other? what dey teachin&rsquo; them boyz?  Think its the Confedarate flag&rsquo;s fault? reparations? legacy of slavery? George Bush? poverty? I mean, arent these the usual canards that folks like you use to rationalize and excuse away all the misdeeds of black folk? It couldnt be the immorality, lack of values and common decency these folks have, coupled with the excuse making of agenda-driven apologists like you, could it?  What do you have to say? Arent you interested that our independent and objective media havent even mentioned the race of the perps? Imagine if the situation were reversed.  Where are &#8220;your&#8221; leaders, Je$$ie and Rev Al to condemn these hate crimes? I know, I know, cry you a river, right? Just a few less white devils to expolit you.  Of course, next time, you should tell the bruthas to choose better targets. I mean, the law of averages would suggest that Lauren Burk being Jewish, and Eve Carson having studied in Cuba, were probably sympathetic to your folk, if not completely down for the struggle. Why, I&rsquo;d bet their cars, since stolen by your kinsmen, even had Obama stickers on them.  You must be proud of the great accomplishmetts of your people, Leonard.  From Kenya to the Congo, Zimbabwe to South Africa, from Detroit to Baltimore to New Orleans and on and on. From schools to sports to shopping centers to government to neighborhoods to the courts.. They destroy everything they touch. They cant be trusted at any level of justice. Corrupt from police to jury to lawyers to judges. Show me one accomplishment and I&rsquo;ll show you a hundred failures. Such a failed race yours is, and in need of permanent custodial care. Truly the White Man&rsquo;s Burden&hellip;..<br>
 <br>
Now go off and write another &#8220;symbolism over substance&#8221; puff piece about how its all Whitey&rsquo;s fault.</p>

			<p>The co-ed from North Carolina had gone on trips to Africa to help the children there. Isn&rsquo;t it ironic that a black ends up savagely murdering her?</p>
<p>In all honesty does this murder shock anyone on this comment board? Black on White murder is so common how can anyone be shocked? The horrific details of the case will eventually come out and we will read them and get mad, but this is pointless. We need to ask ourselves these questions: Why is this stuff going on? Who did this to us? Who or what destroyed our 90% White Nation? During segregation these types of murders rarely happened because blacks knew they would be punished. How can America change so quickly? In fact, I would like to see black on White murder stats from the 1950&rsquo;s and compare them with today&rsquo;s black on White murder stats. Does anyone know where I could find these?</p>

<p>What about Amy Biehl?</p>
<p>&#8220;The movie presented that the story of Amy Biehl had been told in order to become as a symbolic hope of South African community and internationally as well. A beautiful young American student died inside of South African village while she was against of unjust through innocent South African people. One day, she met with a mob group who were chanting anti-whites slogans and Mr. Mongezi Manqina was among a convicted killer. He stated in front of Amnesty Hearing that &ldquo;I stabbed Amy Biehl because I saw her as a target&hellip; &rdquo; (film). He killed her as a target because his view in the film was this world had turned back from us as a South African Black community, and thousands of our people died every single day. On the other seen he said that &ldquo;I chased after her and I tripped her and she fell down&hellip; I asked one of the persons in the crowd for a knife&hellip;&rdquo; (Film LNJID). Those unhealthy words came from his mouth while he was telling the story of how he killed her. &#8220;</p>

			<p>To be clear, by listing this girl&rsquo;s political activities I was not agreeing that she somehow &#8220;got what was coming to her.&#8221;  A murder like this is a tragedy, no doubt about it.  However, it is not heartless to examine whether her political beliefs may have contributed in some way to her death - not directly, but through misplaced trust, naive behavior, etc.  And this inquiry has implications for her education and upbringing as well, as another poster noted.  If questions like these cannot be asked, why is this story posted on Amren to begin with?  </p>
<p>That said, this may simply be a completely senseless and random murder, which no amount of vigilance could have prevented.  And since a substantial percentage of college-age women are far left-wing to begin with, the fact that Carson was a leftist activist type may be no more than a coincidence.</p>

			<p>The key to turning the tide is in the legal system. If I ran a business giving seminars on how rattlesnakes make great pets for snuggling and the people who came to my seminars get bitten, what are the chances I would be sued? 100%. </p>
<p>There should be investigators going through the curricula of every class these girls have taken all the way back to kindergarten. If there is anything remotely suggesting that their personal safety should take a back seat to potentially hurting the feelings of an individual of a given group, the institution and the developers of such curricula should be sued back into the stone age. </p>
<p>And there should be an equally thorough investigation of the background of the killers (probably only encompassing Head Start to third grade, where their eduction tops out) to see if they were taught skewed or inflammatory things about whites that would justify, in their low IQ minds, a violent animus against whites. If so those instutions and curricula developers should be sued back into the stone age. There is, at a minimum, indirect liability in the education system for murders such as these. Depending on the content of diversity and anti-stereotyping sessions, there could be direct liability. Too bad I&rsquo;m not an attorney.</p>

<p>What a despicable thing to say about this girl who was BARELY a woman.  Plenty of posters on this sight have remarked how they recovered from the multi culti brainwashing they suffered in their youth.  This girl never got the chance.  She certainly didn&rsquo;t deserve to die.</p>
<p>Place blame where it belongs-squarely on the shoulders of the black criminal that did this horrid crime.  Parents need to teach their children (and any other white that will listen) about the dangers of blacks.</p>

			<p>It appears that another of our best and brightest has been wantonly slaughtered by an African-American ghetto dweller. But something about the whole thing has me speculating about what is what. I understand this girl had a full-time job, went to school full time, was student body president, must have had some type of social life, and may have had other interests. While it may be possible, it seems like it would take an incredible amount of energy to maintain such a schedule. It makes me curious to know if the girl was actually involved in a drug deal to score some meth. Maybe she owed money or refused to pay for the drugs with a method other than cash.<br>
 <br>
Of course this would in no way justify her murder. I feel bad that so many of our young white people have had their defense mechanisms deactivated but this raises a concern of mine. If the girl was doing a drug deal, she chose an upscale neighborhood to conduct her transaction. This would mean that she brought dangerous black folk into an otherwise unsuspecting neighborhood. Makes me wonder what type of humans the neighbors&rsquo; children are bringing home.   <br>

			<p>I live in the area of the murder and this case has been the lead story on every TV and radio newscast all weekend long and was above the fold on the front page of the News and Observer on Saturday, Sunday and Monday. I have been wanting to hear the thoughts of other conservatives in this area who are outraged by this brutal crime but there is not a local conservative talk show during the weekend on the dominant local AM station, WPTF. The local conservative call-in show airs only on weekdays.  It&rsquo;s hosted by Bill Lumaye and it comes on after Rush Limbaugh at 3:06 PM, so I had to wait.  I was impatient because I yearned to hear some anger - a lot of anger - in the voices of the white people who would (I hoped) call in to say they had had enough of these hate-driven black predators whose highest goal in life seems to be the killing of white women. I suspected the management of the station would be concerned that the comments of callers angered by this outrageous killing might be hard to control and might burst the tight PC bounds of the station.  I assumed the management would share their concerns with Lumaye and with the host of the morning show about what might be expected from callers and how to keep things from getting out of hand.  I was not prepared, however, for what Lumaye did on Monday - he simply pretended this sensational, ghastly crime was not worth talking about.  Eve Carson&rsquo;s murder was not mentioned once during the entire show.  The first hour&rsquo;s discussion was about the problem of gays openly having sex in a local park, the second hour was about people who were having trouble making payments on their home loans and the third hour was about Raleigh&rsquo;s water shortage problems.  Unbelievable.  </p>
<p>Today this pathetic, spineless host took calls for the first two hours on governor Spitzer and his problems with high priced whores.  Now in the third hour he wants to talk about the evil Hillary Clinton and our water shortage (again) and the evil Democrats and anything at all except the top story of the day, the murder of the remarkable Eve Carson by a worthless black monster.</p>
<p>The media, internet excluded, is in the hands of our enemies.</p>

			<p>And if anyone&rsquo;s to blame for her death, it&rsquo;s white males.</p>
<p>White males: turned blacks loose in America, when they should&rsquo;ve been returned to Africa; legislated the further racial destruction of America, starting in 1965 with the Hart-Celler act; handed the keys to the city over to our enemies, beginning with the Civil War, then WWI, then desegregation; the &#8220;greatest generation&#8221; laid down for a nap while the country went straight to hell.  I can ramble like this for hours.</p>
<p>We gave women the vote, too, when it should&rsquo;ve been plain that women are even more politically retarded than men, and no good could come of it.</p>
<p>Actually, this is all best laid at the doorstep of the white political classes.  They&rsquo;ve been screwing us for centuries now.  Not a new story, but it&rsquo;s high time we rewrote the ending I think.</p>

			<p>Some people have mentioned liberalism, multi-culturalism and Christianity in the posts. Liberal multiculturalists are usually not the Christians they appear to be. They usually help people who least deserve help and don&rsquo;t help those who are worthy of it. That&rsquo;s because they never make moral judgments about anything. There is no right or wrong; you can do anything you want to do. They are in denial about sin, the condition of man and the need for conversion and repentance. Although they follow Christ&rsquo;s command to not judge people (not acts), they conveniently always leave out the sentence after it: &#8220;Go and sin no more.&#8221; They have no sense of reality and are blind to human nature. They have no sense of God. They hate capitalism and democracy (unless their candidate wins - then it&rsquo;s OK). They are usually socialists, who believe in the redistribution of wealth and the primacy of man, not God. Thus, they are guilty of the greatest sin: pride. They believe in abortion, homosexuality, gay marriage, adultery, giving drivers&rsquo; licenses to people who broke America&rsquo;s laws and are here illegally (sound familiar,Eliot?). Basically, they believe in everything that is bad. They probably think Al-Qaeda is misunderstood and oppressed in some way (certainly not evil because there is no such thing). But they have convinced themselves that they are good because they are &#8220;open-minded&#8221; and &#8220;non-judgmental&#8221; and help people who hold the same distorted beliefs.    </p>

<p>There is actually a chance that something like this could happen to someone I&rsquo;m related to.  I have a first cousin once removed, in her 20s, that not only goes with black men, but does everything else with them, and has had a baby by a black man.  </p>
<p>Of course, that&rsquo;s a side of the family I don&rsquo;t much care for, even without the interracial perfidy.  Perhaps I had good tastes all along.  Her maternal grandfather, my blood uncle, has disowned her.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting theory. It does seem odd that they would cross paths in the middle of the night in an upscale neighborhood. The fact that she wasn&rsquo;t raped also seems odd for an incident of this type, but that would fit with the drug deal theory.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s not just the Black thug who is responsible for the murder of this young woman. It&rsquo;s every Leftist, Progressive, Marxist Multicult-loving person, especially teachers, who were responsible for instilling their poison into this woman throughout her childhood.  The fallacy drummed into this woman was that she should not run from Black men who dress like thugs, but recognise their humanity as being &#8216;just like ours&rsquo;, embrace their differences, welcome their cultural style, in other words tolerate alien and hostile lifestyles to the detriment of your own safety.  She probably WOULD have run if approached by a man of another race who dressed like a thug. <br>
I hold these Leftists and their indoctrination responsible, and not just for her, but for every person who has been murdered, raped and assaulted since we were forced to accept uncivilised Blacks living amongst us. <br>

<p>I might buy that if she had been out in a black ghetto at the time of the crime, but she was killed in her own white neigbhorhood. It was still dark out, however, and very few people were outside at the time. Her Black killers found themselves a perfect vulnerable target. I do feel sorry for her, and very sorry for her family. To dismiss this crime as some sort of karma, is excusing what these lowlifes have done. </p>

<p>I agree she was liberal and a &#8216;diversity loving gal&rsquo;, but I don&rsquo;t know of many girls at her age that could have the same view you now have at your age. </p>
<p>Maybe things always came to her too easily through family money, intellectual segregation, etc. (I&rsquo;m betting both.) Maybe her father should have taught her more about the real world. (My father taught me not to trust anyone and not to depend on anyone. If you want anything done, you do it for yourself. He was a little extreme. I was better prepared than most, unexpected in society. But things still happen.) I don&rsquo;t know. </p>
<p>But where I come from, my white parents, we don&rsquo;t &#8216;trample on one&rsquo;s grave&rsquo;, no matter how much you dislike a person or how much one &#8216;deserved&rsquo; it. Give it some time, at least. Report the story in the present. Smear her name in the past, if need be.  <br>
(It&rsquo;s hard to separate an individual from their culture. I consider culture more than genes. I studied anthropological and religious subjects in the girls&rsquo; hometown of Athens.)</p>
<p>&#8216;Where I Come From&rsquo;, my and Alan Jackson&rsquo;s home town, traffic still stops when there are funerals. There are still tons of decent white people in public schools. Thankfully, we don&rsquo;t have compilations like yours in our town. I can get information elsewhere. (I am not unaware of the worldwide corruption and decline. I understand human nature.) </p>

<p>Far from being a unique &#8220;incident&#8221;, we literally have packs of predatory animals roaming our communities all across the nation.  If they were rabid dogs, people would not hesitate to put them down, without a thought as to whether the poor animals deserved it; or more likely while pitying the poor beasts for not deserving their miserable fate.</p>
<p>However, those predators recognized as human (at least in legal terms) not only need to be removed from our society, but also richly deserve to be put down like the rabid dogs they emulate.</p>

<p>Yes, I have to agree.  I&rsquo;ve posted on these university boards, and I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times young women like this one has sarcastically referred to me as a Nazi for just reporting the truth.</p>
<p>Yes, she was duped and propagandized into her belief system, but so were the communists, but that didn&rsquo;t make them any less offensive and dangerous.</p>
<p>Any lib that is maimed or beaten  has to realize that he/she is responsible for fighting anyone and everyone who wants to put an end to that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Sorry, but she certainly did reap what she sowed.  Remember it is these types who are screaming hysterically whenever somebody conservative speaks on their campus.  They asked for it; they got it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just glad the victim wasn&rsquo;t a conservative woman who stands with the white community.</p>

			<p>folks, this will continue as long as we allow our universitys to teach this stuff. i read every nite us all complaining about this and nothing is ever done. i will make a few suggestions. first bring lawsuits against all universities that teach white hatred, ei black studies, investigate the curricilum of every one of them and start bringing racist lawsuits against them. secong when these crimes occur, travel enmass to the county that it happened and put preassure on the district attorney to have  this declared a hate crime.start a mass literature campaign in the area to let people know that we are not going to take it any longer. all the white organizations gather up and have mass demonstrations. take the fight to the streets, and here is why, ask yourself if not this crime, then what more horrible crime can you think of for this action, the rape and murder of our white women is as bad as it gets. <br>

<p>While your opinion that Eve Carson got what she deserved, is kinda harsh; I&rsquo;m not surprised that it happened to a liberal white girl. It&rsquo;s Amy Biehl all over again. Maybe Carson thought Cuba was some kind of racial &#8220;Utopia&#8221; with Caucasian Hispanics and &#8220;Negrito Cubanos&#8221; living and working side-by-side. I don&rsquo;t know why she thought her Cuban experience would be the same at North Carolina. The more I think about it, colleges are nothing more than indoctrination centers.</p>
