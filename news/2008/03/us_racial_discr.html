<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>On Friday, March 7, in Geneva, Switzerland, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination issued its Concluding Observations charging the U.S. to do more to remedy the effects of racial discrimination in housing and other areas.</p>
<p>The Observations came after the formal review of the U.S.&rsquo;s report to the Committee under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. This is a required procedure for all signatories to the treaty, which the U.S. ratified in 1994.</p>
<p>During the oral review, Committee member Dilip Lahiri of India recalled, &#8220;When I was in Chicago, a journalist who visited then-apartheid South Africa came back and said, &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t need the South African laws to achieve the [same] segregation, the discrimination in the United States.&rsquo; Residential segregation .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is a persistent factor and while programs have been undertaken, it is obvious that there is a problem and some sort of a vigorous proactive action needs to be taken to show some progress on the ground.&#8221;</p>
<p>As an example of &#8220;proactive action&#8221; the Committee cited the California Housing Element Law, which requires cities and counties to plan affordable housing for all income levels of society, rather than just building luxury condos and McMansions. A recent amendment to the law requires counties to provide at least one zoning jurisdiction where homeless shelters can be located by right, ensuring that &#8220;Not-In-My-Back-Yard&#8221; opposition does not prevent these most critical housing needs from being met.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Committee&rsquo;s Observations echo the comments of another treaty review body, the Human Rights Commission, which in 2006 reviewed the U.S. for compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which the U.S. ratified in 1992. That committee noted its concern that while African Americans constitute just 12% of the population, they represent 50 percent of homeless people, and the government is required to take &#8220;adequate and adequately implemented&#8221; measures to remedy this human rights violation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Committee also criticized the discriminatory violations of housing rights of African Americans following Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. This comes on the heels of a call from two UN experts on housing and minority rights two weeks ago for an immediate halt to the demolitions of public housing in New Orleans. These demolitions, along with other reconstruction policies, are preventing African Americans from returning to the city. The Committee calls for adequate, affordable housing in Katrina-affected areas, and also for the remedying of housing conditions in racially segregated areas across the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;The current situation points to a fundamental lack of respect for the rights and needs of poor and minority Americans,&#8221; said Eric Tars, Human Rights Staff Attorney at NLCHP, who participated in briefings with the Committee and the U.S. government delegation. &#8220;We are pushing for a new vision, grounded in the American belief of equal opportunity, that guarantees us all our basic human rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By signing this treaty, the U.S. committed to overcoming the history of discrimination in this country,&#8221; Tars continued. &#8220;But rather than adequately funding housing programs which are proven to get people off the streets and back into productive society, cities, states, and the federal government all continue to try to sweep the problem under the rug. Today, the Committee gave us some clear steps we need to take to do a better job, and we intend to hold the government accountable for its obligations.&#8221;</p>

			<p>If this is a call to end affirmative action&hellip; A call to end all race and gender based programs, the elimination of all of laws that provide preferential treatment based on race or gender, then I am all for it. Of course, the black and hispanic caucuses in our congress will have to be eliminated. No more government funds for LaRaza, the ACLU, or a thousand other groups holding their hands out. Sounds good.</p>
<p>But if this just another attempt to subvert the sovereignty of my country while picking my pocket, no deal.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t take anything the UN says seriously. This is a group that was formed on the basis of a watchdog organization to monitor and hold accountable all nations. It has bcome a mafia style status club. Just to note, two of the representatives on the council that is supposed to investigate claims of human rights violations (more like atrocities!) are two of the worst dictators and are responsible for the killing of many of their own citizens themselves! What hypocrites! But the UN is always the first hand stretched out to take money from the US for any large problem that the other countries won&rsquo;t foot the bill for. Don&rsquo;t even get me started on the Food for Oil Program! Let the UN advise Africa to accept the US citizens/victims of Hurrican Katrina that feel their rights are violated in some way. And Obama has promised to sign that stupid agreement which could result in US citizens losing their right to bear arms. Someone please back me up on this- I am sure I am missing some of the specifics.</p>

			<p>A good reason why the US needs to get out of the UN: their dictating to us what we are doing wrong and trying to run our internal affairs. It is not the responsibility of the US government to take care of the homeless problem, among others. And to put the icing on the cake, you never hear the UN as wound up about the oppressive governments of Iran, Saudi Arabia etc, with their blatant human rights violations.</p>

			<p>Will somebody please tell the U.N. to &#8220;talk to the hand?&#8221; I don&rsquo;t recall voting to give them the right to run MY country! And why are&rsquo;nt they concerned about the lack of affordable housing in AFRICA??? Probably 80% of the people on earth live in poverty, and they focus on US???? It is WAAAAY past time to kick the U.N. out of this country, tear up these damn &#8220;treaties&#8221; we&rsquo;ve signed with them and look them in the eye and say &#8220;and what are you gonna do?&#8221; I mean,really, what COULD they do to us? They are a paper tiger and need to be shown as such!</p>

			<p>Why don&rsquo;t we just move the U.N. building to Switzerland so we don&rsquo;t have to deal with these village idiots anymore? Speaking of racism, why doesn&rsquo;t the U.N. address the genocidal killing of boer farmers in South Africa, along with the just as genocidal killing of white farmers in Zimbabwe? Why doesn&rsquo;t the U.N. address the South African &#8216;governments&rsquo; policy of totally excluding boer whites from ANY type of employment, literally starving these white families to death? Another genocidal move by that black &#8220;government&rsquo;. When has the U.N. ever stood up against oppression of whites anywhere? The answer is NEVER!!! The U.N. has always been against white interests and the white race, taking potshots and giving broadsides as often as possible. They are a ridiculous, outdated, useless, ignorant forum that plays no part in the white world except to censor us. The U.N. needs to change or the U.S. needs to leave that pathetic institution.</p>

			<p>Boca Raton (&#8220;Mouse Mouth&#8221;) is only 3.8% black. But 90 percent of those lined up for the government &ldquo;housing voucher&rdquo; hand-outs were black. So once again you see the government carrying out ethnic displacement/cleansing of yet another non-black (=safe) community by flooding it with blacks who did not have to work for the homes they will be given, unlike the present residents who had to WORK, EARN and SACRIFICE in order to buy a home and live there. To add insult to injury, the government uses the tax-dollars of those working present residents to subsidize the destruction of their own neighborhood, putting them and their loved one&rsquo;s lives in grave danger in the process. As a representative cross-section of blacks flood in the crime and violence, often racial in nature, will drive the non-blacks out, who will loose their life savings they tied up in their homes they sacrificed for in order to have a safe place for themselves and their family.</p>

			<p>I really don&rsquo;t like the UN getting involved in our country. That&rsquo;s about the politest way I can put it. Remember the Mexican government going to them about illegal immigrants? How&rsquo;s this for a nightmare scenario:<br>
Some wingnut tries to &#8220;off&#8221; Obamination, largescale riots coast to coast, UN &#8220;Peacekeepers&#8221; are sent in to restore the &#8220;peace&#8221;. The only thing worse than Obamination as president is someone trying to assasinate him. Deadly head wound that healed?</p>

			<p>Here we go again&hellip; spreading the usual generalities, half-truths and outright lies!</p>
<p>Disregarding that those impoverished Blacks were poor due to their own lack of education, skills, and lack of motivation&hellip; The UN would have us taxpayers foot the bill. Providing each lazy Black with a palatial home, fully furnished, of course, and a refrigerator stocked with his favorite beer, right?</p>
<p>Of course the UN does not recognize that people have to apply themselves and WORK for what they want. The UN feels working White taxpayers should willingly shoulder the financial burden of carrying the non-White population on their backs for all eternity.</p>
<p>Not sure about YOU, friend, but I am sick and tired of that pathetic whine about &#8220;poor Katrina victims.&#8221; The rule I learned as a kid, being: You want a decent life, you get off your butt and WORK to make it happen!</p>
<p>Admittedly, N.O. Blacks, regardless of where they now live, have a tough time in head-to-head competition with [generally ILLEGAL] Mexican immigrants for jobs. The Mexicans being recognized by business owners and corporate hiring managers as being better workers.</p>
<p>But the Blacks are steeped in a culture of laziness and lack of real education. Which can emphatically NOT be blamed on White racism. Certainly N.O. had schools and teachers. Educational opportunities were there for Blacks to avail themselves of.</p>
<p>Job opportunities also existed. So if Hispanic immigrants rather than local Blacks were preferred by local business, WHY, pray tell, would that have been the case? Given N.O. had Blacks well represented in city government? Kinda hard to scream &#8220;White racism&#8221;, with a Black (hopelessly inept) mayor and city administration, wouldn&rsquo;t you agree?</p>

			<p>I doubt it has occured to this UN twit that the reason for &#8220;segregation&#8221; in the US is that whites have been ethnically-cleansed out of what used to be very nice places to live.  Perhaps Lahari should consider the example of his countryman in the news recently, a grad student at Duke, murdered by black thugs.</p>

<p>Could you possibly, just maybe, <a href="/news/2008/03/top_aide_testif.html" rel="nofollow">try just a little, to get the Africans to stop eating each other</a>?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s work on that first, maybe then, <i>after</i> you&rsquo;ve succeeded at that, maybe then we&rsquo;ll address the housing thing &hellip;</p>
<p>There is a natural order to things. Repeat after me: first cannibalism, then housing; first cannibalism, then housing; first cannibalism &hellip; <br>

			<p> My son was in the law enforcement divisions sent to Katrina and has photos of 5 black N.O. uniformed police officers looting and in turn shot at their helicopter marked &#8216;U.S. Marshals&rsquo; I saw the many pictures taken by them and asked &#8220;where in Africa is N.O.?&#8221; I really love the article on here about &#8220;Africa in our midst&#8221; so true. Like the Muslims, whenever these people (blacks and Muslims) are outraged, they like to loot, rob, pillage, murder, rape and burn in their own communities so I say let&rsquo;s outrage them some more.</p>

How much money is still missing, and does the UN even care?  I doubt that too.  NOLA was flat-out gang warfare for some of the time right after Katrina, and there are still criminals at large.  Is the UN going after the criminals?</p>
