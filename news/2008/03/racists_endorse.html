						<p>Sen. Barack Obama addresses controversy over his pastor in Philadelphia speech today</p>
<p>Just as Sen. Barack Obama sought to distance himself from controversial racial remarks made by his pastor, an anti-American government, anti-white and virulently anti-Semitic black supremacist party has endorsed the presidential candidate on Obama&rsquo;s own website.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obama will stir the &lsquo;Melting Pot&rsquo; into a better &lsquo;Molten America,&rsquo;&#8221; states an endorsement from the New Black Panther Party, or NBPP, which is a registered team member and blogger on Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;MyObama&#8221; campaign website.</p>
<p>The NBPP is a controversial black extremist party whose leaders are notorious for their racist statements and for leading anti-white activism.</p>
<p>Malik Zulu Shabazz, NBPP national chairman, who has given scores of speeches condemning &#8220;white men&#8221; and Jews, confirmed his organization&rsquo;s endorsement of Obama in an interview with WND today.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the way Obama responded to the attack on him and the attempt to sabotage his campaign shows true leadership and character. He had a chance to denounce his pastor and he didn&rsquo;t fall for the bait. He stood up and addressed real issues of racial discord,&#8221; stated Shabazz.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Speaking to WND, Shabazz referred to Obama as a man with a &#8220;Muslim background, a man of color.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shabazz&rsquo;s NBPP&rsquo;s official platform states &#8220;white man has kept us deaf, dumb and blind,&#8221; refers to the &#8220;white racist government of America,&#8221; demands black people be exempt from military service and uses the word &#8220;Jew&#8221; repeatedly in quotation marks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The NBPP chairman was quoted at a May 2007 protest against the 400-year celebration of the settlement of Jamestown, Va., stating, &#8220;When the white man came here, you should have left him to die.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When Shabazz was denied entry to Canada last May while trying to speak at a black action event, he blamed Jewish groups and claimed Canada &#8220;is run from Israel.&#8221;</p>
<p>Canadian officials justified the action stating he has an &#8220;anti-Semitic&#8221; and &#8220;anti-police&#8221; record, but some reports blamed what was termed a minor criminal history for the decision to deny him entry.</p>
<p>He similarly blamed Jews for then-New York Mayor Rudi Giuliani&rsquo;s initial decision, later rescinded, against granting a permit for the Million Youth March.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The NBPP endorses Obama on its own page of the presidential candidate&rsquo;s official site that allows registered users to post their own blogs.</p>
<p>The group labels itself on Obama&rsquo;s site as representing &#8220;Freedom, Justice, and Peace for all of Mankind.&#8221; It links to the official NBPP website, which contains what can be arguably regarded as hate material.</p>
<p>The NBPP racked up 396 Obama campaign points, which purportedly are points given to users who raise funds, sign up other supporters or score high user ratings.</p>
<p>While it appears anyone can initially sign up as a registered supporter on Obama&rsquo;s site, it isn&rsquo;t clear whether the campaign monitors the site or approves users. There is a link on each blog page for users to report any abusers, such as those who post controversial entries, to the administrator.</p>

					<p>Obama and his allies think that his &#8220;Checkers&#8221; speech yesterday closed the book on the Wright-TUCC issue, but thanks to the New Black Panthers, they&rsquo;re bringing it right back.  Obama winning the Democrat nomination will mean that the Ds can forget about Florida, and NY and CA might be at risk.  Imagine if you&rsquo;re a Jewish voter, and people like Rev. Wright and the <span class="caps">NBPP, </span>with all their anti-Jewish rhetoric, like Obama so much.  What is Obama hiding?</p>
<p>Otherwise, anti-Semitism among blacks is really anti-white bigotry.  They just view Jews as &#8220;whiter&#8221; whites.</p>

					<p>He compared the pastor&rsquo;s diatribe to his little old grandmother who confessed to him she is afraid of black men when she walks the street on Chicago&rsquo;s South side.</p>
<p>His speech was not very good, but the press will give him a pass anyway.</p>

					<p>&#8220;Just as Sen. Barack Obama sought to distance himself from controversial racial remarks made by his pastor, an anti-American government, anti-white and virulently anti-Semitic black supremacist party has endorsed the presidential candidate on Obama&rsquo;s own website.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, but more important than that are the vast numbers of blacks among the talking <span class="caps">T.V. </span>heads who support the racist rantings 100%, revealing their obvious hatred for whites.  Some of them give lip service and call the remarks &#8220;unfortunate,&#8221; then they go right into a dim-witted support of Wright and everything he said.  </p>
<p>The entire white community has seen and heard them bluster and incompetently debate the issue with transparent feelings of animosity, hostility and hatred of whites in general.  The out-of-touch white fools will not pick up on the ominous attitudes of these blacks, but many white Americans who have been caught up in day to day living are seeing for the first time what many of us already know.  The entire situation will have more revelatory information coming out, and it will be to our advantage.</p>
<p>So far as the laughable dorks above, has anybody seen this Shebazz or whatever he calls himself?  He&rsquo;s a joke and hardly a threat to anybody.  If he&rsquo;s all we had to contend with, there wouldn&rsquo;t be a black hate problem.  He&rsquo;s not only a coward he&rsquo;s a wimp to boot.<br>

					<p>Lol&hellip;.as if Obama didn&rsquo;t already have huge problems explaining his relationship to both Jeremiah Wright and William Ayers.  He&rsquo;s completely non-viable as a candidate and doesn&rsquo;t seem to know it.  The most likely outcome is the superdelegates will choose Clinton to represent them.  They will lose the election but it probably won&rsquo;t be a humiliating defeat.  They might permanently lose the black vote and the far left vote.  They could easily recover by moving farther to the right and divesting themselves of losers (traitors, racists, anti-American freaks&hellip;.LOSERS).  Nothing but good could come of that.</p>
<p>Or&hellip;..they could field Obama.  And every dirty, nasty, vile belief and association he&rsquo;s quite obviously been involved with during his career and lifetime will be exposed for everyone to see.  The result for the dems will be catastrophic.  They will become associated with racism, bigotry, terrorism and the most toxic anti-American traitorous sentiments.  This isn&rsquo;t the 60&rsquo;s.  Only a tiny minority find those things acceptable.  The rest of us simply won&rsquo;t stand for it.  The dems might find themselves marginalized for decades over it.</p>

					<p> Obama&rsquo;s favorite preacher spoke   &mdash;   excuse me, screamed   &mdash;   in that one taped sermon of &#8220;America&rsquo;s chickens &hellip; coming home to roost&#8221; after the 911 attacks. Looks like some of Barack&rsquo;s secret anti-white, anti-Semitic, anti-American friends are now doing the same thing   &mdash;   right on top of Obama&rsquo;s campaign. Kind of reminds me of the &#8220;WKRP In Cincinnati&#8221; episode where Mr. Carlson&rsquo;s helicopter dropped 20 live turkeys onto a shopping center. Maybe the mulatto senator will wind up saying, to paraphrase Mr. Carlson, &#8220;As God is my witness, I thought this campaign could fly!&#8221;</p>

					<p>When Don Black of Stormfront contributed some money (I think it was $200) to Ron Paul&rsquo;s campaign the national media made damn sure everybody knew about it and tried to label Paul as a neo-Nazi.  But watch the mass media tip toe around the endorsement of Obama by the New Black Panthers.<br>

<p>The difference between Ron Paul and Obama is that Ron Paul doesn&rsquo;t share the beliefs of certain extremist groups that support him.  Also Obama is a black fascist and Ron Paul is a libertarian.  </p>
<p>The views expressed by Ben Wright and the black panthers are mainstream black opinion.  Obama may or may not sympathize with those views, but his political career up to this point has required that he court them.  </p>
<p>Hopefully the Obama candidacy will wake up White America, showing them what blacks really think.</p>

Nor will anyone ask him if the Great Society welfare programs that he wants to expand destroyed the black family, black morality (what there was of it), and black communities.</p>

<p>The more black rage and hatred of whites is out in the open the better. Up until now blacks have been able to keep their bigotry in closet. And white liberals have been able to pretend it doesn&rsquo;t even exist. </p>
<p>We need more of this stuff! </p>
<p>Whites are slowly being boiled alive by &#8220;diversity&#8221; and they don&rsquo;t even know it. The tactics and language used by people like Rev. Wright and the Black Panthers is stupid and highly offensive, and will only help wake whites up. </p>
<p>I say bring &#8216;em on!</p>

<p>Yep, that&rsquo;s an apt comparison, it&rsquo;s a classic smear job&hellip; one popularized by the likes of entities like the <span class="caps">SPLC. </span></p>
<p>That said Obama&rsquo;s close 20 year association with Jeremiah Wright including naming a book after one of Wright&rsquo;s sermons, having his children baptized in the Church, being married by the man, and having him as part of his campaign can not be ignored by the American media after Wright&rsquo;s offensive comments were finally broadcast by the mass media. It&rsquo;s now simply too big to ignore. Disaffected conservatives and independents will get behind McCain now as a vote against Obama. The emperor&rsquo;s clothes are gaining a bit of translucence.<br>

<p>And what does that mean? Sounds as though he is suggesting the races should meld together by mixing, the way Obamas parents did. But coming from a Black superemacist, I find it contradictary. He shouldn&rsquo;t even want a racially mixed president. Say no to a Molten America.</p>

<p>Robert,<br>
Be careful. That&rsquo;s what many German intellectuals said about Hitler.<br><br>
That being said, his name Malik Zulu Shabazz is laughable. It&rsquo;s another example of Africans playing &#8221; dress up&#8221;, sometimes with the silly meaningless psuedo-African/ Arabic names, other times by absurd clothing and many times with both. Their danger lies in the fact that they influence a sufficient number of their own who are very susceptible to their bizarre rantings punctuated with the wild eyes, the sandpaper voices and the seizure like body gyrations.<br><br>

					<p>Could someone tell me why the lies spewed by Rev. Wright and other black church leaders must be accompied by screaming, jumping up and down,clapping, singing and numerous &#8220;amens&#8221; to the anti-American, hate-filled rhetoric that blacks say are standard fare in their churches? Is this an example of ministers whipping gullible people into a frenzy of believing the lies? I recall images of another leader screaming at masses of his people, but instead of jumping around, he stood with his<br>
arm stiffly upraised. His followers copied his stance, but instead of yelling &#8220;amen,&#8221; they responded with &#8220;Heil Hitler!&#8221;</p>

					<p>Well, not only have we heard from him, but Jesse Jackson, Farrakhan, and of course Wright. It&rsquo;s hardly necessary to encourage Blacks to vote Obama, and these militant Black supremacists should know that already. What they forget is that Obama can&rsquo;t carry the election by firing up 13% of an already supportive Black population, while alienating the White majority. Obama&rsquo;s people are already working feverishly to try and do some serious damage control, as a result of Wrights controversial sermons, but somehow many Blacks can&rsquo;t resist the impulse to already start hinting at a Black revolution, to finally take control of the country, and get back at Whitey. You would at least think they would have enough wisdom to hold off on it all, but Obamas success has made them cocky. Already, Blacks are all over the Net bragging that Whitey&rsquo;s day is over, and to get ready for Black rule- Not so fast!!!!</p>

					<p>To blacks, a white harming them is worse than a black harming them.  It&rsquo;s almost like saying &#8220;only I can fight with my family&hellip;but <span class="caps">YOU </span>can&rsquo;t&#8221;</p>

					<p><i>Could someone tell me why the lies spewed by Rev. Wright and other black church leaders must be accompied by screaming, jumping up and down,clapping, singing and numerous &ldquo;amens&rdquo; &hellip;<i></i></i></p>
<p>June, I think it&rsquo;s a Black behavoural trait.  I&rsquo;ve heard they behave pretty much the same way at the theatre, hollering, screaming, jumping about, just like at church. I once sat near to four Blacks in a theatre and had to listen to a running commentary, advice to the characters, as well as barely suppressed yells and screams.  It&rsquo;s a whole nother ball-game.</p>
<p>NB: Im practicing my &#8216;hotmail tabs thingy&rsquo; so ignore any odd characters or typos.<br>

					<p>The fact that so some so called &#8220;white supremacist&#8221; groups supported Paul doesn&rsquo;t mean he shared their views.  Obama&rsquo;s association with Jeremiah Wright and Wright&rsquo;s fondness of Louis Farrakhan would be like Ron Paul having Aryan Nations Pastor Richard Butler has his mentor and confidant.  The closest that Paul came to sounding like a white racist was a few references to black violent crime statistics and the violent nature of black men in his newsletter in the early 1990&rsquo;s.  Big deal, but the truth is always racist.    </p>
