						<p>The number of English learners in Orange County public schools has been decreasing steadily since 2002, while the number of bilingual students has been increasing over the same time span, according to a report on the state of Orange County released this week.</p>
<p>English learner enrollment has fallen 11 percent since the county&rsquo;s 10-year high in 2002, to 141,762 students from 159,145 students, according to the 2008 Orange County Community Indicators report presented Tuesday to the board of supervisors. Orange County has about 504,000 children enrolled in public school.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the number of students designated bilingual when they entered school has grown 23 percent since 2002, to 99,892 students from 80,998 students.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the Santa Ana Unified School District, where about 60 percent of students are English learners, district officials say that increased focus on passing proficiency exams has led to lower numbers of English learners. Meanwhile, the high cost of living appears to be gradually changing the composition of neighborhoods, causing an increase in the number of bilingual students.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cost of home prices being so high, what used to be a neighborhood of all immigrant, port-of-entry people, now has some bilingual families moving into the neighborhood,&rdquo; said Howard Bryan, director of English learner programs for Santa Ana Unified. &ldquo;More children are coming from homes where the parents speak both languages, as opposed to only one language.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>Spanish is the language spoken in Mexico.  Why should there be much concern for the English language in Mexican schools?</p>

			<p>&ldquo;The cost of home prices being so high, what used to be a neighborhood of all immigrant, port-of-entry people, now has some bilingual families moving into the neighborhood,&rdquo; said Howard Bryan, director of English learner programs for Santa Ana Unified. &ldquo;More children are coming from homes where the parents speak both languages, as opposed to only one language.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Forgive me for being naive, but this doesn&rsquo;t make sense.  I didn&rsquo;t know there was a difference between all immigrant point-of-entry neighborhoods and those habitated by bilingual mexicans.  Either way, race plays an important factor in their decision to move.  Us whites are expensive to live by, aren&rsquo;t we?  If you want to destroy the neighborhood, it&rsquo;ll cost ya.</p>

			<p>How much do you want to bet that the &#8220;bilingual&#8221; people talked about in this article don&rsquo;t really know English either?  After all, someone that speaks fluent Spanish and primitive English is technically &#8220;bilingual&#8221;.  </p>
<p>I hate what this country is becoming, and it&rsquo;s getting worse every day.</p>

			<p>I lived in this county for 22 years and I saw it change.</p>
<p>The way it looks now is terrifying. It is not just the total invasion of immigrants - that can actually be dealt with. It is the (to me) utterly sickening gap between the rich and the poor in this country. Orange County was never really this way. I went back there 3 years ago to Garden Grove and stayed in a $100/night hotel. All hotels are run by Asians of some sort who are some sort of up and coming upper middle class. I think Vietnamese and Koreans. Maids and desk help were all Filipinos and Mexicans who hardly spoke English at all. A walk down Garden Grove Boulevard and onto Harbor is frightening. I walked into a store that was all Asian. They looked at me like I was from Mars so I walked out. There were many such stores. In general, the area was swarming with immigrants, mostly Hispanics and SE Asians, and mostly very poor. There are still some working class Whites around but they all look beat, like they are working 2 jobs to survive.</p>
<p>Later I went to a wedding in Irvine and along the way we passed through various parts of Mexico. The wedding was held in fancy digs with a very upscale clientele. The whole repulsive scene is reminiscent of a 3rd world country with its wild, insane, outrageous gaps between a wealthy upper class and groveling and immiserated poor working class. That&rsquo;s nothing but a stage for revolution. What in God&rsquo;s name are we creating in this society? </p>

			<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget the private all Spanish schools that Mexico has been able to establish for Mexicans in the U.S.  This is an instance of a foreign state acting as a defacto conqueror.  But one effect would be a lower Spanish speaking population at public schools.</p>

			<p>California budget for K-12 education is roughly $50 billion per annum. About 48% of enrolled students in public K-12 schools are Hispanic, about half of whom speak little or no English. It doesn&rsquo;t take an Einstein to figure out where did they come from. It&rsquo;s clear that if it weren&rsquo;t for almost two decades of uncontrolled and mostly illegal immigration from Mexico to California, there would have been 25% - 40% less students in our public schools. These students cost the state from est. $12 billion to $20 billion annually. They are the ones who put us in the red, and now state universities, already underfunded, are going to suffer because of that.</p>

			<p>Lydia,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure where we can go.  I&rsquo;m in Germany now, and it is inundated with every sort of immigrant you can imagine.  It&rsquo;s hard to hear a word of German while using public transportation.  Of course, then violence comes, the main trouble makers are non-whites.</p>
<p>Perhaps we need a white homeland within America.</p>
