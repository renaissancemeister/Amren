<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>I grew up in a traditional Chinese household, where I was taught my future life partner must have an equal, if not better, upbringing than mine. That mentality is embedded in the ancient saying, &#8220;A bamboo door should match a bamboo door; a wood door should match a wood door.&#8221; Essentially, what it means is you have to marry someone in the same social class if you want the relationship to last.</p>
<p>The Chinese are not alone in this worldview. Many Indians are still bound by caste and the arranged unions that flow from it. And acute class-consciousness is a persistent feature of British identity.</p>
<p>But in North America, it isn&rsquo;t cool to openly judge people by class; in courtship, we view prospective mates through the less discriminatory lens of &#8220;compatibility&#8221; instead. Yet, however varied are our criteria for compatibility &mdash; whether emotional, intellectual, social, physical or financial &mdash; one way or another, coupling comes down to class, whether we egalitarian-minded New Worlders like it or not.</p>
<p>Of course, we&rsquo;re in denial about this and cling tightly to the cover of romantic love that fuels our multi-billion dollar wedding industry.</p>
<p>The point &mdash; we&rsquo;re harder-edged than we like to admit when it comes to picking mates &mdash; was given some support recently by Spanish academic Dan Rodriguez-Garcia, a visiting scholar at the University of Toronto.</p>
<p>The social scientist from Barcelona&rsquo;s Autonomous University looked at how race/ethnicity, class and gender intersected in marriages in Greater Toronto (using data from the 2001 census) and uncovered some unexpected patterns.</p>
<p>The uncomfortable gist of his work: Visible minorities marry up by marrying down.</p>
<p>Of the roughly 710,000 unions in Greater Toronto, about three-quarters involve couples of the same cultural background &mdash; what scholars call &#8220;ethnic endogamy.&#8221; That means about 25 per cent of marriages here are &#8220;mixed.&#8221;</p>
<p>In those marriages, Rodriguez-Garcia found that visible minorities were more likely to marry whites even if whites were less educated and earned a lower income.</p>
<p>&#8220;Minority members have to compensate, or bring more educational and economic resources to the marriage market, when they marry someone from an ethnic group of higher social standing,&#8221; concluded Rodriguez-Garcia&rsquo;s 57-page report, titled &#8220;Intermarriage Patterns and Socio-Ethnic Stratification among Ethnic Groups in Toronto.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many &mdash; including some of my colleagues in the Star newsroom &mdash; find this proposition offensive. As one put it: &#8220;I can&rsquo;t imagine asking (someone) to participate in a story since it would mean that the person of colour married &lsquo;down&rsquo; in terms of salary but &lsquo;up&rsquo; in terms of colour, which sounds incredibly racist about the marrying white, and insulting about the lack of education.&#8221;</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a surprising split in reactions between whites and visible minorities.</p>
<p>Whites tended to be outraged with the &#8220;status exchange&#8221; thesis, while all members of minority groups I interviewed agreed it bears a grain of truth.</p>
<p>Louie Gong, a vice-president of the Mavin Foundation, a Seattle-based advocacy group for mixed-race people, said we all choose mates based on many factors, including romantic love and status, which are not mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>&#8220;I personally don&rsquo;t find the study offensive because internalized racism and class can certainly have an impact on our choice of partners,&#8221; said the 33-year-old British Columbia native, who is of mixed Chinese, aboriginal and European heritage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pop culture has taught us to mate based on the idea of love, so admitting anything other than that would reflect very negatively on our character.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth Abbott, a historian with the University of Toronto, said the notion of romantic love is a relatively modern aspect of marriage that emerged in the late 18th and early 19th century as individual freedom expanded.</p>
<p>However, our contemporary mate selection criteria are not really as different from our forebears&rsquo; as we think. Abbott says our comfort level with another person very much depends on shared experiences that come down to socioeconomics.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t think people are blinded by love,&#8221; explains Abbott, author of the upcoming book, Marriage: Where We&rsquo;ve Been and Where We&rsquo;re Heading. &#8220;We all take calculated risks. You may love a loser, but you will try to change them or it won&rsquo;t work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sociologist David Popenoe, director of Rutgers University&rsquo;s National Marriage Project, said he wasn&rsquo;t surprised by Rodriguez-Garcia&rsquo;s findings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nowadays, people base their relationships on feelings, but everybody wants higher status,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a touchy subject because it&rsquo;s not necessarily something we want to talk about in romantic love.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rodriguez-Garcia, who is married to a Jewish-Canadian scholar, believes social class is a powerful factor when it comes to mate selection. Couples certainly don&rsquo;t enter into a mixed union based on conscious or calculated decision-making to advance themselves up the social ladder or to fill up their wallets, he says, &#8220;It&rsquo;s not so much about &lsquo;What am I going to gain?&rsquo; &#8220;The reality is much more complex than that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Despite the increased mixing, social differences and prejudices are very persistent. The association between minority status, which is historically inherited, and social status is difficult to make disappear. There will always be new statuses within the mixtures.&#8221;</p>

			<p>I have long wondered about the apparent flirtatiousness of some Oriental women toward me.  These are nice-looking women, not kids but certainly young enough to be my children.  I am not so vain as to believe that they really had a romantic/sexual interest in me, and I ascribed their flirty ways to some Confucian cultural norm of being nice to old men.  There is always the possibility that they are golddiggers, but they&rsquo;d not get much out of me, and nothing about my dress, my house, or the car I drive would lead anyone to think that I was well off.  But, according to Professor Rodriguez-Garcia, I have something better than money, White genes.  Sorry, Eastern ladies, I&rsquo;m married.  </p>

			<p>Successful marriage can only happen if three things match: intelligence, race and social class, in that order of importance.  Violating this doesn&rsquo;t guarantee failure (any more than following this, guarantees success) but it does have a HUGE effect on the ratio of success to failure.</p>

			<p>Rodriguez-Garcia Chalupastein  says,<br/>
&#8220;Couples certainly don&rsquo;t enter into a mixed union based on conscious or calculated decision-making to advance themselves up the social ladder or to fill up their wallets&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Leave it to a liberal minority to ignore his ironclad views on evolution when it conflicts with his orwellian race ideology.<br/>
Women (whites and Asians), whether they are conscious of it not, are genetically programmed to select a male who will best provide for a family. Whereas, men are genetically searching for fertile women  &mdash;  firm breasts and curves. So the men are more likely than women to approach love &#8220;romantically&rdquo; because the women are genetically driven to be more interested in the current bank accounts and earning potential, even though they pretend otherwise because it seems so calculating and so out of character with their self-images as virgin princesses. </p>
<p>Perhaps Rodriguez analysis was flawed because of the large disparity in the number of white women who marry black males compared with the minute number of white men who marry black women. It&rsquo;s been my observation that most of these white women who marry blacks are unattractive and large. The probability of these women marrying for social status and money are somewhat limited. So maybe that&rsquo;s where Rodriquez got his silly conclusion.  <br/>

<p>These minorities are not stupid, they know exactly what they are doing. They are after white genes, plain and simple. They understand that even if the white partner they choose is not all that successful, their chances of producing a child who is above their own race&rsquo;s normal intelligence is greatly increased and therefore will give them an edge.</p>

			<p>It is likely that the white mates think they are either trading up or at least breaking even in these relationships. Something they may be unable to do within their own race. </p>
<p>This certainly seems to be the case for fat (and often ugly) white women who date skinny (often average looking) black guys. Which seems to be quite common. </p>
<p>&hellip;But I am interested to know whether or not the &#8220;inter-racial marriage patterns&#8221; are the same in majority non-white countries. </p>

Where I work, they hired a college student last fall. He&rsquo;s from S. Carolina. Nice guy. He talked about meeting his girlfriend the first week he started college here. She&rsquo;s Korean. He moved in with the family. They love him. He got her pregnant. They still love him and wanted them to have the baby.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if race had anything to do with it but the baby was severely deformed. She had an abortion. He&rsquo;s still living with the family and he still talks about her all the time.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t said anything but I&rsquo;m hoping he learned a lesson and he&rsquo;s using condoms. Hearing him tell about how they met the first week of school and how the parents asked him to move in with them made me to suspect the family was doing everything to hold on to this guy and he isn&rsquo;t getting away.<br/>

<p>I need a Thesaurus and an Artificial intelligence robot to even figure out what this guy is trying to say. I&rsquo;m guessing the author&rsquo;s a recent college graduate.</p>
<p>One thing he seems trying to say is that income is a more important factor than ever. It&rsquo;s no surprise people consider money before marrying, all values have been deconstructed to such an extent the only thing left people value is money. Non-whites in the West do value one thing, and one thing only, besides money, love of their own racism. Frankly, in today&rsquo;s, no one will help anyone - no one will help whites, world, it&rsquo;s no surprise the average citizen is genuinely fearful of marrying a &#8216;loser&rsquo;. <br/>

			<p>I live in a Canadian city with a high number of Asians.  </p>
<p>Every time I see an earnest-looking white male accompanying an Asian female, I can&rsquo;t help but want to slap some sense into him, for not being aware that he is the prey and she is the predator.  He is flattered by her interest and submissiveness, all the while his White genes are the prize she is after.  </p>
<p>With that, she has a partial foothold in the White race, while he exits the White race.</p>

<p>I live in a city with a moderate Asian population and the White males who go for Asian females do so for the same reason(s) that some White women go for black men.</p>
<p>1. wants that &#8220;liberal 21st century non-racist&#8221; look<br/>
2. was not able to find any white man (or woman) who will love back</p>
<p>and majority of Asian women in the arms of our White men look far from attractive.  </p>
<p>The good news is interracial relationships are still rare and the bad news is there is a growing number of WM/BF.</p>

<p>   I support whites marrying whites, but I can&rsquo;t say I totally agree with you. East Asian women come from traditional societies that emphasize deference to males. I wouldn&rsquo;t say they&rsquo;re more submissive; this is a myth. Their focus is mainly on home and the family.</p>
<p>While many American, British and to a lesser extent European women, have embraced gender feminism, which makes them more competitive, aggressive, and un-lady-like in their behavior  &mdash;  things some old fashioned men don&rsquo;t particularly care for.</p>

			<p>This report is confusing. He does not acknowledge a category caled &#8220;white people&#8221; but breaks them down into British,French,Western European,Southern European,etc. This toatlly confuses things as most whites look upon other whites as being similar to them,tho they differ in ethnicity. You tell your Irish mom you&rsquo;re marrying a Scot  &mdash;  -big deal! Tell her you&rsquo;re marrying a Trinidadian,its going to be interesting!!  Also,he points out that the CHINESE do the LEAST amount of mixing. Over 90% marry Chinese,which is a bit extraordinary. These Chinese are very clannish. Japanese by contrast marry out 1/2 the time-very high!  Most Chinese women are dreadfully unattractive. </p>

			<p>So why is it, I ask myself, that Whites who would never consider mating with Blacks will choose Orientals?  It seems to me that, whatever the racial differences, there is a good deal of overlap in characteristics in the higher races.  Just as there are lots of Whites and Orientals with IQs of 115, there will be lots of Whites and Orientals with very similar impulse control, dedication to child-rearing, and willingness to use reason instead of force, the very attributes so lacking among Blacks.  There will be an appreciable number of Orientals who are closer to White norms and ideals than many biological Whites.  For Whites who have been taught that racial differences are entirely a matter of physical appearance, as most Whites are, there is no good reason not to mate with an Oriental who meets their intellectual and behavioral standards.  I think that few people pay proper attention to the family they will marry into, or recognize that the individual they are marrying may not be typical of the breed.  They might be surprised when their offspring are strange to them, taking after their spouse&rsquo;s family instead of their own.  </p>

			<p>The media in Canada agressivly promotes interracial coupling, and I remember reading a column in the Toronto star where the commentator said that his dream (and probably the dream of most liberals of his stripe) is that Whites and non-Whites would &#8220;mix and marry&#8221;, and produce a deracinated Canada where the population was completely mixed. Supposedly this would end the terrible phenominon of White racism forever and usher in a new era of peace and tranquility. So there it is. The left does not want &#8220;diversity&#8221;&hellip;they want a homoginized sameness in the racial makeup of Canada, and eventualy the world. Of course diversity of thought is banned in Canada, so I wont even touch on that. Implicit in this wish is the consious or subconsious realization that different groups cannot exist in peace and harmony- and this is an admission that liberal ideology is a complete failure. That it would take a tryrannical goverment to ensure that all couples are mixed is not lost on them either. They wish this as well.</p>

			<p>Hmm&hellip;shall we examine the motives here? </p>
<p>1.Marrying a white equals social advancement that one would not get marrying within one&rsquo;s culture. (now *why* might that be?)</p>
<p>2.Marrying a white means you won&rsquo;t worry nearly so much about having food and shelter - which your own kind can&rsquo;t guarantee. </p>
<p>3.Marrying a white means a ticket out of a lousy nation. (not a new thing, poor women have been hitting on rich tourists since time immortal)</p>

			<p>&#8220;East Asian women &ldquo;submissive&rdquo;?&#8221;</p>
<p>And if whites actually think that the Asian women consider that white genes were preferred even in the face of death, consider what happened at the end of World War 2:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Okinawa" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Okinawa</a></p>
<p>&#8220;With the impending victory of American troops, civilians often committed mass suicide, urged on by Japanese soldiers. They persuaded locals that victorious American soldiers would go on a rampage of killing and raping. (A revisionist historian has claimed that rape was &#8220;a general practice against Japanese women&#8221;, estimating in excess of 10,000 victims during the Okinawa campaign.[1] Ryukyu Shimpo, one of the two major Okinawan newspapers, wrote: &#8220;There are many Okinawans who have testified that the Japanese Army directed them to commit suicide. There are also people who have testified that they were handed grenades by Japanese soldiers&#8221; (to blow themselves up).[10] Some of the civilians, having been induced by Japanese propaganda to believe that U.S. soldiers were barbarians who committed horrible atrocities (It has been suggested that the mutilation of dead enemies by U.S. servicemen may have been referenced), killed their families and themselves to avoid capture. Some Okinawans threw themselves and their family members from the cliffs where the Peace Museum now resides. Other Okinawans were murdered by Japanese to prevent their capture or to steal their food and supplies. Japanese American Military Intelligence Service[11] combat translators with the U.S. military tried to convince civilians to not kill themselves, even climbing into caves to talk to them. Their efforts had limited success.[12]</p>

			<p>There is absolutely no doubt that for more than most coloured people who mix with caucasian - they may do it for uplifting themselves within their social circle.</p>
<p>But this little article presents a few little problems. I am a first generation coloured immigrant with an east-european girlfriend and we are serious. We talk about our future and are dead set on never ever having any kids (even if we eventually marry someone else). I am against mixed race children myself.<br/>
So please explain to me the genetic wealth I am after.</p>
<p>Next, my social circle of friends has about 3 people. So there isn&rsquo;t a party I hope to find to impress with my white prize. </p>
<p>And lastly, and most importantly, the ethnic minority to which I belong has above average university graduation rates, and a high median income. As the article states, just how would I be attaining superior genes to pass on to my kids if my white partner is less educated and may end up burdening me with her costs of living over the long haul?</p>

			<p>Status, which includes material wealth, is what women most often seek. Fame or notoriety, even if it is only local, is as much a sexual currency as dollars. </p>
<p>Being in an interracial relationship is, for the vacuous, a way of appearing &#8216;cosmopolitan&rsquo; and &#8216;down with the cool people&rsquo;.  It&rsquo;s the same effect as dining in an ethnic restaurant, but taken to the next level. </p>

			<p>This tendency toward race-mixing is increasing with each generation. It can only lead to the total annihilation of the white race through offspring which are mainly non-white. Since Canada has a policy of flooding the country with non-white immigrants, and muzzles any form of free speech against it, Canada is sealing its fate. <br/>
    The only hope for the whites is to form communities which are completely isolated from non-whites. Yet this is probably illegal according to the anti-white government. <br/>
    A movement needs to be aggressively promoted for a white honmeland within North America.<br/>
    The question is, do enough Canadians care?</p>

			<p>I live in a city with a moderate Asian population and the White males who go for Asian females do so for the same reason(s) that some White women go for black men.<br/>
1. wants that &ldquo;liberal 21st century non-racist&rdquo; look<br/>
2. was not able to find any white man (or woman) who will love back<br/>
Posted by at 12:02 AM on March 19 <br/>
************************************************************<br/>
Why is there a tendency among so many people to take a complex issue, break it down into a few bullet points, and then proceed to ignore all the subtlety and nuances that are often involved? </p>
<p>As a North American White male who has had relationships with both White and Asian women, I believe that the above bullet points are not only widely off the mark, they do not even begin to approach the reality of the situation.  </p>
<p>While I cannot speak for other men, I would argue that many times North American men seeking relationships with Asian women is largely due to cultural reasons.  It certainly was in my case, as well as with many of my friends.  To be blunt, cultural values in the United States have decayed substantially in the last 50 years.  Today, it is very difficult to find North American women who are truly lady-like and feminine.  Go to any public gathering and watch how the women comport themselves socially.  Listen to see how they communicate.  It never ceases to amaze me when I see an attractive young woman dropping the word F*** as casually as a sailor.  </p>
<p>It is also very difficult to find North American women with a strong sense of family.  Among many of the Asian cultures, the notion of family is of prime importance, if not the most important.  Most of the strongest and closest families I have ever witnessed have been Asian families.  </p>
<p>Also, many Asian women really value education - both in themselves, and in their partner.  In the United States, so often people who work diligently at academics are derided as &ldquo;nerds&rdquo;.  It is as if in our current culture it is of value is to be ignorant and incapable of critical thinking.</p>
<p>I could go on and on about this, but I&rsquo;ll stop here so I don&rsquo;t generate an excessively long post.  </p>
<p>In short, I believe the growing White male/ Asian woman phenomenon is largely because of the rapid decay of North American cultural values and is not really about race.  It certainly isn&rsquo;t due to something as ridiculous as a desire to attain that vaunted &ldquo;liberal 21st century non-racist look&rdquo;.<br/>

<p>It is when I read posts such as this one that I realize that this movement of ours probably isn&rsquo;t going to go anywhere.  It seems that we have more white men on this website defending their attraction to Asian women than complimenting and uplifting us white women as they should be.  Why should respectable white women like me even bother with this site?</p>
<p>It is absurd to claim that most white women DO NOT value education or family.  You sir, who wrote this post, are part of our problem.  Either you aren&rsquo;t looking hard enough, or you have enough of your own short comings to where you can&rsquo;t attract a decent white woman, or you just don&rsquo;t care enough about your own race.  Don&rsquo;t act like you are one of us if you are going to come on here and criticize and distance yourself away from your own (women) the way you are.</p>
<p>I am from the South, and it is very rare to find a woman down there who IS NOT lady like or family-oriented.  In fact, it is pretty much the same scenario in any state across the nation that typically votes red.  You sir, are part of the problem with the white race.  Stop blaming white women and start examining your own short comings.  If the whopping majority of white men are still marrying white women then white women must not be all that bad huh?</p>
<p>If there is any reason that this whole movement of ours is going to go to pieces, it will be because of white men like the one who wrote the above post.  At least the loyal white women on this website are only into white men.  The ones on this site who are into black men openly admit that they are not part of our cause.  What I am trying to figure out is why so many white men who claim to be part of our cause also claim to prefer Asian women over white women.  Does this make sense to anyone?  It doesn&rsquo;t to me.</p>

<p>Courtney, I suspect you&rsquo;re paying inordinate attention to posts such as the one you&rsquo;re responding to here. They are a distinct minority and many of them are snide drive-byes. I live in what ought according to the logic of multiculturalists and miscegenationists a hotbed of yellow fever (ie. Chicagoland) but you don&rsquo;t see it nearly as often as some would have you believe. I would guess something like 80-85% of the white men you see with Asian women are wimpy undergraduates. In any case these matches are a very distinct minority.</p>
<p>My unsolicited two cents: don&rsquo;t give this issue more concern than it deserves</p>

			<p>Courtney &amp; Cassiodorus</p>
<p>I would like to point out that in my previous post I never once attacked, nor even named White women during my argument.  I personally like White women and find many of them attractive.  I only addressed cultural reasons because I fully believe that it is largely culturally driven.  And, when I used the term &ldquo;Asian&rdquo; it was certainly in reference to culture and not race.  I truly believe that this is an important distinction.  For example, I would classify a third generation Chinese-American as Asian racially, but that individual is completely of the American culture.  </p>
<p>Additionally, it was not an attempt at a &ldquo;snide drive by&rdquo;.  It was an honest attempt to reply to the question of why we are seeing White men moving into relationships with Asian females.  In truth, you could have just as easily substituted &ldquo;Asian females&rdquo; with &ldquo;South American females&rdquo;, or &ldquo;East European females&rdquo; and the argument would have been the exact same.  I am not approaching this from some type of Asian Fetish position.      </p>
<p>I find it very interesting to find the anger and abuse that is thrown at White men who have relationships with Asian women.  It is truly fascinating.  People will write them off as losers who can&rsquo;t get a &ldquo;decent relationship&rdquo; with a white woman, or as &ldquo;wimpy undergraduates&rdquo;.  If that is the case, why is there so much anger and contempt?  If all of these men are just degenerate worthless individuals, why should anyone even notice, let alone care?</p>
<p>I would argue that this knee-jerk reaction is due precisely because this is not the case.  I can only speak anecdotally here, but I would argue that the demographics of the typical White male who is prone to date Asian women is thus:<br/>
1) Of above average intelligence<br/>
2) Typically well educated with possibly one or more advanced degrees<br/>
3) Economically stable and family oriented</p>
<p>You know, some of the traits that are completely of no use to any modern technical civilization or society - the absolute undesirable dregs of humanity.</p>
<p>It is always nice to just heap ridicule onto something instead of even bothering to acknowledge that there may be an underlying cause to some trend.  It is certainly emotionally satisfying to unleash righteous indignation.  And, any disconcerting notions can immediately be laid to rest decisively.  </p>
<p>However, in the end doing this is always disastrous.  So many individuals on this site fret about the problems of the Black community, or the Latino community.  They rail about the cultural degradation they see taking place in these communities, as if the White communities&rsquo; culture just floats above it all, secure and pristine.  This is blatant fantasy.  </p>
<p>My position is that North America is undergoing cultural decay.  And that this reality is causing some segment of the population to perform the only type of voting that actually has an effect: Voting with their feet.  We are seeing this with respect to changes in relationship patterns, and with increasing amounts of Americans immigrating abroad.  </p>
<p>This website is called the &ldquo;American Renaissance&rdquo; is it not?  How can you have a renaissance without introspection?  How do you have a renaissance without being able of identifying troubling problems and attempting to correct their underlying causes?<br/>
  <br/>
It is just so much easier to snicker at others, I would imagine.  <br/>

<p>I live in Chicago to, and the Whites I see with Asian women seem like perfectly normal white people; nothing &#8220;wimpy&#8221; about them. I once worked at a mail-order seafood company in Chicago, and it was truly amazing to hear the foul language coming out of the mouths of &#8220;good looking&#8221; white women. So I guess Courtney SHOULD be angry at Asian women who are in direct competition with her for the white man as mate, I&rsquo;m afraid!</p>

<p>Because it amounts to civilizational and racial suicide, the contemptible nature of miscegenationists notwithstanding. The fact that some of these people display what you&rsquo;ve sarcastically described as </p>
<p>&#8221; &hellip;  some of the traits that are completely of no use to any modern technical civilization or society - the absolute undesirable dregs of humanity&#8221;</p>
<p>is beside the point. You may as well ask someone to murder his own children and replace them with aliens, because the aliens have better manners. No solution to a &#8220;cultural&#8221; problem that requires the replacement of American whites in a nation they created deserves anything but contempt. To paraphrase Joe Louis, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with America that flooding it with Asians and half-castes will fix. &#8220;Cultural decay?&#8221; Yes, and one of its symptoms is enthusiasm for miscegenation. </p>

			<p>Anonymous poster,</p>
<p>You are accusing Cassiodorus and I of doing towards white/Asian couples what you were doing in your first post towards white women.  You were making cheaply ridiculous and obnoxious generalizations about them.  You claim that you weren&rsquo;t directing your comments at white women when that is in fact what you were doing.  In fact you reemphasize your low opinion of white women in the second post you write in which you are trying to say you are not doing those things.</p>
<p>All of this aside, criticizing the behavior of white/Asian couples should be considered okay and normal on this website since we are about preserving the white race and culture.  Criticizing white women on the other hand (in the manner you were at least; based on shady facts) should NOT be considered normal or okay.  In my opinion it is downright divisive and destructive to our cause.</p>
<p>Secondly, Cassiodorus is correct.  Most of the white men I myself see with Asian women are wimpy dorks who probably couldn&rsquo;t get a white woman if they tried.  The issue I am concerned about is not necessarily that I am afraid of us white women getting serious competition from Asian women (believe me, I don&rsquo;t think us white women have anything to worry about).  What I am concerned about is the double standard on this website.  </p>
<p>White women who go after black men are ridiculed while the white men who go after Asian women are not.  I understand that it is a minority of men on this site who are more attracted to Asian women than white women, but I am concerned about the fact that their lifestyles are considered okay by many on here whereas any white female who came on and admited she was more into black men while being a part of our cause would get banished from the website (not literally of course but you know what I mean).</p>
<p>So, that right there is what the issue is.  Obviously, (and this should be obvious to you) most people still marry someone from their own race (over 90% of people from each race do according to the US Census Bureau).  So considering those statistics, I think it is you sir who needs to reexamine your argument and not us. Going after Asian women over white women is obviously abnormal if you are a white man.</p>

<p>I disagree.  White females who debase themselves with black males are usually unattractive and they like the attention they get from blacks or they are not unattractive self-destructive women with absolutely no self-esteem.</p>
<p>White males who go with Asian females are men who are attracted to intelligent, beautiful, feminine women possessing traditional values rather than brainwashed feminist liberals who are dumber than a gallon of paint.     </p>

<p>Look at Halle Barry; isn&rsquo;t it hilarious she eventually ends up with a White man, even though she has been whining for years about her &#8220;Blackness?&#8221;</p>

<p>Once again our friend here takes a cheap shot at white women even though he claims he doesn&rsquo;t do this.  And I wouldn&rsquo;t say &#8220;beautiful&#8221; really describes Asian women.  You obviously need to take a trip to Sweden, Italy, Russia, Argentina, Australia or the southern part of the U.S. if you want to see what &#8220;beautiful&#8221; is.  I sure do see a lot of Asian girls trying to look white but seldom the reverse.  And it is news to me that most white women are dumb as well as feminist.  I must have been living under a rock my whole life.</p>
