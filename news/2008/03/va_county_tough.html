						<p>Months after Prince William County began one of the country&rsquo;s strongest crackdowns on illegal immigrants, some officials and residents say illegals and other residents appear to be leaving.</p>
<p>Dave Whitlow, town manager of Dumfries, said officials started noticing the change a few months ago when they canvassed communities popular among Hispanic families and found roughly 165 residences vacant among 1,600 houses and townhouses.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In July, the Board of County Supervisors unanimously agreed to have the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency train six police officers and one resident for an Alien Crime Unit.</p>
<p>The detail began enforcement March 1 and is assisting officers, who have a suspect in a crime &mdash; including traffic offenses &mdash; and find probable cause that he or she is in the country illegally. Before then, officers were not authorized to make arrests for illegal immigration.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jason D. Grant, spokesman for the Prince William&rsquo;s Department of Economic Development, said the county has not seen signs of an economic downtown as a result of the crackdown, but officials, merchants and residents say changes are obvious.</p>
<p>Officials in Dumfries &mdash; a town of roughly 5,000 residents on the southern tip of Prince William &mdash; also said about 10 percent of housing units are for sale or in foreclosure.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>County police Chief Charlie T. Deane said Prince Williams was &#8220;at the forefront in this nation of enforcement  &hellip; of immigration issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also said the department continues to receive complaints about the behavior of illegal immigrants and others who hang around day-labor sites waiting for work.</p>
<p>However, a day-laborer outside a 7-Eleven store in Woodbridge said Tuesday that fewer workers have been coming to sites since the resolution was passed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mr. Castro said sales have decreased mostly in such non-essential goods as tools, hardware and kitchenware. However, he said sales of milk and other foods have remained about the same.</p>
<p>Mexicans Without Borders, among the groups that protested the resolution, agreed today that residents are leaving.</p>

			<p>Not only will the economy of most cities not be affected negatively by illegal aliens departing, they will probably be affected positively. Money saved on crime, social services, schooling, etc. etc.  </p>

			<p>Everyone in the county isn&rsquo;t dead yet?  And they&rsquo;re enforcing legal immigration?  Shockers!</p>

			<p>So, after all the screaming and moaning, it turns out that we don&rsquo;t need them in our work force after all.  We certainly don&rsquo;t need their crime, their squalid &#8220;curture&#8221;, their abuse of the social service system, etc.  Good ridence to them all.</p>
<p>This would provide a wonderful example for the next congressman/woman who says that we need &#8220;comprehensive&#8221; immigration reform(amnesty) because &#8220;there are so many jobs that Americans won&rsquo;t take&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Good to hear.  If every county enforced illegal immigration laws like this one did, we&rsquo;d have the problem licked.  It also goes to show that we don&rsquo;t need these illegals, contrary to what these business owners have been trumpeting.</p>

			<p>The larger observation to surmise here is that we have been continuously and deliberately lied to about the impossibility of deporting (or making self-deport, a concept the liars religiously avoid mentioning) illegals, and the (bogus) need for illegals to take jobs Americans &#8216;won&rsquo;t do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s all briefly pause a moment to remember who these inveterate liars were (and are): President of the United States George W. Bush; Senator John McCain; Senator Lindsey Graham; Senator John Kyl; and about every Democratic Senator and Congress member. Remember them.  </p>

			<p>Positive things happen wherever laws are enforced, ridding this area of illegals will make the life of taxpaying citizens better, they will wonder why they had not thought of it before.</p>

			<p>In related news, after surviving the Great Depression, Bear Stearns was sold today for a scant $2 a share. This, incidentally, is on par with the inflated value of diversity and multiculturalism.</p>
<p>They learned the lesson of what happens to those who embrace diversity and multiculturalism the hard way. </p>
<p>Nothing affirms our views more than the cold, hard reality of valuation.</p>
<p>The chickens are beginning to come home to roost, my friends.</p>
