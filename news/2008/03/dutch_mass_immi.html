						<p>The majority of the Dutch are negative on Islam and immigration. Additionally, their knowledge of Dutch history is meagre, according to a survey by three history professors.</p>
<p>According to 56 percent of the Dutch, Islam is a threat to the Dutch identity. As well, 57 percent named admitting large groups of immigrants as &#8220;the biggest mistake in Dutch history&#8221;.</p>
<p>The results come from the History Monitor. This survey was carried out among a representative group of 1,069 people by De Volkskrant newspaper, Historisch Nieuwsblad history journal and TV programme Andere Tijden in consultation with history professors James Kennedy, Niek van Sas and Hans Blom.</p>
<p>The History Monitor presented 20 multiple-choice questions on Dutch history and identity. Only for six questions did over 60 percent know the right answer. The worst answered was the question &lsquo;Since which century has the Netherlands been a kingdom&rsquo;; only 17 percent knew the Netherlands was a republic before the 19th century.</p>
<p>Also remarkable is the self-criticism on the Netherlands&rsquo; slavery past. Only 21 percent correctly gave the Netherlands a 5 percent share in the world slave trade; the rest estimated a higher share. The researchers attribute the overestimating to a feeling of shame, born of structural and years-long media attention for the dark sides of the dominant role the Netherlands played in the world in the 17th century.</p>
<p>All in all, the average Dutch respondent scored 5.2 for national historical knowledge. Immigrants scored 4.9 percent on average. The over 65s averaged 6.0; conversely, the 16-34 age group averaged just 4.4.<br>

					<p>Just another example of the Left&rsquo;s Gramcian Long March through the institutions.  It was recently reported that <span class="caps">MLK </span>was the most widely known American. Great!  Holland has little to be ashamed of collectively and nothing as Dutch individuals.  Even by the standards of radicalized Enlightenment, Holland was a beacon of free-speech and religious tolerance as far back as the seventeeth century.  And now they hang their heads in shame because of Leftist educational brainwashing.</p>

					<p>Well, if the Dutch people get up the nerve to throw out the Muslims, <span class="caps">HISTORY WILL AGAIN COME ALIVE. </span></p>
<p>In other words, history feels &#8220;dead&#8221; to the Dutch because they no longer control their own destiny. If the Dutch are able to throw out the Muslims, there will be <span class="caps">NEW </span>stories to tell, a <span class="caps">NEW </span>history to remember, not an ancient history from years gone past. </p>

Only Socialist indoctrination would have smart yet naive Europeans believe they could live harmoniously within the same borders of a second race with a lower aptitude.<br><br>

					<p>Go ahead and throw the Muslims out, Dutchmen.  What then?  Back to your opium dens and brain destroying socialist nanny state?  The presence of large numbers of belligerent aliens in your midst is merely the symptom of a greater internal rot which has been underway for many decades.  It has now metastasized and threatens to destroy you.  Even if you survive, you may have to amputate a limb or two.  Good luck.</p>

					<p>The reason that &#8220;nothing is done&#8221; about it, as pointed out above, is that it is a core of modern egalitarianism, a lie made a truth by repetition that multiculturalism is vital, all races are the same, all cultures have equal value, etc.  Democracy has failed and will always fail when the voting public has actively been lied to and conditioned to automatically dismiss critical issues, such as those regarding race and culture as racist, and the speakers less than human.  Two party regimes (of which the US is one) will have zero change in their willingness to commit cultural and genetic suicide while this sorry state persists.</p>

					<p>As we now know all races are certainly not the same, neither are all cultures. The marxists failed in to oppose their ideology through economics ( planned economies managed by a centralized bureaucracy have been a total failure) so now they are attempting to impose their ideology through historical revsionism and corruption of the social sciences. We are not all the same, where have most of the great scientific and technological breakthroughs come from? </p>
<p>Unfortunately for the left it appears that the citizens of western societies and nations are beginning to wake up. That is of course with the exclusion of the population of the united states, which has been lulled into a deep sleep by the narcotic effects of easy credit and deficit spending. However, I beleive the other shoe is about to drop for the US economy. The fed has done all the <span class="caps">WRONG </span>things to avert the eventual collapse of our economnic institutions in its effort to rescue the big banks and investment houses. They have now gone so far as to open the discount window to investment banks like Bear Stearns, an unprecdented action. Prior to the repeal of the Glass Steagall act by Bill Clinton the activities of investment banks and savings banks were kept strictly seperated. This act separated the activities of investment and regular banking institutions to prevent the type of speculative activities that helped to bring about the great deperssion. As you can see by the present mess our economy is in the repeal of this act was a huge mistake, which has been magnified by the bail out of the investment banks like Bear Stearns. It should also be noted that prior to the repeal of this act most mortgage loans were handled by savings banks or savings and loan institutions where they originated. It was the repeal of this act that allowed the mortgage originators to bundle their risky loans together into investment vehicles and sell them to invetors like Bear Stearns. This allowed them to originate very risky loans to borrowers with poor credit, many of whom were <span class="caps">ILLEGAL ALIENS </span>who had no credit history and pass the risk along to someone else. </p>
<p>The obvious question that presents itself is how did the supposedly bright and well educated managers at these investment banks not see this coming?</p>
<p>The answer is that our financial elites, like political elites do not care about this country or it&rsquo;s people. Our financial elites, like most of our poltical elites, all attend the same exclusive ivy league schools where these attitudes and beliefs are reinforced.</p>
<p>I used to work with a fellow whose father was a very prominent physician and had sent him to a very exclusive prep school on the east coast for his education. He told me that almost all of the people he attended school with looked looked down their nose at the average US citizen. They saw their fellow citizens not as their fellow countrymen, but as someone to be exploited and taken advantage of. Given these attitudes is it any wonder that we have out of control illegal immigration, a collapsing economy and all the other problems our country is confronted with?</p>

					<p>&#8220;All in all, the average Dutch respondent scored 5.2 for national historical knowledge&hellip;&#8221;  This was necessary so that the Dutch could be tricked into allowing all these non-white invaders into their own country. This was intentional.</p>
<p>Coincidence that all white nations are being &#8220;dumbed down&#8221; at the very same time? All white nations are having massive non-white invasions at the very same time, for the same reasons, with the same excuses? Ever wonder why?</p>
<p>Now the <span class="caps">ONLY </span>solution will be something very unpleasant since only by making the residency of these non-whites unpleasant will they leave. </p>
<p>Would you ever leave a white nation to go back to a Black nation? Even blacks aren&rsquo;t that stupid.</p>

I agree very much with <span class="caps">ODDL&rsquo;</span>s excellent post!  But, oddly enough, you are right too. The strange, Orwellian  thing here is that all cultures supposedly have the  same value, so we are told    &mdash;   except that of whites. </p>
<p>Thus, while all cultures (and peoples) are equal,  there is one  that is less equal than the others. (Guess who?)   Meanwhile,  all  non-white cultures are more equal than the whites to whom they are equal.</p>
<p>Your mistake is in trying to be logical about this. </p>

					<p>It&rsquo;s funny to see all these Americans making snide remarks about the Netherlands.  The racial situation there is nowhere near as bad there as it is in the US and the political situation is much better too.  They actually have nationally prominent politicians speaking up for white interests.  A majority of the population takes the same view of immigration that white nationalists do.  What percentage of Americans would say that third world immigration is the biggest mistake in the country&rsquo;s history?  Maybe 1% or 2% at most.  Probably 90% would say slavery and segregation.  </p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have opium dens either.  Marijuana use rates are <span class="caps">HALF </span>of the American rate and for harder drugs are much less than that.  America has the biggest drug problem of any industrialized country by far.  Those who live in glass houses shouldn&rsquo;t throw stones.  </p>
<p>The nanny state is a lot less brain destroying than the Television/Walmart state we have in the US if the racial awareness of the population of the Netherlands is any measure.<br>

					<p>An exellent example of the results of the application of the Frankfurt school of cultural Marxism. First denude a people of their history and identitiy. Then teach them that they are bad and racist. Then import millions of cultural aliens to destroy the already weakened social fabric. Use the all pervasive media and entertainment industry to dull the intellect and pare down the language. Encourage a corrosive social enviroment with femininazis, gay rights advocates, mocking of the traditional sexual and moral mores of the population. Presto! One more Western nation gone. Transformed into multicultural hell hole governed by the tyrannical dead hand of Goverment. </p>

					<p>Bravo, thanks for that clarification on Netherlands culture.<br>
Agreed our Walmart/Hollywood/TV dominated culture is a national disgrace for which far more people should be ashamed than acutally are. I do think however that there is a large hidden majority of Americans who think that 3rd world immigration is exactly what will destroy this country.</p>

					<p>Is this really news?  Significant majorities have consistently reported that there is &#8220;too much immigration,&#8221; which is really code-speak that there are too many non-whites.  Perhaps this is different since it&rsquo;s being called the country&rsquo;s greatest ever mistake.  </p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see if anything actually gets <i>done</i> about it, though.  The problem with lefties and elites is that the more you dislike immigration, the more adamant they are that you must have it; &#8220;I <i>hate</i> immigration&#8221; leads to &#8220;Why, I&rsquo;ll show you, you racist bastards: <i>here</i>, take these 10,000 Somalis in your small town for your insolence!&#8221; Complaining about immigration creates a vicious circle in which your complaints anger the anti-racist leftie who, outraged at your racism, dumps more immigrants on you, which hardens your racism and leads you to complain more, which infuriates the leftie and has him scouring the earth for the most wretched immigrants he can dump on you, which&hellip; etc.</p>

					<p>&#8220;Black or white Americans?&#8221;<br>

Exactly! That&rsquo;s what it boils down to.  This is really an essential question that has to be asked in so many situations.  </p>
<p>Whether discussing crime, illegitimacy, venereal disease, academic achievement, juvenile delinquency,  school dropouts, life expectancy, credit worthiness, deadbeat dads, and on and on &hellip;. America is really two very different nations, black and white.  </p>
<p>It is deceptive and dishonest for our government to pretend constantly that we are all one.</p>

					<p>Not only is mass immigration not economically beneficial, but appears to go hand-in-hand with a decline in knowledge of one&rsquo;s own country and it&rsquo;s history, culture, and literature.</p>
<p><i>The problem with lefties and elites is that the more you dislike immigration, the more adamant they are that you must have it; &ldquo;I hate immigration&rdquo; leads to &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;ll show you, you racists: here, take these 10,000 Somalis in your small town for your insolence!&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not far from the truth. Every time the people complain about too much immigration we end up getting more - Congress raises the visa limits, reduces enforcement, whatever. Right now there are two proposals in Congress to triple the number of <span class="caps">H1B </span>visas from 65,000 to nearly 200,000. It will almost surely pass, during this presidential administration or the next. Ironically I have resorted to cheering for an even deeper recession with the hope that Americans will finally wake up to the problem.</p>

					<p>Who thinks the Dutch would feel that way if the mass immigration they permitted was composed strictly of Afrikaners and ethnic Dutchmen from the Hudson Valley, Indonesia, Aruba, and other former colonies?</p>

					<p>The mass immigration of Muslims is the product of the greed of Dutch businessmen. It is the inevitable result of seeking first the kingdom of Mammon, putting short term profit above long term stability and social cohesion.</p>

<p>While our mighty navy and air force stand guard, armed with supersonic airplanes, nuclear submarines, and every sort of advanced technology known to man, in order to fend off any potential military threat (though there are none),  the  unending trickle of hotel maids, kitchen help, &#8220;tourists&#8221;, and students&#8221; continues to pour in through the cracks, unnoticed by our authorities.  And that trickle has  by now become a flood!  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, those same &#8220;authorities&#8221; see no problem and enjoy the cheap labor   &mdash;  - while it lasts.</p>
<p>History will record us as a nation sold out by its own blind and  greedy &#8220;leaders&#8221;. </p>
