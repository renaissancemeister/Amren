						<p>A federal Judge on Tuesday dismissed a lawsuit challenging Proposal 2, a state law that bans preferential treatment based on race or gender in government hiring and university admissions.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge David Lawson&rsquo;s ruling upholds the constitutionality of the measure Michigan voters approved in 2006.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the demonstration of a discriminatory purpose that (dooms the plaintiffs&rsquo;) argument, since the plaintiffs must show that Proposal 2 was enacted &#8220;because of, not merely in spite of, its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Court cannot say that the only purpose of Proposal 2 is to discriminate against minorities,&#8221; Lawson wrote.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The pro-affirmative action organization By Any Means Necessary, which brought the lawsuit along with the American Civil Liberties Union, has vowed to appeal.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is racially targeted legislation of the worst kind,&#8221; said George Washington, an attorney for BAMN who has argued that the measure was designed to exclude black, Latino and Native American students from higher educational opportunities. &#8220;To uphold this law without giving black students a trial is adding insult to injury.&#8221;<br>

					<p> Apparently the motto of By Any Means Necessary is &#8220;Fifty-eight percent of the people be damned.&#8221; Their name should have been &#8220;By Any Means, Fair Or Foul.&#8221; The blind arrogance of the left was never displayed so brazenly as in the statements made by <span class="caps">BAMN </span>all during the fight over this issue in Michigan.</p>
<p> They can take it all the way to the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> Supreme Court if they want to, but this is one I think they&rsquo;re going to lose, big time.</p>
<p> By the way, was that attorney&rsquo;s name given correctly? George Washington?! I&rsquo;d like to see a picture of him; bet he&rsquo;s no kin to the Father of Our Country.</p>

					<p>Now the voters in Michigan need to pass a law against &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo; in the private sector. </p>

					<p>All I could do was laugh out loud when I read what this fool said -  &#8220;This is racially targeted legislation of the worst kind,&#8221; said George Washington, an attorney for <span class="caps">BAMN </span>who has argued that the measure was designed to exclude black, Latino and Native American students from higher educational opportunities. &#8220;To uphold this law without giving black students a trial is adding insult to injury.&#8221; </p>
<p>They may do a lot of whining but they can never demonstrate how judging all students based on their individual merits like academic performance could possibly be racist in nature unless they are going to admit that blacks are mentally inferior. Are they willing to admit that finally? This legislation was &#8220;designed&#8221; to ensure fairness to all students. Could this clown have a more ironic name?<br>

					<p>This is what happens when conservative presidents like Bush get to choose Federal Judges.   Gore or Kerry would never appoint judges like this one.  Does anyone think Barack Obama will appoint these kind of judges?</p>

					<p>The American Civil Liberties Union doesn&rsquo;t seem to understand the concept of civil liberties. I wonder what they think their mission is. To make noise? To support whacko organizations like &#8220;By Any Means Necessary&#8221;?</p>

					<p>&#8220;The American Civil Liberties Union doesn&rsquo;t seem to understand the concept of civil liberties.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sure they understand. Liberty equals slavery. Freedom equals coercion, ignorance equals power.</p>

					<p>Affirmative Action only serves to further isolate the races. It not only created hostility but insured that minorities have no need or desire to improve themselves. That goes a long way towards supporting the fact that most minorities are low income. Government programs are designed to keep minorities out of the main stream work force. On the surface affirmative action looks like it helps minorities. But frankly it does more harm than good at all levels. For example who wants a doctor or lawyer that is given the easy road to a license? While I am definitely not a fan of President lincoln, his only good remark was in the Gettysburg Address. &#8220;All men are created equal&#8221;. Too bad minorities fail to see the logic in that.</p>

					<p>I would support &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo; if it was based on equal treatment, that is, blacks and hispanics who can actually <span class="caps">PASS </span>the same tests as whites would get equal treatment according to thier population numbers based on local racial statistics, </p>
<p><span class="caps">BUT </span>affirmative action based on <span class="caps">EQUALITY </span>does not work for them, as blacks and hispanics (but mysteriously <span class="caps">NOT </span>asians) cannot <span class="caps">PASS </span>the same tests. </p>
<p>This is the same old tired truth, so old and tired the liberals know it by heart, and dont even attend Jared Taylor&rsquo;s confrence on race.<br>
