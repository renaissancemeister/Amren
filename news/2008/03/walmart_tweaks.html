<p>Boxes of the date-filled, whole wheat cookie from the Middle East welcomed the 21-year-old Lebanon native into the international aisle of the new Wal-Mart store in this Detroit suburb known as the capital of Arab America. Aisle 3, which also features Eastern European and Hispanic food, represents many of the 550 items geared toward Arab-American shoppers in the store that opened last week.</p>
<p>It might be statistically tiny in a store with more than 150,000 items, but it&rsquo;s symbolically huge for the world&rsquo;s largest retailer as it seeks to change from a cost-is-everything monolith to one that customizes its stores to meet neighborhood needs.</p>
<p>Managers say they seek peace with the neighborhood&rsquo;s merchants &mdash; and vow not to undercut them on Middle Eastern specialties. But some experts and observers say Wal-Mart&rsquo;s well-planned launch in Dearborn is bound to shake up the buying and selling in a community that has long supported its own. Southeastern Michigan is home to an estimated 300,000 people who trace their roots to the Middle East.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Dearborn store also sells Arabic music and plans to offer Muslim greeting cards. But the modifications go beyond merchandise: It has 35 employees who speak Arabic &mdash; noted in Arabic script on their badges. The store also has hired a local Arab-American educator to teach the staff cultural sensitivity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear as soon as shoppers walk in that this isn&rsquo;t a typical Wal-Mart. Inside the grocery entrance are 22 produce tables filled with squash, beans and cucumbers common in Middle Eastern dishes. The section also features grains and vegetables popular among blacks and Hispanics, two other demographics with sizable populations living nearby.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>More than a year of studying the market and meeting with community groups was put to the test last fall, when Bartell and a Tut&rsquo;s executive began to work on what would become aisle 3. They set up an 80-foot-long counter in an empty warehouse and hauled out products &mdash; date-filled cookies, grape leaves, vacuum-packed olives, chick peas and a 97-ounce jar of olive oil imported from the Middle East. The men spent two weeks working on a way to present a new line of products.</p>
<p>As he recalled their effort, a few women in hijabs &mdash; traditional Muslim head scarves &mdash; inspected produce. One spoke in Arabic to Mohamad Atwi, the developmental store manager.</p>
<p>Bartell said the store aims to offer convenience &mdash; not a comprehensive selection of specialty products.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the Super Greenland Market, which Wal-Mart studied to come up with its new store, customers can find one whole side of an aisle with more than 20 different varieties of chick peas and fava beans.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Still, the lure of everything under one roof could prove stronger than product depth for some who frequent Middle Eastern shops.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Dearborn Wal-Mart is part of a two-year-old corporate effort to help sales by tailoring stores to local demographics, said spokeswoman Amy Wyatt-Moore at Wal-Mart&rsquo;s Bentonville, Ark., headquarters. It targeted six groups: Hispanics, blacks, empty-nesters/boomers, affluent, suburban and rural shoppers.</p>
<p>Dearborn&rsquo;s store is designed to reflect its neighborhood, not serve as a national template for Arab-American shoppers, she said.</p>

			<p>Who cares?  Walmart is just doing what they do everywhere, selling products to the community.  </p>
<p>Walmart is not in charge of or responsible for our immigration policy or lack of border control.  Walmart did not concoct our affirmative action laws. </p>
<p>While it gauls me to walk into a Walmart and see bilingual signs, it is best to focus on the real enemy: White marxists.</p>

			<p>I can&rsquo;t stand Wal-Mart or anything it stands for&hellip;  </p>
<p>Whatever happened to the good old days when Americans in America could simply buy American-made products?</p>
<p>This is all thanks to our globalist elite traitors in office who sold America out all for the sake of cheap labor and cheap votes!</p>
<p>Clearly, this &#8220;globalization plan&#8221; is destroying America as we know it; but yet, our &#8220;representatives&#8221; continue to push for MORE free trade, MORE cheap labor, the TTC, the SPP, the NAU and then eventually the TEC (a new Trans-Atlantic trade deal with the EU)&hellip;  </p>
<p>All of this greatly enhances the wealth of the top 1 percent (our globalist politicians and corporations) to the complete detriment of all Americans.</p>
<p>And who do we have to vote for?  McCain?  Clinton?  Obama?  What a JOKE!  This political system is rigged to let us suckers think that we still have a voice&hellip;  Unfortunately, all of these candidates were selected by our &#8220;international&#8221; corporations; and none of these candidates will protect America or the American people!</p>
<p>This is truly a sad time for America&hellip;<br>

			<p>No, white capitalists have done far more damage than &#8220;marxists.&#8221;</p>
<p>Walmart and all of corporate America are responsible for the demographic transformation of this country.  Who do you think gives money to politicians so that they won&rsquo;t enforce immigration law?  Who lobbies for more immigration?  It&rsquo;s not &#8220;marxists.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Flamethrower is right.  There is nothing wrong with Walmart catering to the local community and we certainly have bigger fish to fry than worrying about what Walmart stocks their isles with.  On another note, ethnic diversity is, overall, a bad thing - but it certainly doesn&rsquo;t hurt to try something new once in a while when it comes to cuisine.  Pick up something that looks interesting while you&rsquo;re there.  Who knows, you might like it.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re not really marxists, marxism was actually &#8216;discredited&rsquo; in the eyes of the world right according to plan, they&rsquo;re really just citizens afraid to take any other course of action. In other words, they&rsquo;re just following directions they&rsquo;ve been given.<br>

			<p>This is just Walmart doing what they do best. Selling merchandise to mindless buyers whose only interest is in getting what They Want at the lowest possible price without regard as to how their purchase impacts anyone else in the United States. Someday and soon the chicken will come home to roost. I hope you enjoy your new minimum wage job when America treats your job the same way.</p>

			<p>I would imagine that if some dirty rotten scoundrels were to repeatedly shoot out all of Wal-Mar&rsquo;s expensive plate glass windows when the store was closed it might inspire them to stop pandering to our enemies.  Those security cameras are cheap ones with poor resolution and they are essentially useless especially at night&hellip;</p>

			<p>What about this &#8220;melting pot&#8221; and assimilation they always tell us about? Aren&rsquo;t we all supposed to become &#8220;American&#8221;? What does that mean? Oh, we are all the same&hellip;but diverse&hellip;equal, but multicultural&hellip;.no difference&hellip;.but different&hellip;.</p>
<p>Anyway, I just got back from Saudi Arabia and enjoyed the American neighborhood in Mecca. The Methodist Church was great and I enjoyed a cold beer and ham sandwich at the &#8220;All American Cafe&#8221; on Nassar Blvd. I am so happy the world has embraced tolerance and diversity. We can all get along&hellip;.</p>
<p>Notice, for some reason, it is only the WHITE RACE that must tolerate, enjoy diversity, accept, understand and take in millions upon millions of others? Ever wonder why?</p>

<p>Jewamongyou and Flamethrower are WRONG. </p>
<p>In case you guys haven&rsquo;t noticed it&rsquo;s the Wall Street Journal and people like Alan Greenspan and Bill Gates who are demanding that our borders come down, not &#8220;White marxists.&#8221; </p>
<p>Do you really think that &#8220;White marxists&#8221; have more power and control over our lives than the WSJ, Alan Greenspan, and Bill Gates do?</p>
<p>You two better think about that. Or you could always just go hang around the &#8220;conservatives,&#8221; who clearly haven&rsquo;t figured out yet that capitalism has absolutely nothing to do with conservatism. </p>
<p>In fact, capitalism is by its very nature &hellip; ANTI-CONSERVATIVE!!! </p>

			<p>Walmart sucks!!   Mr. Sam Walton was a Christian during his life here on Earth.  I think he would roll over in his grave if he knew how his company was being run.  I honestly don&rsquo;t think Mr Walton would put up with this diversity garbage if he were still here today.  <br>
Walmart was a pretty good company when he was still alive.  It goes to show you when businesses get too big for their britches, the company goes downhill.</p>

			<p>Since visiting Detroit is at the top of my &#8220;To Don&rsquo;t List&#8221;, I regard this as a non-issue.</p>
<p>I still shop at Wal Mart, mainly in the interest of saving money, but also because within two miles of me, a Safeway, two Alberson&rsquo;s and two Long&rsquo;s Drugs have closed down in the last 18 months.  The talking heads like to speculate as to whether we will have a recession, but that&rsquo;s obviously already here.  Whether we will have a depression seems the operative question to me.</p>
<p>A former research chemist with 79 US and foreign patents and dozens of articles published in peer-reviewed journals, I am now taking welding classes at the local community college in the hope of getting work in the oil and gas industry out on Colorado&rsquo;s eastern plains.  Not suprisingly, the petroleum industry is doing very well, even though the microelectronics industry here has completely tanked, with even Intel scheduled to pull out.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t blame Wal Mart for everything.  They sell the same Chinese-made running shoes as Famous Footware, and the same Japanese and Korean-made electronics as Best Buy.</p>

			<p>  Even into the early seventies our s/w Georgia town(pop-4to5000), 72% black, had a half dozen grocery stores, three pharmacies, three hardware stores, a general store, a drygoods store, a half dozen clothing stores,two dry cleaners,three auto dealerships, a Western Auto, a couple of furniture stores, two veneer mills, a sprawling lumber yard, of course many service stations and cafes,a Coca-Cola plant,a fully staffed hospital(my brother had his appendix taken out there in &#8216;58),dryers and silos for agricultural products, all either on the town square or within walking distance of it . Each tinier community in the county would have a club house at which get-togethers could be held; dances,parties, dove, quail and fish fries, peanut boils . As a 6 year old white kid in the 50s I could leave the theater on Saturday, walk the two miles home through a teeming crowd 90% black, through black neighborhoods and no one was going to lay a hand on me .95% of the citizenry, black and white, were employed by the local economy,nearly all privately owned- few chains . Go there now, deadsville, service oriented offices and second hand stores . Most if they have a job, work out of town .The chains are part to blame, but curiously the decline also seems to be connected to the first serious implementation of Brown versus Board in 1970 . We&rsquo;ve lost something .   </p>
