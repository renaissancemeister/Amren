						<p>At least one in four teenage girls nationwide has a sexually transmitted disease, or more than 3 million teens, according to the first study of its kind in this age group.</p>
<p>A virus that causes cervical cancer is by far the most common sexually transmitted infection in teen girls aged 14 to 19, while the highest overall prevalence is among black girls &mdash; nearly half the blacks studied had at least one STD. That rate compared with 20 percent among both whites and Mexican-American teens, the study from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found.</p>
<p>About half of the girls acknowledged ever having sex; among them, the rate was 40 percent. While some teens define sex as only intercourse, other types of intimate behavior including oral sex can spread some infections.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The study by CDC researcher Dr. Sara Forhan is an analysis of nationally representative data on 838 girls who participated in a 2003-04 government health survey. Teens were tested for four infections: human papillomavirus, or HPV, which can cause cervical cancer and affected 18 percent of girls studied; chlamydia, which affected 4 percent; trichomoniasis, 2.5 percent; and herpes simplex virus, 2 percent.</p>
<p>Blythe said the results are similar to previous studies examining rates of those diseases individually.</p>
<p>The results were prepared for release Tuesday at a CDC conference in Chicago on preventing sexually transmitted diseases.</p>

			<p>Doesn&rsquo;t surprise me in the slightest.  Blacks are extremely reckless and careless, hence they have sex with no protection.</p>
<p>Secondly, they are much more primitive and hypersexual.  Thus, they begin sexual activity at a MUCH younger age than other races.  Blacks have sex even before puberty.  Black males begin chasing females extremely aggressively at a young age while the females are very loose and have many sexual partners as soon as they can.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, for whites, what this translates into is welfare payments for hordes of illegitimate children and rape victims at the hands of Black males.  </p>

			<p>While I believe the racial rankings (blacks are more likely to have STDs than whites, because of black promiscuity), I doubt that the overall infection rate is that high.  We found out that UN AIDS officials have been fibbing about infection rates in the upward direction, to create a much bigger problem than reality in order to garner more funding.  I get the feeling that these CDC numbers are also fudged upward for the same reason.</p>

&#8220;High STD rates among young women, particularly African-American young women, are clear signs that we must continue developing ways to reach those most at risk,&#8221; Douglas said.&#8221;<br>
___________</p>
<p>Good luck.  Unless it involves BLING BLING give aways, you&rsquo;ll never reach that audience.  Blacks are so suspicious of medicine (that whitey voodoo), they&rsquo;ll never get the vaccine.  This is the same group who believes AIDS was invented in a government lab targeted specifically for them.  </p>

			<p>In another article I read, there was the following explanation given for the racial disparity by the lead CDC researcher:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Race itself is not a risk factor for STDs, Forhan said. However, factors such as limited access to health care, poverty, community prevalence of STDs, and misperceptions about individual risk are some of the reasons that STD rates are particularly high among African-Americans, she said.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>http://health.usnews.com/usnews/health/healthday/080311/one-in-4-teen-girls-has-a-sexually-transmitted-disease.htm</p>
<p>Race itself is not a factor - right.  What could it possibly mean for it to be a risk factor?  Aren&rsquo;t STD&rsquo;s by definition diseases that one transmits through sex?  What other risk factors are there besides sexual behavior?</p>
<p>Poverty and &#8220;access&#8221; to health care are even more absurd.  Neither that article nor this one bothers to investigate, in that light, why Hispanics, even poorer and less able to access health care, have a rate comparable to that of whites.</p>
<p>Community prevalence just begs the question - STDs are prevalent among blacks because STDs are prevalent among blacks.  </p>
<p>And finally misperception about individual risk, the logic of which is a bit circular as well.  That is, blacks wrongly perceive themselves to be not at risk, which leads to a high rate of STDs &hellip; but, it is the high rate of STDs which presumably underlies the misperception of the risk in the first place.  </p>
<p>The truth is none of these factors has much or any explanatory power, but I am sure other posters here will be happy to say what Ms. Forhan could or would not.</p>

			<p>One of the favorite accusations among Black women, is to accuse White women of being easy, which is more than ironic when you look at the staggeringly high amount of STD&rsquo;s and out of wedlock births among Black women. Many of them do tend to do a lot of projecting it seems.</p>

			<p>This is why National Health Care will be a disaster. </p>
<p>Healthy whites are going to be lumped into a pool with non-healthy groups who have higher rates of disease and social pathology. </p>
<p>Whites should demand the ability to &#8220;opt out&#8221; of any National Health Care system. </p>

			<p>As an aside, I did a parody story awhile back.  Applying it to this story, then Morris Dees should sue all these STDs for civil rights violations, because the viruses chose to affect black girls and women more frequently than other races.</p>

			<p>This is news? The only thing they have wrong is that Black men and women have the highest rate of STD&rsquo;s and it is more like 80% of their population.The Whites who have it more than likely have had sex with a black man somewhere down the line&hellip;.</p>

			<p>When I graduated from high school in 1980 I recall hearing on the news a statistic that 25% of boys and girls in high school ever had sexual intercourse.  In the 90&rsquo;s I read that the average high schooler had had an average of four sexual partners -  a huge increase from 15 years earlier.  </p>
<p>Most the VD infections cited in the study seem to be venereal warts which is tougher to get rid of for a girl.  I think what is happening is that in many cases these young girls are having sex with the local big stud who is in turn spreading his VD to all of them.  I indirectly knew a black basketball player at the University of Michigan and I think he gave warts to about half of the overweight white girls in Ann Arbor.  I noticed this pattern with another guy who was sort of a friend and supposedly a big stud.  He had sex with many dozens of girls and women and he also had warts (a girl I knew got them from him).  </p>
<p>Men who spread these diseases don&rsquo;t give a damn about what they doing to others.  They just want to get laid.  The girls are dupes for having sex with these jerks.  It is too bad people in general don&rsquo;t have better judgement.  If you have a daughter you need to talk to her about this sort of health menace.</p>

			<p>And the Media tells us Sexual Promiscuity is good! Anybody who condemns a woman, for &#8220;sleeping around,&#8221; is deemed a bigot, by today&rsquo;s standards. &#8220;How dare you look down on blonde Jane, for sleeping with Jamal and all of his homies?!&#8221;</p>
<p>I also think this study underestimates it. I think the rates for White females (at least) is much, much higher. I believe more than 1 in 5 White females has at least one VD.</p>

			<p>Do you honestly think that race matters? It is a known fact that a person&rsquo;s skin color is determined by the amount of melanin in their bodies. It has NOTHING to do with &#8220;race&#8221; but everything to do with the amount of melanin. A &#8220;white&#8221; person goes to the tanning bed and gets darker&hellip;their melanin levels have increased&hellip;there&rsquo;s your racial superiority right there. I guess now you will be doing an article on the evils of whites using tanning beds..we&rsquo;ll all turn black!</p>

			<p>I believe non Whites have adapted to this virus and/or have built up some kind of immunity from their lifestyles.<br>
Non Whites are less likely to die from HIV/AIDs when infected than Whites who are infected. Certain species of primates in Africa were plagued by an STD similar to AIDs and although some died, some lived a fairly normal lifestyle with the virus.</p>
<p>If such is the case, the virus could be an impassible barrier to miscagenation and serve to highlight racial/genetic differences. A sexually trnsmitted virus stabilizing in non whites and fatal to Whites,would mean the interracial sex is suicidal. No liberals would be able to deny race exists, because of the nature of the disease.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve clearly missed the point. No one has maintained that melanin is related to anything. Race is a great deal more than melanin; it is a genetic reality and correlates both with behavior (in this case, sexual promiscuity) and susceptibility to diseases. If &#8220;race doesn&rsquo;t matter,&#8221; kindly explain the results of this study.</p>

			<p>Here is the data I want to see: Average number of lifetime sexual partners among sexually active females age 18, broken down by race.  I&rsquo;ll bet those numbers would explain this study with no further information necessary.  Black females are MUCH more promiscuous that white females; they start earlier and have much fewer qualms about sleeping with multiple males.  By the time they reach 18, many already have more notches in their bedposts that a Vegas cocktail waitress.  </p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll never see that study published, however, for obvious reasons.  Instead you have to look at the types of studies that talk around the subject.  For instance, this study of promiscuity by musical tastes, correlated by crime statistics (which are well documented by race):   </p>

			<p>Whenever blacks and hispanics are added into statistics for these types of surveys the results are always to the negative, as in educational surveys, etc., most certainly in sexual surveys, as the blacks, hispanics began at an earlier age, have more partners, and disregard personal hygiene.</p>

			<p>A poster above (12:31 AM March 12) makes a very interesting point.</p>
<p>If these people are getting &#8220;normal&#8221; sexually transmitted diseases as teenagers, what&rsquo;s to stop them from getting HIV the same way? HIV could find its way down into younger and younger age groups.</p>
<p>So, this story has an ominous feeling to it, even if the numbers are exaggerated.</p>

<p>You can go to a tanning bed all you want but it will never change your genetic type; you will just be a white person with darker skin.  If you think racial differences are confined to the amount of melanin in someone&rsquo;s skin then you are sorely mistaken. Please go read a book.</p>

			<p>At least one in four teenage girls nationwide has a sexually transmitted disease&hellip;while the highest overall prevalence is among black girls &mdash; nearly half the blacks studied had at least one STD&hellip;that rate compared with 20 percent among both whites and Mexican-American teens&hellip;</p>
<p>Given the sexual appetite of blacks I am NOT surprised!&hellip;I AM surprised that the rate is so low for HISPANIC girls though!&hellip;and surprised that our WHITE girls have a rate that high!&hellip;of the WHITE girls who are infected&hellip;I wonder who they have sex with&hellip;black boys?&hellip;Hispanic boys?&hellip;we just got the news here in San Antonio that OUR rates of disease among OUR teen population is even HIGHER than the nationwide average!..with the rates higher in certain sections of the city..I would BET that the rate is HIGHER among the HISPANICS down here!&hellip;does anyone notice that this study was not conducted on ILLEGALS who have come over from THIRD-WORLD countries?&hellip;wonder what the rate among THEM is!&hellip;being that this study was done 2003-04&hellip;I would BET that the rate has gone even HIGHER!&hellip;those figures are probably a VERY conservative figure!</p>
<p>About half of the girls acknowledged ever having sex; among them, the rate was 40 percent&hellip;</p>
<p>I have to wonder how many of these girls have sex on a regular basis and how many of the girls made one mistake with the WRONG (and infected) boy and now have a disease that will haunt them for the rest of their lives both EMOTIONALLY and PHYSICALLY!</p>
<p>Some teens define sex as only intercourse, other types of intimate behavior including oral sex can spread some infections&hellip;</p>
<p>Hear that BILL CLINTON?&hellip;YOU are to THANK for this!&hellip;YOU have given our children the FALSE idea that oral sex ISN&rsquo;T sex and ISN&rsquo;T dangerous because of YOUR infidelity, LOOSE/NO morals&hellip;and LYING!</p>
<p>What I want to know is how many teenage BOYS are walking around with these diseases?&hellip;the girls got them from the BOYS!&hellip;why is there no corresponding study on the males being done?</p>
<p>The results were prepared for release Tuesday at a CDC conference in Chicago on preventing sexually transmitted diseases&hellip;</p>
<p>Preventing sexually transmitted diseases starts AT HOME!&hellip;parents need to talk to their children&hellip;religion needs to become a part of family life again&hellip;following the ten commandments is a good start!&hellip;not giving children the message that they can do anything they want to&hellip;the mantra seems to be&hellip;if it feels good do it!&hellip;the parents, sports figures, entertainers, politicians and teachers need to start setting a GOOD example for our kids!&hellip;making HEROES out of people who have NO MORALS is another problem!&hellip;BILL CLINTON cheated on his WIFE!&hellip;BRAD PITT cheated on his WIFE!&hellip;ANGELINA and BRAD are expecting ANOTHER illegitimate child!&hellip;while their child is adorable&hellip;they are sending an inappropriate message to our children!&hellip;schools passing out condoms&hellip;classes for and daycare for pregnant teens on campus are also CONTRIBUTING to this problem!&hellip;and the state of California is telling parents that they have no &#8220;right&#8221; to homeschool their children because the kids are &#8220;missing out on interaction with other kids and missing out on the school experience&#8221;!&hellip;THIS is the &#8220;experience&#8221; the state wants for the kids?&hellip;</p>

			<p>This reminds me of an incident I experienced on a metro bus here in downtown Seattle.</p>
<p>A sort of stylized black hoodlum-ish kid (around 18-19) got on the bus and sat down near the back. A couple minutes later he moved to the middle of the bus to the seats opposite each other, against the bus walls. My guess was that he noticed an attractive white, business-clad 20s-30s something lady talking on her cell phone. </p>
<p>As soon as she rung off he immediately tried to make small talk with her which I pretty much expected, being a practicing race-realist myself. I then listened to my headphones for a bit but, out of curiosity, decided to pause it to inconspicuously see how much &#8220;further&#8221; this conversation went (he was doing most of the talking). </p>
<p>And, I kid you not, it was only a few minutes into their conversation that this black kid, in his own colorful way, was already asking to sleep with her. He was promising her &#8220;good times&#8221;, teasing her a bit, and saying he&rsquo;s &#8220;been around&#8221;. She was chuckling slightly but it was probably out of sheer embarrasement, not just for her but for all of us in that part of the bus. And I&rsquo;m sure she &#8220;Oh my God&#8221;ed all the way home. </p>
<p>That behavior seems beyound Promiscuity. <br>

			<p>&#8220;This is why National Health Care will be a disaster. </p>
<p>Healthy whites are going to be lumped into a pool with non-healthy groups who have higher rates of disease and social pathology. </p>
<p>Whites should demand the ability to &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; of any National Health Care system. &#8220;</p>
<p>Posted by at 7:14 PM on March 11 </p>
<p>&gt; I must respectfully disagree with you on all counts.  You already pay for their health care either through welfare/medical programs and private insurance also averages costs when figuring premiums for everyone.  A national health program would standardize the uneven mess we have now that doesn&rsquo;t serve the middle-class well, but rather exploits it.</p>
<p>Opting out infers refusing a program and that may be an option just as some people never go to a doctor and treat their sickness and disease with folk remedies or Christian Science beleif based cures.  But you will still have to pay the same amount of tax as most programs paid for more often come from the general fund.</p>
<p>The one hopeful point not mentioned in this story is that HPV often causes sterility.  This might reduce the population of sexually overactive and miscegenating individuals in the longer run.</p>

			<p>&#8220;What is to prevent them from getting AIDS the same way?&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Reader 1.</p>
<p>Good point.  Actually, the presence of other, untreated venereal diseases that leave open sores on the genitals greatly assists in the transmission of HIV, for reasons that should be obvious.</p>
<p>Another major factor here, since we are discussing teens, is that black and mestizo girls enter puberty earlier than white and Asian girls.  They thus become sexually active at a younger age, when they are less capable of making good judgement about whom to sleep with, or whether to do it at all.  Their lower IQs doubtless also help with the issue of judgement.</p>
<p>Black and Hispanic cultures are also very misogynistic, which almost certainly convinces girls they must provide sex in exchange for approval.</p>
<p>Among teenaged white girls, the poor body self-image that results from the constant barrage of media hype of &#8220;the perfect body&#8221; and divorced parents may play a part.</p>

			<p>To Amanda Fuqua:</p>
<p>Race is not just about a person&rsquo;s level of melanin.</p>
<p>By your logic, Michael Jackson, who&rsquo;s skin is white due to a disease called vitiligo, would be racially white. But that&rsquo;s not true. Despite Michael Jackson having vitiligo, he is still racially black. While it&rsquo;s true that melanin correlates with race, it is by no means an express means to determine a person&rsquo;s race.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Do you honestly think that race matters? It is a known fact that a person&rsquo;s skin color is determined by the amount of melanin in their bodies. It has NOTHING to do with &ldquo;race&rdquo; but everything to do with the amount of melanin. A &ldquo;white&rdquo; person goes to the tanning bed and gets darker&hellip;their melanin levels have increased&hellip;there&rsquo;s your racial superiority right there.

<p>Posted by Amanda Fuqua at 11:29 PM on March 11 </p>
<p>Firstly, racial differences apply to more than just skin color. To say otherwise, is elementary, at best. And your statement appears to neglect the fact that skin color is genetic, from parents and ancestors. </p>
<p>Also, tanning doesn&rsquo;t make White skin turn into Black skin; somebody would get skin cancer (and apparently die), before turning &#8220;Black.&#8221; Tanning would could give a light Arabic or Hispanic skin tone, for a White person; but that&rsquo;s really it. </p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t believe I have ever seen anyone with a black suntan, or a black person, (no matter how light) who&rsquo;s hue was the same as a suntanned white person. In any case, race is not just about skin color, some East Indians are as dark as some Africans, yet their phenotypes, features and hair are very different.</p>

			<p>If you&rsquo;re a white woman my best advice is to refrain from fornication with black men! Black men know they can easily exploit many young, naive and ignorant white women into having sex. AMREN readers  know that blacks on average are less intelligent, more impulsive and more fertile than whites. I bet many black men who fool around with white women also suspect this. That is why they find whites more desirable. I guess it&rsquo;s all part of the evolutionary mechanism of SEX SELECTION. Women with heads on thier shoulders and a good upbringing are shrewd enough to realize this. </p>

<p>Amanda, race governs more than just skin color; race and behavior are linked.  Put aside the platitudes and lets take the white race out of it for a moment, and you tell me honestly, if you have ever noticed a differnce in behavior between Asians and blacks.  Tell me honestly if you have ever observed a difference in aptitudes for academics, science, and athletics between the races.  How about in everyday life? Is one race louder, and more aggressive (on average) than the other.  There comes a point in life when you have to reevaluate what you have been told and compare it with what you observe.</p>

			<p>I saw the video segment for this on Fox News. All they showed in the video were attractive white girls (mostly blond) in school hallways and shopping malls. There was not one non-white girl shown during the whole report. The only black they showed was a black male walking down the hall with his arms around a white girl.</p>
<p>Now think of every news story in the past fifteen years you have seen about eduction that shows video of students in schools. They are always majority black and never all white. From the media you would think there are no white school children in the entire country. Now a story about teen female STDs come up and - poof! - they magically find a school with only only white girls. It was an absolutely vile attempt at getting the public to associate attractive white girls with STDs.  </p>
<p>They slipped up though with the shot of the black/white lovebirds. They probably thought they were promoting interracial dating when what they really did was connect the dots that practically all black girls, and a good share of white girls, get STDs from black males.</p>

<p>I had similar things happen to me when I was a 20-something blond banker in Florida, particularly when stopping at convenience stores or shopping malls after work.  It never failed to amaze and <i>disgust</i> me that obviously unemployed loitering black thugs thought a middle-class career woman coming home from the office would jump at the chance to sleep with them.  Yuck!  </p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;d gazed at too many Benetton billboards and watched too many movies.  Some of them really think that all white women dream of black males all day long, regardless of education or social standing.  Don&rsquo;t they realize how many white women find black thugs revolting??  You might not see it on TV, but it&rsquo;s true.  Don&rsquo;t let the media fool you.  </p>
<p>I even had one hit on me aggressively in line at Subway right in front a crowd.  It was humiliating!  I desperately wanted to whip around and say, &#8220;Do you <i>really</i> think a woman like me would waste her time on a loser like you?  I&rsquo;d rather die!&#8221;  He was much bigger than me, however, and I&rsquo;m sure that he would have hit me for bruising his ego.  Since white men don&rsquo;t stand up for women in that situation anymore, I had to say &#8220;no thanks!&#8221; and turn away.  </p>
<p>FYI:  when a young white female turns down a black male&rsquo;s advances, he usually yells &#8220;B*tch&#8221; or worse at her no matter how polite she is.  They are outraged that their advances were turned down and respond with a string of obscenities.  I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times this happened to me or my friends when we were young!  A couple of times they actually acted like they were going to attack us to make us run away while they yelled insults after us.  (I guess we were lucky we never actually were assaulted, come to think of it) </p>

			<p>Just a quick post script to this article - all morning this story was predictably everywhere on the news program. I closely monitored each one I saw to see just how they would, if they did at all, explain away the racial disparity. As ususal, the mainstream media did not disappoint in their eternal crusade to twist and spin news to better reflect upon non-whites, blacks in particular. Nearly all networks did note the 50% rate of STD infection among black females&hellip;but that is ALL they mentioned. NONE of them bothered to mention that Whites and others had less than half that rate of infection!! Thus, the 50% figure, while admittedly being a staggering statistic in and of itself, was meaningless in terms of race or ethnicity, as other groups could have been at 48%, 39%, etc&hellip;rather than 20%! <br>

			<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&ldquo;Race itself is not a risk factor for STDs, Forhan said.</p>
<p>Why, of course, race can&rsquo;t possibly be a factor. I mean just because Blacks are many times more likely to have sex YEARS earlier than their White counterparts&hellip; Because the number of illegitimate Black births outnumber that of Whites for the same age bracket&hellip; Because Blacks of either sex see nothing immoral or even wrong with having sex with multiple partners during a specific calendar time period&hellip; How then could one ever imply race is a risk factor? I mean it surely would be &#8220;racist&#8221; to suggest race itself is a factor&hellip; For the likelihood of Blacks having acquired a sexually transmitted disease or two, before age 20.</p>

			<p>There is more to skin colour than pigmentation influence.  It is also a major distinguishing factor amongst the several separate markers present between races.</p>
<p><b>Molecular biology of light skin</b></p>
<p>&#8220;Skin color is a quantitative trait in that it is varies continuously on a gradient from dark to light, as it is a polygenic trait, under the influence of several genes. Many of these genes have yet to be identified, however two genes are known that do contribute to skin color, they are the MC1R and the SLC24A5 genes.[18] The mutation resulting in the light skin version of the SLC24A5 gene has been estimated to have originated in Europe between 6,000 and 12,000 years ago, indicating that at least one of the genes responsible for pale skin colour in Europeans arose relatively recently.[28]</p>
<p>&#8220;Mixed ancestry people of African-European descent who possess one or two copies of the European allele of the SLC24A5 gene have skin color that is significantly lighter than mixed ancestry people who possess only the African allele. It is estimated, based on this observation, that the SLC24A5 locus &#8220;explains between 25-38% of the European-African difference in skin melanin index&#8221;.[29][25][30][31]&#8221;</p>
<p>Furthermore, tanned white skin will revert to it&rsquo;s normal pale complexion once deprived of UV rays.  Black/brown skin is inherent and remains black/brown.</p>
