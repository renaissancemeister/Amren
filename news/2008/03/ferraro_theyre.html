						<p>Geraldine Ferraro defended her controversial comment that Sen. Barack Obama&rsquo;s campaign was successful because he was black, telling an interviewer Tuesday that she was being attacked because she was white.</p>
<p>Comments by former Rep. Geraldine Ferraro are drawing criticism from the Obama campaign.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any time anybody does anything that in any way pulls this campaign down and says, &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s address reality and the problems we&rsquo;re facing in this world,&rsquo; you&rsquo;re accused of being racist, so you have to shut up,&#8221; she told the Daily Breeze of Torrance, California. &#8220;Racism works in two different directions. I really think they&rsquo;re attacking me because I&rsquo;m white. How&rsquo;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p>In another interview Tuesday, she compared Obama&rsquo;s situation to her own 24 years ago, when she was the first female candidate for vice president.</p>
<p>She told a FOX News interviewer, &#8220;I got up and the question was asked, &lsquo;Why do you think Barack Obama is in the place he is today&#8221; as the party&rsquo;s delegate front-runner?</p>
<p>&#8220;I said in large measure, because he is black. I said, Let me also say in 1984 &mdash; and if I have said it once, I have said it 20, 60, 100 times &mdash; in 1984, if my name was Gerard Ferraro instead of Geraldine Ferraro, I would never have been the nominee for vice president,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>In her first interview with Daily Breeze, published late last week, Ferraro said, &#8220;If Obama was a white man, he would not be in this position. And if he was a woman, he would not be in this position. He happens to be very lucky to be who he is. And the country is caught up in the concept.&#8221;</p>
<p>She also said Hillary Clinton had been the victim of a &#8220;sexist media.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obama himself has called the comments &#8220;patently absurd.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t think Geraldine Ferraro&rsquo;s comments have any place in our politics or in the Democratic Party. They are divisive,&#8221; he told the Allentown Morning News.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think anybody who understands the history of this country knows they are patently absurd. And I would expect that the same way those comments don&rsquo;t have a place in my campaign, they shouldn&rsquo;t have a place in Sen. Clinton&rsquo;s, either,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Earlier, Obama&rsquo;s top strategist, David Axelrod, called for Clinton to sever ties with the former New York congresswoman, who serves on her campaign&rsquo;s finance committee.</p>

<p>It figures a woman (with an Italian surname) would be the first white political figure to take the race card and tear it into little pieces.  And a Democrat no less!</p>
<p>Looks like someone&rsquo;s been reading naughty pages on the Internet.</p>

			<p>This is smart politics by the Clintons. They know whay they are doing and have timed it well, too, waiting for the pop culture (i.e., SNL) to make an opening for them to play the race card.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a more whites don&rsquo;t have the courage of this gutsy lady.  And while I&rsquo;ve never thought much of liberals, she could teach &#8220;conservatives&#8221; a thing or two about what it means to stand up for the truth.</p>
<p>She also puts men to shame.  I think one of the reasons we find ourselves in such dire straits is that men long ago gave up on their duties as protectors.  I hope this gutsy lady serves as an object lesson to the spineless wonders in Gucci loafers of what it means to be a profile in courage.  </p>
<p>I hope she doesn&rsquo;t capitulate.</p>
<p>Go, Geraldine, Go!</p>

			<p>Geraldine Ferraro was an affirmative action beneficiary herself.  Imagine that you&rsquo;re Walter Mondale in the Summer of 1984.  You know Reagan is going to beat you in November quite handily.  So the challenge is to make your candidacy somehow historically meaningful.  Answer?  Woman running mate.</p>

			<p> Good to hear Geraldine Ferraro refusing to back off from controversial statements. Wonder if a White male would have been let off that easily? I doubt it. And it&rsquo;s good to hear that elderly Hispanic recall how when the blacks were in the catbird seat they wouldn&rsquo;t help the Hispanics. Now the Hispanics are telling the blacks to go fish for their votes. What goes around, comes around.</p>

			<p>The media is very liberal.<br>
Obama is a bigger liberal than Hillary.<br>
Race trumps gender with the media lefties.<br>
Hence, the media likes Obama more than Hillary.</p>
<p>So Ferraro is partly right.  </p>
<p>Additionally, we have a controlled media, and it seems the media has had a falling out with the Clintons.  The media was also quite nasty in the way they distorted every little thing Bill Clinton said. </p>

			<p>Does this surprise anyone?  Obama is just another black hustler who will play the race card whenever, and on whomever he pleases.  Hopefully, this time he has overplayed his hand, and people will start seeing him for what he really is.  Maybe the country is not so far gone that they will continue to march in lockstep with the media, and decide that Ferraro is the guilty party.</p>
<p>I can just imagine who fearful the GOP is of having Obama repeatedly play the race card during the general election campaign.  Try picturing the vetting process for anyone anywhere near the McCane campaign.  &#8220;Are you now or have you ever been white?&#8221;  </p>

			<p>This is so wonderful.  I really wish my friend who gave up in discouragement about getting white women involved in fighting what she called the deflamation of European Americans would look at this site now. She is in the shower getting ready to go out.  I will certainly tell her what I just read.    </p>
<p>I am so proud of Miss Ferraro.  She is saying what everybody knows.  I am so happy that she is not backing off of this.  </p>

			<p>Well, some of you Amren posters finally got what you&rsquo;ve been wishing for:  a white public figure who doesn&rsquo;t shamelessly recant and grovel! </p>
<p>Too bad SHE&rsquo;S a FEMALE, not a male.  And a &#8220;feminazi&#8221; to boot.  ;)</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t underestimate/undervalue ALL your racial sisters, guys. And she married a white guy, too.   </p>
<p>(Just teasing, ok?  A sense of humor is a virtue of intelligence.) </p>
<p>I also thought it was refreshing candor on her part to say she would not have been in the running for VP if she were not a woman.  That comment really stands out amid the typical politico hubris.  </p>

			<p>I think I&rsquo;ve finally figured it out.  It&rsquo;s not just that all these White Democratic women are just FOR Hillary.  I think that they, more than Republican women and, especially, Republican men, really know what black rule will mean for them, for us all.  These women fooled themselves into thinking that they could control the black vote. But all the nitwit college kids and sandal-wearing professors immediately swooned before the black Jesus and all of a sudden REALITY for Democratic women is hitting home. And hitting home hard.  </p>
<p>These Democratic women deal with blacks close-up, day in and day out.  They can see the mau-mau in their midst, and I think they recognize that Obama is the American Nelson Mandela, who can fool all the aracial Republicans and college kiddies, but that he&rsquo;ll make way for the next generation, an Mbeki or, worse, a Mugabe. The women are scared. And they have every right to be so.</p>

<p>Really Comrade Ferraro?</p>
<p>What Comrades Ferraro and both Clintons are so upset about, is that they are being out &ldquo;victimed.&rdquo; They also don&rsquo;t like the fact, that all of the absurd rebuttals from Comrade Obama&rsquo;s camp are laced with the very inane and mindless pervasiveness of &ldquo;white privilege&rdquo; twaddle, that they have made such a fetish of across their careers, while openly working for the destruction of white America through oppressive and sanctimonious policies.  </p>
<p>After all Comrade Ferraro, was not one of your chief slurs against the Reagan Presidency in 1984, that it was racist? That it was not &ldquo;inclusive&rdquo; of racial minorities, and that your party was the &ldquo;big tent&rdquo; of socialist Christmas presents for all? </p>
<p>Sow the wind Comrade Ferraro, and reap the whirlwind!</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s that?<br>

			<p>I get a certain amount of satisfaction out of seeing white liberals discover that no matter how much they&rsquo;ve pandered to blacks in the past, it&rsquo;s NEVER, EVER going to be enough.  At least, Ms. Ferraro hasn&rsquo;t groveled and apologized, as is standard for whites who speak the truth &hellip; although the day may still be young.</p>
<p>The truth is no less true for being unpopular.  </p>

No, we were rebuffed in our role as protectors.  Women said they didn&rsquo;t need us for that job anymore.  Smart men today say, &#8220;very well, my dears, you&rsquo;re on your own.&#8221;  </p>

<p>1. You mean the history of the last 45 years where blacks have been given preferences in every segment of our society?</p>
<p>2. A lefty female Democrat shows more cajones than any Republican or white male in politics. Good for her.</p>
<p>3. Think of it. Who has the Obama campaign (and their supporters in the media) been calling &#8220;racist?&#8221; Bill Clinton. Hillary Clinton. Geraldine Ferraro.</p>

			<p>I think it is beginning to dawn on a lot of liberals and assorted Democrats that they are going to get a demotion as soon as Obama gets elected.  There is only room for one at the top and that will be Barak and his true supporters.  The rest of the feminists, environmentalists, working slobs can go join the Green Party or something.    </p>

<p>I am a staunch Clinton supporter. But, if Obama wins the nomination, I will be voting for McCain. And to think, there are millions of other voters who share my beliefs.</p>
<p>Why? We aren&rsquo;t that stupid. Barack Obama is in this for blacks and blacks ONLY! His record and his lifestyle prove it. </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve never thought much of Ferraro.  But she is being honest about the issue (a rare thing for a democrat).</p>
<p>And it exemplifies something important about the democratic party.  For years they&rsquo;ve exploited blacks for votes and political power.  Now, they are learning the hard way what a huge mistake that is.  As blacks struggle to seize power from them through Obama.  This internal struggle for control over the democratic party is likely to destroy them.  It&rsquo;s specifically racist in nature, with undertones of exploitation of our country by immigrants (if you look closely at Obama&rsquo;s policies, it&rsquo;s quite clear that he intends to loot the US economy and redistribute that wealth to africa).  In order to prevent this from happening, the central power of the democratic party is going to have to make the general public conscious of these issues and the direct negative effect an Obama presidency will have of the quality of life of the average american.  They must dispel the denial and political correctness.  There will be a backlash from which they may never recover.  There is little choice though.  If they allow the far left, the blacks and the immigrants to seize control of the party, they will quickly run it into the ground.  An Obama presidency would guarantee that a democrat never gets elected ever again.</p>

			<p>&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s address reality and the problems we&rsquo;re facing in this world,&rsquo; you&rsquo;re accused of being racist, so you have to shut up,&rdquo;&hellip;&ldquo;Racism works in two different directions. I really think they&rsquo;re attacking me because I&rsquo;m white. How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s right, shes white, she violated the rules of PC.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Obama himself has called the comments &ldquo;patently absurd.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Geraldine Ferraro&rsquo;s comments have any place in our politics or in the Democratic Party. They are divisive,&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Nowhere does he deny the accuracy of her statements. </p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t know about others, but I just can&rsquo;t believe my eyes and ears.  Did she really say that?  Can a White in public actually be awakening - and a Democrat to boot?  We have to admit that she is a woman, and women CAN get away with a little logic now and then, after all they&rsquo;ve been victimized by those evil White heterosexual males too.  But to be completely serious, it does seem like a good thing.  I just want to hear those words from a White MAN and then see how the controlled media treats it.</p>

<p>That is absurd. Hillary Clinton is the victim of a &#8220;racist media.&#8221; If Obama was not in the race, the media would carry Hillary to the White House on their shoulders. It&rsquo;s just that in liberal ideology, black racism trumps feminism. </p>
<p>Go back forty years when young Hillary was championing the cause of those poor happless black victims of white society. Little did she know then that she was torpedoing her own chance to be the first woman president. I will be tickled pink if the Clintons continue to unleash their political savagery against blacks. </p>

This is the first sensible thing I&rsquo;ve heard out of Ms. Ferraro in I-can&rsquo;t-remember-how-long. &#8216;Course she&rsquo;s only doing it out of a different kind of &#8220;blood solidarity&#8221;   &mdash;   the blood of gender, rather than of race   &mdash;   to help put her pal Hill on the Hill, but even so. Hey, I dig, man   &mdash;   &#8220;Sob-Sisters are Doin&rsquo; It for Themselves!&#8221; </p>
<p>Me, I&rsquo;m still trying to wrap my head around the prospect of BHO as CEO. Bill Clinton may or may not have been &#8220;the first black president,&#8221; but Da Obama-jama might yet become the first Affirmative Action President. And although it hasn&rsquo;t happened yet   &mdash;   and maybe won&rsquo;t at all   &mdash;   the mere possibility of an Oval Office Obama HORRIFIES me. <br>
 <br>
That the Dhimmicrats are offering voters a menu consisting only of BHO and HRC   &mdash;   &#8220;a choice of cancer or polio&#8221;   &mdash;   is appalling enough. If Hillary were the worst thing in this election year, that 2008 would still qualify as a bad year. But for that party to threaten us with an anti-Western stalking horse   &mdash;   a &#8220;horse of a different color,&#8221; so to speak   &mdash;   reveals in them a contempt for traditional America that not even someone as cynical as I am had thought them capable of. (Someone else on here called him &#8220;the Third World&rsquo;s Manchurian Candidate,&#8221; which I thought was brilliant.) </p>
<p>The man is an unreconstructed socialist who gets his ideology from an overtly racist church. There&rsquo;s plenty more wrong with him than that, needless to say, but in my books that alone is enough to forever disqualify him from consideration as &#8220;presidential material.&#8221;  </p>
<p>To make my point, I now ask you to indulge in a little nostalgia for the not-so-distant past&hellip;<br>
 <br>
Think back to the immediate aftermath of 9/11. Remember what that felt like? Do you? The West was united in common purpose and national pride   &mdash;   to an inspiring degree I&rsquo;d seen only in WWII movies but never personally witnessed. The country was scared   &mdash;   but also steadfast and determined   &mdash;   in the face of this unprecedented act of anti-Western hostility. </p>
<p>So friends, AmRenners, and countrymen, consider this: </p>
<p>If you told those scared-but-patriotic Americans of late 2001 that within seven years they would be ruled by a brown-skinned man educated in Indonesia who refuses to wear a US flag on his lapel named B. Hussein Obama, well, those post-9/11 people could only conclude that, by 2008, our Islamofascist tormentors had won some sort of decisive military victory over us. That America had surrendered to some unimaginably devastating defeat   &mdash;   and Americans themselves reduced to a conquered people. </p>
<p>But we have not been beaten on the battlefield. We&rsquo;ve just pooped in our own bed. (Or rather, the left wing of the Democratic Party has done this to the bed we ALL have to sleep in.) <br>
 <br>
That Americans could bring such potential disaster upon themselves   &mdash;   and in such a short period as six or seven years   &mdash;   would in October or November of 2001 not have been believed by ANYBODY, regardless of their political persuasion. It would have sounded like one of the less-plausible brands of science-fiction. </p>
<p>Like I said: HORRIFYING. <br>

&#8220;Patently absurd?&#8221;  The only thing absurd about this exchange is that anybody would consider that Ferraro isn&rsquo;t right.</p>
<p>Of course this mediocre talent promoted to god-like status is winning votes ONLY because he is black.</p>
<p>There are a pretty fair amount of white voters who will vote for a black simply because he&rsquo;s black, providing he doesn&rsquo;t have any current charges pending against him, and he&rsquo;s not presently on parole or probation.  Any past rape charges or violent crime convictions would not be an obstacle to their support.  In fact, such a history would endear him even more to these types, because they would tout his ability to &#8220;rise above adversity&#8221; in order to &#8220;succeed.&#8221;</p>
<p>All I&rsquo;m hearing from the boob tube talking heads is how he&rsquo;s so intelligent (Determined by what?), smooth/polished (How?  He just talks like everyone else, and he&rsquo;s not quite as articulate as Hillary, John Edwards, Dennis Kucinich, et al.  Am I missing something?)</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that the man&rsquo;s utterances, obviously favoring blacks, and his association with mentors and known anti-white racists, Farrakhan and Rev. Wright, blaringly indicates he is strongly biased in favor of his own tribesmen and against whites.  </p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t he choose his black, disgusting father over his white airhead mother?</p>

<p>Demographics is the main problem of the Democratic Party.  For years they&rsquo;ve talked about how they were the &#8220;Big Tent&#8221; party welcoming millions of blacks and immigrants into their fold.  Only about 1/3 of Democratic voters are White men and a large portion of these are homosexuals.  The largest block in the party are the feminists.  It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before the party crashes. </p>

			<p>Ferraro is being victimized by the Bolsheviks and racist white and non-white loonies.  She spoke the truth.  Obama is young, good looking, mulatto, liberal, and a very good speaker.  He gets all the african vote and splits the votes of other non-blacks.  It is overlooked by some that he belongs to a racist african church that has a black value system that is vocally pro-black.  If Obama were young, good looking, white, liberal, and a very good speaker, he would not get all the black vote (especially against Hillary).  And if the white Obama belonged to a church that was vocally pro-white and had a white value system then he would be condemned and get no black votes.  So Ferraro is right saying that Obama is winning because he is black.  He is able to get away with what a white man could not.  And she gets crucified by the girly nation for speaking truth to those in power. </p>

Never mind that racial preferences for blacks (not whites) is a legalized fact of the land (or there would not be such vehement opposition by black supremacists to any initiative to eliminate those racial preferences). But Geraldine Ferraro speaks the widely admitted TRUTH, that Obama would not be were he is if he were white, and SHE is accused of &#8220;racism&#8221;!! Yet we&rsquo;ve been hearing over and over in polls from those voting for Obama, black and white, that they are specifically voting for him BECAUSE HE IS BLACK! Everyone KNOWS this! Yet Geraldine simply points this out bluntly, and she is accused of &#8220;racism&#8221;! For stating a fact that those pundits criticizing her themselves have been admitting all along in so many words!</p>

			<p>Hey Guys, check out this would be Tyrant running for President.  Somebody should remind him that he&rsquo;s not running for Tyrant, he&rsquo;s running for President. Then they should remind him that he&rsquo;s STILL running.  He hasn&rsquo;t won yet.<br>
&#8220;Patently absurd&#8221;????<br>
Is he kidding?<br>
Patently absurd to who?  Pathologically dishonest people?<br>
People possessed with a demonic inability to look life in the eye and see what is right in front of them?</p>
<p>He just stepped in it folks.  If they play this right he will end up like Jesse Jackson.  If not, Race Riots, I promise you.  Big time no holds barred, fight to the death Race Riots.  <br>
It&rsquo;s understandable, though not at all acceptable, that he should respond so, well, defensively.  Because if he doesn&rsquo;t, his whole house of cards will crumble all around him.</p>
<p>But, by answering in this way he - HE - and NOT Ferraro, has said something patently absurd.  His words &#8220;patently absurd&#8221; were literally patently absurd. His response to Ferraro was a patently absurd denial of an obvious fact. <br>
By doing this he is forcing the rest of the Country to deny what is SO obvious that if it goes along - and many very well might - it will absolutely spell the end of the republic as we know it.  Because there will be violent consequences later.  The reason is, that the millions - MILLIONS - of Blacks who are already licking their chops at the prospect of an Obama victory, will be emboldened by the White support (which will arouse their contempt for said Whites even more, and rightly so) and make them even more resistant to ANY criticism from other Whites who aren&rsquo;t afraid of them.</p>
<p>So what we will have is an entire Race, who is already enjoying many, many, special privledges - which has succeeded only in making that Race more demanding and ungrateful - with its very own President who not only encourages, but demands, that the entire Country place him and his folk above criticism, above the law, and above the principles of Democracy, thereby putting the finishing touches on the Democracy already severly damaged by his predecesor.<br>
He should be taken to task on this.  And I even think Mr. Taylor should issue a statement letting the public know that we as Whites are very concerned about this response of Obamas, and the implications.</p>
<p>Having said that, I don&rsquo;t care if the person who made these remarks about Obama is a woman, a democrat, or even a fellow Lefty.  It was said!  That was the important thing.  The ice has been broken, and now Gender and Race are going to the matrices.</p>
<p>Oh, another thing.  Race trumps Gender, as everyone knows.  But something else trumps both.  Economics.  And if people from Paul Craig Roberts, to Pat Buchanan, to George Borjas, and others, are at all on the right track, and of course I think they are, then lots of Whites will say &#8220;F it&#8221; and we will begin to see a sharp turn around. Their wake up call will come AFTER they realize that they are in between a rock and a hard place, ECONOMICALLY.  <br>
And it would seem as if we&rsquo;re pretty much there now, or at least on our way.  Perhaps THIS was the real motive for saying what Ferraro said.  After all, rarely will a Politician say something without a motive.  And the number one motive for a Politician is – winning!  Ferraro wants Clinton to win.  And Clinton wants Clinton to win.   Each time Obama and Clinton do this stuff to each other they clearly up the anty.  I am sure Mrs. Clinton is aware of the feeling out there among White voters who feel dispossed and betrayed and angry.  Q: How to get to them? A: Economics. Q: How to do it? A: Position Obama in such a way as to force people to see what a fraud he is, and then get those Whites who are voting for him, to take that moment when their support for him wavers in doubt, to begin to watch their wallets, and think about their bank accounts. <br>
If she gets the voters to question his credibility, and then gets them to think about the Economy, she could establish a comeback, and pull off a great upset. If she does then, like her or not, she deserves to win.  That is, if she can pull it off.  Chances are though, she&rsquo;s not even thinking along these lines.  Who knows?  One things for sure, the girls are obviously up to something.  <br>

Exactly the opposite of the truth.  Every voter in America should be discussing the implications of Ferraro&rsquo;s statement until they fall over from exhaustion.   And elections are 100% divisive.  Which brings up the number idiotic campaign slogan?  &ldquo;We want a president who will bring us together.&rdquo;  No we want a president who will let us stay apart.</p>
<p>Nobody in the world knows better than Bill and Hillary what the awesome power of being black in America is worth.  It can get a stiff like Obama elected president over a dumpy man-hater. <br>

I was embarrassed and pained for him.  Obama&rsquo;s affiliations are so more than questionable and yet even Fox reporting and commentary mostly yields to giving him a free pass.  I regret that Ferraro is not more specific.  Even mentioning his middle name is treated like an unfair attack.  <br>

			<p>I do not consider many on this site to be gullible, but if anyone is falling for this Ferraro piece, he needs to take a step back for a moment.</p>
<p>This act by Ferraro is not brave in the least.  This act has been completely calculated by the Hillary camp to bring race up as an issue to awaken white voters against Obama.</p>
<p>The resignation was probably even planned, once again, for publicity.</p>
<p>If any Dem gets into the White House, it will be the same politics of division and race all over again and people who believed this lie here on Amren will be scratching their heads and wondering &#8220;I thought the Dems learned their lesson&#8221;. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all part of their same old game to get power.  Nothing has changes.  They do not &#8220;see the light&#8221; in the least.  They are not braver than conservative White males.  They are still our opposition.  They just knew that, for them, the consequences are less if they were brought to task for their &#8220;sin,&#8221; but the rewards are great if their plan works - a trip to the White House.</p>

			<p>  Of course, what she said was true, but Obama, to his credit, said that the statement&rsquo;s intent was not racist. Senator Obama is not an evil man, and I believe he has good intentions. However, the old saying is  &mdash;   &#8220;hell is full of good intentions.&#8221; At this time in our history, where we are losing two wars, the financial system is in chaos, the dollar is diving, and stagflation is eating away our standard of living, we can&rsquo;t afford a tyro with shop-worn liberal ideas as president.</p>

<p>THAT&rsquo;S IT! </p>
<p>Not only is (or should) this term be offensive to White Christians (as it connotes Muslim overlord rule, white slavery, forced sexual prostitution of both boys and girls, and/or castration of men for the &#8216;elite&rsquo; Janissary troops of Muslim history!) but it also shows the UTTER DEPRAVITY of the party that gave us Bill and Hill Clinton, the last time they were in power- they truly ARE the Dhimmicrats. The intentional bombing of Serbia during Orthodox Holy Week by the Clinton administration was the first step in this Muslim management of multicultural opinion.</p>
<p>That they NOW would &#8216;trade their birthright for a mess of multicultural potage&rsquo; is now both the nadir, and the &#8216;summum bonum&rsquo; of this party, which means the destruction of America as we have known it. They are both race traitors, cultural traitors, and religious heretics, as the Founding Fathers understood this country to be.

			<p>Liberal and democrat self absorption prevents their learning from history. Interaction between italian american politicians and blacks in the NY-NJ metro area has an interesting past. Vito Marcantonio, a hardcore socialist, represented the Harlem district(albeit when there was still an Italian Harlem, in which my grandparents lived) which later elected Adam Clayton <br>
Powell and is now represented by Charlie Rangel.  Marcantonio may have died or left office becaus eof old age but more recent evente give a clearer indication of things.</p>
<p>Peter Rodino was a democrat who represented Newark NJ. He rose to national fame and was a democrat darling during the Watergate hearings, which Hiliary was involved with as a staffer. After the Newark riots, many Italians, as well as other white residents, left the city.  Post watergate, the new constituency of Newark &amp; its local leaders told the heretofore social liberal Rodino, &#8216;yea, you have done a great job, but we want one of our own now, so you are done&rsquo;</p>
<p>   I recall hearing of this as a youngster, while listening to the Bob Grant radio show. Later on, during the reign of another lousy New York governor, Mario Cuomo, ( dubbed &#8216;Il supremo&rsquo;, or Il Sfachim by Bob Grant), there was some type of racial incident of the usual sort in NYC, maybe a Sharpton or Sonny Carson caper. many of Bob&rsquo;s callers wondered why Cuomo did not condemn the perpetrators. In response Bob Grant said that when he had been friendly with Il Supremo, they had discussed this, and Cuoumo told Bob &#8221; there is absolutely nothing to be gained politically by condemning or censuring a black&#8221;. Prescient words indeed.  To close, the democrats may need to harken even further back in history to learn their lesson from Bismarck, the Iron Chancellor, who said &#8220;the liberated are not greatful, they are demanding&#8221;. God help this country </p>

She&rsquo;s an old woman who hasn&rsquo;t held public office in 24 years, but still has some name recognition.  As perhaps a last service to her Party and the femarxist agenda, she agreed to bring up the issue of race on Hilary&rsquo;s behalf, endure a little criticism, and resign her campaign position.  This has all been scripted, just as when B. Hussein Obama&rsquo;s lackey called Hilary a &#8220;monster&#8221;, and resigned a couple weeks ago.  BHO wanted to remind the voters that Ms Rodham-Clinton is a particularly nasty person, and keep his own hands clean.  When their candidate wins, the underlings who have committed sins for their master will be remembered and rewarded.   </p>

<p>So you going to respond to the replies of your stagnant comment? or like most leftie trolls simply not respond ever again? Cant say i&rsquo;m surprised. Cowardice is a static trait of liberals on this forum and abroad.</p>
<p>Onto the actual article.</p>
<p>Of course they attacked her because she was white, and i was believing she was stalwartly standing by what she thought to be true but what GWS posted makes complete sense. We all know political campaigns are never by-the-books fair. Of course they&rsquo;ll present themselves as such publicly in the media but most of the time, they&rsquo;re very guilty of snaking in some kind of subtle tactic. It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if the plan was for miss Geraldine to &#8220;take one for the team&#8221; publicly so the white voting bloc realizes its foolishness for voting for obama based on race. Because lets get real here, most people ARE going to know that his race is getting him far, but most also know to say so publicly results in figurative lynching. So the only way to make use of such obviousness is to do such a thing. </p>
<p>GWS is right in saying the Demo&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t going to learn any lesson, especially being this was likely planned. But it at least does show they realize what the truth is, even if they sleazily only use it when it&rsquo;ll work in their interest. Which for Hillary, is stealing votes from Obama.</p>

			<p>Women have also been a &#8220;protected&#8221; group.  But now, that fact that they are white is cracking open the facade of race reality that up to now has been mostly a oppression to white males.  Eveyone has laughed and scorned when a white male claimed reverse discrimination, etc.  Now, these priviliged white women are beginning to see how tenuous their power is, owing to the fact that they are white.</p>

			<p>To The Incredible Shrinking White Man,</p>
<p>Who writes, &ldquo;Think back to the immediate aftermath of 9/11. Remember what that felt like? Do you? The West was united in common purpose and national pride  &mdash;  to an inspiring degree I&rsquo;d seen only in WWII movies but never personally witnessed. The country was scared  &mdash;  but also steadfast and determined  &mdash;  in the face of this unprecedented act of anti-Western hostility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not for those who knew their American history, especially 20th century American history.  We knew it meant big pay days for big government.  The president and congress fell over themselves rushing to open the door to let opportunity in.  President Bill Clinton was a politician for all ages.  What he said was either a contradiction of the truth or, in those special occasions when he rose to the zenith of Clintonesque, the exact opposite of the truth.  Such was the time when he said, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t love your country and not love your government.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After I saw the second plane on TV I called the golf course to see if they had closed for the day. The starter said no; my tee time was good.   The world goes on.   I had no pride in my country, just disgust for the rulers who could not keep Americans from being killed even though they swore they would, and we paid them trillions of dollars to do simply that.</p>
<p>Politicians united are a conspiracy.  People united behind united politicians means death is ahead for the common man.  (See WWI &amp; WWII)  The best thing that could happen in America is a law giving people back their right to associate and do business with whomever they choose.  Now that would spark some genuine patriotism.  <br>

			<p>This is all political rhetoric.  Once the primaries are over, the Clinton and Obama camps will be holding hands, singing Kumbaya, and in a show of support, will once again be devising plans on how to stick it to white males.  And you can bet that if Clinton wins, she will go even further overboard than usual just to &#8220;prove&#8221; to blacks that she is on their side.<br>
As far as Ferraro is concerned, I find it amusing to hear a devout liberal making claims that racism can go in &#8220;two directions&#8221;.  This flies in the face of everything liberals have been telling us all along; That only whites are capable of racism, since whites are the ones with all the power. How interesting that in a time of desperation, they easily change course and agree with us after having built their political careers saying just the opposite. Now Ferraro attempts to gain white solidarity for Hillary after she and her ilk have done everything in their power to disenfranchise us?  I&rsquo;m all for white solidarity, but not for these traitors.  They are no better than the annoying relative that only calls when they need something.  Sorry Hillary, but our pockets have been emptied by your kind.  </p>

Walter Mondale let himself be cowed by the feminists of NOW, with the end result that he lost by the greatest landslide in history- Reagan&rsquo;s 525 electoral votes beat FDR&rsquo;s 1936 total of 521.</p>
<p>If Hillary Clintoon gets the nomination and puts Obama on the ticket to &#8220;appease&#8221; black voters, John McCain could win big, although not like Reagan&rsquo;s margin. Just a thought.</p>

I believe him, it would account for the strange senators and congressmen that always seem to get elected in that region . My question is, how the heck does Ted Kennedy always manage re-election ? Especially after attempting to force integration down the throats of Bostonians in &#8216;76 . You would have thought that would have ended his career .</p>

<p>Because the working class Irish in Boston aren&rsquo;t the majority of  voters in the state.  They were enough to elect and re-elect Albert &#8220;Dapper&#8221; O&rsquo;Neil to a citywide at-large seat on the Boston City Council until 1999.  Now, Boston is just too black and Afro-Carribean, along with a lot of other things.</p>

<p>No, we were rebuffed in our role as protectors. Women said they didn&rsquo;t need us for that job anymore. Smart men today say, &ldquo;very well, my dears, you&rsquo;re on your own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I understand your point and still disagree.  Feminism could not have succeeded without the acquiescence of spineless white men.  What men seriously challenged them?  The only case I can remember from feminism&rsquo;s heyday was the notorious tennis match between Billy Jean King and Bobby Riggs, i.e., the male chauvinist pig.  And that was more for notoriety than anything else.  Rush Limbaugh&rsquo;s pathetic feints at feminism notwithstanding, if you can think of any men who have seriously challenged feminist orthodoxy, I&rsquo;m all ears.</p>
<p>Besides, I think most women prefer the old ways.  Most of them regret the death of chivalry  &mdash;  at least where I&rsquo;m from.  The overwhelming majority of women I&rsquo;ve known have wanted respect for who they are, but also a man to look to serve as their protector and champion.</p>
<p>And, again, James Watson and William Saletan have hardly been profiles in courage.  They, along with most men, could profit from the examples set by Ann Coulter and, yes, Geraldine Ferraro.</p>
<p>Evil triumphs when good men do nothing.  </p>

			<p>&ldquo;Whether Italians are white or not is debatable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By whom? You mean Columbus, Verdi, Puccini, Rossini, Michelangelo, Titian, Raphael, Dante, Petrarch, Fellini, Boccaccio, weren&rsquo;t white? Boy, have I been fooled all these many years. I guess my whole education was a waste of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think he was referring more to southern Italians and Sicilians. They are clearly different from northern Europeans. </p>

 I thought that this board was supposed to encompass ALL Europeans, not just those of the fairest flesh tones. If we are going to get into this &#8220;Who is whiter than who?&#8221; debate, we might as well hang it up NOW because we are feeding right into the trap that our real enemies have designed. <br>
 In my opinion, if you are of mostly European ancestry, and hold to at least the majority of the beliefs that are espoused on this board, there should be no reason why we shouldnt work together for our common goals. Wheither your ancestors come from the western coast of Ireland, the Urals, northern Norway, or southern Sicily, it shouldnt matter, what should matter the most is pan European solidarity, nothing less.</p>

Thank you.  My sentiments as well. We must not become <br>
diverted in self-destructive attacks on each other. I had earlier written a post denouncing that earlier poster&rsquo;s  divisive point of view but for some reason Amren did not choose to print it, while they did print his.</p>
