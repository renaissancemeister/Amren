						<p>POLICE are advising the Immigration Department for the first time about how and where to settle troubled African refugees.</p>
<p>Senior Victorian police have urged the department to settle Sudanese families in country towns such as Mildura and Sale, away from suburban Melbourne where young African men are being caught up in street crime.</p>
<p>The Australian understands that police first appealed to immigration officials last year following a spike in criminal activity among young Sudanese men, while Chief Commissioner Christine Nixon was attempting to play down the problem.</p>
<p>Sudanese gang violence escalated last September, with the fatal bashing of 19-year-old Liep Gony near Noble Park railway station, in Melbourne&rsquo;s east.</p>
<p>Police advised against settling Sudanese in &#8220;dysfunctional areas&#8221; such as housing commission flats in Melbourne&rsquo;s north and east, and a growing number of the 15,000-member state community are now living in Mildura, Sale and Wonthaggi.</p>
<p>African Think Tank chairman Berhan Ahmed yesterday praised the rural settlement, saying it would help the Sudanese integrate, find work and avoid drugs, alcohol and street crime.</p>
<p>&#8220;The influence of drugs and alcohol will not be there, and it will be much easier for kids and refugee families to adjust in rural areas,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Dr Ahmed &mdash; a Melbourne University senior research fellow studying refugees living in rural Victoria and their city counterparts &mdash; said young Africans living in the country were more likely to perform better at school and get work.</p>
<p>While it was difficult to resettle refugees who were already living in Melbourne, he said the Brumby Government could offer them better housing and jobs to encourage them to move.</p>
<p>&#8220;You entice them by giving them opportunities,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Victoria Police&rsquo;s multicultural liaison officer, Joseph Herrech said helping Sudanese refugees to settle in Melbourne was a challenge for immigration officials and police.</p>
<p>He said grouping the Sudanese together at times led to crime-related problems, and separating them often exacerbated their emotional hardship.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve recommended to Immigration that they be spread out slightly more,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Other police recommendations to the immigration department include developing better pre-departure programs for humanitarian refugees to educate them more about Australian culture, the judicial process and the law-enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>Police sources have told The Australian that gangs involving Sudanese men, including African Power and the Bloods and Crips &mdash; inspired by the Los Angeles-based crime groups &mdash; have grown in numbers and become more of a concern in the suburbs of Collingwood and Carlton.</p>
<p>Former immigration minister Kevin Andrews decided to cut back the African refugee intake last year amid fears they were not &#8220;settling and adjusting&#8221; into Australian life.<br>

					<p>I have a better idea, send them back to the black African hellhole that they came from. If they wish to act tough and form gangs then they can do it in the Sudan and fight against their Arab oppressors. Instead they choose to flee to First world Australia and take out their aggression on the white race that took pity on them.</p>

					<p>The Sudanese taking advantage of &#8220;opportunities&#8221; and getting jobs? No they won&rsquo;t! They don&rsquo;t need jobs as the Aussie taxpayer thoughtfully provides for their many needs. In fact, they don&rsquo;t really know what jobs are because they don&rsquo;t have them in the Sudan. Instead, they have banditry and foreign aid!<br>
These liberals don&rsquo;t get it. A nation is not a multicultural social unit, it&rsquo;s a society bound by a common language, common beliefs, and a strong culture. A society that&rsquo;s diverse in ethnic, linguistic, religious, and cultural terms is not a nation: it&rsquo;s an <strong>empire</strong>. And empires don&rsquo;t exist any more because they implode after eventually being torn apart by internal dissension. This is why we don&rsquo;t now have a Roman Empire, or a British Empire, or an Ottoman Empire, or a <span class="caps">U.S.S.R., </span>or a Yugoslavia.<br><br>
If the liberals don&rsquo;t understand this important difference, the global corporations and the Marxists do. An atomized empire is much easier to exploit and control than a self-confident, homogeneous nation-state. </p>

<p>Yup just the right medicine, helped the Aboriginals too. Better idea may be to settle them in the middle of the dessert, thats what they are used to.</p>

					<p>That&rsquo;s horrible.  Why couldn&rsquo;t they learn from the disaster that is multiculturalism in America.  I don&rsquo;t know what their immigration policies are now, but I hope they can put a stop to allowing Third Worlders in there.  </p>
<p>Wherever they go in the world, barbarism and chaos follow.  They cannot be assimilated.</p>

					<p>Here we go again.  It&rsquo;s the same the world over when .</p>
<p>Now the criminal immigrants will be rewarded with incentives, as the government mouthpieces so explain. And who said that crime doesn&rsquo;t pay?</p>
<p>What the hell is it about government service in democratic countries?  Does such service cause mental illness?</p>
<p>Limit the current number of black immigrants due to their propensity for violence.  There is no place on this planet where blacks don&rsquo;t destroy the countries they move to or live in.</p>
<p>Next, deport those you currently have that break the law.  I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll readjust to the Sudan, their true homeland. </p>
<p>First and foremost, to the Australian government officials, protect your true citizens, those that have spent and sacrificed for generations buiding, civilizing, and establishing the country. </p>
<p>Somewhere and somehow, someone in the world will gather a critical mass of patriots in their still-democratic country and take it back. England and the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>are dead to p.c. madness so it will have to be some other nation who has a trace of dignity left. This insanity has got to end.  </p>

					<p>These Sudanese &#8220;men&#8221; should be fighting in their own home country of Sudan against the Arab-Muslim Sudanese invaders that are pillaging their towns, murdering the men and raping and enslaving their women and children. They are certainly free to go back there if they think they aren&rsquo;t being given an &#8220;opportunity&#8221; in Australia.</p>

					<p>There&rsquo;s a certain irony to this. The Housing Commission estates being complained about are in the Melbourne suburbs of Flemington and Carlton, which just happen to flank the University of Melbourne.</p>
<p>Last year, there was a spate of carjackings and muggings by the Sudanese from these estates in the university suburbs - crimes previously unusual in Melbourne. I wondered how the liberal academics at the university would respond to this.</p>
<p>Well the University of Melbourne researcher wants to send the Sudanese to Mildura and Sale, two of the most far-flung cities in the state. He could not have recommended anywhere more distant from his own campus.</p>
<p>So what do the academics really think about multiculturalism on their own doorstep?</p>

<p>&#8220;Caught up in&hellip;&#8221;?!  As though it fell from the sky and entrapped them like a net?  How about &#8220;&hellip;where young African men are committing crime in the streets&#8221;?  </p>
<p>Note the reference to &#8220;refugee families.&#8221;  African &#8220;refugees&#8221; are more accurately defined as &#8220;a band of murderers whose tribe is not in power at this particular moment.&#8221;  Hence, <span class="caps">ALL</span> Africans are - or will be - &#8220;refugees,&#8221; which entitles them to enter White countries in droves.  </p>
<p>We all know what&rsquo;s going on.  We&rsquo;re past asking &#8220;why&#8221;?  It&rsquo;s time to start asking &#8220;Who&#8221;?  </p>

					<p>Sad. There are many Sudanese in my community who are a shining credit to their race. They were one and all running for their lives in Sudan (largely for no other reason than being a Christian), and now work like dogs to establish a semi-normal life &#8216;over here&rsquo;. </p>
<p>Example: A former governor now works at meatpacking plants. (I can name him)</p>
<p>These Sudanese, let them stay. But any immigrants we allow in can be allowed right back where they came from if they start acting up.</p>

					<p>Do they ever adjust? Seems to me they expect the world to adjust to them! Yet Africans from Sudan, Somalia, Nigera, and elsewhere, are immigrating to every Western country on the map. Crime and aggression always follow, and their response is always the same wherever they are  &mdash;  to fault whites for not doing enough, and not providing enough! <strong>&ldquo;You entice them by giving them opportunities</strong> Just more opportunities to make demands by way of blackmail. How about a boat ride back home instead?</p>
