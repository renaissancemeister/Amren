					<p>Geert Wilders&rsquo;s movie wasnt as professional as espoused.<br>
Socialist ideology has a tendency to be plural.<br><br>
It is that very pluralism which allowed the Netherlands to envision a multiracial utopia only to face the reality of race and genetics in Holland and throughout Europe where Black Muslims are able to high tail and live in large populations.<br><br>
In short Geert wilder&rsquo;s movie sends a wakeup call to Europeans whose petty governments don&rsquo;t care how many White people die in their plan for a borderless Europe for wealthy elitists and Royal families whose long lived wealth has sent them on a new quest to monopolize human conscience.</p>

					<p>I watched the film and was disappointed.  First, as you can tell by looking at who the film calls victims, ie. gays, druggies, feminists and assorted lefties, you come away with the idea that Dutchmen like Wilders want the Muslims to go away so the Dutch can resume without interruption their &#8220;morality free zone.&#8221;  The problem of course is that you cannot fight fire without fire of your own.  The Europeans have nothing with which to rally their people.  After a half century of socialist permissiveness, Europeans have nothing left to defend.  They have already embraced multiculturalism and so cannot defend either their own race or culture.  They have turned away from religion and so have nothing with which to oppose Islam.  They have rejected nationalism, and so now cannot defend the concept of territorial integrity.  In short, unless Mr. Wilders is capable of regenerating the enthusiasm of his people for their own race, culture and territorial integrity, then I am afraid that trying to scare liberals with visions of belligerent Muslims is not going to work, and may if fact work against him.  I hope I am wrong, but I don&rsquo;t think Europeans can summon the will to save themselves.  The rot has gone on too long.</p>

					<p>The problem you people are focussed on is that you assume it to be a racial issue that Europe is facing, while in reality it is more of a religious/cultural. We are in a clash of cultures/civiliations no doubt. But people like Geert Wilders or Pim Fortuyn would be against Islam, regardless of it&rsquo;s from European Balkan Muslims, Swedish converts African refugees or Middle-Eastern immmigrants. It hardly matters. Islam is trying to reverse the European enlightenment which borught us liberty, freedom and individuality&hellip;and we must realize the foe in order to defend these rightous virtues.</p>

					<p>It&rsquo;s a start.  I fear that it detracts from the bigger picture of the threat that Europe faces: racial/ ethnic domination by non-white groups - regardless of religion.</p>
<p>How many people have been murdered by Muslim extremists over the last few years?  How many have been murdered by roving gangs of blacks?  I&rsquo;ll bet dollars to donuts that the later number is far greater.</p>

					<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if I agree with Wilders&rsquo; approach.  The basic premise of his argument is that Muslims are bad because they are intolerant of liberal Western ideals and that, if not for Islam, Ahmed and his seventeen children would blend into Dutch society perfectly.  These arguments are directed at winning over liberals which isn&rsquo;t going to happen.  Liberals are so thoroughly brainwashed that they will willingly sacrifice their nations on the altar of multiculturalism.  This film is basically a waste of time.  I have one question for Mr. Wilders: If all of these third world immigrants were Christians or atheists would you have a problem with immigration?  His answer seems as if it would be, no. <br>
 There is something fishy about Wilders; he rarely appears on television or gives interviews; he seems to care more about harrassing Muslims than doing anything productive; and he seems to be trying to turn the European &#8220;far right&#8221; into a pathetic version of the modern American conservative movement: a movement obsessed with terrorism and that denies the importance of race.  <br><br>
Islam is not the problem; it is the people who are practicing Islam who are the problem.  There are verses in the Bible which can seem very violent if taken out of context but most Christians are not even aware of these verses; the same is probably true of most Muslims.  The recently publicized remarks of Obama&rsquo;s pastor show that, in the hands of third world people, any religion can be twisted into a &#8220;hate whitey&#8221; abomination.</p>

I wonder what it will take to wake people up.</p>

<p>Perhaps Wilders has a different point to make by painting &#8220;gays, druggies, feminists and assorted lefties&#8221; as victims. It is the loony left that preaches cultural diversity and tolerance. I think that Wilders is trying to drive home the point to these people that their reward for being tolerant is, they will be the first to go. </p>
<p>Aaron Klein in his book &#8220;Schmoozing with Terrorists,&#8221; does an excellent job of making that point.</p>

					<p>As a European I think that we&rsquo;ve been too tolerant for too long. However the movie does not show the real problem. Terrorists and extremists only make up a relatively small amount of European muslims. The real goal is it to take over Europe peacefully. Our politicians have to understand it. We the people have already understood. This is just the beginning.</p>

					<p>Wilders, unlike Pim Fortuyn or Theo van Gogh or Ayaan Hirsi Ali is not a liberal, socialist, feminist, gay environmentalist. He is a devout Dutch Catholic. He was simply appealing to the more secular broader Dutch audience.</p>

					<p>WIlders has produced a very good propaganda film - and understand that &#8220;the truth is the best propaganda&#8221;. This movies presents the truth that non European (show racial/cultural images of these alien people) are very, very different from us, they are hostile, hateful, dangerous. Our tolerant values are understood by these hostile, hateful aliens as a sign of weakness, an invitation to flood in, take over our societies and change our ways, with their hostile, murderous ways.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good film. It&rsquo;s also true. I think it works a lot better than having some 75 year old LIbertarian guy run for President on a platform to end social security for elderly White people. I note that Ron Paul didn&rsquo;t mention radical Muslim extremists except to say that our foreign policy has upset them and they would be nice and peaceful to us if we just got our military out of all their countries. The elderly Ron Paul, Libertarian true believers seems not to have acknowledged the fact that the Muslims consider France, Spain and Birmingham England to soon to be &#8220;Their countries&#8221;. Well Ron Paul spent $60 million on his Libertarian campaign and won all of 16 delegates. Next time, patriots for Presidents might acknowledge 9/11/01, go to the scene of the declaration of war against our people/culture by the filthy, hateful, hostile Muslims and honor the 300 White fireman who gave their lives for us against &#8220;Them&#8221; on this holy day 9/11/01.</p>
<p>So yes, Geert Wilders&rsquo; film is very good, hits the heart and soul, throws in some fear to motivate our people to act. Do people think his film is better than the one we made: </p>
<p><a href="https://youtube.com/user/itsareligionofpeace" rel="nofollow">https://youtube.com/user/itsareligionofpeace</a></p>
<p>I think ours adds the element of humor, sarcasm - laughing at death which gives a good tough. If we are going to go down, let&rsquo;s do so with a smile on our lips and a wink in the eye.</p>

					<p>I&rsquo;m glad that there&rsquo;s been so much attention on AR given to Wilder&rsquo;s making of such a film. (We have to remember that many people that don&rsquo;t look at AR are still probably living with that cushy, idealistic, and happy-go-lucky mindset. They keep it on the back burner. Nothing so terrible and lifechanging could happen in their lifetime so why do anything to help.) I wish the controversy was broadcast more on the big media networks and in local news. I&rsquo;m thankful for Wilder being so pro-active. I won&rsquo;t complain until I can put forth the same effort. He&rsquo;s made more of an impact than I ever will. </p>
<p>Islam won&rsquo;t come close to taking over the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> Islam had to start with weaker countries first. Our seemingly white/weak government would be forced to step up and people would join together like they did for <span class="caps">WWII.</span> People would lay everything on the line to stop Islaminisation of the <span class="caps">U.S. </span></p>
<p>When 9/11 occurred, I heard plenty of blacks in this country say that it had nothing to do with them. Islam proabably hates blacks as much as Jews. They&rsquo;d have to learn real quick that they can&rsquo;t look to Obama for change. They&rsquo;d have to join forces with their &#8216;enemies&rsquo; of this land that they live on to defeat a bigger and more inconceiveable enemy.</p>

<p>I have much more respect for the muslims, at least they have a goal, to overthrow us by sheer numbers, and then use our democratic institutions to change the rules.</p>
<p>How can you have any respect for the current and past crop of politicians.</p>

					<p>      11:13-What you people don&rsquo;t understand is that race and<br>
culture are related. No one is going to save Western Culture but<br><br>
the people who created it-Whites. Is this such a weird or evil<br><br>
idea? Who will preserve Chinese Culture? Whites? Nigerians? No,<br><br>
just the Chinese themselves. And the same for us. Yes, culture is<br><br>
important. Everybody on the nature side of the nature/nurture<br><br>
split acknowledges this. The bigotry is on the nurture side. You<br><br>
people are the ones who deny one whole side of reality. This does<br><br>
have implications: anyone with a balanced viewpoint will end up<br><br>
on our side if truth is their only consideration. I grant you<br><br>
this is rare, but nothing less than the truth will save us from<br><br>
the barbarians at the gates. Actually, they&rsquo;re already inside.</p>

					<p>Now Wilders will be under a death edict fatwa along with the catoonists, various writers, apostates of Islam, and anyone else who points out the obvious: Islam is a virulent, deadly Religious-political ideology that will convert, kill or subjugate the passive, demographicaly declining host countries of Europe (and anywhere else they are strong enough).</p>

					<p>Xenophon, you make some great points about Europe having nothing to defend itself with against people who have not given up their sense of identity.  But I agree with Drifter that I think Wilders&rsquo; intention was to alarm the liberal segments of society into action.  Good luck with that.</p>
<p>Freyr, you&rsquo;re dead on.  Culture and identity are a function of race.  I don&rsquo;t think Swedish converts would do most of the things we&rsquo;re seeing Muslims doing in Europe today.  Conrad R. says: &#8220;Islam is not the problem; it is the people practicing Islam who are the problem.&#8221;  Yeah, and they&rsquo;re all from the third world.</p>

					<p>&#8220;This is not an adequate wake up call to the West to stop the spread of Islam I do not know what is.&#8221;<br>
Posted by MS<br><br>
  &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;      <br><br>
There was a time in history, not too long ago, when religious movements were  strictly controlled by governments. I am not advocating a return to that. But we are in a new phase of history now.</p>
<p>About two centuries ago, along with the idea of  democratic government, came the notion that religions should be unfettered, independent, unanswerable;  they should be allowed almost complete liberty to do as they like.  The former state religions gradually lost their official power.  This worked well in Europe and America   &mdash;   in those countries with western-style religions that tacitly recognized certain limits beyond which they wouldn&rsquo;t go.</p>
<p>But Islam is not a &#8220;western-style&#8221; religion!   It is a new introduction to the scene.  It slips through the cracks that were never intended to exist.  It does not abide by the civilized rules of western religions. It uses lies, deceit,  force, and terror to get its way. <span class="caps">ANYTHING </span>that advances the cause of  Islam is justifiable.  </p>
<p>Since it does not play by the rules, it should not be protected by the rules. It is (by its practitioner&rsquo;s own behavior)  an outlaw religion, a gangster religion - in the West at least -  and should be treated as such.  Obviously, other rules are needed for &#8220;other&#8221; religions that have contempt for our law and believe they are answerable only to their own law. We don&rsquo;t need them here.  We can&rsquo;t have them here! They are not part of the West, and they will destroy the West.</p>

					<p><i>It uses lies, deceit, force, and terror to get its way. <span class="caps">ANYTHING </span>that advances the cause of Islam is justifiable.</i></p>
<p>Islam is bent, as it always has been, on world domination. This is its historic mission. It was always so from the start. Anyone who attempts to argue otherwise is denying history.</p>
<p>It is essential   &mdash;   if we, the West, are to survive   &mdash;   that we recognize that it is a political movement much more than  a &#8220;religion&#8221;&hellip; certainly not a &#8220;religion&#8221; in the sense that we have always understood the word.</p>
<p>Otherwise, our tolerance will be our own undoing.</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p><i>But Islam is not a &ldquo;western-style&rdquo; religion!  It is a new introduction to the scene. It slips through the cracks that were never intended to exist. It does not abide by the civilized rules </i></p>
<p>An interesting scientific analogy strikes me. Islam, being a &#8220;new introduction to the scene&#8221;  reminds me of such recent alien imports as the snakehead fish, for one example among many.  All of them being catastrophic. The New Guines tree snake in Guam.  Burmese pythons in Florida,  African killer bees in Texas.  Zebra mussels  and sea lampreys in the Great Lakes.   These new biological introductions disrupt the local ecology and create havoc with nature.  There is no resistance to them. The local species are unprepared for them. They end up exterminating the native species and devouring everything in sight.</p>
<p>Are Moslems the equivalent to killer bees and zebra mussels, in human terms?  We had better develop some resistance to them pretty quick, or they will end up devouring and replacing <b><i>us! </i></b><br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  <br><br>
<i>  &#8220;In the Everglades, where there are no natural enemies, the snakes [pythons] can grow to 20 feet long&hellip;There are also increasing serious concerns about human safety as well, since the mammoth snakes are able to subdue and kill alligators, which are much stronger than human beings.&#8221; </i><br><br>
<i>  &#8220;The African clawed frog, native to Kenya, eats almost anything and breeds prolifically. It has completely taken over Lily Pond in San Francisco&rsquo;s Golden Gate Park, altering the ecosystem by eating insects, fish, and even birds!<br><br>
  &#8220;The growing threat from non-native species is a grim one. Invasive species are a leading cause of species endangerment and extinction worldwide. Almost half of the species on the endangered species list in the United States are there because of threats to their habitat from introduced species.  <b> Once invasive species are established, they are virtually impossible to eradicate&#8221;&hellip;</b></i><br><br>

					<p>Freyr And ghw I believe display the meat of the equation that is seminal to Amren&rsquo;s concern. Freyr contending that culture is the manifestation of race and ghw contending alien genetics invaiding native genetics disrupt native harmony. Both posters point to genetic contest for suvival/supremacy. <span class="caps">COMPETITION </span>is one thing not addressed in the theory of equality and indescrimanate unconditional love. This is the crux of the modern social dilema&hellip; how to be tolerant of diversity without destroying it, And who belongs where? A brain without a heart is a sterile machine, a heart without a brain  is a rutterless ship among reefs. The Love, that emotionalists ever praise, cannot exist without thorns to protect it in the real world as with roses. Tolerance minus the faculty of discrimination is a rose without thorns&hellip; and often among swine at that! At its seminal beginings human life struggles in a contest of thousands of spermazoa competing to maintain their own unique identity. Identity and competition seem to me inseperable qualities of life. Is nature wrong?</p>

					<p><b>In the real world, a rose cannot exist without thorns.</b></p>
<p>A very wise and thought-provoking comment from Petrarch!<br>
We would do well to take heed   &mdash;    while we can.</p>
<p>The &#8220;love&#8221; that is endlessly promoted by starry-eyed, naive idealists (and pandering politicians) sounds wonderful but is incapable of sustaining itself in the real world. Like the rose without thorns, it would soon disappear into the stomach of the first hungry ruminant that came along.</p>
<p>In the real world   &mdash;    in raw nature, &#8220;red in tooth and claw&#8221;   &mdash;   the rule is competition not kindness.  Eat or be eaten!  If you can&rsquo;t defend yourself, you will become some other creature&rsquo;s meal. And no one will shed a tear.</p>
<p>And if you can&rsquo;t defend your territory, it will become someone else&rsquo;s, no matter what guise they came in originally, whether &#8220;refugees&#8221; or anything else.</p>

					<p>While I do see the more intolerant forms of Islam as a threat, I don&rsquo;t think this is a racial issue.  The Iranians and Iraqis are racially very similar to Europeans.  Communism was also a threat, but the Russians who adhered to it were white like ourselves.  Race matters, but it&rsquo;s hardly the only thing that matters.<br>

<p>You are skewing the matter here and intentionally so, I suspect.  </p>
<p>Firstly, the founder of Islam was an Arab not an Iranian.</p>
<p>Secondly, the founder(s) of Marxism and Trotskyism were Jews not indigenous white Europeans.</p>
<p>Both cults were <span class="caps">FORCED </span>upon the populations you&rsquo;re comparing, ie, Islam upon the Iranians and Communism upon white Russians.</p>
<p>Race and culture are part of parcel of the same source.  In your examples this is not the case.<br>

<p>Oh, but it is!   Race accompanies ideology. </p>
<p>The astounding expansion of Islam in the 8th century meant the spread of the Arab&rsquo;s culture, language, and genes  everywhere their conquering armies went. </p>
<p>While  I agree that Islam is not specifically a race-oriented religion, nonetheless it will inevitably represent the majority of its adherents    &mdash;    particularly that of its founders.   The vast majority of them are non-white, or certainly non-European at least.   Thus it is, whether intentionally or not, a vehicle for their race and culture.   Wherever the &#8220;religion&#8221; goes, the genes follow and will come in hand-in-hand with the ideology, and their culture will prevail.</p>

					<p>&#8220;Oh, but it is!&#8221;</p>
<p>By that, I meant (as I see upon re-reading this)  that it <i>IS </i>a racial issue. But I did not mean to imply that it is the <span class="caps">ONLY </span>thing that matters.</p>
