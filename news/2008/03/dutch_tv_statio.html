						<p>BRUSSELS &mdash; Private and public television stations have refused to air the anti-Muslim film &#8220;Fitna&#8221; by Dutch politician Geert Wilders, fearing a violent backlash that prompted the government to raise its terror threat level yesterday.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had hoped that a television broadcaster would say: &lsquo;You have the right to do this, we will give you a podium&rsquo;,&#8221; he told Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad.</p>
<p>A Justice Ministry statement said, &#8220;While there are no concrete indications of impending attacks in the Netherlands, the increased international terrorism threat has prompted [us] to raise the threat level for the Netherlands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Wilders, who leads a small anti-immigration party, claims in his 15-minute film that the Koran is a fascist book and the basis of modern-day terrorism.</p>
<p>He set up a Web site (www.fitnathemovie.com) and tentatively scheduled an airing for the press on March 28, when he expects to post the movie online.</p>
<p>The Taliban has threatened to target 1,600 Dutch soldiers stationed in the country if the movie is shown.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The government is reluctant to set a precedent against freedom of expression, but is worried about a violent backlash and economic repercussions.</p>
<p>The film has provoked official condemnations from Iran, Bangladesh and Pakistan and sparked several demonstrations in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The Taliban announced on its Web site that it will not tolerate the &#8220;Crusader war&#8221; waged through &#8220;Fitna&#8221; and the reprinted Danish cartoons of the prophet Muhammad.</p>

			<p>Well, well, well. First France surrendered to Islam, and now Holland.</p>
<p>Again, I ask the same question. Would this all be happening if the Germans won the war?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the question. Had Germany won, the white race would be defending itself. Since Germany lost, the white race is in the stages of extermination. </p>
<p>The Chancellor of Germany even said the war was for the future of the white race, but we are not allowed to know that.</p>

			<p>There was a South Park episode that showed Jesus defecating on an American flag - it was shown because it was determined that an animation showing Allah shaking hands with Peter Griffon from Family Guy would provoke violence.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t see how anyone who belongs to a &#8220;religion of peace&#8221; could riot over cartoons and teddy bears and threated violence over a 15 minute movie.  </p>

			<p>I keep on saying this -  but no one listens -run a herd of pigs throughout all muslim neighborhoods&hellip;.complain, when they make all that noise&hellip;and YES it is noise&hellip;five times a day to calll all those Mohammedans to prayer. Play rap music loudly. If that doesn&rsquo;t drive them back home I don&rsquo;t know what will.<br>
SHOW THE MOVIE IN THE MAIN SQUARES OF YOUR TOWNS AND CITIES WHERE THEY LIVE! Happy days will soon arrive. They can&rsquo;t fight you all. We must fight back ladies and gents! Now is the time for all good men and women to come to the aid of their country!!!! </p>

			<p>The excellent docu-movie &#8220;The Boy Who Played Among the Buddhas&#8221; provides some measure of the Taliban&rsquo;s unfathomable level of medieval intolerance for everything non-Muslim.  The word &#8220;Taliban&#8221; means &#8220;student&#8221; and they are radicalized in Pakistan and financed by the Saudi Royal Family.  Tyrants the world over always exploit the ignorance and idealism of youth to recruit armies of zealots to do their bidding.  Should you ever happen to face their ilk in our country do not let their tender age stay your hand nor cloud your aim when faced with the task of obliterating these wretched rabid jackals&hellip;        </p>

			<p>The Dutch unfortunately have a history of bending in the wind.  The Netherlands would probably not exist today if that weren&rsquo;t so. The differrence is that now they are faced with an implacable problem that will keep coming at them regardless of much they give in.</p>

			<p>Playing Devil&rsquo;s Advocate here for a minute, what do you think would happen if someone tried to air/produce/publish an anti-Semitic movie/cartoon/article?&hellip;or call, jokingly, a bunch of black girls &#8220;nappy-headed&#8221; hoes? </p>
<p>Personally, I find the &#8220;free-speech&#8221; argument as a license to publish/produce/air offensive materials about muslims a little hypocritical.  Not because it shouldn&rsquo;t be published/produced/aired, but because we CLEARLY have a double standard.  In Europe, you can go to jail for denying the Holocaust. </p>

			<p>There is no such thing as happy Muslims at this time in history. Until the entire world is Muslim and dragged back to the 6th century there never will be a happy Muslim. The Muslim world is as corrupt and evil as anything this planet has ever seen and I know what I am talking about, I am in my 5th year in the middle east mess. I am not a christian but I have pretty much come to hate the Muslim faith and fear for my country if we continue to bow to the religiously correct panderers to the Muslims. I don&rsquo;t think Holland should kick them out, they should be killed and we are about to see a bunch of that in the emerging &#8220;Muslim republic of Kosovo&#8221; Go SERBS woooohooooo<br>
