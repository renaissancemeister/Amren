						<p>Work-van drivers signaled long before their turns to avoid being pulled over for a traffic violation. Day laborers skipped their early morning coffee at 7-Eleven, and merengue tunes played to empty tables at Latino lunch counters across Prince William County yesterday.</p>
<p>It was the first day of a county ordinance that allows police to check people&rsquo;s immigration status for even minor legal infractions.</p>
<p>Police officials pledged to enforce the law fairly and to not stop and question individuals based on their racial or ethnic appearance, but many Hispanic residents said they feared they would be stopped without reason and deported for such violations as driving without a valid license or having a broken taillight.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Immigrant advocate groups, speaking at a community meeting Sunday in Woodbridge and on local Spanish-language radio stations, have been advising immigrants without legal papers to keep a low profile and obey all traffic rules. If stopped by police, the groups said, they should be polite and show some identification but otherwise remain silent until they can see a lawyer.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>County Police Chief Charlie T. Deane, speaking to reporters yesterday, said that his officers would &#8220;continue to enforce the law in a fair, lawful and reasonable manner&#8221; and that they have been trained &#8220;very carefully&#8221; to conduct immigration checks. The new measures are expected to cost $26 million over five years, and Deane has asked county officials for an additional $3 million to install video cameras in every patrol car and monitor them to ensure proper procedures are followed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Legal and illegal immigrants yesterday expressed the belief &mdash; some with sadness, others with indignation &mdash; that the law is part of a larger effort to drive Hispanics out of the county. Santos Perdomo, 38, a legal resident who owns a business and two houses in Prince William, said he had always donated to the county police charity fund. Now, he said, he no longer feels like giving.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even though I am legal, I feel rejected,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This law has ruined all the good feelings. When I came here 12 years ago, my neighbors sent me pies. Now they look at me differently.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perdomo said that many Hispanics are leaving the county but that he plans to stay. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t want to teach my children to be bitter,&#8221; he said.</p>

			<p>By Mr. Perdomo&rsquo;s own admission, Americans are not the racist xenophobes he implies, for he was greeted with pies and hellos. His own goodwill for America, however, is contingent on our allowance of law-breaking: he likes America so long as all Mexicans are indiscriminately allowed to enter and settle here, thus proving he does not love the country as it is but only on his own terms.  If he is legal why does he feel rejected? - Because his alliance is not to America but to his people, whom he still considers compatriots, whether legal or not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even though I am legal, I feel rejected,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This law has ruined all the good feelings.</p>
<p>Rejection noted. Had &#8216;legal&rsquo; hispanics been Americans first instead of racists first, they would have spoken out against the criminals.  Instead, they have aided and abetted the ongoing invasion and criminal enterprise, choosing to take sides with our enemies and against the laws of the very country they would like to call &#8216;home&rsquo;. Can&rsquo;t have it both ways.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t got any allegiance to America beyond enjoying the benefits, then you are rejected. If you don&rsquo;t comprehend devotion to the Constitution and the responsibility it imposes on free citizens, then you are rejected. For those who will not comply with our laws, then legal or not, get out. Good riddance. </p>

<p>This kind of squashes any idea that legal Hispanics are just as tired of the illegal ones as any other American.  So what would they be bitter about?  That the government deported their illegal alien friends?  That&rsquo;s a reason for AMERICA to be bitter with THEM, the ones who SNEAK INTO THIS COUNTRY.  You befriend illegal criminals at your own risk, so don&rsquo;t be bitter when they finally get arrested.  That almost sounds like a racist black idea!</p>

<p>Well boo hoo Santos, cry me a river.  I&rsquo;m an immigrant and yet I don&rsquo;t feel rejected, and no-one&rsquo;s looking at me differently. I wonder why&hellip; could it be that the vast majority of European immigrants are LEGAL! as compared with the millions of Hispanics.<br>
I have to say though that I&rsquo;m feeling a tad bitter that I&rsquo;ve never been given pies by any of my neighbours.<br>

<p><br>
Illegal immigrants are NOT being deported because of a broken taillight   &mdash;   they are being deported because they are illegal immigrants. They broke the law when they jumped the fence   &mdash;   and they break further laws when they do work for pay on our side of that fence. </p>
<p>Their very presence here is against the law. We know it, and they know it, too. Everybody knows it   &mdash;   except the pinheads in the liberal media who write misleading stories like this. </p>
<p>May ALL their taillights burn out at once! <br>

<p>Here we go again with a manipulative play on words. Nobody is driving out &#8220;hispanics&#8221;, they are driving out ILLEGALS who are breaking the law and have NO right to be here.</p>

<p>Well, Mr.Perdomo, don&rsquo;t blame americans for wanting to control their borders, blame your fellow hispanics who are mexican citizens and break the law. Whom do you expect americans to target, all of the illegal Germans coming across the border? Anyway, if you feel dejected perhaps you should go back to Mexico, then you won&rsquo;t feel dejected anymore.</p>

<p>Boo hoo, Santos.  By the way; did you ever thank your formerly pie-wielding neighbors for the VERY generous discounted loans, grants, and subsidies you received from them - via the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and U.S. Small Business Administration - thereby enabling you to start and maintain your businesses with significant long-term competitive advantages unavailable to your neighbors?  </p>

			<p>The very idea that the current backlash against this illegal tidalwave is somehow motivated by a general animus toward &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; is absolute nonsense and they ALL know it! We are talking about a human flood that is literally and drastically changing the demographics, character and cultures of entire towns and smaller cities driven almost entirely by illegal, illiterate, unskilled, uneducated Mestizo invaders!!    </p>

			<p>Well, no problem for the Latinos in Prince William then  &mdash;   all they need do, is come to California, Arizona and New Mexico where they&rsquo;re already a majority in much of the state, and they&rsquo;ll be just peachy.  Besides, Jorge Bush has made absolutely sure that US immigration laws have absolutely no teeth, and since big business calls all the shots, there is no way to combat them.  We, the people, of course get sold out.</p>
<p>If anything, this probably suggests how the USA is going to partition down the road.  Frustrated Whites are leaving states like Arizona, California and New Mexico by the millions every year, and increasingly settling in places like Indiana, Prince William and Idaho that aren&rsquo;t already inundated with the 3rd World, and which have enacted statutes to keep it that way.  Some even seem to be picking up stakes and moving to Euro countries like Italy, France or Germany if they have ancestors there.  </p>
<p>But no self-respecting Euro-American wants to remain in a state like Arizona or California that has already become little more than a replica of a Central American banana republic.  Pretty soon, 50% of the population in states like Idaho and Montana will consist of ex-Californians and Arizonans!</p>

			<p>We&rsquo;ve been seeing signs of whites fighting back against the invasion of our nation and destruction of our culture.  There still is hope, and lots of it.</p>
<p>This reversal I see with illegals is hilarious.  They&rsquo;ve poured over our borders by the millions and laugh at us behind our backs, even going so far as to say they&rsquo;re reconquering our territory.  Then the minute whites begin to act against them, they go crawling to the press, sniveling and crying crocodile tears of racism because their law breaking endeavors were ended.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s either a big farce, or the illegal Mexicans aren&rsquo;t as fearless and &#8220;street tough&#8221; as we&rsquo;re led to believe. </p>

That is disgraceful and outrageous beyong words!  It is time that the politicians come to understand that this issue now goes BEYOND a mere question of amnesty for the alien invaders of our country, but that THEY, the POLITICIANS, are facing demands for their IMPEACHMENT and CONVICTION for their treasonous betrayal of their oath of office and of the citizens who put them there.  It seems that only when they realize that this issue is going to touch THEM will they ever get the message that the public is thoroughly FED UP!<br>

			<p>Those that support, help &amp; hire illegals are aiding in the commission of a crime against our country. They should be jailed and dealt with appropriately by the judicial system. Leaders of splinter groups like La Raza need to be arrested for assisting &amp; supporting illegals. If most of us hide &amp; help a criminal we will be arrested for assisting them. Our laws are clear cut on this matter.</p>

			<p>I suggest Americans build a facsimile of our Statue of Liberty and place it on our boarder with Mexico facing across the Rio Grande into Mexico.  Instead of holding aloft a torch she will hold aloft her right hand with the middle finger extended.  The plaque at the statue&rsquo;s base will read:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do not want your tired, because we are tired of you.  </p>
<p>We do not want your poor, because you parasites are making us poor.  </p>
<p>We do not want your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, because you seek our money not your freedom.    </p>
<p>We do not want the wretched refuse of your teeming shore, because if your country doesn&rsquo;t want them why should ours?  </p>
<p>We do not want your homeless and tempest tossed, because we have enough of our own.  </p>
<p>I lift my middle finger to you residing across the Rio Grande in a gesture of warning and contempt.  Stay home and solve your own problems, because all that awaits you and your families in our country is deportation or an untimely demise&hellip;&rdquo;<br>

			<p>  Technically I qualify for the Hispanic label. I can speak Spanish, not Mexican but real Spanish, and several other languages besides English.<br>
  The real problem is that the illegal immigrants have been allowed to use the racism charge for too long and activist judges and members of Congress have defied the will of the people they were elected by and pledged to serve in favor of cheap labor for businesses which contribute heavily to their campaigns and hire them if they leave Congress.<br>
  Now there are &#8220;legal&#8221; members of the families of illegal immigrants because they have children born here and they are presumed to be citizens although the Constitutional Amendment which is cited did not intend to allow citizenship unless the parents were legally admited Judges have deemed the welfare of the child more important than the ancient principle of the law that the rewards (or proceeds, benefits, or plunder) along with everything it is used to buy or build could never be retained by the theif or law breaker.  The parents should be deported and bared from returning forever without exception.<br>
   Most pro-illegal immigrant groups now claim that breaking up families with legal and illegal members cannot be done. <br>
   Would a lawyer among the readers please tell me why this is not aiding and abetting in a crime or after a crime ?<br>
   Why are politicians not charged with malfeasance and fraud with public funds when they vote benefits and assistance to illegal aliens ?<br>
   Why are states which have allowed drivers licenses to be issued without checking for citizenship not charged with voter fraud since motor voter laws allow the illegals who obtain a license without a citizenship check to vote ?<br>
   There are many more problems ?<br>
   Where is the legal defense organization to protect our rights ? <br>

			<p>The sense of entitlement by illegals, mostly Hispanic, is amazing. They, and their supporters in Washington, feel they should have a pass on the following because they &#8220;only come for jobs:&#8221;<br>
1. Border jumping<br>
2. Giving false names<br>
3. Presenting false documents<br>
4. Stealing SS numbers</p>
<p>I know at least a couple of those must be felonies.If Americans commit felonies, they go to prison. Illegals get rewarded with a job and lifelong benefits for their families. When did it become okay to be a criminal if you&rsquo;re poor? We also know that there is a payoff somewhere. Wonder how it&rsquo;s accomplished?</p>

<p>People can tolerate and even welcome some level of diversity. One legal, respectful hispanic family moving on my street might add a point of interest. However, when one family becomes 10, when you have packs of latinos hanging out at the playground or corner all times of the day and night, when your local grocery market starts putting ups signs saying &#8216;we accept food stamps&rsquo; in spanish, when you read in the city paper that two &#8216;hispancs&rsquo; beat up a 82 year old man in his home during the course of a robbery, when cars and vans with Puerto Rican flags hanging from the rear view mirrors PARK ON THE SIDEWALK, the average person might begin to look at these cumulative problems and equate them with the growing hispanic population and no longer feel all that friendly anymore.</p>
<p>One hispanic can be your friend. 100 can be an invasion.<br>

			<p>mmigrant advocate groups, speaking at a community meeting Sunday in Woodbridge and on local Spanish-language radio stations, have been advising immigrants without legal papers to keep a low profile and obey all traffic rules. If stopped by police, the groups said, they should be polite and show some identification but otherwise remain silent until they can see a lawyer.&#8221;</p>
<p>This mnetality presumes they are:</p>
<p>Morally permitted to be here as squatters<br>
Legally permitted to work here as illegal aliens<br>
constitutionally protected as citizens, when they are not<br>
societally desirable as citizens, which clearly is not the case.</p>
<p>It is time that Americans say to these aliens that which has been said to the &#8216;non-European.&rsquo;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Legal and illegal immigrants yesterday expressed the belief &mdash; some with sadness, others with indignation &mdash; that the law is part of a larger effort to drive Hispanics out of the county.&#8221;</p>
<p>- Not Hispanics, illegals! This substituting of race with legal status is either a confusion of logic from a fearful timid soul - or deliberate ongoing misinformation (pro-illegal propaganda) generated by the reporter - the idea being to make simple law enforcement appear like heartless persecution to his readers. </p>

			<p>The very idea that the current backlash against this illegal tidalwave is somehow motivated by a general animus toward &ldquo;Hispanics&rdquo; is absolute nonsense and they ALL know it! We are talking about a human flood that is literally and drastically changing the demographics, character and cultures of entire towns and smaller cities driven almost entirely by illegal, illiterate, unskilled, uneducated Mestizo invaders!! </p>
<p> This is what happened forty years ago: <br>
 <br>
INSA proponents in 1964-1965 denied that the law would result in increased numbers of immigrants, legal and illegal. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., was the Democratic floor manager of the legislation and chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee during the Senate debate on the Hart-Celler Bill. Sen. Kennedy said:<br>
 <br>
&#8220;First our cities will not be flooded with a million immigrants annually. Under the proposed bill, the present level of immigration remains substantially the same &hellip; </p>
<p>&#8220;Secondly, the ethnic mix of this country will not be upset &hellip; Contrary to the charges in some quarters, [the bill] will not inundate America with immigrants from any one country or area &hellip; The bill will not flood our cities with immigrants. It will not upset the ethnic mix of our society. It will not relax the standards of admission. It will not cause Americans workers to lose their jobs &hellip;.&#8221; </p>
<p>Kennedy co-sponsored last June&rsquo;s amnesty bill with John McCain.</p>

That is exactly what has happened in my small Washington town, and that&rsquo;s precisely why I sold both my houses and moved before the invasion got even worse. The mexicans invaded my town, took over the drug trade from the downscale whites, and committed eight (8) drive by shootings last summer alone.  Each of the reported drive by shootings, by the way, were committed against whites  &mdash;  clearly skirmishes in a gang turf/drug distribution war.  This town, allegedly inhabited by tough loggers, rolled over and took this invasion without a whimper of protest.<br>

			<p>As a Leftist and an anti-racist, this is difficult for me to say but I will say it anyway.</p>
<p>Not all immigrant groups are created equal. If we had 12 million illegal Chinese or Europeans in this country, I do not know we would be so worried.</p>
<p>The truth is very painful. The pro-immigrants are correct! This is NOT just about illegals. It IS about Hispanics. We don&rsquo;t like Hispanics too much. Let&rsquo;s just admit it. The reason has nothing to do with xenophobia. The sad truth is that Hispanics are not a very high quality immigrant group. Full stop. Towns with large Hispanic populations inevitably develop terrible problems. Once you get over 60% Hispanic, almost any town gets dirty, trashy, run-down, overcrowded, crime goes way up, there is a proliferation of gangs and graffiti is everywhere. In particular, there seems to be a huge amount of small scale thievery, drug sales and sex crimes. So it is the behavior of Hispanic immigrants, and to a lesser extent the Hispanics themselves, that makes them so disliked.</p>
<p>A large sector of Hispanics is assimilating to US society and doing well. Another large group has sunken into an Underclass that looks a lot like the Black Underclass, but is not nearly so bad.</p>
<p>They have brought all this rage on themselves by not being a very well-behaved ethnic group.</p>
<p>Hispanic immigrants must be screened like any other immigrants. The insanity of illegal immigration is that these folks are unscreened. They could all be ax murderers for all we know. Then the solution is just to legalize all of these unscreened immigrants in one fell swoop. Utter insanity!!!!!!</p>

			<p>Kellie, you could not be more right. Human beings have a mental inertia, a kind of hardwiring of the brain, if you will, that is so treacherous, that it often works against peoples very survival. Take for instance, the field of medicine. We have seen hundreds of thousands, if not millions of times, that standard cancer therapy, for most cancers, DOES NOT WORK. Yet people trust doctors implicitly and follow orders even when the doctor has just told them that with such and such a therapy, you will survive another six months, more or less. I just read that there is now evidence that treating prostate cancer with the &#8220;accepted&#8221; protocols probably spreads it thourghout the body.<br>
Yet, millions will not be influenced by this.</p>
<p>If millions of people are not willing to try alternative therapies, even in conjunction with standard ones when the situation is clearly grim, than we can see that in the murky area of politics, even less people feel threatened and cannot believe that it may be possible that our country has a cancer and we need alternative therapy  &mdash;  in the form of, as you point out, Dr. Ron Paul, Congressmans Tancredo, Hunter, etc. As some people might also say, we live comfortably with our illnesses, as long as they don&rsquo;t kill us. Obviously the conscious brain does not guide us as much as we believe. The leaders who are successful appeal to our subconscious motivations, unfortunatley.</p>

<p>Of course.  There&rsquo;s no doubt in my mind. </p>
<p>One of the characteristics of our times, and I mean since September 11th, is that the behavior of the Power Elite is more brazen, blatant, and shameless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as if they know we know and are rubbing our faces in it.  </p>
<p>Listening to the Power Elite talk amongst themselves leaves one with the feeling you may have had as a child while in the presence of adults engaged in conversation.  Since you weren&rsquo;t an adult they would never pay attention to you and you could never get a word in.</p>
<p>The only problem with this analogy is that it has to be applied to the Inverted World we live in today, ie; WE&rsquo;RE the Adults being ignored and THEY are the f-ing Children!  Big, overgrown, overfed, self-indulgent, spoiled rotten Children, with lots and lots of money and WAY too much power; certainly more than they know what to do with.</p>
<p>Look at Bill Clinton, GW Bush, in Politics, or Bill Gates in Business and many others one could mention and ask yourself if they don&rsquo;t strike you as oversized boys begging to be grounded -for life!</p>

			<p>Talking about &#8220;White flight&#8221; from SOCAL and other areas, WHY? This is OUR country. Why should Whites be forced to flee? To move away from these people?</p>
<p>The poster pointing out our &#8220;dislike&#8221; for Hispanics is mainly right. That &#8220;dislike&#8221; is based on the crime, the social problems, stolen jobs, etc., etc. BY HISPANICS! All true, real and so verifiable! Unfortunately the Puerto Ricans, as pointed out by one poster, are just as despicable, thanks to their crimes, their attitude. Like the poster said; the Hispanics brought it on themselves by their insufferable behavior!</p>
<p>If you want to claim the illegal Haitians, Chinese, Indians, Pakistanis and Africans should be cracked down on as well, I concur. We, as a people, have the right to want to live among our own kind. We should NOT have to endure third-worlders and the mentality and lifestyle they insist on bringing with them.</p>
<p>We Whites built America. With hard work. With careful management of our resources and funds.  So why should we complacently sit back and allow the third worlders to invade us at will?</p>

<p><br>
I&rsquo;ll go you one better, Mr. Lindsay: Hispanics are not a very high quality RACE. Full stop. </p>
<p>You are white. And   &mdash;   as much as you might try to deny it or shake it off   &mdash;   you have white standards, white expectations, and white levels of ambitiousness. The mixed-blood, predominantly-Indian peoples who now have you surrounded, have standards substantially lower than your own. </p>
<p>The high-tech, fully-functional, &#8220;First-World&#8221; California you grew up in was the direct result of the brilliance and perseverence of millions your white ancestors. The primitive, dysfunctional, &#8220;Third-World&#8221; Mexifornia you now inhabit is the direct result of the dullness, the dumbness, the reckless breeding habits, and the &#8220;manana&#8221; attitude of millions upon millions of low-IQ brown people dragging this once-grand state down to pathetic, corrupt, Mexican levels. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what millions and millions of Mexicans in one place DO: they turn that place into Mexico. It&rsquo;s all they CAN do; it&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re programmed for. Why would anyone expect anything else? If these people were capable of any more, we surely would have seen some evidence of it by now. </p>
<p>California used to be a magical, mythical paradise that was envied the world over. A symbol of the vanguard of human achievement. Mexico has never been anything but a slum. A disaster area. A sick joke masqerading as a nation. &#8220;God&rsquo;s blind-spot.&#8221; </p>
<p>Once upon a time, it was commonly supposed that the general, continent-wide rise in prosperity would eventually uplift Mexico and make it more like America. It&rsquo;s now painfully clear that the transformation will be in the opposite direction, with America being dragged down to Mexican levels. </p>
<p>You call yourself &#8220;a Leftist and an anti-racist.&#8221; Something tells me you won&rsquo;t be either of these things much longer. The evidence of your own eyes and ears will be too plentiful to ignore   &mdash;   and the resulting cognitive-dissonance will be too painful to bear. The ugly realities of racial differences are eroding your sophomore idealism. </p>
<p>You are learning that the world isn&rsquo;t like Boas and Fanon and your groovy hippie college professors told you it was. You are learning that your fellow Lefties have LIED to you   &mdash;   and that mean old &#8220;uncool&#8221; caucasian conservatives like Jared Taylor are not only on your side, but might even SAVE YOUR LIFE someday. </p>
<p>You are, however belatedly, growing up. <br>

			<p>Hello, ISWM.</p>
<p>As far as Leftist, that mostly means economics. I don&rsquo;t really care about race or ethnicity or gender or orientation or identity or any social issues all that much. </p>
<p>One of the reasons this WN movement is such a failure is because they equate Left = anti-White. This is not really the case, but you guys have written them all out of the game. All I see is rightwing everything in here, and especially economics. At the same time, there is anti-corporate stuff. Talk about cognitive dissonance.</p>
<p>The word anti-racist has been damaged. An anti-racist can take pride in their race - I do. They can also oppose anti-White measures and unlimited immigration. All anti-racist means is that you treat each human being as an individual that is worthy of respect no matter the race, as long as they are pleasant and harmless. That&rsquo;s all. The vast majority of you guys are separatists, so you are incapable of such basic decency. Another reason the WN movement is such a failure.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care what the origin of the troubles with unlimited Hispanic immigration is. It&rsquo;s really not a problem for the group, but only due to the unrestricted nature of it. We do not have any problems with Latin Americans, Costa Ricans or Panamanians in the US, yet we have huge numbers of them living here. Filipinos and Africans have done superbly here, as they are very closely screened. Such ought to be the way with all immigrants to this land. Problems with Samoans, Puerto Ricans, etc. is that they are unrestricted. Also, refugees often become a problem because they are impoverished and we let them in pretty unrestrictedly. Examples are Salvadorans, Lao, Hmong, Khmer, Sudanese, Somalis and Haitians. The SE Asians have not been so much of a problem, but they do form gangs.</p>
<p>Limited intelligently and carefully screened, Mexicans should be no more of a problem in the US than Costa Ricans or Panamanians.</p>
