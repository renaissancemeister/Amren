<p>Julie Rios said she has received verbal and written warnings for talking in her native language, even though, she said, she was not informed about the rule when she was hired.</p>
<p>Rios, who was hired by temp company CoWorx, has been working at a North Texas plant for 10 months. But in February, she was issued a written warning about speaking Spanish.</p>
<p>The memo issued by CoWorx read: &#8220;You are being issued your first written warning for not adhering to company policy by speaking English only when communicating with others on the production floor.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She said supervisors have been cracking down and told her she could not say &#8220;hola,&#8221; but &#8220;hi.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Foxconn is a minority-owned international company with numerous locations throughout the Americas, Europe and Asia. Due to the extensive diversity of the company and the great plethora of languages spoken at our various global locations, it is necessary to ensure that business meetings are conducted in a consistent language to ensure solid communication between all parties and avoid any potential misunderstandings.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s right. I have the right to speak whatever language I want &hellip; They knew we were Mexicans,&#8221; [Rios] said. &#8220;They shouldn&rsquo;t have hired Mexican people.&#8221;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s absolutely correct&hellip;.we shouldn&rsquo;t hire mexican people. I think more and more employers are beginning to get the same idea.</p>

You&rsquo;re right, they shouldn&rsquo;t have hired Mexican people.</p>

					<p>Oops Ms. Rios!  If only if it were so simple!  I imagine you&rsquo;d be the first to sue (and you&rsquo;d win) if you were turned down a job for being a Mexican.</p>

<p>Insubordination&hellip;with attitude!</p>
<p>How many employees dictate to their employer which rules they intend to follow? Try it. Fastest path to becoming an ex-employee. </p>
<p>They knew we were Mexicans,&rdquo; [Rios] said. &ldquo;They shouldn&rsquo;t have hired Mexican people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Triple play. Fire Julie. Deport her. Arrest her employer.<br>

					<p>She is totally right, should never have hired Mexican people. They are hard to work with, treat all non-Hispanics like dirt and talk about them in Spanish like they are not there. </p>

					<p>I have colleagues who Speak Spanish to each other. I also speak it and am aware that they aren&rsquo;t saying anything negative about co-sorkers but as a common courtesy to those who don&rsquo;t understand it, I think that, in the workplace, they should refrain from using it.<br>
I had neighbors who were Russian immigrants. They would speak with their friends and relatives in English but when my wife and I would come out, they would immediately switch to Russian. What were we supposed to think?</p>

					<p>Remember the <span class="caps">UGLY AMERICAN, </span>where one of our own spoke English when traveling abroad (and spending our dollars there)? We were told to blend in.  So what about the <span class="caps">UGLY ALIEN</span>?  Insisting they speak their foreign languages here?  We need to confront them, and if they come back at us, stand firm.  Yes, more employers are understanding these people make bad workers with bad attitudes towards others.  Service with a sneer.</p>

					<p>This is not new to a New Yorker or a Chicagoan who has live around dozens of other cultures, all of his or her life.  My personal favorite is when two older Jewish ladies get into a heated discussion and mix in Yiddish&hellip;hillarious theatre at it&rsquo;s best.</p>

					<p>My suggestion is to learn a few phrases in whatever language and when you hear others speaking in that language and it reaches a sort of crescendo, insert something like - &#8220;I know what that means!&#8221; - or &#8220;That&rsquo;s a terrible thing to say!&#8221;  They get embarassed and usually either move away from you or just break up.</p>

					<p>I wonder if it has ocurred to the outraged yet that &#8221; when communicating with others on the production floor&rdquo; indicates a safety hazard? I mean I don&rsquo;t know what this plant makes but assembly lines are dangerous and everyone working them needs to speak the same language so they can all be appraised of dangers around the machinery   &mdash;   sort of like how all pilots speak English when calling the tower.<br>

					<p>actually this seems a bit extreme, saying that you should never speak your own language is too harsh. You should not exclude others though. </p>

					<p>This company needs to put this in writing and tell employees it will be fully enforced.  Kudos to them for finally taking a stand, hopefully more businesses will follow.  In fact, there needs to be a list of businesses that are pro-American, pro-English language so patriots such as us can support them.  We all know that the liberal media will do all they can to ensure that they are boycotted and shut down. </p>

					<p>Double standards here, at least for Milwaukee. The languages I hear, in order of occurrence daily are :  Spanish, Russian, Polish, other slav. languages, English,Hebrew, Yiddish, Somali. How you would police this I don&rsquo;t know, except maybe to accept the fact that Uncle Sam doesn&rsquo;t give a rats ass about who lives here just as long as some fat cat gets his fingers burned as the foreigner comes on in the back door.</p>

					<p>Taurus689 I worked with many hispanics who talked Spanish around you on the job. You could often tell by just looking at their eyes, that they were saying something about you sometimes. It&rsquo;s rude in the extreme when you know that some of the person(s) around you do not speak Spanish.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this is part of the reconquista plan. Why in the world do some Americans think groups like La Raza, Lulac, Mecha,etc. object so strenously to assimilation, and they do, even though they say they don&rsquo;t. Their lying. Once enough people speak spanish, do Americans really think that those Spanish speakers are going to inconvenience themselves, especially if it gives them an advantage, and be polite and speak English. I have a beautiful piece of land I&rsquo;d like to sell you that is &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.etc.</p>

					<p>Here&rsquo;s a bit of news: in the early 1900&rsquo;s there was a farm in Minnesota owned by Swedish immigrants. While their children were growing up they needed to hire hands to help work the farm.  They hired Swedes but they forbade them from speaking Swedish during the week. They demanded that their workers speak <span class="caps">ENGLISH ONLY </span>so they would improve their English language skills. The workers could speak Swedish <span class="caps">ONLY</span> ON <span class="caps">SUNDAYS.</span> If the man knew no English, he got no job from this family. Instead, he was directed to a school where he could learn English. After learning English he could work for the family if he still needed employment. A true story. </p>

					<p>I&rsquo;ve only visited the the <span class="caps">USA </span>twice (once New York, once <span class="caps">D.C.</span>) but it&rsquo;s pretty clear to me that America is turning into a Spanish-speaking nation. Here in the UK the <span class="caps">ATM</span>s and train ticket machines don&rsquo;t start by asking which language you want - the instructions are in English only. But in the US it seems Spanish is almost a necessity, to talk to bus drivers, hotel maids etc. I made the effort to learn a few phrases and they seemed to appreciate it.</p>

					<p>A small karate school was run by a family of Korean immigrants. A local man of European descent earned a black belt from the school, and was asked to teach a class.</p>
<p>Previous to this, all the conversations between the people running the school were in Korean. When the European stepped up to teach the class, he was assisted by the two young teenage sons of the owner. They were slouching and he started berating them in fluent Korean, which he had learned when stationed in Korea, and which the school owners had no idea he knew.</p>
<p>After teaching that one class, the man of European descent was never allowed in the building again.</p>

					<p>Ms. Rios is right she can speak any langauge she likes, at home.<br>
English only is the National Business Language.  Meaning at <span class="caps">WORK</span><br><br>
one politician said it clearly English on the <span class="caps">JOB </span>and any business transacton.  He went on to say a person can speak any <br><br>
language they wish AT <span class="caps">HOME.</span></p>
