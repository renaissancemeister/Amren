<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Recently, a number of children&rsquo;s films have been retelling the story of the Indian princess Pocahontas, the English settler Captain John Smith, and the founding of Jamestown in 1607. In many ways, these events mark the beginning of America, and the beginning of the catastrophic loss of a continent for the Indians.</p>
<p>Pocahontas was a liberal. Her theory of permissive immigration as the route to peace was in sharp contrast to that of the braves in her tribe. They, too, favored peace, but the kind that flows from the separation of nations by an ocean of water. They wanted to defend their land by chasing the Europeans into the sea.</p>
<p>Pocahontas believed that men of good will from diverse nations could dwell in peace in the same land. Her vision of a pluralistic society required just one change in the nature of man: that he become indifferent to the survival of his own ethnic group.</p>
<p>The braves had a clearer insight into the nature of man, groups, and land. Borders between ethnic groups, enforced by military strength, determine access to the land. Tribes that successfully defend their borders survive into the future. Nations that practice the Pocahontas policy give their land over to aliens at the expense of their own families. They may experience an exhilarating rush of selfless moral superiority before they are displaced or absorbed.</p>
<p>One can imagine Pocahontas &mdash; if she had had our trendy vocabulary &mdash; calling the Braves &#8220;xenophobes,&#8221; &#8220;bigots,&#8221; and &#8220;racists.&#8221; The Braves, no doubt, would have called themselves &#8220;patriots.&#8221;</p>
<p>In this case the Pocahontas policy prevailed. It was followed by three centuries of ethnic violence. The violence finally ended, not because human nature changed, but because the few remaining Indians were pushed into remote regions and were effectively out of contact with the new occupying nation. To their credit, the Braves fought valiantly, but only after allowing the immigrants to get a foothold. By then it was too late.</p>
<p>For the Indians, the next three centuries do not look promising. Indians number only two million out of a population of 260 million and they will probably be absorbed. If so, their language, their culture and their race will become extinct. Perhaps a few of them draw satisfaction from the current wave of immigration that is threatening their old nemesis &mdash; the pale face.</p>
<p>The Pocahontas policy buys time for the new immigrants to build their population before challenging the dominant nation. The nature of man and the competition for land ensure that there will be ethnic competition &mdash; if not violent, then political, economic, or demographic.</p>
<p>The best chance for ethnic peace is secure borders and self government for every ethnic group or nation. The spirit of Pocahontas &mdash; kind heart and liberal pluralism &mdash; continues to destroy nations.  <br>

			<p>Was Pocahontas really that sweet?  I doubt it.  Maybe she saw what was in it for her.  She died in England while it was a relatively prosperous country so immigration worked out fine for her.  Maybe she thought she&rsquo;d forget everybody else, eh?</p>
<p>My grandparents were diplomats.  I love my grandparents.  I had a very good relationship with them while growing up.  I saw what was going on during diplomatic relations though.  Everybody smiled at their nation&rsquo;s enemies the whole time while each tried to get his or her own way.      </p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s funny how the same people who must constantly remind us of the terrible evil historical sins of the past, are the same ones encouraging racial displacement in the here and now, and who remain silent when whites are ethnically cleansed from some cities in America. Well, not completely silent on the matter&hellip; By &#8216;the same people&rsquo; I suppose I mean everyone who isn&rsquo;t AmRen. </p>

			<p>Wow, who would&rsquo;ve thought Amren would publish a screed about  evil whites inflicting &#8220;three centuries of ethnic violence&#8221; on those poor, innocent Native American pacifists? </p>
<p>Of course I get the author&rsquo;s point about the foolishness of open borders. However, when I hear people whine about how much Indians have suffered since Columbus arrived I remind them that Indians living under white rule have 3 times the life expectancy and 10 times as much freedom and wealth. </p>

			<p>Just some facts about the European migration to North America: (BTW I&rsquo;m part Chickasaw myself.)<br>
There were less than two million Indians in what is today the US and Canada when the first Europeans arrived. (Where today 340 million live!) And most Indians who died from the arrival of Europeans died from disease. It was inevitable that one day those diseases would arrive to the Americas with devastating consequences. No one even understood the nature of the spread of epidemics and disease at that time. To blame epidemics on a RACE is the height of racism. The thing about small pox being spread among Indians with contaminated blankets turns out to be a COMPLETE FABRICATION. (One of the reasons phony &#8220;Indian&#8221; Ward Churchill at the University of Colorado was fired was because he was spreading these historical lies based on fraudulent &#8220;scholarship&#8221;. See www.discoverthenet.org for more information on this. Also linked through www.frontpagemag.com.) There is a long history of Jews being blamed when epidemics spread. (Later, European scientists would be the first to discover the nature of epidemics and develop vaccines and treatments, including curing small pox, that have SAVED HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE OF ALL RACES.) Far more Indians died at the hands of other Indians in incessant warfare than at the hands of Europeans. The most vicious conquering empires were none other than such as the Aztecs and Incas. And all of these Indians &#8220;seized the land&#8221; of other groups. This has been going on from the dawn of time among ALL races. (Indeed the first inhabitants of the Americas weren&rsquo;t even the present day Mongol-origin Indians, but rather a Caucasian people related to the present day Ainus, the indigenous Caucasian inhabitants of much of Siberia and Japan. e.g. Kennewick Man. They were wiped out and their lands seized by the ancestors of the present day Indians.) Look at how the black African Bantus spread out from a small area of west Africa, slaughtering the Bushmen and Pygmies (the original inhabitants of 95% of sub-Sahara Africa) and seizing their lands. Even Europe itself was subject to the colonizing conquering armies of other races: Both the Mongols and North Africans. <br>
As far as &#8220;wars of expansion&#8221; what the hell were the Islamic armies doing expanding in all directions from Arabia, putting other peoples to the sword, including Europeans? What did the Mongol armies do? The Aztecs? The Incas? The Bantu&rsquo;s expanding through the Bushman&rsquo;s and the Pygmies&rsquo; lands.</p>
<p>Actually, as the US was settled, European settlers typically PURCHASED land from the Indians (even though they had the power to just take it if they wanted, but the Europeans, unlike other cultures, had nominal rules of civilized behavior). In most other cases, Europeans settled on open un-used land, where nomadic Indian tribes would only occasionally pass through.</p>
<p>The number of Indians killed in armed conflict with whites was miniscule. Some Indians choose to stay on reservations, but MOST ended up integrating and intermarrying with white society. A large proportion of us whites have Indian blood. (Two of my great-great grandmothers were Chickasaw.)</p>
<p>But if you think the land you&rsquo;re on was stolen, then by staying here, enjoying stolen goods, YOU ARE AS GUILTY AS THOSE WHO SUPPOSEDLY &#8220;STOLE&#8221; IT IN THE FIRST PLACE. YOU&rsquo;RE JUST LETTING SOMEONE ELSE TO HAVE DONE YOUR DIRTY WORK FOR YOU. So if you believe it is stolen goods, then you should leave. You should tear up the title to your property and LEAVE!</p>
<p>Just for the record, the often repeated line about &#8220;genocide against the Inidians&#8221; is a COMPLETE MYTH: There was NO &#8220;genocide&#8221; against Indians in this country. The number of Indians who were killed by whites in armed conflicts was on par with the number of whites killed by Indians. Far more Indians were killed by other Indians, both before and after the arrival of white migrants. There was NO policy of &#8220;genocide&#8221; by anyone. Many Indians died from disease, but this was NO ONE&rsquo;S fault. No one understood the nature of disease at that time. Europe&rsquo;s own population had been decimated by such plagues throughout its history.</p>

			<p>Sorry, but the analogy of modern American patriots to the Indians doesn&rsquo;t work.  The Indians were numerically and technologically inferior to the whites and were bound to be defeated sooner or later.  The best they could have hoped for was Latin American style &#8220;mestizaje&#8221; with the whites, which would have lead to a mestizo North America which would probably be like Mexico with snow.  Pocahontas favored this; the braves favored hopeless resistance which lead to near-extinction.  </p>
<p>Of course, we are not facing that situation today, because we could easily keep foreigners out if we cared to.</p>

			<p>Are white liberals really as stupid as Pocahontas was? I&rsquo;m not so sure. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rather striking to see someone like Bill Clinton aka &#8220;The First Black President&#8221; being accused of racism when just 9 or 10 years ago he was spending much of his time salivating over the thought that white people would &#8220;eventually&#8221; be a small and unimportant minority in America.</p>
<p>And of course we can add to this the recent remarks made by top Democratic Squa Geraldine A. Ferrara. </p>
<p>What these two little &#8220;race rows&#8221; tell me is that our so-called modern day Pocahontases aren&rsquo;t quite as ready to pass around the racial peace pipe as was once thought.</p>

<p>  Not a chance of any language or culture becoming extinct just as long as White people are in charge. It is the European&rsquo;s desire for knowledge and understanding of the human condition that drives him to preserve ancient languages and cultures. Who recognised the importance of and spent twenty years transcribing the Rosetta Stone? Who builds Museums? Hoxie&rsquo;s &#8216;Encylopedia of North American Indians&rsquo; and other sources show a dramatic increase in the number of North American Indians of pure blood since the 1900&rsquo;s. Metis(mixed race)are not included. In 100 years they have increased from around 400,000 to 1.9 million so they have excellent prospects of resuming and exceeding their original numbers, with the additional benefits of not slaughtering each other, modern medicine and preservation of their cultural heritage thanks to the Europeans.</p>
<p> &gt;&gt;&gt;&#8221;To their credit, the Braves fought valiantly, but only after allowing the immigrants to get a foothold. By then it was too late&#8221;. 
The Indians lost their foothold because they allied themselves to the wrong side, the British who lost the war. Under International Law of the time, the vanquished become subject to the victor. Many British left and restarted their lives in England. The Native Americans lost their land to the victorious Americans and became subject to American law. <br>

			<p>&#8220;but rather a Caucasian people related to the present day Ainus, the indigenous Caucasian inhabitants of much of Siberia and Japan. e.g. Kennewick Man.&#8221;</p>
<p>A common, potentially dangerous mistake. On Ainus:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ainu_people" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ainu_people</a></p>
<p>To make a long story short:</p>
<p>&#8220;Ainu men generally have dense hair development. Many early investigators proposed a Caucasian ancestry, although recent DNA tests have found no traces of Caucasian ancestry. Genetic testing of the Ainu people has shown them to belong mainly to Y-haplogroup D.[5] The only places outside of Japan in which Y-haplogroup D is common are Tibet and the Andaman Islands in the Indian Ocean.[6] In a study by Tajima et al. (2004), two out of a sample of sixteen (or 12.5%) Ainu men were found to belong to Haplogroup C3, which is the most common Y-chromosome haplogroup among the indigenous populations of the Russian Far East and Mongolia;&#8221;</p>
<p>If the Ainu had been White they would have put up a better fight against the Japanese.  </p>

			<p>  I have no answers on the losses suffered by the Indian, I wish there had been another way but I doubt there was . There have been some excellent post here .The point made by the article is also well taken . But if you take a liberal, worldly view, which is what most Indian activist like Russell Means claim to . It would seen to me the Europeans were just another tribe, albeit a larger and more motivated one . IF a nation lapses into a static condition and their 1950s military is defeated by a nation with a 21st century military then who is at fault ? The nation with the 21st century military ? Benevolent logic maybe but it wouldn&rsquo;t get you much on the battle field or the bargaining table . Besides, we also fashioned flint points at one time and wore split rawhide,(the iceman ?)We just moved on to bigger and better things.</p>

			<p>Pochahontas died at the age of 22 in London from Scarlet Fever. </p>
<p>It did not work out too well for her either. </p>
<p>Perry Lorenz (the author of this article) expresses very well how I have always felt about the story of Pochahontas. If you dissect it carefully, the Indian braves were right and Pochahontas was foolishly misguided   &mdash;   a naive 15 year old girl who let her attraction to John Smith (she ended up married to someone else who took her to London) guide her instead of the reality of human nature.</p>

			<p>The Indians were a stone-age people with stone-age habits, such as torturing captives to death by the most gruesome means imaginable. While it is true that some Europeans burned people at the stake, it was over relatively quickly, while still being gruesome, excruciating and deplorable. The Indians burned captives as a matter of ritual and had found a way to make it last as long as possible, some times up to three days. They even tortured children. There was no pretense of unemotional justice  &mdash;  there was unashamed delight. </p>
<p>Could it be that Pocohontas was intrigued by a group of light-skinned powerful invaders who did not delight in demonic torture, and who had not made it into tribal ritual? And, who, by the way, treated women with relative respect?</p>
<p>Even the mighty Tecumseh told his fellows that only cowards indulged in the torture of others, and it was no wonder that the Whites hated Indians, because they engaged in such devilish devices and enjoyed it so much.</p>
<p>But still &hellip; they continued. It made them feel powerful.</p>

<p>I usually don&rsquo;t agree w/the neocon Michael Medved, but he wrote an excellent column last September debunking the popular lie that Indians were victims of planned genocide.</p>
<p>Fact is that 90% of the Indians died from diseases like smallpox that their weak immune systems could not protect them from. Eventually someone was come to the Americas and infect them, if not from Europe then another continent.</p>

			<p>Our numbers have dropped, it&rsquo;s true, and for the two reasons we all know. 1- Reproduction, 2- Immigration.</p>
<p>But hell, we&rsquo;re STILL almost 70% of the country.</p>
<p>Can you imagine being 70% of the country and whining about being taken over?</p>
<p>Well, you could if you took into account how many of that 70% just don&rsquo;t care anymore, about anything, let alone defending its Country and Race.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Left is like Franz Liebkind, the crazy German in the movie &#8220;The Producers&#8221; in the scene in the end when he goes nuts and tries to shoot Max and Leo; &#8220;This is not working, I am not killing you.&#8221; </p>
<p>They are so upset that we are not all gleefully cooperating in our own demise.  But a lot are (apparently this isn&rsquo;t good enough for the Left, who apparently will continue this kind of behavior until they realize, by their own beliefs, it&rsquo;s THEIR turn to die).</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s clear to most people, and if not, will be by the end of this year, that the USA as we knew it, for those of us born between 1946 and 1970, is over.  Gone.  There is no getting it back, and any attempt to do so is a waste of time.</p>
<p>I am aware that some here might quarrel with that point, and I respect that, but I&rsquo;m going to stand by it none the less.</p>
<p>Personally, I don&rsquo;t think one more second should be wasted beginning to seek alternatives and/or die trying.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br>
Not meaning in any way to condone the Roman  practice of crucifixion (done only for the worst of criminals), it must be pointed out that the Romans came two millennia earlier and from a bygone  and more or less extinct culture.  They were not modern (or early-modern) Englishmen.   Also, as the other poster pointed out (for what it&rsquo;s worth),  such gruesome &#8220;punishments&#8221; as burning, etc., were all conceived of as  <b>punishment </b>- - not as torture done for its own  sake,  for the delight and amusement of the onlookers  (though it did serve as a warning to the mob).   </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll grant that&rsquo;s not much better, but it&rsquo;s something.  Europeans were well on their way towards the concept of formal justice and rule by law.   Those awful punishments they had, deplorable as they were  (but not exceptional by the world&rsquo;s standards of the time),  still embodied the concept of JUSTICE  carried out for a valid reason, not just fun for the victors&rsquo; enjoyment.</p>

			<p>Tecumseh got what he deserved at the Battle of Tippiecanoe in 1811. He allied himself and his people with the enemy British forces against the United States. The real hero of the Battle of Tippiecanoe,, in my opinion, is Col. Richard M. Johnon. He launched the small metallic missile from a hand-held firearm that penetrated Tecumseh&rsquo;s body and caused a cessation of the North American aborigine&rsquo;s life functions.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s THAT for political correctness, fellow Amrenners? </p>

			<p>There are intriguing parallels of Pocahontas with Sacagewea, who led Lewis and cLark across the West to the Pacific.   </p>
<p>And with La Malinche, the Indian woman who became Cortez&rsquo; devoted lover, mistress, guide and translator.   Her memory is hated in Mexico to this day, and to Mexicans her name is synonymous with traitor.   </p>
<p>A remarkable similarity between them and Pocahontas!   Whether in Virginia, or Idaho, or Mexico, all opened up the way for the white man&rsquo;s conquest    &mdash;   heroines to us perhaps, but seen now as traitors to their own.</p>
<p>There seemed to be something irrestible about those sturdy, fearless white men back in those days!  What was it? What have we lost?</p>

			<p>&hellip;.&#8221;Fact is that 90% of the Indians died from diseases like smallpox that their weak immune systems could not protect them from. Eventually someone was come to the Americas and infect them, if not from Europe then another continent.&#8221;</p>

&gt; The fact actually is that the Indians did not have &#8220;weak&#8221; immune systems and even though some will think this simply semantics it is an important distinction.  They had unexposed immune systems, that is how the immune system works.  When these diseases arrived in Europe (from Asia) the Europeans died in droves too.  The ones that survived had been selected naturally and have from then on had a resistance - an enhanced ability for their immune systems to respond.  </p>
<p>But the remainder of this statement is true; exposure had to come sometime.  In fact, since the Amerinds really originated in Asia and nearly all infectous viruses seem to originate from Asia, one could say that it came full circle when it caught up to them.</p>
<p>And remember, they gave the white man gonorhea and Syphillus which killed many in Europe.<br>

			<p>.&#8221;If you&rsquo;re a skinny white guy who doesn&rsquo;t go to the gym, who&rsquo;s fault is it, your&rsquo;s or the 270lb. black guy who plays four hours of basketball everyday and hits you in the mouth?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Scott Landers: Personally, I don&rsquo;t think one more second should be wasted beginning to seek alternatives and/or die trying.</p>
<p>Well, Scott, don&rsquo;t you think digging your own grave is a little bit pathetic?  Yes, most of us would agree by now that the &#8220;United&#8221; States is most likely finished, but why not invest our efforts in seizing a reasonable portion of the North American continent as our own ethnic territory?</p>
<p>Look, we all know that a balkanization will inevitably take place with the drastic demographic trends we are facing.  Anyone who attempts to deny that fact is a flaming moron stuck in a SERIOUS state of denial.  If there were to be some way that White/Caucasians in North America could petition or lobby for an ethnic enclave on this continent for our existance in the future, then that is the approach we MUST eventually take when La Raza and the NAACP gain every demand they desire.</p>
<p>The border of the USA is much too large to control, so we will eventually have to create a more reasonable border on this continent in a region that is already majority white.  This may seem completely far-fetched to many of you right now, but I would love to hear any other reasonable solutions out there that any of you think are more realistic.  Personally, I see no other solution other than creating an all-White homeland in the Pacific Northwest.</p>

<p>There seemed to be something irrestible about those sturdy, fearless white men back in those days! What was it? What have we lost?  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;   We have lost something, I had a book on WW2 had a lot of photos of the Army and Marine troops who invaded the islands in the Pacific . They had a look in their eyes like steel .It was the first thing you would notice observing the picture. I would hate to know they were coming after me . A few years later Natl. Geo. magazine did an issue on the movement west, a lot of photos . Lo and behold, those settler women sitting on their Conestoga wagons and in their calico dresses had the exact same look of steel in their eyes as those Marines . It was unmistakable . </p>

			<p>The sad part to note is that Pocahontas &#8216;converted&rsquo; to Christianity, and assumed European dress (Imagine Cher in an Elizabethan gown of the era), before leaving for England, where she died.</p>
<p>Her descendants are proud to note this racial lineage, (which is one thing) but Evangelical Christians, in their unitarian confusion of communist thought with racial egalitarianism and Christianity) http://spiritwaterblood.com/index.php/comments/135/</p>
<p>have used this as a &#8216;model for future behavior&rsquo; even in the homeschool community, of &#8216;Christ-like&rsquo; behavior. This is all the more bizarre, when one reads that Christ NEVER repudiated the &#8216;anti-miscegenation&rsquo; clauses of the Pentateuch. Shouldn&rsquo;t his &#8216;followers&rsquo; do the same, instead of holding up Pocahontas as the model for Christian missions in America?</p>

<p>No one&rsquo;s, because hey, either we&rsquo;re all subject to the law of survival of the fittest, (nations, races and individuals alike) or no one is.</p>

			<p>The border of the USA is much too large to control?</p>
<p>Oh, is it?  Then how did we manage to do it for two centuries, and very effectively, with a mere faction of our present population?</p>

			<p>We didn&rsquo;t manage to ever patrol it since this nation began.  The border states(territories) were always Spanish influenced and never held any allegiances to the Anglo-Sphere. Massive waves of mezo-Americans is nothing new, it&rsquo;s just that now we are seeing the effects of many decades starting to come to a head in other regions of this continent.</p>
<p>Tell me when the USA has ever &#8220;managed&#8221; our border?</p>
