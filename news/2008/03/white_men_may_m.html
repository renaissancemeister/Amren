						<p>White men could be stopped from getting jobs under controversial government plans to allow employers to hire ethnic minority and female candidates ahead of them.</p>
<p>Harriet Harman, the Minister for Women, has launched a consultation into proposals to scrap current laws that ban employers from taking race or sex into consideration when interviewing job candidates.</p>
<p>The plan is described as &#8220;positive action&#8221; rather than &#8220;positive discrimination&#8221; because it would not allow a candidate with worse job credentials to be given preferential treatment.</p>
<p>Instead, the measure involves giving employers the right to take race or sex into consideration when choosing between candidates with exactly the same qualifications.</p>
<p>The proposed change in the law could also affect universities, allowing them to select more female students in subjects areas such as the sciences where men have traditionally dominated.</p>
<p>Critics insisted these decisions were already being taken by employers and recruitment officers keen to boost numbers of women and ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>However, Miss Harman is said to believe radical action is needed to help all disadvantaged members of the community gain their full potential.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Federation of Small Business said: &#8220;We would urge caution over the prospect of more Government regulation, which always causes problems for small businesses, which do not have human resources departments to steer them through the legal minefields.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ann Widdecombe, the Conservative MP and leading campaigner against all-women shortlists in Parliament, said: &#8220;In addition to being superfluous, this law would be detrimental because it suggests that women and members of ethnic minorities need special treatment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have always said that every women MP should be able to look every male MP all the way up to the Prime Minister in the eye and know that she did not get there as a result of special treatment. Women at all levels of business need to be able to say the same thing in the boardroom.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Katherine Rake, of the Fawcett Society, which campaigns for equal pay, said it was unclear how Miss Harman&rsquo;s proposals would stand up in court.</p>
<p>Theresa May, the shadow women&rsquo;s minister, said Miss Harman ought to be concentrating on the real problems facing women in work, such as the gender pay gap.<br>

<p>Remember Cronulla, remember what happened in Denmark after a Muslim Woman cop killed a White man who was protecting a pregnant White woman&hellip;Oh yeah, a riot. To me this is grounds for such behavior due to such a discriminatory law.</p>

<p>&gt; Well here is a woman trying to be honest.  But I am sure sex preferrence played a big part in her attaining her present position.  This is because much of what women have acheived during the past 40 years has been due to loud complaining, lawsuits, and other types of harassments.  Once in, they stack the roles in a way that would embarass the most chauvanistic of males.  It can be seen everywhere.  If it isn&rsquo;t a woman using her sexual allure for an advantage, she is complaining and even bullying until she gets her way.  And then, she brings along all her friends.</p>
<p>The men sit at home in their apartments and try to figure out if they have enough money to pay child support and take their kids anywhere when they get to see them.</p>

			<p>After generations of working class families being held down under the British class system my parents, having fought in WWII, saw a Britain in the 50&rsquo; and 60&rsquo;s which, after centuiries, allowed working people to rise above their &#8220;station&#8221;.</p>
<p>I attended a Catholic Grammar school and went on to qualify as an accountant. Early in my career (the 70&rsquo;s and 80&rsquo;s) I experienced being rejected for jobs because I had a working class accent and background. </p>
<p>Now I will be rejected because I am white and male.</p>
<p>It seems that whichever way we turn we are discriminated against in some way. Being English is to be treated worse than Nazis.</p>
<p>We need a true revolution to return our land to the English people and rid ourselves of this disease of multiculturalism..</p>

			<p>This is another nail in the coffin of the disastrous Labour party government.  Roll on the next general election.  Britain has the anomoly of being allowed to have, for example a Black lawyer&rsquo;s Association, but not a White Lawyer&rsquo;s Association, or a Black policeman&rsquo;s Association, etc.  Having a white one is seen as being racist by many idiots.</p>
<p>The world is crazy, well Britain for a start.</p>

			<p>Harriet Harman&rsquo;s chief claim to fame is severly embarrassing the British Labour Party by insisting that her precious son (Wouldn&rsquo;t she fight like a tiger for *his* rights?)attended a selective intake grammer school, which is in direct contravention of Labour Paty policy that insists on egalitarian comprehensive schools for those without Ms Harman&rsquo;s financial clout.</p>

<p>They already have&hellip; In todays world &#8220;Victims&#8221; are above morality. In fact, they define it. That&rsquo;s why we must be constantly told the practicioners of racism and exclusion, on a global scale, in each and every case, are really &#8220;victims&#8221;.<br>

			<p>An Englishman in England being discriminated against!<br>
It is bad in enough if it occurs in the New World, but to lose one&rsquo;s rights in a place like England and being of true English decent, it is the stuff of nightmare and lunacy!<br>
To lose a birthright that has been earned through centuries, possibly millenia, of work and sacrifices by one&rsquo;s ancestors who strove to create a place where their people and descents can feel secure and proud is mindboggling. <br>
The fact that something like this can even be suggested in what is suppose to be a homogenous society proves that white&rsquo;s have become a subject people. <br>
What&rsquo;s next, &#8216;first knight&rsquo; privilege for all non-whites/minorities? </p>

			<p>Nothing surprises me where Britain goes anymore! It&rsquo;s leftist leaders seem intent on destroying the nation, and wiping out all meaning and memory of what it used to be to be British. It&rsquo;s no wonder that indigenous Brits are fleeing the country in vast numbers. The UK is a tiny island, and it is sinking under the weight of it&rsquo;s loony liberal policies, and the rising tide of non-white immigrants who arrive there on a daily basis. A good deal of them have criminal records, while other still are openly hostile to Westerners, and express it openly in public. They are daring and bold, because they know they can get away with it. Meantime, White Brits who say anything back to them can be arrested for racial abuse. It&rsquo;s sad to see a once great nation commit suicide.</p>
