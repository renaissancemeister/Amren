<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>It would be tempting to think that science writing, with its emphasis on data and reproducible results, is relatively free from the woolly thinking about race so common elsewhere. It is true that there are still a few objective publications that accept papers from people like Philippe Rushton and Arthur Jensen, whose findings do not conform to racial orthodoxy. They are exceptions. The most influential science publications, such as <cite>Science</cite> and <cite>Nature</cite> are extremely cautious about violating current intellectual fashion, and &#8220;popular&#8221; publications like <cite>Natural History</cite> and <cite>Scientific American</cite> are firmly in the hands of dogmatic egalitarians (see article, <a href="/ar/1997/06/index.html#article3" target="data" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none">All the Data Fit to Print</a> [reprinted below] ).</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the mid-level trade journals read by science workers follow the fashion. <cite>The Scientist, </cite> for example, is a well-regarded trade publication that bills itself as &#8220;the newspaper for the life sciences professional.&#8221; It appears twice a month, and runs announcements of research and teaching positions as well as ads for &#8220;pre-owned lab equipment,&#8221; &#8220;high quality antibodies and proteins,&#8221; &#8220;hazardous gas detection instruments,&#8221; and other specialist gear.</p>
<p>One of its issues for Black History Month (formerly known as February) was devoted almost entirely to non-whites, with the four front-page articles covering the following subjects: why blacks are unwilling to serve as research subjects, how black churches can help recruit black research subjects, the dearth of non-whites in the biotech industry, and the means by which non-whites &#8220;demonstrate that success in science can come despite barriers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first two of these articles deal with a real problem. In response to widespread claims that science &#8220;ignores&#8221; minorities, the National Institutes of Health and other major grant-making bodies now require that biological research include large numbers of non-white subjects. This is not easy, because so many blacks refuse to take part.</p>
<p>As the first article points out, anyone who tries to recruit black subjects runs into a wall of suspicion, and nearly everyone <cite>The Scientist</cite> interviewed seems to think this is because science is so &#8220;white.&#8221; America needs more non-white scientists, if only to encourage blacks to act as research subjects.</p>
<p>However, the most frequently offered explanation for black mistrust is the Tuskegee syphilis experiment. This was a nearly 40-year study, stopped only in 1972, in which U.S. government scientists charted the progress of syphilis in 400 Alabama black men. The men were deliberately left untreated so doctors could study the full course of the disease.</p>
<p>Although this is the only recorded instance of this kind of government malfeasance, it stands as the definitive symbol of white medical research for many blacks and even a few whites. As Arthur Caplan, the director of the University of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Center for Bioethics explains &mdash; without elaboration &mdash; &#8221;there&rsquo;s certainly been many, many areas where minorities have been exploited, mistreated, abused, and used by the research community.&#8221;</p>
<p>As <cite>The Scientist</cite> reports, the other thing blacks frequently say is that since AIDS was probably invented by the U.S. government to exterminate them, medical research cannot be trusted. Various people interviewed in the article have a breezy, ready-made explanation for this mortifyingly implausible point of view: Blacks do not have &#8220;equal access&#8221; to medicine. As James Bowman, a black professor of medicine at the University of Chicago explains, &#8220;As long as we have an inequitable health care system, minorities must be suspicious.&#8221; &#8220;If they&rsquo;re not, they&rsquo;re foolish,&#8221; he adds sympathetically.</p>
<p>Kathleen Boozang, a Seton Hall University professor of unspecified race, draws slightly different conclusions from &#8220;unequal access&#8221;: &#8220;If you&rsquo;re asked to be a subject of research, but then aren&rsquo;t going to reap the benefits, why should you participate? It ultimately goes back to the structure of the health care system and the lack of access to it.&#8221; Thus we arrive at the doubtful but reportedly widely-held view that non-whites don&rsquo;t like to be research subjects because there is not enough free medicine for poor people. If they thought there was something in it for them they might take part.</p>
<p>The pages of virtually any black newspaper are filled with advertisements for psychics, faith healers, and good luck charms.</p>
<p>According to one black woman who is a genetics counselor, blacks are afraid of science in general because of books like <cite>The Bell Curve.</cite> &#8220;[It says] we&rsquo;re inferior. You have scientists or even educators saying this,&#8221; thus tainting the entire scientific enterprise.</p>
<p>Some of these explanations for low black participation may have a grain of truth, but the main reason &mdash; never touched on by <cite>The Scientist</cite> &mdash; is probably the nature of blacks themselves. Whites do not ordinarily agree to be part of a medical study only because they think the research will benefit them or their families. They care about the public good and take a long-term view of how to contribute to it.</p>
<p>These are not traits particularly characteristic of blacks. High crime rates are the classic sign of a short-term view and contempt for society at large. But even among non-criminal populations, when people are matched by income blacks give much less to charity than whites do. Likewise, black neighborhoods are notorious for ignoring municipal recycling plans, and only with the greatest difficulty can blacks be made to participate in blood drives.</p>
<p>Blacks are much less likely to make their organs available for transplant, despite government campaigns to explain to them that blacks often can accept organs only from other blacks. At the same time, one of the most consistent racial differences in polling data is the extent to which blacks believe that government can solve all problems (a view that coexists with the fear that AIDS is an extermination tool). Society is there to help them and not the other way around. This is not the view of people who volunteer their time in the name of medical progress.</p>
<p>Finally, anti-scientific superstitions are likely to be more common among blacks than whites. The pages of virtually any black newspaper are filled with advertisements for psychics, faith healers, numerology books, good-luck charms and other such mumbo jumbo. People who patronize faith healers may not have much interest in medical research.</p>
<p>The plan to increase the number of non-white in the sciences is getting a big push from the government. In President Clinton&rsquo;s proposed FY 1998 budget for the National Institutes of Health, the second largest expense item is minority programs. Out of a total of $13.1 billion, $1.38 billion or more than ten percent will be spent on the quixotic quest of turning blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians into scientists. One typical NIH program offers five-year grants to universities in the range of $500,000 to $3 million. They are to &#8220;support minority scientists&#8221; by paying for salaries, lab space, technical support, and travel.</p>
<p>What is the only NIH budget item larger than &#8220;minority programs&#8221;? AIDS research, which gets $1.5 billion. Breast cancer research, for example, is well behind at $396 million. AR</p>
<p>But given that &mdash; for whatever reason &mdash; blacks are such reluctant research subjects, scientists are looking for them everywhere. The latest hope seems to be to persuade black churches to help find subjects, but <cite>The Scientist</cite> reports that this is by no means the happy ending. To the chagrin of some scientists, many black preachers expect to be paid if they are to round up subjects. One puts it somewhat delicately but unmistakably: &#8220;If you want to change a church&rsquo;s agenda to fit something on your own agenda, you need to invest in the infrastructure of the church.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even if the research is on diseases like prostate cancer or hypertension, to which blacks are particularly prone, churchgoers are no more willing than anyone else to play the white man&rsquo;s game. As one black breast cancer activist explains, &#8220;[the research institutions] usually send a very well-meaning white woman or white man into the community to pitch the idea. The congregation is very polite, but the people have no intention of complying.&#8221; If whites do not have the sense to send black recruiters they are advised, at the very least, to spend a lot of time attending church services and community events so as to &#8220;build a comfort level.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Overcoming Barriers</b></p>
<p>The article about how non-whites manage to overcome &#8220;barriers&#8221; and become successes in science rather realistically points out that the biggest barrier is usually poor schooling rather than outright &#8220;racism.&#8221; A different but telling complaint comes from Kenneth Olden, the first black to run one of the National Institutes of Health. He says blacks in general show little interest in science or scientists, and &#8220;the community&#8221; seems not to care about his glowing record at Harvard and the National Cancer Institute. &#8220;Does it bother me?&#8221; he asks. &#8220;It does a lot.&#8221; Indifference began at home; Dr. Olden&rsquo;s father could never understand why he wanted to spend so much time studying science.</p>
<p>The successful non-whites interviewed for this article do not appear to dwell on &#8220;racism&#8221; but <cite>The Scientist</cite> warns that &#8220;even in the academic world prejudice sneaks out.&#8221; One black academic complained that when he was hired for his first job, the chairman of the department actually told him it was because they needed a minority. Also, a Choctow Indian woman who says her &#8220;native background&#8221; is &#8220;a profound influence on my holistic approach to cancer patients&#8221; is nevertheless insulted that people have asked her why she doesn&rsquo;t wear moccasins or braids.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s success stories complain about how hard it was not have role models but also complain about how much work it is for them to be role models. &#8220;Fighting stereotypes,&#8221; is also said to be exhausting business.</p>
<p>The article about the dearth of blacks in the biotech business extols the efforts of companies that are trying to change things. Amgen Inc., for example, has given $1.5 million to Spellman, the black women&rsquo;s college, to set up a center for molecular biology. It grants scholarships to Spellman students and offers summer internships. <cite>The Scientist</cite> is silent about how many black lady researchers Amgen has managed to nurture.</p>
<p>David Jensen, who is a recruiter for the biotech industry, is perplexed to note that employers who already have minorities don&rsquo;t want to give them up: &#8220;I think there are more minorities in academia. I don&rsquo;t know why, but when academia lands some sharp students of minority descent they glom onto them and really foster their interest in the academic research area .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</p>
<p><cite>The Scientist</cite> managed to find some small companies that admit they make no special effort to hire non-whites. &#8220;We&rsquo;re looking for the very best scientists for the job without regard to their ethnic status,&#8221; says a CEO who manages 24 employees. However, the director of a scientific head-hunting firm says that affirmative action inevitably comes with size: &#8220;They&rsquo;ll have developed to 80 employees and they&rsquo;ll realize &#8220;Hey, we don&rsquo;t have a very diverse work force here,&rsquo; and they&rsquo;ll go out and try to correct that.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the big stories in the issue is about &#8220;diversity training,&#8221; which is pitched for two main reasons, one moral the other economic. Bernard Scales, the black man in charge of &#8220;diversity&#8221; for Dupont, says &#8220;it&rsquo;s the right thing to do, in terms of addressing equity, fairness .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and equal opportunity for all of our employees. And right behind that is that it&rsquo;s critical to our business success.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maurizio Velasquez, founder of Diversity Training Group, agrees: &#8220;The more diverse a company is, the more competitive it will be in a diverse society.&#8221;</p>
<p>Robert Hayles, a black man who runs his own diversity consulting business, says the same thing: &#8220;[W]hen there is diversity of style, of function, of age, of race, of language or of culture in a group contrasted to a group that is more homogeneous &mdash; given equal management and goals in both groups &mdash; the diverse groups quantitatively and qualitatively outperform the homogeneous groups.&#8221; <cite>The Scientist</cite> did not seem to think it necessary to cite Mr. Hayles sources.</p>
<p>The biotech company Genentech has been pushing diversity with great enthusiasm. For example, it has an association of black employees who put on programs to edify non-blacks. It has a Hispanic association and a Filipino association. The co-chairman of the company&rsquo;s homosexual association says that such groups are &#8220;mushrooming&#8221; because of Genentech&rsquo;s promotion of diversity. This is supposed to be great for business.</p>
<p>The same issue of <cite>The Scientist</cite> has two long editorials about racial matters. One is a rambling, largely incoherent piece by a black cancer specialist at the University of Texas. Two of its less opaque sentences are: &#8220;When the staff of a hospital deals with the health problems of minority patients without the training, insight, or sensitivity needed to approach these individuals, efforts are doomed to failure. You might not see this as racism but I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>In another editorial, Jordan Cohen makes two points: &#8220;Finding solutions to the most recalcitrant health problems, even being able to conceptualize what the problems are, will require a research work force that is much more diverse racially, ethnically, and by gender than we now have.&#8221;</p>
<p>How to get that precious diversity? &#8220;[T]here is simply no way admissions committees for M.D. and Ph.D. programs can select an adequately diverse class of students today without taking race and ethnicity &mdash; explicitly or implicitly &mdash; into account.&#8221; In other words, to get the &#8220;diversity&#8221; the country needs, standards for doctors and scientists must be selectively lowered, and better- qualified whites kept out. Ominously, Mr. Cohen is president of the Association of American Medical Colleges.</p>
<p>The last article in this special issue is a somewhat sheepish account of the &#8220;science&#8221; going on in black universities. After a bit of hemming and hawing, the article concedes that &#8220;research output is less important than is research for its educational value.&#8221; It goes on to conclude that black colleges &#8220;could fill an important niche in translational research &mdash; that is, research that bridges discoveries from the laboratory to the community.&#8221;</p>
<p>This special issue is probably typical of the kind of thing scientists read and think they have to believe. Even in the laboratory and operating room, there are strong pressures to have the right line up of non-whites rather than the most capable people. <cite>The Scientist</cite>&lsquo;s cheerful acceptance of this view is almost amusing in light of a claim the paper makes in the masthead of every issue:</p>
<blockquote><cite>The Scientist</cite> serves its readership in many ways, but one of its most valued aspects is its commitment to open discussion of controversial topics. While readers praise us for this commitment, they should also recognize that all articles .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. reflect the views of their authors and not the official views of the publication.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</blockquote>
<p>Now, perhaps, we understand. The editors actually know all about race and IQ, but promote affirmative action only to be &#8220;controversial.&#8221;<br>

						<p>The scientific world divides publications into two groups: journals and magazines. Journals publish hard research data and aim to expand the frontiers of knowledge. Anything else is a mere magazine.</p>
<p>Probably the most prestigious and influential journals published in English are <cite>Science</cite>, <cite>Nature</cite>, and <cite>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</cite> They do not claim that race does not exist or that intelligence is unaffected by genes, but they are extremely cautious about accepting articles that violate current intellectual fashion.</p>
<p><cite>Science</cite> is mainly devoted to "big" science &mdash; astronomy, nuclear physics and, increasingly, human genetics. In fact, advances in molecular genetics published in <cite>Science</cite> were a strong impetus for launching the Human Genome Project (see <a href="/ar/1997/03/index.html" target="marchAR" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none">AR, March 1997</a>). <cite>Science</cite> now covers the project regularly and devotes a yearly special issue to it.</p>
<p>The American Association for the Advancement of Science, which publishes the journal is strongly committed to affirmative action, and Science has a clear distaste for racial differences. Nevertheless, it deplores zealotry. Even before the term PC was invented, its long-term editor, Daniel Koshland, was publishing editorials denouncing political persecution and self-censorship. More recently, it ran not-entirely-hostile comments on the wrath visited upon Christopher Brand and Glayde Whitney for having suggested that race may have something to do with intelligence and crime rates. It has published letters to the editor from Philippe Rushton and even one from your servant, the editor of AR. It is not inconceivable that it will some day accept a feature article by Arthur Jensen, Philippe Rushton, or Richard Lynn, but that would be a major event.</p>
<p><cite>Proceedings of the National Academy of Science</cite> (PNAS) is another extremely influential journal. The National Academy of Science (NAS) itself is a government-sponsored body, established in 1863, whose members are elected by the existing members. It glistens with prestige and is supposed to make recommendations to government, perform good works, etc.</p>
<p>Since at least 1934, <cite>Science</cite> had been publishing abstracts of all papers presented at NAS meetings, thus giving them worldwide exposure. This practice came to a sudden end in 1968, after NAS-member and Nobel-prize-winning inventor of the transistor, William Shockley, began presenting papers on race, IQ, and eugenics. PNAS itself made a similar publishing decision. It used to accept all submissions from members, but changed its policy in 1972 so as to be able to shut out William Shockley.</p>
<p>Perhaps in repentance for this high-handedness, PNAS has since published a number of important papers on the genetic distance between races as well as DNA studies of how long ago the races diverged from each other. It occasionally publishes papers on behavioral genetics and in 1986 even accepted a report by Philippe Rushton on the heritability of altruism.</p>
<p><cite>Nature,</cite> published in England, is strongly oriented toward biology. It is of distinguished lineage and at one time regularly published Francis Galton. It has drifted so far from these fine beginnings that in 1992 its editor, John Maddox, wrote a full-page editorial explaining why he would <em>not</em> accept Prof. Rushton&rsquo;s work on race and brain size. He explained that science of this kind was so contrary to established opinion that it had to meet higher standards than other research. However, the raging letters controversy that followed this editorial was excellent publicity for Prof. Rushton&rsquo;s findings.</p>
<p><cite>Scientific American</cite> is a mere magazine about science and does not publish original research. However, it has a large circulation, is highly regarded, and is the oldest science-related magazine in America. Unfortunately, in the last 15 years or so, it has fallen into the hands of the determined opposition. Stephen Jay Gould, who carries forward the work of Franz Boas, essentially sets the tone for articles about race and human nature. <cite>Scientific American</cite>&rsquo;s current leanings were on display during a radio interview with the editor to mark the 150th anniversary of the magazine&rsquo;s beginning. He noted &mdash; with pride &mdash; that Vladimir Lenin had read and liked the magazine.</p>
<p>Another influential science magazine with an even larger circulation is <cite>Natural History,</cite> published by the American Museum of Natural History. The indefatigable Dr. Gould writes a column for every issue, and in perhaps 30 percent of them he takes off after racists, racialism, etc.</p>
<p><cite>Journal of the American Medical Association</cite> (JAMA) is in yet another category. It sometimes publishes excellent medical articles and symposia on public health issues, but is known among scientists for its biases. The most obvious is that as the union magazine for doctors it is devoted to making their profession as lucrative as possible. On social science questions it is no less trendy than the <cite>New York Times,</cite> but can be read to equally good purpose: it reports useful information that undercuts &mdash; but somehow never changes &mdash; its editorial positions.</p>
<p>Which are the science journals most open to questions of race and genetics? <cite>Personality and Individual Differences,</cite> edited in England by Hans Eysenck, and Intelligence, edited in the United States by Douglas Detterman, are clear-thinking and widely read. Their articles are often cited in other journals. <cite>The Mankind Quarterly,</cite> published by Roger Pearson (his latest book will be reviewed in the next issue) has for years been sailing courageously against the wind and has aired a large number of ideas now central to a realistic understanding of race, heredity, and social behavior.</p>
<p>Finally, Transaction Publishers &mdash; which has brought out such important books as Prof. Rushton&rsquo;s <cite>Race, Evolution, and Behavior,</cite> Michael Levin&rsquo;s <cite>Feminism and Freedom,</cite> and <cite>The IQ Controversy</cite> by Mark Synderman and Stanley Rothman &mdash; publishes a magazine called <cite>Society.</cite> Although its field is the social sciences, where the political constraints are even tighter, Transaction does seem to try to follow the data rather than the fashion of the day.</p>
<p>Although the science press is not much less unscientific about race than anyone else, it would be a mistake to blame this on a special and shadowy class of people known as editors. People in the field report that science journalism largely reflects the convictions and fears of scientists themselves. They are no different from anyone else in their preference that someone else risk his career by publishing "racist" or "sexist" findings. Science is a great ally, which continues to establish the factual basis for ancient wisdom that the current era would deny, but its direction and the uses to which it is put change only as society changes.<br>

					<p>I never worked for a diverse company that can be called a success. There is to much infighting, and friction between the<br>
races. The Mexicans do not like the filipinos, the northern Asians dislike the southern Asians. They have one thing in common, they dislike blacks. They all have the special associations that are not allowed for whites. If you try to ask why whites cannot organize, just like the nonwhites, that alone will get you terminated. Diversity, and forced integration causes to much tension, and in certain situations, can be very dangerous, if there is a downturn that causes the company to fold.</p>

					<p>&#8220;However, the most frequently offered explanation for black mistrust is the Tuskegee syphilis experiment.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;Tuskegee experiment&#8221; is deliberately misrepresented: Most media outlets (including even &#8220;US News and World Report&#8221;), have regularly falsely reported that it involved black men being <span class="caps">DELIBERATELY </span>infected with syphilis. Most blacks believe this version of the lie. John Leo wrote an excellent article on this myth: When the Tuskegee experiment began, penicillin (a <span class="caps">WHITE </span>invention) had not yet been invented. The treatments at the time were worse than the disease itself. There was a belief that just letting it run its course was preferable to the treatments being used at the time: That the body could cure itself better. So there were a number of experiments set up with volunteers, including whites, such as with a similar study in <span class="caps">NORWAY, </span>to test this hypothesis. Tuskegee, a black institution, was chosen, not because it was black, <span class="caps">BUT BECAUSE</span> IT <span class="caps">SERVED</span> A <span class="caps">COMMUNITY BEING RAVAGED</span> BY <span class="caps">SYPHILIS.</span> The black men in the Tuskegee study <span class="caps">ALREADY HAD SYPHILIS.</span> The experiment was run by <span class="caps">BENEFACTORS</span> OF <span class="caps">THE BLACK COMMUNITY </span>with the black community&rsquo;s full cooperation. The failing was that much later, when penicillin was developed by a white man, and shown to be effective, the participants in the study were not notified of white man&rsquo;s new cure for this scourge. Someone dropped the ball. But it was not the first time such a thing had happened: Almost always to <span class="caps">WHITE </span>study participants. Since then there are better guidelines and controls so that such a thing does not occur again.<br>
If you want some <span class="caps">REAL </span>examples of <span class="caps">DELIBERATE </span>experiments on human beings that were carried out in this country, look at the military&rsquo;s exposure of soldiers (all white) during the early &#8216;50&rsquo;s to radiation from atom bomb explosions in the Nevada desert, to determine the short and long term effects. My father was one of them: In a trench a few hundred yards from a detonation in Frenchman Flats. The fireball hit the ground and covered the soldiers with radioactive dust. They were brushed off with <span class="caps">BROOMS </span>before boarding the bus. Long after retirement from the army my father received yearly surveys from the military asking health questions. 40 years after exposure he developed thyroid cancer, a cancer caused <span class="caps">ONLY </span>by radiation exposure. No help from the government.</p>
<p>By the way, the <span class="caps">PRINCIPLE </span>reason blacks don&rsquo;t donate organs, per surveys, is that they don&rsquo;t want whites potentially getting their organs. Just another example of how blacks end up getting hosed by their own racism. Good thing for blacks that whites are not as racist as blacks are: Blacks need organ transplants (kidneys mostly) at a <span class="caps">FAR </span>higher rate than whites. And <span class="caps">MOST </span>kidneys black receive are from whites, since there aren&rsquo;t enough from other blacks (who would provide a better matched pool of available organs). Jared Taylor documented this also in &#8220;Paved With Good Intentions&#8221;.<br>

Interesting. Maybe a good policy for hospitals would be to inform black organ recipients if their donor was black or white. I wonder if the number of organs accepted by blacks would go down?  </p>

					<p>If blacks don&rsquo;t want whites getting their donated organs, perhaps they should consider that organ transplants do not work well across racial lines.  Blood is no problem, but organs and bone marrow requires a fairly precise match.</p>
<p>I am mainly Celtic.  My wife is entirely Japanese.  Neither of us would have a problem accepting bone marrow or transplant organs from of our respective races.  Our daughter would reject tissue from either of us.  She has my wife&rsquo;s ivory complexion and epicanthic eyefolds, with my nose and gray irises, and will probably grow up to be a strikingly beautiful woman, but the flaws inherent in the &#8220;make your own race&#8221; approach to breeding one&rsquo;s descendants are obvious.</p>
<p>As an aside, 11:18 PM is almost certainly correct in suspecting the cause of his (her?) father&rsquo;s thyroid cancer.  Radioactive iodine isotopes were the cause at odds approaching certainty.</p>

					<p>Spellman College, which is in liberal majority-black Atlanta and is all black and female, may not have produced any research scientists, but it can be proud of its &#8220;civil rights&#8221; activists. Some students from there were very vocal in their support of the Jena 6, as, of course, the latter are not hardened would-be killers but victims of a &#8220;racist&#8221; white society. The faculty and president have no problem with the outrageous attitude of these young witches. This story was printed in the liberal rag <span class="caps">THE ATLANTA JOURNAL</span>-CONSTITUTION last Oct. Can anyone imagine whites being so blatant in defending whites who had nearly killed an innocent black? I let the crybaby <span class="caps">AJC </span>know my feelings on this issue, but it&rsquo;s not likely to print such letters.</p>

<p>Not necessarily a government plot.  A side-effect of vaccines (which are produced by infecting animals with viruses) is that new viruses often develop.  The <span class="caps">AIDS </span>virus coincided with a mass vaccination programme.  The whole issue is not covered by the <span class="caps">MSM </span>in case parents are put off having their children vaccinated.  Most viruses that have appeared in recent decades are likely to be the result of vaccinations.<br>

					<p>It is really pitiful that grown people can believe in the fantasy of &#8220;diversity&#8221; to such extent and with such glowing praise.</p>
<p><br>
I propose an experiment:</p>
<p>Two groups will be formed to perform some technical task from scratch.  I will manage a group consisting of those best qualified to perform the job based on experience, qualifications, personalities, etc.  The opposition group will have a diverse group.  Blacks overrepresented, must have gays, disabled, women, and representatives from every ethnic group (but surprisingly enough, not so diverse when it comes to white males) regardless of their skills or competence.  While we&rsquo;re working away, they will probably be involved in selecting a Head of Diversity, and instituting lengthy diversity and sensitivity trainings.</p>
<p>Does anyone believe, for a second, that my team of overwhelmingly experienced qualified white males will be bested by this diverse hodgepodge?  Any takers for any sum of money you care to wager?</p>

					<p>It is insane the degree to which diversity hiring is present in the sciences. In my graduate school there is a program designed to specifically bring in &#8220;underrepresented&#8221; minorities- those who could not get in on merit. Before formally entering grad school, they are given a free year of tutoring in the field, many help programs, including free <span class="caps">GRE </span>coaching, a salary of $20K (which is about 10% higher than a starting grad student gets [and the grad student has to put in long hours in the lab doing research for their prof and TA classes to earn their pay], and the minority student is even is listed as a &#8220;faculty&#8221; with the benefits that come with it. There are numerous assistanceships solely for minorities to help them, they are admitted into minority scientist groups with peer mentoring and networking for assistance in landing a job after they graduate. None of this is for the non-minority student. Despite all of the help and assistance, many still never manage to make it through the program, usually failing at prelim exam time, when their academic and intellectual chops are put to the test. One such individual was a Puerto Rican girl, who loudly complained about the US at every turn, but seemed not to mind the free ride, of course. It also annoyed me that she would even be considered for such a thing- what could we possibly owe to foreign citizens as underrepresented minorities?</p>
<p>Prior to grad school, I worked at a company as a technician, and saw many instances of preference for minorities. There are actually laws which require that foreign workers must receive a certain minimum amount for a given job- yet it was okay to pay us, the American workers with equal skill and performance less than a foreign worker.</p>
<p>There are many more examples I could give, but frankly I get so disgusted thinking about the state of things that the liberals have created, that I don&rsquo;t want to get any more fired up right now.</p>

<p>&gt; I am not Eugene, but I do.  I have a now old documentary film in which a medical internist shows that the virus is half Sheep Bithmus virus and half Cow Smallpox virus.  The union of these molecular parts could not have occurred naturally but had to be forced in a labroatory.  It also presents documents that are verified wherein the requests for and plans for a T-Cell killing virus are requested and developed.  A documentary like this one aired in the mid 1990s on <span class="caps">PBS </span>in the <span class="caps">U.S., </span>but were never repeated - someone put an end to it.  I am not a supporter of conspiracy theories, but if this is one, then they got the various agencies involved to create documents over a 20 year period.  One report of the request for a T-Cell killing virus (in 1969) showed up in 1978 in the London Times and was afterward suppressed but is reviewed in the documentary I have.</p>
<p>It appears that <span class="caps">HIV </span>may have been a germ warfare experiment that got out of hand or that it was co-opted in a failed (so-far) attempt at controlling a burgeoning third world population sponsored by the World Health Organization&rsquo;s smallpox vaccination program in Africa.</p>

<p>I remember being surprised by the movie <em>Apollo 13</em>.  I wasn&rsquo;t surprised that they unfairly maligned the executives at Grumman by depicting them as mostly concerned with covering their asses   &mdash;   that was just the typical Hollywood swipe at well-to-do white businessmen, and a ham handed attempt to insert more conflict than was necessary into the movie.  Nor was I surprised that they showed the space capsule swinging wildly back and forth when they tried to align it for reentry   &mdash;   arguably they could not have conveyed the difficulty of the maneuver without greatly exaggerating the motions.  But I was shocked, shocked I tell you, that they accurately portrayed the 60s <span class="caps">NASA </span>engineers as all being white men, which they were.  I imagine that there must have been pressure somewhere to have one third of them women, one third of them black, and making the hero who comes up with the solution gay.</p>

					<p><i>I am not Eugene, but I do. I have a now old documentary film in which a medical internist shows that the virus is half Sheep Bithmus virus and half Cow Smallpox virus.</i></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know anything about &#8220;sheep bithmus virus&#8221; but I do know that the variola virus that causes smallpox is a <span class="caps">DNA </span>virus while <span class="caps">HIV </span>is a retrovirus   &mdash;   it is <span class="caps">RNA </span>based and uses reverse transcriptase to convert the <span class="caps">RNA </span>to <span class="caps">DNA </span>within the host cell.  It seems odd to propose that an <span class="caps">RNA </span>virus would be created from a <span class="caps">DNA </span>virus.  And <span class="caps">HIV </span>doesn&rsquo;t cause the same symptoms, or attack the body in the same way, as variola.  It is known that <span class="caps">HIV </span>is similar to <span class="caps">SIV </span>  &mdash;   a virus that infects monkeys.  So the most prosaic explanation is that <span class="caps">HIV </span>is a mutated form of <span class="caps">SIV. </span> Given that monkeys are eaten in Africa and their blood is used in juju rituals there were plenty of opportunities for this jump across species to take place.  I&rsquo;ll stick with the prosaic explanation unless I see some <i>really</i> strong evidence to the contrary.</p>
