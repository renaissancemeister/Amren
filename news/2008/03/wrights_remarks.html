						<p>Nearly three hours into the electrifying Sunday service at Christ Missionary Baptist Church, Pastor Gina Stewart was damp with perspiration.</p>
<p>Crammed pews of parishioners were winding down after being taken through a vigorous torrent of jubilation, anger and praise.</p>
<p>But the South Memphis pastor wasn&rsquo;t done yet.</p>
<p>There was a more earthly issue eating at her &mdash; the recent coverage of racially charged remarks made by Rev. Jeremiah Wright of Chicago, longtime pastor of presidential candidate Barack Obama.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a CNN junkie,&#8221; Stewart said to the overwhelmingly black congregation. But she warned them not to put too much stock in the news media&rsquo;s negative portrayal of the now-retired pastor&rsquo;s sermons or hold those statements against Obama.</p>
<p>Stewart&rsquo;s sentiments are being echoed in churches across Memphis as local pastors are saying that Wright&rsquo;s remarks were taken out of context with little understanding for the long tradition of prophetic preaching that goes on in black churches.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;What Rev. Wright said was the truth &mdash; ugly truth,&#8221; said Leonard Dawson, pastor of the predominantly black Cane Creek Baptist in South Memphis. &#8220;The truth of America&rsquo;s history as it relates to African-Americans is ugly.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;You could find incriminating tidbits if you combed through the sermons of a lot of pastors with that preaching style, [Pastor Brandon Porter of Greater Community Temple Church of God in Christ] said.</p>
<p>Ministering to a membership of 4,200 with locations in East Memphis, North Memphis and Cordova, Porter said, &#8220;Everything I say to the congregation isn&rsquo;t exactly a message to the world.&#8221;</p>

					<p>&#8220;What Rev. Wright said was the truth   &mdash;   ugly truth,&#8221; said Leonard Dawson, pastor of the predominantly black Cane Creek Baptist in South Memphis. &#8220;The truth of America&rsquo;s history as it relates to African-Americans is ugly.&#8221;</p>
<p>But what is even uglier is the vast amount of condescendence paid to blacks and the many privileges they have been given by whites for the last many years.  But the more whites give them, the more they rant, rave and whine, and the more they despise whites.  That&rsquo;s what is ugly.</p>
<p>And what is equally as ugly is that the vast majority of blacks are too dimwitted to compete academically in a first world society.  They have failed miserably for the last 150 years no matter what has been attempted to elevate them, yet efforts continue unabated to allow them entrance to schools while awarding them affirmative action grades and accreditation  for &#8220;trying,&#8221; and awarding them affirmative action employment they&rsquo;re not qualified for and passing on a qualified white person.  That&rsquo;s what is really ugly.</p>
<p>But the ugliest of it all is the many black white-hating preachers and others in the black community in this country whose vitriolic spews of venom is <span class="caps">DEFENDED </span>by so many blacks, while others try to disingenuously excuse their evil behavior as the result of white racism and oppression that exists mostly only in the evil black psyche, and has nothing to do with the real world.</p>
<p>The one important thing to remember here is that the more whites have bent over backwards giving blacks that which they have not earned nor deserved the more blacks hate them for it. Is it because it reinforces their deep feelings of inferiority, or is it because blacks just need something to hate like a white whipping boy?</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, the hate wasn&rsquo;t there until whites became politically correct.  Blacks cannot live in peace with any other race, because as a group they are the least intelligent of all the races.   They know it, and they resent it bitterly.  Their hate will never stop.  <span class="caps">NEVER</span>!</p>
<p>No society that has blacks will ever know peace.</p>

					<p>For a White man, once is too much.  No White is forgiven for going to a private golf course where an employee has hung a Confederate flag in a maintenance shed.  No White stage performer is forgiven for shouting a rude racial expression at hecklers.  No White is forgiven for displaying a hangman&rsquo;s noose on his truck antenna.  Suck it in, Barak, equality demands that you be held responsible for the choices you&rsquo;ve made.   </p>

					<p>So there are two groups that hate the <span class="caps">USA </span>and all that it stands for. Both are victim groups. Both get whatever they want. Both are responsible for a disproportionate share of crime. Both blame their problems on others. Neither can claim any great accomplishments.<br>
So why does this country bend over backwards to please them?</p>

					<p>This reminds me of the time I went to see the movie &#8216;Hell Up In Harlem&rsquo; when I was a kid in Washington, DC circa 1973.  Everybody in the theater clapped when a white person got killed, so I asked my mom why they were doing that - to which she replied: &#8220;Be quiet and just clap - we want to get out of here without any trouble.&#8221;</p>

					<p>This, along with that so-called &#8220;pastor&#8221; Wright&rsquo;s &#8220;sermons&#8221; explains volumes in regard to the black contempt for all people who aren&rsquo;t black.  It also validates my long-established belief that most blacks hate whites. They&rsquo;re taught hate. </p>
<p>Imagine a constant message couched in religion that teaches resentment and living in the past.  Over time, this can do more to destroy a person&rsquo;s psychological constitution than drugs or alcohol. </p>
<p>With all this insane indoctrination witin black churches, the evidence widens when it comes to explaining the savagery that exists in black communities.  The crime and decay is merely the result of the corrupt personal government so taught by their &#8220;spiritual mentors&#8221;. </p>
<p>The chronic violence so common among blacks is no longer an issue of debate as is the fact that in spite of all other races eventually prospering after experiencing tremendous hardship, blacks stay primitive in intellect and socialization.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a Biblical scholar, not even close, but I do know that forgiveness is a major tenent of Judaism and Christianity.  As well, the story of Lot in the Old Testament shows what happens when one looks back when they&rsquo;re supposed to move on in life.  Lot&rsquo;s wife was turned into a pillar of salt due to &#8220;looking back&#8221;.  Perhaps there is a civilized and honest black minister somewhere in this country that will start with those lessons.  One could only hope.  <br>

					<p>      It&rsquo;s so ironic: there was a piece on &#8220;Sixty Minutes&#8221; about<br>
a Black Church that pays surprise visits to White Churches test-<br><br>
ing to see how racist they are. Oh Physicians, heal yourselves.<br><br>
This is the best thing to happen for White Nationalists in a <br><br>
month of Sundays. Do we have Hillary to thank? If so, she really<br><br>
dropped an H Bomb. But in this case, the enemy of our enemy is<br><br>
still our enemy. We take this result as a collateral benefit;<br><br>
there can be no gratitude to such as her.</p>

When Obama gave his speech, he pointed out that &#8220;Sunday morning is the most segregated time in America,&#8221; meaning that blacks and whites go to different churches.</p>
<p>For some reason, there was applause for that line, as if the fact was a secret that Obama was courageously pointing out.</p>
<p>In reality, it seems Sunday morning is segregated because blacks want to have their own world that is segregated from white society. <br>

					<p>Two things are starting to become common knowledge to whites because of Pastor Wright (for which we have much to thank him).</p>
<p>The first is the extent to which many if not most blacks hold extreme racist views of this nature.  Most whites are unaware of this.  But they are rapidly figuring it out by watching Wright do his thing and then watching the extreme support among blacks for those views.</p>
<p>The second is that most blacks think this behavior is acceptable.  Almost no whites are unaware of what this behavior is (vile racism, anti-semitism and anti-Americanism).  They naturally assume that the average non-racist black would reject this.  When they see that isn&rsquo;t the case, they are forced to understand the extent to which blacks are actually extremely racist.</p>
<p>This is likely to cause change in the way whites deal with blacks (see Obama IS all about change).  Charges of racism made by blacks will be ignored.  Bad behavior by blacks (crime, misconduct at work etc.) will be punished more aggressively.  Blacks will no longer be a protected group.  Those that seek to make them so (ie liberals) will find themselves marginalized.</p>
<p>Before you say it won&rsquo;t happen, understand that it is <span class="caps">ALREADY </span>happening.  Look at Obama try to weasel his way out of this.  Look at all the black people trying to minimize the import of this while the media runs a 24/7 propaganda campaign to control the damage.</p>
<p>Watch as Obama&rsquo;s poll numbers drop like an anchor and his career disintegrates.  He&rsquo;s finished politically and doesn&rsquo;t know it yet.  He can no longer win the election and, because of that, he will not be allowed to have the nomination.  In fact, he will likely lose his Senate seat over this.</p>

					<p>Anyone who actually knows or interacts with more than two American Blacks on a regular basis - and doesn&rsquo;t live in multimillion dollar mansions in Beverly Hills, etc. - is fully aware of the general contempt Blacks exhibit toward Whites. At best they merely &#8220;tolerate&#8221; Whites for employment or convenience, or acept them one at a time&hellip;but alone many, nay, most of them hate and resent us with a passion. Which is ironically similar to the stereotype of how all us wicked Whites really feel about Blacks. Alas, it isn&rsquo;t remotely so of course! No, Whites by and large have bought into the Diversity fantasy hook, line and sinker! The White man really has orhestrated his own destrution and still has no idea he done it.</p>

					<p>For decades academics and then their media friends have maintained that Blacks cannot be racists.  They ignore reality to bend facts to fit their ideology.  The media dare not report the likes of Rev. Wright and his many co-horts throughout the nation, because the ideology of the reporters is that this cannot exist.  The academics do not study this phenomenon, because from their view, it does not exist.  Indeed, for some, race does not exist, except as a social contruct.</p>
<p>The positive side of the Obama candidacy is that now clear evidence of massive anti-white racism is seen.  And this hatred is spewed from the pulpit, to many well-educated, middle-class Blacks.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">REAL </span>racism in America is anti-white racism.  It is abundant in the Black and Hispanic communities.  It is either ignored or dismissed by the academedia complex.  It is enforced by minorities through intimidation and crime, and even more so by the government elite through affirmative action.</p>
<p>One can only hope that viewing the Wright tapes will help awaken Americans so that we do something to defend ourselves from such haters.  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  HM</p>

					<p>While they are dispensing &#8220;ugly truths&#8221; about Whites, how about some ugly truths about Blacks, like high crime rates, high welfare rates, high drop-out rates, high out of wedlock pregancies, high <span class="caps">HIV </span>and <span class="caps">STD </span>rates. Excuse me for my political incorrectness, but the truth can be very ugly some time, and even harder to face.</p>

					<p>Guess it hasn&rsquo;t worked. Integration, that is. All the special privileges haven&rsquo;t done it. Giving them freedom to falsely accuse any White of racism at any time hasn&rsquo;t worked. Free college tuition while Whites pay full tuition hasn&rsquo;t worked. Guaranteed job advancement based on race hasn&rsquo;t worked. </p>

					<p>I&rsquo;m a little upset with myself. This flare-up Barack &ldquo;You are not allowed to say his middle name&rdquo; Oboma is facing over his minister kind of makes me feel like I have been blind-sided. My ignorance of the black church disturbs me as I had no idea the magnitude of the white hate doctrine being preached from the pulpit. I have now heard that there are thousands of black churches like the one Oboma attends. Some people have said most of the black churches are like this.<br>
 <br><br>
And what is this Black Nationalism being preached? What does black liberation mean? During his &ldquo;make it go away&rdquo; speech, Oboma said something about the long march. I wonder what that is all about. While I expected the mainstream news media to go to bat for Oboma, the sheer magnitude of the effort they made to gloss over the racial issue made me feel like I had been kicked in the gut. <br><br>

					<p>&#8220;the more whites give them [blacks], the more they rant, rave and whine, and the more they despise whites. That&rsquo;s what is ugly.&#8221;   &mdash;   Robert Kelly </p>
<p>Well said Robert.</p>
<p>That should be so obvious to every white person who has the tiniest glimpse of insight into how the black-mind operates. But liberalism blinds white people. Acceptance and embarrassment of liberalism is the sickness that has got us into multicultural mess we&rsquo;re in. In order to solve the black problem: First we must root out the tares of liberalism that have grown into the consciousness of whites. Only then we can start to truly judge and treat blacks according to the content of their character.<br>

					<p>These recent events with Obama &amp; Wright don&rsquo;t surprise me. As a Christian, I&rsquo;ve held the view for many years that what is preached in black churches has little to do with the gospel of Christ and more to do with the &#8220;gospel of Blackness&#8221; or Black Socialism.</p>
<p>They preach hate against whitey. Absolute hate and contempt. Most everyone (including middle class blacks) know the places to stay away from in hundreds of cities across the <span class="caps">USA.</span> While blacks and leftist whites talk about being stopped for &#8220;DWB&#8221; (Driving While Black), the truth is you can be car jacked for <span class="caps">DWW </span>or gunned down for <span class="caps">WWW </span>(Walking While White) in the wrong area of town. Like Eve Carson you can be murdered for being white but if they take your <span class="caps">ATM </span>card or 50 cents from your pocket, the useful idiots and regular imbeciles tell us that &#8220;robbery was the motive&#8221;.</p>
<p>The fact that more whites have been murdered by blacks in the past 10 years than the number of blacks lynched in the past 200 years is a fact that blind people refuse to accept. Just like the OJ trial, most blacks love it when whites are killed. <span class="caps">BTW, </span>many who were lynched were guilty. No justice, no peace? The last things blacks and the millions of liberal whites who have voted for Obama want is justice.</p>
<p>A warning to all whites and their children: If Obama were to be shot, the 1968 riots will seem mild in comparison! Beware of your travel routes - don&rsquo;t end up like Reginald Denny.</p>

					<p>Yes, blacks have hatred for white people but really do black people get along with anyone?</p>
<p>With Hispanics? With the Asian or Middle Eastern people who are crazy enough to operate store in their neighborhoods?  </p>
<p>In fact there is hatred between light and dark skinned black people.</p>

					<p>People want their president to go to a normal church, not a loud, circus-like church with a ranting preacher at the helm.  I am hopeful this will be the end of the Obama era.  I think a lot of people are waking up with an Obama hangover right now.</p>

					<p>I am gleeful that this is finally out on the man that would be our president. I have known for years Blacks hated Whites, most of it secretely(amongst themselves). Nearly all harbor it and agree with what &#8220;Rev.&#8221; Wright had to say. Some are better than others at covering it up when in the presense of Whites. </p>
<p>I am a white male RN and I can tell you that the &#8220;reverse&#8221; racism I have felt from them over the past years (at work in a hospital in various departments) is sometimes unbearable. No one until now has much listened to me. Now even the mainstream media is taking what I have been saying for years seriously.</p>
<p>White America will forever have to deal with their Black problem. I say &#8220;their&#8221; because in a sense, as White people, we are responsible for this mess. At the end of the Civil War, Whites should have done the right thing: promptly return them to the African continent. An America without Blacks(or Mexicans for that matter) would be a utopia. To imagine what <span class="caps">ALL </span>of America would be like, observe how Whites live in nearly all White cities now that still exist. One thing I&rsquo;ve observed (in these cities - cities for example like Helena, Montana or Portland, Maine) that no one else seems to: Whites can live in the inner city(sometimes actually in the downtown district!) without any real fear of crime. They can come in and out of their homes freely and enjoy the city their ancestors created. <br>

					<p>I am pleased that other posters on this thread have picked up on an important trend in black-white relations:</p>
<p>The more whites give, the more blacks want.</p>
<p>The more whites apologize, the more blacks seek vengeance.</p>
<p>The more whites grovel, the more blacks take advantage.</p>
<p>The more whites claim to love, the more blacks profess to hate.</p>
<p>You can almost plot it on a chart:  as the white generosity/kindness arrow goes up, the black hatred arrow tracks it almost perfectly.</p>
<p>Shelby Steele was right:  &#8216;black power&rsquo; comes about not in response to &#8216;white supremacy,&rsquo; but white weakness. It&rsquo;s when that weakness is sensed that it&rsquo;s pounced on.</p>
<p>Another reason why the races aren&rsquo;t meant to co-exist.</p>

					<p>The world famous preacher reverend Cecil Williams of San Franciscos Glide Memorial Church once said that he(in the past, he said)hated white people.I wonder if it really is in the past, or the past and present?</p>

					<p>Above, reference was made to &#8220;DWB&#8221;, driving while black. A good friend of mine is a cop. He aaid it is not Driving While Black that gets them stopped. It is &#8220;driving <span class="caps">LIKE </span>a black&#8221;. Speeding, running signals and stopsigns, turning in front of other people, zooming past pedestrians very very close, and driving up the wrong side of the street to beat a left-turn signal.</p>
<p>Oh, and my friend? He&rsquo;s black. He hasn&rsquo;t the time of day for most blacks and is sick of hearing the excuses.</p>

					<p>The honorable and courageous, Rev. Jesse Lee Peterson, points out in his book &#8220;Scam&#8221; how bigotry is being preached from the pulpits in black churches throughout the country. The Rev. Writes of the world are more common than not in black churches.</p>

					<p>Racial pride in the black community should be applauded when it is deserved, as it should in the white community, but irrational statements like Reverand Wright&rsquo;s blaming the United States for infecting blacks with <span class="caps">AIDS </span>is beyond the pale. Gee Wiz, everyone knows that it was South Africa, not the United States, who invented the <span class="caps">AIDS </span>virus.</p>

					<p>Just because you feel you have to tell &#8216;ugly truths&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to act ugly in the telling of the truth. </p>
<p>Wright&rsquo;s psychotic ranting, cursing and name-calling is a disgrace any time and any place, but especially in church during a Sunday morning worship service.</p>

					<p>Did Rev. Wright reveal his bitterness for Whites when he said Hillary was never told she wasn&rsquo;t white enough? The man has a great deal of white ancestry in him, which is apparent in his features and skin tone. Looks like his hate speeches are designed to prove he is black enough. Come to think of it, this might be the same exact reason Obama has been a follower of his since his 20&rsquo;s</p>

<p>The problem is that &#8220;racism,&#8221; like all neologisms of the Trotskyite left, is so foggy by design that it can mean anything anyone wants it to mean. Racial violence is &#8220;racist,&#8221; if it&rsquo;s white-on-black, but not the reverse. Believing in scientific data concerning genetics and race, genetics and <span class="caps">IQ, </span>or genetics and predisposition to violence is &#8220;racist.&#8221; Observing the brute fact that black populations left to their own devices never progress beyond the Stone Age (or, to be very charitable, the Iron Age) is &#8220;racist.&#8221; Statistics on academic achievement are an artifact of &#8220;racism,&#8221; and so on, ad nauseam.</p>
<p>Whites&rsquo; best option would be to forget about &#8220;racism&#8221; altogether; it&rsquo;s merely a cudgel with which to beat whites, and never anything else. I&rsquo;m much more comfortable pointing out that Wright hates white people and wished them harm than I am in accusing him of &#8220;racism;&#8221; the latter is disingenuously abstract, the former concrete.</p>

<p>Excellent point Cass. But I got to thinking, you know, about racism and all&hellip;and I&rsquo;ve developed the theory that blacks really don&rsquo;t hate whites for putting them through slavery and all that kind of stuff. I think they&rsquo;ve always hated themselves and blame whites for it. Their hatred of whites really stems from their feelings of inferiority to us. Does that make sense?<br>

					<p>Very good and very important point by Cassiodorus: </p>
<p>&#8216;The problem is that &ldquo;racism,&rdquo; like all neologisms of the Trotskyite left, is so foggy by design that it can mean anything anyone wants it to mean.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve thought about this a lot lately, and intended to post about it. When I hear the term &#8220;racist&#8221;, it signals exactly one thing: rational discussion has ended (if indeed it happened at all), and name-calling has started. That&rsquo;s the time to challenge the premise and/or disengage  &mdash;  it is certainly not time to deny the thoughtcrime of &#8220;racism&#8221;. To take the accusation seriously  &mdash;  to even worry about it  &mdash;  is to lose the argument before it even starts.</p>
<p>This is why I cringe when I see or read of any more-or-less aware person say &#8220;I&rsquo;m not a racist, but&hellip;&#8221; That&rsquo;s the sign of successful Establishment programming: acceptance of being a loser. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t brag about it, but I acknowledge being a &#8220;racist&#8221; in exactly the same sense I am a &#8220;Copernicist&#8221;  &mdash;  I believe the earth goes around the sun. Shocking!</p>

					<p>In reality, it seems Sunday morning is segregated because blacks want to have their own world that is segregated from white society. </p>

<p>Prof. Kevin McDonald studied this phenomenon and the reasons why&hellip;.they do not stand on their own. Nothing just happens&hellip;everything is cause and effect!</p>
