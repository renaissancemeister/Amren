						<p>Displaying nooses in public places and work sites would become a hate crime under legislation approved unanimously Monday by the Judiciary Committee.</p>
<p>Lawmakers fell short, however, of an outright ban on displays &mdash; on private property, in particular &mdash; because of constitutional rights to free speech, allowing private-property owners to proclaim their biases.</p>
<p>The proposal was provoked by a series of recent incidents throughout the state, including in the Bridgeport Police Department, where nooses have been displayed where minorities would be sure to see it.</p>
<p>The bill as drafted would protect people who hang nooses on their own property or on private property with the written permission of the owner. It would be an expansion of the state&rsquo;s 1980 law that categorized burning crosses as hate crimes. It depends on proof that there would be intent to intimidate based on a person&rsquo;s race, national origin, religion or other general requirements under existing law.</p>
<p>If the bill is approved before the Legislature&rsquo;s May 7 deadline and is signed into law, it would create a Class A misdemeanor, punishable by a year in prison and a $2,000 fine. &#8220;I think it&rsquo;s an important statement that the Legislature should make,&#8221; said Rep. Michael P. Lawlor, D-East Haven, co-chairman of the committee.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the dilemma with hate crimes,&#8221; Lawlor said. &#8220;People have the constitutional right to be a bigot if they want to. Free-speech rights protect them. My feeling is this is as far as we can go.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said that as &#8220;outrageous&#8221; as the displaying of a noose may be, making the law any tougher could cause the whole thing to be struck down as unconstitutional.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 43-0 committee vote sends the legislation to the House floor.</p>

					<p>Will the same standard apply to gang grafitti,?? which is used to intimidate others ? also I am pretty sure gang violence has killed more blacks in the last 15, years than nooses have in the last 10,000 years.</p>

					<p>You can bet more and more nooses will be planted, aimed at implicating whites. This noose law was clearly intended to hang whites upon. Whether guilty or not.</p>

					<p>&#8220;One of the proud things about our country is we&rsquo;re tolerant and don&rsquo;t have the patience with people who aren&rsquo;t tolerant,&#8221; Lawlor said.</p>
<p>Tolerant of doublespeak, he must mean. (In his quoted statement, substitute &#8220;tolerance&#8221; for &#8220;patience&#8221;)</p>

					<p>Ain&rsquo;t this a slippery slope!</p>
<p>What about Wild West displays in museums?  What about Old West town re-creations?  What about rodeos (isn&rsquo;t a lasso a noose of sorts?)?  John Wayne movies?  Haunted house decor?</p>
<p>But I must not be up on current events, because I hadn&rsquo;t heard of these noose incidents throughout Connecticut.  Anyone else?</p>

					<p>Where are the officials out there who have a responsibility to hurt down the perpertrators of &#8220;love Crimes&#8221;??? I don&rsquo;t know <span class="caps">ANY </span>crime committed out of anything <span class="caps">BUT </span>hate, so why the differentiation? Sounds like minorities sure get their feelings hurt easily. If something was bothering me in my sight I just wouldn&rsquo;t look at it. Guess that is what separates the races. I don&rsquo;t see everything in any museum as art, but I defend anyone&rsquo;s right to display it as such. If it offends me I don&rsquo;t <span class="caps">HAVE </span>to look atit&hellip;.Why do the blacks have the sole responsibility to tell officials what is &#8220;racially offensive&#8221; ????</p>

<p>&#8220;Old Hangtown,&#8221; (AKA Placerville, my hometown) where nooses are plastered on everything from business signs to little league uniforms, should be prepared to have its history erased with a pen stroke.</p>

<p>Strange they don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s worth their time to pass laws against preaching hate in black churches, since the practise is rampant and widespread and is the basis for inciting thousands of black on white assaults, murders and property crimes every year.</p>

					<p>I better study up on my knots. I wouldn&rsquo;t want to make one who&rsquo;s design leaves me open to prosecution. Be carefull if you work on a farm and use pullys, or do warehouse work, it could be dangerous in more ways than one. I think I&rsquo;ll see Uncle Jack  &mdash;   Daniels now. It&rsquo;s too much.</p>

					<p>Funny to think that some of these &#8220;noose hate crimes&#8221; were shown to have been perpetrated by the black &#8220;victims&#8221; themselves. Just the sight of a rope in 2007 was enough to fire up cries of racism, or justify the beating of Whites (as in the case of the Jena Six farce).</p>
<p>Now more invasive thought crime bills are on the way to pass into law in the name of these absurd events, and will probably only invite more restrictions on our personal freedoms. Sort of like an &#8220;blaxploitation&#8221; version of the Reichstag fire.</p>

					<p>   We are now officially building our own gulags; stud by stud, joist by joist, rafter by rafter . I guess next we will have to fill out surveys,much like the ones corporations require when deciding just who to fire, only these will much more serious implications .Aided by our internet habits and phone records, maybe even private conversations within the walls of our own homes picked up by government eavesdropping equipment and shown as irrefutable evidence we are indeed hate criminals and belong in those gulags .If the Founders were alive today they would have us nuked&hellip;. no, I&rsquo;m wrong on that, they would be in the gulags with the rest of us, wondering what the heck happened to their noble idea .   </p>

					<p>Well, while we protect the sensitive Afro- Americans against the  epidemic scourge of noose dislays, another White person has met an untimely death at the hands of a gang of Afro-Truants in a subway station. <br>
Sean Mc Elroy 36,  a  manager at a Starbucks in Center City Philly was on the train platform when he was attacked.  He suffered a heart attack and died. One &#8220;YOUF&#8221; is in custody and <span class="caps">PPD </span>is looking for several other &#8220;YOUFS&#8221;. The arrested &#8220;YOUF&#8221; was 16 years old and was truant from Simon Gratz High School.  Police say that they don&rsquo;t have a motive for the attack ( as if the &#8220;YOUFS&#8221; need a motive other than the victim being White ) but are investigating.<br><br>
Sean was engaged to be married. </p>
<p>This is the link.</p>
<p><a href="http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=news/local&amp;id=6043617" rel="nofollow">http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=news/local&id=6043617</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile in the once but no longer beautiful Strawberry Mansion section of the city, police responded to a shots being fired call and were confronted by two &#8220;men&#8221;, one of whom pointed a weapon at them and was fired upon by the police. He was wounded in the leg and later died at the hospital. <br>
I&rsquo;m sure that the high pitched screaming and wailing will begin and officers will be suspended and maybe even Jesse and Al will visit Philly.<br><br>
Meanwhile Sean&rsquo;s family and fiancé will bury him quietly and everyone save his survivors and co-workers will have forgotten him in a few months.<br><br>

					<p>I think if anyone would research hanging, more whites were hung than blacks. Look at the record of Judge Roy Bean. </p>
<p>Our tax money and the governments time could be better spent dealing with illegal immigration, the economy and a host of other much more important issues.</p>
<p>But no, they need to investifate steroids, nooses, drivers licenses and a bridge to no where.</p>
<p>Lost <span class="caps">FEMA </span>and Homeland Security. They are just money pits anyway. New Orleans had the pleasure of receiving their help and it has worked out quite well, don&rsquo;t ya think?!?!?</p>
<p>I whish that on the election ballet there was a box to check entitled &#8220;None of the Above&#8221;. Chosing no one would be a vast improvement over a &#8220;do nothing&#8221;.</p>

					<p>I know of no reason why a noose should be displayed at any work site or public place, so employers, business owners, etc. would have every right to disallow them. However, it&rsquo;s ridiculous to make hanging one a crime, and of course, the phrase &#8220;hate crime&#8221; is ridiculous.</p>

					<p>A unanimous denouncement of nooses and hate. No word on the 1 million acts of real crime commited each year against whites at the hands of blacks alone. If only they were hate crimes&hellip; Wait. They already are. </p>

					<p>Who&rsquo;ll be the first white to be sentenced to 2-10 years in prison- far longer than myriads of blacks convicted of aggravated assaults, muggings, armed robberies, rapes, even murders- because a black used a noose in a &#8220;hate crime&#8221; hoax. And unless he&rsquo;s placed in solitary confinement <del>23 hours a day in a toilet with bars day after week after month after year</del> he&rsquo;ll be harassed, tormented, assaulted, gang-raped, sexually-enslaved, and possibly murdered by blacks.</p>

					<p>On my google homepage I have a game called hangman, and if I play it there is a noose.  I guess hangman will have to be forbidden on google and in all schools.  I can also recall when some on the left referred to a <span class="caps">NYC </span>newspaper as the Daily Noose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hate crimes&#8221; are thought crimes, and should be abolished.  On the other hand, all crimes are hate crimes.  But liberals never want to enforce stringent sentences when minorities violently assault, rape, or murder whites.  The enemy of justice, of equal sentencing, of punishing the perps, is invariably the liberal.  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -HM</p>

					<p>The utter <span class="caps">STUPIDITY </span>of this kind of legislation blows my mind. But maybe it&rsquo;s meant to get peoples&rsquo; minds of thinking about <span class="caps">REAL </span>stuff. Like the article on today&rsquo;s <span class="caps">MSN</span> News&hellip; </p>
<p>That Chicago is having a murder problem&hellip; BY <span class="caps">TEENS,</span> OF <span class="caps">TEENS</span>! Expectedly, of course, victims and perps being our typical dysfunctional Blacks!!!</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m waiting for the inevitable histrionics by Lying Hillary and Phony Obams. Both telling us the only solution being to throw <span class="caps">MORE </span>money at the dysfunctional Black population. To <span class="caps">WASTE </span>more money for more schools   &mdash;   for the little darlings to destroy in sheer ignorance and boredom. Nor can we afford to overlook legislation <span class="caps">STRIPPING </span>decent citizens of their right to own defensive guns, right?</p>
<p>What drives Blacks to act like that? Fueling their mentality? It sure as hell can&rsquo;t be blamed on White racism. Most of these &#8220;poor, misunderstood&#8221; youths will drop out of school. End up unable to find a job (for lack of education, skills   &mdash;   the usual qualities a hiring manager looks for in interviewing applicants. Then these &#8220;poor frustrated&#8221; youths will become career criminals and end up in those jails&hellip; Jeremiah Wright blames us for building&hellip; and of course, without a shred of doubt the whole mess is due to White racism, 350 years of slavery (poor math skills,remember?) and segregation! While the Jeremiah Wrights will rail and rant to their gullible flocks week after week laying the blame on us Whites!</p>

					<p>How about making it a hate crime when a non-White rapes a White girl? Or robs an elderly White guy at an <span class="caps">ATM</span>? <br>
Never happen, because &#8220;hate crime&#8221; laws were created for one purpose and one purpose only: to put more Whites in jail and let the left claim that all Whites are racist.<br><br>

					<p> What a bunch of spineless lemmings those committee members were! Can you imagine any other type of legislation other than, maybe, something in favor of mom, the flag and apple pie, passing a legislative committee 43-0? What a joke! They&rsquo;re soooo scared to be put on the record as registering even the faintest opposition to something supported by the civil rights establishment.</p>
<p> I also liked the one legislator&rsquo;s remark about how we&rsquo;re such a tolerant nation that&rsquo;s intolerant (he might as well have used that word) of those who are intolerant! Did this moron realize what nonsense he was spouting?!</p>

					<p>Like so many have already posted, you are going to have a rash of blacks hanging &#8220;nooses&#8221; on everything in sight so whites will be blamed for it and if indeed a black is caught hanging one of those &#8220;nooses&#8221; absolutely nothing will happen to them. This type of legislation is the ultimate exercise in stupidity and anyone involved with it should lose their jobs weather they are Congressman, Senators, Governors, Mayors or even President of the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>because &#8220;we&#8221; the good and decent people of this country are indeed tired of paying their salaries for reckless and insane legislature when they really need to address the real problems concerning America, not this ridiculous politically correct bull that appeases only those who neither pay those legislators salaries  or contribute anything useful at all to their fellow Americans. &#8220;ENOUGH IS <span class="caps">ENOUGH ALREADY</span>&#8221;  </p>

					<p>Noosephobia is the latest craze to hit urban America since hiphop.  40% graduation rates have failed to scare Whitey enough to move further out into the countryside, I bet noosephobia won&rsquo;t work either.</p>

 <br><br>
 Better watch out for those neckties too Bobby! loosening or fiddling with your necktie around a sensitive Black person could be seen as provocative hate-action.</i></i></p>
<p> BTW, is it only a crime if its a Black person who sees a noose?  <br>
This is just getting ludicrous, like the Muslims with their pigs, dogs and alcohol sensitivities,Blacks have got to learn to get over themselves. They will never be successful until they leave the past behind and stop complaining.  Hundreds of White people were lynched too. <br><br>

					<p>Well, I guess this ends the time-honored custom of hanging in effigy.  Come to think of it, everybody I&rsquo;ve ever seen hanged in effigy was white, so I guess it&rsquo;s <span class="caps">OK.</span></p>

					<p>Since I have always been one to fly in the face of convention, I&rsquo;m printing up some T-shirts with a noose on them, along with the slogan &#8220;No noose is good noose&#8221;<br>
Anyone interested? </p>

					<p> I just looked up noose in the dictionary and sho,nuf theres a picture of a noose. Will we all have to burn our dictionarys? What if you are in a library and you have the page open to the n,s? Will you be charged with public display of a noose? Will the library? Will the bookmaker? What a slippery slope. Blacks will not be happy till they destroy every white person like they did on Haiti. Then they declared their independence. Just look at the paradise they made of that island. Funny how they want to get on boats and come here. They,re creating a new paradise in Zimbabwe now and South Africa will be next. I like how Oprah made her billion in this country, but instead of doing something here she goes to Africa. Give something back but not where whites might get some benefit. But why not Gates made his fortune here but has to give a lot of it away overseas. What i never understand is why none of these billionaires dont give something to veterans.</p>

<p>Nope.  Lawfully, you have freedom of speech <span class="caps">EVERYWHERE, </span>not just on you own personal property or specially-designated areas.  Besides, all the public property was paid for, built, and is maintained by us evil racists.  You can&rsquo;t lawfully ban nooses and such on public property any more than you can ban prayer or the Ten Commandments.  Yes, I know, they claim to have done so (and most idiots go right along with it) but it is not lawful to do so.  The Constitution of the the United States of America is in full force and effect everywhere in this country whether the various and sundry Marxist governments and their hired thugs like it or not.</p>
