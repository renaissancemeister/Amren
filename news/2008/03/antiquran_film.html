						<p>Muslims in several countries are protesting a film by a Dutch lawmaker&rsquo;s film, saying it insults the Quran.</p>
<p>Hundreds of Islamists staged angry protests across Pakistan after the release of the film and a militant allegedly linked to al-Qaida&rsquo;s No 2 leader also warned that the film will spark reprisal attacks.</p>
<p>Small groups of demonstrators, mostly followers of hard-line religious groups, rallied in major cities, demanding Pakistan cut diplomatic relations with the Netherlands. A banner at one demonstration read, &#8221; We hate the uncivilized West.&#8221;</p>
<p>The film has verses from the Quran against a background of violent images of terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>These include the 9/11 attacks in the US and the 2004 Madrid train bombings. The film starts and ends with the controversial Danish cartoons on Prophet Mohammad.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Protests have been simmering for weeks over the recent republication in Danish newspapers of cartoons of Prophet Muhammad, and authorities are concerned the Dutch film could spark the kind of violent unrest that the cartoons originally provoked two years ago.</p>
<p>A militant believed linked to al-Qaida&rsquo;s deputy chief Ayman al-Zawahri told The Associated Press in the northwestern city of Peshawar last week militants would mount revenge attacks against foreigners because of Wilders&rsquo; film.</p>
<p>&#8220;Foreigners will be attacked. The situation will change, change, change,&#8221; said Qari Mohammed Yusuf, whose also said his two brothers died fighting alongside al-Zawahri.</p>

<p>They have a point if the dutch were civilized they would blow up every mosque,behead imams and rape the infidel muslim women.I for one hope that Fitna wins an academy award for best short subject.Maybe the Muslims will do the civilized thing and kill everyone at the Oscars including Steven Spielberg and Sarah Jessica Parker.But please in the Name of Allah spare Mel Gibson.Oh and don&rsquo;t forget the Emmys.</p>

					<p>They threaten to attack if Islam is described as &#8216;violent&rsquo;, so does that not prove the point?<br>
I don&rsquo;t know if they are willfully blind or just plain stupid.</p>

					<p>Ironic: A film is produced that criticizes Islam for its violent nature. The reaction: Violent protests.</p>

					<p>These promised &#8220;reprisals&#8221; are really nothing of the kind.  We Westerners would be subjected to the same attacks whether Wilders&rsquo; existed or not.</p>

					<p>Talk about guerilla marketing!  For inexplicable reason people are often drawn to things that they find taboo.  I&rsquo;m sure if these muslims cared enough about the film to protest they were probably more likely to watch it than most.</p>
<p>There is probably immense hatred toward the film, yet its that very hatred which will ironically propel it to some sort of commercial and cultural success.</p>
<p>I think the film maker should do a tour of the muslim world.  Could he get killed absolutely.  Could he enjoy immense success for his film: definitely!  </p>
<p>Fame and fortune are here for the taking and the producers and makers of this film shouldn&rsquo;t squander an immense commercial opportunity.</p>

					<p>Cut &#8216;diplomatic relations&rsquo;.?  (&#8216;diplomatic&rsquo;-tact, of conducting relations between countries) The western world is going to have to puff up it&rsquo;s chest. It&rsquo;s us against them. Since when do those crazies think they have to abide by any law, creed, ideology other than their own? They do whatever they want and they&rsquo;re gaining ground(converts, law appeasement, citizenship, country intrusion). </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s their book, they know what it says.<br>
It&rsquo;s their actions, they know what they did.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s &#8216;ON&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s been &#8216;ON&rsquo;. We can&rsquo;t be too comfortable with the way we live and what we&rsquo;ve always depended on. We have to stand up for ourselves. Prayer is good. God is Good, not their Allah.  </p>

					<p>Isn&rsquo;t it just like them to threaten to kill somebody who accuses them of violence, making them even gultier of stupidity.</p>
<p>And, speaking of stupidity, how smart is it being in someone else&rsquo;s country holding up a sign in their language stating you&rsquo;re going to take them over?</p>
<p>They remind me of many black groups here in this country.</p>

					<p>Wait until the proffessionaly outraged get their zombie army of dime-jihaddists out rioting. Based on the precedents it might take a couple of weeks. But the rioting will probably start in Denmark, Sweden, and of course France, where a low level intifada is always simmering anyway. Embassies and cultural symbols will be attacked and burned in Muslim pest-holes around the world. People will die. And it will all be blamed on the White Christian European who exersized his centuries old tradition of free speech and critical thinking. </p>

					<p>Someone once said: &#8220;Its like the 1930&rsquo;s all over again everyone knows what&rsquo;s comming&#8221; actually i forget the exact words they used, but that was the jist of it. It just struck me as correct, we all know what&rsquo;s comming, but some are in a state of denial, they think Muslims are going to start to intergrate into the west, any day, now. They just don&rsquo;t see that:<br>
&#8216;ISLAM IS <span class="caps">THE RELIGION</span> OF <span class="caps">PEACE</span> IN <span class="caps">OUR TIME </span>&#8216;</p>

					<p>Wonder what is going to happen to muslim rage when it meets General OutRage by the rest of the population. They can be sent home or they can be hanged. When they cross that line and incur General OutRage, then they will whine for mercy. Beautify the west, Deport a muslim!</p>

					<p>Interesting that Wilders just showed film of muslims talking to other muslims. All the footages were already available on Youtube, there was nothing new! If muslims dont like that, why not take it up with their Imams instead?<br>
It just highlights the hypocracy behind Islam!<br><br>
My favorite placard is still &#8220;Kill those who accuse us of violence&#8221;.</p>
