<p>By Monday, 93 people had been killed in Los Angeles this year, compared with 69 during the same period last year &mdash; a nearly 35% increase. As the weeks pass, the bloodshed in 2008 grows worse than the previous year. Two weeks ago, for example, the increase in the homicide rate over last year stood at 27%. The rise is also outpacing those in New York City and Chicago &mdash; cities that have seen significant, but less dramatic, increases this year, according to Det. Jeff Godown, who oversees the LAPD&rsquo;s extensive effort to analyze crime statistics.</p>
<p>In addressing the commission, however, Beck and Godown hammered on a message that top police officials have been sounding for weeks: that neither race nor any other single factor can explain the increase in homicides.</p>
<p>In fact, they said, department statistics for this year found that in cases in which police have information about the suspect, the vast majority of alleged assailants in the killings of Latinos were other Latinos and the vast majority in killings of blacks were other blacks.</p>
<p>Of 57 Latinos killed this year, 87% are believed to have been struck down by other Latinos, the LAPD data show. (Those statistics do not include several cases in which the race of the suspect is unknown and one case in which the assailant is white.)</p>
<p>Nearly two-thirds of black homicide victims, meanwhile, are suspected to have been killed by other blacks. In about one of every three cases, the killer is thought to be Latino &mdash; up from 14% over all of 2007. But even in instances in which a Latino is believed to have killed a black person or vice versa this year, police insist that there is no evidence that points to race being the primary factor in the homicide.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyone who is saying that race is not a factor at all is not completely in touch with the feelings of people on the streets,&#8221; said John Hope Bryant, chairman of Operation HOPE. Referring to Shaw, Bryant said police would be &#8220;hard pressed to tell people on the streets that it is not about race &hellip; when two Hispanics approach you with a clear energy that is about race and shoot you dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>Earl Ofari Hutchinson, a political analyst who heads the Urban Policy Roundtable, echoed Bryant.</p>
<p>&#8220;They do not want to inflame tensions; I understand that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they also must not disarm a community by not fully coming to grips with the possibility&#8221; that race is a factor in some cases.</p>
<p>Despite the new numbers from the LAPD, authorities have said in the past that race-based violence has been a problem in some L.A. neighborhoods. Federal prosecutors last year charged members of a Latino gang with a violent campaign to drive blacks out of the unincorporated Florence-Firestone neighborhood, which allegedly resulted in 20 homicides over several years.</p>
<p>In the Harbor Gateway district of L.A., police launched a crackdown last year on another Latino gang accused of targeting blacks, including 14-year-old Cheryl Green, whose death became a rallying point. In 2006, members of the Avenues, a Latino gang, were convicted in federal court for a series of assaults and killings in the early 1990s targeting blacks in Highland Park.</p>

					<p>&hellip;and the 1 white who killed a Black or Latino last year? Definitely a hate crime.</p>

					<p>&#8220;&hellip;..the vast majority of alleged assailants in the killings of Latinos were other Latinos and the vast majority in killings of blacks were other blacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Which means, of course, that there are still inter-racial killings occurring, but they don&rsquo;t comprise the &#8220;vast majority.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s hardly reassuring, however, because for a racial situation to evolve to a point where armed conflict between the races might ensue, it isn&rsquo;t necessary for killings to comprise the &#8220;vast majority,&#8221; only that they DO occur, which is enough to cause the situation to erupt into a race war.</p>
<p>Only when the race war finally explodes will the &#8220;vast majority&#8221; of murders be inter-racial.  Right now they&rsquo;re in the initial stages, with every indication things will get far worse, especially if the economy plummets.</p>

					<p>The PC <span class="caps">LAPD </span>says no racial thang here, folks&hellip;.All our Police Dept. have also been indoctrinated with PC and sensitivity training&hellip;..Can you imagine that they will soon be targeting Whites only to make the jails and prisons to make it &#8220;equal&#8221; for all? Whites had better do something <span class="caps">NOW </span>and not a year from now! Those that are too dumbed down need to get out of the way and the racially aware Whites better decide the best action to take to save this nation from destruction.</p>

					<p>I&rsquo;m not so sure the info with regard to hispanics is reliable.  Let me explain.  There are &#8220;white&#8221; hispanics and there are &#8220;black&#8221; hispanics.  Although it can be difficult for a non-hispanic to tell the difference, hispanics themselves absolutely know who is who.  There is an <span class="caps">INCREDIBLE </span>amount of racist hate and violence between the two groups.  The issue is compounded by the fact that many times, hispanics from different nations hate each other with equal intensity.  When brought together into mixed neighborhoods and <span class="caps">ESPECIALLY </span>when forced together in the prison system, the result is gang warfare along national and racial differences.  To an outside observer it looks like an unexplained increase in the crime rate.  What is actually is, is urban warfare.</p>
<p>There is only one solution.  Round up the lot of them and deport them.</p>

					<p>Ol&rsquo; Earl Ofari Hutchinson is a piece of work.  He is one of the Talented Tenth, those black bloodsuckers who live off affirmative action and try to persuade their fellow blacks that Mexicans love them.</p>
<p>At their Talented Tenth cocktail parties with the black movers and shakers of <span class="caps">LA, </span>they congratulate each other about their jobs and reputation while regular black folks are shot off their doorsteps.</p>
<p>Ol&rsquo; Earl, like all the other overeducated blacks who live in white neighborhoods, tried to pimp open borders to black working class folks and got his head handed to him on a platter by working class black folks.  </p>
<p>Now the boy has changed his tune a bit, although he still likes to make nice to Mexicans illegals.  He still likes to preach &#8220;dat ole debbil white man&#8221;, but he knows his black over-educated, upper-middle class race-hustling rainbow alliance ain&rsquo;t going nowhere with regular black folks who have to dodge Mexican bullets.</p>

					<p>How much longer are we going to put up with these lies perpetrated by the government or groups that are behind the problems of multiculturalism that we face?  First they lie and say that Immigration lowers crime, meaning: don&rsquo;t worry its good to flood our country with anyone who wants to come. Then they lie and deny the race war that is already errupting on the west coast between blacks and Hispanics.  Tell the blacks who are being squeezed out in place like Compton via gang violence that it is not about race.  These traitors in places of authority have to be held accountable for attempting to pacify the American people into mindless submission. Americans have to start standing up and demanding the truth!  </p>

					<p>Lies and more lies by the worthless <span class="caps">L.A.</span> Police Chief Bratton and his boss ex-gangbanger Antonio Villaraigosa, who came on local television and claimed that there is no racial aspect to all of the shootings. <span class="caps">LIERS</span>! Just recently two Mexican girls standing in front of their own house were mowed down by black gangbangers and the ethnic cleansing of blacks occurring in many Hispanic areas with gangs is well known to everyone who lives in Southern California. Lies, lies, and it won&rsquo;t stop until the unwillingness to face reality results in bigger problems for California.</p>

Although it can be difficult for a non-hispanic to tell the difference, hispanics themselves absolutely know who is who. &#8220;</p>
<p>Not in Los Angeles.  Practically all hispanics are &#8220;white&#8221; (Mestizo) hispanics.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hispanics kill Hispanics; blacks kill other blacks.</p>
<p>And they all kill whites.&#8221;</p>
<p>No, actually most whites are also killed by whites.</p>

					<p>I was recently in california and go quite regular cause of family, and was really suprised to hear hispanics attitude towards blacks, man they hate them, also a lot of the white kids that are left in california are sounding more and more racist everytime i go over there. Im not one for doomsday warnings but there is a real good chance southern california could burn in the not to distant future.</p>

					<p>If the murder increase is due to black-on-black and Hispanic-on-Hispanic fraternal violence, we may merely be seeing some cross-border &#8220;overflow&#8221; of the grotesque drug violence that in which Mexico is now awash.  The black and Hispanic gang members who do much of <span class="caps">L.A.&rsquo;</span>s killing <strong>are</strong> involved in the drug trade, so this would be logical.</p>

					<p>If a tree falls in the forest and no one is around, will it make a sound? If blacks and hispanics get shot on LA streets, does any liberal here them fall? Out of site, out of mind, Liberals are the first to move out of bad neighborhoods statisticly, as they tend to be renters, not owners.</p>

					<p>Earl Ofari Hutchinson is stuck in a 1960&rsquo;s time warp. He literally sees everything through that lens. Listening to him you would think that hundreds of thousands of blacks are not employed in well-paid and privileged government jobs, and have every advantage others can only dream of when opening a business,etc. I haven&rsquo;t even mentioned sports, and entertainment yet. The fact is, there will never be &#8220;EQUALITY&#8221;, because this is a concept like <span class="caps">UTOPIA, </span>which in its literally means <br/>
&#8220;NO <span class="caps">PLACE</span>&#8221;.</p>

					<p>The only people that really knows whats going on in the minds of the people in the hoods are the gangs and those living in close proximity to them.  For an outsider to make a statement like their isn&rsquo;t really a race war going on between hispanics and blacks is pure wishfull thinking.  I believe that if we could get a real true picture of the situation we would see the start of a big race war happening that could evolve into a civil war.</p>
