						<p>This is a triumphant time for black women: Condoleezza Rice in the global diplomatic spotlight, Michelle Obama captivating campaign crowds as a potential first lady, billionaire Oprah Winfrey playing political kingmaker.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a traumatic time: Rutgers University basketball players disparaged by radio host Don Imus, a black woman kidnapped and tortured by whites in West Virginia, the home-owning dreams of black women disproportionately dashed by foreclosures.</p>
<p>That remarkable mix is the focus of this year&rsquo;s State of Black America report, issued Wednesday by the National Urban League. It features essays looking at the array of challenges faced by African-American women: economic, social, psychological and medical.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The report delves deeply into economics, noting that black women are more likely than white or Hispanic women to be running a household and raising children on their own. According to Malveaux, black women hold more jobs nationwide than black men, yet &mdash; despite their breadwinner roles &mdash; earn less on average, $566 a week compared to $629 for black men.</p>
<p>In an essay about the home loan crisis, Andrea Harris, president of the North Carolina Institute for Minority Economic Development, suggests that black women have suffered disproportionately. Assessing recent federal data on subprime loans, which are a main culprit in the foreclosure epidemic, Harris says black women received far more of these loans in 2006 than white men.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>An essay by Dr. Doris Browne, a public health expert, details the above-average rates of cancer, diabetes and heart disease among black women.</p>
<p>On an upbeat note, former Labor Secretary Alexis Herman notes in her essay that black women are making huge strides as entrepreneurs. The number of businesses owned by them increased by 147 percent between 1997 and 2006, compared to an overall business growth rate of 24 percent, she wrote.</p>
<p>Another of the essayists, Melanie Campbell of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, said in an interview that disparities in health care and economics are the paramount issues for black women as the election campaign unfolds.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The president of the Urban League, a 98-year-old black empowerment organization, hailed women as &#8220;the backbone of the black family&#8221; &mdash; constantly surmounting obstacles. Marc Morial called for expansion of programs that would assist black women in starting businesses, protect more of them from predatory lending schemes, and provide more of them with affordable, high-quality child care.</p>
<p>&#8220;When black women hurt, the American family suffers,&#8221; Morial wrote. &#8220;But by uplifting black women, especially those struggling hardest to keep their families together and their dreams on track, we lift up every American community.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Yet again I am told to believe that black women are being discriminated against, underpaid, victims of violence by racist whites etc..  Of course they are disproportionately the head of their household, by default and because of their own actions.  But just go to any college, black or white, and you will see at least 10x as many black females as males.  And if they manage to graduate, private sector companies and of course the city, state and federal government absolutely fall over themselves to hire and promote them at the expense of white males.  Black females are also very status oriented, be it in homes they cant afford or driving high end cars.  </p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s pretty pathetic that mostly black single women are the backbone of black America.  Black women have such low self esteem they open their legs to any bro that comes along and they expect us White taxpayers to pay for childcare and housing?  What&rsquo;s to discourage them from this wreckless lifestyle?  Ever heard of birth control?  </p>

			<p>I was in an upscale restaurant in Washington D.C. in January. I saw at least 10 Black women in the restaurant. Some were with other Black women, some with White women and others were with non-Black men. </p>
<p>I did not see one Black man/Black woman couple in the entire restaurant. In fact, except for the waiters and other restaurant staff, I only saw two Black men period and thy were sitting together. This fact to me was very notable as I mentioned it to my wife once we left to go back to our home in Gerogetown.</p>
<p>Another poster a few months ago mentioned on this board that Black women in college outnumber Black men by 4-1. This is alarming!</p>
<p>If this fact is true than there it is no wonder that many Black women cannot find suitable mates or ae beginning to date outside thier race! </p>
<p>Can you imagine what things would be like if White women outnumbered White men 4-1 in college educated people?  </p>
<p>Black Americans (especialy Black men) had better wake up and change their situation. This will be bad news down the road if things do not change and soon. </p>

			<p>I would be considered an African American to most here (although I might be lighter skinned then some).I believe it&rsquo;s genuinely a difficult feat to classify individuals into categories that would represent them 100% accurately, since there is some level of multiple ethnicities in all of our family trees (if you dig deep enough), like it or not.Curiously, I am a big fan of the AmRen site and Jared Taylor.I agree with all of his stances on multiculturalism and his desire for free association. I see no problems with racial profiling or stereotypes of blacks or any other culture/ethnicity.I would have to be blind not to agree that the Black Culture is a nightmare, producing dangerous individuals free to roam our streets. Persons that are more than willing to play the victim role, cry racism etc instead of work for success in life.It&rsquo;s a real pathetic scene and the White Cultures/communities in this country are in grave danger. As a result, security and productivity are in danger as well. I wonder  if the greate debate of nature vs nurture even matters when it comes to blacks. Isn&rsquo;t it just as impossible to change a culture, if not more difficult than to change genes? I am a Computer Engineering graduate from a Florida university. My personal belief is that it is more of a cultural momentum that keeps blacks in the criminal/poverty way of life. A momentum of laziness, victimization, lack of personal responsibility combined white guilt that keeps it going. </p>

			<p>Continuing with my previous post&hellip;<br>
I know that multiculturalists suffer from a delusion that ignores the reality of a very real situation. It occurs to me, however, that this ability to withdraw from reality is the same one responsible for the white Christian men on this site, and for religious people of any flavor in general. It&rsquo;s the same quality delusion. You are presented with a series of facts, ignore ones that go against your biases or preconceived notions, and act like there is nothing more to be concerned about.It is the same lack of intellectual honesty responsible in both cases.My point is, that while I agree with almost 100% of the general atmosphere of this site, white Christians here share more in common with multiculturalists than they think. I do not like delusions, consider them dangerous, and don&rsquo;t lack in the critical thinking department.Maybe I&rsquo;m being obtuse, but blind faith in ideologies   or religions prevents progress. Christianity and liberalism are major factors in why fools in this country are suffering from the  multicultural delusion.</p>

			<p>The solution to the problem stated here is pretty simple: the greatest threat to black women is&hellip;&hellip;. black men.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not those dreaded White men, White women, Asians, or Hispanics.  The problem is right in the room with these women.  </p>
<p>Well, actually, the problem is that they&rsquo;re NOT in the room with them.  They&rsquo;ve broken the law and are in jail, they&rsquo;re not holding a job, they have fornicated and dropped off a child - or two or three - with the woman, they&rsquo;ve seen White women as better for their tastes, or are just too doped up to know what day of the week it is.</p>
<p>Yep, doesn&rsquo;t take 20/20 vison to see through David Crary&rsquo;s sob story. </p>

			<p>&ldquo;&hellip;a black woman kidnapped and tortured by whites in West Virginia,&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>What unmitigated GALL! <br>
First, like with the Jena MYTH, this turned out to be another misrepresented MYTH, that long after the truth came out, keeps getting endlessly repeated in Black Supremacist circles and by the willing leftwing media: This black woman was NOT kidnapped by some white strangers at random. She was not kidnapped. It turned out she was the live-in companion of one member of that white family. It was a case of DOMESTIC ABUSE. And as bad as it was, it was not as bad as INNUMERABLE cases of EVEN WORSE domestic abuse of white women by black men, which is COMMON whereas the reverse is RARE. A few recent black on white cases included the MURDER by a black male (Bobby Cutts) in Canton OH of  his pregnant white mistress. Or the kidnapping, MURDER, and cannibalism by a black male in Tyler TX of his white girlfriend. Or the white girl (Olivia Jackson, and pregnant) murdered by her black boyfriend (Sedale Fox, the father of her unborn child), in Leavenworth KS. The list could go on endlessly. But notice, unlike the far less serious white on black domestic abuse case (that did not involve murder), no one makes a RACIAL issue out of these far MORE serious black on white cases, that DID involve murder!</p>
<p>And if you want some recent TRUE examples of random interracial sexual violence: <br>
An Eastern Michigan University black male student broke into the dorm room of a white female student last year, raping and murdering her. <br>
In New York&rsquo;s Hamiltion Heights near Columbia University, a white Columbia journalism student was attacked in her apartment by a black who raped, sodomized and tortured her for hours on end: He cut her eyelids off, poured bleach on her genitals to try to destroy the evidence and force fed her painkillers in an effort to fake suicide. The overdose of medication virtually destroyed her liver. He also scalded her with boiling water, repeatedly using a teapot. According to reports, every time the victim heard the whistling of the teapot, she begged her black attacker to kill her. (Borrowed from Mike 5/4 post of this news story.)  <br>
The carjacking, kidnapping, rape, torture, and murder of a white couple (Christopher Newsom and Channon Christian) by 4 black racists in Knoxville KY.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that there are 30,000 cases of white women raped by black men EACH YEAR in the U.S. today. 8,000 of these are gang rapes of white women by black men. The reverse is nearly nonexistent. But the Urban League has the GALL to imply that it is BLACK women abused by WHITES!!! The fact is, black women who are abused or raped are almost EXCLUSIVELY the victims of black males.</p>
<p>This is an example of why the Urban League (which receives tax-dollars as well as United Way dollars and huge corporate contributions, is a BLACK RACIST HATE ORGANIZATION.<br>

			<p>It must be depressing to be a Black women . With so many of your men in prison or without a college degree, it is no wonder that  a growing number of them are deciding to marry White and other non-Black men.</p>

			<p>The major complaints brought up in this article are absurd. Don Imus&rsquo; comment, however poor his taste was, would not be a tramatic even for anyone with half an ounce of self-esteem. The black woman raped by whites in West Virgina was national news for one simple reason: it almost never happens (unless the perp happens to be black, which is another story). If that is Mr. Crary&rsquo;s criteria for black women having it bad, any suicide by a white woman is justifiable. Finally, the sub-prime morgage crisis: give me a break already! No one can believe that massive forclosures on people who couldn&rsquo;t afford to take out loans weren&rsquo;t the result of the borrowing party&rsquo;s inability to pay back the loan and have above a room temperature IQ. From reading this article, it seems that black women have it pretty good in the United States.  </p>

<p>  I agree with much of what you said. I too believe the major problem in America is the culture. We didn&rsquo;t have this kind of family breakdown 30, 40, and 50 years ago. The culprit is the welfare state that corrupts all it touches. The way to correct the culture is to remove the welfare state and return to the idea of personal responsibility. It took 40 years to get into this mess,it&rsquo;ll take some time to get out of it. Of course when Social Security bankrupts the welfare state will collapse and it will be ugly. </p>
<p>  I disagree with your statements about Christianity, but see your point. Oh and for the record I am a white guy.</p>

			<p>I agree that liberalism is a religion and that religion is based on blind faith, so always leads to ignorant mistakes and  irrational thought.</p>
<p>Unfortunately a lot of people become unraveled and feral if they lose their religion, so it&rsquo;s like Scylla and Charybdis.  Also, it&rsquo;s not a very good time to be infighting, given we&rsquo;re slated to go virtually extinct in 90 years&hellip;</p>
<p>Glad you like the website, I&rsquo;ll say again that we could not have a better spokesman than Jared Taylor.  He&rsquo;s our finest.</p>

<p>White guilt perpetuates the problem and this article is a call for more social welfare programs to keep the race hustlers in their positions of power&hellip;.that&rsquo;s all.</p>

			<p>Because many Black women have children and no husband, they have economic problems.  Some have children when they are in school, and cannot complete their education.  Whose fault is that?  Lacking expertise, if they get a job, it is often lower paying.  Whose fault is that?  If they sought to purchase a home, with low earning power, they might have had to pay more  for the loan.  Whose fault is that?  And if they defaulted, and the bank foreclosed, whose fault is that?  Indeed, if the government did not pay them so much in welfare when they first became pregnant, their choices in life might have been different.<br>
   The problems are not caused by whites or people of any other color.  The problems are caused by the consequences of their own choices.  Perhaps the best solution would be to abolish much of the welfare policies.  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -HM</p>

			<p>At least in the summary presented here, the plight of black women is set in terms of how they are victims, esp. of white racism.  Nothing in here about IQ, or J. Phillipe Rushton&rsquo;s r-K life history spectrum.  Also, fancy that you have to purchase the entire report from the Urban League.</p>

			<p>They are merely repeating the pattern of their African roots.  they are shucking off the Christian slave religion and culture forced on them by Europeans, and returning to what is most natural for them, a way of life that natural selection has inclined them to for thousands of years.</p>
<p>In sub-Saharan Africa, women do the work.  The men hang out, get drunk, argue and party and the women get pregnant, birth and take care of the kids.  Something like 75-85% of all farming is done by African women. The men hang out, servicing their &#8220;wives&#8221;, and the women raise the kids.</p>
<p>So what we are seeing is merely the traditional African pattern asserting itself in the USA now that white folks no longer judge blacks as being backward and ignorant.  A hundred years ago, white folks were frank about a black man&rsquo;s sex drive and shiftlessness and judged him for it.  In the last 50 years white folks were chastised for their stereotypical belief and stopped noticing. Black folks have now reverted.</p>
<p>I would ask black women why they consider it a burden that their men are shiftless and unmotivated.<br>
 <br>
&#8220;Motivation&#8221; is a Western characteristic, after all.  </p>
<p>Why should African women living in America hold their men to a white standard when African men in Africa are not held to the same standard? </p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t they just accept shiftlessness and lack of drive and determination and a desire to be a &#8220;Pookie&#8221; or a &#8220;corner man&#8221; as just the most natural way for black men to live? </p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t they just go with the flow instead of riding their men?</p>

			<p>I am so sick of their incessant whining.My husband works non stop,we have had credit problems[married young]and have been slowly but surely paying off our debt.We couldnt even get one of these loans if we tried.I saw a hispanic &#8220;victim&#8221; of forclosure on t.v. she spoke very little English and made $10.00 an hour,what in tarnation made her think that she deserved a $200,000 home?My husband makes about $90,000 a year,we got what we could afford.It seems to me a lot of minorities want things handed to them on a silver platter.My husband was turned down for a job 12 years ago because the company wasnt allowed to hire another white man until they &#8220;evened the playing field&#8221;.It seems to me the worst thing one can be anymore is a white man.I think it would behoove everyone to remember that without white men there would be no society for these ignorant people to complain about</p>

			<p>The solution to the problem stated here is pretty simple: the greatest threat to black women is�� black men</p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;  <br>
I disagree, black women are crazy. Haven&rsquo;t you ever seen them whacking their children in public? Screaming at some baby simply for crying? Causing awkward scenes by committing blatant child abuse in a grocery store or other public location? Even if they weren&rsquo;t physically unappealing, I couldn&rsquo;t imagine how a normal guy could ever tolerate to being with a black woman.</p>
<p>I am not saying black men would definitely stick around if black women were a little more pleasant, but I don&rsquo;t think black women are helping their own cause too much.</p>

			<p>Believe it or not, there are black folk who pay no mind to these reports.  We don&rsquo;t think of ourselves as victims. </p>
<p>My 85 year old grandfather tells some blood-boiling stories about his life under institutionalized racism.  We are so thankful for the sacrifices he made, and feel we owe him the debt to live honorably.</p>

			<p>Some White nationalists seem to believe that the Sisters sit around blaming White folks for their problems.  While I am sure that some Sisters bash White folks, the overwhelming majority of Sisters who blame others for their problems blame Black men (for the &#8220;down low&#8221; lifestyle, unemployment, high incarceration rates, etc.), in my experience.  I am sure that thinkers ranging from Minister Farrakhan to Jared Taylor would agree that *we Black men* need to do better by the Sisters.  The only thing that White people &#8220;owe&#8221; (if I may that loaded term) us is equality&hellip;White people don&rsquo;t owe it us to clean up our messes.</p>

			<p>Terrell, the reason that Whites live in safe neighborhoods is because Whites live in safe neighborhoods.  This is my tautological answer to your silly post.  You won&rsquo;t hear about unsafe White neighborhoods because most Whites and Japanese seek peace and quiet, whereas Blacks, in the main, make chaos for themselves and the Whites who stick around the Blacks&rsquo; ghetto-in-the-making neighborhoods&hellip;</p>

<p>So in your delusional world you think that it is WHITES who are going into black neighborhoods and raping, robbing, assaulting, and killing, making them hell-holes?<br>
And it is WHITES who are causing the 80% black illegitimacy rate, black males abandoning their offspring, and sky-high teen pregnancies that are at the root of almost all black community problems?<br>
And it is WHITES who cause blacks not to study, work, make something of themselves, save instead of spend, and cause all the rest of rampant black behavioral pathologies?<br>
And I suppose the &#8220;discrimination&#8221; you are referring to are all the blacks-only scholarships, blacks-only organizations, University admissions that allow blacks to automatically be admitted with SAT and ACT scores that automatically disqualify white and Asian applicants, black-only internships, job preferences for blacks, promotion preferences for blacks, &#8220;test-norming&#8221; that allow blacks public jobs with lower scores than whites and Asians, preferences for black-owned firms that allow them to get lucrative contracts even with much higher bids than white-owned firms, &hellip;. we could go on and on covering the BLACK SKIN PRIVILEGE in all spheres of life in this country. Is this the &#8220;discrimination&#8221; you are referring to?<br>
A black person who is a failure is NEVER a failure BECAUSE he is black, but rather DESPITE his being black. It is other blacks who are the REAL oppressors of other blacks. As much as you&rsquo;d like to make the white boogeyman your racial scapegoat in the identical manner that Nazis did with the Jews. That crutch is easier than facing you OWN responsibility for your OWN condition.<br>
And just for your information, there are plenty of whites are not &ldquo;prosperous&rdquo; nor have access to &ldquo;good health care&rdquo;. And there are many whites who live near large populations of blacks and therefore do not live in &ldquo;safe neighborhoods&rdquo;, thanks to the over ONE MILLION black on white acts of criminal violence each year in this country, TWELVE TIMES the reverse, including the rape of 30,000 white women by black males EACH YEAR, while the reverse is statistically almost non-existent.<br>

<p>Equality is not something thats doled out like government checks at the welfare office.  It comes from within.  People work to make themselves the equal of others.  Even recent immigrants who come here, including Africans and Carribbeans, are doing better than American born blacks.  Why?  The problem is blacks just want to whine and cry racism to cover the fact they don&rsquo;t even try to better themselves.  There&rsquo;s exceptions but most of you don&rsquo;t value your wives, children, appearance, an education, working, etc.  This is what&rsquo;s wrong with the black community and it has nothing to with equality.  You want everything handed to you because you have an inferiority complex and you want Whites do something about it.  Maybe you might not understand but you can&rsquo;t ask somebody else to build your self-esteem for you.  </p>
<p>There is no one more inferior than someone who demands equality!    </p>

<p>How many times does it need to be stated that the problem cannot be solved, as they are born that way?</p>

			<p>Minnesota Black, what does it take to give you &#8220;equality&#8221;?  We&rsquo;re living in a society where Blacks are treated more equal than Whites.  You can get a job offer over a White even if your unqualified.  There are government set asides based on color.  You can do poorly on the ACT and still get into college.  You can get a minority scholarship and federal funding that Whites don&rsquo;t qualify for.  The subprime mess is proof you can have bad credit and low income and still qualify to buy a house you can&rsquo;t afford.  Standards have been lowered across the board for you in every segment of society and your talking about equality?  </p>

			<p>10:07&hellip;I think that you misunderstood what I meant by &#8220;equality&#8221;. You have apparently assumed that I meant that Whites owe it to us to make us equal to them in terms of material success (i.e, that Whites have a duty to place us on the same economic footing that they enjoy).  Just to clarify, what I meant was that all Whites owe us is to respect the fact that we are *equal under the law*, not that Whites owe us wealth.  Most Whites apparently respect that Asians, Hispanics, etc. are equal under the law (even though they did less than we did to help build and defend the country)&hellip;I feel that we deserve the same.  However, I do not feel that Whites have a duty to put money in our pockets.  You probably don&rsquo;t know this, but many Black parents (Black moms, anyway) teach their kids that they have to work twice as hard as a White person to get half as far&hellip;that&rsquo;s how my mother raised me and I am very glad that she did so.</p>

			<p>The PROBLEM is that equal opportunity does not mean equal outcome. But when this invariably happens the knee-jerk reaction is to cry &#8220;racism&#8221;, rather then to look to cultural and social pathologies and genetic differences.</p>

			<p>I was glad to hear some black points of view on this site. </p>
<p>Not that I agree with many of them, but the dialog approach is much more real than the monologuing. It is far easier to believe that your perception is truth when most everybody hops on the bandwagon because no opposing points of view from the very people we are railing against are presented. </p>
<p>When you feed the monoglogging this breeds paranoia. Now, if I didn&rsquo;t think there wasn&rsquo;t a real risk from crime in this country, I wouldn&rsquo;t be packing, but some of this stuff is becoming over the top.</p>

<p>Black Americans are citizens protected under the U.S constitution and therefore have equal protection under the law&hellip;.but during the 60&rsquo;s they have been brainwashed by the marxists to claim special &#8216;victim&rsquo; status because of past wrongs which led them to be relegated to minority and unequal status of slavery under a new formula.</p>

<p>I believe that if everyone were truly &#8220;equal&#8221; and ability trumped race, your people would be alot further down on the ladder than you are.  We made you &#8220;equal&#8221; by lowering our standards and looking the other way and you think that deserves respect?    </p>
