						<p>By now the idea is spreading all over the place that there is no movie Fitna, and never will be &mdash; that Geert Wilders simply announced that there would be to expose Islamic intolerance.</p>
<p>I have no direct knowledge either way, but I&rsquo;m inclined to credit this idea at this point, since the film has not appeared now on several dates on which it had been announced to appear. Maybe it will finally burst upon the world, but I won&rsquo;t be surprised if it never does.</p>
<p>And look what we have seen: for the mere announcement that he was making a film quoting the Qur&rsquo;an and showing Muslims acting violently in accord with its words, we have seen threats from several Muslim countries, threats from Al-Qaeda, demonstrations in the Netherlands and around the world, and quailing dhimmitude from the august leaders of Europe, as they cringed before the anticipated Islamic wrath, and from Network Solutions, as they pulled Wilders&rsquo;s site while it was almost entirely devoid of content.</p>
<p>Note, meanwhile, that hardly a day goes by on which some Muslims somewhere do not commit an act of violence that they deem to be justified by the words of the Qur&rsquo;an. Jihadist leaders routinely invoke Qur&rsquo;anic passages to explain their actions and make recruits among peaceful Muslims. In other words, we see the announced theme of Wilders&rsquo;s Fitna played out every day, not by non-Muslims but by Muslims &mdash; and there is nary a peep of protest from anyone. Muslims in the West issue vague denunciations of &#8220;terrorism,&#8221; but never specifically explain whom they actually believe to be a terrorist, and there are no protests, no threats, no nothing against those who have supposedly &#8220;hijacked&#8221; their religion.</p>
<p>Maybe that was Wilders&rsquo;s point all along, and it is a point well made, made again and again and again.<br>

						</div>
										<p>
						<i> 
								Kafir Alalazoo, Jawa Report, March 24, 2008
							</i></font>
						</p>
										<p>
						<p>I just spent 30-40 minutes on the phone with Network Solutions (based in PA), complaining about their removal of the fitnathemovie.com website.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I was only able to get as high as a woman named Shannon, the Assistant to the Executive Officer (his name is Roy Dunbar), who gave me a polite brush off, without actually answering any of my questions.</p>
<p>But I was making her very uncomfortable .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I could actually hear her blanching over the phone!</p>
<p>I explained why I was contacting her (she was already aware of Fitna), and when I was done explaining my gripe (forcefully), she asked me if I had any specific questions for her.</p>
<p>So I asked her some specific questions, and informed her they were for an article I was writing for a popular conservative blog .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. where upon her voice became even gloomier:</p>
<p>1. "Why did you remove a website for TOS violations when there was nothing but a parking page with the text "Coming Soon", and a photo of the Quran?"</p>
<p>She directed my attention to the notice on the page, saying "It is what it is."</p>
<p>2. "Why is an American based company willing to practice preemptive censorship, when there has not yet been any violation?"</p>
<p>Again, she had no answer.</p>
<p>3. "Is it Network Solutions&rsquo; common practice to remove websites on the day prior to their launch, after months of work have gone into promoting those websites?"</p>
<p>She said she was not aware of such a practice, but she could forward my question upward.</p>
<p>4. I informed her I was in the process of building a new, massive website (true), and that I had planned to host with Network Solutions prior to this debacle (not true).</p>
<p>I asked her why American companies should give Network Solutions their business, when her company has demonstrated their willingness to ruin their customers&rsquo; livelihoods for the sake of political correctness, and their own bottom line?</p>
<p>She just sort of sputtered, told me she understood my point, and assured me she&rsquo;d look into it.</p>
<p>5. I asked her why an American based hosting company is more concerned about disgruntled Muslims than protecting free speech on the Internet?</p>
<p>Dead silence.</p>
<p>6. I asked her for contact information for her boss, Roy Dunbar (CEO of Network Solutions), as she was unable to provide me with answers to my questions, and she declined, stating she could not allow every complaint to go directly to him, because he was a busy man.</p>
<p>I informed her I too am a busy man, and that I had just wasted more than a half hour of my time, being shuffled from person to person, trying to get answers she was ultimately unwilling or unable to provide.</p>
<p>I informed her I knew she was not personally responsible for this debacle (I had been pretty tough on her), and I apologized for what I was going to have to do.</p>
<p>I explained that, unlike radical Muslims, law abiding citizens did not have the option of issuing threats or becoming violent, thus our only recourse is to become such a pain in the ass that companies such as Network Solutions find offending Muslims preferable to the time and resources wasted dealing with us.</p>
<p>I told her I would be posting the gist of our conversation online, at a popular site, and that she was in for a bad week. I really hope I&rsquo;m right.</p>

<p>Give &rsquo;em hell Jawas!</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let yourselves be brushed off by the first few people you talk to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and don&rsquo;t waste a lot of your time talking to them. They are low level functionaries, and you are better off wasting the time of someone at a higher pay scale.</p>
<p>Just keep asking to speak with someone in the corporate offices until you are connected. Be polite, but firm.<br>

					<p>I contacted Network Solutions last evening by e-mail and told them if that if they did not rescind their censorship of the Dutch Filmaker, I would not be renewing with them my multiple website hosting accounts and my domain name registration. I told them their actions were cowardly and fascist, and said that I would be advising my business associates and friends of my decision not to continue engaging their services.<br>

					<p>No, absolutely not.  No criticism of the Jidaist should be allowed.</p>
<p>However, on another front Hollywood has decided to make a movie of Jesus as a homosexual, which nobody from the radical left seems to disagree with.  And they will even applaud the makers of the film for their &#8220;genius,&#8221; and will squeal their delight after viewing it.</p>
<p>But to reveal non-Christian injustice and crime is blasphemous and they won&rsquo;t tolerate it for one moment.</p>
<p>Has anybody reached the conclusion, like me, that this country isn&rsquo;t worth saving?</p>

					<p>Why does the American left favor violent middle-eastern savagery? Because  the left shares its main goal: destroy Western Civilization. </p>

					<p>If 9/11 didn&rsquo;t convince all the people once and for all that this is a violent ideology, then nothing will. It&rsquo;s obvious that there is no hope for a moderate, non-violent version and the only solution is to send them all back to where they came from.</p>

					<p>The conduct of Arab muslims towards 3rd world persons in their own country, especially Kuwait and Saudi should be secretly filmed and publicized. Some people may be disgusted, but oil is the determining factor in who we kiss and at the moment is is Arab Muslims. </p>

<p>I believe that Special Forces calls this a &#8220;force multiplier.&#8221; Look at all the other people Wilders has had to engage in fighting against/defending against his idea. For only $9.95 for a couple of months, you can tick off the entire Muslim world! And for only the cost of a generic &#8220;Coming Soon!&#8221; page!</p>

					<p>&#8220;Has anybody reached the conclusion, like me, that this country isn&rsquo;t worth saving?&#8221;</p>
<p>  No Ranger, I have not reached that conclusion.  The conclusion I have reached is that this fine nation is under a massive assault, from elements both within &amp; without; and that she &amp; her ideals, in particular the importance of freedom, are in dire need of a most vigorous defense.  </p>
<p>By the way, I also happen to believe that a good offense is often a good defense. Most important here than mere violence (though enemies committed to violence against us must be dealt with realistically), is the vastly more far-reaching effect of the vigorous promotion of true American ideals, such as individual liberty (a right, not a privilege!), and equality under the law. </p>
<p>These American ideals, so despised by the left that they actually cooperate with islamic fundamentalists who despise &amp; destroy everything the left holds dear whenever they get the chance (how many brassiere-burning feminist, drug-sucking, earth-worshipping, no war for any reason at any time, free-&#8220;love&#8221; communes have Hollywood hippie-types established in Saudi Arabia?) just because they believe that anything that hurts the society that has coddled them all along is a good thing (or, because they are incredibly stupid, &amp; way out of touch with reality)- these ideals must be not only defended, but vigorously promoted!</p>
<p>Those enemies of the greatest champion of freedom the world has ever known have only enjoyed success to the extent that people in our society have remained ignorant (this seems to be partly laziness, but just as much by diabolical design!) of <br>
of the ideals that made this, in the blink of a historical eye, the most successful nation in history, by any measure. </p>
<p>In fact, we have dramatically raised the level of possible expectations (which is the main reason no totalitarian regime can tolerate our existence), by creating prosperity and power beyond the dreams of any prior generation of mankind, so that even our poor can be fed to the point of obesity, they can control the temperature of their houses (and they have houses!), drive cars (yes, our &#8220;poor&#8221; have cars, too!) under nights which have had the light brought into them, have life extended many times by a level of medical understanding &amp; capability that has already not only made many life-threatening diseases into curable or manageable problems but has even completely eradicated some diseases from the pantheon of human sufferings; we can even fly. </p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the tip of the iceberg!</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have shared a great deal of these blessings with millions of others around the world.  </p>
<p>My father counted this nation worthy of the risk of his life (and he did lose a lot of blood for her!) and a blessing to it for every day that he lived in it (yes, born American- but during 1944-45, he was in Europe).  So do I.  </p>
<p>It is the garbage heaped upon this great nation and its very fine people that is not worth defending.  It is that which needs to be shown for what it is, and sent out with the rest of the garbage.  </p>
<p>The cowardice of Network Solutions in this case does not uphold American ideals. Neither does the failure of anyone who does not stand up for American freedom in any &amp; every case that it is threatened. </p>
<p>I need not ask god for any further blessing, for I was born American.  Knowing what that means: the sweetness of freedom-  I will most certainly fight for this country and her ideals in every possible way with not only my dying breath, but every breath in between. </p>

					<p>Ranger says &#8220;that this country isn&rsquo;t worth saving?&#8221;<br>
Too bad you feel that way, Ranger. There is hope you know. All it takes is 20 individuals in every state who commit to write at least 1 letter, or make at least 1 phone call each week to protest the stuff that&rsquo;s happening. If you want to stop creeping jihadism and the PC madness, you have to write and call.<br><br>

					<p>I actually wanted to see the movie. I hope someone else takes up the task and makes one. Islam is fascist, just as Wilders charges. And since no one reads anymore, film is the only way to get people to notice. Please, someone, make the movie.</p>

					<p>Man did this movie come out at the right time, cuz I was worried about that story that Jesus was a  black palestinian, and if White people can fall for that and that obama thing, God help us. When will they make a documentary about radical black churches?</p>

					<p>Geet Wilders accomplished two very important things with this demonstration-the announcement of a movie critical of Islam which may not even exist, since no one has seen it: 1) He has shown that at the first hint of critisism, Muslims around the world, but most importantly, in Europe, will threaten violence, and even commit it. That the film has not been seen is unimportant. 2) He has shown the disgusting, cowardly, quailing dhimmnitude of European leaders and the press.<br>
That he has done it in this manner shows a streak of brilliance. That a US company self censored a blank website out of fear of Muslims does not make North Americans look much better, unfortunatly.</p>

					<p>So what is the deal with Micheal S. lately? ( I can&rsquo;t spell out his last name because it is the same as a word that isn&rsquo;t allowed on this site; hint: it is another name for a Native American that isn&rsquo;t very PC).  Anyways, Micheal S. keeps trying to convince his radio audience that Islam is a decent religion and that it is only within the past couple of centuries that extremist groups have developed in that religion.  In fact, he has arabic scholars on his show all the time, trying to defend their religion and of course showing their own bias.  He had one guy on recently who made a claim that it was because of colonialism that Muslim extremism has developed.  Micheal S.  didn&rsquo;t even come back with an argument against his statement; instead he said that he agreed with basically everything the guy was saying.</p>
<p>I thought Micheal S. was one of us.  Lately, however, I haven&rsquo;t been listening to his show.  He has proven to be a hypocrite over and over.  On some nights he sounds like Jared Taylor and then on other nights he sounds almost similar to Micheal Moore and other prominent people who hate whites.  I hope he loses a lot of listeners until he realizes that he is our greatest hope on Talk Radio and that he best get his act together and stop with this PC propaganda. </p>

					<p>Courtney:</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">CAIR </span>has successfully convinced some of Michael <span class="caps">S.&rsquo;</span>s advertisers to quit his show because he dares criticize radical Islam every once in awhile.  I agree with you   &mdash;   in reaction, he&rsquo;s pandering a little too much.</p>
