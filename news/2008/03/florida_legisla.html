						<p>The Florida Legislature formally apologized Wednesday for its long support of slavery in a resolution calling for reconciliation.</p>
<p>Senators approved the resolution at their morning session after hearing some of the history detailing the savage treatment endured by slaves in the 19th century and the reluctance of politicians in the last century to recognize the intolerance and mistreatment of blacks. The House passed the resolution later in the day.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is important that the Legislature express profound regret for the shameful chapter in this state&rsquo;s history,&#8221; the resolution reads.</p>
<p>Legislators in Alabama, Maryland, North Carolina and Virginia have recently issued formal apologies for slavery, and New Jersey became the first northern state to apologize in January.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>That included Florida Gov. Gen. Richard Keith Call. In a portion of an 1861 letter that was read on the Senate floor Wednesday, Call described a black man as &#8220;an animal in the form of a man, possessing the greatest physical power, and the greatest capacity for labor and endurance .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a wild barbarian, to be tamed and civilized by the discipline of slavery.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the 1850s, at a time when Florida&rsquo;s population was around 111,000, 44 percent of the population were slaves. After the Civil War, Florida&rsquo;s Constitution of 1868 guaranteed blacks the right to vote and abolished slavery in the state, but inequities remained.</p>

					<p>     This came as a surprise because none of us in Florida knew these idiots were contemplating this moronic move. They did it in secrecy. Not even the liberal rag that passes itself off as a newspaper around these parts knew this was coming. Oh well, I guess the Republicans figure that if they kiss some behinds they&rsquo;ll get a few more votes come November. From the looks of things, they&rsquo;ll need all the votes they can get after what they did ( or failed to do ) during the past seven years. They&rsquo;ll be lucky if they can elect a few local dog catchers come November.</p>

					<p> Cry us a river, Arthenia! The suggestion that blacks couldn&rsquo;t attend movie theaters under segregation is laughable. They were simply made to sit in separate sections. It was the same in my hometown, on the very edge of the south. Blacks sat in the balcony   &mdash;   not by any law, but perhaps by custom or an unspoken understanding among the races. Actually, you could see the movie a little better from up there, and the sound was just as good.</p>
<p> The suggestion that all blacks want from these copious, tear-stained &#8220;apologies&#8221; by various state legislatures is &#8220;reconciliation&#8221; wouldn&rsquo;t fool a complete moron. They want <span class="caps">REPARATIONS, </span>all you naive White folks out there! They want to stick their thieving hands into your pockets even deeper than they already have! If you can&rsquo;t see that coming, you couldn&rsquo;t see the Queen Mary on a clear day!</p>

					<p>Only an imbecile who had harmed no one would issue an apology to someone who was never harmed.</p>
<p>I just wrote several members of the House and Senate telling them they should clarify that it should be noted by them that their idiotic apology is not as representaives of the people, but involves strictly themselves, and I asked that they request an apology from black leadership for all the whites that have been affected by black crime for the last several years.</p>
<p>And I requested that they contact black preachers who espouse white hatred, which encourages black on white crime, and demand an apology from them.</p>
<p>This whole affair is worse than disgusting, especially in light of the fact that such an inane resolution will only encourage these black primitives to whine even more and behave even worse.</p>
<p>This body of out-of-touch retards has just made an even more hostile environment for whites. I couldn&rsquo;t possibly feel more disgust for them than I do right now.</p>

&ldquo;&lsquo;an animal in the form of a man, possessing the greatest physical power, and the greatest capacity for labor and endurance &hellip; a wild barbarian, to be tamed and civilized by the discipline of slavery.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t that letter written by the great great grad dad of Billy Mays who was just hyping the slave he was selling?</p>
<p>I thought we decided to drop this apology / reparations scam.  Since we all agreed that America had nothing to do with turning African blacks into slaves.  Africa blacks were slave long before they got to America.  The ones who did get to America were the lucky ones.  Those that went elsewhere had it really rough, and those who stayed in Africa as the slaves of the African tribes were tortured to death and then eaten for supper.  <br>

					<p>American&rsquo;s must not allow state governments to grant apologies for slavery particularly to open a door for reperations.<br>
To do so amounts to treason to both America and the white gene which endowed mankind with our glorious Constitution.<br><br>
America&rsquo;s international Socialist policies are leading the country toward a darker complexion of corruption and nonwhite street crime.<br><br>
The American citizenry must realize that Black American&rsquo;s are on a set course of their own which began when African&rsquo;s came into contact with Whites and their subsequent life of freedom under America&rsquo;s Constitution.<br><br>
An educated people will not be subjugated.<br><br>
Know your Constitution.</p>

					<p>Will the Bolshevik and Bushevik Florida legislature also make a statement about the tremendous black on white crime in the state?  Will it demand civil rights for all and not just black racist and murdering hordes?  Let&rsquo;s hope so.  Be activist and stand up for your family because white genocidal sell-out Bolsheviks and Busheviks will not.</p>

					<p>&#8220;&hellip;the reluctance of politicians in the last century to recognize the intolerance and mistreatment of blacks. &#8220;</p>
<p>Instead on harping on something from the <span class="caps">DEAD PAST </span>that concerns NO <span class="caps">ONE LIVING TODAY, </span>how about a resolution regarding something actually <span class="caps">RELEVANT, </span>that is, dealing with Floridians <span class="caps">TODAY</span>: Like a resolution recognizing the &#8220;intolerance and mistreatment BY blacks. The <span class="caps">RAMPANT </span>one sided black violence against non-blacks that is part of daily life. Oh things like: <br>
In December 2007 in Lake Wales <span class="caps">FL, </span>near Orlando: A black male by the name of Leon Davis (30) kidnapped two Hispanic females at random, Juanita Luciano (23) and Ivonne Bustamante (26 and pregnant), locked them in a room, doused them down with a flammable liquid <span class="caps">AND BURNED THEM ALIVE</span>!!! This black male, Leon Davis, has been responsible for a <span class="caps">LONG STRING </span>of attacks and robberies upon Hispanics in the area. A week earlier he murdered two Asian Indian Hindus in Lake Alfred <span class="caps">FL.</span><br><br>
The Tampa riots where blacks attacked and burned Asian businesses. <br><br>
The Liberty City riots in which a number of white motorists were drug out of their cars by blacks and were mutilated and murdered in the most horrific fashion: One white motorist was killed by being impaled with a broken broom stick run up through his rectum.</p>

					<p>As a native Floridian, I can now rest easy and not fear the rampant black street crime that occurs because of slavery.  Oh what&rsquo;s that, slavery has been abolished for more than 140 years?  </p>
<p>Some quotes: &#8220;Joseph Gibbons, a Democrat, says the incarceration rate of blacks is a vestige of slavery&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;When you don&rsquo;t have opportunities, you turn to other things&hellip;. you get frustrated and don&rsquo;t want to participate in the system.&#8221;</p>
<p>I believe he means society, not &#8220;the system.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just this past week a program was started that would pay, in full, for a college education to any free-lunch receiving student who can graduate from high school.  And yet, it isn&rsquo;t enough, it will never be enough.  </p>

					<p>I will be happy to apologize to any current slave that comes forth. Since I wasn&rsquo;t around during slavery, nor was he/she, then I need proof that you need an apolo&hellip;excuse me, restitution to make you feel better. I have never once hunted down people who posted signs that said &#8220;No dogs or Irish allowed.&#8221; That happened long ago and I&rsquo;m sure my Irish great-grandparents didn&rsquo;t demand money. They started a business and made it on their own. And, by the way, I&rsquo;ve also referred to myself as an <span class="caps">AMERICAN </span>- not a hyphenated name recalling a place I&rsquo;ve never been. Anyone who goes by these hyphenated names can&rsquo;t really consider themselves a true American.</p>

					<p>I read somewhere that a couple of blacks in the legislature were actually crying when this was all taking place. The only people who should be crying are the people of Florida who put these fools into office. As for blacks, stop leaning on your ancestors&rsquo; graves. This constant whining and crying for apologies isn&rsquo;t going to get you anywhere. </p>

					<p>Also in the news:</p>
<p>The Florida State Legislature has voted that pi equals 3 and has repealed the Second Law of Thermodynamics.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Second Law of Thermodynamics was a racist, sexist law,&#8221; Florida Governor Keith Call said to reporters.  &#8220;It prevented anyone, especially women and persons of color from generating as much power as they wanted, at will, for free.  I am proud to have signed its repeal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Next on the Florida Legislature&rsquo;s agenda are the irrational natural log constant &#8220;e&#8221; and the imaginary number &#8220;i&#8221;.  &#8220;These numbers were created by white males for the express purpose of making mathematics difficult enough to ensure their continued monopoly of the sciences,&#8221; commented one legislator.  &#8220;We can simply vote that &#8220;e&#8221; equals 2, but &#8220;i&#8221; will be somewhat problematical.&#8221;</p>
