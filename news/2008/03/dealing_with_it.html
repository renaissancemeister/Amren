						<p>Obama says we should talk about race. He thinks that will help him. It won&rsquo;t. Most of us have spent a lifetime absorbing the lesson that seeing what we see automatically makes us racist. Do you want to talk about it? Do you? Really?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve come to accept a lot of things, in fact. Although no one alive in America has ever owned a slave, we accept that we are all somehow guilty for slavery in the American past. We accept that in our lifetimes racial discrimination has become a routine official practice against those of us whose remote ancestors were not slaves. We accept that there are doctors and lawyers and police officers and firefighters whose credentials may not be completely up to snuff because of the top-secret compromises associated with affirmative action. We accept the popular &mdash; and tiresomely repeated stereotypes &mdash; that black people are more gifted at sports and dancing and music and sexuality, although there is no other arena in which it is fair to say that white or yellow people are better than black people. We accept the premise that there exists some kind of super black woman who is a naturally better mother, matriarch, empirical philosopher, and leader of men than 5,000 years of civilization has produced in other cultures through education, discipline, and morality. We accept that any fear we feel of young black men on the sidewalk is more a reflection of our own prejudice than the cold statistics of crime. We accept that it&rsquo;s improper for us to object to obscene rap recordings, thug sports stars, flagrantly corrupt politicians, and hypocritical clergy if any of these happen to be black people. We accept that the first major inroads against the hallowed First Amendment began with a political correctness about matters of race that have since ballooned to a distortion of all human interactions. We accept that everything we disapprove of in black behavior is derived from our own lack of understanding about what they&rsquo;ve been through.</p>
<p>But Obama has invited us to talk about race.</p>
<p>Okay. I&rsquo;m accepting the invitation. He can regret it at his leisure.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t hate black people. I can&rsquo;t pretend to be color-blind because absolutely nothing in my culture will allow me to be. I admire Thomas Sowell, Duke Ellington, Roberto Clemente, Muhammed Ali, Alexandre Dumas, Sidney Poitier, Denzel Washington, Count Basie, Tiger Woods, and Bill Cosby. There are many others but that&rsquo;s a sampling of the famous folks whose courage, genius, character, and achievements I would be proud if I could get anywhere in the vicinity of. The bald truth of the matter is that they&rsquo;re better than I am, and it doesn&rsquo;t arouse a flicker of racial feeling in me to acknowledge it. They have enriched and elevated my own experience of life.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I am sick to death of black people as a group. The truth. That is part of the conversation Obama is asking for, isn&rsquo;t it? I live in an eastern state almost exactly on the fabled Mason-Dixon line. Every day I see young black males wearing tee shirts down to their knees &mdash; and jeans belted just above their knees. I&rsquo;m an old guy. I want to smack them. All of them. They are egregious stereotypes. It&rsquo;s impossible not to think the unthinkable N-Word when they roll up beside you at a stoplight in their trashed old Hondas with 19-inch spinner wheels and rap recordings that shake the foundations of the buildings. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>We can have this conversation now &mdash; should have this conversation now &mdash; because African-Americans are on the verge of the greatest setback they&rsquo;ve experienced since the election of Rutherford B. Hayes. You see, you&rsquo;ve just given life to the suspicion that black people in America are, and have long been, a fifth column &mdash; unanimously hating the very country that has afforded the highest standard of living ever achieved by black people in human history. We&rsquo;re teetering at the edge of believing that you&rsquo;re a secret society, a massive collection of sleeper cells just waiting for your chance to do serious harm to the rest of us. You&rsquo;ve made it possible for us to believe that. Because you&rsquo;re never outraged by what the worst black people do. Because you continue to make excuses for what should be inexcusable to everyone.</p>
<p>The path to equality is counter-intuitive. Admit and decry the failings of your community. Concede that a generation of single mothers has been a disaster. Let go of the fantasy that black mothers are some kind of infallible force of nature. Demand that your children spend more time reading and doing sums than farting around on the basketball court. Only about two thousand people in the whole country make a living by playing sports. The rest have to get real jobs. Do whatever it takes to make your preachers emphasize the value of being a good father instead of ranting from the pulpit about how all of life&rsquo;s woes are the fault of rich old white men. Tip your white waitress. Stay at work after 5 o&rsquo;clock. Allow your kids to find somebody to admire and emulate who isn&rsquo;t black. (My two best friends in high school &mdash; white guys &mdash; fought like dogs about their conflicting candidates for best rightfielder in baseball: Clemente or Aaron.) Would it kill you if your kid fixated on Sandy Koufax, Mozart, or Shakespeare rather than Mays, Armstrong, or Jay-Z? Does being black really have to be a full-time job?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the biggest thing we &#8220;racists&#8221; notice. Every single immigrant group that ever came to America &mdash; including the Chinese who came as railroad slaves &mdash; has risen out of poverty and want to prosperity and respect. The Irish, the Italians, the Polish, the Jews, the Koreans, the Vietnamese. Every group but you. And you&rsquo;re the only group we fought a war to free.</p>
<p>Sorry to break it to you, but Obama won&rsquo;t be elected president. We were ready, but you clearly aren&rsquo;t. Time to think about getting ready.</p>

					<p>An excellent article.</p>
<p>Blacks, as a culture, use the color of their skin as a shield against everything considered positive in civilized cultures, whether it be education, integrity, personal responsibility or just plain human decency.  Instead they use race as a excuse for their pathologies, such as crime, promiscuity, hatefulness, vulgarity and immorality.</p>
<p><br>
Like the Old Guy, I too, am sick of them as a group.  I am sick of their incessant demands and whining, and the fact they are allowed to live in our country with impunity, despite being the most overtly racist and pathological group in our country.</p>
<p>Obama can take them all and go to h@!!.</p>

					<p> This &#8220;Old Guy&#8221; speaks the truth, by golly! He&rsquo;s got it exactly right about the black punks with a built-in hatred for Whites, the so-called black &#8220;leaders&#8221; who have made a career out of encouraging such hatred, the idiot White liberals who want to idolize the likes of Barack Obama (to give just one example).</p>
<p> He&rsquo;s absolutely right about the so-called &#8220;N-word&#8221; too (odd, isn&rsquo;t it, how ever on this White Nationalist website if you use that word your post will be deleted?) The forbidden word describes a certain type of black perfectly, and it should be shouted from the housetops when and where appropriate. Then the blacks who use the word themselves to gig their fellow Africans can scream in outrage. Know what? That word wasn&rsquo;t always &#8220;verboten&#8221; on <span class="caps">TV.</span> As recently as 1975, in the first season of Saturday Night Live, it was used for comic effect in a sketch, provoking only laughter from the audience. Now, the reaction would be a gasp, and utterings of shock.</p>
<p> This is another example of an essay that speaks the truth, baldly and without apology. For that reason, it will never receive any dissemination through the mainstream news media, who still are convinced that Obama is going to win the presidency. Poor, deluded <span class="caps">MSM</span>!<br>

					<p>This man makes a little sense, but clearly says some absurd things. He say that he respects Muhammad Ali. Ali hated Whites and called Whites &#8220;blue-eyed devils&#8221;. I have blue eyes. Am I a devil? No, I am a White Nationalist and do not have to claim that I like some blacks to justify my racialist thinking.</p>

					<p>Damn, Old Guy. Well said.</p>
<p>What gets me most is this:</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say I was running for president. Let&rsquo;s say I spoke openly about my beloved pastor, called him my spiritual mentor, wrote glowing praise of him in a book I titled after one of his sermons, and wrote about how great an influence he&rsquo;s been on my life as a whole.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s suppose that pastor turned out to be Fred Phelps. At that point, I think it would be well within the boundaries of reason for every homosexual in America to perk up their ears and say &#8220;Oh&hellip;my&hellip;<i>gawd!!</i> Dothe he really follow thith guy who thinkth that all gay people need to be ecthecuted?! What&rsquo;th he gonna do to uth if he&rsquo;th elected <i>prethident??!</i></p>
<p>Seriously though, all gay jokes put aside, it would certainly be a legitimate question on their part. Equally legitimate would be the white guy who asks the same about Obama. How will he direct his power as <span class="caps">CIC</span>? What will happen with federal law enforcement regarding crimes committed by blacks? <span class="caps">HOW HARD WILL</span> HE <span class="caps">RAPE OUR WALLETS</span>??</p>
<p>I find it hard to fathom that Obama doesn&rsquo;t hold to this raving ingrate Wright&rsquo;s entire shtick from start to end. It would be one thing if this were isolated, but take into account:</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s refusal to wear an American flag in public (trivial by itself, but after this revelation&hellip;)</p>
<p>His wife&rsquo;s comments about her lack of pride in this country (she&rsquo;s a die hard member of this church too)</p>
<p>His reference to his grandmothers fear of groups of black men as &#8220;disturbing,&#8221; after dismissing the idea that Wright&rsquo;s comments were even controversial (I&rsquo;ll bet he&rsquo;d be soiling his own shorts if left alone at night in Baltimore, or <span class="caps">DC, </span>or Chicago, or any other black city)</p>
<p>It don&rsquo;t look good.</p>

					<p>I have had the opportunity to read this &#8220;Perspective&#8221; several times, and I smile every time.  This patriot has been called a racist over and over.  I call him honest.  I find it hard to believe that any white American, and any honest African American, can read this and not agree with this man&rsquo;s words.  This is the honest dialogue that is needed in this country.  Not the rantings of a crazy man from a pulpit.  </p>

					<p>&#8220;We were ready, but you clearly aren&rsquo;t.&#8221; I disagree that we White people were/are ready in the sense that most of us do not believe that a black individual should ever be commander-in-chief of a nation created and sustained by Whites. For me, it is that simple.</p>

					<p>The sad but inescapable fact is that the presence of blacks in the United States has been and continues to be an outrageously expensive plague on this country, contributing very little at great cost.  The old guy is right but he is too kind.<br>
I cannot think of one thing that would have benefited this country more than the complete absence of blacks.  Their violence, their anti-white hatred, their constant complaining, their ignorance, their constant claims for preferential treatment, their contempt for law and other Western concepts of justice and fairness,  and the list goes on and on is reason enough to justify this statement</p>
<p>.  Any rational person weighing the good and the bad consequences of the presence of blacks in America could come to no other conclusion than that they have been and continue to be an unmitigated disaster.  Those are the facts.  They no doubt will hurt the feelings of many blacks who happen to read them but the survival of Western culture should not be sacrificed to spare the feelings of the one group which has never and will never assimilate into the mainstream of American culture.  Yet that is what we are constantly being asked to do.  It is absurd.</p>

<p>Irrationality and self-delusion at it&rsquo;s best.  Of course, you hate Black people.  I think the old Jerry Springer crowd is growing restless and want the show to revive so they can &#8220;tell it like it is.&#8221;</p>

					<p>The article was well thought out and in this day and age probably will result in his being tarred &amp; feathered and run  out of town on a rail. The best thought (to me) was his take on blacks as &#8220;a fifth column&#8221;. In effect that is exactly what we have come to believe in this last 40 years or so. My liberal mother took me with her back in the days of protests, I grew up believing in equality for all. It took a lifetime of actual experiences to understand how badly the black populace of our country has squandered what they were given (or took) in the 1960s. The names that the author mentioned are those of success stories indeed and each had/has their own skill set and intellect that brought them to the fore in an acceptable way. However even they, with the exception of Mr Cosby, have not taken the high road in condeming that &#8220;fifth column&#8221; of black notoriety, crime, culture (call it what you will), that we all  fear, distrust, abhor. I suspect that Obama, like everyone else in the public eye, wants exactly the opposite of a free and honest discourse on race in 21st century America.</p>

					<p>Old Guy is hopelessly deluded.  By refusing to accept racial differences in <span class="caps">IQ, </span>he still assumes that blacks at any moment could just start reading and studying more and become rocket scientists.    Because he still insists that there&rsquo;s an easy cure for blacks in America and integration is just around the bend, he&rsquo;s perpetuating the same doomed policies that have haunted us for centuries.  Blacks cannot integrate or assimilate because of the severe IQ gap, the answer isn&rsquo;t to lecture them on being more responsible or whatever, it&rsquo;s a complete separation of the races and a new american revolution, this time without the damnable mistake of slavery.</p>

					<p>&#8220;Obama says we should talk about race&hellip;. Do you want to talk about it? Do you? Really?&#8221;</p>
<p>Many liberals like Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, &#8220;progressive&#8221; academics, etc., all claim to want a discussion on race. Similar to their claims of commitment to free speech, <span class="caps">IT&rsquo;S ALL BOGUS</span>!  They want yet another forum to give us a lecture on the topic from their own perspective. Bill Clinton&rsquo;s &#8220;Initiative on Race&#8221; from 1997 (lead article in January 1998 edition of AR) wanted &#8220;candid dialogue&#8221;, but even though one of the meetings had been planned to take place in Fairfax, Virginia, close to <span class="caps">AR&rsquo;</span>s offices, AR couldn&rsquo;t get press credentials or even a place in the audience. When Bill Clinton announced his initiative, AR sent a letter in response to his announcement to the New York Times, New York Post, Washington Post, Washington Times, Chicago Tribune, Los Angeles Times, and the Wall Street Journal. All refused to publish the letter. How do you like that for commitment to free speech?</p>
<p>Western &#8220;free-market democracies&#8221; and the communist regimes of old share one thing in common: racial equality is state doctrine. That doctrine rests on a politically-driven lie. That is why so many liberals (and conservatives too) get hysterical about an honest, freewheeling discussion of the topic. When such a forum exists, like American Renaissance, the guardians and enforcers of orthodoxy rely on name calling, like <span class="caps">ADL </span>or Southern Poverty Law Center, or just outright thuggery like the One People&rsquo;s Project (note the collectivist ring to that name, that tells you where they&rsquo;re coming from) or the masked &#8220;anarchists&#8221; who censored Jared Taylor from speaking in Canada in early 2007.</p>
<p>I am liberal on a number of issues, but after living in a less than privileged area of Manhattan for a period in my life, I refuse to become a conformist clone on the issue of race. It&rsquo;s untenable. It is whopping hypocrisy to expect &#8220;middle American&#8221; whites to adjust to what privileged liberal whites can buy themselves above. The average &#8220;progressive&#8221; knows in their gut that they&rsquo;re wrong. When AR presents flawless facts and information, they don&rsquo;t discuss the facts or ideas, or even challenge them. They just engage in name calling. They have zero commitment to diversity of opinion. The newspapers that rejected <span class="caps">AR&rsquo;</span>s letter are proof of that. </p>
<p>&#8220;Obama says we should talk about race.&#8221;  American Renaissance has been talking about race since 1990 Mr. Obama. </p>

					<p>Black Insurgent:</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like dogs in packs. Because I know that even my valiant dachshund, in a pack, would revert to wolf-like pack behaviour.<br>
Over time, these dogs would actually produce offspring that were wilder than they. The process would accelerate.  </p>
<p>But, individually, I love my dachshund. </p>
<p>I know what he is, and he knows what he is.</p>
<p>That is why many people do not like blacks &#8220;as a group.&#8221;</p>
<p>These same comments can be applied to people in fraternities, or cheerleaders.  </p>
