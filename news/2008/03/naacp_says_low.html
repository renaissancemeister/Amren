						<p>The Florida branch of the NAACP says a bill that would ban students from wearing their pants too low could lead to more legal trouble for black males.</p>
<p>Orlando Senator Gary Siplin&rsquo;s bill was approved 28-11 last week by the Florida Senate.</p>
<p>The bill calls for no criminal sanctions, but it would prohibit students from wearing pants low so that they expose undergarments.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>NAACP President Adora Obi Nweze called it a &#8220;clearly discriminatory bill.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>

					<p>Other &#8220;clearly discriminatory&#8221; laws that disproportionately affect black males are the laws prohibiting murder, rape, armed robbery, motor vehicle theft, etc.  This has not resulted in the repeal of those laws.  The <span class="caps">NAACP </span>is wasting its breath here.</p>

					<p>Fine by me! I am sick of seeing oversized baggy pants. Only last week, I pulled up into a convenience store to pick up a cup of coffee. While waiting in line, there were two young black males standing in front of me, who dropped some change, both were bending over to pick it up. It flabbergasted, and disgusted me watching both of their pants slide down completely exposing their boxer shorts. What amazed me even more, is that after they stood up, they didn&rsquo;t even bother to pull their pants back up! They only concerned themselves with placing their assorted junkfood items on the counter. Paid, then amble slowly away with their pants still hanging off them.</p>

I don&rsquo;t understand why the <span class="caps">NAACP </span>wants to defend the right of black booties hanging out of pants insteading of applauding a positive change.  What&rsquo;s up with that?</p>

					<p>Wearing pants in this manner comes from the corrections system where prisoners are not allowed to have belts, therefore their pants hang low.  Of course blacks have taken this to the extreme, and made it ghetto fabulous.  Why one would want to emulate prison culture is beyond me.  The <span class="caps">NAACP </span>lawyers, if they took left their plush offices, would also know that plenty of other races and genders also wear this horrible style.  I have seen &#8220;manly&#8221; women make themselves look even more foolish by wearing their pants low enough to see boxers.  This look is utterly disrespectful to all that have to see it, and especially to those who wear it.</p>

					<p>Stuff and nonsense, I see plenty of white and hispanic students running around ready to trip over their sagging pants. I don&rsquo;t see what the big deal is, let them wear clown pants for all I care, my guess is most of them will look back when they get older and feel foolish for thinking something so stupid was fashionable.</p>

					<p>Clearly, any standards of academic measurement, any standards of acceptable behavior, any standards of appropriate attire, any standards whatsover - are deemed by certain minorities to be &#8216;white standards&rsquo;.  And, consequently, any attempt to impose those standards upon non-whites is viewed as &#8216;discriminatory&rsquo;.</p>
<p>This reminds me of an on-going conversation that I&rsquo;ve had over the years with one of my best white male friends.  He has repeatedly voiced the opinion that if only blacks would conform, if only they would act more normal - and by normal, he really means: act more like white people, but it is difficult to get him to phrase it in precisely that way.  But, that is exactly what he  craves.  And, the sort of whites who still cling to Rush Limbaugh or Sean Hannity or any of the other neo-con controlled talk radio shows share that very same dream.</p>
<p>Over the years, I have repeatedly asked him why whites should expect or demand that large numbers of non-whites abandon their &#8216;default&rsquo; behavior or lifestyles, which obviously they feel more comfortable with - and pretend as though they are &#8216;white&rsquo; just<br>
to please the dwindling majority?  I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever gotten a satisfactory answer from him for that question.  </p>
<p>But there is an answer, fellow AR readers - and our community knows what it is, right?  Separation.  Complete, total, geographic separation.  That is the solution to this vexing problem,  because adopting that concept - prevents any group from imposing their standards, or their rude behavior upon others who are of a different mindset and culture.</p>
<p>And, besides, black chicks might enjoy eyeballing an unlimited sea of ebony butt cracks - and as a fair white nationalist, I support their right to hog them all for themselves!</p>

					<p>  Black leaders lead to more trouble for blacks who wear their pants too low, have an in your face black attitude, show disrespect and hostility to non-blacks but still expect everyone to respect blacks and not protect themselves.<br>
  To get respect act like you deserve it. Stop insulting others and making blackness whatever hurts other groups.</p>

					<p>lol. too stupid for words? Aimed at black kids because they are the ones who wear there pants low. First, I don&rsquo;t want to see your nasty rear end. Second, do you really think getting a good paying job and taking care of yourself will come if you walk around looking like a common street thug? Stupidity at it&rsquo;s best I tell you. We have all kinds of dress codes in our schools. Kids have to wear belts and they can&rsquo;t wear shorts or hats and no cut offs and no tank tops or belly shirts for the girls. Oh no, we must be racist to put those restrictions on these kids huh? Ya whatever. But let em keep wearing what they want. At least with their uneducated rears running around, my job security will be fine until I retire!</p>

					<p>Everyone suddenly assumes this is targeting black males, but what about all the black <span class="caps">AND </span>white <span class="caps">FEMALES </span>who are walking around in those tight low rider jeans?   The black males may be showing only their shorts, but these females (of all races actually) can hardly sit down in a public area without flashing so much more than just underwear.  How come no one ever makes a fuss about that?  I am seriously getting tired of seeing 25 to 50% of every other young female&rsquo;s bare behind while she is squatting down somewhere in the mall or in the grocery store.  Sometimes I even see this on little girls.  This society as a whole really needs to get its act together when it comes to decency.</p>

					<p>I am opposed to laws like this for many reasons as well.  They put us on a slippery slope.  First, you can&rsquo;t wear baggy pants; then, you can&rsquo;t wear certain colors that are affiliated with gangs; then, you can&rsquo;t wear shirts with a Confederate flag on them because they might &#8220;offend&#8221; someone; then, you can&rsquo;t wear a shirt with any political message; etc.  <br>
If blacks want to look stupid then let them look stupid.  Seeing blacks walking around in public with the waists of their pants around their knees makes it much easier to convince my colleagues of the merits of race realism.</p>

					<p><span class="caps">M.L.</span> King was reportedly in favor of a separate state for Blacks.  Perhaps we should choose the state with the highest Black population such as Mississippi. Subsidize White Mississippians who want to relocate and let&rsquo;s get this thing over with. There will <span class="caps">NEVER </span>be racial harmony. Any investment made in either separation of the races or repatriation to Africa would be an investment in out future security. Let them have two more states like Arizona and New Mexico as well and let them become an independent nation. Even if we have to give them foreign aid in would be well worth it to be rid of them. When one considers the financial burden that the majority of them have been in subsidies, social programs, wasted educational programs, law enforcement expenditures, the penal system  etc., we might come out in the black (no pun intended).</p>
<p>Besides, it would be interesting to see how they fare.<br>

					<p>You&rsquo;re only partially correct in regard to baggy drawers, Kellie.</p>
<p>The low slung pants &#8220;style&#8221; was started in the prisons, but it was done to advertise sexual avalability among black inmates.  If an inmate wore their pants well below the waist, it meant that for a price or simply for fun, they would submit to homosexual acts. </p>
<p>The baggy shirts or jackets prefered by black street thugs also serve a purpose.  They can hide weapons much better.</p>
<p>An aquaintance of mine who is a prison corrections officer told me that when drawing their weekly clothing allowance, many blacks request oversized clothes.  In the prison where he works, they are denied, but in other prisons, to keep the peace, inmates are given the clothes size they want.    </p>

					<p>Another reason there should be no government schools.  Privately-funded schools could have whatever rules they want.  I&rsquo;m not sure taxpayer-supported schools can make fashion rules like this.<br>
  <br><br>
Anyway, you could force ghetto blacks to wear tuxes every day and they would still graduate stupid.</p>

					<p>I think the baggy pants look among blacks should not only be allowed, but encouraged. You see, it&rsquo;s just funny as <span class="caps">H3LL </span>when watching the police chase them, their pants fall around their ankles, and they bust out their two front teeth on the sidewalk when they fall. (A brother can always change his street name from &#8220;Murder Dawg&#8221; to &#8220;No Grill&#8221;.)</p>
<p>You may recall the unfastened baggy bib overall &#8220;fashion statement&#8221; from a few years back. You&rsquo;re excused if you don&rsquo;t; it only lasted about a month. The flying straps from the overalls made convenient handles when again, the police were chasing them.</p>

					<p>The local news in my area did a story on how much easier it was for police to catch blacks due to the way they wear their pants.  I was surprised the news would carry such a story. Naturally, the videos showing the police busting them showed only the lower half of the body. Too bad we can&rsquo;t convince them to wear wooden shoes with the clown pants it would make them ever easier to catch.</p>

					<p>The <span class="caps">NAACP </span>should shut up and deal with it.  All across America White kids like my own endure excessive sun exposure and occasional sunburn at recess, field days etc because school policy prohibits wearing hats.  Why are hats prohibited?  Because Blacks insist on using them to denote gang affiliation, wear them backwards, sideways, etc.  </p>
<p>If my kid has to suffer increased risk of skin cancer just to have a decent school environment, your little darlings can darned sure deal with having to keep their pants pulled up.</p>

Yes you heard me correctly.  It is a black on white civil and human rights abuse.  White people must unite and march against the black racist intimidation and fear against us and other non-black peoples.  It is real and goes on far too much.  </p>

					<p>visine, your kid should not be punished for wearing a hat if it is a public school.  If it is a private school then offer to pay a slightly higher tuition and maybe they will allow it. Otherwise take him out of the school. or unionize the students maybe<br>

This kind of law will be the only thing that ever breaks up their self absorbed, predatory attitude toward the outside world. They certainly wont hear if from their parents.
