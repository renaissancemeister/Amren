						<p>Contrary to popular stereotypes, areas undergoing immigration are associated with lower violence, not spiraling crime, according to a new study.</p>
<p>Harvard University sociologist Robert Sampson examined crime and immigration in Chicago and around the United States to find the truth behind the popular perception that increasing immigration leads to crime.</p>
<p>Sampson&rsquo;s study results, detailed in the winter issue of the American Sociological Association&rsquo;s Contexts magazine, summarizes patterns from seven years&rsquo; worth of violent acts in Chicago committed by whites, blacks and Hispanics from 180 neighborhoods of varying levels of integration. He also analyzed recent data from police records and the U.S. Census for all communities in Chicago.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Not only does immigration appear to be &#8220;protective&#8221; against violence in poverty areas, violence was significantly lower among Mexican-Americans compared to blacks and whites. Sampson refers to this as the &#8220;Latino Paradox,&#8221; whereby Hispanic Americans do better on a range of social indicators &mdash; including propensity to violence &mdash; than one would expect, given their socioeconomic disadvantages.</p>
<p>Sampson&rsquo;s analysis also revealed that first-generation immigrants were 45 percent less likely to commit violence than third-generation Americans. Controlling for immigrant generation even narrowed the violence gap between whites and blacks in Chicago by 14 percent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Immigration is therefore not just a Hispanic issue; although little noticed, increasing foreign-born diversity among blacks (e.g., from the West Indies and Africa) is associated with lower crime even within segregated black communities.</p>
<p>Sampson&rsquo;s arguments are supported at the national level as well. Significant immigration growth &mdash; including by illegal aliens &mdash; occurred in the mid-1990s, peaking at the end of the decade. During this time, the national homicide rate plunged. Crime dropped even in immigration hot spots, such as Los Angeles (where it dropped 45 percent overall), San Jose, Dallas and Phoenix.</p>
<p>Reasons commonly cited for the apparent paradox of first generation immigrants, especially Mexicans, are motivation to work, ambition and a desire not to be deported, characteristics that predispose them to low crime. Sampson also argues that contemporary immigrants tend to come from a multitude of cultures around the world where violence isn&rsquo;t rewarded as a strategy for establishing reputation or preserving honor, as in American &#8220;street culture.&#8221;</p>

					<p>The first generation vs subsequent generation debate within this study explains it.  Another explanation why crime is down &#8220;per capita&#8221; in Hispanic-immigrant heavy cities like Los Angeles is that, thanks to the higher birth rates, there are a lot more &#8220;capitas&#8221; (in the form of young children) to dilute the &#8220;rate&#8221; of crime.</p>

					<p>&#8220;Contrary to popular stereotypes, areas undergoing immigration are associated with lower violence, not spiraling crime, according to a new study.&#8221;</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have to read any further than the above to know that this is nothing more than another corrupt study where the outcome was determnined beforehand, then data was obtained to support the foregone conclusion.</p>
<p>Why do I say that?  Besides being fairly well read on the subject myself and know from all the available information on the influx of third worlders, I&rsquo;ve lived and worked in heavily mestizo areas in Calif., Texas, Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, and Florida, and I&rsquo;ve seen firsthand the amount of crime that goes on within these areas. It is indeed phenomenol.  To claim otherwise is just bald faced lying.</p>
<p>These corrupt criminals who conducted the study and the miscreants who paid for it should be tried, convicted and hanged for their deplorable falsifications, because they&rsquo;re encouraging not only property crimes and assaults, they&rsquo;re in effect supporting any new murders and <span class="caps">DUI </span>deaths committed by these people.</p>

<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>Would Mr. Sampson care to explain why 33% of the American prison population is comprised of illegal aliens? If one-third of our prison population is composed of illegals, it absurdifies the notion that growth from Hispanic immigration, legal and illegal, decreases crime-rates. As a matter of fact, it does just the opposite.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reasons commonly cited for the apparent paradox of first generation immigrants, especially Mexicans, are motivation to work, ambition and a desire not to be deported, characteristics that predispose them to low crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>If Mexicans were motivated to work, why would at least half of Hispanics in America consume some form of welfare?</p>

					<p>I&rsquo;m sure the author would not explain <span class="caps">HOW </span>the crime rate becomes reduced.  Blacks are much more violent and crime prone than hispanics.  As hispanics move into an area, the crime rate drops, of course.  However, those blacks don&rsquo;t simply disappear, lol.  They move to a different location and increase the amount of crime there.</p>
<p>On a national level, the problem is covered up by the fact that whites are becoming incredibly non-criminal.  Crime done by whites is plunging at an incredible rate.  However, the fact that many times, hispanic crime is lumped in with white crime hides what is going on.  It hides the fact that white crime is decreasing so much.  And it hides the fact that immigrants bring a large net gain in crime as the problems of other countries are imported to the <span class="caps">US. </span> We should force our government agencies to separate white and hispanic crime stats so we can get a much clearer picture of the truth.  Then, we should make policy based on this (ie kick out illegals and not allow much legal immigration).</p>

					<p>Immigrants and illegal invaders. One group has a right to be here, one group has a right to handcuffs, prison and deportation. Purposefully mixing the two issues is common with the media, and &#8216;researchers&rsquo; with an agenda to push.</p>
<p>While I think legal immigration levels are set way too high, even one illegal alien is one too many. Just as one crooked employer, or one crooked politician is one too many.</p>
<p>We can honestly discuss our immigration laws. But it isn&rsquo;t honest when it involves illegal aliens. Just as it is not  reasonable to discuss the benefit to society that can be attributed to bank robbery. Sure the bank robbers spread their loot around the community, but no one argues the &#8216;benefit&rsquo; as an excuse to increase or tolerate more bank robberies. Attempting to legitimize the illegal alien presence through agenda filled &#8216;research&rsquo; is offensive. No studies are needed, no excuses are wanted. Deport em all. </p>

					<p>Hispanic is a broad term. I have found  that Dominicans and Puerto Ricans on the East Coast tend to be more crime prone than Mexicans who seem to be a fairly mellow people (although I&rsquo;ve never lived in <span class="caps">L.A </span>so I haven&rsquo;t had the full experience)</p>

					<p>The bulk of these newer &#8220;immigrants&#8221; are Mexican. In my own experience, Mexicans do indeed seem to keep somewhat to themselves, avoid confrontation and are fairly docile in attitude. The fact that a large majority of them are here illegally and do not wish to call attention to themselves(at least on the local level)and seriously fear authorites like nobody&rsquo;s business, probably explains a lot of this.  </p>

					<p>You guys have to understand &#8220;liberal-speak&#8221;.  Otherwise, let me translate for you.</p>
<p>Notice the the word &#8220;violence&#8221; and then see how the word &#8220;crime&#8221; is casually woven into the article. The study probably focused on violent crime like rape, armed robbery and murder. Therefore nonviolent crime like grand theft auto, identity theft, drug dealing, and prostitution (typical immigrant non-violent crime)weren&rsquo;t given much review.</p>
<p>Also factor in the following: most hoodlums don&rsquo;t commit crimes in their own neigborhoods for fear of being recognized and the grass is usually greener on another side of town where the money is.</p>
<p>Another factor is that while most immigrants are busy working for slave wages their anchor babies (non-immigrants) have moved out and are gang banging on another side of town.</p>

					<p>I wonder - are they using the Fed&rsquo;s statistics which includes &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; (yes, I am well aware that Mexicans and other Central Americans are not related at all to Hispania i.e. the Spanish peninsula), along with anyone from Algerians to Egyptians to Turks to Pakistanis as &#8220;white&#8221;, in relation to perpetrators?</p>
<p>Or could it just be Mexicans ethnically-cleansing black neighbourhoods?</p>

					<p>I believe this report. As a White hispanic (please remember that Spain is a European country and many of the descendants came to Latin American and did not mix with blacks and indians) I grew up in a black and hispanic neighborhood. Besides getting drunk on Sundays and overcrowding apartment buidlings, the Mexicans stick to themselves and dont start any trouble. In fact the blacks target them vicously with robberies and terrible assaults that here in Delaware, they refuse to call it a hate crime for fear of upsetting the black community. I would rather live and work around a bunch of Mexicans that have to deal with the ghetto animal-like behavior of these young black thugs who terrorize the City of Wilmington. I&rsquo;ve never been attacked, robbed or threatened by them. Its so bad that many mexicans are now bypassing the city and moving into working class suburbs to get away from the black. </p>

					<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine more blatant piece of propaganda. It&rsquo;s like proof that Earth is flat or that Marxism is a sure prescription for workers&rsquo; paradise. I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of deceitful &#8220;research&#8221; like this.</p>
<p>Here are some weaknesse with this kind of statistics.</p>
<p>1. &#8220;Immigrants&#8221; (particlularly, illegals) tend to flee the country when <span class="caps">FBI </span>is chasing them. This make sampling unfairly biased because those who successfully fled are not counted as &#8220;immigrant&#8221; criminals.</p>
<p>2. Many &#8220;immigrant&#8221; criminals posses multiple identities that makes average number of crimes committed by a single immigrant appear lower than actual.</p>
<p>3. Many immigrants abide by the law in order to avoid deportation. Once, they root themselves here, they become less particular in not breaking the law.</p>
<p>4. <b>These are the children and grand children of immigrants that really drive the crime rates in the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>up</b>. Of course, the mentioned above &#8220;research&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t even mention this inconvenient truth.</p>

					<p>a posteriori wrong.  On amren&rsquo;s webiste there&rsquo;s a link to &#8216;hispanics, a statistical portrait.&rsquo;  In it you will find that hispanic crime rates are 3 times as high as the white crime rate.  You&rsquo;ll also find they have higher poverty, welfare, school drop out, illegitimacy, etc rates.  Go ahead and read it, then come back and lecture us for our &#8216;prejudice.&rsquo;</p>

					<p>Notice how the &#8220;study&#8221; somehow analyzes &#8220;violence&#8221; (an undefined term) and then concludes that this demonstrates a lower crime rate.  &#8220;Violence&#8221; will of course include all the phony crimes of which white men are guilty by birth, such as &#8220;spouse abuse&#8221; (i.e. being in the same state when your spouse is unhappy), &#8220;child abuse&#8221;, &#8220;hate crimes&#8221;, etc.  Thought crimes are probably included as well.  Violence includes all those incidents of kids taking to school a book that has photo of a gun in it.  Remember that white society is fraught with all kinds of &#8220;violence&#8221;, all of which should be crimes if they aren&rsquo;t already in the liberal mind.</p>
<p>For my study, I look at the racial composition of California&rsquo;s prisons, almost entirely Hispanic.  End of study.</p>

					<p>Robert Sampson is the chairman of the sociology department at Harvard University.   This is the same Harvard that lynched, figuratively, school President Lawrence H. Summers for deviating from party line on girls and science.  Is there any one in the world dumb enough to believe that Sampson would give up his high paying job to tell the truth?<br>
&ldquo;Sampson refers to this as the &lsquo;Latino Paradox,&rsquo; whereby Hispanic Americans do better on a range of social indicators &mdash; including propensity to violence &mdash; than one would expect, given their socioeconomic disadvantages.&rdquo;  <br><br>
Remember the US government records Hispanic crime offenders as white.  So Sampson&rsquo;s Latino Paradox evaporates before he can serve it up to intelligent Americans.  <br><br>
But he knows that better than we.  His job is quiet like that of the Soviet plants in the State Department who sold America on Joe Stalin and Chairman Mao.  The gibberish study will be used by his fellow con men, such as Dean of Admissions Henry Broaddus, of William and Mary, to sell the college kids on the joys of diversity.<br><br>

only to fool the gullible, that do not live near these immigrants. Just watch the evening news, and dare to<br><br>
journey in any central city, and you will know the truth.<br><br>
Wait until the economy crashes, and you will see the Rodney<br><br>
King riots in a much more grand scale. Many of the recent<br><br>
immigrants are unskilled, uneducated, and proned to violence.<br><br>
They were brought into the country for a purpose, and that is<br><br>
to bring the country down, when the time comes.</p>

<p><i> Any study that disagrees with my opinions&hellip;is a priori wrong. Surely you white nationalists know that piece of everyday Latin. </i></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very easy for me (and apparently most of my fellow posters also..) to believe that &#8220;immigrants&#8221; which lumps Asian, African, European, Canadian, Arabic, and Latino immigrants (legal and illegal) together are less crime prone than native Black Americans. For example Blacks are 28 times more likely to commit violent crimes than Asians. The legal immigration process is lengthy and does an OK job of weeding out bad elements. (There are of course quite a few exceptions..) </p>
<p>However, collectively the generations of Latinos (and there are many varieties.. the large majority of Amren posters believe that Spaniards are White..) born in the US commit crime at levels roughly 3 times higher than native born Whites. I would like to see the data that these headline conclusions were based upon.</p>
<p>Take a look at the <span class="caps">LAPD&rsquo;</span>s most wanted:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lapdonline.org/all_most_wanted" rel="nofollow">https://www.lapdonline.org/all_most_wanted</a></p>
<p>Per wikipedia LA is 30% White. </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles,_California#Demographics" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles,_California#Demographics</a></p>
<p>There are some White faces in the list above but Whites don&rsquo;t come close to the 30% mark.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s take a look at the <span class="caps">FBI&rsquo;</span>s most wanted for Chicago:</p>
<p>https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/fo/cgwanted.htm</p>
<p>Hmmm 2 White perpetrators out of 19 (and one of the White people is from Uzbekistan and well&hellip; looks more Turkic to me..) </p>
<p>Per wikipedia Chicago is 31.3% White. Again Whites are underrepresented when it comes to crime. </p>
<p>Then we have this list:</p>
<p>https://www.usdoj.gov/dea/fugitives/chicago/chi-list.htm</p>
<p>Gee 2 White guys (both of whom were born outside of the US) out 42 perpetrators. 4.76% of the perps when Whites are 31.3% of the population.. hmmm. </p>

In regards to the previous poster feeling much safer in Latino neighborhoods as opposed to Black neighborhoods. That has been my experience as well. I did have several problems with theft and petty vandalism but was never threatened with violence. However Latino gangs would go at each frequently but would generally ignore Anglos. I do know of several women (White, Latina, and Asian) who felt pretty intimidated by some Latino men&rsquo;s advances.. but nothing horrible happened to them. In Black neighborhoods I have lived in&hellip; well I felt like I was wearing a target. There were some nice people (They were almost always over 40.. and there were a few rather religious people who respectful of themselves and others..) but there was an undercurrent of hostility. <br><br>

					<p>&#8220;Sampson&rsquo;s arguments are supported at the national level as well. Significant immigration growth &mdash; including by illegal aliens &mdash; occurred in the mid-1990s, peaking at the end of the decade. During this time, the national homicide rate plunged. Crime dropped even in immigration hot spots, such as Los Angeles (where it dropped 45 percent overall), San Jose, Dallas and Phoenix.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks Prof Sampson.  The violent crime rate has now leveled off.  The mestizo immigration wave is not lowering the crime rate any further and is now obviously ineffective and obsolete.  Is it OK with you to fortify the border now?</p>

					<p>Immigrant crime is mainly directed at fellow immigrants, who don&rsquo;t call the police, and so never shows up in the statistics.  Police departments in immigrant infested areas have do gooder programs to convince the foreigners to report crime, but they&rsquo;re not very successful.  </p>

					<p>A factor which must be considered too is the time lag for immigrant crime. A newly arrived immigrant needs some time to build up a criminal career. First, he must get aquainted with his environment, expore opportunities etc. Then, after his first crime, he will not be immediately caught and convicted, but, the US police and justice systems being as they are, there will several years pass before he shows up in crime statistics. A surge in immigration will be followed by a surge in statistically registered crime with a time lag of about 5 to 10 years only.</p>

					<p>Of course the only and real reson why homicide rates plunged in tandem with the immigration explosion was the imposition of draconian penal policies in the <span class="caps">USA </span>giving rise to the fact that the <span class="caps">USA </span>has an absurdly high prison population - the highest in the world.<br>
Put simply most potential murders are banged up out of sight and out of mind before they get the opportunity to kill.</p>

					<p>  This &#8220;study&#8221; is filled with outright falsehooods. It may be true that in the first wave of immigrants there are many more older adults but when their children are born, and also their children&rsquo;s children there is increasing drugs use, violence, out of wedlock birth and everything else which burndens taxpayers and jails.</p>
<p>  It is amazing to me how we have seemingly lost the desire for truth regardless of the emotional connection and instead formulate our own reality. True is not relative folks.</p>

					<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Contrary to popular stereotypes, areas undergoing immigration are associated with lower violence, not spiraling crime, according to a new study.</p>
<p>&#8220;AND A <span class="caps">LIE, REPEATED OFTEN ENOUGH, BECOMES THE TRUTH</span>&#8221;, per Nazi Propagana Minister Josef Goebbels.</p>
<p>Either our &#8220;learned expert&#8221; based his studies on wishful dreaming or, more likely, has his head planted in an area   &mdash;    considered biologically impossible.</p>
<p>Has Robert Sampson bothered to study the immigrant crime rate in Southern California, for example? Or those other border states   &mdash;   Arizona, Texas, New Mexico   &mdash;   or more removed states like Colorado and Utah? Or is he simply (more likely) <span class="caps">PAID</span> TO <span class="caps">SPREAD THE DISINFORMATION AND LIES</span> IN <span class="caps">HIS REPORT</span>?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty well confident those many Whites leaving Southern California are more anxious to get away from the vast amount of Hispanic crime, than worrying about fleeing the traffic problems.</p>
<p>Crime <span class="caps">RISES </span>commensurate with immigration! Which is <span class="caps">WHY </span>so many of us who learned that truth the hard way, are dead set against allowing sill more Mexican trash into our country!</p>

					<p>To Schoolteacher, I would respectfully point out that immigrant crime is not nearly always directed at immigrants. Witness the car thefts/carjackings, the shoplifting, burglaries, petty thefts perpetrated by generally illegal Mexican immigrants. Note that the very nature of those crimes just mentioned are more likely to be directed <span class="caps">AGAINST </span>non-immigrants who obviously would be far more affluent targets to the criminal immigrant element.</p>
<p>Those bogus points cited also do not take into consideration that millions of immgigrants are probably based on <span class="caps">TOTAL</span> US population and not on the total number of Hispanic immigrants. Having the effect of <span class="caps">SKEWING</span> Sampson&rsquo;s &#8220;results.&#8221;</p>
<p>A friend has a daughter living in Phoenix, AZ   &mdash;   a gateway to the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>for the damned illegals. Crime there is so bad Whites generally do not go out after dark unless armed! Hey, only a fool (or illegal immigrant) drives without car insurance. Only a fool worries about the nicety of a carry-permit if he has to go out into a perceived dangerous environment. Better to risk a fine and save your life, if necessary   &mdash;   than to be caught unarmed by a gang of illegals needing money to continue their journey.</p>
<p>Please note that muggings, carjackings, burglaries, petty thefts, shoplifting   &mdash;   all tending to be the crimes Hispanic immigrants gravitate to, DO <span class="caps">NOT </span>make the newspapers or newscasts. <span class="caps">BECAUSE THEY ARE TOO COMMONPLACE</span>! In some areas law enforcement officials can&rsquo;t be bothered with the paperwork because the chances of catching the Hispanic perp are virtually zero.</p>
<p>Yet another factor   &mdash;   most of the statistics Sampson draws on are from our federal government. Which translates to mean <span class="caps">HISPANICS </span>in the crime &#8220;studies&#8221; generally are listed as White or Caucasian. Which makes the Mexicans/Hispanics look somewhat less crime-prone to the unenlightened people.</p>
<p>A fair question then being <span class="caps">WHY </span>would our government deliberately downplay the vast amount of crime by illegal Hispanic (or legal Hispanics)? If not to brainwash unthinking Americans into believing &#8220;all&rsquo;s well   &mdash;   the illegals are benign, good for the economy&#8221; as the propaganda spiel goes.<br>

					<p>Here&rsquo;s a headline you&rsquo;d like to see, &ldquo;Professor Puts Money Where Mouth Is&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robert Sampson, Harvard professor of sociology, is moving his family into &ldquo;Inter-City Hood&rdquo; to show how research on diversity is really true.  In a dramatic move to quell the derisive laughter that greeted his latest research study, that purported to discredit the widely held belief that minorities and immigrants bring on a massive increase in the crime rate where they reside, Professor Sampson pick up his family, books, bike, and has left his plush quarters in the lily white district of Harvard land, and rented a double in the heart of the Boston &ldquo;Hood&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can do no less than what I ask my fellow white Americans to do, and that is put their life in the hands, and at the mercy of minorities and immigrants.&rdquo;  Sampson&rsquo;s son and daughter, both away at prep school, say they will not stay with relatives during break, but fully intend to join their father in his stereotype-breaking adventure.  His wife, vacationing in Europe, will also join hubby, when she returns, she promises.  Faithful family dog, <span class="caps">JFK, </span>is staying at the Crimson Kennel Club, however.        </p>
<p>Sampson invited his fellow sociological professors to join him to prove to the Doubting Thomases that breaking-stereotype research is not just a scam to get jobs and promotions in liberal academia.<br>

					<p>White crime is de facto nonexistent in Chicago. Are the yuppies, cops, and fireman committing gang crimes? Hilarious! In addition, it&rsquo;s true that immigrants don&rsquo;t commit much crime other than <span class="caps">DUI </span>in the Chicago metro area and in the US as well; the immigrants&rsquo; children and grandchildren are the gangbanging, pregnant-at-15, high-school-droputs, who are on one form of welfare or another for their entire lives. This study is pure racial politics,having nothing whatsoever to do with scholarship. </p>

					<p>The lie of the year!   When I read/hear local news the number of immigrants are majority. There is no validation of data or resources for this deceit. All we need to do is look around and see the sex crimes upon children, the graffitti, the <span class="caps">DUI </span>murders, the robberies, and names of those convited for klling police!  Check it out! Here in CA the immigrants who run the state through thuggery are demanding equal arrests and convictions based on race.  They say they are discriminated and profiled while never acknowledging the facts. They want police to have  equal numbers of criminals to match the census data to prove they are not really committing more crimes. Ridiculous.<br>
These crooks never keep the laws and most broke basic immigration laws (fraud)to be here. Immigrants have made crime& reproduction their biggest pursuit. V</p>

					<p>&#8220;Reasons commonly cited for the apparent paradox of first generation immigrants, especially Mexicans, are motivation to work, ambition and a desire not to be deported, characteristics that predispose them to low crime&#8221;</p>
<p>Ok genius. But what about the successive generations? Short term thinking and no consideration for the long term consequences of immigraiton from 3rd world countries is what has gotten us into this mess in the first place. The entitlement/victim mentality sets in by 2nd generation and crime rates soar leaving our children to deal with the folly of our current decisions. It is the short term thinking of ilberals that will doom our country, if not the entire white race.</p>
