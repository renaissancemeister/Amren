						<p>The Rev. Amos Brown&rsquo;s Easter sermon at the Third Baptist Church of San Francisco didn&rsquo;t have much to do with Jesus&rsquo; crucifixion or resurrection from the dead and instead covered everything from skyrocketing gas prices and the subprime mortgage crisis to race relations in the United States and presidential politics.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no coincidence that Brown&rsquo;s raspy-voiced, roaring sermon sounded vaguely familiar to the controversial sermons delivered by Sen. Barack Obama&rsquo;s longtime pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright.</p>
<p>Brown and Wright are friends and graduated years ago from the same seminary class in Dayton, Ohio. Brown, whose own sermons have sparked controversy and grabbed headlines, has a picture of Wright in his church office.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Excerpts of Wright&rsquo;s sermons as he rails against the United States and accuses it of responsibility for the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks have been airing regularly on cable news stations in recent days, creating a political firestorm for the Democratic candidate for president that prompted his speech last week on race relations.</p>
<p>Brown and many congregants at the Third Baptist Church wonder exactly what the controversy is all about.</p>
<p>Wright&rsquo;s sermons are no different than sermons that get delivered every weekend in black churches around the country, said Gordon Greenwood, a lawyer who attends the Western Addition-area church. &#8220;And it&rsquo;s not just churches,&#8221; Greenwood said. &#8220;You could walk into a black barber shop or beauty shop and this is being talked about all day.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Sunday, [Brown] told a packed church that the criticisms being hurled at Obama for his close ties to Wright are part of a conspiracy aimed at damaging the candidate on the issue of religion because there&rsquo;s not another negative issue out there that has tarnished his reputation.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you are seeing happening to Barack Obama was hatched, crafted and developed a year ago when you were sleeping,&#8221; Brown told churchgoers. &#8220;This kind of nonsense does not just happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;White people do not understand the experience we&rsquo;ve had in this country,&#8221; said Doris Ward, a former San Francisco supervisor who attends Third Baptist.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Fellow churchgoer Maggie Bullocks said she was not surprised that people who are unfamiliar with such fiery-tongued preaching might misinterpret Wright&rsquo;s sermons.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the United States is supposed to be a country where people can voice their opinions,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You don&rsquo;t always have to agree.&#8221;<br>

					<p>Maggie Bullocks is right. &#8220;You don&rsquo;t have to always agree.&#8221; And I don&rsquo;t. But as an American, I believe in the right of her pastor and anybody else to say the things they want to say. On the other hand, Ms Bullock knows that what her pastor and Rev. Wright are saying are meant to incite black people to violence and she shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised at the inevitabvle backlash from White people. Something tells me though that Ms Bullock and her bretheran will be extremely surprised when they see they can&rsquo;t put the genie they&rsquo;ve released back in the bottle.</p>

<p>This is what I mean when I write so often on this site about black lack of intellect and inability to reason in coherent terms.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so obvious what this preacher meant that the suggestion to open the issue up for &#8220;interepretation&#8221; could only make sense to someone so mentally challenged rational discussion would be impossible.</p>
<p>Almost every black that speaks out on the issue is supporting this evil miscreant, which offers white America a clear view of how far anti-white hatred extends within their communities.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s out control, making it perfectly understandable to those of us who know why black on white crime is at a critical level.</p>

					<p>Jeremiah Wright is not unique. Nor is that endless tendency of Blacks to blame racism, rather than themselves, for being unable to amount to anything!</p>
<p>But then only a mean-spirited White racist would <span class="caps">REFUSE </span>to hire a young Black school drop-out   &mdash;   with no education, no experience, and certainly no job-related skills   &mdash;   at a %65,000 a year job! Call it what it is: Sheer Racism!</p>
<p>Just think: Two thousand years from now, dysfunctional Black failures, criminals and sociopaths in general   &mdash;   will still blame &#8220;racism&#8221; for their collective failures. Why not compare the accomplishments of the White race over the last 5,000 years to the accomplishments of Africans. You&rsquo;ll get the point!</p>

					<p>Doris Ward, who talks about what white people do not understand about the black experience, was the former Assessor of San Francisco who was elected to two terms by the brain dead, Marxist pinko voters of <span class="caps">SF.S</span>he was completely useless, unqualified, and incompetent for that job.She was so bad that even the black community campaigned against her running for a third term.Amos brown is just as bad as reverend Wright,the only difference is that he has gotten no attention. </p>

					<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised by what is said at Obama&rsquo;s church.  What is said there is in the mainstream of black thinking.  For example:</p>
<p>Bill Cosby said <span class="caps">AIDS </span>was &#8220;started by human beings to get after certain people they don&rsquo;t like&#8221;. And&hellip;<br>
Spike Lee proclaimed in a Benneton ad that &#8220;AIDS is a government-engineered disease&#8221;. And&hellip;<br><br>
On Arsenio Hall&rsquo;s talkshow, Kool Moe Dee said <span class="caps">AIDS </span>was a genocidal plot against blacks. And&hellip;<br><br>
Louis Farrakhan said the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>government shipped a billion units of <span class="caps">AIDS </span>to Africa to annihilate Africa&rsquo;s black population. And&hellip;<br><br>
Former Chicago municipal official Steven Cokely declared Jewish doctors injected black babies with <span class="caps">AIDS </span>as part of a plot to take over the world. <span class="caps">AND&hellip;</span><br><br>
In a 1990 poll, 29% of black New Yorkers believed <span class="caps">AIDS </span>was deliberately created in a lab to infect black people. (New York Times, Oct. 29, 1990)<br><br>
A 1990 survey found that 34% believed the <span class="caps">AIDS </span>virus was produced in a germ warfare lab. (Boston Globe, Nov. 2, 1995)<br><br>
Today, a growing number of people believe that <span class="caps">HIV </span>does not cause <span class="caps">AIDS, </span>that <span class="caps">AIDS </span>is not contagious, and/or that <span class="caps">HIV </span>cannot be transmitted.</p>
<p>You see, just from the above, you can tell that they hate white people, and how could Obama not be affected by how the black population thinks, he&rsquo;s most likely perfectly in tune with it.<br>

					<p>Jesus is an obvious afterthought or at most, a window dressing for these black churches as they exploit their tax free status as supposed places of religious worship.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t expect a typical black to be honest nor do I expect honesty from their culture.  I&rsquo;ve had just too much experience with them and know that they will adjust any argument, fabricate any story, or alter an historical record as it suits them. Their &#8220;churches&#8221; are obvious meeting places for indoctrination where their handlers invent fantasy scenarios that focus on their fantasy victimhood.  </p>
<p>From pulpits across the country, black reverends keep the hate alive, and demand more handouts from the government. Why not?  They&rsquo;re tax exempt and it&rsquo;s oh so profitable.   </p>

					<p>&#8220;In Black Churches, Fiery Sermons are the Norm&#8221;&hellip;  </p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s one church or a thousand churches, fiery racist and hateful sermons are still wrong!  As the old saying goes, &#8220;Two wrongs don&rsquo;t make it right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you are seeing happening to Barack Obama was hatched, crafted and developed a year ago when you were sleeping,&rdquo; Brown told churchgoers. &ldquo;This kind of nonsense does not just happen&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>And 30 years of preaching racist and hateful Anti-white, Anti-American sermons didn&rsquo;t happen overnight.</p>

					<p>I had wondered for years why so many blacks spent hours a week in church and then lived immoral lives.  How could an unmarried high school dropout spend every Sunday listening to Christian sermons then pop out 5 kids by 5 different men?  How could the black &#8220;community&#8221; have such high church attendance yet be such bad neighbors?  Why was there so much crime and child neglect committed by supposedly observant Christians?  It was a mystery that nagged at me&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, Pastorgate answered those questions, and the resulting articles on &#8220;black church culture&#8221; confirmed it.  Blacks aren&rsquo;t spending Sundays learning about Christ&rsquo;s moral teachings and calls for personal responsibility!  Church is just a big hate-whitey party for them.  They apparently sing and dance and holler and jump around complaining about &#8220;racism&#8221; and how evil whites are responsible for everything that goers wrong in their lives.  Jesus has nothing to do with their church attendance.  </p>

					<p>&ldquo;But the United States is supposed to be a country where people can voice their opinions,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t always have to agree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Oh really? People like Don Imus (whom Barack Obama <span class="caps">DEMANDED </span>be immediately fired), Al Campanis, Marge Schott, the &#8220;Rocket&#8221;, Jimmy the Greek, Rush Limbaugh, Fuzzy Zellar, Michael Richards, the &#8220;Dog&#8221;, and on and on&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;White people do not understand the experience we&rsquo;ve had in this country,&rdquo; said Doris Ward, a former San Francisco supervisor who attends Third Baptist.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;You hear black bigotry being justified because &ldquo;whites haven&rsquo;t been through what blacks have&rdquo;. That is the <span class="caps">BIG LIE.</span> Black &#8220;grievances&#8221; against whites are based on present day <span class="caps">MYTHS </span>and paranoia mostly reflecting blacks&rsquo; <span class="caps">OWN </span>rampant racism and fruits of their <span class="caps">OWN </span>destructive behavior, encouraged by this very racial scapegoating. And based on irrelevant grievances regarding things that happened between different people long dead and gone: And even these irrelevant &#8220;historical&#8221; grievances are distorted and cherry-picked: For instance you never hear about the whites who fought slavery, from the white Abolitionists to the white Northern soldiers of the Civil War, or the fact that it was none other than black Africans who operated and completely controlled the African slave trade.<br>
On the other hand, white grievances against blacks are <span class="caps">REAL </span>and involve the people living <span class="caps">TODAY </span>and the <span class="caps">PRESENT.</span> We&rsquo;re talking about such things as the one million whites who are victims of violence at the hands of blacks each year in this country, twelve times the reverse, including 30,000 black on white rapes each year, the reverse nearly non-existent. (And this scale of one-sided black on white racial atrocities has been going on for <span class="caps">HALF</span> A <span class="caps">CENTURY </span>now.) <br><br>
We&rsquo;re talking about legalized Jim-Crow style racial discrimination against whites in every sphere of life in this country. <br><br>
We&rsquo;re talking about visceral hate-whitey propaganda that permeates academia, media, and popular culture.<br><br>
Blacks have nothing to talk about. Blacks are the most privileged race in this country. Blacks are the most <span class="caps">RACIST </span>race in this country. Whites are the <span class="caps">LEAST </span>racist and most self-sacrificing race. <br><br>
It is <span class="caps">WHITES </span>who have a <span class="caps">REAL </span>basis for racial rage. Not blacks. Let a black be turned into a white and dropped in the middle of any black neighborhood in this country: Then he&rsquo;d find out a little about what <span class="caps">WHITES </span>&ldquo;are going through&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Now that is ridiculously funny. I have worked with black churches and witnessed pastors calling each other &#8220;N###a&#8221; when they thought no one was around, denigrating whites openly, encouraging the use of the welfare system, etc. One pastor, after making a racially charged comment in front of me to another parishioner, said &#8220;Don&rsquo;t worry about him, he&rsquo;s one of the good white folks. He understands.&#8221; Actually, I didn&rsquo;t. I was even openly criticised for not jumping up and down and yelling during the worship service! The only thing these churches preached was &#8220;pay the pastor to get paid by God and be a good sheep. Even in the most non-racialially motivated churches it was still inevitably the white mans fault.</p>
<p>Black churches, and seeing the black community up-close, led to my racial awakening.</p>

					<p>  Sometimes  thank God that I belong to the Catholic Church where I am almost certain to not hear politics/race baiting in place of the Jesus centered Christian message.</p>
<p>  These people have absolutely no prerequisite to begin a church, they pool money, find a &#8220;pastor&#8221;, and presto! There you are&hellip;a black church in 5 minutes. </p>

					<p>&gt;Obamma has started a <span class="caps">RACE WAR</span> Blacks cannot win. </p>
<p>&gt;Posted by the Soviet Republic of New Jersey at 6:32 PM on March 25 </p>

Get real.  Barack Obama has hardly started a &#8220;race war.&#8221;  What he has started quite the opposite, racial reconciliation.  The war you perceive is merely the angst in your head of watching the country beginning to move beyond racist manipulation of electorate.  Soon, the Reverend Wright issue will only be a hot topic, for obvious reasons, on blogs like this one.</p>

					<p>Why do these &#8220;houses of worship&#8221; still have tax exempt status?  Could it be that our &#8220;honorable&#8221;  politicians on both sides of the aisle lack anything closely related to a backbone?  </p>

					<p>I took a course on slave religion, learned of their &#8216;spirituals&rsquo; and physical participation. I&rsquo;ve been to a black chuch in Georgia. A lot of stomping, head thrusting, loud talk, and attendee support. I&rsquo;ve seen the blacks in their brightly colored get-ups on Sundays. We&rsquo;ve all seen and heard of examples like these.</p>
<p>I have to assume that most all-black churches are not much differnt from those gatherings on their master&rsquo;s property. (But now, there is more to consider and more responsibility required when you&rsquo;re a free man wanting &#8216;equality&rsquo; with other free men.)</p>

					<p>&#8220;&#8216;White people do not understand the experience we&rsquo;ve had in this country,&rsquo; said Doris Ward, a former San Francisco supervisor who attends Third Baptist.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right. I don&rsquo;t understand  what it&rsquo;s like to rape someone, shoot someone, rob someone with a gun, murder someone, or rejoice when the people who do these things escape punishment, as happened with <span class="caps">O.J.</span></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand the experience of worshipping a continent I&rsquo;d never want to live in, rather than offering thanks every Sunday morning that I live in a society that offers me opportunity and a decent level of material comfort.</p>
<p>And a society that was the first in the world to outlaw the human bondage that is still practiced in parts of that other continent that I worship.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s okay.  Blacks are not my children, not my wife  &mdash;  I&rsquo;m not required to understand them. </p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t seem to understand that. <br>

					<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&ldquo;White people do not understand the experience we&rsquo;ve had in this country.&rdquo;<br>
 &mdash; Doris Ward</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because White people are not foolish enough to watch that nonsensical <span class="caps">ROOTS </span>film, or read Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin and believe it to be historic, verifiable <span class="caps">REALITY</span>! Please, describe <span class="caps">YOUR </span>experience   &mdash;   We&rsquo;re dying to hear it. Yes, your many-times removed ancestors   &mdash;   some (not all, of course) <span class="caps">DID </span>serve as slaves. There was discrimination   &mdash;   based <span class="caps">NOT </span>on racism but a very real understanding of the <span class="caps">BLACK </span>mentality! Which is amplt borne out by the incredible <span class="caps">JUMP </span>in Black-on-White violence and crime since 1965!(Our forbears had damned sound reasons for keeping your people under tight control!)</p>
<p>For Pete&rsquo;s sake, get off that damned whining self-pity. Get a life, you Doris Ward types. What happened before 1965, before 1864 is now <span class="caps">ANCIENT HISTORY</span>!</p>
<p>Nasty White racists aren&rsquo;t filling your kids&rsquo; heads with that trash called rap music, forcing them to wear clothing that even circus clowns would disdain. Forcing them to do everything and anything possible <span class="caps">NOT </span>to learn anything in school.</p>
<p>Since 1965 NO qualified Blacks could be denied a job for race or skin color! Also a hell of a lot of very much <span class="caps">UNQUALIFIED</span> Blacks landed decent jobs! I know, I was working by 1965. When most of the Black employees were regarded as an additional form of &#8220;taxation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Your people have had nearly a half-century to get your act together. The progress you&rsquo;ve made? Black kids killing other Black kids for sneakers, for wearing the wrong &#8220;gang colors,&#8221; for a dozen other equally stupid reasons. Drug and alcohol abuse flourishing among Blacks. The very fact SO <span class="caps">MANY</span> Blacks today are working at jobs   &mdash;   at <span class="caps">ALL </span>levels, at <span class="caps">ALL </span>wage levels demonstrates the utter stupidity of Blacks claiming <span class="caps">RACISM </span>keeps them in poverty! Because they <span class="caps">ARE NOT KEPT DOWN </span>  &mdash;   if anything, thanks to affirmative action, a Black has the advantage over a White, experience and qualifications being equal.</p>
<p>Read a history book on medieval European history (if you can actually read and assimilate). Learn how White serfs lived   &mdash;   slaves in everything but name. Yes, that included MY own ancestors. Your people are literally dying for respect   &mdash;   which you will never get. Respect being something to be <span class="caps">EARNED </span>rather than received like a dog given a treat. You <span class="caps">EARN </span>respect by acting like decent human beings. By slapping the nonsense of rap music, gangsta culture, worthless role models, the idea that  learning-is-acting-White nonsense out of your youngsters. Demanding, <span class="caps">FORCING </span>them to act and think like people instead of filling their brains with the slop dished out by their idols.</p>
<p>I would <span class="caps">LOVE </span>to hear this Doris Ward explain why, given 50-60,000 years ago with all racial groups starting on a basically level playing field   &mdash;   <span class="caps">WHY</span> Blacks amounted to virtually nothing in Africa. While other races were busily learning, developing, building, creating, inventing and exploring. Even the Aztecs, Mayans and Incas   &mdash;   despite their bloody religion   &mdash;   built magnificent stone structures, knew astronomy, some mathematics and developed a rudimentary written language.</p>
<p>Sure Whites look down on Blacks for non-accomplishment. Which is why Blacks are bending over backwards, trying to &#8220;rewrite&#8221; verified history in a misguided effort to obtain undeserved credit for their race.</p>
<p>Had slaves not been forcibly taken from Africa, what, other than incessant tribal warefare could they look to? Except becoming the main course that night? Slavery was bad, surely. But with vew few exceptions, hardly as intolerable as that Doris White would suggest. More to the point: How many Blacks alive today served as slaves and can speak from experience?</p>
<p>Great Scott! Will this endless sniveling and whining By Blacks ever cease? If a fraction of what occasions their incessant crying had genuine validity, they&rsquo;d be making a bee-line for any African nation. With even Whites chipping in to raise the cost of those one-way tickets. The very fact Afro-Americans DO <span class="caps">NOT CARE</span> TO <span class="caps">EMIGRATE</span> TO <span class="caps">THEIR ANCESTRAL HOMELANDS </span>shows just how shallow and empty those claims by Blacks really are. Those silly claims of &#8220;350 years of slavery and opresssion.&#8221; (Let&rsquo;s see&hellip; 2007 - 350 = 1657. Now just <span class="caps">HOW MANY </span>slaves were here in America <span class="caps">BEFORE</span> 1776?)</p>

					<p>  &#8220;I believe in the right of her pastor and anybody else to say the things they want to say. On the other hand, Ms Bullock knows that what her pastor and Rev. Wright are saying are meant to incite black people to violence &#8220;&hellip;.<br>

I agree also with their right to speech.  But these  &#8220;reverends&#8221; and  their radical &#8220;churches&#8221; are engaging in politics,  masquerading as religion.   Their tax exemptions should be revoked. </p>

I am so sick of hearing that whiney plea!  The fact also is that black people do not understand the white experience in America.</p>
<p>They think we were all born with silver spoons in our mouths and have lived lives of ease. They think we all possess in the back yard a secret money tree. They assume that we all live off their labor because, after all, &#8220;they built this country&#8221;.</p>
<p>I saw on <span class="caps">TV, </span>a few years back, the &#8220;celebrated&#8221; poetess Maya Angelou, who had been elevated to almost godlike status during the Clinton regime, opining that white people simply don&rsquo;t understand blacks because whites fail to realize that blacks in America didn&rsquo;t grow up on Park Avenue. </p>
<p>Such colossal ignorance! And posing as wisdom.  Does she imagine that all white people  &#8220;grew up on Park Avenue&#8221;?  Evidentally so. <br>

					<p>Wasn&rsquo;t it the black church Bill Clinton used to run to and hide behind everytime he faced trouble?</p>
<p>Remember traitor Bill Clinton&rsquo;s speech when he proudly croaked to a roaring crowd that whites in America will soon be a minority?</p>
<p>I think it is only fitting for people like the Clintons to feel first hand the sting of what they helped create.  The blacks they propped up now dispise them and seek to displace them.  The Clintons had no problem with a black taking your job white man.  Hillary deserves to lose to a black man.  </p>
<p>Now, if only we can find a Latino to replace McCain&hellip;..  </p>

					<p>Blacks have had 50 to 60 <span class="caps">MILLENIUMS </span>to &#8216;make something&rsquo; of themselves in Africa. Yet accomplished virtually nothing. Zilch! Nada!</p>
<p>Evil White Europeans began carving Central Africa into colonies. Building towns which became cities. After &#8220;indepdenence&#8221; those cities and towns became typical African hellholes. So apparently Africans managed to accomplish &#8220;something&#8221; even if only in a very negative way.</p>
<p>But, as always, incapable of admitting their own shortcomings. So blaming it on White racism. Does anyone truly believe the <span class="caps">MAJORITY</span> Blacks can ever mature to the point of becoming genuine equals of Whites? Reading about these incessant anti-White rantings, I personally doubt it.</p>

					<p>I realize that White citizens have no duty to understand or to care about our struggle, but still, I have to ask:  Why is it that you have a &#8220;get over it&#8221; reaction whenever a Black alludes to slavery, Reconstruction, or Jim Crow, but don&rsquo;t have the same reaction when White citizens wax on about the Civil War or the Holocaust?   </p>
