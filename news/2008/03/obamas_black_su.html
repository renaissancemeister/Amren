						<p>Barack Obama would not be leading the Democratic presidential race without the enthusiasm and high turnout of black voters.</p>
<p>They spearheaded his comeback win in South Carolina, where Obama trounced Hillary Rodham Clinton and John Edwards with the backing of four out of every five black voters. They provided his margin of victory in many other states, and will play a key role in Tuesday&rsquo;s primary in Mississippi, where Clinton is the underdog.</p>
<p>But Obama&rsquo;s campaign saw the limits of black support in last week&rsquo;s losses in Ohio and Texas, which kept Clinton&rsquo;s campaign alive. And the role black voters will play in the next big contest, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s April 22 primary, is unclear.</p>
<p>Moreover, some analysts think it&rsquo;s possible Obama&rsquo;s heavy black support is nudging some working-class white Democrats into Clinton&rsquo;s camp. If true, it could be an important factor in a contest that remains remarkably tight after a year of campaigning.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Clinton won nearly two out of every three white votes in Ohio, and 56 percent of those in Texas, where she also ran well among Latinos. Strategists are pondering the results, wondering if Pennsylvania&rsquo;s demographic similarities to Ohio will deliver another important win to Clinton in six weeks.</p>
<p>Ronald Walters, a University of Maryland political scientist who tracks racial trends and is writing a book on Obama, thinks Obama&rsquo;s strong support from blacks made it easier for some whites in Ohio and Texas to vote for Clinton.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s some of that,&#8221; Walters said in an interview. He pointed to exit polls from Ohio, where 62 percent of all whites lack college degrees and many are anxious about their jobs in a weak economy.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a racially sensitive group,&#8221; he said, referring specifically to whites who earn less than $50,000 a year and did not attend college.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ohio exit polls support Walters&rsquo; view. Eighteen percent of white Ohio voters said race was an important factor in their decision, and of that group, three in four voted for Clinton.</p>
<p>In general elections, which pit Democrats against Republicans, the racial sensitivity of white voters has been pronounced and well-documented for decades. It&rsquo;s a chief cause of the realignment of the South, where blacks remained intensely loyal to the Democratic Party as whites moved to the GOP by the millions.</p>
<p>In the intraparty world of Democratic primaries, however, racial divisions are much less prevalent, and hard to measure. Many white Democrats, especially in the South, tend to be liberal, racially tolerant and usually happy to join blacks in opposing Republicans.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bositis said it was unclear whether Obama&rsquo;s black support is driving some working-class whites into Clinton&rsquo;s corner, but he noted the steep drop in Obama&rsquo;s share of the white vote in Ohio compared to Wisconsin. One possible factor other than race, Bositis said, was Clinton&rsquo;s strong support within the Ohio Democratic establishment, starting with the governor.</p>
<p>One thing is not in doubt: Obama&rsquo;s candidacy and the closeness of the contest are triggering record turnout among black voters. &#8220;In many states, the black vote has doubled,&#8221; Bositis said.</p>
<p>Similar turnout in Philadelphia&rsquo;s black neighborhoods could help Obama next month. But he would have to make deeper inroads into Pennsylvania&rsquo;s white electorate than he did in Ohio if he is to avoid another solid defeat.</p>

			<p>If he wins they&rsquo;ll most likely run Edwards with him to boost White votes. The MSM can&rsquo;t seem to get enough of this guy, and you repeatedly see White women being drawn to him. It seems like everyday I see news footage of White women supporting Obama, it&rsquo;s like the MSM is trying to get all White women away from Hillary and into Obamination&rsquo;s camp. I&rsquo;m getting more nervous by the day, I don&rsquo;t know anybody who supports McCain, including myself, I don&rsquo;t know what the GOP is thinking running him. The Republicans I know aren&rsquo;t going to vote for him, they&rsquo;re just not going to vote. No matter who wins the election the United States is going to loose, at least in my opinion. The Balkanization might start in full gear this year. It seems like everything is wrong right now, and getting worse, the masses of the American sheeple are meandering through life brainwashed by thier cathode ray false prophet, White really is becoming black, as evidenced by the articles about more White women being murdered, at a time when they are supporting Obama with open arms. A wise man once told us that a bad tree couldn&rsquo;t bring forth good fruit, yet daily we see the horrors of the Kenyan tree while eating heartily of its fruit.</p>

			<p>A &#8220;racially sensitive&#8221; group, huh?  I get it, that&rsquo;s code for poor and ignorant, right?<br>
Well, it&rsquo;s we Bubbas who are usually in the trenches with your average black.  We live with the fallout, not the bleedinghearts in the gated communities.<br>
We are acutely aware of the consequences of black leadership.</p>

			<p>What gets me about those who are voting for Obama,(except for the usuall idiotic people who vote party)is that they really must never have read about his background or his wifes. If they did I think his support would come to a screeching halt.</p>

			<p>IMO Barack Obama is unelectable. If anything, whites are becoming more racially aware (albeit slowly)  as more and more black neighborhoods crumble and become inhospitable to anyone but blacks, and the left&rsquo;s rationalizations wear more and more thin. The left knows this is its last gasp, last ditch effort to get a &#8220;black&#8221; presidential candidate. Even now, Obama&rsquo;s facade is beginning to crumble as he refuses to answer media questions and a simple thing like a Saturday Night Live sketch exposes and ridicules the MSM&rsquo;s worshipful attitude towards Obama. As soon as the public demands to know Obama&rsquo;s stand on reparations the whole campaign will collapse. If he&rsquo;s for them, whites will have second thoughts and if he&rsquo;s against them, blacks will call him an &#8220;Oreo&#8221; and drop their support.</p>

			<p>My friend has tried hard to get white women more interested in white people&rsquo;s rights.  She says that she supports equal opportunity for everybody because that is what decent people do, but she thinks that black people are not interested in equal opportunity.  I am inclined to agree because I had classmates who thought that they were just owed a place in medical school or law school because they were black.  They saw no reason to study as hard as white people.  They didn&rsquo;t think other non-white people should get anything black people wanted either.</p>
<p>I asked my friend why white people&rsquo;s groups aren&rsquo;t jumping in and using the Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama campaigns to recruit white women into the white people&rsquo;s movement.  Even my dad says that Hillary Clinton has been treated much harsher by the media than Obama has.  He feels sorry for her even though he has been a republican all of his life.    </p>
<p>My friend looked ready to cry when she answered my question.  She says that there is so much misogyny in the white nationalist movement that there is really no point in trying to get white women interested anymore.  She says that she has tried and failed and actually found some common ground with black women who felt equally disrespected by men in black nationalist movements.  But even she admits that that common ground is vulnerable to earthquakes because right beneath the surface she knows that what she and these black women have in common is the hurt and anger that comes from wanting to support your own and not having that favor returned while all of them still want to be for their own.  She says that it is all very confusing. </p>
<p>She thinks that Barack Obama would be long gone if both he and Hillary Clinton were white males.  So does my dad.  I am not so sure, but I suspect that that is probably true. My mother is deceased.  The rest of my family says that Hillary Clinton or John McCain is okay, just not Barack Obama the closet black Muslim.  </p>

			<p>CofCC.org has already analyzed the situation.</p>
<p>Obama wins in states that are heavily black or hardly black.  HRC wins in states whose black population is close to the national average, and states with a lot of Chicano Hispanics.  As a matter of tendency.  This is why HRC won OH and TX, and why she&rsquo;ll probably win PA.</p>

			<p>The local radio station played a juxtaposed tape of Obummer giving a &#8220;pep rally&#8221; to his acolytes and Adolph Hitler ranting in <i>Triumph Of The Will</i>. </p>
<p>The only difference was the language. The whipping of the crowd into a frenzy was exactly the same. It was the scariest piece of broadcasting I&rsquo;d head since 9-11.<br>

			<p>Interesting fact&hellip;one poll reveals that 25% of Obamas supporters agree that he isnt qualified to be President..but it doesnt matter. Wow. Could substance simply not matter? Could image be everything? The answer is yes&hellip;because vast numbers of Americans confuse TV with reality. And that is what Obama is<br>
a media generated image. He looks, sounds, and gestures like a sit com character from a all black TV series. He is funny, wise cracking, oh so glib&hellip;and above all funny. He has a cute TV family&hellip;funny, adorable,wisecracking too. Whats missing is substance. Just what does Obamas campaign slogan MEAN? &#8220;Change you can Believe In&#8221;  What does that mean? It means what ever you want to believe it means however vague or contradictory that might be. TV is now reality, reality is now TV.</p>

<p>Lets face it. American elections are nothing more than festivals put on by the PR industry for our economic &#8220;elites.&#8221; </p>
<p>But one positive thing has emerged this year, and that&rsquo;s the fact that is has become painfully clear that whites have absolutely no one who represents them. </p>
<p>As Clinton and Obama (and McCain!!!) fly from coast to coast desperately trying to court the &#8220;everyoneandanythingbutthewhite&#8221; vote, I find myself wondering how anyone but a total friggin&rsquo; moron could not see what&rsquo;s going on in this country. </p>

			<p>White working-class Democrats (there are some left?) are not necessarily rejecting Obama for his race  &mdash;   or anything else about the man himself.  </p>
<p>I bet a large part of it is Obama&rsquo;s overeducated hyperventilating white college-kid fans.  McCarthy, McGovern, Anderson, Hart, Gore, Dean, etc, all had &#8216;em, and these wet-behind-the-ears acolytes sent the blue-collar voter to the GOP in November.</p>
<p>That aside, I&rsquo;m rooting for Obama in the spring, though not (of course!) in the fall.  I don&rsquo;t know, or care, which party flushing the Clintons out of politics would help.  But I do know it would help the country.</p>

			<p>Attempts to negate votes in the Michigan and Florida primaries have backfired loudly upon the Dems.  They are now crucial.

<p>There is some evidence that such a fix is already in the works. My wife was a John Edwards supporter until he quit the race. Immediately, she started getting junk mail from the Obama campaign and NOTHING from Clinton. What this tells me is John Edwards (or his campaign staff) provided Obama with the Edwards mailing list and this same list was not provided to Clinton. This seems to suggest Edwards (or his staff) are cooperating with Obama and not cooperating with Clinton. Even though my wife is the archetype Hillary supporter&hellip;..55 year old, white, female, attorney, lifelong Democrat and feminist&hellip;.she has received NO solicitation from the Clinton campaign. Even more strange, she still has some letters of appreciation from Bill Clinton for having helped in his campaigns. Doesn&rsquo;t Bill share his mailing list with Hillary?? (Some of my wife&rsquo;s close friends, include Gary Mouro, who headed the Hillary Clinton campaign in Texas, but she still never made it to the mailing list.) Is there a fix in favor of Obama? Won&rsquo;t the feminists be unhappy when they find out?</p>

			<p>Blacks tend to view Obama as their savior. I suppose they feel a half black as president is better than none. He may appear black outside but you can bet his cognative ability is due to his white half. </p>

			<p>I personally regard Obama a no less despicable liar and phony than I do Hillary Clinton. It is gratifying to me, however, to see Obama outperforming Hillary with respect to winning primaries. I also seriously doubt the feasibility of that oft-touted &#8220;dream ticket.&#8221; The idea of at least four years of the BILLARY-BAMA Administration being simply too disgusting to contemplate.</p>
<p>Were Hillary to win the Presidency, you can bet it would be like the earlier 8-year-BILLARY CLINTON White House. Replete with scandals, and a &#8220;to hell with what the voters/people think or want&#8221; mentality all over again.</p>
<p>Were Obama to win   &mdash;   we&rsquo;d have a Muslim sympathizer at the very least, bent on selling out our interests and security. A man as phony as that &#8220;biography&#8221; of his. Obama is a posturing phony passing himself off as a Black   &mdash;   which despite his racially mixed heritage simply shows you where his loyalties really lie.</p>
<p>Picture Jesse Jackson (that name reminds me of something else   &mdash;  I must thank the Black poster who came up with that phrase), or with Al Sharpton in his cabinet. With the mandatory pledging of one&rsquo;s belief in the slavery myths and outright lies posted by our good friend Reece, to boot.</p>

			<p>For all the outpouring of support of Phony Obama   &mdash;   I doubt he can win the presidency. You need to consider a great many Whites will mouth the p.c. gabble and claim to support him. But comes November and Election Day, they more likely will vote for McCain as the perceived LESSER OF THE TWO EVILS! Call it human nature.</p>
<p>Even were Obama to go along with Lying Hillary as she suggested, on the V.P. slot, it would doom the Dems on two counts: Those scandals of Hillary&rsquo;s   &mdash;   Whitewater, that $1,000 investment paying off $100,000, the hushed up Foster &#8220;suicide&#8221; scandal. Then there&rsquo;s also Hillary&rsquo;s Travelgate mess. Her reputation as a back-stabbing bitch, as well. Alsoinstead of Lewinsky kneeling before Our First Black President, you can picture Obama and his gay friend   &mdash;   that story is making both the tabloids as well as the Internet. &#8220;Say Hillary, dear&hellip; could we sort of borrow the Oval Office for ten minutes?&#8221;</p>

One day, at break time, I heard one of the working class White girls talking to a black boy about the miniseries, Roots. She was talking about Kunte Kinte. Only it was the way she was so careful to pronounce his name correctly  &mdash;  &#8220;Koon-tuh  Kin-teh!&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when I knew it was over, with a little event like that.</p>
<p>We may well get the Obama Obomination.   </p>

			<p>I think we should support white candidates in the same way that other minorities support their own color.  That being said, I will vote for McCain or Hillary but never Obama.  Obama is interested in elevating his own people (Blacks), not Whites.  He has made statements to that effect numerous times and I know that he supports reparations.  For those who think that Obama&rsquo;s victory will force the issue and prepare the country for a real change, you are playing a very dangerous game.  After four years of Obama with his Socialist policies and increased third world immigration, it may be too late to turn the tide back.  The trend is almost irreversible now.  </p>

			<p>Hillary is just as eager to discriminate against white men as Obama is.  And, along with McCain, all are big advocates of illegal immigration.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter who wins now.  We&rsquo;re doomed.</p>
<p>Have you noticed that discussions of how the votes go in elections these days always center around the ethnic and racial make up of the various voting blocks?  How the blacks vote&hellip; how the Latinos vote&hellip;, how the Asians vote&hellip;, and, even, occasionally, how the whites vote.  That keeps every other issue   &mdash;   the war, the economy, the environment, education, etc., off the table.  Instead it becomes, how can we get the black vote?  How can we get the Latino vote?  Diversity destroys democracy.<br>

<p>but whites have let blacks destroy our cities and neighborhoods and we&rsquo;ve not learned from that, except excuse it with the &#8216;well, that&rsquo;s not their fault, it&rsquo;s because of racism and oppression blah blah blah&rsquo;.  Things will get worse (worse than they already are) and there will be no turning back</p>

			<p>My friend has tried hard to get white women more interested in white people&rsquo;s rights. She says that she supports equal opportunity for everybody because that is what decent people do, but she thinks that black people are not interested in equal opportunity. I am inclined to agree because I had classmates who thought that they were just owed a place in medical school or law school because they were black. They saw no reason to study as hard as white people. They didn&rsquo;t think other non-white people should get anything black people wanted either.</p>
<p>I asked my friend why white people&rsquo;s groups aren&rsquo;t jumping in and using the Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama campaigns to recruit white women into the white people&rsquo;s movement. Even my dad says that Hillary Clinton has been treated much harsher by the media than Obama has. He feels sorry for her even though he has been a republican all of his life. </p>
<p>My friend looked ready to cry when she answered my question. She says that there is so much misogyny in the white nationalist movement that there is really no point in trying to get white women interested anymore. She says that she has tried and failed and actually found some common ground with black women who felt equally disrespected by men in black nationalist movements. But even she admits that that common ground is vulnerable to earthquakes because right beneath the surface she knows that what she and these black women have in common is the hurt and anger that comes from wanting to support your own and not having that favor returned while all of them still want to be for their own. She says that it is all very confusing. </p>
<p>She thinks that Barack Obama would be long gone if both he and Hillary Clinton were white males. So does my dad. I am not so sure, but I suspect that that is probably true. My mother is deceased. The rest of my family says that Hillary Clinton or John McCain is okay, just not Barack Obama the closet black Muslim. </p>

<p>Assuming this friend you speak of actually exists or isn&rsquo;t you, she sounds naive. Did she really expect white supremacists to be strong supporters of gender equality?</p>

			<p>My friend is 46 and married for almost as long as I have been alive.  She&rsquo;s just your motherly type.  She is always trying to ruin my diet by feeding me things.  I think that she probably did have that much faith in white men.  She doesn&rsquo;t have the same strong emotions that I do about black people.  She admits that she generally prefers the company of white people.  I will admit that I just don&rsquo;t like being around black people at all.   </p>

<p>Sad to say, your friend is correct. There is far too much misogyny and sexism in the White nationalist Movement.</p>
<p>In fact, the small number of women that post on this website or attend the biannual meetings should demonstrate this fact. </p>
<p>Unless this sexist mindset changes, I do not see the White nationalist movement making any headway in bringing women into the fold.</p>

			<p>People who vote in primaries only represent a small fraction of the voters out there and Obama&rsquo;s support among Whites isn&rsquo;t very strong.  If you look at the returns, Obama only got 1/4 of the White vote in Mississippi.  This is pretty much the pattern in other states as well.  I have to wonder, given the low turnout for Republicans during the primaries, whether alot of them registered as Democrats to vote for Obama to knock Hillary out of the race.  Obama&rsquo;s Presidential ticket will go down in flames faster than the Mondale-Ferraro fiasco of 1984.</p>

<p>HOORAY, HOORAY! Now we can be called &#8220;White supremacists&#8221; if we can reject Lying Hillary OR Phony Obama!</p>
<p>To our unsigned poster   &mdash;   permit me to point out that I neither consider myself a WS (no matter what Blacks might chose to think), but like many people, would hardly care for another four-year BILLARY CLINTON (Bill AND Hillary running the show) Administration. We have had more than enough of both when they left the White House in January, 2001.</p>
<p>Does ANYONE remember those innumerable scandals hanging over Bill or Hillary?  Whitewater, Travelgate, those incedible investment payoffs, the Vince Foster &#8220;suicide.&#8221; Of course there are others also. The stench hanging over the Clinton White House could be likened to an ugly, miasmic pall visible across our entire country.<br>

			<p>There are a lot of factors that disenfranchise white voters:<br>
1.) Time and again judicial fiat is used to keep the polls open later in BLACK areas than white areas, as just happened in the Ohio Clinton/Obama Democrat primary, even though it was white areas that had suffered flooding causing havoc for white voters. (And reminiscent of what happened in Missouri a few years back in a Republican defeat when a judge allowed polls in St Louis black areas to stay open later, and buses were sent out to bring in MORE NEW black voters.) No justification for this, even when there are long lines, since as long as you are IN LINE before the poll closes, you still get to vote, even after the poll closing when no new arrivals are supposed to get in line.<br>
2.) Black areas are so solidly Democrat there is little or no monitoring: Any Republican monitors are physically intimidated and there are shouts of &#8220;racism&#8221; if they try to challenge rampant black voter fraud.<br>
3.) Open caucuses discriminate against working whites who don&rsquo;t have time for that and are intimidated by throngs of ghetto blacks that flood in: You don&rsquo;t have a secret ballot so everyone knows how you are voting. God help a black who doesn&rsquo;t vote for the Democrat, or in this Democrat primary, for Obama.<br>

<p>I agree.  The preference for Asian women over white women on this website is what causes me to second guess my affiliation.  If you feel that Asian women are more desirable than white women, then you ARE NOT a white nationalist OR a white separatist OR whatever you want to call it.  You are just as guilty as the white women who go after black men.  Actually, you are even worse.  You are a traitor.  At least the white women on here who like black men admit that they are NOT part of our movement.  I can&rsquo;t think of any loyal white women on here who DO NOT prefer white men. Sadly I can&rsquo;t say the same about the &#8220;loyal&#8221; white male posters on here.  It seems that more often than not they are too busy defending their preference for Asian women than complimenting and uplifting white women.  </p>
