<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Slavery in America tends to be overlooked in high schools. Of course they acknowledge that slavery existed, but most schools don&rsquo;t go into great detail on the subject. Teachers say something along the lines of &#8220;A lot of Americans owned slaves,&#8221; and then go on to discuss in detail the Industrial Revolution or the Civil War.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until college that I learned that there were slave revolts. I had always assumed that there must have been uprisings but it wasn&rsquo;t until college that I learned that slave revolts were common (though small and ineffective) and the primary reason Lincoln released the slaves was to punish Southerners. I should have entered college knowing that, but unfortunately, slavery doesn&rsquo;t seem to be as high on the teaching agenda as it should be.</p>
<p>Slavery in America lasted about 250 years, the longest period of any type in American history. Nothing else of significance in the U.S. has lasted for 250 years. The country itself is only 231 years old. Slavery lasted longer than our country has existed yet it hasn&rsquo;t even earned a chapter in the history books. In terms of length alone no other event or period even compares, but they all have their own chapters.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The emphasis on black history, especially during February, should also bring attention to the lack of slavery in high school curriculums. Slavery is the single most important period in black history; the Civil Rights Movement is immensely important but doesn&rsquo;t even compare. Slavery in the United States represents the starting point of black history.</p>
<p>Slavery preludes every other achievement in black history and lies at the roots of so much of our contemporary culture. The hymns sung in black churches, especially in the South, stem from when the slaves used to keep their spirits up and give directions to the North. Even the concept of black churches and the very religion itself has its roots in slavery. New slaves weren&rsquo;t Christian as the majority of today&rsquo;s blacks; slavery represents a mass conversion of blacks to Christianity.</p>
<p>The fact that blacks are about 13 percent of the population but 90 percent of college basketball, 80 percent of the NBA and 70 percent of the NFL has its roots buried deep within the act of slavery, according to some sources. John Burton said in his essay &#8220;Slave Breeding Farm,&#8221; that slave owners bred the biggest and strongest slaves like livestock to produce slaves that were more suitable for market, and the smaller, weaker slaves were often castrated.</p>
<p>The important role slavery played in building the United States is also often ignored. In the beginning, the cheap labor slavery provided was like steroids to the budding nation. With the economy of the early U.S. reliant on agriculture, mainly tobacco, producing large quantities of product was essential.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Even if the authors of the high school history books and the creators of the curriculums attempt to ignore the shame of American slavery, we should all know that if the captain of that ship hadn&rsquo;t been running short of food on that day in 1619, the United States almost certainly wouldn&rsquo;t be the world power that it is today. And I don&rsquo;t mean to glorify slavery, but we should give slaves just as big of a &#8220;thank you&#8221; as presidents and war veterans.</p>
<p>Neglecting slavery in schools is a huge injustice especially for those like me who can only trace their heritage back to slavery.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a flat-out lie, &#8220;A LOT&#8221; of Americans were NOT slave owners. In fact, only about 1% probably were. That&rsquo;s it! <br/>

			<p>I guess nobody ever heard about Alex Haley and ROOTS which ws mostly a fraud.How about the movie Amistad which Steven Speilberg tried to insert into Highschool curiculum.THe fact is any treatment of slavery will omit who were really the driveing force behind slavery. It was black west Africans who made huge amounts of money from the slave trade.</p>

<p>Well, there&rsquo;s so much nonsense in this article that it&rsquo;s impossible to address it all, but the one thing that jumped out at me was the above statement. Not only is this a variation of the old &#8220;blacks built America&#8221; theme, but I didn&rsquo;t know that there was a single chance event that led to the adoption of slavery in this country. (I had to go to the original article to learn that slavery in America started when a ship packed with African indentured servants was traded for food in 1619). </p>
<p>No mention of Africans selling each other as slaves to the white man. I wonder why? In fact, if anything needs to be taught about slavery, it is its universality, but then that would undercut Mr. Reece&rsquo;s pretense of blacks being singled out as a race for unkind treatment, wouldn&rsquo;t it? </p>

			<p>No one I knew in school ever ignored the slavery issue. The blacks never LET us ignore it. Never mind their facts are completely wrong, for example, the article above! I even realized that when I was in high school. Besides I think we have given blacks enough &#8220;thank yous&#8221; with the welfare, AA programs, black militant programs, reparations, etc, etc- the list goes on and on. I am of Irish heritage and my ancestors were not treated even a miniscual portion as well as the blacks were back then. Where are the lessons in public schools about MY ancestors? Right! I am not holding my breath either! But my son and daughter both know- and they see for themselves what is going on in the world. Whites need to atop being so passive!!!</p>

			<p>We should NOT be teaching more about slavery in schools, there is already too much taught about it.  Slavery has no bearing on this country now or on the future.  No black now was ever a slave and no White now ever owned a slave.  The blacks need to get over it and quit trying to use slavery to get more and more undeserved concessions from Whites.  I for one feel NO guilt what so ever over slavery and I never will, nor will I apologize for it.  The blacks here now should be grateful their ancestors were brought over here as slaves because otherwise they&rsquo;d be in Africa.  Have you seen Africa now?  You blacks should be THANKING us.</p>

			<p>I was trying to house train my dog and I assumed that rubbing the dogs nose in his mess would teach him not to mess in the house. A veterinarian told me that rubbing a dogs in his own poo poo will not teach him anything but to not rub his own nose in his own poo poo. <br/>
Those among us who have not learned their lesson and still rub their noses in the poo poo are responsible for most of this mess. The blacks who happily continue to rub our noses in the mess should be thankful to our self loathing brethren for their assistance.</p>

			<p> What rock has this idiot been hiding under? If he thinks today&rsquo;s school textbooks mention slavery &#8220;only in passing,&#8221; he sure as hell hasn&rsquo;t examined any of them.<br/>
 <br/>
 He also talks about the vast overrepresentation of blacks in professional sports. He attributes this to Whites raising slaves to be big and strong. He should have also mentioned the vast overrepresentation of blacks in prisons, on welfare rolls, and among high school dropouts. If they were bred to be big and strong, the result also seems to have been to select for stupidity, brutality and irresponsibility. </p>

<p>Come again Comrade Reece, didn&rsquo;t Jimmy the Greek get his stick and stones handed to him by your fellow travelers, over such remarks in the 1980s?</p>
<p>While there is much to debunk here, I am going to focus on this remark by Comrade Reece; this would be because, that it does omit one important point. While the &ldquo;biggest and strongest slaves&rdquo; were possibly bred &ldquo;like livestock&rdquo; for the marketplace, were not also the stupidest likely selected as well? One need not be capable of producing the works of Shakespeare while picking cotton or hoeing the rows; so were not the qualifications of: big, strong, and near idiotic considered in the equation?</p>
<p>Come on, American and British slavers are the most evil entities in history according to the Comrade Reeces of the world, so logically such a triumvirate of traits were considered. Just like the way, current &ldquo;Eurocentric&rdquo; academic focuses are what enhance black &ldquo;marginalization&rdquo; in the socioeconomics of this country, right along with the &ldquo;legacy of slavery.&rdquo;   </p>
<p>Hence, the overall impeccably indomitable &ldquo;quality&rdquo; and intellectual &ldquo;fortitude&rdquo; of most NBA and NFL champions, that allows them to master not only their respective games, but also: science, industry, and  of course all manner of the social graces?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

			<p>Slavery was an abomination.  Having acknowledged that, I should point out that black Americans should get down on their knees every day and give thanks to the God that made them that their long-suffering ancestors found themselves on a slave ship bound for the North American colonies rather than living out their miserable primitive lives in Africa.</p>
<p>Those who disagree should be offered first class one-way airfare to the African nation of their choice.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Slavery in America tends to be overlooked in high schools&#8221;.</p>
<p>As soon as this boob started with that sentence I knew it&rsquo;d be &#8216;Katie bar the door&rsquo;.  Here&rsquo;s what I taught high school freshmen in reference to Reece&rsquo;s query:</p>
<p>1) Slavery has existed since the start of time.  Doesn&rsquo;t make it right, of course.<br/>
2) West Africans sold their defeated countrymen into slavery. <br/>
3) The great majority of African slaves were taken by Arabs.<br/>
4) Only 4% of all African slaves were brought to North America.<br/>
5) The halcyon days of slavery were when this land was under British rule.<br/>
6) Less than 20 years into the American republic&rsquo;s life the importation of slavery was stopped.<br/>
7) The average slave in America had a longer lifespan than the peasant ancestors of White Americans.<br/>
8) 500,000 people - largely White males - died in the fight that ended slavery.<br/>
9) Slavery in America was abolished before most other major countries of the world got rid of serfdom or slavery.<br/>
10) Christianity was the driving force behind ending slavery in Western Civilization.  Islam continued to promote slavery into the 1960&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s that, Reece?  You&rsquo;ve got a quiz on this Monday morning.</p>

			<p>Slavery took place in non White countries long before Whites even contemplated taking part in the slave trade. Though, are Arabs forced to teach their children about the evils of slavery? How about Indians? No of course not! Those guilt trips are completely ineffective. Slavery also took part in South, and Central America, but Blacks there do not ramble on about it. American Blacks like to close their eyes and ears to the fact slavery has taken place allover the world, and in some cases, still does. There are Blacks, as well as Arabs who hold black slaves in Sudan. But they do not like to discuss this matter, because they want slavery to be strictly a White mans evil, especially an American white mans evil. Of course, if we didn&rsquo;t bow our heads in shame, when they try to force White guilt on us, they probably wouldn&rsquo;t bother, just as they don&rsquo;t in most countries where they know it will not work.</p>

			<p>This Robert Reece is a real brain trust. Did anyone go to the site that hosts the so-called essay &#8220;Slave Breeding Farm&#8221;? It&rsquo;s Eunuch.org, a web site that caters to fantasies of castration. It&rsquo;s all obviously pornographic fiction, and this guy&rsquo;s taking it for real. Maybe they were bred for gullibility too&hellip;</p>

<p>American Indians owned black slaves too. I&rsquo;m waiting for that bit of consciousness raising to be given equally important emphasis in school too. </p>

			<p>&ldquo;Slavery in America tends to be overlooked in high schools.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After foaming at the mouth and nearly OD on attacking the whites for their racism, the black leaders and wannabe leaders get their second wind and starts in on the other cause of black failure: lack of education.  Education or more correctly going to school, is the cure all for all black woes.</p>
<p>There aren&rsquo;t three blacks in America who don&rsquo;t think that going to school will miraculously make his fellow black a success, or having gone to school wouldn&rsquo;t have turned that tattoo three time loser into a Baca Bama.  And by going to school they mean just showing up in school; you don&rsquo;t have to study or work hard or anything like that.   Learning is the easy part.</p>
<p>This explains why Reese doesn&rsquo;t know that slavery in bad old white America is sold in school more often than MacDonald&rsquo;s is on TV.  He just showed up.   If anything is overlooked in America&rsquo;s schools it&rsquo;s the evils of forced diversity and the color of crime.  <br/>

			<p>Just want to point out that blacks also owned slaves right up to the end of the Civil War some 500 hundred slaves in one state in the state of South Carolina were owned by blacks and were used and abused and treated every way slaves were treated during that time. This is in just one state alone I am sure if this was investigated that they would find more slaves in different states that were owned by blacks. Now if this would be included in the history of slavery people would have a better picture of what went on at that time.   </p>

			<p>Good grief! We are already inundated with black history stuff. And that&rsquo;s not enough???   What will ever be enough?</p>
<p>I have some good friends who are Lithuanian (by descent). I wonder why they don&rsquo;t demand more Lithuanian history and awareness in the schools. It seems to me that they are grossly neclected.  And by the same token, so should everyone else. I haven&rsquo;t heard of Hungarian or Polish history being taught either. Why not?   Why only for blacks?  This is discrimination! As much as you give them, they want more and more.</p>

			<p>First, they jerk down the Confederate Battle Flag. Now this! Ole Miss Alumni could have stopped this long ago with one simple act of defiance. Make a call for all loyal Ole Miss fans to stay away from the football stadium en mass at home games and never go back until the flag and the customs were returned and a signed &#8216;Hands Off&rsquo; guarantee from the U of M President never to interfere with Southern customs again was obtained! A good start would have been to demand Tommy Tuberville&rsquo;s immediate resignation as Head Football Coach after he made anti-Confederate statements defiling the Confederate Battle Flag at the behest of salving the feelings of &#8220;his black players.&#8221; Because Mississippi fans and alumni did nothing effective to thwart these anti-Southern outrages Ole Miss is now a laughing stock of its former glory.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m all for ending slavery.  But I have to condemn our black brothers and sisters for their part in advancing the institution of slavery right here in America, not hundreds of years ago, but today.</p>
<p>The government forces Americans to work for it without compensation for often over half the year, some poor white people have been enslaved by the government in this manner for over half their lifetime.  But black leaders, far from opposing this slavery of these white people, have encourage it and actually want to increase it with even higher taxes.   </p>
<p>How can white people take seriously the black complaints about slavery, which ended over a hundred years ago, when they side with today&rsquo;s slave master in exploiting white people?<br/>

Slavery needs to be taught as the absolute worse possible eco system that was pepetuated  by the elites conned by the neocon slave traders who schemed a long range plan to use these Africans as their tool in order to supercede and conquer the European white males and take over all control.<br/>
What better way to conquer the dominating force and owner of western civilization that to use tricks to subdue him? Even in battle the smarter knows its not brute force but the wisest trickest snake moves to outflank or outmaneuver the opponent. Gee whiz even David beat Goliath or so they say.</p>

			<p>  The writer fails to realize the United States began in the 1770&rsquo;s as we won our independence from England, and the southern regions were purchased from France later on; and the US ceased slavery through the bloodiest war in our history in the 1860&rsquo;s.  <br/>
  My arithmatic may be incorrect, but it seems we had allowed slavery in areas of our country for approx. 90 years, not 250.<br/>

			<p>The real issue here is how blacks live in the past.  They&rsquo;ve been given handouts and preferences for decades now, and they&rsquo;ve made a mess of them.  The only trump card they believe they have is to bring up ancestral suffering. All they need are enablers and they get them in public education and in government at all levels.  </p>
<p>Like an alcoholic or drug addict, blacks have a love affair with pain.  And like adolescents, they constantly whine over ever slight, real or imagined, in their daily lives instead of chalking these experiences up to &#8220;life&#8221;.  This is the primary reason they are always behind in every aspect of life.</p>

Lenin&rsquo;s phrase &#8220;useful idiots&#8221; describes Mr.Reese whose indoctrination is soley meant as an attack on White, Christian America.<br/>
 Mao&rsquo;s cultural revolution was driven by the indoctrination of the young who then were the weapons used to kill or &#8220;re-educate&#8221; millions. A Balkanization of the US is not a fantasy and to the many Left-wing extremists in academia is the goal.</p>

			<p>Oh Dear. The nightmarish picture of horror, the endless White guilt Mr. Reece tries to evoke.</p>
<p>Talk about a collection of outright lies, half-truths, deliberate deception and lies by omission.</p>
<p>That (ghastly) slave breeding farm. Guess it never occurred to Reece that a breeding farm (as he would have us to believe) would simply be a few dozen black females and three or four large Black males to service them. At to castrating &#8220;smaller, weaker slaves&#8221;   &mdash;   I doubt Mr. Reece thought of the corrollary   &mdash;   that weaker slaves would either die from such mistreatment or worse, be rendered unfit for virtually ANY kind of manual labor. </p>
<p>Mr. Reece, here&rsquo;s an eye-opener for you. Slaves were considered livestock   &mdash;   like fine oxen and cattle, like prize horses. As such, slaves were a considerable monetary investment. Particularly trained and skilled slaves. So why would even the simplest, most brutish owner risk damaging his livestock, thus rendering them useless, valueless. A slave incapable of work being but a useless mouth to feed. cattle at least could be eaten, if ruined by mistreatment or overwork. Horses fed to slaves.</p>
<p>But WHY throw cold water on Mr. Reece&rsquo;s fanciful tales. I am confident Mr. Reece can produce reams of DNA evidence proving inarguably that two thirds of American Blacks are closely related due to those &#8220;breeding farms.&#8221; So please, Mr. Reece, SHOW US YOUR PROOF!</p>
<p>The Nothern states divested themselves of slaves quite early   &mdash;   i.e., LONG BEFORE THE CIVIL WAR! Which also flies in the face of Reece&rsquo;s claims. Thus belying Reece&rsquo;s vast agricultural economy depending on slave labor. Don&rsquo;t forget, before the Civil War, most agricultural products were produced and consumed locally. Train transportation was NOT what it was a decade or two after the war. Nor was tobacco the vast industry it was from 1900 to 1960. But this is just another inconvenient truth we should not think about. (Try reading some of the many fine books on railoading in the 19th Century   &mdash;   you&rsquo;ll see what I mean.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who Reece is, but assume he&rsquo;s Black. With a vested interest in peddling his line of trash history. Most slaves generally were treated reasonably well. As I pointed out, they surely represented a valuable cash investment to the owners. I concede that while you might have the occasional harsh master, most people treated their chattel quite decently. Even to the point of rewarding good work with better quality food, clothing. with cash gifts, even to the extent of masters freeding their slaves in their wills. Funny how that never occurred to Reece.</p>
<p>Seriously, Mr. Reece, WHY would any sane slave-owner care to have his valuable chattel rendered useless with brutal mistreatment, or even pining for family members sold &#8220;down the river?&#8221; I suggest Mr. Reece should stop reading abolitionist propaganda and read REAL history   &mdash;   before penning nonsense like this fairy tale.</p>

FedUp</i><br/>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br/>
I doubt VERY MUCH that such a &#8220;breeding farm&#8221; ever existed.  WHERE?   That sounds like some dreamer&rsquo;s sheer fantasy.   And if such a place did exist, it would have been the rare, isolated exception.   Christian southerners would not have tolerated it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe the story for a moment. Give us the name and place of that farm! Give us some documentation, not vague allegations!   He can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Another point: slaves did not all have to be big and strong. That&rsquo;s nonsense too. (How many big and strong blacks do you see today? Only a few, really. Most are pretty unremarkable.) Slaves were also trained to be carpenters, gardeners, cooks, taylors, even musicians and bookkeepers, etc. Strength wasn&rsquo;t the only asset looked for.</p>
<p>As FedUp, says, slaves represented a very large capital investment.   An owner was going to take  care of that investment, not abuse it. Some years ago, I was browsing through a book on slavery in a bookstore. It gave the value of a healthy mature slave in terms of modern money.  I don&rsquo;t remember exactly, but it was very high   &mdash;   I believe in the vicinity of $200,000. It would be even more today.  [If anyone can correct me, please do.]  That means that a slave was the equivalent of a piece of very expensive machinery such as a modern harvesting machine. It also meant that only a wealthy person could afford to own a slave   &mdash;   much have many of them. It also  meant that the owner was going to protect his valuable investment and take good care of it.  For dangerous jobs he would have hired a white immigrant who was paid by the day and who had no Worker&rsquo;s Comp, sick days, vacation time, overtime, or Social Security, rather than risk injury to a valuable slave.</p>

I went there, and you are right. (I wouldn&rsquo;t advise anybody to bother.)  It is what one might charitably call erotic fiction   &mdash;    for the VERY gullible. This confirms my suspiction that these allegations are all nonsense and fiction.  There wasn&rsquo;t a word there, that I could find, about American history or slavery or any sort of historical fact.  It&rsquo;s sheer pornographic fantasy for warped minds.  For this guy to read this crazy stuff and then write an article about  breeding farms and castration in the American South shows that he&rsquo;s in outer space somewhere.  His bizarre castration fantasies have nothing to do with reality.  And he presents his lurid daydreams  as historical fact!   (And the Univ. of Mississippi even publishes the nonsense!)</p>
<p>A further thought:  Sending this person to college is a waste of space, if this is the kind of stuff he&rsquo;s &#8220;studying&#8221; there.  Better to put him to work doing something simple that he can handle.</p>

			<p>There were field hands and house boys, the former having the physical traits to do the work.  My ancestors owned a plantation near Kileen, Texas and, according to my late father, had slaves who were well treated.  You don&rsquo;t spend a lot of money on a piece of property and then abuse it. My great, great aunt was a pioneer woman who ran the show after her husband was killed in the unCivil War.  When the slaves were freed, they stayed and were paid to do the work.  Until the day they decided to have dinner at the &#8220;Master&rsquo;s&#8221; table.  My aunt halted them at the kitchen door with her husband&rsquo;s shotgun.<br/>

			<p>The only reason to continue on with this slavery issue is to keep the hatred going that blacks have for whites, and to keep the guilt trip going that whites have for themselves so they don&rsquo;t fight back.  This is why stories like &#8220;The Jasper Texas pickup truck dragging&#8221; get Nationwide News on every talk show and newspaper and magazine 24/7 for years, and stories that are even more horrendous like &#8220;The Christian Newsome Murders&#8221; and &#8220;The Wichita Massacre&#8221; get absolutely 0 coverage.  The MSM leftist propaganda machine doesn&rsquo;t want whites knowing about the real truth, and the real truth is that it&rsquo;s whites that are the ones being discriminated against on a daily basis, it&rsquo;s whites that have half their pay-checks stolen every week to pay for give away programs to blacks and other minorities, it&rsquo;s whites that are getting brutally raped, robed and murdered every day. Just pick up a newspaper!  Today police picked up a black thug that shot a beautiful college student who had a great career going for her. This happens every day and I&rsquo;m surprised this was even mentioned.  Whites better WAKE UP! if a certain person gets elected this year as President of the U.S.A. you are about to see the above situation get 1000 times worse.        </p>

			<p> <i>&#8220;90 percent of college basketball, 80 percent of the NBA and 70 percent of the NFL has its roots buried deep within the act of slavery, according to some sources. John Burton said in his essay &ldquo;Slave Breeding Farm,&rdquo; that slave owners bred the biggest and strongest slaves like livestock to produce slaves that were more suitable for market, and the smaller, weaker slaves were often castrated.&rdquo; </i></p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s the case (and I don&rsquo;t believe for a second that it is, but just to grant the benefit of the doubt), then all those black sports millionaires have a lot to be grateful for to those &#8220;breeding farms&#8221;, don&rsquo;t they?  </p>

			<p>Everybody!  (especially our Black posters):  you should read the book entitled WHITE GOLD. The Extraordinary Story of Thomas Pellow and Islam&rsquo;s One Million White Slaves. by Giles Milton (available on Amazon for $7.50-I just checked) The title is self-explanatory; and in comparison with what the Moslems did to Whites, (AND Blacks), the white Christian slave-traders were a rather benign lot..   A second book needs to be written about the Moslem slave trade in Blacks, which continues to this day<br/>

			<p>The movie &#8220;Amistad&#8221; is loosely based on the exploits of &#8220;Cinque&#8221; who was part of a slave uprising.  The movie conveniently does not mention that after gaining his freedom, Cinque made trips back to Africa as a very successful slave trader.</p>

			<p>To Doug,</p>
<p>You were one of tens of thousands of our children (at the time) who was abused by blacks and by the white &#8220;Bolhshevik&#8221; type oppressors who done nothing.  The black and &#8220;Bolshevik&#8221; white oppressors are still out there.  We need to march for our Civil and Human Rights.  I&rsquo;d like to organize a convoy up and down I-75 to raise awareness to what is happening.  I&rsquo;d like to have a &#8220;million car march&#8221;.  I believe I can turn the nation upside down.  Who out there is with me?  I&rsquo;m going to organize massive non-violent &#8220;marches&#8221; until the black and white &#8220;Bolshevik&#8221; types respect our Civil and Human Rights.  No ands, ifs, or buts.  I&rsquo;ll ask the racist black leaders to join me.  We&rsquo;ll flush out who is for peace and who isn&rsquo;t.  I am.  All I want to know is if I organize it, who is with me?</p>

			<p>&#8221;  It also meant that only a wealthy person could afford to own a slave  &mdash;  much less many of them. It also meant that the owner was going to protect his valuable investment and take good care of it. For dangerous jobs he would have hired a white immigrant who was paid by the day and who had no Worker&rsquo;s Comp, sick days, vacation time, overtime, or Social Security, rather than risk injury to a valuable slave.&#8221;<br/>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -<br/>
Blacks love to whine, but  the reality was that white industrial workers  had it much worse than black slaves.  Those white workers toiled  in dark and dangerous mines and factories and in hazardous jobs where a valuable slave would not have been risked. Those white workers had no one to look after them, feed them, house them, or provide for them when they were sick or old.   In times of economic recession they were out of work.  They had to fend for themselves, while blacks continued to be fed.  They were entirely on their own.<br/>
 <br/>
Blacks don&rsquo;t like to hear that. </p>
<p>Slavery was a failing system and was bound to end  (as many here have pointed out)  because the new industrial system that was coming into being was a more efficient way of squeezing work out of people with minimal cost or responsibility to  the owners  in return.</p>
<p>You could make a slave work, but you couldn&rsquo;t make him work hard or work fast   &mdash;   not unless you watched him every minute.  But in industrial piece work, if a worker got a bonus for producing 200 widgets per hour, that was going to make him work like a devil to make his quota.   And if he got nothing for a day off, he was not going to take a day off.   Slavery was doomed, not because it was inhumane, but because it was inefficient.  It&rsquo;s no accident that slavery, in existence for thousands of years and hitherto unquestioned, even by religious figures and philosophers, only began to be phased out when machinery came into use.   Slavery was really  more humane, compared to what early white workers endured in the Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p>Also, happy people produce more. Angry people produce less. That&rsquo;s elementary.  It was in the plantation owner&rsquo;s interest to have happy families and he would not have broken them up if it could be avoided. Neither would he abuse his slaves    &mdash;   Hollywood fantasies  to the contrary!  That would be counter-productive, and not in his interest.  Nobody mistreats his horses or cattle for fun why would a master mistreat his slaves?  And by the way, the word &#8220;master&#8221;  was not limited to slaves alone.  It came from Europe, where anybody who worked for another was working for a master. It was not demeaning and Europeans lived with it for many centuries.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Not enough whites know that hundreds of thousands of their own people soaked the battlefields red with their own blood to bring slavery to an end.&#8221;</p>
<p>I keep seeing comments like this. The War Between The States was NOT fought to end slavery. The south seceeded because they didn&rsquo;t want to be subjected to the system of northern mercantilism which Lincoln represented. Lincoln invaded to force them back into the union. Slavery was a marginal issue at best.</p>

			<p>I think they should show Roots in high schools. White men &#8216;capturing&rsquo; blacks with nets, like they were animals. Where did Haley DREAM this up? It was much easiser to PURCHES slaves from one of a few major slave ports. The decendants of BLACK SLAVE TRADERS are actually proud of their history, as they saved the lives of many defeated black warriors. Instead of killing them, they were now SOLD to the slave traders. Slavery saved alot of African lives. Is that taught in high school?</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;it wasn&rsquo;t until college that I learned that slave revolts were&hellip;.&#8221; <br/>
&#8220;&hellip;.that slave owners bred the biggest and strongest slaves like livestock to produce slaves that were more suitable for market, and the smaller, weaker slaves were often castrated&hellip;..&#8221;<br/>
&ldquo;…the United States almost certainly wouldn&rsquo;t be the world power that it is today. And I don&rsquo;t mean to glorify slavery, but we should give slaves just…&rdquo;</p>
<p>If this is what is being taught in college, then what is being taught is LIES and MYTHS. The only thing worse than being uninformed is being MISinformed. If this is the kind of propagandistic lies being taught, then tuition cost is money worse than wasted.  <br/>
Slave revolts were NOT &#8220;common&#8221;, but exceedingly rare. <br/>
Slaves were NOT subjected to selective &#8220;breeding&#8221; with &#8220;undesirables&#8221; castrated. (This is the ignorant bar-room MYTH that got Jimmy the Greek fired you&rsquo;ll remember.)</p>
<p>At the time of the Civil War, blacks were only 14% of the population. Even in the South, there were more whites working the fields than blacks (95% of Southerners were poor dirt farmers who owned NO slaves). And of course, the Northerners, the bulk of the U.S. population, living where there were no slaves, weren&rsquo;t exactly sitting on their butts either. Yet these idiots would have you believe that this country was &#8220;built on the backs of slaves&#8221;! 14% of the population? Everyone else supposedly doing nothing but sitting back while 14% of the population did everything. Whatever was contributed by slaves was WIPED OUT, and many times over, by the Civil War WHICH LAID WASTE TO THE SOUTH. Hundreds of thousands of young white men from the North died, the ultimate sacrifice, and many more maimed and mutilated in the bloodiest war this country ever fought. And in any case, the country only had 30 million people at that time, 1/10 of today&rsquo;s population, and a miniscule portion of the economic production of today. SLAVERY THAT ENDED 140 YEARS AGO HAS NO RESIDUAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE US WEALTH TODAY. If anything, it COST and did irreparable damage.</p>
<p>Here is the TRUTH they need to be teaching about slavery in the schools, rather than the racist hate propaganda against whites that passes for &#8220;education&#8221; today:<br/>
The Atlantic slave trade was BEFORE the colonial era, when Europeans dared not go inland into Africa because of lack of immunity to a host of tropical diseases, and also due to powerful black tribal kingdoms that the Europeans were in no position to challenge. That is, at that time, continental sub-Sahara-Africa was COMPLETELY controlled by black African chieftains. There was already in existence a thriving black African slave trade (and incessant inter-tribal warfare) that had been going on for ages before the first European ship showed up off the coast of Africa. The Africans wanted the metal and cloth goods the Europeans brought. So they traded the only thing they had and which they had always traded with: Black slaves from rival tribes. The black Africans brought these slaves in small boats out to the European ships. Later in the slave trade, slave trading posts were established on the coast AT THE BEHEST OF THE BLACK AFRICAN SLAVE TRADING CHIEFTAINS. But Europeans were never in the position to control ANYTHING that went on in the inland of Africa during the Atlantic slave trade: THAT was under black African control.<br/>

<p>I guess you never heard of John Brown. Or the innumerable other White Abolitionists who died in Bleeding Kansas and elsewhere fighting pro-slavers. No, to you white-hating racists, whites would never do ANYTHING for ANY reason except some SELFISH reason.<br/>
The fact of the matter is that if there had not been slavery there would not have been the Civil war. The South seceded because the Abolitionist party (the Republican party) had come to power under Lincoln and they were going to fight for more and more restrictions on slavery (such as it spreading to new territories and states in the West). So the South seceded because of Northern whites&rsquo; increasing intolerance for the institution of slavery.<br/>
If all the North wanted to do was keep the country united (as black racists like to say), all they had to do was do the South&rsquo;s bidding as regards Slavery. So the Civil War was NOT &#8220;to preserve the union&#8221;. That could have been done without a war. And, in any case, it would have been no skin off the Northern whites to just have let the South secede. (At the time the North&rsquo;s population was only 1% black, all free. As it would be today if the Northern whites had just let the South secede: Think of it, all the big urban Northern cities would today have no black population. Even Detroit.) There was something else driving the Civil War: The white Abolitionists in the North and their intolerance of the unabated continuation and spread of Southern slavery.</p>
<p>You people who like to pretend the Civil War had nothing to do with slavery need to review the Lincoln-Douglas debates. What ever other issues you want to pretend were the &#8220;real&#8221; cause of the Civil War, existed long before the abolitionist party (Republicans) won the presidency. So why didn&rsquo;t the South secede many decades before? Why was the election of Lincoln the catalyst? The only thing Lincoln intended to do different was tightening the restrictions on SLAVERY. He didn&rsquo;t want to have a war over it. But the increasing restrictions on slavery he promised (e.g. spread of slavery to the territories, refusal to return slaves that escaped to the North, etc.) where what inspired the South to finally secede. NOTHING ELSE. There was nothing else &#8220;new&#8221; in the Lincoln election. Slavery was THE topic in the Lincoln election. Had there not been slavery in the South THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO CIVIL WAR. <br/>
That is why there were anti-black riots in the North (e.g. New York City) by Northern whites who didn&rsquo;t want to go to war over slavery. That is why there were many Southern whites who resented having to go to war just so the wealthiest whites could continue to keep slaves for all time (only 5% of Southern whites had slaves). THAT WAS THE ONLY DAMN ISSUE. SLAVERY. JUST LOOK AT THE PAPERS OF THE TIME. THAT&rsquo;S ALL THAT WAS TALKED ABOUT.<br/>
The argument here has been whether the cause of the Civil War was slavery. Not about how willingly many whites in the North (or South) went to war once the decision was made by those in power. And yes, there were many ardent abolitionist whites who DID willingly put their lives on the line to fight other whites for the purpose of terminating slavery, that they found abhorrent: The proof that there were MANY such whites can be seen BEFORE the Civil War (and the draft) began, when many thousands of free-state whites VOLUNTARILY flooded Kansas and fought bloody battles with pro-slavery forces. All to insure Kansas came into the Union as a free state and so it&rsquo;s representation in congress would not end up throwing the balance of power to the pro-slavery side.<br/>

			<p>      Quite right Jay. The whole village of Baltimore, Ireland<br/>
was taken by Muslim slavers. Sometimes the people along the coast<br/>
could here them chanting off away in the fog. As far as conditions-in Guinea, the English used to threaten their slaves<br/>
by telling them they&rsquo;d sell to a Dutchman. And the Dutch used to<br/>
threaten to sell their slaves to a free Black.</p>

<p>Sure, I&rsquo;ve heard of them. John Brown was a psychopathic killer. The abolitionists (like the Lawrence hive) were a pack of fanatics widely disliked on both sides. I know all about the guerrilla war on the Kansas-Missouri border. Quantrill is one of my heroes and reducing him to a &#8220;pro-slaver&#8221; is a grotesque over-simplification and distortion of history. The abolitionist movement was a factor in the run-up to the war, but it was a marginal factor at best, just like the whole slavery issue. Tariffs were a lot more important. The south seceded primarily because they didn&rsquo;t want to be subjected to the domination of the northern industrial system  &mdash;  the mercantilist system, aka &#8220;The American System.&#8221; See &#8220;The Real Lincoln&#8221; for details. Calling me a &#8220;white-hating racist&#8221; for pointing out historical facts is ridiculous.</p>

			<p>I never owned a slave. I have never seen or talked to a black man or woman that was a slave. What is sad is that after all these years many blacks want to concentrate of using slavery as an issue. Blacks themselves have not been or seen a slave. There have been slaves other than just black. Irish, Italian, and Chinese (to name a few) have all been slaves at some point in time. But rather than look back, they look ahead. That could explain why there are not more of them in prison. Blacks need to move forward rather than think about how to use the race card in 1000 years.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see how it makes me a &#8220;white-hating racist&#8221; to say that the war wasn&rsquo;t fought over slavery. It wasn&rsquo;t. Slavery was obviously one of the precipitating issues, but there were a lot of reasons for the secession. Lincoln invaded the south to force them back into the union, not to end slavery. The south resisted in order to maintain their independence, not to keep their slaves. As for John Brown and the abolitionists and the border war, I know all about them. I&rsquo;m a fan of Quantrill. Reducing him to a &#8220;pro-slaver&#8221; is a simplistic distortion.</p>

			<p>The entire fuss about &#8220;teaching the history&#8221; of slavery is that the nut cases want to forcibly teach a distorted version. Liek African History, for an example. To support and feed their never-ending victimhood mentality inculcated in Blacks by White liberals. Afro-American Reece being no exception to this school of thought. So you start with that abolitionist joke-book, Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin, and go downward from there. Haunting the sado-masochist websites where Reece dredged up his fiction. Trying to elicit sympathy from or instill more needless guilt in Whites with his alternate history rantings.</p>
<p>The &#8216;pore ole me, I&rsquo;s born Black&rsquo; whiners typefied by Robert Reece nevertheless keep crawling out of their dark corners and from under rocks. Never resting till the McCarthism mentality of a half-century earlier is turned to a new direction. FORCING every White Man, Woman and Child to swear a blood oath, damning racist thinking and solemnly claiming to believe the claptrap garbage in the above story. Isn&rsquo;t that your ultimate goal, Mr. Reece? I doubt you have the intellectual ability to understand my parallel with McCarthyism, so permit me to enlighten you.</p>
<p>Senator Joseph McCarthy was a rapid anti-communist trying to force virtually everyone in America to swear to being anti-communist. Not, of course, that all that many Americans were communists or communist sympathizers   &mdash;   this being early in the cold war years. But it is not very hard to compare your warped thinking with that of Joseph McCarthy. As I pointed out in my original response to you: A LIE REPEATED OFTEN ENOUGH BECOMES THE TRUTH! Propaganda Miniser Goebbels would have loved you dearly.</p>

			<p>I agree with this author in general.  All the details of slavery should be explained starting with how ruthless tribes of Africans enslaved others of their own race and sold them to the European whites.  Even more so they should explain how the Moslems exploited Africans.  Moslems were taking slaves at least clear down to a couple of decades ago, if indeed they&rsquo;ve ever ceased.  They&rsquo;re probably still using slaves but hiding it from the West.<br/>
There should also be teachings on who and how many owned slaves.  I believe that there were alot of poor whites who not only didn&rsquo;t have slaves, but were also kept in poverty and exploited by the same exploiters who owned the plantations and fancied themselves as the &#8220;aristocracy&#8221; of the South.  It&rsquo;s all about the exploiters vs the exploited regardless of races.  Some of my ancestors were slave owners, and had plantations.</p>

			<p>Tens of millions of middle class whites are slaves today to the black african racist people and their Bolshevik white sidekicks.  How?  Literally trillions of dollars have been dished out of the white middle class pockets (white people who worked hard and played by the rules) and put into black non-workers, non-producer pockets. All this done by white shysters who benefitted and made money from the transfer themselves.</p>

<p>To 10:39 poster,</p>
<p>Most Northerners did not like blacks either and when Lincoln made slavery an issue later in the war did the whites in NYC riot and Lincoln had to institute the draft. Lincoln&rsquo;s purpose in making slavery an issue later in the war was to cause the slaves to revolt and turn on their people. If slavery was so bad, why did that not happen? Slaves had the perfect opportunity to kill the families of their masters and they did not.</p>

			<p>While I agree with FedUp&rsquo;s general argument, I think it&rsquo;s regrettable that he brought Sen McCarthy into this.  McCarthy was not a rabid fanatic or a nut.   Only  those on the extreme left continue today to denounce him as a some kind of monster; and in fact history has by now shown him to have been right all along.</p>
<p>FedUp, please leave McCarthy out of this.  If he were still alive, he&rsquo;d probably be among those posting on Amren, right along  with you.</p>

<p>I meant NO disrespect to Senator McCarthy. The parallel&hellip; McCarthy demanding affirmation of loyalty being much like what this Reece joker wants&hellip; Except Reece wants affirmation from us that we BELIEVE the slavery myths and garbage he and his ilk spout incessantly at us.</p>

			<p> Solomon Humphries! I read that name a long time ago in a book about black history, which included storys about black slavery. He was a black slave owner who owned a hundred black slaves. Now students of history have you ever heard of the slavic race. A whole group of white people who are in a sense named slave. Look up the slavic peoples and you find the greeks used to cross the black sea to get their slaves so the people became known as slavs (slaves). All this strife about slavery and there are still slaves in this world.(as was pointed out). A lot of people in capitalism call themselves wage slaves, which is essentially what we were as there was no way to gain any wealth under this system. If you would make more money you would be taxed more in order to keep this failed experiment called America going.</p>

			<p>If you are brought up in a mostly white school in the south, the point gets hammered home in the state history and American history classes.  With that said, not everything is told to white southerners, like: how many white slaves there were; how small the minority of slave owners really was; how much of that slave holding minority was Native American and Black; and how African chieftains did some, if not most, of the black slave trading before the  ships left the African shore.</p>
<p>Also, I was led to believe the Industrial Revolution was a good thing, except for all that pollution it caused (because the environment is infinitely more important than common white people to liberals).  Yeah, like kidnapping child slaves, miserable working conditions, poor wages, and little upward mobility for the workers under the tyranny of industrialists made life heaven.  After all they were working in the &#8220;land of opportunity&#8221;.  It was barely removed from black chattel plantation slavery.  Then again, whites were plantation slaves as well.</p>
<p>Between Trail of Tears and the Slavery parts, if I were to believe the propaganda in (modern liberal) southern history classes, I&rsquo;d think all white southerners were cruel, violent, and a nightmare to live around.  Good thing I had some old time grandparents and other relatives closer to real Southern history to give me a different look at my own people.  Well, technically I&rsquo;m only about 30-35% southerner (as far as ancestry goes; I live in the South, so I&rsquo;m 100% southern in that regard).  However, I embrace it just as much as my other ancestries.  You won&rsquo;t catch me waving ol&rsquo; Dixie around, but I&rsquo;ll definitely defend other&rsquo;s rights to do so. <br/>

			<p>My mother&rsquo;s grandfather, at the age of 8, went to work in the Pennsylvania coalmines, in 1888.   His father had gone blind (probably from coal dust)and could no longer work, and there was no one to earn any money to support the family, so he and his brother had to go to work. He received no schooling beyond third grade. </p>
<p>Speaking of  white workers&rsquo; hardships, prior to that a typhus epidemic had wiped out nearly all of his family within a few weeks (6 or 7 siblings) except for him and his brother.  I remember him telling stories of it. His case was not unique. There were many young children working  in the mines at the time, earning pennies. They were cheap, and they were expendable. No one cared for them. If they didn&rsquo;t work, they didn&rsquo;t eat.</p>
<p>And today blacks complain!</p>

			<p>I personally got a good laugh out of that intellectual masterpiece by Reece&hellip; .</p>
<p>Because it so perfectly shows what&rsquo;s really wrong with Afro-Americans. That they are too challenged, mentally, to be able to differentiate between reality and Hollywood fiction. </p>
<p>Hollywood learned decades ago that gore and violence sell better than virtue and decency. When that silly Roots novel came out, Hollywood pounced on it   &mdash;   perceiving it as a great money-making (commercials, residuals) TV melodrama which would draw millions of viewers.</p>
<p>Logic, reason, of course went out the window. I mean seriously&hellip; a slave was valuable property. Like a good horse. You buy a slave from the African slave-trader chiefs, bring him here, risking his life in a sea voyage (sailing ships were not as fast, roomy as a modern liner). You sell him to a planter. That planter is hardly going to hand over a stack of gold to buy a worker. Then mutilate him   &mdash;   rendering him unfit for most labor. If the slave makes a constant nuisance of himself, you might beat the tar out of him a few times; if that don&rsquo;t settle him. You sell him&hellip; to a mine owner. Unless you&rsquo;re as mentally challenged as most modern Blacks, you are not going to toss money into your outhouse pit.</p>
<p>Hollywood LOVES Blacks&hellip; Because generally, they&rsquo;re mentally challenged enough to view the slop Hollywood dishes out as REAL HISTORY! Just as most Blacks wouldn&rsquo;t dream of opening a book and (horrors), actually LEARNING something. Nor would Hollywood ever focus on the positive side of slavery   &mdash;   that most owners were reasonable and kindly people, hardly given to wanton brutality (slaves are an INVESTMENT, remember?). But, as pointed out, that would NEVER sell, so don&rsquo;t expect Hollywood to portray reality rather than fiction.</p>
<p>The tragedy is Reece probably being a fervent BELIEVER of the slop he writes. Slop which, of course, plays into and reinforces the Black Victimhood image. (Like that ROOTS nonsense.) Reece probably reads those news articles coming out of Kenya, Darfur, and other monuments to African genius, and figures evil Whites were behind the atrocities.</p>
<p>If the human-caused Global Warming Myth doesn&rsquo;t come off, 2,000 years from now Africans and their American or migrated-to-Europe kin will still wallow in their victimhood complex. Blaming their race-based dysfunctionality on long-ago slavery, repression, colonization and so on. With another Reece crawling out of his cave, to stoke the flames of victimhood, should Blacks show even the slightest sign of finally outgrowing that nonsense.</p>
<p>Wonder when Hollywood will show a film about Black physicians of three or four thousand years ago, successfully practicing brain surgery, advanced cancer treatments, having a highly developed mechanical civilization   &mdash;   subsequently destroyed by jealous Whites incapable of accepting Blacks as their superiors.</p>

<p>When people don&rsquo;t know history, they don&rsquo;t know the difference. They will gullibly accept anything that is presented to them (as history), and will believe it. In a time when education is weak everywhere, blacks are the most ignorant and gullible people around.  In a place where I used to work, the blacks would bring their small TVs to work and watch them all day.  I remember them watching the TV, their eyes glued to the screen almost as in a trance, taking in every word and believing it.  And is it any coincidence that store-front churches and charlatan &#8220;preachers&#8221; proliferate in black communities?  Talk about gullible!!!</p>
