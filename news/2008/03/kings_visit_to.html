						<p>What if you believed deeply that you&rsquo;d had the opportunity to prevent one of the darkest moments in this country&rsquo;s history but failed to grab it?</p>
<p>Whether it haunts you wouldn&rsquo;t be in doubt; the question is, how much?</p>
<p>The emotions are still raw for John Watkins 40 years after the death of his civil rights mentor, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. History will always record April 4, 1968, as the day Dr. King was felled by an assassin&rsquo;s bullet in Memphis, Tenn., but what Mr. Watkins believes could have happened 12 days earlier in Augusta brings tears to his eyes even to this day.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&rsquo;t do what I should have done,&#8221; the former Augusta attorney and civil rights leader said between sobs while discussing the 40th anniversary of Dr. King&rsquo;s last visit to Augusta on March 23, 1968. &#8220;I regret it today.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Watkins believes he didn&rsquo;t try hard enough to convince Dr. King not to return to Memphis to continue his work with striking black sanitation workers. Because he was the driving force in arranging Dr. King&rsquo;s speech at Beulah Grove Baptist Church, his hindsight about what could have been is stronger than most.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He and others who were there &mdash; attendance estimates range from 500 to several thousand &mdash; almost were denied that opportunity. Though Dr. King had made speeches in Augusta twice &mdash; the first at Tabernacle Baptist Church in 1962 &mdash; this time he was not as welcome by some of Augusta&rsquo;s black elite because of his increasingly controversial views.</p>
<p>A year earlier, in 1967, Dr. King had spoken out against America&rsquo;s role in the Vietnam War at New York&rsquo;s Riverside Church, calling the United States &#8220;the world&rsquo;s greatest purveyor of violence.&#8221; He was also in the midst of drawing attention to the nation&rsquo;s impoverished, promising to put an international spotlight on the issue with his Poor People&rsquo;s Campaign in the summer of 1968.</p>
<p>Some black churches turned Mr. Watkins down when he asked them to play host to Dr. King, and his aggravation about it is not easily hidden.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>THE VISIT was a last-minute affair. An associate of Dr. King called Mr. Watkins at his home the morning of March 20, 1968, and asked him a big favor: Could he arrange for Dr. King to speak in Augusta three days from then to help push his plan for the Poor People&rsquo;s Campaign?</p>
<p>Mr. Watkins agreed out of his affection for Dr. King, whom he had met while at Howard University law school in the 1950s and got to know better during his visits to Augusta. But there were concerns, the main ones being whether he could pull it off in so short a time and, as he puts it, &#8220;then not get killed.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>DR. KING&rsquo;S SPEECH lasted only about 10 minutes because he was exhausted from the day&rsquo;s activities. In his 2000 book about Dr. King&rsquo;s speech, King&rsquo;s Last Visit to Augusta, Mr. Watkins wrote that Dr. King apologized for being late and asked those there to support his Poor People&rsquo;s march.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He wouldn&rsquo;t get a chance to lead the march. The Rev. Abernathy and other civil rights leaders carried through with Dr. King&rsquo;s plans, but his death killed any momentum it had. The Poor People&rsquo;s Campaign in Washington, D.C., lasted 42 days from May 14 to June 24, 1968.</p>
<p>Dr. King&rsquo;s death also stopped him from carrying through on a plan that would have charted a new and highly controversial course for the civil rights movement, according to Mr. Watkins. In his book, he wrote that Dr. King shared his frustrations about the economic inequities blacks faced in America over dinner at a hotel after his speech. He then whispered to Mr. Watkins what he hoped to eventually do, something the former Augustan decided not to put in his book.</p>
<p>But after 40 years of secrecy, and initially saying he would probably take it to his grave, he revealed what it was: Dr. King was going to propose a separate state for blacks so they could eventually achieve economic parity that he believed wouldn&rsquo;t happen on its own in America.</p>
<p>&#8220;It nearly scared me to death,&#8221; Mr. Watkins wrote of the idea.</p>

<p>There, we learn about the concept of &#8220;limited separation.&#8221;  Thanks to this revelation, we now know that Martin Luther King was an advocate of &ldquo;limited separation.&rdquo;  In other words, they want what white people have, and want to be able to integrate with white society, and make it illegal for whites to have anything on their own and for themselves alone, but they want to be able to have their own legal enclaves as an option.  Of course, white governments would have to pay for these &ldquo;separate states,&rdquo; (especially their health, welfare and education), and would be responsible for these states&rsquo; predictable failures, though the blacks that govern them would get to take credit for the fleeting successes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s surprising, but not shocking.  After making a career and a reputation out of lobbying white governments and people to embrace diversity, equality, integration and civil rights, his ultimate goal was black separatism.  Of course, it wouldn&rsquo;t have been a genuinely separate state.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s called &#8220;Africa&#8221; and it&rsquo;s not just a state it&rsquo;s a whole continent.  If the blacks want their own place all to themselves they can go home to Africa!

					<p>&#8220;&ldquo;the world&rsquo;s greatest purveyor of violence.&rdquo; &#8220;</p>
<p>The folks that wanted America to surrender to the 1960s Marxist-Leninists are the same ones that pushed for gun control, ending in their greatest victory, the Gun Control Act of 1968. Forty years ago, Americans could purchase AR-15s and Heckler &amp; Koch G-3 clones through the mails, and we could buy handguns like Colt 1911s and <span class="caps">S&W</span> Model 29s through common carriers.</p>
<p>Now that the Marxists are fully in control of states like Kalifornia, guns must be <span class="caps">APPROVED </span>by the state before being allowed for sale.</p>
<p>What <span class="caps">MLK </span>wanted was the peace of the Dead for the West.</p>

<p>I would have donated money to the Martin Luther King statue they&rsquo;re building in Washington DC if he&rsquo;d managed to set up a separate state for blacks.  Heck - I would have lobbied to change Black History Month into <span class="caps">MLK</span> Month!!  </p>
<p>It would be well worth sectioning off 1/50th of our country to avoid all the turmoil of white flight, integrated schools, affirmative action and black criminals preying on whites all over America.  <i>I <span class="caps">HAVE</span> A <span class="caps">DREAM&hellip;</span></i></p>

					<p>It was a rendezvous with prostitutes that determined <span class="caps">MLK</span>&rsquo;s itinerary.<br>
What&rsquo;s up with &ldquo;the darkest moments in this country&rsquo;s history&rdquo;?   It was a bright sunny day compared to the day Lincoln was shot.  Not because Lincoln was such a good president, but because he had a workable plan to end racism in America, and his death prevented him from carrying it out.  </p>

<p>There are several dozen nations (many vast and full of resources) that blacks have all to themselves: And it is in precisely in these all-black black-run nations where blacks live in the most abject poverty. And guess where blacks enjoy the greatest economic prosperity, well above most whites in this world: Why, non other than &#8220;racist&#8221; America!<br>

					<p>&#8220;Dr. King had spoken out &hellip; calling the United States the world&rsquo;s greatest purveyor of violence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On that count he was right on the money.</p>
<p>Since he was killed 40 years ago, &#8220;his people&#8221; have certainly taken the lead in making us exactly what he labelled us.  I guess it&rsquo;s King&rsquo;s gift that keeps on giving. </p>

<p>But wait, what <span class="caps">MLK </span>proposed was the basis of South Africa&rsquo;s Apartheid.  So why the hypocrisy? And the then SA govt. also proposed financial and logistic help for the several black States or homelands as they were called.

					<p>A separate state for blacks? It would be great for Whites. It would be a disaster for blacks though. Why King would think this would enrich blacks is beyond me. Look at Haiti. Look at Jamaica. Look at <span class="caps">ANY </span>sub-Saharan African country. Still I would be all for the idea. Cede a certain amount of national territory to blacks and let them settle there and be done with them.</p>

Blacks spend too much time and effort mouthing support and demanding integration and equality to say what they really believe in their heart and soul; that they&rsquo;d be happier not being around whites.</p>
<p>I read the black press and I listen to black radio. Blacks pine for the days when they had their own neighborhoods and their own schools and their own sense of community, all of which they lost with integration.</p>
<p>For blacks to say that they support &#8216;separate but equal&rsquo; would be to say that Martin Luther King JR and the &#8216;civil rights&rsquo; movement was wrong. Although I hear that sentiment in their words, few blacks are willing to admit that their leaders of the past were wrong and that their choices in supporting such people and ideals excaserbated their own pathology.<br>

					<p>I counted fifteen &#8220;Dr. King&#8221;s in just the extract of that article.  Fifteen!  What other person with a Ph.D. is so obsessively referred to as Dr. So-and-so?  It&rsquo;s as if blacks are desperate for you to know that there is at least one black person who has a Ph.D.  Or that the Ph.D. confers some kind of powerful white man&rsquo;s juju on one of their own.</p>
<p>Of course, the degree is fraudulent, as King&rsquo;s dissertation relied heavily on plaigarism.</p>
<p>More proof that &#8220;Dr. King&#8221; is treated as some kind of unassailable figure in this country - almost a demigod.</p>

					<p>Instead of one black state, blacks have taken over numerous enclaves throughout the country.  We call them &#8220;cities.&#8221;  Most of our major cities, and many of the minor ones, are black majority, with a corrupt and failing black government, failing schools, total dependence on federal aid, and increasing resemblance to Harare.</p>

					<p>Most places they have, without knowing it, achieved this dream.  Most cities have two types of commercial areas: majority white, where blacks are frequently found shopping albeit in small numbers - and majority black establishments that rarely see a white face.  Likewise many cities feature majority white neighborhoods and all black neighborhoods.   While the white practice of simply banning blacks from some areas or organizations has been found illegal, the black practice of defacto segregation is never challenged.  It is maintained by a combination of intimidation, violence, rudeness, anger and crime.  All of this has increased at the same time that forced integration of white establishments has become nearly 100% defacto accomplishment the integration of black enclaves has gone down.  The city I live in has many black churches, black bars, black laundrymats, even small black stores that I&rsquo;m quite sure no whites go into for a year running, excpet perhaps for police of meter readers.  It may be that there are alos businesses that blacks don&rsquo;t go into - but that is just a coincidence due to their relatively small numbers.  Were they to wake up and decide to go to a coffee shop in the middle of the whitest area of the city they would be welcome and served the same as anyone else.  </p>
<p>By contrast a white person going into a &#8216;black-only&rsquo; establishmnet is likely to have comments made, or be treated to rude stares, bad or no service and outright hostility.</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s Church was a great example of this.  A defacto all Black church.  A church that no normal white person (one who wasn&rsquo;t out to prove a point) could possibly feel comfortable in, given the quality and content of the preaching.   Meanwhile across town I&rsquo;m sure the big Presbyterian, Catholic and Methodist churches that are full of whites also have a small number of black members.  </p>
<p>Just another aspect of the double standard as practiced in America. </p>

					<p>Yes the &#8220;Dr. King&#8221; thing is funny.   The only white person I can think of who so overused the &#8220;Dr.&#8221; title was Hunter Thompson.  Of course his use was tongue in cheek, and he admitted in print that his &#8220;doctors degree&#8221; came from the mail order mill The Universal Life Church.  Thompson whatever else his faults, certainly wrote all of his own books and will certainly go down as a completely original voice in American letters. </p>
<p>I work with dozens of (real) PhDs. and none of them use the title Dr.  </p>

					<p>I never heard this story before.  If it be true, one wonders if it might be the result of the lingering influence of the proposal for a separate Nego state of the Black Belt made by the Communist Party <span class="caps">USA </span>in the 1930s.  On the other hand, how serious was King about this idea, even if he suggested it?  And it was in secret?  Were he serious, he would have had the adulation of the Black Muslems and the Black Power movement, which by the late 1960s had supplaned the civil rights movement.</p>
<p>Blacks do not have a separate state, but they do dominate many cities in the <span class="caps">US. </span> One can judge if this has brought equality or prosperity to the citizens of those cities.  For example, Mayor Nagin provided the leadership so that &#8220;chocloate city&#8221; New Orleans could sink beneath a flood of broken levees and broken dreams.</p>
<p>I think King was right in denouncing the Vietnam war.  But that does not justify the thousands of murders occurring each year  in the <span class="caps">US, </span>often in the cities dominated my liberals.  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  HM</p>

<p>Yeah I wish King hadn&rsquo;t of gotten killed. I wish he had lived so he and the entire civil rights movement could have been discredited. When King was killed, he became a scared cow that no one could criticize.</p>

<p>This is an excellent idea and I support it 100 per cent. The blacks should have been given an amount of the <span class="caps">USA </span>in proportion to their population. Then whites would have had the right to keep the blacks out of our schools, government, daily lives, etc. So what if the blacks would have ended up in a poverty riddled mess. It would be their own mess from top to bottom. </p>
<p>The greatest threat to our white existence is miscegenation, and the blacks are doing a fine job at this today, because of the unlimited race-mixing that our institutions allowed and now promote.</p>
<p>The only way to allow us to live separately is to give the &#8220;minorities&#8221; some land of their own, then rigorously enforce the laws protecting us - from incursions by them.</p>

					<p>&#8220;Or that the Ph.D. confers some kind of powerful white man&rsquo;s juju on one of their own.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the correct summation. I was listening to <span class="caps">WLS</span>-AM&rsquo;s Jerry Agar show and some Black woman called in saying that although she had an <span class="caps">MBA, </span>she could see Whitey getting promoted past her right and left. She said that this ws the fault of Whitey&rsquo;s prejudices and that Blacks had to &#8220;work twice as hard&#8221; to get noticed.</p>
<p>In this case, the <span class="caps">MBA </span>was supposed to have conferred upon her the magical quality of &#8220;competence,&#8221; enough to get promoted.</p>
<p>I guess she had never heard of the &#8220;Peter Principle&#8221; and that she had apparently risen to her level of incompetence, and that everyone else but her recognized this.</p>

Where can I get more info on this and the source of this man named John Watkins? Here I am from Georgia and never heard this before. This has been hidden from many. If only others could hear this!<br><br>
However, I assume too much as this bit of info would never be made known in the liberal news, as it would be stopped or somehow completely denied. </p>

					<p> A long time ago, I read an article about Louis Farrakhan wanting land for blacks only. His proposal was to take four adjoining states, make it a small country, have the United States fully fund and support it for the first fifty years. The blacks that didn&rsquo;t want to go could remain with all affirmative actions, set aside qoutas and all the other free handouts unabated.<br>
 Further, blacks could come and go as they pleased but whites would be strictly forbidden to enter the new country.<br><br>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure it would scare alot of blacks to be weaned off the White welfare machine and then left to their own devices.  Separation is the only logical thing to do.  I would even support reparations if it would lead to a separate black homeland for these people.  You couldn&rsquo;t expect them to go back to Africa since no country would take them in but you could give them part of a state in the Deep South.  There&rsquo;s already so many areas there where blacks outnumber Whites by a wide margin.  The most important thing is to not forget to build the fence!  </p>
