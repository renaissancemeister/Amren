						<p>Sen. Barack Obama&rsquo;s pastor says blacks should not sing &#8220;God Bless America&#8221; but &#8220;God damn America.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Obama&rsquo;s pastor for the last 20 years at the Trinity United Church of Christ on Chicago&rsquo;s south side, has a long history of what even Obama&rsquo;s campaign aides concede is &#8220;inflammatory rhetoric,&#8221; including the assertion that the United States brought on the 9/11 attacks with its own &#8220;terrorism.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a campaign appearance earlier this month, Sen. Obama said, &#8220;I don&rsquo;t think my church is actually particularly controversial.&#8221; He said Rev. Wright &#8220;is like an old uncle who says things I don&rsquo;t always agree with,&#8221; telling a Jewish group that everyone has someone like that in their family.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>An ABC News review of dozens of Rev. Wright&rsquo;s sermons, offered for sale by the church, found repeated denunciations of the U.S. based on what he described as his reading of the Gospels and the treatment of black Americans.</p>
<p>&#8220;The government gives them the drugs, builds bigger prisons, passes a three-strike law and then wants us to sing &lsquo;God Bless America.&rsquo; No, no, no, God damn America, that&rsquo;s in the Bible for killing innocent people,&#8221; he said in a 2003 sermon. &#8220;God damn America for treating our citizens as less than human. God damn America for as long as she acts like she is God and she is supreme.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We bombed Hiroshima, we bombed Nagasaki, and we nuked far more than the thousands in New York and the Pentagon, and we never batted an eye,&#8221; Rev. Wright said in a sermon on Sept. 16, 2001.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have supported state terrorism against the Palestinians and black South Africans, and now we are indignant because the stuff we have done overseas is now brought right back to our own front yards. America&rsquo;s chickens are coming home to roost,&#8221; he told his congregation.</p>
<p>Sen. Obama told the New York Times he was not at the church on the day of Rev. Wright&rsquo;s 9/11 sermon. &#8220;The violence of 9/11 was inexcusable and without justification,&#8221; Obama said in a recent interview. &#8220;It sounds like he was trying to be provocative,&#8221; Obama told the paper.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama has praised at least one aspect of Rev. Wright&rsquo;s approach, referring to his &#8220;social gospel&#8221; and his focus on Africa, &#8220;and I agree with him on that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sen. Obama declined to comment on Rev. Wright&rsquo;s denunciations of the United States, but a campaign religious adviser, Shaun Casey, appearing on &#8220;Good Morning America&#8221; Thursday, said Obama &#8220;had repudiated&#8221; those comments.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

			<p>If I had an uncle who said we should sign God Damn America rather than God Bless America, and blamed the U.S. for 9/11, I would categorically disown him without hesitation or apology.</p>
<p>So why hasn&rsquo;t Obama done the same?</p>

			<p>Show me your friends and I&rsquo;ll tell you who you are.  Obama has been a member of Wright&rsquo;s church for 20 years.  He was married by Wright who also baptized Obama&rsquo;s children.  Obama has also given huge sums of money to the church.  Wright is also close to Farrakhan and has traveled to Africa with him and given him awards.</p>
<p>Obama has apparently bought into all of this.  This is not about<br>
an old uncle who says funny things.  </p>
<p>Obama has managed until now to fly under the radar but thanks to   Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Obama&rsquo;s pastor and friend, the spotlight is starting to light up Mr. Obama&hellip;and it&rsquo;s about time.</p>

			<p>The fact that any White person would vote for Obama suggests our race has very serious problems. I don&rsquo;t see how the USA will survive.</p>
<p>If one examines the history of Portugal and South Africa, one reaches the inescapable conclusion that the United States is past the point of no return and doomed as a civilized, first-world nation.</p>

			<p> Does anyone think that if a white candidate was a member of a church that preached White supremacy, he would have even gotten to first base in the presidential race, let alone to the eminence where Obama now is, with the press (including allegedly Republican-leaning Fox News) going ga-ga over him and running down Hillary Clinton at every opportunity? What a laugh! This man continues to get a free ride, despite such negatives as this hate-spewing preacher who he found so &#8220;inspiring.&#8221; If America is foolish enough to elect this dangerous mulatto, we&rsquo;ll deserve whatever happens to us. Can you imagine Obama taking his oath of office from this jumped-up screamer? Our Founding Fathers would all be turning over in their graves. </p>

The good pastor&rsquo;s views are, of course, &#8220;the &#8220;Black&#8221; view. The &#8220;Black&#8221; view can never be that of the White, simply because the two races are too different and it will always be so. In a more enlightened and less superstitious era that was a matter of common sense.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blacks&#8221; should have every right to their unique views just as they should have the right to their own unique &#8220;culture&#8221;. </p>
<p>The reaction by the phony White &#8220;leaders&#8221; and opinion makers to the &#8220;Black&#8221; pastor expressing and promoting the viewpoint of his fellows was predictable.</p>
<p>The White &#8220;Leaders&#8221; and opinion makers would better serve &#8220;the human race&#8221; by defending and promoting the true feelings of those of their own race, rather than  criticizing &#8220;Black&#8221; leaders who express and promote the true feelings of theirs.</p>

			<p>Sorry Obama,</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like an old uncle that says things one doesn&rsquo;t agree with. An uncle is someone whose connection to a person by blood<br>
or marriage in a way that is beyond your control. Obama CHOSE<br>
to attend that church and idolize the bigot. Obviously he can&rsquo;t<br>
disagree too much since he&rsquo;s been a member for quite some time.<br>
Perhaps he&rsquo;ll be a congressional chaplain.</p>

			<p>Wright&rsquo;s comparison of wartime tactics to 9/11 is ludicrous; it provides his apparently skewed thought processes with an excuse to blame the good old USA for being an fount of evil around the globe. </p>

			<p>Obama&rsquo;s Pastor: God Damn America, U.S. to Blame for 9/11</p>
<p>&ldquo;We bombed Hiroshima, we bombed Nagasaki, and we nuked far more than the thousands in New York and the Pentagon, and we never batted an eye,&rdquo; Rev. Wright said in a sermon on Sept. 16, 2001.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, what an interesting remark to make.</p>
<p>I listen to a lot of white nationalist oriented Internet talk radio, and there is a considerable amount of discussion - along with a curious combination of amazement, disappointment and embarrassment - about how so many whites seem to have some kind of weird deficiency, IQ-wise, regarding their inability to see through lies, deceptions, and con-games - scams that are relatively transparent to most non-white minorities.   I&rsquo;ve witnessed this condition - clinically referred to as &#8216;Cognitive Dissonance&rsquo; - in many of my closest white friends and even close family members.  </p>
<p>Here, we have a text book example of a black man, a preacher in fact - who seems to grasp, at some level - the simple and ugly truth that Americans have been lied to about the reasons for going to war for at least the entire last century.  And, despite the fact that most of the lies that were spouted by our various leaders that lead to our entry into those wars have pretty much been exposed as lies - white Americans, who lost hundreds of thousands of family members in those wars, still refuse to get angry at their corrupt government who were and are responsible for those deaths. </p>
<p>A reasonable and thoughtful man of even modest intelligence might absorb the exposure of these lies and convince himself that trusting his government or trusting ANY politician is a clear sign of insanity; that one should always be distrustful and suspicious of government.  </p>
<p>Minorities have this figured out.  </p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t whites?</p>

			<p>hmm.Two points Id like to make. People have always left countries that the felt that they were oppressed by. my ancestors left germany in the early 1900s. Whats stopping all these unhappy black americans from seeking refuge elsewhere? The other point is that blacks always seem to be able to tell you in detail what the white man is doing wrong and where improvement is needed, but they dont seem to be able to critically view the behaviour of their own.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ll bet this article will garner the most responses in the history of this board. This is it folks. We have finaly arrived at the rubicon. Look at the economy. It&rsquo;s a hair away from bust. There is no doubt in my mind that the powers that be knew about Obamas past. They want him to be elected. They know this would be the spark for a civil war in this country. That would be the mechanisim to bring in the UN to mediate the situation like they have at the behest of the shadow government in all the other countries that have been through thier own turmoil in the past forty years. Then like in the EU they will push a common currency here where they would revalue the dollar. They want thier new world order and they will get it. At any cost!</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to see how blacks are being indoctrinated into a state of perpetual resentment not only by their political leaders, but also in their Christian churches!</p>
<p>And what a contrast with the perpetual &#8220;turn-the-other-cheek-to-black-violence&#8221; indoctrination whites are receiving not only from their political leaders, but also in their own Christian churches! </p>

<p>For the past seven months I&rsquo;ve tried to tell anyone within earshot about Obama&rsquo;s racist church and his White-hating pastor.  </p>
<p>Limbaugh came on the airwaves today and played three clips over and over until many of us had the things memorized.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t say you weren&rsquo;t warned about this &#8220;Manchurian&#8221; African candidate.  It&rsquo;s time the advice was heeded before the Reverend Jeremiah Wright gets to lead an Afro-centric prayer on the Capitol steps on January 20, 2009.  </p>

			<p>I think this church is the only thing that truly reminds Obama that he is black. </p>
<p>The color of skin, his facial features, half his genetic make up, and the African-American cultural customs he&rsquo;s probably forced to engage in &hellip; I just don&rsquo;t think these things cut it for him. </p>
<p>No. </p>
<p>This church is like a shot of pure-grade blackness straight into his veins.</p>

			<p>This Rev. Wright is so nutty, and his remarks are so fatuous and full of paranoia, that I won&rsquo;t even begin to rebut them.  I will say that if Obama thinks that his church isn&rsquo;t particularly controversial, then that shows you how far off kilter Obama&rsquo;s standards are.</p>

			<p>With your old crazy racist uncle, you&rsquo;re kind of obligated to have a relationship, but maintaining a 20 yr. relationship with your crazy racist preacher is purely a matter of personal choice, I&rsquo;m surprised the articulate, eloquent, rhyming speechmaker could not make this distinction. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Sen. Obama declined to comment on Rev. Wright&rsquo;s denunciations of the United States, but a campaign religious adviser, Shaun Casey, appearing on &ldquo;Good Morning America&rdquo; Thursday, said Obama &ldquo;had repudiated&rdquo; those comments.&#8221;<br>
Hey Euro-Americans! You&rsquo;d better wake up from your rapture.  This guy is dangerous! Remember the holocaust victims who thought they were merely going to a new location to live.  They talked about what they would do when they got there.  They really wanted to believe what the Nazis told them.</p>
<p>OK. So Barack&rsquo;s handler says that the Senator repudiated the comments made by &#8220;Ireverend&#8221;  Wright so that means that Barack doesn&rsquo;t support those views.And all the Whites believe it. Remember Farrakhan&rsquo;s flunky the late,(Alabado sea Dios)  Khalid Muhammed who exhorted Blacks to kill the Crackers, Kill their women, kill their babies, kill the faggots, kill the Jews. It&rsquo;s time for all the above groups (we&rsquo;ll give the babies a pass) to unite against the enemy within. Let&rsquo;s put aside our petty differences and go to DEFCON 5.  &#8220;Once more into the breech dear friends&#8221; This is one that we can&rsquo;t afford to lose. Keep the names and faces of the victims in mind as you go to the polls, the two recents coeds, the Wichita five, the couple in Knoxville, Mellisa Mc Laughlin and others to numerous to mention. IF Obama wins the nomination and you&rsquo;re a Democrat, write in Hillary Clinton. I know, I know but better to bare the evils that we know than to fly to others that we know not of. Or write in Geraldine Ferraro. I hear that she makes great Lasagna. Anyone But Obama.</p>

			<p>The tapes of the above were aired on the O&rsquo;Reilly Factor tonight, and it&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve heard this evil anti-white racist speak.  He is indeed the epitome of uncontrolled hatred, with most of what he says amounting to absolute lies, and all of it revealing an underlying rage at white America.</p>
<p>His weekly sermons are filled with similar maniacal rants, so for this Barack Hussein to try to distance himself from these radical views is just plain preposterous.  The man married him, baptized his children, advised him to seek the presidency, plus acted as his advisor and mentor, and just recently was appointed to a committee to advise on the election.  The title to Hussein&rsquo;s book was even paraphrased after one allegedly written by Wright.</p>
<p>Are we to believe that Barack Hussein doesn&rsquo;t hold the same views as the good reverend?  Are we to believe that someone who doesn&rsquo;t agree with such hateful rhetoric would stick around a church as best buddies with the perpetrator of such evil hysteria?</p>
<p>The whites who still support this man after listening to his advisor rave and rant should be rejected completely from any membership in the white race, because it is they, ultimately, who would be responsible for unleashing this hater and his evil pastor on our families and friends, if he is elected.  As it is, they are responsible for much damage already.</p>

<p>Whites are starting to learn what we always suspected:  the reason blacks stay in church for 4+ hours each Sunday is not for worship of the Lord Jesus and to be filled with the Holy Spirit.  It is to listen to vitrolic blabber from hate filled self proclaimed &#8220;pastors&#8221;, who basically encourage their congregations to hate whitey and everything that America used to stand for (and to learn how to work da gubmint to get those handouts.)</p>
<p>All churchs should lose their tax exempt status and start paying taxes like every other business in the US.<br>

			<p>I must say that the Reverend is right: his church is not particularly controversial. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty middle of the road where black churches are concerned:  &#8220;God d@mn America&#8221; is pretty standard fare in black churches.  </p>
<p>Certainly nothing that a black Christian would be concerned about.  </p>
<p>He certainly wouldn&rsquo;t refuse to warmly shake the Reverend&rsquo;s hand if he ever met him.</p>
<p>Now you have to ask, who is this &#8220;America&#8221; that the Reverend condemns to the depths of hell?  </p>
<p>Certainly not black folk, since the Reverend tells us over and over that &#8220;America&#8221; done did the black folks wrong.  </p>
<p>And certainly not the brown folk, since &#8220;America&#8221; done treat them wrong, too.  So who could &#8220;America&#8221; be, do you suppose?</p>
<p>Could it be yellow folk?  Not likely, since they were not around when &#8220;America&#8221; did the dirty to colored folk.  </p>
<p>And not the red man, since the Reverend says &#8220;America&#8221; been after them, too.</p>

			<p>So far if you tally up Obama&rsquo;s abacus we have:</p>
<p>1 Bitter Anti-White Affirmative Action Recipient wife</p>
<p>1 Anti-white Church with a crazy anti-white hatred spewing Pastor</p>
<p>1 Perfect Liberal score per Americans for Democratic Action</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s more.</p>
<p>The upsetting thing, for me at least and perhaps others here is that the Neo-Con Bush Republican Party is repugnant as well. Ron Paul, it appears was merely a pipe dream. Maybe things can get so crazy by the fall he can win as a third party candidate&hellip;one can dream&hellip; </p>

			<p>Obama&rsquo;s 20 years of loyalty to Wright is too incriminating. <br>
If Obama truly disagreed with Wright at a church service one week, he would not have showed up the next week. </p>
<p>Wright&rsquo;s words expose more than what could certainly be considered a racial issue, he&rsquo;s a TRAITOR to this county of white, blacke, yellow, etc. people. </p>
<p>I bet Hillary had a hand in this story coming to light. I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s a coincidence that damanging stories from opponents break within days of one another. It&rsquo;s down to the wire. Both may be feeling desparate. Cheap shot here, cheap shot there&hellip;it can always get even worse. </p>
<p>(It&rsquo;s hilarious that the black-white tension is felt within the Democratic party more than between the Republican and Democratic parties.)</p>

Too many white folks are just too lazy to search for the truth.  Look how many white women voted for Hillary and has she really done a thing for white women?  How have we come so far?  Look at all the whites that have been bamboozled by Nigerians?  The elderly are constantly being ripped off in this country.  The stupid white sports nuts rooting for the black lowlifes that hate them.  We all could go on and on about how stupid white people have become.

			<p>If your pastor or priest said &#8220;goddamn&#8221; during a church service, or gyrated his hips wildly simulating a sexual act while talking about a man having sex with a woman, again during a church service, would you ever return to that church again, or claim that man as your pastor? The apple doesn&rsquo;t fall far from the tree in religion as well as family relationships. If Obama knew that this man was like this, and still stuck with him for 20 years, I would have to seriously consider not only the mental state of Obama but his spirit as well. No one could listen to this type of hatred and lewdness for any length of time and not come away adversely affected. If Obama&rsquo;s pastor is like this, then Obama is like this!!! What his pastor friend believes, he believes. There is no way of him escaping it. Any white who would vote, or even think of voting, for Obama is a disgrace to the white race and, as one writer pointed out, be totally dismissed from the white race as an utter traitor to our race. It is disgusting that this individual has even progressed as far as he has and it is only because of stupid whites voting for him. The complete bankruptcy of both our political parties is  absolutely appalling.</p>

			<p>Obama&rsquo;s radical, racist, militant pastor is someone who performed the wedding ceremony for Obama and his wife, baptized Obama&rsquo;s children, and was his pastor for over twenty years. One must wonder what influences such a mentor had on Obama during twenty years of sermons and fellowship. Terrifying thoughts.<br>

<p>What most folks in the U.S. don&rsquo;t get is that most Blacks have no sense of loyalty or patriotism at all. They simply view the government as a racial spoils system  &mdash;  -a large welfare state to take care of them. Were a more generous or tolerant state to exist (that would take them), they would be out of here in a year. </p>

			<p>Read some of the comments attached to the article from Obamabots.  They&rsquo;re hilarious!</p>
<p>E.g., &#8220;Now let&rsquo;s see what Hillary&rsquo;s pastor says, and find out if she agrees with all of it.&#8221;  LOL!  Uhm, pretty sure if Hillary&rsquo;s (no doubt white) pastor was selling recordings of his sermons where he said America was to blame for 9/11, said &#8220;God damn America&#8221; repeatedly, and went around pointing the finger at black America, we&rsquo;d have heard about it by now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m constantly reminded, when I read commentary at places like ABC&rsquo;s site, of how spoiled I&rsquo;ve become arguing with and around race-realists and Conservatives; the average net commenter (though probably a cut above the average person) is almost totally incapable of making statements even remotely approximating logic.</p>

			<p>Everybody in that church is in complete sympathy with what the vile Afrocentrist was preaching.  They LOATHE and despise white people.  That is obvious.  To think that Obama is at all uncomfortable with anything Wright is saying is ludicrous.  Anybody who feels uncomfortable with the views of his pastor (particularly one expressing hatred of whites), would certainly not stay in that church for 20 years.  He&rsquo;s well acquainted with Wright&rsquo;s views, and he&rsquo;s very comfortable with them, or he wouldn&rsquo;t have stayed.  He wouldn&rsquo;t have appointed him to his election committee.  He wouldn&rsquo;t have had him marry him, or baptise his children.</p>
<p>Obama, the stealth candidate, would be a disaster for whites in America.</p>
<p>I used to think that maybe the thing to awaken White Americans from their multiculti PC stupor would be if Obama actually got elected.  Short term loss for long term gain.  I now think it&rsquo;s just too dangerous.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid we are going to see violence in America that will make the Civil War look like a picnic.  The lunatic left and their insane social engineering will have engineered a Balkanlike civil war within 20 years, methinks.  Two subspecies never inhabit the same territory peacefully.</p>

<p>Clever premise for a movie, but no, it ain&rsquo;t gonna happen. For one thing, how could a civil war come about? It&rsquo;s not like you have a clear-cut geographical border between the liberal forces and real Americans. What we can expect (with Obama or without him) is a continuing slow decline into ungovernability, a kind of civil nervous breakdown. After that it&rsquo;s anyone&rsquo;s guess   &mdash;   a breakup of the country is possible, so&rsquo;s a military coup. But I suspect that only the youngest of us will live to see it get to that point.</p>

<p>KP, have you ever heard his wife speak?  I doubt that you have.  You can bet Obama is reminded daily, 24/7, about his race by that lovin&rsquo; sista. </p>
<p>Tune in to this gal sometime and hear her revelations like being proud to be an American &#8220;for the first time in her adult life&#8221; only a few weeks ago.  How do you think she feels about this country? She&rsquo;s been authentically &#8220;black&#8221; since she first formed a sentence.  </p>
<p>btw:  I&rsquo;ll bet the farm that the &#8220;Reverend&#8221; Wright&rsquo;s congregation filled the plates to overflowing during that sermon of his. They financially respond best to racist rants from faux religious black con-men who have all the perks, money and privileges who then tell them they don&rsquo;t, can&rsquo;t and never will.  Brilliant, no? </p>
<p>From what part of the Bible did he reference his sermon? </p>

There is a RACIAL war being waged in this country, only the Whites are the only ones who don&rsquo;t know about it. They are oblivious to this fact.

It was clever when the Reverend tries to tie in the blacks in South Africa with Palastinians and by implication tie in how all white countries treat nonwhite people. <br>
Ultimately what is good for the white race is almost the only thing that governments of white countries should consider and what is fair for nonwhites should be a distant second.</p>

			<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;The government gives them the drugs, builds bigger prisons, passes a three-strike law and then wants us to sing &lsquo;God Bless America</p>
<p>Seems the good hypocrite of a pastor is twisting truth more than a little, here. I always was under the impression the Blacks and Mexicans were the drug dealers.</p>
<p>As to building bigger prisons   &mdash;   put it this way: If Blacks didn&rsquo;t commit the MAJORITY of crime in our country, we wouldn&rsquo;t really need bigger prisons, right?</p>
<p>As to why Blacks commit so much crime? Because unlike Whites, MOST Blacks don&rsquo;t have either a work ethic or an adequate education! But then education is all-too-often scorned by young Blacks as being &#8220;the White man&rsquo;s thing.&#8221; Also being generally not as intelligent as Whites, the average Black can&rsquo;t grasp the idea that if you want something, you need to WORK to be able to afford it! The term &#8220;WORK&#8221;, often viewed as a four-letter obscenity by the average Black.</p>
<p>So adding innate envy and jealousy of Whites to the lack of education, lack of job opportunities for unskilled, uneducated, and often UNMOTIVATED Blacks, you have the perfect recipe for Black crime!</p>
<p>Not that the hypocrite of a pastor, NOR Obama would ever admit this truth! But call this yet another inconvenient truth!</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m all for black nationalism and encouraging separatism.  It&rsquo;s all just a pipe dream though as blacks will never establish a homeland on their own.  Their lives are too comfortable in the US courtesy of the taxpayer.</p>

			<p>Its been said that plenty of radical blacks including Uncle Jeremiah, do not want to see Obama elected president.  They fear if a black man becomes president, it proves all their rhetoric about whites keep blacks down, wrong.  And to think it was the white man that gave the black man the gift of Christianity.</p>

Comparing this guy to Connolly is so ignorant and uninformed that I don&rsquo;t even know where to begin.</p>

			<p>Rev. Wright fails to speak to his flock&rsquo;s most pressing need and commits the error that Giuliani made in Florida.  Voters there longed to hear something like this:  &#8220;I want to get beyond political spin and speak about my religious tradition now.  We Cathlolics have long believed in the doctrine of Seven Deadly Sins (lust, gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, envy, pride) and Seven Holy Virtues  &mdash;  chastity, abstinence, temperance, diligence, patience, kindness and humility.  Now, if I had been better at shunning the former and cultivating the latter, my personal life might have been a lot happier.&#8221;  It speaks further to the ineptitude of the mayor&rsquo;s campaign that the panhandle heard nothing like this.  Don&rsquo;t blame the voters.  Votes were there.</p>
<p>As the black woman stares into the mirror and performs the daily suicide of rubbing bleach into her cheeks (Should she be extravagant and do her elbows, too?), as the tired editor buries again the latest black atrocity or censors it altogether  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s only a fell click on the electronic keyboard, the minister rises to assist in the spiritual death of his congregation, in the abolition of sin not by a shower of Holy Blood, but of blood white.  He would rather hear applause than prayer and preaches death triumphant.  I look at Rev. Wright and see neither overwork nor malnourishment.  He&rsquo;s no hillbilly miner.  If we wicked whites of the west are starving him out, it is going to be a long, slow death.   </p>

			<p>Now that Obama&rsquo;s spiritual mentor has been revealed, we really must discuss WHO ELSE will be exerting influence over him. Should Obama be elected president, he will be under incredible pressure by African-Americans to place blacks in key positions. Would he be able to moderate that pressure? If he can&rsquo;t bring himself to repudiate Wright&rsquo;s comments, I think it unlikely that he could resist the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to EBONIFY the federal government and judicial system. Perhaps, Amrenners could begin speculating (and spreading the word) on who we might see as an Obama VP, and in an Obama cabinet, and elsewhere. Safe to say we would not see African Americans who are the antithesis of Wright, people like Bill Cosby as Sec&rsquo;y of Education or Thomas Sowell as Sec&rsquo;y of State. Instead, the prospects are terrifying: Al Sharpton? Jesse Jackson? Marion Berry? Kwame Kilpatrick? What d&rsquo;ya think, folks?</p>

If these outrageous, inflammatory, and flagrantly RACIST comments &#8220;aren&rsquo;t particularly controversial,&#8221; would the young Senator from Illinois please inform us as to what he WOULD consider &#8220;controversial&#8221;? </p>
<p>How about if Brotha Jeremiah began calling for an all-out Race War? What if Pastor Wright instructed his congregation to commence KILLING white Americans for their many, many &#8220;sins&#8221;   &mdash;   would THAT count as &#8220;controversial,&#8221; Senator? </p>

			<p> Jeremiah Wright is an ignorant man who uses excitable and emotional people to boost his ego and spread hatred of White people. He also serves as a mouthpiece for White Americans who hate the success of Capitalism and the Free Market; he bolsters their hatred, enabling them to verbally bludgeon the country that permits them to verbally bludgeon their country. Wright&rsquo;s idiotic statement about Hiroshima is just one example of an uninformed person using emotion rather than facts to make a point. If it were not for the bombing of Hiroshima, the Pacific War would have dragged on for another 3-5 years with projected five million+ deaths, the millitary did the math. The proposed alternative, a military invasion would have caused cataclysmic famine due to the collapse of industrial and agricultural production, destruction of rail transport and vital infrastructures, millions more Japanese would have died, as would the tens of thousands of POWs. Japan&rsquo;s uniquely distorted political structure might have entertained capitulation but the intervention of the Soviet Union&rsquo;s forces dealt them a death blow. Soviet intervention imposed a horrific cost in the lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians and military in Manchuria, a little mentioned fact. But even this did not prevent the Japanese military officials from digging in and preventing the politicians from surrendering. It was the Atomic Bomb that served as a &#8216;supernatural force&rsquo; against which no military could withstand that sealed the end of the war for Japan, this permitted the Japanese to &#8216;save face&rsquo; and surrender. The Atomic bomb was the best of a bunch of terrible choices.<br>
 It&rsquo;s all to easy for us sitting at our computers to criticise difficult decisions made decades ago, so easy to say Peace Man, no war, no foreign entanglements etc but this is not the 17th century, war is not conducted by sailing ships and blasting cannon balls off battlements. The aggressor, thanks to Leftist immigration policies, is already inside the gates; his acolytes are attending mosques and churches, learning to hate and his commanders don&rsquo;t need to leave their desks in this modern war.<br>
If you want to survive you have to demonstrate that you are willing to fight back. I see America&rsquo;s problem as being that there are a growing number of insatiabale power-seekers for whom Capitalism, Conservatism and Christianity are an anathema.</p>
<p>But I digress (as usual),</p>
<p>  I wonder if Obama and his family were in the audience screaming and cheering the hate speech monger Wright when he was hollering about #*#*#*# America, preaching hatred of Whites and Jews.  Obama should not be in the Senate let alone the White House. Obama has known about this man and his hatred for years and years, yet he let him baptize his kids, never resigned from the Church, and feebly said he didn&rsquo;t agree with everything Wright said.  Obama and his nasty angry wife agree wholeheartedly with Wright, for me, that can be the only reason they stay with that &#8216;church&rsquo;. <br>
Obama is the Islamist&rsquo;s dream come true,a man who sides with American success haters and who has Islamic roots.  And don&rsquo;t forget according to Islamic Sharia Law, once a Moslem, always a Moslem, there is severe punishment for apostasy. Obama has limited choices. These developments are very worrying.<br>

			<p>I remember the firestorm in 1976 surrounding Candidate Jimmy Carter, because the pastor of the church he attended refused to admit blacks in his church. If I remember correctly, the black in particular didn&rsquo;t live in the parish district. You would have thought they lynched the person in the middle of the night, the outcry was so deafening. As if Carter had a choice in deciding who got admitted to his church.</p>
<p>Or, the controversy surrounding Ronald Reagan&rsquo;s 1984 campaign where he was supported by the heads of Bob Jones University and the Goldsboro Christian Schools. His opponents demanded he repudiate their support, because these institutions opposed miscegenation.</p>
<p>Now we have a black pastor shrieking vitriol and venom from behind the pulpit, and Obama is given a free pass on this guy.</p>
<p>If Obama is the Democratic nominee, this will and should be used against him. I can see political ads that start out with Wright hurling these invectives against America. Then, a voice comes on and says something like, &#8220;Barack Obama believes he can bring us together. With a spiritual adviser like this, do YOU believe Obama&#8221;?</p>
<p>Cut to a scene of John McCain returning home from being a POW in Vietnam. The voiceover says: &#8220;John McCain spent seven years in Vietnam as a POW. Yet, he never lost faith in America&#8221;.</p>
<p>I think that would be an effective campaign ad.     </p>

What I meant is in the same way Connolly blamed all Irish problems on the British, Pastor Wright blames all America&rsquo;s tragedies on white America.  <br>
As for partition a key reason it happened is because of the Easter Rising which Connolly participated in, during the Anglo-Irish war many protestant civilians were killed by the IRB (in retaliation for what the black and tans were doing). If the struggle had always stayed peaceful partition would have been harder to achieve but violence entrenched old hatreds.<br>
Connelly wanted a socialist revolution in Eire, Pastor Wright wants a black revolution in America, both used (are using) militant emotive language to achieve their end(s). <br>
My personal belief is socialism is one of the worst things that can befall any nation.    </p>

			<p>As these and other demonstations of the factual morrass around Obama become mainstream (even a article on this on CNN today), more whites will shy away from him.</p>
<p>I think that McCain must be salivating, just waiting for the party debates to begin.  He has enough easy ammo to expose Obama for the empty Afro-centric suit that he is.  Drug use, dark, racist, anti-American influences, born in Africa, no less!  He doesn&rsquo;t even need to mention that this Christian convert was given a blantantly apparent Islamic name.  If McCain can&rsquo;t do that, then McCain lacks the mettle needed to lead the U.S. at this critical time.</p>
<p>Obama is what used to be called a &#8220;Rapper&#8221; in the late 1960s.  Before &#8220;Rap&#8221; became a music form &#8220;a rap&#8221; was the set of lines a &#8220;cool black dude&#8221; would use to seduce women, especially white women.  Among those lines was the now hackneyed, but still prevalent, &#8220;You just won&rsquo;t date me &#8216;cause you prej..&#8221;  Obama uses this same style perhaps even unbeknownst to himself in his rhetorical style.  He is good at two things; remaining aloof with an air of self-confidence - something that women and emasculated men are attracted to, and &#8220;rapping;&#8221; seducing the electorate with seductive verbal skill and all along silently implying that if you refuse him you are prejudice.  All he is doing to fight Hilary these days is cleverly complaining that she is being mean, &#8220;Using the old style of doing business&#8221; - nonsense!<br>

			<p>While I would NEVER damn America, I have to agree with Rev. Wright that our government (the one that forced affirmative action on us) provoked 9/11 &mdash; those who did the first bombing of the World Trade Center gave their reasons (we were desecrating their holy land and killing their children by spreading disease &mdash; e.g., we bombed Iraqi water and sewage treatment plants).</p>
<p>The federal government has provoked wars beginning with Fort Sumter and including Pearl Harbor (we cut off all oil to Japan) &mdash; for details, see <a href="https://www.ihr.org/index.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.ihr.org/index.html</a></p>

The Romans were Italians, which means they were European, which means they were white   &mdash;   and the Romans ran everything in Jesus&rsquo; country.

<p>It&rsquo;s pretty middle of the road where black churches are concerned: &ldquo;God d@mn America&rdquo; is pretty standard fare in black churches.   &mdash;  -</p>
<p>Anonymous said:  &gt;&gt;&gt;I agree with Big Bill.</p>
<p>What most folks in the U.S. don&rsquo;t get is that most Blacks have no sense of loyalty or patriotism at all. They simply view the government as a racial spoils system &mdash; a large welfare state to take care of them. Were a more generous or tolerant state to exist (that would take them), they would be out of here in a year.  &mdash;  -</p>
<p>These two have it exactly right.  Most whites have not a clue how much blacks hate them.  Mexicans have seen how the racial spoils work and are following suit.  It&rsquo;s blame whitey  24/7 for their underachievement (while partaking of all the free goodies whitey&rsquo;s taxes provide).</p>
<p>I think their methods and logic are irrational, seeing as white taxpayers support them, but I think their tribalism and advocacy for their own races are natural.  What is unnatural is for whites to have forgotten their tribal loyalty.  That tide will change.  The question is, will it be too late?</p>

The teeth fillings/crowns in their foul mouths. The idea of faithful massing together as a form of solidarity. The microphone being used for speech. The musical equipment of the church band. The electricity pumped into the church. The king&rsquo;s good &#8216;English&rsquo; as spoken mode of delivery. Even the religion itself. Everything seen in the &#8216;Youtube&rsquo; video of this whole affair except the actual hatred being put forth are the products of white protestant culture. If this black church is so bent on blackness, why is there so much white influence involved? Would it be too much trouble for the afrocentric minister to get a tiny &#8216;tuna can&rsquo; hat with a multi-colored block pattern or what?<br>

			<p>Yours is a great post, Dent.  Right on the money.</p>
<p>After all these years working with and around black people, I&rsquo;m thoroughly convinced that a majority of them hate whites with every fiber of their beings.  To disagree with them over any subject is to be racist.  Their children have their complete support when they victimize others, and blacks know that as long as little Jamal or Shaniqua continue to destroy their own neighborhoods, the government money will keep on flowing. &#8220;When they love their children more than they hate us, there will be peace.&#8221;   &mdash;   Golda Meir</p>
<p>What blacks absolutely cannot do is connect the dots between working for a goal, persevering, and an eventual positive outcome.  In other words, behaviors = consequences.  Blacks cannot and will not grasp this concept.</p>
<p>Most have next to no ability to delay gratification, it seems, and if denied of anything   &mdash;   you guessed it, it&rsquo;s whitey&rsquo;s fault. Too many blacks believe they have the racial corner on suffering, and even though they cause their own, they STILL blame white people.  Only a maladapted, distorted or at least an adolescent thought process will accept that construct. </p>
<p>Obama will have a slave-like following from nearly all blacks.  Their toxic tribal leaders will demand it because, after all, &#8220;free money&#8221; is just around the corner, and if it&rsquo;s late in coming, it&rsquo;s whitey&rsquo;s fault.    </p>

<p>WRIGHT: He ain&rsquo;t white, he ain&rsquo;t rich, and he ain&rsquo;t privileged.</p>
<p>COMMENT: Should we judge a man by his friends? By his &ldquo;spiritual personal advisor&rdquo; that HE CHOSE to counsel him on matters of faith FOR OVER 20 YEARS; for the minister HE CHOSE to Baptize his children; by the Rev. HE CHOSE to marry him; and by the Rev. that LAUDS a racist hate-monger like Louis Farrakhan? <br>

			<p>Now all those other things mean something: no flag pin, not putting his hand on his chest during the anthem, Cuban flag in his Texas campaign office, Michelle Obama saying this is the first time she&rsquo;s proud to be American.  In light of the Wright tapes, these are not flukes or isolated incidents, but part of a core belief system.  The Wright tapes connect all these dots (like a web).  I suspected this all along.     </p>
<p>Rush Limbaugh was playing the tape today. I noticed that Wright often uses the term &#8220;Europeans&#8221; rather than Americans during his disparaging remarks. Thus, his venom is directed more toward the white race than America. Whatever hatred he feels toward America is due to his hatred of whites. Yet the focus has been on his comments toward America.     </p>
<p>He also said Jesus was black. What Bible is he reading? </p>

We&rsquo;ll see.   They&rsquo;re frantically doing damage control. I saw earlier today that Obama had  <i>&#8220;distanced&#8221;  </i>himself from  Rev.Wright&rsquo;s comments. Now, in the latest news, I see that he has now <i>&#8220;denounced&#8221;  </i>the good reverend&rsquo;s comments.  It&rsquo;s getting interesting.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I took careful note of the reverend&rsquo;s picture. He&rsquo;s a good deal whiter than Obama   &mdash;   looks like another W.E.B.duBois. If Obama&rsquo;s half white, he&rsquo;s at least 3/4 or 7/8.   Another embittered mulatto who can&rsquo;t quite pass!</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Big Bill said: &gt;&gt;&gt;I must say that the Reverend is right: his church is not particularly controversial.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty middle of the road where black churches are concerned: &ldquo;God d@mn America&rdquo; is pretty standard fare in black churches.  &mdash; </p>
<p>Anonymous said: &gt;&gt;&gt;I agree with Big Bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
I too have caught a whiff of this stuff emanating from the black church. It was when on tv, I watched two black females defending Barrack &ldquo;You are not allowed to say his middle name&rdquo; Obama. They appeared very smug when they let slip that people would be very surprised to know the amount of anti-white hate spewed by black religious leaders on a given Sunday, in a given black church. </p>
<p>It was earlier in the day that I watched a slick white congressman in D.C. saying that in all the many times he hustled (my word) in a black church, he had never once heard any anti-white hate speech. Watching this deceitful white politician diligently working to pull the wool over the eyes of the masses was not pleasant.<br>

			<p>The man who would be President sits in a church for 20 years with a pastor who spouts venom and hate like Wright and now claims that he just happened not to be at those particular sermons.  Yeah right.</p>
<p>And if anybody believes, even for one minute, that Obama doesn&rsquo;t subscribe to these same views, they are living in la la land with the munchkins.  </p>
<p>You are the company you keep and this is why no black should ever sit in the White House.  This hatred of white america has been building for years courtesy of the news media and our politicians who have been by pitting us against one another for the last 50 years.    </p>

<p>I saw Obama being grilled by Fox News last night about his membership of this Anti-American church. He did not do very well. To a simple and repeated request for a Yes/No answer to the question &#8220;Would you have quit if you had heard this(Pastor&rsquo;s ranting)yourself?&#8221;  Obama could only manage a stumbling &#8220;If I&rsquo;d heard it on an ON-GOING basis&#8221;, and &#8220;&hellip; if I&rsquo;d heard them REPEATED&#8221;, &#8220;I never heard them IN THE PEWS&#8221; and finally at Garrett&rsquo;s insistence, &#8220;If I&rsquo;d thought that was the REPEATED tenor of the church I&rsquo;d have quit&#8221;.(my emphasis). Does he think the millions of viewers watching won&rsquo;t notice the holes in his explanation. His shifty looks,stuttering, his red-herrings, this man is dangerous for America.  Pastor Wright claims to be a Black Liberation Theologian. He adapted it from the 1980&rsquo;s Liberation Theology, which is Marxism.  Pope Benedict in his former life as Commie-Finder General, Cardinal Ratzinger,  investigated this creed and denounced it. It seeks political revolution of society with Marxist ideology, the political structures of society need to be destroyed in order to achieve Redemption which they call Liberation, hence the name. <br>
In all the 20 plus years that Obama has known &#8220;uncle&#8221; Jeremiah Wright did he not have the political and intellectual skills to grasp this? I got it just listening to a few minutes on TV, if he didn&rsquo;t what is he doing running for President?<br>

			<p>Well, if you have a weird uncle, you ARE kind of stuck with him, being that he&rsquo;s either your mother&rsquo;s or father&rsquo;s brother.  Most people try to avoid their weird uncles and figure out ways to deal with them during the unavoidable family gatherings, such as Christmas.  Some people even try to NOT be around when their uncle is going to be at (usually) Grandma&rsquo;s house, and they even call ahead to make sure they won&rsquo;t run into him.</p>
<p>On the other hand, BHO has apparently given this &#8220;weird uncle&#8221; a LOT of money over the years.  I wonder if we could find out how MUCH money BHO&rsquo;s given him?</p>
<p>After all, this isn&rsquo;t like this &#8220;Pastor&#8221; is a sort of harmless &#8220;weird uncle&#8221; like Uncle Fester on the Adams Family&hellip;. he actually seems like a pretty nasty person, the kind you would avoid when ever possible.  Not the kind you would cozy up to and make a big part of your life, which is what their history shows.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t like McCain but I think the best strategy right now for him and the Republican Party is to just sit back and watch the show.  You start attacking him and all of a sudden those disunited factions of the Democrats will unite in a full frontal assault.  Let them fight amongst themselves and let Hillary provide all the ammunition.  McCain doesn&rsquo;t need to say anything because this whole affair is gathering so much steam it&rsquo;s about to implode Obama&rsquo;s candidacy.  <br>

<p>This was also my first reaction, but I&rsquo;ve had second thoughts.  Had McCain aggressively gone after Obama on the pastor issue, McCain would have become the story, and the liberal news media would have been all too happy to drop Obama in order to focus on McCain&rsquo;s &#8220;racism.&#8221;  Thus, McCain&rsquo;s mealy-mouthed response was best, although I suspect that McCain&rsquo;s response was the result of his liberalism, not wise political strategy.</p>
<p>This morning, I saw smooth operator Obama giving another speech on television as his white supporters sat behind him, smiling and oblivious.  The Anti-Christ, himself, might envy Obama&rsquo;s power to deceive and charm. You would think that the hate-filled ravings of Obama&rsquo;s black &#8220;minister&#8221; would have sent shivers of apprehension down the spines of ALL formerly clueless whites, but no, it hasn&rsquo;t happened.  One shudders to think what it would take to wake such people up. </p>

			<p>Proactive said:  I&rsquo;ll bet the farm that the &ldquo;Reverend&rdquo; Wright&rsquo;s congregation filled the plates to overflowing during that sermon of his. They financially respond best to racist rants from faux religious black con-men who have all the perks, money and privileges who then tell them they don&rsquo;t, can&rsquo;t and never will. Brilliant, no?</p>
<p>You know, I just thought Wright was a grade A fool, but you bring up a good point.  He could be smarter than that&hellip;he may very well not believe some of his more ridiculous statements, and indeed preach those things purely for purposes of manipulation&hellip;</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t think of a polite or well-considered word for the fellow after even a couple of minutes, and I guarantee you I could go on about his kind.  I&rsquo;ve always been leery of &#8220;megachurches.&#8221;  But  I think that, while Wright is a fool in his own right, he is indeed pretty distinct from Obama.  As a matter of fact, everything Wright has said (at least in the recent press clips) is in direct opposition to pretty much everything I&rsquo;ve ever heard Obama say&hellip;his words often epitomize some kind of love for America.  So yes, while many of the things I&rsquo;ve heard from Wright&rsquo;s mouth on TV recently have angered me immensely, they have actually proven to be quite distinct from the views Obama purports to have, hence the failure of these ridiculous sermons to change my mind about Obama as the overall best candidate.</p>
<p>Unless of course, he picks Jeremiah Wright as his running mate&hellip;</p>

All it got me was that people say I&rsquo;m racist and afraid of blacks.&#8221;<br>

Of course. You cannot criticize blacks, nor even imply any indirect criticizm of them.  That is not allowed.  If you do, you are a &#8220;racist&#8221;.   They are today&rsquo;s holy cows whom nobody dares criticize.  Negative opinions are taboo.  Anything about blacks (other than fawning praise) is beyond the limits of permissible discourse.  Thus, there can be no rational discussion of the subject.</p>
<p>Indeed, virtually ALL minorities have been made into today&rsquo;s sacred cows who are above the reach of criticism.  Anyone who dares criticize a sacred minority is branded a &#8220;racist&#8221; or lunatic, or benighted,  an ignorant hillbilly, or something unspeakably evil, and is socially ostracized   &mdash;   if not worse.  Under Political Correctness, there is no diversity of opinion allowed &hellip; when it comes to  Diversity.</p>

There are some blacks who, in their attempt to narrow whites down and isolate them (ie. us), argue that anyone who&rsquo;s non-European is non-white;  and that anyone who&rsquo;s non-white is black.  I&rsquo;ve had them tell me that in this world there are white people, and there are black people. Either or.  For them, it&rsquo;s all extremely simple.  </p>
<p>Thus, the nonsense that Jesus was black. According to the rules of their warped logic, it makes sense.</p>
<p>Now, if Obama believes that stuff, what does that say about his vaunted &#8220;intelligence&#8221;?<br>
He&rsquo;s just an over-educated mulatto who&rsquo;s learned the speech patterns and picked up all the externals of the academic crowd which give him the appearance of learning and sophistication. But underneath that smooth exterior, he&rsquo;s still what he is   &mdash;   a gullible, uncritical, unthinking semi-black.</p>

			<p>Dedalus and Soprano Fan, I agree with you about Nietzsche&rsquo;s observation back in the day, but it&rsquo;s the source of that sentimentality that fascinates and concerns me; also how to correct it.  Is it Christianity? tho&rsquo; the early church was a pretty tough operator. Was it Rousseau, the French Revolution or the Enlightenment, Did it stem from the Aristocracy? I believe I&rsquo;m correct in thinking that working people were an unsentimental lot back then and timidity wasn&rsquo;t considered a virtue. When did Pacifism become more virtuous than Patriotism and Nationalism? I&rsquo;m trying to catch up on my reading of 18thC ethics and mores to see if I can trace this trend. <br>
And Dedalus, your advice to XCOP is so correct, this site is one of the best of its type, it gives us a chance to vent and realize there are others who share our fears.  I don&rsquo;t agree with everyone&rsquo;s point of view but they are all great posters and for me no-one&rsquo;s point of view is invalid because it makes us think about issues.   Let me mention some I like best:  yourself of course and Soprano Fan, ghw, John PM,  whiteplight, Blacknerd (where are you these days?) Regulation B, St Louis CC, Howard Fezzell, Kenhelm Digby, Robert Kelly,WR, Annoyed in Illinois, Dumpty, Flying tiger and so many more, as well as the anonymous posters.<br>
  As far as I&rsquo;m concerned I foresee  a time when our viewpoints  in one form or another are going to have to be accepted and acted upon, simply because the Multicultural experiment has become such an explosive (literally)nightmare for its instigators.  The number of websites is phenomenal, no wonder Hilary wants to control it. Multicult might have staggered on a few more decades but the Islamic invasion has exposed its essentially disastrous nature. <br>

<p>You can keep believing that if you want, but the fact is the time to stop the multicultural steamroller was 43 years ago   &mdash;   before the Immigration act of 1965 became law. The trends are such that whites will be a minority in the USA within 25 years. If we as whites can&rsquo;t win against the multiculturalists when we are majority, what makes you think we will be in a better position to do so when we become the minority?</p>
<p>Whites are posed to vote BO (Barack Obama) into the White house   &mdash;   Rev. Write notwithstanding. You see, whites are tripping all over themselves to be recognized as participants in their own dispossession. Whites sure have the capability to build great societies, but on the other hand, we have self-destructive tendencies that somehow compel us to acquiesce to our sworn genetic enemies.

As far as preachers and America, didn,t one of them say,&#8221;If God doesn,t destroy America he,ll have to apologize to Sodom and Gomorrah&#8221; or something to that effect.

<p>Yes and how he says so many words but actually says nothing, it&rsquo;s a nice trick if you can pull it off. All those gals going gaga over him just gives him more encouragement.

But generally speaking I do notice that many Blacks, especially the less educated, do have a speech style that is very entertaining, just as long as they&rsquo;re happy and talking about donuts or National Enquirer news stories; when they get angry and excited they just make a lot of loud repetitive noises (as seen on Jerry Springer show) &amp; yes I admit I&rsquo;ve watched it!!. Oh the shame.<br>

			<p>Sen. Barack Obama&rsquo;s pastor, The Rev. Jeremiah Wright says blacks should not sing &ldquo;God Bless America&rdquo; but &ldquo;God damn America.&rdquo;<br>
The pastor is correct! Just think about the condition America is in, is it blessed or is it cursed (dammed)? It is dammed, and it has become that way because the Marxist media manufactured this black Teflon man Obama, the modern day version of Nimrod, who is projected as the black messiah.<br>
It is dammed because of the civil wrong&rsquo;s movement, which created the likes of &ldquo;Reverend&rdquo; Wright, Sharpton and King.<br>
It is dammed because of integration; just look at the condition of our cities, who lives in them, the same people as the Rev Wright, BLACKS.<br>
The Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Obama&rsquo;s pastor for the last 20 years at the Trinity United Church of Christ on Chicago&rsquo;s south side, has a long history of what even Obama&rsquo;s campaign aides concede is &ldquo;inflammatory rhetoric,&rdquo; including the assertion that the United States brought on the 9/11 attacks with its own &ldquo;terrorism.&rdquo;<br>
Barrack Hussein &ldquo;campaign aides&rdquo; know full well that Teflon man Hussein Obama has been attending this so called church for 20 years and now the rhetoric of the Black fascist minister is considered inflammatory. Sell that to the black dummies and the white half-wits.Is this not the same church Oprah, the black godess attended, is she not from chicago.<br>
Sen. Obama told the New York Times he was not at the church on the day of Rev. Wright&rsquo;s 9/11 sermons. &ldquo;The violence of 9/11 was inexcusable and without justification,&rdquo; Obama said in a recent interview. &ldquo;It sounds like he was trying to be provocative,&rdquo; Obama told the paper.<br>
What this phony Obama is not telling is,he heard this speech many times in his twenty-year attendance at this church.<br>
This garbage that comes from this reverend is nothing new, it same anti American speech Jessie jackal was giving over thirty-five years ago.<br>
Obama has praised at least one aspect of Rev. Wright&rsquo;s approach, referring to his &ldquo;social gospel&rdquo; and his focus on Africa, &ldquo;and I agree with him on that.&rdquo;<br>
What is to focus on Africa? The only focus is that is a Black blood stained unstable continent controlled by warlords with a diseased starving population. <br>
Social Gospel? What social gospel, the social gospel of the Communist manifesto that these blacks have been accepting for forty years.<br>
This is the price of not repatriating the blacks to Africa after the American Civil war. All the entitlements, and kneeling down to these people will never satisfy there jealously and envy.<br>

			<p>Obama&rsquo;s minister, personal confidant, associate, and advisor of 20 years, is a RANTING RACIST LUNATIC! Yet there are &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; blacks on the tube going on how this guy is some kind of respected theologian whose intellectual insights are widely respected and studied by scholars! How absurd. That would be like someone saying that Adolf Hitler had intellectual insights widely respected and studied by scholars. Yea, Obama&rsquo;s minister and Adolf Hitler deserve study alright, but as a study in raving bigoted insanity.<br>
Look at how Obama&rsquo;s church heads put out a generalized inane statement attacking those in the media who dared publicize and shine a light on what is going on in that black Nazi church: Not once do they actually address the specific hateful quotes from the black Nazi minister and try to defend them.<br>
I actually heard a talking head on &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; FOX absurdly compare the delusional dripping-with-hate rants of Obama&rsquo;s black Nazi minister to the statement from Ferraro. Let&rsquo;s see, all Ferraro does is point out what everyone has all along been acknowledging, that blacks are voting for Obama because he is black and so are whites. Something polls have also clearly backed up. Is this &ldquo;comparable&rdquo; to Obama&rsquo;s black Nazi minister&rsquo;s lunatic rants that AIDs was created by whites to kill blacks, that the U.S. got what it deserved on 9/11, that God d**n America, and on and on and on, all being screamed at the top of his lungs? And this black Nazi minister has been saying this for decades. Ferraro&rsquo;s was just a single innocuous statement of fact. And Ferraro is not a life-long close advisor and mentor of Hillary in any case. Whereas Obama&rsquo;s black Nazi minister is, by Obama&rsquo;s own statements, a life-long close advisor and mentor.</p>
<p>Obama has issued a statement acting like he is supposedly  &ldquo;surprised&rdquo; by these statements from his minister, that he NEVER heard this until now. This is Bill Clinton style prevarication: &ldquo;depends on how you define &lsquo;is&rsquo; &lsquo;is&rsquo;&rdquo; or how you define &ldquo;sex&rdquo;. You have to parse Obama&rsquo;s statement. It is absurd that Obama could have been so close to this minister for 20 years, calling him his advisor, mentor, and friend, and not be aware of his viewpoints. And this minister did not just say this in one freakish sermon: He&rsquo;s been saying this stuff in sermons for years. This is how he grew the church from 80 members to 8500, by spewing hate and venom against whites and the U.S. and Jews, and by engaging in racial scapegoating of whites the way Hitler did with the Jews. (Which is also a comment on just how entrenched and intense and widespread BLACK racism is.) So what Obama was dissembling on was that he wasn&rsquo;t at one PARTICULAR sermon. (He&rsquo;s hoping you&rsquo;re too stupid to realize he&rsquo;s not denying having been to plenty of other sermons where the same kind of hateful ravings occurred.)  So now Obama is shown to be not only a stealth BIGOT, but a LIAR.</p>
<p>And of course we hear those making excuses saying its OK for blacks to be this racist: It&rsquo;s all whitey&rsquo;s fault. Because way back when there were whites who were so bad to blacks. First off, what happened among people dead and gone is IRRELEVANT. One of the hallmarks of racism is to use historical grievances of things that occurred between people long dead and gone to foment hatred against totally different people today, just based on skin color. What if whites then foment hatred against ALL blacks TODAY over the one million white victims of violence at the hands of blacks, EACH YEAR, TWELVE TIMES the reverse, something that&rsquo;s been going on for nearly half a century now? Why, that would be &ldquo;racist&rdquo;! Well, even more so if you do the same, but use things from the DEAD PAST that no one can do anything about.) Second off, their version of historical grievances is wildly selective and distorted: No mention that black Africans WERE IN CONTROL of the slave trade, and captured and enslaved other black Africans, and sold those they did not outright kill. No mention that only a tiny fraction of whites even in the South owned slaves. No mention of the hundreds of thousands of Northern whites who died in a war that would not have occurred were it not for white abolitionist intolerance for slavery. No mention of all the countless black lives saved by white creations, from vaccines, to antibiotics, to modern machinery that does 99% of the labor in the world,&hellip; . No mention of the black African genocide against the Bushmen and Pygmies. And if they want to decry victimization of blacks, why don&rsquo;t they mention the genocide (and slave raids) against blacks in North Africa by Muslims going on TODAY? Because he knows the Arab and Arabized Muslims could care less. He only gets traction from soft endlessly accommodating whitey here in this country whom he can bully and con and use as a scapegoat for rallying his bigoted flock with impunity. (Just as Hitler rallied the Germans using the Jew scapegoat as the rallying point.)</p>
<p>Every screaming rant, dripping with visceral racial hate, was the delusional ignorant rants of a madman. As examples of the stupidity eaten up by his cheering black congregation: <br>
He cites Nagasaki and Hiroshima as why we got 9/11 in one moment, as though they were related. Now Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany had a plan to divide the U.S. with Japan getting the western half and Germany the eastern half. We all know what would have happened to blacks considering the racial attitudes of the Imperial Japanese that equaled that of the German Nazis, had these Axis powers won. So what Obama&rsquo;s minister is really saying is that he would not have minded to sacrifice another million WHITE MEN&rsquo;S lives in an invasion of Japan rather than using the A-bombs. (Being as in WWII it was WHITE men who did 99% of the combat and dying, with blacks safely behind the lines in logistical support positions: There were only a handful of tiny volunteer black units brought in towards the end of the war.)<br>
He cites that Obama &ldquo;knows&rdquo; what it&rsquo;s like to be &ldquo;black&rdquo;, because &ldquo;he was brought up in a single parent household&rdquo;. But he leaves out the WHY. Because Obama&rsquo;s BLACK African father ABANDONED him as a baby, leaving it up to his WHITE mother and grandparents to raise him!<br>
He blames third world poverty on U.S. capitalist prosperity. Another reason why he says we got what we deserved on 9/11. When in fact the U.S. has BROUGHT  prosperity to much of the rest of the world.  Those third world countries, despite MASSIVE flows of U.S. humanitarian aid, both government and from white charities (it is well documented the lack of charitable contributions from U.S. blacks), that are still mired in poverty, are in that situation because of their own GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION, government oppression, incessant inter-ethnic warfare, lack of family planning, and Marxist-style economies. On the other hand there is a long and growing list of FORMER third world countries (Korea, Taiwan, Chile, Singapore, &hellip;) that are now second and first world prosperous societies due mainly to FREE MARKET capitalism (=individual freedom): That is, government bureaucrats getting out of the way and stop interfering.  Finally, the modern world&rsquo;s prosperity is due overwhelmingly to WHITE scientific and engineering breakthroughs that heralded the world to the modern era: White created vaccines, antibiotics, and other modern medicines have saved HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS of lives all over the world among ALL races. White created modern agricultural technology, mainly hybridized crops, as well as herbicides, pesticides, tractors, trucks, have increased yields throughout the world drastically decreasing the famines that once were common, even despite sky-rocketing populations. White created machinery and automation (motorized vehicles, planes, trains, ships, telephone, satellite, communication systems, computers, internet, bulldozers, back-hoes, electronics, generators, electricity &hellip;.) do 99% of the labor in the world today. THIS is the REAL source of prosperity throughout the world. <br>
As far as why 9/11 occurred, we need not speculate: Its mastermind, Osama Bin Laden bragged about being behind 9/11 on videotape on several occasions and told us repeatedly WHY: Because he did not like U.S. infidel troops (or ANY infidels) being in Saudi Arabia! That does not mean 9/11 was OUR fault any more than if there were a terrorist act against the Muslim world that it would be justified because of the presence of Muslims in Christian countries! Such grievances are not legitimate to sane minds. Besides, the U.S. troop presence in Saudi Arabia was due to the Saudi request for our military protection from Saddam Hussein&rsquo;s aggressive regime which had blatantly invaded neighboring Kuwait. And no thanks for the U.S. having stopped the communist Soviet takeover of Muslim Afghanistan. Or the U.S. saving the Muslims in the Balkans.<br>

			<p>&#8220;You would think that the hate-filled ravings of Obama&rsquo;s black &ldquo;minister&rdquo; would have sent shivers of apprehension down the spines of ALL formerly clueless whites, but no, it hasn&rsquo;t happened.&#8221; (Posted by Belle at 5:04 PM on March 15)</p>
<p>When I was an &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; I simply ignored, never gave any thought to, such antics and misbehavior by blacks. I had no intellectual framework in which their behavior would have had any significance. If anyone had actually turned my conscious attention to their behavior by asking me how I could excuse it, I probably would have replied that the process of integration wasn&rsquo;t yet complete.</p>
<p>I think such nonchalance is possible only when whites, even though they are not conscious of it, still think of the country as being firmly in the control of people essentially like themselves, i.e., white. If Obama is elected president, hopefully that visible symbol of blackness at the head of the country will begin to produce at least of feeling of visceral unease in whites. </p>
