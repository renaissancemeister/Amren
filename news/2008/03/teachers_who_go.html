						<p>COLUMBIA, S.C. (WLTX) &mdash; Richland County deputies say two middle school teachers who got into a fist-fight in front of students over a personal matter were arrested Wednesday.</p>
<p>Investigators say the original incident happened in the hallway of St. Andrews Middle School between two female eighth-grade teachers on Thursday, March 14.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Sheriff Leon Lott] says 30-year-old Tawana Horton of Columbia and 28-year-old Cambrella Pickney of Columbia got into a physical altercation in the hallway, after the teachers &#8220;bumped into each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>The resource officer says &#8220;an ongoing personal dispute&#8221; can be blamed for the reason the teachers were fighting, but he didn&rsquo;t elaborate on what the dispute regarded.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;These teachers are still employed by the district, but they have no been back at the school since the incident took place,&#8221; Richland School District One Spokesperson Karen York told News19. &#8220;It is district policy not to disclose any disciplinary action that takes place against it&rsquo;s employees. The district is handling this as a serious matter. Teachers are supposed to be role models for students, and with the teachers fighting in the hall, they are not setting a good example.&#8221;</p>

&#8220;Blacks&#8221; have the bad habit of intimidating another by failing to courteously move away from the path of the other as they approach. I guess its a macho thing or it may just be an unwillingness, or the inability, to abide by the customary norms of a civilized society.</p>
<p>The problem arises when the approaching other also fails to yield, giving both the opportunity to engage in a physical altercation.</p>

					<p>I&rsquo;ve got a quarter that says that there&rsquo;s a black guy somewhere in Columbia laughing his head off because the women are fighting over him.   </p>

					<p>I&rsquo;ve heard of students starting a fight club, when the teachers do, then you know something is amiss.</p>

					<p>Perhaps they felt they were providing positive role models. No doubt, such behaviour is not unlike the models the onlookers receive from their peers, in their &#8216;hoods, and perhaps even from their parents. Cambrella and Tawana - such quaint names - may feel it is in their roles as teachers to teach such lessons. So their activity was two fold: while teaching each other a lesson, they were simultaneously teacher their impressionable charges a lesson. So much can be learned from African didactic method. But of course, one hesitates to typecast, or to &#8216;profile&rsquo;, in keeping with the jargon of equity. </p>

					<p>This is interesting. I had two white male teachers get into a fight during the late 1970s when I was in high school in front of students</p>
<p>If I recall correctly, they were both fired. </p>

					<p>I am a retired teacher with 35 years of experience and I have never heard of such uncivilized behavior on the part of people in our profession! If that happened in my day, the teachers involved would be <span class="caps">FIRED, </span>plain and simple! What an example for the youth; teachers who choose to drag themselves down to the lowest level of primitive human life forms. Since they are black, they probably won&rsquo;t be fired. Their martial arts skills will be the topic of conversation for the rest of the year. Perhaps the school will even hold a contest to see who can write the best blow-by-blow account!  The teacher who got the most licks in will be the Winner. She&rsquo;ll be touted as the standard by which all girls will be measured from now on. <br>
Teachers got little respect before. Now it will only be worse.</p>

Neither&hellip; St. Andrews is a suburb of downtown Columbia reflecting its once Scottish heritage.</p>
<p>Anyone that lives here (with a right mind) and has children sends their kids either to Richland district 2 or lives out in Lexington.</p>

					<p>Bad enough our kids have to push through so many obstacles these days in order to become solid contributing members to society.  There is enough problems in school with drugs, fights, truancy and high drop out levels that youngsters are being fed through their eyes.  Then comes these 2 clowns.  I can see it now, the finger pointing and chicken head bobbing that we know black women are so well known for.  Then the blows.  Wait, there is still more.  How bout the multi-million dollar lawsuit each will file against the school district for failing to protect them from the other. </p>

					<p>Here&rsquo;s a thought. Cambrella Pickney is whiter and somewhat prettier than the other black. Maybe she resents Ms. Pickney as a high yellow. </p>
<p>This would be more proof of the isolation that race mixing begets, white&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t want mixed blacks and blacks resent them too.</p>
<p>The first assertion is probably right somewhere there&rsquo;s a black male laughing his black a  &mdash;   off.  </p>
