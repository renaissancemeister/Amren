						<p>The teen suspect in last week&rsquo;s slaying of University of North Carolina student Eve Carson has been charged in a second student killing, police said Thursday.</p>
<p>Lawrence Alvin Lovette Jr. surrendered without incident after a four-hour standoff, police said.</p>
<p>Lawrence Alvin Lovette Jr., 17, was arrested Thursday morning in connection with Carson&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>Lovette also has been charged in connection with the January death of Duke University graduate student Abhijit Mahato, 29, a doctoral engineering candidate from India, according to a news release from the Durham, North Carolina, police.</p>
<p>Lovette is the second person charged in Mahato&rsquo;s killing, police said.</p>
<p>Mahato was found shot to death at a Durham home on January 18. Five days later, police arrested Stephen Oats, 19.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police released surveillance-camera photos from an ATM last week. The photos showed a young man wearing a hooded sweat shirt and baseball cap possibly using one of Carson&rsquo;s ATM cards, police said. In the pictures, a second person appeared to be in the back seat of the car, which may have been Carson&rsquo;s sport utility vehicle, according to police.</p>
<p>Chapel Hill police Chief Brian Curran told reporters that authorities suspect Lovette was driving the car in the ATM photos and Atwater was in the back seat.</p>

															<h2>UNC Suspect Charged in Duke Killing</h2>
											<p>
							<i>Mike Baker, AP, March 13, 2008</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>A suspect in the slaying of a University of North Carolina student leader was charged Thursday with the killing of a graduate student at Duke University, authorities said.</p>
<p>Police charged Lawrence Alvin Lovette Jr., 17, of Durham, with first-degree murder in the death of Abhijit Mahato hours after he surrendered in the death of UNC student body president Eve Carson.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear how, or if, the two cases were connected. The Duke and UNC campuses are less than 10 miles apart, and it appeared robbery was involved in both deaths. Mahato&rsquo;s wallet and cell phone were gone, and authorities have said the two suspects in Carson&rsquo;s death were caught in surveillance photos trying use her ATM card.</p>
<p>Mahato, 29, originally of Tatangar, India, was a doctoral student in computational mechanics. He was found shot to death inside his apartment a few blocks south of Duke&rsquo;s campus in January. One arrest had already been made in his death: Stephen Lavance Oates, 19, is being held without bond on charges of murder and of robbing 18 people, including Mahato.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lovette surrendered around 4:16 a.m. Thursday after authorities received a tip around midnight he was inside a Durham home, police Lt. Robert McLaughlin Jr. said.</p>
<p>Lovette also was charged with robbery with a dangerous weapon in Mahato&rsquo;s killing. Separately, he was charged Thursday with misdemeanor larceny, communicating threats, contributing to the delinquency of a juvenile and common law robbery.<br>

			<p>They are greedy, heartless, and brutal no doubt! Fortunately they are also stupid, at least stupid enough to let themselves be photgraphed at the ATM machine using the victims card, and driving the victims vehicle.</p>

			<p>Another black serial killer.Black serial killers are, contrary to popular belief,statistically overrepresented as a portion of the general population in this country(and many others,I suspect).When it comes time for him to be sentenced to his just punishment,you can bet that a lot of black supporters, most of them female, will be out there to try to spare his worthless hide. </p>

			<p>I wonder if the liberals will be out in force, holding candlelight vigils, writing letters and condemning these two criminals for killing an immigrant and a female?</p>
<p>I doubt it. It only matters if they are black   &mdash;   the &#8220;chosen&#8221; race. </p>

Notice when &#8220;Blacks&#8221; target White and Indian women for robbery, murder, and rape, the controlled &#8220;news&#8221; identifies them as &#8220;young men&#8221;, &#8220;teen suspects&#8221;, or disadvantaged youth? </p>
<p>This is a far cry from that of the innocent White children when they were being framed for the unthinkable act of engaging in sex with a &#8220;Black&#8221;. </p>
<p>Perhaps the Duke University professors could pass around a petition urging the controlled &#8220;news&#8221; to be more clear in their identification of dangerous violent murderous &#8220;Black&#8221; males so that White and Indian women could be alerted to the danger and to use caution. It might save some lives.</p>

			<p>I saw a report on local Raleigh news where some familiy members of Demario Atwater showed up at that court house in a rather nice looking SUV bespeckled with decals of bullet holes on it&rsquo;s side. I guess the &#8220;thug life&#8221; is all fun and games in Durham. <br>
  I heard on local Raleigh talk radio a man say that he knew someone that had went to school with Lawrence Lovette and that back in the 5th and 6th grade he was a well liked student and did very well in school. The man on the radio said his nickname for most of his elementary school years was &#8220;Mr. smiley&#8221; because he was a happy go lucky kid and was quite likeable. The man on the radio stated that his downturn began in JR high school where undoubtedly he feel prey to the prevelant mind set of so many black young men that the gang banger life style and crime are the way to prove their manhood. The man on the radio was not sypathetic to either suspect and infact said he believes they should both get the death penalty. Out of approx 22 calls made to the radio station here in Raleigh only 3 were opposed to the death penalty for these guys. It&rsquo;s important to note that these young men were not oppressed or denied opportunities to have good live, Eve Carson certainly was however. Just thought I&rsquo;d share some info from the front lines of this case.</p>

			<p>Am I the only one to remember the Zebra murders and see the same  modus operandi involved in the senseless and tragic murders of Eve Carson &amp; Lauren Burk?<br>
Does anybody else feel the same way I do?<br>
The stupidity of our people is tearing me apart at the seams.</p>

			<p>So basically if the Chapel Hill PD put more effort into finding the killer of an Indian student, Eve would still be alive.  </p>

			<p>Not that it ultimately matters, i.e. we&rsquo;re really on our own, but what does the Asian community think? Can we find allies there? If your an Asian gas station owner and its late at night and a young black male pulls up with loud (c)rap blasting from the stereo do you proceed differently, that is do you stereotype? <br>
I remember several years ago the Brooklyn Bangladeshi community was very upset at African American thugs snuffing out the lives of their hard working brethren. <br>
What we need as allies is when the white guilt trip begins to emanate from the usual suspects the facts of black depravity and danger are thrown back in their race hustling faces. Whether we like it or not  America has become diverse. </p>

			<p>Just more of the daily violence and carnage perpetrated by black racist oppressors against people of light all across the country. Wildly out of proportion to the black percent of the population. With rare exceptions, these daily black atrocities against people of light are just part of the background noise and is ignored by the leftwing media, always covering for the black racist predators. The dominant media is ever-vigilant to vigorously censor the full horrific reality of what is going on. These tragedies eventually intude into most of our lives. Very few do not have a friend, co-worker, or relative, or they themselves, who have fallen victim to black crime.</p>
			<p>
				Posted by  at  9:38 PM on March 13</font> </p>

			<a id="c435437"></a> 
			<p>The fact that these black predators gratuitously and repeatedly shot that white female university student in Chapel Hill FIVE TIMES, including in the head, clearly demonstrates the racial motive. They could have robbed her and taken her vehicle and left. Shooting her five times proves their motive was to KILL. The retro Houston Astros cap the perps were wearing is the trapping of the black racist Crips gang. It is well known that new members are frequently initiated into black gangs by having them target a white, Asian, or Hispanic. Often rape and/or murder. It is clear the initiation requirement here was to KILL a non-black.<br>
The Chapel Hill University murder, the Auburn University murder, and this Duke University murder, were racial hate crimes. But you will never hear that from law-enforcement or the dominant media.<br>

Me, I&rsquo;d settle for a trail of tears 2.

			<p>Some posters have stated, or asked, in so many words, why we seem to have a soft spot for criminals and relative indifference to the victims, especially with Black on White crime.  This, and the fact that all of us are aware about the phenomenon of &#8220;Bonding with the Abuser&#8221;, sent me in search of a relevant comment on this issue from the past.</p>
<p>Briefly, as a student of Cultural History, my position is that, just about everything happening now happened, at least in germ form, in the 19th Century. </p>
<p>Anyway, long story short, it didn&rsquo;t take me long.  And I found this from the German Philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a point in the History of Society when it becomes so pathologically soft and tender that, among other things, it sides even with those who harm it, Criminals, and does this quite seriously and honestly&hellip;.Punishing seems unfair.  &#8220;Why punish?  Punishing is terrible.&#8221;  With this question Herd Morality, the Morality of Timidity, draws its final consequence.<br>
Whoever examines the conscience of Europe will find this imperative of Herd timidity everywhere.  &#8220;We want that one day there is nothing more to be afraid of.&#8221;  This is now called &#8220;progress&#8221;&#8220;.</p>
<p>The above quote was written in 1886!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>The ONLY bright spot I see in all of this is that we become aware of the disease we are obviously suffering from.  &#8220;If ya name it ya claim it&#8221; as the slogan goes.  And, &#8220;the only way out it through.&#8221;  <br>
We are in the position we&rsquo;re in today because of Sentimentality.  Wanting to hear the tune without paying the piper.  We want something, like &#8220;progress&#8221; (both Left and Right) but we don&rsquo;t want to suffer for it.  Or even be inconvenienced.  </p>
<p>But the suffering comes anyway.  And believe me, the suffering and inconvenience is going to come for us all very soon.  Probably this year, like, say, maybe November.</p>

			<p>The photo of this genius at the ATM is most revealing, he&rsquo;s fresh from commiting a brutal torture/murder, yet he&rsquo;s sitting in the victim&rsquo;s car, smiling, hand on chin as he stares at the versateller screen trying to make sense out of what it&rsquo;s asking him. No sense of anxiety or remorse on his idiotic face, just happy to be out living the thug life getting some free money. </p>

			<p>17 y/o Lovette can&rsquo;t get the death penalty in NC (unlees a mob manages to lynch him, which is what would have happened back in &#8220;the day&#8221;). Only his 21 y/o colleague can get it.  Look for the defense to try to game the crime facts to make Lovette Eve&rsquo;s trigger man and his partner the accessory if the facts don&rsquo;t already indicate that.</p>

			<p>The stupidity of our people is tearing me apart at the seams.</p>

<p>I doubt if there&rsquo;s a Poster here who doesn&rsquo;t identify with your frustration.  But be careful, too much time alone in ones head about this stuff, which is literally tearing the country apart at the seams, can get to you.  Posting here can help in that I respect.  So, keep coming back.</p>

			<p>Jupiter   &mdash;   don&rsquo;t blame Asians for the destruction of &#8220;Native Born White Engineering experience.&#8221;  There are no laws preventing white kids from deciding to major in engineering in college.  Yet go to the science or engineering classes of most major university and you&rsquo;ll see a huge number of Asians and a relative paucity of whites.  This has to do with the dominant cultural values of young American kids of all races these days:  get rich quick and have a good time.  To be a scientist is to be an uncool nerd.  Only Asian kids seem to get enough pressure from their parents to counteract this negative peer pressure.   </p>

			<p>Little to no media coverage in Pittsburgh of this crime, since the arrest of the suspects became apparant that they were black.  In fact there is no coverage at all at this point.  No longer a relevent story.</p>

			<p>Can someone tell me why the media takes the side of the black killers? What&rsquo;s the motive of the media? It wasn&rsquo;t like this when I was a kid in the 1960s.</p>
<p>Posted by frustrated white male at 11:52 PM on March 13 </p>
<p>Was just writing about this very thing in my Journal.  So I felt compelled to respond to your post. <br>
What I was writing here was that they use their &#8220;Causes&#8221;, which often includes people (in the past, especially from the 19th Century till about the 1930&rsquo;s it was Poor Whites, for the rest of the Century it was Blacks, and now it is Hispanics and select groups from the rest of the Third World with Muslims topping the list) for the purpose of destroying what they hate most, Freedom.</p>
<p>To get to my point, after years of reading, studying, researching, and writing - with more than a sideglance toward publication - I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that they operate out of, and are united by, what I refer to as CLMS, or Criminal Lunatic Mentality Syndrome. Public examples would range from Keith Olberman, to Oliver Stone, to Fidel Castro, nearly all Feminists, Hollywood, New York Times, Modern Language Association, etc, etc. </p>
<p>They are obsessed with Power, Control, and Destruction.  For them it is not merely a Rage for Order, or even a Rage for Chaos.  For them, it is a Rage for Insanity.  </p>
<p>Part of the reason can be found in their insistance on hiding behind &#8220;Love&#8221;, &#8220;Equality&#8221;, &#8220;Progress&#8221;, not to mention hiding behind figures like Hitler.  Hitler deserves attack, for sure, but if you listen closely you can see they are attacking him for two reasons.  1- to deflect attention from their own atrocities which were greater in number, and, 2- to conceal from more perceptive observers the similarities between Hitler and them.  Namely the specific objective of their politics and the structure and organization it takes (it is structured and organized around the desire for complete control).  The only difference is Hitler wore his lunacy on his sleeve, so to speak.  <br>
  For all of the bad one can say about Hitler, and there&rsquo;s plenty, Hitler was Hitler.  He didn&rsquo;t hide.  Those who are destroying us today hide behind the things mentioned above.  Not only that, but they also depend upon the gullibility and naivete of their victims. Which is something, unfortunately, we have in large quantities. But now the good news is many of us are beginning to awake from our collective trance and taking our first real steps, in terms of Cultural History perhaps for the first time ever, toward Reality.  I think that explains the phenomenon of the Realist Movements like Race Realism and Immigration Realism, though certainly one can hope that even more such Movements will appear so as to encompose as much of Reality as possible, simply because that noun will always be more important than the adjective placed before it.</p>
<p>Our enemies - that&rsquo;s not too strong a word - on the other hand, are people who alter Reality because they suffer from it, badly.  And anyone not of them, must pay.  Because anyone not of them is a reminder that it is possible to live another way, that there is more to life than is dreampt of in their Philosophy, so to speak (this helps us understand why their aggressive promotion of Mult-Culturalism is so dishonest and shallow). That is why they don&rsquo;t merely disagree, they demonize. And they don&rsquo;t merely demonize, the eliminate!  And now we&rsquo;re back to the MSM&rsquo;s tendency to side with criminals.  For an answer to that Frustrated White Male, I kindly refer you to a previous post of mine.</p>

			<p>To Dedalus:</p>
<p>For someone who wound up eating horse excrement and dying insane, I must say that F. Nietzsche was right on the mark, in his 1886 quote. That explains why the left pushes for universal gun control, for legalization of narcotics, for the benediction of sexual practices that would have meant prison, a few decades ago. It explains why people flock to see those campy science-fiction &#8220;feel-good&#8221; movies like the &#8220;Indiana Jones&#8221; and the &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; genres. It explains why the left will continue to tell us we must love Muslims, even as their blood drains from their corpses as they are being slaughtered by the disciples of Mohammed. It explains why the left has this fasination with Obama, like he was some kind of healer, uniter and messiah, who will unite all peoples simply by spewing oily-tongued political rhetoric.</p>

			<p>Far too many of these blacks prove to be depraved, not capable of human redemption. Even today it&rsquo;s being reported that black females between 14 and 19 are 50 to 60 percent infected with some form of STD. The females are angels compared to their black brothers. Will America ever be taken back by the likes of the original founders? Or is it already too late?</p>

<p>White youth are not going into engineering because know that by the time they are forty there is a good chance they will be replaced by a twenty five year old H-1 B visa holder from India.</p>
<p>I know White parents who threatened their son or daughter that if they major in Engineering or computer science their college education will be paid for.</p>
<p>Any self-respecting White Nationalist must be  categorically opposed to hindus-and chinese and pakistanis- entering OUR country.</p>
<p>Hindus are to blame for the destruction of thousands of years of collective engineering and technological experience  that resides in the collective brains of Native Born White Americans.The hindu &#8220;Americans&#8221; use their wealth to buy massive influence in the US congress. This makes them active participants in the destruction of thousands of years of collective Engineering and Technological experience that resides in the brains of Native Born White America. </p>
<p>The owners of numbersusa.com say we shouldn&rsquo;t blame LEGAL IMMIGRANTS.Why not? LEGAL IMMIGRANTS actively participate in the perpetuation of post-1965 LEGAL IMMIGRATION policy. For NUMBERS USA to make a such a statement is tantamount to bold face lying.</p>

			<p>Typical sequence of events:</p>
<p>Young college coed missing - Huge story, / Mass appeal to entire country / all media outlets reporting</p>
<p>Young college coed found dead - Even bigger story / was she raped?/ who were her known friends and enemies / media time increases everywhere.</p>
<p>Suspect arrested - Uh-oh, he&rsquo;s black.  End of media frenzy.  Go home.  No more story here.</p>
<p>You will be hard pressed to find out more information regarding this story from this point forward.  In fact, you will probably forget about it.  Which is exactly what the media wants you to do.<br>

<p>I&rsquo;m surprised you missed Richard Grissom, yet another black Kansas City serial killer. When he was 17 living in Leavenworth KS when he murdered his 74 year old white neighbor lady. Since he was a juvenile he got out when he was 21. Later, while living in Johnson County Kansas (suburbs of Kansas City MO), he murdered five beautiful young white girls (one in Wichita). The bodies were never recovered.</p>

			<p>&#8220;For someone who wound up eating horse excrement and dying insane&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Just for the record, though Nietzsche did die insane, an insanity brought on, in all likely hood, from his contracting syphilis while in college; he never eat horse excrement.  How silly and vulgar.  No, the day he collapsed and was eventually committed to his families care he was seen by the townspeople hugging a horse whose owner was savagely beating it.  To me the man beating the horse was the crazy one.  Nietzsche was simply behaving the way anyone suffering from his affliction is supposed to behave, though in this case with extraordinary compassion that your average &#8220;Normal&#8221; person usually lacks.</p>

<i>Just for the record, though Nietzsche did die insane, an insanity brought on, in all likely hood, from his contracting syphilis</i></p>
<p>The latest evidence (reported on several years ago) disproves the syphilis theory. </p>
<p><i>&hellip;the day he collapsed and was eventually committed to his families care he was seen by the townspeople hugging a horse whose owner was savagely beating it.</i></p>
<p>The horse beating incident occurred in Italy at some time prior to his return to Germany. Yes, he took such brutality very hard.</p>
<p>Compare Nietzsche&rsquo;s sensibility to the brutes who so casually snuffed out the lives of these students and weep. The future, unfortunately, will belong to them and their spawn. </p>

theft on his mind, you&rsquo;d better let him. Take matters into your own hands=go to prison. Sounds absurd, but it&rsquo;s true.</p>

			<p>We have had a string of carjackings by  males jumping into occupied cars in parking lots, forcing the owners to go to the atm and withdrawl all their cash, then  forcing them to drive to a deserted spot where their keys and phone are taken, leaving th em immobile and without communication. THe victims are terrified, thinking they are about to be killed. </p>
<p> Instantly I knew they were all black, its their pattern. Thankfully, the local editor didnt back away from the descriptions and identified them as such.  </p>

			<p>Completely agree Dedalus, I&rsquo;ve long thought that the similarities between the abuse-yelling Nazis (at Jews) is mirrored by the Far Left&rsquo;s hectoring of their ideological opponents. Both use verbal abuse, physical violence against people and property and produce literature, film and other media outlets to relentlessly hector and harangue. I also believe this similarity is more than coincidental, National Socialism and International Socialism have the same parent, Totalitarianism. <br>
I&rsquo;ve listened to the Left&rsquo;s bullying for over 50 years and I refuse to tolerate it anymore; sheepishly backing off and attempting to reconcile my views with theirs is futile as it encourages them badger us even more. Their illogical anger and rage has convinced me there is some mental process going on that I am simply not a party to, it seems to consume them.  Just one fact alone, that Stalin murdered more people than Hitler has been denied by them for decades and when offered proof it&rsquo;s brushed aside as though it had no bearing upon their ideology. <br>
  Totalitarianism, whether Communist, Fascist or practiced by some tribal chief in Africa is disastrous for those who are subject to the whims of the dictator, history demonstrates that only by keeping people in fear and terror of the midnight knock can they retain power.  These Leftwing fools who need to dominate, control &amp; rule over us are driven almost to the point of self-destruction with their rage.<br>
