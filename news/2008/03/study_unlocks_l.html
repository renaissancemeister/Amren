<h1><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7307563.stm">Study Unlocks Latin American Past</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, March 21, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>European colonisation of South America resulted in a dramatic shift from a native American population to a largely mixed one, a genetic study has shown. </p>
<p>It suggests male European settlers mated with native and African women, and slaughtered the men. </p>
<p>But it adds that areas like Mexico City &ldquo;still preserve the genetic heritage&rdquo; because these areas had a high number of natives at the time of colonisation. </p>
<p>The findings appear in the journal Public Library of Science Genetics. </p>
<p>The international team of researchers wrote: &ldquo;The history of Latin America has entailed a complex process of population mixture between natives and recent immigrants across a vast geographic region. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Few details are known about this process or about how it shaped the genetic make-up of Latin American populations.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&lsquo;Clear signature&rsquo; </p>
<p>The study examined 249 unrelated individuals from 13 Mestizo populations (people from a mixed European/native American origin) in seven countries, ranging from Chile in the south to Mexico in the north. </p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a clear genetic signature,&rdquo; explained lead author Andres Luiz-Linares from University College London. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The initial mixing occurred predominately between immigrant and European men and native and African women.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He said that the study showed that it was a pattern that was uniform across Latin America. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We see it in all the populations we examined, so it is clearly a historical fact that the ancestors of these populations can be traced to matings between immigrant men and native and African women.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The researchers found that within the genetic landscape of Latin America, there were variations. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The Mestizo with the highest native ancestry are in areas which historically have had relatively large native populations,&rdquo; they reported. </p>
<p>This included Andean regions and cities such as Mexico City, where major civilisations were already established by the time Europeans reached the continent in the late 15th Century. </p>
<p>&ldquo;By contrast, the Mestizo with the highest European ancestry are from areas with relatively low pre-Columbian native population density and where the current native population is sparse,&rdquo; they added. </p>
<p>Bloody past </p>
<p>Explaining the fate of native males when the Europeans arrived, Professor Luiz-Linares said: &ldquo;It is a very sad and terrible historical fact, they were basically annihilated. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Not only did the European settlers take away land and property, they also took away the women and, as much as possible, they exterminated the men.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He said the findings could help people change their perception of Latin American history. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very important in terms of rescuing the past and recognising the roots of the population, and the living presence of natives within the current population,&rdquo; Professor Luiz-Linares explained. </p>
<p>As well as providing an insight into the past, the team hopes that the findings will also help shape studies aimed at identifying and analysing diseases. <br>
