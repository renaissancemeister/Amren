						<p>Soccer stars earning up thousands of pounds a WEEK rifled through the handbags of minimum-wage barmaids at a top nightspot, stealing cash and mobile phones, it is alleged.</p>
<p>Pictures published yesterday allegedly show CCTV footage of £8,000-a-week Bradley Wright-Phillips looking on as Southampton team-mate Nathan Dyer and three friends go through the bags, coats and purses of girls, who earn just £5 an hour at Portsmouth&rsquo;s Bar Bluu Club, then leaving by a private back door</p>
<p>It is claimed their haul included three mobiles, £145 in cash from three different handbags, student cards and cigarettes. It would take a club barmaid a week and a half to earn £145.</p>
<p>It takes Wright-Phillips &mdash; son of former England star Ian Wright a &mdash; mere 27 minutes to earn the same amount as the missing cash.</p>
<p>Barmaid Emma Parker, 18, who claimed she had a phone stolen, is reported as saying: &#8220;I work for just over the minimum wage.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&rsquo;t believe they would have the cheek to steal from someone like me. They have obviously done it for kicks because they don&rsquo;t need the money.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are treated like heroes but this shows they are actually scumbags.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bar Bluu in Portsmouth where Southampton football players reportedly went through the bags, coats and purses of waitresses</p>
<p>Fellow barmaid, law student Noo Kristin is quoted as saying she had £60 stolen from her bag.</p>
<p>She said: &#8220;It&rsquo;s sickening. For someone who earns 80 times what I earn to be involved in stealing from me is just horrible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wright-Phillips, 22, and Dyer, 20, went to the club for a free VIP night to watch R&B; star Kano and were plied with drinks in a VIP area.</p>
<p>When leaving at around 3am on February 27, to avoid the crowds, they went towards a back door past an unlocked staff room. Every move was caught on CCTV cameras.</p>
<p>Bar Bluu general manager Chris Sheridan described the thefts as &#8220;utterly disgusting&#8221; and confirmed he had reported the incident to the police last Wednesday.</p>
<p>A Hampshire Police spokeswoman said: &#8220;We are investigating allegations of theft at Bar Bluu. No arrests have been made and this incident is still under investigation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stuart Peters, an agent acting for Bradley Wright-Phillips, told the Sunday Mirror on Saturday night: &#8220;We&rsquo;re very relaxed about this.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have seen the footage and it&rsquo;s quite clear that Bradley Wright-Phillips was not involved. He hasn&rsquo;t taken a single thing.&#8221;</p>

			<p>This sort of behavior cannot be stopped   &mdash;   it is genetic   &mdash;   it is in their genes.  Placing more Africans in government positions will do nothing to solve this problem, because placing Africans in prestegious, high-paying jobs does not change the genetic makeup of African children.  </p>
<p>You cannot change the genetic makeup of Africans.  However, by importing millions of Africans into your nation and encouraging them to breed with your children, you can make sure that these sorts of genes (genes for low intelligence and destructive, irresponsible, thuggish behavior) will become well established among your grandchildren, and the people of your town, city, or country. </p>

			<p>Aren&rsquo;t those two lovely young men?  The idea that most people steal because they are poor and hungry is a myth.  People who steal do so because of a sense of entitlement and an utter lack of respect for the rights and property of others.  From my own personal experiences, both of these traits seem to be much more prevalent in blacks than in any other race.</p>

			<p>The behavior of blacks in Western countries other than the US defies conventional explanation. Isn&rsquo;t black criminality a function of slavery, oppression, Jim Crow, subprime mortgages, &#8220;bad&#8221; schools,  &#8220;stereotypes&#8221; in cartoons from the 1930s and other bad things unique to the United States? Since all human populations are exactly alike, shouldn&rsquo;t blacks in the UK be models of assimilation and success?  </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m sure the leftists will claim (once it becomes impossible to deny their guilt) that these two grew up under very poor circumstances and that their recent success has not been enough to switch them out of &#8220;survival mode,&#8221; hence the stealing. </p>
<p>Never underestimate the left&rsquo;s ability to rationalize away ANY painful reality.</p>

			<p>When I attended university in Britain, I resided in a dorm.  The only thieves who stole food from the common fridge were the sons of a president of a nation in Africa.  They also complained about the performance of the white, cleaning ladies.  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  HM</p>

			<p>There is no need for this behaviour nor any logic to it. More proof that some behaviour is innate to certain types. They and their supporters would deny this had happened if it were not for the CCTV recordings.</p>

			<p>When I worked at The Home Depot at an African-American neighborhood, Blacks stoled both my cans of pop (TWICE) and my lunch.</p>
<p>The best place for Blacks is Africa, and the fact that the Churches are bringing in Blacks from Africa under the guise of the title &#8220;refugees&#8221; proves how gullible Whites are to being &#8220;massaged&#8221; i.e. BRAINWASHED by they religious institutions.</p>

<p>-Ah the old genetics comment.  Guess what?  While it is true that in Britain Blacks commit a disproportionate amount of crime, it is also true that the crime rates among whites - lower class- is perhaps the highest in the West.  Most of it is robbery, but regardless, perhaps crime is in the genetic makeup of these whites?</p>
<p>You guys would be better off with arguments on culture instead of genetics.</p>

			<p>I rarely go anyplace without a book, one exception being public restrooms.  When I need to use the toilet, I will simply set my book down somewhere outside.  Some posters have claimed that Blacks have an unusual propensity for theft, but I&rsquo;m here to tell you that not ONCE has a Black EVER stolen my book!</p>

<p>Posted by Cassiodorus at 11:50 PM on March 11 &#8220;</p>
<p>-I disagree, culture is indeed the answer, because culture can vary amongst time eras and amongst races.  Which explains why the British lower class whites have become a somewhat less violent version (i refer to rape and murder, not robbery and other thuggish behaviour) of their Black counterparts, unlike say in the 1880&rsquo;s when there was minimal white crime in Britain.  The culture has changed, the white genes haven&rsquo;t.</p>
