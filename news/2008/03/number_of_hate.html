						<p>Anti-immigrant sentiment is fueling nationwide increases in the number of hate groups and the number of hate crimes targeting Latinos, a watchdog group said Monday.</p>
<p><a href="/news/2007/06/report_says_kkk.html#splc" target="splc_does_not_check_for_accuracy">The Southern Poverty Law Center,</a> in a report titled &#8220;The Year in Hate,&#8221; said it counted 888 hate groups in its latest tally, up from 844 in 2006 and 602 in 2000.</p>
<p>The most prominent of the organizations newly added to the list, the Federation for American Immigration Reform, or FAIR, vehemently rejected the &#8220;hate group&#8221; label, and questioned the law center&rsquo;s motives. FAIR said the center was using smear tactics to boost donations and stifle legitimate debate on immigration.</p>
<p>&#8220;Their banner may be &lsquo;Stop the hate&rsquo; but it&rsquo;s really &lsquo;Stop the debate,&#8221;&rsquo; said FAIR&rsquo;s president, Dan Stein. &#8220;Apparently you can&rsquo;t even articulate an argument for immigration reform without being smeared.&#8221;</p>
<p>The law center&rsquo;s report contends there is a link between anti-immigrant activism and the significant rise in hate crimes against Latinos in recent years. According to the latest FBI statistics, 819 people were victimized by anti-Latino hate crimes in 2006, compared with 595 in 2003.</p>
<p>&#8220;The immigration debate has turned ugly and the result has been a growth in white supremacist hate groups and anti-Latino hate crime,&#8221; said <a href="/news/2007/06/report_says_kkk.html#splc" target="splc_does_not_check_for_accuracy">Mark Potok,</a> director of the law center&rsquo;s Intelligence Project. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Critics of the law center, including FAIR, contend that the periodic reports on hate groups exaggerate the threat to public safety and inflate the total by including entities that are little more than Web sites or online chatrooms.</p>
<p>Potok acknowledged that some of the groups may be small and said it is impossible for outsiders to gauge the membership of most of the groups.</p>
<p>Among the largest categories of hate groups, Potok said, are neo-Nazi, white nationalist, racist skinhead and those with links to the Ku Klux Klan.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The law center said its decision to designate FAIR a hate group was based in part on the ideology of various people who established it, worked for it or donated to it over its nearly 30-year history. The center has issued a detailed report outlining its allegations, although little of that report deals with FAIR&rsquo;s recent activities.</p>
<p>The center&rsquo;s critique of FAIR was endorsed by a major Latino group, the National Council of La Raza. The council&rsquo;s vice president for advocacy and legislation, Cecilia Munoz, said FAIR&rsquo;s leaders were polished in public forums, but represented &#8220;a very unsavory set of views.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Both FAIR and law center are relatively well known in the ranks of advocacy groups. The law center, which started as a small civil rights group in 1971, has amassed an endowment fund totaling $200 million as of October and it received nearly $29 million in grants and contributions in fiscal 2007.</p>
<p>FAIR claims more than 250,000 members and reported more than $4 million in contributions in 2006.</p>

			<p>Given that &#8220;La Raza&#8221; means &#8220;The Race,&#8221; why wouldn&rsquo;t it count as a &#8220;hate group&#8221;?</p>

			<p>Both FAIR and law center are relatively well known in the ranks of advocacy groups. The law center, which started as a small civil rights group in 1971, has amassed an endowment fund totaling $200 million as of October and it received nearly $29 million in grants and contributions in fiscal 2007.</p>
<p>I kind of wonder now whether the SPLC donates money to groups like Stormfront or Aryan Nations inorder to justify the existance of the SPLC.The fact is FAIR is doing more to stop hate since the areas of the country with the least amount od Diversity have the least number of Hate groups.In other words you will not find any Hate groups in Vermont because few Blacks or Hispanics live in Vermont.So it turns out that FAIR is doing more to end hate than the SPLC.The SPLC is in fact promoting hate by promoting legal and illegal immigration by non-whites.</p>

			<p>The Paranoia-Industrial Complex has to water down the definition of &#8220;hate&#8221; in order to state with a halfway straight face that there is more &#8220;hate,&#8221; so that its frequent donors can keep on donating, based on the assumption that this &#8220;rising tide of hate&#8221; will eventually engulf them.</p>
<p><i>The law center&rsquo;s report contends there is a link between anti-immigrant activism and the significant rise in hate crimes against Latinos in recent years. According to the latest FBI statistics, 819 people were victimized by anti-Latino hate crimes in 2006, compared with 595 in 2003.</i></p>
<p>I agree with the second sentence, but the perpetrators are disproportionately black, and in areas where blacks and (esp. Chicano/Mestizo) Hispanics co-exist.</p>

			<p>Mark Potoc is a hatemongering Bolshevik.  Bolshevik oppression has murdered tens of millions of innocent people.  They have to be dealt with just like the Nazis were as Bolshevism is the same coin as is Nazism but only the other side of the coin.  When I see our people being murdered, raped, and looted, it is the faces of people like Potok who I see as responsible.</p>

			<p>If hate crime laws were applied fairly, I&rsquo;m sure the statistics would also reflect a higher number of hate crimes commited AGAINST whites by the growing latino population. <br>
The fact that the SPLC is agreeing with an organization called the National Council of THE RACE, calls into question their supposed mission of erradicating hate groups (not to mention their agenda).</p>

			<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s another explanation for all this &#8220;white hate.&#8221;  We found out today from the NY Post that a Brooklyn man known for a lot of shady stuff alluding to a certain German dictator from the last century was working for the NYPD and the Mossad:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nypost.com/seven/03102008/news/regionalnews/nazi_thug_nitched_for_nypd_101259.htm" rel="nofollow">https://www.nypost.com/seven/03102008/news/regionalnews/nazi_thug_nitched_for_nypd_101259.htm</a></p>
<p>This matches similar stories from last year about similar groups in Florida that were headed and organized by FBI informants.</p>
<p>There was a Ph.D. thesis done by a George Mason University student a few years back that analyzed the relationship between Federal law enforcement and Paranoia-Industrial Complex groups (ADL, SPLC).  The thesis is that the former uses the latter for voyeuristic functions that the former is legally prohibited from doing, and the former &#8220;pays&#8221; the latter by creating these goober individuals and goober groups out of nothing, to give the latter examples of &#8220;hate&#8221; to pontificate about and raise money.  </p>

			<p>FAIR is a hate group? Wow, I never knew I was a member of a hate group.  I find it ironic that La Raza (the Race) a viciouos hate group whose founder called for the extermination of whites is considered a &#8220;civil rights&#8221; group but a group that simply calls for the end of an illegal activity (illegal immigration) is called a &#8220;hate group.&#8221;  I&rsquo;m glad to see that FAIR is fighting back against this smear job - I hope they sue the SPLC for defamation.  <br>
I&rsquo;ve said this before on this site but I will say it again - we need to cut off the funding for La Raza.  They are propped up with money from many of America&rsquo;s leading corporations: State Farm Insurance, J.C. Penney&rsquo;s, Hallmark, Ford, etc.  Here is what you need to do: 1) Go to La Raza&rsquo;s website, 2) Get the list of their Corporate Donors, and 3) write an e-mail or call these corporations and let them know that you refuse to do business with them until they stop funding this hate group (for good measure - include the founder&rsquo;s quote that &#8220;we must eliminate the Gringo&#8221;).  I have already done this and the typical response that I got was &#8220;We support diversity, blah, blah, blah.&#8221;  Maybe if enough of us let these companies know how we feel and stop giving them business, they will rethink their support of this hate group.</p>

			<p>I once emailed the SPLC, and asked them why LaRaza and MECHA weren&rsquo;t on their Hate Group list.  I explained to them that these two groups did nothing but spread hate and racism.  Needless to say, my email did not get a reply.</p>

			<p>Considering what it&rsquo;s like to LIVE next to illegal Mexican immigrants, I am ready to join a hate group myself? Can anyone supply an address?</p>
<p>Seriously, that old saw: TO KNOW THEM IS TO HATE THEM!   &mdash;   is certainly applicable to immigrants, particularly Mexican or Black African or Caribbean immigrants. Their mentality, their lifestyle cuts across our cultural mores like a knife.</p>
<p>But White people, at least MOST, don&rsquo;t booze it up all night, then urinate wherever they happen to be. And the yard stinks to high heaven   &mdash;   God will send rain to wash it away soon enough.</p>
<p>I would LOVE for every liberal to be required by law to live between two Mexican (or Black families). I would not give them six months before the last vestige of liberal thinking gets jettisoned for good.</p>

<p>&#8216;SPLC&rsquo; is a name that is misleading. People from the south, who live in poverty, are often some of the most ignorant, hateful, violent, bigoted, racist, and dangerous people on Earth. Real facts, like The Color of Crime, bear this out in lurid, if not true color, detail. The average person would never think of the true facts at all tho reading the term Southern Poverty Law Center. Who says you can&rsquo;t fool the people?<br>

			<p>This report highlights the SUPPOSED increase in violence against immigrants (no word on the REAL increase in violence committed by them). I don&rsquo;t even think liberals believe this stuff anymore. There&rsquo;s rampant racism and exclusion practiced against immigrants&hellip; and indeed there&rsquo;s dire danger to their very lives&hellip; and yet the proposed solution is to call for more immigrants. </p>

			<p>In my opinion the SPLC is a nothing but a subversive organization.  I would love to know where they are getting their staggering amounts of money ($200M) from.  My opinion is that it is primarily funded by lefties from the east and west coasts who are still Bolsheviks under the skin no matter how many years they have been in America.</p>
<p>And kudos to Dan Stein for standing up to the slanderous accusations from the SPLC!!!</p>

			<p>I went to the SPLC website and clicked on NV, my state. I used the site&rsquo;s tracker to see how many incidents of &#8220;hate&#8221; were in NV - there were 0. It defaults to 2008, so I tried 2007 - they listed 2, one in Reno and one in Las Vegas. I live in Las Vegas -this was the description:</p>
<p>     Las Vegas (Murder) <br>
Published on 10-07-2007<br>
&#8220;Michael Esquibel, 28, was charged with murder, attempted murder and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon for allegedly running down and killing a Mexican national.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Esquibel! A Spanish name - so a &#8220;hate&#8221; crime is anything against an illegal immigrant, even if committed by another Hispanic!!!!<br>

			<p> So a reasoned plea for immigration reform gets you labeled as a &#8220;hate group&#8221;?  Is discussion of this issue off-limits? To call FAIR a &#8220;hate group&#8221; shows that the SPLC is completely lacking in credibility. It is part of what the British call &#8220;the Looney Left.&#8221;</p>

			<p>The SPLC held a conference at Mississippi College in Jackson Ms. several years ago. I heard about it on the local radio station three hours before the conference was scheduled to start. I took a copy of Morris &#8220;The Pervert&#8221; Dees&rsquo; divorce decree to a Quick Print and had 300 copies made. A friend and I handed them out at both entrances with smiles and the statement that we were furnishing info on the founder, Mr. Dees. Everyone thought we were with the SPLC until they got to their seats and started to read. Needless to say it caused serious disruption and embarassment to &#8220;Mo&#8221; Dees and the SPLC, and it was great fun. Anytime they come to your area, google his divorce papers and have them printed and hand them out before the conference and watch them squirm. They can&rsquo;t handle this info anymore than a cockroach can handle light, shine the light of truth on them and they run. </p>

<p>I honestly don&rsquo;t know which is worse: the widely-propagandized bleat on the part of the FBI and their paranoid &#8220;information&#8221; providers that the US is awash in &#8220;hate&#8221; groups, or their obvious wish that it was true.</p>

			<p>We are being destroyed from within by these groups. They advocate racial supremacy for their own race yet this isn&rsquo;t racism? La Raza is a blatent supporter of illegal immigration yet out government does very little in curtail this. Blacks murder, rob and rape anybody they can including other blacks. Nothing is done about that either. But let a white mention either issue they are labeled as racist.</p>

			<p>The SPLC and Morris &#8220;Sleaze&#8221; Dees is nothing more than a money making shill faux/org. They go after white hate groups simply because that is where the money is. Over the years Dees has gone after the assets of groups like Aryan Nations, White Aryan Resistance and Tom Metzger to gain monetary compensation for alleged wrongs done to minorities but, to my memory not one dime has changed hands that didn&rsquo;t go from Morris Dees left hand to his right. Sleese is a very mild description of Mo Dees!</p>
<p>If I were placed on a hate list by an org. staffed by perverts, like the SPLC, I would put a bumper sticker on the truck and wear the label as a badge of honor! </p>

			<p>These people are ridiculous.  I even think that their shrill condeming cries are beginning to fall on deaf ears.  All we need do is look at our headlines and see who is killing, raping and otherwise hatefully persecuting who.  More and more whites, just aren&rsquo;t buying it.  Some time soon, it will become okay again for whites to have &#8220;self-help&#8221; organizations like the Black Panthers, La Raza, etc.  But it will be a while yet.  We may have to see how a black president excellerates anti-white persecution, either directly or indirectly before the finality of the fact becomes a general acknowledgement among whites.</p>

The SPLC loves to quote some cherry picked fringe comments as examples of &#8220;hate&#8221;; perhaps they could add these quotes from the university &#8220;mainstream&#8221;:<br>

			<p>Dear Fed Up:</p>
<p>Leave out the Hispanics. You are flat out wrong. Hispanics (specifically Mexicans) have time and again SAVED dying neighborhoods, re-vitalizing homes and businesses. They are good decent people whom I love and love to be with.<br>
Just remeber this: You can LIVE amid Hispanics. You CANNOT LIVE amid blacks.</p>

			<p>11:29 PM: Your mention of Hispanics &#8220;saving dying neighborhoods, re-vitalizing homes and businesses&#8221; leaves out the fact that these interlopers remake those &#8220;dying neighborhoods, re-vitalizing homes and businesses&#8221; in their own cultural image and they look more like Tijuana than the United States.  These invaders colonize rather than assimilate and Americans tend to prefer our own culture over that of Mexico&rsquo;s.  By invading our nation they have nothing to lose and a country to gain, while we have nothing to gain and a country to lose.  Maybe you can live among Hispanics, but these people turn the stomachs of most Americans and we want them to return to their own countries and stay there.  Blacks were brought to this country against their will, while Hispanic parasites invade this country against our will&hellip;     </p>

Posted by at 4:41 PM on March 14 </p>
<p>First off, no black alive today was brought to this country &#8220;against their will&#8221;. (Their ancestors were enslaved by other black Africans during incessant intertribal warfare, forced marched to the coast, and sold to traders in boats anchored off the coast. Those they could not sell, they ritualistically sacrificed. Finally, the blacks in America are better off than their brethren in Africa.) And every one of them is free to leave. They are in this country just like the rest of us: Born here. And a huge and growing proportion of blacks in the U.S. in fact are immigrants and &#8220;refugees&#8221; who freely came here from Africa and the Caribbean. <br>
What do you want to bet that given the choice you would live in an Hispanic neighborhood rather than a black neighborhood? Hispanic neighborhoods are among the safest. And that&rsquo;s what really counts. Otherwise, people can live their lives as they want, it&rsquo;s no one else&rsquo;s business. As a non-black you&rsquo;d have to live like Omega man in a typical black neighborhood.<br>
In any case, the VAST MAJORITY of white folks like and appreciate Hispanics. Even white folks with attitude like me. We whites, Asians, and Hispanics blend naturally. Even more and more WNs are beginning to realize this. The focus must be on the real enemy: Black racists and their white leftist enablers. As well as violent criminals (wildly disproportionately black). Anything else is a distraction. In a confrontation you must stay focused on the main threat: In this case a mortal threat (e.g. Chapel Hill, Auburn, &hellip;.). Listen to the ravings of Obama&rsquo;s black Nazi &#8220;minister&#8221;: THAT is the enemy.<br>
And guess what, I don&rsquo;t want Hispanics to &#8220;assimilate&#8221; to what has become of this country&rsquo;s culture (now dominated by degenerate moral values and black ghetto &#8220;culture&#8221;). Hispanic culture is the white culture of the &#8216;50&rsquo;s. God Bless them. The language, music, religion, and values are essentially European. Hispanics are more &#8220;white&#8221; than most whites I know. And Hispanics had settled in parts of what is today the U.S. before the Pilgrims.<br>
Only a handful of the most hardcore WNs have the attitude toward Hispanics you express. And our enemies appreciate you, for you keep us divided and distracted and ineffective. Lashing out at EVERYONE. (That is why many black racist imposters post anti-Hispanic comments on this site, posing as &#8220;WN&rsquo;s&#8221;. To take us off course. And to foment hatred against us.)</p>

			<p>1:06 AM: I teach mostly Hispanic kids, 3rd and 4th generation, and I love my students, but I am under no illusion that they are typical of their race.  Hispanics are not as violent as Blacks, true, they have a homicide rate only about five times as high as Whites.  As posters to this website know, government statistics conceal Hispanic criminality by counting them as White, but there are independent scholars who have sorted through the numbers.  By and large, they share all the social pathologies of Blacks, but to a lesser degree.  Just drive though a Hispanic neighborhood and look at all the bars on the windows and the graffiti on the walls.  No, that is NOT the White culture of the &rsquo;50s.  </p>

<p>Schoolteacher, I will present a lesson for you: Your statement about Hispanics having a homicide rate &#8220;five times&#8221; as high as whites, is WRONG. The Hispanic homicide rate is in line with the non-Hispanic white homicide rate. If your statement were true, then my hometown of El Paso, nearly 80% Mexican-Hispanic, mostly poor, would not be one of the SAFEST cities its size in the country. Check out the crime stats on www.city-data.com . The homicide rate is 1.5 per 100,000. (Note, schoolteacher, using this method of analysis, it matters not one twit how these homicides are categorized racially.) This homicide rate is but a tiny fraction that of cities of similar size like Seattle WA, Portland OR, Minneapolis MINN etc.). Hispanic crime, as has been pointed out by Justice Dept analysis, is disproportionately NON-violent in nature.<br>
To put things in REAL perspective, compare the homicide rate with any black city, like East Saint Louis ILL, Saint Louis MO, Atlanta GA, Detroit MICH, New Orleans LA, Philidelphia PENN, Washington DC, &hellip;. </p>

This is a federal conspiracy to brainwash the public into thinking that Hispanics are Saints.

When these predators invade our country they become emboldened and commit even more murders here than they did in Mexico&hellip;  </p>

<p>You apparently did not read my post very carefully: The www.city-data.com crime stats are not broken down by race. So it doesn&rsquo;t matter HOW the FBI classifies the perps. Listen carefully, for I&rsquo;m only going to say this ONE MORE TIME: If the Hispanic homicide rate were as high as some here allege, then a city like El Paso, almost entirely Hispanic, could not have one of the lowest OVERALL homicide rates for a city its size in the country. (You see? It doesn&rsquo;t matter using this method of correlation of crime and ethnicity/race HOW the perps are classified.) </p>
<p>&#8220;And thanks you for your astute observation that &ldquo;no black alive today was brought to this country &ldquo;against their will&rdquo;. I would have never guessed. I was under the impression that black slaves could still be bought at auction&hellip;.&#8221;<br>
Posted by at 12:01 PM on March 19 </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need your misplaced sarcasm: My point was blacks always bringing up how THEY were brought here &#8220;against their will&#8221; and use that like we owe them something. My response is to point out the obvious, which apparently is not obvious to those who keep on bring up the &#8220;against their will&#8221; mantra. I was responding to a poster who repeated that mantra.</p>
<p>You people are smarter than this. Please read carefully and think a little before you respond, brothers.</p>
