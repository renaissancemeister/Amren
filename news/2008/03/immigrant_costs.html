						<p>WASHINGTON &mdash; Illegal immigration is costing Arizona border counties millions a year for law enforcement and criminal prosecutions, diverting money from parks, libraries and other law-enforcement efforts, according to a study to be released today.</p>
<p>The costs to the four border counties in Arizona increased 39 percent, from $19.2 million in fiscal 1999 to $26.6 million in fiscal 2006, researchers at the University of Arizona and San Diego State University found.</p>
<p>For the nation&rsquo;s 24 border counties in Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas, the costs related to illegal immigration in fiscal 2006 were $192 million, more than double the costs in 1999.</p>
<p>The study was commissioned by the U.S./Mexico Border Counties Coalition, a non-profit group of border-county officials who want the federal government to reimburse their county jails and prosecutors offices for legal costs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Researchers estimate the costs of illegal immigration on county law enforcement borderwide at $1.2 billion in the past eight fiscal years.</p>
<p>Researchers examined county budgets, court records and crime statistics and interviewed hundreds of county officials for the report. The report did not look at the impact of illegal immigrants on cities, states or Indian tribes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The costs of illegal immigration are placing &#8220;undue burdens&#8221; on people who live in border counties, the report says. Urban counties bore the highest costs, with San Diego County in California spending the most at $77.1 million, followed by El Paso and Hidalgo counties in Texas and Pima and Yuma counties in Arizona.</p>
<p>Residents of three Texas counties &mdash; Hudspeth, Terrell and Zapata &mdash; carried the costliest per capita burden, with each resident paying about $378, $126 and $112, respectively, last year.</p>
<p>The costs came at the expense of other county services such as libraries, jails, courtrooms and parks, according to the report.</p>

			<p>How can the working man, if he&rsquo;s lucky enough to have not lost his job to an illegal, be expected to bear this burden?  Big business wants this cheap labor, and then the working man is expected to pick up the tab for all the little extras.  Not to mention, if these illegals are working in agriculture, tax dollars are also subsidizing the rich farmers, paying the illegals a non-livable wage, that is then subsidized by more tax dollars in entitlements.  What a vicious circle.</p>

			<p>What? How did that line go, again?</p>
<p>Immigrants PAY their share of taxes.<br>
Immigrants don&rsquo;t drive down wages.<br>
Immigrants just take those jobs Americans refuse to do.<br>
Immigrants don&rsquo;t commit any more crimes than anyone else.<br>
Immigrants don&rsquo;t get much in the way of government services or handouts.</p>
<p>So, once again, we hear the diametric opposite of those incessant claims. So explain, please. WHY do those pro-immigration lies sound so much like either an Obama or Clinton campaign promise?</p>

			<p>Arizona has been all but destroyed by Bill Clinton and Jorge Bush&rsquo;s reckless immigration policies  &mdash;   the *legal* immigration levels as much as the illegal problem.  I spent part of my childhood there and after visiting old friends in Arizona several times in recent years, I&rsquo;ve now vowed to never, ever go back.  Arizona is now basically a replica of the worst, most crime-ridden parts of Mexico, a no-man&rsquo;s land, and not just on the border  &mdash;   throughout the entire state.</p>
<p>Countless once-prosperous, White-majority neighborhoods in Arizona have been catastrophically overrun.  Gangs roam night and day, so much so that Arizona has now surpassed California as the top drug-trafficking site for street drugs and the Central American mafias that make money off them.  Crime has soared, trash litters the streets, vandalism defaces buildings and cars and businesses have all but collapsed.  It&rsquo;s worse even than downtown Detroit.  And again, I&rsquo;m not talking about just the border cities  &mdash;   I&rsquo;m talking about Tucson, Phoenix, Tempe, Mesa, Sun City and other once nice, medium-sized cities throughout the state.  </p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s only going to get much, much, much worse in Arizona.  Jorge Bush&rsquo;s policies have hit Arizona especially hard, while Janet Napolitano and her henchmen control the state government at all levels  &mdash;   a government basically founded on fulminant hatred of Arizona&rsquo;s White population.  Whites there are heavily taxed to pay for all this of course, and even strong attempts by the populace to improve the situation have been watered down into feebleness and insignificance by the government.  The bitter truth is, it&rsquo;s now far, far too late to reverse the damage  &mdash;   Arizona is gone.</p>
<p>I wonder sometimes why any White family would stay in Arizona anymore, and in fact when I speak to old friends, almost all of them have relocated to other states.  Many have headed for the Upper Mountain West states like Montana or Idaho.  Some have gone to Midwestern states such as Indiana, Ohio or Wisconsin.  Many have headed East to South Carolina, Tennessee or Pennsylvania.  A few have even joined this emigration wave of American Whites to ancestral European countries  &mdash;   three have been studying German and are soon moving their families to Germany (and Salzburg, Austria in one case), another is going to Italy, another to Finland.  That&rsquo;s what Bill Clinton, Jorge Bush and their corrupt plutocrats in both parties have brought us  &mdash;   a White minority-USA like South Africa in which Whites can no longer bear to stay in entire states, and in many cases are leaving the country altogether.</p>

			<p>This is probably one of the major factors that will lead to the de facto Balkanization of the US:  normal, tax-paying people will flee these counties and states, to be replaced by invaders.  </p>

			<p>New Jersey is a boader state too.  It is bankrupt and has already shut down three hospitals in the past year.  Two more hospitals may also be shut down and this is in a state with a growing population.  Yet, New Jersey has turned itself into a Illegal Sanctuary State that refuses to do anthing about illegal aliens.  Democrats are deliberatly trying to bankrupt America to force a Soviet Government on us.</p>

			<p>This is a little bit off topic, but thought I&rsquo;d mention it here. </p>
<p>For those of you out there who think they can improve their chances for getting a job by learning Spanish, forget it. I lived in Spain for some years and speak Spanish quite well. I had a nice little part-time job doing telephone work in English and Spanish. I&rsquo;ve just been laid off because now they only want native Spanish speakers. So, another American loses a job to an invader.   </p>

			<p> I hope I live long enough to see the day that a lawsuit is filed in a district federal court somewhere in this country.  A class action suit.  The plaintiffs - various state governments,  and the defendant - the US federal government.  The claim - negligence in serving the public trust.  Dereliction of duty.  The American people empower the federal government to protect its citizenry from invasion.  And they have failed in this trust.  Failure in abiding to its obligations as set forth in the US Constitution.  That&rsquo;s different then merely failing to accomplish a goal.  They have failed to protect because they did not attempt to even try.  America&rsquo;s very identity is at stake, its right to be a sovereign nation is deteriorating at an alarming rate.  And our leaders are asleep at the helm, fearful of even mentioning the words&#8221; illegal immigration&#8221;.</p>

			<p>If we don&rsquo;t build a HIGH impentratable WALL along the SW border and take extreme measures (like eliminating VISAS from visitors from Mexico(40% of illegal immigration is from those VISA &#8220;visitors&#8221;), there will be a fracturing of the Southwest and La Conquista will happen - allowing a new nation, Altzan to emerge, equally as poor as Mexico proper is now. Then how do we deal with them in states that aren&rsquo;t in Altzan?</p>
