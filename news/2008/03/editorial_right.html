<h1>Editorial: Rights and Wrong</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Press (Newport News), March 17, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The most obscene thing that has taken place on the campus of the College of William and Mary wasn&rsquo;t &mdash; despite what overwrought critics claimed &mdash; the recent Sex Workers&rsquo; Art Show.</p>
<p>No, it was the appearance last week of Jared Taylor. He was invited by students involved with a conservative campus publication that has indulged some pretty retrograde behavior (notably, publicizing the name of a woman who said she had been raped, along with speculative details of her sexual history).</p>
<p>Taylor&rsquo;s speech was billed as &#8220;anti-diversity,&#8221; but that mild label hardly does justice to his message, for Taylor is an unabashed racist and white supremacist, praised by the Ku Klux Klan.</p>
<p>He famously argued, after Hurricane Katrina, that &#8220;when blacks are left entirely to their own devices, Western Civilization &mdash; any kind of civilization &mdash; disappears.&#8221;</p>
<p>But in the end, while Taylor might be a blot on his own alma mater (Yale), he could do no harm to Thomas Jefferson&lsquo;s. For if there&rsquo;s one place that must hew to the principle that ideas, even revolting ideas, can&rsquo;t hurt, that open exchange can&rsquo;t be limited to ideas we agree with, it&rsquo;s the state where the Bill of Rights was born, the town where the underpinnings of this great experiment in democracy were first debated &mdash; with more heat than Taylor could spark.</p>
<p>Free speech didn&rsquo;t look so pretty to some when it was about pornography and prostitution. It&rsquo;s even uglier when it advocates bigotry. But in the end, society is better off for allowing people like Taylor their right to speak, even if it makes you queasy.</p>
<p>Taylor&rsquo;s speech also reminded us why it is so necessary that the Board of Visitors is committed to another of the college&rsquo;s principles: making the student body more diverse, economically and racially, and making higher education available to people who don&rsquo;t look like the group Taylor thinks are the only ones entitled to be in America: whites. Attaining diversity will take special effort and attention; it will not happen spontaneously so long as there are people like Taylor and his fellow travelers, whose notions of what this country should be about are small and ugly.</p>
