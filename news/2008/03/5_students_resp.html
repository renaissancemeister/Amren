<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>A Baltimore juvenile court judge found five Robert Poole Middle School students responsible yesterday in the December attack on a city bus passenger and her boyfriend, concluding a divisive case fraught with racial overtones.</p>
<p>Judge David W. Young&rsquo;s decision followed nearly two months of court hearings on the Dec. 4 fight in Hampden, described by several 911 callers as a riot. The attack prompted stricter safety standards on city buses and left Sarah Kreager, 26, with two broken bones around her left eye.</p>
<p>Nine black teens were initially accused of &ldquo;rising up en masse&rdquo; and attacking Kreager on the No. 27 bus after school had let out for the day.</p>
<p>Defense attorneys argued that Kreager&rsquo;s left eye was already bruised when she boarded the bus and that when the students began snickering at her, Kreager&rsquo;s boyfriend, Troy Ennis, ordered her &ldquo;to spit on them [racial slur].&rdquo;</p>
<p>But prosecutors said the youths attacked Kreager, who is white, after her boyfriend accused one of them of immaturity for refusing to relinquish an empty seat.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Four of the students were found involved &mdash; the juvenile equivalent of guilty &mdash; of first- and second-degree assault, reckless endangerment and conspiracy in the attack on Kreager. They also were found involved in reckless endangerment in the attack on Ennis.</p>
<p>A fifth student was found involved for the reckless endangerment of Kreager and for second-degree assault and reckless endangerment against Ennis.</p>
<p>Earlier in the case, a sixth teen had admitted hitting Kreager. Young delayed cases against three others; those cases are likely to be dismissed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>During closing statements, defense attorney Barbara Greene said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing like an ugly racial slur and a little spit to turn things ugly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And defense attorney Kimberly Thomas said her client was the victim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a victim sitting right here, your honor,&rdquo; she said, pointing to Nakita McDaniels, 15. &ldquo;A victim, and she&rsquo;s charged?&rdquo;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The five teens will learn their punishment April 3. The names of most of them are not being divulged because The Sun does not report the identities of juvenile offenders. But McDaniels&rsquo; name became public after she filed countercharges against Kreager in adult court, which prosecutors did not pursue.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But in the end, it was one of the accused&rsquo;s own statements to police that captured the hatred the students felt for Kreager, Hankin argued.</p>
<p>Police asked one of the boys, a 15-year-old, how he felt about &ldquo;the victims being assaulted? One being in the hospital?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy replied, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel no &hellip; I don&rsquo;t feel nothing.&rdquo;</p>

					<p>I would expect the city to respond to the racial tensions raised by the controversy, by denouncing hate and hiring a certain number of new black bus drivers, but all the <span class="caps">MTA </span>bus drivers are already black. There are plenty of other opportunities in Baltimore for justice and healing though.</p>

					<p>I admit I do get a rueful chuckle out of reading stories about black or latino teens attacking whites when the delinquents are referred to as &#8220;students&#8221;.  You can bet a year&rsquo;s pay that none of these &#8220;middle school students&#8221; can read above 2nd grade level if at all. However they do know that when caught, all they have to do is start lying and claiming whitey called them n_______s. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sick and tired of having these black&rsquo;s conduct being excused by leftist geeks like this lawyer claiming they were the recipient of a racial slur.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a common lie of course, but even if it weren&rsquo;t I&rsquo;m wondering how this miscreant thinks people are going to excuse a mass anti-white racial assault by claiming a name was called.</p>
<p>I way say she should go back to law school, but her problem with inability can&rsquo;t be corrected with more training.  It&rsquo;s not possible to make a silk purse out of a sow&rsquo;s ear.</p>

					<p>Back about 30 years ago my husband and I got lost in Baltimore&hellip;..and a black motorcycle cop pulled us over&hellip;and gave us an escort to the right route we should have been on.  I am thankful to that police officer&hellip;.if he wouldn&rsquo;t have helped us, Lord only knows what might have happened.  The population in that section of the city even way back then, was mostly black.  I can&rsquo;t imagine living in that city even back then, must be a million times worse now!</p>

					<p>First they claimed they were spit upon, when video tape refuted that claim, this is what they came up with instead.  No matter how violent blacks are towards whites, someone is always waiting in the wings to claim the perps were racially insulted, almost always it is a lie, but how sick is it, that they think words should justify a violent outburst anyway?</p>

					<p>I grew up in Baltimore City and attended Baltimore City schools, fortunately when they were still predominantly white.  I didnt&rsquo; attend school with blacks until I hit high school. Oh, except for the one year in elementary school in 1963 when all the busing really got started.  That year was a horrible year for me and the rest of the students at our school.  I remember that the 2 sixth grade teachers at the time, refused to teach them and threatened to walk out of school.  </p>
<p>But in any event, I feel sad for the place I grew up because I remember so many fun times, when you could still ride the buses and feel safe and when you could ride your bike anywhere you wanted.  </p>
<p>But I also remember the riots in BAltimore after <span class="caps">MLK </span>was killed and saw the stores that my parents and grandparents shopped at for years, looted and robbed.  And National Guardsmen who told my Dad that they couldn&rsquo;t have bullets in their guns and were ordered to just stand and watch as angry blacks carried away furniture, etc.  I remember a 7:00 o&rsquo;clock curfew for whites.</p>
<p>And I remember my Dad saying that if we thought the race riots were bad then, we could expect it in the future but even worse.  That any country that would deliberately give into demands as easily as our politicians did in the 60&rsquo;s, was just asking for problems.   Was my Dad right?  He sure as hell was!!!</p>

					<p>One way to get the sentence reduced or to be aquitted is to falsely say that the Whites used &#8220;racial epithets&#8221;. It is a lie of course, but that&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s needed.<br>
So the White is guilty and the black is innocent. Nothing new here.<br><br>

					<p>The victims were just lucky the bus had a surveillance camera.  If it hadn&rsquo;t been there, the pathological liars who attacked them would have probably been able to make their &#8220;Poor Little Black Me&#8221; sob-story stick.</p>
<p>The good news is that the technology behind surveillance equipment gets better and cheaper every year, so that stuff is turning up in more and more places.</p>
<p>If it is legal in your area, always carry a can of the extra-strength pepper spray made for hikers to use on bears.  It happens to work quite a treat on people.</p>

<p>Even though it was claimed she was ordered &ldquo;to spit on them [racial slur].&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t see any claim that she actually did.</p>
<p>Of course we should have all known that the attack was justified. We have to remember that hate crimes and racial slurs committed by Whites are a corporal, maybe even a  capital offense. It is the duty of the Black community to carry out the punishment, because as we all know that is the only way a Black person can get justice here in  the most racial hate filled country on earth, according to Rev. Wright anyway.  </p>

<p>Probably nothing would have happened. Thirty years ago you were dealing with a different class of Blacks. Thirty years ago, there was no gangster rap to speak of. Thirty years ago, Black parents still boxed their kids ears for misbehaving. Thirty years ago, that police officer was still feared and respected. </p>

					<p>     I agree with <span class="caps">DRIFTER.</span> The blacks I grew up with were just as civilized as we were. Every black family in my hometown owned their own home, had a working father present, had two children per family ( One family had three kids, but one was a change-of-life baby and was 10 years younger than his siblings) went to church, dressed and talked just like we did, and never got into trouble. They hung around with us and I don&rsquo;t think we ever really thought, that except for skin color, they were different than we were. Hell, what happened to change all of that ? Answer that question and you may solve on of our biggest problems.</p>

<p>With all due respect, Drifter, 30 years ago I was in high school in a big Midwestern city, and every school there that had blacks had out-of-control white on black attacks.  And, just as today it wasn&rsquo;t possible to walk through a black neighborhood without being assaulted or killed. I have no doubt that Baltimore and some of the Eastern Seaboard cities were worse, as was Houston and Calif out West.</p>
<p>Thefts were an every day occurrence for those of us who lived on the periphery of a black area, not too close to them either.  And &#8220;no&#8221; it wasn&rsquo;t whites doing the stealing.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been told that in my mother&rsquo;s time it was possible to walk through a black neighborhood without worrying about being attacked, assaulted or murdered, but I doubt that was the case.  I&rsquo;m sure it was better, however.  Much better, but then if blacks unjustly attacked whites they would be hunted down and stomped, as they should have been.</p>
<p>There would be no problem with them today if whites would rise up and demand and eye for any eye, etc&hellip;&hellip;..make them accountable for their crimes.</p>
<p>I doubt that only the people here are aware that if whites would join an org. like the European American organization and physically march and raise holy hell every time there was a massacre as in Memphis or Wichita or a bus attack like this one, we could put the skids to black on white crime, and if it wouldn&rsquo;t stop then, we would have the politicians finally rising up to support us, and we could then form protectve groups for self defense.</p>
<p>Take heart in this observation:  It appears, with a little pushing from us, this Obama thing is going to give us about 7 more months of railing against black on white racism and crime, so it is very possible we could be really successful in pursuing our agenda right now.</p>

					<p>&#8220;Judge David W. Young&rsquo;s decision followed nearly two months of court hearings on the Dec. 4 fight&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="caps">FIGHT</span>? This implies &#8220;mutual combatants&#8221;. This was not a fight. It was a vicious, non-instigated assault against a clearly outnumbered lone white lady by a large group of racist blacks. We saw the same thing in Jena, and the media again chose to use the word &#8220;fight&#8221;. They are very clever in the words they use. They are masters of linguistics and in the use of grammatical manipulation to mold opinions to their leftist ideology. Especially when downplaying black-on-white atrocities. You can bet that had nine whites assaulted a lone black lady, the media would have surely found another word to use besides calling it a &#8220;fight&#8221;. That communist fraud Rosa Parks was merely arrested for having failed to give up her seat to a white man, and she became a media darling and civil rights icon, complete with allowing her body to lie in honor in a rotunda of the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> Capitol upon death. Something historically reserved for <span class="caps">U.S. </span>presidents and Supreme Court justices. Sarah Kreager gets her eyesocket crushed for failing to give up her seat to a gang of blacks and she becomes an afterthought in the media. By categorizing this as a mere &#8220;fight&#8221;, the media reduces her ordeal to the level of a drunken brawl at the local pub. Just once, I would like to hear the decision makers in the media explain (and attempt to justify) their hypocrisy in reporting.</p>

<p>Yes, I am sure this is quite true and it was not a &#8220;Leave it to Beaver&#8221; world 30 years ago. But theft is an economic crime. What we are faced with today, are senseless attacks that have no basics other than hatred of Whites. Any theft or sexual assault that take place today is secondary to the fact that the victim is White.  </p>

<p>This is standard operating practice of the leftwing media to downplay black racial atrocities. This is how they characterize the ambush from behind of a lone white student in Jena <span class="caps">LA, </span>who was knocked unconscious then kicked and stomped on the head as he lay helpless on the ground until blood gushed from his mouth and ears. (And then they falsely tie this racial attack to a false &#8220;noose&#8221; incident many months earlier that had nothing to do with anyone involved in this attack.) <br>
And in Kansas City MO some years back, after a black police officer shot a black suspect, black racist mobs attacked non-black motorists passing 27th and Benton, including dragging a Chinese motorist out of his car, which they overturned and set on fire, and proceeded to viciously beat the Chinese man. Later &#8220;Kansas City Star&#8221; articles, in typical lying fashion, would refer back to all this as simply a &#8220;melee between youths and police&#8221;.</p>

					<p><b>Toronto</b> also experiences more than its&rsquo; share of <b>Black crime</b> on our own city buses according to this photo. But look at <i>how</i> these Black thugs are described here. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.liveleak.com/view?i=825_1200784339" rel="nofollow">https://www.liveleak.com/view?i=825_1200784339</a></p>
<p>Thirty-five years ago, Canada&rsquo;s largest city had no problem with Black people&hellip;simply because we didn&rsquo;t have the numbers (less than 1%). Instead, liberal policy makers went ahead and spoiled a good thing by opening the immigration doors to thousands of uneducated, low-skilled workers (domestic workers, nannies, kitchen help, etc) from <b>the Caribbean</b>. Now we see the results of that disastrous decision every day as the above link depicts. </p>
<p>We blissfully took our own city for granted back in the early &rsquo;70s &hellip;  but not American visitors! They used to marvel at the cleanliness and relative safety of &#8216;Toronto the Good&rsquo;. Of course, many of us didn&rsquo;t understand at the time, but the word &#8216;safety&rsquo; was code for &#8220;<i>I don&rsquo;t see any blacks on your streets</i>&#8221;.</p>
<p>Now all that &#8220;goodness&#8221; has slowly disintegrated, placing Toronto on par with some <span class="caps">U.S. </span>cities that show Black crime rates to be exceedingly high to their actual population numbers. Such a pity!</p>

					<p>These are the streets of American cities, they are under the control of black thugs and criminals, these many years of liberalism, liberal judges, political correctness, etc. etc. have turned areas all over America into no-go zones for whites, some areas police only go when in numbers. Streets of the greatest country in the history of the world.</p>

<p>&gt; I have reviewed the site that this poster links over to.  On the fact of it, I have to raise a little alarm;  It is very dangerous to advocate this sort of overt takeover - which is basically domestic terrorism on the web.  It is inviting the <span class="caps">FBI </span>to investigate and they <span class="caps">CAN </span>find out who is behind a website.  While I can sympathize with the emotions of what is behind this to a degree, the only situation that this scenario could take place is in the face of a failed or nearly failed central government.  This may be one man&rsquo;s (or group&rsquo;s) fantasy war game site but it appears serious.  </p>
<p>The real solution and only real option for whites in the face of growing anti-white crime is to educated ourselves and learn how to defend ourselves as individuals.</p>
<p>I lived in the Balkans for two years in the late 1990s and I saw things close up.  I have also studied Balkan history in detail.  The subject is very complicated and a certain bad choice for the author to use in illustrating racial cleansing tactics.  My guess is that the author choose Yugoslavia because it is one that he thought safe to utilize because there is so little real knowledge of the history and a relatively muted world response to it compared for example to <span class="caps">WW2 </span>ethnic cleansing of Jews.  But he gets it all wrong all the same.</p>
<p>The history of the Balkans, Yugoslavia and the breakdown of the state is very complicated.  It is not about racism, but more about religion and suppressed peoples - all of whom were once ethnic groups of empire.</p>
<p>The author praises the international criminal &#8220;Arkan&#8221; as a national hero of Serbia.  I assure you that he is not that at all.  He was a racketeer, embezler, assassin and psychotic thug who used the breakdown of Yugoslavia for his own gain.  I never knew a Serb who approved of him.  When Milosevic was invading Bosnia-Herzegovina it was to counter an invasion by Croatia.  Arkan and his paramilitaries set about killing Bosnians with the tacid approval of Milosevic, but as he did, he also looted the homes of absent Serbs - who had fled the chaos.  What good is it to have your own ethinicity do the things no Bosnian had until then done?  When Arkan was killed, it was a hit from within the Yugoslav government.  I remember well that everyone drank a shot of slivovec in celebration.</p>
<p>The author of the website claims to know history and even has a couple books on Yugoslavia he got some important basics all wrong.  These are; Yugoslavia was never part of the Soviet Union - Marshall Broz Tito pointedly resisted control from Moscow and instead formed the Non-Aligned Nations movement which still exists today and includes countries like India, Brazil, Cuba, and many African, South American and Asian Island nations; Albanians are whites, they happen to be Muslims and have a distinct language from Serbian and the other South Slav tongues.  Albanians existed in their region long before the Slavs arrived in the 5th and 6th centuries - it was the Ottoman Turks 15th century invasion that eventually created Muslim conclaves in the Balkans.  How or why the Albanians became Muslim, I am not sure.  Many Albanians look like Greeks, but also it is possible to see many blondes among them - just as many as Serbs.  This was not a racial cleansing effort, but an ethnic/religious war with nationalist overtones.<br>
The Bosnians were systematically created by the Turks who forcebly fathered children with Serbian women to be raised Muslim.  The Turks gave those children positions of local power when they grew up and they retained special privileges by doing that.</p>
<p>I apologize for this post as it seems well off the subject.  But the link provided will be reviewed by some I think.  I always write that still am of the opinion that we must only do what is lawful in defending oursleves as long as we have a government of laws.  I also think that it is important to not fill ourselves with false histories and myths.  That makes us as dishonest and failure prone as those who oppress us.  </p>

<p>Exactly!  I am really worried about what might happen if McCain beats the Great Black Hope.  I live in a section of northern Virginia where whites are the minority, and my mom lives in Alexandria near black public housing projects.  Thank god Virginia has good gun laws; I&rsquo;m planning to take a firearms course this summer to make sure I am prepared to defend my family in the event of &#8220;civil disturbance&#8221;.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read that ammunition prices have increased in a last few weeks, so we may not be the only people who have had this thought&hellip;</p>

					<p>Perhaps the answer is to have separate buses for whites and blacks.  There is enough evidence to justify this isn&rsquo;t there?  Certainly has the potential to save the city a lot of cash for litigation.   Or to have big bouncers on the buses armed with tasers.  What is the answer</p>

					<p>This attack was not a lone one. About this same time, there was a rash of assaults on <span class="caps">MTA </span>buses. They do not appear to have been directly connected, having been perpetrated by different attackers against different victims and in different parts of the city (one did take place not-to-far from the Kreager beating though).</p>
<p>There were, however, two common threads: all took place on buses, and all were cases of gangs of black youths attacking lone or greatly outnumbered white people. The Kreager case got by far the most attention. Primarily, I think, because there was a gory after-beating photo of the poor woman with her eye socket crushed. Even lefty, apologist news outlets like <span class="caps">WJZ </span>tv and The Baltimore Sun are subject to the bottom line, and gory photos are a guarantee of ratings and paper sales.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m from Baltimore. And not thirty years removed, either (it wasn&rsquo;t even thirty years ago when I was born there). I spent most of my adult life so far working there, and for a time living there. In predominately black neighborhoods, I might add. Despite all of the ugliness I&rsquo;ve seen there, I still love the city and want to see what&rsquo;s best for her. But she just keeps getting worse. </p>
<p>My current fear for the city: a gang of young black thugs attack or excessively intimidate some white woman on a bus or light rail, and in fear she blows one of their heads off. Subsequent will be either the legal railroading of an innocent woman trying to defend herself, or the mass looting/rioting/general razing of the city by its diversity, or both.</p>

					<p>During the LA riots of 1992, I was asked by co-workers where the best place to buy a gun was.</p>
<p>My reply was a paraphrase of a famous southern woman who said, &#8220;We don&rsquo;t buy our hats, we <strong>have</strong> our hats.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&rsquo;t buy our guns, we have our guns,&#8221; I explained.</p>
<p>Permanently disallowed firearms by federal law, I built a coilgun last year.  Since it isn&rsquo;t legally a &#8220;gun&#8221;, it also isn&rsquo;t legally a &#8220;machinegun.&#8221;  Power is from a sodium-sulfur bus battery on an <span class="caps">ALICE </span>frame, through a homopolar generator.</p>
<p>By all means, buy firearms, but make sure you have a decent rifle.  Spend as much on spare magazines as you spent on the rifle.  For Civil War Two, an allowance of 30,000 rounds would be adequate for someone who wasn&rsquo;t looking for trouble.  A simple firearms course will not be an adequate substitute for decades of recreational shooting, but it is better than nothing.</p>

<p>Excellent reference, Plastic Flower.  Thanks for the info.</p>
<p>I see nothing there that is an advocation of unilateral  violence or a call to arms, so it is well within the dictates of the First Amendment.  If it were not, it would never have survived on the internet.  There are publications in print by non-whites that are far more provocative than this.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an excellent piece of work.  <br>
