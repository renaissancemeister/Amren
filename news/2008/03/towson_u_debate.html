<h1>Towson U. Debaters Take National Championship</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nick Madigan, Baltimore Sun, March 26, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The two members of Towson University&rsquo;s debate team happily accepted congratulations yesterday after winning a national championship &mdash; the Cross Examination Debate Association&rsquo;s five-day tournament in Wichita, Kan. &mdash; and making history by being the first African-Americans to do so.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But what made the duo&rsquo;s achievement not only remarkable but groundbreaking was that they had turned debate traditions upside down deciding not to argue their chosen topic &mdash; whether the United States &#8220;should constructively engage with a Middle East country.&#8221; Instead, in a direct challenge to the judges and the system under which they operate, the pair made their central premise the notion that, as Cooper said, &#8220;the problems of exclusion in the debate community need to be addressed first.&#8221;</p>
<p>By that, Cooper said, he meant the &#8220;racism, sexism and homophobia&#8221; that pervade the kind of tournament at which they were speaking. &#8220;We have a responsibility to talk about these things,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We talk about racism the most because it&rsquo;s the one we&rsquo;re most affected by. Even at awards banquets, they make jokes that the community laughs at, but the people who they affect don&rsquo;t laugh.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition, Cooper and Love used various forms of expression, including hip-hop, clips of songs and &#8220;spoken word,&#8221; to accentuate their points, a far cry from the more straightforward, evidence-laden presentations of some of their competitors.</p>
<p>&#8220;They debate in a style that is definitely outside the conventions of most teams,&#8221; said Darren Elliott, president of the Cross Examination Debate Association, which oversees policy debate competitions for two- and four-year colleges in the country. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a very nontraditional style. That was clearly their strength.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elliott, who is director of the debate program at Kansas City Kansas Community College, said the Towson team showed courage in trying to &#8220;engage the community in changing how we talk about things, how we deal with these issues of race and sex and socioeconomic class.&#8221; In doing so, Elliott said, Love and Cooper confronted their judges, the tournament&rsquo;s organizers and other debaters by &#8220;telling them that what they&rsquo;re doing is not as productive as some alternatives.&#8221;</p>
