						<p>Laurence Alvin Lovette Jr., 17, faces two counts of first-degree murder, but he is too young to face the death penalty.</p>
<p>Authorities formally charged Lovette on Friday in the shootings of Duke University graduate student Abhijit Mahato and UNC-Chapel Hill student body president Eve Carson. Demario James Atwater had already been charged in Carson&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>Because Lovette is younger than 18, he is ineligible for capital punishment, even though he is charged as an adult. Jim Woodall, district attorney for Orange and Chatham counties, has not yet decided whether to pursue the death penalty against Atwater.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police have released few details about the Carson case. Carson was found dead near campus March 5.</p>
<p>Investigators say Lovette or Atwater shot her several times and tried to use her ATM card. Police also say Lovette drove her 2005 Toyota Highlander about the time of the crime.</p>
<p>On Friday, Tracey Cline, a Durham prosecutor, offered new details about how police connected Lovette to Mahato&rsquo;s killing. Mahato, a 29-year-old engineering student from Bengal, India, was found shot Jan. 18.</p>
<p>Cline said in court Friday that investigators discovered Mahato&rsquo;s stolen cell phone was used to call Atwater. Atwater, 21, of Durham has not been charged in Mahato&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>Cline also said that Lovette had other property of Mahato&rsquo;s. And a vehicle tied to Mahato&rsquo;s slaying was seen at a residence Lovette visited often, she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A hearing for both Lovette and Atwater in the Carson case is scheduled for March 24 in Hillsborough. Lovette has a hearing in the Durham case scheduled for March 27.</p>

			<p>Maybe the DA should consult a cleric on whether the death penalty is a proper charge to prefer against Atwater. I hear a certain Rev. Wright is recently retired, he should have some time on his hands.</p>

&#8220;Because Lovette is younger than 18, he is ineligible for capital punishment, even though he is charged as an adult. Jim Woodall, district attorney for Orange and Chatham counties, has not yet decided whether to pursue the death penalty against Atwater.&#8221;</p>
<p>What a joke. When one hears the &#8220;news&#8221; reporting that a murderer &#8220;may&#8221; face the death penalty &#8220;if convicted&#8221; it would be funny were it not so outrageous. </p>
<p>The greater outrage, though, is that of the corrupt political-legal system that calls it to question. </p>

<p>Old enough to kill? Then he&rsquo;s old enough to die. I&rsquo;ve heard nothing good about North Carolina&rsquo;s willingness to use the death penalty though, so this isn&rsquo;t a surprise. I expected better from a southern state.</p>

			<p>Of course it was a given that Mr. Lovette would not face the death penalty.  The Supreme Court, in all its wisdom, declared from On Low that a person under the age of 18 cannot possibly pre-meditate a murder to the extent that he or she should face execution.  Using that logic, why punish them at all for Murder 1st?</p>

			<p>If you put a black man in prison for life for such a vicious crime, it makes no impact on him, or the ghetto community.  Put him to death - and all of his ilk will get an instant message.<br>

			<p>Of course I knew that they can&rsquo;t give the &#8220;clown-thug&#8221; death, but every time I think of this case it absolutely infuriates me.  Rest assured that they won&rsquo;t try for the death penalty against the other monster either, as that would upset the black criminal loving community.    </p>

			<p>This creature will spend 8 years in prison. Receiving three meals each day that are better than the ones that are provided to your kids in school, better health care than you have (including dental &amp; optical), all the social workers and phychologists tax payer&rsquo;s money can provide and an endless buffet of weight training and exercise equipment along with basketball programs and other sport related activities to keep him occupied. Eventually, he will land a job wiping off tables in the chow hall and receive wages from this to purchase items from the prisoner store-pop, candy, after-shave, cigarettes etc. He will have access to a massive library with a legal department available (provided that he is able to read) in which he can file grievances against staff who look at him wrong and suit against the tax payers of the state when he gets really bored. Finally, he can attend services to bring him closer to &#8220;god&#8221;. Allah most likely as it is the predominant religion of blacks in prison. Once this spiritual transformation is complete, liberals will begin contacting the state Governor who will pardon him and he will be free once again. Mind you this process will cost the tax payers of his state approximately $30,000 each year. <br>

			<p>The Carson murder finally appeared on the radar of my local NPR station.  The report made no reference to race and named only one suspect, Laurence Lovette, Jr.  Why would the juvenile be cited and not the adult?  If loath to taint a jury, wouldn&rsquo;t you leave both unnamed?  Because &#8220;Demario Atwater&#8221; is racially charged!  This is the same station that, in a recent series &#8220;Search for Safe Town,&#8221; objected to the phrase &#8220;black on white&#8221; crime and, mysteriously, &#8220;black on black,&#8221; as well.  To put it most crudely, media descend into madness because they can not admit that for decades the &#8220;rednecks&#8221; have been right.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, as Walter Cronkite would put it, the way it is. </p>

<p>North Carolina seems to impose the death penalty often. Of course as we all know the impression one picks up from the news is usually quite the opposite of actual reality. Irregardless of using the death penalty or not, or what one thinks of imposing it on minors, North Carolina has a lot of really good laws on the books. Video gambling is outlawed, predatory &#8216;payday&rsquo; lending is outlawed, heck, you can&rsquo;t even sell your used car without having the government inspect it first. Things are changing here though. The state &#8216;lottery&rsquo; was passed recently. North Carolina was one of the last states to hold out. Things are changing, but I wouldnt be surprised if liberals one day bring back a lot of common sense laws. At least, ones that protect peoples money, from companies.  </p>

<p>Not as much as our Representative Danny Davis:</p>
<p>http://federaltimes.com/index.php?S=3160847</p>
<p>&#8220;&ldquo;The federal government is one of the places that has not been doing enough to help give people a second chance,&rdquo; said Rep. Danny Davis, D-Ill. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t lead where we haven&rsquo;t been.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Davis said he&rsquo;s considering introducing a bill early next year to make the federal workplace more felon-friendly. <br>
Davis said agencies should work with federally and locally funded rehabilitation programs to hire recently released felons as a way to help them reintegrate into society and reduce recidivism. Justice Department statistics show more than 50 percent of convicted felons offend again. Davis thinks giving some of them government jobs could reduce that number. <br>
&ldquo;We are contradictory in our practices,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We talk redemption, but the way we treat individuals does not show that we believe in providing redemption.&rdquo; </p>

			<p>NC is not a &#8220;Southern&#8221; state. It is a Northern state with a mild climate, high taxes, Chicago style Democratic Party machinery politics, and an ever increasing virulent presence of La Raza. Durham is like a Cleveland, Ohio with a Harvard University within its city limits and neigboring Orange County is like Beserkely, Kalifornicado.</p>

			<p>I can tell you as a &#8220;white&#8221; child of Eastern European immigrants (who never had slaves at any time) that has moved to the South.  The &#8220;white guilt&#8221; in the South is outrageous!  These people bend over backwords to run away from all things redneck, but my experience tells me the &#8216;rednecks&rsquo; are mostly right about crime, work ethic and who are really the racists.  Black-on-white crime outnumbers white-on-black crime 100:1 in North Carolina!  And, if you&rsquo;ve never been snubbed by someone black who won&rsquo;t speak to white people, go to Charlotte, NC and open a door for a man or woman wearing traditional African dress.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s far worse in the cities and African-Americans in the country are generally very good people (around 90%), but I can tell you some really flaunt their status as &#8220;protected citizenry&#8221; (usually welfare recipients) and are bold and in-your-face-calling-you-a-racist if you cross them for any reason.</p>

<p>I guess the trick is to stay away from the big cities. Make that, stay away from blacks. Else you&rsquo;ll find yourself deconstructing your own society and passing all kinds of crazy laws, all in an effort not to appear &#8216;racist&rsquo;.

			<p>This story outrages me. I know what it is like to live in North Carolina- Charlotte, to be exact. You have a large group of blacks who absolutely hate whites. They don&rsquo;t even try to hide it at all. The blacks will make all sorts of derogratory comments right to your face! They don&rsquo;t care! I lived there for a year. Moved close to Lowe&rsquo;s Speedway. We were in the second phase of a development. Beautiful houses, but the city/county decided to clean up the downtown area right after we moved there. Nothing better than huge condos in sky high rises to boost the economy of downtown Charlotte- where the white folks want to live! What to do about those pesky blacks living in slums downtown? No big deal- just give them section 8 vouchers and move them into the suburbs! What an eye opening experieince to see our subdivision receiving these wonderful residents! Happy, Happy, Joy, Joy to see their hoopties driving by, bass music pouding at all hours, big black women with curlers in their hair at all times of the day and night, our grocery store installing no less than a camera for every grocery row with signs that the store does NOT cash welfare checks. It got to the point where I would not set foot outside at dark unless I absolutely had to! We sold the house and took a loss of $15K, but our safety and peace of mind are PRICELESS! The blacks in North Carolina have an attitude like no other blacks I have EVER seen. My husband is from Baltimore and even their blacks aren&rsquo;t as bad! This thug is no different from the North Carolinian Blacks I came in contact with! This poor student didn&rsquo;t follow my example and stay in at night. If she had she might still be alive today! WHITES ARE NOT SAFE IN A BLACK NEIGHBORHOOD AT NIGHT!!!! I now live near Melbourne Florida and it is getting bad here. No where near what Charlotte, Baltimore or dear God my hometown of Orlando is like, but we are hostages at night. Do NOT set foot out at night if there are ANY BLACKS roaming your neighborhood. Even my 11 year old son knows that! When are whites going to wake up and take their neighborhoods back? </p>

			<p>Remember that this white coed, Eve Carson, is dead, just like the other white coed in Auburn GA, and just like an ever-growing body count of other white females you&rsquo;ll never know about, because they were indoctrinated that to indicate any &#8220;fear&#8221; of black males was indicative of their unfair &#8220;baseless white racism and prejudice&#8221;.<br>
And we just heard Obama condemn his white grandmother (who actually raised him, unlike his black father who abandoned him) because she once commented regarding her nervousness about black male strangers. Obama compared this completely reasonable and well founded comment of his grandmother to the hateful racist bile bellowed by Obama&rsquo;s 22 year black Nazi minister, mentor, intimate friend, and advisor! So Obama just added to the propaganda that is getting so many impressionable naive white girls raped and killed!</p>
<p>(And how ironic, because even Jesse Jackson, in a rare moment of honesty, admitted the same fear Obama&rsquo;s grandmother confessed to him: That when walking along a street, if he hears a group of male youths coming up from behind, he is always relieved when he turns and sees that they are white and not black!)<br>

<p>*If the media didn&rsquo;t ignore the sky-high Black on White crime rate going on in this country. All this politically correct brainwashing wouldn&rsquo;t work. There is absolutely nothing wrong with admitting Blacks have a far greater propensity towards crime. They are only 13% of the population, yet fill up half our US prisons. Many Blacks refuse to even admit the enormity of Black criminality, and instead blame the White judicial system, saying they are unfairly prosecuted. Let them try and hide from reality as usual. I just hope Whites and non Blacks in general are smart enough not to do the same. Self preservation should be an instinctive thing, and nobody should appologize for looking out for themselves, or the safety of their family members. Better to be politically incorrect, than another victim of Black crime.*</p>

			<p>&#8220;Many Blacks refuse to even admit the enormity of Black criminality, and instead blame the White judicial system, saying they are unfairly prosecuted.&#8221;</p>
<p>Real statistics never back them up. That&rsquo;s why we never hear them. Whites who commit crimes are much more likely to be caught/arrested. </p>

			<p>I live close to Charlotte and EVERY SINGLE DAY, there are multiple robberies and murders there, ALWAYS commited by black thugs.  Recently a 12 year old black boy was killed at a birthday party held at a hall.  There were 300 people there, but no one will come forward to identify the culprit.  These people don&rsquo;t even care about their own.</p>
<p>I have been absolutely sick over the deaths of these students.  </p>

			<p>I left Georgia because of the double standard. The blacks are out of control with their whining about mistreatment. Killing whites doesn&rsquo;t seem to bother them.</p>

			<p>A Supreme Court decision a couple of years ago ruled that 17 year olds cannot be put to death.  The decision was authored by Justice Kennedy who relied largely on foreign law.  Think the ability of a president to appoint justices in not important?</p>

			<p>Just moved to North Mecklenburg County (N.Charlotte). I carry my pistol EVERYWHERE in this county, about 95% of the time. Its too bad that Miss Carson didnt arm herself, for if she did she might be alive today. As for the perp, I think Eve&rsquo;s parents should be the ones allowed to hang these cowards.</p>
