<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>The Bush administration yesterday renewed its drive to crack down on U.S. companies that hire illegal immigrants by slightly altering an earlier initiative stalled by a federal judge since last September.</p>
<p>If the new proposal satisfies the court, the government could begin warning 140,000 employers in writing as early as June about suspect Social Security numbers used by their employees and force businesses to resolve questions about their identities or fire them within 90 days.</p>
<p>The result could intensify an economic and political debate over the administration&rsquo;s immigration policies in the months leading up to November&rsquo;s elections for president and Congress.</p>
<p>The mailings, known as &#8220;no-match&#8221; letters, were enjoined by U.S. District Judge Charles R. Breyer in San Francisco while he hears a lawsuit brought by a wide-ranging coalition of major American labor, business, farm and civil liberties groups.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs, including the AFL-CIO, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Civil Liberties Union, allege that the plan will cause major workplace disruptions and discriminate against legal workers, including native-born Americans.</p>
<p>A systematic effort to wean the U.S. economy off an estimated 8.7 million illegal workers has long been blocked by economic interests and civil rights concerns. But the Bush administration considers that effort the linchpin of its immigration enforcement efforts.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Critics have noted that the Social Security Administration&rsquo;s inspector general has concluded the database used to cull suspicious numbers contains erroneous records on 17.8 million people, 70 percent of whom are native-born U.S. citizens. Even if the actual error rate of no-match letters is far lower, labor leaders say that unscrupulous employers will use the rule to burden or harass anyone who looks or sounds foreign.</p>

					<p>It will cause some workplace disruptions. What of it? We are talking about the law here. After the employers find that the slave labor, and their corporate wellfare is coming to a close, they will, <span class="caps">SURPRISE, </span>have to raise wages and hire Americans, thereby, actually following the law. Only reconquistas and corrupt Senators would find this concept difficult to grasp.</p>

					<p>Yeah, that San Francisco judge is a loon, big deal.  Major progress has been made in AZ and <span class="caps">OK. </span> I really believe the tide is turning.  People are waking up to the joys of diversity.</p>

					<p>Yeah, after seven years of unending &#8220;Mexicans Without Borders,&#8221; now El Presidente&rsquo; Bush decides to do something. Thousands of drunk driving deaths, destroyed hospitals, wrecked schools and we supposed to clap our approval.</p>
<p>Sheesh.</p>

					<p>Sounds like our great government is still dragging their heels. I have no doubt that government will do its usual nothing. They are just delaying everything until after the elections. Then its back to sweeping it under the rug and a return to business as usual.</p>

					<p>&#8220;The Bush administration yesterday renewed its drive to crack down on <span class="caps">U.S. </span>companies that hire illegal immigrants by slightly altering an earlier initiative stalled by a federal judge since last September.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Hsu (proud Irishman) opens with a whopper here.  &#8220;Renewed&#8221;? &#8220;Drive&#8221;? &#8220;Crack down&#8221;?<br>
Stop it, sir, you&rsquo;re killing me!  How does one &#8220;renew&#8221; something that has never been?  And since when does idle talk and lip service constitute a &#8220;drive&#8221; to &#8220;crack down&#8221; on anything?  Mr. Hsu and the WashPost are nothing more than state propagandists photocopying and disseminating agitprop (oops, &#8220;press&#8221;) releases from <span class="caps">DHS.</span></p>
<p>We keep hearing that illegal immigration is a logistical comundrum because of the massive numbers of people involved, and there just isn&rsquo;t enough staff or funding to adequately address the problem, etc.  This is all hogwash.  Humasn nature is such that you need only to scare enough people to bring about near-universal compliance by everyone else.  Example?  The <span class="caps">IRS </span>audits about 4% of total tax returns but it makes the rest of us file dutifully.  With respect to companies that hire illegals, all you need to do is arrest and penalize (heavily) 4% of the offenders, and the rest will fall into line.  </p>
<p>So why isn&rsquo;t the <span class="caps">IRS </span>model used by <span class="caps">DHS</span>?  Because <span class="caps">DHS </span>is run by a neo-con destroyer who holds dual-citizenship with the only country in the world that has an absolute right to exclude and segregate sectors of its population, all with the <span class="caps">USA&rsquo;</span>s blessing.  This also shows that FedGov is brutally serious about extracting its taxes but has no interest in stemming the &#8220;brown tide.&#8221;</p>

					<p>In a rational country, it would be a felony to use either someone else&rsquo;s social security number or a fake one.  It should be prosecuted as tax fraud.</p>
