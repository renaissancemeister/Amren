						<p>Federal authorities are cracking down on immigrants who were previously deported and then reentered the country illegally &mdash; a crime that now makes up more than one-third of all prosecutions in Los Angeles and surrounding counties, a Times review of U.S. attorney&rsquo;s statistics shows.</p>
<p>The surge in prosecutions reflects the federal government&rsquo;s push in recent years to detect illegal immigrants with criminal records in what may seem the most obvious of places: the state&rsquo;s jails and prisons.</p>
<p>Immigration authorities have long combed inmate populations for illegal immigrants, but additional money and cooperation with local law enforcement have fueled an increase in such cases by the U.S. attorney&rsquo;s office in Los Angeles. The illegal reentry charge is the single most prosecuted crime in the office.</p>
<p>Prosecutors filed 539 such cases in fiscal year 2007, making up 35% of the caseload, compared with 207 in 2006 &mdash; 17% of all cases. Statistics for the first four months of this fiscal year show the trend continuing.</p>
<p>Federal authorities touted the recent effort, saying the prosecutions serve as a deterrent for those who see the border as a turnstile. They said they were targeting violent gang members, career criminals and drug dealers who have returned to the country after being deported &mdash; many of them repeatedly.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I just wish that were true,&#8221; said Jerry Salseda, a deputy federal public defender who has represented scores of illegal immigrants charged with reentering the country after having been deported. He and other critics say people who committed minor crimes years ago have been caught up in the wave of prosecutions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In years past, many of those now being prosecuted for illegal reentry would have simply been deported. Now they are being sent to prison first. Sentences can be as long as 20 years, but most defendants receive three to five years, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials in Los Angeles are largely responsible for the recent spike in prosecutions. In 2006, they created a nine-person team to scrutinize inmate populations for potential prosecution. ICE officials also placed an officer in the U.S. attorney&rsquo;s office to serve as a liaison with immigration officials on these cases. In addition, ICE agents look for possible defendants &mdash; primarily gang members &mdash; in communities around Southern California.</p>
<p>Prosecutions are likely to continue increasing nationwide as ICE expands its work in jails. Congress recently appropriated $200 million for the agency, which Myers said would be used to develop technology and to work with local and state officials to identify more illegal immigrants behind bars.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Thom Mrozek, spokesman for the U.S. attorney&rsquo;s office in Los Angeles, said the cases make up a large percentage of the overall number prosecuted by the office, but they do not represent an undue drain on resources or hinder other types of prosecutions. That&rsquo;s because the reentry cases are easy to prove, he said, rarely go to trial and don&rsquo;t require much time.</p>
<p>To win a conviction, prosecutors need to prove three things: that the defendant is in the United States, that he or she is not legally permitted to be here and that the person had been formally deported in the past.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The people we go after are demonstrated threats,&#8221; [Curtis Kin, chief of the Domestic Security and Immigration Crimes Section of the U.S. attorney&rsquo;s office] said. &#8220;The No. 1 reason to do this is to protect the community.&#8221;</p>
<p>As evidence, he pointed to the cases of two gang members charged after a jail sweep in December dubbed &#8220;Operation Winter Warning.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of them &mdash; Julio Cesar Mata-Sosa, a member of the Radford Street gang in North Hollywood &mdash; had been deported seven times from 1998 to 2006, authorities said. His criminal resume included convictions for burglary, robbery, vehicle theft, cocaine possession and sales, and presenting false identification to a police officer.</p>
<p>The other, Ascension Hernandez-Perez, a Valerio Street gang member, was deported seven times from 1999 to 2004 and had previously been convicted of burglary, assault, battery, cruelty to a child, spousal battery and making terrorist threats, authorities said. Both men have pleaded guilty to illegally reentering the country after having been deported and are awaiting sentencing.</p>

			<p>If millions upon millions more Americans were actually concerned about illegal immigration added to those who already are, it would stop. It would become one of those issues where the government would be risking total anarchy and resistance of the citizenry on most other things the administration is trying to get the citizenry to agree with OR, PERHAPS WE ARE ALREADY IN A DICTATORSHIP WITH ELECTIONS AND OTHER THINGS JUST BEING AROUND TO CREATE THE FACADE OF DEMOCRACY. Afterall, no one is going to be standing on a high platform, wearing a military uniform, and gesticulating wildly from a podium, if we become a dicatatorshiop. The elite rascals who engineer things in this nation,are far too intelligent and modern to do that. We might even have older ex-presidents involved in the take-over who sometimes go skydiving.</p>

			<p>Federal sentencing guidelines awards a 24-month sentence for a first &#8220;illegal reentry&#8221; conviction.  These are previously-convicted noncitizen felons who having been deported, return anyway.</p>
<p>On a 24-month federal sentence, one must serve at least 21 months, even with time off for good behavior.</p>
<p>As illegals, these inmates are considered an escape risk, so they are not camp-eligible.  There aren&rsquo;t many &#8220;low&#8221; security facilities, so these illegals get sent to medium-security FCIs, also known as &#8220;gladiator schools.&#8221;</p>

			<p>The FEDS could end illegal immigration tomorrow&hellip; if they really WANTED TO!</p>
<p>Enact a law stating ANY illegal immigrant caught in the U.S. is sentenced to 20 years mandatory hard labor. Then rent them out as pickers and farm workers, etc.   &mdash;   under tight supervision, of course. Renting their services and labor pays our country back in part for what the damned illegals have cost taxpayers over the last 30 years! </p>
<p>Let the bleeding heart liberals squawk all they want to about this being too inhumane. It&rsquo;s downright inhumane to subject pit American people to the crime, the cost to taxpayers, and the social problems American people have to put up with.</p>
<p>The problem being this would be far too SENSIBLE for our government. But even the dumbest Mestizo will think twice before heading North   &mdash;   if he is assured that being caught means a job   &mdash;   a GUARANTEED JOB for the next 20 years   &mdash;   but without pay.</p>
