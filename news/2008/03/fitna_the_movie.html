<p>** 30/3/2008: Liveleak Update **</p>
<p>On the 28th of March LiveLeak.com was left with no other choice but to remove the film &#8220;fitna&#8221; from our servers following serious threats to our staff and their families. Since that time we have worked constantly on upgrading all security measures thus offering better protection for our staff and families. With these measures in place we have decided to once more make this video live on our site. We will not be pressured into censoring material which is legal and within our rules. We apologise for the removal and the delay in getting it back, but when you run a website you don&rsquo;t consider that some people would be insecure enough to threaten our lives simply because they do not like the content of a video we neither produced nor endorsed but merely hosted.</p>
<blockquote>
<i>[Editor&rsquo;s Note: <i>Fitna,</i> Geert Wilders&rsquo;s film about the violent nature of Islam, can also be viewed <a href="/googleplayer.swf" target="fitna" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>here.</b></a> At least as of 4:45 PM, EDT.]</i>

					<p>There&rsquo;s nothing new in that film. Far more graphic videos are available elsewhere on the internet, including several of heads being cut off, &amp; at least one showing men being burned alive (for an unspecified offense).  All Moslem, of course&hellip; the Religion of Pieces. </p>

					<p>I saw the film yeaterday before it was taken down. This piece is trying to tell the truth and people do not want it out there. It is a lot to taken in. Everyone should see it.<br>
It is time for truth to come out before it is too late</p>

					<p>The vision that was going through my mind as I watched the video was of the Reverend Wright videos and the preachment of the same kind of vile hatred against specifically whites and white America, and I could see other black churches doing the same, with their depictions of a black Jesus, because the real Jesus&rsquo; image was offensive to them, because their hatred is so great.</p>
<p>At no time have blacks and third world hordes been given so much, yet hated their benefactors so greatly.  But the real shocking revelation that came to my mind is that we have radical elements in our Western cultures and spinless politicians who think none of it all is of any importance and they continue their unabated support of these people in spite of the fact they are endangering us and our families and are complicit in destroying our way of life altogether.</p>
<p>It is up to us to protect ourselves by any means necessary.</p>

Well, LiveLeak gets my approval for standing tall and not backing down to threats and intimidation. I can see in the coming months that, like Patrick Henry said, &#8220;these are the times that try men&rsquo;s souls&#8221;. Some will be lacking, others will hold firm like LiveLeak.</p>
<p>Good Luck to us all.</p>

					<p>This anti-Islam film spreads the blasphemous  lie that Islam is violent.</p>
<p>Islam is not violent.</p>
<p>Islam is a religion of peace&hellip;.</p>
<p>And if any White Western people anywhere in the world says or even thinks the lie that Islam is violent, then mobs of Muslims will go on violent rampages of murder and mayhem all to prove the truth that Islam is not violent.</p>
<p>Islam is a religion of peace&hellip;..</p>
<p>And mobs of Muslims will slaughter anyone who says otherwise.</p>
<p>Islam is the best way&hellip;.</p>
<p>And tens of millions of Muslims are unhappy living in Third World Muslim countries, they want to move to White Western countries in Europe, <span class="caps">UK,</span> Australia, Canada <span class="caps">USA&hellip; </span>where the Muslims will be very unhappy, miss the culture and customs of Third World Muslim countries, don&rsquo;t like living in clean, safe, White Western countries where women show their faces in public&hellip;..</p>
<p>Muslims like to go on violent riots in Western countries all to prove that Muslims are not violent and don&rsquo;t like insults that say that Muslims are violent.</p>
<p>Islam is a religion of peace&hellip;.</p>

					<p>Real scary stuff!  And the fact that people are afraid to avail the public to view this speaks volumes about Islam itself.<br>
This should be required viewing for everyone on the planet.<br><br>

					<p>If after watching Fitna you still find yourself somewhat stranded intellectually when it comes to articulating the insidious threat that Islam presents, check - </p>
<p>&#8220;What West Needs to Know About Islam&#8221; at http://tiny.cc/YN7pp (on Google Videos). </p>
<p>It is 1.5 hrs well spent with people who know Islamic teachings very well, and are able to go into depth about the incredibly simple but powerful philosophy that drives this blend of religion and politics to spread and smother any civilization or religion that it encounters.  </p>

					<p>The most disturbing image in the film was Tony Blair. </p>
<p>To tell you the truth the blood and guts didn&rsquo;t really bother me. I&rsquo;ve seen worse in Hollywood movies.  </p>
<p>But seeing Bambi Blair recite his vile multi-culti apologetics almost made me puke. </p>

					<p>This is an important video. Every adult should see this. But information is not enough, organization is essental. When evil organizes for action (as many of those islamic dogs have), good men must organize to defeat it.  Otherwise, we are all informed sheep. Men, Christian and Jewish and athiest, must become close prides of lions; not loose flocks of sheep.  Make islam illegal, deport muslims back to their backward countries, smash the millitary capabilities of islamic nations, then we will have the peace that we all want.  I see no other way.  <br>

					<p>Wow! But I think the video took it too lightly. If the full dark side of Islam came out, this video would look tame, in comparison.</p>
<p>But this makes a good start. We have to start slowly, in convincing our people.</p>
<p>I am part Dutch, by the way! Go Geert Wilders!</p>
