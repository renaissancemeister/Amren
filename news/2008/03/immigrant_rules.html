						<p>Ottawa needs to tighten up on admission of HIV-carrying immigrants who are a drag on the country&rsquo;s already strained medical system, a leading taxpayers&rsquo; advocate said yesterday.</p>
<p>The Sun revealed yesterday that between 2002 and 2006, federal immigration officials only refused 126 of 2,567 applicants who&rsquo;d tested positive for the virus that causes AIDS .</p>
<p>A more moral and practical approach would be ensuring foreign aid combats the disease, said John Williamson, national director of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Canada could show its compassion best by using foreign aid money by delivering medicine overseas,&#8221; said Williamson. The country&rsquo;s immigration policy, he said, should be to ensure a supply of productive new residents, &#8220;not as a back door to our health-care system.&#8221;</p>
<p>A Calgary-based HIV economics study states the monthly cost of treating such patients in 2003 was more than $1,100.</p>
<p>Federal officials say medical costs and the public health risk posed by the immigrants aren&rsquo;t considered excessive.</p>
<p>Prominent immigration lawyer Edward Corrigan said many of the HIV applicants can claim refugee status due to the severe stigma of having HIV in their home countries, such as Africa.</p>
<p>He applauded immigration officials for allowing so many applicants into Canada, saying he&rsquo;s surprised by the numbers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m pleased Canada&rsquo;s compassionate enough to accept people &mdash; if we send these people back, it&rsquo;s a death sentence,&#8221; said Corrigan, adding the issue of medical costs can&rsquo;t be dismissed.</p>
<p>&#8220;But we are a wealthy country and the numbers of these people aren&rsquo;t huge.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;d want to send back mothers with children in tow &mdash; it&rsquo;s not their fault.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Calgary immigration lawyer Gary Hansen said HIV-positive newcomers are too easily granted entry when others aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s a lot of people who have been refused permission for considerably less,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve known of people with cancer who&rsquo;ve had to wait for five years after they&rsquo;re cancer-free.&#8221;<br>

					<p>It is incredible, it is unbelieveable what these government officials and politicians let into the country.</p>
<p>Let us only hope they are the victims of these aids infested africans.</p>

					<p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pleased Canada&rsquo;s compassionate enough to accept people &mdash; if we send these people back, it&rsquo;s a death sentence,&rdquo; said Corrigan, adding the issue of medical costs can&rsquo;t be dismissed.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;But we are a wealthy country and the numbers of these people aren&rsquo;t huge&hellip; . I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;d want to send back mothers with children in tow &mdash; it&rsquo;s not their fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Good gawd&hellip;.sometimes I wish I could crawl into a hole out of sheer embarrassment after reading such nonsense from another Canadian.</p>
<p>Obviously, Edward Corrigan is so full of himself for feeling morally superior to everyone else, he cannot fathom the likely-hood of one oblivious Canadian candidate waiting to have their entire life ruined, all because he felt so &#8220;pleased&#8221; with his egotistical vanity. </p>
<p>Of course&hellip; always highlight the &#8220;the mothers and children&#8221; <i>angle</i> to divert any unwanted criticism against his insane assertions. This greedy immigration lawyer falsely claiming compassion for hiv-positive foreigners needlessly arriving in our country, should have first-hand experience of what he advocates. You know, something what cops do when they taser themselves to know and feel the pain they mete out to others in the line of duty.</p>

<p>None of this guy&rsquo;s arguments made any sense, but this one is the worst.  Isn&rsquo;t it much more likely that Canadian drugs will keep people alive long enough to infect others, spreading the disease and delivering multiple &#8220;death sentences&#8221;?  And someone who already has an incurable disease is not being handed a death sentence by being sent back; they earned that sentence most likely through their own behavior.  </p>

					<p>Knowingly having sex with others when you know you are <span class="caps">HIV </span>positive is tantamount to premeditated murder.  I hope the Canadians realise this when it happens as it most certainly will going on historic facts.   And like in Britain, many more will flood in thinking they are welcome to take advantage of a, if not now, it soon will be, overburdened health service.  Unless of course they are paying every cost themselves.</p>

					<p>Since Canada has socialized medicine and private health insurance is actually <strong>illegal</strong> there, I&rsquo;m sure being forced to pay for expensive medication for these &#8220;refugees&#8221; will absolutely delight the Canadian taxpayers.</p>

					<p>75% of the people in the World infected with Aids are living in Africa. How is it a death sentence to be kept out of Canada? Certainly not from the &#8220;stigma&#8221;! Maybe because they wouldn&rsquo;t receive the $1,100 monthly tax-paid health care from Canada that would keep them alive? Having an infectious terminal disease is precisely why <span class="caps">SCREENING </span>is done!!!! If that isn&rsquo;t a reason to be denied entrance than what could be?!</p>

					<p>In more sensible times having a deadly, incurable, communicable disease was grounds for being refused admission into a country.  Now it puts you at the head of the line, if that country is a typically suicidal western nation like Canada.  Madness.<br>
