<p>Democrat Geraldine Ferraro, who became the first woman to run as a major party&rsquo;s candidate when she ran for vice president with Walter Mondale in 1984, believes that Clinton is not getting a fair shake in the media trial that is a modern-day presidential campaign. It has to do with gender, she believes.</p>
<p>And Obama, Ferraro told a newspaper in California recently, would not be in the position he is in today if he were &#8220;a white man&#8221; or a woman of any color.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think what America feels about a woman becoming president takes a very secondary place to Obama&rsquo;s campaign &mdash; to a kind of campaign that it would be hard for anyone to run against,&#8221; Ferraro said in an interview with the Daily Breeze of Torrance, Cal., in a column published Friday in advance of a speech in the area. &#8220;For one thing, you have the press, which has been uniquely hard on her. It&rsquo;s been a very sexist media. Some just don&rsquo;t like her. The others have gotten caught up in the Obama campaign.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Obama was a white man, he would not be in this position,&#8221; Ferraro told the newspaper. &#8220;And if he was a woman (of any color) he would not be in this position. He happens to be very lucky to be who he is. And the country is caught up in the concept.&#8221;</p>
<p>Susan Rice, a senior adviser for the Obama camapign, said today that the Clinton campaign should disavow Ferraro&rsquo;s comments. &#8220;It is the sort of comment that we have heard repeatedly, I&rsquo;m afraid, from some of the Clinton surrogates,&#8221; she said on MSNBC&rsquo;s Morning Joe.</p>
<p> &#8220;It is a far worse comment that what Samantha Power said and for which Senator Obama accepted her resignation,&#8221; Rice said. (Power, a former Obama campaign adviser, called Clinton a &#8220;monster,&#8221; and quit the campaign after the remark was reported). &#8220;If Sen. Clinton is serious about putting an end to statements that have racial implications, that diminish Sen. Obama because he&rsquo;s an African American man, then she ought to really repudiate this comment and make it clear that there is no place in her campaign for people who will say this kind of thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t the only venue in which Ferraro has vented about coverage of the Clinton campaign.</p>

			<p>So, Geraldine Ferraro is saying that Obama is benefiting from affirmative action pity.  If she doesn&rsquo;t like it that much, then why is she still a left-wing Democrat?  Hoisted on her own petard, perhaps?</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve asked several people &#8220;if a white male had obama&rsquo;s resume, could he be president?&#8221; but we could&rsquo;t make an apples/apples comparision, from being elected from a safe black district in chicago to a phony muslim/christian conversion to the uncanny rev.dr.mlk jr. impression to the unproud wife, to the afro-centrist to the safe &#8220;oreo&#8221; conversion, it was impossible for us to picture a white male having that kind of resume and ever doing anything, let alone being president</p>

			<p>The first part, about the primacy of Obama&rsquo;s race, is true. The second part, regarding gender is just partly true. A black with Obama&rsquo;s credentials running for office would not only have the racial loyalty enjoyed by Obama, she would gain a share of Hillary&rsquo;s base among white suburban wives and mothers by playing an obviously more credible Oprah role.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s about time someone in the public eye had the guts to say what everyone else has been thinking.  Obama is where he is now ONLY because of his black daddy.  </p>
<p>Also,  a white male would have been crucified for making this statement (btw- I&rsquo;m a white FEmale). </p>

			<p>Excuse me&hellip;..with Obama getting 90+ percent of the black vote in every election, we are to suppose that has NOTHING to do with him being a mulatto? (I really do not mind if he insists he is really a black man, even if it is not entirely true.)</p>
<p>This is the unavoidable consequence of identity politics in this election year. Each candidate has run an identity campaign to establish a block that will carry them through to the nomination. Unfortunately for both of them, they were not the only candidate that was running on identity politics. Ha Ha.</p>
<p>Geraldine is quite honest in admitting that Obama owes much of his success to those splendid formations of otherwise apathetic black voters who are excited by the prospect of the White House becoming the Black&rsquo;s House. Far too many of his supporters know almost nothing of his position (no one else does either). They only know what they see, especially when we realize there is not one iota of difference between the public positions of Obama and Clinton.</p>

<p>The whole campaign, contrary to the Obomination supporters, is *based on his race*, nothing more, nothing less.</p>

			<p>Like I&rsquo;ve said before, there is no such thing as &#8220;white skin privilege&#8221; in our day and age, but there is pervasive &#8220;white skin <b>stigma</b>&#8221; on the one hand and &#8220;<b>black</b> skin privilege&#8221; on the other.  How nice and fitting that members of our elite, so long content to throw members of the white middle class and working class to the wolves of &#8220;diversity,&#8221; are now crying out as the &#8220;anti-racism&#8221; juggernaut starts to roll over them.</p>

			<p>As usual Geraldine got it wrong.</p>
<p>Obama would not be where he if he were not half black and half white. He has the genetic material and upbringing of a white and the affirmative action and white guilt vote to put him where he is. What a deal!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>My children are half SE Asian, but the wrong country - they don&rsquo;t get affirmative action. So, like their old man, they have to make it on their own. They will be better for it, but they lost the affirmative action lottery because their mother&rsquo;s ancestors are not Samoan or Aborigenese.</p>

Many &#8220;Liberated&#8221; White women who came out of the 60&rsquo;s 70&rsquo;s &#8220;revolution&#8221; were incited by the manipulators  to compete against and to engage in an adversarial relationship with White men </p>
<p>It appears it is now dawning on them as to why this was.</p>

			<p>There is some poetic justice in this in that Hillary  &mdash;  who often played to minorities at the expense of white men and who always supported affirmative action for minorities  &mdash;  is now getting beat by a minority who is less qualified. </p>
<p>Yes, it is true if Obama were a white male, then the base in the Democratic party  &mdash;  blacks and liberal women  &mdash;  would be voting for Hillary. Hillary wishes her opponent was a white male  &mdash;  that would be a gender/race game she could play.</p>

			<p>Blacks will be on her statement like it was a free meal. Now, it is almost a certainty that Jackson &amp; Sharpton will rear their ugly heads due to the publicity factor. When a white woman speaks the truth she undoubtedly will be ostracised politically. A black presidential candidate makes unfullfillable promises he becomes a black Jesus. No wonder the rest of the world smells death on our once great country &amp; while they are allowed to violate our once soverign borders.</p>

Mrs. Ferraro is correct.  But dumpy Hillary benefits equally by not being a man.  Both misfits are eager to ruin America.  But we can&rsquo;t elect Yosemite McCain.  He&rsquo;ll do everything the hellish Dems would do; only he&rsquo;ll be successful since the Republicans will help him.</p>

			<p>This is the article that I was coming here to tell you all about.  It is already here.  </p>
<p>My dad and I think that John McCain is going to win the election in November.  We would both rather have Clinton than Obama though.  My dad got a chance to speak to Hillary on the campaign trail.  He thinks the slap in the face that she got from black voters after doing more civil rights work than Obama ever has soured her on serving their interests in the future.  Good!</p>
<p>I was pretty liberal until I started college and had to start dealing with all of the race pandering that goes on at school.  Experience changes everything, and that is why I think we are going to see a change in Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s attitude after the election whether she gets the nomination or not because she will know that she got it with no help from black voters.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t like them.  If I had my way most of the black students from school would be sterilized.  They are horrible.  They are hostile to white students, to Asian students, to Hispanic students, and to anyone else who isn&rsquo;t black.  They demand more special treatment than anyone else.  They are the most likely to get violent.  They are loud.  They have ghetto language.  They have ghetto gestures.  They have lewd, crude, and rude music.    </p>
<p>A friend who told me about this site maybe six months ago told me that I am wasting my time if I think that I am going to get through to you.  I still think that you ought to take advantage of the situation and use this to get white women on your side.  I have been reading the Internet for McCain, Clinton, and Obama.  Most of the Clinton supporters are saying that they will vote for McCain if Clinton doesn&rsquo;t get the nomination.  That is good.  I&rsquo;d still rather not take the chance because the closer Obama gets to the White House without winning the more convinced black people are going to be that they should riot when they don&rsquo;t get their way.  I hope that the Korean store owners have their rifles ready for the looters who will certainly be coming.  </p>

			<p>Let&rsquo;s play the &#8220;Who&rsquo;s the Biggest Minority?&#8221; game.  Here&rsquo;s how it works.  For each characteristic you fit into, you get the alotted points.  The person with the most points wins!</p>
<p>Black = 10 points<br>
Muslim = 9 <br>
Homosexual = 8<br>
Hispanic = 6<br>
Immigrant = 5<br>
Disabled = 5<br>
English as Second Language = 4<br>
Female = 2<br>
Asian = 1</p>
<p>Qualified for a position = 0<br>
Merit = 0<br>
Discipline = 0<br>
Hard work = 0<br>
Intelligence = 0</p>
<p>White = deduct 5<br>
Male = deduct 3</p>
<p>(McCain = -5; Hillary: 2 - 5 = -3; Obama: 10 + 9 - 3 = 16)</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the prize?  In today&rsquo;s America, anything can be, even the Presidency!!</p>

			<p>Aren&rsquo;t these liberals sick in the head? First they claim whites have all the advantages, now they claim Obama has an advantage because he&rsquo;s black! The liberal/progressive democrats have just about destroyed this nation. They&rsquo;ve done as much or more damage domestically as the Republican(that&rsquo;s a joke)Neocons have done internationally.</p>

			<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt that Obama is the perfect candidate for people who have accepted their racial indoctrination without any question. Brainwashed whites to put it bluntly. </p>
<p>But I think Ferraro is selling Obama short by saying that this is the only reason why he&rsquo;s so popular. Obama is a very intelligent and charismatic guy.</p>
<p>And I know many people who like him more than the other candidates, including myself, who have totally rejected the official line on race.</p>

			<p>Ferraro is partly right and partly dead wrong (naturally). Indeed, the media is treating Obama with kid gloves because he&rsquo;s black. However, contrary to what Ferraro seems to think, Hillary would be the media&rsquo;s favored candidate if her opponent were a white man. A woman president would fit in nicely with the media&rsquo;s bias toward political correctness. It&rsquo;s just that a black is even more politically correct than a woman, so Obama trumps Hillary. The pecking order is: black (or other non-white), female, boring white male. Not so hard to understand. And if it were a black woman running for president  &mdash;  the political correctness score would go through the roof! The media would have a field day. Never mind who is the most qualified candidate, of course.</p>

			<p>Obama is a mulatto.  His father a muslim from Kenya that abandoned him at the age of 2.  His mother was white as were his grandparents that gave him clean mannerisms, but attending a muslim school for awhile leaves doubts, especially since he wants to legalize  illegal alien criminals into a voting bloc, probably Hispanic and Blacks against Whites.  He should have the decency to end affirmative action, and put a zipper on his wife&rsquo;s mouth as she badmouths White American&rsquo;s and America as oppressive  &mdash;  has she ever looked at her so called motherland?  </p>
<p>Furthermore, if he is elected, he will open the gates of Africa into America just like the Mexicans coming over the southern border and more than likely send the U.S. army into Africa, while the Black Caucus demands more foreign aid money from U.S. taxpayers.</p>

			<p>To Ginny:  Even if Clinton gets some clues about blacks, if she wins she will thank the Hispanic vote, and continue to push for illegal alien amnesty.  Of course McCain and Obama also favor illegal alien amnesty.  I will either just stay home or write in Ron Paul.  Any other other vote would be dishonorable.</p>
<p>Three hundred million people in this country and McCain, Clinton, and Obama are the best we can do?  I&rsquo;m finding it very hard to believe this wasn&rsquo;t a set up.</p>

			<p>Ferraro&rsquo;s little fit of distemper is merely a predictable symptom of two mutually exclusive species of leftist identity politics facing off in post-Constitutional America. I&rsquo;m sure most readers here remember the feminists&rsquo; consternation and confusion when O.J. was acquitted. How, they mused, could black women justify freeing someone who&rsquo;d murdered his wife, after having abused her repeatedly? The answer, of course, is that black women are blacks first, women second, as far as political loyalties are concerned. What Ferraro or Hillary think they&rsquo;ve done for the fabled &#8220;African-American Community&#8221; (a sick-making euphemism if ever there were one) doesn&rsquo;t matter; B. Hussein Obama is black, and that&rsquo;s all there is to it. </p>
<p>We may confidently expect more childish quips from the two indistinguishable candidates and their camps as the campaign progresses, along with more calls for &#8220;apologies&#8221; and resignations, and more infantile talking-head bleating over who&rsquo;s being more &#8220;insensitive&#8221; than someone else. The fact that Ferraro is correct is almost completely beside the point. The whole nauseating spectacle bespeaks a sick, moribund political culture, the fruit of &#8220;liberalism.&#8221; You and your intellectual kindred got what you wanted, Geraldine; lay back and enjoy it.</p>

			<p>The case against Obama is that he&rsquo;s a radical leftist who&rsquo;s married to Michelle Obama and belongs to the anti-white church of a Farrakhanesque lunatic -not that he&rsquo;s inexperienced. To argue that Obama is not &#8220;qualified&#8221; to be president because he&rsquo;s &#8220;inexperienced&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t carry much weight after 8-years of the man described by Steve Sailer as a &#8220;twisted mediocrity&#8221; and &#8220;Chauncey Gardiner with a mean streak,&#8221; arguably the worst president in American history.</p>

			<p>As a Canadian, Obama reminds me a great deal of Pierre Truduea in 1968. He was basically an inexperienced guy who was created into a media sensation, by well, the media. Accentless in both French and English he tried to appear &#8220;bi-ethnic&#8221; in much the way mulatto Obama tries to appeal to both races. Truduea was all style and no substance and wreaked havoc upon Cnada. I suspect Obama will be much the same if he gets elected.</p>

Yet you point out the truth - people are following Barack not for his original ideas nor his (absent) experience but just because their friends put barack&rsquo;s emblem on their facebooks.</p>
<p>I am an american Indian, and I understand white guilt.  And I think thats all there is to it.  Barack&rsquo;s getting by not on his resume but on white guilt.  Sorry dude, I dont have white guilt.  I really dont like most white either but to tell you the truth, Hillary is the true leader.  Despite your rock star status, the DNC hasnt picked you yet because they know what is going on.  The republicans are messing up this election so Mccain will win.  If Hillary does not win, do you really think those catholic latinos wouldnt switch to McCain?  Wanna bet?   </p>

			<p>My mother&rsquo;s family is European. I don&rsquo;t have white guilt because I grew up primarily in Europe, and Caucasians are the ones being invaded in Europe.  Like the American Indian person here I do think that Hillary Clinton is a better leader than Obama.  I do admit to a little bias because my mother&rsquo;s parents were diplomats so they have met Bill and Hillary Clinton.  My grandfather says that Hillary was actually very gracious and bore no resemblance to the evil voo doo witch shown in the media.<br>
That just shows the power of the media to shape opinions and make sure that we all think what we are supposed to think.</p>
<p>I am not a diplomat so I don&rsquo;t have to be diplomatic.  In one respect I guess I am more like my father&rsquo;s side of the family.  I am not the right-wing born again most of them are, but I do believe in calling it like I see it.  I am happy to learn that black people have probably lost an advocate in Hillary or at least made her much less inclined to be sympathetic to them.  That just feels really good to me.  I will be delighted to judge black people by the quality of their character when they judge each other by the same thing.  That is not the current situation at all.          </p>

			<p>Hey you know what?</p>
<p>I love the way these campaigns work.  they fight with each other, Clinton and Obama, the way the USA and the Soviet Union fought, ie; using other people.</p>
<p>Just as the Cold War was fought in the Third World so too is this fight between the two Democratic Canidates fought between their staff.</p>
<p>For example (this is how I see it, I am not saying it&rsquo;s absolute fact, but&hellip;), </p>
<p>Clinton is losing to Obama, she needs to think fast, she&rsquo;s got stuff on him she could clearly use, but she might be accused of, guess what?  So, what she does is ask a staffer to do it, most of whom are volunteers anyway, and the staffer takes the heat (a heat cooled with a little financial help perhaps?).</p>
<p>Then Obama, and notice he did this exactly when Hillary was having a bit of a come back, did the same, THROUGH a staffer, who called her a &#8220;monster&#8221;.</p>
<p>Both Clinton and Obama publicly distance themselves from the guilty party, the guilty party issues a statement, but it&rsquo;s too late.  The damage has been done.</p>
<p>Now THAT&rsquo;S Politics folks.  </p>
<p>What a low occupation.  No wonder they think that Celebrities will help.  Another low occupation.  At least today.  I don&rsquo;t care how much money they make.</p>
<p>But what about us?  That we enable this; that we explain it away, as if this is how things are supposed to be; as if everything was always this low and dirty; as if there was never any such thing as &#8220;Statesmen&#8221; with at least a reasonable amount of intelligence and integrity. THEN we vote them in office and act surprised when they turn the United States of America, which is not simply a Country, but an idea that took 5,000 years for humanity to arrive at, into a Barnyard Fire Sale! </p>
<p>Shame on us too.</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, has anyone heard about the book &#8220;Love and Consequences&#8221; by the White gang-banger turned writer, Margaret B. Jones?  It turns out she&rsquo;s really Peggy Seltzer, writer turned fraud.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m surprised Mr. Taylor hasn&rsquo;t posted an article about it.  I would love to read the responses on this from everyone here at AR.</p>

			<p>The real problem here is that the politicians and the media immediately by-pass whether or not what was said is true or not, and go directly to assumptions of racism. Ferraro was making an accurate political observation, not a racist one, but the current lowness of our national culture is too vacuous to rise above the empty-headed sensationalism of PC finger-pointing. </p>

<p>The only thing that will redeem W&rsquo;s reputation is if there is a Muslim terrorist attack in the U.S. within a couple year&rsquo;s after he leaves office. That will prove he was doing something proactive about terror. Right now, I view him only has the idiot who took most of my discretionary spending cash to the oil companies though $4.00 a gallon gasoline.</p>
<p>As far as Hillary and Obama, in grad school I met one Hillary clone after another. They spend their lives trying to give blacks things they can&rsquo;t achieve on their own at the expense of qualified whites. They project their white capacity for gratitude on to blacks. Blacks, for the most part, are incapable of gratitude. Once they get something, they don&rsquo;t care how they got it. They just run with it and never return any favors. One thing white liberals share with blacks, however, is their inability to learn from experience so liberal white women will still be carrying water for blacks even after Obama takes away their historic moment.</p>

<p>The 2008 Democratic party&rsquo;s nomination process that we have been witness to over the last several months is, you might say, confirmation of everything that American Renaissance stands for.  It is a microcosm of modern America and demonstrates precisely why multi-culturalism and diversity do not work.</p>
<p>Since &#8220;identity politics&#8221; derives from Marxism, and if one understands that Marxist doctrine was created with the intention of fragmenting and destroying societies rather than creating or improving societies as its surface appearance would have you believe, it becomes crystal clear what is going on in this struggle between Obama and Hillary and, more importantly, why.</p>
<p>America has been destroyed from within, and it&rsquo;s been done via Marxist doctrine.  The whole nation has been deconstructed into a series of identities and all the conflicts this naturally entails: rich vs. poor, black vs. white, male vs. female, old vs. young, gay vs. straight, etc., etc.  There really is no end to the potential identities and the potential conflicts.  That this is happening within, and to, the Democratic party may seem shocking and unlikely to many, but in fact it is was only a matter of time before &#8220;the party of the people&#8221; would succumb to its own internal contradictions, which are the very contradictions of America itself in the present age.  </p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t think of a sweeter justice than that this is happening to the Clintons.</p>

<p>My children are half SE Asian, but the wrong country - they don&rsquo;t get affirmative action. So, like their old man, they have to make it on their own. They will be better for it, but they lost the affirmative action lottery because their mother&rsquo;s ancestors are not Samoan or Aborigenese.</p>

<p>If people think that blacks are out of control now, just wait until he is elected President (if indeed, anyone is really elected in the standard sense of the word).</p>
<p>Strangely enough, the blacks my husband works with don&rsquo;t like him.  They say that he doesn&rsquo;t seem to belong anywhere  &mdash;  not white, not black.  So much for the claim it&rsquo;s not about his race.  They also say that he really doesn&rsquo;t have much to say about anything.  After listening to him speak, one is hard pressed to figure out just exactly what he said.</p>
<p>Whichever of these manufactured candidates gets in, it is going to be very, very bad.  Makes me just want to move off into the wilderness and leave the whole mess behind once and for all.</p>

			<p>She says that Obama&rsquo;s manager, David Axelrod, should have called her first. Why would he?   This works very nicely in his favor.  She has presented him with an excellent opportunity to make an issue out of nothing. How perfect! </p>
<p>As for the Obama groupies, they insist that race has nothing to do with it. Well, what else does Obama have going for him?  They can&rsquo;t quite tell us. Why else do 85% of blacks support him?  Some will claim that he&rsquo;s  &#8220;articulate&#8221;.  Well, true enough, but lots of people are articulate. That alone doesn&rsquo;t make them presidential candidates. So what is it then?  Why do the Obama cultists keep denying race when that&rsquo;s the ONLY thing that sets him apart?  If Obama woke up tomorrow morning with white skin, suddenly he would be yesterday&rsquo;s news. His acolytes would have to find a new messiah to worship.</p>
<p>Still, Ferraro, as a left wing Democrat, is &#8220;hoisted on her own petard&#8221; as St.L.CC puts it so  aptly.  How hypocritical.  These are the people that she pandered to throughout her whole political career.   I have little sympathy for the lot of them. And I note too that she&rsquo;s now doing the standard damage control: As they ALL say, when caught in an awkward faux pas, she was &#8220;quoted out of context&#8221;;  and of course she&rsquo;s  insisting that she&rsquo;s &#8220;not a racist&#8221;.  Heaven forbid!</p>

<p>Give me a break! You know darn well O&rsquo;Bama is using his race to gain advantage over Hillary. He is not the typical ghetto trash like most blacks so Whites are jumoping on the O&rsquo;Bama Express to prove they are not racist.</p>

I noticed that too, of course.  It&rsquo;s glaringly incorrect. But I assumed it to be a case of talking down to the masses. It was probably not an accident.  To have used the subjunctive  [&#8220;contrary to fact&#8221;] would have cost her votes.</p>

			<p>Hypothetical situation:  You&rsquo;re in line at the grocery store   &mdash;   an  athletic 30 something black man drops some of his items on the ground   &mdash;   at the same time an elderly white woman drops a few items.  Who is betting the other white people will rush to see who can help the black guy while the old white lady is left in the dust? </p>
<p> Exaggeration?  Maybe.  But I watch whites going way out of their way to &#8220;assist&#8221; blacks in my daily life.  Doing things they&rsquo;d never even consider doing for another white.</p>

			<p>People in this country are scary. There are very few patriots left. While I do not always agree with the posts on this website, most are insightful. I read the posts from the original article, and I am disgusted with the opinion of these left wing loonies. The posts can be read here: https://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/news/politics/blog/2008/03/geraldine_ferraro_if_obama_was.html<br>
Scariest of all, Obama is not qualified to be president, but neither are the other two options. I believe we are about to enter scary times.<br>
Posted by Kellie at 12:06 PM on March 12 </p>
<p><br>
Yep.  &#8220;Scary&#8221; is the right word when describing what&rsquo;s headed.  So the only dignified thing to do is not let the scariness consume us.  I think it&rsquo;s ok to feel scared.  But it&rsquo;s not ok to live scared.  At least I&rsquo;m not going to do it.  </p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I&rsquo;m not sure EXACTLY what I&rsquo;m going to do if the proverbial *^%& hits the fan.  But I do think that Whites are being deliberately intimidated into compliance.  But fact is, not everyone is going to play nice.  Those who wont will be punished and the real criminals will get a free pass.  In short, it&rsquo;ll be business as usual, only this time on a grand scale.</p>
<p>One possible result will be that the number of those Whites who wont play ball and just go along to get along will also grow.</p>
<p>Gosh, I would hate for it to come to this, but all indications point to a very real breakdown of society.  Who knows how any of us will act in the moment.  But what I know about myself, geez, I just do not see myself doing time for self-defense, and certainly not for defending my wife and two children.  I&rsquo;m no &#8220;tough guy&#8221;, never wanted to be.  But I never backed down from a fight that I thought was necessary, and that I knew was gonna be fair.  But I could count on one hand how many real fights I&rsquo;ve been in; four or five.  </p>
<p>My point is, I consider myself kind of average in that respect.  I&rsquo;m neither Dirty Harry or Tinker Bell.  But when it comes to things like family, life and death stuff, all bets are off.  I dont wanna be dramatic or anything but to be honest I¡ve found myself thinking about stuff like this lately, cause I see it happening.  Like a tide rising or something.</p>
<p>Who know?  Maybe things will fizzle before the bang.  Still though, I think in the next year or two things are gonna get, interesting.</p>

			<p>  <i>[This] is merely a predictable symptom of two mutually exclusive species of leftist identity politics facing off in post-Constitutional America.

<p>We now have no choice but to have a Democrat elected to the White House.  Although McCain is a war mongering fool, on domestic issues he is a Democrat.  He favors illegal immigration, no child left behind, liberal activist judges, and big government in general.  A real limited government Republican did run but he was despised by the leaders of his own party, dismissed as a &#8220;kook&#8221; by the media, and rejected by the voters.</p>
<p>What is happening in America today would be entertaining if I didn&rsquo;t have to live here.  A year from now the fiscal storm that has already started will reach gale force, and we&rsquo;ll have an idiot in the White House, regardless of who wins.  Of course we have an idiot in the White House now.<br>

Such an excellent post, WR!   I wish it could be nationally syndicated and made required reading.  </p>
<p>Anybody notice the price of  eggs, milk,  bread, cheese lately?   And it&rsquo;s going to get much worse. The price of wheat has soared to new highs.  (The public is very little aware of this.) Forget about peak oil. People need food more than oil.  This price rise is going on internationally, but Americans with their feeble dollars will be in a weakened position to compete for the food, even if we grow it.  A few years from now, voters will be nostalgic about the good times back in 2008.  </p>
<p>The irresponsible spending binge that Washington has been indulging in has to have its consequences. The inevitable result will be the devaluation or collapse of the dollar. One Monday morning,  Americans will wake up to find that the dollar has been devalued and what they thought they had on Friday will be only a fraction on Monday. I have seen this happen before in Argentina.  It is coming to here. You can&rsquo;t spend forever without eventually facing the bill. Of course, the present idiot in Washington won&rsquo;t be in office then, so naturally he doesn&rsquo;t care.  It&rsquo;ll be some other idiot&rsquo;s problem.</p>
<p>And who knows what new military adventures we&rsquo;ll be involved in by then?  McCain in Iran, Obama in Africa.  Take your pick.</p>

			<p>Folks, be very wary of the term used by the leftists, its called white privilege. They use this term so it will creep into the fabric, and be accepted. First they declare you to have white privilege, then the next step, when the power turns, is to assess you punishment for that white privilege, like prison terms, being institutionalized, or even death. They are teaching this in our colleges and universities as we speak,&hellip;google noel ignatiev&hellip;when someone uses the term around you, go on the attack, and tell them that you go to work every morning and earn every penny you make, and work within an organized system created by white people where wealth is rewarded for work. </p>

			<p>Well, if <b><i>BO</i></b> does get elected and opens the flood gates full throttle to the African continent, Afro-Americans are also going to find themselves buried beneath an avalanche of the bruthas from darkest <i>Afrika</i>, too.</p>
<p>I have a feeling that their bruthas from the fatherland are not necessarily going to rub along with their slave descended racial kin of America in the interests of tribal harmony by letting the Afro-American get ahead of them as recent African arrivals, in every sphere all of the time.  When it comes down to the actual unblinkered realities of living like housing, education, healthcare and employment, sparks are gonna fly.</p>
<p>Because of the direct competition for ever-diminishing resources and means of survial between the two camps, somewhere along the line, a tribal war is going to kick off, domino effect style, all over the US.<br>
