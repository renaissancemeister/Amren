<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Five years ago he left a life of unimaginable hardship as a child soldier in war-torn Rwanda to join one of the most successful families in Britain.</p>
<p>Tindyebwa Agaba, the 20-year-old &#8220;adopted&#8221; son of Emma Thompson, has lived at the actress&rsquo;s Hampstead home and had his university education paid for by her.</p>
<p>Yet revealing for the first time his thoughts about Britain, it seems that Tindy &mdash; as the 48-year-old Oscar winner calls him &mdash; is not entirely happy with every aspect of his new life.</p>
<p>His most stinging criticism is for the celebrity culture, complaining of the &#8220;complete death of politically and socially stimulating activism which has been replaced by the pathetic celebrity culture and living a pretentious life&#8221;.</p>
<p>In an essay for a racism monitoring group where he works as a volunteer in his university town, Exeter, he also attacks apathy among fellow students, racist &#8220;nerds&#8221; and expresses his anger that he is the only African on his politics course.</p>
<p>He says he chose Exeter because his surrogate family had told him of &#8220;the stunning beauty there, where they shot Sense And Sensibility&#8221; &mdash; the 1995 film on which Miss Thompson met her husband, actor Greg Wise, 41.</p>
<p>Mr Wise has recently appeared in BBC1&rsquo;s hit drama Cranford while Miss Thompson, who won Oscars for Sense And Sensibility and Howards End, has played Professor Trelawney in the Harry Potter films.</p>
<p>In his essay, Mr Agaba makes a specific attack on Exeter University, saying that it made too little effort to attract students from ethnic minorities and adding: &#8220;I find it incredible that I am the only African in the entire politics department.&#8221;</p>
<p>He complains about the &#8220;incredible apathy&#8221; shown by other students, &#8220;excruciating debates&#8221; they have and &#8220;fantastically boring tutorials&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Total shock would be a fitting description of my first term at university here in Devon,&#8221; he writes.</p>
<p>He complains about the subject matter of his courses and how in Britain students are wrongly taught that the developing world is &#8220;diseased, war-ravaged and squalor-ridden&#8221;.</p>
<p>He also chronicles two incidents when he was the victim of racist abuse in Devon &mdash; the first by a bunch of &#8220;nerds&#8221; with nothing else to do and the second by &#8220;three or four tattooed and macho-looking bouncers at a club&#8221;.</p>
<p>The refugee &mdash; who has managed to gain an unquestioned stay of leave in this country as an immigrant &mdash; also reveals that his surrogate parents are not his only high-profile associates.</p>
<p>&#8220;I used to hold fortnightly chats about domestic and international issues with one of my political mentors, who happens to be a Cabinet secretary here in the UK,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;I vividly remember how I used to whine a lot to him about the unimaginable widespread apathy among London students in my college.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is going to be the same old story when I talk to him this summer holiday.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was reported at the weekend that Mr Agaba faced being deported to Rwanda.</p>
<p>On that point, Mr Wise told the Daily Mail: &#8220;We are not commenting.&#8221;</p>
<p>A source at the Home Office said: &#8220;He has not been removed and is not due to be removed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Agaba is now on a social and political degree course in Cambridge following his time at Exeter.</p>
<p>He was unofficially adopted by Miss Thompson in 2003 after she met him at a Christmas party in London held by the Refugee Council.</p>
<p>He had been sleeping rough in Trafalgar Square and she invited him to spend Christmas Day with her and Mr Wise.<br>

			<p>&#8216;In his essay, Mr Agaba makes a specific attack on Exeter University, saying that it made too little effort to attract students from ethnic minorities and adding: &ldquo;I find it incredible that I am the only African in the entire politics department.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Is there a specific gene present in peoples of color that inherently demands racial quotas?</p>

			<p>It is very tempting to attack this young african as an ingrate, when he is actually nothing more than a good student of his white marxist benefactors.  While Mr. Agaba&rsquo;s whining is reported, the applause of his commie tutors is not.  I wonder whether they got more satisfaction from his complaints about the lack of africans in his courses, (I have it on good authority that there is also a disturbing lack of eskimos as well), or his excoriation of the culture of the masses. I&rsquo;m guessing these 21st century Fabians get more of a rush looking down on the commoners.  It is still Britain, you know.  </p>

			<p>&ldquo;complete death of politically and socially stimulating activism which has been replaced by the pathetic celebrity culture and living a pretentious life&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Translation:  Nobody responds the way I want them to when I kick my whine gear into high, and it irritates me no end that they respond to me in a solicitous way as if they are trying to humor me.  (Just because he&rsquo;s hysterically fixated on race and revolution.  What racists!)</p>
<p>&#8220;In an essay for a racism monitoring group where he works as a volunteer in his university town, Exeter, he also attacks apathy among fellow students, racist &ldquo;nerds&rdquo; and expresses his anger that he is the only African on his politics course.&#8221;</p>
<p>Translation:  I&rsquo;m a racist and want more of my tribesmen here, because I don&rsquo;t fit in with these honkies, some of whom are racist nerds, which means, of course, they shatter my whining complaints of racism to shreds with logic.  I want more black retards here so I can appear intelligent when discussing something with them.  The whites trounce me cuz dey racist nerds.</p>
<p>&#8220;He also chronicles two incidents when he was the victim of racist abuse in Devon &mdash; the first by a bunch of &ldquo;nerds&rdquo; with nothing else to do and the second by &ldquo;three or four tattooed and macho-looking bouncers at a club&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Translation: Yes, it&rsquo;s &#8220;nerds&#8221; again, the same ones I always complain about. The racist ones.  They&rsquo;re nerds because only nerds can best me in a debate and only racists use the language they do and refuse to agree with my whining.  And the bouncers at the club?  Well, so I was hittn&rsquo; on a honkie slut who reported me to the bouncers who asked me to leave.  So what?  When I got in their face, they picked me up and threw me out the door.  They couldn&rsquo;t do that if they weren&rsquo;t the big, Macho types who have tatoos.  And there were four of them.  No, three.  No, wait a minute there were four.</p>
<p>I hate this country so much, I&rsquo;m ready to go back and fight in my homeland.</p>
<p>Question:  &#8220;Well, why don&rsquo;t you leave?  Is somebody forcing you to stay?&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, if I left, then nobody would be fighting these racists nerds to bring more blacks to the university and enage in political discussion.  So, I can&rsquo;t leave, though I want to.  There&rsquo;s too much work to do here.<br>

			<p>Well, naturally he&rsquo;s angry. His own country is a hopeless mess that he doesn&rsquo;t want to return to, &amp; he&rsquo;s been rescued by hugely successful people that he will never really be one of. That would mess with your head.  I&rsquo;m looking forward to hearing about Madonna&rsquo;s &amp; Brangelina&rsquo;s dusky kids when they grow up.  Of course, they were young when they were adopted, so it might not be such a train wreck.</p>
<p>(Also&hellip; Emma is just wonderful on-screen.  Too bad this happened to her.  Liberals never learn.)</p>

			<p>The Thompsons are hardly alone in the way they refuse to support and protect their own people, while insisting on importing Africans and Caribbeans by the millions into the UK.  The British people, sadly enough, have been doped into submission by the bread and circuses of their own government and media, which profoundly hate the traditional White, Christian British culture and are working in overdrive to utterly undermine it.</p>
<p>The sad news is, it&rsquo;s working  &mdash;   and even worse, the &#8220;British model&#8221; of anti-White total war by a 1984-style government against its own people, is being replicated by Kevin Rudd&rsquo;s Labour government in Australia and even by Stephen Harper&rsquo;s &#8220;conservative&#8221; government in Canada (conservative, of course, in the same way that Jorge Bush is &#8220;conservative&#8221;).  </p>
<p>Emigration of young Whites from these countries is at all-time highs, with settlement of young Britons and Australians in particular in other countries such as Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Iceland, Hungary and Greece, depending on language preference  &mdash;   countries which, for all their own flaws, have a much stronger sense of nationalism and look after their own.  Even France and the Netherlands have been receiving these emigres, encouraged by the much tougher immigration laws in these countries.  </p>
<p>No extra points needed to figure out the message  &mdash;   Whites despise countries and regimes that extract their labor and their taxes to essentially fund the takeover of non-Whites, and they will take their business and their families elsewhere.</p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s an excellent example of radical leftists importing crime and violence, turning a once relatively peaceful society into one of absolute anarchy.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before this black criminal kills or maims someone or several people.  His rhetoric reveals what he&rsquo;s all about. </p>
<p>Old Emma must have thought herself to be the epitome of morality when she decided to adapt this criminal.  Too bad he&rsquo;s not set loose on just the do-gooders instead of the general public. </p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if she decides to buy him a Kalishnikov and a box of grenades for his birthday.  </p>
<p>That would just about round things out nicely:  A black failure who despises his new countrymen and wants to bring his own tribesmen in at all costs, with enough arms and ammo to decimate large numbers of unsuspecting citizens as a matter of revenge for not getting his way.</p>

			<p>No good deed goes unpunished.</p>
<p>Lets see, he doesn&rsquo;t like being the only black in his political science course.  OK, so leave.  Then there will be no blacks in the politics department.  Makes him happy, makes me happy.  Whats not to like?</p>
<p>I also just happen to have another $400 on me&hellip;maybe he&rsquo;d like to met Mr. Pitts.</p>
<p>I am posting from the States.  If any of you Brits fear the thought police, I imagine my comments will closely parallel your own, so on this one, you can just ride the wave and not post.  I am sure MI6 or MI5 or whoever is spending their valuable time searching for white race patriots instead of looking for Osama ben Laden in Hempstead/Golders Green/Ruislip/Tring/Abergavenny, et al.</p>

			<p>There is no shortage of white liberals sponsoring young black males. I know of a similar story in my city where a doctor plucked a young man out of Africa and that young man is now a graduate working in a coveted federal government job.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost unheard-of for this kind of Cinderella story to happen to white kids.  Being mentored in politics by a Cabinet secretary, and having your bills paid by famous people, albeit complete strangers, who &#8216;adopted&rsquo; you?!  Promiscuous altruism will spoil the object of its attention. </p>

Why do people who live such pathetically unhappy lives demand that the world change to accommodate them? Maybe they would find the happiness they desire by returning to their roots.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;I find it incredible that I am the only African in the entire politics department.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t. Blacks have to be push and prodded, coaxed and cajoled to educate themselves. They take little initiative to better their lives. They have to be forced to (with few successful outcomes).</p>
<p>Mr. Agaba, open your eyes and mind to reality. Stop seeing the world as a fantasy. Blacks are as they are because they&rsquo;re black. The behavior and outcomes are universal.</p>

Emma Thompson&rsquo;s adopted Rwandan son:</p>
<p>Is he a Tutsi or a Hutu? </p>
<p>Remember the genocide that occurred in Rwanda about fifteen years ago? The Hutus were jealous of the better looking Tutsis. Five hundred thousand or more butchered bodies littered the landscape before the carnage subsided.</p>
<p>Emma better watch her back.</p>

			<p>What other &#8216;politically and socially stimulating activism&rsquo; would Agaba have to compare to? I thought he just lived a life of kill or be killed in Rwanda. He&rsquo;s no spokesman. Ah, the benefits of forgetfulness and taking one&rsquo;s situation for granted. Have at it; everyone else does(except whites; I couldn&rsquo;t take anything for granted if I wanted to).</p>

			<p>&#8220;He complains about the subject matter of his courses and how in Britain students are wrongly taught that the developing world is &ldquo;diseased, war-ravaged and squalor-ridden&rdquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>And certainly a Rwandan can testify that the third world is anything but that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny that he refers to the &#8220;developing world&#8221; when he clearly means Africa.  Can Africa properly be called part of the &#8220;developing world&#8221;.  It doesn&rsquo;t seem to be developing at all - more truthful would be to call it part of the &#8220;regressing world&#8221;.</p>

			<p>He was unofficially adopted by Miss Thompson in 2003 after she met him at a Christmas party in London held by the Refugee Council.</p>
<p>He had been sleeping rough in Trafalgar Square and she invited him to spend Christmas Day with her and Mr Wise.</p>
<p>Will Miss T. go to any more refugee parties? Tindy is asking for a fight and may go back to Rwanda where he can fight.<br>
I hope there is followup on this article&hellip;..</p>

			<p>Ranger summed the article up perfectly (<i>Ranger at 8:02 PM on March</i>).  </p>
<p>This dumb kid complains about apathy, then complains about &#8220;nerds&#8221; (people smarter than him) and boring classes.  He complains that he is the only African in an expensive college in rural England (!) but was so desperate to leave his pathetic homeland that he was happier being homeless in London.  He&rsquo;s lucky enough to be picked up and supported by a generous rich actress, and he complains about celebrities!  </p>
<p>By the way - I&rsquo;m sure that complaint about &#8220;celebrity culture&#8221; referred to his jealously that his new &#8220;mom&#8221; is seen as more successful than him.  Blacks usually get jealous when someone else is more highly regarded than they are even if the black in question has never accomplished anything.  England does not need another whiny man-child - maybe he can go back to Rwanda where he&rsquo;ll be left in peace (or in violence, more likely).  </p>

			<p>Fret not, Mr. Agaba.  As whites spend more time around you, their apathy will diminish considerably.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;complete death of politically and socially stimulating activism which has been replaced by the pathetic celebrity culture and living a pretentious life&rdquo;.</p>
<p><br>
As opposed to simply &#8220;complete death&#8221; in Rwanda, I guess.  Other keywords: &#8220;living&#8221; and &#8220;culture.&#8221;  <br>

			<p>I think Tindy better watch what he wishes for. </p>
<p>Britain&rsquo;s decadent and diseased (un)culture is one of the major reasons why people like him are even allowed in the country. <br>

			<p>My daughter attended Exeter Univ.  I loved visiting her there - the place is refreshingly &#8220;unenriched&#8221;.  Our home is in the multicultural utopia of east London, so it was kind of like going to a different country - a country called England.</p>

			<p>The only real answer for Tindy is &#8220;to never have begun.&#8221;</p>
<p>Best to have left him where he was rather than comingle with the conscience of a guilt ridden white.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I can&rsquo;t stand this new culture of the instant disposable celebrity. It&rsquo;s all so vulgar.&#8221; -IMDb:Emma Thompson</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t really think that Agaba could think completely on his own, now did we?</p>

			<p>The media does everything it can to make racism seem unfashionable. If you are a nerd you&rsquo;re unfashionable and if you are a racist you must be a racist nerd. We don&rsquo;t get logical arguments from the media against &#8220;racism&#8221;, since there aren&rsquo;t any, so all that&rsquo;s left is psychological conditioning.  </p>

			<p>I just love it how lately so many Africans, and African Americans love to say Whites lack culture. Even when they are mouthing off in Europe, the indigenous homeland of white people. What is black culture? In America it means gangsta rap, baggy pants, malt liquor, grills on the teeth and lots of bling. In Africa, it means violence, dictatorships, poverty, famine, disease. Oh you uncultured White people.</p>

			<p>Though our reasons might be entirely different (or might not be, I don&rsquo;t know), I have to agree with Tindy on the pathetic nature of the shallow, celebrity-obsessed culture predominate among young people on both sides of the pond. I&rsquo;ve been grousing about it myself over here since I was a kid.</p>
<p>That being said, the rest of his complaints are a hoot. </p>
<p><i>&ldquo;I find it incredible that I am the only African in the entire politics department.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Could someone please explain to me, once and for all, exactly what substitute for logic leads one to believe that it is the responsibility of academia/industry/whatever to drag minorities (or anyone else) into the higher echelons, rather than that of said minorities to take interest and enter them on their own?</p>
<p><i>He complains about the subject matter of his courses and how in Britain students are wrongly taught that the developing world is &ldquo;diseased, war-ravaged and squalor-ridden&rdquo;.</i></p>
<p>Know any parts of the developing world that aren&rsquo;t? For that matter, know any parts of the developing world that are <i>developing?</i> I am of course taking for granted here that his chosen term &#8220;developing world&#8221; refers pretty much exclusively to Africa.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and isn&rsquo;t he from a country that is the epitome of all of the above?</p>
<p><i>He complains about the &hellip;&ldquo;fantastically boring tutorials&rdquo;.</i></p>
<p>Boring because they are mundane, or boring because you have difficulty understanding them? I mention this only because he other quotes in this article lead me to seriously question this young man&rsquo;s intelligence.</p>

			<p>He is complaining because his cognitive skills are lacking and he can&rsquo;t comprehend what&rsquo;s going on around him in the university. He doesn&rsquo;t fit in! So, of course, like most blacks he has to blame someone else. He gets bored in debates because he doesn&rsquo;t grasp the issues but blames the other students for being shallow and boring. Typical black. Why even waste time on him? let him go back to Rwanda with his &#8216;interesting&rsquo; friends. Alas, I fear he&rsquo;ll try to stay in UK by hook or crook with the conniving help from his liberal white supporters. Sad, really.</p>

			<p>Bring him out from the worst kind of poverty, instead of being grateful, he&rsquo;s a whiny little get.<br>
What a waste of Emma Thompsons time and money.</p>
