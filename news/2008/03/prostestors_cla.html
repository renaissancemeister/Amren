						<p>JUPITER &mdash; John and Wendy Donahue say they lost their jobs, they lost their home and now they&rsquo;ve lost their patience with what they see as the main culprit &mdash; illegal immigration.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s impossible to find a job,&#8221; said Wendy Donahue, mother of four, ages 14 to 21. &#8220;These illegals are undercutting wages.&#8221;</p>
<p>Formerly local home painters, the Donahues were two of about 100 protestors today outside Jupiter&rsquo;s El Sol Neighborhood Resource Center, a day labor center that connects illegal immigrants with local employers.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s the Taj Mahal in there,&#8221; Wendy Donahue, 36, said. &#8220;They get served coffee, donuts &mdash; a waiting lounge.&#8221;</p>
<p>El Sol members and representatives held a counter demonstration, a prayer vigil that was, at times, drowned out by the honking car horns or jeers from its sign- and flag-waving opponents at Indiantown Road and Military Trail.</p>
<p>The federal illegal immigration debate is playing itself out on Palm Beach County streets. And this work center has become both the focus of a town council campaign and now a Congressional primary election.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>That problem was the hordes of undocumented workers who formerly clogged busy intersections and residential neighborhoods, grappling for a spot in the back of a pickup truck and a hard days work.</p>
<p>Now, State Rep. Gayle Harrell, R-Stuart, wants to shut El Sol down.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Harrell&rsquo;s Florida Safe Borders Act, or House Bill 821, would bar any county or municipality from creating, operating, funding or even assisting with any day-labor center aiding illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We should not use those scarce resources, these taxpayer dollars, to help illegals get jobs,&#8221; Harrell said.</p>

			<p>Illegal aliens invade the country and are hired by white businesses and contractors at day labor centers most likely opened by whites. White people then call these businesses and contractors to perform functions around their houses like cut grass, re-roof their houses, build additions on their houses, and assorted other jobs ad infinitim. If you call a business too have a job done you can specify you don&rsquo;t want any illegals on your property due to insurance risks. If one white guy shows up and the rest of the workforce with him is mexican, you can bet they are illegals. Refuse to cooperate with, employ, or sign any agreements for any sort of work with these businesses. White people are the problem for hiring them. The illegal aliens are just taking advantage of the situation.<br>

			<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible to find a job,&rdquo; said Wendy Donahue, mother of four, ages 14 to 21. &ldquo;These illegals are undercutting wages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Welcome to REALITY, 2008   &mdash;   Now these good Americans, Mr. and Mrs. Donahue can understand WHY business owners and corporate management DEMAND OPEN BORDERS! Why they support our Village Idiot President, and WHY they make those hefty campaign contributions to Lying Hillary, Phony Obama and Traitor McCain.</p>
<p>IT&rsquo;S ABOUT FUTURE PROFITS! Whick is WHY the greedy businesses will cheerfully fire Americans and hire immigrants, without worrying about the fine distinction of whether the immigrants are illegals or H1B visa holders.</p>
<p>American citizens   &mdash;   just like the Donahues are being screwed out of their jobs   &mdash;   by the damned illegals and the money-grubbing business owners and managers determined to milk the last penny of profit. While stabbing American people, Whites AND Blacks, callously in their backs. But isn&rsquo;t that just what we AmRen readers have been preaching for years? Being called &#8216;racists&rsquo; for simply telling the ugly truth about immigration.</p>

			<p>The Middle Class worker is hated by the local, state, and Federal governments.  We are hated because we refuse to work for slave wages and demand human dignity.</p>
<p>These day labor (illegal alien) centers are being paid for by taxpayer dollars extorted from us by force.  The illegals pay no taxes but send the money that should have gone to taxes home to Mexico.  They don&rsquo;t have ID cardes so they cannot put their money in US banks.  </p>

			<p>I live in Canada, and up here the immigrants flock to the inner cities to these &#8216;resource centers&rsquo;.  </p>
<p>They know that white liberals are falling all over themselves to help an immigrant.  It&rsquo;s the white liberal who is trying to buy himself a conscience by helping foreigners. The white liberal also believes that government should run everyones lives and provide for every need.<br>

			<p>In California, it is just about impossible for a White American to get any kind of job other than in the entertainment industry or as an attorney or paralegal due to the influx of illegals who seem to have every other job from physician to security guard to dishwasher given to them by employers.</p>
<p>I was at a hospital for most of the day last week.  You should have seen the security guards wearing jackets from a company called Securitas.  Rain forest primitives, couldn&rsquo;t even speak Spanish, let alone English.  I have noticed that a lot of government agencies in California such as DMV, courthouseses etc are using the Securitas tribesmen rather than legal workers.</p>

<p>Funny. I remember someone saying years ago, God does not hear the prayers of the godless, or the immoral, since they have turned their back on the one who is the Great Law GIVER.</p>
<p>God is not mocked. And neither are honest, LEGAL Americans.</p>

			<p>That illegal immigration (also LEGAL immigration) drives down wages and steals jobs from Americans has been proven too many times to allow debate.</p>
<p>Those many computer/software engineers FIRED from their jobs and replaced by Indian and Pakistani engineers. Jobs stolen from American workers that are either given to immigrants or outsourced overseas to cheap labor.</p>
<p>Those many horror stories about America&rsquo;s working poor   &mdash;   people holding full-time jobs but at depressed wages   &mdash;   thanks to immigrants. Americans who can&rsquo;t get welfare supplements or help   &mdash;   BECAUSE they&rsquo;re employed (albeit at starvation wages).</p>
<p>The harsh reality too many entry-level career paths are being STOLEN from our young Americans by immigrants (working cheaper). Remember how a couple of decades ago, kids could learn job responsibility and make a few bucks in the fast food and restaurant industry. Whether frying burgers or waiting on tables? More opportunities STOLEN from them.</p>
<p>Construction industries   &mdash;   all jobs stolen from American workers and handed to illegals. The result being shoddy construction of housing. So the house you bought needs costly repairs and maintenance/fixes   &mdash;   decades before your mortage is paid!</p>
<p>The smokescreen, the cry raised by the businesses and corporations being: &#8220;We try to fill the openings, but Americans won&rsquo;t do the work.&#8221; Or should that last be: &#8220;Americans can&rsquo;t AFFORD to work that cheaply!&#8221; Think about that one. The average mestizo, Hindu or Pakistani is hardly paying the bills the average American has   &mdash;   car payments, mortgage, health insurance, savings needed to finance the kids&rsquo; college education. Instead the immigrants can and DO get free health care; free welfare supplements. Even undeserved/unearned help with putting THEIR kids through college. Courtesy of you, me, the rest of the American taxpayers!!!</p>
<p>In spite of all these very valid points, some of which I&rsquo;ve spotlighted above, our leaders turn a deaf ear to American voters/citizens. They mealy-mouth platitudes that &#8220;we can&rsquo;t just deport 30-35 million illegals.&#8221; &#8220;We have to allow H1B immigration programs   &mdash;   to fill a real need.&#8221; Hell, these lies go on and on ad nauseum.</p>
<p>America is being BETRAYED! By an unholy alliance of American corporations and businesses, the collusion of the legislators and government leaders at all levels. By the deliberate (AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL/ILLEGAL INTERVENTION) by certain foreign governments and their lobbyists, agents and friends here in America! All united in betraying the needs and interests of real Americans; stabbing them foully in the back   &mdash;   by taking from them their livelihood, their future! Even our churches are actively aiding and abetting this deliberate betrayal of Americans. Calling their actions as being &#8220;demanded by God&#8221; or something similar.</p>
<p>The ultimate price of that FOUL BETRAYAL being paid by John and Wendy Donahue, and countless millions more Americans just like the Donahues! This is what globalization, corporate and business greed really means! All the fine words and unctious phrases notwithstanding. Ask Mr. and Mrs. Donahue   &mdash;   and those many millions like them, if you don&rsquo;t believe it.</p>

			<p>     I have seen illegals building homes in my development. I can&rsquo;t wait to see what happens in a few years when these homes start to fall apart. I worked in the housing industry during my college years, and believe me, a good gust of wind will blow down these new homes very easily. The outfit who builds these Rube Goldberg affairs will have a nasty time evading repairs and escaping law suits because the community is a relatively new one and the company is tied to them by contract.</p>

<p>CDB, this is one of my favorite Friedrick Nietzsche quotes and it is profoundly true. It is so simple,and deceptive, yet so effective a method, in keeping the strong on top.</p>
