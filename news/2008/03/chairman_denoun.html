						<p>An attempt by indicted Rep. Thomas Wright&rsquo;s attorneys to label a House ethics committee as racist drew a strongly worded denouncement today from the committee&rsquo;s chairman.</p>
<p>Rep. Rick Glazier, the chairman, called the attempt frivolous and groundless in a speech that left the committee and its audience in stunned silence. Glazier, a Fayetteville Democrat and widely respected legislator, spoke about his work as a civil-rights lawyer and about discrimination he has experienced because he is Jewish.</p>
<p>&#8220;I find equally abhorrent racism labels tossed off capriciously,&#8221; Glazier said. &#8220;Charges of racism, if proven, carry an enormously stigmatizing effect.&#8221;</p>
<p>He ruled against a motion by Wright&rsquo;s attorneys that he step aside from the case. The attorneys had argued that Wright is being treated harshly because he is black. They compare his ethics case to that of another legislator, Rep. Pryor Gibson, who is white.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wright, a Wilmington Democrat, faces charges that he acted unethically in his handling of $350,000 in campaign, charitable and corporate money. A Wake County grand jury indicted him last year on charges of obstruction of justice and obtaining property by false pretenses. He has refused calls for his resignation.</p>

					<p>Those who are &#8216;stunned&rsquo; by charges of racism by non-whites, especially blacks, are naively stupid beyond all reckoning. It is the standard mantra of blacks every time they get their hands caught in the cookie jar and someone calls them on it. </p>

					<p>Blacks always cry racism when caught doing something wrong. That&rsquo;s how Al and Jesse make their livings by following alleged racism. The biggest whine blacks put out is how disapportinately blacks are incarcerated in the United States as opposed to whites. Could it possible be that whites are smarter and therefore better criminals than blacks? I watch Cops and the First 48 on <span class="caps">TV.</span> You don&rsquo;t see alot of whites being arrested there. But the blacks seem to have a natural talent for shooting their foot off with their mouths.</p>

					<p>.. My ex wife was a bleeding heart liberal public interest attorney, with Indiana Legal Services, in Indianapolis. She was a text-book living example  of &#8216;White guilt&#8221;. One day she came home,and told me that she had been called a &#8216;racist&rsquo; by the older black manager of the office staff. Eventually, several more of the White attoneys were also called &#8216;racists&rsquo; by this same manager. I found it interesting how easy Blacks will toss under the bus the very whites that put their lives on the line, to move the Black culture forward. </p>

					<p>Toonces, my best friend&rsquo;s husband is a bleeding-heart liberal  attorney, too, in metro Atlanta. He stood up for the <span class="caps">L.A. </span>rioters(the riots took place a few months before he entered law school at Ga. State U,( a good place for a liberal, as it&rsquo;s in the heart of sleazy, crime-ridden downtown Atlanta, where all the homeless drunks and drug addicts congregate to ask for handouts). He sided also with the Simpson criminal trial jurors. He once lamented that after he&rsquo;d worked hard for &#8220;civil rights&#8221;, blacks called him a &#8220;racist.&#8221; He gets no sympathy from me.</p>

					<p>Another example of what I&rsquo;ve stated is my bleeding-heart liberal sister. She opposes &#8220;racism&#8221;; for example, she sided with the blacks in a GA case involving whites who were forbidden to drive vehicles to school with Confederate flag stickers. However, she has been called a &#8220;racist&#8221; by black students at the Art Institute of Atlanta, where she&rsquo;s taught English for 20 yrs., simply for justifiably flunking them or calling their hand when they&rsquo;ve plagiarized.(To be fair, I must say she has certainly taught blacks who did well and who got along w/her).</p>

					<p>Bleeding heart liberals have issues of their own and suffer from self-hatred portraying themselves as the &#8220;good white people&#8221; that&rsquo;s why they feel sorry for blacks and continue to treat them as subjects that need to be taken care of. When they stop perpetuating this hogwash and leave black people alone to take care of themselves things will begin to change!</p>

<p>With blacks (hell with all non-Whites), race trumps <span class="caps">EVERYTHING</span>  &mdash;  gender, religion, ethnicity.  Would that Whites would learn this lesson and learn it well.</p>
<p>I see Hillary is getting a dose of her own medicine as black &#8216;leaders&rsquo; and black voters abandon her in droves for racial solidarity with Obama (race-Illinois).</p>
<p><span class="caps">BTW</span>:  What black culture?  If a &#8216;culture&rsquo; means one of violence, lack of civility, family dysfunction, non-achievement, victim-hood, demands of preferences and hand-outs from Whites, and absolute immunity from prosecution for any crimes  &mdash;  coupled with the &#8216;right&rsquo; to hurl racial animosity at will at Whites without having to suffer any consequences.</p>

					<p>all the above is correct today. plus 100,000,000 more like&rsquo;em. i&rsquo;m a born and raised white memphian(memphis,tn.) and i witnessed our great city being handed over to blacks because <span class="caps">MLK </span>jr. was killed here. black leadership has brought this city to it&rsquo;s knees. it&rsquo;s probably the most racist city still standing. it appears to me there is a cultural &#8216;black denial&rsquo; that&rsquo;s inbred in them. Lord bless Memphis, it&rsquo;s light is dimming and it&rsquo;s not the flame, it&rsquo;s the people.</p>

					<p>If I have this mind-boggling factoid right, this idiot got elected to <strong>congress</strong> of all things, stole $350,000 of campaign money, and now says he isn&rsquo;t being treated well enough?!?</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t he getting paid enough already by us taxpayers to sit around in a Saville Row suit and do essentially nothing?</p>

					<p>Blacks have no recourse but to cry &#8220;racism&#8221; whenever they are called down for committing a wrong or whenever they don&rsquo;t get their way, and <span class="caps">THEY KNOW IT.</span> That is how they get what they want! They know that it&rsquo;s the only &#8220;weapon&#8221; in their arsenal and they cry it over anything, everything and nothing.</p>
<p>I resent the handwringing liberal White people in the 1950s and 1960s who worked tirelessly to &#8220;empower&#8221; the blacks. I suspect they regret it now. Once again, liberalism fails dismally, doesn&rsquo;t it.<br>

					<p>Here we go again. Will it ever end?  Everything is racist.  If it rains on a black it&rsquo;s &#8220;racist rain&#8221;.  If a black can&rsquo;t start his car &#8220;it&rsquo;s a racist battery&#8221;.  Any time something the least bit bad happens to blacks and other minorities it&rsquo;s because something or someone must be racist, and on and on and on. Minorities have fond their Abracadabra word and they enjoy whites dropping to their knees every time the say the magic &#8220;racist&#8221; word, and they get a big kick out of it along with money from stupid and frivolous law suits. It&rsquo;s starting to look like they have gone to the well one too many times with this scam and it&rsquo;s starting to fall on deaf ears.          </p>

					<p>Bon Bon, isn&rsquo;t it odd that Obama is described as black and considered black, yet he&rsquo;s half-white? The proponents of &#8220;racial solidarity&#8221; apparently overlook this fact, but then, Omama does himself.</p>

					<p>&#8220;&hellip;I witnessed our great city being handed over to blacks&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I empathise. I was born in New Orleans in 1960 and even though I was a child, I remember the city as she once was: elegant, gracious, hospitable, picturesque, European-flavored, and truly a Southern Belle of a town. All of that has been replaced by black &#8220;culture&#8221;: sub-par schools, neighborhoods that I would not even drive through let alone walk through, and a complete deterioration in every imaginable way. I resent it and I&rsquo;ve had enough. This website and its insightful posters offer me more than a glimmer of hope that the White race is finally trying to reclaim what is truly <span class="caps">OURS, </span>and I anticipate our re-inhabiting the cities, towns, streets, neighborhoods and schools that we build and sustain. Yes, jck, Lord Bless Memphis, and New Orleans as well. Indeed, the <span class="caps">USA.</span></p>

					<p>Jan, I was born and reared outside of Atlanta. I&rsquo;ve lived in w. central GA for 2 1/2 yrs. and am moving back to my hometown tomorrow. Atlanta&rsquo;s crime rate is even higher than <span class="caps">N.O.&rsquo;</span>s rate (before and after Katrina). The black population is the obvious problem.</p>
