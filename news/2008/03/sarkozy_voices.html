<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>French President Nicolas Sarkozy on Wednesday voiced his solidarity with Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende, who fears a Muslim backlash over a film criticising Islam made by a far-right Dutch MP.</p>
<p>Sarkozy assured Balkenende of his &#8220;support&#8221; over lunch at the Elysee Palace, saying he was &#8220;highly aware of the question of Islam&rsquo;s place in European societies, and French society in particular,&#8221; a presidential spokesman said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wilders, head of the Dutch far-right Freedom Party, said that if he finds a Dutch broadcaster to show the film uncut it could be on the air within a couple of days, and that he will otherwise present it at a press conference later this month and on the Internet.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The film, which lasts around 15 minutes, is called &#8220;Fitna&#8221;, which in Arabic means war, or division, in the heart of Islam.</p>
<blockquote>

			<p>They push, we retreat in fear, hoping to avoid violence. Over and over again. One day soon they will back us on step too far and real WAR will break out. Sooner or later, the West will have to at last stand and fight the howling mobs of hate filled Muslims. <br>
I am reminded of a man with bag of fresh meat throwing it piece by piece to a pack of wolves. With each piece the wolves grow hungrier, bolder, moving in closer. Finally he is out of meat and realizes HE is now the meat!!! Now, finally, he must fight or be anihilated. </p>

			<p>I think &#8220;discord&#8221; is a good translation for &#8220;fitna&#8221;.  I do look forward to seeing this film online.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to understand that just because a person professes belief in a particular religion doesn&rsquo;t mean he actually buys into everything stated in its holy books.  For example I, as a Jew, am aware of some shocking things that appear in our Talmud.  I used to be quite observant and, even then, I didn&rsquo;t take those Talmudic statements at face value.  I understood they were the opinions of men who lived long ago under certain circumstances.  I dared to disagree with them.  Most observant Jews wouldn&rsquo;t outright disagree. Instead, they&rsquo;d (in a manner of speaking) shove those statements under the rug and go about their daily lives.  If they happened to be hateful, spiteful people then that&rsquo;s how they would behave.  If, on the other hand, their nature was more tolerant and loving then that&rsquo;s how they would behave.  The Talmud doesn&rsquo;t actually change people&rsquo;s nature.  I&rsquo;m  hoping the same is true with Islam and the Qur&rsquo;an and Hadith.  I support this film because it&rsquo;s important as an exercise of free speech and it&rsquo;s important as a warning to European nations to not let themselves become Muslim societies or be pushed around by Muslims among them.  It should not affect how we treat individual Muslims with whom we interact in our daily lives as far as respect, courtesy and integrity. </p>

			<p>  Sarko is taking the coward&rsquo;s way.  I thought he had more Moxie than that. </p>
<p>One may not like the content of this film, but I say boycott it by not viewing it. The fact that it&rsquo;s not shown because of fear of violence doesn&rsquo;t say much for the assimilation of Muslim immigrants. I fear the Muslims are changing Europe from a tolerant society to an intolerant one. </p>
<p>I understand the mayor of Amsterdam, Job Cohen, is closing down part of the Red Light District; I can&rsquo;t help but think that this is at least partially due to increased Muslim influence. <br>

			<p>Any fans of Sarkozy on this site need to wake up.  This guy is an utter neo-con fraud.  Solidarity with the appeasers of Islam?  Give me a freakin&rsquo; break!</p>

			<p>In Holland we have a tendency to underestimate the significance of some of our politicians&rsquo; actions,&rdquo; remarked Thomas Luijken, an active member of the student political party NOVUM. &ldquo;With Ayaan Hirsi Ali, whether you agree with her or not, we did not realize the impact she would have around the world.&rdquo; When I asked him whether, after considering the controversy this film is being met with and the warnings of harm to Dutch interests overseas, he would be willing to take a stand either for or against Wilders, he responded resolutely. &ldquo;If people protest overseas, that&rsquo;s their right, unless they become riots and not protests. But if Dutch are negatively affected by this abroad and this results in some sort of violence, I would join a protest against (Wilders). It&rsquo;s not a very Dutch thing to do, but if (a protest) happened I would join it.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>Sarkozy was elected on the promise that he would stop illegal immigration. None of it happened in a definitive way. Arabs of North Africa, Black Africans and Chinese are still coming in.</p>
<p>Sarkozy, as a Jew himself, got the support of the French Jewry. It now appears that he is appeasing the Muslims in order to do what? Is there a secret pact?</p>
<p>More and more is given to non-French, with Sarkozy&rsquo;s blessing. He is the only politician who talked about affirmative action in France!</p>
<p>Everything is made for foreigners: subsidized housing, health care, welfare etc&hellip;and who know what else?</p>
<p>Islam will grow in Europe and will grow in North America. This is a fact. The Muslims of Europe are pushing and given the organizations and representation in the national congresses. They are more visible and more religious than the previous generations. They are also a voting bloc, or becoming one, which places them in a strong bargaining position.</p>

<p>This may amaze you, but in France do NOT the Nuremberg Laws apply (which wouldn&rsquo;t even make him a Jew, just a &#8220;half-Jew&#8221;).</p>
<p>As it is, Sarkozy is a Catholic.</p>
<p>I take it that the Nazi-law was introduced in the meantime to your country. How very apt!</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there a secret pact?&#8221;</p>
<p>But of course! The world-Jewry controls Islam as well, didn&rsquo;t you know?</p>
