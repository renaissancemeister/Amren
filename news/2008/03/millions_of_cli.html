						<p>Britain should brace itself for a new wave of mass migration caused by global warming, a report warns today.</p>
<p>A landmark document by two senior European Union officials says climate change will drive millions of &#8220;environmental migrants&#8221; towards the EU.</p>
<p>The report also warns of a potentially dangerous scramble between Russia and the West for the mineral deposits of the Arctic made accessible by the melting of the polar ice cap.</p>
<p>It says millions of people in poorer countries will be displaced by the consequences of global warming &mdash; famines, rising sea levels, loss of arable land and fresh water, and dangerous weather conditions.</p>
<p>Within a decade &#8220;there will be millions of environmental migrants,&#8221; says the report by Javier Solana, the EU&rsquo;s chief foreign policy co-ordinator, and Benita Ferrero-Waldner, the European Commissioner for external affairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;The core challenge is that climate change threatens to overburden states and regions which are already fragile and conflict-prone.</p>
<p>The risks include political and security risks that directly affect European interests,&#8221; concludes the document to be discussed at a special EU summit on Thursday.</p>
<p>The report says &#8220;significant potential conflicts&#8221; are likely as a result of &#8220;intensified competition&#8221; over energy resources.</p>
<p>Of particular concern is a &#8220;potential crisis&#8221; with Russia over rights to oil and gas deposits in the Arctic region.</p>
<p>As climate change starts to take dramatic and unpleasant effect in other areas of the world, Britain and the rest of Europe will see an influx of migrants, the report claims</p>
<p>&#8220;If global warming were to allow this to become a viable source of energy, a serious conflict could emerge between Russia and Norway,&#8221; the report says.</p>
<p>A combination of farmland being turned to desert, shrinking coastlines and harder to obtain fresh water will result in a &#8220;vicious circle of degradation&#8221; with &#8220;migration and conflicts over territory&#8221; threatening global stability, the document adds.</p>
<p>&#8220;The multinational system is at risk if the international community fails to address the threats. Climate change impacts will fuel the politics of resentment between those most responsible for climate change and those most affected by it,&#8221; the report says.</p>
<p>Scientists have just published studies indicating that it would require the world to cease carbon emissions altogether within a matter of decades, the report stated.</p>
<p>Their findings suggest that both industrialized and developing nations must wean themselves off fossil fuels by as early as mid-century in order to prevent warming that could dry up sources of water worldwide.</p>
<p>Using advanced computer models to factor in deep-sea warming and other aspects of the carbon cycle that naturally creates and removes carbon dioxide, the scientists, from countries including the United States, Canada and Germany, are delivering a simple message: The world must bring carbon emissions down to near zero to keep temperatures from rising further.</p>

			<p>I doubt that the changing climate will be a greater draw than that which already exists - namely, free government services and benefits merely for claiming asylum.  The author also seems to forget that the governments of European nations might have something to say about millions of third worlders simultaneously flowing across their borders.  A migration of the type hypothesized would be physically impossible; you can try all you want but I doubt that you will be able to fit 2 billion people in England.</p>

			<p>THIS, my good friends, is WHY we have a Navy, an Army, a Marine Corps, an Air Force, and a Coast Guard. Intercept them on the high seas. Turn them back where the tide ebs and flows. Hunt them down and send them back where they are from. The survival of this nation is not optional or negotiable.</p>
<p>The Constitution says one of the purposes of the Militia is to repel invasion. Call them out and MOUNT UP! We will not be overwhelmed by invaders, whether they carry a bowl or a spear.</p>

			<p> Aid has assisted a massive increase in population in the developing world, for example in Africa where the population is disproportionately young. Yet Aid has not proportionately provided the further education, employment and health care that many of these same young people presumably see on TV and aspire to. I would hazard a guess that the same people who promote aid also promote the inward migration of these young people to the West. </p>

<p>This is already happening to Africa - it has nothing to do with global warming - just the loss of white supervision and proper land use. </p>
<p>Carbon emmissions have nothing to do with global temperatures. Sun activity does. </p>

			<p>once again, marxism sticks it&rsquo;s head out of it&rsquo;s burrow. the verdict? six more weeks of global warming. those parasites are forever blaming the failures of the many on the successes of the few. and their &#8220;cure&#8221; is always the same- wealth redistribution. they don&rsquo;t care about global warming or the underprivileged. they just want an excuse to dig around in our pockets.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Was life better when a sheet of ice a mile thick covered Chicago? <br/>
Was it worse when Greenland was so warm that Vikings farmed there?&rdquo; <br/>
  George Will on Newsweek Feb. 12th, 2007</p>
<p>The warming that Mr. Will referred to occurred around 1100 A.D. when the earth for no discernable reason suddenly warmed up which, amongst other things ended the nightmare of the Dark Ages when life was, to quote Thomas Hobbes (1588-1673): &ldquo;no Knowledge of the face of the Earth; no account of Time; no Arts; no Letters; no Society; and which is worst of all, continual fears, and danger of violent death; And the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.&#8221; </p>
<p>This warming, amongst its other benefits &mdash; action, philosophy, organization, technology &mdash; ushered in the (very much traduced) Middle Ages, as brilliant and vibrant a social order as Western Civilization produced.</p>
<p>It is an undeniable fact that the temperature of this planet is rising (even though there are some people living in the mid-West as well as the North Atlantic coastline who would dispute this), but in this topsy-turvy world of ours what hitherto was considered a blessing has now become a curse.</p>
<p>There have been other occasion when the earth suddenly warmed up, namely around 3000 BC when (here I&rsquo;m shamelessly cribbing from Sir Kenneth Clark&rsquo;s (1903-83) Civilization) quite suddenly civilizations appeared all over the globe, in China, Egypt, Mesopotamia and in the Indus Valley.  </p>
<p>Another inexplicable warming occurred around 600 BC when the miracle of Ionia and Greece &mdash; philosophy, science, art and poetry &mdash; all reached a point that wasn&rsquo;t reached again for two-thousand years.</p>
<p>And there is the little matter of the Little Ice Age (1500-1850) when the glaciers advanced and wiped out whole villages, when the Baltic and the Great Lakes of North America froze over not only in the winter but late fall as well as early spring as did most rivers in Europe and North America, and Greenland returned to its pristine state.</p>
<p>In these past few decades this world has faced imminent catastrophe of another impending Ice Age, the population bomb, a nuclear holocausts, the exhaustion as well as poisoning of natural resources, the Y2K  computer meltdown, the imminent collapse of the U.S. economy, and now it is GLOBAL WARMING!</p>
<p>What all these &lsquo;disasters&rsquo; have in common that they are held with almost religious fervor by fanatics of generally progressive persuasion who insists that we must give up our liberties and submit to some central authority if we hope to save the world from the disasters they assure us are at hand.</p>
<p>The relish with which these prophets-of doom proclaim the imminent destruction of our civilization is unmistakable. They are thrilled by it.  They delight in it.  They want it to happen.</p>

			<p>Easy answer: sterilization. It&rsquo;ll never happen, but it should. Third worlders apparently have little else to do but breed. Sterilize them. They can engage in their favorite pastime, but they&rsquo;ll not overpopulate their own countries or strip the world of its natural resources.</p>

			<p>The prospect of global warming is just one more reason to close our borders, and to kick the existing third worlders out.  If we have no Hindus or Africans or what have you in our countries to begin with, we will have no problem of sorting out who is a &#8220;legal&#8221; or an &#8220;illegal&#8221; immigrant.  </p>

			<p>Why should the &#8220;West&#8221; be in conflict with Russia?  They&rsquo;re a lot more like us than Mexicans or Moslems are, to name two groups that our rulers are so anxious to get along with.  There are plenty of resources left in the world for the White peoples, we should be securing them for ourselves and our posterity, not pursuing intra-racial squabbles.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;Within a decade &ldquo;there will be millions of environmental migrants,&rdquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>&hellip;only if Great Britain allows them to migrate into the country. If GB permitted the &#8220;environmental migrants&#8221; (wow, now we have a new term for describing immigrants) to get in, there WON&rsquo;T be millions of them.</p>
<p>Somehow white people seem to have totally lost their control over immigration into their countries. They don&rsquo;t view their country as a house they are responsible for, where the (extended) family lives and where they make their own rules on how to live. Instead, people feel not responsible any more for what happens to their country, saying &#8220;we can do nothing&#8221;. And when it gets too bad with hostile neighborhoods, so what, then let&rsquo;s emigrate (and know that those whites who emigrate don&rsquo;t choose Africa, Afghanistan, India or the Middle East as their destination. Instead, they move to more civilized white countries which number becomes scarce).<br/>
Those of whites who immigrate, especially liberals, have the notion that they are allowed to live wherever they want. You know, we all are equal, so anybody can choose the place he wants to live in.</p>

<p>No, Britian and the other nations of Europe should prepare to keep these people out of Europe. The people of Europe need leaders with some spine who are actually nationalistic. Then again, so do we.</p>

			<p>I think the picture is a little misleading and inaccurate.  While I have no doubt whatsoever that millions of black africans such as those would certainly  love nothing better than to live out their days suckling at the teat of a Western European Socialist Mommy-State, I believe the countries in most imminent danger of being flooded out of existence by the rising oceans are the massively overpopulated Muslim nations of Southern and South East Asia like Bangladesh and Indonesia. </p>

			<p>     Huh? Environmental Migrants? Is this a new category to<br/>
beat us over the head with? Or just another illusion to pun-<br/>
cture. Wont the so called climate shift effect Britain too?<br/>
Maybe Africa should take British refugees, preferably the ones<br/>
that came from there originally.</p>

			<p>The hysteria concerning global warming has been manufactured through the United Nations and vested business interests for the purpose of demanding funding for poor countries that can&rsquo;t develop their own economies and to facilitate massive migrant intakes by developed countries. Political parties, notably Green Parties, and business iterests like those investing in solar and wind power, have exploited panic for their own ends, either as hypocrites or under the delusion they are building some type of better world. Each group is as insidiously pernicioius as the other, and each constitues as much of a threat to European civilisation as the specious apologists who insist on the benefits of diversity, and the irrelevance of European intelligence.</p>
<p>As some contributors have noted, the information provided by climate change advocates are very selective in what they admit to their models, such as the mini-Ice Age of 500 years ago when there was little latitude for accusing one society over another as responsible for climate change, even if the political machinery for so doing were in place.</p>
<p>Climate change is simply another ploy for social control, whereby socialists and others who like to see themselves as harbingers of good, with a wiser and kinder perspective than those who are to be coerced into supporting the dregs of the world. If it is so essential to save the unproductive masses of backward countries who can&rsquo;t utilise their own resources, then the only way to achieve social progress for them is to rule them. To apply equitable distribution of hard won wealth on the pretext of responsibility for some fantastic environmental disaster will only lead to universal impoverishment and genuine, global catastrophe.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;Within a decade &ldquo;there will be millions of environmental migrants,&rdquo; says the report by Javier Solana, the EU&rsquo;s chief foreign policy co-ordinator, and Benita Ferrero-Waldner, the European Commissioner for external affairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not if you lock your doors before they can migrate.</p>
<p>Britain should brace itself for a new wave of mass migration caused by global warming, a report warns today.</p>
<p>This EU spokesman describes mass migration as something that is inevitable, something we should &#8216;brace&rsquo; for. It isn&rsquo;t. No nation has any obligation to admit a single immigrant. No apology or explanation required. We do have an obligation to fire every bureaucrat and politician who continues to spew this drivel.</p>
<p>Bolt the doors. The wave IS coming, that much is true. Turn it aside.  Memphomaniac at 7:13, well said. </p>

			<p>E. David Litvak brings up a great point.  Even if one were to concede, for the point of argument, that there is global warming occurring, and that humans are responsible, you still wouldn&rsquo;t have made a case for action unless you could show that warming is a net harm to humans, and then, if there is a net harm, that this harm is not outweighed by the economic benefits gained through emissions of greenhouse gases.</p>
<p>The historical evidence clearly shows that warm periods are preferable to cold ones.  Growing seasons are longer, arable land spreads, rainfall increases, while negative effects are harder to identify (the spread of some diseases, maybe?).  The geological evidence also shows that life flourishes in very warm periods, even at times when there was no ice at all and the entire planet was tropical.</p>
<p>Cold, on the other hand, has very obvious negative effects.  People and livestock freeze to death - just look at Afghanistan this winter!  Crops are killed and famine ensues.  Food production declines.  Glaciers expand and habitable land shrinks (e.g. Greenland).  I think the rather absurd extremes to which Al Gore and Co. have gone to dramatize the negative effects of warming (drowing polar bears!  all the pretty snow melting on Kilamanjaro!) only goes to show just how hard it is to really find much in the way of serious harm caused by the alleged warming.</p>
<p>Long post, but my guess is you do not even get to Part II of the question - how the harm weighs against the benefits from the emissions - since warming is likely a net benefit.  The harms that will supposedly be inflicted on third world countries are not a product of warming, but of the environmentally disastrous consequences of rapid population increase in a totally unregulated society.</p>

			<p>&#8220;THIS, my good friends, is WHY we have a Navy, an Army, a Marine Corps, an Air Force, and a Coast Guard. Intercept them on the high seas. Turn them back where the tide ebs and flows. Hunt them down and send them back where they are from.&#8221;<br/>

<p>Nowadays, our military forces are kept busy quelling tribal and religious squabbles in remote parts of the earth, preferably if  they are on the other side of the globe; as well as kept busy distributing food, medicine, and generally playing Santa Claus  and Good Guy to the most benighted peoples of the earth who have proven unable to manage their own affairs. </p>
<p>And also making sure that they behave nicely to their neighbors and do not engage in ethnic cleansing or religious profiling    &mdash;   the 21st Century&rsquo;s worst sins (e.g. Serbia and Bosnia).</p>
<p>This benevolent assistance is rarely appreciated by the grudging recipients (e.g.. Somalia) but we determinedly keep busy doing good for them, anyway    &mdash;   regardless of whether they want it or not.</p>

			<p>Why would they go to Europe?  Would Europe somehow be immune to the effects of global warming?  Or is it that everyone knows only whites would be capable of dealing with such a potential disaster?   I don&rsquo;t know about most people, but if sea levels were rising, I definitely would not want to relocate to a small island (England) or a peninsula (Italy) and be surrounded by water.  </p>

			<p>These third-world countries are rich in natural resources that make the ruling despots wealthy beyond imagining and they use this wealth to bribe Western politicians into opening their doors to the dregs of the overpopulated third-world that is bursting at the seams from too many people.  Treason is the best paying endeavor in the world today and all our Western politicians are lined up with their hands out.  Once we dethrone these fifth columnists we can stop and reverse the mass invasion of third-world throwbacks&hellip;</p>

			<p>I think you folks need to think about your physical geography.  Much of lowland Europe and the lower part of England would be flooded if climate change leads to sea-levels rising.  By contrast, the sea levels rising around the coast of Africa will lead to what were largely barren and landlocked areas being flooded by the sea, so causing the coastline there to also change (e.g., Rift Valley).  This will also cause a rise in coastal humidity, perhaps causing a bit more moisture and resulting water - and resulting rain - and resulting plant growth.  Rivers are the motorways of Africa (only 400 miles of paved road in the Congo outside the cities), so communications might also be improved.  You wonder why the Greens don&rsquo;t consider these attractive developments.</p>
<p>While climate change in Africa sounds like a &#8216;Camp of the Saints&rsquo; scenario, human indolence and ignorance (both in ABUNDANCE over there) will incline people to simply walk inwards and upwards.  For those that don&rsquo;t adapt to the conditions, a Darwin Award awaits, and China colonising Africa the way Europe colonised the USA in the 19th century.  If 100 million Africans sail to the Netherlands or the East Coast of the UK, they better have their sonar ready for when they get there.</p>

			<p>This hypothesis is just silly.  Europe is a penninsula sticking off Asia, with many other penninsulae sticking off it: Italy, the Balkans, Denmark, Spain and Scandanavia.  Then there are the islands: Britain, Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, and many smaller ones.  In short, Europe is almost all coastline.</p>
<p>In view of this, does anyone *really* imagine these economic migrants, desireous of enjoying a life on welfare without work, are at all worried about &#8220;rising sea levels&#8221;?</p>

			<p>First:  Read the book REPORT FROM IRON MOUNTAIN about how &#8220;ecology&#8221; was to be the next &#8220;war&#8221; to keep capitalism going.</p>
<p>Second:  Global warming is the best thing that could happen. Since the climate never has stopped changing, warmng is better than cooling since more land will be available for farming and even more water (not tied up in useless ice) creating more rain.</p>
<p>We will have longer growing seasons to produce far more food and larger areas. Imagine all of Canada and Russia available for wheat, corn, pigs, apple trees, grapes, beef steaks, etc. It will be a fantastic positive change. We will be able to grow grapes again in England as we could before this last 400 years of unnatural Global cooling.</p>
<p>GLobal warming is caused by sun spots and the variations in the world&rsquo;s orbit. We are no more responsible for &#8220;warming&#8221; than we were for the Global Cooling that began in the 1100&rsquo;s and  1970&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>There have been 3 cycles of global cooling and warming since the birth of Christ. There will always be more.</p>
<p>As for non-whites moving here. I propose a bet. Let every non-white take over every inch that is now white and let us whites have the places these non-whites are leaving. I bet that they will starve in Europe and North America and we whites will turn their previous dumps into a first world paradise.</p>
<p>It is not the location that makes the area&hellip;it is the race. Just look at Iceland vs Haiti. Look at cold Norway vs Zimbabwe.</p>

			<p>Folks, climate change is real.  It would have occurred anyway, as evidenced throughout the earth&rsquo;s history.  But man has accelerated it immensely.  Firstly, when coal was the primary fuel, it did great damage with the CO2 levels.  The industrial revolution and all that followed has been pumping massive amounts of climate altering agents into the air.  At first it seemed so innocuous; everything just seemed to disappear into the sky.  Now we know better.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, this article is confusing at best.  Who knows, maybe if all the &#8220;warm weather loving&#8221; folks inundate Europe and the US, that means that Russia and Siberia will become bearable for the rest of us.  We whites can then just relocate ourselves and leave all the multi-cult mishmash behind.  Maybe, in the end, it will be the best thing to happen to our people.</p>

			<p>Anyone who has done any serious, un-inhibited study on this subject knows that AGW (Antrhopogenic, or human-caused, Global Warming) is a bunch of bunk. The temperatures on Mars have gone up in lock-step with that of the earth. This year, the National Weather Service predicted a warmer-than-normal winter for the western and central U.S.  &mdash;   yeah, we see how that worked out, didn&rsquo;t we. This year, the global temperature drop WAS THE LARGEST ON RECORD, wiping out a century of alleged global warming. Read the information on climate change at www.claytoncramer.com . </p>
<p>What global warming there is  &mdash;   and there&rsquo;s not nearly as much of it as the proponents would have us believe  &mdash;   is caused by the sun. This article is just another way to try to make Europeans bear guilt for what other cultures are doing to themselves, and through that make them responsible for taking in hordes of third-world sub-prime homo sapiens so that the world can be more easily manipulated by socialist overlords.</p>

			<p>The heroic post at 10:19 yesterday, invoked one of the most important speeches in the history of the English language, Prime Minister Winston Churchill&rsquo;s speech to the House of Commons on June 4th, 1940. Unfortunately, the quote was cut off where he promised to NEVER SURRENDER, when what followed his defiance is even more important. It continues as&hellip;.</p>
<p>&#8220;we shall never surrender, and even if, which I do not for a moment believe, this Island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British Fleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in God&rsquo;s good time, the New World, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old.&#8221;</p>
<p>So it was. Mr. Churchill was honest enough to admit that defeat is more than just a possibility but promised that the struggle would continue from the far-flung Empire, guarded by the Navy, until help could arrive to save them all&hellip;.that help coming from his American cousins.</p>
<p>Who will come to help us if we falter or fail? From what colonies and foreign possessions will we carry on the stuggle to liberate this country should it be overrun and starving? My friends, the battle for freedom will be fought right here, just a few yards from where you sit right now&hellip;.in every street, in every field, in every city and town. This is MY COUNTRY and it is not for the taking, not by anybody.<br/>

In fact, we whites are largely responsible for that problem, in a strange way, but it&rsquo;s not because of global warming.  It is because we have provided them with  food and medical care, genetically engineered crops, technological assistance, all of which have enabled their formerly sparse populations to mushroom.  Previously, nature held them in check. Now they don&rsquo;t know where all their surplus humanity will go, so they are eyeing our homelands as a potential safety valve for their exploding populations.</p>

			<p>This article is very ominous. I believe that in coming decades we are going to be hearing much, much more about this. </p>
<p>This (global warming) is just one more excuse - and a major one - that will be used to justify re-settling the tropical world&rsquo;s teeming, starving millions (billions?) in the Northern Hemisphere. It could well provide the final death blow to any lingering remnants of white societies remaining in Europe and North America.</p>
<p>We must not dismiss it casually, but take heed now, while there is still time.</p>
<p>I hate to say it (but Malthus already did, long ago) that providing them with technological aid, food, and medical care   &mdash;   unaccompanied by birth-control -  is a disastrous formula. We will be made to pay, in the end, for our own altruism.</p>
