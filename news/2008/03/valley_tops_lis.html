						<p>McALLEN &mdash; The Rio Grande Valley is a hub for identity theft and officials say illegal immigration is likely to blame.</p>
<p>For the second year in a row, the McAllen area ranked 5th for the number of identify theft complaints in the country in 2007, among metro areas with populations of 100,000 or more, according to a report from the Federal Trade Commission.</p>
<p>This is the second year the numbers have been compiled and also the second time the South Texas region has poorly fared. The Brownsville-Harlingen area actually edged the McAllen area to take the 4th spot in the FTC list. Laredo was No. 12.</p>
<p>The report, released in February, compiled self-reported and unverified consumer complaints from the FTC&rsquo;s database.</p>
<p>Local officials blamed the high number of complaints on illegal immigration and exaggeration of unverified reports.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The entire Mexican border region is plagued by high instances of identity theft, according to the study. Of the top 25 cities, 17 are in border states.</p>

			<p>Well, one thing you can probably count on down there is no Mexican illegal is going to steal your ID if your name is Bob Johnson or Mike Smith, etc. Plenty of legal Mendozas, Garcias and Sanchezes to swipe ID from.  </p>
<p>I wonder why nobody ever put the details of what happened with that despicable illegal alien Elvira Arellano on the Net. She was supposed to have been deported after being convicted of Social Security fraud I understand. In which case the trial is a matter of public record and it would have been interesting to learn the details of her crime, and if somebody else&rsquo;s number was used and whether or not it created problems for some innocent victim.</p>
<p>But of course SHE didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong. Another good reason to keep the illegals out of our country: they have no respect for our laws.</p>
<p>(Can anybody post the information about her trial here&hellip;..jurisdiction it was in, case number or anything so I can look it up for myself through their website if possible?)</p>

			<p>What&rsquo;s the connection between &#8220;identity theft&#8221; and illegal immigration? Has anyone made the connection? Why are there no statistics? What is the government deliberately hiding from us?</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m shocked! Shocked! Do you mean to tell me that Mr. Bush&rsquo;s honest, only-coming-for-jobs, family-value-loving illegal aliens would stoop to stealing IDs? Couldn&rsquo;t be right or that might be considered a felony, and our government would never want to legalize, give amnesty to, nor make citizens of felons&hellip;would they?</p>

			<p>Ah, now I understand why there&rsquo;s so much identity theft. It started just about the time when we became aware that there are millions of illegals in the country. If they&rsquo;re here illegaly they have no reason to obey any other of our laws.</p>

			<p>Hi, my town in California is listed #2 in the state for identity theft. Strange. OTOH, it has been almost completely taken over by illegal aliens. So I guess the illegals are stealing identities to use as their own. There is also a lot of identity theft just involving stolen credit cards and whatnot. There&rsquo;s also a lot of meth use here (#2 in the state I think) and I believe those guys are into ID theft big time.</p>
<p>If you review the jail inmates online at the local jail, a very large number of them are apparently illegals. Many are remanded to the INS. And a number are also busted for something like false ID by used by an illegal. There&rsquo;s a legal code for that.</p>

			<p>Does this mean that &#8220;family values don&rsquo;t stop at the Rio Grande&#8221; as the Dunce-In-Chief tells us?</p>
<p>Interesting fact from the website of the Drug Enforcement Agency: 65%(!) of all illict drugs that enter the U.S. pass through TEXAS(!).</p>
<p>Even a C-student from Yale (and former TEXAS governor) should be to comprehend the implications.</p>
