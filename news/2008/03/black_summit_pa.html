<p>[The Rev. Jeremiah] Wright had been scheduled for several months to be honored at the State of the Black Church Summit last night, sponsored by Fort Worth&rsquo;s Brite Divinity School, located on the campus of Texas Christian University, but the retired Chicago pastor announced he would not attend over security concerns. Wright also declined to attend a banquet tonight in his honor, since moved to Paul Quinn College in Dallas for security reasons, reported the Fort Worth Star-Telegram..</p>
<p>While most of the summit was not open to the media, about 20 attending pastors and scholars held a news conference today at Dallas&rsquo; Friendship West Baptist Church to defend Wright and the black church.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is eminently clear is the degree to which the black church is still largely misunderstood and routinely caricatured in U.S. popular culture.&nbsp;.&nbsp;l.&nbsp;. We now realize why the 11 o&rsquo;clock hour on Sunday is the most segregated hour of the week,&#8221; said Stacey Floyd-Thomas, who teaches ethics and directs black church studies at Brite.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s news to you,&#8221; [said Stacey Floyd-Thomas, who teaches ethics and directs black church studies at Brite]. &#8220;Black America has long known about the tradition of religious formation within mainline white congregations. Now, for the very first time in history, mainline America, white America is finding out something about its black church.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wright&rsquo;s sermons, the summit pastors said, were a continuation of the same long-standing black tradition of &#8220;prophetic preaching&#8221; that produced Dr. Martin Luther King.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Martin Luther King Jr. were pastoring a church today, it would look very much like Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago, Ill., and the sermons you would hear him preach would sound very much&#8221; like Wright&rsquo;s, Rev. Frederick Haynes III, senior pastor at Friendship West Baptist Church, said.</p>
<p>King, Floyd-Thomas noted, once called America &#8220;the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today,&#8221; adding that the slain civil rights leader had been scheduled to deliver a sermon titled &#8220;Why America May Go to Hell&#8221; on the Sunday after he was assassinated in 1968, the Dallas Morning News reported.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We have learned in recent days that you cannot reduce any black church to a monolith, much less a sound bite,&#8221; said Haynes, who charged the press with reducing the black church to a stereotype.</p>
<p>&#8220;We recognize that the body of the work of Jeremiah Wright Jr. is not limited to a sound bite that has been taken out of context for the political pretext of those who have agendas that are contrary to the healing of our nation,&#8221; he said.</p>

					<p>I agree that Rev. Wright is very much like tha plagiarist Michael King   &mdash;   both men despise the very people who gave them everything they have ever had.  This is why blacks are worse than dogs, in my opinion.  A dog will almost never bite the hand that feeds it; a black almost always will.</p>
<p>The media has played up to expectations on this issue.  It has been out of sight, out of mind, for the most part.  Sadly, Mr. Wright has found a sympathetic audience among libertarians who attempt to buy credibility among blacks by holding Wright up a first-amendment crusader.  Pathetic, really, the lengths that some Whites will go to suck up to blacks.</p>
<p>As soon as Barack Hussein Obama has been installed as president by our puppetmasters, Wright&rsquo;s words will be elevated to the level of scripture, just like Michael King&rsquo;s.</p>

					<p>What preacher was <span class="caps">MLK&rsquo;</span>s successor?  Jesse Jackson?  Who?  I&rsquo;ve seen the racist <span class="caps">NAACP </span>and its preachers first hand.  I&rsquo;ve seen the Jesse Jacksons, Al Sharpton&rsquo;s, and so forth.  All racist.  I&rsquo;ve also noted that the King family had a warm friendship with the family of Malcolm X.  Racists hanging around other racists.  Pure and simple.</p>

					<p>The role of the church is not a political one.What is the example for the Christian walk.Jesus Christ is our example.The Black churches should focus on what the bible teaches.MLK shouldn&rsquo;t be the example.Race is the central issue for these preachers.They are all trapped in their own minds and that is why they can&rsquo;t be free of their hate for the white man.They carry this hatred and it devours and eats them up.All they would have to do to overcome their self inflicted pain is to learn how to forgive.But if they forgive they can&rsquo;t keep their political agenda alive.</p>

					<p>Despite all their efforts, it still is pretty hard to spin the outrageous anti-American rants coming from Rev. Wright.  It is clearly damage control time.  However, it&rsquo;s pretty hard to spin the Award that Wright gave to Louis Farrakhan calling him a man who &#8220;truly epitomized greatness&#8221;.   This happened in 2007 and you can bet that Obama will say he was not there for the award and knows absolutely nothing about the award to probably the biggest anti-Semite in the nation.  You can also bet that these spin efforts are being offered for the most part to get Obama off the hook.  Obama said he was not aware of the Rev&rsquo;s anti-American rants despite his 20 years in attendance and as one writer put it, he didn&rsquo;t even know Wright was black until just a couple of weeks ago.<br>
Can we all say spin and shuck and jive???<br><br>

<p>Why is it <span class="caps">ALWAYS </span>someone else&rsquo;s fault? Why do the blacks <span class="caps">INSIST </span>on pretending to be &#8220;misunderstood&#8221; and &#8220;caricatured&#8221; rather than admit and accept the fact that they are perceived <span class="caps">PRECISELY </span>as they present themselves? What a terribly unsophisticated (or dare I say, immature) race to shun every aspect of responsibility as they do. Nothing will change that.   </p>

					<p>Let&rsquo;s face it - many, perhaps most American Blacks are delusional to some degree. I don&rsquo;t say that to be patronizing or insulting, I believe it to be fully true and supportable. Blacks of all backgrounds, social status, etc., continue to buy into the most outrageous, implausible nonsense as part of &#8220;African American&#8221; culture. In no other segment of society is urban mythology lifted up as gospel as it is among Blacks&hellip;and the more outlandish the accusation, the more popular it seems, and the more it re-affirms all the Black paranoia about &#8220;racism&#8221; the more strongly they defend it, ignoring fact and reality completely. </p>
<p>Beyond that, how many times must it be said&hellip;many American Blacks either secretly or openly despise Whites. Only the unenlightened, naive or simply stupid pretend it is otherwise.  </p>

<p>Not any more, old guy.  We&rsquo;ve seen the face of ugly anti-white hatred directed at whites in spite of their bending over backwards to cater to you for many years now.  And if you think it is whites like me who misunderstand black churches promoting white hate, let me tell you we understand where you&rsquo;re coming from quite clearly.</p>
<p>Let me propose to you that it is you who is some kind of fool thinking any white but a leftist radical is deceived by your immature, unintelligent attempts at fooling people.</p>
<p>The more we search the greater number of churches we find that are exact duplicates of yours and Trinity United, Wright&rsquo;s nest of hate.</p>
<p>One in particular, where they gave Wright a standing ovation is Sabina Catholic Church, a black church with a white pro-black priest.</p>
<p>When we go to the church web site, we see a black Jesus on the home page, which tells us you only desire to worship Christ if you delude yourselves into believing he was black.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.saintsabina.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.saintsabina.org/</a></p>
<p>The world knows that Jesus was a caucasoid, though I find it is immaterial.  What are you going to do when someday scientists prove that there were no blacks in the same area as Jesus during his time?  Will you quit worshiping him and convert to Islam or will you still ignore the facts?</p>
<p>Such evil, vile hatred is astounding.</p>

Never again will black protests about some supposed &#8220;insensitive&#8221; off hand remark by some hapless white have any credibility.<br><br>

					<p>You know it really surprizes me at the number of White folks that are &#8220;shocked&#8221; at &#8220;?rev.?&#8221; Wrights comments. I would guess that most of us on this site have heard <span class="caps">WORSE </span>things from the blacks we&rsquo;re forced to work around! And naturally most Whites won&rsquo;t call them on it [don&rsquo;t want to appear racissss ya know] which just makes them talk <span class="caps">MORE </span>trash. The only blacks that most of them ever come in contact with are the ones that ask them &#8220;do you want bacon or sausage.&#8221; I have heard blacks talk this trash all my life and wasn&rsquo;t shocked at all. I was shocked that it finally made the news. Don&rsquo;t worry about this hurting Obama though. I&rsquo;m sure with the way Whites are in this country today, he probably <span class="caps">GAINED </span>some White votes. Go figure!!!</p>

					<p>As I read of the troubles the Americans have with their black people, I believe that the best thing for them is to give them each a cash lump sum and a free boat ticket to the African country of their choice.   Africa is desperately short of skilled people now the new leaders are intent on driving the white people off the continent, some of whose families have lived there for over 200 years, so there are plenty of opportunities for them.  The only thing is they will have to work hard, but there could be no more affirmative action against them there as they are already black, unlike the whites who are being displaced regardless of their skills and work ethics.</p>
<p>God bless america.</p>

					<p>Isn&rsquo;t it amazing that the good Reverends Jackson and Sharpton aren&rsquo;t stuttering on every TV show available about Rev. Wright&rsquo;s words having been taken out of context? They are strangely quiet. But, so many black church congregants and pastors have praised his words that it&rsquo;s good to know how they feel. If they were offered a one-way ticket to Africa, though, how many would accept it? No, they need to stay here so they&rsquo;ll have someone to blame.</p>

					<p>All in all, I think the Obama presidency has been a good thing for white America. Most of them had been blissfully unaware of the hatred blacks have for them until the Rev. Wright controversy. Now whites have had a nice, healthy shot in the arm of black thinking in its purest form. Not only that, there are the amusing apologists, black and white, trying to explain away what Wright said. However, not many whites are buying it. I think history books will record two events that started turning mainstream America away from political correctness: the Duke Lacross Scam and the Obama Presidental Candidacy. </p>

					<p>It really warms my heart to see black religious leaders do this.  Why?  Because whites see this, know it for what it is, and awaken to racial consciousness. Blacks and black leadership should do this more.  More and more and more.  Eventually, so many whites will be forced to see the truth that blacks will find themselves without their liberal allies.  Then, we can finally start addressing the social problem the black community has become.</p>

<p>Nowhere in the bible does it state that Jesus was a caucasoid as far as I know, but I&rsquo;m not anything near a biblical scholar.  In fact, I&rsquo;m agnostic.</p>
<p>However, I do love to study history, and anybody who does is aware of what peoples were where at any given period in history.  Caucasoids literally dominated the Middle East during biblical times.  In fact, they still do today.</p>
<p>So having to verify that Jesus wasn&rsquo;t black is like having to prove Alexander the Great was white when Caucasians literally swarmed his area in ancient times.  Fortunately there are vivid descriptions written of Alexander, plus busts and other figures which show him with unmistakable Caucasian features.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so absurd to have to denounce a flimsy lie that obviously has no basis in reality, when black liars just have to utter an untruth, requiring other people to disprove their veracity.</p>
<p>In an age when it is well-known that blacks find it difficult to complete high school it&rsquo;s really preposterous for them to make any claims as to being important historical figures, in addition to being responsible for building the pyramids.</p>
<p>Having no history of their own, the only option left to them is to try and create something of importance in their past by stealing the identities of other people&rsquo;s important figures, and claiming their best achievements. It&rsquo;s disgusting really.</p>

					<p>&#8220;Could you please provide me where in the bible it states that?&#8221;</p>
<p>There are no references to the actual appearance of Jesus in the canonical New Testament (note to afrocentrists: the passage you&rsquo;re thinking about right now, in Revelations, is allegorical).</p>
<p>There are weird passages in gnostic gospels, here and there, which mention that Jesus had blue eyes, but these are not reliable. It would be very odd if Jesus were anything other than a typical semitic person of the 1st century <span class="caps">AD, </span>that is, not a white European but a caucasian of the Near East.</p>

					<p>&#8220;However, I do love to study history, and anybody who does is aware of what peoples were where at any given period in history. Caucasoids literally dominated the Middle East during biblical times. In fact, they still do today.&#8221;</p>
<p>The above should read:</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;..and anybody who does is aware of where certain peoples were at any given period in history&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;m going to have to slow down a bit.</p>

					<p>Thank you guys for answering my questions - a big help.</p>
<p>I did some research on my own and what I found was interesting. </p>
<p>Pilate&rsquo;s letter to Tiberius Caesar concerning arrest, trial and crucifixion of Jesus gives a physical description of him. The Vatican has a copy, too. I told my mom of the news and she said I new that, all you had to do was ask and I could have told you were to find the information. Now she tells me. <span class="caps">LOL</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;From the &#8220;Archko Volume&#8221; containing manuscripts in Constantinople and the records of the Senatorial docket taken from the library at Rome translated by Drs. Macintosh and Twyman of the Antiquerian Lodge, Genoa, Italy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This has been checked and is in accord with the copy of the original lodged in a British Museum that has verified the accuracy of the transcription. It was verified in November 1935.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
&ldquo;Among the various rumors that came to my ears there was one in particular that attracted my attention. A young man, it was said, had appeared in Galilee preaching with a noble unction a new law in the name of the God who had sent him. At first I was apprehensive that his design was to stir up the people against the Romans, but my fears were soon dispelled. Jesus of Nazareth spoke rather as a friend of the Romans than of the Jews. One day in passing by the place of Siloe, where there was a great concourse of people, I observed in the midst of the group a young man who was leaning against a tree, calmly addressing the multitude. I was told it was Jesus. This I could easily have suspected, so great was the difference between him and those listening to him. His golden-colored hair and beard gave to his appearance a celestial aspect.  He appeared to be about thirty years of age. Never have I seen a sweeter or more serene countenance. What a contrast between him and his hearers, with their black beards and tawny complexions.  Unwilling to interrupt him by my presence, I continued my walk, but signified to my secretary to join the group and listen.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
I only copied part of the letter becasue it was very long. I am going to assume the accuracy of this considering the sources. </p>

					<p>For those who say that Pastor Wright&rsquo;s remarks are taken out of context, I would like to know it what context his remarks would be acceptable.</p>
<p>I heard one woman say that Pastor Wright became extremist when he got out of the Marine, came to Chicago, and had to ride in the back of the bus.  The problem with that is, we never had segregated seating on Chicago&rsquo;s public transportation.</p>
