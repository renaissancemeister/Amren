<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>JOHANNESBURG (AFP) &mdash; Hundreds of South Africans marched on central Johannesburg on Tuesday defending the right of women to wear miniskirts without harassment.</p>
<p>The picket was staged near the Noord Street taxi rank where a young woman had her clothes torn off by taxi drivers and hawkers last month, allegedly for showing too much skin.</p>
<p>Her assailants allegedly touched the woman&rsquo;s private parts while pouring alcohol over her head and calling her names.</p>
<p>The protesters, mostly women and many wearing miniskirts themselves, carried placards reading: &#8220;We love our miniskirts&#8221;, and &#8220;We aren&rsquo;t road signs, you need to respect us&#8221;.</p>
<p>Mpumi Ngidi, 26, said she was frequently harassed.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you are caught between the pavement and a (vendor&rsquo;s) stall and you cross a group of men, at least one in three will try to touch your boobs, your ass.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; she told AFP.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t wear miniskirts, I don&rsquo;t dress in a sexy way or dress up. It is partly a defense mechanism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Taxi associations condemned last month&rsquo;s incident, which saw several other women coming forward with similar harrowing stories, but twenty-something taxi driver Thulani Nhlapho on Tuesday summed up one male view.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you are wearing a miniskirt, you give the impression you want to be raped,&#8221; Nhlapho added.</p>
<p>&#8220;You respect yourself when you wear a longer skirt. We respect women who respect themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Edwin Ndlovu, 29, was among those regarded the procession with great amusement.</p>
<p>&#8220;We laugh because they are naked,&#8221; said the car guard. &#8220;As a person you have to control your feelings. It is difficult when women are naked. That&rsquo;s how some men end up raping women.&#8221;</p>
<p>Popular radio personality Redi Direko, herself abused in a taxi as a teenager, rejects such statements with contempt.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have babies who get raped, grandmothers who get raped. When I was assaulted, I was 13 and wearing a school uniform.&#8221;</p>
<p>Direko said it was disturbingly common for women to have their breasts and buttocks fondled on taxis.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a lot of patriarchy. The expression of male sexuality is often violent, women have no negotiating power.&#8221;</p>
<p>About 50,000 rapes are reported every year in South Africa, which has one of the world&rsquo;s highest violent crime rates.</p>
<p>But activists say the numbers are hugely under-reported, and could amount to a million a year.</p>

			<p>I have been told horror stories by young White females(my favorite demographic group) of &#8220;creepy&#8221; and &#8220;disgusting&#8221; cab drivers here in Vegas. Most of them are Ethiopian and Eastern European immigrants. One girl told me that a cab driver was touching himself while her and her friends were in the car. Very disturbing. I personally love seeing a beautiful White woman in a skirt, but I think these girls are unaware of the risk they take when they are in a non-white environment.I could go on, but I would be censored. E-mail me if you want more stories.</p>

Now he tells me.  I can&rsquo;t believe all the time and money I&rsquo;ve wasted courting women when I could just have looked at the length of their skirts.  </p>

			<p>More than a bit dishonest.</p>
<p>A HUGE percentage of both men AND women, in those cultures, have forced themselves upon someone sexually, by the time they reach adulthood.  Among blacks, especially among african blacks, rape is so common, it&rsquo;s normal.  I don&rsquo;t mean the behavior isn&rsquo;t pathological.  I simply mean that both men and women expect that behavior from each other.  Almost all of them do it and almost all of them have had it done to them.  It&rsquo;s a big part of their sexual mores (one definitely not shared among civilized folk).</p>
<p>And wearing sexually provocative clothing DOES, in fact mean, they are advertising for this type of encounter.</p>
<p>Aggressiveness is part of the human mating drive.  The difference is, in almost all cultures, this is tempered with love and affection for your partner.  These drives are sublimated.  As part of good sex, we often pretend.</p>
<p>The difference is, they don&rsquo;t pretend.  And they don&rsquo;t care about their partners and families.  That&rsquo;s a big part of the reason why things are the way they are, over there.</p>

<p>How about the infants, old boy?  I mean South Africa IS the baby rape capitol of the world.  Is it their diapers that show too much skin?</p>

			<p>With legs like tree trunks and bottoms that should carry a wide-load sign, rest assured it&rsquo;s not White men ogling Black women.  </p>
<p>Having your clothes torn off in public, pouring your drink over a near-nude woman and touching her private parts is definitely something &#8220;Our of Afrika.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Have fun, kids!  </p>

			<p>Feminists in the USA call white men sexist pigs. So, what do they call the behavior of the black men here? Maybe us white men aren&rsquo;t so bad after all.</p>

			<p>With rape as prevalent as it is in S.A., why would any woman, in her right mind, wear a miniskirt?  Maybe Mr. Nhalapho is right and those women really do want to be raped.</p>

			<p>A short skirt defence for rape is just plain vile. It figures that in Africa it would be the cultural norm. </p>

<p>Haha!  Is it just me, or does this sound very similar to the cat that swallowed the canary?  &#8220;And uhhh, that&rsquo;s how one might end up raping a woman if one were to have done that, of course!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ahh diversity.  If only the feminists knew what they were importing into their country, they might think twice.</p>

			<p>Nice to see some coverage of events in SA on Amren again!! However, during the last week a video made by white students at a university made world headlines. So did the killing of 4 blacks by a white teenager. So did the abovementioned miniskirt event.<br>
BUT!! Nothing about the fact that the ANC President Jacob Zuma banned white journalists from his chamber, nor the black students&rsquo; warning that they will rape every white female student, nothing about the sudden surge in farm murders and the unfathomable violence and brutality that coincide with these. Nothing is mentioned about the terrible school results or the fast imploding electrical infrastructure due to illconcidered Affirmative Action. Or the devastation of once magnificent white farms, or the explosion in food prices in SA as a result of the ANC governments stupid land claims processes. Or the brutal rape by 7 blacks of a 21 year old girl in front of her father.<br>
My Brothers and Sisters, please pray for the Whites in SA (especially the Afrikaners) as we are now not allowed a voice anymore.</p>

			<p>I guess the fashion trends of South Africa are where America was in the 1960&rsquo;s, but since apartied the mindset there is trapped somewhere in the 7th century.</p>

			<p>The excuse of the blacks, ie that women showing a lot of skin are asking to be raped, not surprisingly sounds just like the reason given for the Muslim pack rapes of white Australian girls.  Their religious leader made an infamous comment after the incidents:</p>
<p>&#8220;If you take out uncovered meat and place it outside&hellip; and the cats come and eat it&hellip; whose fault is it, the cats&rsquo; or the uncovered meat?&#8221; Sheikh Hilali was quoted as asking during a sermon in Sydney.</p>
<p>&#8220;If she was in her room, in her home, in her hijab [headscarf], no problem would have occurred,&#8221; he added.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that feminists have such animosity towards American white men. They have no appreciation for how civilized we are, that we don&rsquo;t rape women in mini-skirts. (of course most modern day feminists don&rsquo;t wear mini skirts to begin with). They take it for granted that we respect them and treat them with equality. They have no awareness that this is unusual compared to most of the world. </p>
<p>I think that the lack of appreciation Western women have for white men could make women&rsquo;s liberation a blip of time in history. For example in Europe, Muslim men are more popular with the ladies than white men. By rejecting white men, today&rsquo;s women are basically throwing away their freedom and equality for themselves and future generations of women.<br>

<p>Muslim men are more popular with the ladies in Europe? Give me a break. Just because some White woman marries a Muslim every White man on this comment board thinks they are un-attractive to White women and the world is coming to an end. I hear more racist comments in my city from women than men. Way more. 90% of Whites, whether male or female, would never have sexual relations with a non-white. </p>

			<p>I have a right to walk down the street in any American ghetto wearing lots of gold jewelry, but I&rsquo;m an idiot if I exercise that right.  I have no sympathy for foolish women who insist on wearing any sort of sexy clothing in front of Africans.  What do they expect?  </p>

			<p>With all due respect Howard I think you are understating how many white women select non-white men. In Italy it has become so common for white women to marry Muslim/North African men that the Catholic church actually had to speak out against it. </p>
<p>Also,even if you hear more women than men make racist comments the fact remains that dating and marriage is FAR more common between white women and black men in the U.S than it is between white men and black women.</p>
