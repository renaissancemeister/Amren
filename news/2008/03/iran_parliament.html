						<p>In its first session since last week&rsquo;s general elections, the new Iranian parliament is expected to discuss a law that will condemn to death anyone who decides to leave the Muslim faith and convert to other religions.</p>
<p>The parliament, also known as the Majlis, will debate the new law which has been presented by the government of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.</p>
<p>Under the proposed law, anyone who is born to Muslim parents and decides to convert to another faith, will face the death penalty.</p>
<p>Currently converts, particularly those who have decided to leave the Muslim faith for Evangelical churches, are arrested and then released after some years of detention.</p>
<p>The new legislation, which has caused concern in Iran and abroad, was proposed mainly because of fears of proselytising activities by Evangelical churches particularly through the use of satellite channels.</p>
<p>There has also been concern over fact that many young people in Iran have abandoned Islam because they&rsquo;re tired of the many restrictions imposed by the faith.</p>
<p>According to unofficial sources, in the past five years, one million Iranians, particularly young people and women, have abandoned Islam and joined Evangelical churches.</p>
<p>This phenomenon has surprised even the missionaries who carry out their activities in secret in Iran.</p>
<p>An Evangelical priest and former Muslim in Iran told Adnkronos International (AKI) that the conversions were &#8220;interesting, enthusiastic but very dangerous&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The high number of conversions is the reason that the government has decided to make the repression of Christians official with this new law,&#8221; said the priest on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Often we get to know about a new community that has been formed, after a lot of time, given that the people gather in homes to pray and often with rituals that they invent without any real spiritual guide,&#8221; he told AKI.</p>
<p>&#8220;We find ourselves facing what is more than a conversion to the Christian faith,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a mass exodus from Islam.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran, at least eight Christians have been killed for their faith.</p>
<p>Seven of them were found stabbed to death after they were kidnapped while only one, Seyyed Hossein Soudmand was condemned to death.<br>

					<p>Why should we put the Iranians down?  American civilization is filthy.  And we have massive homicide and crime rates when compared to any civilized nation.  The Busheviksa and their Bolshevik allies simply try to push war onto them.  Sure they hate us and I hate them.  Still, I speak the truth above and believe we should stay the hell out of their business.</p>

					<p>Furthermore, if they all converted to Christianity then what would it mean?  Crime, single parent families, Busheviks, Bolsheviks, ?.  Leave them alone.  Let them live there and let us live in our land.  Keep out of their land and make them stay out of our land.  </p>

<p>I agree with the spirit of what you say Flamethrower,I hope you are correct, but the Iraqi people hated Sadaam and were slaughtered mercilessly if they even looked like wrongun&rsquo;s. That&rsquo;s what Totalitarian governments do best,they prevent revolutions. The Iranian government already know that an attack on the US will result, not  in their &lsquo;systematic extermination&rsquo;, but a lily-livered PC regulated invasion which they can dodge for years with the support of Marxists, and Fascists and Socialists  worldwide.  Added to that is the problem that Muslims long for death because dying for Islam means instant Heavenly bliss; hence the eagerness for so many Islamic men, women and children to kill themselves by slaughtering Jews and other infidels for Allah.  Iranian boss Ahmedinejad has already stated that he is aware of where the 12th and Final Imam has been hiding (in a well I believe) and his emergence is the signal for imminent and longed for Armageddon. Only after this has occurred will Islam dominate the entire world. <br>
As for keeping Muslims out of the <span class="caps">USA, </span>that can&rsquo;t be done because Left wing Multicultists have changed the laws and culture to ensure healthy &lsquo;diversity&rsquo;.  So they are here already in their tens of thousands, breeding, training and preparing to carry out their religious obligation of installing an Islamic Caliphate.  Same for Europe Australia, <span class="caps">NZ,</span> Africa.<br><br>
As much as I hate to say this, what has kept nations safe and strong throughout history were pre-emptive strikes and winning wars. When early Americans were advised to avoid foreign entanglements we lived in a different world, now destruction of the successful American experiment is paramount to ideologies that view America as the fly in the ointment of Totalitarianism: America is the nation that proves ordinary men and women can govern themselves successfully, hence the irrational hatred and targeting for destruction by Marxists, Fascists and Islamists.<br><br>
 Is doing nothing the best way to stay safe?  I believe one of our problems is that for more than 50 years, generations of Americans (and Westerners everywhere) have been indoctrinated with the idea that it is Pacificism that prevents invasions, wars and coups.  Would you not agree that to state that one is in favour of war against a potential aggressor is as socially and professionally suicidal as stating one is a racial realist, and in favour of segregation or repatriation of third world invaders. Might both these ideologies not stem from the same source?<br><br>

Yeah, and telling them you&rsquo;ll execute them if they leave the religion isn&rsquo;t adding to the restrictions, is it?<br><br>

					<p>Wrong, wrong, wrong.  Any Muslim attack on the United States that would not meet an appropriate response would result in the immediate replacement by a US government that would do the job properly.</p>
<p>Anyone who doubts me has clearly not been paying much attention to the news.</p>

					<p>The Iranians are more or less Caucasians, with many of them resembling southern Europeans in appearance, to greater or lesser degrees of pigmentation.  It is interesting to note that Caucasian peoples around the world (as well as East Asians) have, for whatever reason, historically been among the least willing to embrace Islam.  </p>
<p>The Lebanese, arguably the whitest of the indigenous peoples of the middle east, remained majority Christian the longest; Armenia has remained Christian to this day, while Turkey only &#8220;flipped&#8221; when invaded by Mongoloid Turks.  Even the Kurds in Iraq, ethically similar to the Iranians, were late converts to Islam and are said to &#8220;wear their Islam lightly,&#8221; (according to Wikipedia).  The pictures of Iraqi Christians I have seen in the media show that they are generally much &#8220;whiter&#8221; in appearance than the Sunni Muslims.  All this to say that I do not find it surprising that young Iranians would be among the most likely to cast off their Muslim beliefs.  <span class="caps">WHY </span>this pattern exists, and it really does seem to have a grounding in fact, is a tougher question.  It deserves some greater scrutiny, to be sure.</p>

					<p>Well though Iran has a lot of brown people, a large percentage can pass as or are white. Indeed the people who built the ancient Persian empire were white though the Empire was a hoch poch of races. That means the White European Greeks fought against a mix breed Persian empire but with a Asian White Ruling/ original ethnic group.  </p>
<p>   Indeed though most Iranians have a respect for Islam, they look at it as an Arab export to Persia. And they look down on the darker Arabs as primitive who only gave them basic Islam. Indeed the white Persians played a major role in the achievements of the Islamic world in science, philosophy etc&hellip; Their choice of Shia Islam is also due to a desire to separate themselves from the majority Sunni Arabs and Sunni Indians (Though there are many Shia Arabs as well). </p>
<p> Besides Iranians have a high regard of European culture unlike Moroccans or Pakistanis. This could be because a lot of them are actually white genetically and thus naturally admire other white cultures over brown ones. <br>

					<p>Very true, as Jasper says, that Persians were among the greatest contributors to the so-called &#8220;Golden Age&#8221; of Islam.  And as much as ethnic Persians may look down on Arabs, many of these Persian (and other Muslim) authors wrote stuff that would cause even many Amren-ers to blush about black Africans &hellip; consider:</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that the Zanj (blacks) are the least intelligent and the least discerning of mankind, and the least capable of understanding the consequences of actions.&#8221;   &mdash;  Jahiz (d. 868 AD)</p>
<p>&#8220;[inhabitants of sub-Saharan African countries] are people distant from the standards of humanity&hellip;their nature is that of wild animals&hellip;&#8221;    &mdash;  Persian geography Hudud al-`alam, 982 AD</p>
<p>&#8220;We have seen that blacks are in general characterized by levity, excitability, and great emotionalism. They are found eager to dance whenever they hear a melody. They are everywhere described as stupid.&#8221;   &mdash;  Ibn Khaldun, (d. 1406 AD)</p>
<p>&#8220;Therefore, the black nations are, as a rule, submissive to slavery, because they have little essentially human and have attributes that are quite similar to those of dumb animals, as we have stated.&#8221;   &mdash;  Ibn Khaldun</p>

					<p>This conversion by Iranian Muslims to evangelical Christianity would be looked upon by any rational Iranian government as a sort of &#8220;safety valve.&#8221;  The converts are clearly disaffected people who would otherwise be pressing for change nationwide.</p>
<p>The Mullahs should also consider that Zoroastrianism was Iran&rsquo;s original religion and not Islam.</p>

					<p>Thanks to Jasper for that extremely interesting list of videos. <br>
I found them fascinating. I had never thought before of the proposed war being concocted against Iran as a continuation of an ongoing racial war waged everywhere against Aryans.</p>
