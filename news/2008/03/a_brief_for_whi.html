						<p>How would he pull it off? I wondered. </p>
<p>How would Barack explain to his press groupies why he sat silent in a pew for 20 years as the Rev. Jeremiah Wright delivered racist rants against white America for our maligning of Fidel and Gadhafi, and inventing AIDS to infect and kill black people? </p>
<p>How would he justify not walking out as Wright spewed his venom about &ldquo;the U.S. of K.K.K. America,&rdquo; and howled, &ldquo;God damn America!&rdquo;</p>
<p>My hunch was right. Barack would turn the tables. </p>
<p>Yes, Barack agreed, Wright&rsquo;s statements were &ldquo;controversial,&rdquo; and &ldquo;divisive,&rdquo; and &ldquo;racially charged,&rdquo; reflecting a &ldquo;distorted view of America.&rdquo; </p>
<p>But we must understand the man in full and the black experience out of which the Rev. Wright came: 350 years of slavery and segregation. </p>
<p>Barack then listed black grievances and informed us what white America must do to close the racial divide and heal the country. </p>
<p>The &ldquo;white community,&rdquo; said Barack, must start &ldquo;acknowledging that what ails the African-American community does not just exist in the minds of black people; that the legacy of discrimination &mdash; and current incidents of discrimination, while less overt than in the past &mdash; are real and must be addressed. Not just with words, but with deeds &hellip; .&rdquo; </p>
<p>And what deeds must we perform to heal ourselves and our country? </p>
<p>The &ldquo;white community&rdquo; must invest more money in black schools and communities, enforce civil rights laws, ensure fairness in the criminal justice system and provide this generation of blacks with &ldquo;ladders of opportunity&rdquo; that were &ldquo;unavailable&rdquo; to Barack&rsquo;s and the Rev. Wright&rsquo;s generations. </p>
<p>What is wrong with Barack&rsquo;s prognosis and Barack&rsquo;s cure? </p>
<p>Only this. It is the same old con, the same old shakedown that black hustlers have been running since the Kerner Commission blamed the riots in Harlem, Watts, Newark, Detroit and a hundred other cities on, as Nixon put it, &ldquo;everybody but the rioters themselves.&rdquo; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This time, the Silent Majority needs to have its convictions, grievances and demands heard. And among them are these: </p>
<p>First, America has been the best country on earth for black folks. It was here that 600,000 black people, brought from Africa in slave ships, grew into a community of 40 million, were introduced to Christian salvation, and reached the greatest levels of freedom and prosperity blacks have ever known. </p>
<p>Wright ought to go down on his knees and thank God he is an American. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>We hear the grievances. Where is the gratitude? </p>
<p>Barack talks about new &ldquo;ladders of opportunity&rdquo; for blacks. </p>
<p>Let him go to Altoona and Johnstown, and ask the white kids in Catholic schools how many were visited lately by Ivy League recruiters handing out scholarships for &ldquo;deserving&rdquo; white kids. </p>
<p>Is white America really responsible for the fact that the crime and incarceration rates for African-Americans are seven times those of white America? Is it really white America&rsquo;s fault that illegitimacy in the African-American community has hit 70 percent and the black dropout rate from high schools in some cities has reached 50 percent? </p>
<p>Is that the fault of white America or, first and foremost, a failure of the black community itself? </p>
<p>As for racism, its ugliest manifestation is in interracial crime, and especially interracial crimes of violence. Is Barack Obama aware that while white criminals choose black victims 3 percent of the time, black criminals choose white victims 45 percent of the time? </p>
<p>Is Barack aware that black-on-white rapes are 100 times more common than the reverse, that black-on-white robberies were 139 times as common in the first three years of this decade as the reverse? </p>
<p>We have all heard ad nauseam from the Rev. Al about Tawana Brawley, the Duke rape case and Jena. And all turned out to be hoaxes. But about the epidemic of black assaults on whites that are real, we hear nothing. </p>
<p>Sorry, Barack, some of us have heard it all before, about 40 years and 40 trillion tax dollars ago.<br>

					<p>Brilliant essay. Mr. Buchanan was robbed of the Presidency by the complicit national media, that never gave him a fair shake and sought to delegitmize him, every chance they got. I observed them doing this years. Americans are also to blame for allowing the <span class="caps">MSM </span>to get away with it and not realizing a true patriot and someone who only had and has his nations best interests at heart, compared to the fools we put in office. We have so many ignorant gullible people in this nation that it&rsquo;s downright scary.</p>

					<p>If African chieftains had not sold other Africans into slavery&hellip;</p>
<p>Blacks now in United States would instead be Africans.  Ones who were literate or had access to a radio would know of a land called &ldquo;America.&rdquo;  Some might even dream of going there, but that is as far as most would ever get.   </p>
<p>Slaves brought to the Americas were gotten from tribal chieftains who captured them in wars, raids on other tribes, or sometimes just bartered their own subjects for trade goods.  Descendants of slaves who arrived in what is now the United States are citizens of the freest and richest nation in history while millions of Sub-Saharan Africans face starvation.  Blacks are due no apologies or reparations for a slave trade that required the active participation of Africans, is long over, and ultimately worked to their great benefit.  </p>
<p>Would 36,000,000 Blacks rather be Africans living in Africa?  Not likely.</p>

					<p>Pat hit it out of the park with this column.   It becomes clear that Barak goes to the Rev. Jeremiah Wright&rsquo;s church because he believes almost everything that the Rev says. Americans are very lucky that Barak was outed before he was elected president.  This guy is really bad news.  His voting record in the senate is further evidence that this guy does not belong in the White House.   Joseph Farrah wrote a column highlighting his voting record, and by the way, he is the most liberal senator in that body.   Here are a few of his votes:<br>
Voting against funding the troops/voted against reform on earmarks/voted against border fencing/opposed the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice John Roberts/voted against expanding the power of US intelligence agencies/voted <span class="caps">FOR </span>setting a date for troop withdrawal/voted <span class="caps">FOR </span>the start of withdrawing troops/help kill the bill against same-sex marriage/voted <span class="caps">FOR </span>the amnesty bill/voted <span class="caps">AGAINST </span>extending the Bush tax cuts/Opposed confirmation of Supreme Ct. Justice Sam Alito.<br><br>
This is just a small sampling of his views.   This guy must be defeated and sent back to his buddy, the Rev. Wright.</p>

					<p>In Obama&rsquo;s speech on race I believe I heard him say that he understands black-Americans anger and resentment as code for telling blacks to continue their support for him while popping open the umbrella of racism over the rest of us to laden us with that same ol&rsquo; guilt&hellip;trying to maintain white support by making them feel that the only way to prove we aren&rsquo;t,is to vote for him.I don&rsquo;t have an issue with race unless race itself is the issue.When will those people learn that it&rsquo;s all about conduct and behavior,not skin color or ethnicity?Of course Pat is right!</p>

					<p>&#8220;The &ldquo;white community,&rdquo; said Barack, must start &ldquo;acknowledging that what ails the African-American community does not just exist in the minds of black people; that the legacy of discrimination &mdash; and current incidents of discrimination, while less overt than in the past &mdash; are real and must be addressed. Not just with words, but with deeds &hellip; .&rdquo; </p>
<p>What nonsense.  What absolute nonsense.  Blacks have had more opportunities than anybody else the whole world over to succeed, but they continue to fail, even in Africa.  Is that the fault of whites, too?</p>
<p>The big problem blacks are confronted with today is that blacks are judged on the content of their character, their abilities and their intelligence, with all three revealing that they cannot compete in a fist world society, because of their low intelligence, their unsavory characters, generally, and their propensity for crime and violence.</p>
<p>Every poor person that comes to America of any race does better than blacks.  To say that blacks fail because of some kind of unspoken, unclear idea that there are built-in systemic biases against them is complete, utter nonsense.  Blacks are considered incapable, by every race not just whites, because they <span class="caps">ARE </span>incapable, and they prove it unequivocally every day of the year.</p>
<p>What is this magic thing whites are supposed to do that will change that?  I mean short of transplanting a different brain into their heads.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time this nonsense comes to an end.  We must stop catering to a people who cannot take care of themselves and have to be treated like imbecilic children or they will rage and riot.  There&rsquo;s nothing that can be done for these poor fools.  The kindest thing would be to help them reconstruct villages on their mother continent, so they can have a homeland where they can function without whining and crying about things that are their own fault.</p>

					<p>Thank god for Pat.Here is on of the few truly honest thinkers in America dissecting Obama.BHO is a fake and a race hustler.Now he tries to set up his grandmother as a &#8220;racist&#8221;.While his irresponsible black father took off and his flakey leftist mother left for Java  &mdash;  it was left to the nice responsible white grandparents to raise this scam artist.BHo shows no appreciation for their sacrifice.<br>
I have had it with Obama.He reeks of racial entitlement,and is so arrogant.His wife is even more obnoxious.</p>

					<p>I&rsquo;m from Russia, where blacks have no voice (so far?). I look around and cannot understand. Here is Obama, a black incompetent who hates America and white people. I can understand why reach people give him money: blacks are cheap to buy. But why so many wtites support him? So far I&rsquo;ve found a sole explanation: to be white and choose Obama is to be suicidal. Yet this doesn&rsquo;t sutisfy me. There cannot be so many self-murderers in the country. I ask you, AmRen readers, advice me any good  analitical material or write an article and explain to me this craziness.  </p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a question: Did Obama mention anything concrete that the black community is supposed to do?</p>

					<p> Thank you Pat. No one could have put it better. What i,d like to see now is Barack go through each point and answer them, but guess that would never happen. I,m tired of <span class="caps">AA, </span>it sure isn,t helping us compete in the world. This country was blessed before 1965, but now look. Would you want to run a company in this diverse country, or do as the companys are doing, going to other countrys that are homogenous? The seeds of destruction were planted in 1965 and the harvest is now upon us. We <span class="caps">LOOK </span>like we,ve been damned since 1965. We can,t win wars and where is all this bad weather coming from? From the divine? All i know is its one disaster after another. Maybe if we returned to the policys before 1965 we,d be blessed again. Did,t Pat also write a book called The Death Of The West? Hope i can get a chance to read it.</p>

					<p> Well said, Mr. Buchanan! This should be posted on every news website in America, and read verbatim over every TV and radio station. Of course, it won&rsquo;t be. The &#8220;African Americans&#8221; wouldn&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p> Barack Obama is just another in a long line of arrogant, condescending black &#8220;leaders&#8221; to lecture us White folks on what terrible villains we are, and how we must atone for our sins by ponying up yet more goodies for the poor, benighted blacks. Sadly, he won&rsquo;t get the stern lecture he should from White leaders for his brazen chutzpah. Already, the liberal media are scrambling to make him look like Mr. Heroic Black Man, challenging White America to have a &#8220;much-needed dialogue on race.&#8221; What a crock.</p>

					<p>The black people, apparently, do not even think as we do. That is my conclusion.</p>
<p>I have been listening to &#8220;talk radio&#8221; and people like Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity cannot even talk to these people!<br>
They are just too squirmy! </p>
<p>I honestly believe that Whites and blacks have two different modes of thought.</p>
<p>So why is it that Liberals have listened to them, not to us, and it has cost us &#8220;40 trillion tax dollars&#8221; and &#8220;forty years&#8221; of misery? </p>

					<p>When I listened to the &#8220;speech&#8221; it sounded like the ramblings of a person about to quit the race&hellip;.mumbling about his life history and his relatives&hellip;flacid excuses and coughs about how he knew more than the rest of the world. I took great encouragement that it was his &#8220;farewell speech&#8221;, whether he knew it or not. Privately, I think he might even admit that it surely was.</p>
<p>Never fear, he will be back in 2012. Shucks, he may just turn out to be the Norman Thomas of our age.</p>

					<p>Conservatives do not have a dog in this fight.  If McCain wins, conservative principles (those that are left) will be further degraded.  A McCain led Republican party will look very much like the Democratic party on social issues, and indeed, will be a continuation of Bush family policies.  Many erstwhile &#8220;conservatives&#8221; in the Republican party will find themselves forced to follow McCain&rsquo;s lead even though their constituents will not like it.  So voting for McCain will complete the destruction of any conservative voice in the Republican party and set up Democrats for decades to come.  How to stop this?  If conservatives will simply hold their noses and vote for Obama, it is likely that an Obama administration will turn out to be the most disastrous in American history&hellip;which will tar and feather liberals for half a century.   You may think this is wild talk, but not if you consider the slow poison of continuing with the current banking/corporate elite now running the Republican party.  Desperate times call for desperate measures.  Think counter intuitively and vote for Obama.  Give liberalism the rope it needs to hang itself!!!</p>

					<p>The reason why this man (Pat Buchanan) has never been elected president is beyond me.  His books are the most accurate documents available on what Western Civilization faces today.  Why hasn&rsquo;t there been anybody else in our society that has demanded an accurate number of anti-White murders in America?  Imagine how large the memorial wall list would be if somebody created one.</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, I was curious what all of you expect to happen when the black community absorbes the fact that Obama will not be in office?  My guess is major rioting across every major city in the <span class="caps">US.</span></p>

I don&rsquo;t think so) is responsible for black failings: we have been pretending that as groups the races are equal, and so giving blacks the excuse that all their failings in comparison with other races are due to racism.  Why give them money if we are not making amends for being racist?  Why indulge their criminality if not because we are making amends for our racism?  We teach them they are in fact a race just like our own, and that all differences in lifestyle between blacks and whites considered as groups are due only to racism.  So why should we complain when they say that every aspect of their lives that compares unfavorably with other races is due to racism?<br>
 <br><br>
Whites have to lead the way.  Buchanan says the black illegitimacy rate is 70%.  As if the white illegitimacy rate of what, 40% now, is so great?  Who&rsquo;s idea was it that illegitimacy was not so terrible?  That broken families in the name of personal fulfillment is acceptable?  Are these ideas that originated in the minds of the black intelligentsia?<br><br>
 <br><br>
Blacks, he says, are not grateful.  Fine.  Do we teach them to be grateful?  Do we teach them that our founders, even the ones that owned slaves, were noble and great men?  Do we teach them that they are responsible for their own actions, and that what they receive as a group is what they are able to achieve as a group in this free country of ours?  Do we teach them, as Buchanan wrote, that they should above all thank God that they were introduced to salvation?<br><br>
 <br><br>
Buchanan is angry at blacks.  I think he should be more angry at white liberals.  Was justice Earl Warren a black man?  The man that integrated public schools and desegrated everything?  That man that drove prayer and the Bible from our schools?  Who legitimized contraception?  Or the men of the Berger court that discovered abortion to be a constitutional right?  Was all that the work of black men, either in conception or in its becoming effected through our institutions?<br><br>
 <br><br>
Bablack is of course wrong about what whites need to do, as Buchanan rightly points out.  But what would he have us do?  He says we have done more than anyone to lift up blacks.  Well, that is precisely the problem.  You can&rsquo;t congratulate yourself in one moment for lifting someone up, and then in the next blame the person who says they need to be lifted up still as being ungrateful.  Either they need to be lifted up, or, the idea of lifting them up was completely wrongheaded to begin with.  So either keep lifting and shut up, whitey, or admit you made a huge mistake in pretending that inequalities necessarily imply injustice.<br><br>
 <br><br>
As for interracial crime, Buchanan is 100% right.  Why then is the white media silent about it?  Who to blame for encouraging this horror, then, but the white liberals that conceal it?  Is this the fault of the black owner of the NY Times?  The black owners of <span class="caps">NBC, CBS </span>and <span class="caps">ABC</span>?  The black chairs of the psychology, sociology and criminology schools in our colleges and universities?<br><br>
 <br><br>
Buchanan asks, are incarceration rates the fault of the black community itself, or white racism?  It is certainly not the fault of white racism.  That blacks are more prone to criminality is a fact of nature.  But whose fault is it that this tendency has been exacerbated?  Were blacks part of the Kerner commission that blamed riots on white racism?  Does Bill Cosby tell blacks to blame white people for their misbehavior?  Did Booker T?  In the case of crime, it is true, black leaders have not been guiltless in fostering an attitude that justifies it  &mdash;  Garvey, King, X.  But if whites had not agreed with those leaders&rsquo; view of race and racism, there would not be the plague of black crime to the extent it exists today.  But who first thought of the idea of crime as a legitimate means of self-expression?  The famous black philosopher Nietzsche?<br><br>
 <br><br>
&#8216;Take up the white man&rsquo;s burden.&rsquo;  That is the only way to save Western civilization, as, when Kipling wrote that line, it was the only way to spread it.  Nietzsche did not take up the white man&rsquo;s burden.  Nor justice Warren.  Nor does the <span class="caps">NYT. </span> You have to responsibly lead the way, or be in the way.  But either way, it will be up to white people, whether they choose to take it up, and save themselves and all, or commit suicide and at the same time extinguish the light for the rest.<br><br>
 <br><br>
<span class="caps">BTW </span>this implies, of course, having the courage to consciously elect a <span class="caps">POTUS </span>that is a white man.</p>

					<p>Memphomaniac wrote <i>&#8220;I took great encouragement that it was his &#8220;farewell speech,&rdquo;whether he knew it or not.</i></p>
<p>I think that is the correct insight. Obama is now stamped with the stain of being a race hustler in the minds of whites. Buchanan and the rest of the right-leaning commentators never came out this strongly against him before. Even the left-leaning commentators are now writing about him in a very different way, giving the topic of &#8220;race&#8221; a new edginess.</p>
<p>When people look back at this election, they will see the Wright affair, and the &#8220;race speech,&#8221; as turning points for the Obama campaign. (And this is true even if he gets the Deomocratic nomination.)</p>

					<p>Like Patrick, I am for any group of people to succeed.  And like Patrick, I will uphold the civil rights of any  group that is getting the shaft.  It will take a Patrick J. Buchanan type to be a civil rights leader for white people to raise awareness of what Patrick, myself, and hundreds of thousands of others have been saying i.e. the exact things that are in Patrick&rsquo;s article above.  Patrick J. Buchanan is an American role model to me.</p>

					<p>I agree 100%.Let&rsquo;s also not forget that the black community moans and groans about &#8220;whitey&#8221;, and are constantly asking for what &#8220;We&#8221; have.Blacks are adamant about equality,yet they see nothing wrong with their on prejudices. I&rsquo;m still waiting for the White Ms. America contest, the White Entertainment Telivision network,etc.And isn&rsquo;t it funny that black comedians constantly imitate the stereotypical white man &#8221; Golly Gee Willikers&#8221;!And it&rsquo;s just hilarious! But let a white comedian return the favor, and every black leader in the nation will be on it. I&rsquo;m not trying to spew hate here, I&rsquo;m just tired of the double standard.The simple hard truth is,the black community needs to stop with <span class="caps">THEIR </span>hate. Black leaders need to address the fact that most all of the black communities problems stem from the home. Criminals, Thugs, and losers having babies, and teaching them to become criminals, thugs, and losers, and to <span class="caps">HATE </span>&#8221; Whitey &#8220;. And lastly, the infamous &#8220;N&#8221; word. That word is used daily by most blacks, and put into songs, movies, articles, stand-up.Yet if I&rsquo;m heard in public qouting a black comedian, or singing a song with that in the lyrics, I&rsquo;m suddenly a racist, and would probably be out of a career! Seems to me, the black community has made some strides! </p>

					<p>TO Alex the Russian That wants an analitic on why whites are so suicidal to empower blacks that hate America and whites!   <span class="caps">GOOD </span>question &hellip; my take is a misuse on the idea of the (Apparent) virtue of admitting ones or ones racial errors particularly against another group. While being big enough to admit ones mistakes IS a virtue&hellip; what is taking place is actually  an imposter to a ludicrous degree, we have (Enervated Loosers) (Posers) selling their ancestors down the road instead of carrying the torch passed to them forward! It is a group (Sado-Masochism)fueled I believe in their (Subconscious) realization of their innability of matching the accomplishments of their ancestors and thus they delude themselves by falsely accusing condemning them (ancestors), thus creating the appearence of largeness in themselves! They vote for their own destruction because they are enervated Sado-masochists.</p>

					<p>   In my opinion, President Nixon was one of our best, albeit all too human presidents . It was he who finally ended the Vietnam War, not the hippies and the peaceniks as is being told today . I had followed the war since the seventh grade, when I was 16 my 20 yr old cousin I used to spend summers with died there, one of my highschool pal&rsquo;s brother died there . <span class="caps">LBJ </span>the so-called &#8220;Reluctant Warrior,&#8221; meant he was going to have that war or bust . And he taxed my poor working class Dad nearly into oblivion for his &#8221; guns and butter, Great Society.&#8221; So I found the thought of having to enter his endless meat grinder particularly chilling . I was a 19 year old airman sitting at my desk in my barracks when President Nixon started bombing the heck out of the maneuvering, conniving North Vietnamese who had turned mocking us at the Paris Accords into a science . And it was like . finally we had a president who was going to support the service man and if I had to go, then I was ready . As for Watergate, if any group ever needed bugging it would be the Lib-Dems .And today when I see them trying to make such a tragic, heroic figure of <span class="caps">LBJ </span>, I want to regurgitate .  </p>

You chose as you Conservative commentators always do, to ignore the part he defend the grievance of white people and try to mischaracterize him. I have been following you since Arizona caucus where you tried unsuccessfully to paint Obama as a Black candidate like Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton. Pat, your America is not the future of this country.

					<p>Buchanan points out the  disproportion  between blacks  and  whites in the  commission of  crimes  such as  rape  and  robbery. Putting aside whether the numbers claimed are  accurate, Buchanan does  not seem to realize  that  there  are approximately  10 times[factoring those  blacks in prison] more whites than  blacks  in  the  <span class="caps">U.S.</span></p>
<p>People  who commit  crimes of property and  abuse don&rsquo;t  really  care  about  the  race of  the  victim, so  it  will  follow that  blacks  who commit such  crimes  will  not  limit  themselves to  just  the  black  population.</p>

					<p>What ails the black people is not so much a history of segregation but simply a lack of respect and responisbility.  Blacks do a lot better in America than any other place on the planet - especially compared to countries that are mostly black (anybody look at the sad state of Haiti and the African continent lately??). If it was segregation and other US/domestic causes that ailed them blacks would not be disproportionately impoverished around the world as they are. Further, blacks consistantly fail to realize or admit that blacks enslaved blacks in Africa long before America was even a country - and still continue to enslave blacks today. So its not only not just a &#8216;Whitey&rsquo; problem but they also fail to realize and admit that most whites lived in the north in the 1600s to 1800s, Whitey fought a major war to free them, <span class="caps">AND </span>that a large % of whites came to America after the Civil War and have no links to slavery whatsoever. An article in I think it was Time magazine on &#8216;Race in America&rsquo; in the early 1990&rsquo;s pointed out that even black sociologists were saying basically something to the effect of &#8216;the best thing blacks can do to reduce what they perceive as racism is to control their own crime problems.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Its really sad, and even disgusting, how many if not most of them continue to blame others for their problems instead of realizing their own lack of responsibility.  The media and a failure in their leadership have perpetuated this and made it a huge problem.  A friend of mine moved here from another country about ten years ago and taught himself to speak english by reading an English dictionary and watching US TV shows. He had a strong work and study ethic, and then went on to become a professor at a local university. After only being in this country a few years he was amazed at the lack of work and study ethic by blacks. He said that, moreso than whites or hispanics, many blacks would always do poorly on tests and regularly miss classes and then whine at the end of the semester about their grades and claim the university system was racist or prejudiced against them.  Really sad &hellip;</p>

					<p>Are we asking too much to have one true leader stand up and say what the real problems are that black face (ie a lack of respect and responsibility) ??  This is not simply to put them down, but a problem cannot be fixed unless and until somebody admits what the real problem is.  The efforts by the government and the media (and the black community&rsquo;s so-called &#8216;leaders&rsquo;) to appease blacks in a feeble attempt to solve their problems only hurts them in the long run.  Its obviously a really, really sad situation &hellip;</p>

					<p>Another brilliant column by Patrick J. Buchanan, the man who <span class="caps">SHOULD HAVE BEEN ELECTED PRESIDENT.</span></p>
<p>No matter who wins the general election, the conservative/white citizens will have to abandon the Republican party and begin to develop a third-party alternative for 2012. The Constitution Party seems to address the issues and concerns of the white voters.</p>
<p>Because of Immigration, both legal and illegal, and declining birth rates, Whites are now 67% of the US population (pre-1965 Immigration Act, whites were 93%). The minorities are truly taking over. It&rsquo;s not just blacks supporting Obama, it&rsquo;s all the non-white minorities. Their goal is to break &#8220;Whitey&rsquo;s&#8221; grip on the Oval Office.</p>

					<p>Alex,</p>
<p>Welcome.  First, if you browse <span class="caps">AMREN </span>long enough, you will get the answers to your questions.</p>
<p>In brief, I believe:</p>
<p>1.  I have found that the irrationality many of us see in the behavior of whites and in the slant of news stories today can be rectified if you ask two questions:</p>
<p>    First: &#8220;Does the action in question make America more like it was in 1900 or less&#8221;.  If the action makes American less like it was in 1900, the liberal in question and the media will be for it.  </p>
<p>Examples:  Third World immigration, support of Islam, removal of anything Christian, higher taxes with wealth redistribution, interracial marriage, amnesty for illegals, the list is endless, as long as the action undoes the country we once were, the liberals promote it.  The &#8220;fairness&#8221; of an issue or &#8220;substituting &#8216;white&rsquo; instead of &#8216;black&rsquo;&#8221; in a story is irrelevant to them - changing the country is their goal.</p>
<p>      Second:  &#8220;All races or people are the same.&#8221;  Therefore, no matter how hard you work with you children, no matter how fair a test may be, if the results are not the same for all groups, the test, by definition, is racist.  </p>
<p>The same goes for economic success:  Whites are doing better than blacks, therefore society is racist.  On other explanation is allowed.</p>
<p>As far as why whites do it:</p>
<p>1.  As stated in the first point above, some truly want to undo our country - &#8220;elect a new people&#8221; that will allow them (liberals) to shape the country as they please.</p>
<p>2.  There are whites that truly think we haven&rsquo;t done enough to help blacks or that so much more needs to be done. &#8220;It&rsquo;s our fault.&#8221; These are the softheaded ones who are more concerned with a racial slur than the 3000 rapes of white women by blacks each year.</p>
<p>3.  There are whites who consider themselves and what to be seen as superior to other whites as they &#8220;nobly&#8221; support the advancement of blacks at the expense of their fellow whites.  These whites also feel to be immune to the effects of the world they are creating, as they live in gated communities.  Hillary, for one, is finding out right now that she is not immune, as the blacks that once supported her are turning to Obama 9 to 1.</p>
<p>4.  Never underestimate the power of the media to shape young minds.  For instance, they have avidly encouraged for decades white girls to pursue black men and the propaganda has worked, many naive white girls have had their lives ruined long before they were old enough to know better.</p>
<p>5.  Labels have helped also.   I have merely mentioned that &#8220;blacks are quick and jump well&#8221; and have been immediately told, &#8220;Adolph Hitler would have loved you.&#8221; Only a liberal could watch the Olympics and see blacks excel in sprints, white win in swimming and Indians win at nothing, and still conclude that there are no differences (but see Rule #2 above).</p>
<p>6.  Most Americans today have no concept of history and the sacrifices made to get us where we are today.  Most have no idea of the long term consequences of our current actions.  Ignorance is Bliss.<br>

					<p>Obama has to be one of the biggest scams in progress America has ever seen. He has blacks thinking he is black &amp; whites thinking he is white. He has capitalized on his outward black appearance by a startling cunning white mind using this fact as an assett. What gets me though is how both races bite on his promises of a better day ahead with him as president. Sorta smells like <span class="caps">JFK </span>revisited. Anyway, if you know anything of our political system then you realize that one person will never make any dramatic change. Our democracy had been designed to preclude that much power being alotted to that person. This is why we have three executive branches. So Obama&rsquo;s platform is nothing more than a scam to obtain votes both black and white. Americans need to ignore the empty promises he makes and look closely at the person now that his life is being more closely examined.</p>

					<p>Obama is ashamed that his White grandmother was afraid of Black men.  He sees this as racist.  However, many Black women and Black men are also afraid of Black men.  I once had a Black college student tell me that when he and his friends go out to party in a white neighborhood, they don&rsquo;t bring any weapons.  But if they are going into a Black neighborhood, they always carry weapons both on their persons and in the car. I had a Black woman tell me that she always locks the doors of her car when driving through Black neighborhoods, but does not do so in White neighborhoods.   Why did these two Blacks behave differently around their own kind?  Because they are not stupid   &mdash;   they know the truth.  There is a much, much higher probability of crime in a Black neighborhood.  <br>
     It is disingenuous and amoral for Obama to chastise his Grandmother for basing her opinions and behavior on facts and reality. It&rsquo;s not &#8220;racism,&#8221; it&rsquo;s common sense.  </p>

					<p>Jambar:</p>
<p>I know a lot of right-wingers are making a big deal about that paragraph in Obama&rsquo;s speech where he seems to defend white racial frustration.  However, read a little closer.</p>
<p>Obama recognizes white racial frustration, and certainly does not bash it. But reading between the lines, he thinks that the white working class was/is being suckered by the disposed &ldquo;Southern Strategy&rdquo; of the Republican Party, and by other nefarious elements. His solution is the Jesse Jackson strategy, where somehow every economically frustrated person of every race will unite under the banner of liberal populism. If any such movement were possible, there have been dozens of chances for it to materialize and thrive in my lifetime. That it has not means that it&rsquo;s not possible, though neither myself or anyone else, much less The Late Great Dr. Samuel T. Francis, has delved into an intellectual analysis to explain why not, though I would suspect that it would have something to do with the permanence of race.</p>
<p>Quite frankly, Mr. Obama, I don&rsquo;t go into certain areas of my own city after dark not for the fear of Enron, Arthur Andersen, Golden Parachutes or K Street.</p>

					<p>There are a number of comments in this thread wondering why <span class="caps">PJB </span>was never elected President.  Truthfully, he&rsquo;s coming around on race, especially black-white relations.  In the past, he always had a weak spot for the black civil rights movement, somehow thinking it was a good thing, and that American blacks were as American as anything.</p>
<p>That mentality led to his lassitude in using racial issues when campaigning in the South in 1996, and to his propensity to throw his own supporters under the bus who had at least tenuous links to the portions of the right wing not approved by the <span class="caps">ADL</span>/SPLC.  And its ultimate manifestation was Ezola Foster in 2000.</p>
<p>Still, he&rsquo;s far and away the best thing going for WNs and RRs.  I caucused for him in Missouri in 1996, and voted for him in November 2000, the crazy Miss Foster notwithstanding.</p>

					<p>Obama is ashamed that his White grandmother was afraid of Black men.  He sees this as racist.  However, many Black women and Black men are also afraid of Black men.  I once had a Black college student tell me that when he and his friends go out to party in a white neighborhood, they don&rsquo;t bring any weapons.  But if they are going into a Black neighborhood, they always carry weapons both on their persons and in the car. I had a Black woman tell me that she always locks the doors of her car when driving through Black neighborhoods, but does not do so in White neighborhoods.   Why did these two Blacks behave differently around their own kind?  Because they are not stupid   &mdash;   they know the truth.  In a Black neighborhood, there is a much, much higher probability of crime or violence against you.  <br>
     It is disingenuous and amoral for Obama to chastise his Grandmother for basing her opinions and behavior on facts and reality. It&rsquo;s not &#8220;racism,&#8221; it&rsquo;s common sense. </p>

					<p>Brilliant. Buchanan nailed it when he said:</p>
<p><i>Is white America really responsible for the fact that the crime and incarceration rates for African-Americans are seven times those of white America? Is it really white America&rsquo;s fault that illegitimacy in the African-American community has hit 70 percent and the black dropout rate from high schools in some cities has reached 50 percent?</i></p>
<p><b>Is that the fault of white America or, first and foremost, a failure of the black community itself? </b> (emphasis mine)</p>
<p>African-Americans (who have been dutifully acknowledged from &#8220;colored&#8221; to &#8220;Black&#8221; to now this term), have had so many opportunities and yet squandered most of them. Anyone who applies himself in this great country of ours <span class="caps">WILL </span>succeed. Period. Immigrants from other countries come here and get rich. It truly is the land of opportunity. Why is it that two newly-arrived Filipinos can work hard, save, and see their daughter become one of the most popular bloggers and writers of our day (Michelle Malkin) but yet someone who has had their family living here for centuries still can&rsquo;t hold down a job as a dishwasher?</p>
<p>How is that accomplished African-Americans such as Condoleezza Rice and Clarence Thomas are ridiculed for their success but yet the &#8220;Misery Merchants&#8221; continue to whine and wail about a &#8220;lack of opportunity&#8221; for the younger generation of African-Americans? You&rsquo;d think that they would be raising Rice and Thomas on a pedestal, extolling their virtues. </p>
<p>No. It is much easier to blame and to make excuses for one&rsquo;s lack of progress. It has become abundantly clear not only to Anglo-Saxons, but to native-born African immigrants that many African-Americans do not want to apply themselves at all. When it comes right down to it, most African-American young people hope to get famous and rich one of three ways: Professional Sports, Music, or Drugs.</p>

The weirdest thing about the Wright snippets isn&rsquo;t Wright himself   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s all the black people in the congregation cheering him on.  We need to play continuous loops (what an appropriate word!) of these sermon segments next Martin Luther King, Jr., Day.  <span class="caps">OK, </span>so now we all hold hands and sing, &#8220;We Shall Overcome.&#8221;  I don&rsquo;t think so!</p>

					<p>Buchanan points out the disproportion between blacks and whites in the commission of crimes such as rape and robbery. Putting aside whether the numbers claimed are accurate, Buchanan does not seem to realize that there are approximately 10 times[factoring those blacks in prison] more whites than blacks in the <span class="caps">U.S.</span></p>
<p>People who commit crimes of property and abuse don&rsquo;t really care about the race of the victim, so it will follow that blacks who commit such crimes will not limit themselves to just the black population.</p>
<p>Posted by <span class="caps">OCCAM </span>at 6:24 AM on March 22 </p>
<p>First of all, yes, the numbers are accurate.  Your hesitation to accept Buchanan&rsquo;s factual statistics shows that you are automatically operating with a bias and refuse to listen to Buchanan with an open mind.<br>
Also, if you believe that there are 10 times more whites in the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>than blacks, you obviously have problems with basic math.  Blacks make up about 13% of the population.  I&rsquo;m not a rocket scientist, but I think it would be impossible for whites to make up 130% of the population.  <br><br>
I agree with you that it would be naive to expect black criminals to only target other blacks, but statistics don&rsquo;t lie.  Considering the massive level of housing segregation in this country (especially for ghetto blacks who commit most of the crime) and considering that a lot of violent crime occurs within the family, if all things were equal and blacks were just targeting the nearest victim - over 90% of the victims of black crime would be black themselves.  Blacks are something like 10,000 times more likely to rape a white women than vice versa, so your argument that race is irrelevant in this regard is utter nonsense. </p>

Nothing what follows should be construed as a justification, apology or endorsement of slavery a human institution as old as mankind itself, which, for a brief interval was abolished but is now making a comeback in many parts of the world.</p>
<p>It is a matter of record that during the 19th century the average black field-hand, slave or free, was better fed and better housed than the average English miner and factory hand (and let&rsquo;s not even mention the fate of the Irish.)</p>
<p>In England, during the Industrial Revolution, a factory owner had no hesitation whatsoever of throwing a factory hand, once he was physically exhausted into the street to fend for himself as best as he could.  A slave-owner could not do so; a slave society won&rsquo;t let him.  The owner had to maintain that slave, no matter how minimal, until his death &mdash; a cradle-to-death welfare state, in fact.</p>
<p>Indeed, the typical English laborer, ill-feed and overworked became stunted &mdash; rickets was known as the &lsquo;English disease&rsquo; in Europe &mdash; and the British army was forced to lower its minimum height requirements from 5&rsquo;8&rdquo; (1815) to 5&rsquo;2&rdquo; (1914).  Further it created a culture of bitterness and hatred that has even now, four generations later, not quite dissipated. </p>

					<p>Obama equates Wright&rsquo;s racists and spiteful words with his grandmother&rsquo;s fear of Black men   &mdash;   as if the two are equal and balanced.  Obama is trying to make the point that &#8220;sure, there is misunderstanding on each side.&#8221;  However, the two incidents are totally unequal.  On one side, you have a woman who uses true facts and logic to increase her safety   &mdash;   notice that she is not out preaching about the evils of Black people, she simply is careful, the same way that you or I might be careful when approaching a big dog or group of rough-looking teenagers who are smoking &amp; drinking.  In contrast, Wright&rsquo;s comments are much, much more egregious.  His ideas are based on fantasy and illogical thinking   &mdash;   an inability to see the massive efforts made by this nation during the last 50 years for advancement of his people   &mdash;   all paid for by Whites.  Worst still, is the fact that he has been preaching these hateful and racist ideas to thousands of people, for 20 years, inciting them to hate Whites and hat America and to feel permanent victim hood. </p>
<p>When Grandma sees a Black man and then crosses the street, she harms no-one (and maybe saves herself).  In contrast, Wright&rsquo;s rantings assure thousands of Blacks that Whitey is evil and owes them, and that Blacks are morally obliged to seek revenge by mugging, assault, rape, &amp; murder of Whites.  This shows a major, major flaw in Obama&rsquo;s ability to think and reason.  And this from the guy who was supposedly going to bring us all together.  </p>

<p>Buchanan is referring to interracial rapes between blacks and whites.  By definition, it means the you have a white and a black involved in a crime.  And in those instances, if race were irrelevant, you would expect 50% of the time the attacker would be white and 50% of the time the attacker would be black.  But instead it runs 99 to 1 that the black guy is the attacker.  Buchanan is actually being very conservative with those statistics.   It is proabably worse.  It is statistically, very uncommon for the rapist to be white and the victim to be black.</p>
<p>The statistics also show that a black person is very safe in a white neighborhood, but a white person is very unsafe in a black neighborhood.  This is a statistical fact.  So with that in mind is it any wonder whites avoid black neighborhoods.  </p>
<p>Additionally, Hispanics are regarded as white if they commit a interracial crime, but they are regarded as Hispanic if they are a victim of interracial crime.  So the statistics are skewed again against whites.  But even so, the statistics still remain staggering for anyone honest enough to confront them.  <br>

Recent events have proven him a great prognosticator. </p>
<p>This so called speech unmasked him for the closet black supremacist that he really is.  Barack has finally been unmasked as a black nationalist who ardently supports black racial causes and thinks whites must bear the burden for improving race relations. </p>
<p>Then he attempts to take the sheen off Jeremiah Wright&rsquo;s comments by slandering his own grandmother as a racist who allegedly uttered horrible things about black men. I believe this is the same woman who raised him and sent him to the Ivy League so he could one day become the upstanding white and America hating mulatto that he&rsquo;s turned out to be.

					<p>Occam&rsquo;s difficulties with mathematics remain as profound as ever. White comprise about 65-67% of the population, blacks 13%. There are five times as many whites as blacks, not ten times. </p>
<p>In addition, blacks commit crimes both in greater raw numbers and in far greater per capita numbers than does any non-black population. In all categories of violent crime taken together blacks are between nine and ten times as violent as whites. Trying to message the brute reality to rig an interpretation favorable to blacks is the act of an innumerate or a dishonest idealogue. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not quite sure what your point is.  Any attempt by whites to &#8220;defend its genetic interests&#8221; is portrayed as an accusation of black inferiority whether it actually is or not.  Also, if you base the value of a racial group by its average intelligence and contributions to society then clearly blacks are &#8220;inferior&#8221; to every other group.  However, if you highly value the ability to play basketball and freestyle rap then I guess you have a valid point.</p>

					<p>Someday in the near future, the responsible segment of the White population in North America will have inadequate numbers to continue making the United States and Canada desirable places to live.

I believe it will take  no less than the building of concentration camps, slave labor and death chambers to wake the majority of the white race from thier guilt induced denial of the truths that the people of this site are working so hard to get them to see.<br><br>
 For there are none so blind, as he who will not see.</p>

					<p>Unfortunately, Pat&rsquo;s fine piece is marred by invoking Richard Nixon.  Affimative action, as a national policy, began under President Nixon.  Indeed, the Nixon administration even lobbied the <span class="caps">NAACP </span>to support it when labor-Democrats were decrying some aspects of Nixon&rsquo;s pro-Black double standards.<br>
Unfortunately, the <span class="caps">GOP&rsquo;</span>s liberal race policies did not end with Nixon.  Will McCain end AA?  End illegal immigration?  End giving AA preferences to illegals?<br><br>
Obama is simply another Black racist, but one who speaks standard American English.  Until now, he has provided hope for many whites who thought that his candidacy and election would end racial racial problems.  Obama was for them their great &#8220;white&#8221; hope.  Now he is exposed as a white hater who can make a good speech.  He is simply today&rsquo;s Malcolm X.<br><br>
So the choice today is Hitlery, Obamanation, and Bomb a Nation.  If only Pat were running!  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  HM</p>

					<p>&#8220;It is statistically, very uncommon for the rapist to be white and the victim to be black.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, yes, 200 years ago the stats were reversed, so what?  Unlike most white people, I have had the experience of going to Africa on two occasions.  The first thing you notice about the people in West Africa is that they are not black but <span class="caps">BLACK, </span>as in midnight, can&rsquo;t tell where the hair ends and the skin begins black. You rarely find those type of people here.  That means that practically <span class="caps">ALL</span> American blacks have some white heritage.  </p>
<p>Does that mean that black men were raping white women 200 years ago?  OF course not, that was an instance death sentance for not only the black male, but probably his family also.  And any white woman in a volunatry relationship with a black male would have been beaten to within an inch of her life by her white father or brother.  </p>
<p>So does that mean white gentlemen were coming to their slaves quarters with a boquet of roses and a box of candy?  </p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like the rape of white women more than anyone else does, but one trip to Africa will convince you that our forefathers were no princes and maybe there is some truth to the &#8216;chicken coming home to roost.&rsquo;</p>

					<p>Please someone answer me!!!!!!<br>
The problem I have is this. It doesn&rsquo;t matter which one of the three gets elected. They each would grant amnesty to the 30 mil. or so illegals in the <span class="caps">US.</span> At that point they could then petition for entry to the US for a relative (let&rsquo;s say just one per.) So that means 30 mil. would become approx. 60 mil. in the time span of a few years. If this holds true, then whites are dead as a majority. End Game ?????? Please tell me why not. Give me some hope.</p>

<p>Hello John.  First, as far as us being a minority, you might want to read my post under the article &#8220;Race Haunts Election After Shooting&#8221; Posted by Dedalus at 3:16 PM on March 22. </p>
<p><br>
That aside, you&rsquo;re probably right, whoever gets in is going to throw the doors wide open unless someone stops them.  But I have to say, I don&rsquo;t know if hope is what we&rsquo;re looking for now.  I think what we&rsquo;re looking for is - courage.  And when you think of what is happening now in that respect, yes, it is sometimes difficult to resist the temptation to succumb to despair. </p>
<p>Personally, I can&rsquo;t go there.  It may be understandable, but it&rsquo;s just not necessary right now.  Plus, it is SO undignified.  It is exactly because what is needed now is courage that if we don&rsquo;t respond accordingly then we will be living out of the opposite of courage - cowardice.  And that I just won&rsquo;t let happen.  <span class="caps">BUT,</span> Courage does not mean foolhardiness; it doesn&rsquo;t mean we should be rash, or out of control.</p>
<p>What we need are Powers of Example.  And the good news is, there is nothing stopping you, myself, and any poster here, or anyone anywhere else, from being one. Not to mention the fact that there already are some Powers of Example out there.  But one has to have a clue.  A person <span class="caps">HAS </span>to know that thinking about this stuff, experiencing it, <span class="caps">CAN </span>be traumatizing. It can make you feel ashamed and confused and afraid to reach out. Neither the touchy-feely Left-wing approach, or the pseudo, and pscyho, tough guy, macho thing of the Right, are going to be of any help.  Both are corny and unrealistic. One is too soft and the other too crude.  <br>
I think a person has simply got to be right with themselves Physically, Intellectually, Psychologically, Emotinoally and Spiritually. Even though I am not of the Left or Right it is obvious that the danger to Mankind today is coming from the Left. So, they must be fought, and the problem met, head on.<br><br>
How to do this? I certainly don&rsquo;t have all the answers.  But I think Goethe is right, Action has magic, power, and grace.  If you take steps to be right with yourself you are going to have something to contribute to what needs to be done to beat them.  <br><br>
One thing for sure, without a doubt, being alone in your head with this stuff is dangerous. But you know this instinctively; and you gave expression to that need by posting here.  So, you&rsquo;ve already taken a step.  There&rsquo;s your hope John C, there&rsquo;s your courage.<br><br>

					<p>You hear black bigotry being justified because &ldquo;whites haven&rsquo;t been through what blacks have&rdquo;. That is the <span class="caps">BIG LIE.</span> Black &#8220;grievances&#8221; against whites are based on present day <span class="caps">MYTHS </span>and paranoia mostly reflecting blacks&rsquo; <span class="caps">OWN </span>rampant racism and fruits of their <span class="caps">OWN </span>destructive behavior, encouraged by this very racial scapegoating. And based on irrelevant grievances regarding things that happened between different people long dead and gone: And even these irrelevant &#8220;historical&#8221; grievances are distorted and cherry-picked: For instance you never hear about the whites who fought slavery, from the white Abolitionists to the white Northern soldiers of the Civil War, or the fact that it was none other than black Africans who operated and completely controlled the African slave trade.<br>
On the other hand, white grievances against blacks are <span class="caps">REAL </span>and involve the people living <span class="caps">TODAY </span>and the <span class="caps">PRESENT.</span> We&rsquo;re talking about such things as the one million whites who are victims of violence at the hands of blacks each year in this country, twelve times the reverse, including 30,000 black on white rapes each year, the reverse nearly non-existent. (And this scale of one-sided black on white racial atrocities has been going on for <span class="caps">HALF</span> A <span class="caps">CENTURY </span>now.) <br><br>
We&rsquo;re talking about legalized Jim-Crow style racial discrimination against whites in every sphere of life in this country. <br><br>
We&rsquo;re talking about visceral hate-whitey propaganda that permeates academia, media, and popular culture.<br><br>
Blacks have nothing to talk about. Blacks are the most privileged race in this country. Blacks are the most <span class="caps">RACIST </span>race in this country. Whites are the <span class="caps">LEAST </span>racist and most self-sacrificing race. <br><br>
It is <span class="caps">WHITES </span>who have a <span class="caps">REAL </span>basis for racial rage. Not blacks. Let a black be turned into a white and dropped in the middle of any black neighborhood in this country: Then he&rsquo;d find out a little about what <span class="caps">WHITES </span>&ldquo;are going through&rdquo;.<br><br>

					<p>The problem with older whites instilling pro-white views into the mind set of younger whites is that the whole educational system is geared to avoid that happening. While private schools are generally better than public ones, particularly in the South, they still are part of the overall cultural trends and don&rsquo;t want to appear reactionary.</p>
<p>In a private school in the Low Country of South Carolina I recently taught at, for example, the school had originally been founded in the 1960&rsquo;s to avoid school integration, like many of the academies springing up all over during that decade. But despite having an almost all white student body, at least 20 minutes of an assembly in February, 2007 was dedicated to Martin Luther King, Jr. and his memory and legacy, while not a word was spoken about Robert E. Lee when his birthday came along.</p>
<p>What has been going on in the South is that the middle class white parents have their children either attend private schools, or within the public schools have them in special academic classes which have almost all whites and only a few, if any, blacks. The lower class and non-college bound white students then get put into classes with high numbers of blacks, and so in a sense the poor white youth in the South are abandoned by their more upscale brethren.</p>
<p>The middle class whites in the South who have learned the cultural rules of the game don&rsquo;t want to be &#8220;backward&#8221; and seen as &#8220;non-progressive&#8221; so they go along with token integration and buy into the idea that all in the South was evil until the Civil Rights movement came along. They have been deracinated for the most part, and they will only change their ways if an economic collapse provides a wake up call that whites are going to have to think as a minority group since none of the other groups are losing their respective self-identies.</p>
<p>There are certain organizations that could help more with trying to educate white youth, like Sons of Confederate Veterans, but they are generally into nostalgia for the &#8220;lost Cause&#8221; or are hobbyists. The average age of the chapter members must be 40-50 years, and there is little outreach to young people that I am aware of.</p>
<p>As far as trying to educate young whites on an individual, one to one basis, this obviously is only effective up to a point.</p>
<p>Where do we go from here? As I said before, whites will have to realize that they are close to becoming a minority group, and possibly the term &#8220;European-American&#8221; should become the term of choice, just as African-American seems to be the new term to replace &#8220;black.&#8221; Maybe March could become White History Month, so as to recognize positive contributions of whites to <span class="caps">U.S.</span> History and allow white youth to feel proud of their heritage - but don&rsquo;t hold your breath while waiting for this to happen.</p>

It&rsquo;s just that I&rsquo;ve listened to Obama speak for a year now and he doesn&rsquo;t say anything. He is a master of empty, non-commital talk. The little he does say reeks of big government intervention into peoples lives. I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I&rsquo;ve had enough of that, including the money big government steals in taxes from Americans to support millions of people who don&rsquo;t belong here.</p>

<p>I agree with much of what Pat writes, including the article above. Yet, when Pat was gaining widespread support the last time he ran for President, he self-destructed by choosing a Black woman as his running mate. </p>
<p>Likewise, last year, when Ron Paul began enjoying additional support for his views, he began to publical distance himself from his core supporters.</p>
<p>If Pat or Ron would have stepped up and said, &#8220;I am proud to be White and I want to represent the best interests of my people,&#8221; I would have continued supporting them. </p>
<p>Of course, in our socialist society, neither would have been elected, but their support would have been far greater than either of them experienced with their confounded moves to shy away from their base of support.</p>

					<p>The sad thing, the truly tragic thing, is the everyday commitment that black men have to intimidating white folks.  I have never run from Urkel down the street.  If he dresses like a regular white guy, with a white shirt and tie, most white folks have little if any fear.  Urkel&rsquo;s clothes telegraph to me his desire to fit in, to &#8220;act white&#8221;, to be respectable, to get a job. They signal our shared values.</p>
<p>But too many regular black men like to dress like hoodlums and gangsters.  They delight in scaring white people.  They revel in the fear.  They feed on the fear.  </p>
<p>Rather than blaming people for being afraid, I take a different approach, and I have taught my sons to take a different approach.</p>
<p>I know that my presence scares women who approach me on the street after dark in our college town.  I know I don&rsquo;t rape, but I don&rsquo;t get sullen and nasty about it, intimidating every woman I pass because she is a sexist for being scared of me.  No! I go to the other side of the street. </p>
<p>But so many black men are sullen self-pitiers who revel in the female fear they create.  And for other black men, like Obama, white women of any background, even their own mothers and grandmothers, are evil racists.  For so long as black men do not want to assimilate, do not want to take responsibility for the fear that they and their brothers create, for so long as they blame white women for the fear they feel, then there will be no improvement in race relations.</p>

<p>Let us start businesses that support white folks, just as blacks support businesses that support black folks.  There is no reason not to.  Amen?</p>

					<p>I dearly wish that Ron Paul would be our next President.  Unfortunately, he has absolutely no chance of winning whatsoever.</p>
<p>The racist Rev. Jeremiah Wright, who preaches racist hatred toward whites, Jews, and America, is Barack Obama&rsquo;s pastor and is tolerated by liberals and blacks.</p>
<p>But here is this double-standard: suppose John McCain&rsquo;s pastor was David Duke?  I am sure those same liberals and blacks throw a huge fit!  </p>
<p>I cannot say that I am not a bigot, because as human beings, we all have our own personal predjudices.  We, as human beings, all have our own individual, inner Archie Bunker.</p>
<p>However, I still do not like those who deliberately preach bigotry whether it is a black hatemonger like Jeremiah Wright or Louis Farrakhan, or a white hatemonger like David Duke. </p>
<p>One of the things I do like about American Renaissance, is the way it objectively reports about the problem of black racism, by giving it egual time.  </p>

<p>  Alex, you have to understand that we have a whole education system that instills guilt into white people for &#8220;racism&#8221; and the &#8220;legacy of slavery&#8221; Whites are brainwashed like Russians were under communism.</p>
<p> Whites feel quilty about historical events that they are not responsbile for on a personal level. It&rsquo;s interesting that blacks want whites to feel collectively guilty for racism and slavery and yet blacks won&rsquo;t collectively accept responsibilty for black pathologies like crime, drug addiction and illegitimacy. Of course, I exclude black truth tellers like Cosby, Sowell, and Williams from that other irresponsible bunch that seems to include Senator Obama.<br>

					<p>Quotes from Obama that I had to respond to.  It&rsquo;s from an article posted at isteve.blog and <span class="caps">VDARE. </span> It&rsquo;s his response to a question about his &#8220;Throw Grandma from the Train&#8221; speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she is a typical white person&rdquo;<br>
Yeah, she&rsquo;s wary of the typical black person.  <br><br>
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s a reaction that&rsquo;s been bred in our experiences&rdquo;<br><br>
Yeah, it&rsquo;s called various things; like self-preservation, self-defense, or more simply, <span class="caps">SURVIVAL</span>! The most fundamental impulse of existence for any living creature; and it&rsquo;s something you want to remove from us through a relentless process of psychological conditioning, for a reason!  Though, of course, you won&rsquo;t say what that reason is; and guys like Alter will pretend that &ldquo;reason&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t exist.  <br><br>
&ldquo;that don&rsquo;t go away&rdquo; –  <span class="caps">FOR</span> A <span class="caps">REASON. </span> Again, that &ldquo;reason&rdquo;, in this case, is called - Survival. &ldquo;and that sometimes come out in the wrong way,&rdquo; Yes!, Like, for example, when Whites foolishly trust Blacks against all personal experience, common sense, and in your face crime statistics, so as to avoid being accused of racism. &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s just the nature of race in our society.&rdquo; Well, yes, thanks to the tireless work of people like Jonathan Alter and yourself and countless others (c. above comment on Psychological conditioning).  </p>
<p>I am sorry for him that he is the product of two extremely selfish people.  I know what that is like. But the work I had to do to right the wrong of being the deposit of two irresponsible adult-children; the respect I gained for Family-Systems Psychology; the whole breakdown/breakthrough of Original Pain Work; has made it impossible for me not to see, not only how relevant and useful it is for so many people today - in fact, it&rsquo;s desperately needed across the board. Of that I have no doubt now; but, also, just how badly a man like Obama was damaged by his own experience.  This person is in desperate need of some serious counciling. Now. <br>
As things stand at this moment, he is the Poster Adult-Child of Codependency, Personally, Politically, and Culturally. <br><br>
The <span class="caps">ONLY </span>hope for him is to separate, and individuate, as they say. But in between the two (serpation and individuation) comes the bottom one invaribably hits as they move away from dependency on the environment, meaning - enablers, to self-reliance. <span class="caps">THAT </span>is what is meant by, &ldquo;moving on.&rdquo; <br><br>
But, of course, barring a miracle, that will never happen.  Instead of facing him self his entire life has turned into one protracted and elaborate ego-defense.  It&rsquo;s so big now that if he should ever have a breakdown, well, everybody&rsquo;s gonna know about it.   <br><br>

					<p>I am not even particularly familiar with Ron Paul whose name keeps coming up here.  There is one thing that I am certain of though.  Conservatives who are unhappy with John McCain could have gotten a candidate they liked if their focus had been on the republican primaries.  My dad is right that conservatives were too busy trying to do in Hillary to even notice that they were promoting a dangerous black bigot and allowing a republican candidate they didn&rsquo;t like to cruise to the nomination.  What exactly is it that conservatives are trying to conserve in this nation anyway?      </p>

					<p>Alex, you have to understand that we have a whole education system that instills guilt into white people for &#8220;racism&#8221; and the &#8220;legacy of slavery&#8221; Whites are basically mentally ill in America and Great Britain.</p>
<p> Whites feel quilty for things they are not responsbile for on a personal level. It&rsquo;s interesting that blacks want whites to feel collectively guilty for racism and slavery and yet blacks won&rsquo;t collectively accept responsibilty for black pathologies like crime, drug addiction and illegitimacy. Of course, I exclude truth tellers like Cosby, Sowell, and Williams from the irresponsible bunch that seems to include Senator Obama.<br>

					<p>&#8220;Pats got it right. But facts mean nothing in Racismland. We could give every black in America a million dollars and they would still blame whitey for everything.&#8221;</p>

Sorry but incorrect. They would blow that $ in a year on expensive cars, jewlery, and homes. <span class="caps">THEN </span>blame racist gov&rsquo;t for seizing said home for not paying property taxes the next year. They would overlook the on going cost of taxes/maintenance/etc and lose everything in a short period of time. Their failure as a race to plan out further than today is a result of their evolution and genes (which shaped their culture). So they would be demanding another $1M, then another, ad finitum. And true, not all would be stupid, but 95% would.</p>

					<p>Please somebody enlighten me&hellip; I just do not understand something. Obama claims to be a unifier, somebody in which everyone can and will find common ground. How can that be?</p>
<p>Draw a long horizontal line. That line will contain 100 dots, representing 100 senators and where they lie on the left-right spectrum. The lefties will cluster toward the left part of the line and right part of the line will contain most of the righties. These dots are based on their voting records.</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s dot would be the leftmost end point of the line. How can someone like that, at either end of this line, claim to be a unifier? If you are at either end, you are a radical with ideas who cannot be called mainstream, and your ideas will have very little appeal to anyone but the people who voted for you (if that). Its amazing that anyone with half a brain could believe him when he says this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>That being said, the dots at the rightmost part of this line hold more appeal to me. And I&rsquo;m not looking for a &#8220;unifier&#8221;.</p>

					<p>Hello friends,</p>
<p> Living with the creeping sensation of what is occurring to our people both here and in Europe easily casts one into a deep despair which has a profoundly negative effect.  Thus I, like many of you, return to this site (and others like it) in hope of some kind of cathartic relief. However, even this is fleeting. How can it be otherwise when all one sees is the perpetual ridicule, derision, and hate of everything European? When miscegenation of European women is encouraged through advertisements and entertainment (the next Vogue magazine cover for example will feature the world&rsquo;s top model, the blond-blue eyed Brazilian of German extraction, Giselle Bunchen, in the arms of none other than Lebron James the basketballer). These sorts of psychological attacks are constant without cease, and without quarter. By reading the comments on this board, one can feel that the despair, and pessimism is overwhelming. I too succumb to it often. <br>
Yes the situation is dire, and we are outnumbered: we defend against just about every non-white out there, as well as that massive sect that bolsters them: traitorous white-liberals. <br><br>
However, what have each of us done to counter this onslaughts?<br><br>
Other than visit such sites to vent, and find some kind of solace, I am accurate in assuming the answer would be: nothing, or not much. <br><br>
It is obvious what first hurdle that needs to be overcome, and which I am certain is our greatest enemy: that is <span class="caps">STIGMA.</span><br><br>
The media&rsquo;s number one weapon is stigma, this is why they never fail to paint non-conformists with the scarlet letter the first chance they get.  <br><br>
Stigma must be overcome, or in the alternative whites must create a secondary but sublime economy, one independent of big business America, where the brave but ostracized of us can still secure sustenance for themselves and their family, not only financially, but emotionally as well, otherwise we have no chance. By being dependent on the monster that seeks to kill us, there is no realistic chance of dissent or sedition. <br><br>
However in the interim, there are the smaller tasks we must all undertake. <br><br>
How many people in your immediate sphere are you influencing? <br><br>
This should be perpetual; however, though more subtle and strategic. <br><br>
We should each alert at least one new person that would become as horrified as ourselves. <br><br>
We should donate money to the cause, to such a site as this, and/or others like it. <br><br>
Only this way can stigma be overcome, and a true organization come to fruition. <br><br>
If one cowers at being labeled by one&rsquo;s enemies then all is hopeless. It is understandable that careers are a necessity, but in the interim we must all at the very least take baby steps, simultaneously and perpetually. <br><br>

<p>Posted by at 12:28 PM on March 23</p>
<p>You remind me of a line I read many years ago: &#8220;All Indians in South America always walk in single file.  At least, the one I saw did.&#8221;</p>
<p>Africa is a big place, and not all Africans look the same.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, the chickens you are talking about would all by now be well over a century old.  Nobody alive today raped any slaves, nor was raped by any slave-owner, nor was prejudiced in any way by any such putative rape.  Furthermore most people alive at the time were not involved in either the slavery nor the alleged rapes. And most Americans are not descended from the alleged rapists or any slave-owner.  Don&rsquo;t you think that old excuse for bad behaviour is wearing a bit thin?<br>

					<p>  For those who allege that planters sired their own slaves by force, first I would say that men will be men and women will be women regardlss of race . We see this every time we fight a foreign war .Go get an early seventies highschool annual from the South . This would be in the early days of the enforcement of Brown vs Board . What you will see are some very pure bred kids from both races . So while mixing does occur and always will, until forced integration arrived it was relatively rare and on those rare occasions it was nearly always mutual and not rape .  </p>

					<p>Now, yes, 200 years ago the stats were reversed, so what? Unlike most white people, I have had the experience of going to Africa on two occasions. The first thing you notice about the people in West Africa is that they are not black but <span class="caps">BLACK, </span>as in midnight, can&rsquo;t tell where the hair ends and the skin begins black. </p>
<p>   I can&rsquo;t help but think that you have never lived in the South.<br>
We have many blacks that are as black as any African. I reject your assumption that all American blacks have white blood. Many blacks have mixed with Native Americans, and are proud to claim as much. Some in the Southwest have mixed with Mexicans. </p>
<p>As far as the widespread myth of rape on the plantation, just what was the master&rsquo;s wife doing while master was mixing it up in the slaves quarters? I suppose she was happy to get some disease from her husband? Prostitution was legal in the old South so that black slaves weren&rsquo;t the only outlet for the baser desires. I&rsquo;m sure some attractive slave women tried to improve their lamentable condition by having sex with whites. I don&rsquo;t blame the unfortunate women, and I don&rsquo;t defend slavey which was a hideous and inhuman institution. </p>
<p>Yes, probably some evil masters did rape their slaves. Was it as widespread as many blacks believe?  I don&rsquo;t believe it was.  Go to South Carolina or Mississippi and see for yourself. The blacks are darkest in the former slave states. </p>

					<p>To Nit Pickers above:</p>
<p>Re my claim that  there  are  10 times  as many whites in <span class="caps">U.S. </span>than  there  are  blacks  was  merely to  choose an  approximate decile  round  number  &mdash;  which by  the way  was  not far  off  the  mark. About 70% of  Hispanics are  white[what  does &#8220;white non-Hispanic mean?]and  many  immigrants  from parts  of  Asia  are  also  considered white  in the  <span class="caps">U.S.</span></p>
<p>Furthermore, my  black-white ratio is  justified because at  any time a  relatively large number of blacks are in prison plus  the  fact  that those  who  commit property and  abuse would tend  to seek out those  with  more  property and  seek out  those  not in their immediate neighborhoods. If it so  happens  that  whites fit into  this  latter category then  they  would be  more the  victims of such  transgressions.</p>
<p>But my  point still  stands: whether a  black-white  ratio of  1 to 7 or 1 to 10, individuals  who seek  to  commit  crimes  opportunistically would necessarily target  more  whites  than  blacks. And  that holds for both blacks and  whites who  commit such crimes.</p>
<p>Again, Buchanan was  conceptually  wrong. I may have been  just a bit off on a minor detail.</p>

<p>Great post Joe.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve expressed the same sentiment here from time to time. In doing so I came to realize that there&rsquo;s only so much we can do at once.  Or, step by step.</p>
<p>Actually, I think an entire week of articles and posts should be devoted to this topic of what we should do.  There is so much that needs to be done.</p>
<p>I believe that any action that does not rest on some pretty firm principles, is doomed.  Fully aware that I am not going to launch into exactly what those principles should be in a post being written just before bedtime, I&rsquo;ll stop there.</p>
<p>But I will say this for now.  Personally, I think the focus of anything we might organize should be based on a few things.<br>
For now I&rsquo;ll list three.</p>
<p>1- Freedom of Speech</p>
<p>2- Freedom of Association.</p>
<p>3- A Commitment to Reality (as I understand it, this is the basis of Race Realism, as well as, Immigration Realism).</p>
<p>Also, implied in the above are a few other things.  Like the fact that lots of us here are still pretty new to all of this and are still checking it out, so to speak.  We&rsquo;re concerned, we care, we&rsquo;re saddened and distraught, even traumatized by what is going on today, not to mention disoriented by the rapidity of the changes taking place.  But we still don&rsquo;t know exactly what <span class="caps">CAN </span>be done; or what should be done and when.  </p>
<p>I believe that if we show up, pay attention, and talk to each other, in good faith, then a lot of questions will be answered and a lot of our anxieties will be erased; though certainly not all of them.  Not now at any rate.  But hell, after what so many of us have been through already, I think the fact that we have a forum, and not just one, is proof that things are looking up.</p>
<p>The other important thing is that we have to be aware, and accepting, of the fact that we are no monolith.  We&rsquo;re probably almost entirely White.  But there <span class="caps">ARE </span>some people of mixed-race who have posted here expressing a sympathy with us and desire to participate.  And from what I&rsquo;ve noticed, most people here have been pretty welcoming to them. That&rsquo;s as it should be in my opinion (which is all I&rsquo;m expressing here).<br>
Also, we&rsquo;re both Jewish and Gentile; and an open and respectful dialogue between the two is, in my view, essential, for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m glad you posted Joe Z, keep coming back.</p>

<p>Yes but the other side of this is that we cannot afford be idle spectators and allow our most vulnerable representative, namely our children, be indoctrinated at school.  For example, my child recently did a book report on Rosa Parks and I was reviewing it with her prior to her submitting it for a grade.  Since she was only told about black slavery (what a surprise) I retrieved the book &#8220;They Were White and They Were Slaves&#8221; and we read for a bit about the hideous 19th century &#8220;Factory System&#8221; of white child laborers in Britain.  The book has some photographs of white child laborers dressd in filthy rags and white ex-slaves.  I could go on about the book but the point is that whites must be much more proactive than they have been and activate against this hate propaganda directed at our kids.  White people got into this mess by partly by passively tolerating all the distortions and lies about our history.  </p>

Does anyone know about an &ldquo;anti-profiling law&rdquo; Obama supposedly helped pass as a state legislator? I heard it&rsquo;s forced the Illinois State Police to pull over more whites to match the stats of non-whites pulled over. So one demographic of little old ladies, whose cars have, say, faulty blinker lights, must be pulled over now, if that&rsquo;s what it takes to match the numbers of others pulled over for, say, car theft or kidnapping. </p>
<p>Did he not also boast about marching <span class="caps">WITH </span>the illegal aliens who demanded amnesty last summer? Granted, that may make him &ldquo;conservative,&rdquo; since President Bush wants the same (heh, heh). But Obama&rsquo;s utopia must be made clearer to most Americans – or are they really brainwashed and cowed enough to let an extreme left wing, white hater, deceive and play the race card all the way to the White House? Hmmm &hellip; </p>
<p>On the matter of how most Black Americans gained white genes, when you peruse old pictures of slaves, they mostly look jet black   &mdash;   African black. So a great of deal of miscegenation may in fact have occurred after slavery. Even during slavery, there were free blacks, both north and south. Mixing, during or after slavery, may well have appealed to black women. Women are generally attracted to men with more resources or higher status. </p>
<p>Granted (or arguably), slaves, by definition, weren&rsquo;t in a position to freely choose. But custom and law, in the past, would have constrained any perquisites or attraction individual whites may have felt toward blacks. It&rsquo;s hard to believe whites desiring blacks would have been more common then than now. It&rsquo;s just that over time, any two populations, sharing space, will mix. Finally, mulattos themselves had children, creating ever more mixed blacks, who, over generations, may have thrived and become more prevalent than pure African blacks.  </p>
<p>In contrast, the only PC-accepted story – &ldquo;rape&rdquo; – seems less plausible, not that it never, ever happened. Me, I just can&rsquo;t see that it could explain, generally, how &ldquo;African Americans&rdquo; received their white blood. </p>

<p>Wrong both times. Where do you get this stuff? Linda Chavez? Most hispanics are not white and are not counted as white in the census. &#8220;Non-hispanic white&#8221; is government pig Latin and has no significance here, since &#8220;hispanics,&#8221; for whom &#8220;mestizos&#8221; is a more accurate term, are a separate group in census figures. Few of these people have significant white genetic heritage, which you can generally tell merely by looking at them.</p>
<p>Blacks are many, many times likelier to target whites than vice versa; random violent crime is nearly always black on white. Nor do disparities in numbers explain this, since, given housing patterns blacks usually have to go out of their way to find white victims.</p>
<p>These excuses for black criminality, never very convincing, become more desperate and lame every day.</p>

					<p>For decades I accepted the common assumption that so many American blacks have been &#8220;stepped on&#8221;  by rape in plantation days. (&#8220;Stepped on&#8221; being the metaphor many of them use in referring to their mixed blood, comparing it to the successive dilution of heroin in preparation for its final street sale).</p>
<p>My eyes were opened to the many other possibilities by a long article written here in Berkeley about one of this city&rsquo;s &#8220;black&#8221; icons, a somewhat light-skinned elderly black lady of long political activism, whose portion of white blood came about from an ancestor who was a young white man from Georgia who had ended up impoverished in Arkansas and was taken in by a black family there, where he fell in love with and married one of the daughters.</p>
<p>Something about that story appeals to me, certainly more than the &#8220;we were all raped&#8221; nonsense does. </p>
<p>Such liasons must have happened often, with such large numbers of both races being in contact with each  other.</p>

					<p>&#8220;But my point still stands: whether a black-white ratio of 1 to 7 or 1 to 10, individuals who seek to commit crimes opportunistically would necessarily target more whites than blacks.&#8221;<br>

<p>First, a little lesson in statistics. If you take any <span class="caps">RANDOM </span>&#8220;X&#8221; percent of the population, the absolute number of that X% group murdered by the remainder of the population <span class="caps">WILL EQUAL </span>the number of the remainder of the population murdered by the X% group. And it does not matter what the value of X is. So the number of whites murdered by blacks <span class="caps">SHOULD </span>equal the number of blacks murdered by whites, all things being random. But it does not. Many more whites are murdered by blacks than blacks by whites. But there is even more to the story than that. Whites avoid black neighborhoods like the plague. On the other hand, blacks freely go about (and live in) white neighborhoods. If whites went about black neighborhoods any time day or night as freely and without caution as blacks do in white neighborhoods, the number of whites murdered by blacks would <span class="caps">SKYROCKET. </span></p>

					<p>&#8220;Now, yes, 200 years ago the stats were reversed, so what? &hellip;&hellip;So does that mean white gentlemen were coming to their slaves quarters&hellip;one trip to Africa will convince you that our forefathers were no princes and maybe there is some truth to the &lsquo;chicken coming home to roost.&rsquo;&#8221;<br>

<p>Why is it so difficult for some people to grasp that what did or did not happen among completely <span class="caps">DIFFERENT </span>people, in fact long <span class="caps">DEAD AND GONE, </span>is <span class="caps">COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT </span>to <span class="caps">ANYTHING </span>happening between <span class="caps">DIFFERENT PEOPLE TODAY</span>? What does <span class="caps">ANY </span>of the 30,000 white women raped by black males each year in the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>today have to do with <span class="caps">ANYTHING </span>that one wishes to speculate happened <span class="caps">BEFORE EVEN SHE</span> OR <span class="caps">HER RAPIST WERE EVEN ALIVE</span>? Bringing up such <span class="caps">IRRELEVANT </span>things is the very <span class="caps">ESSENCE </span>of &#8220;racism&#8221;. The <span class="caps">ONLY </span>thing that is relevant is what is happening <span class="caps">TODAY, </span>among people <span class="caps">LIVING TODAY.</span> Is that so hard to grasp?</p>
<p>And in any case, your version of history itself is based on a big <span class="caps">MYTH</span>: That admixture did not occur due to rape. It is a myth that white slave owners routinely raped their slaves. Such incidents were rare. Slave owners did not go around raping slave women because that would have completely disrupted the economic operation of the plantation and the products of such acts would have scandalized the family and the community. Read, for instance,  &#8220;Time On the Cross&#8221; by (1993 Nobel Laureate) Robert William Fogel and Stanley L. Engerman.<br>
If you look in the deep South the blacks show almost no admixture. That occurred after slavery as blacks moved into white areas. Mostly due to consensual quiet affairs (e.g. along lines of Strom Thurman). And also widespread prostitution.<br><br>
(And even in those rare cases of relationships between a black slave female and a white, who might not have even been her &#8220;master&#8221; BTW, it does not follow it was always &#8220;rape&#8221;. Such relationships could have been consensual.)<br><br>

					<p><i>We hear the grievances. Where is the gratitude?<i></i></i></p>
<p>This is one of the things that really annoys and puzzles me about Black people generally, they never ever say thank you to the people who have given them liberty, wealth and happiness.  It&rsquo;s the absence of courteousness that&rsquo;s so striking.<br>
  I&rsquo;m wondering, are Blacks afraid to say thank you because that would entail acknowledging that we, rather than their own enterprise or other Black nations, are responsible for their gifts?<br><br>
  Saying thank you is more than a polite word. It says &lsquo;I accept that you have done something good for me and that makes you good in my eyes&rsquo;. I think there is a reluctance to permit America and Whites generally to be perceived as having virtue. After all might it mean that Colonialism, Capitalism, the Westward Expansion and so forth have some virtue too?  That would mean that decades of disparaging White endeavours might be questionable, White activities and actions might not be as destructive as it has been portrayed by the anti-White/Western Leftist mob and worse still, Blacks might lose their enablers on the Left. <br><br>
Saying thank you has a lot of baggage attached; just as long as White people are seen as oppressive, selfish, disabling and so forth,  Blacks can complain and demand more benefits, thanking us might end the philanthropic fountain.<br><br>

<p>We should give them a second chance  &mdash;  enslave them and free them again.</p>

					<p>How long before you Yanks realise that Obama is not an Afro-American in the true sense of the word. He is not the descendant of a slave. His white American Mother maried a black Kenyan (Muslim, by the way.) Obama is therefore 50% &#8220;modern&#8221; African.</p>
<p>Now you simply have to look at what is happening to so-called democracy in Kenya and you realise that this is how Africans see democracy.</p>
<p>Then you look at what is happening in South Africa where the black African majority is actively following a policy of white &#8220;genocide&#8221; but mainly Afrikaner-genocide through crime, affirmative action, black economic empowerment (read: stealing control of white companies) and redistriution of land (read: stealing white-owned land) and you should know that if this half-African makes it to the White House his African heritage, culture and eventually his Muslim education will prevail. Good luck - you&rsquo;ll need it!</p>

					<p>&#8220;Again, Buchanan was conceptually wrong. I may have been just a bit off on a minor detail.&#8221;</p>
<p>Posted by <span class="caps">OCCAM </span>at 9:23 PM on March 24</p>
<p>Declaring Pat Buchanan &#8220;conceptually wrong,&#8221; coming from someone who is wrong on almost every single thing he writes on this forum is indeed laughable. </p>
<p>And your &#8220;bit off&#8221; always amounts to major errors, but mostly they&rsquo;re indications of an inability to really understand the issue involved, then make an erroneous conclusion, based on an inability to logic.</p>

					<p>&#8220;I could go on about the book but the point is that whites must be much more proactive than they have been and activate against this hate propaganda directed at our kids. White people got into this mess by partly by passively tolerating all the distortions and lies about our history.&#8221;</p>
<p>  I agree completely.  I work at a so-called institution of higher education. It comes close to being a &#8220;re-education&#8221; camp in the social sciences. I always advice white students to stay in the sciences and business and avoid the propagandized neo-Marxist social sciences. <br>
