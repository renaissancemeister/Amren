						<p>Immigrants from all corners of the world have moved into D.C.&rsquo;s suburbs so quickly during the past two decades that one in five regional residents is now foreign-born, according to a book being released by the Brookings Institution today.</p>
<p>The Washington metropolitan area is one of four &#8220;emerging gateways&#8221; chronicled in &#8220;Twenty-First Century Gateways,&#8221; which delves into the explosion of immigrants in suburban &mdash; rather than urban &mdash; communities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>What sets the Washington area apart is the sheer amount of change, the speed at which it has happened, the extraordinary diversity of cultures represented as well as the wide dispersement of cities in the region with staggeringly high immigrant populations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 1980, there was no place in the Washington region where immigrants made up 30 percent of more of the population. By 2000, there were roughly two dozen jurisdictions that fit that description, with some having close to 40 percent of their population being non-natives.</p>
<p>Altogether the region boasts more than 1 million immigrant settlers at the moment, quadruple the amount in 1980. These newcomers&rsquo; home countries range from El Salvador to Korea to Pakistan, the book states.</p>
<p>Two locales, in particular &mdash; Montgomery and Fairfax counties &mdash; have led the demographic shift. The two counties have more than half of the region&rsquo;s population and about that percentage of its immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Immigrants, particularly those of Hispanic or Asian descent, by and large avoid moving into areas dominated by black residents, Price said, which may explain why areas of Prince George&rsquo;s County and the District have experienced less dramatic immigrant growth. What&rsquo;s unclear is whether the avoidance is of the black population itself or the conditions of the areas in which they often reside such as lower quality schools.</p>

<p>Why is it unclear, after 40 years? Have the race riots of the 1960&rsquo;s taught these &#8220;researchers&#8221; nothing? Why are they still clueless, when immigrants fresh off the boat, have got things figured out, as to why they choose not to live among Bantus?</p>

			<p>My wife (European) and I were at a store in Tyson&rsquo;s Corner, VA not too long ago.  She looked around at the 20-30 people shopping, turned to me and said, &#8220;You are the only American in here!&#8221;.  </p>
<p>She was right, of course, except for the possibility of our government giving one or more of them a piece of paper stating they are now indistinguishable with an American whose family has been here for over 300 years.</p>
<p>Northern VA was a paradise in the &#8216;70&rsquo;s when I grew up.  It is almost unrecognizable now.</p>
<p>What our politicians and activists have given away, our descendants will never know - including those of you under 30.<br>

<p>Could it be that immigrants don&rsquo;t like being robbed, beaten, or raped any more than anyone else?  No&hellip; it must be the lack of  good soccer teams at their kids&rsquo; schools.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have just been able to see the pattern,&rdquo; she said.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wrote this reporter and gave him a few examples of black on everybody fighting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s absolutely amazing that there are such naive, out-of-touch types in the country today.</p>

<p>Wow, what a sentence! This is so typically pc and most right-thinking folks will see through it immediately. In my experience a large black population goes hand in hand with bad schools. &#8216;A&rsquo; leads to &#8216;B&rsquo;.<br>
But Dena Levitz would have you think that lower quality schools &#8216;just happen&rsquo;, irrespective of who lives there. Wrong. In the real world that&rsquo;s not how it is.<br>
Moreover, Levitz could have also mentioned the high crime rates of black neighborhoods as well. These new immigrants aren&rsquo;t stupid. They don&rsquo;t come to America to &#8216;celebrate diversity&rsquo;. </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m 40 years old and have lived in Northern Virginia all my life.Years ago,when I was a kid I would constantly hear people say Fairfax County is one of the richest counties in America,yet there were very few immigrants around.At my elementary school I remmember one Chinese boy and only one or two blacks.Now its like a foreign county.If you were to ask some idiot politician,they would say immigration made the county rich.If you want to see something truly sickening,look up the website for Cameron Elementary in Fairfax County where my former principal is now.How someone could go from an all white school to that is inexplicable.</p>

			<p>The problem may be that this reporter actually has race realist sense, as most rational Americans do. But let me tell you first hand, as someone who worked in journalism, when you write an article like this, you MUST write it in this idiot manner. Any trace of race realism will have you called to the carpet as racist and you will probably lose your job.</p>
<p>Further, simply being called racist is very painful to many liberal Americans. And reporters are 88% liberal. The fear of being called racist is so deep that they will twist themselves into all sorts of contortions, even knowingly writing nonsense like this, in order to avoid the accusations.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that 85% of Hispanic immigrants who have come here since 1990 are ILLEGALS. This is something that these neverending lying articles never tell you. &#8220;Hispanic immigrant&#8221; for all intents and purposes just means &#8220;illegal alien&#8221;. That&rsquo;s all there is to it. But darned if one article in 1000 will ever tell you such a thing.</p>

			<p>  The D.C./Northern Virginia area is one of the most crime-ridden and expensive areas of the country. Certainly, the flood of illegal and legal immigrants have turned a once beautiful and charming area to an urban, gang-infested nightmare. </p>

<p>The luckiest Black teachers in the Chicago public school system are undoubtedly those that work in Chinatown&rsquo;s elementary school!</p>

			<p>The REAL truth is that Black areas in ANY large city are avoided   &mdash;   not only by locals but by immigrants as well!!! Now just WHY would predominantly Black urban areas be viewed as hellholes of crime and psychotic violence, one might well ask.</p>
<p>As to the comment on lower quality of Black schools   &mdash;   how much rocket science intelligence does it take to realize that Black schools generate Black failures and Black drop-outs? Or to link the Black drop-out rate, the reality virtually ALL urban Blacks have at best, little more than a grammar school education   &mdash;   with their unemployability and their propensity for a life of crime? Funny, but I am not aware Barak Obama, their new Mesiah, ever urged Blacks to take an active role in seeing their offspring actually LEARN in school. That Ivy-league educated Obama never bothered to &#8220;enlighten&#8221; pastor Jeremiah White as to WHY so many Blacks are in prison. (That it was NOT White racism to blame for their incarceration but their crime.)</p>
<p>Has anyone heard Obama make a real comment on those millions of unemployable or underemployed Blacks   &mdash;   who spurned education in their youth. Those Blacks today finding themselves competing with illegal immigrants for manual labor work. Guess going into your typical racist hyperbole about White Privilege and White Racism is far easier than looking into the mirror of reality and facing the unpleasant TRUTH!</p>
<p>What totally cracks me up is the incredible irony   &mdash;   BLACKS supportiong Obama, when Obama favors continued illegal immigration along with legalizing the criminal illegal alients! Because THOSE ILLEGAL ALIENS are pushing the Blacks out of the job market at every level! Yet I&rsquo;d guestimate that not one Black in a hundred is sharp enough to understand their Mesiah is and has actively worked against THEIR interests in this respect!</p>

			<p>I know from experience that the &#8220;immigrants&#8221; are not necessarily avoiding Black areas, but are congregated amongst people of their own race. China town, Korea Town, etc&hellip;</p>
