Authorities have charged two suspects with first-degree murder in the death of the student body president of the University of North Carolina.</p>
<p>Court documents filed Wednesday name the first defendant as 21-year-old Demario James Atwater, of Durham.</p>
<p>The second suspect, 17-year-old Lawrence Alvin Lovett Jr., is believed to be involved in a standoff with police in Durham, N.C. He is also charged with first-degree murder in the death of Eve Carson.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Chapel Hill Police Chief Brian Curran declined to say which of the suspects shot and killed Carson, a 22-year-old from Athens, Ga., found last Wednesday lying on a street about a mile from campus.</p>

															<h2>Police Charge Suspect With First-Degree Murder in UNC Student Killing, Search for Another</h2>
											<p>
							<i>AP, March 12, 2008</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>Authorities charged two suspects Wednesday with first-degree murder in the slaying of University of North Carolina student body president Eve Carson.</p>
<p>Demario James Atwater, 21, of Durham, was ordered held without bond at an initial court appearance. Police said they are still searching for the second suspect, 17-year-old Lawrence Alvin Lovett Jr.</p>
<p>Chapel Hill Police Chief Brian Curran declined to say whether Lovett was the subject of an intense police standoff Wednesday afternoon in nearby Durham. City Councilman Eugene Brown said it appears the standoff was resolved without an arrest.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Shackled at the ankles and waist and with a public defender at his side, Atwater only whispered &#8220;yes&#8221; on Wednesday when asked at his initial appearance if he understood the charged against him. His next court date was set for March 24.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police believe Lovette was pictured in two photos taken at an ATM machine, driving Carson&rsquo;s Toyota Highlander while Atwater is in the back seat. Police also believe Atwater was suspect shown trying to use Carson&rsquo;s ATM card inside a convenience store.</p>
<p>Curran has previously declined to say when the surveillance photos were taken or the exact location of the ATM machine and convenience store, or if any money was successfully withdrawn from Carson&rsquo;s account.</p>

			<p>Well, well. We had the black community of Durham trying to lynch innocent white lacrosse players. National black &#8216;civil rights&rsquo; leaders stoked the fires of black hatred of whites and assumption that all whites are racist and guilty permanently of whatever the black mind can imagine.</p>
<p>Now we see the reality of the relationship between Durham&rsquo;s blacks and whites unfortunate enough to be near them.</p>
<p>Does anybody think Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson will hold a rally denouncing black violence against white women? </p>

			<p>Whites, especially women should be acutely aware that there are many black predatory thugs out there without a concience who are all too willing to kill or maim them for whatever valuables they may have,or for sexual gratification. We should always have a plan or plans to deal with this occourance if or when it happens.And if this plan includes violent action, then it is morally and legally justified.Too many of us are too compassionate to those who are willing to cause irreversible harm to us.The law will not prosecute those who defend themselves if they are faced with harm.</p>

			<p>I saw this earlier today. Beautiful girl killed by these untermenschen&hellip;. I knew the &#8216;suspects&rsquo; would be repeat offender blacks. Another sacrifice on the altar of diversity. </p>
<p>  And people wonder why some white folks preferred to live apart from blacks. </p>

			<p>These two &#8216;gangsta thugs&rsquo; took this beautiful young woman&rsquo;s life and devastated her parents and family&hellip;over a few bucks probably spent on drugs, booze and video games.</p>
<p>In their early teens, my daughters were all trained to use concealed firearms. Each has their own pistol now and carry them on their person in a purse holster.</p>

Well, these pieces of solid excreted body waste matter are armed with their public &#8220;defenders&#8221;.  It looks like they are preparing to make fools of our corrupt political-legal system, &#8220;as usual&#8221;.</p>
<p>Its little wonder these horrific acts perpetrated against White people have become so commonplace.</p>

			<p>Wassup with the NAMES of violent underclass predators, i.e. &#8220;Demario&#8221; Atwater? It seems like every feral, low-IQ urban monster that strikes down one of our race has such an evil moniker. Remember &#8220;Letavious&#8221; Cobbins and &#8220;Lemaricus&#8221; Davidson whose trials will start in JANUARY 2009 at the earliest. Names like these should warn the sensible of danger just like the dry buzz of a rattlesnake.</p>
<p>And Mr. Bush expresses outrage at folks hanging nooses.</p>

			<p>I was actually against the death penalty.</p>
<p>That has changed.  Being against the death penalty is like being against trash disposal. If you do not dispose of it, it multiplies. If you try to be humane to it, it does not care.<br>
 <br>
I look forward to the death penalty, by hanging if possible, for both these pieces of trash. Yes, let them have whatever spiritual counsel they desire, let them repent, but &hellip; hang them.</p>
<p>The dead eyes of the one, the steely soul-dead gaze of the other, contrasted to the classic, vulnerable beauty of the young girl who had everything to look forward to  &mdash;  it is anguish.</p>
<p>It makes me angry that these miscreants should be able to deliver this girl into death, and her family into an unutterable pain that only death will fully relieve. What kind of madness is it when the best are delivered into the hands of the worst, and then told to count it as a blessing of diversity?</p>
<p>The Noose &hellip; why, yes, of course. For the criminals and the traitors that unleashed hell upon us. </p>

			<p>Orange County DA Jim Woodall has got his work cut out for him to say the least. We have a Judicial District and Prosecutorial District of Orange and Chatham counties combined. The demograhics and political orientation of this district present some serious problems when talking about putting the death penalty on the table. For all intents and purposes the only people in this district who could be reliable jurors and convict these two in a capital trial would be the white folk who live in Orange County north of the 1-85/40 corridor. I can&rsquo;t even remember when the last capital trial was conducted in this Judicial District, let alone whether or not an execution ever resulted from same. Forget the people in Chapel Hill and Carrboro. They&rsquo;re all water heads, carpetbaggers, ACLUers, and assorted other Kool Aid stoner riff-raff, but they have the numbers. They were little Eve&rsquo;s teachers too. Chatham County; a mixed bag of Mother Earthers and Mother Jonesers, gated communities and exclusive &#8220;rural&#8221; clubs where people like John Edwards and Erskine Bowles like to golf, dine, and drink martinis and single malt scotch as they work on agenda planning for the next CFR meeting, Quakers, chicken farmers, and immigrant rights activists taking care of the Mexicans in the Siler City chicken packing plants. And for a finishing touch, most of the judges in this district are old Chapel Hill hippies who went to law school in the early seventies.  How do you say &#8220;change of venue&#8221; in Ebonics?</p>

			<p>What&rsquo;s the big deal? Just another rightless white woman killed by the preferred race. Not like she&rsquo;s actually human or something. </p>
<p>Surely it is on par with littering. Blacks shouldn&rsquo;t rob/rape/murder whites but no big deal if they do.</p>

			<p>&#8220;We could certainly use a few men like Nathan Bedford Forrest in this modern crazy world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yup. The South was right, in many ways. Forrest, JEB Stuart, John Mosby, Stonewall Jackson, Braxton Bragg, and of course, the magnificent and patrician R.E. Lee would be welcomed with open arms. The only problem is, they would be APPALLED at modern America, and they would condemn White people for allowing it to devolve to such a horrific degree.  </p>
<p>The north fought against other WHite men and in the process sowed the seeds of America&rsquo;s eventual destruction. Why oh why couldn&rsquo;t they have pondered the entire political, social, and cultural question of blacks on our shores? The resentment that I harbor toward the north is, to this day, justified and legitimate.</p>
<p>As to Jefferson&rsquo;s &#8220;All men are created equal&#8221;, he was of course referring to White men. </p>

			<p>A few observations. Last week, when this story was in the news, it was probably thought that an upper middle class white boyfriend was the killer. Unfortunately for the MSM, it did not turn out that way. Regarding the death penalty, most big-city prosecutorial agencies don&rsquo;t bother in a case like this. Too many headaches politically. </p>
<p>You wonder when young white womwn will learn that it is VERY dangerous for them to go out alone, especially after dark. To say nothing of after midnight. I have read that college girls are actually encouraged to go out and about at unusual hours. This way they are supposed to see the &#8220;community.&#8221;</p>

			<p>I have a sad comment to make. Friends I have in LE are saying that she was tortured (possibly for her ATM number), or just for fun. That&rsquo;s why the multiple gunshot wounds. The shot to the head was the finisher after whatever information needed was obtained.</p>

			<p>Concerning Jefferson&rsquo;s comment on equality, which has been mentioned a few times here,.. I believe the next sentance from the same paper by Jefferson was that it is equally true that the two races cannot co-habit the same nation&hellip; as their will be social rifts as long as such an effort is maintained. Jefferson simply believed that all races have equal right to pursue their own destiny without interference from any other race. In any event the tender refined beauty of the victim only adds to the horridness of this cold blooded event, with the possibility of torture on top of this for an atm # by these very base model humanoids. The philosophy preached by academia of the white race being responsible for all black woes here in Africa and everywhere else they exist has no small part in the continual predation on whites, quasi- justified as recompence for the past. I do wonder if anything whites have ever done has been benificial to blacks, and if this is ever taught by proffesors?</p>

			<p>Two back-to-back vicious cold-blooded gratuitous street murders of beautiful young white coeds at universities in the South by 3 black killers, and so what do you see in today&rsquo;s headlines: &#8220;Students Rally Against Racism and Hate&#8221; at Amherst University. And you see photos of all these white students with signs &#8220;Stop the Hate&#8221;. Are they rallying in protest against these most recent of an endless weekly stream of black on white atrocities on campuses across the country? Against these latest black on white campus killings? Not on your life: No, they are protesting the attempted murder charges brought against a black student who stabbed two whites. They &#8220;allege&#8221; that the black student was just acting in self-defense. Of course these student protesters know more than law-enforcement and the prosecutors. Because they have the black defendant, his family, his lawyer, and the Afro-Studies professors to tell them what happened. And we know that is all reliable. And of course you don&rsquo;t hear a word from the other side. Don&rsquo;t need to know that to jump to conclusions. <br>
Now, when there was a REAL case of racial prosecutorial railroading, the attempted lynching of those innocent white boys at Duke University in Durham, there was large student/faculty rallies too: But these rallies demanded the immediate LYNCHING of those innocent white boys, SCREAMING their automatic GUILT, with no other facts than that they were white and their accuser black. <br>
See how the game is played?<br>
And even more outrageous regarding the selective Amherst U rally by mostly white air-head students in support of the accused black student, is that they cite as an example of the &#8220;racial injustice&#8221; in prosecutions, not the REAL racial injustice against the innocent white boys falsely accused and railroaded in the Durham hoax, but rather once again the JENA MYTH is cited as an example of &#8220;racial injustice&#8221; against BLACKS! Long after the TRUTH about Jena was exposed, this MYTH carries on a life all its own: A case that was in REALITY yet ANOTHER vicious black on white racially motivated hate crime, in which a single innocent white student who did nothing, just minding his own business while walking to class, was ambushed by SIX BLACK THUGS from behind, hit in the back of the head, knocked to the ground, and as he lay unconscious on the ground was kicked and stomped in the head until blood came pouring out of his mouth and ears. If this was not attempted murder what is? But the big INVERTED LIE continues, that this was somehow a case of racial injustice against BLACKS!!!  (Because they were charged for what they DID: Attempted murder.)<br>
In the meantime the black on white carnage continues. No protests against that though.</p>
<p>Think of a small town with 2000 people. Think of each year a town like that being wiped out, with EVERYONE, men, women, and children, all viciously murdered. This is the number of whites murdered by blacks EACH YEAR on average in the U.S. Mostly stranger on stranger, typically gratuitous, and frequently accompanied by rape and sadistic torture.</p>
<p>Think of a city with 60,000 people. Then think of every female in a city that size being viciously raped EACH YEAR. This is the number of white females raped by black males EACH YEAR on average in the U.S. (The reverse nearly non-existent.)</p>
<p>Think of a metropolis of over ONE MILLION people. Then think of EVERY person in that vast metropolis being a victim of violence at the hands of some thug, EACH YEAR. This is the number of whites who are victims of violence at the hands of blacks EACH YEAR in the U.S. (Twelve times the reverse.)</p>
<p>Think of all this every time you hear the unending drumbeat about how terrible WHITES supposedly are to BLACKS in this country, all based on smoke and mirrors!!!  </p>
<p>Side Notes: When you look at the FBI stats on homicide, remember that it just lists SOLVED cases in table with racial breakdown. The black on white fraction of solved cases must be extrapolated to all homicides. White on black homicides are but a fraction of the reverse, and, unlike black on white homicides, are typically justifiable homicides, not murder, done in self defense, particularly law-enforcement. <br>
For other crime statistics refer to the Department of Justice annual &#8220;Victimization Surveys&#8221;. <br>
In both cases, the racial matrix for homicides stats and for violent crime stats, take the average over the past several decades.<br>

So light a candle and turn the other cheek. Soft, easy targets is what the white population has become. Enjoying diversity yet?</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m allowed to post to this site since I am black (seems to be a lot of anti-black sentiment here). In any case, I am a 36 year old female currently enrolled in a class on Race and Crime at the University of Houston. The class has taught me much that I didn&rsquo;t know about black crime and all I can say is that if you guys are filled with animosity and loathing for the black criminal, just know that you aren&rsquo;t alone. It made me physically ill to see on the news that the perpetrators in both crimes were black males.</p>
<p>In my class, we&rsquo;ve been covering several theories: economic depravity, social disorganization, subculture of violence, etc. But none seem to accurately describe why our young black men are not only killing each other, but many others as well. </p>
<p>With the news of the two murders, and indeed many other incidents, I can definitely understand why white people would fear and despise the black criminal. If I weren&rsquo;t a woman of faith, I would feel the same way, especially since, statistically, I am an even greater target for violent crime by a black male than any white person (most violent crime is intra-racial as opposed to inter-racial).</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s what I would leave you guys with. The image that you have of the black criminal does not pervade the entire race. Many of us are law-abiding, hard-working citizens just like yourselves. We too recognize that many of our young black men are on a path to destruction and, like you, we are severely perplexed and have no idea what to do about it.</p>
<p>I do not speak for all black people and I offer no apologies for those two guys that killed the college students. While its painful to read the posts on this site and get the full extent of how much white people hate black people, at least in this one case, I think black and white can agree. Those guys should get whatever punishment is coming to them.</p>

<p>Howard:</p>
<p>I would also add this: our White girls are taught very little to nothing about vicious black predators who specifically hunt them for sexual pleasure, torture and murder. </p>
<p>White girls must be explicitly educated to avoid at all costs, without exception, black males, lest they too end up as a crime statistic (with little notice by the MSM). </p>
<p>Unfortunately, none of this black racial hatred and violence towards Whites is taught in the government schools (in fact it is quite the opposite; that Whites are inherently violent and commit the vast majority of hate crimes) leaving young Whites vulnerable and naive.</p>
<p>So it is up to US to educate our children as to the prevalence of black-on-White crime and to give them the tools to protect and defend themselves.</p>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t who will?  Certainly not the MSM, the churches or the government schools.</p>
<p>No one should be helpless, especially White women  &mdash;  how on earth could they possibly protect themselves unless they&rsquo;re armed?</p>
<p>The only thing that stops an assault is a gun  &mdash;  don&rsquo;t leave home without it.</p>

			<p>A few thoughts;</p>
<p>1) Note the souless, lifeless eyes so many of these black killers have. They remind me of the eyes of a man-eating shark.</p>
<p>2) White females should be EXTREMELY WARY around black males. Forget what Hollywood and MTV would have you believe girls, these guys mean you harm. Serious thought should be given to acquiring a firearm for self-defense.</p>

<p>What does anyone think about the possibility of organizing something around this?</p>
<p>Of course, they will accuse us of exploiting it; which really means we&rsquo;re getting to them, and that&rsquo;s very good indeed.  Still, for now, they get a pass for REALLY exploiting a FALSE situation, like in Jena.  Whereas in Knoxville WE are called opportunists.  </p>
<p>But the more this stuff happens the more meaner and dumber they get. I mean, did anyone see those counter-demonstrators in Knoxville?  F-ing Flakes!</p>
<p>By contrast we&rsquo;re well-spoken, more respectful generally, and have reason, right, and purpose on our side.  Lets use it.</p>

			<p>These black on white killings evey day. This is one of the few that actually has gotten some media attention (only because they were so similar and occurred withing 24 hours of each other in the same geographical area of the country). But the vast majority of these black on white racial atrocities you never hear about. <br>

<p>What you see and read on this site is not born of &#8220;hate&#8221; but primarily absolute frustration with a social order that promotes lie over truth, sensitivity over sensibility, tolerance over reality! I think you would find that very few, if any here, genuinely &#8220;hate&#8221; anyone based only upon race, ethnicity, etc. That does not mean, however, that they(we) don&rsquo;t recognize that racial groups are, by and large, possessed of different innate genetic characteristics, and subsequently behave in different fashions, learn at different levels, place paramount importance upon different things, etc. Crime and violence is but one aspect. </p>
<p>I have known a number of Black people in my life who were/are very fine, decent and respectable people, and I would argue strongly with anyone who said otherwise. I also happen to live in a state and close to a city filled with Black people who are anything but honorable, decent and law-abiding. A frightening majority of &#8220;African Americans&#8221; fall far closer to the latter than the former groups noted. <br>
This is the unpleasant reality of the situation for most here. Most us here have arrived at our positions on race through extensive life experience(empirical evidince if you will), legitimate research, and a willingness to accept that what we see, hear and witness on a day to day basis in the &#8220;real world&#8221; does in no way correspond with the egalitarian fantasies perpetuated by certain socio-political, media and entertainment, or religious forces/outlets for decades! </p>
<p>&#8220;Hate&#8221; is far too easy and emotional an explanation, and is the language of those who would silence our soberly thought-out dissent. If anyone hates anyone in this country, it seems painfully clear that it is White America that is in the proverbial crosshairs - not Blacks or anyone else for that matter. Such is the reality of 2008. </p>

			<p> A few years back we had a young attractive divorcee in our office who was planning on going to nearby, large, black controlled towns alone to search for a new car . I had alarm bells going off in my head that she was setting herself up to be victimized in the most terrible manner and voiced my concerned . I got accused of sexual harrassment . Learned my lesson .

I know that not all blacks are criminals, but it seems to me that so many blacks tacitly support the ones that are criminals.  I saw it when they cheered the released of OJ against the evidence.  I see it when black jurors refuse to convict black defendants in cases involving white victims, even in hideous crimes with overwhelming evidence. See, for example, the case of Orange Amir Taylor III. <a href="https://tinyurl.com/2lmp7a" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/2lmp7a</a><br>
I also see it in the way that blacks enable the pathological behavior of black criminals.  By this I mean the continual excuse-making, the nurturing of racial grievance and victimhood, and the propagation of the sense of entitlement.  All of this contributes to the formation of the criminal mind.  </p>
<p>&gt;Those guys should get whatever punishment is coming to them.</p>
<p>I share the sentiment. </p>

<p> If you want to instill fear in others; leave as much evidence as possible. This tells us that they are proud of what they&rsquo;ve done and will not hesitate to do it again.<br>
 They probably understand that they will get sympathy, respect, support,understanding and probably a few blacks on the jury that will not convict them under any circumstances.<br>
 They will enjoy days of leisure watching television, three meals a day, air conditioned comfort and a medical care to boot. Yet; these two (if they are convicted) will never have to worry about any white retribution. The government will spare no expense in seeing to thier protection and extreme prosecution of any white that should be foolhardy enough to attempt revenge in any form, fashion,way or manner. </p>

			<p>Phil, welcome. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a statistician, and I&rsquo;ll give you a hint towards the answer to your question: blacks are poor in a much greater percentage than whites. But race and even poverty isn&rsquo;t the answer. When you look only at two-parent families, the disparity in poverty rates vanishes. Blacks are poor, and blacks are criminals, in proportion to the numbers that are raised in single-parent families.</p>
<p>Some recent surveys suggest that there are really two different black cultures in America. The culture of middle-class blacks from intact families has more in common with white American culture than it does with the culture of urban ghetto single-parent blacks. </p>
<p>You want to stop black boys from killing each other? Stop black &#8220;baby mamas&#8221; from giving birth to them and raising them without male role models.</p>

			<p>Bravo, Phil! Despite my growing disgust with this sort of black on white crime  &mdash;  and it seems to get worse every year  &mdash;  I have known many fine black people who are every bit as disgusted. Even though some of the people who post here are a little over-the-top, I think most of us just want this kind of thing to stop. I hate the mainstream media and feel they have a huge hand in escalating this kind of behaviour by covering it up or lying about it. On the other hand they moan and cry and carryon about almost non-existent white on black crime, always saying how white supremacy is &#8220;Growing&#8221; (Geraldo Rivera is the King of this)  &mdash;  giving the FALSE idea that any black who strays into all white areas will get attacked or killed. It&rsquo;s a lie spread by Latte-sipping &#8220;progressives&#8221; (they are anything but)and it helps keep racial resent alive and well. No wonder we are having these problems!</p>

			<p>The TV personality Nancy Grace (a lawyer) on CNN, who affects to be a crusader for justice on her show, was all over these co-ed murders&hellip;until the perps were identified. Then she dropped the coverage like a hot &#8216;tater in favor of whatever sensational cases she could scroung up involving whites. If the perp(s) had been white males she would never have let the story go, but would have been on it like white on rice for weeks. The mainstream media, as most posters on this site know, can be relied upon to either not report the truth about the prevailence of black on white crime, or to give it a brief mention, with the caveat that the act was &#8220;random&#8221;. Note however, if the rare case comes up where a white harms some &#8220;person of color&#8221; it is automaticaly not a &#8220;random&#8221; crime but a hate crime.</p>

<p>      My mom, who is seventy-five, recently told me that growing up in the thirties, forties and fifties she had very little fear of being around black men on certain levels. And that most white women felt the same way. (One of her best friends was a black girl that she went to high school with and they remained friends for a number of years after that.) </p>
<p>      She also included in her remark to me the point of how in the last twenty to thirty years, a large numbr of black males seem to be of a different breed-a bad breed.</p>

<p>I am White, and I agree with the above statement.  Yes, a great many African-Americans are good citizens just like the lady says.  The problem is that Africans have, in general, lower IQ, higher impulsiveness, and higher emotional expression than Whites and Asians.  This means that for every high-IQ African, there are 10 dysfunctional, low-IQ Africans.  With Whites, the ratio is closer to 1:1. There are a great many wonderful, smart, law-abiding, and productive Africans.  But, Africans (and African-Americans) as a group cannot achieve, because the few smart Africans must carry the baggage of the large numbers of low-IQ failures.  Whites can overcome their low-IQ members, because there are so many high-IQ whites, but that is not the case with Africans.  Unfortunately, there is nothing that can be done about it, because it is genetic.</p>

<p>Phil,</p>
<p>Most of us, I think, of course realize that most black people are not vicious killers, and that in fact many blacks are decent, good, and upright people.</p>
<p>However there is, among the black population, a large segment - a very large segment - who can only be described as feral predators, and who most definitely have it in for whites.  And seemingly, most black leaders and opinion makers are entirely okay with that.  You may protest that these are not your leaders - that you never chose them, and this may be true.  But obviously, all too many blacks do see them as leaders - that&rsquo;s why they are percieved as such.</p>
<p>Add to that the fact of rampant grievance-mongering by many blacks in the workplace - the kind of situation where a white worker can lose his job over a careless remark, and where whites are presumed guilty at birth.</p>
<p>Life is short and people have to come up with the solutions, however crude or imperfect, that make it possible to get through it.  Many whites have simply concluded that associating with blacks in any way is just far more trouble than it could ever be worth.  You may see that as a problem.  It is, however, YOUR problem.</p>

			<p>*I saw this earlier today. Beautiful girl killed by these untermenschen&hellip;. I knew the &lsquo;suspects&rsquo; would be repeat offender blacks. Another sacrifice on the altar of diversity.* </p>
<p>Same here! When I first heard 2 college coeds were killed on the same day, I instantly suspected they would be black. Such crimes by them are growing more increasingly common everyday, but blacks still try and down-play the reality of the criminality. I just visited another website where they were discussing the crime, and numerous Blacks were either trying to suggest she dated the killer, or called them a racist name, (as though that would justify it). Even worse, there were countless Blacks saying who cares? Whitey held slaves, and whitey had Jim Crow laws. Sicker still, one suggested that the recent incident of nooses being found (err planted) on trees or doorknobs was much worse than young white girls being murdered. The the utter depravity in their logic is astounding sometimes.</p>

			<p>Whites need to organize a demonstration against these black criminals and call this murder a hate crime - there needs to be a REAL white counterweight to the Sharptons and Jacksons that can be counted on to appear and protest when these events occur.  Does such an organization/group yet exist anywhere?   </p>

Just think about it here is a so-called culture whose message is that women (of all races)are ho&rsquo;s, that whitey is evil no matter the age or gender-whose music is narcistic and mind numbing. Yet, this same culture claims to be fighting for justice!  </p>

<p>The problem(s) have now gotten past the point of &#8220;Why are they doing this?&#8221; and now reached the point of teaching our daughters that to be safe they must avoid blacks and black neighborhoods. That is not a hatred of you or your family but a simple attempt to play the odds in favor of our loved ones. </p>
<p>In example, I know that my daughter would be perfectly happy working with reptiles but I would expect a lifetime of such work to eventually being bitten by a snake and risking her health or her life. The odds are just in favor of that eventuality. The same odds held sway when I have &#8220;steered&#8221; her into going to a certain college&hellip; it is a white majority area and school and she has better odds to not be victimized as the young women in these stories have been. I spent my entire adult life in law enforcement and I have no &#8220;hatred&#8221;, but I have a lifetime of knowledge and experience. Much like a few years ago when Jessie Jackson got heat for admitting being afraid of a group of black youth on the street&hellip; it was based on his insight into what could happen   &mdash;   i.e. the odds turn against one when they are exposed to more and larger groups of blacks. Sure white folks can be bad too, but not at the same alarming rate.</p>
<p> We just want people to a) acknowledge the obvious and b) stop calling those who try to do so being labeled as racists and haters. When those two simple things occur we may actually find a &#8220;cure&#8221; that would benefit your people as well as mine.</p>

			<p>My mom, who is seventy-five, recently told me that growing up in the thirties, forties and fifties she had very little fear of being around black men on certain levels. And that most white women felt the same way. (One of her best friends was a black girl that she went to high school with and they remained friends for a number of years after that.) </p>
<p>She also included in her remark to me the point of how in the last twenty to thirty years, a large numbr of black males seem to be of a different breed-a bad breed.</p>
<p>Why is this?</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t answer for Phil, but I can you give you my own perspective. Naturally, a lot of it has to do with the fact that for almost 25 years rap, and black gangsta culture have been served up to youth by the media in abundance, convincing them it is cool to embrace thuggish behavior and dress. Then there is the fact that back in the 30&rsquo;s 40&rsquo;s and 50&rsquo;s, criminal behavior  was never tolerated, and was often harshly punished. Today, they are almost coddled by our politically correct media, who often hide or downplay black on white crime, while jumping on any case that hints of white on black crime, like the Duke rape case. Many news stations failed to even cover the horrible  kidnappings, rape and murder of Channon Christian and Chris Newsom. Had their killers been white they would have been, talking about it around the clock. They would have played up the sensationalism of it all even more had the victims been black. Today, I think many Black youth feel they are deserving of special treatment, and no longer feel any fear of punishment. It makes them all the more bold and brazen in their willingness to take part in criminal behavior.<br>

My observations lead me to believe that black hatred of whites, and also of others is perhaps the strongest hatred out there.Just look at the way so many of you worship the many rabidly racist black so called leaders out there.And the way, as one poster on this headline mentioned,the way so many blacks tacitly condone or rationalize black racist viciousness and violence.</p>

I applaud your comments here.<br>
When you speak of the law abiding blacks like yourself who deplore the violence of your young black men, let us see them speak out publicly! <br>
When blacks will parade just as vociferously to condemn criminal blacks as they do to protect the rights of arrested, believed to unjustly accused blacks, then maybe, just maybe, you will find the problem of young, violent black males might start to be solved.<br>
This is one time I do believe it takes a community to be involved: the black community needs speak out loud against any and all blacks who do murder, rape, armed robbery, and other violent crimes. I don&rsquo;t mean amongst themselves, but loudly, for all the word to hear: just as they did for the so called Jena 6. Let&rsquo;s see blacks march against young black thugs. Let&rsquo;s see blacks start to monitor the behaviour of their young people.</p>

<p>The behavior of blacks is the same whether they are living in Africa or America, because they are the products of their genetics and as such haven&rsquo;t advanced as a race one iota in millenniums.  A sampling of today&rsquo;s BBC Africa reports:</p>
<p>&#8220;Ex-Liberian President Charles Taylor told militias to eat their enemies, a former rebel tells his war crimes trial.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Liberians visiting graveyards on National Decoration Day have been shocked by the desecration of tombs. Many have found the graves empty as caskets and railings have been looted by robbers for resale.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ethiopia&rsquo;s national bank has been told to inspect all the gold in its vaults to determine its authenticity. It follows the discovery that some of the &#8220;gold&#8221; it had bought for millions of dollars was gold-plated steel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m a statistician, and I&rsquo;ll give you a hint towards the answer to your question: blacks are poor in a much greater percentage than whites. But race and even poverty isn&rsquo;t the answer.&#8221;</p>
<p>The poor are always more likely to be arrested for crime, however, as poverty levels dramatically decreased last Century, crime levels for all races skyrocketed and remain high to this day. </p>
<p>On what can we blame this change? I know who can&rsquo;t be blamed: Racists. They were exposed in their underground holes way back. Nor Paleoconservatives: Even conservatives purged them from their ranks decades back. Christians either: They and their philosophy were booted out of school long ago. Still, in today&rsquo;s world everyone always has to take a stand and blame must always be assigned. So&hellip; let&rsquo;s blame those three anyway. </p>

Posted by Rudy]</p>
<p>There is no scientific basis for what I&rsquo;m about to say, but I believe it&rsquo;s because blacks have become feral   &mdash;   like stray cats.</p>
<p>Black men are known to impregnate multiple women and leave them. The offspring of these haphazard pairings will get older and start to breed amongst eachother   &mdash;   not knowing any better because they didn&rsquo;t know their fathers. This black inbreeding is causing mental disorders and more suscepatbility to disease in the black community.</p>

			<p>Phil, <br>
  Thanks for your post, most of us here like to hear from Blacks especially when the issue is Black crime, which sadly is so often is.  I can only speak for myself (and some others who have responded) to say that I do not hate Black people. I have known some over my lifetime and I found them for the most part pleasant, easygoing. Though even those I knew well had noticeably different expectations and attitudes, i.e. many expected Government to provide for them and  others felt completely comfortable blaming me  personally for the exploitation of Africa, slavery, all racial discrimination etc. and for these latter reasons I don&rsquo;t seek out the company of Blacks and keep it to a casual and temporary basis.  <br>
  You say you have no idea how to remedy the dreadful problems caused by Black crime and that at college you&rsquo;ve explored the economic, social etc aspects with no positive results.  The Far Left believed it had the answer with handouts and welfare, approval of drug use &amp; illegitimacy, affirmative action and so forth, and Conservatives pretty much fell in lock-step with the Left&rsquo;s largesse for fear of being called racist, uncaring,  pigs.  We&rsquo;ve had 50 years of these government programmes and permissiveness and the results are ever more devastating.  I&rsquo;m pretty sure you would prefer not to live amongst gang-ridden downtrodden neighbourhoods, and we don&rsquo;t either.  We fear that when one Black family moves into a  White neighbourhood, that more will follow and our once pleasant and safe towns and cities will become places of crime and fear, this is an undeniable truth and the evidence is all around us. We accept that the only answer to this problem is segregation, which would mean not allowing that first Black family into a white neighbourhood.  Sadly, that first family might turn out to be you and yours. I&rsquo;d be interested to know who you  would consider responsible for that unfortunate state of affairs, Whites who want to protect themselves or criminal Blacks? <br>
  As you cast your mind back over the decades of the last century do you see as I do, that White society has tried its very best to help your people; we ended slavery, we set up your own Black country in Africa, we segregated, we de-segregated, applied affirmative action, quotas, we uncritically accepted the massive illegitimacy rates, we gave your people handouts, welfare, housing, treatment centres, medical aid for addictions, we lowered admission grades to schools and universities, we prosecuted Whites for racism, we altered our literature, our books, our films to include Blacks in heroic roles, we ensured Blacks had access to  prominent positions as newsreaders,  in government, in education, law, police, the military,etc. We removed every trace of the segregationist past.  Yes there were/are some bigots who caused localized trouble but White Governmental policy has always been to help Blacks as most people are fair-minded and believed that the next programme would surely work.  So please, tell us what more we can do and we&rsquo;ll give it a try.  You say nothing you&rsquo;ve examined explains why Blacks still behave the way they do?  But have you examined mental skills? IQ, Genetic traits, have you asked would segregation work? Why is Black failure a worldwide phenomenon?,  Colonialism? why then are Africans poor  but Singaporeans  rich?<br>
  We have asked these questions and for the time being at least we see segregation as the only option. We just want to live our lives free of fear.<br>
Please post here anytime you care to.<br>

A 1930s black American knew raping or killing a white woman would have dire consequences for him and his people. Today&rsquo;s white people only care about themselves and making lots of money!!</p>

			<p>To Phil at 12:17 AM on March 13: How very excellent was your post, and also the responses to it. Please tell us more about your course on race and crime  &mdash;  the ensuing discussion will surely provide you with enough material for several term papers on &#8220;White Nationalist views on race and crime&#8221;! </p>
<p>&#8220;I can definitely understand why white people would fear and despise the black criminal&hellip;The image that you have of the black criminal does not pervade the entire race. Many of us are law-abiding, hard-working citizens just like yourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Absolutely. But I see no realistic solution to the problem of black crime perpetrated against whites short of a return to a segregated society. &#8220;Law-abiding, hard-working&#8221; blacks residing in our neighborhoods provide a cover for criminal blacks to wander freely among us. In contrast, in the segregated Southern cities I grew up in, the rare black person present in a white neighborhood was immediately taken note of and regarded with suspicion. Unfortunately for them, but with benefit to our own safety.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many deserving blacks certainly did not have the opportunity under segregation that they now have, but on the other hand, one benefit of the segregated South for blacks themselves was that black neighborhoods were a lot safer for blacks under segregation than they are now. As the greatly under-appreciated Dr. David Duke states, the &#8220;Civil Rights&#8221; movement has, for both whites AND FOR BLACKS, gravely impaired the most fundamental civil right of all, protection of life itself against violent attack.</p>
<p>My own comment on &#8220;Civil Rights&#8221;: when you free the good in people, you also free the bad in them. This has been overlooked by too many whites.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fascinatingly (and frustratingly) complex problem that, as you point out, all of us are caught up in. Whatever shape the struggles and the solutions take, I hope that relations and communications between the races may always be conducted with the greatest amity possible, and I hope you will post more. Best wishes to you!</p>
<p>(P.S. I was momentarily confused by your phrase, &#8220;economic depravity&#8221;  &mdash;  I assume this was a typo for &#8220;economic deprivation&#8221;)</p>

			<p>Well, I am probably pressing my luck by posting again, but I wanted to continue this discourse a bit more.</p>
<p>To the topic of genetics: a lot of people do believe that blacks are genetically inferior, but its not true - not scientifically anyway. The scientific term is &#8220;biological determinism&#8221; and its the idea that genetic factors largely determine intelligence, criminality, etc. Genetic inferiority is a popular idea - especially in this day and time - but it is not an idea supported by scientific fact. Even &#8220;The Bell Curve&#8221;, with its convincing argument that IQ influences everything, completely ignores the fact that IQ is not immutable - it can be improved. But don&rsquo;t take my word on it. Google &#8220;biological determinism&#8221;. There&rsquo;s a wealth of information out there. </p>
<p>Besides, saying &#8220;they can&rsquo;t help it&#8221; absolves the black criminal of all responsibility for his crime. That&rsquo;s REALLY a license to kill, if you ask me. I&rsquo;m of the mind that every one is responsible for his own actions. There really is no excuse for what those guys did - not even a genetic one.</p>
<p>But I do think the posting about the rate of black births to single-parent households is hitting the nail on the head. Off to do some research!</p>
<p>Anyway, I want to thank you all for tolerating me this short time. I will leave you to your business now.</p>
<p>P.S. I probably loathe Al Sharpton more than any of you guys. All he ever does is make a bad situation worse!<br>

			<p>Reading about these white girls being murdered by racist black thugs makes my blood boil&hellip;.and yet like today I had gone to the supermarket, had parked my car and was walking towards the entrance of the store when I noticed a young black guy dressed in his thug attire putting sacks and sacks of groceries in the trunk of this nice car. I was curious to see if he would get in the car on the driver&rsquo;s side or the passenger side of the front seat, and who would be in the car with him. Well, to no surprise, he got in on the passenger side and, yes, a young white girl with long hair was driving. I am sure she was the one who paid for all the groceries. Can somebody tell me why white women do this????? Are there any women on this site that could explain this behavior to me? How many white women have to be murdered before they &#8220;wake up&#8221;.</p>

<p>I am a white woman (forget my signature) and I can&rsquo;t understand it either.  It amazes me just how often I see white girls with bruthas.  I went to the mall today and saw two 30-something white women pushing a stroller with a little black baby in it.  Not Mulatto but black.  If they had given me eye contact they would have gotten a hostile return glance.  They had lousy parents that for sure.<br>

<p>Thanks for your posts.  I&rsquo;m an evolutionary biologist, and I&rsquo;m sorry to tell you that there is very, very strong data showing that there are profound genetic differences in IQ among the races.  That&rsquo;s not to say that one can&rsquo;t learn or remain ignorant (i.e., environment can influence knowledge).  But, the capacity for higher level thought is at least 50% or more genetic.  In the same way, certain athletic abilities are 20 to 50% genetic.  For example, an Asian who practices basket ball 8 hrs a day will probably make his high school BB team.  But he is very unlikely to make it onto a college or professional team   &mdash;   he just doesn&rsquo;t have the genes.  An occasional exception to the rule does not disprove this generality.</p>

<p>No race is genetically inferior or genetically superior.  Instead, each race evolved with their own genetic strengths and weakness.  For example, the East Africans are the world&rsquo;s greatest long distance runners.  The West Africans are the best sprinters and jumpers.  The Terra del Fueguens had the greatest cold hardiness of all races   &mdash;   they lived at sub-zero temperatures with no clothes. Unfortunately, they had no genetic or immune defense against Old World diseases, and were exterminated.  The Aborigines have the best sense of smell   &mdash;   they can smell the ground and tell what kind of animal passed.  Equatorial races generally have suburb UV-blocking ability in their skin. Europeans are better able to make vitamin-D from sunlight, and process lactose from milk.  The Papua New Guineans possess at least 15 different genetic defenses against malaria.  Unfortunately, East Asians and Jews have the highest IQ, whereas  Aborigines and Pygmies have the lowest.  Bantu blacks are in the middle.  The problem is that none of these traits matter anymore because we can solve any deficiencies with science.  Only one trait still matters, and that&rsquo;s IQ.  We cannot change IQ, and low-IQ races simply cannot maintain a high technological society.  Again, there are a great many African individuals who are very smart and do quite well   &mdash;   the problem is that there too many who are not smart, and this high percentage ruins it for the smart Blacks.   </p>

			<p>Some posters have stated, or asked, in so many words, why we seem to have a soft spot for criminals and relative indifference to the victims, especially with Black on White crime.  This, and the fact that all of us are aware about the phenomenon of &#8220;Bonding with the Abuser&#8221;, sent me in search of a relevant comment on this issue from the past.</p>
<p>Briefly, as a student of Cultural History, my position is that, just about everything happening now happened, at least in germ form, in the 19th Century. </p>
<p>Anyway, long story short, it didn&rsquo;t take me long.  And I found this from the German Philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a point in the History of Society when it becomes so pathologically soft and tender that, among other things, it sides even with those who harm it, Criminals, and does this quite seriously and honestly&hellip;.Punishing seems unfair.  &#8220;Why punish?  Punishing is terrible.&#8221;  With this question Herd Morality, the Morality of Timidity, draws its final consequence.<br>
Whoever examines the conscience of Europe will find this imperative of Herd timidity everywhere.  &#8220;We want that one day there is nothing more to be afraid of.&#8221;  This is now called &#8220;progress&#8221;&#8220;.</p>
<p>The above quote was written in 1886!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>The ONLY bright spot I see in all of this is that we become aware of the disease we are obviously suffering from.  &#8220;If ya name it ya claim it&#8221; as the slogan goes.  And, &#8220;the only way out it through.&#8221;  <br>
We are in the position we&rsquo;re in today because of Sentimentality.  Wanting to hear the tune without paying the piper.  We want something, like &#8220;progress&#8221; (both Left and Right) but we don&rsquo;t want to suffer for it.  Or even be inconvenienced.  </p>
<p>But the suffering comes anyway.  And believe me, the suffering and inconvenience is going to come for us all very soon.  Probably this year, like, say, maybe November.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I recommend the video series STREET SAFE and any other videos from Paul Vunak, a martial artist who has trained Navy Seals. Basic, easy to learn self defense moves are taught. I also carry a nice Spyderco pocket knife with me at. Whites need to become a little rougher around the edges, and in the middle too.</p>

<p>Another excellent video (in information content, not production quality; it looks like it was shot in his garage)is <i>Street Lethal</i> by Dr. John Latourette. He shows how everyday items can be used for self defense, such as: a rolled up copy of a thick magazine (short club, strike with the end in a jabbing motion), a soda can, a metal pen, etc. And your <i>intent</i> is not to go armed, but to use the object for its intended purpose (read on the bus, cold drink on a hot day, sign documents, and so  on). Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s still available.</p>

<p>Phil said:<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;But I do think the posting about the rate of black births to single-parent households is hitting the nail on the head. Off to do some research!</p>
<p>Phil. I can recommend this site&rsquo;s archives for research on Black Illegitimacy, but the topic has been widely examined elsewhere too. I might point out that the people who condoned illegitimacy did a great disservice to the White race too. Apart from very few exceptional circumstances, I believe that no child of any race benefits from having only one parent. Why would they? Is it natural? Breaking up the Nuclear Family has always been a priority issue with those who hate American accomplishments; what better way to bring poverty and hopelessness to society by disguising hoped for devastation as &lsquo;freedom&rsquo; and &lsquo;tolerance&rsquo;. Promotion of homosexual groupings, single parenthood etc has intruded into the building block of Western Civilisation.  Try &#8220;Abandoning the Nuclear Family&#8221; by Katherine Lang at the Williams Institute UCLA  as a teensy taster of the kind of attitudes being inculcated into young people today. There&rsquo;s a mass of stuff out there. <br>
Your opinions don&rsquo;t seem to be at variance with ours in many areas, more people like you are what Black society needs.<br>

			<p>Whites don&rsquo;t hate black people, Phil.  We hate being assaulted, robbed, murdered and raped.  We hate the excuses ostensibly &#8220;good&#8221; blacks make for the violent criminals among them.  We hate the way they refuse to convict when they sit on juries during the trials of these murderous goons.  We hate being forced to subsidize the fecundity, sloth and degeneracy of a group for whom nothing will ever be enough.</p>
<p>My wife and I saved up because we decided we wanted children.  That meant waiting to buy a DVD player until they were down to $37 at Wal Mart.  It meant joining Costco in order to buy groceries at the lowest price.  It meant my driving my old 1995 Saturn, and building her a car using the engine out of my old Mazda RX-7.  It meant her sewing me a new winter coat (a really nice reversed-fleece sheepskin &#8220;Scottish gamekeeper&rsquo;s coat, I admit.)  It means her sewing her own good clothes for work because women&rsquo;s clothes in petit sizes are expensive, and it means her buying casual clothes at girls&rsquo; &#8220;back to school&#8221; sales.  It meant ordering books used from Amazon dot com (as a birthday present, she ordered me the complete &#8220;Species&#8221; series used, for a total of about $20.)  It meant going out to eat only three times a year - on our birthdays and on our anniversary.  It meant my building furniture for us from unassembled kits from &#8220;Unfinished Furniture.&#8221;  It means my newest pair of running shoes are four years old, and my boots, resoled last year, are nearly old enough to vote.  It means our home computers are PCs I cobbled together from secondhand parts. In the meantime while we have scrimped and saved, we have paid taxes to support welfare, food stamps, WIC, subsidized housing and the like for black mothers who *never even considered* waiting and saving money before having children.  Exactly what about this situation are we supposed to like?</p>

			<p>Phil,</p>
<p>As a retired doctor who knows something about genetics I have to comment that their is an awful lot that is not yet known about the effects of genetics or exactly what certain combinations do and don&rsquo;t do.  Cancer research for example would be greatly enhanced if all that were a given and years of research elininated.</p>
<p>What we can do is note overwhelming trends that seem to cross all cultures, geographic locations, religions, languages and forms of government.  When general trends trump all the variables, DNA makeup becomes the focus - even if we are years away from undeniable proof.  But even if we found that proof tommorrow, it would be politically impossible to report it.  Just look at the fate of a Nobel Prize winner who said what many objective geneticists already suspect.  He was just old and crusty enough to say it.</p>
<p>I no longer try to socialize with blacks.  Professionally, I found all the stereotypes to be true; the men were always on the make, regardless of marital status and the women were very verbal.  When I meet any person, I judge them as individuals, that has always been my policy, I was raised that way.  But experience and my luck with blacks has been bad, and I grew up in California, not the South.  </p>
<p>No doubt there are a few out there trying, but there are just too few.  Even honest talking Bill Cosby can&rsquo;t seem to make a dent in his own community.</p>

<p>The above comment is correct.  In reply, I will say that no race is genetically inferior OVERALL.  Each race has strengths and weaknesses.  However, because intelligence is so important for nearly everything, those races with high IQ are generally much more successful than those with low IQ.   </p>

			<p>Hello everyone,<br>
 It is brutally honest that we as a people, will NEVER be able to peacefully coexist with blacks, not with the bad history that has existed between us and them. I know of white couples that will not even think about having kids unless they have enough money to live in an all white community and be able to send their kids to private schools. I also know of a few white couples that have to work 2 full time jobs just so they can shelter themselves and their kids from blacks. All this time spent working extra hours and money spent on things that are considerd to be luxuries just to avoid contact with blacks! It really makes me wonder if this country is worht livinig in anymore, its obvious our goverment will not do anything about this problem and could careless about working poor and struggling middle-class whites. Why should we have any loyalty to a society like this?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the million dollar question Dave.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m inclined to think that by the end of this year not even the MSM will be able to operate with its usual amount of deception.  In fact, it&rsquo;s already becoming a victim of itself.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t be able to hide from us, or itself, that there is NO reason why ANY White person should be loyal to this Country as long as it&rsquo;s being run, or run over, the way it is at present. </p>
<p>Obama? For God&rsquo;s sake.  Does any White Man or Woman think he is going to do anything about the Middle East?  Does any White think he is going to stop Outsourcing our jobs, or stop giving them away with Work Visas?  Does any White think he will allow us to bear arms?  Does any White think he will put a stop to all of the anti-White propaganda?  He himself is, in part, the RESULT of endless anti-White propaganda!  Does any White think he will protect us from one of by-products of anti-White propaganda, Slander?  Which permits people to accuse us of Racism, Sexism, Anti-Semitisim, Homophobia, xenophobia and Nativism?  But that&rsquo;s virtually the platform he&rsquo;s running on, as this weeks events have shown.  Does any White think he will put a stop to Political Correctness?  He is a, or The, beneficiary of Political Correctness.  Does any White think he will help prevent Political Correctness from becoming a Police State? A Multi-Cultural, Anti-White Police State?</p>
<p>One of the Lefts favorite things in the world to do is to look at questions like these and dismiss them as meaningless and paranoia.  But let me say that the above questions were posed by a former believer, and supporter of, a Multi-Cultural America.  Because I believed in the whole Proposition Nation concept; and I was attracted to the notion of a Mulit-PERSPECTIVE Multi-Culturalism based entirely on an Open Dialogue that put Principles before Peronsalities and before any specific Culture.  But the more I kept pressing these beliefs against the weight of Reality the more Reality kept giving me these irritated looks, as if to say, &#8220;What&rsquo;s wrong with you?  I am Reality!  Do you think you can alter me completely with a belief?  And call THAT Progress?  The only real progress is learning to live in Reality!  You know, you and I would get along a lot better if you learned to live IN me and not stuff me in one of your little bottles, boxes, or bags, of belief.  You guys will do ANYTHING but face this fact.  You stuff me in one place or another, God, King, Country, Company, Family, Race, Gender, Gang, Sex-Drugs and Rock n Roll, ANYTHING to keep from facing the FACT that I will always outrank you!  Talk about a compulsion to repeat!  Quit your childhood and grow up!&#8221;</p>
<p>From this perspective, the only thing I see worth being loyal to is Reality, and my place in it.  But that&rsquo;s just one man&rsquo;s view.<br>

<p>It&rsquo;s even better if both parents are on the same page about how they raise their children. My sister, and her husband both homeschool their kids. They also limit and monitor their TV viewing habits. These kids say yes Sir, and yes Mam, do their chores without being reminded to. All of them test well above their age academically. They are not without social contacts, my sister has other White friends who are raising their chidren in the same manner, and their kids get along beautifully with them. Their upbringing is far more old-fashioned, than the way my sister and I were raised, but I have to say, I am extremely impressed by their respectful children my sister is raising.</p>

			<p>Since you&rsquo;re interested, Uncle Creamus, I built her a 1931 Model-A Ford.</p>
<p>Lots of people who build Model-A hot rods use small-block Chevy V-8s.  The problem is that this engine is 26&#8221; long, which means one must recess the firewall.  Since the Model A already has limited legroom, having been designed at a time when six foot-tall people were rarer than they are now, recessing the firewall is an unappealing option.  The 231 cubic-inch Buick V-6 &#8220;Even Fire&#8221; engine is 22&#8221; long and a perfect fit, so this is also popular.  The Wankel rotary out of a 1983 Mazda RX-7 is only 19.5&#8221; long, and only 260 lbs, so it fit quite easily, with *plenty* of room around it to allow easy maintenance.</p>

<p>I have heard similar stories from landlords who own rental property in inner city St. Louis, only with the number 90 instead of 80.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, there was a story from California, where the state wanted to have remote control of private thermostats in residences.  Presumably, the reasoning was &#8220;global warming,&#8221; &#8220;carbon footprints,&#8221; etc.  And right-wingers (rightly) erupted in outrage, so it probably won&rsquo;t happen now.  But I&rsquo;m just young enough to be naive enough to think that &#8220;irrational&#8221; government proposals have a very good but taboo secret reason.  I would like to think that someone in the California government knows the truth about energy waste among non-whites, and in these times when natural gas supplies are limited and expensive, they want to be able to keep thermostats in black and Hispanic domiciles from being too high.</p>
<p>Consider   &mdash;   even though in most cases these high gas bills based on a thermostat being set to 80 or 90 are paid by public assistance, that a significant percentage of the people set their thermostat that high still costs you, George Adamski, as someone who keeps their thermostat on 68.  The reason is that marginal increased natural gas usage from those sorts of customers means that the natural gas utilities must purchase more, and the increased demand drives up the cost of natural gas futures.</p>
<p>If governments got control of black thermostats and pushed them back down to something far less ridiculous, then everyone, even you with the 68 setting, would pay less.</p>

<p>I agree, the Left does not accept at all the rock-hardness of Reality. History, if they know any, is something that happened in some other universe. It offers them no clues at all as to human nature.</p>
<p>When I first came to this site, I listened to all the very excellent audio &#8220;Interviews with Jared Taylor&#8221; linked in the left margin on the site&rsquo;s home page, and I always remember that in one interview or debate Jared responded to some question with the simple reply, &#8220;Because it&rsquo;s real.&#8221; I always remember how his voice changed when he said that; there seemed to be a lifetime of  understanding and feeling in his statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s real&#8221; is a statement that probably could be useful in arguing with liberals about black crime, for example. They argue the subject as an abstraction  &mdash;  what is a priori &#8220;real&#8221; for them is &#8220;white racism&#8221; and nooses.</p>

			<p>Dedalus, you put it well. I have read many philosophers and philosophies of life, but the one man that really tried to understand reality for what it is, was Friedrick Nietzche. He was a man way before his time, and a prophet in his own time. Yes, at times he seems to get a bit carried away, but for the most part he was right on. I always noticed in the many philosophy classes I had to take before receiving a degree, that, many instructors always approached the Nietzche lessons with hesitation, almost fear it seemed.  </p>

			<p>To Dedalus:</p>
<p>Regarding Friedrich Nietzsche, now I&rsquo;m not sure if he had ever consumed excrement (equine or human) - I thought I read somewhere he did. Anyway, he also uttered the phrase, &#8220;If God is dead, then all is permitted&#8221;. For this one quote, he is denounced by theologians, philosophers, educators and others. I don&rsquo;t think he referred to the Lord himself, so much as moral fibre - if our sense of morality is flushed down the commode, then even the basest behaviors are celebratd. Nietzsche was well aware of what happened to the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>He also said the following, which, after I thought about it, concluded he&rsquo;s right onn the money:</p>
<p>&#8220;Some people die too early. Other people die too late. The notion of &#8216;dying at the right time&rsquo;, still sounds alien to us.&#8221;  </p>

			<p>Correct Citation<br>
It is true that &#8220;If God does not exist, everything is permitted&#8221; is an accurate capsule description of the belief espoused by Ivan Karamazov in the early chapters of The Brothers Karamazov. Ivan has concluded, or pretends to conclude, that there is no God, no immortality. As what he claims is a logical consequence, &#8220;everything is lawful.&#8221; However, Ivan never speaks the sentence in question, and neither does any other character in the novel! The phrase, &#8220;everything is lawful,&#8221; is used frequently by other characters as an idea that they got from Ivan. And once, Ivan says &#8220;If there is no immortality, there is no virtue.&#8221; But the magic sound-bite sentence is not to be found.</p>
<p>Katharena Eiermann, a true scholar, uses the sentence properly in her essay on Existentialism and Dostoevsky, where she writes, </p>
<p>Jean Paul Sartre has said that all of French Existentialism is to be found in Ivan Karamazov&rsquo;s contention that if there is no God, everything is permitted. </p>
<p>This is correct scholarship in two respects: </p>
<p>Eiermann does not put quotes around text that is not, in fact, a quote. <br>
She makes it plain that the statement belongs to a character, Ivan Karamazov   &mdash;   not to the authorial voice of Dostoevsky himself. <br>
These two points are essential to prevent misunderstanding. It is wrong to use double-quotes around text that is not an exact quote, because to do so tells an untruth about the cited author, saying he wrote certain words when he didn&rsquo;t. </p>
