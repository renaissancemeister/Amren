						<p>ANNAPOLIS &mdash; Some lawmakers want to withhold state aid from local governments with sanctuary policies that prohibit employees and police officers from asking someone&rsquo;s immigration status.</p>
<p>Delegate Warren Miller, R-Howard County, introduced a bill to ban sanctuary policies and require &#8220;local governments to fully comply with and support federal immigration law.&#8221; Non-compliance could result in loss of some state aid for policing.</p>
<p>The bill is &#8220;an attempt to de-incentivize illegal immigration,&#8221; Miller said.</p>
<p>Takoma Park and Baltimore have sanctuary policies in place, according to the Department of Legislative Services, which said Maryland law does not require county and municipal governments to assist the federal government with immigration enforcement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Sanctuary policies cause a host of financial, legal and criminal problems and negatively affect the quality of life for Marylanders,&#8221; said Brad Botwin, director of Help Save Maryland, a group whose goal is to eliminate the use of tax dollars for illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>He said illegal immigrants contribute to crowding in schools, depress wages and increase crime rates.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>CASA de Maryland, a Latino advocacy group, said the anti-sanctuary bill has no exception for victims or witnesses of crime, and puts employees at risk for lawsuits if they violate an individual&rsquo;s civil rights during questioning.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no easy way to determine someone&rsquo;s lawful status,&#8221; said Jessica Salsbury, a staff attorney for CASA de Maryland. &#8220;Although these bills require local governments to respect civil rights laws, these bills? in essence require racial profiling.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Sanctuary cities are a violation of the 1996 Immigration Reform Act. It&rsquo;s that simple. What&rsquo;s even more simple is placing the blame for this problem squarely where it belongs: on our Dunce-In-Chief, George W Bush. The man is REFUSING TO ENFORCE IMMIGRATIN LAWS!!! </p>
<p>THIS MAN IS TRULY A DISGRACE! TOO BAD WE HAVE SUCH GUTLESS PEOPLE IN CONGRESS!</p>

			<p>Sanctuary cities are an outright violattion of existing United States Immigration Law and the administration knows it. Everyday that goes by that they allow sanctuary cities proves the administrations criminal complicity regarding illegal immigration. </p>

			<p>You don&rsquo;t like this?  Well then&hellip;.write your senators and representatives.  Make a huge stink over it.</p>
<p>Not too long ago, through NumbersUSA, people tried to get Congress to pass a law that would have ended all federal aid of all types to so-called &#8220;sanctuary cities&#8221;.  The measure almost passed&hellip;..almost.</p>
<p>If enough people press the issue, the next time, it will pass.</p>
<p>But it will take more than sitting on your butt, complaining about it.  You need to add your voice to the cause.</p>

			<p>Sanctuary policies already violate the intent, if not the letter of federal and state laws. But by all means, please continue. At least it makes LaRaza and Casa spend money. Maybe if legislators write enough laws, someone will eventually enforce one, even if only by accident. Looking forward to that day.</p>
<p>Any publicly funded entity that adopts any form of sanctuary policy needs to lose every dime of tax money. Not just state money, but federal, too. Not 10 percent, not just the road money, but all of it. 100 percent. Automatically. The same day they write the policy, the cash flow stops. I think that would be the end of sanctuaries. </p>

			<p>I was in Annapolis yesterday. (And the week before, and &hellip;)</p>
<p>Those of us who took the time and made the effort to travel to Annapolis to testify for Miller&rsquo;s bill (and a similar bill by delegate McDonough) got mucho grief from Joe Valerio (D-27A), Ben Barnes (D-21) and Victor Ramirez (D-47).</p>
<p>Testimony was heated at times.  &#8220;The Establishment&#8221; was obviously upset that the people showed up and were rude enough to state their opinions.  </p>
<p>It was good to see how many blue-collar (white &amp; black) Americans made the effort to show up and testify.  But we were still far fewer than we should be.  One real activist is worth a thousand &#8220;computer-jockies.&#8221; </p>
<p>For all you Free Staters, the next hearing of importance in Annapolis is Wednesday, March 19th.  The bill in question is HB 288. which would stop illegal aliens from getting MD drivers licenses.  Promises to be a fun day, since the bill has 50+ co-sponsors but Judiciary Committe chair Vallario is pro-illegal!  </p>
<p>Email me if you need directions to Annapolis. </p>

			<p>Where are the attorneys who should be prosecuting the leadership for violation of Constitutional Oaths and all cities who are deliberately violating USA immigration laws. Many corps, churches, CC, foreign interest/ethnic groups etc, etc are placing &#8216;OTHER INTERESTS&rsquo; above USA National Security which is why immigration laws exist!  Just look around and see what is going on and why is there NO enforcement?????   It has to be  the President and his men, agencies, judges/courts.  USA Congress/Senate passesd laws in &#8216;65 to destroy USA heritage by undermining our rights and majority. </p>
