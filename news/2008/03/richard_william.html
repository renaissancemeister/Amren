						<p>As the father of Venus and Serena Williams, Richard Williams has been given a lot of attention by the media for the last decade. And every time the spotlight turns his way, he makes waves. He&rsquo;s claimed his daughters are the targets of racially motivated taunts in locker rooms and stadiums all around the women&rsquo;s tour, he&rsquo;s pulled his daughters from commitments and faced lawsuits and, generally, made sure that there was always as much attention paid to him as his kids. </p>
<p>So, it should come as no surprise that his <a href="https://www.deccanherald.com/Content/Mar132008/sportscene2008031257015.asp">interview with a newspaper in India</a> features plenty of things that will make your eyebrow raise. He blamed the media for Venus and Serena never experiencing Grand Slam success at the same time and then moved on to discuss racism in tennis.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Tennis is a prejudice game. Well, I&rsquo;m Black and I&rsquo;m prejudiced, very prejudiced. I&rsquo;ll be always prejudiced as the White man. The White man hated me all my life and I hate him. That&rsquo;s no secret. I&rsquo;m not even an American, it just so happens that I was born in America. People are prejudiced in tennis. I don&rsquo;t think Venus or Serena was ever accepted by tennis. They never will be. But if you get some little White no good trasher in America like Tracy Austin or Chris Evert who cannot hit the ball, they will claim this is great.&rdquo;</em></p>

			<p>Although I&rsquo;m not a fan of interracial dating, it cracks me up to know that his daughters almost exclusively date white men (Serena has dated a succession of white males including movie director Brett Ratner and Venus is currently dating white golfer Hanke Kunhne).</p>

			<p>Mr. Williams originally had Venus running track. She was racking up all kinds of age-group records in the mile etc as she was training full time at an age when other girls are playing with dolls. When the other girls grew up a bit more they began to run Venus into the ground because they had more natural ability. This drove Mr. Williams crazy at local all-comers track meets here in the L.A. area. This is well known in track circles. He&rsquo;d go crazy yelling at Venus when the &#8220;crackers&#8221; pulled away from her. So it was off to tennis, a sport where his daughter Serena was the very first player to decry the suggestion of testing female tennis players for steroids, HGH and other drugs. Where there&rsquo;s smoke, there&rsquo;s fire? Possibly. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never heard of him.  Probably it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve boycotted spectator sports for the last several years, which is exactly what every white should do.</p>
<p>The only way to get away from black whining, or at least keep it to a minimum in one&rsquo;s life, is to avoid as many contacts with blacks as possible.</p>
<p>In addition to avoiding spectator sports, I don&rsquo;t watch movies if they have a black in them who has anything but an insignificant role, and I do not watch television programs that have blacks.</p>
<p>Right now blacks are embroiled in contentious battles with other non-whites, especially Hispanics.  This situation will increase to the point where they will spend less time whining about whites and more time whining about Hispanics, which will give us a break of sorts.</p>
<p>As the economy continues to deteriorate and mestizos continue to push blacks out of schools, neighborhoods, and jobs, they will become less and less influential as America&rsquo;s chief whining minority and become America&rsquo;s chief incarcerated minority, and when that happens it will take their concentration away from whining about whites for whatever reason.</p>
<p>Be patient.  Blacks will slowly be replaced.</p>

			<p>I am sick and tired of those brainwashed white Marxist mamby pambies that keep responding to race issues with sentiments such as </p>
<p>&#8216;Well, I understand what&rsquo;s he saying and why he&rsquo;s saying it although I don&rsquo;t condone it&rsquo; (well, understanding something IS the same as sympathing with it, IS the same as condoning it, stupid) AND </p>
<p>&#8216;We should strive towards a time when colour no longer figures in anything&rsquo; AND </p>
<p>&#8216;Let&rsquo;s all try and look past William&rsquo;s ill manners and enjoy multiculturalism,&rsquo; </p>
<p>blah, blah AND more Marxist politically correct blather.   One even admitted he took part in the black Civil Rights riots of the 1960s.  He should be thoroughly ashamed of himself, the traitor!</p>
<p>Let me say categorically and clearly that the white world would not be in its present dangerous situation where we&rsquo;re hearing nonwhites, particularly blacks, publically calling for wholesale genocide on a global basis of white people, were it not for those Marxist renegade whites.  The blacks are simply taking advantage of a protracted and concerted Marxist indoctrination programme upon and against the white nations of this world. (Incidently, it will be interesting to sit and watch when certain other Third World Communist vested interests start replicating this brainwashing programme in such places as Africa, for example.)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s these pathetic Marxist indoctrinated whites that have ENABLED the blacks to become excessively emboldened and thus far too big for their britches over the past 65 years.  No wonder those other Third World invaders from Mexico are defacating all over white America.</p>
<p>The damned lot of them had better take stalk of world events because the Marxist induced brainwashing blinkers are coming off all over the West and the present political climate is inevitably going to do a 90 degrees turn in the opposite direction. When it does, blacks and other dangerous nonwhite rabble will, highly likely, be looking at return to whence they came or face the consequences. </p>
<p>No amount of white appeasement in the shape of Marxist invented collective self-sacrifice, racial self-loathing and/or self-denial, is going to assuage any nonwhites, most especially, blacks so whites had better start recognising that fact and fast.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The White man hated me all my life and I hate him. That&rsquo;s no secret.&#8221;  Williams is confusing his perception of racism with the rejection of his sour personal behavior.  And his personal behavior includes his own racism, as expressed.  I suspect there is nothing that would make this man happy, he has made a lifesytle out of being a malcontent justified with racism everywhere.  The clinical term for this is paranoid.</p>

			<p>Let them blab away&hellip;.I don&rsquo;t watch basketball, baseball, or football or tennis or golf anymore&hellip;.the blacks rule all those sports and if you read the papers, even when they are in college, they get into trouble after trouble&hellip;.at Penn State alone there are players who have been to court on charges of beating up people&hellip;and I think one was a rape case and of course drinking and breaking the rules.  It is worse in other colleges with more blacks.</p>

			<p>Another Black racist on the march. Do you think these leftist/marxist self-flaggelating Whites will wake up with this Black racism engulfing America? NO. They never will, no matter if they become a victim themselves. They are a lost cause and I do not consider them White. They must have mixed blood somewhere along the line to be so dumbed down. Or they are married to one or have children that are.</p>

			<p>Maybe his daughters have no heart, drive, or determination for the game. Maybe there&rsquo;s just too much negativity surrounding the game (from the father) that was suppossed to be fun, once.  </p>
<p>I played tennis competitively for years. I don&rsquo;t follow tennis much anymore. But, I would wipe the court with his daughters, fair and square, if I played them. I&rsquo;d be coming in with that attitude. </p>

			<p>Chris Evert or Tracy Austin &#8220;can&rsquo;t hit the ball&#8221;?  Let&rsquo;s see, Evert has won 157 titles in her career and earned just over 8.8 million dollars in prize money, she won the Australian Open twice, the French Open 7 times, Wimbeldon 3 times, the US Open 4 times, she&rsquo;s won 8 Doubles titles and her career stands at 1309-146. Little Tracy Austin in her short career was ranked number 1 in 1980, won the US Open twice, has 30 career titles, 4 Doubles titles, won just over 2 million in prize money, and a career record on 335-90.  And to think neither of these girls &#8220;can hit.&#8221;  Well, they must have been in the mob to rack up all this career accomplishments.  </p>

<p>https://www.freedomworks.org/newsroom/press_template.php?press_id=68</p>
<p>&#8220;Washington, D.C. -  The Washington Post reported Sunday that after Venus Williams won the U.S. Open on Saturday she greeted President Clinton with a question: &#8220;Can you lower my taxes?&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;It is estimated that after taxes, Venus Williams will take home $483,200 of her $800,000 check for winning the U.S. Open   &mdash;   a 39.6 percent government penalty for winning the U.S. tennis tournament. </p>
<p><br>
The first thing we should do to drastically reduce Black arrogance is to reduce their numbers in government jobs. Civil Service exams NOW!<br>

<p>There&rsquo;s a school of thought that these empowerment movements and liberation movements began with the emancipation of the third world from &#8216;colonialism&rsquo;. On many of the top campuses, even today, the works of writers from the (still exploited) third world are featured in the curriculum and there is a measure of solidarity with these oppressed peoples. It&rsquo;s an entire world view really, and whites who&rsquo;ve never even been to university find themselves engulfed in it&rsquo;s effects. For example, Accuracy in Media, reported that for the last Century the vast majority of human rights abuses occurred in nations unfriendly to the USA, while the vast majority of human rights abuses featured on the news, were in dictatorships &#8216;supported&rsquo; by the US. At university, third world nations like Nicaragua were featured as vibrant places unspoiled by greed and the west, until reality set in, and then they rushed off to discover a new pristine paradise to cover. It can be seen today in stories about &#8216;globalization&rsquo;. Many third world nations feature labor laws not unlike labor laws in the USA 100 years ago, yet, in the news, this somehow becomes an example of the opposite, an example of Western backwardness and evil. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry I don&rsquo;t have better examples here, I&rsquo;m just a goof who&rsquo;s never even graduated from college. I did attend obviously but received low grades on an awful lot of papers&hellip; </p>
<p>Tying this all to global oppression is really just a thin veneer of cover. And they are better at it than even the Kremlin was. Everyone knows the language of this &#8216;revolution&rsquo; originates from the West, and it possibly derives from, not an intellectual need to do what&rsquo;s right, or to feelings of solidarity with the oppressed of the third world, but, to the very real feelings of fear they have for people of color who are a lot closer to home. Really, it is a global outlook, and why shouldn&rsquo;t non-whites of the world believe in it? however, where it&rsquo;s advanced the farthest, and where these ideas originate from, seems to be the West. </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no need to rail against things half way around the world. The financing, the intellectual heft of the movement, the evil itself, originates right in America. You&rsquo;re exactly right, &#8220;blacks are simply taking advantage of a protracted and concerted Marxist indoctrination programme upon and against the white nations of this world.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a very social person, but if I were, it would be interesting to see how many people - say they believe in politically correct things, they don&rsquo;t really believe in (after all, almost everything they would have us believe is exactly the opposite of the real truth), and how many manage to delude themselves into really believing. </p>

<p>It seems apparent that Richard Williams is a disturbed man.  It&rsquo;s unfortunate that he gets publicity.  It might be a good idea to just ignore him, but that might lead to even more outrageous behavior as he desperately tries to get attention.  Another thing to do is just not give him what he wants.  He reminds me of the child who screams and stomps in an effort to get his/her way and continues to do so if he/she does.</p>

			<p>Williams put his daughters (?) in such a white sport because he wanted to annoy whites with black athletic prowess (sp?) and to expose white society to the crude and ignorant mannerisms of black society. He just wanted to &#8220;rub our noses in it&#8221;. <br>
Just like figure skating. Blacks are never the graceful skaters that whites are. .</p>

			<p>Well&hellip; At least he ADMITTED he was prejudiced.</p>
<p>Not a very smart guy, though. Why train his kids from an early age to be players in a &#8220;racist&#8221; sport?</p>
<p>I agree with a previous poster; it&rsquo;s better just not to watch spectator sports at all. Why get excited about your local football or basketball team when it&rsquo;s composed primarily of inarticulate thugs who&rsquo;d sucker punch you in a minute if they thought they could get away with it?</p>
<p>He goes too far in not watching movies or TV programs with black people in them, though. Eddie Murphy&rsquo;s &#8220;Coming to America&#8221;, for example, is genuinely witty and clever. </p>

<p>Thanks for the stats. Chrissie in her prime would have whipped both Williams brats 6-1, 6-1 (or worse) while barely breaking a sweat. And I&rsquo;m <i>not</i> saying that just because I had a huge crush on her as a teenager   &mdash;   she really was that great a player.</p>

			<p>To poster w.r.: You stole my thunder. I follow a similiar agenda in regards to the progams and entertaiment I view from the media outlets. I find basketball the most offensive. Overpaid black thugs chasing a ball around a court. While thousnds of dumb whites cheer them on. Some whites only concern seems to be basketball scores and a cold brew. Yes poster w.r. you are right on target.</p>

			<p>I think us whites who support these blacks who turn around and call us racists or who bash our country, should tell them &#8220;well, if that&rsquo;s how you feel, you can find someone else to support you&#8221;  That&rsquo;d probably shut them up real quickly.  As Walter Williams once said, &#8220;a snapped checkbook quickly opens a lot of minds&#8221;</p>

			<p>Hey folks.  Give blacks a break.  Think about what it must be like to get up every day of your life look around and observe the success and competence of whites in every aspect of life compared to black failure.  Now they have two choices; suck it up and admit they are the cause of their own misery or blame whitey.  End of story.</p>

			<p>From the original article, a direct quote from Mr. Tennis Dad:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m not even an American, it just so happens that I was born in America.&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Bingo, Mr. Williams! We sure agree on one thing  &mdash;  whatever you are, you&rsquo;re not an American. Great minds think alike!  Congratulations for starting to catch on.</p>
<p>By the way, have you communicated this insight to your tennis/White-enabled offspring? Perhaps they&rsquo;re catching on as well? We can only hope.<br>

			<p>Here is a black ( Richard Williams ) with more money than anybody posting here will probably see in a life time yet he still sits there and whines, bitches, and moans about racism. Williams says &#8220;the white man hated me all my life and I hate him&#8221; and I can see why white man hated him and it&rsquo;s because of &#8220;HIS&#8221; racist attitude.  It&rsquo;s always the biggest liars that think everybody is lying to them because they know what they do, likewise it&rsquo;s always the biggest racists that think everybody else is a racist because they know how they themselves are. No matter what these blacks get it will never be enough because their own hate and racism can and will never be overcome, IT&rsquo;S SOMETHING IN THE GENES!   </p>

			<p>[Blacks]    will become less and less influential as America&rsquo;s chief whining minority&hellip;, and when that happens it will take their concentration away from whining about whites for whatever reason.  Be patient. Blacks will slowly be replaced.<br>

So?   Where&rsquo;s the benefit?   It sounds to me like a case of jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire.  You&rsquo;re just switching the minorities.   Either way, you&rsquo;ll STILL have angry, disgruntled, whining minorities making demands.  Unless you&rsquo;re HIspanic, it&rsquo;s not going to do YOU any good.  </p>

			<p>Although I�m not a fan of interracial dating, it cracks me up to know that his daughters almost exclusively date white men (Serena has dated a succession of white males including movie director Brett Ratner and Venus is currently dating white golfer Hanke Kunhne).</p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>Gagggg&hellip; I wouldn&rsquo;t care how much money they have, the Williams sisters are both quite muscled and masculine looking and have well known violent tempers. I imagine it would be like dating a man who just happened to have female genitalia. </p>
<p>What are these guys thinking?</p>

			<p>If the ladies were into basketball, they would have blended right in or come out worse. Somehow it still would have been our fault that they didn&rsquo;t get enough exposure. </p>
<p>(Two black coaches hounded me all through middle school to play basketball in high school. I told them, &#8216;No Way!&rsquo;. At best, the girl&rsquo;s basketball team &#8216;played&rsquo; undisciplinied, wild street ball. I didn&rsquo;t want to be on their &#8216;team&rsquo; to be a leader or an example. I just wanted to play. I played in various chuch leagues across town.)</p>

			<p>One reason that these beasts  are taunted by the spectators as they cheer for foreign players is that they applaud themselves not as American athletes but, as Afreekan American athletes!</p>
<p>I enjoy watching tennis even though I don&rsquo;t play, but, to watch a match with the Williams brothers/sisters I have to turn off the sound to escape their primitive animal grunts at each swing at the ball.</p>
<p>I think another reason the Williams brothers /sisters have been jeered and racially taunted is that they are the only players who show up for games dressed as NY, Times Square whores wearing more gaudy jewelry than Queen Elisabeth wore to her Coronation. </p>
<p>Most people treat others with the respect that they are due but, maybe the Williams clan hasn&rsquo;t learned that, respect is something that is earned, not given away like Government cheese! </p>

			<p>Williams makes the point very clear: A &#8220;racist&#8221; is no longer someone who doesn&rsquo;t like blacks, but anyone whom blacks do not like.</p>

<p>Given the &#8220;white&#8221; mens&rsquo; surnames, I think many Amreners can agree to hope both pairs marry and have lots of kids, immediately.</p>

<p>This is so true!</p>
<p>The first thing we should do to drastically reduce Black arrogance is to reduce their numbers in government jobs. Civil Service exams NOW!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Posted by at 11:43 PM on March 21 </p>
<p>If that were to happen, we&rsquo;d have to warehouse far greater numbers of blacks in prison. Government jobs are just another form of welfare. Blacks for the most part can&rsquo;t survive or function in our society.</p>
