<h1><a href="https://online.wsj.com/article/SB120579535818243439.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">The Obama Bargain</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Shelby Steele, Wall Street Journal, March 18, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But whatever [Geraldine Ferraro&rsquo;s] motives, she was right: &#8220;If Obama was a white man, he would not be in this position.&#8221; Barack Obama is, of course, a very talented politician with a first-rate political organization at his back. But it does not detract from his merit to say that his race is also a large part of his prominence. And it is undeniable that something extremely powerful in the body politic, a force quite apart from the man himself, has pulled Obama forward. This force is about race and nothing else.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>How to turn one&rsquo;s blackness to advantage?</p>
<p>The answer is that one &#8220;bargains.&#8221; Bargaining is a mask that blacks can wear in the American mainstream, one that enables them to put whites at their ease. This mask diffuses the anxiety that goes along with being white in a multiracial society. Bargainers make the subliminal promise to whites not to shame them with America&rsquo;s history of racism, on the condition that they will not hold the bargainer&rsquo;s race against him. And whites love this bargain &mdash; and feel affection for the bargainer &mdash; because it gives them racial innocence in a society where whites live under constant threat of being stigmatized as racist. So the bargainer presents himself as an opportunity for whites to experience racial innocence.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Because he is black, there is a sense that profound questions stand to be resolved in the unfolding of his political destiny. And, as the Clintons have discovered, it is hard in the real world to run against a candidate of destiny. For many Americans &mdash; black and white &mdash; Barack Obama is simply too good (and too rare) an opportunity to pass up. For whites, here is the opportunity to document their deliverance from the shames of their forbearers. And for blacks, here is the chance to document the end of inferiority. So the Clintons have found themselves running more against America&rsquo;s very highest possibilities than against a man. And the press, normally happy to dispel every political pretension, has all but quivered before Mr. Obama. They, too, have feared being on the wrong side of destiny.</p>
<p>And yet, in the end, Barack Obama&rsquo;s candidacy is not qualitatively different from Al Sharpton&rsquo;s or Jesse Jackson&rsquo;s. Like these more irascible of his forbearers, Mr. Obama&rsquo;s run at the presidency is based more on the manipulation of white guilt than on substance. Messrs. Sharpton and Jackson were &#8220;challengers,&#8221; not bargainers. They intimidated whites and demanded, in the name of historical justice, that they be brought forward. Mr. Obama flatters whites, grants them racial innocence, and hopes to ascend on the back of their gratitude. Two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p>But bargainers have an Achilles heel. They succeed as conduits of white innocence only as long as they are largely invisible as complex human beings. {snip} And so, human visibility is Mr. Obama&rsquo;s Achilles heel. If we see the real man, his contradictions and bents of character, he will be ruined as an icon, as a &#8220;blank screen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus, nothing could be more dangerous to Mr. Obama&rsquo;s political aspirations than the revelation that he, the son of a white woman, sat Sunday after Sunday &mdash; for 20 years &mdash; in an Afrocentric, black nationalist church in which his own mother, not to mention other whites, could never feel comfortable. His pastor, Rev. Jeremiah Wright, is a challenger who goes far past Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson in his anti-American outrage (&#8220;God damn America&#8221;).</p>
<p>How does one &#8220;transcend&#8221; race in this church? The fact is that Barack Obama has fellow-traveled with a hate-filled, anti-American black nationalism all his adult life, failing to stand and challenge an ideology that would have no place for his own mother. And what portent of presidential judgment is it to have exposed his two daughters for their entire lives to what is, at the very least, a subtext of anti-white vitriol?</p>
<p>What could he have been thinking? Of course he wasn&rsquo;t thinking. He was driven by insecurity, by a need to &#8220;be black&#8221; despite his biracial background. And so fellow-traveling with a little race hatred seemed a small price to pay for a more secure racial identity. And anyway, wasn&rsquo;t this hatred more rhetorical than real?</p>
<p>But now the floodlight of a presidential campaign has trained on this usually hidden corner of contemporary black life: a mindless indulgence in a rhetorical anti-Americanism as a way of bonding and of asserting one&rsquo;s blackness. Yet Jeremiah Wright, splashed across America&rsquo;s television screens, has shown us that there is no real difference between rhetorical hatred and real hatred.</p>
