<p>As a result, a new program, called &#8220;No Place for Hate,&#8221; sponsored by the Anti-Defamation League, is being launched which will allow Colorado schools to implement anti-bias programs and projects.</p>
<p>The program was announced today by Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper and Bruce DeBoskey, regional director of the ADL&rsquo;s Mountain States Office, on the steps of Denver&rsquo;s City and County Building.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We are gathered here today to imagine a world without racism, without bigotry and without hatred. We are here to imagine a day when you won&rsquo;t see swastikas painted on the side of a synagogue or a home and a swastika will only exist between the covers of a history book,&#8221; said the mayor.</p>
<p>&#8220;We imagine a day when green grass covers a hole left by burning a cross, a day when any form of a hate crime becomes a thing of the past,&#8221; Hickenlooper added.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The steps include:</p>
<p>*&nbsp;Creating a coalition of administrators, teachers, staff, students, parents and community leaders to oversee the implementation of anti-bias programs and projects at the school.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;Sign ADL&rsquo;s &#8220;Resolution of Respect&#8221; and display it in the school. The resolution says, in part, that &#8220;I firmly believe that one person can make a difference and that no person can be an innocent bystander when it comes to opposing hate.&#8221;</p>
<p>*&nbsp;Complete three or more activities listed in the ADL&rsquo;s &#8220;Positive Impact!&#8221; Resource guide&rsquo;s 101 Ways to Make a Positive Impact in your community.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;Participate in one of ADL&rsquo;s &#8220;A World of Difference&#8221; Institute training programs.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;Complete and submit the &#8220;activities and fulfillment forms&#8221; to the ADL.</p>
<p>After the completion of the requirements, the school will be designated a &#8220;No place for Hate&#8221; campus.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The training programs also focus on both face-to-face bullying and cyberbullying. It teaches students about the harm of name-calling and bullying and develops skills to respond to such incidents.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He said the new program will help build a community that is &#8220;more accepting, more inclusive and more welcoming for all.&#8221;</p>

					<p>Could the <span class="caps">ADL </span>cite examples of &#8220;hate&#8221; not involving burning crosses and bent crosses?  (Which I&rsquo;m sure happen often in Denver).  I think AmReners can, but the <span class="caps">ADL </span>cannot.</p>
<p>Also, what&rsquo;s the wisdom in letting an organization found by civil court juries repeatedly liable for slander, libel, defamation (ironically), and one of these civil cases came out of the Denver Federal court jurisdiction   &mdash;   manage an anti-hate campaign?</p>

					<p>Also, I think the <span class="caps">ADL </span>is imitating the <span class="caps">SPLC&rsquo;</span>s long-standing &#8220;Teaching Tolerance&#8221; hustle.  The <span class="caps">ADL </span>is much older than the <span class="caps">SPLC, </span>but the <span class="caps">SPLC </span>is better at raising money from <span class="caps">ADL</span>-types.  So the <span class="caps">ADL </span>tries to one-up everything that the <span class="caps">SPLC </span>does, and vice-versa, under the realization that a dollar given to the <span class="caps">SPLC </span>is one not given to the <span class="caps">ADL </span>(and vice versa).  Both the <span class="caps">ADL </span>and the <span class="caps">SPLC, </span>along with a bunch of others, are part of a term I coined, the Paranoia-Industrial Complex.</p>

					<p>The <span class="caps">ADL </span>left out a step in their humanitarian program of tolerance and inclusion:<br>
Use terror bombing to drive out the British. Then raze Arab villages, rape their women, kill their children and eject 800,000 dirty Arabs from their own land and take it for yourself.<br><br>

					<p>Articles like this always remind of Jared Taylor&rsquo;s famous observation that if Diversity were indeed such a benefit, such an unquestionably desirable, natural thing; that we would not need such endless cajoling, such indefatigable re-inforcement to embrace it would we? Celebrating &#8220;Diversity&#8221; only becomes necessary when &#8220;Diversity&#8221; is forced upon us in the first place. The solution to this dilemma? Homogeneity! What could be more simple?   </p>

					<p>In other words, we expect whites (no matter how desperately provoked) to retain their native good manners.  After it stamps out racism, bigotry and hatred, could the <span class="caps">ADL </span>do something about junk mail?  And those faux pollsters who call around suppertime?  Wouldn&rsquo;t it be easier to let each man associate or not associate with whomever he pleases?  I mean, instead of a hundred and one methods for locking up the liquor store of hate on Sunday  &mdash;  gosh, that sounds expensive  &mdash;  you would need only one.  Give Everyman the right to be left the heck alone.   </p>

					<p>I like to think the lack of study skills and self-discipline that have made the American public high school what it is today, will guard our children from &#8220;anti-hate education, just as it has kept them free from an understanding of algebra.</p>

					<p><i> &#8220;Research shows that when there are programs like this in schools, kids attend more, perform better because there is less harassment, less hate speech,&#8221; said Makepeace. </i><br>
<p><br>
Really? It does? Well, then, who did the research? I&rsquo;m a mite skeptical, since similar programs for eliminating drug use and teen pregnancy seem to be dismal failures.</p></p>

					<p>It&rsquo;s all about the extremely rare cases of spray-painted swastikas and burning crosses with these groups.</p>
<p>Increasingly common racially motivated rape, torture and murder are conveniently overlooked, as they take advantage of the time children are legally required to spend in these schools. Not to mention that their parents must fund this indoctrination via tax dollars, even if they choose to have their children educated in private institutions or in the home.</p>
<p>The hypocrisy and blatant double standards these neo-Marxists relentlessly deliver time and time again know no bounds.</p>

					<p>Denver&rsquo;s mayor must be drinking something stronger than Coors beer, or he must be on some kind of &#8220;Rocky Mountain High&#8221; if he thinks that there will be a world without hate, bigotry or racism. He can imagine <span class="caps">ALL </span>he wants to, but it isn&rsquo;t going to make it so.</p>
<p>Jared Taylor should send Mayor Hickenlooper a <span class="caps">DVD </span>copy of Jeremiah Wright&rsquo;s sermon. Then, if he&rsquo;s got any Rocky Mountain stones in him, he should go to Wright&rsquo;s church, and demand him to stop his hateful preachings.</p>

The liberals have their new magic word, which will serve them well for decades.  That word is &#8220;hate.&#8221;  What is &#8220;hate,&#8221; exactly? Ah .  .  . of course .  .  . it&rsquo;s anything that the liberals don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s see .  .  . to start off, any belief that immigration should be restricted is &#8220;hate.&#8221; Any belief that affirmative action has drawback is &#8220;hate.&#8221; </p>

					<p>We&rsquo;re on the brink of an economic disaster of major proportions.  All the tribes in the US are fighting amongst themselves and all of them are fighting blacks.</p>
<p>Black/Hispanic racial conflicts are increasing in number and intensity, with the violence now turning to murders simply on the basis of race.  The more illegals that sneak into the country the more fractious it becomes.  Any kind of insult or perceived threat between two people or groups of different races have the potential to set off full-scale riots and armed clashes.</p>
<p>Jihadists have been uncovered in the mosques planning terrorism, while a few groups have set up training camps around the country to prepare for conflict or sabatoge.</p>
<p>All this is occurring constantly without let up and it gets just a bit worse with each passing year.</p>
<p>And all the while the <span class="caps">ADL </span>and the <span class="caps">SPLC </span>are naively planning programs that are designed to convert everyone into flower children who will see the light of love and tolerance, forsaking gun battles, drugs, and killing in favor of holding hands and singing in perfect harmony.</p>
<p>But are they really <span class="caps">THAT </span>naive?  Or is their do-gooderism just a front for fund raising in order to perpetuate organizations that cannot exist unless they can keep tired, scared old fools, paranoid about a white supremacist bogeyman that doesn&rsquo;t really exist.</p>
<p>I mean who is going to contribute to a group that thinks handing out fliers to murdering racists is going to make a difference?  I&rsquo;m surprised they don&rsquo;t suggest midnight basketball.</p>

					<p>Keep in mind that Denver City and &#8220;Denver&#8221; are not the same thing. Denver is a metro area that includes 2.4 million people. Denver City/County is less than 600,000 people and barely 50% white (50.3% as of 2006), meaning that the schools are probably less than 30% white. I&rsquo;m pretty sure this &#8220;terrific&#8221; program applies only to Denver County. Though I&rsquo;m sure it will metastasize into the larger Denver area eventually.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s truly commical. At the schools founded on racism and hate, where in many of them chidren of all ages begin the day, not with the pledge of allegiance, but by listening to the black national anthem, they have another program designed to instill: love for diversity, resistance to hate, and respect for victims, minorities, and people, and by love for diversity, and respect for people, these schools also mean people of color.</p>

					<p>The ADl program &#8220;Teaching Tolerance&#8221; is in all Boulder schools, not just Denver.  A library exhibit in Boulder Public Library taught children all about how bad Whites are.  The books included topics such as white slave holders, Indian killing, with not even one book that showed Whites as victims of crime waves, etc.  let&rsquo;s not forget the Rocky Mtn <span class="caps">ADL </span>lost a huge lawsuit when they illegally  wiretapped, and trashed on radio, a couple from Evergreen, CO (just west of Denver) that had a tiff with their Jewish neighbors. The <span class="caps">ADL </span>is so entrenched in our <span class="caps">FBI</span>/CIA/DHS, etc., training law enforcement that Whites are to be monitored and silenced, or jailed for exercising 1st Amendment rights. Teaching Tolerance?  I think the payout was $48 million by the <span class="caps">ADL </span>in the lawsuit.  Their whining just goes on and on, as does their fundraising.</p>

This is very much in line with the purpose of public schools today.</p>
<p>The president of the Buffalo teachers union has said essentially that what children learn about each other in school is more important than the lessons from teachers. For most teachers today, teaching math and reading only get in the way of teaching children the fantasy of racial love. They&rsquo;re going to make kids love each other by applying every wacky theory they can try. But they continue to fail because reality trumps theory every time.</p>

					<p>This frustrates me to no end! I see my 11 year old son struggle to just finish up this year of school at a community charter school that has been inidated with blacks since last year. He comes home repeating some of the rhetoric like these nuts are speaking of. It becomes my job to set him straight and tell him it is not wrong to see how dangerous blacks are, how a black will forget any of his white friends to favor a black he/she barely knows, how blacks use racism cries whenever they are losing a political debate, how they do not have a true and accurate understanding of <span class="caps">ANY </span>history (never mind just the <span class="caps">USA.</span>) etc. I will be placing him in a home school program next year. I am also planning on opening up a small business; one that he can take over when he gets older, so he doesn&rsquo;t have to go through the brainwashing our colleges offer nowadays. Anyone else think of something further I can do? He has to finish out his school year to be accepted in the home schooling program, but he only has about 2 months left of school and he is ok knowing that. </p>

					<p><span class="caps">QUIT BRAINWASHING OUR CHILDREN</span>!!  White Christian parents need to be ever vigilant to what their children are being taught in school.  They are being brainwashed into thinking because of their color and beliefs, they are somehow &#8220;bad&#8221;.  The ones doing this teaching, and thinking that they have the right to do this teaching, are the bad ones.  Pleasae make your children aware of <span class="caps">THEIR </span>rights in all of this.</p>

					<p>I participate in a discussion site (www.essembly.com) frequented mostly by young leftists.  They call me &#8220;racist&#8221; all the time - but, since I&rsquo;ve never posted anything hateful, they have no grounds to call me a &#8220;hater&#8221;.  The moral of the story: &#8220;hate&#8221; is a good thing to hate and we should constantly be emphasizing the fact that we are not haters.  Let them call us &#8220;racists&#8221; and let us take it with a smile but, without the &#8220;hate&#8221;, the insult &#8220;racist&#8221; loses most of its force.  It becomes reduced, in an obvious way, to what it really means: &#8220;somebody who questions/rejects the leftist dogma about the nature of race&#8221;.  Let them adopt their anti-hate slogans.  We object to hatred as much as they do except that we also object to hatred towards white people.  </p>
<p>In the final analysis, it is organizations like <span class="caps">ADL </span>that promote hate.  As was pointed out, standing by and doing nothing is tantamount to participating in hateful acts.  I want to know what the <span class="caps">ADL </span>has done for white victims of racism at the hands of &#8220;people of color&#8221;.  While we&rsquo;re at it,what about straight people who are victimized by homosexuals?</p>

					<p>I&rsquo;ve seen many examples of hate on my college campus.  Many professors have a bumpersticker with the Christian fish symbol mockingly drawn with legs and says &#8220;Darwin&#8221;.  Can you imagine if I mocked their religious symbol?  I say I&rsquo;d be brought before a hate tribunal.</p>

					<p>This program should be repudiated immediately by all believers in freedom of speech and expression. Once you read their Proclamation you will see that this is nothing but thought control  &mdash;  and is unconstitutional! </p>
<p>In Watertown, Mass. we dumped the program and so didn&rsquo;t other towns like Newton, Lexington, Needham, etc. I think the total was 11 towns in the greater Boston area that got rid of the <span class="caps">ADL </span>and their program. Any program that tries to criminalize the opinions and thoughts of others is unAmerican and illegal.   </p>

					<p>The <span class="caps">ADL </span>may win my support when it attacks the people running the mass media for blatantly ignoring the long standing and continuous abuse of white people by coloured criminals.  How about the loss of our cities to violent colored thugs?  Why is it that this elephant in the living room, dirty war of black against white issue not a concern to the <span class="caps">ADL</span>?  Why does the <span class="caps">ADL </span>instead choose to attack whites as bigots?  </p>

<p>But the long-term <span class="caps">ADL </span>support for gun control is so that Black criminal blood would not run like rivlets in the streets.</p>

					<p>&ldquo;We are gathered here today to imagine a world without racism, without bigotry and without hatred.&rdquo;  </p>
<p>Racism, bigotry and hatred by whites are perfectly natural human responses to the abominable criminal actions against whites perpetrated by minorities.  And racism, bigotry and hatred by minorities are perfectly natural human responses born of the inferiority-complex they experience when they compare themselves to whites.  The bottom line is that races and cultures are different and unique and some are capable of living together in harmony and some are not.  No amount of leftist indoctrination, brainwashing and social engineering can change that fact&hellip;<br>

					<p>Hoo-ray. So since our schools can&rsquo;t teach kids how to read, write, and do math, they&rsquo;re going to try and &#8216;educate&rsquo; (read: brainwash and terrorize) children into believing the <span class="caps">ADL&rsquo;</span>s Utopian foolishness.</p>
<p>You know the <span class="caps">REALLY </span>sad thing? They&rsquo;ll probably succeed at it&hellip;</p>

					<p>Whites can&rsquo;t be racist:<br>
1.)	Interracial violence is overwhelmingly black on white, not the reverse.<br><br>
2.)	Blacks have <span class="caps">ALL </span>the racial power in this country.<br><br>

					<p>A little while back a news story was linked on AmRen about some white students from the University of Kansas who were visiting in Denver where approached and shot for no reason by a group of blacks as they waited at a metro station. One of the white students interviewed told how the black shooters told the white victims that they (the white students) didn&rsquo;t &#8220;belong there&#8221; ( a black neighborhood).<br>

<p>There&rsquo;s a 3rd item to that list:</p>
<p>Definition of &ldquo;racism&rdquo;:<br>
1.)	Collective guilt<br><br>
2.)	Rehashing dead history to bash another race today.<br><br>
3.)	Advocating racial discrimination (e.g. so-called &ldquo;Affirmative Action&rdquo;)<br><br>
