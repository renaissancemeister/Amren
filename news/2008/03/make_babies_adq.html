						<p>QUEBEC &mdash; The Action Démocratique du Québec wants to stimulate growth by urging women to make more babies and save Quebec from its steady demographic decline.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we have more babies, it would bring a lot more prosperity to this nation. It&rsquo;s a key factor for investors to invest in Quebec,&#8221; said Stéphane Le Bouyonnec, president of the ADQ&rsquo;s policy commission.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to have a nation that will be strong and survive in 20 years. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If we don&rsquo;t change our approach, we will decline as a nation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ADQ has set its sights on increasing the fertility rate from an average of 1.6 to two babies per woman by investing 3 per cent of the province&rsquo;s gross domestic product into an &#8220;ambitious&#8221; family policy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have four children, but ideally it would be to make at least two. We are currently at 1.6. We are steadily declining and that&rsquo;s awful,&#8221; said Linda Lapointe, an ADQ member of the National Assembly. &#8220;I urge everyone to adhere to this [target] and make babies.&#8221;</p>
<p>The policy includes paying a maximum $5,000 baby bonus for a third child, a $100 weekly allowance for preschool children who do not attend daycare and scholarships for stay-at-home mothers to seek degrees and improve their chances of finding work.</p>
<p>The proposals are part of a new program that will be debated at the party convention on the weekend in Laval.</p>
<p>In 2002, Quebec spent 2.4-per-cent of GDP or $6-billion ($3.4-billion from Quebec and $2.4-billion from Ottawa) on family assistance. The ADQ contends the percentage of GDP invested in family assistance hasn&rsquo;t changed and proposes a combined federal-provincial funding of $9-billion a year.</p>
<p>Immigration policy will also be a central part of the party&rsquo;s proposed program. Although Quebec faces a shortage of skilled labour, the ADQ contends that immigration must be curbed and the criteria for choosing newcomers revised. The party says too many immigrants are allowed to enter because they speak French without having the proper skills to find jobs. A balanced approach must be achieved to meet labour market demands, the ADQ argues, while giving tax credits to companies that offer French language courses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quebec cannot absorb current levels of immigration. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We are importing unemployment. The level of unemployment among immigrants is 25 per cent higher than among non-immigrants,&#8221; Mr. Le Bouyonnec said yesterday.</p>
<p>One of the party&rsquo;s demands is to obtain full control over the federal employment insurance program, saying that it will streamline job training in order to meet Quebec&rsquo;s specific labour needs.</p>
<p>The ADQ is also proposing more private-sector involvement in health care and public transportation by introducing &#8220;healthy competition&#8221; in the delivery of services. The party contends that if public services are forced to compete with the private sector it will lead to more efficient and less costly services.</p>
<p>The ADQ also wants a major overhaul of the taxation system that could involve introducing user fees for certain services. It proposes &#8220;the establishment of a clear policy on the fixing of rates according to the user-pay principle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We think it is important to motivate people to be more efficient when they use public services and this would save public money,&#8221; said Diane Bellemare, the party&rsquo;s senior economic adviser.</p>
<p>In order to revamp Quebec&rsquo;s image abroad &mdash; viewed as being &#8220;too socialistic&#8221; because of the &#8220;unions whose presence in Quebec businesses is the strongest in North America&#8221; &mdash; the ADQ proposes to make labour legislation more &#8220;flexible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to bring together the government, unions and business leaders to modernize our labour laws through negotiations,&#8221; Mr. Le Bouyonnec said.</p>
<p>The party has gone to great lengths to eliminate what were considered questionable elements of its program, but potentially embarrassing proposals always seem to find their way onto the floor of the convention. For instance, one riding association proposed that alimony payments be limited to a five-year maximum period to encourage an ex-spouse to attain &#8220;economic independence.&#8221;<br>

			<p>Quebec has a much clearer sense of its need to assert its cultural rights over those of third-world immigrants, as compared to English Canadians and Americans. That&rsquo;s because Quebec is a tiny French island in North America surrounded by (for now at least) a fortress of English. Hence the reasonable accommodation public hearings currently going on in Quebec. And Quebec wasted no time in stamping out sharia law, unlike the Ontario government which dithered for years over this issue (before finally nullifying it, at least officially).</p>
<p>However, former Quebec governments have offered baby bonuses, all to no avail. The &#8216;Quebecois pure laine&rsquo; (pure stock, white, Catholic, French-speaking Quebecers) birthrate remained below 2.1. I fear that it will be third-worlders who will take advantage of any future baby bonuses and continue to multiply their numbers astronomically.</p>

			<p>I used to tell the &#8220;kids&#8221; at Applebee`s that I came of age during a great time. &#8220;It was after birth control and before AIDS,&#8221; I`d say. Now a days  I`m not so sure&hellip;</p>

			<p>Until they put this is RACIAL terms, they will fail. These benefits must only go to WHITE parents having WHITE children ONLY.</p>
<p>All non-whites should either be deported or fined for having non-white children.  Whites must have their own homeland to survive. Have we not learned this from the Jewish people? Do they not have their own homeland? We whites deserve the exact same thing as Jews do.</p>
<p>The reason white parents are not having white babies is because they see this massive non-white immigration and it scares them to death. </p>
<p>Why have white chidren when you know they are going to be killed/raped when they grow up just like white students in America are killed/raped by the Africans today? Whites aren&rsquo;t that stupid.</p>
<p>Normal instinct tells you to stop reproducing when there is stress on your environment. As long as we have these Africans around us, whites will naturally NOT reproduce. We are killing ourselves with this immoral, disgusting, unnatural, forced &#8220;diversity&#8221;.</p>

			<p>  While i agree with the logic of this, Quebec already has the most generous government support for children ( funded by the rest of the country).  They also neglect to state the true objective of this campaign.  More french Quebecers means a greater chance of a positive outcome in their next separation referendum as immigrants tend to vote to stay a part of Canada.</p>

			<p>Quebec has been busy fighting english for the past forty years.</p>
<p>In the meantime their province has been overrun with foreigners that want nothing to do with french language or culture.</p>
<p>The language police in Quebec recently were called to an Irish pub that had some irish (english) language posters on the walls for decoration.  Guess what the pub had to remove the offensive english posters.</p>
<p>The french quebecers deserve all the foreigners they get.</p>
<p>I guess they like them better than the english.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t get me going on the catholic church.  Nothing much more than a pedophole organization and a congregation that is even sicker and completely lost.</p>

			<p>I agree with the posters who say that non-white parents will take disproportionate advantage of any such subsidies. So Mr. and Mrs. White will be forking over more money to Mohommed&rsquo;s parents.</p>
<p>Bottom line: Things are going to have to get much, much worse before they get better. Compared to most people in most countries at most periods in history, Western whites are still relatively comfortable, and therefore unready to face uncomfortable reality. </p>

			<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Quebec nationalists want babies, not immigrants.</p>
<p>A good point, certainly. AS LONG AS CANADIANS DON&rsquo;T GET INTO THE LUNACY OF TRYING TO OUTBREED THE THIRD-WORLD TRASH   &mdash;   which would be a lose-lose situation for all!</p>
<p>Whites need to reproduce. Only an idiot would argue against that. Then again, only an idiot would tell White people how many or how few children to have. That MUST ALWAYS be a personal choice&hellip; one far too important to be dictated by either church or state. </p>
<p>All White nations had better start waking up out of their stupor. SHARPLY LIMITING THE NUMBER OF NON-WHITE IMMIGRANTS! Unless, of course, the White nation is anxious to bring about the death of its culture, the destruction of its values, and most assuredly, the automatic decline in the QUALITY OF LIFE third-world immigrants cause for White citizens!</p>
<p>If anyone is stupid enough to claim flooding a nation with large numbers of non-White immigrants DOES NOT lower the quality of life&hellip; I can only suggest that person is either a hopelessly deluded fool or has not lived next to, or worked much with non-White immigrants! (Yes, you liberals, I DO SPEAK FROM EXPERIENCE!)</p>

			<p>Quebecors to Canada, are kinda like the blacks are to the states. Ours, whine, b*tch, complain, threaten irresponsable sepparation, untill they get what they want, not what thier fair share is. Childish, immature, and very racist, is what I found them to be like within my exploration of my homeland/country. But, unlike the blacks and other non whites, I would sorrilly miss their culture as a part of Canada if the non-whites over run our french province. I would miss the whinning moreso compared to the violence and crime that arrives with non whites. </p>

			<p>The reason whites are not having more babies is because we plan to be financially responsible for the children we create.  We don&rsquo;t procreate and expect others to care for (financially and physically) our children.  I do agree that whites should be encouraged to have more children, but the thought that I will be creating children so they can pay for these immigrant children makes me sick to my stomach&hellip;</p>

  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  <br>
I take exception to the above comment as a bilingual English Canadian who has actually lived in both parts of Canada. I&rsquo;ve never encountered any hostility from French Canadians, even among those who are committed to independence. I also have to ask them outright about their grievances against Canada, since they are usually too polite to raise this subject on their own. In general, most French Canadians are pretty much like most English Canadians: nice, well meaning, and often too idealistic.</p>
<p>Yes, Quebec does get more out of the pot than it puts in. Most Canadian provinces get more out than they put in, and the ones that take out the most are the Atlantic provinces, not Quebec. Yet I rarely hear English Canadians complain about that. </p>
<p>There was also a time when Quebec put in more than it took out. Who helped pay for the St. Lawrence Seaway, which moved so much shipping from Montreal to Toronto? Who helped pay for the CNR and the CPR? Most of that money came from Quebec because Quebec used to be the country&rsquo;s financial and economic hub.</p>
<p>On a final note, I&rsquo;m more optimistic about Quebec&rsquo;s future than about English Canada&rsquo;s. When English Canadians talk about their future, they mean their retirement plan and the prospects for selling their home at an inflated price. When Quebecois talk about their future, they mean the survival of their people.</p>

			<p>I am for ethnic cultures like the Quebecois being able to replace themselves.  In Slovenia, Slovenes are given many incentives to have Slovenian children and my old friend their is on his second wife and fourth kid despite his cancer fight (great social medicine program).  In Finland, Finns are quickly being outnumbered by the Africans they are importing.  The problem is that countries with no stabiity produce surplus populations due to lack of education and options like abortion/sterility programs.  Governments are finding it more expedient to import the poor, population surpluses of nearly failing nations or frankly failed nations rather than work to preserve their identities.  New World nations like Canada and the U.S. are best at doing this as it is just a slight dishonest leap from rational immigration traditions to an open door policy.  Capitalism also doesn&rsquo;t care what color its workers are, as long as the owners can make profits.</p>
<p>But remember the Quebecois were the first European settlers in Canada.  It was they who opened up the wilderness, etc.  The Quebecois won the French and Indian War here, but since France lost The Seven Years War (same war, different front) in Europe, the Quebecois&rsquo;s acheivements were lost.  The Quebecois and their cousin Cajuns in Louisiana are also some of our best national allies, with the Cajuns (originally from Acadia, Canada until the British ran them out for not making personal oaths of allegiance to the British King and fighting as guerillas against the British for over a hundred years).  They are some of the most fierce political conservatives I have ever met.</p>
<p>I hope they remain our historic neighbors and allies.  We could take some lessons from them in how to go about preseving ourselves in the face of a government that seems bent on even peopling the smallest towns in Canada with Somalies.</p>

			<p>How much influence does this ADQ group have?  I know that for years, the mainstream Quebec separatists encouraged immigration of non-white French speakers such as Hatians. Ironically, these people usually voted against independence.   </p>

<p><br>
No!<br>
Far too many Whites are greedy materialists and are therefore not willing to sacrificy too much time or money on children.</p>
<p>Non whites are most often greedy too, but they get government handouts or their women are not educated enough for full-time work anyway. <br>
Educated or rich nonwhites also have very few children. Be it India, Turkey, Brazil, Pakistan, Arab countries, China etc.:<br>
Everywhere do rich people have very very few children, mostly just one ore two! Do a little research, then you will find, that there is a strong correlation between education and birth rate and between income and birth rate!</p>
<p>But the fact, that nonwhites are also greedy does not interest me, because I don&rsquo;t care for nonwhites.</p>
<p>Our major problem is hedonism and a lack of family values and solidarity amongst our own kind.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Normal instinct tells you to stop reproducing when there is stress on your environment.&#8221;</p>
<p>The stress is caused by a declining percentage of white people. Therefore, reproduce, alleviate the stress. </p>
<p>I understand the ideal solution is stopping immigration cold, but until that happens, what choice do we have? Breed or see your genes die out. </p>

<p>Things were too far gone long ago. There&rsquo;s no one single answer to any of these troubles, but I&rsquo;m not adding to the mess. </p>
<p>If a couple, man and woman, looks to God first and is financially stable, equalling contributing in all respects, before having kids; that&rsquo;s an assumeablely good situation to have kids. Then when unexpected events in this life happen, there&rsquo;s a little more cushion available for dealing with problems. (But there has never been any criteria for having kids. Most people think they should just because they can. A lot of people need a license to raise children-not that it would make a difference.) </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, it&rsquo;s not all about the money. (It is for the politicans making the laws that we are to live by, but not for my personal life.) Having the support of friends and family help also. But, if the parents have to struggle financially before and during their kid&rsquo;s life so much so that they can&rsquo;t enjoy having their kids around or they may even resent having their kids so young or at all, what&rsquo;s the point? </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not out to save the world. I&rsquo;m responsible for myself. I try to help others on a small-scale whenever I can. I just want to be happy while I can, without being a burden to anyone else. I question if I should be doing something differently in my life to find happiness in ways other than just what everyone else in the past ages have always tried. Maybe there&rsquo;s more out there for me than just having children. If others could want to believe this, maybe our world wouldn&rsquo;t be so overpopulated.  </p>
<p>-7:24 3/13- 30-yr-old white female who has never felt that she&rsquo;s been at a place in her life to have children (because I&rsquo;m not in love with or married to a man), but always been able to look on from the outside</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m not out to save the world. Individuals have to be responsible for themselves. Many people don&rsquo;t think long-term on the idea of having kids. Believe it or not there is happiness outside of having kids. If more people took the time to know God or themselves, the world be much different. </p>

			<p>This is important news. As one poster noted, the Quebecois have a stronger sense of identity than anglophone Canada. If they do seperate from the universalist, multicultural decaying state of Canada, they might actualy survive as a Euro-descended peoples.</p>
