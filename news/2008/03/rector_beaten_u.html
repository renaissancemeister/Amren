<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>I wrote yesterday about the attack on Canon Michael Ainsworth in his own east London churchyard by three &lsquo;Asian&rsquo; youths. From the rather fuller stories about this incident in today&rsquo;s papers, it is clear that this is far from the first such attack in the area. Indeed, there appear to have been many attacks on vicars or churches by Muslims who are clearly intent on turning east London into a no-go area for Christians (and, given the stoning of the Jewish group visiting the area on Holocaust Remembrance Day, for Jews as well. The mosque in the picture, by the way, was once St Sophia cathedral which was converted into a mosque on the fall of Constantinople in 1453, the fate of innumerable churches under Islamic conquest).</p>
<p>The jihadi nature of the attack on Canon Ainsworth, who was taken to hospital after being kicked and punched in the head when he asked three &lsquo;Asian&rsquo; youths who had gathered in the churchyard of the ancient church of St George-in-the-East to quieten down, is unmistakeable. The Mail on Sunday reports that the church</p>
<blockquote>has regularly had windows smashed by youths &mdash; who on one occasion shouted: &lsquo;This should not be a church, this should be a mosque.&rsquo; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In another attack on the church, families were showered with glass when a brick was thrown through a window during a service. Mr Allan Ramanoop, a member of the Parochial Church Council, said often parishioners were too scared to challenge the gangs. The Asian church member, who lives nearby, said: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been physically threatened and verbally abused on the steps of the church.
<p>On one occasion, youths shouted: &#8220;This should not be a church, this should be a mosque, you should not be here&#8221;. I just walked away from it &mdash; you are too frightened to challenge them. We have church windows smashed two to three times a month. The youths are anti-Christian.&rsquo; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The Reverend Alan Green, Area Dean for Tower Hamlets, said it was the latest in a series of &lsquo;faith hate&rsquo; crimes in the borough.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&bnsp;. &lsquo;There are one or two incidents of faith hate every month across the borough and across all faiths&rsquo;.</blockquote></p>
<p>The Sunday Telegraph further reported:</p>
<blockquote>A survey of London clergy by National Churchwatch, which provides personal safety advice, found that nearly half said they had been attacked in the previous 12 months. The organisation suggested that vicars should consider taking off their dog collars when they are on their own.</blockquote>

															<h2><a href="/news/main-jhtml_xml_/news/2008/03/16/nrowan316.xml">Rector Beaten Up &lsquo;Over His Faith&rsquo;</a></h2>
											<p>
							<i>Jonathan Wynne-Jones and Bnn Leach, London Telegraph, March 16, 2008</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>A clergyman is in hospital after he was beaten up in his churchyard by three Asian youths, in an incident which police are treating as a &#8220;faith-hate&#8221; attack.</p>
<p>Canon Michael Ainsworth, 57, asked the gang to keep their noise down but they turned on him, taunting him about his faith and hitting him in the face and body.</p>
<p>He was found slumped in the churchyard of St George-in-the-East in Stepney, east London. Police said the gang made &#8220;remarks insulting his occupation&#8221; before fleeing.</p>
<p>A parishioner said: &#8220;There was blood everywhere. All the church members are in shock. Our canon is such a nice man who has done so much for the parish.&#8221;</p>
<p>Police are appealing for witnesses to the attack on March 5. No arrests have been made. Mr Ainsworth was initially treated in hospital and given the all-clear, but has since returned for further treatment after feeling unwell.</p>
<p>The canon, a former member of the Church of England&rsquo;s General Synod, moved to the area from Manchester last year. Colleagues said that his appointment was designed to improve the parish, which has a large Bangladeshi Muslim population and high levels of unemployment.</p>
<p>The Rt Rev Stephen Lowe, Bishop of Hulme, who used to work with Mr Ainsworth, said: &#8220;I would want to see a condemnation of this cowardly behaviour by senior Muslims in the community and really hope there isn&rsquo;t an over-reaction from the white community.&#8221;</p>
<p>A survey of London clergy by National Churchwatch, which provides personal safety advice, found that nearly half said they had been attacked in the previous 12 months. The organisation suggested that vicars should consider taking off their dog collars when they are on their own.<br>

One cannot blame anyone but the British for this sad state of events because of their failure to learn from the horrible mistakes made by the US, a defeat we are now euphemistically &#8220;celebrating&#8221; as a &#8220;civil rights&#8221; &#8220;victory&#8221;. </p>

			<p>I hate to say it but what Britain needs is a dose of tough skin-heads (not anti-semitic though) to pound some humility into those &#8220;Asians&#8221; skulls.  The British are far too civilized and they&rsquo;re forbidden to own guns.</p>

<p>The white community has been abandoned by their government, whose duty it was to protect the integrity of the country.  Any reaction from the white community would be just.  </p>

			<p>Despite the severe criticism from the other main traditional political parties in Britain who are responsible for the current problems in part, the legally constituted and registered nationalist British National Party is gathering more votes in local elections around Britain especially when attacks like this occur and they are not legally jumped on  hard enough.</p>
<p>Even some ethnic groups are supportive as they know that if action is not taken while the bulk of citizens are still being civilised about the problems, much blood will flow on the streets as it has in the past, but this time it will be very serious and in conservative Britain, that will be a big step that is as the result of the wrong government actions in the past.   Why are the older &#8220;wise men&#8221; ignored now?</p>

			<p>To Jewamongyou<br>
You come up with a fair point, however the only problem is white people in these areas are very much the minority. If a gang of white youths did start attacking these pakistani and Bangladeshi gangs not only would the police arrest them but they wouldn&rsquo;t stand much of a chance in the first place(ie; there&rsquo;d be outnumbered). The ironic thing is that the church will end up a mosque as the christian population move out and muslims continue to move in. It wouldn&rsquo;t suprise me if in the not so distant future an armed muslim seperatist movement emerges in parts of urban England!    </p>

			<p>Almost certainly this Church of England cleric is part of the immigration-loving traitors who are destroying European culture. Sorry he was injured, but it&rsquo;s what happens when your society welcomes alien thugs.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The children and grandchildren of those who stood alone against Nazi Germany are prepared to surrender without so much as a protest.&#8221; Please   &mdash;   don&rsquo;t make me laugh. Britain&rsquo;s fall from the pinnacle of world power, its impoverishment and the loss of its empire all stem from its cavalier embarkation in 1939 on a crusade against Germany, an &#8220;enemy&#8221; that had absolutely NO designs upon Britain and whose leader was in fact an inveterate anglophile.     </p>
<p>Blind adherence to the old policy of breaking any power that &#8220;threatened&#8221; to dominate the continent that animated Britain since the War of Spanish Succession hurt Britain severely in the twentieth century. Because she would fight to the death to prevent Danzig from being German (as it rightfully was), she can now fret about London becoming Pakistani. </p>
<p>Good. They deserve it.  </p>

			<p>This is like a repeat of history. Take a look at the Saxon history in England. The only difference is that the white Saxons worked out okay for England. The same cannot be said today.</p>

<p>Actually, had their grandpappys seen to that they lost to Nazi Germany, this topic would not even be discussed. The grandchildren of the people you speak of are being hoisted on their grandfathers petards. How ironic - they won the war thereby ensuring their grandchildren would lose their land. </p>
