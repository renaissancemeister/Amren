<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Despite pressure from big business, Hispanic leaders and passionate lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, the Indiana House passed a bill Thursday night to crack down on illegal immigration.</p>
<p>The 66-33 vote came after two hours of heated debate on the House floor. The Senate approved a similar bill by a 37-11 vote in January.</p>
<p>The legislation &mdash; which can revoke an employer&rsquo;s business license for repeatedly hiring illegal immigrants &mdash; is likely headed to a House-Senate conference committee, where differences between the bills would be worked out.</p>
<p>Earlier Thursday, Gov. Mitch Daniels declined to commit his support until he saw the final bill.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Supporters said the bill was necessary because illegal immigrants are taking jobs away from legal residents and costing state taxpayers money for education, law enforcement and incarceration.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Opponents say this bill will not solve a national problem and will lead to racial profiling and discrimination against anyone who looks Hispanic.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In addition to the crackdown on employers, the legislation requires the Indiana State Police to enter into an agreement with federal officials to seek training and begin enforcing federal immigration laws. The attorney general would also be asked to investigate written complaints made against employers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some critics say the bill does not go far enough.</p>
<p>Rep. P. Eric Turner, R-Marion, who wanted to also deny illegal immigrants certain social benefits and tuition support, called the legislation &#8220;illegal immigration light.&#8221;</p>
<p>Others said any kind of crackdown will be harmful to Indiana when thousands of Hispanic workers leave the state out of fear, as has been the case in Oklahoma and Arizona.</p>
<p>&#8220;How will we adjust to worker shortages in Indiana?&#8221; asked Rep. Mara Candelaria Reardon, D-Munster. &#8220;The negative consequences of this bill will be costly to our economy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The legislation can revoke an employer&rsquo;s business license for repeatedly hiring illegal immigrants&hellip;FINALLY!&hellip;business interests are NOT first&hellip;the interests of their CONSTITUENST overrides the interests of business AND illegal aliens!</p>
<p>Supporters said the bill was necessary because illegal immigrants are taking jobs away from legal residents and costing state taxpayers money for education, law enforcement and incarceration&hellip;&ldquo;How will we adjust to worker shortages in Indiana?&rdquo; asked Rep.

<p>&ldquo;The negative consequences of this bill will be costly to our economy.&rdquo;&hellip;MORE negative than illegal immigrants taking jobs away from LEGAL residents and CITIZENS?&hellip;MORE negative than the SPIRALING costs to state taxpayers for education, law enforcement and INCARCERATION of ILLEGALS and their kids?</p>
<p>Opponents say this bill will not solve a national problem and will lead to racial profiling and discrimination against anyone who looks Hispanic&hellip;the PURPOSE of this bill is to solve the problems CREATED by ILLEGALS in their STATE!&hellip;but, if OTHER states would do the SAME&hellip;this bill and others just like it WOULD solve the NATIONAL problem!&hellip;it&rsquo;s NOT discrimination&hellip;HISPANICS make up the MAJORITY of the ILLEGAL population!&hellip;racial &#8220;profiling&#8221;?&hellip;SO WHAT!!!</p>
<p>Some critics say the bill does not go far enough&hellip;Rep. P.

<p>Others said any kind of crackdown will be harmful to Indiana when thousands of Hispanic workers leave the state out of fear, as has been the case in Oklahoma and Arizona&hellip;&#8221;HISPANIC&#8221; workers won&rsquo;t leave the state nor will they be afraid&hellip;IF they are LEGALLY here or AMERICAN citizens!&hellip;only those &#8220;HISPANIC&#8221; workers who are here ILLEGALLY will leave or have something to fear!..however, having to deal with ILLEGALS on a DAILY basis&hellip;they aren&rsquo;t going ANYWHERE for they FEAR nothing!&hellip;they KNOW they have too many ALLIES in our highest office of government to fear anything?&hellip;but, then, too, if they leave &#8220;out of fear&#8221;&hellip;maybe CITIZENS who LEFT the state out of fear of these ILLEGALS and the chaos they CAUSE&hellip;will COME BACK to the state!</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m betting Gov. Daniels, a corporate whore (privatized Indiana toll roads and sold them to the Arabs), veotes it.  But if these same margins in the House and Senate hold, they&rsquo;ll successfully override the veto.</p>

<p>It will not, you know it, and you won&rsquo;t say so because you&rsquo;re a liar who wants to enrich himself off cheap slave labor.</p>
<p>They made a big mistake by not including the denial of social benefits.</p>

			<p>Anyone who has been to Indiana knows that the &#8220;worker shortage&#8221; is caused by lack of a decent paying job. Most middle class people work two jobs paying slightly over minimum wage, which describes a lot of jobs available in Indiana. Companies keep relocating to Indiana because of low property values, low business/corporate taxes, and plenty of illegals to pay poor wages too. Who cares if they run short of workers? Most Indianans won&rsquo;t shed a tear over the failure of any of these businesses building their wealth on the backs of illegals and people with no other options.</p>

			<p><i>&ldquo;How will we adjust to worker shortages in Indiana?&rdquo; asked Rep. Mara Candelaria</i></p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be no shortage of workers after the illegals leave, Mara. There&rsquo;ll just be a shortage of workers who&rsquo;ll work for minimum wage with no benefits. The greedy robber barons who no doubt give beaucoup bucks to you re-election campaigns will have to pay a decent wage, which must be hard for them. Why, they&rsquo;ll probably have to buy their little girl a regular old Cadillac for her 16th birthday instead of a Ferrari, but things are tough all over, you understand.   </p>

			<p>This law is so watered down and pathetically ineffectual to bring about one conviction, let alone a series of egregious convictions that I would index it in the Indiana Legal Code under &#8220;No Worries&#8221;.</p>

			<p>If this bill survives a process in which fatcat politicos like to water down bills, and makes it to the Governor who will hopefully sign it, it will mean illegals in Indiana will flood into my home state of Illinois (Illegals are praised by Chicago mayor Daley and our corrupt governor).</p>

			<p>How can legislators presume to &#8220;pass&#8221; a bill when they have not received permission from the Courts to do so? Perhaps if this law is tepidly enforced the Courts will not &#8220;strike&#8221; it. </p>

<p>All the things the supporters say are obviously trure, but all of this legislation may be rendered ineffective in the future. With one stroke of a pen, the next president of the US is likely to LEGALIZE MILLIONS who are now considered illegal. When everyone is made legal through a mass amnesty program, it will not matter if we have laws to protect us from the illegal invasion. By then it will be a de facto LEGAL INVASION.</p>
<p>The same goes for border fences, virtual fences or lack of them. They will no longer matter when 20 million are made legal, and are allowed to bring in their relatives.</p>

<p>Posted by Flamethrower at 8:16 PM on March 3 &#8220;</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>If you look at Mexicans as people, you will understand much better than if you view Mexicans as animals.</p>
<p>Our Marxist friends, who view everybody as animals, are depending on the whole immigrant argument being framed by the term, &#8220;illegal immigrant&#8221;.</p>
<p>Looking at these aboriginal people as humans paints a different picture.</p>
<p>The view we get is of millions of Mexicans invading America with thoughts of conquest on their minds.<br/>
But please explain to me why millions of self sufficient people who have put down roots in their communities, buried loved ones, and lived lives as sovereign individuals would want to leave their whole lives and histories behind and move themselves and their families to the barrios of L.A. where they now work as wage slaves for peanuts, their women are looked upon as conquests for others, and their children are taken away from them and sent to government schools where they must form gangs to protect themselves from rampaging blacks?</p>
<p>Oh yes, and they must pay smugglers to bring them across the border.<br/>
Sure, in any community there are always a few intrepid souls who set out on there own. But millions?</p>
<p>These people are being driven over the border, like the animals our elites consider them to be. And us.</p>
<p>There is no profit to be made on a self reliant man. Especially in a community of other men just like him.</p>
<p>Drive him and his family off of his land into the cities where he becomes a wage earner and you have a dependent man.</p>
<p>He must utilize the monetary system to survive.</p>
<p>A word to the wise&hellip;</p>
<p>When you find yourself being emotionally driven to take sides in a conflict, please step back for a minute, view your so-called enemy as a human like yourself, and ask the question,&#8221;cui bono?&#8221;</p>
<p>Who benefits from this conflict?</p>
<p>So&hellip;do you really think that any major employer in Indiana would be shut down if the state &#8220;employment Nazis&#8221; found an illegal person working for them?</p>
<p>I doubt it.<br/>
They will crack down on small &#8220;mom and pop&#8221; type firms. Gets rid of competition for the big guys you see. Also makes the mob think that their legislators somehow care about them.</p>
<p>Oh look!!! How brave they all are!!!  They voted for an anti-illegal bill!!! Our congressmen are real stand-up-fellows!!!</p>
<p>Must be an election year.</p>
<p>Oh, and I almost forgot, if you are a Christian who sees all people as individuals, each created in the image of a loving God, there can be no illegal human.<br/>
Drop this argument. It is a trap set by the Leftist press to make you look like a hypocrite.</p>

			<p>The legislation can revoke an employers license if repeatedly hiring and illega alien. Excuse me, legislation??? This is already an existing penalty in present immigration law. In fact, every one of these laws being written or proposed, in State after State are superflous. We are losing sight of the fact that much of this is just playing politics, especially when the &#8220;new&#8221; laws are not being enforced. How many Mexican embassies do we have in the nation now? You see the administrations plan??</p>

			<p>In support of my post on 11:50PM on March 4, a story just came out that Utah&rsquo;s really tough illegal immigration bill turns out to have weak points and will not go into effect until, GET THIS, 2009. As I said, you can see the administrations plan, can&rsquo;t you? How many illegal aliens are in the nation now? How many Mexican embassies? What a farce. Utah is waiting till 2009 to enforce immigration laws that are on the books NOW. I see.</p>

			<p>Too little WAY too late. Its just a holding action till they get one of the presidential amnesty facilatators elected. Our leaders are doing all this wrongheaded multicultural globalony to us. I wish it was real but if it was real they would and should of done it 40 years ago. More salve on gaping wound.</p>
