<p>Seton Hall University School of Law has suspended its &#8220;Partners in Excellence&#8221; minority scholarship program while it considers whether it can make the selection process race-neutral, as federal regulators demand that it be.</p>
<p>The school has also entered an agreement with the U.S. Department of Education&rsquo;s Office of Civil Rights to ensure that an annual job fair, run by local law firms but promoted by the school, is not restricted to minority students.</p>
<p>The actions are the result of a departmental investigation in response to a 2003 complaint that the minority programs are discriminatory. The grievant, David Wilson, a white Brooklyn Law School graduate looking for a job, came across promotions of the job fair and scholarship program online. He reported to the Department of Education that the job fair was exclusively for minority students and that the law school&rsquo;s Partners in Excellence program preferred minority students.</p>

			<p>Ha I just graduated from law school a year ago, and there was nothing but minority career fairs.  Of course to avoid lawsuits all the ads noted that of course they were open to students &#8220;of all backrounds&#8221; (just as long as you can read the miniscule 6 point font at the bottom of the page).  </p>
<p>I feel bad for a lot of the minority sudents though, a lot of them get in over their heads and can&rsquo;t pass the bar exam. It is not a fun situation to be in when you are $150,000 in debt. Hell I can&rsquo;t pay my loans and I past the bar on the first shot and had a job with a firm lined up when I got out.</p>

			<p>If the Democrats get the presidency, such rare enforcement of &#8220;equal protections under the law&#8221; and &#8220;no discrimination based on race&#8221;, to come to a halt, as whites are subjugated to permanent second class citizenship status.</p>

&hellip;<i>as whites are subjugated to permanent second class citizenship status.</i></p>
<p>Whereas now white second class status is only temporary?</p>

			<p>None of this news is in any New Jersey or New York newspaper.  None of this news is on any New Jersey TV or radio news report.</p>
<p>This is why the government wants to shut down the internet and tax it to death.  AR is one of many internet sites that report the truth.</p>

			<p>Way to go!</p>
<p>White men are too timid about standing up for their rights. I realize most racially conscious white folks are skeptical of discrimination suits, but as long as we&rsquo;ve got them, we whites should make use of them. </p>

			<p>I would consider this a victory for our side, but beware the &#8220;race-neutral&#8221; solution.  In many cases, &#8220;race-neutral&#8221; college admissions means that applicants indicate a clue to their racial identity in the essay section, and the admissions staff picks up on the clues, and engages in affirmative action admission decisions.</p>

			<p>Blatant discrimination. One example of it is shut down, but there are millions of others that make Whites second class citizens.</p>

			<p>If a private organization wanted to have a minority only career fair, i would want it allowed. I would not want it to be funded at all from tax dollars.  </p>

<p>Good for him.  I was a coward back when I was in law school.  Now let&rsquo;s see how Seton Hall likes the attention.  Turnaround is fair play.         </p>

You &#8220;past&#8221; the bar, did you?  I passed it too.  Remind me not to hire you until you learn how to spell.</p>
