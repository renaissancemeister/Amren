						<p>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands &mdash; A website where a Dutch legislator was promoting an upcoming film that criticizes the Qur&rsquo;an has been suspended by its U.S. hosting service.</p>
<p>The site had shown Geert Wilders&rsquo; film&rsquo;s title, &#8220;Fitna,&#8221; the words &#8220;Coming Soon&#8221; and an image of a gilded Qur&rsquo;an. Now it shows a note that the company is investigating whether the site violates the firm&rsquo;s terms of service.</p>
<p>Wilders has not described the 15-minute movie, due to be released by March 31, in detail but has said it will underscore his view that Islam&rsquo;s holy book is &#8220;fascist.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wilders said he would release his movie on the Internet after television stations refused to air it.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this situation with the dialogue that&rsquo;s happening throughout the world we&rsquo;ve made the choice to suspend the site as of last night,&#8221; said Susan Wade, spokeswoman for Network Solutions. &#8220;This site is suspended so people can&rsquo;t see the content right now but the customer still has access to their site. They can make whatever changes are necessary as we complete our investigation.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;How many ways are there left for me to be worked against?&#8221; [Wilders] was quoted saying Saturday night by Dutch press agency ANP.</p>
<p>&#8220;If necessary, I&rsquo;ll go hand out DVDs personally on the Dam,&#8221; he said, referring to Amsterdam&rsquo;s central square.</p>

					<p>Reminds me of what happened n 1979 or 1980,  where <span class="caps">PBS </span>was going to air a documentary called &#8220;Death of a Princess&#8221; where a Saudi princess was executed for having dalliances with a Westerner. Saudi Arabia raged, and Exxon (I belive) took out full page ads in several newpapers, pleading with <span class="caps">PBS </span>not to air the presentation. <span class="caps">PBS </span>did so anyway.</p>
<p>Imagine. A multinational oil company, at the behest of a foreign government, trying to decide what Americans were to see on their televisions. I didn&rsquo;t think much of it at the time, but now I realize how frightening it all is, in view of developments of the past few years.</p>
<p>I hope Wilders&rsquo; film gets shown on the Internet. Let the chips fall where they may.   </p>

					<p>It is not a difficult thing to set up a server.  And who is hosting those radical Islamic websites that allow Osama bin Laden and others to pass on information and advertise for Jihadists?</p>

<p>You may be right, Lydia, but these little Northern European countries are overwhelmed with Muslims and are facing real everyday dangers.  Denmark published those cartoons and have republished them - and no one in the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>would touch them!</p>
<p>So while the Dutch may be chickens, we are even bigger chickens. </p>

					<p>Dear Whiteplight&hellip;.yes I agree <span class="caps">OUR MEDIA AND OUR GOVERNMENT </span>are bigger chickens&hellip;but we the people are not&hellip;.maybe those cartoons should be posted here&hellip;but then what good would it do??? We <span class="caps">NEED</span> TO <span class="caps">FIGHT BACK</span> IN <span class="caps">OTHER WAYS&hellip;</span>but again&hellip;the media would never be on our side nor would our own govenment&hellip;we can still keep on speaking out&hellip;but do you ever notice the media calls us ignorant white people.  Maybe if we keep on persisting it would help&hellip;but then the media is on the side of people like obama&hellip;they think hes the best thing since sliced bread.  A <span class="caps">VOTE AGAINST THIS MORON WOULD SEND</span> A <span class="caps">MESSAGE&hellip;WE DON&rsquo;T WANT YOUR KIND</span> IN <span class="caps">OUR LAND</span>!! NO <span class="caps">ONE </span>believes hes a muslim or against us Christians and Jews but he is&hellip;.if he gets elected&hellip;.kiss our country goodbye! Bad enough what we have in washington now&hellip;it would be worse than we could ever imagine!!</p>

					<p>I was constantly harrassed by <span class="caps">AOL </span>about &#8220;terms of service&#8221; violations while I was using <span class="caps">AOL&rsquo;</span>s dialup service, until I became fed up enough with them that I told them I had &#8220;terms of payment,&#8221; they had violated, whereupon I cancelled dialup service and arranged for <span class="caps">DSL </span>from the phone company.</p>
<p>These folks are much more dependant on our money than we are on their service, at least in the <span class="caps">USA</span>; it is a buyer&rsquo;s market here, so don&rsquo;t let them push you around.<br>

					<p>This doesn&rsquo;t surprise me at all. In fact, do you know how many <span class="caps">ISP</span>s claim that &#8220;racist&#8221; behavior is against their terms of service? Most of them. Here&rsquo;s an excerpt from Verizon&rsquo;s policy:</p>
<p><i>Transmission, distribution or storage of any material in violation of any applicable law or regulation is prohibited. This includes, without limitation, material protected by copyright, trademark, trade secret or intellectual property right used without proper authorization, and material that is obscene, defamatory, an illegal threat, discriminatory, racist, or violates export control laws.</i></p>
<p>So now &#8220;racism&#8221; is grouped in with activities that are literally illegal. This is as close as you can get to declaring a &#8220;thought crime.&#8221; I suspect &#8220;criticism of Islam&#8221; will be the next thing added to the list.</p>
