						<p>Thank God for Barack Obama. For until his &#8220;More Perfect Union&#8221; speech last Tuesday, it seems it never occurred to anyone that America needed to talk about race. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Here I&rsquo;d been under the impression that every major university (and minor one for that matter) in the country already had boatloads of courses &mdash; often entire majors &mdash; dedicated to race in America. I&rsquo;d even read somewhere that professors had incorporated racial themes and issues into classes on everything from Shakespeare to the mating habits of snail darters. And scratching faintly in the back of my mind, I felt some vague memory that these same universities recruited black students and other racial minorities, on the grounds that interracial conversations on campus are as important as talking about math, science and literature. A ghost of an image in my mind&rsquo;s eye seemed to reveal African American studies centers, banners for Black History Month and copies of books like &#8220;Race Matters&#8221; and &#8220;The Future of the Race&#8221; lined up on shelves at college bookstores.</p>
<p>Were all of the corporate diversity consultants and racial sensitivity seminars mere apparitions in a dream? Also disappearing in the memory hole, apparently, were the debates that followed Hurricane Katrina, Trent Lott&rsquo;s remarks about Strom Thurmond, the Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Clarence Thomas, the publication of &#8220;The Bell Curve&#8221; and O.J. Simpson&rsquo;s murder trial. Not to mention the ongoing national chatter about affirmative action, racial disparities in prison sentences and racial profiling by law enforcement.</p>
<p>And the thousands of hours of newscasts, television dramas and movies &mdash; remember Oscar-winning films such as 2004&rsquo;s &#8220;Crash?&#8221; &mdash; dedicated to racial issues? It&rsquo;s as if they never existed, vanishing like the image on a TV screen after the plug&rsquo;s been pulled. The New York Times&rsquo; six-week Pulitzer Prize-winning series, &#8220;How Race Is Lived in America&#8221;: just an inkblot?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>No kidding. Janet Murguia is one such especially enthusiastic person. She hoped, according to the Times, that Obama&rsquo;s speech would help &#8220;create a safe space to talk about [race].&#8221;</p>
<p>Who is Janet Murguia? Oh, she&rsquo;s just the president of a group called the National Council of La Raza, which &mdash; despite what they&rsquo;ll tell you &mdash; means &#8220;the race.&#8221; In fact, doesn&rsquo;t it seem like the majority of people begging for a &#8220;new conversation&#8221; on race are the same folks who shout &#8220;racist!&#8221; at anyone who disagrees with them?</p>
<p>This sort of disconnect between rhetoric and reality is the kind of thing one finds in novels by Alexander Solzhenitsyn or Milan Kundera. {snip}</p>
<p>Why do voluptuaries of racial argy-bargy want another such dialogue? For some, it&rsquo;s to avoid actually dealing with unpleasant facts. But for others &mdash; like La Raza or the college professors scrambling to follow Obama&rsquo;s lead &mdash; when they say we need more conversation, they really mean their version of reality should win the day. Substitute &#8220;conversation&#8221; with &#8220;instruction&#8221; and you&rsquo;ll have a better sense of where these people are coming from and where they want their &#8220;dialogue&#8221; to take us.<br>

					<p>There are two parties in a conversation. When certain people are not allowed to talk there is no conversation. Whites are prevented from saying what they want to say by the threat of being called &#8220;racist&#8221;. There is no conversation. If they let us talk, they will hear things they don&rsquo;t want to hear, and have to change their ways.<br>

					<p> My observation is that when the conversation turns to race; the only people allowed to talk are the blacks and hispanics.If a white man opens his mouth with any dissent he&rsquo;s labeled a bigoted racist xenophobic piece of trash and immediately shutdown.<br>
 These groups have had a free ride for decades and it appears there is no end in sight.</p>

					<p>We don&rsquo;t need a conversation about race. It will always be biased in favor of the blacks. (Our government will never stop catering to them.) </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ironic that they think they can act tough to try to scare some whites on the streets. But, when it comes to forming any dialogue to support their side of the argument; they get their feelings hurt by the truth of examples, history, and what can be seen with the naked eye. They won&rsquo;t be open-minded. They&rsquo;ll always have slavery as an excuse to fall back on. They&rsquo;ll always feel held down by the white man.</p>

					<p>We all remember Pres. Clinton&rsquo;s National Diaglogue on Race, don&rsquo;t we?  This is where hand picked, invitation only meetings were held in several states.  Interestingly enough, only blacks, other minorities, and self flagulating white people were invited to these conclaves.  Eventually the whole thing was dismissed as the joke it was, and everyone went home.</p>

					<p>I suppose before this upcoming election is over, whites who don&rsquo;t vote for Obama will be labeled as racist, particularly those who don&rsquo;t agree with the black explanation for black failure.  There is no conversation about race, only indoctrination.  I happen to love my race enough to where I&rsquo;m not going to be a lemming and follow the rest of the milquetoast pasty white liberals over the cliff just to be polite.  Blacks have been in our faces for the last 40 years.  It&rsquo;s about time we stood up and got in theirs and held them accountable for their words, deed, and actions.</p>

I wasn&rsquo;t using foul language, I was just pointing the finger where it needed to be pointed. I am a white nationalist, so it would appear I am not welcome to post here. I will be watching to see if this gets posted, it probably won&rsquo;t. So much for free speech. </p>

Substitute &ldquo;conversation&rdquo; with &ldquo;instruction&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ll have a better sense of where these people are coming from and where they want their &ldquo;dialogue&rdquo; to take us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once this fact is grasped, Liberal arguments lose all steam.  </p>
<p>All their talk of equality and brotherhood is really a code for revenge on and dominance of White (or other successful) people.</p>
<p>If asthetics alone differentiated the races, Whites would still be the most sought after.  In reality, we also think longer and plan better than non-Whites.  It may be comforting to believe that your lower status is accidental.  A couple moments of real competition however, will change your mind.</p>
<p>As long as there is life in my body I will never submit to the demands of overgrown children who pretend to be equal.</p>
<p>You are out gunned, out thought and out planned.  You are ugly even to yourselves.  How&rsquo;s that for opening a &#8220;dialogue&#8221; on race?</p>

&gt; Excellent comment from Schoolteacher!  This goes for every sort of movement.  And so it goes for the white seperatist movement as well.  We must not forget to be healthy in our self criticisms lest we become the liars we abhor.<br><br>

<p>&gt; We ought to be careful about defining people.  If a liberal writes an article that agrees with us, we ought to encourage it rather than attempt to confine them in a box that we define for them.  How else do we expect to gain recruits?  And we need recruits - just look at the handful of habitual posters on Amren and realize how small this community really is&hellip;.</p>

					<p>The media&rsquo;s drumbeat for Obama as a racial healer is profoundly dishonest. Whatever other qualities he has, he severely lacks the ability to propose some kind of discussion on race. We know because at the Democratic convention in 2004, he bandied on about &#8220;acting white,&#8221; never once apologizing for using in public such a hateful term designed to smother our European American diversity.</p>
<p>Then last week it all came tumbling out: &#8220;white resentments&#8221; and &#8220;typical white person.&#8221; At last Obama&rsquo;s mind is revealed   &mdash;   he thinks the diverse white American peoples share only one emotion (&#8220;resentments&#8221;) and have no diversity in thinking, talking, and working&hellip;.we&rsquo;re just &#8220;typical.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is a much stronger indictment of Obama than it appears at first glance. It has been a multicultural rule for the last 20 years that any European American would have serious problems for using &#8220;typical black person&#8221; or &#8220;typical Asian person&#8221; or &#8220;typical Latino person.&#8221; He has to know that the formulation of the coded phrase itself has been characterized as fundamental racism&hellip;so what&rsquo;s with his tin ear, or is it a deeper malaise that wrestles with his soul?</p>

					<p>Goldberg is playing games. As mentioned above, he&rsquo;s first in line to demonize whites. Sure, he&rsquo;ll talk about race, act as if he&rsquo;s being open, and try and work things to blame whites for all problems (unless they&rsquo;re gay or neocons or Jewish or media hucksters) encountered by nonwhites.</p>

					<p>When Blacks want a conversation on race it always turns into a monologue, with them setting the terms of the debate.  They define racism in such a way that they aren&rsquo;t racist due to their lack of power and Whites are racist because they have the power in the hiring process.   Blacks just want to lecture Whites but I won&rsquo;t have my intelligence insulted by their self-imposed limitations because of lack of intelligence and the race card (the king of spades).</p>

					<p>Lou Dobbs is the first person in the media who dared to say let&rsquo;s openly talk about race&hellip;and let the chips fall where they may&hellip;the racist label is used to silence people&hellip;posters on this website of all people should know that by now!</p>

					<p>Following Obama&rsquo;s speech a letter appeared in the main newspaper for Berkeley, CA that spoke in an open manner I&rsquo;ve seen only once or twice before in Berkeley. Here&rsquo;s one sentence from that letter:</p>
<p>&#8220;As long as &ldquo;talking about race in America&rdquo; means nothing but blacks airing their grievances and refusing to allow white people to speak honestly about our experiences, and our grievances, which include anti-white racism, or our concern about blacks such as Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson &ldquo;playing the race card&rdquo; in a manipulative and self-serving fashion, then the &ldquo;dialogue&rdquo; ensuing is little but a biased sermon, is untruthful and is no dialogue at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>I believe this extract shows that Obama has opened up an opportunity for us to be more heard, if we are willing and able to take advantage of it. Something in the way he spoke <span class="caps">DID </span>give permission to whites to speak up  in a more open way in the public forum. (Yes, &#8220;permission&#8221;  &mdash;  that&rsquo;s the sad fact of the matter).</p>
<p>(For anyone who is interested, the rest of the letter is under &#8221; DISINGENUOUS&#8221;, at):</p>

					<p>I&rsquo;ll just keep saying it over and over again; why not?</p>
<p>The Family - the most basic bio-social unit since the Paleolithic, certainly Neolithic Age, is in ruins, and we&rsquo;re talking about Race relations?  As if being a failure in one will automatically make us a success in the other!</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re not just talking about Race, we&rsquo;re obsessing over it. Like an Addict obsessing over an addiction, and for the same reason, ie; the addiction keeps him out of Reality. Our obsession over Race is a manifestation of our aversion toward Reality.  Race is a pretext.  I wasn&rsquo;t impressed as a teenager and I&rsquo;m not now as a man. It is one method more of avoiding reality.  This is the reason why I post here, as I&rsquo;ve said before.  Because of the <span class="caps">REALISM </span>in Race Realism.  I know from a lot of personal experience, whether immediate family, cousins, friends, neighbors, where they have so many family needs that are left unattended but the obsession with Race rages on!</p>

					<p>This &#8220;discussion&#8221; was intended merely to be more of the usual whining by US blacks, but judging from that Berkely Daily Planet letter, the Obamanible Showman&rsquo;s propaganda seems to have backfired on his handlers.</p>
<p>The hype is provoking exactly the sort of discussion Obama&rsquo;s campaign can not afford.</p>

					<p>The only discussion about race is one that I gave at Stirling:</p>
<p>&#8220;Lower your flag. March straight home, stopping at every village along the way and apologize for a hundred years of theft, rape and murder. Do it, and you shall live. Do it not&hellip;&#8221;</p>

					<p>Stop and think about it&hellip;Jesse Jackson hasnt worked a day in his life, he has toured the world, sat in first class stadium seats,front row concert seats,been invited to dozens of resorts for &#8220;workshops&#8221;, had teaching posts, ridden in private jets  all by rehashing the same racial &#8220;conversation&#8221; to the point of nausea. Its a multi million dollar industry for a group of people who couldnt hold down a middle management job<br>
in the real world. Of course they want it to continue forever.</p>

					<p>regarding whiteplight:<br>
&#8220;We ought to be careful about defining people. If a liberal writes an article that agrees with us, we ought to encourage it rather than attempt to confine them in a box that we define for them. How else do we expect to gain recruits? And we need recruits - just look at the handful of habitual posters on Amren and realize how small this community really is&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;   there are probably only a &#8220;handful of habitual <span class="caps">POSTERS</span>&#8221; on <span class="caps">ANY </span>website&hellip; most people who visit a website just read the articles and never post comments.  perhaps mr. taylor might care to place a &#8220;counter&#8221; that shows just how many hits he gets to amren. <br>

					<p>Black people need to stop complaining, get to work, and start cracking the books.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t cut the mustard, you aren&rsquo;t going anywhere in life, and that&rsquo;s true no matter what shade of skin you have.</p>
<p>Somebody needs to verbally toungue lash anyone who continues to promote victimology and downplay the importance of competency.</p>
<p>No more excuses.</p>

					<p><i>I felt some vague memory that these same universities recruited black students and other racial minorities, on the grounds that interracial conversations on campus are as important as talking about math, science and literature.</i></p>
<p>My history course my freshman year in college had one black and 2 or 3 Muslims in it. I can assure you that their presence did not encourage healthy - and certainly not honest - discourse about Islam, race, or anything else. In fact they hardly said anything at all, while most of the whites were unwilling to offend anyone. I broached the subjects in my usual bold ways, but that was rare.</p>
<p>It seems the more &#8220;diverse&#8221; a society or school gets the less willing it is to broach topics honestly. After all, books can be read and guest speakers can be brought in to present alternate views, but guest speakers leave and books don&rsquo;t get offended. Can&rsquo;t say that for other students.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of Barack Obama&rsquo;s call for a racial dialogue has any mainstream media writer once mentioned IQ?</p>
<p>Like I said&hellip;</p>

					<p>If you feel the system has been hurting you, well it has but it has more to do with who we keep sending to represent us than the party they belong to.</p>
<p>I am trying to understand why few posts take note of the polite and under the radar corruption in this country examples such as lobbyist favors and special health insurance for congress extending to the quiet organized crime control of 75% of the construction industry.</p>
<p>We may not be able to take on organized crime without much bloodshed but we can do something about elected officials. If you have an income inadequate to provide basic support or no reliable access to health care, then you are part of the millions of Americans of many races who should be the number one domestic policy of our elected representatives. </p>
<p>Instead, a very large block of Senators considers extending for another year an originally temporary tax break on high incomes and would not override a Presidential veto to give all US children access to health care.  </p>
<p>I am a white male fortunate to have a middle class income and the free time to do many community things that are not as a means of helping my family.  I am probably somewhat socially conservative and expect all who are able to work and to give a goal oriented life a chance. But life can be hard and many feel there is no one who cares about them and here we have a congress favoring the wealthy and spurning children.</p>
<p>Believe me after never having voted for a victorious president beginning with my first election in 1972, I grow more convinced all the time how much we need to change the good ol boy way of making decisions that affect you and your family.  Very sad to use good ol boy in a nasty way and I apologize.</p>
<p>What can we do?  First, think about who is going to take the risk to cause a peaceful revolution in this country that puts people ahead of corporations and political favors. On a personal basis we can spend more of our at home time and youth activity time bonding with our kids about how to make their local community a better place.  Then as they grow older they will spend the time to demand accountability of those who are going to represent them in Washington.</p>
<p>Thank you for thinking about these comments.</p>

<p>Yes, and even if I&rsquo;m talking alone with my white next-door neighbor who agrees with my views to a great extent, he still gets uncomfortable if I mention anything racial.</p>
<p>I forget the name of the study that showed that as diversity increases, trust decreases even between members of the same racial group.</p>
