<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Gringos here in Mexico talk endlessly about how they love and admire the Mexican people, how friendly the natives are, how wonderful the culture is and, by strong implication, how wonderful the gringos are for appreciating Mexico. Actually they don&rsquo;t. They live in gated communities in the hills, can&rsquo;t speak three words of Spanish, and have surprisingly little contact with the country. They have invented a Mexico that doesn&rsquo;t exist, and have fallen in love with it.</p>
<p>Thus many of their ideas about Mexicans are wrong, compounded equally of ideology and wishful thinking. The same happens in America. This will one day give birth to surprising children.</p>
<p>The truth is that Mexicans are about like people the world over, which means that regarding them with syrupy condescension as fuzzy heartwarming Pedros and Marias is a mistake. They don&rsquo;t much like Americans, regarding them as arrogant and rich. The distaste is no more than distaste: they do not dream of lynching Yanquis. Nonetheless, regarding Mexico as a nation of smiling maids and obedient gardeners overlooks a somewhat darker picture. They would not be quite so smiling and obedient if they had a better economic choice.</p>
<p>An interesting observation: In five years I have encountered no hostility from Mexicans who have always lived in Mexico. The five or six men who were aggressively hostile all spoke barrio English. They had spent time in the US. Think about it.</p>
<p>The US would be well advised to take certain realities into account when it ponders today&rsquo;s unrestricted immigration. Those who favor immigration tend to hold an idealized view of the newcomers. They are so-o-o-o hardworking! Yes, in the first generation. They just want a better life! So they do. They are just like Italian and Polish immigrants of the last century. No, they are not. They are Mexicans.</p>
<p>Mexico is a third-world country &mdash; yes, an upper third-world Latin American country, functioning reasonably well, and not Haiti or Bangladesh. It&rsquo;s a nice place to live, which is why a half million North Americans are here. Yet Mexico is very, very different from America. If America and England are a few inches apart, Americans and France a few more, Mexico is several feet off in the distance.</p>
<p>While gringos and Mexicans live next to each other here in amity, they do not mix. They can&rsquo;t. A retired executive from Boeing has nothing in common with a man with a fourth-grade education who will never read a book in his life. Pepe is smiling and amiable while working in the garden. He is also a grown man, not a teddy bear. If the retired engineer met Pepe in Pepe&rsquo;s favorite bar, the engineer might come to a very different understanding of Pepe.</p>
<p>It is one thing to have Mexicans in America while they still fearful of being deported. They are polite and brown and eager to work. This encourages the tendency to which Americans are prone, to patronize them as just the nicest babysitters and garbage men. Why, they are almost like real people.</p>
<p>It will be a different thing when they are legal and have a voting majority in the Southwest. They understand perfectly that their day is coming. A couple of years back I listened on the radio to a Mexican-American politician from Texas. He pointed out that when the Mexican children now in school reach the age of eighteen, they will control the government of the state. He was not hostile, did not say as Barack Obama&rsquo;s minister did, &#8220;God damn America.&#8221; Yet he saw what was coming, and was well pleased. From the Mexican point of view, they are getting back states which rightly belong to them.</p>
<p>They assuredly are. Shortly the US will have a southern tier of states under Mexican-American control.</p>
<p>The hopeful idea is that they will meld as did the Irish and Italians and Vietnamese. The flaw in this happy ointment is that they do very poorly in school &mdash; better than blacks, but well below whites and Asians. This is not a problem of the first generation only, in which case it might eventually cure itself, but of later generations also. It looks innate, or at least as if it will continue. Then what?</p>
<p>Then they will have no choice but to be waiters and garbage collectors. The first generation will tolerate it, happy to be making what seems to them good money. A few will succeed and move up. Most won&rsquo;t. The second generation, relegated forever to jobs of low pay and less esteem, will become resentful. Inevitably they will see the relegation as indicating discrimination, not incapacity. The young, unable to compete, will gravitate toward others who can&rsquo;t and we will have another permanent underclass. If you don&rsquo;t believe me, watch.</p>
<p>The United States advertises itself as a land of opportunity, and in fact is, but only for the bright. A poor kid who pops 1500 on his SATs can get into a good university and come out as anything he chooses. Universities look for such students. A kid who barely reads has no chance. For him, there are no opportunities.</p>
<p>Why is it unlikely that the immigrants will improve scholastically? For reasons a fair few understand but nobody talks about. Intelligence. Mexico consists of three layers, or maybe two layers with a spectrum between. The governing class is white, and at about the European level on IQ tests, not surprising because they are European. You have the mestizos, who do conspicuously less well, and the pure Indians, lower yet. The white upper class is not swimming the river.</p>
<p>IQ is a forbidden topic, but it tracks reality depressingly well. No country below Laredo has ever produced anything important in the sciences. And while in any group there are exceptions, it is the majority who determine social results. This bears thinking about. Reality does not respect politics. Holding one&rsquo;s breath and turning blue will change nothing. Insisting that something can&rsquo;t be so or shouldn&rsquo;t be so doesn&rsquo;t change whether it is so.</p>
<p>Inequality can be seen in the streets here. In Guadalajara, una ciudad muy guera, a very white city, you have highly sophisticated people who talk of the arts on the radio as intelligently as any in America. They go to the opera, buy in good bookstores, and serve competently as doctors and technicians. In the villages you find people with far more Indian blood and almost no academic achievement or interest. Out in the hills there is, dead serious, a lot of witchcraft.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a different world. And coming to a mall near you.<br>

					<p>Yep. I&rsquo;ve been saying this for a long time. When their kids grow into adults, they&rsquo;re not going to make it here and they&rsquo;ll be &#8220;Americanized&#8221; enough to turn their noses up at whatever it is their parents do. Like Mr. Reed says, their going to resent being relegated to the low end of the ladder because of their inability to make it in a first world society. They&rsquo;re not going to admit it&rsquo;s their own lack of intelligence. Then watch out.</p>

					<p>Thanks for publishing this article.  One of many several points that jumped out at me was the fact that the reason why Mexicans seem so nice and hardworking is because of their fear of being deported.</p>
<p>This fear fades every day that their numbers grow in America.</p>

					<p>Fred Reed: you are a genius.Mexicans smile in our face when they are working for us and when they know that we have the upper hand, but when they achieve numerical superiority,and they are just counting the minutes until that happens,then they will treat us like dirt, the same way they are to us in Mexico.And a large part of the reason for this is the white race traitors among our ranks.</p>

					<p>My briefer impressions of Mexico are the same as Fred&rsquo;s more experienced observations. And even the Mexicans I knew whom I considered intelligent had mental processes very different from my own. When I would mention this to americanos in Mexico who had lived closely among Mexicans (not in gated communities) for a long time, they would laugh, as if to say, of course, what could be more obvious  &mdash;  and then they would elaborate on the theme in ways I&rsquo;ve tried to post here before, but which are evidently too plain-spoken to be posted.</p>
<p>Like Fred, I like Mexico  &mdash;  there&rsquo;s a magic there. But I do <span class="caps">NOT </span>want large numbers of Mexicans living in the United States. They will <span class="caps">NOT </span>assimilate our outlooks and abilities, any more than blacks have.</p>
<p>Fred writes, &#8220;In five years I have encountered no hostility from Mexicans who have always lived in Mexico. The five or six men who were aggressively hostile all spoke barrio English. They had spent time in the <span class="caps">US.</span> Think about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a recent conversation with a mexicana raised in the village I spent time in last summer, I mentioned to her that everyone in the village was unfailingly courteous and very friendly toward me, except that I noticed among the very younger teens a sort of alienated, almost hostile attitude in their demeanor that reminded me of the same attitude seen in much of the same age group here in the States.</p>
<p>She affirmed my guess that that was a change from the way the village had been decades ago, and she said it was primarily due to the influence of older youth who returned to the village from the United States. That since those mexican youths working in the United States were no longer enmeshed in the web of family and village life, they weren&rsquo;t inhibited from getting into activities like drugs that they would have thought twice about if still in the village and conscious of the possibility of shaming and causing pain to their parents.</p>
<p>I know of two cases and suspect there are many, many more of young men from that village that did get involved with selling drugs in the <span class="caps">U.S </span>and ended up in prison here, with long sentences, causing much pain to their parents of course.</p>
<p>I like all the people I met there and have trouble thinking about all this objectively  &mdash;  I&rsquo;ll leave that to someone else.</p>

					<p>  It is the lack of any interest in academics and learning which should have long ago caught the attention of everyone. Even if there is ability, there is little indication other than liberal wishfulness of ability, with no interest or effort a modern society cannot exist.<br>
  The fawning Obama crowd and others pro-open immigration groups refuse to see and that makes me wonder about their own ability to understand the harsh realities of the world. <br><br>
  But yesterday on a college campus a woman wearing an Obama button asked me to doante to Obama.  When I said no she said, &#8220;You must think too much. You need to let your heart feel the movement.&#8221;<br><br>
  Why should any nation admit people who are going to be a burden to the existing citizens ?<br><br>

					<p>That last line is dead on and incredibly uncanny. I was at my local mall yesterday with my Korean buddy, David. We were in the food court when I had a <span class="caps">EUREKA </span>moment. I noticed that all the cleaning staff was brown. The women were nearly identically short, brown with their black hair tied back in an identical manner. The men were nearly identically short and brown. I almost choked on my soda  when I realized that these people are a modern day Bokanovsky Group. My friend asked me what was wrong and I sputtered out, &#8220;We are living in the Brave New World! It&rsquo;s here!&#8221; <br>

					<p> This is the second person I have read for years that lives in Mexico and is constantly trying to warn America about the dangers of unchecked illegal immigration; the other is Alan Wall. Both men are American and are well educated. <br>
 Yet our Federal Government is determined to continue down this path to our ultimate destruction.</p>

					<p>If today in Mexico, the people of Indian ancestry are the least intelligent, least educated, least successful, and most impoverished, how is it that in pre-Columbus Central America, Indians were able to build advanced,sophisticated great civilizations such as the Mayas, the Toltecs, and the Aztecs?</p>
<p>It is amazing that in pre-Columbus Central America the Mayas, the Toltecs, and the Aztecs, and the Incas in pre-Columbus South America, could build such advanced civilizations, considering that they had no horses and no wheels!</p>
<p>Without these civilizations that the Spanish conquered, we would not have tomatoes,corn,chocolate,bell peppers,chili peppers, potatoes,pumpkins,pineapples, most kinds of beans, and probably other New World plants that I have not mentioned.</p>
<p>To everyone reading this post, did you see the Mel Gibson movie &#8220;Apocalypto&#8221;?  It may very well have contained historical inaccuracies, but it was still a good movie.</p>
<p>The civilizations I mention in this post were very violent and brutal, but very advanced and sophisticated for the pre-Columbus New World.  But then again so were white European civilizations like ancient Rome and Medievel Europe.</p>
<p>Today, I think that English absolutely should be our official, national lanquage.  If you want to legally immigrate to the United States of America. learn to speak English and become a American!</p>

					<p><span class="caps">U.S. </span>politicans have this same idealistic view. They are gated away from any form of reality that we must live in. </p>
<p>In the summer of 2000, I went to a &#8216;school&rsquo; in Cuernavaca, Mexico for two college credits for one month. During the time that another student and I stayed with a Mexican host family, </p>
<p>1) an 18-year old girl from our group was raped by a cab driver who held a knife to her throat. (I was only 23, but I had already learned that you can&rsquo;t get sloppy drunk in any town anywhere.) There was nothing to be done because their &#8216;police force&rsquo; is corrupt with former criminals. </p>
<p>2)The house we were staying in was broken into while we were, thankfully, in the pool. (I guess the hoodlums had been scoping out our daily routine all week and knew that we would be the only two there.) The neighborhood was a mixture of nice looking, well kept &#8216;townhomes&rsquo; next to poverty-stricken structures. The father of our host family worked in Mexico City during the week and returned on the weekends. </p>
<p>3)Some cracked-out guy jumped on a bus that some of our students were on and held up the driver with a gun. </p>
<p>4)several times some decent looking men (not what I normally think of as Hispanic) hit on no one but the one black girl that was with out group.</p>
<p>Mexico-what a &#8216;wonderful culture&rsquo;.</p>
<p>(Aside: You don&rsquo;t need to know Spanish in Mexico. The Hispanics in the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>know enough English. Don&rsquo;t let them fool you. They know the game all too well. I learned this from working in a convenience store. I didn&rsquo;t need to go to Mexico.)</p>

					<p>People mistakenly conflate the population of Mexican immigrants with the population of Mexico. Mexico has many Europeans, not just Spanish or Portuguese. Also French and Italians, even a few Germans, Jews, Christian Lebanese and Syrian Arabs, Polish, English, Scottish etc.</p>

					<p>Ross,</p>
<p>Their civilizations weren&rsquo;t as advanced as you are making them out to be.  I can&rsquo;t believe you even placed Rome and other European civilizations in the same paragraph in the manner that you did, as those other ones.  There is no comparison.  Science and medicine, to me, are a little more important than chocolate and peppers.  You are kidding right?  Those pre-Colombian civilizations that you are making a big deal about were probably just as advanced as those civilizations in Southeast Asia and Indonesia of which we only have those ruins left from now.  Rome is in ruins now as well, but it has left such a larger, greater legacy on the world.  Again, you have got to be kidding me.</p>

<p>The Aztecs and the Mayans were the only advanced civilizations in the area. They lorded over many smaller, weaker, and less intelligent Indian tribes, whom they bullied and got paid in tribute and captives for blood sacrifice. It was these lesser tribes that helped Cortez in his conquest of the Aztecs. It is the descendents of these lesser tribes that exist today, not the Aztecs, at least the ones who built the advanced civilization, most of whom if not killed by the Spaniards, were wiped out by smallpox.  </p>

					<p>The Mexican population in the United States is a ticking time-bomb. Mexico has never reconciled itself to the loss of the southwest (or northwest from Mexico&rsquo;s viewpoint). Mexico is emotionally and culturally hostile to America, blaming it for its own problems. The day may well come when Serbs in Kosovo have the last laugh on Americans for their uncalled for interference in their country. At least Kosovo was never part of Albania. What goes around,,,, well you know the rest.</p>

<p>What???  So the fact that the author pointed out the reality of many expatriates in Mexico makes the article pathetic?  I&rsquo;m not sure I understand your reasoning.  I, for one, thought the article was excellent.  Mexico is a complicated nation that we as Americans need to understand.  I&rsquo;m glad there are people out there like Fred Reed who have first hand knowledge of Mexico and aren&rsquo;t afraid to tell it like it is.  I found the article very entertaining and enlightening.</p>

It should be required reading for all of the &#8220;conservatives&#8221; like Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham who correctly rail against illegal immigration but then in the next breath make sure they assert how much they champion legal immigration. This sobering article should be read alongside Roy Beck&rsquo;s &#8220;Gumballs&#8221; video on the perils we face due to the massive number of legal immigrants who are flooding into the <span class="caps">USA.</span> Please type &#8220;ROY <span class="caps">BECK GUMBALLS</span>&#8221; in the search engine to see the video.</p>

					<p>&ldquo;The second generation, relegated forever to jobs of low pay and less esteem, will become resentful. Inevitably they will see the relegation as indicating discrimination, not incapacity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Interestingly Mr. Reed, this is always going to be the case with humans of any race. One of the more commonsense (sort of &ldquo;aha&rdquo;) findings in social psychological research, is what is called the Fundamental Attribution Error. The principle is simple, it is the fact that I will attribute my own negatives or failures to environmental influences, but will attribute yours to internal or intrinsic factors. Thus, I spit on the sidewalk because I have a bad taste in my mouth from a poor lunch, or have a cold inflicted upon me; however, you do it because you are an &ldquo;uncouth oaf.&rdquo;   Overcoming this rather universal &ldquo;thinking error,&rdquo; simply requires the capacities for both introspection and empathy.</p>
<p>However, these are qualities that are sincerely lacking in the both the nonwhite Third World&lsquo;s minions, and the cloistered existence of the lily white Western elites.</p>
<p>For both these groups, the Fundamental Attribution Error reverses so that only external factors such as &ldquo;institutional racism&rdquo; or &ldquo;white privilege,&rdquo; explain away all nonwhite shortcomings in the face of white middle and working class achievements in relation to them. The incapacity (as you so well put it) of nonwhites is never considered by either group, since for nonwhites it would require painful introspection regarding mental ability and for the white elites, an even more excruciating empathy for the whites they smugly feed off of and hypocritically look down upon. </p>
<p>Thus, the future problem of sustaining the multicultural &ldquo;ideal,&rdquo; once whites fall below 50% of the US population, or possibly even before that &ldquo;eventuality?&rdquo; Add to that equation such &ldquo;naturally&rdquo; occurring phenomena as global outsourcing and dollar devaluation, and the precariously Weimar-like instability of this forced racial utopianism becomes all the more ominous to contemplate. </p>
<p>Or put another way, sooner or later, the head and tail will find that they cannot wag the rest of the dog when the backbone stiffens with resolution!<br>

					<p>Fred has more experience on this than me, but I disagree with the &#8216;IQ&rsquo; conclusion. I could accept say a natural IQ difference of maybe 5 points between an average Mexican and an average white American, I have a hard time agreeing that every race in the world that&rsquo;s not white is automatically 15 IQ points lower than whites, many of whom look whiter than whites. Oh - except for Asians. In fact, many Mexicans appear more Asian than anything else. I think the lower <span class="caps">IQ&rsquo;</span>s results are more a chronicle of their own deep seated love affair with ignorant, backward, and racist behavior and thinking, than they are of innate ability. They will &#8216;reconquista&rsquo;. Racism beats it&rsquo;s opposite every time. Every single day.   </p>

					<p>Ross, above.</p>
<p>The history of the Aztec, Inca and Mayans states that on <span class="caps">THREE </span>different occassions, white men with beards and blonde hair came from the east in &#8220;long boats&#8221;. This has been known for centuries but the data is not PC anymore. There are numerous pictures on the walls of tombs and temples of these white men and even pictorials of battles between various Indian tribes and these white men.</p>
<p>These Indian histories also make it clear they were taught how to build, etc, by these white men with yellow hair and beards. The knowledge the Indians have came from Europeans. </p>
<p>The Inca history goes on to explain that these whites also set sail to the west on boats and rafts when a native chief started a war with the whites. The legend/history picks up at Easter Island where the history clearly states the Islands were setteled by white skinned people from the East (Peru, Incas again). That is why the statues on Easter Island all face east and have those <span class="caps">RED </span>stones on top. It is to signify the red hair that some of the original Easter Island settlers had.</p>
<p>The whites then went further west and settled nuerous Islands.</p>
<p>An additional point Mr Fred Reed forgot. When these 18 year olds grow up, as citizens, not only can they vote, but they can now bring in their entire extended families and make them legal. We are talking mom, pop, brothers and sister (with their spouses and kids). Each 18 year old can now add about 6 more to our wonderful diverse &#8220;nation&#8221;. And, they will hate us since we are white.</p>
<p>As for the nice behaviour of the illegals? This is why companies want the <span class="caps">ILLEGALS </span>and not the legal workers. Once this crop is legalized, more illegals will come in and be hired first since it is the &#8220;illegal&#8221; part that makes them so valuable. Not only do they &#8220;bahave&#8221; but you can save so much money of paying them in cash and avoiding all the taxes a business must pay. It is a great deal.</p>

					<p>This article really sums it all up perfectly. I just wish articles like this could make it into the main stream media for all to see. I would also like to point out to those of you who doubt the accuracy of the above article that we already have a situation with blacks that is very much like the one predicted in the above article. The authors observation that it is the group that determines social results it starkly exhibited in black societies throughout the world, including our own. While there are some very intelligent blacks, Thomas Sowell and Walters Williams come immediately to mind, as a group they are far below whites and asians in their intellectual capabilities. <br>
It is interesting that the same people who brought slavery to this country ( agribusiness ) are the main offenders when it comes to illegal immigration and lobbying for more illegal workers from Mexico. </p>
<p>I predict that there will be another civil war in this country and that the country will break apart into several smaller nations based on race, ethnicity and language. Most of the Southwest will probably end up re-uniting with Mexico. </p>

					<p>Fred points to a common problem with peasant immigrants to America from everywhere except Northern Europe.  This is not unique to Mexicans. It is important to understand our past so we can see our future.</p>
<p>The reality is that hardworking Irish, Jewish and Italian immigrants birthed a generation of crooks.  Sullen children of immigrants determined to have it all through crime are a part of our history.  Witness Bugsy Siegel, Al Capone, the Jewish &#8220;Purple Gang&#8221; in Ohio, the Mafia and countless other immigrant criminals that terrorized cities and towns across America. It happened before and it is happening again.<br>
  <br><br>
And before you now-assimilated Irish, Italians, Jews (and unassimilated Muslims and Mexicans) start whining, I really don&rsquo;t care that the majority of you are (or were) law-abiding.  That is not the point. It takes way, way, more than a mere law-abiding majority to sustain a first world culture. Can a free culture survive in which 1 out of 2 are stone killers?  1 out of 50?  1 out of 1000? I don&rsquo;t think so.  </p>
<p>In small towns across this country there are people who stil don&rsquo;t lock their doors.  In New York City I used three locks and had bars on all my windows. And that, my friends, is the continuing legacy of immigration in New York City. </p>
<p>The reality is that even an extremely tiny minority of violent criminals is enough to totally disrupt a civilized society.  Now we face the same problem all over again with Mexicans and Muslims: sullen criminal children &hellip; and grandchildren &hellip; and (God help us) great-grandchildren. And the apologists are making all the same old Irish, Italian and Jewish anti-defamation league arguments: &#8220;most of us are <span class="caps">NOT </span>criminals!&#8221; To which I answer, &#8220;so what?&#8221;</p>
<p>Smarter immigrants were able to make more money legit and did not continue as street thugs. Jewish immigrants and their kids got out of organized crime in large numbers by the 1940s and sold their &#8220;rackets&#8221; to the Mafia when they went straight.  Italians stayed in the organized crime business longer   &mdash;   perhaps because it always was (and still is) a major part of their culture back home. There is a reason they call it &#8220;The Sopranos&#8221; and not &#8220;The Leibowitz&rsquo;s&#8221;.</p>
<p>The dumber the immigrant group, the longer they will stay criminals and leeches, which is what is happening now in America.  Mexicans are dumber than Italians and way dumber than Jews.  Given the statistics that show Mexican failure to assimilate at anywhere near the Italian and Jewish rates (Mexicans are way dumb unto the third generation), it could take us well over a hundred years  before we have them civilized and they actually provide a net benefit to this country.</p>
<p>As Fred notes and as America&rsquo;s immigrant crime history proves,  living in America seems to radically raise the expectations of ignorant minority peasants, but not their talents or abilities.</p>

					<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;The white upper class of Mexico is not swimming the river</p>
<p>But really, while more charitable, the article supports MY contention perfectly. When enough Mexicans have invaded the Southwest, those states <span class="caps">WILL </span>effectively belong to Mexico and <span class="caps">NOT </span>the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> Our politicians stupidly <span class="caps">PERMITTING </span>this to happen.</p>
<p>Once our southern states are effectively under Mexican-American government, they will eat up more taxpayer money than Bush&rsquo;s misguided wars! That the Mexicans know how to work the system is reflected by the vast amount of tax dollars needed to prop them up   &mdash;   to provide welfare supplements, rental subsidies and free healthcare. Then there&rsquo;s the additional costs of schooling. Texas taxpayers are forced to pay for school after school being built to absorb the hordes of illegal immigrants bringing their large families.<br>
 <br><br>
With the commensurate drop in the quality of education   &mdash;   <span class="caps">WHITE PUPILS </span>get short-changed if their parents can&rsquo;t afford the high cost of private schools. Forget the nonsense of standard achievement tests   &mdash;   Houston public schools put more focus on teaching kids <span class="caps">HOW</span> TO <span class="caps">TAKE TESTS </span>than providing them with the tools (education) to score well on the tests!!!</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">ONLY </span>practical solution   &mdash;   which our politicians are to gutless to implement   &mdash;   is to <span class="caps">DEPORT ALL ILLEGALS</span>! Then develop a guest worker program which addresses the need of labor, limits the stay   &mdash;   and specifies <span class="caps">WHERE AND</span> AT <span class="caps">WHAT JOBS </span>the &#8220;guest worker&#8221; is allowed to work. With both verification and enforcement provisions designed into the program!</p>
<p>We constantly get the propaganda pitch from business and corporate leaders   &mdash;   as per today&rsquo;s Houston Chronicle article   &mdash;   falsely claiming losses of ten to fifteen percent of the workforce if we deport illegal labor! SO <span class="caps">LET&rsquo;S ACCEPT LOSS</span> OF <span class="caps">SOME</span> OF <span class="caps">OUR WORKERS</span>! Better controlled growth forcing the corporate and business entities to <span class="caps">HIRE AMERICAN </span>  &mdash;   than destroying such a huge portion of our country as we are stupidly doing in pursuit of profits!</p>
<p>Ultimately our Southwest <span class="caps">WILL </span>resemble Mexico   &mdash;   an aristocracy of White and the more intelligent Mexicans controlling the economy and wealth, serving in government and professional careers. While the greatest part of the population will be those blank-faced mestizos still capable of little more than manual labor. Despite the reality these are the children and grand-children of today&rsquo;s illegal immigrants!<br>

					<p>LHathaway, your post doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.  Nobody is saying that every nonwhite race is 15 IQ points below whites.  There is a hierarchy.  Aborigines are about 40 points below us.  Blacks in Africa are about 30 points below us.  Indians in India (as a whole) are about 20 points below us.  Most Middle Easterners, Amerindians, Pacific Islanders and Southeast Asians are about 15 points below us.  Some groups in the Middle East, some Southeast Asians, and most Arctic peoples such as Eskimos, are 10 points below us.  East Asians (Japanese, Korean and Chinese) are about 5 points <span class="caps">ABOVE </span>us.  These are the overall findings that have been found from numerous reliable studies.  Accept it for what it is.</p>
<p>And what are you talking about when you say there are some nonwhites who are whiter than whites?  How does that have anything to do with IQ?  Seriously, your entire post had me lost.   And Mexicans sure don&rsquo;t act like they are only 5 points below us.  Where are you getting this stuff?</p>

					<p>Sorry Fred. You&rsquo;re wrong. In El Paso, for example, Mexican-Americans fill all levels of society: From waitresses and maids, to doctors and leaders of the community. El Paso is <span class="caps">OVERWHELMINGLY</span> Mexican-American. And it is a vibrant community. It is consistently one of the <span class="caps">SAFEST U.S. </span>cities its size (www.city-data.com). Non-Hispanic retirees live here too. They come here because it is a desirable place to live. <br>
If you go to New Mexico, you&rsquo;ll see Hispanics filling a large proportion of the high-tech engineering positions at the National Labs.<br><br>
&#8220;If the retired engineer met Pepe in Pepe&rsquo;s favorite bar, the engineer might come to a very different understanding of Pepe.&#8221;<br><br>

<p>Hispanics in the US have an IQ about 10 pts below US Whites, but it&rsquo;s a really variable group. &#8220;White&#8221; Hispanics in US may have IQ about 3 pts below US Whites.</p>

					<p>Big Bill,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t come across many people who acknowledge that certain immigrant groups from Europe, especially non-WASP groups (excluding the Irish in my opinion), might not have contributed to America&rsquo;s greatness as much as we give them credit for.  That&rsquo;s not to put down their contributions as a group, but I think certain aspects of their culture allow for individuals, even if a minority, to have a sense of morality that has proven alien and dangerous for America.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about just criminal behavior, but the entire value system that nations are built on.  One example is the tendency of Jews and Sicilians to be more &#8220;clannish&#8221; than other early immigrant groups.  Why is this bad?  Because they act to benefit their own group and not the country as a whole.  Jews will usually pull up Jews before Gentiles.  Should it surprise us that they are overrepresented in certain industries like the media?  Or when Santino bashes Michael for joining the army to &#8220;die for strangers&#8221; in Godfather I?  Historically, other groups have done the same, but the more &#8220;clannish&#8221; and culturally distinct, the more intent they are on preserving their identity.  To their credit, Italians have assimilated much better, but the long-lasting effects of the mafia, for instance, are complex and a testament to the majority group being able to control it. </p>
<p>And what happens when the assimilation process goes awry?  When people, the more culturally distinct they are from the host society, come out a little screwy?  I found a great article on the web from Jewish Quarterly about the preponderance of Jews in the porn industry.  Apparently they like their shiksas.  And who hasn&rsquo;t dealt with a <span class="caps">JAP</span>?  Like I said, the long-lasting effects of culturally distinct peoples immigrating here is extremely complex and will have implications for generations to come.  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe America&rsquo;s deterioration just began.  I believe its been going on for some time.  Sure we&rsquo;re a superpower, but that&rsquo;s because it took two massive wars for Europe to destroy itself and it rebuilt itself <span class="caps">TWICE. </span> Think of how much stronger we could have been.  And yes, these groups have done good for us too.  They have fought and died in wars and, Jews especially, have contributed to the academic discourse that has made this country great.  But like Bill said, all it takes is a minority.  And from this article, it seems that the majority and not the minority of Hispanics will pose a problem for us very soon.     </p>
<p>A sidenote: I don&rsquo;t put the Irish in the same pot as the Italian and Jewish groups, even with the early involvement of many in criminal activities, because I understand that criminality can be a function of many things and not just culture, notably socioeconomic well-being.  They didn&rsquo;t exhibit clannish tendencies or alien ideas upon arrival and assimilated almost immediately.  Many enlisted to fight and die in the Civil War almost as soon as they set foot off the boat.  Pretty amazing if you ask me.        </p>

					<p><i>It is amazing that in pre-Columbus Central America the Mayas, the Toltecs, and the Aztecs, and the Incas in pre-Columbus South America, could build such advanced civilizations, considering that they had no horses and no wheels!</i></p>
<p>Imagine how much easier for them it would have been if they had wheels. And I&rsquo;m sure that they could have used bovine animals as beasts of burden. And despite all of that they were wiped out in less than year (if my knowledge of history is correct). An earlier comment stated that, unlike European, Middle Eastern and Asian civilisations, the Mayan,Aztecs and Inca left no legacy. I don&rsquo;t that modern philosophy, science and literature have been influenced one bit by these people. Which means that the world would be the way it is now regardless of whether they existed or not.</p>

<p>Mexicans stole everything that wasn&rsquo;t nailed down on our patio. Spanish was a required class in our school in order to keep the Mexicans from flunking out.

					<p>Robert Lindsay,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where you are getting this stuff from.  I have one of Rushton&rsquo;s best books on this topic, and I am going by his averages.</p>
<p>Vietnamese people DO <span class="caps">NOT </span>have the same IQ as American whites do overall.  In fact, after looking at their country, it is insulting that you would imply that they are at the same level as us.  Are you only talking about certain groups of Vietnamese people?</p>
<p>Most of the rest of your post is irrelevant, and it doesn&rsquo;t contradict what I was saying.  Yes, I know that there are minorities within each of these ethnic groups that are a little bit above everyone else in their group.  </p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe you would use immigrants in Europe as an example.  Of course the Middle Easterners and Indians who immigrate are smarter than those who stay behind.  But after looking at their home countries you can not tell me that you actually believe that their overall IQs are as high as those who went to Europe.</p>
<p>The Maori are only one group of Polynesians.  Again, what is your point?  I am talking about averages.</p>
<p>And it should have been obvious to you that I was going by the average white IQ of 100.  And of course I know that &#8220;white&#8221; hispanics (who are in fact white and not hispanic) have IQs close to ours.</p>
<p>I am beside myself trying to figure out the whole point of your post.  I was going by averages in mine.  You haven&rsquo;t told me anything that I didn&rsquo;t already know (except your points about the Vietnamese and Hmong are wrong unless you are only talking about specific groups within their populations).  Nothing about your post is rational or scientific. </p>
<p>I am getting tired of so-called whites on this site bending over backwards to come to the defense of nonwhites based on very little facts.  It is people like you who are part of our problem.</p>

					<p><i>Courtney, Vietnamese have the same IQ as US Whites. Hmong have an IQ only 3.5 pts below US Whites.</i></p>
<p>Vietnamse cluster with other Southeast Asians, not with Norteast Asians.  Richard Lynn rates Phillipinoes at 86, Indonesians 89, Thais at 92 and Malaysians (who have a not insignificant Chinese population) at 92.  It seems beyond doubtful that Vietnamese would be at 100, and even more doubtful that the Hmong, welfare cases par excellence, are at 97.5.</p>
<p><i>Maori Polynesians are only 10 pts below Whites.</i></p>
<p>Middle Easterners in Europe are only 10 pts below Whites. E. Indians in Europe are only 5 pts below Whites.</p>
<p><span class="caps">E.I</span>ndians score in the low 80s.  It&rsquo;s beyond absurd (but par for the course for Lindsay) to rate <span class="caps">E.I</span>ndians <i>in Europe</i>, since Europe is far more selective about who it lets in than the US and Indians can&rsquo;t just walk across the border.</p>
<p>Furthermore, IQ is far from the be all and end all. The fact of <span class="caps">IQ&rsquo;</span>s genetic basis simply highlights the genetic basis for <i>all</i> human behavior, and the severely restricted range in which cultural ameliorate can operate; the genetic determinists were right all along and IQ simply confirms what they always suspected.  </p>
<p><i>And White IQ is quite variable, ranging from 103 all the way down to 90, and yes I mean White.</i></p>
<p>Lindsay (supposedly) has a hard time telling Punjabis apart from whites   &mdash;    hardly an authority on whiteness, then.</p>

					<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t know where you are getting this stuff from. I have one of Rushton&rsquo;s best books on this topic, and I am going by his averages.&#8221;</p>
<p>Courtney, if you&rsquo;ve followed Lindsay&rsquo;s posts here and on his own blog you know that &#8220;facts&#8221; are not really part of his repetoire. He posted a long screed last year according to which whites were a minority in the United States in the 19th century, based on the Census of 1825. It&rsquo;s hard to know where to begin debunking when the simple factual errors come so thick and fast, but starting with the fact that there was no census in 1825 is as good a beginning as any. </p>

					<p>&#8220;Gringos here in Mexico talk endlessly about how they love and admire the Mexican people, how friendly the natives are, how wonderful the culture is and, by strong implication, how wonderful the gringos are for appreciating Mexico. Actually they don&rsquo;t. They live in gated communities in the hills, can&rsquo;t speak three words of Spanish, and have surprisingly little contact with the country. They have invented a Mexico that doesn&rsquo;t exist, and have fallen in love with it.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Gee sounds like what the Mexicans do in America.</p>

					<p>Why is everyone so caught up on IQ being the only indicator of how great a people are?  Yes, many Asians have higher IQs than whites.  They let us know that all the time on this site.  </p>
<p>But why are so many clamoring to escape their countries?  Why are Vietnamese risking their lives coming here on makeshift rafts and not the other way around?  Here&rsquo;s why: it&rsquo;s our culture, dummy.  A society&rsquo;s value system and character, in my opinion, is the single greatest determinant in its success.  It&rsquo;s what strong nations are made of.  As long as Asians are culturally retarded, excluding the Japanese, they can&rsquo;t properly educate themselves in their own countries.  Their intelligence is a function of the fact that they live here and not there.  Just like how Blacks are physically superior as long as they live in a country that can feed them.</p>
<p>Intelligence alone says nothing about character.  Some of the most educated people (i.e., lawyers, <span class="caps">CEO</span>s, politicians, etc.) are often some of the most criminal-minded.  If I had to choose between a really intelligent and morally bankrupt person or someone slightly less intelligent but inclined to a strong sense of community, I know who to choose.         </p>

   I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m terribly impressed by this article&hellip;. Because from a historical point of view their is nothing new under the sun about what may be happening in this country concerning our southern neighbors.  I am though surprised by the fact that instead of talking about the solution (namely prostilatizing) every one gets together to hold hands in a circle of fear or I told you so groups.  Sure our politicians have let us down sure the church has become useless in this day and age&hellip;the question is&hellip;what are you going to do about it!  The problem is deffinetly not those southern folk coming over, their just following their bellys and covitessnes.   Why are you complaining about something you have the power to change.  Please don&rsquo;t come up with lame excuses either change your politicians or deliver the gospel to these people or better yet both.  Otherwise good luck with founding a new republic on another chunk of land mass..and after a hundred years in that new place. will start this conversation all over again after the moral decline and potical abdication.  History gotta love it<br><br>

<p>They were indeed, since the mall janitorial staff has a uniform of a blue polo shirt, black slacks, black shoes. Ever since I read Brave New World, I have had many double-takes and surreal moments, as I see Huxley&rsquo;s nightmare all around me.</p>

					<p><i>&#8220;This is the second person I have read for years that lives in Mexico and is constantly trying to warn America about the dangers of unchecked illegal immigration; the other is Alan Wall. Both men are American and are well educated.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>And, I might add,  both of them speak Spanish and have Mexican wives.  <br>
So they are obviously not prejudiced. They are just intelligent, sensible, and  informed. </p>
<p>They are sounding the warning,  but no one (among our politicians) is listening.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re looking for a Savior.  Obama has become their new Messiah.   </p>
<p>He will bring us &#8220;healing&#8221; and  &#8220;change&#8221;.  (They say, whatever that means.) They never explain just what or how.</p>
<p>Regarding these &#8220;ditzy left-wing college women&#8221;, our poster  Margaret wrote one some time ago that must be a classic. She pointed out that in the Middle Ages, society had a place for these wacky women. Instead of in colleges, they would be clapped into convents where they could spend all their excess time and energies saying prayers and having visions, but would be conveniently out of the way and couldn&rsquo;t meddle in the real world.</p>

					<p>&#8220;The second generation, relegated forever to jobs of low pay and less esteem, will become resentful. Inevitably they will see the relegation as indicating discrimination, not incapacity. The young, unable to compete, will gravitate toward others who can&rsquo;t and we will have another permanent underclass. If you don&rsquo;t believe me, watch.&#8221;</p>
<p>     Unfortunately, I believe that Mr. Reed has a point. Mexican immigration is different from immigration from other countries. We share a common border with Mexico and Mexicans have historic unresolved grievances against the United States. While there has always been immigration between Mexico and the United States, the huge numbers immigrating to the Southwest today will totally transform the region. We will soon have a new Quebec on our southwestern border, as well as another huge permanent, resentful underclass. </p>

I can tell you that when you see the visitors from other cultures and nations, whether it is the Japanese, Chinese, Indians, whoever, <span class="caps">ALL </span>exhibit an almost dumbstruck appearance, as they take pictures of the gigantic cathedrals, the monuments, the fantastic villas, and the general culture that surrounds them.

<p>What??? So the fact that the author pointed out the reality of many expatriates in Mexico makes the article pathetic? I&rsquo;m not sure I understand your reasoning. I, for one, thought the article was excellent. Mexico is a complicated nation that we as Americans need to understand. I&rsquo;m glad there are people out there like Fred Reed who have first hand knowledge of Mexico and aren&rsquo;t afraid to tell it like it is. I found the article very entertaining and enlightening.</p>
<p>Posted by Conrad R. at 2:07 AM on March 28 </p>
<p>Mexico is a complicated country? Mexico is a corrupt country and the Mexicans are bringing there corruption to America. I agrre with Elrey Jones. Reed might write some entertaining and true articles, but I am not sold on him. </p>

					<p>There is some confusion on the white IQ versus the Asian <span class="caps">IQ.</span> The <span class="caps">AVERAGE</span> IQ of northern Asians is about 3 points higher than whites, but keep in mind that it is in the form of a bell curve. The bell curve for whites is much broader, with more variation at either end. If the extreme low end of the white curve is subtracted, whites are on average smarter. There are more gifted whites than Asisans, and this is the population from which true innovation comes from. At the extreme right end of the curve is where the true geniuses are found. The Asians do not have this population to anywhere near the extent Europeans do. This is why almost all significant inventions are from the European brain.</p>
