						<p>OVERLAND PARK, Kan. &mdash; When Kecia Sales and Juan Marquez were married, they were like scores of other couples: very much in love with plans to live together for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t to be.</p>
<p>After their December 2004 marriage, he told her he had been living illegally in the U.S. since 1999. After leaving Mexico, Marquez had made his way to her hometown of Kansas City, Kan., where they met and married, and she took his name.</p>
<p>They became one of an estimated two million mixed families, where at least one member is a citizen or lawfully living in the country and the other isn&rsquo;t. The vast majority of those families, according to the Pew Hispanic Center, involve an illegal parent and legal children &mdash; yet another shade of the ongoing immigration conundrum in the U.S.</p>
<p>That he&rsquo;s among some 12 million illegal immigrants didn&rsquo;t change Sales&rsquo; love for Marquez. They lived in her hometown with a couple of dogs and both worked to make ends meet.</p>
<p>&#8220;It didn&rsquo;t bother me,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It doesn&rsquo;t make him any worse of a person.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Marquez, 26, and his wife, 40, finally decided he should return to Mexico and begin the long, uphill fight to re-enter the United States legally.</p>
<p>Marquez&rsquo;s decision came as Kansas and some 40 other states try to pass legislation this year dealing with illegal immigrants because Congress has failed to act. It&rsquo;s a move Hispanic advocates say affects more than illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>&#8220;It impacts also documented immigrants because families tend to be of a mixed status. Hurting one individual hurts the entire family. It creates an unwelcoming atmosphere to all immigrants, whether legal or not,&#8221; said David Ferreira of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>El Centro Inc., a Hispanic advocacy group in the Kansas City area, said its 2006 survey showed 63 per cent of Hispanics questioned said they lived in some type of mixed family status.</p>
<p>Why Juan Marquez came to the United States is a familiar tale. He wanted a better life for himself and his family, which includes two younger brothers, his mother and disabled father back in Hidalgo state.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have no money for food. My parents don&rsquo;t work,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I wanted to do whatever I have to do to put food on the table for my family.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said each week he sent $100 to his family back in Mexico &mdash; a practice known as &#8220;remittances,&#8221; which the Inter-American Development Bank says accounted for some $23 billion sent to Mexico in 2006.</p>
<p>The couple talked about the decision for him to return to Mexico in the office of their immigration attorney, Mira Mdivani, shortly before Marquez left last month.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&rsquo;t feel safe in the streets. You don&rsquo;t feel safe anywhere because of a lot of things going on right now,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The police pull you over for no reason.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to be free, to go wherever I want to go and not be scared. In the long run, it will be worth it. We can have a better life and we won&rsquo;t be scared anymore,&#8221; Marquez said.</p>
<p>When he was in the U.S., he worked at construction jobs, doing everything from picking up garbage to cleaning sewers and provided about two-thirds of the household income.</p>
<p>Kecia Marquez said she worried daily that her husband would be arrested at work by immigration agents, so much so that she called him three or four times a day to check on him.</p>
<p>Her worries continue about whether he will be allowed back in the United States anytime soon.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s stressful, very stressful, because I don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s coming back. It&rsquo;s just that I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;re doing the right thing. This is my home, and I want it to be here with my husband,&#8221; she said as both teared up.</p>
<p>Mdivani said because Juan Marquez entered the country illegally and stayed more than a year, the law bars him from coming back for 10 years, unless the government approves a waiver request from his wife. She said the waiver request was denied March 13 by the U.S. Consulate in Juarez, Mexico, but it agreed to give Kecia Marquez 30 days to submit new evidence of hardship. Then it could take up to a year for a decision about whether he can return.</p>
<p>&#8220;The law is extremely unforgiving,&#8221; Mdivani said. &#8220;But I think Kecia has a compelling case. She takes care of a disabled sister and uncle. She won&rsquo;t have the opportunity for any kind of decent job there and she will lose the house.&#8221;</p>
<p>She also won&rsquo;t be getting much sympathy from those pushing tougher immigration legislation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have compassion for them, but I&rsquo;m also concerned about Kansas citizens. I&rsquo;m responsible to the citizens to protect them,&#8221; said Republican state Senator Peggy Palmer, who is pushing this year for stronger laws to discourage illegal immigration in Kansas.</p>
<p>Kecia Marquez has her own feelings about what legislators are trying to do.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s making it hard for everyone. It&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;re being punished just because my husband is Hispanic,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Not so, says Kris Kobach, state Republican chairman, who helped draft the legislation.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a reflection of the fact that we&rsquo;re a nation that respects the rule of law,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There are millions of people waiting patiently in line to get in and we shouldn&rsquo;t forget they are playing by the rules when talking about those coming here illegally.&#8221;</p>
<p>If she can&rsquo;t get the waiver approved, Kecia Marquez says she will move to Mexico.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll have to do. That&rsquo;s my husband. I have to go where he goes,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I love him, I can&rsquo;t forget about him.&#8221;<br>

					<p>The solution should be obvious.  Their spouse should be stripped of citizenship and deported right along with the criminal fugitive alien.</p>
<p>Not without precedent.  This is exactly what was done during both World Wars 1 and 2.</p>

<p>It is as if they didn&rsquo;t know&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>There must be a stop to all immigration and then take the steps necessary to validate each person in the <span class="caps">US.</span></p>
<p>Those that are not legal must be deported.</p>

<p>If the good people of Kansas want to see enforcement continue, then they&rsquo;re going to have to rise up and vigorously defend their police and their laws.  Now.  Because if they choose instead to sit at home and watch teevee or drink beer or go to soccer practice, then rest assured the immigration lobby (attorneys, ethnic activists, <span class="caps">NGO</span>s) will stymie immigration enforcement efforts now and forever after and Kansans will lose their state.    </p>

					<p>We don&rsquo;t seem to have a problem separating families when a member commits a crime and goes to prison. Why should this be any different? </p>
<p>At least they can go to Mexico and live a normal life. Family members don&rsquo;t have the choice of moving into prison with convicted family members.</p>

					<p>It makes no sense that good decent people from neighboring Mexico, that shares our essential culture, people working and contributing, even married to citizens, are deported, while at the same time we bring in millions of openly hostile people from vicious and primitive cultures from places far from our boarders like Africa, often from cultures so alien that they immediately become social burdens upon the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>taxpayer, either on welfare or in the prison system. Let&rsquo;s stop the flood of <span class="caps">LEGALS </span>from Africa (including all the bogus African &#8220;refugees&#8221;) and Jamaica and Haiti, and instead allow the Hispanic illegals already here, settled, working, paying taxes, and compatible with our culture, stay. </p>

					<p><br>
Last year I had read that Hispanic men represented a high percentage rate in domestic and spousal abuse cases.<br><br>
After following up on the topic and speaking with a Kansas local law enforcement official I found that women of domestic violence had limited resources such as <span class="caps">DVACK </span>(Domestic Violence Assistance Center of Kansas) to seperate themselves from  potential death but would have to return home after 30 days.<br><br>
The latest news comes as a breath of fresh air to local communities and the people of Kansas as a whole.<br><br>
Mexicans residing in Kansas are extreme Mexican nationalists and their hatred for America and racial intolerance for their White spouses as they wait for America to transition into a multicultural imperial empire is often acted out through domestic violence.<br><br>
Their are vast Mexican enclaves within the state of Kansas.<br><br>
whenever Mexicans come into contact with Americanism conflict not harmony is usually the rule.</p>

<p>Couldn&rsquo;t you do that in Mexico, Juan?  And as far as being scared is concerned, wasn&rsquo;t that you at the last protest demanding amnesty, holding up a sign that said, &#8220;Whites go back to Europe.  This land is our land?&#8221;  Or was it one of your friends?</p>
<p>&#8220;If she can&rsquo;t get the waiver approved, Kecia Marquez says she will move to Mexico.&#8221;</p>
<p>Atta girl.  That&rsquo;s the kind of spirit I like to see.  If I were her, though, I&rsquo;d start packing right now, because those waivers are rarely granted.</p>
<p>If she gets fed up with Mexico, she can always sneak across the border some night with Juan.</p>

<p>I bet all of the legal immigrants feel safe. If they get pulled over &#8220;for no reason,&#8221; they prove their citizenship and return to daily life. Criminals should not feel safe.</p>

<p>His statements indicate that enforcement will work. The illegals will self-deport. In other words, we do not have to round them all up, as is often claimed. </p>
<p>The woman who married Marquez should loose her citizenship and be repatriated with him. Keep families together, but not in the <span class="caps">US. </span></p>

					<p>In sane, civilized societies, criminals are not supposed to feel safe in the streets. Because ours is not a sane society, criminals feel perfectly safe, and law-abiding citizens have constantly to look over their shoulders for Pepe or Tyrone.</p>
<p>Let the &#8220;American&#8221; halves of these couples accompany their partners when they&rsquo;re deported. We&rsquo;re better off without them.</p>

					<p>What a fool this woman is. Marriage is surely about trusting your partner, yet her Mexican husband lied to her about comitting a serious crime and she still wants to be with him. How can she trust him after this?</p>
<p>If she wants to carry on her foolishness then Mexico would surely be the best place for her. My bet is that on moving to Mexico her Juan will rapidly lose interest in her as she will no longer be his meal ticket.</p>

					<p>If Juan &#8220;doesn&rsquo;t feel safe in the streets&#8221;, would he care to speculate why whites have been fleeing the southwest and relocating farther north for the last 15 years?</p>
<p>The worst the police in Kansas will do to him is deport him.  They won&rsquo;t, for example, car-jack him or rape his wife.<br>

<p>That is through our &#8220;membership&#8221; in the United Nations. The refugee program that started after World War II was supposed to end after three years but was extended&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. Now member nations are supposed to accept a certain number of &#8220;refugees&#8221; as defined by the United Nations - (mostly made up with those Third World countries). The refugees get to select their destination. And WE get to support them!</p>

<p>I have a better idea. The <span class="caps">USA </span>should deport anyone here not legally,build the fence and enforce the laws we already have. We should also not allow anyone that does not speak English or has not had a full background check to enter. There should also have to pay for the background check and either have family or a job here to support them and not be allowed any Gov. handouts for 5 years. If they cant support their selfs 5 years after they are admitted, they will be deported.<br>
Also anyone admitted under a student visa should have to prove that they are actually smart enough to go to school and be charged atleast 2 times as much as a citizen of the <span class="caps">USA. </span><br><br>
Any children produced by these people, will not be citizens of this Country until their parents have proved that they will be productive citizens of the <span class="caps">USA </span>and not a drain of tax dollars. If the parents or parent is deported, so is the child or children.<br><br>
I know the liberals, and bleeding hearts will say that it is cruel, but I say to them..cry me a river. I am sick of working my butt off and having to live pay check to pay check, while illegals and people from other Countries get free housing and food from my tax dollars, while they have pay by cash jobs so they can afford new big screens and new cars, and consider having babies as a way to get a pay raise.  <br><br>

					<p>Hasta la vista, baby!  I was under the impression that if a US citizen marries a non US citizen, they were automatically granted residency while waiting for their application to be processed. </p>
<p>So there are 40 states in the process of passing immigration legislation?  The other 10 probably include California, Texas and Illinois.  Wanna bet that at least 15,000,000 illegals run to these states once the rest of America gets control of its borders?  It will be disastrous. </p>
