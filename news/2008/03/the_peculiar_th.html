<h1>The Peculiar Theology of Black Liberation</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Spengler, Asia Times (Hong Kong), March 18, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Senator Barack Obama is not a Muslim, contrary to invidious rumors. But he belongs to a Christian church whose doctrine casts Jesus Christ as a &#8220;black messiah&#8221; and blacks as &#8220;the chosen people&#8221;. At best, this is a radically different kind of Christianity than most Americans acknowledge; at worst it is an ethnocentric heresy.</p>
<p>What played out last week on America&rsquo;s television screens was a clash of two irreconcilable cultures, the posture of &#8220;black liberation theology&#8221; and the mainstream American understanding of Christianity. Obama, who presented himself as a unifying figure, now seems rather the living embodiment of the clash.</p>
<p>One of the strangest dialogues in American political history ensued on March 15 when Fox News interviewed Obama&rsquo;s pastor, the Reverend Jeremiah Wright, of Chicago&rsquo;s Trinity Church. Wright asserted the authority of the &#8220;black liberation&#8221; theologians James Cone and Dwight Hopkins:</p>
<p><b>Wright:</b> How many of Cone&rsquo;s books have you read? How many of Cone&rsquo;s book have you read?</p>
<p><b>Sean Hannity:</b> Reverend, Reverend?</p>
<p>(crosstalk)</p>
<p><b>Wright:</b> How many books of Cone&rsquo;s have you head?</p>
<p><b>Hannity:</b> I&rsquo;m going to ask you this question &hellip;</p>
<p><b>Wright:</b> How many books of Dwight Hopkins have you read?</p>
<p><b>Hannity:</b> You&rsquo;re very angry and defensive. I&rsquo;m just trying to ask a question here.</p>
<p><b>Wright:</b> You haven&rsquo;t answered &mdash; you haven&rsquo;t answered my question.</p>
<p>Hopkins is a full professor at the University of Chicago&rsquo;s Divinity School; Cone is now distinguished professor at New York&rsquo;s Union Theological Seminary. They promote a &#8220;black power&#8221; reading of Christianity, to which liberal academic establishment condescends.</p>
<p>Obama referred to this when he asserted in a March 14 statement, &#8220;I knew Reverend Wright as someone who served this nation with honor as a United States Marine, as a respected biblical scholar, and as someone who taught or lectured at seminaries across the country, from Union Theological Seminary to the University of Chicago.&#8221; But the fact the liberal academy condescends to sponsor black liberation theology does not make it less peculiar to mainstream American Christians. Obama wants to talk about what Wright is, rather than what he says. But that way lies apolitical quicksand.</p>
<p>Since Christianity taught the concept of divine election to the Gentiles, every recalcitrant tribe in Christendom has rebelled against Christian universalism, insisting that it is the &#8220;Chosen People&#8221; of God &mdash; French, English, Russian, Germans and even (through the peculiar doctrine of Mormonism) certain Americans. America remains the only really Christian country in the industrial world, precisely because it transcends ethnicity. One finds ethnocentricity only in odd corners of its religious life; one of these is African-American.</p>
<p>During the black-power heyday of the late 1960s, after the murder of the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr, the mentors of Wright decided that blacks were the Chosen People. James Cone, the most prominent theologian in the &#8220;black liberation&#8221; school, teaches that Jesus Christ himself is black. As he explains:</p>
<blockquote>Christ is black therefore not because of some cultural or psychological need of black people, but because and only because Christ really enters into our world where the poor were despised and the black are, disclosing that he is with them enduring humiliation and pain and transforming oppressed slaves into liberating servants.</blockquote>
<p>Theologically, Cone&rsquo;s argument is as silly as the &#8220;Aryan Christianity&#8221; popular in Nazi Germany, which claimed that Jesus was not a Jew at all but an Aryan Galilean, and that the Aryan race was the &#8220;chosen people&#8221;. Cone, Hopkins and Wright do not propose, of course, to put non-blacks in concentration camps or to conquer the world, but racially-based theology nonetheless is a greased chute to the nether regions.</p>
<p>Biblical theology teaches that even the most terrible events to befall Israel, such as the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BCE, embody the workings of divine justice, even if humankind cannot see God&rsquo;s purpose. James Cone sees the matter very differently. Either God must do what we want him to do, or we must reject him, Cone maintains:</p>
<blockquote>Black theology refuses to accept a God who is not identified totally with the goals of the black community. If God is not for us and against white people, then he is a murderer, and we had better kill him. The task of black theology is to kill Gods who do not belong to the black community&hellip;&nbsp;. Black theology will accept only the love of God which participates in the destruction of the white enemy. What we need is the divine love as expressed in Black Power, which is the power of black people to destroy their oppressors here and now by any means at their disposal. Unless God is participating in this holy activity, we must reject his love. [1]</blockquote>
<p>In the black liberation theology taught by Wright, Cone and Hopkins, Jesus Christ is not for all men, but only for the oppressed:</p>
<blockquote>In the New Testament, Jesus is not for all, but for the oppressed, the poor and unwanted of society, and against oppressors&hellip;&nbsp;. Either God is for black people in their fight for liberation and against the white oppressors, or he is not [Cone].</blockquote>
<p>In this respect black liberation theology is identical in content to all the ethnocentric heresies that preceded it. Christianity has no use for the nations, a &#8220;drop of the bucket&#8221; and &#8220;dust on the scales&#8221;, in the words of Isaiah. It requires that individuals turn their back on their ethnicity to be reborn into Israel in the spirit. That is much easier for Americans than for the citizens of other nations, for Americans have no ethnicity. But the tribes of the world do not want to abandon their Gentile nature and as individuals join the New Israel. Instead they demand eternal life in their own Gentile flesh, that is, to be the &#8220;Chosen People&#8221;.</p>
<p>That is the &#8220;biblical scholarship&#8221; to which Obama referred in his March 14 defense of Wright and his academic prominence. In his response to Hannity, Wright genuinely seemed to believe that the authority of Cone and Hopkins, who now hold important posts at liberal theological seminaries, was sufficient to make the issue go away. His faith in the white establishment is touching; he honestly cannot understand why the white reporters at Fox News are bothering him when the University of Chicago and the Union Theological Seminary have put their stamp of approval on black liberation theology.</p>
<p>Many things that the liberal academy has adopted, though, will horrify most Americans, and not only &#8220;black liberation theology&#8221; (Queer Studies comes to mind, among other things). It cannot be in Obama&rsquo;s best interests to appeal to the authority of Cone, whose unapologetic racism must be repugnant to the great majority of Americans, including the majority of black Americans, who for the most part belong to Christian churches that preach mainstream Christian doctrine. Christianity teaches unconditional love for a God whose love for humankind is absolute; it does not teach the repudiation of a God who does not destroy our enemies on the spot.</p>
<p>Whether Obama takes seriously the doctrines that Wright preaches is another matter. It is possible that Obama does not believe a word of what Wright, Cone and Hopkins teach. Perhaps he merely used the Trinity United Church of Christ as a political stepping-stone. African-American political life is centered around churches, and his election to the Illinois State Senate with the support of Chicago&rsquo;s black political machine required church membership. Trinity United happens to be Chicago&rsquo;s largest and most politically active black church.</p>
<p>Obama views Wright rather at arm&rsquo;s length: as the New York Times reported on April 30, 2007:</p>
<blockquote>Reverend Wright is a child of the 60s, and he often expresses himself in that language of concern with institutional racism and the struggles the African-American community has gone through,&#8221; Mr Obama said. &#8220;He analyzes public events in the context of race. I tend to look at them through the context of social justice and inequality.</blockquote>
<p>Obama holds his own views close. But it seems unlikely that he would identify with the ideological fits of the black-power movement of the 1960s. Obama does not come to the matter with the perspective of an American black, but of the child of a left-wing anthropologist raised in the Third World, as I wrote elsewhere (Obama&rsquo;s women reveal his secret, Asia Times Online, February 26, 2008). It is possible that because of the Wright affair Obama will suffer for what he pretended to be, rather than for what he really is.</p>
