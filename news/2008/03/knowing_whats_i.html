						<p>Hear the Reverend Jeremiah Wright explain why so many people are &#8220;hatin&rsquo; on&#8221; Barack.</p>
<p>A few gems:</p>
<p>*&nbsp;Jesus was a poor black man in a country that was controlled by rich, white Italians who ran everything.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;Barak doesn&rsquo;t fit the mold: he ain&rsquo;t white; he ain&rsquo;t rich; and he ain&rsquo;t privileged. Hillary fits the mold. Hillary never had a cab whiz past her because her skin was the wrong color. Hillary was not black and poor and raised in a single-parent home. Barack was.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;Hillary ain&rsquo;t never had her own people say she wasn&rsquo;t white enough.<br>

			<p>Wright claims Jesus was black?  It seems that blacks, lacking great men of their own, endlessly try to claim great historical figures of their own.  This is not just wrong, it is blasphemous.  Jesus was Jewish, not black.</p>

			<p>I worked with a large group of black guys for a number of years. A large percentage of middle-class blacks do believe that whites created AIDS to kill blacks, that whites pump grugs into the ghettos to addict blacks and that virtually all whites secretely hate blacks and try to hide it. This ugly set of beliefs is swept under the carpet by white liberals. Now that mainstream whites are seeing what passes for culture in the black community there will be a lot of uncomfortable silences when the races meet.</p>

			<p>The Rev. Wright is actually rather moderate. I&rsquo;m sure far worse things are said about whites in places like, well, the College of William and Mary, for example.</p>
<p>Rev. Wright&rsquo;s sermons are basically just kooky, &#8220;Afro-centrized&#8221; sociology lectures.  </p>

			<p>Even black cab drivers will &#8220;whiz&#8221; past blacks. One told me that they are cheap tippers and &#8220;run out&#8221; a lot. Blacks are discriminated against for good reasons.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Jesus was a poor black man in a country that was controlled by rich, white Italians who ran everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here it is again.  Black Afrocentric co-option of another race&rsquo;s important figures and its accomplishments and transferring them into their own asset column, because they have absolutely nothing that they can point to where they, as a people, have accomplished something that benefited humanity.<br>
   And by claiming such information isn&rsquo;t in the history books because evil whites covered it all up, the propaganda serves as a great tool for recruiting more black haters.  Too it soothes the inferior feelings high-profile blacks have, because they know their race has been a complete failure, which taints them personally by association or inclusion.<br>
   The talkmeisters haven&rsquo;t picked up on this yet, but it is rhetoric such as this that helps to keep blacks back, giving them a feeling of entitlement and victimization.  It reveals Barack Hussein as not only a false unifier, but one who is aiding in the continuance of black failure, doesn&rsquo;t it?  I mean, since his twenty year work/affiliation with the church makes it more than obvious he is agreement with this evil revisionist propaganda or he would have left or, at the very least, spoken out against it.</p>
<p>After these hateful videos have run their course, the talkmeisters would do well to bring this Afrocentric nonsense out in the open, revealing it for what it is.  In learning of it, most whites will be just as appalled as they are right now with the anti-white hate.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Hillary was not Black and poor.&#8221;   I was driving with my best friend and next door neighbor of over  forty years to the mall a while back. On the side of the freeway was an overweight, middle aged  woman who had apparently been struck and killed trying to take a short cut across the highway instead of walking a quarter mile to the next overpass.  Not exactly an everyday sight. A passerby had stopped and  thrown his sport coat across the womans  face and upper torso. <br>
  Sticking out from that coat were the womans legs. My mind raced a million miles a minute at the sight of, as I`ve heard it put before, the majesty of death. Her legs were a chocolate brown with callouses on the knees from what  I guess was lifetime of manual labor. A small part of her cheap cotton dress, the eleven dollar Walmart kind, was blowing in the breeze. In that instant, I thought of all the unfairness in life and how lucky I was to have had the parents I did etc. Keeping in character and right on cue, my buddy surmised the situation and my own  deep thoughts  using the lowest common denominator. &#8220;Timmy!, Timmy! Timmy!&#8221; he said. &#8220;She`s four things you`ve never been. Poor, Black, female and dead!!&#8221; A surge of comradeship and common understanding of a middle class suburban way of looking at life flowed between us at that moment. I think of her every  now and then as my own appointment with destiny draws  inevitably nearer&hellip; </p>

			<p>&#8220;A few gems&#8221;, eh? Why does the black race insist that Jesus Christ was black when we all know better? And what is this ludicrous term, &#8220;hatin&rsquo; on&#8221; black people? Despite the millions of dollars poured into education for them, they are still poorly spoken and unlikely to improve. Besides, I actually see a tremendous empathy for Barack rather than White sheeple &#8220;hatin on&#8221; him. Let&rsquo;s be honest: he cannot win without support from the very race that Wright believes hates him, and unbelievably, he is receiving that support. Does Wright want Barack to be anointed??<br>

			<p>Is it any wonder these people are where they are? Has it ever dawned on the good reverend that all blacks have been free to leave the country &#8216;controlled by rich, white people&rsquo; since 1865? There&rsquo;s two-thirds of a continent available to people like the reverend where they can live out the rest of their lives without encountering another rich, white person again.</p>

Yes, most people think that a lot of damage was done by this incident. I am one of them. As these statements are repeated, uncomfortable feelings will start to be associated with Obama. And people will keep repeating the colorful sermons of Reverent Wright.</p>
<p>To quote Bill Kristol, &#8220;the bloom is off the rose.&#8221;</p>

			<p>That is the craziest thing that I have ever heard that Obama isnt rich. His wife alone made over 300,000 dollars last year at her hospital administrator job. That is about 10x the average wage in the US. </p>

			<p>I hope the Wright scandal hurts Obama. Far too many thus far beleive this man would make a good president, when a closer look at him shows him to be for open borders and social programs that would make taxes go sky high. He is smart, but too young, possibly has Muslim beliefs and is ultra liberal in every view. As much as I dislike Hillary and would never vote for her I think she would be better than Obama. I&rsquo;m no McCain fan either but will vote for him because, sadly, a third party candidate has no chance. </p>

<p>No thanks, &#8220;Doctor&#8221; Wright, I&rsquo;ll pass.</p>

<p>Okay, I&rsquo;ll say it.  Hillary, who never met a white man she didn&rsquo;t want to discriminate against, isn&rsquo;t white enough for me.</p>
<p>Also, if Jesus was black then I&rsquo;m a Hottentot.<br>

<p>Not in those words but plenty of us wonder about her and her husbands fawning over blacks. But the worm has turned. Why should blacks settle for a pseudo-black president when they can have an authentic one.</p>

			<p>If Obama wins the presidency, will corporate America put up black Jesus decorations at Christmas?  Or will they finally just do away with Christmas altogether?  If Hillary wins, does that mean we&rsquo;ll have a Wiccan Christmas?  Then again I heard that for Lent, John McCain sleeps blindfolded in a closet.  What a choice. </p>

			<p>      I love Jerry. He is the man who has submarined the first<br>
real chance of a Black Presidency. I hope he runs for President<br>
too. The more Whites learn about Blacks the better. Exposure<br>
is the innoculation they need. Even I, a student of many years,<br>
have learned from this latest incident. I didn&rsquo;t know that Afro-<br>
centric Racism was so common in Black Churches.</p>

			<p>At least here we can speak our mind; and I don&rsquo;t care what anyone says, these statements, from the mouth of an adult, is proof he is developmentally retarded.  That is our America today; a place where the developmentally retarded are not only enabled, and encouraged, but actually placed above criticism.</p>

			<p>Wright is  black? He is much whiter looking than Obama who we know had the exact 2 opposites with a 100% white race traitor mother and a 100% typical African black white female lover proving they are the same all over. They all love those white women. <br>
Wright must suffer from an idenity crisis with the 90% white blood he has in his genes and only 10% black so he makes up the difference with his stupid mouth although clearly Clinton and McCain are both grinning from ear to ear.</p>

			<p>Good point, Sardonicus! But does it really matter? Obama will be judged by WHAT HE DID NOT SAY&hellip; just as much as what he DOES say. The posturing and distancing notwithstanding.</p>
<p>As far as I&rsquo;m aware, Obama has hardly said anything about Blacks needing to clean THEIR act up. That Blacks themselves shut themselves out of the employment picture. How can the average Black punk, trying to exude an &#8220;I&rsquo;s so tough so don&rsquo; mess wif me, man!&#8221; expect to get a job? Particularly if that young Black has barely the equivalent of a 6th-grade education. NO job skills. </p>
<p>What IS it with Blacks that they can&rsquo;t grasp this vital concept? Those Blacks with education and brains DO get decent paying jobs. The proof of that is all around us. So are these people REALLY dumb enough to think an Obama in the White House will get each of them a $200,000 home, a $40,000 car and an affluent lifestyle   &mdash;   WITHOUT their having to do honest work to earn it? Can the average Black really be stupid enough to believe that?</p>
<p>We keep hearing empty prattle about bring change by Obama and his OBAMABOTS. But WHAT change? Will he motivate the average Black drop-out to go back to school. Get a G.E.D. Talk, dress and ACT like a human being? Go to a job interview and act like he really WANTS to work?</p>
<p>Or will Obama simply pour billions of White taxpayers&rsquo; dollars into Blacks&rsquo; pockets. Giving them more money to spend on cheap booze, drugs, and outlandish clothing. While they nevertheless stagnate as a hopelessly dysfunctional race supported entirely by the White working class?</p>

			<p>Every white original American who has been the &#8221; victim of an inter-racial : murder, beatings, muggings, carjacking, high taxes, numerous social programs from our non-constitutional governments, both state and federal,destroyed white cities, ghettos,great corruption in black city governments; know all too well how it is to be &#8221; black &#8220;. The best example is whites &#8221; voting with their feet &#8221; aka, white flight from their former towns and cities now hostile and fatal to stay there anlonger due to the racist criminal parasites that move in to hurt, kill and destroy what the white previous culture had created and built in earlier times.</p>

			<p>Raised in a single parent home.  By the white parent.  And just look at the gratitude!</p>
<p>Then again, it looks like mom didn&rsquo;t care for whites either- even though we can be quite sure her own parents were white. </p>
<p>Parasites- but not mindless ones.  Parasites with simple minds filled with animosity for their hosts.  They are like the creatures in the movie &#8220;Aliens&#8221;!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m white, by the way.  I have had cabs whiz by many times (in Japan).  I&rsquo;m neither rich, nor &#8220;privileged&#8221; (well, I am white- so perhaps I am privileged. Wouldn&rsquo;t want to be anything else.).  <br>
I do qualify as poor, in (modern) terms of income, though I have never felt that I am poor. I choose to live an artist&rsquo;s lifestyle, dedicated to pursuing the development of my skill. I feel fortunate.   <br>
If Mr. B. Hussein bin Obama would like the rich to give to the poor, a tenth of his wealth would make me ten times richer than I am now.  If this is to be reserved for victims of racial discrimination-great!  I&rsquo;m from Detroit.  Driven out, for being white. </p>
<p>I am a perfect candidate to receive a huge chunk of of change from Obama, according to the rational of modern American liberal-leftists. If one applies rational logic to it, that is- which destroys it anyway. Or removes the &#8220;except for whites, who are evil and must be punished &amp; exploited at every opportunity&#8221; plank.  Oh well. </p>
<p>Perhaps I am a perfect candidate for their sympathetic votes, if not their personal wealth: racially disadvantaged (at least in terms of society&rsquo;s treatment of my ethnicity. I feel no natural disadvantage!) and disenfranchised,  victim of racially motivated violence, and poor.  <br>
Now, I was raised by two good parents, and will make money in due course, I&rsquo;m sure. <br>
But I have lived the life they wail about! They should vote for me! I would certainly fight racism that is rampant in America.  I would fight to abolish laws establishing racial preferences, and a host of laws that amount to the oppression of one race by another, and by the government. </p>
<p>I would even push for redress!  Reparations!  Billions &amp; billions of dollars taken from hard working Americans under the pretext of a fraudulent &#8220;War on poverty&#8221;- which has failed miserably &amp; is in desperate need of an &#8220;exit strategy&#8221;- need to be returned!  Forcing people to subsidize the birth &amp; care of other people&rsquo;s children BEFORE their own MUST STOP!  (60 -70% of black children&rsquo;s births are paid for by &#8220;the government&#8221;)   <br>
Again, reparations are necessary.  Declining births among white people because of the economic hardship of supporting others&rsquo; families first must be reversed through a repayment- 60% of white children&rsquo;s births should be subsidized for, let&rsquo;s say 5 years; yeah, that&rsquo;s the ticket, these folks love &#8220;5-year plans&#8221;!  Also, the costs of raising these children should be offset as well, through tax breaks AND rebates!</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, folks- if you are for lifting up the poor and downtrodden, if you against racism in America, and want change- and not just &#8220;chump change&#8221;, but real change- put your money where your mouth is change,  if you want &#8220;war on poverty&#8221; dollars brought back home where they belong- (never mind &#8220;Schwarzkopf dollars&#8221;)- if you want REAL change, vote for the man from Motown! </p>
<p>In fact, keep the &#8220;change&#8221;- we want the whole!  We&rsquo;ll make America whole again! We can get rid of the division that plagues our society, by addressing the true causes of such division.  Yes, we can!  (Let&rsquo;s all chant for a while now~ OK, that&rsquo;s enough. Cut it out!)  Work- we can put Americans back to work.  We can build real and lasting monuments, such as to surpass such things as the Great Wall of China (wink, wink), and we can build our economic security while building our physical security. (Do not worry about Al-Qaeda. It will no longer exist.  <br>
Trust me on that one- we can do it in a few days with an expanded &#8220;Mecca Plan&#8221;. Afterwards, there may be those who hate us, but they will never, ever again dare to say so.) </p>
<p>If you are for economic security, national security, the elimination of divisive racial-preference laws,  &#8220;reparations&#8221;  for those who have been truly oppressed,  and the unity of the American people and the healing of our society, you must vote for the one candidate who truly knows the pain of victimhood, the one who truly desires above all else to return the nation to her ideals; you must vote for the man from Motown- vote for me!!  (Mexicans should also vote for me, for by my second term, I will have annexed Mexico, and begun construction of a second wall- just south of the Panama canal, which I will reclaim. To help our neighbors in South America, we can stimulate and support their economies in the way that ours has been stimulated for so long: we can supply them with tens of millions of industrious Mexicans. And they will already know the local language, so they should help those societies even more than they helped ours! We can then begin to eradicate racism on the Yucatan peninsula by supporting the growth of the (for now) minority white population there.  Of course, in order to help the peninsula mimic the incomparable success we&rsquo;ve had in the north, we will eventually seek to recreate the conditions for that success, by making a Yucatan that &#8220;looks like&#8221; the rest of north America did- in the 1950&rsquo;s. But that&rsquo;s for the third term&hellip; [I know, I know. The rules will have to change. <br>
But it&rsquo;s change we want, right?]</p>
<p>Yep, a vote for me is a vote for real change. Forget about the man who goes to church to learn to hate- vote for the man with a vision for the future, vote for the man from Motown!</p>

			<p>* Barak doesn&rsquo;t fit the mold: he ain&rsquo;t white; he ain&rsquo;t rich; and he ain&rsquo;t privileged.</p>
<p><br>
Ok&hellip;.that was the funniest thing I&rsquo;ve heard yet about Obama.</p>
<p>Because of course, he most certainly is all three.  </p>
<p>Obama IS white.  Genetically he&rsquo;s half white.  Socially he&rsquo;s all white, having been raised by his white mother without any input from his black father (who, in typical fashion for blacks these days, abandoned him as a child).</p>
<p>By any standard, Obama is a wealthy man.</p>
<p>Obama lives a life of privilege.  Or put another way.  How many homies from the ghetto have been to Harvard and were offered a career track that would have eventually landed them on The Supreme Court (as was most definitely offered to, and turned down by, Barack Obama).  The man was elected to the Senate of the most powerful nation on earth and had a significant chance of being elected President (which he seems to have blown, solely due to his own bad behavior).  Perhaps I am unclear on what it means to live a life of privilege.</p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s what you will never see reported in the press, and you certainly won&rsquo;t hear this racist clown Wright ever say it: Barrack and his wife have a combined household income of nearly two million dollars. Mrs. Obama, who whines and cries that she and her husband have to pay back college loans the way whites, Asians and Latinos do, makes over 200K just on her own. Yet she is ever so put upon to pay back her loans  &mdash;  she is a victim. I paid mine back when I was making 16K. </p>
<p>Wright, in his rants, covers every stale black racist cliche known to man. These people never stop complaining, never stop crying  &mdash;  I am fed up with them. We don&rsquo;t need them. Never have. With the exception of the occasional great athlete or musician, blacks  for the most part, contribute nothing to this civilization besides crime and they know it. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to Write Wright&rsquo;s speeches for him, just to insert a little reality.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hillary ain&rsquo;t never had her black Daddy abandon her and her mother as if they were pieces of garbage to be discarded. After all, 8 out of ten black fathers do exactly that!!</p>
<p>Hillary ain&rsquo;t never had to deal with a 2 million dollar salary like Obama and his black wife have!</p>
<p>Hillary ain&rsquo;t never had a taxi whiz by her because the driver feared the rampant black crime that has made most of our cities unlivable  &mdash;   &#8220;</p>
<p>and so on and so on<br>

			<p>I heard parts of his speech. OMG, this guy does not know History except what the communists in public school wanted you to hear. The issue of slavery was not issue that divide the country until early 19th century. Slavery was only an issue for the Constitution because the problem on  how determine slaves for the house which is based on the population numbers. Does anyone realize that Obama is slightly blames whites for the black problem and also lied about not being there when Wright made the ant-white comments. Also if you look at the body language, Obama is not only lying but actually believe what Wright says.<br>

			<p>Wright is black? He is much whiter looking than Obama who we know had the exact 2 opposites with a 100% white race traitor mother and a 100% typical African black white female lover proving they are the same all over. They all love those white women. <br>
Wright must suffer from an idenity crisis with the 90% white blood he has in his genes and only 10% black so he makes up the difference with his stupid mouth although clearly Clinton and McCain are both grinning from ear to ear.</p>

<p>There certainly is a stark melanin disparity between the preacher and the congregration.</p>
<p>It certainly is revealing that this is what the black elite buy into. You would expect this from the ghetto but it certainly does explain the mentality of someone who makes $300,000 a year being &#8216;proud of [her] country for the first time in [her] adult life.&rsquo; </p>

<p>Do you suppose we could take up a collection and offer him a one-way ticket anywhere in the world he wants to go? Bet he wouldn&rsquo;t leave. Blacks will always have an inborn rage and hatred of this country, but they&rsquo;ll never have it as good as anywhere else. I could&rsquo;t belive he said Obama was hated.

			<p>Not white enough?  But wasn&rsquo;t her husband the &#8220;first black president&#8221;?<br>
It&rsquo;s fine to be a vehement racist as long as your target is whites.<br>
Obama, whose whole life is one obsession with not being black enough, must hate whites at least as much as his dear pastor and his wife.  After all the two most central figures in his life, not his white mother or grandparents who brought him up, but his anti-white racist pastor and wife must have some influence on what he really thinks.  He must go home every night an have a good laugh with his wife about about  how so many white devils support him.  It is sad to see just how low we have come in the quality of our presidential candidates, Hillary, Obama and Mccain  &mdash;  the first two hate white men and the last is in bed with Teddy Kennedy  &mdash;  what a non-choice.</p>

<p>As far as this poor bum Wright goes, I wouldn&rsquo;t get upset about him. Blacks have been saing that for years. Jesus was black, this guy was black, that guy was black, etc. It&rsquo;s always the same tune with them. Never changes.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s very clear that the Rev. Wright is of mixed race and from the looks of him, more white than black. Of course, this is the source of his hatred of all things white.  He wants to be white, but knows it can never be.  Therefore he holds all whites in contempt and hatred, particularly his white ancestors because they caused him to be this mongrelization of races.  If truth be known, he is not wholly accepted by his black audience and most certainly not trusted by them.  He is too black to be white and too white to be black.  His heart is filled with hatred and his most likely to be one of the most miserable creatures on this planet.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve often wondered where all the black hostility towards whites came from.  Surely the small handful of black race hustlers didn&rsquo;t have that much influence over black Americans?<br>
Now my question has been answered.<br>
It comes from thousands of Jerermiah Wrights preaching racial hatred in the form of &#8220;Liberation Theology&#8221; in thousands of black churches througout our country every week.<br>
It&rsquo;s no wonder so many black minds have been poisoned by this venomous stream of hatred masquerading as religion.  After all, if your own preacher says it, it must be true.</p>

			<p>If one positive thing has resulted from &#8220;dr&#8221; wright&rsquo;s hate filled, afrocentric tirade, it is the white sheeple&rsquo;s realization how racist blacks really are.  I am overjoyed the MSM is playing this for all it is worth.</p>
<p>While visiting a retail establishment this weekend, I noticed the TV was on a MSM news station and low and behold, they were playing reverend kooky&rsquo;s sermon over and over!  I remarked to the young white clerk what a pathetic racist this guy was and how all white people that somehow doubt that blacks are racist should consider this their wake up call- most blacks actually encourage and perpetuate racism towards whites.  I was really half expecting this young man to be an Obama supporter and to make excuses, but I was pleasantly surprised that he agreed with me and added, &#8220;yes, the emperor wears no clothes.  Nothing but a black racist hate mongerer.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Wright is big on reparations. The church has an official document on it. </p>
<p>One thing many people are forgetting is that Bush and his neocon GOP screwups are responsible for all this. Gas tripling and food going to the moon along with everything else as he dances a jig on Africa and at the WH looking like the typical idiot he is. </p>
<p>The only reason for the sub-prime problem killing banks and the market is neocon Greenspan lowering rates to 50 yrs lows that enabled the trillions in loans and now foreclosures mainly to blacks. Greenspan did this to make Bushs enconmy look good for his stupid war in Iraq this is sinking America and allowing Obama to waltz in as president. <br>

			<p>Limbaugh, Hannity, Levin, Fox News and the rest have been on to this for a week, they&rsquo;ve been talking about nothing else. It is their enterprise and loyalty to our Conservative causes that has brought this Obama/Wright affair to the MSM and consequently to the attention of the rest of America. Limbaugh may not spend as much time on racial issues as we&rsquo;d like, he may not be as racially focused as some of us here, does that negate everything he says? Not in my view.  I listen to Limbaugh frequently and it is obvious that he is not in favour of illegal immigration, the Islamists takeover or Black Racism.  He also seems to like George Bush and I think this is what causes the name-calling and what drives people to distraction. I&rsquo;m no Bush fan either, but don&rsquo;t feel the need to ridicule those that are.<br>
  The race issue is an area that is fraught with danger, the Left employ &lsquo;listeners&rsquo; to monitor Conservative Radio 24/7, and they intend to apply the &lsquo;Fairness Doctrine&rsquo; when in power which will curtails it&rsquo;s influence. We also know that Limbaugh is powerless against the Leftwing Multicult Machine, look what happened when he mildly criticized the Press for their racial pandering to a Black quarterback; he got sacked. For this reason alone I give him a little slack.<br>
I have noticed that some posters here vilify Limbaugh mercilessly. I presume they are Marxist agitators, I recognize the hectoring tone because it&rsquo;s been used against me and I&rsquo;ve heard it for over 50 years.  Most Conservative people don&rsquo;t need to resort to name-calling, insults and hectoring because they can present reasoned argument. But most importantly, Conservatives are fair-minded and reasonable people who don&rsquo;t get enraged when another&rsquo;s opinion doesn&rsquo;t concord with their own views.</p>

<p>Blacks would take this as &#8220;code&#8221; for saying that Blacks are &#8220;incompetent,&#8221; and this would be 100% true. But as even Rush Limbaugh has started parroting Steve Sailer&rsquo;s &#8220;It&rsquo;s the White Voters, Stupid!&#8221; this would mean that small shifts in the voting patterns of Whites would be needed to overcome the monolithlic Black votes.</p>

			<p>After listening to Wrights sermon, how can any American, White, male or female citizen deny that their race is under attack by organized black churches and blacks in general. White Nationalist Canadians are following the plight of our American friends closely to see how this all plays out come November.</p>

			<p>According to Jerimiah Wright there are no poor white people in America. I grew up in a poor white neighborhood, but it was safe and clean for the most part until the black migration started and now its a crime ridden ghetto. They the blacks turned it into a slum in only twenty five years.</p>

			<p>BigSteve is right about blacks.  I too worked with blacks for years and they seriously believe that AIDS was made by the US government to kill them.  They also believe that drugs are being pumped into the black neighborhoods to destroy the people living there.  They think that there is some large, sinister plot made by White people to destroy them.  This is not a few people but from what I could determine, more than half the people I worked with.  They were, as a group educated and middle class which really surprised me at the time.  Today, nothing surprises me. </p>

			<p>&#8220;I have noticed that some posters here vilify Limbaugh mercilessly. I presume they are Marxist agitators, I recognize the hectoring tone because it&rsquo;s been used against me and I&rsquo;ve heard it for over 50 years. Most Conservative people don&rsquo;t need to resort to name-calling, insults and hectoring because they can present reasoned argument. But most importantly, Conservatives are fair-minded and reasonable people who don&rsquo;t get enraged when another&rsquo;s opinion doesn&rsquo;t concord with their own views.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a right wing conservative and although I can&rsquo;t speak for everybody I think the beef is that these talk radio show hosts blindly support the war in Iraq.  I personally don&rsquo;t believe there is a war on terror and the only reason this country is there is because of the influence of a certain middle eastern country.  A country that has successfully infiltrated American politics to serve it&rsquo;s own agenda.  They&rsquo;ve tried to pound the war drums for Iran and they&rsquo;ve hijacked the Republican Party, minimizing the far right while adopting a liberal neoconservative stance.  Sean Hannity is a fake.  First there was that sick fawning over that liberal Guiliani months ago when he was using his show to promote his campaign.  I&rsquo;ve heard Hannity talk about his faith many times and yet I&rsquo;ve heard him say there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with being gay.  He used to be for illegal immigrants a couple of years ago and then he flip flopped on the issue when it became an issue for conservatives.  <br>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve heard the comment that America &#8220;may not be ready for a black president&#8221;. (But no mention that this is due to thoroughly justified outrage at Obama&rsquo;s decades long close relationship with this Black racist preacher, mentor, and advisor.) No, America is ready for a black president who is decent (e.g. Colin Powell). Just not ready for a black BIGOT as president! (And I hope never is.)</p>
<p>EVERY LINE this ignorant raving lunatic Jeremiah Wright spews out is inane, but notice how his black racist congregation EATS IT UP, jumping up and down, cheering. <br>
You could spend full time responding to this stupidity, but just a few examples: <br>
He talks about Iraq (which I opposed BTW) as being a place where &#8220;black youth&#8221; are being sent to be killed. This LIE was exposed some time ago: The FACT is that a WILDLY DISPROPORTIONATE of the casualties and deaths in Iraq are WHITE soldiers. (Blacks are disproportionately in support and logistic roles. While WHITES are disproportionately in combat and doing the actual fighting.) Actually, while white youths are dying in Iraq, black youths are here in the U.S. killing whites: Chapel Hill, Auburn, &hellip;. . (Just to borrow Jeremiah Wright&rsquo;s style for a moment, but here with TRUTH.) <br>
He mentions about America being &#8220;run by rich white men&#8221;: This is an example of a meaningless rhetorical construct. This is a free country. Blacks are free to start their own businesses and run them if they choose. There are all kinds of people running this country. And most of them, whether white or not, CATER to black racists, not whites. Blacks have ALL the racial power in this country: There is no white equivalent to the NAACP. Blacks vote as a block, whites don&rsquo;t. Hate propaganda against whites is the order of the day in academia, the media, and the popular culture. While blacks are glorified. Racial preferences for blacks is the law of the land. Blacks dominate powerful government bureaucratic positions (federal, state, city). Blacks dominate the political power structure in most of the major cities of this country. There is an endless plethora of &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; blacks-only organizations. There are no equivalent mainstream whites-only organizations. <br>
He talks about &#8220;white man&rsquo;s culture&#8221; dominating this society? Really, like the black gangsta&rsquo; hip-hop culture that dominates everywhere you turn?<br>
He talks about longer prison sentences for a gram of crack (more popular among blacks) than a gram of cocaine (more popular among whites) . But that is as bogus as saying that the penalty for stealing a pound of gold should be the same as stealing a pound of  iron. Crack is much more concentrated and potent than cocaine. And left out is that it was none other than the BLACK CONGRESSIONAL CONGRESS members who originally DEMANDED stiffer penalties for crack since it was devastating black communities!<br>
We could go on and on. <br>
(BTW: Is it &ldquo;rich white men&rdquo; who run many of the biggest corporations? Is it rich white men who run Toyota, Kia, Nissan, Honda, Sony, Samsung, Suburu,&hellip;?)</p>
<p>And notice how a parade of &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; blacks are coming out DEFENDING this Black racist minister, saying how this is common in black churches across the country and how most blacks agree with Jeremiah Wright&rsquo;s rants, thus exposing to many previously oblivious whites just how extensive ugly rotten visceral black racism is. &#8220;Adults&#8221; are few and far between in the black community: This kind of behavior is only accepted among blacks. Just like there is behavior we expect and accept from children that we don&rsquo;t from Adults.</p>
<p>Obama has now been exposed to the wider public for what he is, a STEALTH black Marxist candidate. He voluntarily intimately associated himself with this black Nazi church and minister for over two decades. HE by his own words praised this black racist minister as his mentor, close friend, and advisor. </p>
<p>Obama is an Obamanation.<br>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t always get to see the responses to my posts, but I&rsquo;m glad I caught yours 6.33PM. You present your argument without rancor.  I don&rsquo;t agree with all your points esp. about a certain ME country, but that&rsquo;s what we should all be able to discuss without being labeled and vilified, don&rsquo;t you think? It&rsquo;s a fascinating and pertinent problem with a long history that should be discussed openly, but I can&rsquo;t help but think that it&rsquo;s the vitriol from a minority who hinder civilised argument because they provide ammunition for the Orwellian PC overseers.<br>
I hadn&rsquo;t picked up on Hannity&rsquo;s pro-illegals stance, but then I must say I change my mind about some issues too, esp. after reading Amren!! I think Hannity gave up on Guiliani after he realised G was going no-where.  I too  went through the whole bunch, Tanc, Hunter, Romney, I could see Ron Paul getting closer and closer&hellip;. (no offense Paul supporters, he&rsquo;s a very patriotic guy but misguided IMHO.  Isn&rsquo;t he still in the race? ).</p>
<p>Thanks for your response 6:33PM<br>

			<p>Hillary was not black and poor and raised in a single-parent home. Barack was.</p>
<p>*Notice how he failed to mention that the single-parent who raised Obama was in fact White?*</p>
<p>Hillary ain&rsquo;t never had her own people say she wasn&rsquo;t white enough.</p>
<p>*So when he says &#8220;own people&#8221;, is he suggesting Whites said Obama was not White enough, or that Blacks told him he wasn&rsquo;t Black enough? My guess is both, but I would bet anything he heard it more from Blacks. Of course, now that he is running for President he is only be recognized as a Black man by them.<br>

			<p>This man has a racial identity crisis.  He&rsquo;s far to white to be accepted as black, and a little bit too black to call himself white (which one suspects is his real hang-up in life).  He is very bitter as a result.</p>

<p>BLACKS DEMAND TO BE HELD TO A LOWER STANDARD OF BEHAVIOR, SPEECH AND ACCOUNTABIITY COMPARED TO STANDARDS SET FOR WHITES!&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>THE ABOVE is what it means to be Black! That being a Black the bar should be LOWERED for you&hellip; in educational, in professional performance, in political conduct. Even in social matters   &mdash;   letting you get away with racial hate speech, rapes and attacks on Whites   &mdash;   with impunity. (You&rsquo;z only be pickin&rsquo; on him cuz he&rsquo;s Black. If he wuz White, nobody&rsquo;d care.!) All because your several-times removed great-grandparents might possibly have served as slaves!</p></p>

			<p>Here is the problem:</p>
<p><br>
1) Whites left Europe where they were at each other&rsquo;s throats.</p>
<p>2) On the way to America we stopped in Africa and brought the    <br>
blacks to America with us as a form of cheap labor.</p>
<p>3) The blacks have not gotten over their resentment, nor will they any time soon.</p>
<p>4) By being the ones promoting multiculturalism, tolerance, interacial breeding, affirmative action, guilt, etc. whites are in a way, still at each other&rsquo;s throats.</p>
<p>5) We are headed towards huge social cataclysms, and our human history is full of such cataclysms&hellip;so the more things change, the more they remain the same.</p>
