<h1>U. of I. Homecoming Under Racial Divide</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Megan Twohey, Chicago Tribune, Nov. 3, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The homecoming football game had just ended, and students clad in orange T-shirts were swarming the quad in search of post-tailgating festivities, but the nearly 1,700 African-American students packed in a nearby auditorium at the Downstate campus barely noticed.</p>
<p>They were engrossed in a separate African-American Homecoming &mdash; complete with its own pageant, fashion show, and step performance &mdash; that has stirred controversy and highlighted social segregation at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.</p>
<p>With pep rallies and parades, homecomings are designed to unify students and alumni in school spirit. But some black students at the University of Illinois and elsewhere say they do not feel welcome in their school&rsquo;s traditional homecoming activities, nor in the broader social scene on campus &mdash; a result, they say, of racial tension and clashing tastes and backgrounds.</p>
<p>There has long been a separate African-American homecoming pageant at Ohio State University. For the second year, the Black Student Union at the University of Minnesota planned its own homecoming events, which took place during the weekend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The university has taken steps to recruit us, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that we&rsquo;re socially welcome,&rdquo; said sophomore Ashley Williams, who helped organize African-American Homecoming at the U. of I. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to go to events geared specifically at African-American students.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite the administration&rsquo;s diversity efforts, racial tension persists at the university, students and administrators say. Last spring, controversy erupted when members of predominantly white fraternities and sororities dressed in costumes that portrayed stereotypes of Latinos and blacks.</p>
<p>And because the student body is only 7 percent African-American, many black students say they simply don&rsquo;t feel part of the mainstream. African-American Homecoming, they say, offers them a chance to celebrate their culture and presence on campus.</p>
<p>But some white students complain that separate homecomings foster more racial divisions. The complaints have swirled on the Web site of the student newspaper and in conversations on campus. For the first time, organizers are contemplating removing African-American from the title.</p>
<p>Many African-American-named events started decades ago when black students were not invited to participate in the homecoming courts of predominantly white universities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a long time, African-Americans were not encouraged or invited to participate in homecoming,&rdquo; said Clarence Shelley, special assistant to the chancellor, who was hired by the University of Illinois in 1968 to recruit low-income minority students. &ldquo;Today, African-American Homecoming is still important&hellip; . African-American, Latino, Asian and Native-American students have found that it&rsquo;s more useful to make their own activities that are fun for them and to worry less about integrating activities.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>With pep rallies and parades, homecomings are designed to unify students and alumni in school spirit. But some black students at the University of Illinois and elsewhere say they do not feel welcome in their school&rsquo;s traditional homecoming activities, nor in the broader social scene on campus &mdash; a result, they say, of racial tension and clashing tastes and backgrounds.<br>

Of course there is nothing that specifically spells out and says &#8220;White Homecoming&#8221; for &#8220;whites only&#8221;. As usual, this isn&rsquo;t about whites, but about blacks who are upset because their 7% student body representation doesn&rsquo;t &#8220;entitle&#8221;  them to run everything and have power and control like they think they should. As a separatist though, I encourage it.</p>

			<p>That always happens. My sister went to the USA as an exchange student and registered in a high school for one month. She only socialized with Mexicans, they were very friendly with her and although we are from South America, our culture is very similar. I also had a Swede exchange student in my country, he was very friendly but 3 of my classmates began to bother him for his very white skin, blond hair and his accent. He also get bored of our school system and quit the school after one month.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m all for separation of the races. At some point. this will go beyond homecomings and the blacks will demand their own schools, business&rsquo;, etc. again. It&rsquo;s the obvious next step. But when they take that step, there&rsquo;ll be no coming back.</p>

<p>Why would the White Students care? Most White People I know would be gald if Blacks voluntarily removed themselves from our events. This is just further proof that Blacks and Whites don&rsquo;t want to be together. We have nothing in common.</p>

			<p>Wonderful!  Black folks want to segregate themselves and engage in stereotypical black activities like &#8220;stepping&#8221; and various orange, green and yellow colored celebrations.  I say more power to them!</p>
<p>We should respect and honor the African-American community for enjoying each other&rsquo;s company more than the company of whites, and for (at last) admitting that fact.</p>
<p>European-American students should invest their time, money and efforts in having traditional European-American graduation celebrations.</p>
<p>Of course they should permit the black students to participate if they are race-traitor and assimilationist enough to want to celebrate European-style.  </p>
<p>After all, I am sure the African students permit white students to similarly participate in the African-style celebrations.</p>

<p>Blacks, Latinos and other non-whites want to segregate themselves and have their own culture but yet they demand Whites be color blind and don&rsquo;t want Whites to have their own culture. You can&rsquo;t have it both ways. The truth is multiculturalism and multiracialism do NOT work. People naturally prefer to be with their own race and kind. Take this to the bigger level with immigration. Allowing all different races into America will simply divide and balkanize and eventually destroy the USA as a cohesive country.<br>

<p>There is one great career of forty years of doing what he likes best, fouling up the lives and achievements white people, and getting paid for it.<br>

			<p>The most surprising thing I got from this article is that the U. of Illinois Champaign student body is ONLY 7 % BLACK!</p>
<p>Judging from the racial makeup of its sports teams, I thought the U. Of Illinois was something like 60-75% Bantu.</p>
<p>See how sports is such a &#8220;fun-house type mirror&#8221; of life - it presents false images.</p>

<p>And, Clarence, they&rsquo;re right. It is &#8220;more useful&hellip; to worry less about integrating activities.&#8221; You should try it sometime. But, then, you&rsquo;d be out a paycheck. After all, your whole job is to make <i>whites</i> worry about integrating. What a hypocrite. And on the taxpayers&rsquo; dime, no less. No wonder most people are sick of this sort of charade and people like you.</p>
