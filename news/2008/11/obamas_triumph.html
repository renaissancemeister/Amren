			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Elizabeth Wurtzel, Wall Street Journal, November 6, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When the winner was declared last night, I was deeply moved by the images of the Luo tribesmen in Kogelo, Kenya, dancing in the streets because one of their descendants is to become leader of the Free World. It would have been similarly appropriate for the CNN cameras to show the thrilled faces at the offices of the Harvard Law Review or in the dormitory lounges at Columbia University, or to look into living rooms in Honolulu or dens in Wichita as folks watched their hometown boy head to triumph.</p>
<p>I am mystified by what happened instead. All the news networks showed scenes in the streets of Harlem and Compton, on the campus of Spelman College, and in the pews of Ebenezer Baptist Church &mdash; all of which have nothing to do with Barack Obama. It seems that his win was mistaken for a black triumph, when actually it was a Democratic and human victory.</p>
<p>Of course, Mr. Obama&rsquo;s election to the highest office in the nation is a particular party for the African-American community &mdash; only a moron would miss that point &mdash; but why leave the rest of us out? Anyone still thinking straight after this heady occasion knows that Mr. Obama is to be our next president in spite of race, not because of it. The winner of this contest may finally be Martin Luther King Jr., whose dream is at last realized: We judged Mr. Obama not by the color of his skin, but by the content of his character. Why minimize the wonder of that by making this into a black thing?</p>
<p>Another point that&rsquo;s been continually overlooked is Mr. Obama&rsquo;s biracial identity. Insofar as ethnicity is part of his success, it&rsquo;s in that he is equally black and white &mdash; in fact he was reared in a Caucasian family &mdash; and as such he is an avatar of inclusion. He represents what is great about America not because we have finally elected a black man as president, but because we&rsquo;ve recognized the greatness of our mixed-breed heritage.</p>
<p>Mr. Obama&rsquo;s appeal comes down to some form of hybrid vigor. Most of the multiracial people I know seem more beautiful and talented than those of us boring folks who are just one dull thing. America itself, which is a menagerie of mutts, has been a mightier nation for its diversity.</p>
<p>Mr. Obama has consistently separated himself from the ugliness of the past, and we love him for representing America&rsquo;s future, which is spectacularly multicultural. {snip}<br>

		<p>Hybrid vigor in humans is a myth! <br>
It is a cheap propaganda construct.</p>
<p>And its of course only whites that are boring and need to be refreshed/replaced with alien blood:</p>
<p>The other races are hip and vibrant, as we have learned.</p>
<p>By the way, Mr Wurtzel is very arrogant in suggesting that Americans are some kind of morally/intellectually higher humans than Hutus &amp; Tutsis, Serbs &amp; Albanians, Turks &amp; Kurds, Hebrews &amp; Arabs, Moldovans &amp; Transnistrian Russians, Georgians &amp; Ossetians, Malays &amp; Chinese etc. etc., who for some mysterious reasons cannot live together like the multicultural, cosmopolitan and of course transracial Americans.</p>
<p>Americans, Brits and Swedes and Dutch are simply more civilized and progressive than the stupid  oldfashioned ethnocentric rest of the world!</p>

		<p>I looked up the author on wikipedia, and she apparently has made a handsome living off self loathing and self hatred, trying to kill herself multiple times, and then writing books about it, which is not to suprising given the extreme contempt she shows for her own race in this article.</p>
<p>This is the really scary thing about the election of Obama though, while his policies are no worse than the average democrat, his election has brought on this glorification of the Mullato as some kind of superman, while Obama&rsquo;s mother is exalted the ideal modern woman for carrying the child of a womanizing black male rather than settling down with and getting married to a boring white man.</p>

<p> Like most black white mixes, he considers himself totally black and hates whites.</p>
<p>Of course if my Mother sent me off to Hawaii alone on a plane by myself to be raised by grandparents at age 10, I might not like her either. If my Mother made it a point to live thousands of miles away from me my entire life, I might not like her either.</p>
<p>If I only saw my Mother every 3 or 4 years for a week or 2 I might not like her either.</p>
<p>If my Grandfather drove me to the home of sex prevert Frank Davis every weekend, I might not like him either.</p>
<p>If my Father disappeared when I was 2 I would not travel thousands of miles to visit his relatives as Obama did.</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s racism against his white relatives reminds me of a black Mayor of Compton.  He is married to a white wife, but she is totally hidden away.  Most of his black constituents had no idea he was married to an evil blue eyed debbil.</p>
<p>Obama has played the race card ever since his affirmative action admissions to Ivy League colleges.  </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see how well the race card plays when he is up against the wolves of wall street, the bad economy, a resurgent Russia, and the demands of the entire third world that he hand over more foreign aid aka direct deposti for dictators.</p>
<p>The guy is a puppet of George Soros.</p>

What that really means is that America will turn into a 3rd World shadow of its former self.  <br>

<p>&#8220;Obamas hybrid vigor&#8221; <br>
&hellip;..hey lets all make our own little hybrids hey, maybe that vigor comes from their more physical recent cultural past/present(see Kenyan election celebrations) and the anger they harbour from having no fathers(see Oprah W and so on and on).</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of the multiracial people I know seem more beautiful and talented than those of us boring folks who are just one dull thing&#8221;.<br>
&hellip;.if this is not a self hating statement, I don&rsquo;t know what is.<br>
Her parents must be very proud.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Obama has consistently separated himself from the ugliness of the past, and we love him for representing America&rsquo;s future&#8221;.<br>
&hellip;.Obamas link to America&rsquo;s past is of course white, what is he going to do apologise on behalf of white America, then accept it on behalf of black America (sounds schizophrenic).</p>
<p>&#8220;America&rsquo;s future, which is spectacularly multicultural&#8221;.<br>
&hellip;.&rsquo;spectacular&rsquo; (where do you start&hellip;geez), and if you want to live in a multicural country, move to Brazil or Africa where this pampered white b  &mdash;  -h (using her words) would not last 5 minutes outside of a security compound guarded by men holding machine guns.<br>
And if you want truely multicultural world you leave some countries white so there is true diversity.<br>
How lucky we are to have woman like this amid us. </p>

		<p>I think I could live without Obama&rsquo;s black side.  His father was already married to another women back in Kenya when he married Barack&rsquo;s mother.  He abandoned him when he was two years old, and couldn&rsquo;t have cared if Barack starved to death, and has left many offspring in the same condition around the world.  This behavior, as we all know, is quite typical of blacks everywhere.  If bi-racial Barack had been reared in a non white country he would have been treated as sub human.  Whites raised and loved him and gave him a safe home and education.  </p>
<p>Elizabeth Wurtzel is a disgustingly deluded White.  It is people like her that make me feel like White do deserve to be wiped from the face of the earth.  She asserts that Obama was elected in spite of his race, yet everything in his life was handed to him because of his race.  Even though he was raised in the White world he chose to identify with the low class racist elements of the black world (which is about 80% of the black world) and his mentor Jeremiah Wright.  Wurtzel claims America has a &#8220;mixed breed&#8221; heritage.  Name a single person of mixed race who has contributed anything at all to this country.  </p>
<p>Obama is a shill for the marxists and their fantasy world, just like MLK.  And that fantasy was created by Whites.</p>

		<p>Ms. Wurtzel&rsquo;s nonsensical comments aside, I have a much more cynical and, I&rsquo;ll wager, more probable explanation for the significance of Obama&rsquo;s mixed-race status.  His relative physical whiteness, and just as important his white upbringing, which deprived him of any of the cultural trappings of black America, made him that much more palatable to white voters.  It has nothing to do with being bi-racial as a separately attractive quality, and everything to do with an acceptable degree of perceived &#8220;whiteness.&#8221;  To that extent, it undermines the barrier-breaking significance of his win.</p>
<p>Moreover, just as there has been a racial divide between whites and blacks, there has been a color continuum within the black population.  The fact that a mulatto, rather than someone with predominant black ancestry, was elected, also serves as powerful circumstantial evidence of a continuing racial hierarchy among blacks   &mdash;   again undermining the significance of the win. See also: Colin Powell, a man who passes the &#8220;paper bag test&#8221; with flying colors, and who also happens to have been seriously considered for the presidency.  It&rsquo;s not a coincidence.</p>
<p>And as for America&rsquo;s greatness being due to miscegenation: I suppose that means Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Venezuela and Ecuador should have surpassed us long ago?</p>

		<p> It didn&rsquo;t surprise me to see that Ms. Wurtzel is an attorney; her reasoning is about as slip-witted as that of a number of attorneys I&rsquo;ve heard. A nation of mutts? Maybe, in the sense that our bedrock stock came from all parts of Europe. But mutts of mixed race? Not by a jugful. I&rsquo;ll bet if you could do DNA tests on all Caucasian Americans, you&rsquo;d find that the number with a smattering of Indian, African or other non-White blood is very,VERY limited. And it&rsquo;s been my experience that these very half-breeds that Wurtzel finds so beautiful and exciting are the very ones who never gain any real peace with themselves or others   &mdash;   because they don&rsquo;t know who they are. Like Barack Obama. Oh, he&rsquo;s smart, and slick, and all. But deep down, he&rsquo;s neither a black man or a White man. He&rsquo;s a mongrel, caught between the races.</p>

All I want is to live in the most boring community in the US. If that means I miss out on whatever joy there is in diversity or if that means it&rsquo;s all white, that&rsquo;s fine by me. I would be very happy to live in such a community with people on the outside hating me as long as they left me alone to live my boring white life.</p>
<p>Only the haters won&rsquo;t let me live in a white, boring community and I don&rsquo;t know why. &#8216;Historically black&rsquo; communities are looked upon as nature preserves that must be kept in their true and pristine form while a &#8216;historically white&rsquo; community must be destroyed. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a double-standard world.<br>

		<p>Hmm&hellip; I see that racially homogenous nations like Finland, Iceland, Japan and S. Korea are prosperous and technologically advanced while Brazil is a slum filled mess. Did 19th century homogenous Great Britain need any hybrid vigour to build the world&rsquo;s largest empire and start the industrial revolution?<br>
If any part of the world needs such vigour it is Africa. Ghana&rsquo;s Jerry Rawlings (Scottish father, black mother) and Gabon&rsquo;s Jean Ping (Chinese father, black mother) come to mind.  Both are the most capable political leaders in black Africa but that is because the infusion of European and Asian genes in Africans increases average intelligence. However the infusion of black genes in Europeans or Asians or Native Americans decreases average intelligence. Obama would have been a better choice for the post of Prime Minister for Kenya than the position of President of the USA. </p>
<p>But for the rest of humanity hybrid vigour is a myth. <br>
Check out this book on Choice of a mate<br>
<a href="https://www.anthonymludovici.com/cm_1-2.htm" rel="nofollow">https://www.anthonymludovici.com/cm_1-2.htm</a></p>
<p>and from this website on Dr. John Baker&rsquo;s brilliant book Race<br>
<a href="https://www.prometheism.net/articles/racereality.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.prometheism.net/articles/racereality.html</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;The contrast with the seven kinds of European mosquito, for example, could not be greater. Their eggs can be distinguished because of slight differences, but adults are so similar that not even experts can tell them apart under a microscope. What experts cannot do, the mosquitoes do without fail; they never interbreed. <br>
Dr. Baker likewise reports that Grant&rsquo;s gazelle and Thompson&rsquo;s gazelle live together in mixed herds and are so similar in appearance that it takes a trained eye to tell them apart. They, too, never interbreed. It is only under domestication that animals can be made to overcome their repugnance for mates unlike themselves and thus produce mules or leopons (a cross between tiger and leopard). Domesticated dogs breed indiscriminately with widely different types but wild dogs like wolves, foxes, and coyotes breed only with their own kind. <br>
Man is the most domesticated of animals and the least exclusive in his amours  &mdash;  but his promiscuity varies enormously by group and individual. As Dr. Baker points out, the Indian caste system successfully prevented interbreeding even among racially similar people. At the same time, there are individuals whose lust for animals is so great that bestiality has had to be specifically forbidden ever since Biblical times. <br>
The races and sub-races of man have evolved largely because of geographical separation, but Dr. Baker also refers to what he calls &#8220;ecological races&#8221; that evolved to fill different but overlapping niches. The small stature of African pygmies, for example, fits them to forest life while the larger Negrids live in clearings. <br>
If humans had continued to evolve in isolation or if they were as discriminating as animals in their choice of mates, racial differences would eventually lead to mutually infertile species. This would be diversity of a truly remarkable kind. &rdquo;</p>
<p>Do not fall for these liberal lies. Marry within your kind and have many beautiful White children.<br>

		<p>Since the offspring of mixed white/black parents are considered &#8220;black&#8221;, what we find is that &#8220;blacks&#8221; get whiter and whiter and smarter and smarter.  So I suppose it&rsquo;s a good thing for them - but not for the victim races, whose numbers keep plummeting.</p>

		<p>I admit I&rsquo;ve already mentioned this, but the term &#8220;hybrid vigour&#8221;:<br>
1. Is largely a remedy for [b]inbreeding depression[/b], which occurs in isolated populations with very limited numbers - do [b]any[/b] white nations have most of their population being third, second, or first cousins?<br>
2. Is only the [b]positive side of outbreeding[/b] - i.e. where the children are [b]better in some feature than the parents[/b] - however, &#8220;outbreeding depression&#8221; can also occur when hybrids are [b]less better off than their parents[/b]:<br>
Wasn&rsquo;t there a story about &#8220;mixed-race&#8221; individuals in the U.S. being more prone to mental disorders a few months ago?</p>
<p>And Jasper, you hit the proverbial nail on the head:<br>
If &#8220;hybrid vigour&#8221; was always positive, then one would assume that &#8220;African-Americans&#8221; - on average bearing an estimated 30% of white ancestry - would be far better off than European-Americans, and Mexico, along with most Central/South American nations, should be putting Spain and Portugal to shame.</p>
<p>Is that the case? I think not</p>

		<p>&#8220;Mr. Obama&rsquo;s appeal comes down to some form of hybrid vigor. Most of the multiracial people I know seem more beautiful and talented than those of us boring folks who are just one dull thing.

<p>The term mutt should only be used for dogs however I get her point. However, the tired old we-are-a-nation-of-mutts is wrong. So is the concept that diversity built this nation is wrong. Whites mostly built this nation and until 30 years ago, Whites were over 90% of this country. Whites are one race that are broken down into different ethnic groups or nationalities same as others. For example, this author would call a mixture of Danes, Brits and Germans in a society mutts or classify it as diversity. However, that is false. They are one race that are different ethnic or national groups. America built itself up as a mostly one-race nation with small amounts of others. A mixed race or diverse nation is one like Brazil, Mexico or India. Hardly what you&rsquo;d want to emultate.</p>

<p>You are so right about Obama playng the race card. He would not have succeeded as a white man competing with Whites. But as a black, he excelled. So, his choosing to become black could be nothing more than a career move, starting with his school days. Maybe his grandfather thought being black was the best bet for him, and why he exposed him to Frank Davis. (Although there is speculation an other sites that Davis is Obama&rsquo;s real father) When did he shed his name Soetoro? </p>

		<p>If you want to get a good indication of the character of a stranger or someone you don&rsquo;t know so we well, the best test is to listen to their offhand remarks when they comment on something not directly related to the crucial attitude, that they think others would judge them from. There are few value neutral words, or value neutral points of view, so people are off guard  and give themselves away as to what their matrix attitudes and passions are in these offhand remarks. </p>
<p>Obama wants to adopt a puppy from the animal shelter, and find a &#8220;mutt like me&#8221;. Of course, I&rsquo;m for rescuing animals from shelters and giving them a home, but a President&rsquo;s words always have symbolic power and meaning. Was he just being humble? Was the message an unpretentious mongrel is more lovable? Why waste snobbish mental energy fawning over pure breeds? I&rsquo;m not saying he meant it as a conscious policy statement, but considering his preoccupation all his life with race, it&rsquo;s not without meaning.  </p>

<p>Yes, the &#8220;great dream&#8221; of intellectural? liberaldom is the elimination of racism through miscegenation. It has never worked and never will work! Has it worked in Brazil, Egypt, or even Indian? Are these the countries the world wants to emulate? Maybe blacks are &#8220;breeding up&#8221;, but aren&rsquo;t whites &#8220;breeding down.&#8221; Look around you at your local shopping mall. </p>
<p>Our privileged elite have been pushing miscegenation on us, and will continue to push it hard. There are a number of websites that show people of mixed race and prompt you to guess their race. as though one can&rsquo;t guess one&rsquo;s predominant racial makeup? </p>
<p>I guess George Washington, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edger Allen Poe, Mark Twain, Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, Samuel Barber, Thomas Jefferson, Herman Melville, John Singer Sargent, George Gershwin, John Ford, Alfred Hitchcock, Robert Noyce, and Jack Kilby were all &#8220;boring folks&#8221; who did &#8220;one dull thing.&rsquo;<br>

		<p>&ldquo;Mr. Obama has consistently separated himself from the ugliness of the past, and we love him for representing America&rsquo;s future, which is spectacularly multicultural&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he repeated the themes of the MLK speech along with other tips, it was clear that he was always working hard to evoke the past by sampling it to bring along all those who had for decades been fed the MLK quotes.  This is hardly seperating him from the &#8220;ugliness of the past.&#8221;  What it shows is an almost cynical use of it to promote himself as the messiah of the movement that MLK - the Black Moses - hoped for&hellip;.</p>
<p>However, it is only three days since the election and the coming failures of campaign promises are already beginning to emerge.  I predicted to my near friends that Obama would end up doing what McCain stated had to be done both economically and with regard to foreign policy, i.e. the timetable for withdrawal from Iraq.  I think the only thing Obama will be able to do is reverse the late trend of eliminating preferrences at colleges in some states and reaffirming and enlarging Affirmative Action hiring and appointment preferrences.  What I worry about is that his taxing plans will plunge the U.S and the world into a true Depression and cause the terminal instability I have long predicted - and dreaded.</p>

<p>I disagree, Black women are probably the most vocal OPPONENTS of race mixing, for the simple reason race finds them desirable, including even their own. </p>
<p>Since no other race will have them black women are force to fight for the perhaps 10-20 percent of the black male population that is not either in jail, unemployed, or a chronic womanizer. Unfortunately for them these are the ones that are trying to get with white and Asian women. </p>
<p>Anyway this hybrid vigor stuff sounds pretty ridiculous. Anyone know how they explain the abject failure of &#8220;hybrid&#8221; nations like Mexico or the Phillipines? Does the magic wear off after the first generation? If so once we are all a brown sludge then who can we mix with?</p>

		<p>They can carry on as they like. The modern machinery which drives the world is being built by boring white men in Germany, Switzerland, France and I believe to a lesser extent in the US. Mulatto&rsquo;s may be good salesmen, lawyers and pols but they will not create the world of tomorrow. Its lots of window dressing and no substance. The Swiss for instance are considered boring, conservative  people. Yet the women of the world go crazy for them. Because they have money, stability, structure and keep their country tidy. To a lesser extent the same with native Germans. What do the mulatto&rsquo;s of Brazil have on them? Nada.</p>

		<p>Thanks aj for looking into Wurtzel&rsquo;s background. I too had problems with depression and a lack of energy (vitality) for the longest time until I started getting in touch with my ethnic (not racial  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s too general) side in a serious way. This was due to the overwhelming ideological influence of liberals and the neo-marxist left I experienced when young and naive. Once I started incorporating my ethnic roots and heritage to some extent, both the depression and lack of vitality started disappearing. Hybrid genetics was not necessary to accomplish this. Some psychologist will have to develop a theory and therapy along these lines to save badly misguided whites like Wurtsel. It is no wonder she had/has problems: self-hate and self-denial of a part of identity is a psychological form of suicide  &mdash;  and thus she attempted suicide in subconscious recognition of her half-dead identity and psychological state. Her failure was to search inside herself for the answers.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve just completed watching youtube clips of black Obama supporters and in almost every single one they&rsquo;re saying they never thought a black could be elected to the presidency.</p>
<p>But what they mean is that it couldn&rsquo;t happen, because of white raism.</p>
<p>Not once did they give any indication of all that up to the present time a black with enough intelligence, along with a liberal mindset, never existed before.  A few conservatives have but they were unelectable.</p>
<p>Too they seem to ignore the fact a black was not elected.  A mulatto was.</p>
<p>If it weren&rsquo;t for his white blood, I don&rsquo;t he would even be aware that there are 50 states not 57.</p>
<p>I think we are going to see many instances of some major screw ups that will get by his advisors, just as we saw with Bush, only more so, and his wife will be a loose cannon that they won&rsquo;t be able to shut up.</p>
<p>Too, let me say, that I&rsquo;m not going to claim any ESP, but I&rsquo;ve been right before regarding tuition, and I feel that we could very well be in a period of the greatest pre-tumultuous times  this country has never before seen, and no matter what the government does to try to mollify the situation it will only make it worse.</p>
<p>We have to get the people who were sick of Republicans through the honeymoon faze first.  Those who wouldn&rsquo;t have voted for him if we had had a viable candidate instead on McCain.</p>
<p>Then the accumulation of negative examples this administration is going to give us I sincerely believe will have us fighting blacks and liberal whites in the streets.</p>
<p>And the true conservative pro-white conservatives will be as outspoken as they can without being shutdown, which will bring more warriors to our side.</p>
<p>This country is no longer functional and has outlived its usefulness, because it has been overtaken by radical elements.  And it is these radical elements that must be given our highest priority.</p>

<p>When reality comes knocking, an occasional White will wake up.</p>
<p>BTW, Susuan Crain Bakos no longer espouses her sickening race-mixing theories any longer.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t think Wurtzel is unique. Many will see the victory of Obama as a vindication of racemixing and many young white Obama supporting women will want to have children fathered by black men in the belief that these children too might become president or otherwise very successful. The Obama victory will therefore increase racemixing further.</p>

		<p><i>&hellip;but why leave the rest of us out? Anyone still thinking straight after this heady occasion knows that Mr. Obama is to be our next president in spite of race, not because of it. The winner of this contest may finally be Martin Luther King Jr., whose dream is at last realized: We judged Mr. Obama not by the color of his skin, but by the content of his character. Why minimize the wonder of that by making this into a black thing?</i></p>
<p>Because it is a &#8220;black thing&#8221;. </p>
<p>Perhaps she and her cohorts might finally wake up and see what has happened here. The election was not about the economy or the war, but about race. The growing numbers of non-whites in America saw the election as an opportunity to promote their racial interests (and good for them that they are thinking straight). </p>
<p>The problem, of course, is that white America is not thinking about its own racial interests. Instead, most whites are deluded by liberalism into thinking that somehow we are moving into the fairy tale land where race no longer is an issue and people can be judged by the &#8220;content of their character&#8221;. For that to happen, non-whites would have to drop their demands for affirmative action, reparations, minority studies, etc. Ain&rsquo;t gonna happen. </p>
<p>So now whites in the USA wander around in a daze like whites in post-Mandela South Africa: it is slowly dawning that they are the new minority.</p>
<p><i>The book &ldquo;Rules For Radicals&rdquo; by Saul Alinsky has been Obama&rsquo;s primer. </i></p>
<p>And it should be a primer for race realists and the right in general. I&rsquo;ve read Alinsky, and &#8220;Rules For Radicals&#8221; is a solid guidebook for getting the people behind you. We need to start learning. We might even win one.</p>

<p>This is the really scary thing about the election of Obama though, while his policies are no worse than the average democrat, his election has brought on this glorification of the Mullato as some kind of superman, while Obama&rsquo;s mother is exalted the ideal modern woman for carrying the child of a womanizing black male rather than settling down with and getting married to a boring white man.</p>

<p>Excellent AJ. We do want to check our sources. I think you left out she was raised a liberal Harvard Jew who wrote a book celebrating Prosaic from saving her from her suicide attempts. Of courset the leftist media swooned over it and just had to make a movie about the drivel. One of her more recent works is &#8216;Bitter ashes of burned brassieres in a Girls Gone Wild world: whatever happened to the promise of feminism?&rsquo; This is obviously, in my opinion, no role model for young white women to emulate. I think we&rsquo;ve seen about all we&rsquo;ll ever need to know from this author. Too bad for prosaic.</p>

One only needs to look to India which is a miscegenated mass of almost every race in the world to get a more realistic view of what that world race would look like.  Talk about hybrid vigor.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s astounding that Ms. Wurzel&rsquo;s manic episode lasted long enough to enable her to write this thing. Her hybrid vigor nonsense doesn&rsquo;t merit any comment, but the following is interesting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another point that&rsquo;s been continually overlooked is Mr. Obama&rsquo;s biracial identity. Insofar as ethnicity is part of his success, it&rsquo;s in that he is equally black and white&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly true that Mr. Obama is a genuine hybrid, in fact a real African-American: black Kenyan father, white American mother.  But while he is a biological mulatto, his biological identity has has not transferred to his self-image, as  the reference to &ldquo;biracial identity&rdquo; suggests.  The three or four people out there who were not comatose when reading his 1995 memoir, &#8220;Dreams From my Father,&#8221;  know full well that Obama completely identifies with his dark side.  David Axelrod and his handlers may have chosen to promote the image of a &ldquo;postracial&rdquo; figure   &mdash;   a man whose Olympian stature elevates him above such dated notions as race, but Obama&rsquo;s own writing reveals the image to be a fraud.  Just read his book.  Although for someone so deeply immersed in delusion as Ms. Wurzel, it probably wouldn&rsquo;t help.<br>

<p>Quote #1 : &#8220;I was deeply moved by the images of the Luo tribesmen&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Quote #2 : &#8220;Most of the multiracial people I know seem more beautiful and talented than those of us boring folks who are just one thing&#8221;.</p>
<p>Rebuttal #1: I am deeply moved by the image I find on this website (Mittuniversitetet).  See link below.  Currently I am as old as dirt.  If I was 40 years younger, I would advise you, dear Reader, to read anything into that first sentence of Rebuttal #1 that you want.  But since I am dirt-old, all I can say is that I am deeply moved only.</p>
<p>Rebuttal #2: More beautiful and talented than this I know not.  Going to university for under and grad degrees takes drive and smarts.  It seems that this is supposed to be a boring white kvinnor who is just one thing.  I&rsquo;ll take it.  You can have the exciting crack heads, meth heads, drug dealers.  I&rsquo;ll take dull and boring any day.  I&rsquo;ll take drive and hard work and success any day.  I&rsquo;ll take a family that stays together and a father and mother both committed to the success of that family any day.<br>
I&rsquo;ll take Western Civilization any day.  What I can&rsquo;t take is excitement.</p>

Subject: Election night</p>
<p>Well, we now have a new president.  This should put demands for <br>
affirmative action to rest as Obama has proven that as a black man in <br>
the USA to can achieve anything&hellip;if you want to and you work hard.  In the meantime, here&rsquo;s what the media hasn&rsquo;t told you /AND PROBABLY NEVER<br>
WILL://</p>
<p>/1. Obama&rsquo;s rally was somewhat peaceful possibly due to the fact that about 70% <br>
of the attendees both in the ticketed and unticketed areas were white.</p>
<p>2. In the unticketed area (where I was) black teens turned over several <br>
porta-potties with people in them.  They also caved in the roof of one <br>
by jumping on it.  That particular porta-potty was for handicapped <br>
access and an elderly female with a was walker in it.</p>
<p>3. Calm was exibited by most of the 300,000 people because there was a <br>
strict search for booze and no booze was sold.</p>
<p>4. A CPD squad car came under sniper fire in the 900 blk of N. Ridgeway <br>
and was struck by several gunshots. 2 arrests.  No cops hurt.</p>
<p>5. Citywide, 14 CPD squad cars were damaged by thrown rocks, bricks, <br>
bottles.  6 officers injured.</p>
<p>6. Madison, Chicago, 16th St, 47th St., 63rd St, MLK, Cottage Grove and <br>
Howard St. were closed for several blocks in either direction to account <br>
for crowds.  Several businesses citywide were broken into and looted <br>
(clothing &amp; liquor stores were the primary targets).</p>
<p>7. Riot police used gas on the crowds in the following districts: 2,5,11,15.</p>
<p>8. Within the first 30 minutes following the announcement of a new <br>
president, the 7th District received 104 seperate calls of shots fired.</p>
<p>9. It took 2.5 hours following the closing of Grant Park to clear the <br>
Loop of roving crowds and to reopen traffic.  Although no arrests were made <br>
in Grant Park, 19 arrests were made in the Loop (2 for UUW); these don&rsquo;t <br>
include those made on the train platforms or subways.</p>
<p>10.  Snow plows were lined up on Monroe between LSD/Columbus; Roosevelt <br>
between State/Canal, to be used as mobile barricades to control unruly <br>
crowds.  My platoon has 6 trucks for Butler Field where the majority of <br>
the crowd was.</p>
<p>11.  Tact Lts assigned to the details were equipped with 100 flex cuffs; <br>
2 plastic riot shields and 10 large canisters (fire extinguisher size) <br>
of pepper gas to deploy /at their discretion.//<br>
/<br>
12.  At the debriefing, the bosses simply said &#8220;We got lucky.&#8221;<br>

<p>The greatness of our mixed-breed heritage? What&rsquo;s great about random genetic structure? Why is it greater than other forms of humanity? What could &#8220;greatness&#8221; possibly mean in the context she&rsquo;s using it? </p>

<p>Yup. No doubt about it. Five hundred some years earlier, the conquering Spaniards interbred with local Indians. It must be noted the Aztecs, Mayas, Incas were fairly well advanced. Good builders. A knowledge of astronomy. Some metal-working skills. In short hardly the primitives (religious rites and sacrifices not withstanding). But the mestizos the Spaniard/Indian mixture produced&hellip; sure gives the lie to that utterly stupid phrase. </p>
<p>Racial blending hardly ever produces better people; breeding INFERIOR ones is by far the usual outcome.</p>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t Elizabeth Wurtzel know that this is how the liberal media works, by showing everything from a slanted view? So why is she surprised that the media made it into a black thing after Obama was elected? </p>
<p>She quotes:</p>
<p>He represents what is great about America not because we have finally elected a black man as president, but because we&rsquo;ve recognized the greatness of our mixed-breed heritage.</p>
<p>Mixed breed hertage? What mixed breed hertage? She doesn&rsquo;t seem to know much about the history of immigration in this nation, its racial makeup, and how it was changed in the mid 1960s when the liberal politicians opened up our borders to the 3rd World hordes that have been coming across ever since.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t she know that the founding fathers who created our country were all white, and that our country was 90% white up until the 1950s? She doesn&rsquo;t know that Lincoln wanted to send all the blacks back to Africa after the Civil War because he knew the endless troubles that would be caused if they were allowed to stay? </p>
<p>A cure for her would be to live in inner city Detroit for about a year to wake her up from her deluded thinking. In her case, it probably wouldn&rsquo;t do any good. Her political diseased mindset is too far advanced. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Mr. Obama&rsquo;s appeal comes down to some form of hybrid vigor. Most of the multiracial people I know seem more beautiful and talented than those of us boring folks who are just one dull thing. America itself, which is a menagerie of mutts, has been a mightier nation for its diversity.&#8221;</p>
<p>She is out of her mind. We are NOT a mighty nation, we are a debtor nation - the number one debtor nation on earth at this moment, or doesn&rsquo;t she read the news?<br>
This is just more Cultural Marxism. Stupid, Corny, Boring, Depressing, One-sided, Lop-sided, Silly, and Repetitious.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Obama has consistently separated himself from the ugliness of the past, and we love him for representing America&rsquo;s future, which is spectacularly multicultural.&#8221;</p>
<p>If the past was so ugly, exactly HOW did the present become so wonderful? The past wasn&rsquo;t &#8220;so&#8221; ugly, and the present is NOT wonderful.<br>
All of those Races that are mixing are filled with people who come from families just as, if not more, screwed up as those who are White, or Black. In fact, one great example comes to mind. Yeah, he was the child of a Black father and White mother, both of whom abandoned him. He even wrote a book about himself, where he came off as a spoiled brat and a psuedo-intellectual - but his name escapes me.</p>

		<p>Actually, upon reflection, I noticed the same sort of delusional optimism in this article that I have read or heard coming from MSM &#8220;Economists&#8221; and assorted Talking Heads who go on and on about Market Prices, Investor Confidence, etc, etc.<br>
And interestingly enough, politically, both groups are in bed with each other.<br>
In short, across the board the, Liberal-Left-Neocon Leviathan (as I like to refer to it) is placing a huge rhetorical mask over an even bigger problem.  And that &#8220;problem&#8221; is their Single-mindedness.  Their stubborn, obnoxious, desire to impose their authority on every aspect of OUR lives.  <br>
The result is an ever widening gap between the Language they use and the Reality we all live in.<br>

		<p>Most of the multiracial people I know seem more beautiful and talented than those of us boring folks who are just one dull thing. </p>
<p>This white male is dull, boring, bourgeiose and proud! </p>
<p>This rubbish reminds me of an article resulting from a horrible &#8216;faux par&rsquo; from an Australian immigration minister (a while ago) that stated the fact that African immigrants were a little too hard for local communities to handle. Innocently stated and yet true. I need not describe the outburst from the media afterwards. A commentator in the newspaper scornfully stated that the above mentioned immigration minister wanted to &#8216;drag Australia back to the 1950s.&rsquo; Then said that he&rsquo;d &#8216;like to take us back to an era where every one drove Vauxhalls and every ones neighbour was called Smith or Jones.&rsquo; <br>
Now doesn&rsquo;t that sound like nice!</p>

America itself, which is a menagerie of mutts, has been a mightier nation for its diversity.</p>
