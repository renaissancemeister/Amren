<h1>FBI: Racist Threats Over Computer Sent by Black Man Posing As White</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, November 14, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The FBI in New Orleans said Dyron Hart, 19, was arrested Wednesday. He is accused of sending the messages by way of the students&rsquo; Facebook accounts. The messages contained racial epithets and death threats and were sent to two black women and a black man at Nicholls State in Thibodaux, La.</p>
<p>The author of those messages cast himself as a white man who intended to kill blacks because Barack Obama was elected president.</p>
<p>Hart told an FBI agent that he sent the messages to &#8220;get a reaction,&#8221; according to the agent&rsquo;s sworn statement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Repeatedly using an obscenity and the N-word, the author of the message threatens to kill more than 3,000 black people in a month because of Obama&rsquo;s election and warns the recipient of a pending attack from &#8220;a random white man,&#8221; according to the agent&rsquo;s affidavit.</p>
<p>Neither Hart nor his family could not be reached for comment. The phone number listed at his home address was not in service.</p>
<p>Colton Brodoux was the name of the person who purportedly sent the messages. &#8220;Hart admitted that he created the Colton Brodoux profile on Facebook,&#8221; the FBI affidavit said. The document details how the FBI traced the messages back to a computer at Hart&rsquo;s Poplarville address in Mississippi.<br>

		<p>You will not see this story in the Ayers-Obama newspapers.  The Columbia University Professor of BLACK stuff hung a hangman&rsquo;s noose over her own door and said it was WHITE Hatred.  The incident was captured on Columbia&rsquo;s video securiety cameras.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know if Mr. Hart is a college student, but if he is, I bet there&rsquo;s some professor behind this hoax.  Hart&rsquo;s motivation to &#8220;create a rise&#8221; might be true for him, but if there&rsquo;s a prof behind it, the real motivation would be to create an illusory &#8220;wave of hate,&#8221; so that they can have &#8220;diversity rallies&#8221; on campus, and prod the school administration for some consideration.</p>

<p>A &#8220;black man&#8221; was NOT elected president a half black, half white, who was raised white by white grandparents was elected president.</p>
<p>How can any black be proud of that?</p>

		<p>Considering how many racist incidents turn out to be hoaxes by Blacks, why is this any surprise? I hope the Black hoaxers. Like the &#8220;boy who cried wolf,&#8221; sooner or later, people will simply stop believing claims of racial threats, intimidation and the like Black try to blame on Whites.</p>

One guy sends threatening emails to three people.</p>
<p>The result is:<br>
  (a) The FBI is involved, using valuable man-hours to track him down.<br>
  (b) It becomes national news.</p>

<p>Has it been established 100% now, that the Bantu professor at Columbia hung that noose on the door, and is that what the video showed conclusively? I don&rsquo;t mean to doubt you, since it was long suspected by everyone here at Amren that she did it. But is it absolutely ironclad, without a doubt positive that she did it? </p>
<p>If so, she should pay costs of investigation, as well as all other costs, and lose her job, if she hasn&rsquo;t already.</p>
<p>This Bantu phony hate mail is like the Reichtstag Fire in Berlin. Nazis set fire to a building and then tried to blame a Dutch Jew for it.</p>
<p>Expect more of this from Bantus, fellow Amrenners.  </p>

		<p>This sort of thing is reported in the papers as racist threats. Doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s a hoax or not. The papers want us to believe that all Whites are racist and full of hate, so reporting the truth doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how prosecution works. 1. Find the perpetrator. 2. Inspect the perpetrator&rsquo;s skin shade. 3. Skin shade darker than a certain established norm? release perpetrator, announce to media that police are unable to establish a motive.<br>

		<p>Looks like the FBI hasnt been entirely taken over by blacks or this would never have come out. Obama will make certain the FBI is runs by blacks when he gets sworn in so whites will be blamed since they have to keep their base happy that the evil white man was defeated and especially the so called confederacy who they are saying is all that is left of the GOP now. What a crock. </p>

One good thing to come out of these hate crime laws is now every alleged hate crime is reported, it has to be fully investigated. When the alleged crime is looked into, the hoaxes are exposed.</p>
<p>A statistician should look into these numbers and use them to determine how many past hate crimes would likely have been hoaxes as well.</p>
<p>What we have are laws based on lies.</p>

<p>Virgil, I too still seeth when I think about the Duke incident.  However, after having done some research, it seems that the wrongly accused players did get a settlement from Duke  &mdash;  -I just wish they had individually sued each and every person who signed that petition to have them kicked out of school&hellip;only one person who signed it formally apologized.  Also, I do believe that as a result of this incident, there are many European Americans who will give these guys extra help in attaining employment and such.  And these guys well deserve it.  I&rsquo;m just furious that Crystal Gail Mangum has not been prosecuted for what she did.  </p>

		<p>There was an incident here in Raleigh at NC State a couple of weeks ago that may have been a hoax similar to the one in the story above.  </p>
<p>The day after Obama&rsquo;s election some graffiti showed up in the &#8220;Free Expression&#8221; tunnel on campus.  The graffiti was racially explicit and threatened Obama&rsquo;s life.  There was the usual uproar as the campus geared up to demonstrate its intolerance of racism - lots of earnest, distraught students and faculty singin&rsquo; songs and a-carrin&rsquo; signs</p>
<p>Since it is illegal to threaten the US president the Secret Service joined local law enforcement in an effort to find out who was responsible for this outrageous, racist call for violence against the president-elect.  It didn&rsquo;t take long to catch the culprets because there was a video surveillance camera covering the tunnel.  According to the local, very PC, newspaper there were four people observed painting the crude threats in the middle of the night.  They were identified as students and visited by the authorities.  </p>
<p>Then a funny thing happened.  All the law enforcement and university officials decided it wasn&rsquo;t such a big deal after all.  They announced that in talking to the students they had determined that there had never been an actual plan to harm Mr. Obama, so there would be no charges of any kind brought against them.  No hate crime had been committed and the names of the four students would remain secret.  Nobody in the local news media dared to ask this group of forgiving university officials and soft-hearted cops whether the harmless pranksters were black or white.</p>
<p>So the story died a quick death.  The sensitive students and vigilant faculty put away their signs for another day and returned to class.  The Secret Service left town.  The university won&rsquo;t say what kind of punishment, if any, awaits the four mystery students. </p>
<p>But the crucial question remains unanswered because it was never asked: Were these four students by any chance black?</p>

<p>Actually, this calls to attention a question this poster probably wishes had not come up.  I&rsquo;m guessing that the FBI released this information because they know they won&rsquo;t have many more opportunities to make this sort of thing public in the coming years.  They probably assume they will be muzzled and evaluated based on a stepped up scale of multicultural standards which will render the exposure of this sort of crime even more difficult.  </p>

		<p>Another fake hate crime</p>
<p>Date: November 18, 2008 6:43:19 PM PST</p>
<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7730125.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7730125.stm</a></p>
<p>Girl sentenced for swastika lie </p>
<p>A German girl who won a &#8220;civic courage&#8221; award for allegedly defending an immigrant child from neo-Nazis has been found guilty of inventing the story. </p>
<p>The 18-year-old - named as Rebecca K - had carved a swastika on her own thigh, the court concluded, rejecting her claim that neo-Nazis had done it. </p>
<p>In February she had received an award from a Berlin association campaigning against far-right violence. </p>
<p>She claimed four men had attacked her last November in the town of Mittweida. </p>
<p>In its ruling on Friday the court in Hainichen, eastern Germany, ordered her to do 40 hours of community service. </p>
<p>Doctors who examined her had testified that the swastika appeared to be a self-inflicted wound. She was 17 - a minor - when she made her report to the police. </p>
<p>She claimed that she had gone to the aid of an immigrant child and that four neo-Nazis had thrown her to the ground and carved the swastika on her. </p>
<p>Investigators failed to find any witnesses to corroborate her story, German media report. </p>
<p>Her story made headlines across Germany at the time, prompting soul-searching about a rise in neo-Nazi violence. </p>
<p>The ADL has a branch in Germany.  Wonder if they were involved?</p>

<p>It is not exactly comforting that the FBI and local police departments have joined the mainstream press in covering up these incidents when they turn out to be hoaxes.  &#8220;Nothing to see.  Move along.&#8221;</p>
