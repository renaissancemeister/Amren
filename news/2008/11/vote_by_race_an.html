			<p>Permit me a few points on all this. This is the typical racial breakdown of the presidential vote, is it not? A majority of whites almost always vote Republican, and blacks usually vote for Democrats to the tune of 88-90%, regardless of the race of the candidate. (John Kerry got 90% or so in 2004.) </p>
<p>So whites still vote along the same party/ideological lines, while perhaps a few traditionally Republican blacks voted purely on race. That 94% figure is a little misleading in light of all this; no black Republican would ever garnish that percentage of the black vote.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, however: a block vote to the tune of 88% for handouts/socialism/racial set-asides is just as terrifying as 94%.</p>

			<p>While 43% of the white vote going for Obama is not a majority, it is a massive and indismissable chunk, representing roughly 37 million people. Not that they had good reason to, but McCain would have won if 95% of whites voted for him as blacks did for Obama.<br>

			<p>I can&rsquo;t believe 43% of whites are that stupid.  I would like to see the percentage of whites who voted for a third party.  I&rsquo;m assuming it wasn&rsquo;t that much.  I am assuming if you put the people who voted &#8220;other&#8221; in with the percentage who voted for McCain, it would come out as 57 to 43 which is slightly more impressive.  And then there are all the whites who sat the election out because both candidates were way too liberal.  Once you take them into account it could be more like 60% to 40% or even better.  Just speculating here&hellip;&hellip;.</p>

			<p>For Obama to have won, A LOT of Whites must have voted for him. Sure it wasn&rsquo;t a majority but it was close to half, and more than enough for Obama to win since the rest of America voted for him too. The numbers show that White Americans were clearly divided in their choice, and white women &amp; men were basically the same in how they voted.</p>
<p>East Asians are next most likely to have voted Republican. Unfortunately, McCain&rsquo;s liberal use of racial slurs against them didn&rsquo;t help anything, since bitterness from being captured by the Vietnamese is still there.</p>
<p>Obama is the next president. Congratulations, America&rsquo;s rivals will be thrilled. </p>

			<p>Out some fairness to whites who voted for Obama.  There were a number of whites who voted because their unions endorsed Obama.  Republicans need to do a better job with the white blue collar unionized segment of the population.  The problem with McCain he was not tough on illegal immigration, which is destroying the lives of these people.  We need a pro-labor Republican. </p>

			<p>give it two years. the white vote for a conservative will be far above the white vote today for obama. even the hispanics will look for an alternative, if you look for hispanic business owners.</p>
<p>Massive deficits and inflation. And no Bush or McCain to blame. The &#8220;experienced&#8221; three year senator will be floating in red ink in an economy that is sinking. Too bad we have to suffer ten percent plus inflation to appreciate the &#8220;historic&#8221; election.</p>
<p>Gosh we are so lucky. Oh and do remember to point out we&rsquo;ll still be in Iraq two years from now with the Harvard commander in chief wisely outsmating those Al Queda.  Ben Laden will run circle around this doofus.</p>

<i>I can&rsquo;t believe 43% of whites are that stupid.</i></p>
<p>That summarizes my thoughts about the Obama candidacy for the last two years. It has a strangely unbelievable quality to it.</p>
<p>The question, though, is:  will they wise up? There&rsquo;s plenty of time for buyer&rsquo;s remorse to set in.<br>

			<p>It&rsquo;s as if the geeks at CNN and the other media outlets didn&rsquo;t have a brain, because they overlook too many obvious things when it comes to race.</p>
<p>For example, who beyond a certified idiot would claim that there might be white racism involved in this race, when Obama, his preacher, and his congregation revealed to the whole world that they despise whites and that they are anti-white racists, and that at the very least Obama shares some of their hatred, if not all of it?  Have the poor fools been unable to understand that it would be perfectly understandable for whites to reject a candidate who despises them because of their race?</p>
<p>If the media wasn&rsquo;t so corrupt it would have a category of whites, expressed as a per cent, that represented whites who believe they will fare badly in a black administration that has been involved in so much anti-white hatred.  Instead they insinuated all whites who didn&rsquo;t vote for the black were racists.</p>
<p>Much worse than the non-whites are the white liberals.</p>
<p>From now on my interest will be in promoting a community where white liberals are excluded, and if any rear their ugly heads, they would be eliminated immediately.</p>

			<p>CNN, though, is bad about changing its exit polls as the results come in.  They did this during the primary season.  Exit polls should be the same, because they&rsquo;re only taken once.</p>

			<p>You would think that by now Republicans would finally figure out that &#8220;reaching out&#8221; to black people is a total waste of time.  Ok, all you Log Cabin Republicans&hellip;what now?  Perhaps you have some brilliant Karl Rove-type idea of how to buy black votes.  Or has this always been merely a ruse to motivate liberal whites into thinking you really do care about blacks so they will vote for you?  Wouldn&rsquo;t it be easier to try to get a few million extra whites motivated enough to come out and vote for you?  Can you think that far ahead?  Or does the media really and truly have you by the balls?  Do tell.</p>

			<p>Despite voting for Obama, several liberal causes, like gay marriage and affirmative action were defeated. <br>
People are tired of the same old GOP politics.<br>
I&rsquo;ve been voting since 1988.<br>
McCain reminds me too much of Bush the First and Bob Dole.<br>
McCain swept illegal immigration and affirmative action under the rug, and he paid.</p>
<p>My lesson learned, the &#8220;Lesser of 2 Evils&#8221; will not work for the Republican Party anymore.<br>
If catch phrases such as &#8220;Comprehensive immigration reform&#8221; and &#8220;path to citizenship&#8221; are ever uttered by a GOP candidate, I&rsquo;ll vote for the democrat &#8220;amnesty and automatic citizenship for all illegals&#8221; just to prove a point.</p>
<p>The GOP will try for the center-swing vote in the 2010 midterms.<br>
I&rsquo;ve got news for them. They&rsquo;re losing the far right vote.<br>
If a centrist Republican runs for office, I&rsquo;m voting for the nutjob liberal Democrat.<br>
I&rsquo;m willing to put up with liberal democrats in office if it means getting rid of the GOP&rsquo;s &#8220;Democrat Lite&#8221;.</p>

			<p>I worked the polls yesterday, and from that vantage point here is my perspective. This election was not a political contest, it was a religious one. </p>
<p>Non-white Obama voters were engaged in a tribal ritual. They either voted for Big Chief Obama (in blacks&rsquo; case), or against the White Devils (in the other cases). For whites, their votes were either an acceptance of The Obamessiah, who would expiate the sins of their race and nation, or a rejection of him and his well packaged creed. I sensed little enthusiasm for the McCain-Palin ticket, outside a few on the right who seem to believe Sarah Palin is a cross between the Virgin Mary and Brunhilde  &mdash;  and that too is a Belief.</p>
<p>As is glaringly apparent from the above summary, whites and non-whites voted for two different and opposing Obamas. Even blacks and other racial minorities voted for quite distinct Obamas, as is shown by the numbers, and which was reasonable for them to have done. Obama is far more a member of the black tribe than he is any other non-white tribe. </p>
<p>The white vote too was sensible, but less so than any portion of the non-white vote, again as the numbers reflect. Let us never forget, despite being mulatto, Barack Obama has never identified with whites. On the contrary, he hates us, and so do his wife and friends.<br>

			<p>McCain only needed 58-59% of the White vote to win.  Exit polls showed 20% of conservatives voted for Obama.  It&rsquo;s hard to tell if the exit polls are lying, liberals playing games or if it&rsquo;s real.  If it is, it was some conservatives (I&rsquo;m betting it&rsquo;s Ron Paul supporters) who threw the election for Obama.</p>

			<p>I hate to sound like a broken record, but let&rsquo;s remember all the neocons like Bill Bennett, Jack Kemp and Karl Rove who told us that the Republicans could win over lots of nonwhite voters if they became more &#8220;moderate&#8221;.</p>
<p>And after nominating the Republican with the most liberal voting record in the Senate- in favor of amnesty, gun control, La Raza and big spending- the GOP has received 35% of the &#8220;model minotity&#8221; Asian vote, 32% of the hispanic vote and a whopping 4% of the black vote. </p>
<p>And they wonder why they&rsquo;re called the Stupid Party.</p>

			<p>The only way Obama won is with the WHITE vote. The black vote is not enough to elect anybody. No, it was not the majority of the white vote but combined with the very heavy voting by racial minorities, it made a majority.</p>
<p>Learn from this, work, and prepare.</p>

			<p>Whites 55% for McCain? Watch the MSM to spin this as meaning that 55% of whites are still racist!</p>
<p>Totally overlooking the real meaning behind the numbers: that whites are becoming disenfranchised in this country.</p>
<p>But it warms my heart that only 32% of Hispanics voted for McAmnesty, after all he did, and how far he bent over for them. If this doesn&rsquo;t wake up the GOP, stick a fork in &#8216;em&hellip; nothing will.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m with Peejay.  A McCain win would have been painful in its own right.  His loss clears the way for new leadership in 2010 and 2012 (notably, another chance for Mitt Romney, which a McCain incumbency would have set back until 2016 at the earliest).  Voting for Obama was out of the question, but there were more than a handful of good reasons to keep McCain out of the White House, too.</p>

<p>You should also look at the survey on the percent of Oba&rsquo;maso&rsquo;s within the whites by religion .. very interesting .. guest who&rsquo;s first . The only I can reveal it&rsquo;s that they voted 85% percent for the messie Obama.</p>

			<p>Whites have only themselves to blame. After bringing blacks to the country (bad move, people, bad move) and subjecting them to slavery and segregation, whites started to feel guilty about it, an effiminate emotion unique to that race of persons.<br>
No Asian, Hispanic, or even the idiotic-ingenuous Blacks, would ever have lifted the yoke from off the neck of a race that hates and will eventually destroy it.</p>

<p>What does this have to do with anything?  The Asians would have voted that way regardless of what McCain said. Don&rsquo;t try to blame this on racism on his part.  Give me a break.  How absurd. You make it sound as if he is the bad guy and the Asians are the good guys here.  I don&rsquo;t like McCain, but as a white man, this is his country, and he is NOT entitled to appease any particular minority group.  These Asians don&rsquo;t belong here.</p>

			<p>I voted for pseudo-libertarian Bob Barr as a protest vote (the Constitution Party candidate, Chuck Baldwin, did not get on the ballot here in New York).  The other alternative parties on the ballot were all wacky left wing, like the Socialist Workers Party.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that many people weren&rsquo;t voting for Obama, they were voting against McCain and his neocon fellow traveler, Jorge Bush.  McCain may find this hard to believe, but most of us don&rsquo;t have &#8220;starting a war with Iran&#8221; high on our to do lists.  No real conservative could like McCain and the real liberals naturally voted for the socialist, Obama.</p>
<p>As we all know, McCain is great at Hispandering.  He teamed up with Ted Kennedy for that horrible illegal alien amnesty, and promised La Raza to try again if he became president.  Well, looky here at what he got for his trouble:</p>
<p>Hispanics (8) 66% 32%</p>
<p>No surprise, Hispanics went for the socialist 2 to 1.  Will the Republicans grow a brain and realize that maybe they should start enforcing immigration law rather than invite more future Democrats into the country?  No, they will decide that they have to try even harder to suck up to the illegals.</p>

			<p>I went into this election knowing that my side would lose  &mdash;  the only positive outcome would be that nobody would be elected president.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t vote for McCain, not after he promised us 100 years of war in the middle east. (But then Obama went before AIPAC and did the same.)</p>
<p>So I threw my vote away on Barr.<br>
But then, we all threw our votes away, didn&rsquo;t we.</p>
<p>Maybe next time. After Obama has wrecked the economy more than Bush has.</p>

			<p>Well of course Obama will open the floodgates even more. The problem will be when there are simply too many 3rd worlders and not enough whites to pay the taxes for all of Obama&rsquo;s social programs and spending. Then the whole country will go broke. These 3rd worlders will have gone to the well once too often and will end up killing the goose that laid the golden egg.</p>

			<p>You&rsquo;re right Roller, and this is why the USA is doomed as a nation within 20 years or so (or even right now, for that matter): Blacks and Latinos vote reliably for their own self-interest (more handouts, government spoils, affirmative action, court protection, amnesty), while Whites are unable to unify here.  Eventually, probably by the year 2019 or so, Whites will finally begin to wake up and unify as they realize how much they&rsquo;ve lost, but by then, it&rsquo;ll be far too late, as non-Whites will be a majority in the country.</p>
<p>Even in 2008, our elementary schools have a non-White majority and this is *without* considering further high immigration levels (legal and illegal both), so that&rsquo;s our future.  So unless you maybe have a plum job in some actual White country (whatever&rsquo;s left out there  &mdash;   Finland maybe? Germany?), looks like the only prospect for our civilization in North America would be some kind of partition.</p>
<p>Probably something like Aztlan in the Southwest, a separate Hawaii and Guam, a Muslim Michiganstan, and a Black majority Deep South and Illinois.  The split would continue though, since Whites in the heartland would have to be separate from their idiotic counterparts in New England and the Pacific Northwestern states, whose delusional cluelessness (or perhaps self-hate)  &mdash;   a la Ted Kennedy and the 1965 immigration bill  &mdash;   has gotten us into this mess in the first place.</p>

			<p>I could never cross racial lines to vote for a nonwhite candidate and I will never understand why so many Whites are willing to go against their natural instinct for survival.  I have a theory that more racially conscious people tend to keep their distinct European ethnic identity while White liberals tend to be more blended.  Being half German, one third Italian and one third Russian, for example, might play a part in breaking down racial barriers.  Then again, it might be some kind of mental disorder.  </p>

			<p>Steve Sailer has pointed out repeatedly that, despite all the media chatter about the magical minority vote, a presidential candidate who won a basic 60% of the white vote would be almost a certain winner.  All it would have taken is for the GOP to nominate someone who was anti-immigration, anti-bailout, and wasn&rsquo;t McInsane on Iraq (moderate support would be OK).  Problem is, that isn&rsquo;t what the ruling class wants.</p>

			<p>Aside from the issues of indoctrination and media manipulation of facts, many whites vote liberal because (1) they justifiably want an end to war, which they think Obama might do a better job at, and (2) they believe in economic justice and protecting the little guy, which they think is foreign to the Republican Party philosophy since corporations fire people and send jobs overseas at will (unlike some Asians, who lower wages rather than fire people when times are tough). I also believe in economic justice minimally in the sense that we have to protect our own people economically and see that they thrive without handouts. Until white activists see the economic and class aspects of politics more honestly (how many rich white people do you think really care about your welfare?), they will forever be doomed to lose millions of white voters to Democrats out of a very visceral antipathy to the Republican focus on money and the bottom line, not to mention its lack of an explicit program for universal white economic progress and security. I strongly doubt the GOP will ever take this path; their main focus is profits, not the well-being of the European American group. White salvation therefore cannot be found in either party IMO. We first have to learn to be loyal to each other, as whites, economically, and build from there. BUY WHITE! BOYCOTT THE REST! </p>

			<p>This is all about consolodating political power.  White Liberal voters are 25% of the electorate.  This part of the electorate is shrinking because liberals have few or no children.  At some point, the minority voters will surpass them in numbers and they&rsquo;ll set the agenda then.  I don&rsquo;t think most minorities  believe in liberalism and just tow the line as a path to power.  Just yesterday, blacks were responsible for defeating the gay marriage ruling in California and Florida.  Why would minorities coming from patriarchal cultures care about feminism?  How many blacks or hispanics are environmental activists?  They&rsquo;ll render much of the liberal agenda irrelevant forcing White liberals to take a back seat.   </p>

			<p>You continually refer to the Pacific Northwest as being liberal, and this is perhaps understandable to someone who has only been to the coastal areas of Washington and/or Oregon. But even you people from other parts of the country have to have heard of Idaho. Idaho is perhaps the most virulently white power state in the union, going perhaps too far in the quest for White separateness. <br>
I thoroughly believe that the present states of Washington and Oregon should be combined, then split down the Cascade mountain spine, separating the liberal, nutty coastal cities from the dry, inland, agricultural and conservative eastern side of the states. That would throw us in better economic contact with Idaho and western Montana, and far better express our political bent. As it stands now, in both states the liberal coastal areas have the population to carry the numbers for the whole state and the inland areas have no real political say-so. We constantly resent being considered &#8220;blue states&#8221; and treated accordingly by our conservative Republican brothren.<br>

<p>You&rsquo;re right about the blacks/latinos wanting the handouts. However, as someone else pointed out, there is only so much money to go around. When taxes go up and up and whitey has less and less money  and the economy tanks, there won&rsquo;t be any jobs for non-white immigrants to come to and whitey may come to his/her senses and save this country at the 11th hour. I hope, all I can say is I hope so.</p>

			<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s time for an American version of the British National Party; the &#8216;American National Party&rsquo; perhaps.  You certainly have the skills and the resources in the USA to make a real impact.  No matter what the criticisms of populist politics, racially aware whites need a party that represents their interests.  For example, in Australia the Australian Protectionist Party is growing stronger and stronger and is forging links with the BNP.  </p>
<p>Like elsewhere in the West, there is no difference whatsoever between so-called traditional left-wing and right-wing parties.  They have all swallowed political correctness, hook, line and sinker.  What is needed in every Western is a coherent political party that can bring all racially aware whites together in a responsible manner and that represents the interests of whites as a whole.  Even if campaigning is only directed at a local level, in specified areas, it CAN make an impact.  The public relations techniques of the BNP, for example, could be adapted for American conditions.  I think it is time to move now; forget the old parties; they don&rsquo;t represent us anywhere anymore.  </p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t use Australian colloquial language here, as I realise that some of our phrases etc. are offensive in other English speaking countries; however, we have a saying in nationalist politics in Australia that we are not here to keep the b*%$#%) in power honest, we are here to get rid of them.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Permit me a few points on all this. This is the typical racial breakdown of the presidential vote, is it not? A majority of whites almost always vote Republican, and blacks usually vote for Democrats to the tune of 88-90%, regardless of the race of the candidate. (John Kerry got 90% or so in 2004.)&#8221;<br>
Posted by Silver Lining at 5:07 PM on November 5</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad to see someone else understands that. Like McCain said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s not about race.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whites aren&rsquo;t the only group to vote against their best interest. Look at the unions. Why would they vote to support environmentalist that want to destroy their jobs? </p>
<p>Why would Hispanics vote for a Black? What about the gang wars between Blacks and Hispanics in LA or the Liberty City riots? </p>
<p>Why would Hispanics vote Democrat? Doesn&rsquo;t the fact that Kennedy pulled the rug out from under the Cubans at the Bay of Pigs count for any thing? Have they forgotten that it was the Clinton gestapo that seized Elian Gonzalez?  </p>

<p>Unfortunately, Obama will probably succeed in blaming all of the country&rsquo;s problems on the conditions he inherited from Bush.  There is a historical precedent for this prediction:  FDR was reelected multiple times by blaming the continuing depressed economy on Hoover, many years after old Herbert had been voted out of office.</p>

<p>As an Indian-American, I don&rsquo;t think this was a major factor. I voted for McCain myself, since it&rsquo;s obvious to me that Obama stands for looting relatively successful groups, including whites and Asians, to provide handouts for Blacks (and incidentally, Hispanics).</p>
<p>Many Asian-Americans probably find the rural white culture of Sarah Palin   &mdash;   devout Christian and ardent pro-lifer, hunter and fisher, overt patriot, son in the military   &mdash;   rather &#8220;foreign&#8221;. I don&rsquo;t know any Indian-Americans who own a gun, for example, and few serve in the military. I don&rsquo;t think Asians overall will burden the country as blacks and Hispanics do, but they will change the culture of the country. Americans should treat all current legal residents fairly, but they do have the right to consider national identity when setting immigration policy, as every other country does. It is, of course, white politicians such as Ted Kennedy, George Bush, and John McCain, who have set America&rsquo;s immigration policy.</p>

			<p>The main reason Obama won is that we have reached critical mass where so many, mostly immigrants have voted the way they have because they looking for entitlements and know little or nothing about American culture, traditions and history.  But it is a loss of emotional connection to that American past in these people that have allowed this.  People are celebrating what they say is a historic election because it put the first Black man in the land&rsquo;s highest office, but the real historic event is the eclipse of critical mass among those who have a tangible, emotional connection to deep American cultural knowledge.</p>

Although, I welcome that this production has brought the discussion of racial reality out of the closet.</p>
<p>But face it, the Republican nominee was so weak that Republicans (traditionally white) voted for Obama. <br>
Among other things McCain did NOT run a good campaign (to such a degree that many began to think it was fixed that way or that the fella just &#8220;gave up&#8221; early on).</p>
<p>Ask yourself if Obama was the Republican and Biden or McCain or Leiberman or some other &#8220;old guy&#8221; was the Democrat, who would have won?</p>
<p>This was marketing magic as the issues were the least important aspect of this election.</p>

			<p>It will take time to sort out how the election was screwed with this time. I kept a intent, close eye on the electoral vs. popular voting and their timing. In California, before ANY = 0% of the popular voting was counted/ compiled, all 55 electoral votes went to Obama. I know,the popular vote means ZERO, in our communist, now socialist, fascist regime. <br>
BUT, you&rsquo;d at least think they would have enough respect for our intelligence to wait for the voting to come in before they toss their votes at whoever paid them this year.<br>
Note too that 6 people ran for president. What, no one voted for them ? According to the media, they never existed. <br>
What a scam.<br>
Now we&rsquo;re all on the Obama boat. I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll be taken for a crazy ride. How does everyone else feel about having to do socialist public service, in order to get your tax refund annually ?</p>

			<p>The Republican party has been as anti white as the democrats for the last 60 years.</p>
<p>It was Eisenhower who choose to enforce the supreme court school desegregation decision by sending armed troops to Little Rock in direct violation of the Posse Comatius act.  Bush has refused to send troops to the Mexican border to halt the invasion because that would be a violation of Posse Comatius.</p>
<p>It was Nixon and Ford, not Johnson and Carter who turned affirmative action from a 12 percent quota for American blacks into no whites need apply, allowed affirmative action for immigrants of every non white race, and banished whites entirely from any kind of government or quasi government job such as schools and hospitals.  </p>
<p>Remember, governments and schools are the largest employers in the country. Nixon and Ford saw to it that whites are banned from obtaining jobs from the largest employers.</p>
<p>Under Reagan affirmative action got worse.  It was under his administration that the federal qualifying exams were either eliminated or graded according to race norming; i.e subtracting points from the scores of whites and adding points to the scores of non whites.</p>
<p>And it was Reagan who designed the end of the white race in this country with his amnesty of 1986 which opened the floodgates of Mexico Central and S. America.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always nice to see our liberal enemies ranting and raving when the Republicans win, but don&rsquo;t be fooled.  The Republicans are as much dedicated to the extermination of American whites as are the Democrats.</p>
<p>The enemy of our enemy is not our friend.</p>

We are the largest population group. This web sight and others like it along with talk radio have not made a difference. I hope the people get the CHANGE they want.</p>

			<p>Well, well, well&hellip;who&rsquo;d a thought? The only racial group that actually helped McCain in this election more than it hurt him was the WHITE racial group.</p>
<p>I think it is hopelessly pathetic watching all the commentators on TV arguing about how Republicans need to be ever doing more to encourage the non-whites into their party. Do they not understand that the Republican party is supposed to be the conservative party? Do they not understand what the word &#8220;conservative&#8221; means? Well, up until neo-conservatives hijacked the party, conservatives were &#8220;conservative,&#8221; among other matters, on a racial and ethnic basis. They wanted to &#8220;conserve&#8221; the looks, features, qualities, and traditions of their ancestors by passing them on to their descendants. They wanted their great-grandchildren to look like their great-grandfathers, and they wanted their towns and cities to have deep and sacred traditions that would practically run through their veins.</p>
<p>Tell me, how can an immigrant from Mexico, Nigeria, or China ever really participate in such a society? Hence, they can&rsquo;t be conservatives in America.</p>

<p>&gt; Brilliant post and all too true.  But the real enemy is the corporations who at least by Reagan&rsquo;s time wanted to see unions busted and cheap labor imported. And remember, it was LBJ who began Affirmative Action and other of his Great Society legislations.  Nixon simply took them up and expanded them.  Also, LBJ enacted tons of new social programs, even instituded NPR - without calculating the financial impacts or eventualities.  He believed that he had only the two first years of his administration to get things done and he was so driven to be a great president that he just churned out social reform programs and other giveaways.  </p>
<p>How do I know this?  Public Televsion just ran a series on the presidents and the one on LBJ documented all this an more.  Lyndon B. Johnson, a Democrat and a Southerner, started all this.  The ironies never retreat.</p>

			<p>I believe a great many White Americans, when questioned, are ashamed to say that they did not vote for Barack Obama.  Political correctness I believe has truly reached this point.  I have seen a number of articles on the internet and in print claiming something to the effect of if Obama does not win it is because of White racism or this is White America&rsquo;s big chance to prove they are not racisr by voting for Obama.  I never cease to be amazed at how controllable people are by our television and print media.  A large herd of very moldable and malleable minds much like wet clay eagerly waiting to be kneaded and shaped. Practically begging for it. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Please ask everyone to stop buying newspapers three or four days a week.&#8221;-8:41am<br>
 I&rsquo;ve already done this and would like to report on my observations. The first thing it remined me of was when I recently punched my childhood and lifelong  best friend of forty five years for no good reason. &#8220;Ouch! What was THAT for?!?&#8221; he asked in good hearted shock and disbelief. I replied in equally amused anger and self revelation, &#8220;Everytime I call myself an ass%*!e, it`s YOUR voice I hear!!&#8221;  That`s the situation with the newspapers filling your head with THEIR spin on things. Good bye and good riddance. The other very palpable benefit is that I am no longer walking into a convience store every morning at 5:00am and placing myself in almost dailey situations of being confronted and/or body checked by individuals who are angry at the world for having to make a living or considering me some kind of enemy assuming I MUST have it easier than them due to my skin color or perceived social position. My home life and relationship has also improved due to the fact that I am not spewing anger at my univolved spouse after reading of the state of the world. Lastly, I have begun to use the hour or so either in quiet contemplation next to the pool or in an exercise regimen that has me feeling even better about myself. The one friction it has created is that now I am pressuring my better half that we do the same with the televison as well. This pains me deeply as I was the ultimate media dupe when we met and she wasn`t. It was me that introduced her to widescreen color/cable TV and now she is as hooked on Law and Order etc. soaking up all the anti-white heroics as if they were true gospel by actual living people and not a concocted script. Someone else said, &#8220;Cut the media off at the knees.&#8221; I have to a great extent and it feels like coming out from under a bad and abusive marriage. TRY IT!!!</p>

			<p>Jay, I am a WASP female and no socialist. Believe me, I opposed Obama from the day one. I endured my own (liberal) sister accuisng me of right-wing paranoia for expressing my fear that that half-white race traitor would sell us out to Africa (not to mention the fact that he stood up for the Jena 6 and L.A. rioters, an attitude that certainly indicates that he is soft on black thugs). I never expected him to lose, although I sure prayed hard enough. (I knew, of course, that God would not interfere with our free will. We get what we ask for, even if not all of us did). I was sickened by the number of Obama signs I saw in midtown Atlanta and the seat of my home county, DeKalb in metro Atlanta. I hope all of the whites who have betrayed us are satisfied. I can&rsquo;t afford to travel anyway, but if I could I&rsquo;d boycott all the states that Obama carried. I am glad GA did not, despite the best efforts of those inside Atlanta and maybe outside of it.</p>
<p> In &#8216;88, I voted against Dukakis because he bragged about his membership in the American Snivel Liberties Union. I have never had worse feelings about any presidential candidate, before or after that year, except Obama. At least Dukakis (although of Greek descent) did not betray his American background, to my knowledge.</p>

			<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, as sickening as it may be.  Obama could not have won even if ever eligible black voter voted for him.  Nor could he have won even with a majority of hispanic voters.  </p>
<p>Obama won the White House because of millions of new young,white (age 18 to 35) voters.  That&rsquo;s the bottom line. Young, white voters, pounded for years that blacks are no different from the rest of us and that it was perfectly okay to have black friends and date minorities.  Young white voters, with liberal &#8220;open-minded&#8221; white parents, mostly living in gated white communities, where they can turn on the burglar alarm and shut out the crime going on across town in the poor section of the city.  Rich, middle-class, young, college-age voters, whose parents are still paying for their every whim, who have never worked a day in their life or paid a dime of taxes.  Young voters who, pounded for years with all the diversity and multicultural bull they can absorb, who see a young, educated black man. After the black skin, they couldn&rsquo;t see anything else.  They don&rsquo;t know and/or don&rsquo;t care to know where he came from or what he&rsquo;s been up in his years on this planet.  William Ayers and Bernadine Dohrn mean nothing to them.  Hearing the word &#8220;Weathermen&#8221;, they probably think William Ayers and Bernadine Dohrn were anchors on a Chicago TV Station.  A majority of young white voters who have maybe attended church a few times or not at all and wouldn&rsquo;t know a Reverend Jeremiah Wright from a Reverend Billy Graham.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t interested in specifics.  All they knew was here was the man they had been waiting for, that their liberal minded parents had been telling them about all these years.  See black people are just like white people.</p>

<p>I agree, you have these 18 year old types who&rsquo;ve modeled themselves on the main character in &#8220;American History X&#8221; who come on these racialist sites and write a bunch of out of touch nonsense.  If a &#8216;race war&rsquo; ever really erupts I&rsquo;d give my odds that southern whites would come out of it much better than northern liberals.  The reality is that if a large group of whites ever really united as a race nothing could stop them, there&rsquo;s no way that they&rsquo;d sit by and be content to let the Mexican interlopers have the southwest, the blacks have whatever, etc.  If we used Machievelian force we could easily kick out all the post 1965 invaders and keep the blacks under control back in their own neighborhoods.  It&rsquo;s all or nothing.  However, I must say I am skeptical and think most likely America will keep on and accelerate down it&rsquo;s role of Brazilification.  Thanks Bush, you were the last chance white people had to stop this monster before it was too late and you blew it.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m with Peejay. A McCain win would have been painful in its own right. His loss clears the way for new leadership in 2010 and 2012 (notably, another chance for Mitt Romney, which a McCain incumbency would have set back until 2016 at the earliest). Voting for Obama was out of the question, but there were more than a handful of good reasons to keep McCain out of the White House, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>I agree totally.  Unfortunately, the Republican side of the Republicrat coin will not change.  I watched an interview with MN Governor Tim Pawlenty who said the Republicans had to reach more black and hispanic voters in the next four years.  </p>

			<p>I could offer a lengthy and detailed dissertation about why Obama won, and what his election portends for America. I will abstain from doing so because the reasons and analysis are pointless. There is no &#8220;corrective&#8221; action we can take. </p>
<p>The bottom line is that America is finished as a dominant world power. Going forward, the countries that maintain their identities as White nations will continue to enjoy the highest standards of living in the world. In the short term, those nations will soar to higher prosperity and evolve. Meanwhile, the United States will gradually devolve in the same way as South Africa after aparteid ended and Portugal after miscgenation ruined their society. Northern Europe and Russia had better learn from the American mistake and not repeat it.</p>
<p>In time, I do not believe that even northern Europe and Russia will survive. Africa, the Middle East, and the central and southern Asian nations will simply out-procreate White countries.</p>
<p>The smartest people tend to reach an evolutionary apex on the social ladder and realize that life is largely an exercise in futility. They learn that large sums of money and prosperity cannot prevent the inevitable. When they realize that, they abstain from having children.</p>
<p>I am thankful that my wife and I never had children. I could not imagine leaving a part of myself to face what is coming.<br>

			<p>Over forty percent of the White population voted for Obama.  Only a third of Germans in 1933 voted for Hitler.  It was enough to get both in office.  Whites created affirmative action.  Whites created the religion of Marxism and rejected both the religion and culture of Christendom.  Whites do not guard the borders of their own countries.  Whites are the ones who pretend race doesn&rsquo;t matter.  Blacks are not that stupid.  Neither are any other race.</p>
<p>Maybe we need someone from another race to show us that we are, in fact, a separate people.  Any Japanese candidates out there?</p>

			<p>57% of Whites voted for McCain or someone other than Obama, a solid majority.  The Republican Party needs to do more to attract young White voters.  I read an article that 80% or more of children whose parents are conservatives grow up to be conservative.  The children of conservatives outnumber children of liberal parent(s) by a wide margin.  Looking at the results of the election, the article was apparently way off base.  I saw one of these youth voters in the store today, a twenty something female, anorexic, in bell bottom pants, you know, the hippster type with her homosexual black friend she wears like an accessory to make her look cool.  I don&rsquo;t understand why these people don&rsquo;t realize their voting for their own destruction.    </p>

			<p>&#8220;If a &lsquo;race war&rsquo; ever really erupts I&rsquo;d give my odds that southern whites would come out of it much better than northern liberals.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you that White Southerners would probably fare much better than Northern liberals  &mdash;   as I myself opined (which is why the White Upper South, Great Plains, upper Mountain Midwest would kick out White New England), but otherwise it&rsquo;s partition.  It&rsquo;s sheer fantasy to see anything other than Aztlan in the Southwest, or something similar in Florida  &mdash;   if you actually lived out here, you&rsquo;d see how rapidly and suddenly the whole region is becoming an armed Latino majority.  We don&rsquo;t have anything approaching the population here, let alone the unity, to stop that.</p>
<p>You have to remember that liberal Whites would not only refuse to join with the rest of us  &mdash;   they&rsquo;d actively get in the way of any attempts for us to hold our own.  This is why we have to be strategic, and align ourselves in state and locals where we will be a majority.  The Southwest is gone, period  &mdash;   it already *is* Aztlan, and any attempt to stop it at this point would be a bloody and failed version of tilting at windmills.  Same with Illinois, Hawaii and New York.  But the old South (outside of Florida, which is basically &#8220;New England at a sub-tropical latitude&#8221; anyway), we have the strength to hold, especially the Upper South.  Same with the Great Plains States and, of course, the Upper Rockies like Idaho and Wyoming.  That&rsquo;s the rump that would remain  &mdash;   with coastal Oregon/Washington as someone suggested above, not to mention New England, going their own way.   It&rsquo;s already happening as we speak.</p>

			<p>5:54 p.m.: I sincerely hope that your defeatist philosophy doesn&rsquo;t infect the rest of the WN movement.  The only way for us to survive as a people is to have children.</p>
<p>And please, don&rsquo;t start up on this &#8220;evolutionary apex&#8221; stupidity  &mdash;   throughout history, the smartest people have actually tended to be pretty good at childbearing, and even today, that&rsquo;s still true in most of the world.  You&rsquo;re not at an apex at all with your thinking  &mdash;   you&rsquo;ve risen higher than the average enough to see the downside of things, but then refused to improve your outlook and attitude further to see the subtle ways that a committed people really *can* thrive.  White civilization has faced awful nadirs before, and unfortunately, many White societies do decline and all but collapse when they fail to unify and stand up for themselves (as happened, for example, to the Greek society in Asia Minor in the 15th century).  But then others withstand the test and better themselves.</p>
<p>It probably *is* true that much of Northern Europe will pull through this crisis intact  &mdash;   especially Denmark, Norway, Germany, Switzerland, Finland and Hungary.  (Although Britain and possibly Sweden are even worse off than the USA.)  OTOH, both Canada and the USA, as well as Australia, are headlong on the path to civilizational collapse.</p>
<p>But then, just as has happened in the wake of previous crises, the more vigorous White nations pull through and survive (as the 6 countries mentioned above will).  Furthermore as they see the failures of other white nations (like Australia and the UK) that have fallen, they will overcome the PC brainwashing and preserve themselves, and thus serve as a magnet for White families in a declined UK and Australia.  And in big countries like the United States, we&rsquo;ll just have partition, with much or most of the country falling apart like South Africa or Brazil, while other sections (see the Red States on the map) will basically pull through.  Thus even as some members of our civilization take themselves out, others pull themselves together and accomplish the difficult balance needed to advance technologically while retaining their identity.  </p>

<p>Yesterday I called one of my long time ammo vendors (one of the biggest in the country) to order more range ammo.  He told me he is over 2000 orders behind and he has never experienced a surge in business of this magnitude before.  </p>
<p>When there is a feeding frenzy over buying weapons it is in response to a real or perceived impending infringement on the Second Amendment by government.  But, when there is a feeding frenzy over ammo it is a sign people are preparing for battle.   </p>
<p>So, nice try Globalists puppet masters, but you struck out with Obama before he ever even stepped up to the plate.  All you have accomplished is to pave the way for the worst race relations between whites and blacks this country has ever witnessed, along with the demise of our domestic corporate and government traitors and Quislings&hellip;<br>

<p>This ex-Yankee agrees with you 200%.  Let them have New England and New York.  Although it is beautiful country up there, the folks that inhabit the area deserve what they vote for.  So far, they&rsquo;ve been immune to what they force on the rest of us!!!  Send more Somalis to Maine!!!  And, the Congolese to Vermont and New Hampshire!</p>

			<p>Right after the election the Russians sent a signal they were going to deploy missiles to counter the US defense shield.  This sounds eerily like the 60&rsquo;s Cuban Missile Crisis.  History is repeating itself only this time I fear the Russian&rsquo;s estimation of Obama is right on the money and the US will back down in any conflict.  I also fear another 60s style event that will lay waste to our large metropolitan cities and eventually lead to another national holiday and Michelle hitting the jackpot. </p>

			<p>Since the goals of the Democratic party are now so progressive, we feel that for us to field a candidate would be redundant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Where did you find this quote? I would like to point people to it, people who might reject the validity of an Amren poster. You guessed it - liberals.</p>

			<p>Please note that white woman&rsquo;s support of Obama was only 5% more than white man&rsquo;s support of Obama. The 70% of unmarried women who voted for Obama include blacks (I would venture to guess that the majority of black women are unmarried) and Hispanics.</p>

			<p>If the republicans would have just closed the borders,passed immigration reform,none of this would be even happening. Whites would forever be in power and the liberals on the sidelines.</p>

			<p>Courtney states, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe 43% of whites are that stupid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, worldwide white people don&rsquo;t have even enough sense   &mdash;   or is it instinctual integrity?   &mdash;   to reproduce themselves.  They can&rsquo;t even copulate effectively.  Does the percentage of white Obama voters still look all that remarkable?</p>
