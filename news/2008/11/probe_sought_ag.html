<h1>Probe Sought Against Judge Who Allegedly Used Racial Epithet</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Christine Dempsey, Hartford Courant, November 25, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The co-chairman of the state legislature&rsquo;s judiciary committee wants a full review of allegations that a judge charged with drunken driving last month angrily hurled epithets at police officers during her arrest, called a black state police sergeant nigger and told officers she was a state judge.</p>
<p>Judge E. Curtissa R. Cofield, 59, who is black, also referred to state police Sgt. Dwight Washington as &#8220;Negro Washington&#8221; during her Oct. 9 arrest &mdash; which was captured by police video recorders &mdash; Courant columnist Kevin Rennie, a lawyer and former state legislator, wrote in his column in Sunday&rsquo;s Courant.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nothing was said of Cofield&rsquo;s alleged conduct during her appearance Monday in Superior Court in Manchester, where Judge William Bright Jr. delayed a decision on her application to a pretrial alcohol-education program until Dec. 8. Those who are admitted to and successfully complete the program, open only to first-time offenders, will have their record of arrest wiped clean.</p>
<p>Bright said he wanted to give the prosecutor a chance to talk to Trooper Michael Kowal, whose patrol car Cofield reportedly struck as she drove her BMW east on Route 2 about 10:50 p.m. on Oct. 9. Bright said he received an objection to Cofield&rsquo;s application from Kowal.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lawlor said he is exploring whether his committee, which oversees the judicial branch and has the power to impeach a judge, will be able to view the videotape.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to a state police incident report, Cofield drove her 2003 BMW X5 into Kowal&rsquo;s state cruiser, which was parked in the right shoulder protecting a construction zone. Cofield was taken to the Glastonbury police station for processing and was charged with driving under the influence and failure to drive in the proper lane. Her comments were captured on a video and audio monitoring system at the Glastonbury police station.</p>

			<p>You would think a judge of all people would remember (even under the influence) that police cars are fitted with video camera&rsquo;s.</p>

			<p>Anyone who has been around blacks very much knows that they pepper their speech with that word like a Mexican uses hot sauce.Sometimes they call whites the N word.</p>

			<p>Drunk driving is bad, but the racist rant doesn&rsquo;t bother me at all, just as Mel Gibson&rsquo;s rant never bothered me.  Every person on this planet has a rant inside, just waiting for the right moment to explode. Let&rsquo;s all grow up &amp; stop pretending otherwise.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;hurled epithets at police officers&#8221; Although I no longer bartend I still watch &#8220;Cocktail&#8221; and &#8220;Roadhouse&#8221; now and then as part of a personal recertification process. My favorite line in the Patrick Swayze movie  is when  as Dalton he tells the bouncers to just &#8220;be nice&#8221;. The hothead doorman asks, &#8220;Well, what if someone calls my momma a whore?!?&#8221;  Dalton inquires calmly, &#8220;Well is she?!?&#8221;  </p>

			<p>What&rsquo;s the accusation, that the Black judge is racist? What kind of nonsense is that? Does that mean she hates Black people, she hates her own race? What does that mean? Even Black people don&rsquo;t like Blacks?</p>

			<p>Oh, dear, what a dilemma.  Black judge uses n-word toward a state trooper, who is black also.  What if he&rsquo;d been white?  Would this ameliorate this dreadful hate-crime?</p>
<p>The moral and practical contortions presented by this case are daunting, to say the least. I can&rsquo;t wait to read the presiding judge&rsquo;s decision, and those of the appellate courts.</p>

<p>Heheh. That&rsquo;s a good one.</p>
<p>Nothing will happen to this woman. Blacks get away with stuff like this all the time   &mdash;   case in point: Jesse Jackson&rsquo;s comments about Obama. </p>

			<p>How can we continue to claim to be &#8220;the land of the free and the home of the brave&#8221; if we continue to allow ourselves to be cowed into surrendering our right to free speech?  If government successfully censors ones speech they have succeeded in forcing a person to censor ones own thoughts.  </p>
<p>We have the right to deal with the purveyors of &#8220;politically correct speech&#8221;, because if there is a more blatantly Marxist concept than &#8220;politically correct speech&#8221; I would love to hear it&hellip;  </p>

			<p>I saw this native American comedian on one of those late-night black stand-up shows one night, he had an interesting take, he said something to the effect of:</p>
<p>&#8220;The n-word among blacks is almost becoming a pronoun nowadays.  I ran into one of my black friends in Toronto the other day and he asked me; &#8216;Russel, didn&rsquo;t I see you hangin&rsquo; out downtown with some Chinese &#8216;N****s&rsquo; the other day?&rsquo;  Sometimes they even use it for animals like; &#8216;man I was watching this documentary on polar bears the other day, those N****s is crazy!&rsquo;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Judge Cofield presides over the Community Court in Hartford. She is known for promoting responsibility among defendants while helping to address the social issues that may contribute to their behavior, particularly with respect to under-age drinking.&#8221; from  http://www.hartford.edu/daily/news.asp?id=4366</p>
<p><br>
I wonder if she has a respected law degree or if she is the product of a &#8220;racially focused&#8221; college.</p>

			<p>Why do blacks like the &#8220;n&#8221; word?</p>
<p>Because they can say it and white people cannot.</p>

			<p>If she were a white judge and used the N word against the black tropper, she would get kicked right off the bench. </p>

<p>A black caller to St. Louis local talk radio, a black woman who called herself the &#8220;Project Girl,&#8221; once explained that she was glad that black people &#8220;owned a word,&#8221; and that the only reason white people were complaining about a double standard was that they were just jealous that blacks owned a word.</p>
<p>Gee, one word.  And a pejorative at that.  Big deal.  Wow.</p>

<p>Wow, the blacks believe they own one word!  This is a major accomplishment considering the fact that African blacks had no written languages until whites gave them to them.  And just for the record, blacks do not own that word because far more whites use it among themselves when referencing blacks than blacks ever will.  </p>

<p>What&rsquo;s up with that name?  Initial, Name, Initial, Name?  When has anyone used a moniker like that before?  I bet she uses it just to draw attention to herself.  Some people feel the need to create some special thing about themselves in order to stand out - despite  the fact that they are otherwise wholly undistinguished.</p>
<p>What a drama queen.  </p>

			<p>Reminds me of Madonna Constantine, of the Columbia teachers U noose-on-the-door-incident. The investigation helped discover the fact that she plagerized some of her writing, and was discharged from her post.<br>
Maybe if the both of these women were at least civil, besides being criminals and fugs, they&rsquo;d get a little slack.<br>
I can&rsquo;t help but think they ended up with what they deserve.</p>
