<h1>Congressional Black Caucus Seeks Military Promotions According to Race</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gregory D. Lee, North Star Writers&rsquo; Group, November 24, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Before the election, the Army Times reported that the Congressional Black Caucus is seeking more minority senior officers among the nation&rsquo;s military. Translation: We want more black generals and admirals. The Congressional Black Caucus is calling for extensive hearings and the formulation of a 23-member commission to study advancement opportunities for &#8220;minorities&#8221;. The Congressional Black Caucus doesn&rsquo;t exist to promote the welfare of whites, Latinos, American Indians or Asian Americans. These members of Congress want the commission to spend about one year looking at current military personnel programs to see if they are working to create a &#8220;racially diverse leadership.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a Senior Army Reserve Chief Warrant Officer Five, I have twice had the privilege of serving on reserve promotion boards. The mechanics of selecting the highest ranking warrant officers is identical to the selection process the active duty Army uses. Only those best qualified, not fully qualified, for the positions are selected among their peers, and the process is amazingly fair. The race of the candidate is never considered and has absolutely nothing to do with the selection process, and that&rsquo;s the way it should be. {snip}</p>
<p>When it comes to flag officers, those competing for general officer or admiral ranks, the process must also be free from affirmative action politics or the Congressional Black Caucus wouldn&rsquo;t be making a fuss. {snip} To give someone an edge simply because he or she is of a certain race dilutes the process, can potentially cost lives and causes immeasurable harm to the military.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The notion of interjecting race into the selection process is insane. The instructions to the Army promotion board members are that race will not be a factor in the selection process. The Black Caucus members say they are concerned about younger officers seeing few minorities in the top ranks. I see it as confirmation that only the best are selected for these important positions. {snip}</p>
<p>So long as there are affirmative action programs, people will always wonder if someone in a high position came to be there from merit, or by virtue of his or her race. {snip}</p>
<p>Not only will the Black Caucus affirmative action plan be unfair to deserving officers who are passed over because they aren&rsquo;t the right color, it could discourage outstanding officers from competing for the senior ranks in the first place.</p>
<p>Now that a black man has been elected to be the next president of the United States, shouldn&rsquo;t all affirmative action programs be a thing of the past?<br>

			<p>When I was an Army enlisted troop, I served alongside a fair number of blacks. It was not pleasant. Later I became an Air Force officer, and almost never saw a black officer. The Officers Qualification Test weeded out most black applicants as it required an IQ of 120 or better. <br>
    There aren&rsquo;t many black generals or admirals because there aren&rsquo;t many black officers.  </p>

			<p>For anyone living outside the USA this must be the most worrying issue concerning white Americans deciding to let themselves be dispossessed.</p>
<p>If white Americans want to give up the freedom and security that comes from being the majority in their own country and let their nation become another &#8220;Brazil&#8221;  then that is their business, but the USA has a massive arsenal of nuclear weapons, and such weapons should, at least, be in the control of stable and responsible First World nations, not Third World states. </p>
<p>Is it possible that the last white general could disable them all, or perhaps the missiles could be transported to Russia for safekeeping?   </p>

			<p>Barack Obama is the first affirmative action president.  Were he not black there&rsquo;s no way this achievementless ninny could have been elected president.  Look for the military to be progressively destroyed by the promotion of unqualified blacks to high command positions.</p>

			<p> I spent 30 years in the military, most black don&rsquo;t have waht it takes to reach the top. They are already protected in an unwritten code. Many of them are happy to stop at mid-grade because they know they won&rsquo;t be held responsible.</p>

			<p>Wow, another use for affirmative action!  It would seem that the<br>
Black Caucus would back off a little with their demands because of the subprime meltdown which was basically affirmative action loans for blacks who could not qualify for regular loans.  When House members of the Financial Committee were informed by witness testimony that Freddie and Fannie were in  dire conditions because of the subprime loans they attacked the witness.  Members Waters, Meeks and Franks verbally attacked the witness and all declared that Freddie and Fannie were in great shape because of the very strong leadership of Franklin Raines.<br>
Now the Black Caucus wants our military leaders, responsible<br>
for our safety, to have a quota system based on race?  What&rsquo;s really scary is that they may succeed! </p>

			<p>All the members of the Congressional Black Caucus hold their offices because of their race, we can hardly expect them to understand that Whites prefer to have their leaders chosen by merit.  </p>

			<p>Once again we see black supremacist race-hustlers making the claim that blacks can only be inspired by seeing other blacks in the positions of power, in this case the military. A black lower ranking officer could not possibly be inspired by a higher ranking white officer, therefore we need more higher ranking black officers.  Of course these are the same people that tell us everyone should be inspired by black men like  Barack Obama, including whites.</p>

You are absolutely right, in the army most generals rose through the ranks by way of fighting units i.e. infantry. That fact is most blacks are in the rear echelon doing support jobs, not fighting. So what do these black politicians want, some guy running the whole show who has combat experience and knows battlefield tactics and strategy or some guy who was in some rear guard job who rose through the ranks simply because they needed to promote someone based on skin color? Well, I already know the answer to that. </p>

			<p>if a black man needed surgery,would he choose a less qualified black surgeon over a superior white surgeon? if the black surgeon is superior there is no problem,but if the white surgeon is superior it would be foolhearty to choose based on race.</p>

<p>IT should be illegal to have a black caucus.</p>
<p>If they can have a black caucus then there should also be a white caucus.</p>
<p>More proof of white stupidity.  Absolute insanity.</p>

			<p>Svigor,</p>
<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t be using such language on this board. It doesn&rsquo;t make any difference if most people don&rsquo;t know what your referring to. Clean it up Sir.</p>
<p>As far as the blacks getting to be Generals and Admirals, it doesn&rsquo;t matter anymore. The die is cast and we&rsquo;re going to have to fight this thing out and if the other side has a bunch of jokers running the show, all the better for us.</p>

			<p>&#8220;They want quotas for black generals and admirals.&#8221;</p>
<p>AA for housing regardless of ability to pay resulted in an economic crash that had a domino effect that circled the globe, and it has yet to enter its most devastating stage, which could well result in the total collapse of many nations.</p>
<p>AA in the military is already underway.  Blacks unqualified for their positions are already being given privileges not available to whites and others.  There are now black officers who couldn&rsquo;t qualify for NCO status who are so inept they more likely than not would call artillary fire down on their own positions, because they can&rsquo;t grasp the necessary fundementals of map reading and artillary functions, among many other things.</p>
<p>This recent push to get more unqualified blacks into higher echelon positions will result in a catastrophe that will be the military&rsquo;s answer to the sub-prime crash, only this time thousands of lives will be lost and very likely crucial battles that could well ruin the military and turn it into a third world type Zimbabwe, because whites will shun it like the plague. </p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t it the Zimbabwe or South African air force that had a black pilot who hit the ejection button, before releasing the cockpit cover and wound up a dark spot on the ceiling, and didn&rsquo;t another land his plane without putting the wheels down and both incidents were blamed on white racism?</p>
<p>With Obama in it&rsquo;s going to be an absolute circus of freaks.  <br>

			<p>Well, let&rsquo;s look at the bright side. Many people have predicted the military will fracture along racial lines as the breakup of the USA begins; having incompetent affirmative-action officers leading the black factions will make destroying them a whole lot easier.</p>
<p>Like Cliff Yablonski, I was in the USAF (though as an enlisted man), and also saw almost no black officers (and few black senior NCOs). A black E-5 at my 1st duty station left for OTS not long after my arrival, but our paths never crossed again, so assuming he graduated I never met him as a lieutenant.</p>

			<p>Another suicidal insane idea which the the whites voluntary hold themselves hostage to.  The Chinese and Japanese would never submit to having blacks represent or hold key positions in their country least of all a massive import of inferior genes.  The blacks in Africa cannot do a damm thing when they have to perform on their own.  Obama only saving grace is the white genes propping him up.  The most present pressing issue for this country is what is the breaking point before it ceases to exist as an advanced civilization.  The present path points toward non-existent of the Western Civilization as the inferior genes become the majority.  Everything becomes third rate   &mdash;   morality, technology, education, standard of living, etc. when secondary (inferior) genes become the majority.  The secondary genes will also suffer when they become the majority in any society.  But this is against the natural order of things in the Universe.  The ONLY solution is selective breeding.  Breeding of the secondary genes only in accordance to need of menial labor.  Future generations have quite a challenge on their hands! </p>

			<p>The black political agenda always was and always will be quotas and handouts.  The black political agenda can only be achieved with the cooperation of Whites.  We must stop cooperating with our own destruction.</p>
<p>To get an honest view of the black mentality, search for &#8220;Peggy Joseph&#8221; on YouTube.  She&rsquo;s the black version of &#8220;Joe the Plumber&#8221;.</p>

			<p>&#8220;So long as there are affirmative action programs, people will always wonder if someone in a high position came to be there from merit, or by virtue of his or her race. &#8220;</p>
<p>I remember once at Ft Hood Texas standing in line next to the 1st Cav Provost Marshal. He was a  Black Colonial, probably in his early 50&rsquo;s graying hair on  his temples. It was late in the afternoon. Even though he was relaxed standing in line, his whole persona radiated military bearing and confident. His fatigues were just as well creased as if he had just put them on. I thought to myself, he got to that position despite the fact that he was Black.  He certainly made an impression on this young White private. That was over 30 years ago.</p>
<p>Another time I saw two young Black Lieutenants that worked in finance. They were outside on break I believe. They were &#8220;shucking and jiving&#8221; like they were back in the &#8220;hood&#8221; no military bearing whatsoever. I thought to myself, they got that position because they were Black. Again they made an impression on this young White private, but it was not a good impression. It was also 30 years ago.</p>
<p>Lesson from Nam. There are 3 types of officers in the military:<br>
1) Those you die for.<br>
2) Those you die with<br>
3) Those you frag.</p>

			<p><i>They want quotas for black generals and admirals. </i></p>
<p>How about quotas on welfare dollars, the so-called &#8220;tax credits&#8221; (another form of welfare), and other forms of public assistance for the poor: 60% of the total should be reserved for whites and only 12 % for blacks because of the share they have in the general population. In other words, for every black receiving a $14,000 a year of welfare there should be about five whites receiving the same, and so on. Otherwise, we will resort to the &#8220;no justice, no peace&#8221; option.</p>

			<p>Blacks are unable to advance based on their intelligence and personal merit. Therefore, they require the assistance of Whites to stand aside, waive the standards, and allow them to pass without a challenge. Otherwise, they will fail.</p>
<p>The stock markets, housing markets, and financial markets reflect the burden that Blacks place on society. Those are the facts.</p>

			<p>This kind of thing makes the news on AmRen every year of so. What the articles never discuss is whites being underrepresented in the NCO ranks. Being there are more Non-commissioned than commission officers in the military, one could say it&rsquo;s a bigger problem. The black caucus seems to have a limited field of vision too.  </p>

			<p>The US is too isolated.</p>
<p>Why does no one point out that race quotas in education and hiring are used practically nowhere else but the US? (they are not used in Europe, for example.) </p>
<p>I live in Germany, which is supposedly left, green, and multiculti, etc., but no one here can even imagine AA as a way of life!</p>
<p>As for the tone of this page, it is often rancorous &amp; vicious, long since out of control, a place for haters to let off steam.</p>
<p>Not &#8220;blacks are all morons,&#8221; but instead: &#8220;merit instead of quotas will allow talented blacks, whites, and everyone else to really shine&#8221;</p>

			<p>I am a white South African (also known as a Afrikaner) and would like to make a few comments out of first hand experience. From 1994 when our country had our first &#8220;democratic&#8221; elections, affirmative action was implemented with vigour by the &#8220;democraticaly&#8221; elected black government. The result?? I will list them for you so that you Americans know what is in stall for you:</p>
<p>&gt; a lame, pathetic defence and police force riddled with incompetent, worthless blacks appointed only because their skin colour is black. Competency flew out of the window, as long as you are black you get appointed to fill the quota&rsquo;s Most(competent)whites left or where forced to leave for greaner pastures</p>
<p>&gt;a once excellent and working publice service reduced to rubble for the same reason</p>
<p>&gt;a once excellent and working health service recuced to rubble for the same reason</p>
<p>&gt;a once excellent and working electricity generating capability reduced to rubble for the same reason. For many years the few competent whites left over in our electricity generating industry (after most whites where &#8220;affirmatised&#8221; out of their jobs)tried to tell the newly appointed blacks to build more power stations, they where ignored. Now this country has immense capacity problems.</p>
<p>White farmers are attacked, their wifes and daughters killed and/or raped, or tortured to death. Over 3000 white farmers and their families have been killed since 1994. In addition to this white farmers are forced to sell their farms to blacks so that they can try their hand at farming. It is a formally stated goal of the black government to return land to &#8220;the people&#8221;. This all means that within a few years our country will have food shortages.</p>
<p>If you are white and do business with either government or other private companies they won&rsquo;t even speak to you if you don&rsquo;t have a &#8220;black business partner/s&#8221;. The fact that this &#8220;black partner&#8221; contributes more or less nothing to your business doesn&rsquo;t matter, as long as he is black. All of this is enforced by law.</p>
<p>Since 1994 over 1 000 000 whites have left South Africa, because of the above. Unfortunately the Western world is brainwashed by liberal news agencies over the true situation in South Africa. </p>
<p>I know that America also implemented affirmative action in the 60&rsquo;s (or was it the 70&rsquo;s?)Luckily for you it didn&rsquo;t bite so much because blacks only make up 10% of your population and I guess it wasn&rsquo;t really &#8220;pushed&#8221; very hard.</p>
<p>Now it will definately change with your first &#8220;black&#8221; or as you say &#8220;african american&#8221; president. African Americans, hispanics etc. etc. will increasingly &#8220;demand&#8221; their &#8220;share&#8221; in the American economy. With an african american president, how can he refuse? You will be told by your liberal media (as our&rsquo;s told us)not to worry &gt; standards won&rsquo;t drop, it will lead to a &#8220;better&#8221; country, ethnic and racial conflict will subside, etc etc etc. You will eventually realise that everything are actually going the opposite way, not as your liberal politicians and media predicted.</p>
<p>I predict that America will go the same way as South Africa. So if you wan&rsquo;t to know to know your future just follow the news about South Africa.(But not from liberal news websites!!)</p>

			<p>&#8220;That fact is most blacks are in the rear echelon doing support jobs, not fighting. So what do these black politicians want, some guy running the whole show who has combat experience and knows battlefield tactics and strategy or some guy who was in some rear guard job who rose through the ranks simply because they needed to promote someone based on skin color? Well, I already know the answer to that.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have to stand up for our support troops in the rear.  The job they do is vital to success.  Tactical mistakes can be overcome but logistical mistakes are unforgiving.  That being said, the top leadership positions should go to those who have led combat units and blacks do tend to shun these positions.  I remember times when I would have to deal with finance and every other person in their office was black.  This was a much higher ratio than what we had in the infantry.  No wonder our pay was always screwed up.</p>

			<p>It seems that the more whites bend over backwards to placate and please blacks the more blacks hate whites.  Blacks commit far more hate crimes against whites than whites against blacks but the media focuses almost exclusively on white crimes. White guys are almost always the bad guys on TV while  blacks and black families are the solid guys and the families are right out of Norman Rockwell.  Also an earlier poster talked about congress allowing a  Black Causus while a White Causus would be deemed racist.  The same for Black Colleges.  We are almost in a depression because of the affirmative action loans.  Carter started the CRA and Clinton put it on steroids by threating banks who would not grant AA loans. And OBama and ACORN sued to enforce the granting of these outrageous loans. Now the government is again bending over backwards to allow the recipients of these loans to remain in the houses they still cannot afford.  And still the blacks hate the white devils.  Now AA for generals?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know about that. I spent years on German soil and I think they would have been a lot happier if we Americans had just went home and taken our blacks with us. Most Germans years ago were not that happy about being invaded but they did get all the fight kicked out of them. What we are trying to avoid here in the US is becomming complacent like the Europeans. </p>

<p>&#8220;80 brothers and 2 white guys?&#8221;  For the 82nd Airborne Division?<br>
Nonsense. That sounds like the same old baseless lies they love to share in the hood.  </p>
<p>The 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg is where I took my airborne training, and, although it was several years after the war, I know for a fact the white to black ratio was about the same during the Vietnam era, which is to say about 10 to 1, or, perhaps 12 to 1.  Something in that neighborhood.  Just look at the photos of the various units during any era and see for yourself.</p>
<p>First of all, the 82nd wasn&rsquo;t sent to Vietnam until 1968 after the Tet offensive as a back up force to other units and was there only about a year.  Secondly, that ratio held true for other airborne units as well, such as the 173rd Airborne Brigade, and the 101st Airborne Division. </p>
<p>The 82nd&rsquo;s claim to fame was when they were sent to Detroit in July, 1967 to help quell the black riots there. </p>
<p>The LRRP units (Long Range Recon Patrol) had far fewer blacks and it was rare to see any as team leaders although there were a few.  Those that completed training at the prestigious RECONDO school of advanced ranger training were few and far between.  Very few and very far between.  That holds true for Special Forces, as well.</p>
<p>There was black/white tensions always at play, and more than a few fights in Vietnam, (Hispanics usually on the white side) and often it was the black &#8220;attitude&#8221; responsible for them.  Not much is known to the general public about those incidents, but has the MSM EVER reported any differently, afraid they will show the cracks in their multiracial utopia?</p>

			<p>What must our military think of our civilian government?</p>
<p>More to the point, they control the real power in the US.  They obey the civilian government out of choice&hellip;.because they are dedicated to the welfare and well being of our country.</p>
<p>But it is becoming increasingly obvious that neither the majority of civilians nor our elected officials share this devotion.  In fact, there is a TON of evidence that an evil conspiracy is afoot to destroy our way of life and kill a large number of our citizens (or perhaps people missed the FBI agent testimony about the Weather Undergrounds plans to exterminate 30 million conservative whites once they took over the government&hellip;.something they have succeeded in doing recently).</p>
<p>What I am getting at is the US is very high risk for a military coupe&hellip;..especially if it comes out that Obama is not eligible to be president and isn&rsquo;t removed.</p>
<p>Think about it.</p>

Maybe so, but only one brigade of the 82nd went to Vietnam, and they didn&rsquo;t stay for too long.  The entire 101st Airborne went over, and stayed for about four years.  Maybe volunteering for the 82nd was a good way to stay in North Carolina?  </p>

			<p>Until scientists, educators, institutional leaders and public officials are willing to admit publicly (what they know privately) that because of the relatively low average IQ of blacks they will naturally be underrepresented in cognitively demanding professional positions (including military brass) blacks groups will forever be causing trouble demanding affirmative action to the detriment of such professions.  </p>
<p>The <b> 2% Rule </b> is that if any cognitively demanding profession has more than 2 % of its personnel of black sub-Saharan descent then that profession is most likely engaging in anti white and Asian hiring discrimination. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Given the unequal distribution of the requisite cognitive skills, and the relative numbers of blacks and whites of suitable ages in the American population, the appropriate calculations are straightforward. Only about 2% or less of the intellectually qualified are black.&rdquo; - https://www.lrainc.com/swtaboo/late/gw01.html <br>

<p>Should the stat be 2% of the qualified, or 2% of blacks?  The latter is 2 standard deviations, or IQ 115.  If blacks are 14% of the population, then the stat should be .02 X .14 or 0.28%.  This is about 1 of 360.  Thus, of a (large) group of qualifieds, 1 of 360 could be black- far less than 2%.</p>

Right after WW2 &#8220;black&#8221; political representation offered city burning and riots as an alternative to arm forces intigration. Truman capitulated. Yes the same man who dropped the bomb, knuckled under to political correctness. And then the blacks burned the cities under Johnson just for good measure.</p>

<p>Those units weren&rsquo;t exceptionally high performing units during the Viet-Nam war, because of the blacks. 82nd and the 101 were filled with draft fodder who were resentful of being there and their performance dragged down the really good men in those units (don&rsquo;t recall women being there with us then) who usually got out of the units into SF or Rangers. The performance of those units there was by sheer numbers poured into them during that fight which became a war of attrition for us. I have always felt, and still do, that if all of the units of all in the military had the same training as the SF units had, losses would have been far less.</p>

<p>Please excuse my commenting so much on the Viet-Nam war but I spent 3 1/2 years in it and know LOTS! about it from wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy behind enemy lines to the real combat areas of trying to get supplies out of the black market dealing, blacks in Saigon and Bangkok. All of the black market dealings we found had the usual ghetto black hustlers in the lower echelons and some ruthless white senior NCO running the program. We never went unarmed to ask for supplies, people simply disappeared in Viet-Nam and Bangkok. I will also say that the work done by the honest troops in logistics and supply is much underappreciated and I personally thanked them when they were able to help which includes my dealings with those people here in the middle east fight. THANKS GUYS</p>

			<p>There is no other group in congress more feared than the CBC, they vote as a bloc, use tactics which would be considered unbecoming anywhere but in congress, and of course, the always present threats of racism, they get anything they want, a bill they sponsor is nearly always passed, they load bills w/pork for their districts. CBC members always have the largest staffs, some use limousines for transportation, have family members on their staff, get most sought after offices, rarely turned down for committee chairman, and none of their activities or spending is ever questioned, and yes, B.O. is a member.</p>

<p>I agree. Blacks, Hispanics, and Muslims should not be responsible for rendering critical decisions at any level. When they are allowed to make decisions, the outcomes reflect conditions experienced in Africa, Mexico, and the Middle East&hellip;</p>

			<p>Interesting development from several standpoints.  Affirmative action can only work within a controlled system which is &#8220;gamed&#8221; to protect blacks.  But that system only exists within the larger framework of the western nations who agree to abide by those rules.  Once affirmative action is carried outside this sphere, it no longer becomes operable.  By endangering white troops, or making life for them unbearable, the US military continues to deteriorate in the face of hostile forces abroad.  It will be very interesting to see how nations like Russia and China will react.  They are certainly under no compunction to cede the advantage to black led military forces.  At what point will whites realize they have squandered our security?  And what will whites be willing to do to redress a future crisis?  Inquiring minds want to know.</p>

<p>Are you sure that wasn&rsquo;t McCain?</p>
<p>&#8220;or every black receiving a $14,000 a year of welfare there should be about five whites receiving the same, and so on.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are, only it isn&rsquo;t equally distributed;  there are a few thousand whites who take their welfare payments in $10,000,000 increments.</p>

			<p> Several years ago I was watching c-span and they had a retired black, female general on there . The subject apparently was about jobs with corporations and she was saying,&#8221; it does not matter how well or efficiently you do your job but how well you are liked by your fellow employees, management etc. &#8221; And I thought, what complete idiot logic, that would leave the door wide open for the worst kind of discriminations against any employee who might happen to not be accorded minority status or refuse to bow to political correctness . But minorities are indeed making great strides with such stupid assertions that it is really frightening . When they finally manage to completely disfranchise whites I have to  wonder, what the heck is going to become of us ? Our children ? Our grand children ? We will literally be strangers in our own land .The possibilities of being hounded, stonewalled,even hunted because you are white and refuse to parrot the current PC line all of a sudden become all too real .</p>

Actually, what she said was absolutely true.  You&rsquo;ll find it&rsquo;s so when you get out there in the corporate jungle and experience real life in the real world.  It&rsquo;s unfortunate, and sounds cynical,  but it&rsquo;s  simply the truth.   It&rsquo;s not the way life is SUPPOSED  to be, but it&rsquo;s reality.  Having considerable experience  in the corporate world,  I can confirm her statement from my own observations. I&rsquo;ve seen it many times.  Employees are dependent on those above them for assignments, promotions, etc. You could be the most efficient, conscientious employee in the world, but you will sit there unrecognized and passed over if your bosses don&rsquo;t like you or don&rsquo;t  even notice you. Don&rsquo;t assume that everything works so efficiently as it&rsquo;s supposed to!  There&rsquo;s the ideal way, and then there&rsquo;s the real way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the guys who  go drinking with the boss or the women who have nice shapes, know how to flirt, and are flashy dressers who get all the attention -  and  thus the promotions.   And that&rsquo;s how it is. That lady was  just recognizing a basic fact. </p>
<p>In one  place where I worked, the boss was obsessed with baseball. The baseball team was his pet hobby. It was a well known joke, but practically a fact,  that you had to join the baseball team to get a promotion; and you had to hit a  home run to get a raise. At least, that certainly helped in getting his attention. And for women to catch his attention, refer to what I said above about flashy dressers and flashy personalities.</p>
<p>Ever see the musical &#8220;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&#8221;?   It portrayed a young man&rsquo;s meteoric rise in the corporate world.  It was purely a comedy, of course, but it was based on semi-truths that we can all recognize.  He found ways to catch the attention of management and he buttered up those above him   &mdash;   with spectacular results.  (He flattered the CEO&rsquo;s homely secretary; he found out the CEO&rsquo;s private hobby -  knitting - so he took up knitting&hellip;  etc.)</p>
<p>Unless you&rsquo;re in a system where advancement is based upon  abstractions such as  tests, attendance, performance, you&rsquo;re otherwise going to be dependent on the good will of management. If you don&rsquo;t suck up to them, you&rsquo;re going to be passed over by those who do.  But in the real world people don&rsquo;t get promoted by computers, they get promoted by other people.   Until computers replace bosses, there will always be favoritism. </p>

			<p>Go ahead, give the high up positions to AA&rsquo;s.  They will mess it up big time, just like everything else they get.<br>
Obama. What a joke! He could not have made it thru Boot Camp, let alone A School!<br>
I recieved an uppity letter from a female AA Officer once.<br>
She went on bragging and boasting about being a Mother and an Officer too!<br>
I made her beyond livid when I asked her what she did with her children while she was in the Military all those days and hours, overseas no less.<br>
After prodding her a bit, she finally admitted, her Mother had raised all her children for her&hellip;<br>
Wow! What an acomplishment.  Dump the kids on Grandmaw that already raised her kids, run off and brag about yourself.<br>
I had no respect for her after that.<br>
She never wanted to corrospond with me again.<br>
Takes more character to raise fine children than use Affirmative Action pushiness to climb a success ladder that won&rsquo;t mean a thing when she&rsquo;s old and crochety.  But her kids will be important then.<br>
Sooner or later, White&rsquo;s are going to rise up off their recliner chairs and say, &#8216;Enough is enough!&rsquo;.<br>
Keep on forcing this American Minority double-standard, unbalanced, biased, Affirmative Action on us.<br>
Take away our freedom of speech, our 2nd Amendments.  Do whatever it takes to Awaken and motivate the people to take back their country and return it to the forefathers ideals.<br>
Yes, go ahead promote bafoons.  Let them wreck things real good.<br>
Obama&rsquo;s approval rating in 2 years time will probably be around 20%, just his AA&rsquo;s will still love him, oh, because he&rsquo;s Black you know!<br>

			<p>12-1,12:13pm, that lady had an agenda .And it was primarily to secure a method of enfranchising her people at the expense of whites .She wasn&rsquo;t just seeing things as they are, she was advocating it .It was a well organized plan for cracking the so called good ol boy system and bringing it down,then replacing it with an Afro-centric one .It would neutralize unions and the good work ethic and education that whites tend to possess in one vicious swipe . I also have some experience in corporate America from the blue-collar side, and it did not used to be this way, at least not in the south .Once in a meeting with our yuppie manager, who at first accused me of paranoia,to which I replied,what the company wants is disposable employees .They demand loyalty out of the employee and yet they are not loyal to the employee .He finally lowered his head and admitted,&#8221;you&rsquo;re right.&#8221; But it did not used to be that way, not down here .A straightened head and keeping your nose to the grinding stone would get where you needed to go .   </p>

			<p>One can&rsquo;t be an admiral or general without having served in the combat units.</p>
<p>Blacks refuse to serve in the combat units and prefer the rear echelon support units where they can do like the affirmative action civil servants, goof around all day, harass the women, yak on the phone etc.</p>
<p>But it will be done.  We will soon have the same incompetent, disfunctional affirmative action generals and officers that have ruined every city and government agency in control of affirmative action blacks.</p>
<p>When we lose every war and skirmish we won&rsquo;t learn the lesson.  We will still employ the same incompetent affirmative action blacks.</p>
<p>Why do you thing the department of defense is using so many civilian military contractors like blackwater etc?  It is because the black, hispanic and female military is already disfunctional.</p>
<p>The military contractors are skilled, qualified and more than competent to do the job. They are white male organizations. That is why the department of defense employers them.  They can get the job done.</p>
<p>In the near future, the military will be nothing more than a training and screening program for the whites who go on to work for the private military contractors like blackwater.</p>

			<p>I cannot imagine many whites following the orders of a communist black illegitimate &#8220;Commander in Chief&#8221; who hates whites and would like nothing better than getting as many whites killed as possible.  </p>
<p>After all, it is the whites that fill the vast majority of combat roles while blacks and hispanics work safe behind the lines support jobs&hellip;</p>

			<p>I own and operate a security service here in Canada. It has been quite a challenge trying to find good employees, as most whites are employed in the oil &amp; gas industry and other high paying jobs. The most common applicants we get are Muslims, East Indians and Africans, mainly claiming to be  &#8220;students&#8221;. My experience in employing them has been largely negative to say the least; here are a few examples:</p>
<p>1. Almost a complete lack of personal hygene (unshaven, unshowered, etc)<br>
2. Uniform never dry cleaned and in a filthy condition <br>
3. Neglecting their duties and praying to Mecca on the job<br>
4. Harassing white female employees - unwelcome sexual advances and physically touching them.<br>
5. Unwilling to follow orders<br>
6. Cannot fill out reports or log entries correctly<br>
7. Not doing basic rounds or patrols<br>
9. Caught frequently sleeping on the job</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you try to discipline them, they run to a &#8220;human rights&#8221; lawyer and try to sue you over &#8220;cultural insensitivity&#8221; or just plain racial discrimination. Thankfully, I have managed to gwet rid of the majority of these time wasters, and i am now consdierably more selective in whom I employ.  </p>
