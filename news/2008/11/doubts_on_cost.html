<h1><a href="http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,24638908-661,00.html">Doubts on Cost of Guest Worker Scheme</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ben Packham, Herald Sun (Melbourne), November 12, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>TAXPAYERS will pay almost $10,000 for every unskilled Pacific islander brought to Australia under a new guest worker scheme.</p>
<p>Figures buried in the Federal Government&rsquo;s latest economic update show the trial scheme to import 2500 rural workers will cost $23.6 million over four years.</p>
<p>The same document revealed the number of jobless Australians is tipped to rise by about 110,000 by June 2010 as unemployment reaches 5.75 per cent.</p>
<p>Immigration Minister Chris Evans recently said the overall migrant intake would be revised in light of the global financial crisis.</p>
<p>But the Government says that it remains committed to the Pacific Seasonal Workers Pilot Scheme.</p>
<p>The scheme was developed at the urging of farmers, especially fruit growers in the Goulburn Valley and Sunraysia regions.</p>
<p>It also promises to deliver much-needed financial help to struggling nations such as Kiribati, Tonga, Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Employment Minister Julia Gillard said: &#8220;The pilot is demand-driven. If there is no demand from horticultural employers for labour, then no Pacific Island workers will be recruited.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Opposition immigration spokeswoman Dr Sharman Stone said she was staggered at the cost.</p>
<p>She said orchardists were expected to pay the workers&rsquo; airfares, accommodation, insurance and other costs.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would like to know what $23 million is going to be spent on when the costs are supposed to be borne by the employers,&#8221; Dr Stone said.</p>
<p>The Member for Murray said the Opposition continued to support the scheme, despite the costs.</p>
<p>But she attacked the Government for delays to the scheme, which was to have begun by this harvest season.</p>
<p>But there is division in Opposition ranks over the program.</p>
<p>In a recent newspaper column, senior Liberal frontbencher Tony Abbott described the policy as &#8220;probably the Rudd Government&rsquo;s worst policy initiative so far&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will introduce discrimination into our immigration policy, exacerbate prejudices about ostensibly unsuitable work and, if made permanent, could exacerbate the underclass issues that trouble countries such as France and Germany,&#8221; he wrote in the The Australian.<br>

			<p>Will the unskilled Pacific Islanders go home when harvest season is over?</p>
<p>Never.  They will remain on the generous Australian dole.  Because of the dole, the employers will be able to lower their wages.  They will be paid in cash so they can remain on the dole.</p>
<p>Next follows family unification.  In 15 years all their cute little sons will be thugs and gangsters.</p>
<p>This is the pattern that has been followed for hundreds of years.  From docile cheap labor to vicious criminal underclass in 1 generation. <br>

<p>Finally, whites are starting to compare notes on the identical problems of non-white immigration across the Western world.  None of our problems with immigrants are unique.  We must unite in our common interest.</p>

			<p>P.I.s I think are being targeted because they are physically large and they seem to enjoy menial labour. And possibly because they are natural athletes (Australia is odsessed with sports).<br>
But no cures for cancer will be comming out of this group.</p>

			<p> I have heard so many people talking about this that I am sure it comes as no surprise to say that the best way to find jobs in a recession is to investigate jobs on employer websites:</p>
<p>-employers do not use recruiters in recessions because they cost money<br>
-job boards are flooded with applicants</p>
<p>People just do not look for jobs on employer websites.  There are thousands of employer websites in most cities and many of the job sit on there for months without applications.</p>
<p>This is where most of the jobs are and I found this far more effective than other means.</p>
<p>I started using a research <a> jobs site </a> called <a>Hound</a> that I do not think anyone knows about because it is run by a small company that does not advertise.  </p>
<p>All  <a> Hound.com </a> does is show you <a> unadvertised job openings that are not publicly advertised</a> and are located on employer websites. </p>
<p>Very few people realize that most employers post their job on their own sites and not on job boards like Monster, CareerBuilder, etc. because these sites charge employers up to $500 to post a single job.  In my experience (I am getting more interviews that I ever have), your chances of getting interviews and hired are much better when you are applying to jobs that are not advertised that no one knows about.  </p>
<p>I have gotten a ton of interviews through the <a>Hound site</a>.  If you are looking for a job I would highly recommend using <a>Hound</a> .  What most people do not realize is that most jobs are found on employer websites and not job boards.  <a>Hound</a> puts all of the jobs it finds from employer websiste (every Fortune 500, Inc. 500 and other company it can locate) on its site.  </p>
<p>When you start seeing sites advertise themselves a lot that should be a warning sign of sorts because that means that lots of people will start going and applying to the jobs.  I really trust  <a>Hound</a> because it does not advertise.  You can find the site at <a href="http://www.hound.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hound.com</a></p>
