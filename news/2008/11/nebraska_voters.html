<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The voters have spoken, banning affirmative action in Nebraska.</p>
<p>Now the Nebraska Supreme Court might get its say.</p>
<p>With legal uncertainty over the petition drive that pushed Initiative 424 onto the ballot, the vote signifies the middle &mdash; not the end &mdash; of the fight to bar minority scholarships and other traditional race- and gender-based affirmative action programs.</p>
<p>Nebraska voters approved the constitutional amendment by a comfortable margin, sending California businessman Ward Connerly and the amendment&rsquo;s other backers into celebration mode shortly after polls closed.</p>
<p>The constitutional amendment bars public agencies such as universities and city governments from considering race, gender and ethnicity when handing out contracts, hiring employees and awarding scholarships.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Initiative 424&rsquo;s opponents think the vote could harm university attempts to lure minority students and might end a City of Omaha program that pushes some subcontracting work to small female-owned and minority-owned businesses. They also think it sends a bad message &mdash; that Nebraska isn&rsquo;t a welcoming place for minorities.</p>
<p>But David Kramer, the director for Nebraskans United, which opposed the ballot measure, said he holds out hope that a Lancaster County District Court judge soon will declare the petition drive &mdash; and therefore Tuesday&rsquo;s vote &mdash; invalid.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kramer believes he has ample evidence of petition gatherers misleading signers about what Initiative 424 would do. If a petition gatherer committed some of those illegal acts, then all the signatures he or she gathered should be thrown out, he argues.</p>
<p>Judge Karen Flowers is expected to rule on the case soon. Either side could appeal to the state&rsquo;s highest court.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the University of Nebraska will start reviewing its programs that might violate the ban, said NU President J.B. Milliken.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going to change is some of the tools we have to promote diversity,&rdquo; Milliken said. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s not going to change is our commitment&hellip; . We think diversity is important to prepare our students &hellip; and it&rsquo;s incumbent upon us to provide educational opportunity to as many Nebraskans as possible. That doesn&rsquo;t change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What might change is the legality of Initiative 424. Its supporters vow to continue fighting to ensure it becomes Nebraska law.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The people have spoken,&rdquo; Tietz said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what America is about. Now it&rsquo;s time to put this into the Constitution.&rdquo;<br>

								<h2>Colorado May Become First to Support Preference Programs</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Katie Kerwin McCrimmon, Rocky Mountain News, Nov. 5, 2008</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Opponents of a measure to end preference programs for women and minorities in Colorado hold a razor-thin lead in late vote counting.</p>
<p>If it holds and Amendment 46 fails, Colorado would become the first state to defeat such a measure.</p>
<p>Similar measures, sponsored by a California millionaire, have passed in California, Michigan, Washington, Florida and, as of Tuesday, Nebraska.</p>
<p>Coloradans, however, were sharply divided over Amendment 46, with just 14,000 votes out of the nearly 2 million counted so far dividing the opponents and the supporters. Counting could continue for days.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like the voters in Colorado thought about this and understood what the truth is here and were not fooled by this trick,&rdquo; said Melissa Hart, co-chair of No on 46.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am excited about the possibility that we might be the first state to say to (California backer Ward) Connerly that we are not interested in this deceptive initiative and that we stand for a different set of values,&rdquo; Hart said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all stronger if each of us is stronger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Proponents of the measure believe voters were weary of ballot measures this year. They believe some voted no across the board. Others may have been confused because of the long ballot or failed to read Amendment 46. Proponents hinted that if the measure fails, they will try again. And, they celebrated receiving support from nearly 1 million Colorado voters.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jennifer Gratz, director of state and local initiatives for Connerly&rsquo;s group, the American Civil Rights Coalition, said she&rsquo;s convinced that Coloradans would vote to end preferences and said her group will continue to work for an end to such programs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Even if the measure goes down for the first time, Gratz said Connerly and their group would not be defeated.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Pollster and political analyst Floyd Ciruli said it&rsquo;s striking that Colorado appears to be balking at a national trend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fairly extraordinary,&rdquo; Ciruli said. He recalled a parallel ballot initiative supported by out-of-state supporters who tried to mandate English as the state&rsquo;s official language.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ultimately, Ciruli believes, the massive turnout for Obama helped the opponents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They benefited from a good year. Some conservatives were negative about putting anything on the ballot. They also picked up the progressive audience who were voting for a black president.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>The reason the ban is likely to lose in Colorado is because tons of east coast liberals as well as the people who did such a fine job of ruining California have moved to Colorado. Take my word for it. </p>

			<p>How&rsquo;s that for spin?  If certain ethnic groups don&rsquo;t get preferential treatment, it&rsquo;s interpreted to mean they&rsquo;re not welcome in the state.  Perhaps I&rsquo;ll introduce my own referendum proposing that Jews get first pick of all government jobs.  To those who oppose it, I&rsquo;ll say they&rsquo;re not welcoming Jews to their state and then I&rsquo;ll accuse them of being anti-Semites.</p>

			<p>Hope it works out better than it did in California.  Caifornia&rsquo;s 1996 Prop 209 has had absolutely no effect on anti white discrimination whatsoever.</p>
<p>In fact, there are fewer whites working in government agencies and quasi governmental organizations such as schools, hospitals and government contractors than back in 1996 when Prop 209 was passed.</p>
<p>There is no enforcement built into these anti affirmative action measures.  Meanwhile, the federal EEOC, the state FEPC&rsquo;s the Judiciary and its masters NAACP, ACLU, ADL, NOW, continue as usual to issue binding court orders that whites may not be employed or admitted to colleges.</p>
<p>The state universities got around Prop 209 by admitting somewhat less qualified asians over superbly qualified whites.  It was not so blatant to admit an asian with 1200 SAT&rsquo;s over a white with 1400 SAT&rsquo;s as it was to admit blacks with 800 SAT&rsquo;s over whites with 1400 SAT&rsquo;s.  This lasted about 5 years.</p>
<p>By 2000, it was back to normal, no whites need apply to the state college and university system.  Admission is now based solely on the essay, &#8220;my struggle, poor, poor, pitiful me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Strangely enough, the only applicants whose struggles are worthy of admission turn out to be black, hispanic or asian, never white.</p>

<p>Never fear, the meat packers and agribusinesses will continue trucking in hundreds of thousands of non white illegals from latin america and asia every year.<br>

<p>Affirmative action benefits women but mostly blacks. White men are discriminated against, because most black children grow up poor. That&rsquo;s basically it. Cause and effect. Black children are much more likely to grow up poor. To balance things out, educators and employers regretfully must discriminate against white men.</p>
<p>People of color are overrepresented as staff at 16 out of 17 government agencies. At one (EEOC) overrepresented by as much 900 percent agency wide. If the government is going to sponsor diversity shouldn&rsquo;t they be trying to rectify This imbalance by hiring more whites?</p>
<p>I think that it will only be when white men are denied, &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo;, too, that the whole hate-whitey machine will seriously slow down in earnest.  </p>

			<p>Say goodbye to America. Say goodbye to Americans. This soon-to-be minority-run country will appoint &#8220;Diversity&#8221; (Black) Management so as to appear non-Racist.  The corporate message will be, appoint a black to a management position, or else face scrutiny. Although blacks make up about 26% of the population, they will demand to be promoted, represented, as no less than 50% of the population. Black judges who are less-than-qualified will be appointed to preside over the imbalance of disproportionate numbers of blacks going to prison, and insist that larger numbers of whites be steered into the Penal system, and more blacks given a free pass. The same in all colleges, and schools. Blacks with poor attendance, and substandard grades, will graduate with bogus Honors, so they have an even chance on the Playing Field.  Black farmers will be forgiven on delinquent farm loans AGAIN.  Dealing Drugs will be considered a soft crime, Gangs will no longer be bothered by the Police, and biracial relationships between black males and white females will be promoted in advertising, movies and Prime time TV programs to bolster the self esteem of black males by baiting them with White Carrots.  Diversity will be broadened to mean, that if you don&rsquo;t accept black selfish character, and their white hate, then YOU are racist, and must be exposed for your hate. Reparations will be paid, even if they are never mentioned. Whites in the workplaces all across America will learn to accept the fact that qualifications can be faked, in the name of diversity, which must never be questioned. Less qualified blacks will be promoted over better qualified whites, who have genuine merited qualifications.  Attitude and opinion will be the qualifications of the NEW regime.  Anyone who questions the choices of frenzied management, anxious to demonstrate that they are not haters, will quickly find themselves unemployed, and unemployable.  Branded with a big &#8220;R&#8221; on their old workplace work references.  Blacks are rejoicing, not because of a diverse America, which elected a black President, but because they very well know, that National standards will now drop, requirements will be challenged, and thrown out as mean spirited, and no longer will an unqualified black individuals qualifications be questioned.  New Laws will be put into place to see that cannot happen.  But this FREE GRAB is to be short-lived. Hispanics will devour the entire black power structure by voting them out.  Talk about a Race War.  You ain&rsquo;t seen nothin&rsquo; yet.  Blacks, enjoy your short power/money grab.  Take all you can, like in south Africa, rape the resources to get as wealthy as you can before the resources are gone, and all the smart folks are killed off, or run off, and the Hispanics take what is left, and leave you nothing. America will look just like in those future Apocalypse Movies, where there is no new anything, cities are looted of their resources, and the warring factions fight over what is left. Just one big Socialist ghetto, run by corrupt murderers.  Just like in Mexico, or Venezuela, or Columbia, or South Africa, or Iraq.  Liberals love Socialism, until THEY become an exploited  resource themselves. </p>

<p>Boy are those Nebraskans dumb! Lets see, these &ldquo;minorities&rdquo; – meaning mainly African Americans - top every list of antisocial pathologies: highest violent crime rate, highest illegitimacy rate,  highest drop out rate and lowest academic achievement, highest rate of school discipline problems and expulsions, highest  poverty rate and unemployment.  And the Nebraskans won&rsquo;t go out of their way to welcome them? What were they thinking!<br>

<p></p>
<p>Maybe Milliken is right. Perhaps his students need more exposure to diversity. </p>
<p>University of Nebraska&rsquo;s minority students need a role model to look up to. We all know they are incapable of learning with to much whitey running around. I hearby demand that Milliken, who is white, resign his post and a person of color immediately appointed to replace him. This shouldnt be too much of an inconvenience to Mr Milliken, since he is commited to diversity. If he does protest his removal, someone kindly remind him that he is asking other whites to sacrifice what is rightfully theirs to further his noble quest for increasing diversity at the U of Nebraska. Surely having Milliken step sown and removing himself from the University campus isnt too much to ask for such a worthy cause. </p>

<p>    Bobby, I do take your word for it. Even during the mid-seventies East Coast flakes, former Hippies, and deadbeats were migrating in large numbers to Denver. Of course, Boulder was always the epicenter of liberaldom in Colorado. It&rsquo;s a shame that Colorado is going the same way as Vermont. I&rsquo;ve known many fine people from that great state. It used to be rock solid Conservative, but now immigrants from both Mexico and other more liberal States have almost ruined it. Probably the small and medium sized towns are still OK, but for how long?</p>

<p>Businessman, millionare, and not at all black. Nope.</p>
<p>Funny, too, how fifty-one percent versus forty-nine percent is interpreted to be, if not outright said to be, &#8220;the people speaking.&#8221; No no, it&rsquo;s a little more than half the people &#8220;speaking&#8221;, and a little less being dominated by them. And how can essentially half the population controlling the other half be, for the control being of certain properties, a triumph of justice, while the reverse and its control a failure of it? Democracy seems to me stupider and stupider by the thought. In general, if there is such a significant difference of opinion, there ought to be two laws operating in two territories.</p>
<p><br>
<i>&#8220;Pollster and political analyst Floyd Ciruli said it&rsquo;s striking that Colorado appears to be balking at a national trend.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;&hellip;California, Michigan, Washington, Florida and, as of Tuesday, Nebraska.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>California: minorities galore. Status: Passed.<br>
Michigan: minorities galore. Status: Passed.<br>
Florida: minorities galore. Status: Passed.<br>
Washington: don&rsquo;t know. Anybody do? Status: Passed.<br>
Nebraska: don&rsquo;t know. Anybody do? Status: Passed.<br>
Colorado: minorities relatively scarce. Status: Not Passed.</p>
<p>There are two states in which I don&rsquo;t know the concentration of minorities, but even without them, I spot a trend, you know?</p>
<p>Also, while doing a cursory search for &#8220;washington affirmative action ban&#8221; on Google, that Colorado did not pass its ban is being reported all over the place, seeming to me as if to say, &#8220;Hey, Liberal crackpots, come here! Come to Colorado!&#8221; The concentration of opinion that has here been mentioned occuring!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a UK resident and I thought blacks only made up 13% of the USA population. Surely 26% is the total non-white population. If I&rsquo;m correct then it makes Obama&rsquo;s electoral victory all the more the responsibility of those brainwashed white liberals who must have voted for him in droves.</p>
