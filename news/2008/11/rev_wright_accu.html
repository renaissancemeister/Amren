<h1><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27588197/">Rev. Wright Accuses Media of Using Him As a &lsquo;Weapon of Mass Destruction&rsquo;</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, November 7, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Speaking at a forum about race and religion, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright accused the media of taking out of context videos that showed him cursing the government and accusing it of conspiring against blacks from the pulpit of the Chicago church where Obama had worshipped for 20 years.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wright told an audience of about 200 people at the forum that he was trying to convey the anger and desire for vengeance that people felt after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. He said the media failed to mention that he was a proud Christian who was raised in a Christian home.</p>
<p>&#8220;Their intention was to use me as a weapon of mass destruction, to tear down that man&rsquo;s integrity,&#8221; said Wright, former pastor of Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago.</p>
<p><b>Shared opinion?</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you agree with everything your pastor says?&#8221; [Wright] asked. &#8220;Ninety percent of the people sitting in church don&rsquo;t agree with everything their pastor says. What I saw is not an index on what he did or does not believe.&#8221;</p>

			<p>I DO wish that Wright would crawl back under the rock from which he emerged. Like Sharpton and Jackson, his sense of self-aggrandizement is so strong that he can&rsquo;t let an opportunity for attention go by without demanding to be the focus.</p>
<p>Wright&rsquo;s over-sized ego and a desire for money motivated his appearance but you have to wonder about the judgement of the 200 members of the audience and the person who organized this &#8220;event&#8221;.</p>
<p>Why does anyone care what a ranting, washed-up, black racist thinks about anything?<br>

			<p>Of course&hellip; I mean how could ANYONE doubt wright&rsquo;s statements. His sincerety or integrity? If nothing else, reading this nonsense certainly made my day. There&rsquo; really only one stumbling block in this literary gem. That the same media trying to use Wright as a WMD, is the same media huckstering Obama to the American voters for the last six or seven years.</p>
<p>Now do I understand correctly? Jeremiah Wright has been named as the official White House Chaplain?</p>

			<p>You need to have integrity first before you can lose it.  Electing this racist with ties to this guy, Bill Ayers and others with the socialism to boot and the brainwashing of kids through school to feel white guilt is just makes me sad and emboldens me further to never give up on taking back our country and being proud to be white.</p>

__________</p>
<p>Just another misunderstood black man.  Only this one was caught on tape spewing racist venom and is known to openly espouse and promote hatred of whitey, probably taught to him during his so called &#8220;christian&#8221; upbringing.  <br>

			<p>He&rsquo;s back and we&rsquo;re going to be hearing some radical ravings from him, and others like Farrakhan and his ilk also.</p>
<p>Blacks can never keep from running their mouths for very long, and they&rsquo;re so dimwitted they bound to utter some disasterous comments that&rsquo;s going to cause racial tensions.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Reverend&#8221; Wright said that media used him to try to tear down Obama&rsquo;s integrity.</p>
<p>Yeah, and with honest people they succeeded, because attending the Rev. Wrights rants for twenty years doesn&rsquo;t speak well for someones &#8220;integrity.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Al Sharpton said the day after the election that &#8220;blacks still have a long way to go.&#8221;  Yeah, they still have a long way to go to confiscate everything that belongs to whites.  My father was right all those years ago when he told us that blacks were never going to be satisfied until we were picking their cotton.  We&rsquo;re pretty close to that day.  I just wish that just once, when Sharpton makes that idiotic remark about blacks still having a long way to go, that some sassy news reporter would ask him, how much more does he think the black race want.  Of course, snake tongued Al, would quickly reply some twisted, undecernible comment about black oppression, slavery, racism, blah blah blah.  I&rsquo;m so sick of black people and their supposed grievances.  We&rsquo;ve been listening to it for 40 years and I&rsquo;m just so very tired of it.</p>

Rev. Wright is correct. He is a weapon of mass destruction but it&rsquo;s not from the opposition.</p>
<p>Rev. Wright is going to be used as a means for Obama to express how black American truly feels about white America. When Rev. Wright makes an outrageous statement Obama will be asked about it and he will say, &#8216;while I&rsquo;m saddened by Rev. Wrights remarks, he&rsquo;s speaking for a people who feel left out. We should be addressing their issues&rsquo;.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how blacks are going to push their agenda down our throats. Wright will make outlandish claims and Obama will look like a moderate voice of reason and white America will be fooled that Obama is offering sensible middle ground.</p>

			<p>We don&rsquo;t need Rev. Wright to &#8216;tear down&rsquo; Obama&rsquo;s integrity  &mdash;  he&rsquo;s doing that just fine on his own.  </p>
<p>Wright thinks he&rsquo;s way more important than the actually is; after all, pretty much everyone that Obama has associations with in the past and present  &mdash;  from Bill Ayers, Tony Rezko, and Frank Marshall, to Rahm Emanuel, Linda Dorhn, and Abner Mikva  &mdash;  all of them are more influential than Wright, and all of them prove Obama&rsquo;s dishonesty and subterfuge.<br>

			<p>And I accuse you, Mr. Wright, of being a loud and extremely obnoxious anti-American, anti-white RACIST!  I accuse you of exploiting self-pitying blacks for all of these years just for your own personal financial gain.  </p>
<p>Hope you&rsquo;re enjoying all of your ill-gotten greed in your new &#8220;pie in the sky&#8221; mansion in that &#8220;typical white neighborhood&#8221; of yours&hellip; </p>
<p>A Christian?  Heck!  Just another mouthy, hate-mongering Racial Huckster is more like it.</p>
<p>Of course, you and all of your ilk will never give it up (just too lucrative) but more and more &#8220;whities&#8221; are learning that the Victim/Pity/Race Card just doesn&rsquo;t cut it anymore! </p>
<p>I repeat&hellip;  Look who&rsquo;s in the White House and look who put him there!  I rest my case.</p>

			<p>Yeah, the media really gave Obama hell over Wright; much more hell than they&rsquo;d have given a white guy with an equivalent skeleton in his closet.  Must be racism.</p>
<p>*snicker*  What do these people smoke to detach them from reality so?</p>

			<p>He&rsquo;s just trying to leverage the libs to get back in the population&rsquo;s good graces so he can make some more money off his hate and bitterness &#8220;sermons.&#8221; These Jesse, Sharpton, etc&hellip; characters are all the same to me. Too chicken to return to the Savanah and live out what they were made to be they run around like Balaam in America.</p>
