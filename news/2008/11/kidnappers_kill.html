<h1>Kidnappers Kill Mexican Child with Acid Injection</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Olga R. Rodriguez, AP, Nov. 4, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Kidnappers grabbed a 5-year-old boy from a gritty Mexico City street market, then killed him by injecting acid into his heart &mdash; a new low even for Mexico&rsquo;s brutal kidnapping gangs.</p>
<p>The boy, Javier Morena, was the oldest son of a poor family that sold fruit at a market in the poor neighborhood of Iztapalapa, proof that the plague of kidnappings for ransom afflicts the working class as well as the wealthy.</p>
<p>Javier disappeared while playing at the market on Sunday, Oct. 26, Mexico City authorities said Monday. The boy&rsquo;s family spent days looking for him, finally persuading a local television station to post his picture on the news on Wednesday, Oct. 29.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The police raided the 17-year-old&rsquo;s home, and he and his family and two others confessed to having killed the boy before they could ask for a 300,000-peso ($23,000) ransom, Mexico City Attorney General Miguel Mancera said in a statement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The child&rsquo;s death recalled the recent kidnapping and slaying of Fernando Marti, the 14-year-old son of a sporting goods magnate whose death prompted a national outcry against crime.</p>
<p>Young Marti&rsquo;s decomposing body was found in the trunk of a car even though his family reportedly paid a ransom. Prosecutors said a federal lawman was part of the gang that kidnapped Marti.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mexico has one of the world&rsquo;s highest kidnapping rates, according to the anti-violence group IKV Pax Christi. Kidnappings are up 9 percent this year and average 65 per month nationwide, according to the federal Attorney General&rsquo;s Office, which blames a growing web of drug cartels, current and former police officers and informants who point out potentially lucrative victims.</p>

			<p>I knew that kidnappings in Mexico were rampant. It&rsquo;s a big business down there. I love the movie, &#8216;Man On Fire&rsquo;, based on the true story of John Creasy. The kidnappers go after wealthy parents. I don&rsquo;t know what is happening to make them go for any random child. Maybe it was a sign to let the &#8216;authorities&rsquo; know that they&rsquo;re tired of the run-around when asking for their ransom.</p>

			<p>If someone in the United States does a kidnapping that results in death, there is a strong possibility of the perpetrator getting the death penalty in states that have the death penalty.Mexico doesnt have the death penalty for any and all crimes, including serial killers.They think that they are morally superior to us.Their moral superiority is one reason why their murder rate is three times of what ours is.</p>

			<p>Stupidity almost as shocking as the cruelty on display.  Did the kidnappers really think a family that peddles fruit in a street market had $23,000 just laying around to spend on ransom?</p>
<p>Coming to a neighborhood near you!</p>

<p>They don&rsquo;t say here what the worldwide average for kidnappings is. It would be especially interesting to see a statistical comparison with overwhelmingly white or asian nations.</p>

<p>The parents had a booth in a farmer&rsquo;s market.  It is obvious that the kidnappers were extorting the vendors.  When the vendors didn&rsquo;t pay up, the kid was kidnapped.</p>
<p>Something similiar happened in the Salvadorean neighborhood around MacArthut Park in Los Angeles.  A baby in a stroller was shot on the sidewalk where the vendors set up their tables.  The mother and grandfather of the child had refused to pay the extortion demanded by MS 13.</p>
<p>When kidnapping gets popular all sorts of ordinary people are kidnapped.  $5,000 here, $5,000 there, it&rsquo;s a lot more lucrative than street muggings.  And of course in Latin America wealthy children are driven to school by armed guards, live behind locked gates at home and only go out to well guarded homes and clubs.</p>
<p>So it is easier to kidnap ordinary people.  Especially with ATMs, they just grab someone and make them take out the limit. Or grab a parent and child and hold the child hostage while the parent goes into the bank and clears the money out of all their accounts.</p>

			<p>With Prez Obama taking the reins&hellip; HOW soon before a presidential order is issued, STOPPING all work on that fence along the border? How soon before the daily flood of illegal immigrants DOUBLES in numbers? How soon before a corrupt Congress blatantly DISREGARDS the will of the American citizen voters and gives AMNESTY to the 30-35 million illegals already here?</p>
<p>&#8220;President&#8221; Obama may have WON&hellip; but the American people have LOST! Don&rsquo;t know about you, friend. Me, I anticipate a huge spike in crime in our country, thanks to Mexico, its corruption and the floods of illegal immigrants. Yes, I will take responsibility for self-defense. I keep weapons close to hand and WILL NEVER give up my right to own one.</p>
<p>That tired old canard: &#8220;If guns are outlawed, only outlaws will own guns&#8221; has even more significance today than it ever did in the past. Think about it!</p>

			<p>PeeJay in Frisco: The Hispanic murder rate is five, not three times ours.  Some police agencies, notably the FBI, have been counting many Hispanics as White.  For example, google &#8220;FBI, hate crimes&#8221; and look at the statistics for hate crimes committed by Hispanics.  They don&rsquo;t exist.  Not only do they conceal the malevolence of the aliens, by inflating the White murder rate they make blacks not quite so bad in comparison.  I have seen it written that the Black homicide rate is eight times that of Whites.  Not so, when the Hispanics are subtracted from the White homicide totals, the Black murder rate is shown to actually be 11 or 12 times ours.  <br>

			<p>                   School Teacher: Thanks for correcting me. I overlooked the fact that hispanics are counted as a as a victim category, and not a perpetrator category.The continued hispanic influx will assure that the rate of  white hate crime perpetrators will keep rising.  </p>

			<p>The FBI also lists dark-skinned alien Muslim criminals as &#8220;white&#8221; as well.  I remind you that today&rsquo;s FBI is comprised almost entirely of black males and white liberal females.  Neither has any love of white males.  Remember this in the days to come&hellip;      </p>

			<p>The most shocking part of this whole mess is that the Mexican American citizens sit quietly by as all this murder and torture of Mexicans is taking place and they refuse to say anything to bring an end to this brutality. It is almost as if they are embarassed by it and think if they just pretend it away and keep blaming white folks for all their problems things will get better for them. Mexican Americans must demand that The government of Mexico take full responsibility for the conditions of its people and start treating Mexicans in Mexico as well as they are treated by white people in the USA,REMEMBER WHITE PEOPLE PAY MEXICANS $100 per day Mexicans pay Mexicans $5 per day.     </p>

			<p>As a USA born Mexican American, I agree that each Mexican American (or Mexican Canadian) has a responsibility in this. I want to make the following points, because it all relates to Mexican Americans and the power that many unknowingly have in Mexico, even if not born in Mexico</p>
<p>The constitution of Mexico GUARANTEES that children of Mexicans (or of one mexican parent) are Mexican BY BIRTH. Therefore if a child born in the USA of one or both parents Mexican, the child is Mexican by birth, This is true dual nationality, and is the only REAL dual nationality. Now when that child grows up and assuming has registered as a Mexican at some point in his life, when his child is born that child WILL also qualify as Mexican. </p>
<p>IN the case of 1st and 2nd generation (or tenth for that matter if maintaining the registrations with each generation) mexican Americans with Mexican nationality BY BIRTH, they  have the right to vote like any other Mexican. Also, because it is more probable that on average the general population of Mexican Americans have a higher level of education than the average general population of mexico, as well as some experience or knowledge of how other governments outside of mexico work, their voice carries more authority if they would only coordinate as a group!</p>
<p>In the case of many Asians who arrived to the USA, they maintain strong support for others of their culture, however Mexican American Culture tends to not support their own, so they may blend in witth the general population in the USA. </p>
<p>Mexicans in general need to stop taking the attitude of &#8220;going to a better place&#8221; and work on developing an attitude of &#8220;making Mexico a better place&#8221;. They need to at least do this for any remaining family members there. Unfortunately Mexico is not big on making something right because it would benefit your fellow man. </p>
<p>ALL MEXICANS WITH CHILDREN BORN OUTSIDE OF MEXICO should also register all children via the local Mexican Consulate as Mexican by birth, and they shopuld register asd Mexican voters at 18, assuring that their children have a voice in mexican political matters.</p>
<p>The mexican system does NOT WANT THESE BETTER EDUCATED VOTERS! That is because they want to keep the prevailing backward, bribing mentality in a country where all employees in a government office will be removed from their post and replaced by a &#8220;like minded&#8221; worker who will honor the traditions of Corruption, at solely the election of a new Mayor or governor. Yes these are not career social service workers in Mexico rather a friend of the governeor or Mayor, or someone who just needs a job. They are not the most qualified either, as they are only looking for employees that support the crooked methods of the governor, Mayor, or President.<br>
