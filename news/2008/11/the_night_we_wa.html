				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peter Hitchens, Daily Mail (London), November 10, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Anyone would think we had just elected a hip, skinny and youthful replacement for God, with a plan to modernise Heaven and Hell &mdash; or that at the very least John Lennon had come back from the dead.</p>
<p>The swooning frenzy over the choice of Barack Obama as President of the United States must be one of the most absurd waves of self-deception and swirling fantasy ever to sweep through an advanced civilisation. At least Mandela-worship &mdash; its nearest equivalent &mdash; is focused on a man who actually did something.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t see how the Obama devotees can ever in future mock the Moonies, the Scientologists or people who claim to have been abducted in flying saucers. This is a cult like the one which grew up around Princess Diana, bereft of reason and hostile to facts.</p>
<p>It already has all the signs of such a thing. The newspapers which recorded Obama&rsquo;s victory have become valuable relics. You may buy Obama picture books and Obama calendars and if there isn&rsquo;t yet a children&rsquo;s picture version of his story, there soon will be.</p>
<p>Proper books, recording his sordid associates, his cowardly voting record, his astonishingly militant commitment to unrestricted abortion and his blundering trip to Africa, are little-read and hard to find.</p>
<p>If you can believe that this undistinguished and conventionally Left-wing machine politician is a sort of secular saviour, then you can believe anything. He plainly doesn&rsquo;t believe it himself. His cliche-stuffed, PC clunker of an acceptance speech suffered badly from nerves.  It was what you would expect from someone who knew he&rsquo;d promised too much and that from now on the easy bit was over.</p>
<p>He needn&rsquo;t worry too much. From now on, the rough boys and girls of America&rsquo;s Democratic Party apparatus, many recycled from Bill Clinton&rsquo;s stained and crumpled entourage, will crowd round him, to collect the rich spoils of his victory and also tell him what to do, which is what he is used to.</p>
<p>Just look at his sermon by the shores of Lake Michigan. He really did talk about a &lsquo;new dawn&rsquo;, and a &lsquo;timeless creed&rsquo; (which was &lsquo;yes, we can&rsquo;). He proclaimed that &lsquo;change has come&rsquo;. He revealed that, despite having edited the Harvard Law Review, he doesn&rsquo;t know what &lsquo;enormity&rsquo; means. He reached depths of oratorical drivel never even plumbed by our own Mr Blair, burbling about putting our hands on the arc of history (or was it the ark of history?) and bending it once more toward the hope of a better day (Don&rsquo;t try this at home).</p>
<p>I am not making this up. No wonder that awful old hack Jesse Jackson sobbed as he watched. How he must wish he, too, could get away with this sort of stuff.</p>
<p>And it was interesting how the President-elect failed to lift his admiring audience by repeated &mdash; but rather hesitant &mdash; invocations of the brainless slogan he was forced by his minders to adopt against his will &mdash; &lsquo;Yes, we can&rsquo;. They were supposed to thunder &lsquo;Yes, we can!&rsquo; back at him, but they just wouldn&rsquo;t join in.  No wonder. Yes we can what exactly? Go home and keep a close eye on the tax rate, is my advice. He&rsquo;d have been better off bursting into &lsquo;I&rsquo;d like to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony&rsquo; which contains roughly the same message and might have attracted some valuable commercial sponsorship.</p>
<p>Perhaps, being a Chicago crowd, they knew some of the things that 52.5 per cent of America prefers not to know. They know Obama is the obedient servant of one of the most squalid and unshakeable political machines in America. They know that one of his alarmingly close associates, a state-subsidised slum landlord called Tony Rezko, has been convicted on fraud and corruption charges.</p>
<p>They also know the US is just as segregated as it was before Martin Luther King &mdash; in schools, streets, neighbourhoods, holidays, even in its TV-watching habits and its choice of fast-food joint. The difference is that it is now done by unspoken agreement rather than by law.</p>
<p>If Mr Obama&rsquo;s election had threatened any of that, his feel-good white supporters would have scuttled off and voted for John McCain, or practically anyone. But it doesn&rsquo;t. Mr Obama, thanks mainly to the now-departed grandmother he alternately praised as a saint and denounced as a racial bigot, has the huge advantages of an expensive private education. He did not have to grow up in the badlands of useless schools, shattered families and gangs which are the lot of so many young black men of his generation.</p>
<p>If the nonsensical claims made for this election were true, then every positive discrimination programme aimed at helping black people into jobs they otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t get should be abandoned forthwith. Nothing of the kind will happen. On the contrary, there will probably be more of them.</p>
<p>And if those who voted for Obama were all proving their anti-racist nobility, that presumably means that those many millions who didn&rsquo;t vote for him were proving themselves to be hopeless bigots. This is obviously untrue.</p>
<p>I was in Washington DC the night of the election. America&rsquo;s beautiful capital has a sad secret. It is perhaps the most racially divided city in the world, with 15th Street &mdash; which runs due north from the White House &mdash; the unofficial frontier between black and white. But, like so much of America, it also now has a new division, and one which is in many ways much more important. I had attended an election-night party in a smart and liberal white area, but was staying the night less than a mile away on the edge of a suburb where Spanish is spoken as much as English, plus a smattering of tongues from such places as Ethiopia, Somalia and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>As I walked, I crossed another of Washington&rsquo;s secret frontiers. There had been a few white people blowing car horns and shouting, as the result became clear. But among the Mexicans, Salvadorans and the other Third World nationalities, there was something like ecstasy.</p>
<p>They grasped the real significance of this moment. They knew it meant that America had finally switched sides in a global cultural war. Forget the Cold War, or even the Iraq War. The United States, having for the most part a deeply conservative people, had until now just about stood out against many of the mistakes which have ruined so much of the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Suspicious of welfare addiction, feeble justice and high taxes, totally committed to preserving its own national sovereignty, unabashedly Christian in a world part secular and part Muslim, suspicious of the Great Global Warming panic, it was unique.</p>
<p>These strengths had been fading for some time, mainly due to poorly controlled mass immigration and to the march of political correctness. They had also been weakened by the failure of America&rsquo;s conservative party &mdash; the Republicans &mdash; to fight on the cultural and moral fronts.</p>
<p>They preferred to posture on the world stage. Scared of confronting Left-wing teachers and sexual revolutionaries at home, they could order soldiers to be brave on their behalf in far-off deserts. And now the US, like Britain before it, has begun the long slow descent into the Third World. How sad. Where now is our last best hope on Earth?<br>

			<p>I hate to spoil Hitchens&rsquo;s party, but this mostly would have been the case, too, if McCain would have won.  I&rsquo;m also not fond of Hitchens&rsquo;s Mandela idolatry   &mdash;   Obama is our Mandela.</p>

			<p>The Daily Mail is not a publication we should pay too much attention to - a lot of it is mere whingeing and piffle with no grounding in fact - but Peter Hitchens is one of Britain&rsquo;s best journalists, and he always has something worthwhile to say. This piece is as incisive, frank and relevant as the best of his writing; indeed, I wish everyone in Britain would read this article.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Hitchens is guilty of occasionally slipping into hyperbole, like many of the Mail&rsquo;s columnists.(Stand up, Melanie Philips and Richard Littlejohn. On second thoughts, sit down again, you pair of buffoons.) This &#8216;long, slow descent into the Third World&rsquo; really won&rsquo;t happen in my opinion. The fraudulent nature of Obama&rsquo;s symbolic victory will become obvious when African-American employment and academic acheivement levels don&rsquo;t improve. Then hopefully people on both sides of the fence will wake up.</p>

			<p>The most amazing thing was watching all the young white people walking towards Grant Park on the night of the election; truly the face of stupidity for the New Amerika.</p>
<p>And it was something to see Obama waving behind screens of bulletproof glass; here this Black man was proclaiming the victory of multiculturalism, and yet was unwilling to to face his white supporters unless he was separated from them by a belt of transparent armor.</p>

			<p>Obama&rsquo;s speech election night was pretty good actually.   </p>
<p>The last best white hope on earth is probably Russia. I doubt Peter Hitchens is personally concerned about it. He does a better job here critiquing conservatives than he does Obama and the liberal camp. That&rsquo;s not surprising. Subtle and effective criticism of Obama doesn&rsquo;t make it to print. </p>

			<p>Brilliant piece. Did this really appear in a mainstream British newspaper? It sounds like something Fred Reed might have written. I think I shall commit parts of it to memory to use as talking points for the coming months. If I have any quibbles, it would be about the claim that the U.S. &#8220;stood out against many of the mistakes which have ruined so much of the rest of the world.&#8221; While that is true in some respects, in other respects the U.S. seems to have spread its guilt about slavery, which ended generations ago, to the entire world. From it&rsquo;s swooning over MLK and Malcolm X to it&rsquo;s putting the thumbscrews to South Africa to its Hollywood depictions of blacks as oppressed martyrs, the United States has its hands plenty dirty. It was only the clear-thinking faction in the U.S. that stood against the madness. Let&rsquo;s hope that faction can get back on their feet in the coming years.</p>

			<p>The media has portrayed BHO as some sort of political genius, but this article points out the reality that he is far from it. He has said some incredibly stupid things that would get any other candidate thrown out. &#8220;If we would just inflate our tires we wouldn&rsquo;t have to import oil&#8221; &#8220;Iran? We would squash them like a grape!&#8221; Very presidential. &#8220;I&rsquo;ll just invade Pakistan&#8221; His statement about passing legislation that would &#8220;neccesarily cause electric rates to skyrocket&#8221; was  ignored by the media, but this one move alone would dessroy the economy.</p>
<p>These statments and others show a man who has a simplistic world view, a kind of hippie Marxism one would expect to see in a college student. </p>
<p>Obama is a completely empty suit who will be protected for as long as possible by an adoring media, but it will be eventually revealed that he is the ultimate affirmative action special.</p>

			<p>At its core America is a deeply fundamentalist country. </p>
<p>It always has been and probably always will be. </p>
<p>Which is why it shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising to any secularist that Obama would enjoy the success he has had. </p>
<p>His flaky political sermons are taylor-made for the New Age kooks who vote for the Democrats.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re spiritual, but not &#8220;religious&#8221;. </p>
<p>They&rsquo;re dogmatic, but not exclusive. </p>
<p>And most importantly they validate the fluffy, quasi-religious Hollywood images that have been burned into the back of their skulls.</p>

			<p>Mr Hitchens nailed it. He lives across the ocean and can see the truth and what&rsquo;s happening to this once great country. And yet we have people who live right here and you could hit them over the head with the truth and they would still deny it or worse they don&rsquo;t care about truth just as long as it brings about the destruction of whites and this country..</p>

			<p>Yes, it was total failure of the Republican (RINOS) who created the demise of USA Conservative Republic along with the accomplices of DNC mass immigrations and state sponsored birthright citizenships to millions of illegal immigrants as they bankrupt CA.  Weak spineless and purchased people in GOP played along with the wacky anti-American left to create the Bush directed mess that has been brought upon USA.   <br>
The conservative people have been marginalized by both parties and sold US out for lobbies, PR campaigns, and those who have worked to Deconstruct our Constitution for over 60 years.   The ignorant nut cases and radicals  have successfully brought USA to the place of voting for favors: long a bastion of dictators.   V</p>

This is beautifully written. I will keep an eye out for the name Peter Hitchens.</p>
<p>And yes, I too caught that misuse of the word &#8220;enormity&#8221; in Obama&rsquo;s speech. Maybe it presages an administration that will be associated with the word &#8220;enormity.&#8221;</p>

			<p>To a certain degree, the sour grapes are palpable (g).<br>
But seriously&hellip; medium term, Russia may well become the last refuge of the whitebread. And to think that I was trained at taxpayers´expense against the Big Bad Russians. (Not to mention the hoots from my Volga German ancestors)</p>

			<p>Something to think about. What percentage of eligible White voters did not vote on Nov 3? What percentage of the White voters who voted for Barack Obama voted not out of any great love for the Dear Leader Obama, but out of disgust with John McCain?</p>

			<p>I really never thought about comparing our loony leftwing liberals to Moonies and Scientologists&hellip; but damn, the comparison certainly makes sense. All three groups would tell you black is white, snow is warm and gravity is a figment of the imagination   &mdash;   if you were to ask them.</p>
<p>The ONLY good thing about Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;win&#8221; being that Hillary will NEVER occupy the White House as the first female prez. I am pretty darn certain, Obama&rsquo;s halo will have become quite tarnished by Spring of 2010. With the rising disenchantment and sense of being sold a bottle of snake-oil elexir so many Americans will feel by then, that the Democrats would have to consider themselves lucky, if they even retain an even split with the Republicans after the 2010 mid-term elections.</p>
<p>As smart as Hillary and Bill are &#8216;supposed&rsquo; to be, I can&rsquo;t believe they didn&rsquo;t do their utmost to derail Obama. Because sure as little green apples tend to be sour, if Obama falls on his face as many of us expect&hellip; the Democrats will be frozen out of the White House for 12 to 15 years at the earliest.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Last best hope&#8221; is an absurdity. A sensible person tries his/her most hopeful course of action first. One&rsquo;s last hope is the last-ditch response to a desperate situation, in the launch whereof Jewish folk say Kaddish and RC folk say the <i>Hail Mary</i>.</p>
<p>On optimism in politics, I respectfully direct the curious to Georges Sorel&rsquo;s <i>Letter to Daniel Halevy</i>, which forms <i>in toto</i> the preface to the Peter Smith (English translation) edition of <i>Reflexions on Violence</i>.</p>

			<p>&#8220;burbling about putting our hands on the arc of history (or was it the ark of history?) &#8220;</p>
<p>Actually, Indianna Jones discovered the true, authentic Ark of the Covenant perfectly preserved somewhere in Ethopia.  It was taken to St. Peter&rsquo;s grave in the vatican, opened, and out popped baby Obama!!!!!  The God child, the savior, the messiah, he whose name should not be spoken, Annaken Skywalker!!!!!</p>
<p>Since evil whitey would have killed him and there, he was rushed to Hawaii by a host of angels and deposited in the home of his foster mother and her parents, the communist Dunham family.</p>

			<p>Mr. Hitchens makes some very good observations in this article, but two stand out as being particularly prescient.</p>
<p>The first is this:</p>
<p>&#8220;If you can believe that this undistinguished and conventionally Left-wing machine politician is a sort of secular saviour, then you can believe anything. He plainly doesn&rsquo;t believe it himself. His cliche-stuffed, PC clunker of an acceptance speech suffered badly from nerves. It was what you would expect from someone who knew he&rsquo;d promised too much and that from now on the easy bit was over.&#8221;</p>
<p>Right there, is the problem that General Secretary-elect Obama now faces dead in the face; the easy part of his &#8220;transformational&#8221; or even &#8220;transcendent&#8221; odyssey is over and now he has to deliver upon the absurdly inflated expectations, it has generated. Can he make good on all of the nebulous slogans and promises that were mindlessly chanted by his idiotic followers, who he has so enchanted? Or put another way, will his hammer of &#8220;hope&#8221; and sickle of &#8220;change,&#8221; whatever they may be, please a majority of this country&rsquo;s 300 million?</p>
<p>I think not!</p>
<p>After all, for so many fools he was the &#8220;second coming&#8221; and that he is not. Unless, it is the second coming of Jimmy Carter. And the fact that those who support him are fools with hopelessly unrealistic expectations, means that he is going to be fighting an up hill battle from the minute he takes the oath of office. Once that is done, and the sun does not  mystically heat the earth to a comfortable 80 degrees free of humidity and we are all not magically freed of all anxieties, his &#8220;presidency&#8221; will be in decline.</p>
<p>Sure, the Marxstream Media will prop him up for awhile, but even their smoke and mirrors fade and tarnish over time.</p>
<p>The second interesting observation he makes, is this:</p>
<p>&#8220;As I walked, I crossed another of Washington&rsquo;s secret frontiers. There had been a few white people blowing car horns and shouting, as the result became clear. But among the Mexicans, Salvadorans and the other Third World nationalities, there was something like ecstasy.</p>
<p>They grasped the real significance of this moment. They knew it meant that America had finally switched sides in a global cultural war. Forget the Cold War, or even the Iraq War. The United States, having for the most part a deeply conservative people, had until now just about stood out against many of the mistakes which have ruined so much of the rest of the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>This &#8220;ecstasy&#8221; on the part of the Third World&rsquo;s minions and the &#8220;secular humanist&#8221; white fools who support this man, have only won a battle and it is not like the Battle of Normandy was for the Allies, but more like Battle of Stalingrad was for the Axis. They have achieved what looks to be a major &#8220;tactical&#8221; success on paper; however, do they have the reserves to exploit it? </p>
<p>No they do not. What they have are the very unpleasant circumstances of facing an economic crisis (that their &#8220;solutions&#8221; will only exacerbate)and being in charge of all the elected branches of government. Our new &#8220;president&#8221; will at least until 2010, not have the luxury of hiding behind anything or anyone. He and his party, will be accountable for anything that goes wrong, and that they make worse through their own dogmatic Marxism. </p>
<p>Moreover, he will be attempting to appease all of the competing racial and &#8220;cultural&#8221; interest groups that are the rank and file of his party, while they will be demanding the: sun, moon, and stars. For blacks, this will mean &#8220;equality&#8221; with whites; for white fools and Reds, this will mean a healing multicultural paradise devoid of race; for Hispanics, this will mean Aztlan and God only knows what else; and for the whole world outside the USA, which is currently so enamored with him, it will mean a USA devoid of all strength and willpower. </p>
<p>Good luck with all that!</p>
<p>In the end, he will fail miserably and then of course &#8220;racism&#8221; will be blamed!!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!</p>

			<p>There was a time when I wondered if the United States would survive this president or that president&hellip;and both parties have had their fair share of stinkers.</p>
<p>More recently, I wondered if the United States SHOULD survive their foolishness at the ballot box. Does the rest of the world need the United States? Clearly, THEY don&rsquo;t think so. So perhaps this country should survive, if for no other reason, as a refuge or reservation for our tribe.</p>
<p>Now I am convinced, the United States does not DESERVE to survive. So I watch Rome burn on television, without glee and without fear. Whatever happens will impact the idiots much more than it will me. Most of my life is done and those who did this will never know the life that I have had.</p>

			<p>What an article, it hit all bases but one, the role of the MSM in this disaster. It was very clear for all to see that the MSM was clearly in the tank for Barack Obama in a most decided way.<br>
So much for the 1st Amendment and the objective watch dog role designed for the press.The media made no bones in showing  it&rsquo;s true colors and can never again be trusted to report anything honestly without their liberal slant and agenda. Any objectivity pretense is gone when  the MSM openly roots for one candidate over another.  The media is supposed to protect us from government, not take sides with it. A pox on these charlatans who are playing a major role in bring this great country down.<br>

			<p>The U.S. is no longer a true nation.  It is the Star Wars Bar.</p>
<p>A true nation is one that is relatively homogeneous. A homogeneous nation is full of people who understand each other on an instinctual level. </p>
<p>And, speaking of understanding on an instinctual level, take the way Whites often &#8220;fight,&#8221; as an example. Such a fight between two Whites is usually a ritual fight where the angry parties call each other a lot of names but usually don&rsquo;t come to blows. Sort of like Elephant Seals.  Now consider when a White and a Black get into a fight. The White ends up calling names, but the Black gets physical and the White often doesn&rsquo;t expect that and gets injured. Blacks are not just Whites with different paint jobs.</p>
<p>The present mistaken and absurd gushiness about how swell it is to mix and blend very different peoples together in a single nation is on a silliness par with the once almost universal and equally mistaken belief that the earth is flat.</p>

			<p>I watched Comrade Obama&rsquo;s victory speech and I watched the faces of those in Grant Park that night and it was like looking at people lost in a trance, tears streaming down their faces.  Some looked like they were going to faint.  In my entire lifetime, I&rsquo;ve never seen such cult like worship for a man that none of us knows anything about.  We do know what he said as he campaigned, but there is still so much we DON&rsquo;T know.  Never before has a man been elected President that the American public knows so little about.  </p>
<p>I will never understand how a majority white population could turn the reins of power over to this man.  I know that some of it was the hate Bush syndrome but that&rsquo;s just a small part of the move towards Obama and the overwhelming amount of white people who voted for him.  As I looked at those faces in the crowd at Grant Park, I had to search long and hard to find many black faces in the crowd.</p>

<p>I suppose I&rsquo;m of the &#8216;if things get worse, they&rsquo;ll get better&rsquo; school of thought on our predicament, and though I live in the UK, I would have voted for Obama if I was American. Surely you&rsquo;re not going to argue that the last eight years of GOP rule have benefited white racial consciousness, and I feel that anything would be better than four more years of the same. Better to awaken people with a sharp jolt than keep them in the slumber of slow decline I feel.</p>

			<p>Peter Hitchens is always worth a read. Although I sometimes disagree, he is the most trenchant and unapologetically anti-PC journalist in the UK.</p>
<p>Interestingly, he is a former Trotskyite. At some point, he obviously saw the light, and seems now to be something of a paleoconservative, one of the very, very few writing in the UK&rsquo;s mainstream media.</p>
<p>He wrote an excellent, full length critique of Britain&rsquo;s decay back in 1999, The Abolition of Britain - an excellent book.</p>
<p>Gerald Baker wrote a pseudo-Biblical satire on Obama-worship in today&rsquo;s issue of The Times (UK). Have a look! </p>

These other-than-white voters vote heavily democrat no matter what their performance is.  One amnesty and the continued millions of legal/illegal immigrants, plus a little voter fraud thrown in for good measure and Obama easily has a second term.</p></p></p>

			<p>According to the NYT-Nov9-the difference in the election was three hundred thousand votes. In an interview over at Z net(Z magazine)Noam Chomsky stated that based upon well tested political models-where the economy has taken a severe nose-dive-Barack Obama should have had a landlside victory. Chomsky stated that the reason this didn&rsquo;t happen was because of very significant resistance in the White American community to a black president.</p>
<p>I think it would have been much better if John McCain or Hilarly Clinton had won. If John McCain had won, it is very highly likely that across the nation, a small number White Americans would have been murder-maybe a dozen-immediately after the election. However, these murders could have triggered an even higher level of black-on-white-violence. The level of fear in the White population would have been enormous. As a consequence, Barack Obama would have been blamed for the murder of how ever many Whites that were murdered in the post-election violence. Barck Obama would have been thouroughly discredited and his political career would have been over. President McCain would have wrecked the economy and started a major war. As a consequence, the Republican party would have been thouroughly discredited. A wide window would open for various White racialist political parties. If Hilarly Clinton had been elected, the Democratic party would have been thouroughly discredited after 4-8 years of her rule. This also would have wrecked any chance of Barack Obama being president of the United States.<br>
The election is terrible event in the history of Native Born White America. No one should underestimate this.</p>
<p>Immigration reform organizations who do not make the  race-based case against immigration reform are going to have a very difficult time when they debate the immgration issue  nationally.</p>
<p>Organizatins that make a race-based case against post-1965 immigration policy will- in public debates-  evoke  a very strong response in  race-replacement enthusiast in the MSM.Racialst immigration reformers will be pilloried in public. Racialist immigration reformers are the type of immigration refromers the enemy is really afraid of. They are not afraid of Roy Beck and Dan Stien. However, in viciously attacking White Nationalist immigration refromers, White Nationalist immigration reformers will get A WHOLE LOT OF FREE PUBLICTY. This is the reason why Jared Taylor was invited on Phil Donahues MSNBC show twice. Jared is responsble for the  last two of Donhues MSNBC  shows  receiving  the higest ratings of all his MSNBC shows. </p>

			<p>As the comments above show, the Hitchens article is mixed, half reality, half keeping out of British PC prison, which can morph into real prison.  McCain would have meant another amnesty attempt.  There likely won&rsquo;t be any attempt at amnesty by Obama that is other than half hearted empty rhetoric.  Still we need to keep our faxes dry and support NumbersUSA and Fairus.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;ve expected us to stand aside and wallow in the abuse they wrought on us by paying third world hordes to come to this country for so long, I can just see the panic in their eyes as their voices reach a hysterical pitch, as they start to process literally tens of millions of freebie applications from whites.</p>

<p>You couldn&rsquo;t have said it any clearer or more accurately. What the (H) is wrong with white America? Our race has a track record of success in life, business, inventions, the arts, yet so many whites (in particular - white females) bow down to those who other than breathing air, reproducing and eating food, have done little else to move humanity forward. We are destroying our own race in the name of MULTICULTURALISM, what is wrong with so many of the white race?</p>

			<p>Hitchens and his ilk live in this perpetual LBJ-JFK-FDR zone where none of these messy ideas about race and nationalism exist.  But I&rsquo;ve got news for him and those of you on this blog who are gloomy.  Blacks will never be able to govern this nation, even when they and their Hispanic fellow travelers reach the 50% mark at mid-century.  By then, the government will have long ago collapsed and there will be as many as six or seven separate nations on the North American continent.  That is probably the best we can hope for.  And looking out further than that, one of those regions will probably conquer one or more of the other nations.  By the 22nd century, this continent will be unrecognizable to the early 21st century time traveler.</p>

<p>&gt; Not to personally attack this anonymous poster, but we must cease this defeatist language and attitude.  SA never had anything near a White majority and we still do - by a little.  </p>
<p>Some people will take all this as a surrender - even as one poster did last week, decide to just go ahead and miscegenate further, since White people have become so silly.  No, only 30% of us have.</p>
<p>If Whites were ever worthy of world domination, and they were - it is because we are at our core, intelligent and ferocious fighters.  Think of Winston Churchill&rsquo;s defiant speech against invasion of the British Isles in 1940 - remember the words, &#8220;We shall never surrender.&#8221;</p>
<p>Teach your children to respect themselves, teach them to value their particular heritage.  Do genalogical work and construct your stories and teach them.  If our youth value their ancestors they will not so easily throw that away for the sake of being hip and cool.  That road is just about exhausted by Obama now and is becoming transparent.  The likely failures of his administration will deflate these Obama Idolitors.  Young people are only so stupid.  White kids are not all dumb and the smartest will survive as Whites and that is what counts.  YOU HELP THEM NOW.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The most amazing thing was watching all the young white people walking towards Grant Park on the night of the election; truly the face of stupidity for the New Amerika.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to secondcity.blogspot, a web site run by Chicago police officers, the reason the Grant Park celebration was so peaceful was that 70 percent of the tickets were given to whites.</p>
<p>Obama was behind bullet proof glass because of the black Chicagoan&rsquo;s custom of firing guns wildly at New Year&rsquo;s, 4th of July and other holidays.  There were worries that blacks would smuggle guns past security and start firing them when the news came that Obama won.</p>

			<p><i>&#8220;Among the Mexicans, Salvadorans and the other Third World nationalities, there was something like ecstasy. They grasped the real significance of this moment. They knew it meant that America had finally switched sides in a global cultural war.&#8221;  </i> </p>
<p>I think Hitchens has expressed it very well for me; and I absolutely agree. </p>
<p><i>This &ldquo;ecstasy&rdquo; on the part of the Third World&rsquo;s minions and the &ldquo;secular humanist&rdquo; white fools who support this man, have only won a battle and it is not like the Battle of Normandy was for the Allies, but more like Battle of Stalingrad was for the Axis. </i> </p>
<p>a)  I consider myself to be a &#8220;secular humanist&#8221;, one  who is also loyal, white, and racially aware.  I assure you I was definitely NOT in ecstasy, and I certainly did NOT support him!   Do you know what you&rsquo;re talking about? You&rsquo;re just babbling.<br>
b)  For the Axis (and ultimately the white race) the Battle of Stalingrad was no tactical victory!  It was the beginning of the end. What nonsense!  You&rsquo;re babbling again. Only an anti-white communist would describe it as a victory.</p>

			<p><i>&#8220;After all, for so many fools he was the &ldquo;second coming&rdquo; and that he is not&hellip;. And the fact that those who support him are fools with hopelessly unrealistic expectations, means that he is going to be fighting an up hill battle from the minute he takes the oath of office. Once that is done, and the sun does not mystically heat the earth to a comfortable 80 degrees free of humidity and we are all not magically freed of all anxieties, his &ldquo;presidency&rdquo; will be in decline.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Regardless of whether he comes through with a cornucopia  of free goodies or not,  in the long run that doesn&rsquo;t really matter.   Naturally, the goodies would be nice, but even without them, his black and other nonwhite supporters have gotten what they want   &mdash;   an image of themseves in the White House.  The main goal has been achieved   &mdash;   the dethroning of the White Man.  That in itself is a racial triumph which can stand on its own.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I watched Comrade Obama&rsquo;s victory speech and I watched the faces of those in Grant Park that night and it was like looking at people lost in a trance, tears streaming down their faces. Some looked like they were going to faint. In my entire lifetime, I&rsquo;ve never seen such cult like worship for a man that none of us knows anything about. Gayle Sollenberger</p>
<p>  Yes, the look on their faces could only be compared to a display of religious ecstasy upon beholding the beatific vision of God himself.  This goes way beyond the rock concert screamers. It is indeed a pseudo religious cult, and it is not at all politically healthy. No politician or moral man merits such extreme adulation. However, I guess for diversity liberals a President Obama is their second coming. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Can you believe ANY white person with an ounce of racial consciousness voting for this guy.&#8221;</p>
<p>I can find it easy to believe. There are some white nationalists who are conscious Human Beings to go along with their belief in white-rights. I have a harder time, however, imagining average modern Americans reading some of the ultimatum-style comments on this web-zine and deciding they want to stick around and read everyday. Maybe IQ really is genetic, though, and it won&rsquo;t drop for them sticking around and reading. I stick around cause I&rsquo;m such a hard core case. Obviously, there is no real desire to get a white-rights movement going.</p>

			<p>&#8220;If Whites were ever worthy of world domination, and they were - it is because we are at our core, intelligent and ferocious fighters. Think of Winston Churchill&rsquo;s defiant speech against invasion of the British Isles in 1940 - remember the words, &ldquo;We shall never surrender.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes but Europeans were at war with each other. We massacred each other and that&rsquo;s one of the reasons that Europe and Europeans have come to their end. England, along with France, Spain, Holland, Belgium and Scandanavia has already surrendered to the Muslim/ Afican invasion. They are being murdered, raped and otherwise degraded.  Churchill was hot to trot for WWI and that War introduced the next one. All the European powers had to do was to asassinate Hitler before he became Chancellor. There would have been no WWII and no Holocaust.<br>

			<p>&#8220;You couldn&rsquo;t have said it any clearer or more accurately. What the (H) is wrong with white America? Our race has a track record of success in life, business, inventions, the arts, yet so many whites (in particular - white females) bow down to those who other than breathing air, reproducing and eating food, have done little else to move humanity forward. We are destroying our own race in the name of MULTICULTURALISM, what is wrong with so many of the white race?&#8221;</p>
<p>This is just my two cents but here goes.  Our gene pool is dirty.  Some Whites have been miscegenating for centuries with Indians and maybe a few blacks but there was always fresh injections of European DNA to purify it through immigration.  That&rsquo;s not the case anymore.  I&rsquo;d say 25% of White Americans  who would be classified as White aren&rsquo;t White genetically.  I think many of these people have an affinitiy for minorities because of a genetic connection to their populations.</p>

			<p>To GWS, regarding:</p>
<p>&#8220;The Axis lost big at Stalingrad. </p>
<p><br>
Someone posted a few days ago an author who said &#8216;The white race died at Stalingrad.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was neither a tactical nor a strategic victory, it was in both ways a defeat.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the best of humor, I think that you missed the point I was making, or that I was attempting to be wry and ironic while doing so. Please reread these sentences from that perspective:</p>
<p>&#8220;This &#8216;ecstasy&rsquo; on the part of the Third World&rsquo;s minions and the &#8216;secular humanist&rsquo; white fools who support this man, have only won a battle and it is not like the Battle of Normandy was for the Allies, but more like Battle of Stalingrad was for the Axis. They have achieved what looks to be a major &#8216;tactical&rsquo; success on paper; however, do they have the reserves to exploit it?&#8221;</p>
<p>My point was that to believe the Marxstream Media and Comrade BO&rsquo;s supporters, they have not just won a battle, but an entire war. That is exactly what the Germans and Hitler thought in the Spring and Summer of 1942, when they drove simultaneously into the Caucuses and at Stalingrad. So surprised and unprepared was Stalin and the Red Army for this attack on the southern front of their lines (they thought the attack would come at the center toward Moscow,)that they too thought this might be the knockout blow Hitler needed to win the war in Russia; after all, 70% of their oil came from this region and Stalingrad was its major transportation hub. </p>
<p>In the end, the Germans were overextended and the Reds figured this out, and the rest is as they say history.</p>
<p>That was the point I was making about Comrade Obama and his zombies, the have won some early and unexpected victories, but he and they have only won battles. Their war is to &#8220;transform&#8221; this country into the Utopian States of America and more or less multiculturally Communize it. All of this, in the face of ending a deep recession and a war against terror they do not feel is needed, but is a harsh reality of life?</p>
<p>Good luck to them, because I think they will need it and then some!</p>
<p>All the best GWS,</p>
<p>John PM!</p>

			<p>Soros bought the U. S. government, and made possible the installation of a socialist autocrat as his Vice-Regent. We&rsquo;ll never know how many 527 organizations, radical leftwing web blogs, and the like, were financed by George Soros. We&rsquo;ve been awed by the amount of money raised on behalf of Obama&rsquo;s election, much of it from anonymous, uncertified sources, including foreign sources, all illegal, that never will be identified. Likely Soros funded Obama support activites of at least equal dollar value. </p>
<p>He made no secret initially of his aims vis-a-vis the U. S. government and America&rsquo;s capitalistic socio-economic culture, not to mention his intent to impose tax-funded, unrestricted abortion and eliminate private ownership of firearms, both aims having worldwide scope in Soros&rsquo; world view. But since the election campaign burst into the open, he has been very, very quiet.</p>

			<p>In 1960, the World was 27% white and 9% black.  Today, those percentages are now reversed.  The white man is killing himself off.  Most European countries have fertility rates under 1.5 children per family, which means whites are losing ground.  The only place on Earth where whites are holding their population steady, with a 2.1 child per couple fertility rate is the US MidWest. But that is just holding steady.  Much of the MidEast, Africa, and India have fertility rates over 4 children per women.</p>
<p>At this rate, the future belongs to brown people.  Whites appear to be throwing in the towel.  No mas!  No mas.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a point in the History of Society when it becomes so pathologically soft and tender that among other things it sides even with those who harm it - Criminals - and does this quite seriously and honestly. This is now called - &#8220;Progress.&#8221;&#8220;</p>

<p>Actually, I like the quote from the wonderful 1967 movie &#8220;The President&rsquo;s Analyst&#8221; better:</p>
<p>V.I. Kydor Kropotkin: &#8220;Logic is on our side: this isn&rsquo;t a case of a world struggle between two divergent ideologies, of different economic systems. Every day your country becomes more socialistic and mine becomes more capitalistic. Pretty soon we will meet in the middle and join hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>and for those buying assault-style firearms only now:</p>
<p>V.I. Kydor Kropotkin: &#8220;Look, you want to save the world? You&rsquo;re the great humanitarian? Take the gun! (automatic AR-15)&#8221;  </p>

			<p>The left will not win the war although it has won this battle as John PM pointed out. The left is made up of non-competitive people, by which I don&rsquo;t mean those who believe in cooperation or something similar but who are rather incompetent and must rely on government aid to survive. Such types don&rsquo;t cause the Fall of Rome although they may skirmish a bit with the legions. The Romans gave the rabble games and that will be the strategy in this case too, I think. <br>
While we wait out the games we should keep in mind that soon a wave of very cold reality will wash over the nation and may in fact cause a sincere re-examination of our nation&rsquo;s future (read &#8220;A Nation at Risk&#8221;). We are squaring off against the East Asian nations who have a profoundly more functional educational system than we do. They produce more scientific research, better cars and much of everything else. They aren&rsquo;t going begging to the Feds for help; quite the reverse. We are in hock to them. They also could give a rip about our &#8220;racial problems&#8221;, being unapologetically racist themselves. The tides of change are going out on the sentimental left. </p>

			<p>Hitchens, with all due respect, is either a moron or entirely duplicitous. He routinely criticizes mass immigration and the deconstruction of traditional morality, ethnnicity, and gender, while lambasting falling moral standards, but at the same time pours derision on the one political party in the UK whose policies actually coincide with his own professed views, namely the BNP. </p>
<p>My belief is that he intends to serve as an ineffective emotional vent for angry Whites, like a lot of your talk radio johnnies.</p>

			<p>While most of the posts on this topic have been very good and some of the mistaken ones have been corrected it is important to stress the likely, near certain, consequences of this event on national demographics (as one poster in fact did).   Of course with a Democratic majority in congress, neocons ruling the so-called opposition party, and the media acting as part of his election campaign, this fundamental violation of the US constitution will likely be swept under the rug along with so much else. </p>
<p> The major problem is not that Obama is an corrupt, racist, self-absorbed, make-believe black, pandering opportunist elected by masses of morons, although that is one problem.  The real problem is that his election signals the literal deconstruction of any remaining elements of our national borders.  As a consequence, one which is entirely predictable, the country will experience not only the legalization of some 30 million illegals (overwhelmingly non-white, low IQ and often criminal) here already with the stroke of Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;presidential&#8221; pen, but that many more scores of millions will begin to pour across the now truly open borders from all over the third world at a rate never before witnessed in our country&rsquo;s history.  What that will produce is a very rapid, by historical standards nearly instantaneous, transformation of the US into a third world state, one which will surely reelect Obama who will stand as the symbol of the New America.  </p>
<p>By the year 2016, at the end of his second term, the US will be a majority non-white slum (and this not only because of massive non-white third world immigration but also because of historically unmatched levels of upper class whites leaving the country permanently).  There are no real forces left in America to successfully oppose this demographic/political nexus and none will be able to even halt its rate of increase, much less to actually halt or reverse it (both of which would be necessary for the US to have any chance of survival as a white majority nation).</p>
<p>Thus, in a very real sense Hutchins&rsquo; point about the end of America is correct.  He is of course mistaken in his remark about Mandella, who did nothing but sit in a comfortable jail cell for years until &#8220;liberated&#8221; by a deluded West to serve as a symbol of black rule and to those who actually knew him as a symbol of the triumph of a debased black form of Marxism and a species of black nationalism only possible in a country whose majority black population has an average IQ of 70 (a number which represents moderate to severe mental retardation).  I hope that all of the whites who voted for our new &#8220;president&#8221; sleep well in their beds for the little time that they have remaining before they see those beds redistributed to the newly arrived black African couple from across town whose combined IQ nearly equals that of today&rsquo;s average white physician.  It is they who truly deserve what is coming and not the majority of white males who voted en mass against the coming racist Kleptocracy.  What is unfortunate and truly tragic is that we will all pay the price for their treason.</p>

What happens when everyone realizes that the average Black IQ is still only 85?<br>
Posted by 3:20 PM<br>
  &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;   <br>
The reality is that <b>everyone WON&rsquo;T realize it. </b> They can have the reality right in front of them, staring them in the face, and they STILL won&rsquo;t recognize it! </p>
<p>Black IQ is one of the forbidden truths that can never be acknowledged or taken into consideration. It&rsquo;s taboo.  And so, to a lesser extent, are the various black pathologies.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen this over and over again for at least the past 40 years in so many failed social experiments, so by now  it&rsquo;s nothing new.   But still, people won&rsquo;t face uncomfortable truths or place the blame where it should go. </p>
<p>Therefore, it will be interesting to see whatever is coming during the next four years, but I suspect that &#8220;white racism&#8221; or white obstruction will be blamed when things don&rsquo;t work out as planned    &mdash;   as usual.</p>

			<p>Peter writes and sounds more like I than I! The fact that he writes sarcastically does not mean that it is not true.</p>
<p>Attitudes are changing! Yesterday I went to my local Wal Mart to pick up a few items. Consequently I wound up in the fast check out lane when a unique incident occurred. </p>
<p>A little old white woman, obviously from somewhere up North, probably Brooklyn, was in front of me. In front of her was a politically correct African - American woman who was obviously having a hard time manipulating the machine designed for debit and/or credit card purchases.</p>
<p>The more the black woman worked the machine the more frustrated the lady in front of me became. She became so frustrated that she started waving her arms about and gesticulating in obscene gestures. Oh boy, was I enjoying this!</p>
<p>Finally, the little Yankee had had enough and she said: &#8220;Look here all you have to do is to push this little button, here, right here, push the G.D. button, push it right here, my God how G.D. hard can this be?&#8221;</p>
<p>Immediately the African - American turned around and said: &#8220;Keep you G.D. mouth shut we are in power now, I&rsquo;ll take as long as I want.&#8221; As you would expect, white people in my line started leaving for the other lines at this point in time   &mdash;   but, not I, I, of course, had to stay since I&rsquo;VE had training in &#8220;mediation!&#8221; </p>
<p>The little white woman in front of me then turns around and shrugs with a lot more hopeless gestures when I [yes I, in  my very, very best mediator like voice] pops off with: &#8220;Well now now there there bless your little ole heart - I understand - about having to endure all of this and all after having just voted for Senator Obama too - I understand, I understand, all of this must be so, well so especially galling for you now!&#8221; </p>
<p>Well you would think that HELL HAD JUST BROKEN LOOSE IN ALABAMA [but rest assured, old MoMo was still dealing the cards]!</p>
<p>The African - American then turns on me and in a very loud,loud voice, loud enough for most, if not the entire store to hear with:&#8221;AND YOU, YOU AIN&rsquo;T NOTTIN BUT A G.D.RACIST YOURSELF TOO!!!</p>
<p>{Me? I thought what the hell did I do? - I&rsquo;m just here for some cat food!}</p>
<p>BUT, as you would expect!</p>
<p>The little Brooklyn woman was now busy joining in with her former adversary:&#8221;SHE&rsquo;S RIGHT!!! THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH RACE! I AM NOT A RACIST! I DID VOTE FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA AND PROUD OF IT, SO WHAT? THIS ISN&rsquo;T ABOUT RACE, I AM NOT A RACIST ETC. ETC.!!</p>
<p>Which as anyone who knows me, knows just how badly hurt and crushed I was and all, with those unkind comments coming at me from every direction [furthermore the cashier looked to be about a three to four hundred pound African - American lady who was just dying to join in as well] - but I just continued to politely smile as I softly responded (in my best Southern drawl): And see ladies, just how much you all both have in common here after all, since with respect to me, you are both correct!&#8221; </p>
<p>Then, having found someone to hate more than each other( while  trying to figure out if I had just admitted to being a racist), they became fast friends while I left with my cat food for another lane before security arrived. </p>
<p>Another victory for mediation and diversity!</p>

The next time some Afro type makes some comment in the vein of &#8220;da man keeping da black man down&#8221;, I&rsquo;ll reply &#8220;which man? You mean YOUR president&#8221;?<br>
They&rsquo;re just not realistically going to be able to use that excuse anymore, and that&rsquo;s a GOOD thing.</p>
