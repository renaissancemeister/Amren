<h1><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122576113489495571.html">Milwaukee Puts a Vote-Fraud Cop Out of Business</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Fund, Wall Street Journal, Nov. 4, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Last week Mike Sandvick, head of the Milwaukee Police Department&rsquo;s five-man Special Investigative Unit, was told by superiors not to send anyone to polling places on Election Day. He was also told his unit &mdash; which wrote the book on how fraud could subvert the vote in his hometown &mdash; would be disbanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know what to look for,&rdquo; he told me, &ldquo;and that scares some people.&rdquo; In disgust, Mr. Sandvick plans to retire. (A police spokeswoman claims the unit isn&rsquo;t being disbanded and that any changes to the unit &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t significant.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>In February, Mr. Sandvick&rsquo;s unit released a 67-page report on what it called an &ldquo;illegal organized attempt to influence the outcome of (the 2004) election in the state of Wisconsin&rdquo; &mdash; a swing state whose last two presidential races were decided by less than 12,000 votes.</p>
<p>The report found that between 4,600 and 5,300 more votes were counted in Milwaukee than the number of voters recorded as having cast ballots. Absentee ballots were cast by people living elsewhere; ineligible felons not only voted but worked at the polls; transient college students cast improper votes; and homeless voters possibly voted more than once.</p>
<p>Much of the problem resulted from Wisconsin&rsquo;s same-day voter law, which allows anyone to show up at the polls, register and then cast a ballot. ID requirements are minimal. If someone lacks any ID, he can vote so long as someone who lives in the same city vouches for him. The report found that in 2004 a total of 1,305 &ldquo;same day&rdquo; voters gave information that was declared &ldquo;un-enterable&rdquo; or invalid by election officials.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mr. Sandvick&rsquo;s report concluded &ldquo;the one thing that could eliminate a large percentage of the fraud&rdquo; it found would be elimination of same-day voter registration (which is also in use in seven other states). It also suggested that voters present a photo ID at the polls, a requirement the U.S. Supreme Court declared constitutional this spring.</p>
<p>But weeks after the vote fraud report was released, Wisconsin Sen. Russ Feingold introduced federal legislation to mandate same-day registration in every state. He claimed the system had worked well in Wisconsin and if &ldquo;we can bring more people into the process, [it] only strengthens our democracy.&rdquo; Democrats tell me his bill is a top priority of the new Congress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say voter fraud isn&rsquo;t a problem,&rdquo; notes Mr. Sandvick, &ldquo;but after this election it may be all too clear it is.&rdquo; Now that Mr. Sandvick is resigning from the force after a long, honorable career, let&rsquo;s hope someone else is allowed to follow up on the spadework he&rsquo;s done.<br>

			<p>Democrats, contrary to their wailing about &#8220;voter fraud&#8221; in the 2000 and 2004 actually want voter fraud to occur because they know it overwhelmingly favors them.</p>

			<p>     I&rsquo;ll bet this is happening in all the big cities. See the above article about Philadelphia. Of course, if the Republicans had any brains, they would have their own people and cameras out documenting everything that goes on. Maybe some of you out there know the answer to this: what would happen if there are so many law suits concerning the election that the outcome is not resolved in time for the inauguration? Who takes over ?</p>

			<p>There has been so much Democratic voter fraud in this election, I think they should just do a hard reset and start over.</p>

			<p>In other news, a typical white liberal Obama supporter makes a statement.</p>
<p>AP ^ | MONDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 2008<br>
SANTA BARBARA, Calif. – A masked gunman waving an American flag and a handgun on a freeway overpass surrendered to police Monday after forcing a traffic shutdown for hours. The man gave himself up at midmorning west of downtown Santa Barbara at Highway 101, a major route along the California coast. No shots were fired. Traffic was backed at least three miles in each direction. The man agreed to give up after he was allowed to attach a Barack Obama campaign sign and the flag to the overpass railing, said police Sgt. Jim Pfleging. </p>
<p>There were also black panther thugs at a polling place in Stamford Conn.</p>

			<p>Spake Sen. Feingold: &#8220;&hellip;if we can bring more people into the process, it only strengthens our democracy.&#8221; </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just what it does - and that is why this modern &#8220;democracy&#8221; will be the death of America and the west!!! This &#8220;democracy&#8221; is government by the herd! An organized slave-revolt! As I write this, the returns are coming in fast and furiously, and it looks like the Mulatto Messia has risen from the tomb! This is the disasterous result of &#8220;democracy.&#8221;  </p>

<p>The resultant fraud and inaccuracy will destroy any integrity in our election process. </p>
<p>This is where the 15th and 19th Amendments, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Democratic Party have taken us in the name of &#8220;democracy.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Ironic, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>And on the subject of &#8220;one person = one vote,&#8221; how &#8216;bout we dilute ours even further by importing a few million more unassimilable but register-able immigrants? </p>

			<p>It is unfortunate that the only way to prevent this sort of fraud is national I.D. It is even more unfortunate that the major opposition to this are the Republicans. The Democrats-socialist-communists are only to happy to have this, it is true that with this they can control, but it is equally true that with a national I.D. there can be no voter fraud, nor can there be illegal immigration unchecked. I am all for the I.D., honesty will always prevail.</p>

			<p>The problem with this country is that the only viable opposition to the Democrats is the Republicans.  And the Republicans have proven themselves to be a useless opposition on anything that matters   &mdash;   illegal immigration, mass immigration, deficits, affirmative action.  So now we have a Democratic House, a Democratic Senate, and the most left wing President of my lifetime.  Legalized voter fraud is just the beginning of what we can expect.  Unless there is mass organizing to the contrary an illegal immigrant amnesty is now almost a forgone conclusion.  After all, Democrats know that 80% of those illegal immigrants will vote Democratic, as soon as they are able to do so.  I expect to see a serious ratcheting up of racial quotas and set asides, and a lot more meddling by government in general.</p>
<p>I weep for my country.<br>

<p>Obama is not merely the most left wing president in your lifetime.  He is the most leftwing american president ever.  He is the most left wing nominee of one of the two major parties ever.</p>

			<p>I have read many posts on Amren on the subject of succession.<br>
This makes more and more sense to me. This country grows more innimical to me and my family by the hour.<br>
Do we European American people not have a right to our own autonomy and destiny?<br>
The state where I live is a good example of where we are headed as a people. Esentially a state of slavery. We will become national examples of this paradigm. Unless we take positive and timely action.<br>
Living in the peoples republic of california is like living in hostile enemy territory. It is only bound to become exponentially worse with an anti White marxist in the white house and social marxists controlling every branch of this bankrupt state and nation<br>
The choice seems simple. Succesion or extinction. I would much prefer the former.<br>
I was allowed a divorce from my last wife based on the grounds that we had irreconcilable differences. It was a relatively painless process. <br>
This is the only humane solution. <br>
