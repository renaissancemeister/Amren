<h1><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=6175137">Fla. School Will Remain Named after KKK Leader</a></h1>
 

<p>Ron Word, AP, Nov. 4, 2008</p>

</div> 



<p>A Florida school board voted late Monday night to keep the name of a Confederate general and early Ku Klux Klan leader at a majority black high school, despite opposition from a black board member who said the school&rsquo;s namesake was a &ldquo;terrorist and racist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After hearing about three hours of public comments, Duval County School Board members voted 5-2 to the retain the name of Nathan Bedford Forrest High School. The board&rsquo;s two black members cast the only votes to change the name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;(Forrest) was a terrorist and a racist,&rdquo; argued board member Brenda Priestly Jackson, who is black.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The board listened to passionate arguments from those on both sides. More than 140 people crowded into the meeting room, with another 20 watching the meeting on a television in the lobby.</p>
<p>Many urged a name change, saying the Forrest name was an insult.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Forrest High School, which has received two consecutive &ldquo;F&rdquo; grades on state assessment tests, opened as an all-white school in the 1950s. Its name was suggested by the Daughters of the Confederacy, who saw it as a protest to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that eventually integrated the nation&rsquo;s public schools.</p>
<p>But now more than half Forrest High&rsquo;s students are black.</p>
<p>The issue has come up several times during the past half-century, but the School Board has never changed the name. Jacksonville has three other schools named after Confederate generals, but it also has schools named after civil rights icons.</p>
