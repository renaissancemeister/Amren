<h1>Proposition 8 Hostility &lsquo;Got Out of Hand,&rsquo; Assembly Speaker Says</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Aurelio Rojas, Sacramento Bee, November 19, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Assembly Speaker Karen Bass said today she is &#8220;appalled&#8221; at the hostility that has been directed at African-Americans since the passage of Proposition 8.</p>
<p>According to exit polls, 70 percent of black voters supported the gay marriage ban measure, which has caused friction between gays and blacks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I have friends in Los Angeles, who are African-Americans in the (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) community, and they went out to protest the vote and had racial epithets hurled at them,&#8221; Bass said. &#8220;A couple of them were fearful and they left because they were threatened.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I do think that people have pulled back a way from some of the hostility &mdash; I mean it got out of hand,&#8221; [Bass] said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bass said supporters leaders in the gay community need to do a better job of outreach in the black community.</p>
<p>She said that while campaigning for an Assembly candidate in San Diego, she was surprised when a group of African-American ministers told her they supported Proposition 8 because of &#8220;liability&#8221; concerns.</p>
<p>The speakers said the ministers were worried they would be sued by gay church members if they declined to marry them.</p>

		<p>If these Blacks &#8220;had racial epithets hurled at them&#8221; by White HETEROSEXUAL males you can be absolutely sure that they would have been arrested and charged with &#8216;hate crimes&rsquo;.  It wouldn&rsquo;t be phrased, &#8220;need to do a better job of outreach&#8221;.  It would have been described as out and out &#8220;Hate&#8221;.  Just another example of this racial double-standard that is only getting worse and worse with time.</p>

		<p>Expect the same hostility when whites march for any of their white-rights causes. There&rsquo;s little effort given to conditioning blacks about &#8216;tolerance&rsquo;. Interracial crime statistics bear that out. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just say it&rsquo;s the blacks and homosexuals who find themselves victims of hate - robbery, murder, and sex crimes, and call it a day&hellip;  </p>

		<p>I hate it when gay people compare their struggles to that of blacks during the civil rights movement. Sayings blacks should be more accepting  of them and their marriages.  We have a hard enough time getting heterosexuals to marry and now they want us to support them?<br>
 There are no water fountains or entrances that have homosexual women only or heterosexual women only signs. These people can hide the fact they&rsquo;re gay  and deny it if questioned, but we can&rsquo;t hide who we are. So there really is no comparing the two. <br>

		<p>Intolerance of homosexuality is a sign of backwardness and ignorance, like, say, trashing all of modern science and claiming that dinosaurs bestrode the Earth in biblical times.</p>
<p>This kind of thinking will turn the US into a 3rd world country without any help from foreignors.</p>
<p>In Europe - where I live - the biggest reason for whites turning against the Islamization of Europe are the frighteningly retrograde social views of Muslims - toward women and gays in particular.</p>
<p>Modern Europeans may not worship &#8220;the gay lifestyle,&#8221; but the attitude is live and let live, so the though of their gay friends and colleagues being butchered in the subways and on the streets by immigrants outrages them, as it should. </p>
<p>Tolerance of homosexuality is an index of whether a community is backward or modern.</p>
<p>Any gays you see on the street are there protesting for their right to be gay AT HOME, ALL ALONE, WITH THEIR PARTNERS, AFTER WORKING 10 HOURS; but with secure health, life, and pension insurance. </p>
<p>BtW: Most gays &amp; lesbians can no more &#8220;pass&#8221; then blacks can - where did that wacky idea come from!<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been hearing about this in Massachusetts  &mdash;  -and some people blame their usual scapegoat (those Mormons who have soooooo much power in California!) *eyes rolling*  I keep pointing out to them that Prop 8 would not have passed were it not for the black and Hispanic vote, that it would NOT have passed among European American voters.  And I gotta say, I&rsquo;ve said this in groups of people and you know what, people don&rsquo;t deny it, they know I&rsquo;m speaking the truth even if they are afraid to say it themselves. And I hope the LGB community is finally admitting to themselves that blacks are not, and never were, friends or allies.  Left-wing California is finally reaping what they sowed.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t you just love this. One of the most liberal understanding groups (Gays) acting in a racist way, just what is the world coming to? We are also told that the black vote of 70-30 for 8 was because of their conservative leanings. What utter nonsense, the vote went this way because gays are detested in the black commumnity, more so than in any other ethnic group. The truth is that blacks couldn&rsquo;t care less about any kind of marriage, gay or straight. Just look at their rates of marriage. It&rsquo;s just another White Man&rsquo;s Thing.</p>

<p>The Gay movement has been instrumental in turning western nations We won&rsquo;t fo into the kinds of places that are incapable of defending themselves from the non-wester onslaught.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tolerance of homosexuality is an index of whether a community is backward or modern.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah, right.  Victorian England? 1950s America?  Backward.  Ancient Sparta?  Modern.</p>
<p>The California Supreme Court has agreed to hear challenges to Proposition 8.  Bear in mind that Prop 8 is a constititutional amendment.  So the CA supreme court may well rule that the California constitution is &#8220;unconstitutional&#8221;.  Another gross judicial usurpation that could set a lasting precedent.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s happened in Canada, Massachuetts and other areas where gay marriage is legal.  The perpetually offended and National Lawyers Guild ACLU ADL NOW attorneys also have their greedy eyes on florists, caterers etc who may be hesitant about agreeing to produce a gay wedding.</p>
<p>Agreeing to do a gay wedding will not be enough.  Soon the ministers, florists etc will be sued for making the gay couple and their gay guests &#8220;uncomfortable.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Then will come the federally funded jobs running brainwashing sessions to ensure that the guys who deliver the flowers or tables and chairs do nothing that might &#8220;offend&#8221; the perpetually offended. </p>
<p>Looks like the California supreme court will over turn Prop 8.  After all, it was the California supreme court that suddenly discovered the &#8220;right&#8221; of gay marriage.</p>
<p>Once the perpetually aggrieved have achieved legal gay marriage,what will their next demand be?  There will be a demand, too many people make a living working for federally and liberal foundation funded gay non profit groups.</p>

<p>San Francisco liberals and gays adore their mulitcultural city.  But they forget that with a population about 70 percent Asian and growing, multiculturalism will soon end and San Francisco will be Asian, with all the Asian conservative social values.</p>

Tolerance of homosexual marriage is a sign of a degenerate society. The expansion of Islam and the expansion of rights for homosexuals go hand-in-hand. The expansion of homosexual rights needed an ideology to provide cover for the degenerate life style of the atheistic  reprobates ofthe modern and trendy Western European.It provides protection and cover  for pedaphiles such as Pete Townsend who deserves to spend  at least five years in jail. The ideology that provides cover for the degenerate life style of Europeans is the ideology of multiculturalism and diversity. And now the chickens are commimg home to roost. I&rsquo;m really growing to despise Western Europeans these days. Western European culture has devolved into a culture of athiestic hedonism&hellip;which is another way of saying that it has no culture.</p>

		<p>The gay establishment still tries to hide the fact that almost all the gay bashing and harassement is committed by hispanic and black thugs.  The gay establishment claims that the beatings, robberies and harassement is done by knuckle dragging, evil whitey.</p>
<p>But the rank and file knows who calls them names, who menaces them, who robs, beats and rapes them.  A lot of the antagonism against blacks over the gay marriage issue is just pent up anger over 50 years of black and hispanic on white gay crime. White lesbians are no more immune against rape by their beloved black brethern than are evil hetrosexual white women.</p>
<p>There was a horrible example of this a few years ago in Los Angeles.  A young man was walking to his car parked on a residential street a couple blocks from a gay club and bar area.</p>
<p>A group of 5l black thugs saw him, poured out of their car and attacked him with baseball bats.  They screamed &#8220;die white honky fa**ot&#8221; as they beat him.  The fact that they had the bats shows pre meditation.  </p>
<p>It was only about 10 pm.  The nieghbors were still awake.  Police were called. Residents got the license plate number.  Others yelled out &#8220;I&rsquo;ve called 911, the police are on the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>The thugs were caught a few blocks away.  The young man was severely injured.  He had severe brain damage as well as spinal, leg, arm rib and internal injuries.  He was only 27.  Last I heard, he was destined to spend the rest of his life in a nursing home.</p>
<p>The gay community, even the white hating gay establishment made a great effort to force the District Attorney to prosecute the beating as a hate crime.  The many witnesses all signed statements to the &#8220;kill the fa**ot&#8221; screams.</p>
<p>The police and district attorney, groveling to the blacks and ADL as usual, refused to classify this terrible crime as a hate crime because no crime against whites, no matter how vicious and racially motivated can be prosecuted or even classified as a hate crime.</p>
<p>Our local ADL went to the mat in favor of the blacks who shattered this young man&rsquo;s bones and brain to the point where he will spend the rest of his life helpless as a baby.</p>

		<p><i>Tolerance of homosexuality is an index of whether a community is backward or modern.</i></p>
<p>Why? Exactly what do modernity and homosexuality have to do with one another that you could even come up with such a ridiculous litmus test? Take the Chinese for example. I don&rsquo;t know how their legal system deals with gays, if at all, but societally it is immensely frowned upon, or so I&rsquo;ve been told by all the Chinese I&rsquo;ve known. Yet I&rsquo;d be hard pressed to call this huge nation with a booming economy and well on the path to true world-superpower status &#8220;backward.&#8221;</p>
<p>By contrast, we here in the states have never been more tolerant of homosexuality than we are right now, but I doubt even you would for a second deny that our societal and political progress is just about devolving. I do not believe that the latter is in any way a result of the former, but it still belies your statement.</p>
<p><i>Any gays you see on the street are there protesting for their right to be gay AT HOME, ALL ALONE, WITH THEIR PARTNERS, AFTER WORKING 10 HOURS; but with secure health, life, and pension insurance.</i></p>
<p>No, they&rsquo;re not. They&rsquo;re battling for dominance. Want health insurance for your partner? Find a carrier that offers it. There are none? Then maybe that is where the gays need to be focusing their efforts. The market will satisfy any demand if there is a profit to be made. Last I heard there is no law prohibiting such coverage. Same goes for the other things you mentioned. Marriage is ultimately unnecessary to these ends. So either the protesters are profoundly stupid (which, given the baseline for street protesters, can not be ruled out), or those are not their motives.</p>
<p>Personally, I couldn&rsquo;t give a damn what consenting adults do in their bedrooms, and I oppose any laws aimed at punishing personal behaviour when it does not harm others. But that&rsquo;s not what we&rsquo;re dealing with here. We&rsquo;re not even really dealing with a gay rights issue here. Marriage is not a right. What we really have here are hardcore leftists/anarchists who use gays as a convenient front group, much as they do with blacks, latinos, the environment, etc..</p>
<p>All that said, the gays are doing themselves no favors here. If they keep pulling stunts like raiding churches, yanking crosses off of old ladies&rsquo; necks, and going head-to-head with blacks, they&rsquo;re simply turning the populace whom they demand accept them against them. A populace which at best would like simply to be apart from them. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, I&rsquo;ll just sit back and enjoy the show.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Gay is a behavior which one can stop doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Posted by Tony Soprano. at 10:30 PM on November 19 </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that being gay is a behavior that can be stopped.  Someone who is gay can stop being with others of the same sex but I&rsquo;m sure it makes for a very unhappy life.  I think it&rsquo;s sad that the gay community as a whole is in such support of multi culturalism.  They adopted a rainbow flag in support of it.  </p>

		<p>The confusion is from the idea that blacks are really liberals, they aren&rsquo;t.  Blacks and the majority of non-whites are just anti-white, and as long as they benefit from liberalism and the left, they will support it.  The only true self-destructive liberals are whites who actively campaign for their own racial and cultural demise.</p>

		<p>The gays who are pro-diversity are in for a rude awakening.  Tolerance (in the modern world) for homosexuality seems to be a product of high-IQ Northwest European cultures.  </p>
<p>Primitive cultures incorporated homosexuality pretty much as a matter of habit&hellip;.never really thought about it&hellip;.didn&rsquo;t have words for it&hellip;.until missionaries and colonial governments taught them a new word, a new &#8216;sin&rsquo;, a new category of pseudospeciation to use against each other.  Nowadays, low-IQ primitives embrace gay-hating with particular zeal.  That&rsquo;s just another fact of life the liberal loonies refuse to acknowledge.</p>
<p>When we import the low end of the Bell Curve into this country, we import gay bashers.  Embracing racial diversity is the stupidest thing a gay American could do.  But gays who have tried to &#8216;gentrify&rsquo; black neighborhoods already know this from experience, and probably were among those hurling the reported &#8216;ethnic slurs&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Closer to home, in my own experience, the Jews I know whose parents owned businesses in Black areas are not among the rabid Obama-lovers.  Nor are they among those who view open borders as a good thing.  Experience is a good teacher. And you have far nicer experiences dealing with whites of Northwest European descent (&#8216;Traditional Americans&rsquo;).</p>
<p>Economically sub-par Gays and Jews have traditionally come to inhabit marginal neighborhoods less insulated from the realities of non-white America.  Predictably, these groups have seen more than their share of violent attacks by black and brown bigots.  But the problem has moved beyond the ghetto, and  the danger is spreading toward those of us who have been more fortunate.</p>
<p>The Gays and Jews who are Obama supporters and diversity mavens will live to regret their support of foolish causes.  The changes that are soon to transmogrify this wonderful country will not bring good things for Gays or for Jews.  Both our communities will realize, too late, that America&rsquo;s much demonized &#8216;White Male Hegemony&rsquo; actually offered the best of all possible worlds.</p>

<p>You make a number of assertions but offer nothing in the way of evidence to support them.  No surprise there!</p>
<p>These are indisputable facts:</p>
<p>1) In 1973 the American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from its diagnostic list of mental disorders.  This despite substantial protest from psychiatrists and psychologists.  Their decision was due more to pressure from homosexual advocacy groups and less any &#8220;enlightening&#8221; new evidence.  It should also be noted homosexuality wasn&rsquo;t declassified as a mental illness in international circles until 1992.</p>
<p>https://www.narth.com/docs/whitehead.html</p>
<p>2) There is a substantially higher rate of other forms of mental illness (depression, anxiety, etc) among homosexuals than heterosexuals.  This is found even in historically &#8220;gay friendly&#8221; societies like the Netherlands (see above link).</p>
<p>3) Despite all the myths and shibboleths, one thing remains true: STDs are far more common among &#8220;gays&#8221; than heterosexuals.  Sex between male homoesexuals is largely responsible for the resurgence of syphilis, a disease epidemiologists once thought was almost beaten.</p>

<p>I was a history buff in college.  I recall hearing even back then the canard that persecution of homosexuals is inversely correlated with a society&rsquo;s &#8220;advancement.&#8221;  One small problem: advances in the arts, music, science and technology were occurring even while homosexuals were being jailed or kept &#8220;in the closet.&#8221;</p>

		<p>One can be tolerant of homosexuality without being in favor of homosexual marriage.  First, note that homosexuals have exactly the same right that heterosexuals have   &mdash;   to marry a person of the opposite sex.  In 48 states neither homosexuals nor heterosexuals have the right to marry a person of the same sex.  So homosexual marriage is a new &#8220;right&#8221; being invented, it is not simply applying to homosexuals a right that heterosexuals already have.  (BTW, I would like to ask the advocates of homosexual marriage whether we should further extend human freedom by allowing people to marry consenting farm animals.  If no, is this because of religious bigotry on your part?  If yes, have you informed your supporters of how far you plan to take this issue?)</p>
<p>The central problem in this new &#8220;right&#8221; of homosexual marriage is whether it is really a good idea to have children be raised by homosexuals.  After all, once there is homosexual marriage there is legal adoption of children by homosexuals (married lesbians can also make babies via heterosexual adultery).  I think a child should be raised by a mother and a father, not by two mommies or two daddies.  If this experiment of homosexual parenting fails there will be innocent victims.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there is no rational debate about this.  Instead, all opponents of gay marriage are portrayed as ignorant, hateful, religious bigots.</p>
<p>As for black views on homosexuality, anyone who has listened to Farrakhan rant about &#8220;faggots&#8221; knows that there is a substantial segment of the black community that isn&rsquo;t too keen on the practice.  This can come as a surprise only to the cloistered academic advocates of diversity.</p>

		<p>An amusing comedy unfolding in California to be sure! I agree with S.L. Cain that tolerance of homosexuality is generally the hallmark of an advanced society. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t doubt that the behavior is unhealthy and that most homosexuals have other psychological disorders, but if it were not for the fact that the homosexual agenda is lumped in with the rest of the destructive multicultural agenda, then I don&rsquo;t see why it is necessarily harmful on a societal level.</p>
<p>To me it bickering over these lifestyle issues is largely pointless when you are being displaced and dispossessed. Do you think the whites in Zimbabwe fret over the persecution of homosexuals? <br>

		<p>HH, I also have been wryly amused over another incident involving the media&rsquo;s confusion over whom to side with, blacks or gays. You may recall the case of a black man who accepted a ride with 2 white guys, then claimed he had to kill them in self-defense because they were attempting to assault him sexually. The media was so mixed up, they did not slant the story either way. </p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t say that voting for Prop 8 is automatically a sign of intolerance of homosexuality, in terms of homosexual people living their lives and being treated with dignity.  </p>
<p>I voted for it because I don&rsquo;t want kids to grow up learing that &#8220;Marriage is a union of any two Human beings,&#8221; because I don&rsquo;t believe that myself.  <br>
I want them to learn that marriage is a relationship that by it&rsquo;s very definition is about one of each gender.  </p>
<p>If I thought I was discriminating by voting for it, I wouldn&rsquo;t have done so.  </p>
<p>There are no &#8220;rights&#8221; that a person gains getting married, an unmarried couple can do absolutely everything that a married couple can do.  Live together, sleep together, share bills, whatever.  You don&rsquo;t gain any specific rights by going through a marriage ceremony.  It&rsquo;s purely symbolic ceremony that says &#8220;you are now a husband and wife in the eyes of society,&#8221; that&rsquo;s all it is.  It&rsquo;s also the bedrock of society, because kids learn things from each parental figure (gender) that they wouldn&rsquo;t learn with just one or the other.</p>
<p>Gay marriage wasn&rsquo;t about rights, it was about forcing society to change the definition from marriage = husband + wife to marriage = husband + husband.</p>
<p>A &#8220;union&#8221; if you will.  Call it a union if you like.  A partnership.  A coupling.  Call it anything you want, but not a marriage.  Marriage is for men and women.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to be a Christian, I&rsquo;m not a Christian, an Atheist or Agnostic or a Muslim or a Buddhist or anything else can see the importance of it.  </p>

Posted by Tony Soprano</p>
<p><br>
Sorry. Being &#8220;gay&#8221; is not <i>behavior.</i>  It is <i>orientation. </i><br>
Being homosexual is NOT an activity, and neither is heterosexuality an activity. They are internal, just as being black is external. Could you stop being heterosexual if you just made up your mind?</p>
<p>PS. I&rsquo;m not in favor of &#8220;gay marriage&#8221;, but marriage is a whole other thing from the above. I don&rsquo;t see why the two should be confused.  Marriage is also separate from being heterosexual; not every heterosexual is married either.</p>

<p>Yes, and murders them too. The above statement is very true.  That&rsquo;s because the   &#8220;gay<i> establishment&#8221;  </i>(so called) has been taken over and is controlled by extreme Leftists, generally the Usual Suspects - as are virtually all of the  parties, groups and institutions that exist throughout our society. You don&rsquo;t have to be gay to encounter the phenomenon.  It is a common problem that is seen everywhere.  It began long ago.  It&rsquo;s all part of  &#8220;The March Through the Institutions&#8221;.</p>

		<p>The confusion is from the idea that blacks are really liberals, they aren&rsquo;t. <br>
Blacks and the majority of non-whites are just anti-white;  as long as they benefit from liberalism and the left, they will support it. <br>
Posted by 5:19 PM</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it in a nutshell.  They&rsquo;re look at what&rsquo;s in it for them.  They sponsor liberal programs that are beneficial to THEM. </p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in favor of their program, but not in favor of yours. You and your program can go drop dead.  So it will be when whites are the minority. This example is a good warning.</p>
<p>As with everything, it&rsquo;s all gimme this, gimme that;  but for them alone.</p>

<p>  -Well, being gay I have to say I disagree with that. I have never and would never engage in public displays of affection, or march in the leud and explicit &#8216;pride parades&rsquo;, I realize and accept the fact that a majority of Americans do not support same-sex marriage and I respect and understand the fact that some people (rightly or wrongly) prefer  homesexuality to be kept largely in the &#8216;closet&rsquo;. The only expectation I have is that the cops aren&rsquo;t gonna come storming into my private house and haul we away for consenting behavior with an adult behind closed doors. As for blacks, -because this is AMREN- many of them are hyper- masculine, so it doesn&rsquo;t surprise me that so many hate gays. I do not and have never considered them as allies in any way.</p>

Posted by at 9:22 AM<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.<br>
I don&rsquo;t think so.  From the various people I&rsquo;ve talked to and what I&rsquo;ve read, it&rsquo;s much more about practical considerations such as inheritance laws, leases, Social Security benefits, and such matters.</p>
<p>However, I personally believe it would be best to address those areas directly, rather than attemptting to change the marriage laws.  Why have to  get married in order to receive Soc. Secuity?  It seems silly and unnecessary to me.   Just change the S.S. regulations.<br>
 <br>
I&rsquo;ll go a step further and say that, to me,  marriage isn&rsquo;t even so much about a man and woman as it is about children and perpetuation of the species. Marriage is about family.  Anyone can &#8220;shack up&#8221;  togethether. And many today do   &mdash;   of all gender preferences. But the whole purpose of marriage - ever since the most ancient times - is not to get Social Security checks; it&rsquo;s  to provide a stable home for the raising of the next generation. That&rsquo;s what marriage should be all about. That and nothing else.</p>
<p>That central fact seems to be lost on nearly everybody, on all sides of this issue.  No wonder we are failing to reproduce ourselves and are in such a demographic bind.  Disgregarding all concerns of the group, we have been led astray by rampant individualism and an obsession with material considerations and can&rsquo;t see the forest for the trees.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll bet that most immigrant groups voted against homsexual marriage: Chinese, middle easterners, Russians, etc.  They understand that the foundation of society is a heterosexual couple having biological children.  </p>
<p>This ties two families together (gee the baby has grandpa Jones&rsquo; eyes and grandma Smith&rsquo;s hair)and provides more family support for the couple and children over time.</p>
<p>Homosexual marriage is just one more symptom in a society that abandons older relatives, encourages promiscuity and lets the TV babysit the kids.  Nowadays its the internet rather than playing with the kid down the block that occupies Johnny and Jenny after school.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not very religious and believe in live and let live generally, but this is the path we are going down and it goes against nature.</p>
<p>Male homosexuals spread diseases like syphilis that were once almost erased with penicilin because they have so much sex with strangers.  Even &#8220;married&#8221; gays tend to cheat on their partners regularly.</p>
<p>Lesbians tend to hate men and destabilize anyplace that they exist because they don&rsquo;t fit in to the mode that nature obviously intended.  Dykes are angry and are not something that women should aspire to be.</p>
