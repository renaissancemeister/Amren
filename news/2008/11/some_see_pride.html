<h1><a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/falkenberg/6105693.html">Some See Pride in Obama&rsquo;s Win As Wrong</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lisa Falkenberg, Houston Chronicle, November 10, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some of my fellow whites apparently are feeling a bit confused, disturbed and even threatened by all the smiling, chest-puffing, Obama T-shirt-wearing black folks strutting around like they run the country or something.</p>
<p>Well, finally, for the first time in our nation&rsquo;s history, someone who looks like them will be running the country. Can we blame them for celebrating?</p>
<p>Yes, apparently, we can. Where some of us see pride, and share in it, others see divisiveness.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought this election was not about race, but that&rsquo;s pretty much all I&rsquo;ve heard since the result was declared final,&#8221; wrote another [reader], who went on to lament how Jesse Jackson wept openly, Condoleezza Rice &#8220;could barely contain herself&#8221; and a &#8220;usually composed Colin Powell was unabashedly happy that a black man was now our president.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another reader e-mailed Viewpoints on Saturday, apparently in sarcastic response to the Houston Chronicle&rsquo;s promotion of a special section on Obama&rsquo;s historic win: &#8220;Is it still possible to get reprints of the special Sunday section highlighting George Bush when he was elected in 2000 or 2004?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>A white loss</b></p>
<p>All these people can&rsquo;t be oblivious to the historic moment our country has just witnessed: A man who would have been sent to the back of the bus in the 1950s will soon be riding on Air Force One.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a classic argument,&#8221; says Eric McDaniel, a University of Texas assistant professor who specializes in racial and ethnic politics. &#8220;The victory of a black person is automatically seen as a loss for white people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead of a symbol of racial advancement, McDaniel says some whites may see themselves as losers in a zero-sum game.</p>
<p>They see blacks as part of a special group looking out for their own, rather than members of the regular ol&rsquo; mainstream.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also the general discomfort among many white Americans with any and all reference to race or ethnicity. We have the luxury of being fatigued by the subject. It&rsquo;s not something we like to talk about because, usually, we don&rsquo;t have to. We&rsquo;re rarely the only white people in the room, or the restaurant or the class.</p>
<p><b>Biracial battle</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the end, Obama&rsquo;s win is a victory for equality in this country.</p>
<p>{snip}<br>

<p>This guy must be brain dead if he thought it wasn&rsquo;t about race.</p>
<p>ANY Democrat would have received 90% plus of the black vote in the general election.  But Obama got 70%-80% in the primaries against one of the most liberal Democrats in the known universe.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought this election was not about race&hellip;&#8221;  Yeah, sure.</p>

<p><br>
That&rsquo;s because blacks are, for the most part, criminally oriented, violent and racist in the extreme.  If blacks were just like everyone else, just with different colored skin, then an Obama victory would be no big deal even if he was primarily out for his own.  The problem is, none of that is true.  And most every black leader in the history of the world has been evil, corrupt, genocidal and near psychotic in his foolishness.  Whites KNOW what blacks are like and we have good reason to expect foul deeds from Obama.  That so many white people voted for him is a very bad thing indeed.  The problem is not ignorance&hellip;..it&rsquo;s something much worse.  Whites may have lost the desire to impose justice, fairness and even sanity onto the world.  And that is a huge problem&hellip;..for nearly a thousand years, that has been exactly our function.  If we can no longer do that, civilization itself is threatened.</p>

<p>- And this is the infantile illogical view that blacks are pathologically prone to. This is the reason that they have been declared the &#8216;eternal children&rsquo; of the world by many premier anthropologists as well as geneticists. They cannot see beyond what &#8216;looks like something.&rsquo; They are drawn to, and snatch at, something shiny or glittery. This is the same reason a black child will consistently choose one piece of candy today, in place of waiting a day and having one hundred pieces candy tomorrow. Thus is the &#8216;dullness&rsquo; displayed in their eyes which never see beyond what is physically &#8216;there&rsquo;. <br>

<p>Many never think to examine the FBI&rsquo;s Uniform Crime Index or the CDC&rsquo;s HIV, AIDS, and STD rates before mindlessly commenting. No amount of propaganda will ever change the truth. Virtually every metric in existence verifies that the presence of Blacks greatly harms civilized societies. Hispanics are only marginally better. </p>
<p>Outcomes are based on behavior. Behavior is based on intelligence. Those are the facts. Pretending and living in a state of denial does not change the facts.</p>

			<p>Prof. McDaniel, a victory for a black is a loss for whites. Race is a zero sum game, like murder and rape. I trust you are familiar with the interracial crime statistics since the loss of Jim Crow legal protections for whites.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because that&rsquo;s exactly what it is.  </p>
<p>Some analogies:</p>
<p>You and a co-worker are both in the running for the same promotion.  Your co-worker gets the promotion.  Is this a victory for you?</p>
<p>You lose your home to foreclosure.  A new owner is now living in your former home.  Is this a victory for you?</p>
<p>Your team loses the big game.  Is the rival team&rsquo;s victory also a victory for you?</p>

			<p>The news footage of elated blacks cheering and screaming in celebration on election night looked disturbingly similar to their reaction to OJ Simpson&rsquo;s acquittal in &#8216;95. </p>

<p>Well Comrade Falkenberg, that would be because they are (or maybe now were) only slightly less naive than yourself about the subject of race. Up until now they have never had the cold and hard experience of dealing with what &#8220;victorious&#8221; blacks are really like and they have short memories. They need only look back to The Juice&rsquo;s acquittal for murder, to see that any &#8220;gains&#8221; against whitey, are something to celebrate in the most base and obnoxious of manners. </p>
<p>Moreover, blacks are for the most part ignorant, or outright stupid, when it comes to politics; in what passes for most of their &#8220;brains,&#8221; they probably do think all their Christmases have come at once and they do run the country now. Or at least, that they will be elevated not to &#8220;equality&#8221; with whitey, but to superiority over him. They have no concept of how the powers are separated constitutionally, or that Comrade BO isn&rsquo;t the &#8220;all powerful&#8221; chief of the country, and by extension they themselves (as part of his &#8220;tribe&#8221;) open to looting the spoils.</p>
<p>In many respects, I have been just sickened to the point of depression and despair with the results of this travesty called an election. I was convinced, that a significant majority of whites would put that old fool McCain into the White House, for better or worse. However, right now I am wondering if those who had openly stated that having this mulatto charlatan win this thing, might not be the best possible outcome that could have happened to this country for a white racial awakening?</p>
<p>Certainly we are in for a rough four years, but so is the &#8220;savior&#8221; Comrade BO. Might not his certain failure in the face of all the heightened expectations of both white and nonwhite fools alike, be the much needed bitter pill this country needs?</p>
<p>This simpering fool Comrade Falkenberg observers that:  </p>
<p>&#8220;In the end, Obama&rsquo;s win is a victory for equality in this country.&#8221; </p>
<p>But might that only be for the moment, and in the long run and the true end, it will be a victory for race realism?</p>
<p>God let it be so!</p>

			<p>Bottom line: They need us.  We don&rsquo;t need them.</p>
<p>We never needed them for anything besides picking cotton, &amp; that only briefly. Without blacks, this country would be a fine place; without whites, it would (or rather, will) resemble other 3rd world countries.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need Obamanation.  He&rsquo;s our first affirmative-action president.  A white guy with his credentials would not have been nominated, much less elected; that&rsquo;s the very definition of affirmative action.    </p>

<p>My, awfully high and mighty sentiments of brave conviction, &#8216;minorities&rsquo; have a need to talk about race&hellip; Perhaps the white Lisa Falkenberg wants to visit the Detroit public schools and talk race? Or just about any big-city public school. Ms Falkenberg&rsquo;s, well-disseminated, attitude here is probably some kind of slur to whites. I wonder what &#8216;Resisting Defamation&rsquo; would have to say about it? </p>

<p>The best way to deal with &#8220;arguments&#8221; like this is to simply turn them around. If whites are running a majority-black nation in Africa, we are told it&rsquo;s sinful. Yet, if blacks are not running a majority-white nation, that&rsquo;s also sinful. This is the big double-standard that pervades every discussion about race in this country. Whites were running a country in Africa, the most successful in the region, and they were pressured into giving up power. Now it&rsquo;s rapidly declinging. (Just a coincidence, I&rsquo;m sure.) Of course, effective counter arguments would never make it into that article. </p>

<p>I wonder what they&rsquo;d say if some kind of poor person was elected president? A working class, Joe. A guy, say, right of Attila the Hun. I wonder if they would say this was a great victory for equality? Was Obama a great victory for equality? or a great victory for Maoists like those at the Houston Chronicle&hellip;</p>

			<p>I find it fascinating that everyone believes that Obama will unify this country and make it more united than ever before.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, their premise is flawed.  America used to be a relatively united country and was at its most united when it was 90% white and 10% black back in 1960.  It will never again be as united in language, culture and purpose as it was then because it is now a tangle of squabbling nationalities, worsening every day.</p>
<p>Not even Obamessiah can change that.</p>

			<p>&#8220;For one reader, though, it was enough to prompt a disapproving letter to the paper suggesting we might all just as well wear &#8220;My president is white&#8221; shirts for the rest of George W. Bush&rsquo;s tenure. That would be fitting, if, just before the word &#8220;white,&#8221; you add the phrase &#8220;always has been.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;d write a column in rosy approval of that. White students running around in T-shirts saying &#8220;my president has always been white&#8221;. Does this lady even bother to think about what she is saying?<br>

<p>Well, of course you idiot! Why would sensible White people see a Black leader as a symbol of racial advancement - other than for Blacks alone? Why is it only Whites who allegedly must always cheer and champion the advancement of other races, while they effectively ignore their own? </p>
<p>Like the one reader refernced in the article stated, the post election coverage of the Obama victory has been positively saturated in racial rhetoric and jibber-jabber. That many White Americans still cannot see that this was ALL ABOUT race from the very start, shows just how racially neutered most Whites are. </p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t have a problem with blacks being proud of Obama.  How can I complain or attack their solidarity when I preach I want my own to do the same?  But the one thing I never hear from blacks which they more than owe us is thank you.  Thank you for making the sacrifices that allow us to rise.</p>
<p>The one positive thing I have noticed with Obama&rsquo;s win is that many of the blacks I encountered seem to be just a little bit less hostile these days.<br>

<p>Sure, sure&hellip; just like in the old Soviet Union where some are more equal than others.  A real victory for equality would be the abolition of all affirmative action policies.</p>

			<p>There is absolutely nothing wrong with Blacks taking pride in Obama&rsquo;s Victory. In fact, any Black person who doesn&rsquo;t see this as a major victory for their race is an idiot. It&rsquo;s Whites who have no buisness taking pride in Obama&rsquo;s Victory, because any White person who sees this as anything other than a loss for us is an idiot. The one thing I remember most about election night was seeing Jesse Jackson crying after Obama was announced the winner. I know this may sound contradictory at first, but as a White Nationalist, Jackson&rsquo;s tears were very moving. All of the Blacks I saw crying moved me. I can definitely understand where they&rsquo;re coming from. Their race just won a significant victory. The people I don&rsquo;t understand are the Whites who were screaming with excitement. This was a major milestone for Blacks. The only scenario I can think of that would ilicit the same feelings out of all of us would be if Whites finally woke up and took this country back. Imgaine the emotions you would experience if you were standing in a park in Philadelphia (I use that city because it was where the Declearation of Independence was signed) listening to a proud White Leader declare that our struggle for an Independent White Nation was finally over, and that our country was ours again. I imagine a lot of us from this site and elsewhere would be crying with joy. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve started to realize that other races are not the primary source of America&rsquo;s racial problems per say. Our problem stems from Stupid Whites. Blacks and Hispanics are only doing what is supposed to be in every living creatures nature. They are struggling for power. They are trying to advance themselves. Why should Blacks or Hispanics care about our heritage, what good is White History to them? As this site points out, culture is a reflection of the people who created it. America doesn&rsquo;t work for Blacks and Hispanics because it wasn&rsquo;t designed with them in mind. It&rsquo;s perfectly natural for them to want to change their environment into something that suits their needs and desires. We&rsquo;re the idiots who allow them to do it. </p>
<p>Blacks didn&rsquo;t come here voluntarily, they were forced here. Blacks never ended slavery, because they didn&rsquo;t have the power to. Whites ended slavery. Blacks never could have ended segregation, Whites had to champion the cause. Obama never could have won the preidency without Whites voting for him. Hispanics stream across our border looking for opportunity, no different than when our ancestors did the exact same thing to the Native Americans. It is our fault for allowing them to do it. </p>
<p>The bottom line is this&hellip; Life is a constant struggle for survival. No living thing has a guaranteed right to existence. WE CANNOT EXPECT OTHERS TO RESPECT OUR SOVREIGNTY IF WE AREN&rsquo;T WILLING TO DEFEND IT!!!</p>

			<p>What does Barack Obama have to do with &#8220;African Americans&#8221; as defined by Jesse Jackson and his crowd? And why do they have so much misplaced pride in him?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one generation from Kenya in West Africa, a place that had nothing to do with the origin of most blacks in America. &#8220;African Americans&#8221; in Jesse&rsquo;s sense are descendants of West Africans from the slave trade.</p>
<p>His mother was white, his white grandparents raised him, and he was educated in white schools to act like a white person&hellip; all of which might have something to do with his apparent intelligence and undeniable success.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s about as black as my sister after a good tanning session, and has more in common with me than with the average ghetto-dwelling feral human. I just don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>BTW, ever notice that every&hellip; EVERY attractive &#8220;black&#8221; woman or accomplished &#8220;black&#8221; male is half white?</p>

 &hellip;Let&rsquo;s see&hellip;For the first time in American History,both black and white;this country will have it&rsquo;s first Black American as Commander and Chief. It doesn&rsquo;t give us more power but more likely some one we can be proud of.Yes we know he&rsquo;s of mixed race but&hellip;who cares? He reminds us of us and our skin tone.<br>
 I just finished reading and article from July revolving around reparations and I,like Mr.Obama,himself feels that would be the worst thing that could ever happen to blacks.<br>
 He allows myself and other blacks to feel accountable and make no excuses for hardships in life. Everybody has hardships in life,it&rsquo;s just a matter of how you handle them.<br>
 Now that a biracial man,a &#8220;Black Man&#8221; will take office in the nation&rsquo;s capital in 2009; America both black and white,need to get over the hate.<br>
 The day after the elections, my 15/16 yr.old sons came home from school saying that the friends they&rsquo;ve had since kindergarten said things they thought were racist.Hate is not something that    you&rsquo;re born with; it&rsquo;s taught and we all need to stop teaching it.It&rsquo;s America&hellip;not White America&hellip;not Black America but plainly said&hellip;America. I&rsquo;m not going to say that a &#8220;Black&#8221; President is going to fix all of America&rsquo;s problem but can he do any worst then the 43 &#8220;White&#8221; presidents before him? Lets step back and give him a shot&hellip;if we like what he done after 4 years,then he&rsquo;ll get another shot&hellip;if not, then we, as Americans will vote him out. </p>

<p>Excuse me! Does this mean that a McCain win would be a victory for inequality??? I did not realize that only a black candidate could represent equality in this country. (Should we tell the US Supreme Court?)</p>
<p>Let me make this clear&hellip;.the election of a mulatto from Hawaii (or Chicago) does not imply any advancement of equality. Neither candidate ran on a platform of inequality. And all such pretentions to the contrary are offensive and divisive&hellip;.a good way to start a long four years.<br>

<p>I really don&rsquo;t fully get the &#8220;pride&#8221; part.  I understand they&rsquo;re happy that a black man is President but that is where the kinship ends.  He is not an African-American the same way they are, he is half-white, he was raised by whites, he hasn&rsquo;t accomplished much other than manipulating the masses in his favor (hey white guys do it all the time), and he isn&rsquo;t the best they have to offer.  The pride part is misfocused and the Obama presidency may very well turn into an embarrassment or worse&hellip; shame.  He is untested and it appears that that change they&rsquo;ve been looking for is an intricate and undergroud part of &#8220;the Man and his machine.&#8221;<br>

			<p>Of the dozens of people I have talked to who were opposed to Obama, none of whom have any reason to hide from me the true reason for their opposition, only ONE has said it was solely because he is black. Just one. All the rest were opposed because of his socialist policies. And yet, nearly every single media article about the election either implies or directly states that those opposed to Obama base their views on his race, and thus those unhappy with the outcome of the election must be bigots. There has been NO recognition that MOST of the opposition to Obama is based on his policies. Since the media, while ignorant of many things, is not THAT stupid, there must be another reason for this situation. And it&rsquo;s the same reason for the media blackout of Ron Paul&rsquo;s campaign  &mdash;  the media has been completely captured by the worldwide socialist movement. If there was ever any doubt at all of this proposition, there should be none now. </p>

<p>Good evening, good job of white-bashing in your article, &#8220;Some see pride in Obama&rsquo;s win as wrong&#8221; on the 10th.  Of course, with Senator Obama&rsquo;s victory, it&rsquo;s going to be much harder to instill guilt and self-loathing in the diverse white American peoples.</p>
<p>However, how often have you mentioned Obama&rsquo;s use of hate speech like his remark in 2004 that acting white was a scandal? Or how often have you explored the really nasty racism underlying his use of the term, &#8220;a typical white person.&#8221; He certainly lacks sensitivity, and I am sure you will want to challenge him on his left-wing racialism.</p>

			<p>People continually talk about Obama as if he can relate to the black struggles across mainland USA. It&rsquo;s not a historic event that someone of his skin color could be elected President. (My skin gets that dark in the summer- elect me.) It&rsquo;s a historic event of great shame that one, possibly not even born in the U.S., and one possible enemy of what this nation is all about became President. <br>

			<p>Now that Barack Obama is going to be the next President, I still hope the Obama Adminstration can get our economy up and running again, and successfully work at solving our country&rsquo;s other major problems.</p>
<p>Personally, I wanted Ron Paul to become our next President, but his bid was doomed to fail from the start, because his Libertarian views are too radical for most of America.</p>
<p>If the Obama Presidency becomes a failure like that of George W. Bush, it will a real disaster for America.  Blacks and liberal whites who voted for him, and were once his gung-ho supporters, could become disillusioned and take to rioting in the streets of major cities across America.</p>
<p>To everyone reading this post, would you want to be the President of the United States?</p>
<p>I would not want to be President, because our nation&rsquo;s troubled economy, global warming, terrorism, the war in Iraq, our freedom&rsquo;s being taken away because of 9-11, illegal immigration, and major problems our country is facing would be my responsibility to solve.  In fact, I would not want to serve in any public office, because I would have to lie by making promises I could not keep, in order to get elected!</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t believe it, cruise around the internet, especially Youtube.  Look for comments like &#8220;and then she told me I couldn&rsquo;t deny her insurance claim because she was black and so was the President!&#8221; or &#8220;as I cuffed him, he said &#8216;it wasn&rsquo;t going to be like this no more when Obama&rsquo;s President&rsquo;&#8221; </p>
<p>A disturbingly large portion of blacks think Obama&rsquo;s election was a victory over whites, and that they now have increased power as a racial group.  They think there is some basket of goodies and special rights that gets passed to the race in the White House!  We are in for a very rough year&hellip;</p>

<p>Power, unlike economics, is a zero-sum game.  If one group gains in power, another can only lose.  Blacks gain power, Whites lose power.  There is absolutely no way this is not automatically a loss for White people.  Obama has achieved nothing in his life that was not because of his race.  He, nor any of his ancestors was ever discriminated against.  His mother was a White leftist race-traitor, his father a Kenyan who was only in this country because of a special program that let Africans in to study.  Obama got all his education because of his race - there is no way he got into Columbia and Harvard on his own (his high school grades were mediocre, and no one has released his SAT and LSAT scores).  This special treatment all his life has the effect of making Obama more, not less, hostile to Whites.  Why in God&rsquo;s name did this product of absolute privilege study Malcolm X and other anti-White authors, and become enraged at White behavior?  Why did he join a radical Black church and marry a radical Black woman?</p>

<p>This Obama dude is merely a continuation of that politically engineered trend.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I can&rsquo;t see Asiatics in general putting up with the constant Marxist inspired media and education depiction of blacks as the only hard-done-by race in the world deserving of special/preferential treatment as though blacks have some sort of exclusive inalienable and unquestionable right to social elevation in countries they don&rsquo;t even originate from.</p>
<p>The various Asiatic races will progressively take over America stage by stage, making sure they secure power for their own individual races by any means necessary.  </p>
<p>Productive whites will have largely relocated back to their ancestral lands and those where they still dominate for the moment.  The non-productive whites and blacks will very likely find themselves once again, the surfs (slaves) of a new elite presently in the ascendancy - a multi-Asiatic elite. <br>

			<p>It isn&rsquo;t a zero-sum game, nor is it perceived as such. A victory for an Afric is not a loss for a Europic. It&rsquo;s just that AFFIRMATIVE BLACKTION gives these Africs jobs, positions, and relationships that they do not DESERVE to have, but that they get only because Leftism - equality worship - has brainwashed Europic men into giving it to them. </p>

<p>It is, considering whites are the only group that have to be &#8220;diverse&#8221;, considering blacks expect us to include them in OUR things, yet they discriminate against us.  It&rsquo;s hypocrisy.  That&rsquo;s what bothers us whites more than anything.  There is a place called Africa where blacks can have leaders that look like them.  </p>

<p>If you ever needed proof positive that race exist and is very important, there it is. Having someone that looks like you in charge is reason to celebrate. </p>
<p>Obama isn&rsquo;t even half black but he does look black so that&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s important. Heck, Bill Clinton acted like a black man but he didn&rsquo;t look very black. So what she is saying is that if George Bush or Bill Clinton had a really dark tan they would have been totally acceptable. What a nut case. </p>
<p>George Bush may look like me but I didn&rsquo;t celebrate when he was elected. When I herd him say that he had learned a lot from the Clintons I knew the country was in trouble. </p>

Some of Barack Obama&rsquo;s Cabinet will be white.  Also, we&rsquo;re still over 60% of the population, and we have the most money (I&rsquo;m hoping).  So we&rsquo;re still in the game.<br>

			<p>Not to make an inappropriate pun about miscegenation and its effects on the black establishment: just remember that the &#8220;cream&#8221; (chocolat au lait)rises to the top.  Throughout the world (with the exception of subsaharian Africa) the leaders of advanced third world countries where large black populations are a demographic force are either mulatto (or hybrid, to use the term that is now anthropologically accepted) or &#8220;almost white.&#8221;   Note that even in Mexico the upper crust is predominantly European in descent.

<p>Excellent post, but I disagree with you on the above quote.  Wait until a year goes by and blacks (and more, importantly, the rest of the country) see that having a black president does nothing to change the crime-focused, welfare-reliant, uneducated, and generally immobile black population.  It will be quite elucidating, I think.  Jared Taylor brilliantly touched on this in his essay on why Obama will win.</p>

<p>However, I don&rsquo;t think blacks will abandon Barry Obama when he doesn&rsquo;t come through for them.  When he fails to bring about their utopia of free gas and free houses, they&rsquo;ll find some way to blame whites. They&rsquo;ll say &#8220;we&#8221; put the token black in office but without any power to bring about real change. That despite being the leader of the free world, racism in America is still strong and prevented him from fulfilling all those promises he made. </p>

<p>I would like to buttress your points by noting that whoever this hive collective &#8220;we&#8221; is, I am most certain that they (it) did not and do not, support or respect President Bush by any stretching of those two words. Quite the contrary, they (it) have probably spent the last 8 years calling for his impeachment or demanding that he be assassinated. While this is in direct conflict with their (its) own newly adopted standards of decorum, in which we (race realists, Republicans, those with IQs above 75, etc.) must graciously support a Red mulatto buffoon as president, they (it) have most likely repeatedly described the Bush presidency as being both illegitimate and criminal. </p>
<p>Funny how the concept of hypocrisy always escapes these Red idiots, once they have gotten what they wanted.</p>
<p>All the best to you Cassiodorus,</p>
<p>John PM! <br>
