<h1>Richmond Police Officer Resigns Over Ku Klux Klan Costume-Party Photos</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Karl Fischer, West County Times (Richmond, Calif.), Nov. 5</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Richmond police officer resigned Wednesday after the department received photos of him posing at a Halloween costume party with someone dressed as a Ku Klux Klan member.</p>
<p>A reader forwarded two photos to the Times in an e-mail Tuesday morning, both apparently depicting costume-clad people at a Halloween party. A man identified by multiple sources as Richmond police Officer Ben Murdoch appears in both photos, dressed as a rock star.</p>
<p>Another, unidentified man also appears in the photos, dressed in the white sheet and conical white hat of the Ku Klux Klan. In both photos, those depicted are raising their hands in an apparent mock-Nazi salute.</p>
<p>Police Chief Chris Magnus said he could not comment, other than to confirm that he placed Murdoch on paid leave Tuesday afternoon, when he learned of the pictures, and that Murdoch and the city parted ways Wednesday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sorry enough, Rains added, that he resigned his job during an internal-affairs interview Wednesday morning. Rains said Murdoch and his roommates had a Halloween costume party Saturday night. His friend who wore the KKK costume, a Latino, evoked roars of laughter from the tight-knit group because he is an outspoken liberal and opponent of racism, Rains said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Racial tension and mistrust mark the length of the Richmond Police Department&rsquo;s modern history. City police received national attention during the 1980s for civil rights lawsuits over the police shootings of two black men that resulted in an epic financial settlement and mandated safeguards against racism and civil rights abuses, including the formation of the Richmond Police Commission.</p>
<p>In 2006, several members of the department&rsquo;s command staff, all black, sued the city with accusations of racist treatment at the hands of Magnus and former Deputy Chief Lori Ritter. Both have denied the claims, and one of the plaintiffs dropped out of the suit this year. The case remains unresolved in Contra Costa Superior Court.<br/>

			<p>This kind of thing happens all the time.  When I worked for the county, I was accused of racism several times a year by black co-workers whose sexual advances I had rejected.</p>
<p>When it comes to a white woman being agressively harassed by black men the feminazis have nothing to say.</p>
<p>Every notice that the sex harassement brainwashing videos always show evil white men harassing the women.  Nary a word about what race commits most of the rapes and harassement in this country.</p>
<p>When will whites start our own ADL, NOW or some sort of self defense organization?</p>

			<p>I think the most amazing part of this piece is the end bit about the black officers suing for discrimination.  I wonder if lawsuits such as these could develop into a trend?</p>

			<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, the guy was an idiot to think anyone of the darker race would let this one by without following up with a lawsuit and a funeral pyre.<br/>

			<p>It certainly offers up some good ideas on how to get your favorite &#8216;anti-racist&rsquo; fired. </p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s lucky they caught this guy and got him to quit his job, dressed up as a rock star at a costume party. <br/>
That&rsquo;s exactly how Hitler got started.<br/>
Only if someone back then spotted it and saw the signs like we can now&hellip;&hellip;phew!!</p>

Right before they lose their jobs and go to jail.</p>

			<p>&#8220;This kind of thing happens all the time. When I worked for the county, I was accused of racism several times a year by black co-workers whose sexual advances I had rejected.&#8221;</p>
<p>How arrogant they are. If you reject a White guy they have no card to play. Teaching in a public high school I see it everyday. Many White boys for some reason have no confidence when it comes to approaching a girl to whom they&rsquo;re attracted. I suppose it&rsquo;s due to fear of rejection but Blacks no matter how unattractive they are, have no problem approaching the most attractive White girls and making their pitch.<br/>
I was in a formal wear rental shop one afternoon and saw this really lovely young White girl ( a Reece/ Reese? Witherspoon type) take out a check book and pay the tuxedo rental for her Prom date, a disreputable looking Black with filthy looking dreads and tatoos on his neck. They then drove off in her BMW convertible. I could see the scenario down the road with her winding up pregnant and alone.<br/>
I can see the anger seething inside so many White adolescent boys. We&rsquo;ll be dealing with that someday as well.</p>
