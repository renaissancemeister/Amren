			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>India Times, Nov. 5, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Barack Obama&rsquo;s historic win in the presidential election opens the gates for Indian American politicians like Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal to enter the White House in future, the Indian community in the United States said as they congratulated Obama. </p>
<p>Sending congratulatory messages to the president-elect, Indian American organisations and community leaders hoped that the Obama Administration in the White House would herald a new era of relationship between India and the US. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The last few years under the Bush administration has seen the ties between US and India grow ever stronger and that culminated in reaching the historic Civil Nuclear Agreement between these two nations. Indian national Overseas Congress (INOC) expects to see the relationship further strengthened under an Obama administration to new heights,&rdquo; said George Abraham, INOC general secretary. </p>
<p>Congratulatory messages came from the Indian American Republican leadership too. Ashok Mago from Texas, home State of the outgoing US President, George Bush, said Obama&rsquo;s success will be an inspiration for everyone. &ldquo;It will energise people and send a strong message to the nation. No more excuses, opportunities are waiting for you. Compete and be whatever you want to be because of your talent and not because of your race, ethnicity, religion or nationality,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Obama&rsquo;s victory provides tremendous encouragement to Indian Americans like Bobby Jindal and others who wish to be in his shoes someday. Indian Americans should be proud of their role not only in the presidential but other elections as well. We are coming of age,&rdquo; Mago said. </p>
<p>Congratulating Obama on his victory, the Federation of Indian American Christian Organizations of North America (FIACONA) said his election represents a new hope Americans at home and respect for America abroad. </p>
<p>&ldquo;FIACONA appreciates the special love and concern that Obama has for India and Indians. This will usher in new and improved relations with India,&rdquo; said Bernard Malik, FIACONA president. </p>
<p>The Indian American community in California who had gathered at an election-night event organised by the Friends of the South Asian American Communities erupted into immediate cheer as the news was splashed on television screens by cable news networks projecting Obama as winner of the presidential elections. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We never expected this to happen in our life time. This is a reality now,&rdquo; Upendra Chivukula of the New Jersey assembly, said. Chivukula is the first Asian-American legislator in the assembly. The Indian American community leaders in New Jersey participated in a victory celebration in New Brunswick, which among others was attended by Governor Jon Corzine. </p>
<p>For someone like Nick Tekwani, a software professional running his own business in New York, this election has been a special one as he voted for the first time. He turned 25 Tuesday and voted for Obama. &ldquo;This is a historic occasion indeed,&rdquo; he said.<br>

		<p>A naive leap of logic.</p>
<p>Blacks characteristically want to be front and center, putting on the biggest display of their prowess, claiming the spotlight.</p>
<p>Mo matter that black pop stars stand before an army of white technicians, songwriters, producers and arrangers. No matter that black celebrity athletes are only temporary stars before an industry dominated by white organization.  All that matters is the desire to momentarily be the &#8216;Number One&rsquo; dog.</p>
<p>Obama is a soothing baritone singer, the lesser of two poor choices for office, an empty suit, a &#8216;winner&rsquo; as the result of decades of black attention-seeking, a caricature of a manufactured celebrity.</p>
<p>Indians don&rsquo;t have a chance of imitating that.</p>

		<p>As a citizen of Louisiana Jindal is my governor. He has done a fantastic job cleaning up the mess Kathleen Blanco left. Blanco was horrible and deserved all the blame for the Katrina problems leveled at Bush. The country threw way too much money at Louisiana and Blanco wasted it on pet projects. Jindal is a fiscal and social conservative and would be a great president. He is very popular here. I expect him to be a candidate in 2012. Of course, after seeing what the media did to Palin who knows if he will run.</p>

		<p>The USA is only 1% Indian (though 4% Asian) per this article from the India Times that debunks the commonly held myth among Indians that &#8220;38 per cent of doctors in US are Indians, as are 36 per cent of NASA scientists and 34 per cent of Microsoft employees&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Indians_in_NASA_Govt_falls_for_net_hoax/articleshow/2856295.cms" rel="nofollow">http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Indians_in_NASA_Govt_falls_for_net_hoax/articleshow/2856295.cms</a></p>
<p>13% is the percentage of blacks in the USA. </p>
<p>Unlike Obama, any so called &#8220;INDIAN-American&#8221; presidential candidate would not start the campaign with 13% of the US population already in his corner.</p>
<p>Thus, the Obama formula would NOT work for a so called &#8220;INDIAN-American&#8221; candidate any time soon.</p>

		<p>As usual these people put their &#8220;ethnicity&#8221; ahead of their &#8220;Americanness&#8221;. These people consider themselves Indians first, Hindus second and Americans maybe third, if at all. Yet, all these ethnic groups want &#8220;power&#8221; in America. This country is going to be an absolute mess in the years to come especially with useful idiot whites helping with the suicide of their own race.</p>

		<p>I think I mentioned on another thread that this is what will be the future for America. White America is dead. The Republicans will now have to have a nonwhite in the next election to prove they aren&rsquo;t racist. The pandora&rsquo;s box has been opened for ALL minorities to be next in line. No more White men to be elected. You know how wishy washy and weak the republicans have become and are so afraid of offending anyone, let alone a person of color. The PC brainwashing has affected the republicans as much as the democrats.  So the pandering will begin and the reaching across the aisle by the republicans.</p>

		<p>The Republicans constantly gripe and moan in frustration at how they&rsquo;re losing so much of the White vote in the USA  &mdash;   and they wonder why?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because even the Republicans are indulging in political correctness and affirmative action, rejecting the Whites who built this country up and once provided a solid base for the GOP.  Yet now, the Republicans have turned their backs on the dwindling White civilization in the United States, with this backing of Bobby Jindal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read up on Jindal and listened to him speak.  While I don&rsquo;t have strong feelings one way or the other about him, it&rsquo;s obvious that for one thing, he&rsquo;s not presidential timber (he&rsquo;s basically an idiot who mouths social conservative platitudes) and second, the Republicans are obviously doing it as a full-out capitulation to political correctness. </p>
<p>The GOP leaders and fools like Limbaugh and Hannity (whom I will never, ever listen to again) are trying to delude themselves into thinking that selecting Jindal would help to &#8220;rebrand&#8221; the GOP to help it appeal to minorities.  Instead, the Republicans are getting the worst of both worlds since 1. they&rsquo;ll never get the minority vote in the USA (which votes Democratic due to welfare goodies and socialism as well as racial solidarity) and 2. the Republicans are also bitterly alienating the White vote by supporting Jindal, turning away their own base!  One of my friends heard Limbaugh shilling for Jindal, at which point he angrily tore up his Republican registration card, never to support the party again.</p>
<p>The Republicans are called &#8220;the stupid party&#8221; with good reason, since their support for illegal alien amnesty and now, for Bobby Jindal, is dooming them into irrelevance.  And frankly, I couldn&rsquo;t care less.  If the GOP continues to push Jindal like this, they&rsquo;ll destroy themselves as a viable party.  And frankly, it&rsquo;ll be good riddance to a foolish political organization incapable of acting in its own self-interest.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve heard nothing but good things about Bobby Jindal.  Whether we like it or not, there is a possibly that we will be choosing between Obama and Jindal in 2012.  And if it boils down to these two, give me a conservative Jindal over a socialist Obama any day.  I will not throw away my vote selecting a relatively unknown 3rd party candidate when by doing so I assist a socialist gain 4 more years as POTUS.  <br>
Lets look at what the Republican party has put forth lately. Bob Dole? Jorge Bush? Juan McCain? They were all panderers to an anti-White agenda.  If not Bobby Jindal, who? Sarah Palin? We will first have to see who survives the Republican primaries, but should it be Bobby Jindal, then he gets my vote over Barack Obama, because I think Jindal would take into account the interests of Whites before the Mulatto in Chief.  And I think he would also be more likely to take into account the interests of Whites than any of the previously mentioned White candidates had done besides Sarah Palin.</p>

		<p>Jindal is so extreme Right beholden to rigid religiosity he makes Sarah Palin look reasonable.   He hails from the zealots who want to completely outlaw abortion, much like Alan Keyes.  If he were to run for national office he would fare pretty much the same as Keyes does.   Neither stands a chance of being elected president.</p>

		<p>It may be entirely true that Bobby Jindal is a brave, principled fellow, and a good guy too, but what comes after him?  The eight Black kids that were escorted into Little Rock High School by Federal troops in 1956 were smart kids, the pick of the Black high schools.  But they were the wedge that made it possible for masses of dull-witted, droopy pants Blacks to invade White schools.  So it will be with Jindal.  A flood of grasping Hindus will follow him as far as we allow him to go.  </p>

<p>Something like this disgusts me more than any other aspect of this entire sordid affair.</p>
<p>Nothing ever prevented a black from becoming president besides his inability and lack of intelligence, the exact same qualities that prevent them from becoming professional people.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s not even necessary, because their staffs are now so large the can get advice 24/7 on what to do or say on any matter.</p>
<p>Just look at Condoleeza Rice.  Or Bush.  Does anybody believe either of these mentally challenged types could cut it without a large staff of advisers?<br>

		<p>Guys, I&rsquo;m a big supporter of this movement, and occasionally visit this website (and will in fact probably be doing so more now, for fairly obvious reasons), but I really think a lot of you are way off on this one, and I just can&rsquo;t keep silent.  Jindal is, from everything I&rsquo;ve learned about him, as true a conservative as we&rsquo;ve had in a long time.  Yes, he happens to be Indian American, but remember that he leads a state with what I would have to think is a nonexistent Indian population, so it&rsquo;s not as if he was elected by Indians and is spending his time pandering to Indians.  He also has a terrific record on immigration.  And he&rsquo;s by all accounts brilliant, going to Brown undergraduate, getting admitted to both Yale Law School and Harvard Medical School, and then going to Oxford as a Rhodes scholar.  And I&rsquo;m sorry if pointing this out sounds elitist, and I don&rsquo;t personally care about such things, but the fact is that this does give him credibility with those who do, and there are many of them.   I don&rsquo;t know what else to say.  If you can&rsquo;t be happy with Bobby Jindal, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re ever going to find what you&rsquo;re looking for.  </p>

		<p>Honestly?</p>
<p>I hear many of you praise &#8220;conservative&#8221; principles&hellip;(i.e Jindal)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to hear your definition of &#8216;conservative&rsquo; because I bet its a far cry from the days of William F. Buckley and Barry Goldwater.</p>
<p>Frankly, I see no bright future ahead.  I honestly believed that a larger majority of Whites would get into the booths and not vote Obama.  I was obviously very wrong.</p>
<p>We can safely assume that 30%+ of Whites will always vote for either the most liberal candidate, or the non-white male candidate simply because they are lost causes.  This trend will become precipitously worse with each generation.</p>
<p>Likewise the demographic situation in this country will constantly be on the up for most &#8220;minorities.&#8221;  Frankly I am alarmed by the fact that Asians and &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; voted in such large numbers for a Black candidate.  They will only begin voting against one another when Whites eventually become a politically marginalized minority.  For now its gang up on whitey.</p>
<p>We will always economically control this country, even though that too will become more difficult because who knows what kind of tax schemes and other such economically crippling statutes will be enacted&hellip;</p>
<p>Virginia, the birthplace of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Robert E. Lee even sold you out! (atleast a majority did)</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, remember November 5, 2008, the day that conservative Whites lost political control of the most powerful country they ever built.  </p>

		<p>9:38 p.m.: I&rsquo;m sorry, but you&rsquo;re missing the point here.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter how conservative Bobby Jindal is (or pretends to be, as it&rsquo;s increasingly appearing)  &mdash;   what does matter, is that the Republicans are succumbing to the same PC, affirmative-action, anti-White orthodoxy as the Democrats are.  This is precisely what is infuriating the more than 150 million Whites in this country so much, that we  &mdash;   the founding people of this nation, who poured so much blood and sweat into making this the world&rsquo;s most important country  &mdash;   are now seeing its leadership give away the nation that we worked so hard putting together, leaving a miserable future for us and our children here in north America.</p>
<p>This GOP lovefest for Jindal is only more confirmation that the Republican Party no longer stands for us, for our people, our history, heritage, and our basic rights and principles.  The Republicans want to sell us out as much as the Democrats do  &mdash;   they just use different talking points.</p>
<p>The more the Republicans talk up Jindal and others like him, the more that American Whites in the heartland will bitterly turn toward Third Parties and prepare for the likely partition of the United States in the coming two decades.  </p>
<p>Frankly, Chuck Baldwin&rsquo;s Constitution Party is looking better and better every day.  We could probably use the Constitution Party as the foundation for a strong and viable 3rd Party, focusing chiefly on the principles, needs and interests of American Whites, who are by far *the* most disenfranchised people in the USA today  &mdash;   a total travesty, considering our contributions to it.  </p>
<p>The more that the GOP offers this sycophantic affection to Jindal, the more American Whites in the heartland will sign up as active members, and heavily donate to, the Constitution Party (and probably the Libertarian Party to an extent).  If enough of us leave the Republicans as the GOP increasingly betrays us, we&rsquo;ll have enough of a war chest to turn the Constitution Party into a powerful organization with enough media attention to run candidates who can win offices.  If this means the eclipse of the Republican Party, then so be it.  The GOP will go the way of the Whigs if they continue to back Jindal and turn their backs on already hard-pressed White Americans like this.</p>

		<p>Right now it is a race in American politics for both parties to find a suitable well spoken brown skinned person to lead them. Laughable! This would be great.

		<p>I agree with RHG. If you think the Blacks are ethnocentric, try the Indo-Pakistanis. The Blacks at least have some history here; the Indians are here for what they can get out of the place. Believe me, they despise us! Republicans can anoint Bobby Jindal all they want; he&rsquo;ll never get my vote. He can call himself an American, and the Republicans can call him an American, but that doesn&rsquo;t make him an American in my eyes.<br>
And by the way, Indo-Pakistani social conservatism is quite different from American social conservatism. Americans wouldn&rsquo;t like it one bit!</p>

		<p>&#8220;Jindal is a fiscal and social conservative and would be a great president.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As a white southerner, I will honestly say that Bobby Jindal is a good man that has served Louisiana well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is special about him is that he is one of the few Republicans around today with the courage to stand strong on conservative principles.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Jindal, as far as I can tell, has governed honestly in a state (Louisiana) that is notorious for being crooked.  I have family members (all Republican conservatives) in Louisiana, and they all like him, especially in comparison to the incompetent and crooked Blanco.  I don&rsquo;t think that the Republican party should pander to minorities, but I think Jindal would be a decent choice, perhaps as VP (he is young).  Minority Republicans should not be excluded from the Presidential race just because people are angry about Colin Powell, etc.  </p>
<p>The main thing that the Republicans need to do is to fire everyone who had anything to do with boosterism for McCain the Maverick.  McCain was in favor of Shamnesty and promised to spend a fortune on &#8220;global warming,&#8221; not to mention continuing the two wars we are now in for the foreseeable future.  His bipartisanship fetish and Hispandering would have ended up costing the USA more per year than Bush, Jr., did.  McCain is a self-loathing white who wants to redeem himself by screwing his own people.  Jindal would be a big step up, as he has governed along the lines of his campaign promises.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that Jindal is a Hindu.  I&rsquo;m pretty sure he is a practicing Roman Catholic.</p>

		<p>Great. So the GOP, once again, will conform to the politically correct, anti-White rules established by the left: &#8220;See, we&rsquo;re not racist! We recognize the nations non-White future! So here&rsquo;s our own slick non-White. Please love us!&#8221;</p>

		<p>Several responses to this thread only prove what I just noted on another post. I always thought RACE was issue number ONE for AR. Whether one is a &#8220;good conservative&#8221; is a political/values argument that is another matter entirely. So what Jindal is supposedly a conservative - he is NON-WHITE is he not?! We need to stop thinking &#8220;Pat Buchanan&#8221; and start thinking &#8220;Jared Taylor&#8221; around here. I&rsquo;m not sure some here get the distinction.  </p>

<p>Short and sweet&hellip; Because if Obama STUPIDLY opens the floodgates to lots of African (or Hispanic or other) immigration, there will be a monstrous backlash, starting as early as 2010.

		<p>An Indian as president?  Sure!  Why not?  All they need to do is import another 40,000,000 Indians into the U.S. and they will vote for him.  With the exception of far Eastern females, non-whites are loyal to their ethnic groups and will vote accordingly.  For whites to do so, however, would be considered &#8220;racist&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Jindal is a convert to Christianity, which makes him sort of a race traitor to Hindu Indians and shows that he&rsquo;s assimilating/ed to American culture.

		<p>Bobby Jindal will be nothing more than an affirmative action hire   &mdash;   &#8220;our Obama,&#8221; as it were.  Republicans don&rsquo;t understand that to out-do the Left on its own terms is a recipe for defeat.  Even if Jindal wins, he&rsquo;ll govern as a racial particularist, albeit a &#8220;conservative&#8221; one.  </p>
<p>The modern Right can&rsquo;t grasp that white racial particularism is a noble form of conservatism itself.  The last thing we want to do is &#8220;energize&#8221; the base with a culture-war ideologue of Third World extraction.  </p>

		<p>c23: &#8220;Jindal is a convert to Christianity, which makes him sort of a race traitor to Hindu Indians and shows that he&rsquo;s assimilating/ed to American culture.&#8221;</p>
<p>What does this have to do with anything?  FYI c23, a substantial percentage of Indians *are* Christian, and India has 200-250 million Muslims, as well as Sikhs, Jains and of course Hindus.  (Even the Hindus aren&rsquo;t unified  &mdash;   lower-caste Hindus and the Untouchables often have their own forms of worship.)  Likewise, most African-Americans are also Christian.</p>
<p>But they very clearly are not White by any stretch, never will be and never want to be.  There&rsquo;s no reason they should  &mdash;   they have every right to celebrate their ethnic identity and their culture, *as do we*.  And the way the US media and political system has gone recently, only Whites here are denied this most basic right.  &#8220;Assimilation&#8221; is one of those weasel words that is absolutely useless for describing our wretched peril today as a nation, and as a people.  I don&rsquo;t care how many pretenses toward assimilation Bobby Jindal puts on  &mdash;   Indian-Americans often try to claim assimilation, but they are perhaps the most cliquish and self-interested of any ethnic group here in the USA, far more than any other.</p>
<p>Indians and Indian-Americans have also done far more economic damage to the United States than Iraq or al-Qaeda could ever do, since by encouraging outsourcing and the H1-B visa, India has almost singlehandedly dismantled the US tech industry.  On a personal level I wish the best for Jindal in Louisiana, but he is absolutely unacceptable as a major party candidate, in a nation where Whites are already heading for minority status and being reminded of our powerlessness more and more every day.  </p>
<p>If the Republicans even consider nominating Bobby Jindal, for the Presidency or Vice-Presidency slot, then they&rsquo;ll effectively destroy the Republican Party for good.  Because tens of millions of already angry, disenfranchised White Americans will see that the GOP, just like the Democrats, has abandoned White Americans and embraced affirmative action and the PC culture that are ruining this country.  We will then rapidly embrace any Third Party that stands up for our people.</p>
<p>Indians are some of the worst opportunists here, since they&rsquo;ve done nothing to build the USA up for our four centuries since 1607, but now that the United States is a wealthy nation, they want to siphon off our established riches and good name for themselves.  (Whatever differences we&rsquo;ve had with Blacks and Latinos, at the very least they&rsquo;ve had a strong presence and been working in the United States from the get-go.)  And the Indians are using the classic bludgeon of White guilt, to which the Republicans are as vulnerable as the Democrats, to rub the nose of increasingly feeble Whites in how pathetic we&rsquo;ve become.  Whites have poured too much of our blood, sweat and tears into the USA to allow an interloper from India like Jindal to capture a major party ticket, and if the GOP insists on marginalizing beleaguered Whites still further, the GOP will be the Whigs of the early 21st century, ensuring their rapid demise.  And quite deservedly.</p>

Like all East Indian politicians in the U.S., Bobby Jindal supports massive increases in legal Third World immigration.  He may criticize illegal Mexicans, but he wants the country flooded with &#8220;legal&#8221; East Indians.</p>

		<p>As a conservative, traditionalist white Hispanic (yes, there is such a thing, and I ams white as any Anglo-American white, as all my ancestors come from Spain), I am not impressed by the twisted logic that is ready to put all remaining hope for this country by voting for one self-styled &#8220;conservative&#8221; non-white politician to save us from a liberal non-white politician. </p>
<p>Where does it end?  If Jindal were truly the paradigm of social conservatism and respectful of this country&rsquo;s identity, he himself would reject such a notion and support a truly conservative white man for the presidency.  But of course he is not; he happens to be in Louisiana, so he caters to the Louisiana electorate.  If he were a Hindu Republican in Illinois, he would cater to that constituency, and so on.  Jindal is a politician, and the fate of Western (white) civilization is not foremost on his mind. </p>
<p>And to those of you who have lost faith in your own race and civilization to the extreme that you are willing to ask one cultural barbarian to save you from another sort of barbarian, where does your logic lead us?  To bring it home, would you marry your lilly white daughter to the likes of Mr. Jindal?! </p>
<p>Get real. </p>
<p>Only a white man can save white, European, Western civilization; no one else would love and understand our nation and our culture and our civilization as one of its own. </p>
<p>So much for your Jindal.  Indeed, such talk is symtomatic of the utter defeat of the Republican party when it has to accept the very terms of its ideological opponent, i.e., racial surrender and dissolution, in order to think itself capable of regaining power. </p>
<p>Plus, Jindal is even more foreign to the Hispanic electorate than Obama. </p>
<p>Back to drawing board, Jindal fanatics. </p>

		<p>For those that may be willing to overlook Jindal&rsquo;s Indian-ness, I warn you. </p>
<p>Indians (and Pakistanis, for that matter) are very unconcerned about the future of the white race. They&rsquo;d have no problem assimilating whites into their race through immigration, misceganation, and cultural appropriation.  They are a bigger threat than Africans or Chinese, because they are numerous and tireless at aping our ways and imitating us in their manner and speech.</p>
