<h1>Transition to Black Rule?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jared Taylor, <font color="red">Special to AR News,</font> November 14, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The presidential election of 2008 brings to mind another vote that took place 16 years ago in South Africa: the referendum in which whites voted to turn power over to blacks. Though it has long been overshadowed by the 1994 general elections that brought the African National Congress (ANC) to power, it was the referendum of March 17, 1992, that ended white rule.</p>
<p>By 1992, President F. W. de Klerk and his National Party government had repealed all the major apartheid laws. The ANC had been unbanned, and Mr. de Klerk had started discussions with Mr. Mandela on a new constitution that would enfranchise blacks and &#8220;share power.&#8221;</p>
<p>Andries Treurnicht and his Conservative party led the opposition to these negotiations, saying the president had no authority to negotiate a new constitution. Mr. de Klerk decided to put the question to the people. If he won the referendum, he would push on to a new constitution; if he lost, he would resign and call a general election.</p>
<p>The referendum asked the following question: &#8220;Do you support continuation of the reform process which the State President began on February 2, 1990, and which is aimed at a new constitution through negotiation?&#8221; (It was on February 2, 1990, that Mr. de Klerk announced the unbanning of the ANC and the release of Mr. Mandela from prison.)</p>
<p>The National Party &mdash; the traditional party of the Afrikaners &mdash; mounted a massive campaign for a &#8220;yes&#8221; vote, warning that a &#8220;no&#8221; would mean more international sanctions and black violence. One of its campaign posters was of an armed member of the Afrikaner Resistance Movement &mdash; a militant white organization &mdash; with the slogan, &#8220;You can stop this man! Vote YES.&#8221; In other words, the real menace for South Africa was a white man with a gun.</p>
<p>The Conservative Party, which campaigned for a &#8220;no&#8221; vote, warned that &#8220;power sharing&#8221; was just another name for black rule, and that whites had the right and the duty to govern themselves.</p>
<p>How did the people of the Great Trek, the Battle of Blood River, and the Boer War vote? They feared international isolation more than they feared black rule; whites voted 68 to 31 percent for &#8220;continuation of the reform process.&#8221; Nor was this a decision forced upon Afrikaners by white English-speakers. Though some militant groups boycotted the referendum, all election analysts agree that a majority of Afrikaners voted &#8220;yes,&#8221; and some even believe there was more support among Afrikaners than British South Africans. Whites therefore had the chance to keep their country, but gave it away. That vote ensured the ANC victory of 1994 and everything that has followed.</p>
<p>American whites are not quite as eager as the South Africans were. In the November 4 election, only 43 percent voted for black rule &mdash; pardon me, for Barack Obama. Fifty-five percent of whites wanted John McCain to be their president but it was blacks and Hispanics who got the president they wanted, not whites. Every year, as the number of non-whites increases, whites will have less say about who rules them.</p>
<p>Entirely aside from politics or questions of competence or experience, the election of a president most whites did not want is a jarring symbol of lost autonomy. If their numbers continue to decline, whites will not get the schools, the neighborhoods, the culture &mdash; and ultimately, the country &mdash; they want.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is because whites have brought diminished status upon themselves that we are expected to take pride in it rather than fight to reverse it. As Paul Krugman explained helpfully in the New York Times, &#8220;If the election of our first African-American president didn&rsquo;t stir you, if it didn&rsquo;t leave you teary-eyed and proud of your country, there&rsquo;s something wrong with you.&#8221; This means there is something wrong with at least 55 percent of whites, but that has been the Times&rsquo;s position for years.</p>
<p>Mr. Krugman&rsquo;s joy in Mr. Obama&rsquo;s victory is shared by whites all around the world. &#8220;We have great hopes that we are standing at the dawn of a new era,&#8221; wrote the Norwegian daily Aftenposten. &#8220;One Giant Step for Mankind&#8221; read the front page of England&rsquo;s Sun newspaper. A headline on the London Telegraph website declared: &#8220;Barack Obama Victory Allows Britain to Love US Again.&#8221; The Times modestly headlined its election story, &#8220;The New World.&#8221; Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada spoke of Mr. Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;tremendous, historic&#8221; victory, and the Toronto Sun called it &#8220;an historic milestone like no other.&#8221; Le Monde in Paris noted that &#8220;from Left to Right, [French] politicians have been competing for superlatives with which to praise the election of Barack Obama.&#8221; Milan&rsquo;s Corriere della Sera wrote that Mr. Obama was &#8220;the man who can save America from utter breakdown.&#8221;</p>
<p>This chorus of rejoicing has eerie parallels to how the world&rsquo;s whites welcomed black rule in South Africa. In 1993, Mr. Mandela and Mr. de Klerk shared the Nobel Peace Prize for their new, &#8220;power-sharing&#8221; constitution. Mary McGrory of the Washington Post gushed only slightly more than most when she wrote in her May 12, 1994 column that &#8220;Nelson Mandela has won what the [Washington] Post calls &lsquo;one of history&rsquo;s sweetest victories over racial subjugation&rsquo; and he is going to keep it clean and beautiful so that newspaper readers will think they are reading scripture when they read dispatches from South Africa that cannot be read except through tears.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fourteen years later &mdash; just 14 years later &mdash; does anyone have second thoughts? Under white rule, South Africa was climbing steadily in the UN&rsquo;s Human Development Index. It reversed course the first year of black rule and has dropped ever since. South Africa can no longer keep accurate crime statistics, but it is unquestionably one of the most dangerous places on earth. Anyone who can afford to lives in a private fortress, and carjacking is so common it is considered foolish to stop at a red light after dark. Amazon.com limits shipping to South Africa because postal workers steal so many packages. Interpol reports that South Africa has the highest rape rate in the world &mdash; and the highest AIDS rate. About one-fifth of South African men admit they have raped a woman, and an estimated 35 percent of the armed forces have AIDS. Race preferences for blacks are so ruthless that approximately 50 percent of white men are self-employed and nearly a million whites have emigrated, most citing crime and race preferences.</p>
<p>Surely, not even Mary McGrory would think this sounds like the Book of Matthew. And how about Mr. de Klerk? Would he not give up a hundred Nobel Peace Prizes for a country in which his grandchildren could be safe and proud?</p>
<p>Of course, our election is different from the South African referendum but the effect is the same: Whites are placing their destinies in the hands of others. The South Africans did it suddenly; we are doing it gradually.</p>
<p>Let us hope whites all over the world save their newspapers from November 5, 2008, with their extravagant headlines and dizzy hopes. Let them reread them 10 or 15 years from now &mdash; and let them think of South Africa.<br>

		<p>Why is it that so many whites believe only blacks can bring about equal and fair treatment? <br>
Is this a pathological problem that with early diagnosis can be prevented? <br>
How can people be so blind as to not see the hundreds of examples in history where this has been proven wrong?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to go to South Africa to see this. Go to Selma, Birmingham or Tuscaloosa Alabama. Try to visit part of New Orleans and ask a black cop for help. </p>
<p>Mr. Taylor, what is left that we can do? I honestly don&rsquo;t see an answer to our continual downward spiral. </p>

<p>I hope he is wrong, but I suspect he is right.</p>
<p>Can anyone tell me what the hell is wrong with White people?</p>
<p>(I just read, however, that Japanese married couples [about one-third of them] are no longer having sex. So maybe this lack of vitality is not just a White phenomenom? Maybe, instead, it is a phenomenom of peoples at a certain level of intelligence?)</p>
<p>God knows I can&rsquo;t figure it out. </p>
<p>I, myself, am tired of being a mammal, and fully sympathize with the Japanese. But, hell, I&rsquo;m almost 60.    </p>

		<p>Sometimes things have to really hit rock bottom before they start to get better. I think we have now reached that point in this country. One doesn&rsquo;t even have to look to South Africa to see what happens with black rule. All one has to do is look to Gary, Detroit or any other black-run city. How blind must whites have to be not to see this? </p>
<p>All I can hope is after this disaster we start to get some strong white leaders in this country. If, after 4 years, that still hasn&rsquo;t happened, I will have to start agreeing with those who see this as &#8220;the end&#8221; for this country.</p>

		<p>Great comments.  This is close to the last wakeup call.  There is still time.  Support NumbersUSA, Fairus, Amren, Vdare, etc.  Call your senator and congressman.  We must reduce legal immigration to below 25,000 per year in.  This will result in a net flow out. We must eliminate affirmative action.  We must end welfare.  We must also stop being ashamed of being white and speak up for whites when they say what we believe and stand up for us.</p>

<p><br>
Bravo Mr. Taylor, to the most moving and prescient paragraph in your work above!</p>
<p>There might be something &#8220;wrong&#8221; with me, but then again there might not be?</p>
<p>I was left &#8220;teary-eyed&#8221; and stirred, by the election of our first African-American president, but it was through the force of my vomiting, and not my pride. I was that sickened, when the results came in, that I did literally throw up! </p>
<p>I, like the other 55% of real Americans, voted for McCain; I had hoped to avoid this nightmare. But now I know what it feels like to live within a nightmare, what it really feels like, to live in a world totally devoid of normalcy; it is how the fictional characters in films like: &#8220;Night of the Living Dead,&#8221; or &#8220;Godzilla,&#8221; must feel like as their world is turned upside down. Everything they ever believed in, is now set to question and rejection. </p>
<p>The sad thing is, unlike those fictional characters in such movies, 45% of us willing sought out and achieved a reanimation of the dead or the creation of an atomic T-Rex?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>America may be following in the footsteps of South Africa, but America IS NOT South Africa. The worst part about S. Africans handing power over to the Blacks was that, if you are such a small minority of the population, when you hand all your power to the majority, you can&rsquo;t ever get it back. America isn&rsquo;t like that. Whites are still the majority in this country.(For now anyway) We have a fierce independent streak that is pretty unique.  We have never known Black Rule. Most of the Whites who voted for Obama probably have had very limited experiences with Blacks. Many White South Africans have realized the mistake that was made. The problem is that they make up to small of a percentage of the population to reverse course. Their only options are to either leave or hunker down. Our options will be much different when Whites wake up. </p>

		<p>The truth is simple. Millions and millions of White people in Western civilization value our shared White heritage and our European culture. Conversely, the wealthiest White people value profits more than culture and their own race. They profit from the presence of minorities and send us the bill. We are powerless to stop it. It&rsquo;s as simple as that. </p>

		<p>Mr. Taylor now tells us by electing Obama President &#8220;Whites are placing their destinies in the hands of others.&#8221;  I agree. </p>
<p>May I ask why wasn&rsquo;t this a prime concern of Mr. Taylor before the election. In the Novmeber issue of AR Mr. Taylor thought the country would be no better off electing McCain than Obama. Certainly the inferences drawn from the most current article are to the contrary. Why the change of heart?</p>

		<p>Absolutely excellent points, plus there&rsquo;s a wealth of information in the article I wasn&rsquo;t aware of.  I had no idea the Boers voted so overwhelmingly for turning over the government to blacks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to know what the propaganda and brainwashing in the media amounted to in the run up to the election, but I&rsquo;m involved in so many other things I doubt I&rsquo;ll have time to check into it, unless I can get my hands on a brief explanation that covers just the main points.  I&rsquo;m aware that several left wing kooks were naively in favor of creating their beloved rainbow utopia and actively pursued it, but surely there must have been something that created such an ignorant, misinformed mind set to favor giving up control.</p>
<p>And another fact I&rsquo;ve always known is that there was and always has been a highly hostile white South African force that has always, and will always, be ready to fight when the time is right.  They&rsquo;re outraged by the present situation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s strange how many black murderers and criminals can come across as seemingly fair and balanced.</p>
<p>On this web site, for example we&rsquo;ve had a black or two who projected the epitome of fairness and reason, claiming to want only a dialogue so we could come together to solve our differences.  They fool many people everytime one of them comes on, until somebody exposes them for what they are.</p>
<p>How long will it be, I wonder, until we read and hear of so many things that this Obama reveals that has absolutely nothing to do &hellip;or the exact opposite&hellip;.with &#8220;bringing us together?&#8221; </p>
<p>When he said he wants to create a Civilian Defense Force as well-funded and as powerful as the military, he was uttering one of the few clues of his real agenda we have been privy to, because the MSM failed to do their job by investigating this black demagogue.  Because of their stupid, ignorant, unquestioning faith in him they could well be the cause of this country imploding in a much quicker fashion than if McCain were elected.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in a terrible dilemma.</p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t it ironic that the widow of Alan Paton, who wrote the anti-apartheid novel &#8220;Cry The Beloved Country,&#8221; decided to leave South Africa because of how the country had been destroyed since the Blacks took power?  But Paton himself sensed that this may very well happen when he wrote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have one great fear in my heart, that one day when they [the whites of South Africa] have turned to loving, they will find we [the blacks] are turned to hating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Paton had studied his African history more carefully, he would have understood that Black africans understand life in the most simple terms  &mdash;  power, cruelty, and revenge  &mdash;  and the quality of life there for hundreds of thousands of years reflect that.  </p>
<p>His white Christian ideas of mercy, self-sacrifice, justice, and human dignity built Europe and America among people for whom those ideas resonated.  In the end, all that his life&rsquo;s work accomplished was to usher in the brutality of Black communist rule, under the white-hating benign smile of Nelson Mandela.  Now America has its own Mandela with the election of Obama.</p>

		<p>     Of course, no one remembers de Klerc now-just Mandela. After<br>
all, giving away White sovereignty was the least he could do. At<br>
some level, even then people knew it was a chump deal done under<br>
duress. As for McGory, I&rsquo;ve heard that scripture quote before. <br>
One wonders what she thinks now-assuming that she really thought<br>
about it before or that she&rsquo;s capable of thought at all. How much<br>
you want to bet she thought it through and voted for Obama?</p>

		<p>I hope whites do save some of that Amen election reportage. But 15, or even 10, years is too much lag time for a response. If whites want a homeland preserved for them, they need to get good and mad sooner than that. If more whites do not expressly vote their racial interests in 2 or 4 years, then I am not sure they have the gumption to ever do so. And unless we change course soon, we will not have the numbers to effect peaceful change regardlesss of our will.</p>
<p>The only result of this election I look forward to is comparing the MSM&rsquo;s Amen response to Amren&rsquo;s warnings, checking for predictive power in the next few years. Watch Wall Street&rsquo;s ongoing nosedive if you want to know how the smart money is betting now.</p>

		<p>I think Mr Taylor would think differently had Alan Keyes or Thomas Sewell been elected president. The evil here, judging by all results, is that whites in SA were not givin a third choice. &#8216;Apartheid&rsquo;, &#8216;powersharing&rsquo; and &#8216;autonomy&rsquo;. Elections always seem to come down to picking the lessor of two evils. &#8216;Apartheid&rsquo; was the greater evil, and &#8216;Powersharing&rsquo;, not an evil at all. There is a point, however, where it could certainly be claimed that the disappearance of the white race is an evil. I don&rsquo;t think we can expect people of color to point this out. It&rsquo;s difficult to do that when you&rsquo;re too busy celebrating. </p>

<p>Re: etymology of white trash, word history of phrase &#8220;white trash,&#8221; dictionary white trash, thesaurus white trash, meaning of white trash</p>
<p>Greenberg:  The phrase &#8220;white trash&#8221; originally meant a white person who procreated with a non-white person, but it recently has taken on a wider meaning.</p>
<p>The poet T.S. Eliot also considered &#8220;white trash&#8221; to be a white person who fornicated with a non-white.<br>

		<p>The lesson learned?<br>
Clueless, naive, white liberals and the gated Elite are the true enemies. Why aren&rsquo;t we going after them? Perhaps places like New Hampshire and Vermont SHOULD get a true taste of MS-13 and haitian refugees in good old Concord and Montpelier.</p>
<p>To defeat Obama in 2012, all his opponent needs is one good Willie Horton ad, one &#8220;supports racial quotas&#8221; ad, and an anti illegal immigration ad.<br>
Force youself to endure these things as long as we can get fake republicans like McCain, Bush, and Hutchinson out of office.<br>
It&rsquo;s that simple.</p>
<p>Palin is being groomed. I hope she doesn&rsquo;t turn liberal in 4 years.</p>
<p>If the GOP offers another Bob Dole or McCain, I&rsquo;m voting Democrat to show the Republican Party that &#8220;Lesser of 2 Evils&#8221; is a strategy that will no longer work.</p>

		<p>What the US Election shows is that while Blacks have a fully developed racial consciousness and are proud of themselves regardless of achievement. Whites by contrast can be divided into:</p>
<p>(1) Racially conscious and proud (est. 20%)<br>
(2) Racially conscious and guilty (est. 30%)<br>
(3) Racially &#8220;subconscious&#8221; (est. 40-50%)<br>
(4) Racially unconscious (est.0-10%)</p>
<p>In the US Election, Group 1 voters were present in large numbers in the old South, where the White vote held up. Many of these people know Blacks and may even like them, but still clearly identify with their own group and are proud to do so.</p>
<p>When polled, Group 2 have a tendency to say they will vote for the non-White candidate and then not vote for him (Bradley effect) but many of them will vote for a non-White candidate out of sheer guilt and inverted racism, especially if the other candidate is poor (as was the case in this election).</p>
<p>Group 3 like to think of themselves as beyond racism and look down on the other groups, yet, strangely enough, you can find many of this group living in all-White neighbourhoods, going to all-White churches, sending their kids to largely White schools, and associating mainly with Whites or the occasional non-White who acts &#8216;White.&rsquo; They are acting as if they had White consciousness, which they do but at the subconscious level. Many of these actually voted for Obama because he didn&rsquo;t come across as a typical black, thanks to his White and East African blood.</p>
<p>Since racial consciousness is a natural thing, Group 4 people are usually those with extremely low IQs or those who have damaged their minds beyond repair with drugs or alcohol, or have constructed their identity on atypical sexual practices, having reduced themselves to a point where the normal parameters of human identity no longer have any meaning.</p>
<p>The main problems are the &#8220;racially conscious but guilty&#8221; group and the &#8220;racially subconsious.&#8221; However, a Black man having symbolic power will greatly reduce White guilt while raising White &#8220;subconsciousness&#8221; into consciousness. After four years of Obama we should have:<br>
 <br>
(1) Racially conscious and proud (40%)<br>
(2) Racially conscious and guilty (30%)<br>
(3) Racially &#8220;subconscious&#8221; (20-30%)<br>
(4) Racially unconscious (0-10%)<br>
 <br>
Group 2s have become Groups 1s, and Group 3s have become Group 2s.</p>

		<p>The only good thing is that American blacks constitute only 12% of the population.  The weird thing is that whites would even vote for a black man to begin with.  I know several who think that this is the greatest country on Earth because a black man was elected.  At least that is the mentality of very misled white people.</p>

		<p>Fairly accurate article, I lived there during that period. In 1986 the government in South Africa started talks with the ANC of Mandela. De Klerk promised its electorate power sharing with &#8220;checks and balances&#8221;. Ensuring equality to all. The negotiating team led by Tertius Delport stood firm on the basis of its negotiations which angered the ANC. De Klerk replced Delport with the spineless weazel Roelf Meyer. Roelf Meyer was no match for the ANC and he and de Klerk signed away the whites rights in South Africa. The treason commited by De Klerk led to the whites being treated like outcasts in their own country. I know, I witnessed it personally.</p>

Where will those who crave law, order, the reverence of knowledge, and the discipline of the sciences go? Perhaps eastern Europe, or maybe (as many think) China&rsquo;s star will rise above the corrupt and mentally deficient West as it slowly sinks into tribalism and savagery. </p>

		<p>Unfortunately, I believe whites&rsquo; transition to powerlessness will occur over such an extended period of time that it will be too late to do anything about it by the time the average white wakes up.  Consider Obama:  He is being extremely cagey by selecting or appointing, so far, fairly able, experienced white men.  Thus, he is reassuring the average white who voted for him, as well as many of those who didn&rsquo;t.  He will not be allowed to fail, either by those who surround him nor by the press.  They simply will not allow the first black President to be seen as a failure, no matter how much of a failure he actually may be.  Thus, he will win a second term, and there will be more Obamas who are more &#8220;authentically&#8221; black waiting in the wings.  After we&rsquo;ve been softened up for eight years, we will see even more boldness and radicalness on the part of nonwhites and will be so outnumbered as to be powerless.  We will be strangers in our own land.  Better to start now seeking out a new homeland and quietly and without fanfare moving there.  The American I knew is lost.  </p>

		<p>I see one way for Whites to survive as a distinct people: Breed like crazy and produce so many of us, that our lands become so full of us that our borders will be turned into metaphorical semi-permeable membranes that allow us to go out but no others to come in.</p>
<p>All living things seek comfort.  Our lands when full of us, will no longer be comfortable for others. Then, as our numbers increase, our natural low tolerance for crowding will cause many of us to go into other lands where we can find more comfort.</p>
<p>Let the non-Whites start being on the reciving end of OUR White millions.  Let them compete with OUR teeming masses and see who wins.</p>
<p>Of course, this is much easier said than done and unless our people have a real spiritual rebirth and realize that having children is the most important thing we can do,we&rsquo;re going to continue this slow die-off that we&rsquo;re now seeing.</p>

The good news:</p>
<p>Euphoria over the election of a black man as president won&rsquo;t drive people to keep voting for blacks in the future. </p>
<p>Reason: The &#8220;time&#8221; will have passed   &mdash;   it just won&rsquo;t seem to have the same power or significance next time around. Blacks will keep voting for blacks, and whites will get bored of the idea.</p>
<p>Look at the cities of Los Angeles and New York. They had black mayors in the past. They don&rsquo;t now.</p>

		<p>TexasJoe -  I was told on the SAS site that both the Western and North Cape provinces were still with the Nats after the election, and that there was great shuffling or redistricting in the north, and a massive relocation of bantus to the west to &#8220;fix&#8221; this problem. I understand that some folks had expended the effort to get more whites to move to locations where they could form a majority, but that many just wanted to stay in Joburg, Pretoria, Gauteng, etc and make money. </p>
<p>I think about SA a great deal. I don&rsquo;t think the liberals can be helped - they will have to learn the hard way, but there has to be a bunch of folks who just want to get out. What do you know about the status of things in Namibia? Is it possible for folks to relocate there, or would the Swapo government prevent that?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been proven that William Ayres wrote the more coherent portions of Obama&rsquo;s book, and Obama refuses to release his records, AND he&rsquo;s done nothing more than recite a very practiced script allowing him fluency and a measure of &#8220;articulateness,&#8221; so how do you arrive at the fact that Obama is more intelligent than anyone?  I mean, if he were proud of his accomplishments wouldn&rsquo;t he want the public to know?  I would.  So would most others. The only reason to refuse to produce them is because they&rsquo;re mediocre at best or substandard.  Consider the following:</p>
<p>1. Occidental College records   &mdash;   Not released <br>
2. Columbia College records   &mdash;   Not released <br>
3. Columbia Thesis paper   &mdash;   &#8216;not available&rsquo; <br>

13. Record of baptism  &mdash;   Not released or &#8216;not available&rsquo; <br>
14. Illinois State Senate records  &mdash;  &#8216;not available&rsquo; </p>
<p>Too, have you considered that if Obama has any intelligence above the white professional I.Q. average, certainly he owes it to his mother and not the black alcoholic who lived in a land that had an average I.Q. of 70?</p>

		<p>I have not had one person who can answer the question - Why would white men and women so eagerly turn their country over to black rule when history has shown, that blacks are incapable of governing in a sensible, responisible way?</p>
<p>I said before the election that an election victory for Comrade Obama would mean only that we were just a few more steps closer to third world status.  That the U.S. would be no different than South Africa or any other country ruled by blacks.  </p>
<p>The election of a black man to the White House means only one thing to the 95% of blacks that voted for him - one of their own will now be sitting at the desk in the Oval Office.  Blacks voted overwhelmingly for Obama for one reason and one reason only - he managed to convince the 95% that he was truly an &#8220;African-American.&#8221;</p>
<p>But as I said before, without the white and hispanic vote, Comrade Obama would have returned to his Senate seat.  There definitely more white faces in the crowds at Grant Park on November 4th.  The adulation on their faces was, I hate to say, chilling.  That so many white people could be lulled into a cult like worship for a man that we know nothing about is mind boggling.  Unless someone can come up with a reasonable explanation for the overwhelming white support of Obama, I can only conclude that whites also voted for him simply because it was the trendy thing to do - vote for the black guy.  After all, being pounded with white is bad and black is good for most of their lives, the 18-30 year olds couldn&rsquo;t have done anything else.</p>

<p>Thank you for the informative and inspiring article.</p>
<p>When the White Ruling Elite stop using lesser White Men for profit and power, then the White Man will regain some local control. </p>
<p>Until then White Men will only dream about their freedom and potential via blogs, websites, the dinner table, card games and old history.</p>
<p>The faster the current White Ruling Elite, who pull the strings of political leaders like Obama and Bush, destroy themselves and have nowhere else to loot and destroy the faster a New White Ruling Elite will rise to the occasion.  </p>
<p>Let us never blame the Black Man, the Mexican, or the African for our plight.  The White Man gave it all away. Our first step to recovery and any future glory is to act as men and take responsibility for our actions.</p>
<p>The world is not a partnership of shared interests between races and countries. It is a competition for life, liberty and prosperity. </p>

And these thugs were usually OPENLY racist,constantly in trouble and had, maybe on a good day, a &#8220;D&#8221; grade point average. But the White kids just LOVED them. Once they even elected a black girl as prom queen that, I swear, could&rsquo;ve been a double for Ester Rolle from the Good Times T.V. show. You will NEVER see the reverse happen at mainly black schools. These Whites are the same type that grew up to vote on Obama.</p>

		<p>The scary part of an Obama term is the damage that he can do inside those 4 years.  First and foremost is the amnesty that he will give to the 20 million illegal immigrants.  Thats 20 million voters who will look at the Dear Leader Obama as their saviour.  Even if the Mexi-Cans don&rsquo;t organize into a voting bloc, that&rsquo;s still a lot of people that could keep the Socialists in power for more than four years.  The Supreme Court could be filled with leftists that will legislate from the bench, throwing their power behind their appointer, Obama and the Socialist/Democrat party. With the rampant election stealing that is going on in this country, thanks to George Soros and the other shadow financiers of the Democrat party. We could be looking at a generation under Socialist rule.  Old men with memories of how it used to be will be no match for the young Marxist&rsquo;s.  </p>

Giving the White man the finger, in other words. There will never be another White man in the WH. Maybe paint the WH a multi-color? Europe now is headed the same way and are rushing to elect their first Black, etc&hellip;..The White race is doomed and it is official and without intervention from God Almighty, just kiss your race goodbye.

		<p>Jared, you  really hit on something profound when you wrote:&#8221;we are putting our fate in the hands of other people&#8221;. OR to be more explicit about it:WE are putting our fate in the hands of non-whites. White Nationalist should look for  opportunities to talk to White Repblicans and start the conversation exactly like this:Why are you putting the fate of White Americans in the hands of blacks,hispanics,asians and muslims? Initially, the White Republicans wont have a clue as to what you are talking about. And this fact really just goes to show just how deep the sickness is in White Republican America. Explain to them in great detail how every time they voted for a Republican president and White Senator, they voted for a massive reduction in the percentage of the Native Born White population of America and at the same time a massive increase in the non-white population. Tell them this is because of Republican immigration policy. Tell them that it is an indisputable fact that Reublican party immigration party has allowed into America millions of non-whites who are breeding very rapidly within the borders of America and, as a consequence, they now have the numbers to  out vote White Americans-by just enough at the present time -to force openly anti-white presients into office. Tell them that they are being out voted by non-whites and that this will become much worse over time.</p>

		<p>As historial time passes, distinction of players on the other side are lost. Remember Gorbamania? Now his speeches are ignored. Just another Communist leader who did what history forced him to do. This hasn&rsquo;t been lost on Putin, to his credit.</p>
<p>De Klerk, no doubt had the same heady illusion, contempory flattery would be his epitaph. Once you give away your country it&rsquo;s harder to find a second country to give away. Black myth will increasingly see him as the last Apartheid leader, the one forced to give up power, not by his nobility, but by black force and nobility. Once you give up your country, your power, everything changes. He&rsquo;s not one of the &#8220;good whites&#8221; from their point of view. The winners write history in a way that makes them look good.  </p>
<p>Think of the billions of people that have lived, all but a few totally forgotten, infinite variety and nuance in individuals, down a black hole. As &#8216;news&rsquo; turns into history and history turns into myth, what will be remembered: the people that were representive of their people, their race. They become symbols, and will bring the rest of us forgotten to life as part of the myth: George Washington, Joan of Arc, Cervantes. They were for us as White People.</p>
<p>The progressive liberals that think they&rsquo;re the march of history, linked with the past and future, by being &#8220;humane&#8221;, &#8220;just&#8221;, &#8220;inclusive&#8221; to other races, have strayed  from the narrative. They&rsquo;re sleep-walking through the myth of the the blacks, Latinos, and Muslims. They&rsquo;re part of the narrative of these other races. They&rsquo;re like those conquered people the Romans marched through their Capital to symbolize their own conquest. The foot on the back of our necks has nothing to do with the way we&rsquo;d like to be in our essential universality. </p>

<p>As I said before, if there&rsquo;s any good in this it&rsquo;s that a &#8216;black&rsquo; man was elected president while there is still a white majority.</p>
<p>What will determine future elections is how well he governs and what agendas he pushes. If he makes grandiose and expensive demands, he could unleash an angry, mobilized, and sizable opposition voting block.</p>
<p>Before Bush took office, he said nothing about uniting the US and Mexico. It was only after the election that he made his intentions known. He provoked a great deal of anger and backlash from his base who were sideswiped from behind in the dark.</p>
<p>Like Bush, Obama could go off the deep-end and reveal his true nature, whatever that may be, after he&rsquo;s sworn into office. If we have anything to be hopeful about it&rsquo;s that Obama might say or do something so outrageous, so extreme that enough of the white majority might open their eyes to make a difference.</p></p>

<p>Dr. Treurnicht also realized too late (sic quote Marcus Tullius Cicero 42 BC about treason from within).</p>
<p>My late father, PhD in chemistry and manager at the petrochemical factory SASOL (who by the way attended conferences with U.S. scientist in the 1980&rsquo;s in Chicago), told me of a letter before the referendum advising them to vote yes, otherwise the consequences would be heightened sanctions and job losses. And increased unrests amongst the non-whites. So whites were coerced into voting yes.</p>
<p>However by voting &#8216;yes&rsquo; in the referendum, they understood &#8220;Do you support continuation of the reform process&#8221;. </p>
<p>In no way they understood a complete handover of power to the ANC. </p>
<p>That was treason pure and simple towards the white voter.</p>
<p>My sister-in-law (Afrikaans) said: &#8220;God will not allow Mandela to become president&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Hold on - blacks will never rule this country.  They are already outnumbered by Hispanics.  Black birthrates are only slightly higher than those of whites.  It would take centuries for them to overtake us, and by then, the numbers of both blacks and whites will be a rounding error next to those of Hispanics.  Look to Latin America, not Africa, for our future.  That&rsquo;s bad, but not as bad as Africa.</p>
<p>Obama himself is half-white, raised and educated by whites, and is appointing Clintonites.  Basically, he&rsquo;s Clinton with a suntan.  A real black man like Al Sharpton or Marion Berry never has and never will have a shot at the White House.</p>

		<p>Winston Smith, I agree we are not like South Africa in numbers, but many of our fellow whites will not join our side until it is too late. They would much rather grovel at the feet of blacks than dare to be accused of racism.</p>
<p>Thomas Sowell or Alan Keyes would never stand a chance in an election. First, they also would need a great number of blacks to vote for them. Based on what I have seen blacks act in a very stereotypical behavior and insult the few blacks who can use intellect and common sense. I don&rsquo;t know about Mr. Taylor, but I would have felt much better having one of them than obama.</p>
<p>Gayle, I think many people voted against McCain out of pure hatred of Bush. Like you, I also seek an answer why whites cannot see the truth and are burying themselves and their children.</p>
<p>I read recently that there were almost no white protesters who showed up at the trial for the blacks who tortured and killed the white boy and his girlfriend in Tennessee. That is why we are destroying ourselves. We can&rsquo;t even get together to support a protest for as grievous injustice as this.</p>
<p>When half our white youngsters go around wearing sagging pants and listening to rap noise, what can you expect. They worship this disgusting lifestyle.</p>
<p>Does anyone know a good white website where we can congregate in a forum environment? Stormfront is too extreme for me. I like this web site, but would like a forum area.</p>

		<p>Am I the only one aware of the fact that that the continental U.S. has as its second largest population natives of south and central america? That an inability to speak spanish is pretty much an inability to find gainful employment in this country? How about that &#8216;hispanics&rsquo; manage to ethnically cleanse any neighborhood they move into of all blacks, while happily allowing asians and whites to remain, especially if they make an effort to learn hispanic culture and spanish language? Blacks are a disappearing ethnic group on this continent, this will be no Brazil, look to Mexico as a model of our future here. mestizos and creoles hate blacks, as do hispanic mulattos. Marrying up (racially) is a deeply respected tradition and whites are given preferential treatment for positions of authority. Look at some spanish language soap operas (tellingly easy to do in the states) to see this in action. I am an Argentine expat living in your country and I can tell you that this election of a mulatto (or indian, or mestizo, or etc., its all the same) happens periodically in latin america, sometimes after bloodshed, sometimes not, they make noise and go away after a term in office, usually under a cloud (or a hail of bullets). White america, relax, enjoy the ride. You&rsquo;ll enjoy the latin system much better than the anglo one you&rsquo;ve been sufferring under, and do better. </p>

		<p>The comparison between South Africa&rsquo;s election and this recent U.S. election is way out of line. South Africa is majority Black, and once they had power it was pretty much doomed. Here in the U.S. us whites are still the majority. Even though Obama has the top seat, there is still majority white rule in government. </p>
<p>Also, Mandela is an idiot. Obama is a intelligent man. He was top of this class at Harvard Law, that in itself speaks for his intelligence. I think the white genes have certainly helped him. We have a half-breed here in Massachusetts as well. Governor Deval Patrick, and he also seems intelligent. </p>
<p>So I think we should be alright for the time being. Certainly nothing to worry about in my lifetime. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Euphoria over the election of a black man  won&rsquo;t keep people voting for blacks in the future. It won&rsquo;t  have the same significance next time.

<p>Very good point, Reader-1.   Our culture, as of late, has had such an obsession with &#8220;breaking barriers&#8221; and &#8220;treading new ground&#8221; that a black pres will no longer  be a big deal. That barrier has been broken. The public gets quickly bored with novelty.  Maybe a handicapped lesibn Eskimo would be the next cause celebre, but a black man for pres is no longer breaking new ground. Been there, done that.</p>

		<p>There were definitely more white faces in the crowds at Grant Park on November 4th. The adulation on their faces was, I hate to say, chilling. That so many white people could be lulled into a cult like worship for a man that we know nothing about is mind boggling. <br>
Unless someone can come up with a reasonable explanation for the overwhelming white support of Obama, I can only conclude that whites also voted for him simply because it was the trendy thing to do. <br>
Posted by Gayle Sollenberger </p>
<p>I absolutely agree with you. But someone posted elsewhere that  (for fear of violence) 70% of the tickets were given out to whites and the rest to elderly black church ladies. That would explain  the preponderance of all the silly starstruck whites in the crowd.<br>

<p>I have noticed this myself.  I attended a high school that was about 50% White, 50% Black.  It definitely solidified racial consciousness being so evenly split.</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t tension or anything (usually), but everything was clearly segregated.  Us Whites in the school dominated everything.  All events were coordinated, run by, and featured White students.  All student council members, senior superlatives, etc. etc were White.</p>
<p>In neighboring counties that were a large majority White, there would be Black school presidents and prom queens and so on.</p>

		<p>The term black rule is an oxymoron.  The more correct term would be black chaos.  </p>
<p>The simple fact is that there is no proper place for black Africans in the modern world.  In truth, there was no place for them in world of the ancient Greeks and Romans.  Their lower level of intelligence renders them helpless, ineffectual, and destructive in any social environment above tribal primitivism.<br>
There are simply no instances of successful black rule.  None.  And where they have inherited power in previously orderly, prosperous, and civil societies they invariably have destroyed them in a very short time.  The accumulated wealth, wisdom, and order of centuries is destroyed in a few short years.  There are no exceptions to this immutable pattern of black incapacity and wanton destructiveness.</p>

		<p>If you think the situation is bad in America,well it is many times worse in Britain.<br>
Britain&rsquo;s political system is based on Members of Parliament (generally representing a political party), being elected (by a &#8216;first past the post&rsquo; non proportional representation system), being elected by individual parliamentary consituencies - which are geographical bounded regions containing roughly 60,000 electors each.<br>
 This is not the time or place to go into a detailed examination of the pros and cons of the British system, but suffice to say it maintains a two-party duopoly in perpetuity, but a crucial factor is the actual margin of voting difference between the two parties (Labour and Conservative - two cheeks of the same @ss, as one uncharitable wag put it), is generally small, and for all<br>
intents and purposes, elections are won and lost in a handful of constituencies called the &#8216;key marginals&rsquo;.<br>
 Now it just so happens that a great number of the &#8216;key marginal&rsquo; are based in inner-city areas with a massive immigrant population, the immigrant vote, especialy the enormous Pakistani muslim vote is always but always an en masse bloc which votes Labour (the mullahs actually direct the faithful to do this in the mosques).Recently however there was some disquiet from muslim voters about Tony Blair&rsquo;s war in Iraq - this cost Labour at the very least three parliamentary seats.<br>
  But the most disturbing aspect of it all is the evolution of a symbiotic relationship between the immigrant bloc vote and the modern Labor Party.Strangely enough, the labour party was founded in the toil and strife of Victorian Britain to exclusively fight for working-class interests, but today&rsquo;s Lasbour Party is the most hateful, ruthless and pitiless foe the English working class has ever had to contend with in history - through its insane fetish for uncontrolled 3rd world immigration it has generally destroyeed the English working class into a state of demoralized pauperhood.Bt, back to the main point.All modern Labour cares about, like all bureaucracies in the termianal state is its own survival ie fat salaries for cushy jobs paid for by the taxpayer, in order to secure its survival Labour has evolved the symbiotic relationship with pakistani immigrants whereby Labour&rsquo;s vampire-like existence is assured by immigrant votes in the key marginals (everyone else can be ignored), and in turn Labour priveleges immigrants (generous susidies, affirmative action, even laxer &#8216;controls&rsquo;).<br>
 A truly dreadful situation has come about.</p>

		<p>Personally I believe this whole mess started in the 60&rsquo;s with LBJ&rsquo;s Great Society and his belief in the Scattered Site Housing Program. Prior to this blacks pretty much kept to themselves in their own onclaves. Because of this there was very little data available regarding their culture and values. After their dispersal into scattered site housing it became quite apparent as to their propensity toward violent crime and murder. Now enter the white liberals who believed this propensity was due to a lack of opportunity afforded blacks to achieve equality with whites. Now after almost 40 years of being afforded every opportunity a society can afford its members to succeed many blacks still retain their cultrual dispositions of violence and murder. One again I state that white liberalism is an all prevasive disease that is slowly destroying America.</p>

		<p> It&rsquo;s never a good idea to become a minority. These foolish white politicians who refuse to close the border and not enforce immigration laws are doing a grave disservice to their white contituents. Probably nowhere else in the world would a group of people voluntarily agree to become a minority. But here in the U.S., white politicians do. Everyone blames the corrupt media for promoting open borders. They do. But ultimately it rests on the politicians who make our laws. They&rsquo;re the ones at fault. Kennedy, Pelosi, Reid, Durbin, Reagan, the two Bushes, Boxer, Feinstein, the two Clintons, these are some of the people responsible for the white collapse. They should be voted out.</p>

<p>In the states, the only reason you don&rsquo;t see many American Blacks in Latin communities is the same reason you don&rsquo;t see American whites; they don&rsquo;t speak the language.</p>

<p>BI, that is typical of your &#8220;insights!&#8221;</p>
<p>Since they do not speak our &#8220;common&#8221; language, is it not fair to say that their &#8220;communities,&#8221; are really colonies?</p>
<p>Colonization is wrong, so I have been told my entire life.</p>
<p>Put two and two together&hellip;?</p>

		<p>&#8220;He is not half white. He is black. It has to do with dominant vs. recessive genes&#8221;<br>
Genetics for skin color is not the same as for eye color<br>
Eye - two genes, one dominant, one recessive<br>
Skin - eight genes. 64 possible combinations. They work in combination rather than dominant/recessive. Obama is darker than the average American mulatto because most American blacks have white genes. Also, Obama, Sr. was exceptionally dark - ink black or jet black.</p>

<p>Great post.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it interesting that the following was blasted by the Washington Post BEFORE the Bush/Gore 2000 election:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.Confidential college transcripts and test scores obtained by the Washington Post reveal that neither presidential candidate, George W. Bush nor Al Gore, were shining students during their college days at Yale and Harvard, respectively. Although each earned respectable scores on the SAT college admissions test (a total of 1355 of 1600 for Gore and 1206 for Bush), neither did that well in their college courses. Both earned a mix of B and C grades&hellip;.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is hard proof that the MSM has given obama an utter pass on his school records and so many other aspects of his life  &mdash;  but not for long, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also like to see obama&rsquo;s SAT and LSAT scores  &mdash;  we could easily determine if he was accepted to Columbia and Harvard on merit or it he was an AA admittee. If he weren&rsquo;t an AA admittee, he (and the MSM) would be shouting it from the moutain tops and his scores would be paraded around the country as proof of his &#8216;brilliance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I strongly suspect the MSM is sitting on the figures now and when they turn on him, as they inevitably will, his test scores, grades and all kinds of other suppressed information will come flooding out  &mdash;  his drug use, the rumors of homosexuality, his low test scores, and anything else lurking in his closet.</p>

		<p>The question is not if we should have an African-American president, the real question is should we have an African president. The question of Barach Obama&rsquo;s birth has not been settled. He may have won the vote but should he have been in the running in the first place. </p>
<p>This election could set a real precedent for having foriegn born leaders or giving up our sovereignty all togather. </p>

The Whites who voted for Barack Hussein Obama knows that in order to survive as a nation we could not elect another White man into the White House.

<p>Why do you say Obama was at the top of his class?  He has never released any of his school transcripts, theses, papers, etc.  To my knowledge, he has not one published legal paper to his name.  In the absence of any published scholarly work or release of his transcripts, I must assume his being named Editor of the Harvard Law Review   &mdash;   ordinarily a most prestigious position   &mdash;   was an AA appointment.  He&rsquo;s never impressed me as a great thinker or particularly high IQ individual&hellip;mainly a wordsmith, as many blacks are.</p>

<p>You people obviously don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like to be thoroughly cornered. Do you really think the whites in South Africa voted yes because they thought it was going to be heaven on earth under a black government?</p>
<p>Get this. YOUR government introduced sanctions against South Africa. Your Congress gave themselves a standing ovation when they passed the sanctions legislation. It was obvious that the game was up. </p>
<p>As it is South Africa teeters on the brink of disaster. How do you think this place would have looked if we fought a war with the blacks here? They outnumber us ten to one. Do you think we could kill enough of them without your government stepping in?</p>
<p>The blacks out bred the whites in South Africa, what is worse is that the same is coming your way soon. Don&rsquo;t be so smug.</p>

<p>Sheriff Lee Baca of Los Angeles County says blacks and Latinos are fighting and killing each other if they come on either&rsquo;s turf.  That doesn&rsquo;t sound like a language problem to me.</p>

<p>IN L.A., RACE KILLS &hellip;</p>
<p>&#8220;So let me be very clear about one thing: We have a serious interracial violence problem in this county involving blacks and Latinos.&#8221;<br>
By Lee Baca, June 12, 2008 </p>
<p>And it isn&rsquo;t just in his county is all over the country, but mostly in the Southwest.  I saw the other day where there was a black/Hispanic riot at a high school in Wisconsin.</p>
<p>What do you have to say about that, Black Insurgent?</p>

		<p>I expect the first hundred days of the Obama administration will decide our fate. The attempt to crush liberty will be ferocious. A nonstop all out each and every day assault. That&rsquo;s the way communists have always solidified their rule. How will whites - the only race with a passionate attachment to liberty - respond? Frankly, I don&rsquo;t know. If the response is a fatalistic, &#8220;What can we do?&#8221; we&rsquo;re doomed. If, on the other hand, the rifles come out, there&rsquo;s hope.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Phil makes a bizarre assertion that Obama isn&rsquo;t half-white. I don&rsquo;t know if this is even worth responding to, but check out these pictures of Obama with both his white and black families:&#8221;</p>
<p>I do not subscribe to the half-and-half description. I catagorize Obama as Black, as most do. Recall the &#8220;one-drop&#8221; rule. It was crafted for a reason.</p>
<p>As a side note, I&rsquo;ve seen many images of Hispanics and Mestizos posing for FBI wanted posters and criminal mugshots. Although they bear absolutely no resemblance to Europeans, they were identified as &#8220;White&#8221;. God only knows how much such misrepresentations distort the crime demographics.

		<p>I saw a biography on Obama where they interviewed his law school classmates and several of them said that it was well known in the class that he was among the top, if not the top student academically. Also, just to be on the Law Review you have to be in the top 10% of the class academically. I&rsquo;m sure being African American helped, but being named editor of the Law Review tells me he had the respect of his peers academically. I also read somewhere that he scored very high on the LSATs.   </p>
<p>I totally agree that the large majority of high profile Blacks are nothing but good orators and once you get past the rhetoric they are pretty much idiots. But in Obama&rsquo;s case I have to think they he may be the rare exception and actually be intelligent. He is half white.</p>

Thus, he will win a second term, and there will be more Obamas who are more &ldquo;authentically&rdquo; black waiting in the wings. After we&rsquo;ve been softened up for eight years, we will see even more boldness and radicalness on the part of nonwhites and will be so outnumbered as to be powerless. We will be strangers in our own land. Better to start now seeking out a new homeland and quietly and without fanfare moving there. The American I knew is lost.<br>
</i><br>
<p><br>
Yeah, I think you are basically correct. Certainly the America I grew up in is <b>gone</b> ( I am 48 ). With the election of BHO we may well be witnessing the beginning of a transition to non-white rule. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine such a thing but I can see the possibility of it. After all, to be against it would surely be proof of one being a racist and that would be enough to send most whites running for the booth to vote for non-whites. In doing so  they will be able to reassure themselves: I&rsquo;m not a racist, I&rsquo;m not a racist, I&rsquo;m not a racist&hellip;<br>

		<p>To Justanote:</p>
<p>You comments about Chinese despising Whites borders on great stupidity or great ignorance.</p>
<p>The Chinese are very friendly to White Westerners, but they certainly DO get nervous around Black Africans that are accumulating in Guangzhou, South China. </p>
<p>There are probably some Chinese that despise Whites. They are very good at projecting a nice face, but for the most part by and far here is what the reality in China is:</p>
<p>Young girls spend millions of dollars on creams to have skin like White American Girls.</p>
<p>Young girls spend millions to have brown and colored hair like White American Girls.</p>
<p>Young girls and boys love the BIG round eyed look of White American Girls and Boys.</p>
<p>ALL advertising in the mass media is of very light skinned, trying to look white Chinese and Western White models. </p>
<p>All Young boys and girls spend millions to look cool like White Girls and boys in America.</p>
<p>You want the best education in China: Go to Western White University. </p>
<p>The big move now: Western style White Weddings with VERY light skinned wedding photos, tuxedos for boys, White Western wedding dresses for the girls, etc etc..</p>
<p>Except for Hip Hop music, the under 30 crowd in China emulate White America as much as is possible with music, dress, movies, make up, hair color, hair style, Ipods, Cars, and everything else that is associated with progress and White Culture. Chinese artist are definitely not as scary as Dr. Dre, Snoop Dog, or 50cent&hellip;  </p>
<p><br>
The Chinese ARE NOT emulating traditional Chinese dress except on some special occasions and part of the weddings.</p>
<p>The Chinese ARE NOT emulating the Black African Dress that is common among lower class blacks sneaking around South China.</p>
<p>The Chinese ARE NOT emulating the matted hair look of Blacks.</p>
<p>The Chinese ARE NOT emulating the violent Hip Hop mentality of Blacks. </p>
<p><br>
The Best job ANY Chinese person will have is working for Western Global corp. with White Western Management.</p>
<p>Chinese resentment is increasing towards the West, because of the actions of Bush AND most have never seen a bad economy. And since the US economy has a cold, Asia will catch pneumonia. The Chinese are irrational and extremely emotional and this will play out in anti-Americanism and hostility to make any excuse for their problems. They cannot loose their face and accept the fact that without US business, management, expertise, and business, they cannot survive and move forward. China is NOT Japan. </p>
<p>I see more hostility to White Americans in China from bitter angry Americans and Europeans than anyone else. For the most part, the White Expats in China are politically corrected, Globalists here to polish up their resume and conform to the New World Order. And some missionaries who sneak in under the guise that they are teachers or something. </p>
<p>One last note, the Chinese are racist and make no secret that they are Chinese, different, not White, not American and unique. Their healthy racial view is something White America has lost. Even the smallest child is fully aware that he is Chinese in looks, culture, country, and thinking. </p>
<p>As a result of their increased prosperity and illusion of prosperity, they DO have a stronger sense of purpose and pride than most White Americans.</p>
<p>Despising Whites&hellip; ha ha ha ha..</p>

		<p>Nick Griffin, the chairman of the British National Party (www.bnp.org.uk), made a telling point in his closing speech at the recent BNP national conference. </p>
<p>He stated that many better-off whites accepted in private the ethno-nationalist policies of the BNP but would not support them in public or vote for them because they would then feel under an obligation to play their part in the struggle to keep Britain a modern Western society inhabited for the most part by its indigenous population. They close their eyes and leave it to others to carry on the fight.</p>

<p>  Strangely, people of color are disparate to immigrate to these very same evil and greedy white ruled countries either in Europe or the United States. Do you really think that Obama is not controlled by the privileged white elites? Look at this cabinet. It is the same old &ldquo;white&rdquo; establishment administration from the Clinton years. </p>

		<p>Al Gore&rsquo;s SAT scores as reported by the Washington Post are pure fabrication, either planted by Democrat operatives or invented by the Post itself. The man is clearly a slack-jawed dolt who would be described by psychologists as &#8220;dull normal.&#8221; His half-lidded smile, mouth agape, exudes stupidity and witlessness.</p>
<p>He is a testament to the wisdom of the Founders, who recognized that the powers of the federal government must be limited and specifically enumerated, not because the political class would necessarily be evil (they usually are) but that politics all too often attracts the dregs of the nation.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;He is not half white. He is black. It has to do with dominant vs. recessive genes&rdquo;<br>
Genetics for skin color is not the same as for eye color<br>
Eye - two genes, one dominant, one recessive<br>
Skin - eight genes. 64 possible combinations. They work in combination rather than dominant/recessive. Obama is darker than the average American mulatto because most American blacks have white genes. Also, Obama, Sr. was exceptionally dark - ink black or jet black.</p>

<p>Eye Color: Eye color is an inherited trait influenced by more than one gene.</p>
<p>Blue eyes with a brown spot, green eyes and gray eyes are caused by an entirely different part of the genome. As Eiberg said: &#8220;The SNP rs12913832 [of theHerc2 gene] is found to be associated with the brown and blue eye color, but this single DNA variation cannot explain all the brown eye color variation from dark brown over hazel to blue eyes with brown spots&#8221;.</p>

<p>Yes, I and other Whites can&rsquo;t wait until the US turns into SA, Zim or any other shining example of failed black rule. Can you point to one successful, peaceful, prosperous black-ruled country that we should emulate? How about a city that owes its success to black-style government  &mdash;  maybe Detroit or New Orleans could be held up as examples where Whites would want to live (hell, even blacks don&rsquo;t want to live in Detroit). </p>
<p>The fact is, from decades of evidence, that blacks cannot form peaceful working countries, cities or neighborhoods.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;White&rsquo;s (sic) are despised in every corner of the world, even CHINA&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Not as much as blacks  &mdash;  China forced out its few black students after they started raping the local girls.</p>
<p>That must be why Chinese have been flocking to the US for generations (gee, maybe to escape the Communists?)  &mdash;  actually, they&rsquo;re flocking to Africa too  &mdash;  to exploit the natural resources there, not because they&rsquo;re desirous of black rule.  Wonder why they&rsquo;re building entire colonies in Africa that are ringed with fortified walls and protected by 24-hour guards? They have plans to transport billions of their people into Africa  &mdash;  and not for the reasons the government schools taught you, i.e., to experience &#8216;wonderful diversity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Those fortified colonies couldn&rsquo;t be to protect the Chinese from the violence and mayhem Africans are so fond of, could it?</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Every nation of color has difficulty with White rule, nations of color do not even want free assistance from White nations. This is why you see rulers of every nation clamouring for Obama&rsquo;s attention&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nonsense, nonsense nonsense.</p>
<p>Failed nations of color, particularly in Africa, have received BILLIONS of dollars of assistance from the West  &mdash;  the US in particular.  We have &#8216;donated&rsquo; money, food, medicine, technology  &mdash;  NONE of which was invented or created in &#8216;nations of color.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Obviously, all that money has brought Africans up to Western standards, as was intended.</p>
<p>Can you provide a link showing ANY African or &#8216;nation of color&rsquo; that has refused White money?</p>
<p>The Third World is clamoring for obama because he has promised to open up the monetary floodgates and pour even MORE worthless money into failed &#8216;nations of color.&rsquo;  He&rsquo;ll either fire-hose it in or drop it from helicopters  &mdash;  freshly printed from US printing presses, that is, backed by NOTHING.</p>
<p>Do you think maybe this time those billions of dollars  will work?  All that money will &#8216;lift Africa up&rsquo; and out of the stone age? After all, obama is The Messiah, a &#8216;citizen of the world&rsquo; who will bring peace and prosperity to all corners of the earth  &mdash;  he told us so during his campaign.  Do you think he&rsquo;ll deliver?</p>
<p>Would that any African  &mdash;  or any other failed nation refuse our help. </p>

		<p>I have noticed a certain wooden-headedness among Whites.</p>
<p>The Shawnee Indians would lure the Whites into ambushes by sending out a small party of warriors which would engage the Whites. The Indians would retreat, and the Whites would ALWAYS follow them into a devastating ambush, even when experienced frontiersmen warned them about what was happening.</p>
<p>THE AMBUSH TACTIC ALWAYS WORKED! </p>
<p>This right-brain creative tactic worked EVERY TIME, among different groups of Whites and different tribes of Indians. </p>
<p>Even TODAY the Whites that are more right-brained, intuitive, creative, etc. are rejected by the more Anglo-Saxon variety of Whites. Rejected, hell, they are persecuted! They end up living in the shadow world of geekdom, gothdom, etc. </p>
<p>The frontiersmen, like Simon Kenton and Daniel Boone, were not the left-brain, right-angle, straight-up-and-down Anglo-Saxon breed of Whites. They were mostly Celtic types. They were both later cheated out of much of their property by other Whites.</p>
<p>We know how the Anglo-Saxon British treated the Scots and the Irish! </p>
<p>White dudes  &mdash;  love your race! Stop the superiority ego-trips! Pride before the fall, everlastingly so!</p>

Cicio&rsquo;s comment made a valid point.  But RTP&rsquo;s retort made a  far better one.</p>
<p>In other words, Mother Nature is ruthless in her eternal culling of the herd  and doesn&rsquo;t care  a whit about our comfort.  She cares only  about survival of the fittest, the toughest &hellip;. AND the most fertile.</p>
<p>Like it or not, when you&rsquo;re up against the wall (as we are, tho many don&rsquo;t realize it),  you can&rsquo;t expect to survive and have your comforts too. Unfortunatly, many soft and spoiled  white people would rather preserve their comforts than preserve their race.  It&rsquo;s goodbye to them.</p>
<p>As the Bible tells us; &#8220;The poor shall inherit the earth.&#8221;  It could just as well say, &#8220;The fertile&hellip;&#8221;.   Same thing.</p>
<p>No sensible person wants to have a competition for numerical supremacy  &mdash;   ending, inevitably, in a Malthusian solution.  But that&rsquo;s what it comes down to   &mdash;    unless you curb your opponents&rsquo; numbers.  Forget about curbing your own, which is suicide   &mdash;   albeit comfortable  suicide.  You must either increase your own numbers, or lessen theirs.  Which will it be?</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t find a way to curb their numbers and contain their population, and preserve your own territory, they will overwhelm you. They are doing exactly  that right  now.  We are seeing it happening.  And what we see is just the beginning.  </p>
<p>The subject of reproductive rights is one of the most tabooed of topics. Some religious groups are obsessed with anything having to do with reproduction.  Generally,even the most oppressive dictatorships have hesitated to touch the topic (excepting China).   Thus, we had the spectacle of GW Bush - in his first term - scolding China about it&rsquo;s one child policy, and offering to take in all of China&rsquo;s surplus!   But unless we are willing to step outside the traditional box and do some original thinking about population control, we will become  the victims of our own  reluctance to address it. Even if they&rsquo;re religious scruples.</p>
<p>As I said above, Mother Nature  [&#8220;red in tooth and claw&#8221;] doesn&rsquo;t care about rights, she only cares about results.  </p>

<p>You are the one that needs to &#8220;Wake up!&#8221;  White rule has brought freedom and prosperity to many parts of the world for many non-whites.  The Japanese and Chinese have far more respect for us that any African - or African American - that walks the planet.  Greed is colorblind and I am sure you will find many non-whites that are greedy.  If you don&rsquo;t wish to take the rap for black murderers and rapists, don&rsquo;t expect any innocent white person to take the rap for our own garbage.  We have done great things and will continue to do great things.  We are copied around the world.  It is the communist instigators that cause us trouble and yes, they are white!  Most of &#8220;our&#8221; problems arise when we import other races.</p>
<p>By the way, there is no such thing as white supremacy.  It is a fallacy that makes crazy whites and non-whites feel good about themselves.<br>

<p>Until Obama releases his transcripts, LSAT and SAT scores, papers, etc., I won&rsquo;t put much stock in quotes from people who went to school with him.  There&rsquo;s a very good chance that they&rsquo;re no less fawning than the media.  Somehow the media were able to get their hands on Gore&rsquo;s, Kerry&rsquo;s, and Bush&rsquo;s SAT scores, IQ tests, and transcripts.  Why no similar effort or &#8220;transparency&#8221; to produce &#8220;The One&rsquo;s&#8221; records so we can all see for ourselves?  My assumption, in the absence of such information, is that it isn&rsquo;t all that flattering and would dispell the myth of his being such a brilliant thinker and student.  Otherwise, it would have been used to convince skeptics such as me, especially before the election.<br>

		<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m sure being African American helped, but being named editor of the Law Review tells me he had the respect of his peers academically. I also read somewhere that he scored very high on the LSATs.&#8221;  Posted by jayfresh at 12:21 AM on November 17</p>
<p>Not so, guy.  Reporting high LSAT&rsquo;s by the MSM on this man means absolutely nothing.  They don&rsquo;t have access to any of his grades anyway.  Nothing has been provided.  And it is now proven unequivocally by WND&rsquo;s Jack Cashill, and six other experts, that a good portion of Obama&rsquo;s book was OBVIOUSLY written by William Ayers.  Like the LSAT scores the MSM reported as being superior even though they don&rsquo;t know what they are, Obama was described by Newsweek as being the most prolific writer of any pres. candidate ever.  Such lies.  Such an absolute liar.</p>
<p>A black that can articulate in phraseology beyond the normal black gets a knee jerk reaction from whites about being &#8220;intelligent&#8221; so often it&rsquo;s meaningless, because it&rsquo;s later obvious that his expertise just doesn&rsquo;t seem to have any depth at all. There are several blacks who could be considered competent writers, but none that I&rsquo;ve ever read would be anything exceptional compared to other races, and that would include Thomas Sowell.   These college students especially would be easily impressed and would want to reveal their &#8220;unbiased&#8221; attitudes by voting for Obama.</p>
<p>If he&rsquo;s nothing but an empty suit, why doesn&rsquo;t he release his records?  Wouldn&rsquo;t you release yours to the public if they were above average?  I would.  I think anybody would, but a person who isn&rsquo;t too proud of them, because they&rsquo;re either average or substandard.  Yet he refuses to allow ANYTHING to be released regarding anything academically, and he&rsquo;s the only &#8220;editor&#8221; who has never written anything.</p>
<p>To be sure, Obama is above the average black, and he IS a likeable sort, but I think he&rsquo;s a liar like many of them who come across the same way with a likeable personality, but oh how they reveal their flaws when they&rsquo;re heavily challenged.  (We get one on this site every once in a while.) </p>
<p>&#8220;I totally agree that the large majority of high profile Blacks are nothing but good orators and once you get past the rhetoric they are pretty much idiots. But in Obama&rsquo;s case I have to think they he may be the rare exception and actually be intelligent. He is half white.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, he is half white, and he was raised white by white grandparents, and it is those factors that make him a substantial cut above the average black.  Next to an 85 I.Q. black he appears a genius.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my belief, however, that almost anybody with even average intelligence and a good education can do the job as president and many cabinet positions.  Each has so many advisors they really don&rsquo;t have to be exceptional.  That&rsquo;s been revealed to us many times in recent history many times over.</p>

<p>I have posted similarly regarding the above author&rsquo;s statements. <br>
In the end it will be the same cultural battles between the old colonial powers, which in the end may still work out better for European civilization. <br>
One can see that it is the Anglo culture of USA and Canada that is sickly, and perhaps soon to become extinct. Francophones are very culturally aware and are often on the brink of separation in Quebec. While the Latins of South and Central America are racially aware and have very deeply ingrained ethnic traditions. <br>
Anglo&rsquo;s are duped into self-loathing and guilt, and abiding into an absurd and unprecedented ideology of appeasement, compromise, and pacifism. <br>
When the Oliving affect takes its course, and the Anglos become extinct, or assimilated, it will be the black&rsquo;s, believe it or not, who will mourn the most. Olive skinned peoples, whether Latin or otherwise, would never tolerate the black abuse and terror which the Anglos have in the last 50 years (yet the Spanish were also slavers!). Under Latin rule it is not unforeseeable to see the deportation or ethnic cleansing of blacks from this continent (or at least sanctioned seperation). <br>
What the above poster said is completely correct&hellip;one need only visit any country in Latin America to see the difference; and Latino revulsion toward black behavior. Quite frankly, compared to this PC nightmare of feral thugs, white bashing in all mediums, and the destrucion of our cities, Latinization may not be so bad.       </p>

<p>Another naive and desperate black person holidng on to a notion of a &#8216;colored coalition&rsquo;. <br>
Blacks of his ilk, which is most, have been attempting to find a common ground amongst Latins, Middle Easterners, and even Mediterraneans, in a shared hate of anything Anglo - i.e. &#8216;blue-eyed etc.  What he foolishly cannot comprehend is that these other &#8216;tanned/olive&rsquo; people&rsquo;s despise blacks far more than the ruling Anglo&rsquo;s. <br>
For one, these &#8220;non-WASPs&#8221; immigrated here from places like Latin America, Sicily, Portugal, Greece, Lebanon, Syria etc for upward mobility, and generally see any sort of association with black culture and it&rsquo;s feral by-products as a regression. <br>
We wish to protect our families and property from black violence and ignorance perhaps more so than the &#8220;WASPs&#8221;, who have been handcuffed so ruthlessly by the left. <br>

<p>Reading the above post caused me to remember something that I hadn&rsquo;t thought of in years. I am a bit ashamed of myself now for being so naïve and buying into the anti-apartheid propaganda that was so prevalent here in the U.S.<br>
At the time Mandela was running for office, I was still a young brainwashed liberal.  When Mandela was touring the U.S, he visited in Chicago and spoke; I think it was at the operation PUSH HQ.  I actually attended this event white male friend.  Jessie Jackson spoke and urged the audience to donate to Mandela; people were throwing money at the man.  It was really interesting watching this man in action; he is a very talented at manipulating his own people into giving up their money.  At least I wasn&rsquo;t foolish enough to give up any cash.<br>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t read the comments yet, but I tend to agree with you.</p>
<p>Obama appears to be firmly in the grip of the same crowd Dubya was in the grip of. Call them Neolibs now instead of Neocons if you wish, but they&rsquo;re the same crowd. The banksters and their associates who support war in the mideast on behalf of our ally there, and on behalf of other interests.</p>
<p>The plundering of our country will continue in pretty much the same vein it&rsquo;s been proceeding.</p>
<p>The racial situation will be a mess. But the sooner that gets worse, the better perhaps. So that, unlike S. Africa, we wake up while we still have the numbers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always found Jared&rsquo;s writing excellent, but  I don&rsquo;t understand his not mentioning the important difference of numbers between the U.S. and S. African white populations relative to each country&rsquo;s black population.</p>

<p>Of course as I suggested in the past, Obama will initially appoint many whites to various positions including his &#8220;Chief of Staff&#8221; isn&rsquo;t he also one of the culprits of the Fannie-Freddie fiasco?? pretty high up in one of them I think. But!! within a short period from 6 months to not more than a year, those previously appointed whites will, for some PERSONAL reasons leave their positions and blacks will slowly take over. 60 blacks appointed all at once would cause quite a furor, but one at a time, will likely not draw to much attention. As Sgt. York in the personna of Gary Cooper pointed out, start shooting the ducks from the last in line and the others never notice the assault.</p>

		<p> saw a biography on Obama where they interviewed his law school classmates and several of them said that it was well known in the class that he was among the top, if not the top student academically.&#8221;</p>
<p>  odd. This campaign was so run by Obamabots and paid rally-attenders (I happen to know that), that I wouldn&rsquo;t be suprised if they didn&rsquo;t round up a few alumni who remembered him or not, and paid them. If he was so brilliant, he&rsquo;d have written something, left some sort of legacy. Even JFK wrote &#8220;Why England Slept&#8221; during his grad student days. <br>
   A third part VP whose name escapes me, went to Columbia at the time Obama was supposed to have been there, about 1981-83. He did not remember him although they would certainly have been taking some of the same classes. Not only that, but nobody else he knew from the Columbia days recalled Obama. Finally, one person sort of remembered him.<br>
   There is absolutely no reason to think BO is &#8220;brilliant.&#8221; His academic records, like his birth records, are sealed for a good reason.</p>

That&rsquo;s assuming that he&rsquo;s the one in charge.  But if he&rsquo;s a puppet and a frontman, as all of our recent presidents have been (and there&rsquo;s no reason to think that this one will be different), then that&rsquo;s not likely to happen.  Those who pull his strings and control him from behind the curtain are the ones really in charge, and they WON&rsquo;T LET it happen. Things will go according to the way THEY want. They didn&rsquo;t spend hundreds of millions of dollars to get him into office for him to go berserk and do as he pleases.</p>
<p>Also, all of those sealed and inaccessible records of his suggest there&rsquo;s something to hide. Those who pull his strings will be able to use any unfavorable information as a form of blackmail to keep him in line, if he starts to get too full of himself.  After all, when you come right down to it, they don&rsquo;t want a president who&rsquo;s too squeaky clean. If he didn&rsquo;t have some skeletons hidden in his closet, how else would they be able to control him?  A saint in the White House is not what they want.</p>
<p>If he did get too independent, some pretext would be found, the press would turn on him overnight, and he&rsquo;d be out in a flash - just like Nixon.</p>

     Obviously, though they&rsquo;ve all seemed to have clammed up, a lot of people have had access to his various test scores.  If this reported IQ of 124 is accurate, that would make him a sharp guy, but not what anyone would call brilliant.  Off the top of my head, I&rsquo;d say that maybe 8 or 9 percent of Whites have equal or higher intelligence.  Of course, being four standard deviations above his racial average, he is smarter than 99 percent of Blacks.   Compared to what everyone has experienced from Blacks, perhaps he seems brilliant.  </p>

		<p>The election of Barack Obama is not the beginning of a transition to &#8220;black rule.&#8221;  It was simply America voting for Obama&rsquo;s vision of our future over those of a very old man and a woman who knows less about history and geography than most college students.  How did Obama rise so far so fast?  In large part it was because of how horribly the country has been run during the last eight years, and that Obama&rsquo;s mentality is seen as the exact opposite of that of Bush 43.  And how did W get elected?  From whites.  And if whites elect  &mdash;  and re-elect  &mdash;  a dullard of such incompetence, what does that say about whites?  It certainly calls into question our credibility. </p>
<p>And the greatest threat to the Republic is not non-white rule.  Our downfall will be the result of our national debt and trade imbalance that will eventually bankrupt us.  Are you going to try to blame that on Blacks and Hispanics?  And don&rsquo;t blame the Dumbocrats; Reagan and Bush caused most of our debt; Clinton actually balanced the budget once or twice. </p>
<p>Btw, Obama will be one of the few blacks (12-15% is my guess) in his administration, so those calling that &ldquo;black rule&rdquo; look like paranoid freaks that deserve the marginalization they endure.  Perhaps they should fight a real fight, like reducing illegal immigration, which has broad public support.</p>
<p>What troubles me is that more Americans believe in creationism than evolution.  If that many people think Earth is less than 6,000 years old, then what hope is there that we are capable of making wise decisions?  America is a democracy; we get the government we deserve.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Am I the only one aware of the fact that that the continental U.S. has as its second largest population natives of south and central america? That an inability to speak spanish is pretty much an inability to find gainful employment in this country? How about that &lsquo;hispanics&rsquo; manage to ethnically cleanse any neighborhood they move into of all blacks, while happily allowing asians and whites to remain, especially if they make an effort to learn hispanic culture and spanish language? Marrying up (racially) is a deeply respected tradition and whites are given preferential treatment for positions of authority. Look at some spanish language soap operas (tellingly easy to do in the states) to see this in action. I am an Argentine expat living in your country.  White america, relax, enjoy the ride. You&rsquo;ll enjoy the latin system much better than the anglo one you&rsquo;ve been suffering under, and do better.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m French-Polish and Catholic.  I don&rsquo;t consider myself an Anglo.  I have also observed the influx of Latinos into this country.  I do believe, with our corrupt officials and corporate interests that the border will never be sealed and they will all be amnestied sooner rather than later.  My problem is that I would have preferred if the tide rolled in a bit slower enabling white Americans to adjust and adapt rather than face the prospect of being treated like a foreigner in the land of your birth.  That is what I see happening very quickly.  How long after Latinos are the majority will we see Spanish as the official language of the United States? I think it will happen at the end of my lifetime. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the down side to all this.  The positive side to all this is that I agree with this poster that the whites who can and do adapt will do very well in a Hispanic culture.  Latinos and mestizos are far more inclusive of whites than vice versa.  Any white who puts themselves out to assimilate in any way with their culture is treated very well by them.  I saw this bear out at work.  I worked with a lot of Hispanics and there was a white woman who spoke fluent Spanish there.  They called her La Reyna and were very cordial with her.  </p>
<p>I look at Latin American countries and I see the &#8220;mestizos&#8221; in charge of these places looking very European.  That&rsquo;s why I encourage any racially aware white not just to put their kids in private school or home school them, but to also get their children fluent in Spanish.  I honestly believe the Anglo culture has been used to undermine the white race while many whites would only thrive in such a culture.<br>

		<p>I personally think most of your major concerns are irrelevant or mutte. But i can&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;d relate the South African uprising to this. Your worried about black people taking over, but how many black senators are there? Just Barack. I think your underestimating the American pubic. Barack was simply voted in because answered questions with clarity and didn&rsquo;t dodge that i saw (most likely &#8220;as much&#8221;).</p>
<p>I voted for Barack mainly because im anti-war. (Im guessing you are not, so i will qualify that by saying I simply believe that I would be personally capable of stopping war with pre-emptive words, so I therefore must, as a responsible human being, be for peace when it possible, as i believe it is) The situation in South Africa seems inevitable. South Africa was made a democracy and there are more blacks than whites in South Africa&hellip;. end of story? </p>

		<p>@Clymennestra: Not a bad plan. The WASPs only meddle and cause problems for other whites. </p>
<p>I come from a family that adopted an Anglo name to avoid certain sorts of trouble, and we can just as easily adopt a Hispanic one to avoid something that is starting to look like it just might evolve into a modern version of the penal laws, this one targeted at non-Hispanic whites. </p>
<p>So, either the WASPs stick up for themselves, or at least STOP meddling with the affairs of other white communities, or they will find those whites abandoning their language, their laws, and their traditions for one which does NOT tell them where to send their children to school or how to organize their communities. </p>

That deposition took place during the age of Darwinism and has left a huge emotional void in many a Leftist&rsquo;s heart.<br>
 But perhaps I misjudge. Sometimes I think the Euros give Obama hurrahs because they secretly want the USA to crash and burn and they see him as the pilot incompetent enough to do it. <br>
 Anyway I see real problems ahead for Obama as he attempts to negotiate a course of government between the very hard rocks of a military/intelligence establishment that doesn&rsquo;t trust him and the sand bar of an economy that is not going to respond to his goofy New Deal era thinking.</p>

		<p>Most white Americans have one or two children and a great many are waiting until there late 30s or early 40s to have their first child. (An entire generation was not born)  Many chose not to have children. Hispanics, Blacks, and Muslims have large families beginning at an early age. It is no secret why the white population will be a minority very soon. That would not be a bad thing if all Americans, regardless of race, were working, income earning, conservative, patriotic Americans. That is not the case. Welfare recipients, government workers, union members, illegal aliens and community organizers (who receive un proportionate amounts of tax payers money) normally vote for the democrats who are rapidly turning our country into a socialist nation.</p>

<p>I have an answer to your question.  We are not the smartest and the most superior people on earth.  Hell, we are not the most organized either.  Even if we were a white nation, we would still find something to fight about.  Look at the Balkans, they are all white and look alike to me, but yet they have been fighting for hundreds of years.  Whites are just like every other human race on earth.  We just have been more aggressive in the past.  But we have changed as a people and we longer wish to rule over other people.  All the other white countries in the world are going through the same process of become a multicultural nation.  I guess our time is up and we just need to go with the flow.<br>

		<p>It is only by the most charitable stretch of the English language that McCain and Palin could be considered &#8220;White&#8221; candidates. There, as always, the interest was in the furtherance of the New World Order agenda, the impoverishment and further dispossession and disenfranchisemnt of White people, and the further erosion of our remaining White country&rsquo;s sovereignty into a World Government combining the worst features of socialism and &#8220;capitalism&#8221; for the benefit of a criminal corporate/media/political elite of renegade Whites.</p>
<p>Brother &#8216;Bama will do the same job for the same kind of people more easily and visibly. At least we will see who our adversaries are more clearly for the next four years!</p>
<p>In addition to getting our messages out regarding our dispossession (and prelude to our racial extermination?) we will have to find ways to evolve a new direction and meaning to our politics. Ron Paul&rsquo;s Campaign for Liberty might be one way, local groups like Council for Conservative Citizens may be another, and there might be other groups where we will learn to vote for and organize for our own interests, like nonwhites have been doing. They have been doing it with the assistance and approval of the NWO elites, whereas we will be encountering their formidable political opposition, but this can&rsquo;t be avoided.</p>

		<p>We have reached a stage in our Civilisation which is historically, the Decadent Phase.  Highly educated, a strong academic class and lots of expendable wealth, spoiled children.</p>
<p>Contrast this, if you will, to the picture of North America at its inception.  People struggling think less about birth control and see their Survival more in terms of having offspring.  It certainly Appears that the more unlikely one&rsquo;s survival, the more the drive is to spawn (very primal) - starving, diseased Africa has a high birth rate, which is why the problem of poverty there never goes away.  It also explains why more people are born in the Poorer end of any society, including that of &#8216;White America&rsquo;.  The Middle Classes are also more self-involved as regards their education and careers etc; and see themselves as an end themselves rather than their offspring as potential saviours (financial or otherwise).  Getting rid of Welfare in North America would just create a plethora of starving diseased, distressed poor as in Africa who be more than ever willing to Brutalise the resources which they have no access to (Current situ in South Africa, a perfect illustration).  The Credit crisis / poverty horizon maybe the best Solution to this depopulation/decadent Doldrum that all Europeans increasingly find themselves in..</p>

		<p>Yes Zac, you are right.  The rank and file in North America<br>

they must demonstrate a white guilt.  Actually they haven&rsquo;t<br>

never really clear to Joe 6 Pack who dimpled the chads<br>

		<p>Obama won because he was the selection of the Lobbyists who control both major parties. They selected Obama as easier to control. The candidates who might have run and if elected, been effective in dealing with economic crisis the U.S. now faces, saw the task as too daunting.  U.S. business lobbyists, through the members of Congress it controls, had market regulation reduced. This set the stage for the sub-prime crisis, and the subsequent deleveraging of our institutions.  As these forces continue, the inevitable result of the government&rsquo;s printing of money to solve the problem  will create the final U.S. catastrophe: rampant inflation which will produce for the United States the same results as it already has for Zimbabwe. The United States is over. And it is not its leaders who are to blame. It is ours - we believe them and vote for them. </p>

		<p>Obama was elected because decades ago Neo Marxists took control of the nations educational and media institutions. Control ideas, control the nation. Or, as Adolf Hitler said, &#8220;We may not have you, but we will have your children&#8221;. <br>
America has changed because the average citizen&rsquo;s ideas about it have been molded and shaped by a subtle form of psychological warfare. Every year, tens of millions of new, brainwashed, newly minted Neo Marxist young adults stream out of the government schools. Every day, tens of millions get their news from mass media that functions only as mass brainwashing tools. <br>
Unless the remnant of real Americans refuses to hand the brains of it&rsquo;s children over to the machine&hellip;the process will soon be irreversible. </p>

Excellent post by Paul.</p>
<p>This is precisely what has happened. Never underestimate the power of propaganda, especially decades-long propaganda.</p>
<p>I am certain now that what has been done to our nation can not be undone by voting and demonstrating. Period.</p>
<p>It is now time to work toward independence. We need our own country, and our own government. Technically our government has already gone astray from its constitutional obligations to the people in many ways. For example, every time a gov&rsquo;t official works against the best interests of the people (meaning specifically the citizens)to grant rights or benefits to illegals, they have betrayed their oath of office. </p>
<p>The constitution states that if and when &#8220;the people&#8221; (meaning specifically citizens) feel that their government has grown to function against their best interest, they have the right to dissolve that government and form a new one. </p>
<p>But our government has gotten out of control. It has become a self-serving monster that will not honor that part of the constitution. In fact any efforts by citizens to force adherence to this end are likely to find themselves ignored at best, and in prison at worst.</p>
<p>A famous quote comes to mind: &#8220;When the government fears the people, there is liberty. When the people fear the government, there is tyranny.&#8221; Our government today certainly doesn&rsquo;t fear the people.</p>

<p>Hmm, then he must be saying that there was something wrong with MLK, because it&rsquo;s his dream I&rsquo;m following.  I&rsquo;m treating Obama the same way I&rsquo;d treat a new white president; no respect, no praising, no nothing until he shows me what he&rsquo;s got.  </p>

		<p>Another saying about fear- Fear is the only thing to fear.<br>
For most Americans - white, brown, black, yello, red, etc, etc.-including myself- saw the election of Obama as a continued step forward in the acceptance of diversity for the good old USA. This is a strength of the USA which Obama will show any race doubters that any conpetent leader of any religion, race, creed etc. can lead the USA successfully and for the interest of the whole country.</p>

		<p>No wonder you have blacks in power in our debauched nation.<br>
It is a typical sign of the the degradation and decadence by the new white americans.  It is still early days to see the rest. It is question of time. The worse is still to come. <br>
Analysis: Not a single nation including third world ones other than africans ever has a black as their leader. They would be ashamed of it anyway because &#8216;they&rsquo; have the sense of shame, totally lacking in the US.<br>
By promoting decadence and homosexuality they are insuring the new generation of depraved and degenerate mob are the ones to determine their future, and the obama factor is a confirmation of it. The price they will pay will be very high and they deserve it.</p>
<p>The future is very grim for the USA in the long term.</p>

		<p>There is a group trying to destroy this country period. One is the illegal immigration that nobody in the Congress Senate and entire gov wants to do something. 12 mil illegals is an invasion of an invisible army, 2ND we have an president elected by mostly uneducated people and usurpers, left wing that hate this country as hell Millions of people wander if Mr Obama is a real American and Christian too. No birth certificate no education to prove. When US attack Serbia I said in my mind this is the end of US, &#8220;What goes around comes around&#8221;. If you dig somebody grave you may fell in and&hellip; here we are Billions of dollars disappear over night. The economy is on brink of destruction, the jobs are out of this country, sold overseas to China, to a communist country and 12 mil of illegals right here. One day they will go even after those giving them the amnesty. Wait and you will see it.</p>

		<p>Black rule?  Mayor Nagin - New Orleans - Katrina.  After Katrina and Nagin has safely established himself and his family in a newly purchased home in Texas he comments, he wants a chocolate city.  New Orleans had been a &#8220;chocolate&#8221; city for sometime - one only has to mark when New Orleans voters placed blacks in the governement to follow it&rsquo;s subsequent economic and physical decline.  <br>
In response to another comment - I lived in Michigan for a while and most of the citizens in the town I lived had never seen a black person - except on television!  I grew up in the South and I fully understand the hatred the black race has for caucasians and most other races.  Yes, it is absolutely true - we can get along and help each other, play sports together, work together, attend schools together.  At the end of the day if there is a black individual running for office or another individual of another race running the black population will vote their color - everytime.  <br>
In speaking to an educated black person I have known for many years he explained it this way - &#8220;I am a registered Republican and I voted for Bush.  You have to understand, I HAD to vote for Obama.&#8221;  I do not consider myself racist, but we must understand the way of others - if we do not see it clearly and candidly we will lose our way of live and freedoms.</p>

<p>^^^<br>
That&rsquo;s not true - It was the African Roman Emperors who stopped the near collapse of the Roman Empire in the early 3rd century AD. </p>
<p>It was the White emperors who brought it to that state - again leadership depends on the person really not their race.   &mdash;   Because Bush was white, so was Phillip II and while I do not have to tell you about the former the latter destroyed the Spanish Empire by himself.  </p>
<p><br>
As for a black president After Bush do you really think I care? - Really?</p>
<p>Bush literally turned the U.S from the most powerful and benevolent nation the world had ever seen to a damn near collapse of the whole thing.</p>
<p>The Taliban have started backing down, Russia has backed off militarily and our economy is SLOWLY recovering and not collapsing left and right like the European states. </p>
<p>So far Obama has proven himself FAR FAR more competent than Bush.</p>
<p>Last time I checked every nation in Europe is run by a white guy and Europe is finished, riots all of the time and nations like Latvia and Hungary totally bankrupt with the Ukraine soon to follow.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather have a black President and have food on my table than a white one and starve. </p>

		<p>Well its easy to see that all the countries with whites have prospered and all the countries of color have sucked hind tit.<br>
No one can argue with that. The real problem here is Obama is half white and was raised in a white family so he has values and is pretty smart and will probably do a great job, which will lead to more non whites being voted into power, then were really screwed. <br>
 Now, to regain control we have to ask how did we get to the top to begin with? Well we had to use force. Starting with the Neandrathauls and finally the Indains. <br>
It was nothing personal, just a matter of survival. </p>
<p>We really do try to get along, but all the other races have hatred for us because our women are hotter and we work to build things, and invent cool things that make life easier and more enjoyable, so they want, what we have, and in the course of history when they become hostile, unfortunatly, we had to take them out.<br>
This will happen again Im afraid, but when they do become hostile towards us, it will be a much tougher fight. <br>
We will be outnumbered, therefore if its going to happen, it would be better if it happened sooner rather than later.<br>
 Let me be clear, Im not trying to start a race war!<br>
I just believe it will eventually happen by way of nature.<br>
 Look at prisons. The races ban together because they cannot coexist in that tight of an area, its our nature. As we run out of room it will become more difficult to get along. <br>
 At the current pace it will probably take another 100 years, and by then most white people will have conformed, maybe all old text and films will have been destroyed, perhaps a movement to erase our heritage will have already begun. The govt and most positions of authority will be held by non whites. <br>
 The remaining proud white people mostly from Christian families, will be so sick of the crime, the economy, and the country being in total ruins, that they will finally rise up and demand a new govt. <br>
This will provoke the hostile actions towards us, I spoke of earlier.<br>
 The future existance of our race, in this country, will depend greatly on the other whites, the great great grand children of those being raised today, who idolize non whites, wish they werent white and hope their children arent white, will they fight or run? I hope they fight but i think theyll run.</p>
<p>So I plan to get things started now! By voting in every non white running for any office. Thats right!<br>
Vote em in! The sooner they take over, the sooner they destroy the country and the sooner we can take America back! </p>
<p>It sounds crazy but it really is going to happen anyway, we have fewer kids and were the minority, its simple mathmatics, they vote down racial lines so its just a matter of time, only now we have better numbers. Think about it. If everyone in Govt. were non white right now, Im talking police chiefs, mayors, city councils everything  if we give up all control and say lets see what you can do, it would only take 7 or 8 years. Welfare would go way up, taxes would go way up, reperations would become law, fewer business, fewer jobs, corruption galore, this would cause many white people to quite working for the man and just work for cash, which would provoke the hostile actions against us I spoke of earlier and there ya go.   </p>

They Killed the farmers family and all their pets, and took his farm! Obama has his thugs too they are called acorn and la rassa. When the blacks don&rsquo;t get there way acorn and la rassa protest in the streets and create riots to make the white government rulers to change their minds. Like to make hanging a rope from a tree as a hate crime. But when a black kills white people it is not called a hate crime. When it should be a hate crime.  </p>
