<h1><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-11-18-court-interpreters_N.htm">Shortage of Court Interpreters Worsening in U.S.</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mait√© Jullian, USA Today, November 18, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An existing shortage of certified court interpreters is worsening, court officials say, as law enforcement agencies step up actions against illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>Arrests leading to federal prosecutions and deportations reached record levels in fiscal year 2008, according to an October report by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p>
<p>Wanda Romberger, manager of court interpreting services at the National Center for State Courts, says that almost every state is being confronted with a lack of certified interpreters &mdash; who have to pass difficult exams &mdash; especially in languages other than Spanish.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The association did not estimate how many more interpreters are needed, but according to a 2007 report by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, there was a 17% increase in the number of events requiring interpreters in 115 languages in federal courts from October 2006 to September 2007.</p>
<p>Framer says that several cases have been reversed because of poor interpretation. Parastoo Zahedi, a Virginia-based immigration lawyer says she &#8220;repeatedly had to reschedule cases because there was no interpreter.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>However, he says, it can be difficult to find interpreters in some languages. Carelli also says that &#8220;finding interpreters for certain indigenous dialects from Central and South American countries has presented problems.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Certified interpreters have to pass exams, either through a state certification program, the Administrative Office or the Consortium for State Court Interpreter Certification, Framer says.</p>
<p>They are trained in the use of the specific court terms and protocols, Kern says. Courts also use qualified interpreters &mdash; non-credentialed but with experience &mdash; but there are not enough of them either, Framer says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Administrative Office spends $11 million a year in interpreting services, Carelli says, including travel expenses.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the Administrative Office of U.S. Courts, a federal certified or qualified court interpreter is paid $376 a day. Others are paid $181.</p>

		<p>The judge or prosecutor should use that old Gestapo trick showcased in &#8220;The Great Escape.&#8221; Actually, they should use its exact inverse. If the defendant feigns not understanding, someone in authority should reccomend locking them up until they can &#8220;find&#8221; an interpreter, mentioning out loud the Backlog is 18 to 24 months. That should clear up about 85-95% of the cases without further ado.</p>

that&rsquo;s really good money isn&rsquo;t it.<br>

It is similar here in Australia, my last office job was working for one of the countries largest utility companies which of course provides essential services.<br>
The average profit margin per residential customer I was told was between $30-$50 per year (not much).<br>
And to use our interpretering service cost our company $70 per hour. <br>
And the interpreter call would often take at least half an hour (which reflected badly on myself as a operator),as time is money and everything was judged on volume, not quality.<br>
The interpreters were often second generation immigrants (the kids) and the service would transfer myself, the non-english speaking customer to the interpreters cell phone where they may be a train platform etc. It was easy money for them.<br>
These customers had often been here since the 1950&rsquo;s(in the case of Greek and Italian post war immigrants) and somehow survived here having never learned English through children, grandchildren and knowing full well that we&rsquo;d have a interpreter service to cater for them (I could tell that they would &#8216;chat&rsquo; and laugh together at our companies expense).<br>
From the companies point of view it was actually in our interest to lose these customers to a competitor because we were in essence paying for the priviledge of servicing them. <br>

		<p>I interviewed for an accounting clerk job. I knew I wouldn&rsquo;t get the job because Spanish fluency was more important than the no-brain desk work. I haven&rsquo;t used my Spanish in a long time, because I don&rsquo;t want to speak it. The owner of the bookkeeping company, who is Cuban, said that it&rsquo;s not fair that an employee has to be able to speak Spanish to get a job in the U.S. </p>
<p>Yeah, no kidding!</p>

<p>I am surprised that the court cannot simply contact the Embassy of the miscreants country. If their own country cannot or willnot provide an interpreter why should the taxpayers of this country have to foot the bill? Wouldn&rsquo;t you think their own country would want to provide assistance to their own citizen?</p>

		<p>Every court cannot provide access to all possible languages on short notice. I recall the case of an African that insisted on translation in his own tribal language (even though he COULD speak and read English). The court could not locate anyone (within the time allowed by law) so he was released from custody for this singlular reason.</p>
<p>Obviously, this is pure nonsense, especially in the case of illegal aliens&hellip;..even if they come from an obscure Uzbek village. Maybe&hellip;.just maybe, they will think twice about going to a foreign country and disregarding the law.<br>

		<p>In California where the government is quickly going broke because of illegal immigration, the state and counties are paying small fortunes to have interpreters in all the courts.</p>
<p>If this expense were eliminated, California would save many millions of dollars.</p>
