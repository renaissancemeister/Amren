<h1>Black Student at Trinity Wrote Racially Offensive Web Posting</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Arielle Levin Becker, The Hartford Courant, November 8, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The anonymous, racially offensive Web posting that inspired a rally against racism at Trinity College last month was written by a black student who wanted to see how her schoolmates would respond.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ikejimba [Lynda Ikejimba, who wrote the Web posting] wrote in her apology that race relations &#8220;have not been optimal&#8221; on campus and that she wanted to find out how students felt about recent efforts to improve the culture at Trinity. She thought using the anonymous online forum TrinTalk would elicit honest answers and hoped that students would respond in disgust.</p>
<p>She called the post &#8220;the product of an egregious lapse in judgment&#8221; and said she did not intend that the comments leave the Web forum.</p>
<p>The comments disparaged minority students and said their admission to the college correlated with a drop in the college&rsquo;s rankings.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Days after the post appeared, more than 200 students, staff, faculty and administrators attended a rally to reject the comments and show that they embraced diversity. College officials also said the argument in the post was untrue; the representation of minority-group members in the freshman class increased this year, as did the college&rsquo;s rankings.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be wrong to conclude, based on the revelation in that letter of apology, that we don&rsquo;t have work to do in understanding issues of race on this campus, just as it would have been wrong to conclude, based on the one anonymous posting, that the problems are worse than they are,&#8221; [Dean of Students Frederick Alford] said.</p>
<p>Several people on campus said they hoped that people will separate Ikejimba&rsquo;s posting from broader racial issues that need to be addressed. Some said they worried that the post would allow people to dismiss racial incidents in the future.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

								<h2>Community Rallies Against Racism at Trinity College</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Rebecca Brown, Trinity Tripod (Hartford, Connecticut), October 28, 2008</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>The Trinity College community rallied on Monday, Oct. 27, in an effort to combat racism on campus as was recently exhibited in a post on the Anonymous Confession Board (ACB) at TrinTalk.com.</p>
<p>Despite dropping temperatures and darkening skies, students, and faculty alike stood out front of Mather Hall for over an hour listening to speeches and personal reactions from administrators, professors, and students.</p>
<p>In his words to the group, President James F. Jones, Jr. remarked that he wished he had a mirror to hold up to crowd so that those listening could see what he saw: a crowd full of diversity. &#8220;One thing we have learned from existentialists is that we are responsible for what we say and what we do,&#8221; said Jones as he condemned the writer of the posting for hiding behind &#8220;a shield of anonymity.&#8221; Further, he declared he was proud of the fact that 25 percent of the Class of 2012 comes from some sort of diverse background.</p>
<p>Associate Professor of Sociology Johnny Williams memorably called the rally &#8220;bullshit&#8221; for being ineffective and called on the school to implement policies to change the existing status quo. &#8220;Don&rsquo;t feel good when you leave this. Feel uncomfortable. I&rsquo;m uncomfortable all the time on this goddamned campus,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Speaking on behalf of The Council on Campus Climate, College Chaplain Allison Read said, &#8220;Greater than affirming solidarity with students who feel outside a perceived mainstream culture, we seek to define our community as inclusive of students of color as well as gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered. The tasks of respecting each other&rsquo;s dignity and living with integrity belong not to the few but to all members of the community. Each of us is a keeper of our community standards.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apparently written by a student sitting in the basement of the Raether Library, the poster refered to fellow students as &#8220;simian creatures&#8221; and blamed the presence of minority students on lower GPAs, lower SAT and ACT scores, and less alumni giving. The post concludes with, &#8220;Put simply, we let in worse candidates and the outcome is a worse school.&#8221;</p>
<p>A website administrator removed the offending post before many members of the school could view it, however copies were passed around campus.</p>
<p>TrinTalk founder, Michael DiPietro &lsquo;11, ignored requests for comments.</p>
<p>Rosalia Abreu &lsquo;11 and members of the newly-founded Trinity Students Organized Against Racism (T-SOAR), organized the rally, giving students a forum to express their reactions.</p>
<p>&#8220;It saddened me that even one person on this campus would think so lowly of me and other students of color on this campus,&#8221; said Abreu. &#8220;However, instead of becoming bitter and wrongfully assuming that these sentiments reflect those of the entire student body, I decided to channel all of my energy into a more positive reaction.&#8221;</p>
<p>Upon learning about the existence of the racist post, Jones sent out a mass e-mail to the greater community that said, &#8220;Nothing quite damages a community as does sneakiness since no one is sure who, or how many, think this way. This behavior undermines the trust that is essential to making a community work,&#8221; wrote Jones. &#8220;[Trinity] welcomes provocative art, speech, and other forms of expression, but would hope that members of this community could conduct that discourse on a higher level or that anyone who espouses ideas that are likely to offend others would at least have the conviction and courage to do identify herself or himself.&#8221;<br>

<p>I&rsquo;m starting to think that these faux &#8220;racist&#8221; incidents on campus happen because these lib professors want them to happen.  So they have one of their students make a &#8220;racist&#8221; internet comment, then the campus reacts this way, holding &#8220;diversity rallies,&#8221; touting the necessity of even more affirmative action in admissions, hiring and promotion.  Hegelian dialect.</p>

The one thing you can count on is that a good number of unsolved &#8216;hate crimes&rsquo; were likely committed by the alleged offended group.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet this was recorded as a hate crime and there&rsquo;s no mechanism in place to correct the lie. This fake hate crime will live on in statistics and its number will be erroneously quoted as a fact and inflating numbers.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re going to endure hate crime laws then a hoaxer should receive the same punishment as a real &#8216;hate criminal&rsquo; for the same reason: their action targeted a group and demeaned them.</p>
<p>I would also like to see legislation that ensures that hoaxes are recorded as hoaxes, that the numbers clearly state the numbers of hate crimes that were revealed as hoaxes and the race and motives of the hoaxers be part of the criminal record.</p>
<p>Fat chance.</p>

They responded like the politically correct lemmings they are and true to form they don&rsquo;t condemn the race-baiting hoaxer. But make the usual whiny, weasel word comments that &#8220;work still needs to be done&#8221; all the while paying lip service to the 1st amendment.</p>

 &#8220;at least have the conviction and courage to do identify herself or himself.&#8221;  Reminds me of that scene in War of The Worlds where the adoring grad student hottie asks the world famous nuclear scientist what he`s like (not realizing she is ALREADY talking to him. He replies, &#8220;He`s like&hellip; well&hellip; me!&#8221; Don&rsquo;t know who the  actor guy is but he ended up in decline dating Chris Monroe on a Charlie`s Angels episode.<br>
P.S. My other favorite scene is around the table where the egghead tells his country hosts, &#8220;If we could just harness the power contained in a single square dance, we could send that thing back to wherever it came from!&#8221; </p>

Since I do put my name on my posts I think I should point out I missed the &#8220;simian creatures&#8221; crack on the first go round. I wouldn`t have used language that demeaning or confrontational.

		<p>I count at least two anti-white slurs in these two articles:</p>
<p><i> Further, he declared he was proud of the fact that 25 percent of the Class of 2012 comes from some sort of diverse background.</i></p>
<p>Translation: You can only come from a &#8220;diverse background&#8221; if you&rsquo;re non-white. If you&rsquo;re white, you can come from England, France, the Appalachians, the East Coast, the South, etc. and it doesn&rsquo;t matter. &#8220;Diversity&#8221; is a product solely of skin color.</p>
<p><i>we seek to define our community as inclusive of students of color </i></p>
<p>So I guess whites are &#8220;people of no color.&#8221; Bland. Uninteresting. That&rsquo;s a nastier slur  than any of the things written about non-whites in the hoax &#8220;racist&#8221; posting, and yet that kind of anti-white slur is so common it never raises an eyebrow.</p>

		<p>They say the difference between hate criminal and respectability is only degree of scale. That the rules don&rsquo;t apply to upstanding members of society. If it&rsquo;s so criminal to incite racial hatred, what the bageezers have I been watching on my TV the last 20 years? </p>

<p>In other words, a black scapegoating rightless white people is not a racial incident (even though it happens every few weeks).</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t make a big deal out of this, okay whitey?</p>

		<p>I thought Trinity College was a part of Oxford.  Oops, sorry, never mind.</p>
<p>Lets see&hellip;Trinity College is named after the Trinity found in the Christian faith.  We have here the remarkable Associate Professor of Sociology Johnny Williams referring to &#8220;this goddamned campus&#8221;.<br>
Is that like &#8220;this goddamned Trinity&#8221;?</p>
<p>It sounds like we have a budding Rev. Jeremiah Wright here.</p>

		<p>Yes, even the president of this college doesn&rsquo;t know what the word &#8220;diverse&#8221; means:</p>
<p><i>.  .  . he was proud of the fact that 25 percent of the Class of 2012 comes from some sort of diverse background. </i></p>
<p>Even nominally intelligent people now use the word &#8220;diverse&#8221; to mean &#8220;not white,&#8221; and the concept of race is referred to as a &#8220;background.&#8221;  To put is even more simply  &mdash;   black people are diverse, Hispanics are diverse, but whites aren&rsquo;t diverse. </p>
<p>Really, this 21st century Newspeak is pathetic. <br>

<p>I wonder what would happen if someone posted something racially offensive against Whites? Oh wait, that already pretty much is the standard liberal classroom curriculum these days. Where are all the rallies for offended White people?  </p>

		<p>So basically, Lynda Ikejimba and Ibrahim Diallo (who organized the rally) are saying it&rsquo;s great to be racist against whites. And they want everyone to celebrate it some more.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been pointed out before, that these hoaxes are basically designed to stir up hate against whites. Racial hatred. It even says, &#8220;She thought using the anonymous online forum TrinTalk would elicit honest answers and hoped that students would respond in disgust&#8221;.</p>
<p>So basically we have a hate-crime perpetrated against whites, right before our very eyes&hellip; and the whole thing Still turns into an article saying we need more healing. </p>
<p>I got to admit the lady has a lot of guts. More than I do. She turned herself in and fessed up to pulling the hoax.</p>

		<p>Question Diversity, I wouldn&rsquo;t doubt many of the liberal professors want these incidents to happen also. In fact, there have been several cases where the professors themselves have perpetrated a phony &#8220;racist&#8221; incident. These liberals are not liberals in the classic sense of the word, but rather, very disturbed people, either mentally, spiritually, or both. </p>

<p>The gullible, naive fools keep allowing anybody to lead them around by a ring in their noses.  Such abysmal fools makes me ashamed to be white.</p>
<p>If we educate them and turn them around, will they not still be the critical weak links in our group who will always be ready to take up the cause of some non-white, leftist white scammer who plays on their foolish do-gooder sympathies and wind up causing us untold grief, as they are doing right now?</p>
<p>Consider Jane Fonda as an example and her mentally and emotionally disturbed friends.  She was spending sleepless nights thrashing around in bed, terrified that the country wouldn&rsquo;t elect a black Marxist she knows absolutely nothing about.  She&rsquo;s typical of all the rest.</p>
<p>Is it people like these the Marxists are thinking of when they declare that many eliminatiuons will be mandatory when they take over, because there are those who are hopelessly locked into a fantasy world that comprise a dangerous element to their control, because they are easily led fools who might be persuaded to lead a resistance against them?</p>

		<p>With 19 out of 20 blacks voting Democratic and for Obama I would say that they are about as non-diverse as you can get.  One one exit poll in New York State it was 100%!  Diversification is something white people should do.  For our moral superiors, people of color, they need no imporvement.  They and Saint Obama are elevated above whitey.  </p>

<p>I think you can win some kind of reward for most ironic statement of all time. You could win&hellip; if it wasn&rsquo;t for colleges coming out with new admissions brochures and &#8216;diversity statements&rsquo; on a regular basis.</p>
