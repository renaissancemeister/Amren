				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, November 18, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Thirteen years ago, a South Carolina jury decided that Joseph Gardner should be executed for helping to rape, torture and kill a white woman in what prosecutors described as his revenge for centuries of oppression against blacks.</p>
<p>State officials said Monday that Mr. Gardner will be put to death Dec. 5 for his crimes. He can choose between lethal injection and electrocution.</p>
<p>Mr. Gardner was assigned to a Navy ship in Charleston in December 1992 when he and several friends began talking about the injustices done to blacks since they were brought to the country as slaves. The group decided to kill a white woman as retribution, said prosecutors, citing a letter found by investigators that contained passages aimed at justifying revenge against whites.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The circumstances around Ms. McLauchlin&rsquo;s death stirred racial fears in Charleston just nine months after riots in Los Angeles that followed the acquittal of four white police officers in the videotaped beating of black motorist Rodney King.</p>

															<h2><a href="/ar/2003/03.html#article2">Missy McLauchlin, RIP</a></h2>
											<p>
							<i>Jim Lubinskas, American Renaissance, March 2003</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>Last December marked the tenth anniversary of a vicious but virtually unknown racially-motivated murder. On the night of December 29/30, 1992, Melissa &#8220;Missy&#8221; McLauchlin was abducted, raped, tortured, and murdered just outside Charleston, South Carolina, simply because of who she was. This killing is not celebrated like the James Byrd and Matthew Shepard murders. &#8220;Anti-racist&#8221; groups do not include her name in fundraising letters. There is no hate crime legislation named in her memory. There were no MTV or PBS documentaries made about the attack, and ministers did not arrange protests or candlelight vigils. Missy McLauchlin is not a name that comes up in &#8220;sensitivity&#8221; courses or in lessons on bigotry and intolerance. Indeed, her murder was not even classified as a hate crime by the police. Though the case received much local attention in Charleston ten years ago, even there her name has faded from memory, leaving only family members and a fiancé to grieve. It is because Missy McLauchlin was killed for being white.</p>
<p>Police reports paint a clear picture of what happened. Missy McLauchlin, 25, was a native of Wixom, Michigan, living with her fiancé&rsquo;s family in North Charleston, South Carolina. On the night she died she had an argument with her fiancé, John Owen, at a nightclub. She stormed out of the club and began to walk home. Police spotted her, obviously drunk, and gave her a ride home, but she quickly set out on foot for another club. Three black men, Matthew Mack, Matthew Williams, and Joseph Gardner pulled up alongside in a car and started a conversation. They offered her drugs if she would come back to their trailer and have sex with them. Miss McLauchlin, who had a history of drug problems, foolishly accepted their offer.</p>
<p>The men had spent most of the day drinking and watching pornographic videos of black men having sex with white women. At one point Mr. Mack exploded in anger at his white girlfriend, saying he wanted to &#8220;stab her,&#8221; but that &#8220;it ain&rsquo;t got to be her, any white&#8221; would do. Mr. Williams said he wanted to have sex with a white woman. Two hours later, the group watched a television news account of the biggest stories of 1992. When the videotaped beating and arrest of Rodney King came on the air, the third man, Mr. Gardner, spoke of &#8220;four hundred years of oppression,&#8221; and made a &#8220;New Year&rsquo;s resolution&#8221; to &#8220;kill a white bitch.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was in this state of mind that the four returned to the trailer where the three blacks lived. The men offered Miss McLaughlin no drugs, but she willingly had sex with them &mdash; at first. She began to resist, especially when the men wanted to sodomize her, and soon the men were raping her.</p>
<p>They put out the word within the trailer park that they had &#8220;captured a white woman,&#8221; and three other blacks arrived and raped her. Two black women, girlfriends of some of the rapists, were present in another room of the trailer, but did nothing to stop the attack.</p>
<p>After they had enough, the men decided to get rid of the evidence &mdash; including Miss McLauchlin. They soaked her in bleach and hydrogen peroxide, and scrubbed her under the shower with a nylon brush, in the hope of ridding her skin of sperm or other evidence that could be linked to them. They forced her to scrub out her vagina with the same chemicals. They also talked openly of killing her.</p>
<p>The men handcuffed her, blindfolded her, and put a heavy coat over her head. They then took her to a car, and forced her down onto the floorboards in the back. After they had driven for some time, she managed to get out of the handcuffs and began to struggle. Joseph Gardner, who was sitting in the front passenger seat, reached over the seat, held back her head, and shot her twice in the face. The driver pulled over 14 miles outside Charleston, where Mr. Garnder shot her three more times in the face and once in the arm. The men dumped her on the side of the road, drove back to Charleston, and went nightclubbing. A passing driver found Miss McLauchlin, miraculously alive, but she died before the ambulance arrived.</p>
<p>It took police four days to identify the body, and a day later they located the trailer where Miss McLaughlin was raped. By January 9, 1993, police had arrested seven people including two of the ringleaders &mdash; Matthew Mack and Matthew Williams &mdash; and two women, Edna Williams and Indira Simmons, who were charged with being accessories to murder and sexual assault. Three of the rapists were sailors stationed at nearby Charleston Naval Base. The only suspect not in custody was the triggerman, Joseph Gardner, who had carried out his New Year&rsquo;s resolution. Mr. Gardner, who was AWOL from the Navy, eluded police for nearly two years, and might never have been caught had the FBI not put him on the &#8220;ten most wanted&#8221; list. He was living in Philadelphia when someone saw his picture in the post office and tipped off the police. He was arrested on October 20, 1994, and is now on death row.</p>
<p>Police suspected a racial motivation from the start, since they found a &#8220;crudely written racial diatribe&#8221; in the trailer, complete with racial epithets about white oppression, which claimed blacks were &#8220;justified in seeking revenge.&#8221; However, and as is common with black-on-white violence, police and the media tried to hide the racial angle. &#8220;I think we have to be responsible to the community and the people we protect,&#8221; explained North Charleston police captain Charles Caldwell. &#8220;I didn&rsquo;t want to believe this was a racial crime. And we tried to look for other motivations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Writer G. J. Krupey wrote what is perhaps the only detailed account of the Missy McLauchlin murder. It appeared in the now-defunct publication <cite>Heterodoxy,</cite> and later in a collection edited by David Horowitz called <cite>The Race Card.</cite> Of Captain Caldwell&rsquo;s remarks, he writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems unlikely that such cautious sifting of theories would be tolerated in a case involving, say, the burning of a black man by two white youths, to cite an actual case that happened in the same week as McLauchlin&rsquo;s murder only a few hundred miles south in Tallahassee. Nationwide, the press showcased that murder as a typical hate crime: one perpetrated by vicious white racists against an innocent black. President Clinton mentioned the Tallahassee burning in his State of the Union address as an example of the sort of violent racism that still needs to be expunged from the American character. Neither the national press nor the president mentioned Melissa McLauchlin.&#8221;</p>
<p>Local black leaders did not ignore the crime. They went on a full attack against the police and the white community, with state senator Robert Ford leading the effort with help from the NAACP. Not only did Senator Ford claim the killing was not motivated by race, he said the police should be investigated for inventing a racist plot in the McLauchlin case. He chided &#8220;decent white people&#8221; for remaining silent against white racism and claimed the police would not have looked so hard for the killers if the victim had been a black woman.</p>
<p>Letters to the editor of Charleston&rsquo;s biggest newspaper, the <cite>Post and Courier,</cite> voiced complaints from whites who were angry about the crime and the obvious double standard. Letter after letter noted that if the races had been reversed the murder would have been national news, complete with protests, vigils and civil rights marches. One reader wondered why there was so little interest from the federal government: &#8220;Where are the U.S. Justice Department and the Attorney General&rsquo;s office to look into violations of her civil rights? When this tragic event is compared to some of the petty events in which there have been questions of civil rights and racial prejudice in the Charleston area in the past six months, there is no comparison in their harshness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Inevitably, there were whites who denied the obvious. A 31-year-old former teacher urged whites to &#8220;get a grip,&#8221; and reminded them of the &#8220;many contributions&#8221; blacks have made to Charleston. She wrote that all the serial killers she had ever heard of were white, and that most murder victims are killed by people of the same race. Still another white woman claimed the killings were as much about anti-female bias as anti-white bias. According to her, &#8220;sensationalizing the rape/murder as 100 percent racially motivated adds to the already serious racial tensions and downplays the importance of rape as a crime of hate against women.&#8221;</p>
<p>On February 17, 1993, Miss McLauchlin&rsquo;s parents appeared on the nationally syndicated <cite>Montel Williams Show</cite> to talk about the crime, but no other program was interested. Of course, <cite>Time</cite>, <cite>Newsweek</cite>, the <cite>New York Times</cite>, <cite>USA Today</cite>, the <cite>Washington Post,</cite> and virtually every other paper took a pass on the story.</p>
<p>What happened to Missy McLauchlin illustrates two of the most prevalent but least discussed realities of race in America. First is the tremendous amount of black-on-white violence. <a href="https://archive.nc-f.org/" target="NCF" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none">The New Century Foundation</a>&rsquo;s 1999 report, <a href="https://archive.colorofcrime.com/" target="report" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><cite>The Color of Crime,</cite></a> points out that of the approximately 1.7 million interracial crimes of violence involving blacks and whites each year, 1.5 million are committed by blacks against whites. This means 90 percent of interracial violence is black-on-white. Given the differences in the sizes of the black and white populations, it means that any given black is nearly 60 times more likely to commit a violent crime against a white than vice versa. (The report is available on the Internet at www.amren.com.)</p>
<p>Second is the jarring double standard that requires anti-black crimes be reported and deplored coast to coast while anti-white crimes are ignored. Every institution in America conforms to the double standard, which is why James Byrd, Emmett Till and Medgar Evers are known throughout the nation &mdash; and around the world.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a few things have begun to change in the last decade. Jared Taylor&rsquo;s <a href="/store/paved_with_good.html" target="paved" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none">Paved With Good Intentions</a> (1992) was published around the same time as the McLauchlin murder. This underground bestseller put into words what many people silently understood, namely, that it is whites, and not blacks, who are most victimized by racial violence.</p>
<p>Since that time, the Internet, talk radio and alternative media have ensured that there is no longer complete silence about anti-white hate crimes. The mainstream news media continues its blackout, but popular columnists like Ann Coulter, Michelle Malkin, Paul Craig Roberts, and John Derbyshire have each publicized such attacks and the hypocrisy that surrounds them. The <cite>Washington Times</cite> recently printed almost daily coverage of the &#8220;Wichita Massacre&#8221; trials in which two black men in Kansas slaughtered five whites.</p>
<p>Of course, there is still a long way to go before the hate crime double standard crumbles. In December, the <cite>New York Times</cite> ran a lengthy article on Emmett Till, who was killed by whites 47 years ago. No reporter from the <cite>Times</cite> would even recognize the name Missy McLauchlin, let alone think to commemorate the 10th anniversary of her death. Until anti-white murders and attacks are considered news fit to print, it is up to pro-white groups and publications to report these crimes and remember the victims.</p>
<p>Unlike the murder of Missy McLauchlin, some racial attacks never fade from the headlines. Perhaps the best known example of racial violence in the history of the United States is the killing of Emmett Till. Despite the fact that the murder happened over 47 years ago it is still front-page news today. In December, the <cite>New York Times</cite> sent reporter Rick Bragg to Mississippi to write an article on the killing. <cite>ABC News</cite> did a story after the passing of Till&rsquo;s mother, Mamie Till Mobley, on January 6. Robert Redford&rsquo;s Sundance Film Festival screened a documentary, &#8220;The Murder of Emmett Till,&#8221; which was featured on PBS in January. An upcoming documentary, <cite>The Untold Story of Emmett Louis Till,</cite> is scheduled for television next month. No fewer than three books on the killing are scheduled for release this year: <cite>Death of Innocence</cite> (Random House), <cite>The Lynching of Emmett Till: A Documentary Narrative</cite> (University of Virginia Press), and <cite>Getting Away With Murder: The True Story of the Emmett Till Case</cite> (Phyllis Fogelman Books). Nationally syndicated columnist Bill Maxwell wrote a column in January that accurately described what the killing of Emmett Till has come to represent: &#8220;[T]he entire nation was reminded all over again that Americans, especially Southern white men, were capable of unspeakable crimes in the name of race.&#8221;</p>
<p>The double standard lives on.<br>

			<p>My uncle who was an FBI agent during the fifties always claimed that Emmet Till actually raped the woman.  He was only 13, but already 5&#8221;7.</p>
<p>His Father of course was tried and executed by the army during WW2 for the rape and murder of an Italian woman.</p>

			<p>The media is an accessory in the death of Missy McLauchlin. How many times did you see the beating of Rodney King? It was as if they were deliberately fanning the flames of racial hatred.</p>

			<p>While reading this article, I had an idea. I just emailed this idea to Amren through the website for the &#8220;New Century Foundation&#8221;. Here is the emial that I sent. If you agree with what I have to say, PLEASE EMAIL THEM AS WELL!!! I think this could really help our cause. </p>
<p>&#8220;First off, I really enjoy reading articles on American Renaissance. I really appreciate what your organization does for the White Nationalist Cause. There are numerous sites out there that support the White Nationalist cause, but none do it as well as American Renaissance. I think that your organization understands the current state of White Racial Consciousness better than some of the other groups out there. At the moment, the best way to help our cause is to get the information out there. Often times, I hear David Duke screaming for a revolution, but Jared Taylor always presents his arguements in a calm and methodical fashion. There can&rsquo;t be a revolution until the ideas for it are secure in the people&rsquo;s minds. It&rsquo;s with this in mind that I ask, has your organization considered making a documentary? I&rsquo;ve read Jared Taylor&rsquo;s report &#8220;The Color of Crime&#8221;. I&rsquo;ve read the stories about the Knoxville Horror, and today I ready the article about Missy McLaughclin. It had me thinking, why doesn&rsquo;t someone make a documentary about this problem? I find these articles to be very moving, but I also recognize that most people don&rsquo;t have the same reaction to a story from reading it as they would if they actually saw it. There are countless examples of Black-on-White brutality, but as far as I know, nobody has made a serious attempt to put it on film. I&rsquo;m in my twenties, and I can tell you that people in my age group really enjoy a good documentary. Look at the success of Michael Moore. With the readily available technology today, it&rsquo;s become easier and easier to make a documentary that appears well produced for a cheap price. Take films such as &#8220;Loose Change&#8221; for example. I think that an organization like yours really has the potential to make a powerful documentary. &#8220;The Color of Crime&#8221; would serve as a great script, aided by actual footage of stories like I mentioned above. If you could get interviews with surviving families and various law enforment agencies in these cases, I think it would add up to a very powerful film. I can tell friends and families about the stories and ideas I get from your site, but nothing I say or have them read could ever have the same impact on them that seeing it would. I think that the fliers offered on this site are a good way to bring attention to the cause, but they&rsquo;re not good enough. I really think documentaries are the way to go. If you created one, and posted it on this site, I would download it, put it on DVD, and give it to as many people as I could. I think that a documentary about this kind of thing would spread like wild-fire online. Please consider this. There is no other organization that could pull it off as effectively as American Renaissance.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;In the United States in 2005, 37,460 white females were sexually assaulted or raped by a black man, while between zero and ten black females were sexually assaulted or raped by a white man. </p>
<p>What this means is that every day in the United States, over one hundred white women are raped or sexually assaulted by a black man. &#8220;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m convinced that most blacks are essentially brought up to hate whites - the black victim and restitution industry demands it. Consequently a lot of black on white rape is vengence in addition to lust for white women. The outrageous statistics above is not publicized much but should be to help protect white women with a sense caution when it comes to associating or comming in contact with black men.</p>

<p>The part about Louis Till (Emmett&rsquo;s father) is definitely true, but largely covered up.  During the height of the Emmett Till issue, Life Magazine (?) came out with it.</p>
<p>My personal opinion on the Emmett Till issue is this:  I think that there was more than a &#8220;wolf whistle.&#8221;  Where there is smoke, there is usually fire.  For Bryant and Milum to reacted as harshly and as violently as they did indicates to me that Emmett Till made a rather forward threat towards Mrs. Bryant, or so they thought he did.</p>

			<p>&#8220;When the videotaped beating and arrest of Rodney King came on the air, the third man, Mr. Gardner, spoke of &ldquo;four hundred years of oppression,&rdquo; and made a &ldquo;New Year&rsquo;s resolution&rdquo; to &ldquo;kill a white bitch.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>I also blame the mostly White media for this. They constantly keep Blacks stirred up and constantly lie to them about how &#8220;oppressed&#8221; they are. Yeah right. This creates anger amongst Blacks and causes a greater amount of incidences of violent &#8220;revenge&#8221;. If the news media didn&rsquo;t keep the pot boiling, you wouldn&rsquo;t have this problem nearly as much.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;he and several friends began talking about the injustices done to blacks since they were brought to the country as slaves.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but the original slaves brought to this country were White, not Black.  I&rsquo;ve never heard of White people sitting around contemplating to commit a crime because their forefathers were unjustly brought to this country as slaves.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get real.  Blacks are not victims of slavery anymore than White people are.  What Blacks are a victim of is having relatively low IQs, high testosterone levels, and not knowing when they&rsquo;ve been screwed with by the marxist schools and the media telling them that the white man is the devil and the source of all their problems.</p>
<p>Just like the Russians have gotten over having 60 million of their countrymen murdered and had all their personal property taken away from them under communism less than a hundred years ago, I think its time for Blacks in this country to realize that they really, at the end of the day, haven&rsquo;t had it so bad.</p>

Then repetition repetition repetition over and over again like other groups play to the public.  After all whites would rather best forget and let by gones be by gones but it does not rest.  So we must defend ourselves and virtues.<br>

Of course, the Till case was so long ago many people who side with the Simpson jurors were not yet born or were too young to know what was happening. </p>

<p>A lethal injection consists of two parts; a heavy dose of barbituates which knock the perp out like a light, and potassium, which stops the heart.  Most non-criminals have less-pleasant deaths than this: cancer, diabetes, strokes which leave them alive for several years, unable to care for themselves, Alzheimers, multiple sclerosis, etc.</p>

<p>Considering the criminals are black and the community (Charleston, S.C.) is HUGELY black I am surprised they were even convicted at all!! I remember the case (I live 80 miles away) but NOT because of the MSM, it was not on the MSM but I go to Charleston rather frequently and read local papers while waiting there.</p>

			<p>What is beyond my comprehension is that this pea brain who helped to to commit this horrendous crime couldn&rsquo;t figure out that the injustices done to blacks were done by people who, for the most part are dead, and that the injustices done to his people are mostly gone too. He couldn&rsquo;t see beyond the fact that alot of help from whites have been given to blacks, in the form of civil rights, affirmative action and government handouts totaling billions of dollars, and how his own black ancestors helped sell his people into slavery. Also, if this guy hated white people so much, what in God&rsquo;s name was stopping him from migrating back to Africa? This dimwit deserves the death penalty. </p>

<p>The story clearly stated:  &#8220;&rdquo;Local black leaders &hellip; went on a full attack against the police and the white community, with Senator Robert Ford leading the effort with help from the NAACP. Not only did Ford claim the killing was not motivated by race, he said  <b>the police should be investigated for inventing a racist plot  </b>in the McLauchlin case.&#8221;</p>

<p>What does that have to do with it?</p>
<p>And by the way, I also disagree with those who say that it wasn&rsquo;t her fault. She&rsquo;s not entirely blameless. While I certainly agree that no one deserves to be murdered, we do have responsibility for our own behavior. She bears a good part of the blame for having put herself in such a foolish, dangerous situation. Any sensible (and sober) woman would have known better, and would be still alive today.</p>
<p>Also, I have to wonder what race was that boyfriend of hers that she was visiting (and apparently living with). A Northern girl from Michigan moved down South to live with her &#8220;fiance&#8221; in &#8220;highly black&#8221;  and &#8220;very trashy&#8221; North Charleston?  I don&rsquo;t know about this!  Doesn&rsquo;t sound right to me.   The article was strangely silent about that, but I have to wonder if she was already &#8220;into&#8221;  black men. That could explain why she was so ready to hop into a car with a bunch of strange black men in it. (Would most white girls do this?)  There may be more here than meets the eye.  Just wondering.   </p>
<p>Furthermore, I see, upon checking, that N. Charleston is only 44% white, and is rated as the 7th most dangerous city in America.  Bad place to be, stumbling around drunk at 2AM! Even worse for a young, white female.</p>
<p>Of course, no one deserves to get killed, and so horribly.  But there is  also such a thing as practically asking for it.  If you walk voluntarily into the polar bear&rsquo;s cage, what do you expect will happen, and whose fault is it?</p>

			<p>Regardless of whether Ms. McLaughlin willingly got in that car with the murderers, consider this:  would there have been any additional press coverage or outrage had this been a case of say, the forcible kidnapping of a church secretary who was forced to walk home due to a broken down vehicle?  I&rsquo;ll answer for you:  NO.  The little, if any, press received would be garner the same pathetic responses from so many white liberals as cited in the article.  </p>
<p>Whites have no one but themselves to blame since we cannot even get our own to come to our defense.</p>
<p>Personally, I cannot imagine any female accepting a ride from a carload of men, late at night AND agreeing to have sex with them from the get go.  Who is to say that story was not concocted by the perps?  After all, the victim cannot speak for herself, can she?</p>

			<p>We often call the selective reporting the MSM does a &#8220;double standard.&#8221; Actually, it is in a way, a single standard. This means massive coverage of the relatively few white on black crimes and NO coverage of the very many black on white crimes. </p>
<p>In the Duke Rape Hoax, there was wall to wall coverage of a crime that never happened. This was even after there was no DNA evidence, added to the unlikelyness of the incident in the first place.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Mr. Gardner was assigned to a Navy ship in Charleston in December 1992 when he and several friends began talking about the injustices done to blacks since they were brought to the country as slaves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blacks are brainwashed daily in public schools to believe that slavery began and ended in America.  They are ignorant to the fact that black on black slavery began in Africa thousands of years ago and continues unabated to this day.  They are ignorant to the fact that every culture and society on earth has since practiced slavery in one form or another.  They are ignorant to the fact that not one Bible of any religion speaks out against slavery.  And because they are an ignorant and emotionally oriented and thereby incapable of rational thought and deductive reasoning, government schools can easily indoctrinate blacks to hate whites and the blacks revel in it.    </p>
<p>&#8220;The group decided to kill a white woman as retribution, said prosecutors, citing a letter found by investigators that contained passages aimed at justifying revenge against whites.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now that Obama is their president (not ours) this will embolden blacks to commit far more racially oriented violent crimes against whites.  Because blacks are ignorant and emotionally oriented they never give a moment&rsquo;s thought to the consequences of their criminal actions.  It is our responsibility to show them the consequences of those psychotic and sadistic actions&hellip;<br>

<p>in response to your comment about the story &#8220;not sounding right&#8221;:  chances are Missy was engaged to a white man, possibly also in the Navy.  During 1992, the Naval Base in Charleston was still operating full force and many, many sailors, both black and white, lived in North Charleston and the surronding areas, such as Hanahan.</p>
<p>This is really beside the point though, isn&rsquo;t it?  After all, she was brutalized because of her race and the sociopathic behavior of racist blacks.</p>

<p>The folks who do this sort of thing don&rsquo;t have any respect for living human beings; why would they have any respect for the memories of the dead and the peace of mind of their surviving family members?</p>
<p>I doubt even the perps in this case had a sufficiently debased sense of morality to concoct such a story, however.  Their lawyer probably did.  </p>

All true.  However, if she was &#8220;engaged&#8221; to a white man (which we don&rsquo;t know, and the story is strangely silent about him), then  I think she would  be far  less likely to be getting into a car full of black men at 2AM, taking drugs with them, and having sex with them.  Her fiance would not have liked that.</p>
<p>She was brutalized because she was white, yes, but she was also brutalized because she was she was foolish, incautious, and she put herself in that situation. She was not entirely blameless.</p>
<p>At the bottom line,  we are all responsible for our own behavior, and ultimately for our own safety.  I&rsquo;ve taken pains to say repeatedly that no one deserves to be murdered. But  sometimes we make it a lot easier for them.  If she hadn&rsquo;t been staggering down the road, drunk, in a colored part of town, at 2AM, accepting rides from strange black men, this would not have happened to her.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t make them any less guilty, but she was practically an accessory to her own murder.</p>
<p>As for culpability in the perpetuation of black-against-white violence in general, I heartily agree that the mainstream media bear a large share of the guilt due to their one-sided coverage.</p>

			<p>What do you think the murders would say? That they saw Missi walking down the road, stopped and beat her into the car? That would add kidnapping to their charges. It strengthens their defense to say she willing went with them to have sex. Even if she was a race mixer(which there is no evidence of) It&rsquo;s not likely she would have got into a car with four men of any color. Why can&rsquo;t people see this for what it was? Four derelicts bound and determined to take their revenge out on an innocent WHITE WOMAN! Their testimony showed that they were looking for a white woman to kidnap, rape, torture,and murder, not lawyer, cops or media!</p>
