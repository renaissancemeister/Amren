<h1>Those Delicate Jesuit Sensibilities</h1>
 

<p>Laura Vozzella, Baltimore Sun, November 12, 2008</p>

</div> 



<p>An economics professor from Loyola University in New Orleans traveled to Baltimore&rsquo;s Loyola last week to give a lecture, and everybody&rsquo;s been apologizing ever since.</p>
<p>Everybody, that is, but the professor, Walter Block, who chalks up the flap to political correctness.</p>
<p>Block said he knew he&rsquo;d step on toes, since, by his account, he started off with a bit about how the Jesuit order has been &#8220;hijacked by a bunch of Marxists and liberation theologians.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The various apologies issued around campus &mdash; one from the college&rsquo;s economics department, another from President Brian Linnane &mdash; were offered not to allegedly lefty priests, but to women and African-Americans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Professor Block&rsquo;s response to a question about the differences between average earnings of African-Americans and whites in America, which maintained that the disparity could be explained by differences in average productivity, was offensive, and we are sincerely sorry for it,&#8221; read a letter from the economics faculty and the Adam Smith Society.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>College officials have declined to elaborate on just what Block said. Apparently it was so offensive that they can&rsquo;t even bear to say why they&rsquo;re offended.</p>
<p>But on the phone with me, Block filled in the hot-button blank: &#8220;Sociobiology.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said he&rsquo;d told the audience that differences in IQ might account for why blacks and women earn about 30 percent less than their white, male counterparts.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Block said there&rsquo;s research to back up that theory, noting the controversial book The Bell Curve. He offered a little consolation for women, saying they aggregate in the middle of the IQ scale, while men are the outliers. That&rsquo;s why, he said, men dominate the ranks of both prisoners and Nobel laureates. &#8220;Nobel Prize winners in hard sciences,&#8221; he added, &#8220;not the wussy stuff like poetry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Block said no one pulled him aside after the lecture to express dismay. He said he&rsquo;d gotten applause. But days later, a student forwarded the e-mailed apology from President Linnane.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are a Jesuit institution, and as such, a respect for diversity is one of our defining values,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>Said Block: &#8220;They respect diversity but not diversity of opinion.&#8221;</p>
