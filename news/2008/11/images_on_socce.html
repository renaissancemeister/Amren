<h1>Images on Soccer Balls Offend Muslim Sensibilities</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Patrick Goodenough, Cybercast News Service (CNS), November 12, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Images from a Saudi flag on a soccer ball are drawing complaints from Muslims in South Africa, host of the 2010 World Cup.</p>
<p>An Islamic clerics&rsquo; group in South Africa is protesting the appearance of Koranic text in advertising and promotional merchandise for the soccer World Cup, which the country is hosting in 2010.</p>
<p>At issue are soccer balls featuring images of flags of the world, including those of Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq. All three flags include words from the Koran.</p>
<p>The Council of Muslim Theologians, based in Johannesburg, said in a statement that the use of text which Muslims consider sacred &#8220;has the potential of offending adherents of the Islamic faith.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Although Muslims comprise less than two percent of South Africa&rsquo;s population, the community is an influential one, with activists frequently protesting against Israeli and American policies.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The offending balls on that occasion included a Saudi flag, which features a sword and the Arabic script for the &#8220;shahada&#8221; &mdash; the Koranic declaration of faith that states, &#8220;There is no god but Allah, and Mohammed is his messenger.&#8221; Because of Islamic sensitivities, the Saudi flag is never flown at half-staff.</p>
<p>The Iranian flag features stylized text repeating the phrase Allahu Akbar (Allah is greater); Iraq&rsquo;s national flag also includes the phrase, in the middle of the central white stripe.</p>
<p><b>Allah everywhere</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 2005, Burger King restaurants in Britain withdrew an ice cream product after Muslim customers said a label design &mdash; a stylized swirl of soft serve &mdash; looked like the Arabic script for &#8220;Allah,&#8221; when viewed sideways. The Muslim Council of Britain commended the company for &#8220;sensitive and prompt action.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pamphlets have circulated in Muslim countries alleging that the famous swirly-scripted Coca Cola symbol, if viewed in a mirror, resembles the Arabic words, &#8220;No Mohammed, no Mecca.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a &#8220;myths and rumors&#8221; section on its Web site, the Coca Cola Co. dismisses the charge, noting that &#8220;the trademark was created in 1886 in Atlanta, Georgia, at a time and place where there was little knowledge of Arabic.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Two years earlier, the owner of Walls ice cream, Unilever, was forced to scrap a new logo for use in the Middle East after Muslims in Gulf states said the symbol &mdash; a pair of intertwining red and yellow hearts &mdash; looked like the word &#8220;Allah&#8221; in Arabic, when viewed upside down and backwards.</p>
<p>In 1997, Nike pulled more than 38,000 pairs of basketball shoes after the Council on American-Islamic Relations said the logo &mdash; the word &#8220;air&#8221; in flame-like lettering &mdash; looked like &#8220;Allah&#8221; in Arabic, again, when viewed from a certain angle.</p>
<p>Nike also launched a program of &#8220;sensitivity training on Islam&#8221; and donated a children&rsquo;s playground to an Islamic center in Falls Church, Va.  In return, CAIR pledged to urge Islamic organizations and governments worldwide to cancel any planned boycotts of Nike.</p>

			<p>If they&rsquo;re so offended that the Quranic text is on the balls, why aren&rsquo;t they bellyaching about its being on the flags?</p>
<p>If the flags of those Islamic countries weren&rsquo;t acknowledged wouldn&rsquo;t they be complaining about that slight too?</p>

			<p>Remember now, the Muslims are just like you and me.  There is no difference between a European and a Muslim.  Importing millions of Muslims into Europe and North America is good for us.  It will be our Greatest Strength.  To think otherwise is racism.  You don&rsquo;t want to be a bad person now, do you?  Now move along   &mdash;   go buy something   &mdash;   our Global companies need to make some more money.</p>

			<p>&#8220;When viewed sideways&#8221;  What a perverse piece of bullying  It`s like those guys in street thug movies who go, Whaddya mean?!? you don`t like my (fill in the blank )?. No matter what you say they have to jab you one more time. One of the few things that enrage me is people who glean amusement from the embarrassment or humiliation of others. These fanatics would seem to fit the bill.</p>

			<p>The soccer balls didn&rsquo;t look right when viewed from a certain angle and was offensive. On the plus side calling America the &#8216;Great Satan Exploiter&rsquo; will continue unabated.  </p>

			<p>The logical course of action is to remove the Islamic verses from the flags. Christian nations don&rsquo;t have flags with John 3:16 on them.</p>

<p>The penal code term for this type of activity is called extortion.</p>
<p>As for the rest, the muslims are as bad as American blacks and the ADL, constantly looking for something to complain about.</p>

			<p>Europe is making a terrible mistake by allowing muslims into its territory. This may be the greatest error in that continent&rsquo;s long, tough history.</p>

<p>True enough&hellip;  Up until 1918, they actually fought to keep them out.  But European arrogance produced WW1 and WW2 and killed off a great number of Europeans who could not replentish the land.  In order to succeed, the Marshall Plan had to bring in non-Europeans to rebuild.  The idea was that they would go home afterward, but what it did was addict the European economy to non-European labor and open the door to what has lately been unrestrained immigration.</p>
<p>Most Europeans don&rsquo;t have the will to fight anymore but they still have that chauvanist need to feel superior, so they have learned to vent that on America, especially White America, shooting themselves in the foot along the way.</p>
<p>Can White Europe regain control over their ancestral lands?  It doesn&rsquo;t look like it, but I hope they will find a way.</p>
