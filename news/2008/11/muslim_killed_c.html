				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeni Harvey, Yorkshire Post, November 12, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A TEENAGER was brutally murdered by her boyfriend&rsquo;s Muslim flatmate because he did not approve of him going out with a Catholic.</p>
<p>Lidia Motylska, 19, was strangled in an alleyway in Leeds by Iraqi immigrant Abobakir Jabari who objected to his Kurdish flatmate&rsquo;s relationship with her.</p>
<p>Yesterday Jabari, 39, who was given British citizenship in 2005, pleaded guilty at Sheffield Crown Court to murdering the petite Polish teenager.</p>
<p>The court heard he garrotted her from behind, using the cord from his tracksuit bottoms, before inflicting &#8220;gratuitous&#8221; wounds on her lifeless body. He stabbed her repeatedly in the chest and stomach and slit her throat.</p>
<p>Sentencing Jabari to life imprisonment with a minimum tariff of 19-and-a-half years, Mr Justice McKinnon said the murder involved an exceptional degree of violence.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a suspicion that you lured this young woman to her death and marked your disapproval of her and her relationship by gratuitous violence upon her,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The court heard that Jabari grew up in Iraq and was conscripted to the Iraqi army but then deserted. He became involved with the Communist party and later helped opponents of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein&rsquo;s regime flee to Syria.</p>
<p>He came to England in 1999 with his then wife, but they separated in 2003 and he went on to gain British citizenship.</p>
<p>In July 2004 he began working at Symphony Kitchens in Gelderd Lane, Leeds.</p>
<p>Through his work, he met both Miss Motylska and Ajeen Jabaridia, a fellow Kurdish Iraqi who moved in with him at a flat in Oatland Heights in the Little London area of the city.</p>
<p>But he was to become increasingly hostile when the pair became romantically involved.</p>
<p>Prosecuting, Simon Myerson QC said: &#8220;He disliked the fact that his Kurdish friend was going out with a Polish Catholic.</p>
<p>&#8220;He did not like Lidia to sleep at their flat. He disapproved of Lidia&rsquo;s behaviour in public and thought it seemed sexually provocative.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went on: &#8220;He told her that Ajeen should not be seeing her because she was a Polish and Catholic girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Motylska, who lived with her mother Renata in Beeston, Leeds, thought she might be pregnant with Mr Jabaridia&rsquo;s child, the court heard, though this turned out not to be the case.</p>
<p>On the evening of the murder in October last year, she had arranged to meet Jabari and got off a bus near his home at 6.45pm.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, two passers-by called 999, reporting that they had seen a woman on the ground in an alleyway in Lincoln Green, with a man sitting over her &#8220;grunting&#8221; and holding her around the neck.</p>
<p>When police arrived at 7pm, the teenager was dead, with deep stab wounds and her throat slit &#8220;from ear to ear&#8221;.</p>
<p>The judge said one explanation for the slash injuries to her abdomen could have been an &#8220;expression of disapproval at her pregnancy and her relationship&#8221;.</p>
<p>Immediately after the attack, Jabari set about creating an alibi by inviting friends to his flat to watch Arsenal play Slavia Prague in a Champions League football match.</p>
<p>A keen Arsenal fan, Mr Jabaridia had tried to telephone his girlfriend each time the team scored, but got no reply.</p>
<p>He and Miss Motylska&rsquo;s mother reported the teenager missing the next day.</p>
<p>After the sentencing, Det Supt Bill Shackleton from West Yorkshire Police said: &#8220;This was a brutal and calculated murder.&#8221;</p>
<p>The victim&rsquo;s family were too upset to speak.<br>

			<p>Trust a Muslim because he seems &ldquo;moderate&rdquo;? Read Robert Spencer&rsquo;s books  to see what shocking stuff they have to believe - like Koran 98:6 which says infidels like this tragic girl are &#8220;the worst of creatures&#8221; and bound for hell anyway. Some &#8220;moderates&#8221; are part of sleeper cells:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cole said that the al Qaeda leaders gave Abu Ali two options: He could either become part of a martyr operation or he could establish a cell in the United States and he would &#8220;marry a Christian woman, assimilate into the community and he would be provided operatives.&#8221; &lsquo; </p>

<p>If you try to warn women you can get in trouble – even the State Dept. can be intimidated:</p>
<p>https://sweetness-light.com/archive/cair-is-outraged-over-warning-against-marrying-muslims </p>
<p>Christians, with their &ldquo;love all&rdquo; teachings, esp. Catholics with their stupid bishops calling for &ldquo;dialog&rdquo; (always one way – the Muslim way) are especially vulnerable. </p>
<p>Again, the West must end Muslim immigration. This won&rsquo;t be the last such tragedy.<br>

			<p>I wonder if there were some gay issues involved?</p>
<p>That is the trouble with getting involved with certain groups.  The individual may be a fine upstanding person.  But their friends and relatives are often not.</p>

			<p>The MOST dangerous by FAR is the black Muslims that live in the US. Especially now, under Hussein Obama, they will be even more enticed to speak out, act out, etc, in savage violence - in following with their African and Muslim counterparts. <br>
These people need to be identified. Immigration ? Should stop immediately. But, from the fed&rsquo;s current and past actions, it is clear that they mean to see and cause the destruction of this once great country through immigration insanity and unlimited welfare flow into the US&rsquo; many ghettos. </p>

			<p>Ah, those incredible benefits and joys&hellip; of living in a multi-culti society. Rest assured, crimes by immigrants will only rise, in response to the number of third-worlders. But fear not, those of you still fortunate enough to live in less &#8216;integrated&rsquo; nations. Third-worlders are heading your way, too. To bring YOUR nation the benefits of a multi-cultural society.</p>

			<p>At least this got in the paper.  In California, 4 Camp Pendleton black marines tortured and killed their white sergeant and his newly wed black wife.  She was also raped.</p>
<p>The murderers of course had felony records but were still recruited because the Marines need live bodies for the neo-con war in Iraq.</p>
<p>The papers and the military investigators claim the motive was robbery.  Yeah right, we know the motive was hatred.</p>
<p>The MSM even locally is as usual covering this up.  If the races had been reversed, it would be all over the news for months like the Duke LaCrosse and Jena cases.</p>
<p>Hopefully the families can sue the Marines, DOD and the individual recruiters for wrongful death.</p>
<p>I know that from 1965 to 1980 military bases were very dangerous for whites including the dependents.  With the election of Obama those days are returning.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve been saying since I became aware of Amren, that the muslims pose the greatest threat to the American way of life, and in fact, ANY civilized life style. The black problem can be resolved since the blacks are not likely to sacrifice their lazy selves to martyrdom, and finances for their federal upkeep will end in a year or so but not so the zeal of the muslims in their desire to destroy America and Americans.</p>

			<p>To the poster at 12:33 PM: I&rsquo;m not surprised by this. Blacks are two-faced when it comes to interracial relationships - they like to flaunt the black man -white woman pairing.</p>
<p>But a white man-black woman pairing will make them gnash their teeth and foam at the mouth. </p>

			<p>Soprano Fan, you are 100% correct about that. Actually I saw a white teenage male with a black teenage girl at a local shopping mall a few years ago. I was walking behind them. As we passed a group of black &#8220;thug type&#8221; males, they started taunting the white boy for being with a black girl. And I mean really getting nasty about it. Luckily enough for this mismatched couple, they came across a group of his white friends. The thug types broke off and went the other direction. I really believe they would have kicked his butt had he not come across his group of friends. I was torn as whether to intervene on his behalf had it come to blows. Mind you, I will fight at the drop of a hat if the need arises. But, I was just as aggravated with this match as were the black boys. Just on the opposite side of the coin. Thinking back on it, I probably would have let them stomp his butt really good, and then intervene before they killed his dumb self.</p>
