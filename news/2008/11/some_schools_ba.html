<p>That experience was not mirrored, however, at some other public schools in St. Tammany Parish. According to interviews with many students and school administrators in the past week, some teachers not only avoided talk of the election, but also banned students from discussing it or mentioning Obama&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s racial, &#8221; Davis [Greater Covington NAACP President James &#8220;Gus&#8221; Davis] said afterward. &#8220;We have a person that&rsquo;s black that made president. This is the South, this is a completely Republican parish.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The administration is investigating the allegations, which Sloan [Superintendent Gayle Sloan] said may have resulted from an attempt to prevent arguments between students on opposing sides of the political fence. &#8220;Teachers are human and they sometimes make mistakes,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Tammany for McCain</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the presidential election, St. Tammany Parish voted for Republican candidate John McCain over Obama 76 percent to 22 percent. African-Americans are 13 percent of the population, with white people making up 84 percent, according to a 2006 census update.</p>
<p>In some cases, students said they were threatened with punishment if they talked about the election.</p>
<p>&#8220;She said that if we did talk about (the election) she&rsquo;d write us up,&#8221; 14 year-old Briana Seals, who is black, said of a teacher at Slidell Junior High School.</p>
<p>In Covington, parent Dominique Elzy, who is black, said she complained to the principal at E.E. Lyon Elementary School after her 7-year-old son told her that he was made to stand along the playground wall after he shouted, &#8220;Obama won!&#8221; during recess.</p>
<p>Lyon Principal Jeanine Barnes, who is white, said Wednesday that she investigated the complaint and found inconsistencies in the boy&rsquo;s story, adding, &#8220;Our school does not advocate prejudice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kasey Terrebonne, a senior at Slidell High School who is white, said Principal William Percy announced two days after the election that some students had received detention for discussing it.</p>
<p>Reached for comment, Percy, who is white, disputed that he banned political discussion and that students were punished.</p>
<p><b>&lsquo;Pretty tense&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rachel Weaver, a senior at Northshore High School in Slidell and a white Obama supporter, said teacher and peer bias made her reluctant to voice her opinions. Some students used racial slurs to refer to the president-elect and her American history teacher simply ignored the election, Weaver said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was pretty tense most of the time,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Davis, with the NAACP, said he and ministers from churches in Mandeville, Covington, Madisonville and Folsom, as well as with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in Atlanta, requested the meeting with Sloan after hearing complaints.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know they want to keep problems down, but they&rsquo;re going about it the wrong way,&#8221; said Davis. Students &#8220;have a right to be proud that a black man won.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Letting passions die</b></p>
<p>Sloan, who began hearing reports from parents last week, said she has talked with principals and sent out an e-mail reminding them of the importance of letting students express their feelings about the election.</p>
<p>Principals were not told to prohibit election discussion, &#8220;but there were schools where principals and teachers made decisions that, because students were being acrimonious about it, to hold off on talking about it, and let passionate feelings die down,&#8221; she said.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The reports have many parents up in arms and black leaders on alert. Greater Covington NAACP President James &#8220;Gus&#8221; Davis and a coalition of local black ministers met with schools Superintendent Gayle Sloan on Wednesday morning to discuss the issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nothing reveals that segregation is here to stay than an article like this.</p>
<p>This reminds us all that blacks and whites, thankfully, will never consider themselves as anything but distinct groups and races.  Hispanics do the same.</p>
<p>So the bottom line is that the people of this multiracial nation will always segregate themselves and it isn&rsquo;t necessary to mandate it in order to keep the races separate as much as possible.</p>
<p>Yes, they go to school together, but they will always be separate, and that&rsquo;s a good thing. </p>

		<p>Public schools are allowed to prohibit otherwise protected free speech in order to keep peace and to foster a tranquil learning environment.  The courts have come to this consensus.</p>
<p>St. Tammany Parish is a New Orleans white flight area.  IIRC, David Duke&rsquo;s district when he was a State Rep was in St. Tammany.</p>

		<p>If this doesn&rsquo;t tell you about the state of race relations in America, what will?  Is the possibility for violence so great that the system has resorted to censorship?  This is asinine.  </p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s ok to celebrate Obama&rsquo;s victory openly, then is it ok for dissenters to voice their disappointment openly?  As we all know, the school knew what would happen if they allowed this.</p>
<p>Why else would the school discourage students from taking an interest in their country and its politics?</p>

		<p>Why did McCain and the Republican party knowingly throw this election?</p>
<p>Was McCain so vain and egotistical as to put his own ambition ahead of the well being of the country.</p>
<p>Those that control the media and the political parties are guilty of treason, if in fact they are even US nationals.  If not US nationals, then they are engaging in open war against US society.</p>
<p>It is too bad that the schools are not the grounds for the presentation of all of the facts and real truth regarding politics and politicians.</p>
<p>Our children are being fed lies and misrepresentations.</p>
<p>How can they possibly learn to judge political issues and politicians when they are hopelessly brainwashed by those that they are conditioned to trust and respect.</p>

Did you notice how the author felt it necessary to identify the race of almost everyone quoted in the article?</p>
<p>Mr. X, <i>&#8220;who is white .  .  .&#8221;</i> and Mrs. Y, <i>&#8220;who is black .  .  .&#8221;</i> Those phrases appear over and over.</p>
<p>I wonder if in the future they&rsquo;ll just use a simple code like this:  <i>Mr. X (W),</i> and <i>Mrs. Y (B), </i>etc.</p>
<p>Keep your eye out for that one.</p>

		<p>This election was a joke, but the result is not funny. An anti-White afro-marxist is the POTUS, and Western civilization is on the brink of extinction. The black voters who were 98% for BHO act as if they won the Superbowl, as their selfish desire came true; a black president at any cost, even if he refuses to verify his US citizenship. An unqualified social worker with a law degree, funded and groomed by radical anti-US foreigners.  <br>

		<p>Yes my little comrades you are doing exactly what I like seen being done. Allowing the lowest of the low to tell you how to live, what you can say or not say, and soon, very soon what you can think If You don&rsquo;t Want To Be Jailed..</p>
