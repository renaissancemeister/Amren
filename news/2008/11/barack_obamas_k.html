<h1><a href="https://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article5082040.ece">Barack Obama&rsquo;s Kenyan Family to Celebrate by Slaughtering Bulls, Chicken and Goats</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rob Crilly, Times (London), Nov. 4, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>There&rsquo;s only one thing to take to a Kenyan election victory feast: a goat. Preferably still breathing &mdash; &ldquo;a sign of freshness&rdquo; &mdash; and with big testicles, apparently the sign of quality breeding. </p>
<p>And so it was that I found myself bouncing along a dirt track towards the ancestral home of the Obamas in a saloon car with the sound of John the goat bleating miserably from the boot. </p>
<p>It had not been easy finding such a quality specimen. The local livestock market had mostly sheep and cattle, with only a few scrawny goats on hand. </p>
<p>Instead, John was spotted at the side of the road by my driver George, who was impressed by the size of its belly and, well, other attributes. </p>
<p>He was mine for 2500 shillings, a little under £20, and roughly the price of 20 pints of beer or eight malaria-proof bednets. </p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a fine animal,&rdquo; said Abongo Malik Obama, at the lush family homestead in the far west of Kenya, surrounded by grazing cattle and fields thick with maize. &ldquo;You are certainly welcome now to stay and sit around the fire tonight.&rdquo; By then John will be nyama choma &mdash; the Swahili term for grilled meat. </p>
<p>He was to be only one small part of a vast celebration feast starting last night and comprising four bulls, 16 chickens and assorted sheep and goats. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We are Africans, so our plan is to slaughter a bull and have friends come over,&rdquo; said Abongo, the candidate&rsquo;s oldest half-brother. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We invite Kogelo (the village where Mr Obama&rsquo;s Kenyan family lives) to come over and it will be open house. People will just come on over and bring a couple of sodas.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Losing has never been considered in a country gripped by Obamamania for the best part of four years. Ever since their &ldquo;lost son&rdquo; was elected to the Senate everyone has been expecting him to become president. </p>
<p>Every twist and turn of his primary battle and general election campaign have been followed in the local papers and on television in the belief that his rise was inevitable. </p>
<p>Today, early signs of celebration were obvious everywhere, long before the polls opened. </p>
<p>American flags hung from trees in the city centre of Kisumu, the regional capital, and flapped from the handlebars of bicycle taxis. </p>
<p>The Jamaican reggae hit, &ldquo;Barack Obama&rdquo;, by Cocoa Tea boomed from matatus &mdash; the battered minibus taxis that most locals use to get around. </p>
<p>And bars were setting up big screens so that patrons could watch television coverage from the US as a whole nation held its breath for the signal to celebrate. </p>
<p>In Kogelo, women peeled onions and stoked cooking fires &mdash; yet another reminder of the vast gulf between his American dream and their African reality. </p>
<p>Children rehearsed their songs ahead of a party being held at a neighbouring school, the Senator Barack Obama Secondary School, while gospel music pumped from a marquee where priests were praying for victory. </p>
<p>Abongo, sitting in front of the tin-roofed shack that once belonged to Obama&rsquo;s father, a government economist who died in a car accident more than two decades ago, said dozens of family members had congregated for a historic event. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The reason we are here is that we are looking forward to a great day to celebrate,&rdquo; he said, rubbishing any suggestion that Mr McCain might win. &ldquo;We are not considering that possibility. I am not,&rdquo; he said confidently, as a cock crowed in the shade of a mango tree.&rdquo; The first stage of the celebrations was starting tonight. </p>
<p>Relatives, including some from England, were planning to stay up watching the results start to filter across the Atlantic. </p>
<p>Tomorrow, they will move to the neighbouring school where the chickens are breathing their last. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be chaotic,&rdquo; said Ben Semel, from New York, who was helping organise the feast, &ldquo;especially when everyone goes through the election night without sleeping.&rdquo; <br>

			<p>This is the sort of thing you expect in Africa. This is also pretty much what will be happening in African sections of America tonight and tomorrow if,God help us, Obama wins.</p>

			<p>What&rsquo;s the average IQ in Kenya? 63? 65?</p>
<p>This reminds me of 4 year olds on Christmas eve.  But most white 4 year olds can understand Mommy saying &#8220;Santa Claus said we can&rsquo;t keep a pony in a 2 bedroom apartment.&#8221;  &#8220;Santa can afford new Barbie&rsquo;s but not the Barbie dream house this year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apparently Kenyans can&rsquo;t understand Uncle Sucker saying &#8220;wait till the votes are counted.&#8221;  &#8220;Just because he&rsquo;s running doesn&rsquo;t mean an automatic win.&#8221;</p>

			<p>The article above is patently dishonest.  It implies the animals are to be eaten.  They may be eaten but the primary reason for them is a living ritual sacrifice as part of some dark ritual.  The goat is to be swung by its rear legs to bash its brains against a special rock (that houses a rock god of some sort) in order to obtain its blessing.</p>
<p>Obama as a muslim is starting to sound more and more reasonable.</p>

			<p>Wow. And BHO is supposed to be American? This is not only an outrage, but it is also insulting that a man like him could even come so close to winning, assuming that he doesn&rsquo;t. What&rsquo;s really scary is that, even if he doesn&rsquo;t win, he nevertheless could win in future elections; and he most definitely has set a precedent that our nation&rsquo;s most powerful leader need not be white/American. America mortua est.</p>

			<p>What they are failing to disclose in this article are the animials are sacrificed to spirits and then the feast begins. While it&rsquo;s true that the majority of the Kenya people are Christians, Christianity is often mixed with traditional beliefs like witchcraft abd animisim and a large segment are straight animists with about 6 percent of Kenyans practicing Islam.</p>

			<p>MCain conceded at 11/45 EST.  I always felt that both parties connived to put in Obama.  Hear the latest about the bailout?</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs will use some of the bailout money to give bonuses to 850 of its employees.  The bonuses will average $500,000 half a million dollars apiece, more than many working people will earn in a life time.</p>
<p>And of course the money came from the taxpayers. </p>

			<p>To all the giddy hordes dancing and weeping for joy over your candidate&rsquo;s victory, and to all the people in the media who are acting as if the Second Coming were underway, I have a little something to say.  You are going to get what you deserve.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I, too, am going to get what YOU deserve.  I am not immune to the consequences of your choice of ideology over reason.</p>
<p>You will be astonished to see how quickly things go bad.  Things will get so bad so fast you will not be able to mentally process the reversals sweeping across this land.</p>
<p>Just for giggles, I&rsquo;d suggest you read The Collected Stories of Isaac Babel.  Babel was optimistic about the great &#8216;CHANGE&rsquo; that Socialism and the overthrow of the Czarist government would bring to Russia.  But his stories began to lose their anticipatory tone, and soon took on a dazed bitterness.  Then, his stories stopped coming, because he was imprisoned and executed by the very government he&rsquo;d cheered into being.</p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;d suggest reading Victor Klemperer&rsquo;s I Will Bear Witness.  This Holocaust diary consists of two long volumes, and will give you a foretaste of your world crumbling around you.  BTW, by the time you realize things are going the way of Argentina under Peron, China under Mao, Cuba under Castro, and South Africa under Mandela, it will probably be too late to find another country.  In all likelihood, you&rsquo;re trapped here.</p>
<p>But relax and enjoy!  You abandoned reason and elected an ideologue.  You wanted CHANGE, and now you&rsquo;re going to get it.</p>

			<p>     Obama is now President of the World. We are a despised mi-<br>
nority. We are considered evil-and we must become exactly the<br>
devil they expect us to be. This desperate effort to appease and<br>
placate them must cease. It has not worked. It will not work. But<br>
it has certainly worked for them. No more. Let us become White<br>
Devils to be feared. And in so doing, win ourselves a Home.</p>

Maybe now we&rsquo;ll find out what all that mysterious &#8220;Change&#8221; is all about.  I suspect so.  For months, we were preached to about &#8220;Change you can believe in.&#8221;  Yeah.  But he never said what it was!  And worse, the old geezer who led the Stupid Party into  defeat, never pinned him down and demanded an answer.  </p>
<p>Oh, he didn&rsquo;t want to appear &#8220;racist&#8221; I guess.  Better to lose the election than to seem racist.  What fools, the Stupid Party!</p>

			<p>Scot&rsquo;s comments reflect my thoughts exactly. The destruction of America as we&rsquo;ve known it will proceed with stunning speed, so rapidly that people won&rsquo;t be able mentally to process the changes.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doomed.</p>

			<p>   It is with great sadness, that I must remind all patriotic Americans that the United States of America passed away painfully on Tuesday, November 4th, 2008. She is survived by a motley crew of dispossesed white people. Now reality sinks in for us all. The cememteries are full of brave men and women that made the ultimate sacrifice for their country,, for nothing. Every war we were engaged in for over two centuries was in vain. Now America will suffer for its arrogance and stupidity for allowing the communist party to obtain such a foot hold in our country. This is no longer my country, I am a stranger in the country I was born in over 50 years ago. I am truly ashamed to be an American today. Actually, I no longer consider myself an American, and I am exploring my limited options. Amerika is NOT my country. To all my white brothers and sisters whom fought the good fight; I love and respect you all. I just feel my options as an amerikan citizen are slim to none. Unlike the democrats who threatened to leave the country, I will do it. There is nothing here for me.  God bless you all.</p>

			<p>As a patriotic, decent-living American citizen and voter, I am shocked to realize how many incompetent, air-headed liberal fools and idealists we have in our country!</p>
<p>No, I am not, was NOT against Obama for his race. But for his communist/marxist ideology and thinking. Which I realized reading his Berlin speech. Telling [perceived wealthy] White European countries to admit millions more African primitives to become perpetual welfare burdens on these countries.</p>
<p>Then his &#8220;redistribution of wealth&#8221; was the final proof of what Obama&rsquo;s thinking was like.</p>
<p>I am now convinced that the United States is definitely heading for eventual dissolution. Breaking apart into political and ethnic entities. Probably starting within at the most, a decade or two. Because WORKING America simply will not stand for the premise of supporting our society&rsquo;s freeloaders and parasites (be they American Blacks, or Hispanic illegal immigrants). Nor will Amnesty change our feelings or views on illegal Hispanic immigration.</p>
<p>If the break-up of America does occur, I fervently hope future generations will be filled with the resolve to drive out the invaders, at whatever the cost will be. To take back what is rightfully America&rsquo;s and restore our country to what it was BEFORE 1965 and our utterly insane immigration policy changes.</p>

			<p>It is funny how leftist democrats (those experts on Christianity) used to refer to Bush as the anti-christ. Well, the anti-christ is to be LOVED by the world, not hated (as Bush was.</p>
<p>Oh, and I remember them calling Bush a chimp too.</p>
<p>Those clever democrats.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s happened folks.  Americans have elected Barack Hussein Obama as the next president of these once great United States of America.  Do we need any more proof that America is gone?  Did you see the mindless hordes weeping with joy as the Messiah uttered his holy words from the pulpit?  </p>
<p>It will be interesting now to see how quickly the North American Union comes about.</p>
<p>This is a very bleak day for America, my friends.  And that&rsquo;s an understatement.  </p>

			<p>They plan to &#8220;go to the white house&#8221;</p>
<p>guardian.co.uk, Wednesday November 05 2008 </p>
<p> Sarah Obama was getting hungry. Her step-grandson had just been elected US president and she was going to celebrate &#8220;with a feast&#8221;. But what would she eat? &#8220;Chapo&#8221;, Mama Sarah said - slang for chapatis - to roars of laughter from relatives gathered on the lawn in front of her house. </p>
<p>It was perhaps an apt choice for a woman who has always maintained that the reflected glory of her grandson would not change her simple way of life; waking at dawn, tending her vegetables, going to market, going to bed. Even last night, when other members of the family camped at her house could not sleep for all the excitement, she turned in early, woke at 3am to find the result was still some way off and rose again once the sun was up.</p>
<p>Only when the generator-powered television tuned to CNN announced that Obama had won at 7am did she allow herself to get caught in the emotion, rushing out of the family compound with a group of family members, past a group of startled policemen guarding her gate, to serenade the waiting media. &#8220;We are going to the White House,&#8221; they sang, hugging and dancing. A few hours later, once the reality of Obama&rsquo;s victory had sunk in, she said: &#8220;I don&rsquo;t know if I will die of happiness.&#8221;</p>
<p>By then the euphoria spread across Kenya, where people consider Obama to be one of their own. There were impromptu celebrations in the eastern port city of Mombasa, the western lakeside town Kisumu and the capital Nairobi, where some youths marched through a slum singing: &#8220;Obama don&rsquo;t sleep. The struggle is still on.&#8221; </p>
<p>A decision by President Mwai Kibaki to declare tomorrow a bank holiday only added to the party mood. Elsewhere Obama&rsquo;s win was seen as one for all of Africa; in Uganda students burned tyres in celebration, while in South Africa the former Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu likened the US poll to Nelson Mandela&rsquo;s election win in 1994. &#8220;We have a new spring in our walk and our shoulders are straighter,&#8221; Tutu said.</p>
<p>At the village dispensary near Mama Sarah&rsquo;s house in Kogelo, the village in western Kenya where she raised Barack Obama&rsquo;s late father, hundreds of people had stayed awake through the night, dancing and watching al-Jazeera&rsquo;s election coverage on a large screen. Soon after the result was announced they ran down the dirt road to Mama Sarah&rsquo;s homestead, where police had kept the media locked behind the gate. </p>
<p>Waving branches, beating drums and singing the refrain: &#8220;The Champion has stepped into the arena, and everybody is watching,&#8221; they insisted the police allow them into the compound.</p>
<p>&#8220;We cannot be intimidated by the Kenyan police,&#8221; a man shouted, threatening to tear the gate down. &#8220;We are now under the US government.&#8221;</p>
<p>A policeman opened the gate and they stormed inside, dancing for several minutes around the graves of Barack Obama Sr and his father Hussein Onyango Obama. The police, who set up a post inside the compound a few months ago, are likely to remain a permanent fixture there now that Mama Sarah is a member of America&rsquo;s first family.</p>
<p>&#8220;They will surely have to stay for security reasons,&#8221; said Wycliffe Obama, 22, a son of Barack Obama&rsquo;s cousin, who spends most weekends at the homestead and was yesterday draped in an American flag. &#8220;If Barack is the president of the US then anything could happen here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other changes are more welcome. Today workers were erecting electricity poles outside the compound - preparing to connect Mama Sarah&rsquo;s three-bedroom house to the national grid for the first time. For the past week government construction workers have been frantically smoothing the road to her home, aware that a US presidential visit may not be too far off. </p>
<p>But Auma Obama, the half-sister who Obama thanked in his victory speech today, said that his Kenyan family already lived a &#8220;good life&#8221; and were not anticipating any more favours from the local authorities, or the US. &#8220;As a family we support Barack, but we have not got expectations [of him helping us in Kenya]. He is an American &hellip; if there are any changes they will be in America and the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before journalists were requested to leave the compound to allow the Obamas to prepare for the feast - beside the chapatis, fleshly slaughtered beef and chicken was on the menu - Mama Sarah had time for a few more questions. Her advice to the new president? </p>
<p>&#8220;He should work very well globally, especially for global peace.&#8221;</p>
<p>And would she be travelling to the US for the inauguration? </p>
<p>&#8220;Do you really think I am going to be left behind?&#8221;<br>

			<p>Just wondering how long the lines at Nairobi&rsquo;s airline ticket counters are&hellip; With Kenyans selling off goats, cows, wives, ANYTHING to buy their one-way ticket to NIRVANA.</p>
<p>We can sure as hell anticipate floods of Africans coming here&hellip; to stay, of course. Thanks to our misguided generosity. Courtesy of our pandering politicians. </p>

			<p>This is a lovely day, my friends. As a black man with a six-figure income, a couple Master&rsquo;s degrees, a PHD, etc. I see that you are right, that you are losing what you  &mdash;   rightly or wrongly  &mdash;   have perceived to be your country.<br>
This is no longer your country. A new day has risen and Barack Hussein Obama is the symbol of demographic and cultural shift that you are powerless in the wake of.<br>
Your time, inaugurated in the explorations of Columbus, is at its close in this new world.</p>

<p>The problem, of course (assuming you&rsquo;re not lying about yourself), is that the demographic dispossession of whites you celebrate will result in something not terribly different from any third-world nation. Whites no longer run Zimbabwe; how&rsquo;s that working out? When inflation in the US reaches Zimbabwe levels, that &#8220;six-figure income&#8221; will be worthless. Take whites out of the United States, and what you get is black Africa, southeast Asia or the more squalid regions of Latin America.</p>

Perhaps so. But  don&rsquo;t get carried away and boast too much!  And don&rsquo;t presume to take credit for his success for yourselves.  Your people did not accomplish this on your own.  It was <i>handed </i> to you.  Since the very  start, Obama was surrounded by mentors, whites,  who have promoted him and made him what he is today.  He is <i>their  </i>creation, not yours. <br>

    Without Columbus there would be no blacks in the Americas or the Caribbean. If the Americas do not belong to Europeans, it sure has hell does not belong to black Africans. Without Whites, the U.S.A would not have been a technologically advanced nation. Without the European age of discovery you would have been living in a primitive hut in Western Africa under the tyranny of arrogant chiefs and medicine men with the constant fear of being enslaved or eaten by the enemy tribe. No PhD&rsquo;s nor computers nor life saving medicine.<br>
          You guys can have the U.S.A if you want. America&rsquo;s days are numbered anyways. The future belongs to China you will never see a black man ruling that land. The Chinese are neither stupid nor filled with guilt.</p>

			<p>That Black claiming two Masters&rsquo; and a PhD&hellip; maybe with his stupendous insight, he could explain WHY African Blacks could never amount to anything in the 50,000 years or so since their appearance on the African continent? Or why so many American Blacks are only marginally smarter than their  African counterparts.</p>
<p>Oh, never mind. It&rsquo;s always the same answer: White racism! I should have never asked.</p>

			<p>In an age of affirmative action handing blacks degrees they didn&rsquo;t earn means those pieces of paper are akin to food stamps handed out to people too lazy to earn money to pay for their own groceries&hellip;</p>
