<h1><a href="https://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-salvadoran3-2008nov03,0,5647680.story">Central American Immigrants Adopt Mexican Ways in US</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Esmeralda Bermudez, Los Angeles Times, Nov. 3, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rivera and thousands of other Central and South American immigrants have left their native countries only to arrive in an American city dominated by Mexicans, who comprise L.A.&rsquo;s largest Latino group and have access to most of the jobs sought by immigrants. The metropolis drives many to Mexicanize, to degrees big and small, often before they start to Americanize. </p>
<p>Change comes gradually, particularly through speech, as different words take over, intonations fade and verbs are conjugated in new ways. Some immigrants begin to mimic mejicanos even before they leave their homeland. They toy with Mexican curse words and awkwardly bend their accents to blend in as they cross Mexico into the United States. </p>
<p>There are more than 350,000 Salvadorans in Los Angeles County, most living in the dense neighborhoods surrounding MacArthur Park. </p>
<p>They try to carve out a distinct identity. Their pupuserias dot the area, and each summer thousands gather to celebrate Salvadoran Day. Last year, parents succeeded in opening Monseñor Oscar Romero Charter Middle School, named after a Salvadoran martyr, to help young Salvadoran children learn about their heritage. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Salvadorans began pouring into Los Angeles in large numbers in the 1980s, many fleeing El Salvador&rsquo;s brutal civil war. Many arrived disillusioned and powerless, and unlike Mexicans, their roots and networks did not date back centuries. Getting a job often meant getting the nod of a Mexican contractor, foreman or manager. </p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s always Mexico, Mexico, Mexico,&#8221; said Jorge Mendoza, a 42-year-old painter, one of a group of Salvadoran men who gathered recently at MacArthur Park. &#8220;I turn on the radio and all I hear is Mexican music. If I want to watch a soccer game, I have to watch a Mexican team play.&#8221; </p>
<p>The same goes for Spanish newscasts, telenovelas, celebrity gossip   &mdash;   all dominated by Mexicans. </p>
<p>The greatest affront comes daily as most strangers assume Salvadorans are Mexican, said Julio Martinez Sarceño, 62, who moved to the United States 32 years ago. He carries his Salvadoran identification card in his wallet at all times, &#8220;just in case someone needs proof.&#8221; </p>
<p>Like him, most Salvadorans hold proudly to the distinctions of Central America&rsquo;s smallest country: El Salvador&rsquo;s independence day is September 15, the day before Mexico&rsquo;s; the national menu is made up of pupusas and fried yuca, not enchiladas and menudo; Salvadorans flood the dance floor when a band sounds off a cumbia, not as a mariachi band belts out a ranchera.</p>
<p>But sounding Mexican sometimes is inevitable. The two communities have mingled at work, school and church for nearly three decades; they have intermarried, baptized each other&rsquo;s children and cried at each other&rsquo;s funerals. </p>
<p>Some have subconsciously picked up Mexican speech habits. They slip and use common Mexican expressions such as córrele (hurry.) Others deliberately Mexicanize their speech to avoid confusion. They ask the ice cream vendor for helado, not sorbete, and fly a papalote (kite) instead of a pizcucha. </p>
<p>Others refuse to budge.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m never going to change the way I speak,&#8221; Mendoza said. English should be the first priority for an immigrant, so why &#8220;run around speaking Mexican?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Out of need,&#8221; argued Martin Fernandez, who left El Salvador for the San Fernando Valley in 1989. </p>

			<p>This is terrible!  Why should Salvadorans be forced to listen to Mexican music or watch Mexican TV or eat Mexican food.  This is America, where Diversity Is Our Greatest Strength (TM).  Our government must immediately correct such civil, racial and ethnic injustices.  We demand separate TV, Radio, Newspapers, and magazines in each language of the world, now.  We demand that all schools teach the history and culture of all the worlds ethnic groups and religions.  We demand that all restaurants serve all foods from all other nations.  Ssubject</p>

<p>How do you think Americans feel about It&rsquo;s always Mexico, Mexico?</p>
<p>&#8220;The greatest affront comes daily as most strangers assume Salvadorans are Mexican.&#8221;</p>
<p>My family&rsquo;s been in this country since the 1640&rsquo;s.  How do you think I feel when people assume I&rsquo;m a Russian immigrant because of my blue eyes and fair skin?  Had I brown eyes and black hair people would assume I am Persian or Armenian.</p>
<p>There are so few American whites  left in Los Angeles people just assume we belong to one of the white immigrant groups.</p>

<p>You know, off the top of my head, I can think of a really good place to learn about Salvadoran heritage. It&rsquo;s called El Salvador.</p>

<p>Pretty soon, this will describe the entire United States of America, oops I mean the United States of Mexico.</p>

			<p>The solution is very simple. Just go back to Guatemala, El Salvadore or wherever you came from&hellip;and if you take all of the Mexican Nationals with you, perhaps we can get it back to the paradise it was 30+ years ago. Everybody would be happy and we could get back to being a First World Country again.</p>

			<p>Under the Constitution, America was traditionally bound to truth as the foundation which guided our most important decision making.<br>
Although race is not stated in the Constitution, race traditionally goes hand in hand with the Constitution since white genetics, and white mans belief systems which have been built upon the white genome throughout history is the primary key in leadership and guidance when decisions affecting America must be implemented.<br>
When foreign immigrants of European heritage colonize an area of American soil enmasse, unified progress is stifled until the new immigrants assimilate to work in tandem with the greater population.<br>
When one or more foreign born immigrants not of the white race are given unrestricted entry to colonize large tracts of land in the United States, the truth guided decision to assimilate haults the adherence to the Constitution while the situation is made predominantly worse by the replacment of Constitutional adherents with foreign cultures bound enmasse by nonwhite genetics.<br>
Furthermore, white genetic belief systems are further destroyed when basic immigration laws are violated.<br>
Itis imperative that in the course of a properly guided American life, mass nonwhite immigration be curtailed so that America returns to her proper course.<br>

			<p>It&rsquo;s over for white european decendants. Compare it to not maintaining your house, get pests in the house and before you know it the infestation is overwhelming and beyond repair. The rich power brokers bought congress and the white masses thought that the elected officals where protecting the country but all along they where selling the whites down the toilet.</p>
<p>Now, the white race is following the pied piper. Whites will never learn, look at South Africa.</p>
