<h1>Europe Has a Long Wait for Its Obama</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Elaine Ganley, AP, Nov. 2, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Where is Europe&rsquo;s Barack Obama? Not only are droves of Europeans hoping for a victory by the U.S. Democratic presidential candidate, many are asking when France, Germany or Britain will get a chance to cast a ballot for a leader from their own burgeoning minorities.</p>
<p>The answer: not any time soon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obama is rather far away. It&rsquo;s a bit of a fiction here, a bit of a dream,&rdquo; said Kadar Mkalache, tending a stand at the weekly market in Les Bosquets, a tough housing project in Montfermeil northeast of Paris.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Discrimination is only one reason that citizens of immigrant origin are unlikely to soon produce a leader able to crack the system. Another is that the Old World is relatively new to the issue of minorities of color.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obama hasn&rsquo;t happened overnight,&rdquo; said Danny Sriskandarajah of the Institute for Public Policy Research in Britain. &ldquo;It took generations of minority activism in the U.S. to create this space and develop that sort of political acumen &hellip; which is largely absent from Europe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Spain, a magnet for migrants from north and sub-Saharan Africa, most members of visibly distinct minorities are still in their first generation. Elsewhere, they mainly go back three generations at most.</p>
<p>The changing face of some other European countries, like Britain or France, often reflects their colonial past: Their immigrants come from countries they once ruled, and color barriers remain formidable.</p>
<p>In Britain, minorities &mdash; at least 8 percent of the population &mdash; hold only 15 of 646 parliamentary seats. However, a black woman, Baroness Scotland, holds the post of attorney general &mdash; the highest-ranking minority in British government.</p>
<p>In France, where there are an estimated 5 million Muslims, mainly from North Africa, and millions more blacks, there is only one black lawmaker in the 577-seat National Assembly, who was born in the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe. The upper house has four senators with roots in North Africa.</p>
<p>Minorities in Germany&rsquo;s Bundestag hold 10 of 612 seats, although a politician of Turkish origin, Cem Ozdemir, is about to become the first to take the helm of a political party, co-leading the Green Party. Meanwhile, heavily immigrant Rotterdam, one of Holland&rsquo;s biggest cities, is getting a Moroccan-born mayor.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obama-mania&rdquo; has swept countries like Germany, Britain and France. But the minorities remain trapped in political infancy.</p>
<p>In France, the mother country of &ldquo;liberty, equality, fraternity,&rdquo; discrimination against &ldquo;visible minorities&rdquo; is often blatant.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama &ldquo;is the incarnation of the American dream,&rdquo; the French black leader Lozes said. &ldquo;Here, we will ask the question: &lsquo;Where is the French dream?&rsquo;&ldquo; <br>

			<p>Many white Europeans who love Obama wouldn&rsquo;t vote for an Obama figure in their own country.  The reason they like &#8220;our&#8221; Obama is to weaken the U.S. vis-a-vis Europe, and reaction to American pressure to admit Turkey to the E.U., which would permit unlimited Turkish immigration.</p>

			<p>Well, first what you have hear are the cries of &#8220;black supremacy&#8221; and the &#8220;how come we aren&rsquo;t running things in Europe too&#8221; kind of stuff from the third world invaders of Europe. Plus, we get to the see the hypocrisy of white Euros who like to point their hypocritical fingers at us &#8220;racist&#8221; white Americans and tell us &#8220;change is good for us&#8221; but not for them. And I think the white Euros are not so much in love with Obama as they are in the idea that Obama will weaken America. That&rsquo;s what they really are hoping for under Obama.</p>

			<p>I am an Obama supporter: but the main bone of contention I have with electing him is the effect it will have on other Western countries. Obama should be a good president, but his presence in the White House will almost certainly fuel the multiracialist Left to attempt even more zealous and bigoted measures in the promotion and enforcement of their agenda.</p>
<p>Obama may wake up a few dormant whites in the US; but he is likely to fuel ignorance and wilful blindness about race-realism in Europe.</p>

<p>Europe loves Obama because he is a socialist. You could run a poodle for president and as long as it was socialist, europe would love him. Europe can have its&rsquo; socialism if that&rsquo;s what suits them, but they shouldn&rsquo;t expect the rest of the world to want or have the same thing, to each country his/her own.</p>

			<p>This has got to be one of the most idiotic pieces of writing I have ever read. Non-white contribution to American civilization is paltry but it exists at the level of ethnic trivia. In Europe, nonwhites have absolutely zero claim to any contribution at all - NONE. Why does any nonwhite think they have a claim to a leadership role in Europe when they very reason they are there is people like them could not create a functioning society in their geographic region of origin?  </p>

			<p>Europe is not America. Here, &#8220;Blood&#8221; and &#8220;Soil&#8221; stick together. You are not Italian, French or Portuguese, only because you have citizenship. If you are &#8220;Black&#8221;, you can be a citizen, but never simply an Italian, French or Portuguese. Sure, some groups represents a new challenge. Many Muslims are white (specially Turks)including a great number of North-Africans(the new Mayor of Rotterdam is a full-white Berber). The ones that share our values will be assimilated, others should be expelled (Blacks should be expelled aniway).  </p>

<p>Another comrade, comrade Sriskandarajah, of the Turkish persuasian it seems, interprets Mr. Obama&rsquo;s rise this way,&#8221;Obama hasn&rsquo;t happened overnight. It took generations of minority activism in the U.S.to create this space and develop that sort of political acumen&hellip;.which is largely absent from Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>No sir, I don&rsquo;t think so. Political acumen had nothing to do with it. A worthless and traitorous Republican Administration  that has brought this nation to a low rarely experienced by most Americans, is what created this space for Comrade Obama. It could be reasonably argued, that it was Bush and company, who created Obama. As usual,so many people outside of American politics, especially some of the European political commentators, are utterly clueless as to the true workings of the political dynamics in this nation. They need to live here about 5 years and maybe then they&rsquo;d see more clearly.</p>

			<p>In some ways, Obama is very much a European politician- an aloof left-wing careerist riddled through with anti-native &#8220;education&#8221;.</p>
<p>I was hoping for a Bradley swing (there&rsquo;s still hope), but it looks as if you&rsquo;re now in the same leaky boat as us in Britain- betrayed by ruling elites, becoming second class citizens in your own country, and being told this is good for you.</p>
<p>The best of luck, America.<br>

			<p>I actually mentioned this very thing here months ago. Europeans, for all their incessant sneering at America&rsquo;s &#8220;racism,&#8221; seems rather hesitant to practice what they preach! I have a lot of respect for my European brothers and sisters, but when it comes to matters like these, they seem not to see the proverbial forest for the trees! </p>

<p>Good for Europe. And a damn shame that Conservative America is the first to bite the dust.</p>
<p>Europe in favor of Obama? If true it shows U.S. envy at it&rsquo;s prime, and sad to see it come from a continent that should be her closest ally. Americans should be self-preserving all the more. </p>

			<p>According to Christianne Amanpour, an Obama win will cause all the minorities in Europe and worldwide to ask their governments when their time will also come.  If so, all those non Americans out there are going to rue the day they cheered Obama.  Europe is about to face their real &rsquo;60s Civil Rights crisis.  Students only mimicked the rioting because it seemed so chic, but now there is a clear cause.  Yes indeed, Christine, the world will change, but stability will not be the result.</p>

			<p>&#8220;And I think the white Euros are not so much in love with Obama as they are in the idea that Obama will weaken America&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think europeans see Obama as someone who will weaken the USA. They buy the hype. They love Obama because he is a socialist and because he is a young, attractive, charismatic black man and they fall for the hype, seeing him as some exotic mesiah. Most non-whites in europe are muslim and the blacks there are from africa, not the USA, so the situation is different. However, this could likely come back to bite europe in its&rsquo; backside. For one thing, the USA has largely been subsidizing defence in europe which saves them a lot of money, money that they can spend on their welfare states. A socialist USA may very well want to discontinue this or be forced to when the USA goes broke. Also, if our socialism causes us to go broke, it will definitely badly affect europe because the different nations and their economies are so globalized. If one goes down, so do others.</p>

<p>Muslims are hardly a challenge to assimilating in Europe.  The muslims are largely non white and very distinguishable from the native population.  Some Turks or Berbers can look &#8220;white&#8221; but you can still tell them apart from the natives in Europe, it is not complicated.  <br>

			<p>Well 12:41, El Salvador is the most U.S. friendly Latin American nation and they don&rsquo;t permit blacks to immigrate. Their currency is the U.S. dollar and they are extremely grateful for the assistance we gave them during their 12 year long civil war. The major cities are republican controlled but the communists are popular in the rural areas.</p>

			<p>All these liberals are so ecstatic, a black leader in America. They naturally ask the question, when will a European country have a black leader? Well I am white and live in Africa so can I ask when will an African country have a white leader? The answer is of course NEVER, EVER EVER. </p>
<p>There are countless black schools and organizations in America and Europe theses days, so: When can we have white schools and organizations in Africa? The answer is of course NEVER EVER that would just be RACIST!!!! How did it come to this that the only salvation the media and the politicians are capable of selling to us is self-destruction???? With the dispossession of Indians in America they where allowed reserves for the preservation of there ethnic identity, in due course that is what the wasp nation would have to do.</p>

			<p>What&rsquo;s happened in America will happen in Europe unless Europeans wake up to the immigration threat.  These people will come to their shores legally and otherwise.  They&rsquo;ll be given amnesty and the right to vote and they will exercise that power to vote the indigenous people out of power.</p>

			<p>I think America might possibly have seen it&rsquo;s last White President, almost certainly it&rsquo;s last Republican President. They have probably lost Florida forever with Texas next on the death list. So with NY, CA, FL, and TX out of reach of any Republican the national party is doomed. With the changing demographics it will only get worse.</p>

			<p>The main stream media is claiming the entire would (hardly) is celebrating Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;victory&#8221;.  The reason Europeans are jubulent about the preordained outcome of our &#8220;election&#8221; is because they know a white nation can stoop no lower than to have a black president.  The incompetence of black leadership is proven every day all across Africa.  Europeans see America as the next Zimbabwe.  </p>
<p>Last night I slept better than I have in a very long time.  This is because the way is now clear and I know what lies ahead.  </p>
<p>It is of little consiquence who the elites appoint to the White House or congress, because the ruling elites will continue pulling their strings as always while the public continues to focus on the puppets.  </p>
<p>The number one enemies of America are the ruling elites (Globalists) and the time has come to divest ourselves of these seditious puppet masters once and for all.  Our future depends on it&hellip;</p>

<p>Get your facts straight. Dr. Sriskandarajah is of Indian origin, he is not Turkish. There is no Turkish name like Sriskandarajah. The rajah at the end of his name should have tipped you off he was of Indian origin.</p>

			<p>A dream my foot, rather the most horrific nightmare ever to occur. Capitalism and conservatism are dead and cast into the outer darkness. America is now the land of the peasants, to be ruled by the iron hand of it&rsquo;s communist conquerers. America haters rejoice, your day has arrived. The revolutionaries on the extreme left have finally accomplished their goal, and revived the ghosts of Hitler, and Marx, for posterity. Damnation has truly fallen upon this once free country. </p>

			<p>First of all, the liberal media downplayed his blackness to make him relatable and get him elected, but now that he&rsquo;s elected they are treating him like the blackest of the black, and look, he overcame all these racial stereotypes and succeeded as an unlikely underdog in an oppressive Whiteciety. I love when they accuse conservatives of lying! Obama isn&rsquo;t black. He&rsquo;s biracial. That&rsquo;s neither black nor white. Stop claiming victory. Technically Halle Barry wasn&rsquo;t the first black woman to win an Oscar. She was the first biracial woman to win an Oscar. I am married to a biracial partner and we do not use the term black or white. We use the term &#8220;confused.&#8221; Just kidding. We say &#8220;biracial&#8221; or &#8220;mixed.&#8221; </p>

			<p>Forgive me for digressing, but the upcoming Nov. 11 Remembrance Day activities will take on a highly symbolic cast in light of Obama&rsquo;s victory.  The unravelling that began in 1914 is gaining momentum.</p>

			<p>I think America might possibly have seen it&rsquo;s last White President, almost certainly it&rsquo;s last Republican President. They have probably lost Florida forever with Texas next on the death list. So with NY, CA, FL, and TX out of reach of any Republican the national party is doomed. With the changing demographics it will only get worse. Great White Observer</p>
<p>  I think there could still be white presidents but not for the long term, particularly if Shamnasty is passed. We may win one or two more presidential elections, but whites will need to vote as a block, similar to blacks and Hispanics. I don&rsquo;t see that happening unless the economy goes into a deep depression. </p>

<p>We certainly have seen our last republican president, but we will probably get a few more white liberals before the Meztizos take over permanently.</p>
<p>You are right as matter of simple demographics, once Flordia become irreversibly Democrat it will be boarderline impossible for Republicans to ever win another election.</p>
<p>Then settle down settle in for a nice century or two long period of signle party corruption and disfunction. </p>

			<p>&#8220;The main stream media is claiming the entire would (hardly) is celebrating Obama&rsquo;s &ldquo;victory&rdquo;. The reason Europeans are jubulent about the preordained outcome of our &ldquo;election&rdquo; is because they know a white nation can stoop no lower than to have a black president. The incompetence of black leadership is proven every day all across Africa. Europeans see America as the next Zimbabwe.&#8221;  at 8:21</p>
<p>Are you kidding? <br>
Western Europeans are the most liberal/socialist whites in the world&hellip;for them, the culture/music of Brazil, Mexico, Jamaica, Black America, Cuba is exotic and extremly chic. (And totally clueless about what it is ACTUALLY like to live amongst blacks).</p>
<p>This how it begins - through popular culture, music and sports. <br>
Happened here with the NBA, NFL, MTV, etc. </p>

			<p>I know only a few people in Britain who say they like Obama (mildly) but otherwise don&rsquo;t give a stuff. Almost as many feel identical about McCain.</p>
<p>Slippery messiahs don&rsquo;t cut it with the British - except for the drones of the BBC (who HAVE to support him) and blacks.</p>
<p>No way the British would actually vote for a similar character. And the only way the French would is if they were totally demographically displaced, which might not be too far away if they don&rsquo;t start voting more rightwing than the odious Sarkozy.</p>

<p>Actually they don&rsquo;t. As someone else pointed out, they are clueless when it comes to living around Blacks and the only Blacks a lot of them see, at least in any sizeable numbers, are on American TV, which portrays Blacks as brilliant people. </p>

<p>However, a Black or Pakistani candidate in Britain or any other country would not be seen or portrayed as a slippery messiah, same as here in the US. Herein lies the problem. </p>

<p>The older ones might not, like here in the US, but you have a lot of younger brainwashed whites the world over, who would definietly vote for an &#8220;Obama type&#8221;,there just like here.</p>

			<p>I was in Denmark in late summer visiting some &#8220;starving artist&#8221; friends of mine and I was totally amazed at the &#8220;Obamania&#8221; that they possessed.  When I told them that I wasn&rsquo;t voting for Obama this Fall, they all dropped their mouths wondering why I would be voting for McCain.  But things turned out okay when I told them I wasn&rsquo;t voting for McCain either.  </p>
<p>Most Europeans, especially northern Europeans, are like babes in the woods when it comes to race issues.  They naively assume that since all humans possess the same abstract substantive features, that their accidental attributes must also be the same and, more importantly, equal.  This naivete comes from a complete lack of contact with diversity - and diversity, when seen from afar - in movies, on the pages of magazines, in music, literature and art - seems so tremendously exciting to these otherwise dull Lutherans steeped unfortunately just as deeply in the muck of cultural Marxism.     </p>

<p>Why should they care if you did vote for McCain? It&rsquo;s your country and business, NOT theirs. Imagine if they visited the USA, and we chastised them on THEIR voting choices??? Anyway, many people in places like Denmark are so steeped in marxism and lack an understanding of issues in the USA, that they can&rsquo;t fathom anybody not being a socialist. I mean where I live, if we put a system in place that was the same as Denmarks, the mexican illegals would sink it. Danes will sadly wake up as their country gets more and more 3rd worlders.</p>

			<p>If history teaches us anything I would say that everyone continues to overlook the distinct possibility that Obama may not even make it to the White House or of he does it won&rsquo;t be for very long.  </p>
<p>The Globalists &#8220;annointed&#8221; their hand picked communist lackey as president long before the sham election.  They knoew that he would accellerate their Marxist agenda while giving no thought to his personal safety.  </p>
<p>Placing a black in the White House has made America the laughing stock of the world.  Don&rsquo;t believe a word of the manufactured media claims that the entire planet worships Obama.       </p>

<p>&gt; It is true that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but how we (Whites) ever became so mentally mangled that we can see a sallow, yellowish complexion, wooly hair, almost purple liped, shrunked vodoo doll head as attractive amazes me everyday.  Obama is the Orwellian answer for beauty.</p>

<p>&gt;  So true!  I lived in Europe as a private citizen for some time and made the same observations.  What many conservative Americans just can&rsquo;t fathom is how Christianity and Marxism can exist together.  But a close study of history in the early Church shows that it actually was the first historic example of communist practice.  They redistributed the wealth of the richer converts to all - thereby gaining huge legions of converts. (Gibbon - Decline and Fall..) Only later did the RCL establish communal monastaries that shut out and fed on the outside populations, but even they were communist in function.  This structural order has long been set in the psyche of the European.  We lost it in the US during the early colonial period and later due to our long theological and cultural seperation.  While we developed diverse multitudes of religous sects from Shakers and Quakers to Mormons and Jehoval Witnesses and every kind of Protestant sect immaginable, Europe struggled with the polarity of Catholic and Protestant with royal and church domination.  </p>
<p>The same cultural boredome that excites the Danes and other Northern Europeans to debach themselves is the same that has long caused pretty White girls from Minnesota to run away to New York City and become drug addicted prostitutes working for Black pimps.</p>
<p>The tragedy of ignorance is overwhelming.</p>

<p>Haven&rsquo;t we just finished a half a century of Republican party corruption and dysfunction?  (To put it mildly).</p>
<p>I am not happy about it, but I can clearly see that Bush&rsquo;s and other Republican abuses of power and corruption in the name of God, Country and Freedom has created this political reaction and result.  I just wish we could get it right in this country, just once.  But perhaps it is not within the human capacity to &#8220;get it right?&#8221;</p>
