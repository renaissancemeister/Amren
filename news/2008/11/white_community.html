<h1><a href="http://www.comcast.net/articles/news-politics/20081118/POLITICS-US-USA-OBAMA-COMMUNITY/">White Community Adapts to Obama Reality</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrea Shalal-Esa, Reuters, November 18, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Worried by racial tensions churned up by the U.S. presidential election, teachers at one U.S. high school braced for the worst in their majority white community the morning after Barack Obama was elected the country&rsquo;s first black president.</p>
<p>To counter what she called &#8220;unsettling bigotry&#8221; in Maryland&rsquo;s Carroll County, Westminster High English teacher Laura Doolan wrote a 30-minute lesson for all students to give them a chance to discuss the election and correct misconceptions, such as the widespread rumor that Obama is Muslim.</p>
<p>&#8220;Several teachers came to me astounded by what they were hearing. They just didn&rsquo;t realize that students would be so openly racist, that students would &hellip; say, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want a black president. I don&rsquo;t trust black people,&rsquo;&#8221; Doolan said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Carroll County is one of hundreds of majority white communities facing changing demographics that will turn the United States into a &#8220;majority minority&#8221; country &mdash; where former minorities such as blacks and Hispanics are in the majority &mdash; by 2042. Maryland is due to reach that point by 2025 or earlier, according to U.S. Census projections.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But some areas like Westminster are still coming to terms with a past that included open Ku Klux Klan rallies 20 years ago, and a rash of racist graffiti at the high school just last spring.</p>
<p>Located 50 miles north of Washington, which is about 70 percent black, this former farming community has seen its share of rapid growth and growing diversity.</p>
<p>Suburban developments now nestle between farms, and the county has ethnic restaurants, a growing Muslim community, Jewish synagogues and even a Hindu temple. But its demographics have not changed much over the years.</p>
<p>About 94 percent of Carroll&rsquo;s 170,000 residents are white, 2.2 percent are black, and even smaller numbers are Latino or Asian, according to the most recent U.S. Census data.</p>
<p>The county is largely Christian and conservative, backing McCain by 64 percent to Obama&rsquo;s 32.6 percent.</p>
<p>CHANGING TIMES</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last spring, a school board member, Jeffrey Morse, resigned amid a storm of public controversy after he used a racial slur to describe some black rocks at a school construction site.</p>
<p>Larry Brumfield, a retired black chemical engineer, moved to the area 24 years ago with his first wife, who was white.</p>
<p>Early on, someone pasted a bumper sticker on his car that read, &#8220;We&rsquo;re watching you.&#8221; Later, neighbors invited his wife along on an outing, but asked her not to mention that she was married to a black man. His daughters were called &#8220;zebras.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mokhtar Nasir, the chief of staff at Carroll Hospital Center, said he hasn&rsquo;t faced much overt discrimination during his 13 years in the county over his Lebanese-Muslim heritage. Still, he says, many co-workers don&rsquo;t recognize his holidays, and some ask year after year if he had a nice Christmas.</p>

			<p>Carroll County is one of those rare sanctuaries of common sense in an otherwise incorrigible People&rsquo;s Republic.  In 2000, the county&rsquo;s Republican club held a fund-raiser where it auctioned off a pistol.  Though the winner had to undergo a background check as if s/he was buying the gun through normal means, this didn&rsquo;t preclude the media/Democrats/gun-grabbers from whining, and trying to make it the law of the commune that would disallow firearms as raffle prizes, though it did not pass AFAIK.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re getting a rash of racial hoaxes intended to further intimidate whites into accepting anything and everything Obama does.</p>
<p>Notice these same people never EVER complain about black on white racism when it occurs, and it does occur often, because it wouldn&rsquo;t be assist them in pursuing their airhead, leftist agenda.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t believe the.  If they were right about all the trash they&rsquo;ve been crying about the last few days, we would be having fighting right now.  </p>
<p>I get around a LOT and talk to a LOT of people via phone, and nobody really cares that the black is in, preferring to joke about it if it&rsquo;s mentioned at all.</p>
<p>Lawuits by the parents should be pursued against these loose mouthed liars.</p>

			<p>This article actually gives me hope. I had thought most kids were so indoctrinated that they would not realize just how special their own race is and has been throughout history. The students either learned at home or knew instinctively that races are different and each will stick up primarily for their own.</p>
<p>Usually in places with little or no blacks, the people believe the minorities are all good and it&rsquo;s us southern white boys who are terrible. At least that is what I encountered while I lived in Montana. They say bringing us all together will help us understand one another and get along better. All you have to do is ask my wife or many of her family who moved from Montana and now see what happens when cultures collide.</p>

After reading an article on the writer of this article, it is pretty obvious she&rsquo;s got a few issues. Andrea Shalal-Esa who emigrated from Germany as a child, didn&rsquo;t like either her grandfather or adoptive father, married Mohamed Esa, a language teacher of Palestinian descent, and added an Arabic word to her husband&rsquo;s last name to form: &#8220;Shalal-Esa&#8221;. Most of her other articles are a lot like this one: predictable. </p>

			<p>&#8220;To counter what she called &#8216;unsettling bigotry&rsquo; in Maryland&rsquo;s Carroll County, Westminster High English teacher Laura Doolan wrote a 30-minute lesson for all students to give them a chance to discuss the election and correct misconceptions, such as the widespread rumor that Obama is Muslim.</p>
<p>&#8216;Several teachers came to me astounded by what they were hearing. They just didn&rsquo;t realize that students would be so openly racist, that students would &hellip; say, &#8220;I don&rsquo;t want a black president. I don&rsquo;t trust black people,&#8221;&rsquo; Doolan said.&#8221;</p>
<p>What I love most about young whites who have managed to avoid being brainwashed by all this &#8220;diversity&#8221; propaganda, is that because of their youth, they are afforded the luxury of being able to tell the truth. It makes me very nostalgic for when I was in high school (or even early under grad) when I lashed out at some &#8220;educators&#8221; who were stupid enough to extol the &#8220;virtues&#8221; of Communism or the Soviet Union. Oh, how I enjoyed giving my maternal grandmother&rsquo;s first-hand version of that &#8220;glorious revolution&#8221; and what it meant for that side of my family, along with my opinions of it as well. Just the looks on their sub-moronic faces was worth some of the trouble they gave me. As my parents were always willing to back me up with regard to this (i.e., visit a principle or dean with the threat of a legal action) if I was treated with biased or even retaliatory actions in my academic work, I got away with it quite smoothly. </p>
<p>In the end, they have to prove that you are not stating facts or quite deficient in the presentation of what you say or write before they really can nail you. Let us just say, I am particularly thankful to the author Robert Conquest for his 1987 book &#8220;The Harvest of Sorrow,&#8221; on this score. There were others, but that was the one that always really shut them up and made them back down!</p>
<p>Thus, now in an age where feelings are even more confused with thinking, Comrade Doolan and her fellow indoctrinators got the shock of their lives; these kids have not yet willingly accepted their Kulak status. They let them know that having the white fools and nonwhite entitlement zombies in this country vote this multicultural &#8220;savior&#8221; in, was the last thing they would ever have wanted.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because he is not like them, he is an alien in every particular, from his mulatto heritage straight through to his outdated Red politics and economics.</p>
<p>What a nice gift to give to teacher instead of an apple, that ever so unharvested fruit called reality!</p>

			<p>I live in the community mentioned in this article. Yes&hellip;it&rsquo;s overwhelmingly white. Yes&hellip;it has a solid agricultural history, and there are still a number of working farms. Not shockingly, there are people here - of whom I am one - that don&rsquo;t see Obama as the Christ-figure liberals do. </p>
<p>Ms. Shalal-Esa has, however, outdone herself. Westminster is not a community of raving race haters, such as a majority black area like Baltimore City or Washington, D.C.; she&rsquo;d be well-served, in the interests of &#8220;objectivity,&#8221; to take a ride - by herself - through one of these areas to better research the issue of &#8220;tolerance.&#8221; </p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s overwhemingly white, but I don&rsquo;t know what else to tell this &#8220;journalist.&#8221; Our streets here are clean, potholes get fixed, people go to church, county offices answer phone calls, our worst crime is speeding, there aren&rsquo;t shootings at high school football games or metal detectors in their hallways. </p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s the result of majority white, I&rsquo;ll take it. </p>

			<p><i>Located 50 miles north of Washington, which is about 70 percent black, this former farming community has seen its share of rapid growth and growing diversity.</i></p>
<p>Just once (okay, more than just once) I would like to see articles like this show a little balance by adding a paragraph like the following [fictionalized, of course]:</p>
<p><i>But race relations expert Jared Taylor questioned why whites should be asked to celebrate their own displacement and dwindling numbers. &#8220;Diversity may seem like a good thing at first.&#8221; he said, &#8220;but it inevitably leads to friction and the eventual dispossession of whites.&#8221; He pointed to an incident recently in which two Carroll County whites were beaten up by a gang of black youths who were shouting racial epithets.</i></p>
<p>Of course I&rsquo;m dreaming. One can never expect balance in an MSM article about race.</p>

			<p>I wonder if black teachers at inner-city schools are also &#8220;shocked&#8221; by anti-White racism among their students? Somehow I dought they are. In fact, I&rsquo;d be willing to bet that they acually ENCOURAGE it. Also notice that the black engineer has lived there for 24 YEARS and could only come up with TWO minor incidents of racism. And the muslim that&rsquo;s been there 13 YEARS and his only complaint was co-workers not recognizing his holidays and asking him if he had a nice Christmas. I ask you, could a White family live in a black neighborhood for 24yrs. and have just TWO minor incidents of racism directed at them? If they lived among muslims, would the muslims recognize THEIR holidays? We all know the answer don&rsquo;t we! Bottom line- - if these two clowns were that uncomfortable, they would&rsquo;ve moved along time ago!</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t trust &#8216;em either. And they don&rsquo;t trust us proud white folks either. I was at a Denver City council meeting a few years ago where I heard one balck council member say to another about hiring a contractor and he said to her &#8220;We gots to keep it black.&#8221; What he meant was that he wanted the all black business to get the contract and NOT the white owned one which had about a 25% black work force.</p>
<p>Whose racist here? Who can&rsquo;t be trusted? </p>
<p>What is even more repressive is that proud white students are now forbidden to express themselves openly and honestly. If they do, they face serious repercussions. So much for having a different opinion.</p>

			<p>I have always said, it is absolutely wrong that &#8220;racial diversity&#8221; is forced on whites. As an African-American, I say the government has &#8216;no a right to social-engineer&rsquo; anyones community, be it black or white! And, if white people are looking for someone to blame, look no further than white liberals!   </p>

			<p>The problem with these kids resistance to the multiculturalists, is that it just makes the authorities better racists. These &#8216;diversity proclamations&rsquo; become so transparant precisely because there is so little resistance to it. Greater resistance simply forces them to be better racists. Whites need to form their own pro-white agenda or these &#8216;multiculturalists&rsquo; need to be completely overthrown from the top on down. </p>

			<p>If you ask most black people who have their act together, they want to live around others like them   &mdash;   the black middle class and professionals.</p>
<p>Same with white people. The white middle class and professionals like to live among others like them.</p>
<p>This guarantees shared values and a feeling of belonging. It can&rsquo;t be beat and should be enjoyed by all people(s).</p>
<p>The problem is that government, in its usual ham-handed way, tries to enforce a uniformity that, while it might benefit bureaucracy and some aspects of business, leads to a long-term resentment that will either tear the country apart or leave it a cultureless third-world ruin.</p>

			<p>I used to work at the company that bought out Reuters. It is located in Eagan Minnesota and has its own private, armed security force. It is called Thompson West and is a Canadian company. They are very weird and creepy people with a threatening corporate culture.</p>
<p>The last time I posted a comment about them on this site, I was walking around Lake Como near my house a few days later and was stopped by a strange man who referenced something regarding what I had posted.</p>
<p>My mother was with me and later mentioned how stange it was. I didn&rsquo;t explain what it was about because she doesn&rsquo;t want me posting on the internet and is so in the bag as far as liberal groupthink that I really believe she would turn me in to the thought police for reeducation. She believes, like most of the locals seem to, that authority figures are never up to anything but good and are to be trusted. They also don&rsquo;t know that they aren&rsquo;t really thinkers at all.</p>
<p>People around here were &#8220;good Germans&#8221; with all their constant talk about Obama. They have no tolerance at all for other points of view. If you are a thinker you think just like them or you are ostracized.</p>

			<p>The kids at Westminster High are refreshing.  Too bad when they go to college they&rsquo;ll be treated like freaks in a sideshow by the communist faculty, who will then, through peer pressure, try to install a &#8220;world view&#8221; of race into their still evolving skulls.  We, as whites, have got to wake up and protect our kids from the onslaught of leftist propaganda that is being foisted on our children throughout the educational systems in the U.S.</p>

<p>No doubt a young student said something like, &#8220;I think I&rsquo;m for McCain over Obama&#8221; and it was tranformed into &#8220;I don&rsquo;t want a black president&#8221;. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t trust black people&#8221;. Isn&rsquo;t that about par for the course?</p>
<p>Fortunately we have these fine examples of integrity teaching kids (sarcasm).</p>

We&rsquo;re getting a rash of racial hoaxes intended to further intimidate whites into accepting anything and everything Obama does.  Notice these same people never EVER complain about black on white racism when it occurs.<br>

And I notice too that these alleged quotes, when given, are never ascribed to specific people, nor even specific settings, dates, etc.    &#8220;SEVERAL teachers said [blah, blah]&hellip;&#8221;? WHAT teachers said (that their pupils were saying such things)?     You&rsquo;ll never know. This is poor reporting, engaging in nothing more than hearsay and rumor.  Whatever happened to the jounalist&rsquo;s basic question of NEOTWY:  (wheN, wherE, whO, whaT, hoW, whY).</p>
<p>I have to notice as well the name of the author   &mdash;    Shalal-Esa.  What language or country is that from?  Certainly not from Europe.  How often, lately, we see increasingly exotic names on news articles; names that are unpronounceable or otherwise totally foreign to our common European culture which is  (or at least was) the basis of our heritage and which has heretofore bound us all together into a nation. No longer.</p>

			<p>I live in the neighboring Frederick County, MD and thankfully for the most part, our young people are very similar to those of Carroll County; at least the ones in the high schools outside of Frederick City. It&rsquo;s all about what you teach at home. I spend many a night un-teaching or re-teaching the truth from what was spewed by some leftist teacher in class. Teach your children to be proud of our race, for we, the decendants of western Europe created the greatest civilization in the history of mankind.</p>

<p>That is so creepy!  After someone approaching me from the place I worked at and commenting on something that I wrote anonymously on an Internet forum, I would be getting myself packed up and moved far away!  Why do you continue to live there when even your family is that way?  Wow, I feel for you.</p>

			<p>These kids talk in the same manner that people my age talked when in high school in 1970s Prince George&rsquo;s County, MD.  Very refreshing and so honest.  Wish to see more of this attitude.</p>

			<p>Face it.  Whites are going to continue to be encroached upon, isolated, and discriminated against until they are backed into a corner so badly by the rest of the World that they are going to revert back to being the cunning, sly, angry, mean, ingenious SOBs they used to be when back in the day when they conquered the World.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Ms. Shalal-Esa has, however, outdone herself. Westminster is not a community of raving race haters, such as a majority black area like Baltimore City or Washington, D.C.; she&rsquo;d be well-served, in the interests of &ldquo;objectivity,&rdquo; to take a ride - by herself - through one of these areas to better research the issue of &ldquo;tolerance.&rdquo;&#8221; <br>

<p>As a fellow Marylander, you should know by now that Westminster MUST be a &#8220;community of raving race haters&#8221; simply BECAUSE IT IS a majority white community. If your community doesn&rsquo;t have the requisit number of black residents, then by extension, it is a<br>
 &#8220;community of raving race haters&#8221;. See how that works? Glad I could help.<br>

<p>Thank you for your concern! </p>
<p>Believe me, I am counting the days till I can pick up and leave. I have a beloved relative who I take care of here who was always loyal to me and that is the only thing keeping me here. She is 92, so I guess the time is drawing near. </p>
<p>I have always wanted to go to Iceland. And I have always believed that things happen for a reason. Things seem to be falling in that direction.  We shall see&hellip;</p>
