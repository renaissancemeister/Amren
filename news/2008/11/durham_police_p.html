<h1>Durham Police Probe Allegations Officers Made Anti-Obama Remarks Online</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Burlington (North Carolina) Times News, November 11, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Derogatory remarks toward President-elect Barack Obama made on a social networking Web site are now the subject of an internal police investigation.</p>
<p>A police department employee claims the statements were made on the MySpace pages of two Durham officers.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s no exact words that were said,&#8221; said Police Chief Jose L. Lopez Sr. in a telephone interview Wednesday from San Diego, where he is attending the International Association of Chiefs of Police conference. &#8220;It wasn&rsquo;t a racial slur, but we&rsquo;re still investigating it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Investigators, who are focusing on the context of what was written, have been looking into the allegations since Thursday.</p>
<p>Lopez wouldn&rsquo;t disclose what was said or identify the officers involved.</p>

			<p>Aside from everything else, could you possibly understand why white cops (esp. those in heavily black cities) might not like President-Select Obama?  Might their fears and frustrations have some rationale?  </p>

			<p>So a presumably white officer will be dragged before a re-education tribunal based on something he wrote but Chief Lopez will not reveal what was written?</p>
<p>Truly Orwellian, this is worthy of China under the cultural revolution.</p>
<p>Wonder how the affirmative action Durham blacks feel now that affirmative action privilege has moved on to other more numerous and powerful grievance groups.</p>

			<p>&#8220;we&rsquo;re still investigating it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Investigating what? The exercise of their First amendment rights?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it hilarious that supposedly, according to the powers-that-be, porn isn&rsquo;t protected by the First amendment, but that so-called &#8220;political&#8221; speech is?</p>
<p>Guess that turns out to be nothing but a chimera as well in Amerika!</p>

			<p>So, basically, after the left destroyed McCarthy, they began a nonstop campaign to rid public discourse of anyone who doesn&rsquo;t think &#8216;correctly&rsquo;. Until incorrect thoughts themselves have been removed from society, Forgotten. Or at least, confined to somewhere like AmRen. All done under the guise of fighting &#8216;McCarthyism&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m not old enough to remember McCarthy personally, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem he was ruthless as these people. It seems he was the only thing holding them back. </p>

			<p>What on God&rsquo;s green Earth is Jose Lopez doing as Police Chief of Durham, North Carolina??? Almost nine million people live in North Carolina, and several key military bases, but the city of Durham needed Jose Lopez to be the Police Chief? Is this another one of those jobs that Americans simply will not do???</p>

			<p>Remember that it is the upper, administrative component of the police department which will have to enforce any new, Obama sponsored, PC rules, as most police officers are completely opposed to both Obama and his agenda.  I am a reserve deputy in my county sheriff&rsquo;s office and I can say for certain that I know of not one out of some 50 odd members of the reserves who supports Obama or any of his policies.  The interesting point will come, inevitably, when we are given orders to enforce unconstitutional mandates from on high and from where I see things, there is little chance that most police officers will allow themselves to be transformed into jack-booted thugs in the service of some illegitimate &#8220;master&#8221; in Washington.  Obama is not even formally president-elect (he was president as far as the MSM is concerned months ago), not until the electoral college votes on December 13th.  Only then, and only if the electors vote as expected, will he become for the first time, in constitutional terms, the &#8220;president elect&#8221;.  If he was not born in the US, which appears at least as likely as its negation, he will never be the legitimate president of this country, regardless of what the Democrat congress does or fails to do.<br>
Once installed as president, Obama is nearly certain to win election to another term, however.  This will be as a direct result of his and his Democrat congress pushing through legislation which will legalize the approximately 30 million illegals now in the country.  Once this occurs, the dam will have been breached and the flood of third world, uneducated, poor Obama supporters will flood the land, transforming it into something completely unrecognizable.  If and when that occurs, the game will be up and the country will be lost for ever.</p>

			<p>One aspect I have never seen mentioned regarding Senator Joe McCarthy is the question:  Who was his tipster?</p>
<p>Most of - if not all - that Joe alleged has turned out to be true.  In the Senate he went on and on.  Each time coming up with new stuff.</p>
<p>If he just dreamed all these allegations up out of thin air, and they have since be found true, how could he have done that?  He was psychic?  He had to be getting info feed to him by the intell community.</p>
<p>Most stories about McCarthy leave the impression that he was alone in this activity, save for his aid, Roy Cohn.  So just the two of them dreamed all that stuff up.  Amazing.</p>

			<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s no exact words that were said,&#8221;  &mdash;  Chief Lopez  Assuming that the reporters and copy editors got Lopez&rsquo;s words right, evidence is clear of a semi-literate college educated police chief of a medium small city.  </p>

			<p>Of course the officer(s) in question didn&rsquo;t write anything really bad, otherwise, their name and what they wrote would be splashed all over this article. It would make the crucifiction justifiable when it came. </p>

			<p>And the NAACP is also demanding that students who painted anti-Obama graffiti in the &#8220;Free Expression&#8221; tunnel at NC State be expelled. </p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s time to change the name of the tunnel? We could call it the &#8220;free to express the popular sentiment&#8221; tunnel.</p>

			<p>Let this be a warning to all who read AmRen or post on this site.  We&rsquo;re about to become the United Soviet Socialist Republics, with all that implies for surveillance and abridgements of all our basic freedoms.  Just what do you think Obama was talking about when he called for a national internal security force, a million strong and just as well funded as the US military?</p>

			<p>The LAPD management regularly gets its self handed to it in civil court for violating its officers&rsquo; rights. For instance, &#8220;freeway therapy&#8221; (the practice of transferring an annoying or recalcitrant officer to a far-flung corner of LAPD&rsquo;s jurisdiction, thus requiring a two to four hour commute to and from work) was recently declared to be retaliation. </p>
<p>My advice to the two officers would be to document <i>everything</i> that occurs during the investigatory phase, as well as what happens to them should the department find against them. Because they surrendered none of their Constitutional rights by accepting employment as a police officer they may be able to get an early addition to their retirement fund if their supervisors and top management punish them for winning in the internal affairs investigation.</p>

			<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t what one does in his personal time be his personal business and not reflect on his career? It would make sense to punish them, if it could be proven these two officers posted these comments while on the job, but not if they were simply stating their opinions off the clock. Are we becoming so polarised that we&rsquo;re no longer allowed to enjoy our First Amendment rights, which protects unpopular speech, as popular speech needs no protection whatever?</p>

You may be right about current LEO&rsquo;s; I think that is exactly why the &#8220;civilian security force&#8221; that we&rsquo;ve heard very little about on MSM will be needed. Young indoctrinated minds serving as the leftard PC police.</p>
