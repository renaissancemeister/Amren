<h1><a href="https://coloradoindependent.com/14617/ward-connerly-may-pull-the-plug">After Colorado Loss, Ward Connerly May Pull the Plug on Affirmative-Action Bans</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Naomi Zeveloff, Colorado Independent, November 7, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Anti-affirmative-action guru Ward Connerly will likely halt his nationwide push to end race and gender preferences. Connerly, a part black California businessman, spoke with the Colorado Independent an hour after Amendment 46 toppled by an extremely thin margin.</p>
<p>The so-called Colorado Civil Rights Initiative was the first Connerly amendment to flop after making it onto a state ballot. It was also a key measure in Connerly&rsquo;s Super Tuesday for Equal Rights campaign, a nationwide thrust to dismantle affirmative action programs in five states this year. In three of those states, the measure failed to make it onto the ballot, and Thursday, after a feverishly close tally, it collapsed in Colorado. Nebraska was the only state this year to approve the proposal.</p>
<p>In a wide-ranging, hour-long phone interview with The Colorado Independent, Connerly said he now intends to turn his focus to prison reform. He downplayed the importance of Colorado&rsquo;s rejection of a ban on affirmative action programs, and also weighed in on President-elect Barack Obama&rsquo;s historic win.</p>
<p>When asked how he planned to proceed now that Colorado voters had rejected Amendment 46, Connerly said that he might curb his 12-year-long effort, which produced wins in California, Michigan and Washington state in years past and in Nebraska this year. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But rather than continue the fight against racial preferences, Connerly said he will focus on reforming the criminal justice system. He has developed a passion for the issue because, he said, &#8220;I know someone for whom I have great affection who is in this situation. I had to learn a lot more about the system than I ever knew before.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t want to mislead you. I don&rsquo;t want to say I am no longer going to be interested in race equality in our public policies,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think this whole business of what we are doing to people who are incarcerated is far more pressing.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, Connerly would not concede that the weak returns over his &#8220;Super Tuesday&#8221; efforts to dismantle affirmative action prompted him to turn his focus to another issue. In fact he went back and forth on characterizing the Amendment 46 result as a loss.</p>
<p>&#8220;I sort of felt Wednesday morning at 4:15 a.m. that this would probably be defeated, and I congratulate the other side. We have a different perspective, and they waged a vigorous campaign. It got ugly with the character assassination, and I wish they hadn&rsquo;t done that,&#8221; he said, referring to two Vote No radio ads that called Connerly a &#8220;carpetbagger&#8221; and were later pulled from the airwaves.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In spite of his ambiguity, Connerly did say that Amendment 46 &mdash; which performed astoundingly well in polls before the election &mdash; failed because Colorado voters were overwhelmed with the massive ballot.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that the fact that there were so many initiatives on the ballot spoke volumes more about this issue than anything else,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There was a lot of voter fatigue in my view, and they said, &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s preserve the status quo,&rsquo; and they voted &lsquo;no.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A 50-50 vote does not tell either side anything at all. Nothing,&#8221; he added, when asked about the legacy of a Colorado loss. {snip}</p>

															<h2>Colorado Voters Preserve Affirmative Action</h2>
											<p>
							<i>Kevin Flynn, Rocky Mountain News, November 6, 2008</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>Coloradans voted down Amendment 46, becoming the first state to reject an initiative being pushed across the nation that would have eliminated race- and gender-based affirmative action programs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Backed by California millionaire Ward Connerly and a local committee headed by Jessica Corry of the Independence Institute, the amendment is modeled after one passed in California, Washington, Michigan and, just this week, by Nebraska.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a great testament to the people of Colorado that when they understood the truth about the initiative, they rejected it,&#8221; said Melissa Hart, leader of the No on 46 campaign.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Opponents called the amendment deceptive because, while packaged as a measure to outlaw discrimination, its aim was to ban &#8220;preferential treatment&#8221; by government, effectively ending affirmative action programs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We remain as energized and passionate as ever to ensure that no child, worker, small business owner or family ever suffers again from government sponsored discrimination,&#8221; Corry said. &#8220;We will explore every avenue available to us &mdash; another ballot initiative, litigation or just working with government leaders to show them there&rsquo;s a better way.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Question:  What does Connerly mean by &#8220;prison reform?&#8221;</p>
<p>I have always wondered why there hasn&rsquo;t been one state legislature that will merely adopt the Connerly initiatives as a matter of regular legislation, so that nobody will have to go out and gather signatures.  The answer is probably obvious.</p>

			<p>Why the hell should he bother to put his time and effort into this?  He is half black and half white&hellip;.and BOTH his people&rsquo;s made it perfectly crystal clear that they don&rsquo;t want what he has to offer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one thing to pursue justice and fairness by mobilizing people towards this task when they desperately want this but have not been able to make their wishes manifest.  It is quite a different thing to try and do this when it is against the express wishes of the people you are trying to help.</p>
<p>The people in colorado should be deeply ashamed for spitting in the face of a man like Connerly.  They have chosen to live in a racist society that rewards cronyism and ignores merit.</p>

I don&rsquo;t want Ward Connerly to give up.  He has achieved more than virtually anyone else.  </p>
<p>There were three states where he couldn&rsquo;t get the initiative on the ballot this year. They didn&rsquo;t vote &#8220;no&#8221; yet .  .  . </p>

			<p>Mr. Connerly has done as much on this issue as could be reasonably expected from any fair citizen. He has certainly done more than any cowardly whites, who haven&rsquo;t as much as lifted a finger on this issue, where real effort is concerned.</p>

			<p> I wonder about the prison reform too . We had a fellow in south Georgia heading up the Prison and Jail Project, John Cole Vodicka .They were actually very loosely connected with Habitat .By the way, there is also a connection there ever so slightly with Morris Dees . You see, the founder of the charity was once law partners with Dees . Basically the Prison and Jail Project&rsquo;s main complaint was that blacks were over represented in the prisons and treated unfairly there also . If you ever see this guy, you can&rsquo;t miss him, he looks like Vladimir Lenin reincarnated, no joke . He also made it his business to continually attack the Confederacy and the Old South . Raised a ruckus about the SCV having their meetings at a local church .And who built the church ? A Confederate veteran . The SCV bowed out rather than involve the church in anything controversial and carried their meetings elsewhere . </p>

			<p>The Bill of Rights guarantees my freedom of assembly. When I can no longer choose with whom to assemble I am denied that right. What part of this concept is difficult to understand?</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s sad but not surprising, I&rsquo;m happy Nebraska passed theirs but now they need to fight to keep it.  Colorado is hunkering down for more financial hard times, DOL just posted 6.5% unemployment, Colorado&rsquo;s will also go up.  Every week another local employer announces lay offs.</p>
<p>In 1992 Colorado voters passed Amendment 2, the voter&rsquo;s voice was squashed by activist judges.  It&rsquo;s not until 16 years later are other states saying &#8220;yes&#8221; to basically the same thing, only in another direction with different language, such as California&rsquo;s Proposition 8.</p>
<p>Affirmative Action &#8220;enhancement&#8221; law will only be passed with a new direction, using a new language.</p>
<p>The voters will have to fight, fight long and fight hard, to keep good (un-PC) law on the books.  Liberals hate law, they want anarchy.  Conservatives love law, our first set of laws were the 10 Commandments, remember them?</p>

			<p><i>Basically the Prison and Jail Project&rsquo;s main complaint was that blacks were over represented in the prisons and treated unfairly there also</i></p>
<p>Considering it&rsquo;s Ward Connerly, I would wait and see what he says about &#8220;prison reform&#8221; before making assumptions.  It could be he&rsquo;s referring to the targeting of whites by blacks for rape, or the persecution of white prison gangs, while black gangs are permitted to flourish.  Or the fact that, when you consider the severity of the crimes and criminal histories involved, whites are actually overrepresented in prisons compared to the crime damage they actually do.</p>

			<p>I wonder if colorado voters interpreted the ammendmant accidentaly as another handout for minorities ? Maybe this is why they voted no ? Makes sense considering the other conservative initiatives which passed on the ballots ? </p>
