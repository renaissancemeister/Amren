<h1>German State Legislator Backs Sharia Law Introduction in Bavaria</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>IRNA, Nov. 3, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A liberal lawmaker from the south German state of Bavaria has supported the introduction of the Sharia law in his conservative home state, the daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper reported Thursday. </p>
<p>Georg Barfuss of the Free Democratic Party (FDP) said the Sharia should be allowed if there areas which are &ldquo;compatible with the constitution.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The MP, who is also the integration commissioner in Bavaria, added that key elements of Muslim life like prayers, fasting and the pilgrimage to Mecca should be officially recognized in Bavaria. </p>
<p>Barfuss voiced explicit support for building new mosques in his state. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Muslims should be allowed to build as many mosques as they want,&rdquo; he stressed. </p>
<p>Based on statistics released by Islam-Archive Central Institute, headquartered in the west German town of Soest, there are presently 159 mosques throughout Germany in addition to around 2,600 prayer rooms, congregation houses as well as school mosques and Islamic prayer sites. </p>
<p>There are also plans for the construction of around 184 mosques mostly in the western part of Germany where a sizeable Turkish Muslim community lives. </p>
<p>The western city of Duisburg has been the home to Germany&rsquo;s largest mosque. </p>
<p>German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has repeatedly emphasized that the building of churches, synagogues and mosques should not be regarded as a &ldquo;threat but as an enrichment.&rdquo; &ldquo;Islam has become a part of our country,&rdquo; the minister reaffirmed. </p>
<p>There are 3.5 million Muslims living in Germany of which 2.5 million are Turks. </p>
<p>Most of Muslims reside in what used to be traditional blue-collar cities like Cologne, Hamburg, Duisburg, Essen, Berlin, Frankfurt and Mannheim. </p>
<p>Islam has also become one of the fastest growing religions in Germany, as some 4,000 Germans converted to Islam between July 2004 and June 2005 which is four times as many as in the prior space of time. </p>
<p>Some 14,352 out of 3.5 million Muslims in the country are of German-origin, according to figures released by the Islam-Archive Central Institute in May 2005. </p>
<p>Faced with daily verbal abuse and racial discrimination, Germany&rsquo;s Muslim community is also grappling with educational problems for their children and a chronic lack of job opportunity. <br/>

<p>Are these converts blacks or actual Aryan whites? I just can&rsquo;t believe that so many whites would convert, especially women unless they are the stupid blacks.</p>

			<p>There are around 5 kids in every Turkish family here in Germany, usually 2 out of the five grow up to work for a living, the other three are on the dole.  My taxes are incredibly high because of these parasites.  I love my country, and believe it is the most beautiful country in the world.  Germans have contributed to the world high culture and scientific advances.  Yet we are afraid to defend ourselves against immigration because of the shameful period that ended over 60 years ago.</p>
<p>Still, the soul of conservative Germany lives and breathes in Bayern.  Somehow, I don&rsquo;t think we will ever let Sharia be recognized, in spite of the opinions of a liberal idiot.  </p>
<p>The reason for educational problems and lack of job opportunity for Turks is because most refuse to assimilate, even generations already in Germany.</p>

Minister of Integration!!!   In  another 30 years (another generation) they&rsquo;ll have a Minister of Miscegenation.<br/>
And I&rsquo;m not kidding!</p>

After Turkey joins the EU, they will need thousands of new mosques. Why not just hand all the churches over to them, and avoid the construction expense?</p>
<p><i>German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has repeatedly emphasized that the building of churches, synagogues and mosques should not be regarded as a &ldquo;threat but as an enrichment.&rdquo;   </i><br/>
Fool!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth mentioning that government ministers and public figures can only voice support. Nothing else.  An opposing point of view would not be tolerated, at the risk of their career, social position, and income.<br/>
You can either agree (with the official line), or you can agree.   Which will it be?</p>

<p>This is what I don&rsquo;t understand, it&rsquo;s the liberals that are the biggest champions of islam. Islam goes against everything the liberals hold dear. I guess the liberals are so enamored of anything non-white and non-western, that they&rsquo;ll embrace islam, despite the fact that it goes against everything they hold believe. I&rsquo;ll be willing to bet if it were fundamentalist christianity, this liberal lawmaker would be throwing a fit. I&rsquo;m no supporter of fundamentalist christianity but compared to the average muslim, christian fundies are liberal.</p>

			<p>Islam is why I gave up on liberals.  Liberals are destroying liberalism with their blind, unthinking support for Islam.  Islam is completely and uttterly irreconcilable with liberalism.  Of course, this support doesn&rsquo;t come from actual liberals; it comes from the hard-left communist &#8220;progressive&#8221; faction, the greatest deceivers the world has ever known.  </p>

			<p>150 years ago Bavarians were leaders in the fight to preserve their southern German Catholic culture against the puritanical, nationalist, militarist north German Prussian culture.</p>
<p>Historical note.  Serfdom was outlawed in Bavaria around 1100.  Serfdom was not outlawed in Prussia until the 1880s.</p>
<p>And now this Bavarian politician wants Bavarians to be serfs and slaves to muslims.</p>

			<p>This kind of marxist stupidity can only result in a reactionary  extremism neither Germans or muslims want.  Do either peoples want to see radical islam or nazism?  The foreign muslims need to return to their countries of origin.  Maybe economic problems will take care of problem where the political will is too week.</p>

			<p>As I noted on the article about the German soccer player who was punished and under investigation for a &#8220;racil slur&#8221; against a Nigerian, Germany is a country in jail. It is lost, as far as determining its own destiny. Sharia law, in a nation that suffered some of the most bitter religious battles known to the Western World? They aren&rsquo;t even properly settled on the Protestant vs. Catholic thing yet. More lunacy from one of the former great nations of the world.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Germans should see Islam as &ldquo;enrichment,&rdquo; not a threat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wait until the fools see their railway yard filled with smoking, mangled debris, as in Spain, or their busses with the tops blown off with bodies littering the street around them, as in the UK, and they just might decide that maybe they made a mistake by encouraging the importation of fanatics.</p>
<p>But, don&rsquo;t count on it.  Liberals are nut cases of the highest order. </p>

Well, I can&rsquo;t speak for either side, of course, but in my personal opinion, I think that committed liberals truly believe - in an almost religious sort of way - that  the Moslems, after a generation in an enlightened country, will open up their minds and get assimilated and eventually turn into good Germans, Frenchmen, Swiss&hellip; whatever.</p>
<p>Of course this is all an enormous gamble that they&rsquo;re taking!  They&rsquo;re gambling with their country. What if they&rsquo;re wrong? Traditionally and historically, Moslems don&rsquo;t bend to other cultures. Nor do they convert. But liberals don&rsquo;t want to hear that.  And they fail to consider that the Moslems are equally determined that they are going to convert the sinful &#8220;infidels&#8221; and change their wicked ways - by force if necessary.  But the liberals laugh that off and don&rsquo;t take it seriously    &mdash;   just as the Moslems laugh off the liberals and don&rsquo;t take them seriously!</p>
<p>We shall see.  It&rsquo;s going to get very interesting.</p>
<p>And most Germans, I think, avoid the whole messy topic.  It&rsquo;s dangerous.  After all they&rsquo;ve been through, they&rsquo;re afraid of it. They don&rsquo;t even want to think about it.  Sad!</p>

			<p>This isn&rsquo;t even about Right or Left, it&rsquo;s about COMMON SENSE. It&rsquo;s a total lack of common sense to allow immigration of muslims, a people totally different in beliefs, beliefs which are in direct conflict with the West. The Left today has gone off the deep end abandoning all common sense.</p>

Yes, they are white!  These are young, white Germans who are looking for something to hang onto in a crass, commercial culture devoted to materialism,  where life is otherwise rootless and meaningless. This is modern Germany today. </p>
<p>At Christmas time, in every German village, town and city, there is a Christkindlmarkt (or Christmas Market), literally a &#8220;Christ child market&#8221;, with manger scenes, Christmas carols, and little stalls selling Glühwein (hot mulled wine, spiced, and sweetened with honey), sausages, pastries, gingerbread cookies, toys,  etc.  And with Christmas trees  and lots of pretty lights, of course.  This delightful scene is usually set up in the main public square in front of the cathedral or city hall.  Some other countries have these too, but nowhere does it quite like Germany.  These two weeks before Christmas are one of the most charming times to be in Germany;  and many tourists go there to enjoy this.  </p>
<p>Last Christmas, in Stuttgart,  right in the middle of the  Christmas Market, I came upon a very large table or set of tables staffed by several Moslems (in  full Moslem attire, even in that weather) who were preaching and selling (or maybe giving away) Islamic literature.   The tables were surrounded by a number of attentive young Germans   &mdash;   all male, all white - who were listening intently or studying the literature.  I stopped and just observed.  Obviously,  people were interested.  Obviously, the preachers were getting converts.  </p>
<p>And, I say again, this was right in the midst of a  Christian  holiday celebration!  Can you imagine if some German went to a Moslem country at Ramadan  and set up a table in front of the mosque,  preaching and giving out Christian literature?  There would be a riot! </p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t even object, necessarily, to Moslems selling their literature in some other, discrete place. But in this particular setting, it was a brazen slap in the face and an insult to Germany&rsquo;s traditions and culture.<br/>
   <br/>
This is how far Germany&rsquo;s guilt complex and obsession with demonstrating tolerance  has taken them.  I too am in favor of a tolerant society,  within reason,  but I see no need to tolerate those who don&rsquo;t tolerate you.   No reason to tolerate those in your midst who plan to take you over.  Good liberals would laugh and dismiss this as a silly notion. They don&rsquo;t remember their history!   Moslem armies have been at the gates of Vienna twice. Historically, Islam has tried and tried  for centuries to advance up into Central Europe.   They were always turned back.   Until now.   Now,  they are having success,  at last.  They are present in Europe by the millions.   And they are even preaching in front of  the cathedrals!   (In Belgium, some of the churches have been GIVEN to them!)   But the left-wing governments don&rsquo;t take them seriously as any threat.   They fail to understand that Islam is not just a religion but a political force.   And  they don&rsquo;t want to hear it.  In some countries (Sweden) you could be jailed even for saying so, or for  questioning the government&rsquo;s immigration policy.</p>
<p>Yes, these converts are white; and the Moslems are counting on using them as effective subversion tools who can blend in without being noticed. There&rsquo;s no secret about that intention.  In fact, it&rsquo;s already happened in several cases.</p>

<p>Now use your head, man!  How many Tyrone&rsquo;s are there in Germany.  Most of the blacks there are already Muslim.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what liberals believed about southern blacks 70 years ago.  They thought that once their beloved blacks moved from the segregationist south to the northern cities they would be miracously transformed into good students, skilled workers and law abiding productive citizens.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all seen how that worked out.</p>

<p>Liberals hate Western civilization. So do Muslims. So that&rsquo;s one thing they have in common.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s what John Paul II called the &#8220;culture of death,&#8221; of which Muslims are the largest part. Other members include blacks, homosexuals, feminists and radical environmentalists   &mdash;   liberal subgroups all. So there&rsquo;s another thing liberals and Muslims have in common.</p>

			<p>With femminization of Christianity(turn the cheek)misunderstood, comes a need for a teaching that is willing to draw a line and stand by it. As perhaps in general as Europe becomes more effete,effeminate(role-reversal,homosexuality) the void will be filled by cultures that prize and not deny masculine virtue as with Muslims.</p>

			<p>My mother told me this little tale. She was standing in a supermarket checkout queue with an old lady and a young-ish muslim woman. It was the middle of Summer here in Australia (hot as HELL) and the muslim woman had the full-gear on. The kindly old Australian lady said (as a passing comment, you know&hellip;an &#8216;icebreaker&rsquo; to pass time) to the muslim &#8220;You must be hot wearing that dear?&#8221; The muslim replied nastily (that&rsquo;s what my Mum said) &#8220;Don&rsquo;t worry, you&rsquo;ll all be wearing them soon!&#8221; <br/>
Mmmmmmmmmmmm.<br/>

			<p>&#8220;Good liberals would laugh and dismiss this as a silly notion. They don&rsquo;t remember their history! Moslem armies have been at the gates of Vienna twice. Historically, Islam has tried and tried for centuries to advance up into Central Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Exactly. Many people in the US think of Sept.11th as some recent thing. However, the truth is when one looks at history as a whole, Sept.11th is just one of many attacks by muslims over the centuries against non-muslims. It&rsquo;s not something unusual when it comes to muslims.</p>

			<p>Here is Sharia Law in all it&rsquo;s glory.  This is what Western politicians are being bribed to impose upon Western civilization: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7708169.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7708169.stm</a></p>
<p>Treason has become the most profitable endeavor a western politician can engage in today and they are all ultra wealthy as a result of their treachery.  They have all sold their souls and their countries for foreign oil money bribes.  After all, Muslim governments know that bribing corrupt Western politicians into surrendering their countries is far more economical and practical than launching a military invasion that would be doomed to failure.  </p>
<p>Western civilization&rsquo;s greatest enemies are their own seditious politicians who are handing their nations over to third world colonizers.  Once the citizens of our Western nations obliterate their traitors and deport their alien enemies, things will quickly return to their historical norms.  So stop acting like a bunch of crybabies and take action&hellip;</p>
