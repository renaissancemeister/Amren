<h1>Local Papers Report More Anti-Obama Incidents From Maine to California (Updated)</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dexter Hill, Editor and Publisher (Northbrook, Illinois), November 14, 2008 (updated November 16)</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Earlier this week we started covering anti-Obama, often racist, incidents taking place around the country, generally overlooked in the national media &mdash; but covered by local papers. This seemed to strike a nerve with many readers so we will continue regular updates.</p>
<p>Local stories show that anti-Obama incidents (including physical and verbal abuse, KKK outfits worn, flags burned on front lawns) are occurring on both sides of the Mason-Dixon line.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>From the Orange County (Ca.) Register, concerning an incident in Fullerton: &#8220;Two gang members pleaded not guilty Thursday to hate crime and attempted robbery charges in connection with the beating of a black man who was trying to buy cigarettes at a Fullerton liquor store.&#8221; The two men shouted racial and anti-Obama epithets in the attack.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Idaho, the Secret Service is investigating a &#8220;public hanging&#8221; sign erected by a man upset with the election outcome, the Bonner County Daily Bee (Sandpoint) reported Thursday.</p>
<p>A handmade sign posted on a tree reads &#8220;FREE PUBLIC HANGING&#8221; written in large letters beneath a noose fashioned from nylon rope. The sign then names former Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry, current U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and civil rights activist Al Sharpton. The most prominent name on the sign is &#8220;OBAMA,&#8221; according to the Bee.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s a political statement. They can call it whatever they want, a threat or whatever,&#8221; the creator of the sign, Ken Germana, told the Bee.</p>
<p>Germana denied any intentional racial tone to his sign but admitted he would not lose sleep if harm did come Obama&rsquo;s way, according to the Bee.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Mississippi alone, the American Civil Liberties Union has received more than 10 calls since the staff first reported anti-Obama incidents last Friday, according to the Jackson (Miss.) Free Press.</p>
<p>One call was from a middle school vice principal, who claimed that teachers at the school had banned students from talking about the election in class, threatening any student who violated the rule with after-school detention, according to the Press. The school administrator had taken care of the situation but called the ACLU about the legality of the teachers&rsquo; censorship.</p>
<p>At the University of Texas in Austin, a racist post on Facebook has cost one student his place on the university football team, according to the Houston Chronicle.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Burnette said the post was said by a friend during a text-message exchange on Election Night, and that his decision to post the comment on Facebook was poor judgment, according to the Chronicle. He has since released a statement admitting his mistake and claiming that it is not a true reflection of his character.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>AP reports today: &#8220;While the world watched a Grant Park celebration heralding the election of the first black U.S. president, some white Chicago police officers committed hate crimes against black residents cheering Barack Obama&rsquo;s victory elsewhere in the city, attorneys alleged Thursday.&#8221; Lawsuits have been filed.</p>
<p>The Philadelphia Inquirer reported Wednesday that tensions had erupted at two local universities. At St. Joseph&rsquo;s University, a drawing of a stick figure in a noose was found in a classroom and residence hall on Oct. 29, and students suggested that the drawing was against Obama.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At Appalachian State University, the administration has expressed disappointment at the numerous times black students have expressed being harassed in residence halls since the election. The Appalachian, a student newspaper serving the university, also reported conversations suggesting Obama may not be alive in 2009 and a t-shirt seen around campus that reads &#8220;Obama &rsquo;08, Biden &rsquo;09.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A verbal argument at the Pizza Pub in Oswego (New York) Sunday night suddenly escalated when Army fire support specialist Pvt. Kevin Flanagan hit college student Angel Moreno, the Associated Press reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;One [soldier] was saying bad things about Obama,&#8221; a Pizza Pub manager who witnessed the incident told the New York Post. He added that Moreno &#8220;got really upset&#8221; and responded to the soldier, &#8221; &lsquo;Obama! F- &mdash;  you!&rsquo; &#8221; the Post reported Tuesday.<br>

															<h2>Local Newspapers Cover Rising Number of Racist Anti-Obama Actions in Small Towns</h2>
											<p>
							<i>Dexter Hill, Editor and Publisher, November 14, 2008</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Away from the spotlight, many local newspapers around the country have covered recent incidents of racially motivated reactions to last week&rsquo;s election, from flags hung upside-down to the dangling of nooses and cross burnings. As we noted last week, a couple in northern New Jersey who had an Obama sign on their front lawn woke up to find the charred remains of a cross. Local residents today announced a &#8220;unity march&#8221; to protest the still-unsolved incident.</p>
<p>Now come these fresh reports. {snip}</p>
<p>In Midland, Mich., a man dressed in full Ku Klux Klan regalia walked around toting a handgun and waving an American flag. Initially denying it, the man eventually admitted to police that the display was a reaction to the Obama victory. {snip}</p>
<p>Parents in Rexburg, Idaho, contacted school officials this week after they learned that 2nd and 3rd graders on a school bus were chanting, &#8220;Assasssinate Obama!&#8221;</p>
<p>The Associated Press revealed on Wednesday, &#8220;Police on eastern Long Island are investigating reports that more than a dozen cars were spray painted with racist graffiti, reportedly including a message targeting President-elect Barack Obama. {snip}&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>From The Republican in Springfield, Mass.: &#8220;Community leaders including area clergy gathered Wednesday to show support and offer help to congregation members whose new church on Tinkham Road was destroyed last week by arson.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The predominantly black congregation&rsquo;s new church was under construction in the Sixteen Acres neighborhood when it was consumed in an early morning blaze on Nov. 5, a few hours after the election of Barack Obama as the nation&rsquo;s first black president. The timing prompted the church pastor, Bishop Bryant Robinson Jr., to question whether the fire was set and a hate crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>Employees at Hampel&rsquo;s Key and Lockshop in Traverse City, Michigan, flew an American flag upside down last Wednesday protesting of the new president-elect, the Traverse City Record-Eagle reported. One worker used a racial slur during an interview with the Record-Eagle: &#8220;(The inverted flag is) an international signal for distress and we feel our country is in distress because the n &mdash;  &mdash;  got in,&#8221; said Hampel&rsquo;s employee Rod Nyland, who later apologized for the comment, according to the Record-Eagle.</p>
<p>One North Carolina man who flew his flag upside-down claimed that voters were racist, electing Obama because of his skin color, according to the Winston-Salem Journal. &#8220;The flag is stretched upside-down between two poles in a field, with a black X running from end to end. The X is a reference to the Confederate flag, said flag-owner Tony Heath. It reflects his belief that the Confederate flag has been unfairly targeted for protest by people trying to be politically correct,&#8221; the Journal reported.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Just today, two men were arrested there: 19-year-old Forrest Ashcraft and 22-yearold Stephen Barret of Friendsville. They&rsquo;re charged with ethnic intimidation and trespassing.</p>
<p>Authorities in Temecula, Calif., found spray-painted graffiti on a city sidewalk containing a swastika and anti-Obama slogan.</p>
<p>From today&rsquo;s Los Angeles Times: &#8220;Vandals spray-painted swastikas and racial slurs on a house and several cars in Torrance that displayed campaign signs or bumper stickers for President-elect Barack Obama, authorities said Tuesday. The incidents occurred Saturday night in the Hollywood Riviera section of the city, said Sgt. Bernard Anderson. Four separate incidents were reported the next day, he said. No arrests have been made.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Students at Baylor University woke up on Election Day to a rope tied like a noose hanging from a tree outside of Morrison Hall, according to college newspaper The Lariat: &#8220;Later, verbal altercations occurred outside of Penland Residence Hall. A group of Obama supporters were walking around shouting &lsquo;Obama&rsquo; and then passed a group of white men outside who made threatening and racist remarks, said Emmanuel Orupabo, Arlington senior,&#8221; according to the Lariat.</p>
<p>{snip} At a high school in Gray [Maine], a student was suspended after standing up in class, making a racist comment, and saying Obama should not be president, the News reported. Later that day, graffiti making a similar statement was found in a boys&rsquo; restroom.</p>
<p>In Allison Park, Pa., a student claimed that a teacher&rsquo;s aide went on a rant attacking the Obama victory on two occasions, one time in front of another teacher. According to the eleventh-grader&rsquo;s mother, the aide told the biracial student that Obama was going to be shot and killed, the U.S. flag would be changed to the KFC flag, and the national anthem would be changed to &#8220;Movin&rsquo; On Up,&#8221; the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported. The teacher&rsquo;s aide has been suspended while the school investigates.</p>
<p>At the University of Alabama, The Tuscaloosa News reported, &#8220;a political candidate&rsquo;s poster&#8221; on a faculty member&rsquo;s office door was defaced Monday evening. A university spokeswoman interviewed by the News withheld which candidate was on the poster and what was written on it, but WVUA-TV &mdash; a Tuscaloosa station owned by the university &mdash; reported today that the poster featured a picture of President-elect Barack Obama. The TV station also reported that message said &#8220;He&rsquo;ll be shot &hellip; &#8221; followed by the &#8220;N&#8221; word. The university provost and vice president of student affairs wrote to students, faculty, and staff, calling the incident &#8220;totally unacceptable,&#8221; according to the News.<br>

			<p>Hopefully, the racial conflict will spread to the US military.On 9/11 the lid came off for a couple of weeks. There was lots of evidence for this. The  muslims and hindus  will tell you that it was a very scarey and difficult time for the muslim and hindu/sikh communities in America. Unfortunately, White Americans  listened to Rudi Giulliani and they went out and distracted themselves with NFL football, Madden 2001 and dancing with the stars. It was very close.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re trying to imply that these &#8220;gang members&#8221; were white.  My bet is that they were Hispanic.  Though, since official crime statistics have Hispanics as victims but not as offenders, these &#8220;hate criminals,&#8221; if they were Hispanic, will be counted as white.</p>

<p>When the unstable element of undesirables is present, the situation is often like a powder keg.</p>
<p>The fact is that banning political discussions pertains to more than schools these days. Politics can no longer be discussed in most places of business, because such conversations often lead to assaults or homicides if Blacks, Hispanics, or Muslims feel disrespected or slighted in any way. Business owners and school officials cannot risk allowing uncontrolled rage to erupt in their midst. </p>
<p>There is also the consideration of insurance liability. If employees and customers are murdered as the result of a political argument that transpires on the property, the business or school could be held legally liable and financially ruined. </p>
<p>The right to free speech is another one of yesterday&rsquo;s freedoms that has made its way down the tube of egalitarianism, Marxism, and socialism.</p>

<p>The media just loves this kind of thing. Anyone who uses racial epithets to mock Obama is just playing right into their hands. The way to deal with Obama is by portraying <i>him</i> as the racist (which he is). Obama&rsquo;s critics should always take the &#8220;high road&#8221; while pointing out just how low is the road Obama has taken.</p>
<p><i>Germana denied any intentional racial tone to his sign but admitted he would not lose sleep if harm did come Obama&rsquo;s way, according to the Bee.</i></p>
<p>Then the man is a fool. The last thing we need is another martyr like MLK. I hope (indeed pray) that Obama serves out his full four years, so we can see just how miserable a leader he actually is.</p>

			<p>This is nothing more than classic self-fulfilling prophecy! The constant media/campaign drumbeat about race throughout this election process, always harping on America&rsquo;s &#8220;racist&#8221; sins, and one manner of &#8220;discrimination&#8221; or the other, perectly set the stage for these relatively isolated and largely harmeless&hellip;though sybolically huge and usefull incidents. </p>
<p>I got in more arguments with white friends and acquaintences  insisting that Obama would be almost immediately assassinated if/when he got elected. &#8220;But that is exactly what the &#8216;usual suspects&rsquo; WANT you to believe,&#8221; I told them. I would point out the pathological, global hatered for George Bush from so many, many quarters, yet he remained safe - but we are supposed to believe Obama is in constant peril because of all those nasty, nasty white bigots! </p>
<p>This whole election has shown me just how far gone(brainwashed)many, even most whites really are. At the same time there are glimmers of hope here and there on a larger scale than perhaps I had ever hoped. So maybe all isn&rsquo;t lost just yet. Maybe&hellip;</p>

			<p>Good God!  One could found a newspaper dedicated exclusively to black on white, race-motivated crime (wait, someone already did), and this is what the media is preoccupied with?  The writing is clear:  any criticism of this man and his policies will be deemed racism, period.</p>

			<p>Most of all these articles coming out are nothing but nonsense.  The reason for them is to intimidate whites into accepting the Obamanation by the forces behind the yelow journalkistic rags all over the country, especially the Associated Press.</p>
<p>Can you imagine them writing one single story of the absolutely immense black on white racism, crime and violence and giving it the same play as this chicanery?</p>
<p>If a lot more people feel angered because of what they&rsquo;re doing instead of intimidated, these bigots are going to suffer even further drops in circulation.</p>
<p>And, in addition, in the last analysis the tactic won&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>The Obamanation is going to screw up big time and the economy is going to continue to fail.  It&rsquo;s too late to stop it.  There&rsquo;s nothing anybody can do.</p>
<p>We are going into the worst depression ever, and there will be fighting in the streets.</p>

			<p> Glad to hear that some of us of the Caucasian persuasion are not just &#8220;taking&#8221; the election of the Mulatto Messiah lying down. I wouldn&rsquo;t wish physical harm on anyone, but I&rsquo;d like to see him scared good and proper a few times. Maybe it would take some of the cockiness out of that swagger and that Pepsodent grin of his.</p>

			<p>Are any of these newspapers also covering the assault and beating of a white Augsburg College student by four black girls on election night for wearing a McCain/Palin button?</p>

			<p>I am sure that some of these incidents are not hoaxes and that some young white people act out their frustrations in an imprudent manner.  Racist graffiti, etc. is not very productive. However, I do understand why they are angry. </p>
<p>This article is chilling because it promotes the idea that anyone who criticizes Obama is a racist. Being racist is so taboo in this society that it could cost a person their livelihood.  When did America become totalitarian?  What action needs to be taken to remedy this situation?<br>

<p>1)  Most of them were likely committed by Africans to solidly support for THEIR President.</p>
<p>2)  Dexter Hill is a well-known African writer who trots out the race bait every chance he gets.</p>
<p>3)  The AP is nothing more than an ultra-liberal house organ for Africans and their socialist allies.</p>
<p>This widespread joke concerning White bigotry will be about as valid as the &#8216;attacks&rsquo; on Muslims after 9-11 and the wave of &#8216;violence&rsquo; against Jews after &#8220;The Passion of the Christ&#8221; made it to theatres.   </p>

			<p>I hate to tell the thought police but when people are angry and upset over racial issues, you don&rsquo;t change minds with this type of punishment.  It actually makes things worse.</p>
<p>Well, I hate to say it but it is refreshing to see that some white folks are publicly acting on their feelings albeit foolish.  Do I smell a little courage returning to this once proud race of accomplished people?  No, it&rsquo;s temporary.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why black people are so proud of Obama.  He may be packaged like them but he is not their product.  And, he certainly isn&rsquo;t the best we have to offer.  He is an anomaly of both sides.</p>

<p>Funny I never heard anything about this. In fact all I&rsquo;ve heard from the blacks is &#8220;mah prezident iz black!&#8221; followed by some blabbering of some sort. In fact I generally see an idiotic support for Obama coming from almost everyone here. These are probably just jokes among the students that the administration doesn&rsquo;t understand.</p>

			<p>I certainly believe these incidents are real, however, and this one very big however.  Based on the left bias of most regular media in this collection of states, getting Obama elected is not enough for them.  They are all ready running interference on his behalf, raising small little protests and incidents far higher then they really are.  This is to create excuses for his likely future failure.  Not just a right wing conspiracy but white racist conspiracy.   In addition to that, the regular media once champions of the first amendment become the source of it&rsquo;s undoing by there one sided reporting. Finally, W is the most hated President in modern times.  Do you not think the stuff we see here is not an every day occurrence 10 fold against him?  Just that it wasn&rsquo;t reported&hellip;..</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t know about racist incidents in small towns, but I clearly remember the reaction of the liberal media and many Hollywood liberals to Bush&rsquo;s election. Many liberals annouced that Bush was &#8220;not their President&#8221;, and several in the Hollywood crowd even said they would leave the country. Now this wasn&rsquo;t racism, I guess, but it certainly was plain closed minded hate for Bush, even before he was inaugarated. Again, these liberals are hypocrits. </p>

			<p>  It would seem to me, if you don&rsquo;t grovel before the messiah, you are considered a hater and a racist. The media has promoted him to &#8220;Christ status&#8221;, not me. Let them worship him. I refuse to follow a junior senator from the soviet republic of illinois. HE IS NOT MY PRESIDENT, PERIOD. I have no use for that man, I will not do anything that could be considered a crime, but I will not follow the pack down the road to destruction. I will go my own way. I really feel that he is NOT an American citizen, that he was born in Kenya, and that he has been put into power to do the bidding of a select few that work behind the scenes.</p>

<p>It infuriates me that the government-controlled press will blame all of these incidences on Whites  &mdash;  including White gangs.  If the perpetrator turns out to be black, it is either never reported or buried on the bottom of the back pages.  Hispanics, as you pointed out, are often listed as &#8216;White&rsquo; for crime-reporting purposes.</p>
<p>This is from a local paper in California:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Gang members using Obama&rsquo;s name in attack enter plea in hate-crime charges.</p>
<p>Two Hispanic gang members pleaded not guilty Thursday to hate crime and attempted robbery charges in connection with the beating of a black man who was trying to buy cigarettes at a Fullerton liquor store&hellip;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Has anybody EVER seen blacks being harrassed at either high school or college?  It&rsquo;s nearly always the other way around.</p>
<p>This entire article is an absolute lie by MSM liars to further intimidate whites to assure those who didn&rsquo;t want the messiah in WILL NOT cause trouble, or some other reason that&rsquo;s just as silly, against the policies he might invoke.  They&rsquo;re making a unilateral attack, running interference for this black hoping by doing so they&rsquo;ll intimidate everyone from opposing him or his policies any way.  It just makes me oppose him&hellip;.AND THEM&hellip;.even more intensely.</p>
<p>This entire stupid story sounds to me like it came straight from the SPLC or the ADL.  </p>
<p>Such a disgusting press we have nowadays.</p>
<p>As far as I&rsquo;m concerned they&rsquo;ve making things worse for themselves, because I&rsquo;ve been speaking out loudly and often about black on white crime, after these lying accounts have appeared in several far left news sources. and I&rsquo;ve written to two different newspapers, asking why they don&rsquo;t highlight black on white crime as much as they do these bogus, petty incidents, giving them links and excerpts of stories of black on white incidents that involve beatings, sexual assaults, and violence against whites in general.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just encouraging me to fight harder and shout even louder.  </p>
<p>I only hope this economy tanks completely so we can see this evil empire and these evil white leftists eliminated entirely and the whole country replaced with smaller nation states, so we can oust them from our areas.  I&rsquo;d love to see these white leftists liars have to live right in the middle of black neighborhoods.</p>
<p>To those who are bright enough to have analyzed a complete economic failure, good for you.  Let&rsquo;s just hope it causes these leftist liars and evil black criminals some horrendous hardships.</p>

			<p>God forbid that anything happen to The Messiah!  It&rsquo;s bad enough seeing MLK turned into a saint (there&rsquo;s no doubt in my mind that in another 100 years or so, he will literally be considered a saint) when, had he lived, he would have been exposed as the immoral Marxist plagerist that he was.  If a similar fate befell the O-man, we would hear about it for the rest of our lives!</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope, as others have mentioned, that he has a healthy four years to demonstrate exactly what he&rsquo;s up to.  Part of me wonders if it isn&rsquo;t just possible that he&rsquo;d have a mental breakdown in office and step down.  He&rsquo;s had nothing but adulation from the press and foreign world so far, and I have to agree with that nit-wit RINO Noonan that he&rsquo;s like a dog who was chasing a car and caught it.  Now what does he do?   However, the strong personalities surrounding him would likely prop him up, so it&rsquo;s probably just a fantasy on my part.  </p>
<p>Oh, and JustANote, in case you&rsquo;re here   &mdash;   I don&rsquo;t care how much better you think blacks are than whites, or whether blacks are indeed better than whites.  What I do know is that blacks are different than whites, and, as a white, I want as little to do with blacks as possible.  Go ahead and point to all of the wonderful examples of black success (Haiti, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Detroit, Filthadelphia, Nawleans, Gary Indiana, etc. etc. etc. come to mind   &mdash;   just pick up the Metro section of any city in the U.S. for enlightenment).  I&rsquo;ll continue to isolate myself to the extent possible with like-minded whites and distance myself from all things black&hellip;or maybe I should say &#8220;Black Thangs.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;The fact is that banning political discussions pertains to more than schools these days. Politics can no longer be discussed in most places of business, because such conversations often lead to assaults or homicides if Blacks, Hispanics, or Muslims feel disrespected or slighted in any way. Business owners and school officials cannot risk allowing uncontrolled rage to erupt in their midst. </p>
<p>There is also the consideration of insurance liability. If employees and customers are murdered as the result of a political argument that transpires on the property, the business or school could be held legally liable and financially ruined. </p>
<p>The right to free speech is another one of yesterday&rsquo;s freedoms that has made its way down the tube of egalitarianism, Marxism, and socialism.&#8221;</p>

<p>Interesting post but I would like to make a couple of observations on some of the points.</p>
<p>The roots of this are ironically, in our own national demecratic-capitalistic system.  Here&rsquo;s what I mean; As a professional, we were taught to never discuss religion or polictics with patients.  The simple reason is that it has always been known that disagreements in these areas are likely to cause either a situation where the patient&rsquo;s care is effected, which would be an ethics problem - even if a problem like non-cooperation is coming from the patient or a loss of business altogether.  The roots of this probably go back to the Revolutionary War and perhaps before that.  There has never been a cure for this. It has always been really obvious to me how divided my parents generation - the so called &#8220;Greatest Generation&#8221; really are or were and anyone who studies the Industrial Revolution in the U.S. (or abroad) would have to recognize it.</p>
<p>The insurance problem would only become an issue if people were being killed over political-religious disagreements. To date, this is not an issue.  In the event of an all out war, I am sure that insurance companies along with many other institutions would cease to operate or at least, quickly adjust to the situation.  In the past, insurance companies have made great profits during war time.  This is because there are no laws that tell insurance companies how to assign a new risk and how to pay for it.</p>
<p>Over the years religious pedlars have been at war with one another and the public, while the old war between the unionizing forces and the corporate capitallist forces have manipulated us all into steadily divided camps.  The &#8220;culture wars&#8221; are incidental to this as they are symptoms of a deeper problem.</p>
<p>One undeniable truth that is behind all the denial going on in the MSM and the government is that things like egalitarianism, etc., have limits in application.  People are NOT created equal.  We can only apply laws equally, not alter biology (ethically).  But in that realm you can only practice egalitarianism among a homogenous group.  If anything illustrates this it is the Muslims in the West who insist on Sharia law and that others engage in the &#8220;respect&#8221; for their religion as believers would.  The West refuses to admit that there are limits to &#8220;egalitarianism.&#8221;</p>

<p>You are correct to pray that you wish no ill will on OUR President-Elect Barack Hussein Obama.  1st of all I do not believe in superiority/inferiority based on the concept of skin color. I have only found references from ages ago where certain white men harbored inferiority complexes themselves, then, projected their feelings onto people of color everywhere they journeyed.  I can definitely say we are nothing alike, there is definitely something that separates the races. I am spiritual, and that is why I believe that spiritually we are on different levels.   As a human being I do not think I am above you or anyone else.  I reserve that exaltation for the Creator. I believe there are far more advanced beings in the Universe than there are here on Earth. That said, the various races on this planet are different.  The very fact that we have different DNA is a testimony to that fact. You are pro-white, I am pro-black, ok, so what. I prefer my race over yours, so what. I definitely do not h-a-t-e the White-skinned people. I will not treat white like they are less than a human being, because I prefer Black over White.  Would I mistreat a dog because I like cats? When we allow the ugliest part of ourselves to be directed outwards in a negative way towards others, because we are different; that is where I draw the line.  On the flip-side of that, I will not let anyone who is of a different race mistreat me because I am Black.  I love and respect myself. To me the problem with both Whites and Blacks and this &#8220;Racism Thang&#8221; is that individuals lack love and respect for themselves; therefore, they have none for others.  You are right to point out major cities across America are in decay, because the people there are dying, they are poor and uneducated.  When I travel look at the rural communities that are in decay, the people there are dying, they are poor and uneducated.  Death of the rural white area is just as prevalent as the death of urban black areas.  I am proud to be Black, the death and decay of young black men and women in the cities does not make me ashamed of my blackness.  Instead I help Blacks in decaying communities strive for better.  What are YOU doing about your Poor, White, Sisters and Brothers in the rural white communities?  Do you ignore them, then claim on this site you love your whiteness?  We can disagree, hopefully, we can agree to disagree.  The best of the way I feel about myself is reflected outwards in a positive way towards other Blacks and consequentially other races.  That is what separates me  - from - you. </p>

<p>Ah, you mean like white liar Ashley Todd&rsquo;s ruse? Or maybe Susan Smith&rsquo;s?&#8221;</p>
<p>But Susan Smith happened in 1994. So white people scapegoat blacks about once a decade and it gets frontpage headlines and stays in the national consciousness.</p>
<p>But there have been 3 black-on-white hoaxes in the last month alone (and probably much more). These never make the headlines and fade as soon as they are discovered, with no outrage from the media, academia, politicians or &#8220;civil rights &#8221; activists.</p>
<p>You, and all other Americans, remember the name of Susan Smith because she is white. You don&rsquo;t recall the names of Dyron Hart, Lynda Ikejimba or Darshanne Morgan, even though their hoaxes occured with the last 30 days.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you one guess as to why.</p>

If it&rsquo;s ok for blacks to vote for him and celebrate his victory just because he&rsquo;s black then it should be ok for whites to protest and show their disdain for him for the very same reason.</p>
<p>Today Obama has nominated a fellow black for Attorney General. Let the affirmative action fun begin.  Somehow I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re going to like this president very much. </p>

			<p>What is really surprising is that these so-called &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; haven&rsquo;t made it to the national media like all white on black crimes do.</p>
<p>Last night, Bill O&rsquo;Reilly reported that 8 high school students (looked like 7 whites and one black) were arrested for beating a Hispanic man to death.  They haven&rsquo;t been charged with first degree murder because they didn&rsquo;t intend to kill anybody, they just wanted to beat somebody.  O&rsquo;Reilly asked why this was national news?  I was surprised by his question since his was the only show that reported on the Witcha Massacre, where the black Carr brothers, raped, tortured and murdered 4 whites, leaving them for dead in the middle of December in a field.  One survivor who ran naked through the snow to a house.</p>
<p>I am sure that a lot of posters to this site could give Mr. O&rsquo;Reilly a grand lesson on bias reporting when it comes to who the victim(s) are and who the criminal(s) are.  A regular commentator on his show, Bernie Goldberg, wrote in one of his books, that when he was a reporter for CBS, he was given an assignment in Florida to report on several burglaries of homes.  Before he left for Florida, it was learned that the people breaking into the homes were black and that he would not be writing the story.  </p>
<p>As for these anti-Obama threat stories, I would venture to guess that some, if not many of them, are bogus.  Most of us are glad that President Bush will be leaving the White House in January, but how many threats, made openly in the last 8 years against him, do you think have been covered so extensively.  I can&rsquo;t think of any.  </p>

I&rsquo;m looking around in the lounge for something to read when I glance up at the magazine rack and see a copy &#8220;Essence&#8221; with Obama and his wife on the cover.  Someone had drawn bullet holes on their foreheads.  I&rsquo;ve been going to that place for years and I didn&rsquo;t want to see any kind of trouble started so I threw the magazine in the trash.  It could have been some blacks looking for a lawsuit. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Just A Note&#8221; I commend you on your self respect and that you honor and prefer the company of your race! I believe the root of racial tension between black and white is predominately the product of miscegination which leads to identity confusion and loss. People that thrive on hatred are unfortunate indeed. Hatred will never be a substitute for a life. If more black men thought like you, so much of the sad uneccessary ugliness would not have existed between the races, as I see it. Black men seeking trophy white women, unfortunately, with so many mixed race offsping etc. has caused identity anxiety. As enlightened as people want to be, as lofty as our cerebrals aspire, religion included,&hellip;Our feet still touch the ground, we are still rooted in nature.(Birds of a feather) is the natural flow,(we want to look like our relatives). The amount of animosity that many blacks have because of slavery and lynchings, in my opinion lacks proportionality and percpective. Anyone who studies world history can see the world is quite familiar with brutality, I&rsquo;m not sure but I think more white woman are raped in a year by black men than all the blacks lynched by whites on record including those guilty. No point in digging up bones, there&rsquo;s plenty every where and new ones continually interned. I too prefer my own white race but could care less of the havoc that mongolians visited on my ancestors in Europe, fortunately civilazation has made life much nicer for nearly all of us, and no small part of this modernity had its roots in European Humanity,like it or not.</p>
